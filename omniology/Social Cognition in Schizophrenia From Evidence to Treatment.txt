 INTRODUCTION 
 S H A N N O N  M .    C O U T U R E  A N D    D A V I D  L .   P E N N  ■ 
 Th ere is clear consensus that individuals with schizophrenia and related disorders 
experience marked functioning defi cits in the community. Problems with inde-
pendent living, social skills, obtaining and maintaining employment, and estab-
lishing rewarding relationships with others are well documented (e.g., Hooley, 
2010) and a central focus of recovery-oriented models of treatment (Bellack, 
2006). Widespread recognition of the importance of enhancing functional out-
comes in schizophrenia has led researchers to focus on which factors underlie and 
contribute to poor functioning. Over the years, various models of functioning in 
schizophrenia have been proposed, and social cognition has emerged as a promis-
ing predictor of functional status (Couture et al., 2006; Fett et al., 2011; discussed 
in depth in Chapter 6). Th e clinical vignettes below illustrate how social cognitive 
defi cits can impact the social relationships and occupational functioning of indi-
viduals with schizophrenia. 
 Vignette 1 
 Susan is a 53-year-old woman with chronic schizophrenia. Since the onset of her 
illness, she has struggled with interpreting others’ social cues. Th is has persisted 
even though her symptoms have stabilized and she has been able to maintain 
part-time work baking homemade pies. For example, she recently delivered 
pies to the home of a customer. Th e customer, upon taking the pies, remarked, 
“Th anks so much Susan, your pies have surprised me again!” Susan mistook the 
customer’s comment (and smile) for disappointment (rather than her true feeling 
of always being surprised that Susan outdid herself again) and said “I’m sorry 

2 
Introduction
that I disappointed you, perhaps you should order pies from someone else” and 
walked off . Th is isn’t the fi rst time that Susan has reacted this way to a customer. 
 Vignette 2 
 Tom is a 35-year-old man who works for a local company. He was diagnosed with 
schizophrenia when he was 24 and has worked intermittently since then. He tends 
to struggle in relating to others when stressed, which also leads to poor sleep 
(and which, in turn, augments his stress levels). Tom almost got fi red when he 
blamed others in the offi  ce for taking his pens and offi  ce supplies; a paranoid type 
of attributional style. Th is followed a period in which he would read too much 
into e-mail messages at work. For example, when a colleague didn’t respond to 
his e-mail right away, he assumed that the colleague was angry with him. Another 
time, a colleague suggested that he help Tom with an assignment, which Tom felt 
was due to the colleague thinking that he was incompetent. Th ese sort of issues 
have led Tom to be estranged from colleagues at work. 
 WHAT IS SOCIAL COGNITION? 
 Several defi nitions of social cognition have been proposed in the diverse lit-
eratures of social psychology, evolutionary psychology, biological psychiatry, 
and clinical psychology. Fiske and Taylor (1991) defi ned social cognition as 
the “way in which people make sense of other people” (p.1), and Ostrom’s 
(1984) defi nition stated that social cognition is the “domain of cognition that 
involves the perception, interpretation, and processing of social information” 
(p. 176). However, the most comprehensive defi nitions are those that link 
social cognitive abilities to real-world functioning. Brothers’ (1990) defi nition 
described social cognition as the “mental operations underlying social interac-
tions, which include the human ability and capacity to perceive the intentions 
and dispositions of others” (p. 28). Similarly, Adolphs (2001) identifi ed social 
cognition as “the ability to construct representations of the relation between 
oneself and others and to use those representations fl exibly to guide social 
behavior” (p. 231). 
 Th us, most defi nitions of social cognition share the idea that social cognition is 
a set of related neurocognitive processes applied to the recognition, understand-
ing, accurate processing, and eff ective use of social cues and information in real-
world situations (Penn et al., 1997). Can neurocognitive defi cits account for the 
social cognitive defi cits observed in schizophrenia? Th is question has been raised 
in numerous studies of social cognition in schizophrenia, typically presented as 
an argument for a generalized performance defi cit in schizophrenia versus a spe-
cifi c defi cit in social cognition (e.g., Bryson et al., 1997; Hooker & Park, 2002; 
Johnston et al., 2001; Kucharska-Pietura et al., 2005; Penn et al., 2000; Vauth et al., 
2004; van Hooren et al., 2008).

Introduction

 IS SOCIAL COGNITION DISTINCT FROM NEUROCOGNITION? 
 We believe that substantial accumulating evidence demonstrates social cognition 
and neurocognition are related, but separable, constructs. Four lines of research 
support this notion: (1) neurocognitive and social cognitive tasks are dissociable, 
(2) neurocognition and social cognition are reliably distinguished statistically, (3) 
social cognition contributes to functioning above the infl uence of neurocogni-
tion and likely serves as a mediator between neurocognition and functioning, and 
(4) neurocognition and social cognition appear to have diff erent neurobiological 
substrates. 
 Neurocognitive and Social Cognitive Tasks Are Dissociable 
 First, neurocognitive and social cognitive tasks can be dissociated from each other 
using a variety of techniques. For example, Brunet and colleagues (2003) dem-
onstrated that individuals with schizophrenia were able to complete sequences 
of physical causality, but not causality due to intentionality (i.e., theory of mind 
[ToM]), thus highlighting the specifi city of ToM defi cits, rather than a general 
diffi  culty with linking causal events (Brunet et al., 2003). Similarly, Cutting and 
Murphy (1990) asked participants questions about social information (i.e., social 
knowledge) and general knowledge, and discovered that those with schizophrenia 
demonstrated the greatest impairment on the social knowledge task. 
 Interestingly, Pomarol-Clotet and colleagues (2010) recruited individuals 
with schizophrenia with average IQs (thereby “controlling” for general cognitive 
impairment). Th e average-IQ schizophrenia patients were still impaired, relative 
to controls, in identifying emotional intensity despite performing similarly on the 
simpler task of emotion labeling. Kucharska-Pietura et al. (2005) replicated prior 
fi ndings suggesting individuals with schizophrenia are impaired on both nonemo-
tional facial perception and facial emotion perception tasks (e.g., Hooker & Park, 
2002), suggestive of a generalized performance defi cit. However, they found that 
even aft er controlling for impairment in nonemotional facial perception, indi-
viduals with schizophrenia still demonstrated marked defi cits on emotion percep-
tion tasks. Th ese results indicate that although individuals with schizophrenia are 
indeed impaired on a variety of tasks, they do demonstrate a specifi c impairment 
in emotion perception (Kucharska-Pietura et al., 2005). 
 Neurocognition and Social Cognition Are Statistically Separable 
 Modestly sized statistical relationships between neurocognition and social cog-
nition demonstrate that the two constructs do not completely overlap in shared 
variance. For instance, aff ect recognition has been found to have a moderate rela-
tionship with various memory processes, as bivariate correlations range from .23 
(Silver & Shlomo, 2001) to .50 (Schneider et al., 1995), with several other studies 

4 
Introduction
supporting correlation estimates within this range (Bryson et al., 1997; Kohler 
et al., 2000; Sachs et al., 2004). Similarly, attention has shown a signifi cant asso-
ciation with aff ect perception in some studies ( r  = .20 to .60; Bryson et al., 1997; 
Combs & Gouvier, 2004; Kee et al., 1998; Kohler et al., 2000; Penn et al., 1993), but 
not others (Penn et al., 1996). Furthermore, executive functioning or cognitive 
fl exibility also had a modest relationship with aff ect perception in some studies 
( r = .29 to .50; Kohler et al., 2000; Sachs et al., 2004; Schneider et al., 1995), but 
again, not in others (Penn et al., 1996). 
 Within ToM, the relationship between memory and ToM is generally small, 
with one study fi nding no relationship (Mazza et al., 2001) and another suggesting 
that memory accounts for 8% of the variance in ToM abilities (Greig et al., 2004). 
Interestingly, recent reviews of ToM in schizophrenia have suggested that ToM 
impairment cannot be explained by general cognitive impairment or executive 
function impairment (Brune, 2005; Harrington et al., 2005; Pickup, 2008; Sprong 
et al., 2007). 
 More recently, studies have begun using advanced statistical techniques to 
determine the amount of overlap between neurocognition and social cogni-
tion. Using structural equation modeling, Vauth et al. (2004) demonstrated that 
although neurocognition accounted for substantial variance in social cognition 
(83% in their study), in order to model the covariances properly, it was essential 
to keep neurocognition and social cognition as separate constructs. Th at is, using 
a one-dimensional model did not fi t the data well, thus indicating the neurocog-
nition and social cognition were best conceptualized as distinct. (Of note, other 
studies have found less robust overlap; 22.5% in Bell et al. [2009] and 17.3% in 
Couture et al. [2011]). Sergi et al. (2007) also found that a two-factor model (i.e., 
neurocognition and social cognition as separate, but correlated, factors) fi t the 
data signifi cantly better than did a one-factor model. Likewise, van Hooren and 
colleagues (2008) argued that the results from exploratory factor analyses indi-
cated social cognition and neurocognition were distinct constructs, and Williams 
et al. (2008) also found a separable factor for social cognition using principal 
components analysis. 
 Th us, the statistical diff erentiation of neurocognition and social cognition, 
combined with diff erential task designs, indicates nonoverlapping, but related, 
constructs. 
 Social Cognition as an Independent, Likely Mediational, 
Contributor to Functioning 
 Several studies have suggested that social cognition contributes to functioning 
beyond the infl uence of neurocognition and may mediate the pathway between 
neurocognition and functioning. Social cognition demonstrated a stronger rela-
tionship with functional outcome than with neurocognition in a number of stud-
ies (Brune et al., 2007; Penn et al., 1996; Pollice et al., 2002; Vauth et al., 2004), 
including in a recent meta-analysis of 52 studies (Fett et al., 2011). Other research

has shown that the relationship between social cognition and functional outcome 
cannot be explained by neurocognitive factors (Corrigan & Toomey, 1995; Meyer 
& Kurtz, 2009; Poole et al., 2000) and that both domains appear to make an inde-
pendent or equal contribution to functional outcomes (Addington et al., 2005; 
Brune, 2005; Combs et al., 2011; Mancuso et al., 2010; Pinkham & Penn, 2006; 
Roncone et al., 2002). For example, Mancuso et al. (2010) found that a social 
cognitive factor comprised of “lower-order” processes (emotion and social per-
ception, detection of lies) predicted signifi cant variance in role-play performance 
and a measure of functional capacity above and beyond the infl uence of the 
Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia 
(MATRICS) neurocognitive battery and negative symptoms. Brune et al. (2007) 
found that despite the relatively robust relationship between executive function-
ing and social behavior ( r = −.436), when entered into a regression model, ToM 
accounted for 50% of the variance in social behavior, whereas executive function-
ing did not enter the stepwise regression model. 
 Moreover, several studies have suggested social cognition may serve as a medi-
ator between neurocognition and functioning in schizophrenia (Addington et al., 
2006; Bell et al., 2009; Couture et al., 2011; Meyer & Kurtz, 2009; Sergi et al., 2006; 
Vauth et al., 2004), although one study suggested social cognition was best con-
ceptualized as a moderator rather than a mediator (Nienow et al., 2006). Th us, this 
line of research suggests that social cognition may be one mechanism by which 
neurocognitive impairment aff ects functioning in the community, consistent with 
prior conjectures (Green et al., 2000) that social cognition is more directly tied to 
functioning, given that it is theoretically more proximal to social interactions than 
is neurocognition. Although these fi ndings have not yet been demonstrated in 
longitudinal work required for a stringent test of mediation, they clearly provide 
support both for the importance of social cognition, as well as for its ability to be 
distinguished from neurocognition. 
 Different Neural Substrates for Neurocognition 
Versus Social Cognition 
  Investigations into the neural substrates underlying neurocognition and social 
cognition have suggested that two brain systems are involved in the processing 
of emotions: a ventral system, including the amygdala, ventral anterior cingulate 
gyrus, and ventral prefrontal cortex, which plays a role in identifying emotion; and 
a dorsal system, including the hippocampus, dorsal regions of the anterior cin-
gulate gyrus, and the dorsal prefrontal cortex, which is involved in the allocation 
of attention, planning, and eff ortful behavior (Bozikas et al., 2004; Phillips et al., 
2003). Furthermore, some researchers have concluded that there is evidence to sup-
port the presence of a “social cognitive neural circuit,” incorporating the amygdala, 
fusiform gyrus, superior temporal sulcus, and prefrontal cortices (Adolphs, 2001; 
Blakemore & Frith, 2004; Lee et al., 2004; Phillips et al., 2003; Pinkham et al., 2003; 
Pinkham et al., 2008a, 2008b; Winston et al., 2004). Th e amygdala, in particular, has 

6 
Introduction
been found to play an important role in responses to emotional stimuli, particularly 
in the identifi cation of the emotional signifi cance of stimuli in general (Adolphs 
et al., 1999, 2002; Aleman & Kahn, 2005; Phillips, 2003), and negatively-valenced 
emotions in particular (Adolphs & Tranel, 2003). It appears the amygdala may be 
most accurately characterized as involved in automatic processing, which may then 
bias social cognitive processing, rather than being recruited specifi cally for the 
cognitive processes involved in social cognition (Adolphs, 2009). Th us, it appears 
that certain neural structures show greater activation during social cognitive than 
neurocognitive processing, which again lends support for the relative distinction 
between these constructs (Phillips et al., 2003). 
 Th ese results are further supported by fi ndings from research on individuals 
with brain damage and other neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, individu-
als with frontal lobe damage (Anderson et al., 1999; Blair & Cipolotti, 2000; Fine 
et al., 2001) or prosopagnosia (Kanwisher, 2000) show signifi cantly impaired per-
formance in varying areas of social cognition, such as ToM and facial processing, 
but have intact discrimination of other types of nonsocial stimuli. In contrast, 
individuals with Williams syndrome tend to show a relative strength in social 
cognitive abilities, such as the detection of basic emotions from faces and normal 
performance on fi rst-order ToM tasks (Jones et al., 2000), but have marked defi -
cits in other aspects of neurocognition (Tager-Flusberg et al., 1998; reviewed in 
Pinkham et al., 2003). Th us, there appears to be consensus among social cognitive 
neuroscientists that social information is processed diff erently in the brain than is 
nonsocial information; that is, that there is something unique about the way the 
brain responds to social cognitive stimuli (Adolphs, 2009; Insel, 2010). 
 Th e foregoing indicates that neurocognition and social cognition can be dif-
ferentiated across a range of study methodologies. However, it is also clear that 
neurocognitive ability plays a role in social cognition. Th e next section highlights 
the domains of social cognition that will serve as a focus of this book. 
 DOMAINS OF SOCIAL COGNITION 
 In schizophrenia, the most commonly studied domains of social cognition include 
emotion perception, social perception, attributional style, and ToM (Green et al., 
2005, 2008; Green & Horan, 2010; Pinkham et al., 2003). Each of these domains 
will be discussed in more depth in later chapters. Briefl y, emotion perception (also 
called emotion recognition, aff ect recognition, or aff ect perception) is the ability 
to ascertain emotional information (i.e., what the other person is feeling) from 
facial expressions, vocal infl ections (i.e., prosody), body movement, or some com-
bination of these. Social perception is typically defi ned as the ability to use social 
cues and context to ascertain social roles or interpersonal aspects of the social 
situation (e.g., intimacy or status). Attributional style refers to stylistic modes of 
explaining social events, such as whether the event occurred as a consequence of 
the individual’s actions, other’s actions, or due to features of the situation. Th eory 
of mind involves both the ability to understand that others have mental states

Introduction

diff erent from one’s own and the capability to make inferences about the content 
of those mental states (e.g., others’ intentions). 
 Although these constructs have yielded useful measures and relatively consis-
tent fi ndings that individuals with schizophrenia are defi cient in these abilities 
(e.g., Bora et al., 2009; Kohler et al., 2010; Sprong et al., 2007), there has been 
no unifying model of social cognition within schizophrenia. Th us, the domains 
previously studied were not selected via empirical means to determine whether 
they capture the full extent of social cognitive ability. Notably, some researchers 
consider emotion perception, including the National Institute of Mental Health 
(NIMH) MATRICS group, to be part of a larger construct called emotion process-
ing (Green et al., 2008). Emotion processing involves emotion perception plus 
additional components, such as understanding how to eff ectively manage emo-
tions, diff erentiating between the usefulness of emotions, or expressing emotions 
(Green et al., 2008; Phillips & Seidman, 2008). Th e emphasis on understanding 
emotions in a broader sense than being able to perceive emotions correctly in 
others is refl ected in the incorporation of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional 
Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) managing emotions subtest as part of the MATRICS 
battery as the measure to assess social cognition. Th is choice is in contrast to prior 
approaches that did not conceptualize social cognition as encompassing emotional 
regulation components (for a full discussion of emotion processing, see Chapter 
7). Th is point relates to the fact that there has been little empirical exploration of 
the structure of social cognition or the relations among the domains purported to 
comprise it, or consideration of additional domains neglected in prior research. 
 As such, this volume takes a broader perspective and includes chapters written 
by experts from social psychology, social cognitive neuroscience, developmental 
psychopathology, and cross-cultural psychology in addition to experts from the 
fi eld of social cognition in schizophrenia. For example, the fi eld of social psychol-
ogy has a more expansive defi nition of social cognition involving self-relevant 
cognitive processing, motivated/emotional eff ects on cognition, and heuristics 
and biases, as well as a distinction between automatic and controlled processing 
similar to social neuroscience perspectives (Lieberman, 2007) (see Chapter 2 for 
a description of social psychology’s perspectives on social cognition). In addition, 
recent research by Stefan Moritz and Todd S. Woodward has also expanded social 
cognition in schizophrenia to include  metacognition , or thinking about one’s 
thinking. Th eir basic and treatment research has demonstrated that individuals 
with schizophrenia have problems with understanding methods for problem solv-
ing and decision making resulting from problems with jumping to conclusions, 
attributional biases, and ToM (see Chapter 15). 
 ISSUES IN THE MEASUREMENT OF SOCIAL 
COGNITION IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 
 Although issues relevant to the measurement of social cognition and the descrip-
tion of specifi c tasks will be covered in more detail elsewhere in this volume, we

Introduction
will briefl y discuss some of the critical methodological and measurement issues 
that impact much of social cognitive research in schizophrenia. 
 Structure of Social Cognition 
 First and foremost, it is important to note that the structure of social cognition is 
generally unknown (Green et al., 2008; Mancuso et al., 2010; Sergi et al., 2007). 
Th at is, there are little data on the relationships among proposed facets of social 
cognition (i.e., emotion perception, ToM, attributional style), and almost no data 
on whether these facets appear to be a part of the underlying latent construct 
of social cognition. One recent study found social cognition to be comprised 
of three subfactors: one for attributional style, one for “lower-order” processing 
(emotion perception and detecting lies), and one for “higher-order” processing 
(managing emotions and detecting sarcasm) (Mancuso et al., 2010). Th e fac-
tor for attributional style was relatively uncorrelated with the other two factors, 
which were modestly associated with one another ( r = .26). An interesting point 
to note here is that many social cognitive tasks, particularly those for emotion 
perception and ToM, are typically based on an index of performance accuracy, 
whereas attributional style measures are scored based on a characteristic way 
of responding or bias. It is reasonable that methodological diff erences between 
tasks such as this one may impact the strength of the relationship among social 
cognitive tasks. 
 Other research also supports the proposal that social cognition is comprised of 
distinct, but related, subconstructs. Specifi cally, Njomboro and colleagues (2008) 
found that in brain lesioned patients, the perception of emotions from facial dis-
plays was intact, but ToM reasoning was impaired. Th ese fi ndings suggest that 
these two components of social cognition may be distinct constructs under the 
umbrella of social cognition. However, some of the tasks developed to assess 
social cognitive ability are less clearly diff erentiated. For instance, the Eyes Test 
(Baron-Cohen et al., 2001) is a prime example of conceptual overlap within tasks. 
During the Eyes Test, participants are shown 36 pairs of eyes and asked to select, 
from four responses, the choice that most accurately refl ects what the person is 
thinking or feeling. Although it is generally considered a test of ToM (Bora et al., 
2009), it clearly includes elements of emotion perception as well. 
 An additional problem in considering the structure of social cognition is the 
development of new tasks that do not readily fi t into previously established cat-
egories. Judgments about trustworthiness from viewing static facial displays (e.g., 
as used in Baas et al., 2008; Couture et al., 2010) do not fi t with other domains of 
social cognition, but do seem to relate to the construct of social cognition more 
broadly. Within the domain of ToM, new approaches have been developed based 
on neuroscience research suggesting that ToM may be separable into two com-
ponents: social-perceptual (detection of mental states from readily available cues 
like facial expression and body movement) and social-cognitive (reasoning about 
the content of another’s mental state) ToM (Bora et al., 2008; Sabbagh, 2004).

Introduction

Little is known about how some of these new developments relate to more estab-
lished social cognitive tasks and domains. 
 Th ese problems all relate to one general point: No clear agreement has been 
reached about the domains of social cognition to consider in schizophrenia, 
nor on the tasks that should be used in research. Tasks for particular studies are 
oft en based on researcher impressions and opinion rather than on clear empirical 
grounding, and oft en research groups develop their own task to suit their study’s 
purpose. Th eory of mind tasks, in particular, are widely variable. Two recent 
meta-analyses subdivided ToM tasks into multiple categories, ranging from four 
(Sprong et al., 2007) to seven (Bora et al., 2009). Despite having multiple catego-
ries, both meta-analyses had to exclude studies that used tasks that did not fi t into 
any of these categories. Task variability has implications for comparing results 
across studies (Harrington et al., 2005; Yager & Ehmann, 2006). 
 Psychometric Properties 
  Few studies report psychometric data for social cognitive tasks (Green et al., 
2008; Yager & Ehmann, 2006). Commonly used tasks, such as the Facial Emotion 
Identifi cation and Discrimination Tasks (FEIT, FEDT; Kerr & Neale, 1993), have 
demonstrated poor internal consistency when evaluated (e.g., Kee et al., 2004; 
Penn et al., 2000). It is noteworthy that establishing internal consistency for these 
types of tasks may be somewhat complicated by uncertainty regarding universal 
impairment on all emotions (Marwick & Hall, 2008). In other words, if individu-
als with schizophrenia are more impaired on some emotions compared to oth-
ers, how might this impact internal consistency? Should we expect high internal 
consistency across emotions, within emotions, or both? Although this concep-
tual wrinkle deserves consideration, it is clear that most published studies do not 
present these data and, thus, much is unknown about the internal consistency of 
social cognitive measures. 
 Even less data are available on other psychometric variables, such as test–retest 
reliability, fl oor and ceiling eff ects, normality of distributions, construct validity, 
predictive validity, or norms. Th e little data available do suggest that ceiling eff ects 
or limited range of scores may be problematic for at least some social cognitive 
measures (Bora et al., 2009; Corcoran & Frith, 2003; Green et al., 2008; Kohler 
et al., 2003; Versmissen et al., 2008). Given the recent focus on developing treat-
ments to address social cognitive defi cits (as discussed in Part III of this book), the 
lack of data on the utility of measures for repeated assessment and their suscepti-
bility to practice eff ects is especially concerning. 
 Ecological Validity 
  Given the important role social cognition plays in functioning, the ability of tasks 
to approximate real-life social situations is critical. Many tasks consist of static 

10 
Introduction
displays, oft en of faces alone, and information is typically presented only in one 
sensory modality. Little consideration is given to how individuals with schizo-
phrenia incorporate multiple cues and consider context in their understanding of 
social situations. In addition, tasks oft en use posed facial expressions (as opposed 
to genuine expressions) and hypothetical scenarios that may have limited rele-
vance in the lives of individuals with schizophrenia (Aarke et al., 2009; Beese & 
Stratton, 2004; Johnston et al., 2008). Many of these issues can be attributed to 
the diffi  culty inherent in balancing the confl icting demands of internal validity 
and ecological validity; however, it is important that subsequent research begin 
to develop a more sophisticated approach to assessing social cognitive ability in 
schizophrenia in an eff ort to further refi ne our interventions. 
 CONCLUSION AND INTRODUCTION TO TRANSLATIONAL 
THEME OF THIS BOOK 
 Th e fi eld of social cognition in schizophrenia has expanded rapidly in recent 
decades (Green & Leitman, 2008), refl ecting evidence suggesting that social cog-
nition plays an important role in functioning (Couture et al., 2006; Fett et al., 
2011) and its potential as a point of intervention in schizophrenia (Penn et al., 
2007). It is important to acknowledge that although this rapid expansion has con-
tributed to our understanding of schizophrenia, many of the constructs of interest 
were borrowed from other fi elds and operationalized in a variety of ways before 
consensus on which constructs should be included in social cognitive schizophre-
nia research. Th is book synthesizes and integrates fi ndings not only from the fi eld 
of schizophrenia, but also from experts in related fi elds. Integration of fi ndings 
from basic science and experimental psychopathology approaches in Parts I and 
II will provide a clear picture of current knowledge and provide directions for 
future research. Part III translates fi ndings from Parts I and II to provide treat-
ment approaches for clinicians. 
 Th e ensuing chapters in this book expand upon many of the topics mentioned 
in the preceding sections. Part I focuses on broad topics in the basic science of 
social cognition across disorders and normal development. Chapter 1 provides an 
overview of the acquisition of social cognitive skills in childhood and the role that 
failure to acquire appropriate skills plays in the development of psychopathol-
ogy. Chapter 2 explores social cognitive skills in adults from the perspective of 
social psychology. Th e cross-cultural applicability of social cognition is described 
in Chapter 3. Chapters 4 and 5 provide important insights from the fi eld of social 
cognitive neuroscience. 
 In Part II, we turn our focus to social cognition within schizophrenia. Chapter 
6 addresses the important topic of the link between social cognition and social 
functioning in schizophrenia, and addresses some of the concerns raised in this 
chapter about the unique contribution of social cognition above and beyond neu-
rocognition to functioning. Chapters 7, 8, and 9 focus on major components of 
social cognition within schizophrenia (emotion processing, ToM, and attributional

style) and summarize the state-of-the-science in these domains. Given the impor-
tance of early intervention in schizophrenia, Chapter 10 focuses on social cogni-
tion early in the course of schizophrenia. Chapter 11 follows from Chapters 4 and 
5 in Part I by describing social cognitive neuroscience fi ndings in schizophrenia. 
 Part III provides the practical implications of research fi ndings from Parts I and 
II. Chapter 12 provides an overview of social cognitive approaches to treatment 
in schizophrenia. It is followed by descriptions of current treatments available 
for social cognitive defi cits in schizophrenia: Integrated Neurocognitive Th erapy 
(Chapter 13), Cognitive Enhancement Th erapy (Chapter 14), Metacognitive 
Training (Chapter 15), and Social Cognition and Interaction Training (Chapter 16). 
In the Conclusion, an integrative summary of the book’s contents and implica-
tions for future research are discussed.

 The Development of Social 
Cognition in Theory and Action  
 K R I S T E N  E .    LY O N S   A N D    M E L I S S A  A .    K O E N I G  ■ 
 Humans are highly social beings. From our earliest moments, our lives are deeply 
and intricately intertwined with those of our caregivers. As children develop, their 
social world expands to include siblings, relatives, peers, and the vast number of 
individuals that they encounter throughout their daily lives, from neighbors and 
friends to co-workers and clients. To make sense of this social world and to navigate 
daily interactions eff ectively, individuals must have an appreciation of the unobserv-
able psychological forces that underlie others’ behavior. Understanding that anoth-
er’s actions are driven by that person’s thoughts, desires, and beliefs, and that these 
internal mental states are shaped by that person’s previous experience, enables us to 
predict how others are likely to act and how others will likely view or respond to our 
actions. Th e goal of this chapter is to provide an overview of how typically develop-
ing individuals come to understand the nuances of the psychological world. 
 Th e term  theory of mind (ToM) refers to the framework that informs children’s 
and adults’ understanding of behavior (Flavell, 2004b; Wellman & Liu, 2004). 
Core elements of this understanding include the notions that (a) other people 
have intentions, desires, and beliefs; (b) these internal mental states motivate other 
people’s behavior; (c) mental states and processes are based on an individual’s pre-
vious experience; and (d) mental representations may diff er between individuals 
and from reality. Over the last 25 years, much has been learned about the typical 
trajectory of children’s developing ToM. However, rigorous debate continues over 
the mechanisms of change, and developmental scientists have only recently begun 
to investigate how children, increasingly with age, use their ToM understanding 
in their learning and social interactions. 
 THE DEVELOPMENTAL COURSE OF THEORY OF MIND 
 In typically developing children, ToM emerges gradually, with rapid improvement 
being observed in the fi rst 5 years of life (Wellman & Liu, 2004), although subtle 

20 
foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
and important improvements are observed throughout childhood (Baron-Cohen, 
O’Riordan, Stone, Jones, & Plaisted, 1999; Dumontheil, Apperly, & Blakemore, 
2010; Perner & Wimmer, 1985), and individual diff erences in ToM are even 
detected in adults (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Hill, Raste, & Plumb, 2001). Th ere 
is general consensus that three key milestones in the development of social cogni-
tion are achieved in a staggered timeline, with understanding of intentions pre-
ceding understanding of desires, followed by an understanding of belief (Sodian 
& Kristen, 2010; Wellman & Liu, 2004). 
 Before a child can analyze the diff erent ways in which a person’s mind relates to 
facts of the world, they begin with a basic appreciation that others have a mental 
life (Meltzoff , 1988). When asking whether infants construe others as having a 
psychological life, we are asking if infants treat the behavior of inanimate objects 
or machines as distinct from the behavior of people. Research demonstrates that 
infants indeed expect people, but not inanimate entities, to engage in certain types 
of behavior. For example, young infants anticipate that human hands cause other 
objects to move, but blocks or trains do not (Leslie, 1984; Saxe, Tzelnic, & Carey, 
2007). Infants also expect that humans, but not robots, balls, or inanimate objects, 
will begin to move without causal contact with another entity (Kosugi, Ishida, & 
Fujita, 2003; Legerstee, 1992; Spelke, 2003). 
 Young infants even appear to appreciate, at some level, that human action is 
motivated by intentions. Th at is to say, rather than viewing human behavior as 
random movements through space, infants perceive and encode human actions 
as goal-directed (e.g., a person reaching for a toy) (Flavell, 2004b). For example, 
using a habituation paradigm, Woodward (1998) showed 6-month-old infants 
scenes taking place on a small stage that had two toys (e.g., a teddy bear on the 
left  side of the stage and a ball on the right side of the stage). During the habitu-
ation phase, a hand repeatedly moved across the stage and grasped one of two 
toys (e.g., the teddy bear). During the test phase, the locations of the two toys 
were switched (e.g., so that the teddy bear was on the right and the ball was on 
the left ). Infants were then shown two new scenes: the hand following the same 
path to grasp the other toy (“new goal events”), and the hand following a diff erent 
path to grasp the same toy (“new path events”). Infants looked longer when the 
hand grasped a new object, suggesting that they viewed this scene (in which the 
hand displayed a diff erent intention) as more novel and interesting than the alter-
native scene (in which the hand displayed the same intention but displayed dis-
similar spatiotemporal properties). Notably, this pattern was not observed when 
an inanimate grasping rod was used, nor when the hand was covered by a sparkly 
glove, nor when the back of the hand fl opped near the object, thus suggesting 
that infants attribute goals (and perhaps intentions) to the well-defi ned actions of 
human actors. 
 In eff orts to explain the source of this intentional attribution, some have sug-
gested that the ability to view human action as intentional is dependent upon one’s 
own fi rst-hand experience in engaging in similar acts (Sommerville, Woodward, 
& Needham, 2005). Infants younger than 5–6 months of age (who are not yet 
physically capable of self-directed reaching and grasping) do not discriminate

between new goal and new path events at test. However, providing young infants 
with only a few minutes of reaching experience by putting sticky Velcro mittens 
on their hands (that allow them to “pick up” toys simply by touching them) causes 
infants as young as 3 months to preferentially look at the new goal scene com-
pared to the scene with the new path (Sommerville, et al., 2005). Taken together, 
the results suggest that a nascent framework for understanding human action may 
be available very early in human development and that the development of such 
a framework may depend, in part, upon one’s own fi rst-hand experience with the 
actions one is perceiving. 
 Imitation studies provide further evidence that very young children look beyond 
the surface features of a scene to extract the underlying mental motivation. Infants 
as young as 14 months of age readily imitate the actions of adults (e.g., Meltzoff , 
1988). However, they are discriminate in their choice of the action to imitate, 
selectively imitating only intended actions. In one study, for example, 14- to 
18-month-old infants imitated a majority of actions that were marked by an adult 
as intentional (i.e., actions that were followed by the adult saying “Th ere!”), but 
imitated less than half of the actions that were marked as accidental (i.e., actions 
that were followed by adults saying “Oops!”) (Carpenter, Akhtar, & Tomasello, 
1998). In another study, 18-month-old children viewed adults attempting but fail-
ing to perform an action (e.g., attempting to pull apart a dumb-bell). When they 
were given an opportunity to play with each of the objects themselves, infants 
tended to execute the intended action (which they had never seen), rather than 
the observed failed actions (Meltzoff , 1995). Taken together, these results suggest 
that during the second half of the fi rst year through the second year of life, chil-
dren robustly extract others’ intent from the surface features of their actions. 
 Th e second major milestone in ToM development is typically achieved midway 
through the second year. At this age, children begin to exhibit an appreciation that 
others’ behavior is motivated by their desires, and that others may have desires 
that diff er from one’s own. To test whether young children could reason in this 
way about desires, Repacholi and Gopnik (1997) conducted an experiment with 
14- and 18-month-old children. Th e experimenter tasted two types of foods (e.g., 
crackers and broccoli), expressing delight about one of the foods and expressing 
disgust at the other. Th en, she placed her hand out and asked the participants to 
give her one more. Although older participants off ered the experimenter the food 
for which she expressed a preference, the younger participants off ered whichever 
food they preferred. Th ese results show that during the toddler years, children 
come to understand that another person may desire something (e.g., broccoli) 
that diff ers from one’s own preference (e.g., crackers). Th is represents a major 
achievement—the ability to reason about the unobservable psychology of another 
person (Repacholi & Gopnik, 1997; Wellman & Liu, 2004)—and has typically been 
viewed as the fi rst step in developing a ToM. Understanding of desires continues 
to mature throughout the preschool years. By 3 years of age (Wellman & Woolley, 
1990), children predict that another person will act in accordance with that per-
son’s desires (e.g., that someone who prefers to go swimming will choose to go to 
the pool rather than going to the park to play soccer), even if they confl ict with 

22 
foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
one’s own. However, the ability to predict that actions follow from desires appears 
to be hampered when the others’ desire is more distant from one’s own (e.g., when 
children are told that the other person prefers a clearly unattractive sticker over a 
clearly attractive one) (Moore, Jarrold, Russell, Lumb, Sapp, & MacCallum, 1995). 
Four-year-olds show a similar diffi  culty in predicting the emotions of story pro-
tagonists who receive their desired or undesired selections when those selections 
confl ict with the child’s own. It is not until age 5 that children consistently judge 
that others’ will be happy to receive their desired selection of a snack or a toy, even 
if it confl icts with the child’s own preference (Rieff e, Terwogt, Koops, Stegge, & 
Oomen, 2001). Th us, although children begin to understand the mental world 
of desires before their second birthday, more robust understanding of the role of 
desires in motivating behavior is not observed until much later in the preschool 
years. 
 Th e third major milestone in the development of ToM concerns children’s devel-
oping understanding of knowledge and belief (Sodian & Kristen, 2010; Wellman 
& Liu, 2004). Between the ages of 4 and 5 years, most children come to appreci-
ate that (a) in order to know something, a person must have had some kind of 
perceptual access to that information; (b) others may hold beliefs that diff er from 
one’s own; and (c) beliefs are mere approximations of reality and thus may be false 
(Wellman & Liu, 2004). 
 A rudimentary appreciation of the connection between perceiving and know-
ing likely begins to emerge during infancy (Flavell, 2004b; Onishi & Baillargeon, 
2005), and, by 3 years, children demonstrate a basic understanding that, in order to 
know something (e.g., what object is hidden inside a box), a person must have had 
access to that information (Pillow, 1989; Pratt & Bryant, 1990). However, in spite 
of such early beginnings, preschoolers persist in exhibiting striking limitations in 
their ability to reason about knowledge and belief. During the preschool years, 
dramatic developmental improvement is observed in children’s understanding 
about  how people come to acquire diff erent kinds of knowledge (e.g., information 
about the color vs. the weight of an object). Th ree-year-olds perform much more 
poorly than older children when they are asked to judge which puppet would 
know the appearance (or the texture) of a hidden object: the puppet who looked 
inside a tunnel or the puppet who felt inside the tunnel (O’Neill, Astington, & 
Flavell, 1992). Similar limitations are observed when young children are asked 
how they themselves came to acquire knowledge (e.g., via touching, seeing, or 
hearing an adult describe an object hidden in a box), even just a few moments 
aft er learning the information (O’Neill & Gopnik, 1991). Th is failure to encode 
the mode through which information was learned suggests that young preschool-
ers lack awareness of their ongoing mental operations, as well as an understanding 
of the function of diff erent perceptual operations. 
 In the later preschool years, children begin to appreciate that past experiences 
may infl uence individuals’ perceptions or beliefs about ambiguous stimuli or 
events. For example, many 4- and 5-year-old children report that a puppet who 
has only seen a small portion of a drawing will know what is in the drawing. In 
contrast, the majority of 6-year-olds correctly report that the puppet would not

Th e Development of Social Cognition in Th eory and Action 
23
know what is in the drawing, and would be likely to misinterpret it based on his 
or her previous experiences (Pillow & Henrichon, 1996). 
 Developmental changes are also observed between the ages of 3 and 5 in chil-
dren’s appreciation of their own previously incorrect beliefs. For example, Gopnik 
and Astington (1988) presented children with objects that appeared to be one 
thing (e.g., a rock) but in reality were another (e.g., a sponge). Aft er showing 
children the true nature of the objects, children were asked what they previously 
thought the object was, and what the object was really. Th e majority of 3-year-olds 
failed to report their previous belief (based on the appearance of the object—i.e., a 
rock), instead reporting on their current mental representation (of what the object 
was in reality—i.e., a sponge). In contrast, by age 5, the vast majority of children 
were able to report on their previous false mental representation of the objects. 
Th e passing of such a test marks a critical change in children’s understanding 
of the mental world: the conceptual understanding that mental representations 
are subjective approximations of reality, and that mental representations of the 
same object may diff er (between individuals or even between one’s own past and 
 current mental states). 
 Th is understanding is at the core of the last major milestone in ToM devel-
opment: the understanding of false belief. Th e false-belief task originated from 
the comparative psychology literature (Premack & Woodruff , 1978) as a thought 
experiment about what kind of a task would be suffi  cient to show that an individ-
ual understood the mental state of another. Th e basic premise of the false-belief 
task is as follows: An individual sees an object hidden in location A. When that 
individual is absent, the object is moved to location B. Th e participant is then 
prompted to predict where the individual will search for the object—in location 
A (where it was previously seen) or location B (where the object is really). If chil-
dren answer this question simply based on reasoning about the other’s desire to 
obtain the object, then they will say location B (i.e., where the character would 
have to look to fi nd the object). If children answer this question based on their 
own perspective of the situation, they will say location B (i.e., where the child 
knows the object to be located). Children will only give the correct search loca-
tion if they understand that the subject of the story has a diff erent mental state 
than their own, one that is based on subjective, limited, and, in this case, incorrect 
information. Wimmer and Perner (1983) were the fi rst to develop a human ver-
sion of this task and examined developmental changes in performance between 4 
and 9 years. In their version of the task, a boy puts his chocolate in one cupboard, 
but his mother moves it to another location while the boy is absent. When asked 
where the boy would search for his chocolate, half of the 4-year-old children failed 
this test, stating that the boy would look in the new location. In contrast, the vast 
majority of older children answered the question correctly, saying the boy would 
look for his chocolate where he last left  it. A meta-analysis of 178 studies using 
various versions of false-belief tasks showed that this pattern of developmental 
change is observed in across-task manipulations (e.g., whether the participant is 
involved in deceiving the story character or someone else is involved in moving 
the object) and in children with diff erent countries of origin (Wellman, Cross, 

24 
foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
& Watson, 2001). Taken together, these fi ndings suggest that the passing of the 
false-belief task marks an important conceptual change in children’s understand-
ing of the mental world and that this change typically occurs in the later preschool 
years. Experimental evidence indicates that children typically demonstrate com-
petence in reasoning about beliefs only aft er they demonstrate a competent ability 
to reason about desires (Wellman & Liu, 2004), and in naturalistic observations 
of children’s language development, words referring to desires (e.g., want) typi-
cally appear in speech before language referring to beliefs (e.g., think) (Bartsch & 
Wellman, 1995). 
 It is important to note, however, that recent infant research, using looking time 
as the dependent measure, has found evidence that infants as young as 15 months 
of age may have an implicit understanding of false belief (Onishi & Baillergeon, 
2005; Scott & Baillargeon, 2009; Song, Onishi, Baillargeon, & Fisher, 2008; Surian, 
Caldi, & Sperber, 2007). In the original study by Onishi and Baillargeon (2005), 
infants viewed adults acting out scenarios analogous to the false-belief task (i.e., 
watching an adult hide an object in location A, and, when the adult was absent, 
viewing the object being moved to location B). Infants looked longer when the 
adult searched in location B than when they searched in location A, suggest-
ing that the adults’ searching behavior violated their expectations (that the adult 
would search in location A, where the object was initially hidden). Like all infant 
data, diverse research groups have interpreted these fi ndings diff erently. Th e 
authors argued that these fi ndings suggest that even very young children under-
stand that others’ beliefs are based on their experiences and that beliefs may be 
false. More conservative interpretations have contended that perhaps lower-level 
associative processes can explain the results. For example, Ruff man and Perner 
(2005) countered that children may use a form of statistical learning to predict 
where others will search for objects (e.g., people typically look for an object in the 
location where it was last seen) rather than a higher-order mental attribution (e.g., 
the woman should search in location A because she does not know the object was 
moved to location B and instead thinks the object is in location A) (for a response, 
see Baillargeon, Scott, & He, 2010). Issues of interpretation aside, it is important 
to note that, like many other types of ToM reasoning, it appears that understand-
ing beliefs may have its roots in infancy and gradually develop over the course of 
the preschool years. 
 However, ToM development is  not complete at age 5. Subtle but important 
changes in children’s awareness and understanding of mental states continue 
throughout childhood and into adolescence. Around age 7, children develop 
 second-order ToM understanding , understanding that others (e.g., John) mentally 
represent what third parties (e.g., Mary) are thinking (Perner & Wimmer, 1985). 
Children’s understanding of faux pas and nonliteral meaning improves between 
ages 7 and 9 (Baron-Cohen et al., 1999; Creusere, 2000), although it is still not at 
ceiling levels of performance even at this age, thus suggesting that understanding 
the ways in which language relates to the mind of the speaker continues to improve 
throughout middle childhood. Using more complex visual perspective-taking 
tasks, developmental improvements in ToM reasoning have been observed into

adolescence (Dumontheil et al., 2010), and individual diff erences in the ability to 
reason about ToM are even observed in adults (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001; Birch & 
Bloom, 2007; Keysar, Lin, & Barr, 2003; Meins et al., 2003; Nickerson, 1999). 
 Hence, although false-belief understanding is oft en taken as the hallmark of 
having a ToM, social cognition requires understanding a much wider variety of 
mental states and processes, as well as how they are causally related to each other 
(Flavell, 2004b). Although the seeds of social understanding appear to sprout dur-
ing infancy, and substantial improvement in ToM is observed during the preschool 
years, full competence in understanding others’ mental states and processes is not 
observed until adolescence. 
 THEORIES OF THEORY OF MIND DEVELOPMENT 
 It is oft en noted that an understanding of mental states may be one of the more 
diffi  cult domains for young children to master because mental states cannot be 
directly observed (Wellman, 2002). Accordingly, much attention has been focused 
on elucidating the mechanisms that permit children to learn about the psycholog-
ical world and drive developmental changes in social cognition. 
 Th eories of ToM development can be categorized under two main classes: 
 domain-general accounts and  domain-specifi c accounts . Domain-general accounts 
posit that developmental improvements in children’s ability to reason about and 
attribute mental states to others are driven by broader improvements in children’s 
cognitive abilities. Th ese generalized improvements in cognition are thought 
to promote improvements in ToM understanding by equipping children with 
the basic skills needed to accurately reason about mental states. One prevalent 
domain-general account is that improvements in ToM are driven by improve-
ments in executive function, or children’s ability to consciously control their 
thoughts and actions (including improvements in inhibitory control, working 
memory, and attentional fl exibility). Correlational research indicates that indi-
vidual diff erences in executive function are robustly correlated with children’s 
false-belief understanding (Carlson & Moses, 2001). Th is relation may be at least 
partially due to the fact that successful performance on false-belief tasks requires 
that children  inhibit their own knowledge,  fl exibly shift  their attention to another 
character’s perspective, while  maintaining in working memory the conditions that 
the other character has experienced. Data from a recent study investigating the 
neural correlates of ToM reasoning are consistent with this notion. Liu and col-
leagues (Liu, Sabbagh, Gehring, & Wellman, 2009) recorded event-related poten-
tials (ERPs) while 4- to 6-year-old children and adults completed a false-belief 
task. During the task, participants were asked to reason about characters’ mis-
taken beliefs (false-belief trials) and to reason about the true location of a hid-
den object (control trials). Children who passed the false-belief tasks and adults 
(who also passed the tasks) showed a late slow wave over left  prefrontal cortex 
(which was greater for false-belief compared to control trials) in a region previ-
ously documented to be critically important for working memory. Children who 

26 
foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
failed the false-belief task did not exhibit ERP waveforms that diff erentiated the 
two trial types. Th us, there is some evidence to suggest that executive function 
skills (i.e., working memory) are necessary for children to be able to reason about 
the psychological states of others. 
 However, executive function skills are correlated with ToM performance even 
when the executive function demands of the false-belief task are reduced, thus 
suggesting that the correlation between executive function and ToM cannot fully 
be explained by task demands (Perner, Lang, & Kloo, 2002). It has alternatively 
been proposed that executive function skills may not simply help children to pass 
false-belief tasks; they may also help children to take advantage of interactions 
in their daily lives to learn about the psychological world. Th at is to say, children 
who have better executive function skills may be able to fl exibly shift  their atten-
tion and inhibit their own thoughts to take on the perspectives of others in their 
interactions with parents and peers. Practicing these skills may lead to better per-
formance on ToM as tested at later time points. Consistent with this proposal are 
the results of longitudinal research showing that executive function skills at age 2 
predict ToM at age 3 and age 4 (Hughes & Ensor, 2007), above and beyond earlier 
ToM skills and language ability. 
 A second domain-general account is that ToM development critically hinges 
on the development of representational understanding (Perner, 1991; Perner & 
Leekam, 2008). Th is account posits that, in order to reason about mental states 
(i.e.,  mental representations of the state of the world), children must have a general 
conceptual understanding of representation. Namely, children must understand 
that representations are meant to approximate reality, but they do not necessarily 
correspond to reality. To test this hypothesis, a false-sign task was developed as 
a non-mental analogue to the false-belief task. In this task, children are shown a 
drawing of a town, including a sign indicating that the ice cream truck has driven 
to a location behind the church. Participants are told that, later, the ice cream 
truck drives away from the church and over to the school, but the driver for-
gets to change the sign. Children are then asked, “Where does the sign say the 
ice-cream truck is?” As in the false-belief task, to answer the question correctly, 
children must set aside their knowledge of reality to reason about how the sign (a 
 physical  representation) represents the location of the object. Performance on this 
task correlates with performance on the standard false-belief task, suggesting a 
common source of diffi  culty (Perner & Leekam, 2008). Specifi cally, these fi ndings 
have been interpreted as showing that younger children’s inability to reason about 
mental representations is due to a general inability to appreciate that (physical or 
mental) representations of objects in the world may not correspond with reality. 
Only when children come to learn that a representation may be false (i.e., the ice 
cream truck is really in location B, but the sign says it is in location A) can they 
come to appreciate the subjective nature of mental representations. 
 A third domain-general account of ToM holds that language development 
plays a critical role in promoting ToM (Harris, 2006). As mental states cannot 
be directly observed, conversations with others (especially older siblings or par-
ents) may be a crucial inroad to learning about mental states. Consistent with

this notion are fi ndings from research with children who lack the ability to com-
municate with their parents in their early years (e.g., deaf children born to hear-
ing parents). Such children show signifi cant delays in ToM compared to children 
who are able to communicate with their parents from an early age (e.g., hear-
ing children or deaf children born to deaf parents; Meristo, Falkman, Hjelmuist, 
Tedoldi, Surian, & Siegal, 2007). Th ese delays are observed even when nonverbal 
ToM tasks are employed (Figueras-Costa & Harris, 2001), suggesting that it is 
not language per se that limits children’s ability to reason successfully on ToM 
tasks, but rather the opportunity to converse with others through language that 
facilitates the development of ToM. Further evidence consistent with this notion 
is research showing that maternal talk about the mind is correlated with children’s 
ToM ability concurrently (Moeller & Schick, 2006) and longitudinally (Ruff man, 
Slade, & Crowe, 2002). 
 Language may also play a critical role in the development of ToM by changing 
the way that children think about the world. In line with a Whorfi an hypoth-
esis, this domain-general account of ToM development posits that mastering 
more complex forms of syntax allows children to think in terms of conditional 
structures that are necessary to understand mental representations. For example, 
once children can use two clauses in conjunction with one another, they can then 
understand that Max thinks the chocolate is in cupboard X, but the chocolate 
is really in cupboard Y (Astington & Jenkins, 1999; Watson, Painter, Bornstein, 
2001). Evidence from a training study is consistent with this hypothesis. Lohmann 
and Tomasello (2003) randomly assigned 3-year-olds to one of several training 
conditions. In one condition, children were simply exposed to deceptive objects, 
such as those used in appearance reality tests, and their deceptive nature was 
revealed using minimal verbal input from the experimenter. In a second con-
dition, the experimenter discussed the objects using stories in which sentential 
complementary syntax was emphasized, but the deceptive nature of the objects 
was never revealed. In a third condition, both of these elements were combined. 
Th e sentential complement training condition, but not the simple exposure to the 
deceptive objects training, improved children’s performance on change of loca-
tion false-belief tasks. Moreover, individual diff erences in the improvement in 
comprehension of complex syntax predicted improvements in false-belief under-
standing, suggesting that developmental improvements with specifi c linguistic 
constructions may be critically important to children’s developing an ability to 
reason about the mental world. 
 A second class of accounts contends that developmental changes in ToM are 
due to changes specifi c to this domain. One of these views holds that reasoning 
about the psychological world is supported by a specialized system of knowing that 
comes online very early in life (Carey, 2009; Leslie, 2005). In essence, this perspec-
tive posits that infants are born with basic core knowledge about the social world 
(e.g., that humans and other animate beings are sentient and agentic, whereas 
objects are not). Th is core knowledge equips infants to (through their experiences 
and interactions with others) learn about the mental world. With this experi-
ence, core knowledge solidifi es and becomes more refi ned (Carey, 2009; Carey & 

28 
foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
Spelke, 1994). Support for this proposal comes from studies of social understand-
ing in very young children, including the fi ndings that 6-month-old infants view 
hands as acting with intention (Leslie, 1984), and Onishi and Baillargeon’s (2005) 
looking-time study of false-belief expectations in 15-month-old infants. Recent 
neuroimaging studies showing that there may be a specialized neural network 
involved in social reasoning (see Saxe, Carey, & Kanwisher [2004] for a review, 
and also Chapter 4 in this book) are also consistent with the proposal that ToM 
development may be driven by the maturation of a specialized ToM mechanism 
(Leslie, 2005). 
 An alternative domain-specifi c account posits that ToM development operates 
like the development of a scientifi c theory (Gopnik & Wellman, 1992; Wellman & 
Gelman, 1998). Th e “theory theory” of ToM development contends that children 
come to understand others’ minds by fi rst forming a folk hypothesis about why 
other people act the way that they do and then gathering additional information 
by observing others and adjusting their hypotheses based on this evidence. With 
development, these hypotheses are tested against the available evidence, tailored 
in ways that are responsive to the evidence, and bolstered into theories about the 
psychological motivations behind others’ behavior. Th us, the psychological world 
comes to be understood through a set of predictions and explanations about what 
might be operating in others’ minds based on an objectively derived understand-
ing of how internal states motivate behavior. Support for this proposal comes 
from a recent computational modeling study of the development of false-belief 
(Goodman et al., 2006), showing that children’s false-belief reasoning can be 
explained in terms of rational inferences. 
 In contrast, the simulation theory of ToM development holds that children 
come to learn about others’ mental activities by fi rst gaining an appreciation of 
their own mental states and reactions in diff erent situations. Th ey then use this 
insight to project mental states to others (Harris, 1992). From this perspective, 
children use their self-knowledge to predict how or why others act the way that 
they do (e.g., when I am in situation X and I do Y, it is because I feel Z. Since my 
brother is acting the same way in the same context, he probably also feels Z.) 
Support for this theory comes from research on pretend play and ToM develop-
ment. Specifi cally, individual diff erences in children’s engagement in role-playing 
with others is correlated with their ToM performance, but other kinds of play (e.g., 
solitary play) are not (Harris, 2000; Schwebel, Rosen, & Singer, 1999). Among 
other benefi ts, these experiences may provide children with the opportunity to 
practice taking on other roles and the opportunity to observe how others’ behav-
ior diff ers when they have taken on a given perspective (Lillard, 2001), thus lead-
ing to an enhanced ability to simulate the minds of others in the real world. 
 Th e questions of which account best specifi es the initial state, which account 
best explains sequential changes, and which account best characterizes the learn-
ing mechanisms involved is a topic of active debate. For example, it is likely that 
numerous sociocultural factors contribute to the development of ToM, as well as 
to maturationally specifi ed developments of the brain. Th us, elements of many of 
the theories discussed likely contribute to the development of social cognition.

Elucidating the unique contribution of each factor and how each operates in con-
junction with one another is a critical task for ongoing and future research. 
 THEORY OF MIND IN ACTION 
 Much of what developmental scientists have learned about ToM development 
comes from studies of children (or adolescents) predicting the beliefs, emotions, 
or actions of characters in stories. Although the experimental control aff orded 
by this approach allows us to elucidate the mental states that children of diff erent 
ages can or cannot appreciate, it provides little information about how children 
develop the ability to use their understanding of the psychological world in their 
social interactions. Th us, there is a growing interest in understanding the pro-
cesses through which children’s developing understanding of the psychological 
world gives rise to changes in their behavior. 
 Some have argued that even infants use social understanding to guide their 
responding in the context of communication. During the fi rst year of life, infants 
begin to follow others’ gazes, looking to the location where parents or other 
adults are looking (Brooks & Meltzoff , 2005; Hood, Willen, & Driver, 1998; 
Farroni, Csibra, Simion, & Johnson, 2002; Flavell, 2004b). By 10 months of age, 
they begin to do so more discriminately, only shift ing their gaze when the experi-
menter’s eyes are open, but not when the experimenter’s eyes are closed (Brooks & 
Meltzoff , 2005). By 12 months of age, infants will physically change their position 
in order to see an object that they currently cannot see when an experimenter 
expresses interest in it, suggesting that, at this young age, even infants appreciate 
that the experimenter is viewing something of interest (Moll & Tomasello, 2004; 
Tomasello & Haberl, 2003). Around 12 months of age, infants also engage in 
social referencing—looking to their caregivers when they are faced with novel 
or potentially threatening situations. For example, when infants are placed on a 
visual cliff  (a glass-topped table that appears to have a deep drop), infants look 
to their mothers (on the other side of the table) and respond in accordance with 
the mother’s emotional expression (e.g., crossing the table when positive emo-
tions are expressed and avoiding crossing the table when negative emotions 
are expressed) (Klinnert, Emde, Butterfi eld, & Campos, 1986; Vaish & Striano, 
2004). 
 Some have interpreted these behaviors richly, arguing that they show that very 
young children appreciate the ongoing mental intentions and beliefs of others, 
whereas others have argued for a much leaner interpretation of these behaviors, 
suggesting that these early behaviors are driven by more bottom-up factors (e.g., 
learning that others’ eyes are oft en directed at interesting or important stimuli, or 
that when infants feel afraid, they seek contact with their caregivers). Although 
further research is needed to clarify the capacities that motivate and explain early 
social communication, these interactions no doubt provide an important founda-
tion for children’s learning about the psychological world and the mental states of 
others (Flavell, 2004b). 

30 
foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
 Early understanding of the mental world also appears to be critically important 
to learning. Specifi cally, appreciating that gaze indicates attention may be crucial 
to the ability to map words onto objects. Experimental evidence shows that when 
infants hear a novel label from an adult, they attach that label to the object at which 
the adult was looking, rather than to the object that captured the infant’s attention 
(Baldwin, 1991; Baldwin & Moses, 2001; Woodward & Markman, 1998). Indeed, 
infants who exhibit more advanced social competence in these early markers of 
social understanding (e.g., gaze following) showcase advantages in early vocabu-
lary acquisition, being better able to identify which object an adult is labeling 
(Brooks & Meltzoff , 2005; Morales, Mundy, & Rojas, 1998). Th us, the ability to 
attend to and engage in social interactions with others appears to facilitate early 
learning. 
 Th e evaluation of speakers’ mental states likely continues to infl uence word 
learning in later periods as well. In particular, as young children begin to under-
stand the conditions that lead to knowledge, they become more discriminating 
in when, and from whom, they accept word labels. For example, in one study, 
when a speaker expressed doubt about what a novel object was called, 3- and 
4-year-olds were much less likely to learn a novel object’s label compared to when 
that speaker expressed knowledge and certainty about what a novel object was 
called (Sabbagh & Baldwin, 2001). Four-year-olds were also more likely to learn 
the labels for novel objects when the speaker had created the object, compared 
to when someone else created it, suggesting a rather sophisticated appreciation 
of the speaker’s knowledge about the object. In contrast, 3-year-olds failed to dif-
ferentiate between these instances. 
 Developing an understanding of the psychological world does not simply allow 
children to learn about the transient mental states of others, such as perceptually 
based beliefs and intentions. It should also aff ord them ability to reason about 
more stable diff erences in other people’s knowledge or expertise (Heyman, 2008; 
Koenig & Harris, 2005a; Lutz & Keil, 2002). Tracking stable diff erences in oth-
ers’ competence and using this knowledge to decide whether one should trust 
them, and in what contexts, is therefore critically important (Koenig & Harris, 
2005b). For example, biology teachers typically know more about science than 
do math teachers, parents know more about family history than do friends, and 
Dutch speakers know Dutch words whereas English speakers do not. Children 
and adults rely on the testimony of others for much of what they know about the 
world and, given this dependence, should evaluate the expertise of others in order 
to know when these others are likely to be off ering a competent, informed judg-
ment as opposed to a biased or misinformed one (e.g., Keil, 2006, 2008). 
 Recent evidence suggests that children show considerable sophistication in their 
eff orts to evaluate people as potential sources of information. Not only do chil-
dren prefer to learn from reliable more than from less-reliable individuals (Birch, 
Vauthier, & Bloom, 2008; Jaswal & Neely, 2006; Koenig & Harris, 2005a,b; Sabbagh 
& Baldwin, 2001), they form enduring profi les of an informant’s prior accuracy 
and continue to use this information when evaluating new testimony aft er a week 
has passed (Corriveau & Harris, 2009). Th e ability to use an individual’s epistemic

reliability to guide learning and imitation appears to be an early emerging com-
petence (Birch, Akmal, & Frampton, 2010; Chow, Poulin-Dubois, & Lewis, 2008; 
Koenig & Woodward, 2010; Poulin-Dubois & Chow, 2009). By age 4, children 
monitor the relative magnitude of a person’s errors and assess incorrect infor-
mation for “how wrong” it is (Einav & Robinson, 2010). Furthermore, children 
are capable of revising their judgments in light of new evidence bearing on an 
individual’s reliability (Scofi eld & Behrend, 2008) and, by 4 years of age, monitor 
the relative frequency of errors made by two informants (Pasquini, Corriveau, 
Koenig, & Harris, 2007). Th is line of research thus documents a general com-
petence that infants and young children display when learning from others and 
indicates an early sensitivity to an impressive range of cues used to make these 
selective judgments. 
 Children’s ability to attend to the competence of a source and avoid those that 
seem misinformed or ignorant has obvious epistemic advantages in that it helps 
children manage the risks of misinformation. However, the potential problems 
of communicated information may not simply arise from the incompetence of 
others, but also from their interests and their (dis)honesty. One recent study 
(Vanderbilt, Liu, & Heyman, 2011) found that 3-year-olds readily trusted the 
advice of a puppet (about where to search for a sticker) that had previously been 
helpful and also readily trusted a puppet that had previously been tricky (provid-
ing children with wrong information). Four-year-olds were less trusting overall 
but still failed to diff erentiate between the previously helpful versus tricky infor-
mant. Only 5-year-olds were signifi cantly more likely to trust the information 
provided by the helpful puppet. Th e diff erence in selective trusting was associated 
with children’s ToM understanding (as measured via the 2004 battery developed 
by Wellman and Liu), thus suggesting that children’s developing understanding 
of the psychological world facilitates their ability to reason about the more stable 
mental intentions and likely actions of others. 
 Th e ability to track and detect diff erences in informants appears to emerge 
even earlier in the context of more conventional tasks, in which young children 
have more a priori knowledge to use when evaluating the reliability of others. For 
example, on novel word learning tasks, children as young as 24 months are more 
likely to accept novel labels from speakers who have previously labeled common 
objects correctly (e.g., labeling a shoe as “shoe”) than from speakers who have 
previously labeled common objects incorrectly (e.g., labeling a shoe as “boat”) 
(Koenig & Woodward, 2010; see also Poulin-Dubois & Chow, 2009). Th e ten-
dency to selectively trust informants based on their accuracy appears to be related 
to children’s ability to explicitly track diff erences in the quality of an informant. 
For example, Koenig, Cl é ment, and Harris (2004) found that children who were 
able to report which of two speakers said the right things and which of two speak-
ers said the wrong things systematically accepted novel labels from the more reli-
able speaker to a greater degree. Children who could not report on this diff erence 
performed at chance levels. Th us, it appears that when children are able to track 
a speaker’s past reliability, they use this insight to determine whether that indi-
vidual should be trusted. 

32 
foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
 However, to truly show that selective trust is based on understanding of diff er-
ences in knowledge, expertise, or intentions, it is necessary to rule out the pos-
sibility that children are using a lower level cue, such as avoiding any speaker 
who says something incorrect. Although some evidence of a halo eff ect has been 
observed in children (5-year-olds judge previously accurate speakers as being 
more knowledgeable about words, general facts, and being nicer in future sce-
narios than previously inaccurate speakers), this eff ect does not generalize to all 
domains (such as talents, preferences, or situation-specifi c knowledge), suggest-
ing that a discriminate extension of trust is observed in children (Brosseau-Liard 
& Birch, 2010). More recently, Koenig and Jaswal (2011) found evidence that pre-
schoolers were not more likely to trust an expert outside of his or her domain of 
expertise (e.g., a dog expert labeling novel objects) compared to a neutral infor-
mant, consistent with the notion that preschoolers are not overly general in their 
positive attributions of knowledge to a previously accurate informant. However, 
a second experiment found that when children were told about a speaker who 
was incompetent at naming dogs, their distrust of this speaker generalized to 
other domains. Th us, although children did not overattribute knowledge to a dog 
expert, there appeared to be a “pitchfork eff ect,” such that children discounted 
information across domains from an incompetent source. Th ese fi ndings suggest 
that when judging what someone else is likely to know (or not know), the scope of 
children’s inferences diff er depending on whether the individual showed herself 
to be knowledgeable or incompetent. 
 Of course, mature reasoning about psychological traits must also take the context 
into consideration, including situational factors that may limit a person’s ability to 
exhibit his or her knowledge or expertise. Preschoolers appear to take into account 
the situational factors that may constrain an individual’s ability to provide accurate 
information (Nurmsoo & Robinson, 2009; Robinson & Whitcombe, 2003). Th ree- 
to fi ve-year-olds preferentially trust a knowledgeable informant, but only when 
that informant has the ability to select his or her response willingly. For example, 
Kushnir, Gelman, and Wellman (2008) presented preschoolers with informants 
who were either knowledgeable about how a toy worked (i.e., who had played with 
the toy before and who knew which blocks made the toy light up) or an ignorant 
informant (who had not previously played with the toy). Preschoolers trusted the 
knowledgeable informant’s selection of a block more frequently than the ignorant 
informant’s selection; however, no preference was observed when the knowledge-
able informant was blindfolded and therefore could not purposefully select that 
block. In other research, preschoolers have been found to consider whether infor-
mants’ errors could be explained by the presence of physical constraints (e.g., the 
person had to label an object when they were blindfolded; Nurmsoo & Robinson, 
2009), suggesting that preschoolers consider a number of causally-related cues 
when determining how to extend their trust (Koenig, 2010). 
 Children’s developing understanding of the psychological world likely becomes 
increasingly important as their social networks expand and they begin to form 
relationships with peers. Correlational research indicates that young chil-
dren (preschoolers and kindergartners) who are more advanced in their ToM

understanding are rated by their teachers as having better social skills and higher 
popularity (Cassidy, Werner, Rourke, Zubernis, & Balaraman, 2003; Watson, 
Nixon, Wilson, & Capage, 1999), and preadolescents who have better scores on 
tests of social understanding are rated by their teachers and peers as being more 
socially competent (Bosacki & Astington, 1999). 
 Although increased social understanding has generally been linked with 
reduced aggression (Dodge & Crick, 1990), greater insight into how one’s actions 
will aff ect others may also facilitate actions aimed at harming or deceiving others 
(Arsenio & Lemerise, 2001). Th eory-of-mind skills are associated with  increased 
proactive aggression in early elementary school-aged children who have been vic-
timized by their peers (Renouf, Brendgen, S é guin, Vitar, Boivin, & Dionne, 2010), 
and in older children, some subtypes of bullying have been linked to increased 
social cognition skills (Sutton, Smith, & Swettenham, 1999). Th us, there appears 
to be a complex interaction between social cognition and children’s peer relations: 
Children who have diffi  culty understanding others may be more prone to misun-
derstand the intentions of others, perhaps leading to a tendency to respond with 
inappropriate levels of aggression. Children who are more adept at understanding 
others may generally have more positive interactions with their peers, leading 
to reductions in the tendency to respond aggressively. However, when socially 
competent children do decide to respond aggressively, they may be able to infl ict 
greater harm because they have a better understanding of their peers’ underlying 
thoughts, emotions, and motivations, and hence may be better able to “push their 
buttons.” 
 Competence with deception is oft en viewed as a developmental achievement 
since, to tell lies eff ectively, children need to take into account the mental states of 
listeners while appreciating that the goal of lying is to intentionally create a false 
belief in the mind of another (Sodian, 1991). Both producing and comprehend-
ing acts of deception undergo change in the preschool years (Carlson, Moses, & 
Hix, 1998; Couillard & Woodward, 1999; Jaswal, Carrington Croft , Setia, & Cole, 
2011; Russell, Mauthner, Sharpe, & Tidswell, 1991). Lying about a transgression 
increases between ages 3 and 5, and the lies that children tell become increasingly 
sophisticated and consistent with the evidence of their transgressions during this 
period. Th ese improvements are associated with improved ToM and executive 
function skills (Evans, Xu, & Lee, 2011). In research with older children, individual 
diff erences in the ability to eff ectively lie (i.e., to tell a story and answer questions 
consistent with one’s previous lie) are associated with individual diff erences in sec-
ond-order ToM ability (Talwar, Gordon, & Lee, 2007). Th us, as children become 
increasingly expert in the psychological world, they become increasingly able to use 
this knowledge to their advantage (for benevolent or more nefarious purposes).  
 CONCLUSION 
 Understanding of the social world begins to emerge during the fi rst year of life, 
improves rapidly during the fi rst 5 years, and continues to develop through 

34 
foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
childhood and into adolescence. Age-related improvements in knowledge about 
the psychological world and in the ability to reason online about other people’s 
intentions, desires, perspectives, and beliefs may be driven by a host of factors, 
including improvements in executive function, language, and conceptual under-
standing of representation. 
 Future research is needed to elucidate the specifi c contributions of each of these 
factors and how they may interact with more domain-specifi c mechanisms of 
social cognition, the formation of reasoned theories about psychological mecha-
nisms, and the simulation of mental states. Doing so will provide key insight into 
the forces that shape typically developing individuals’ understanding of the psy-
chological world and the infl uences that may cause typical development to go 
awry. 
 Much has been learned about the development of children’s ability to predict 
how characters in stories will think, feel, or act. Less is known about children’s 
ability to use this insight online in their interactions with others. Recent research 
suggests that the development of social cognition may be critically important to 
learning and the quality of peer relations. Continuing this line of work in future 
research that investigates how children’s developing knowledge of the psychologi-
cal world infl uences their behavior in their social interactions with others may 
provide critical new insight into the consequences of atypical social cognition and 
how to intervene to improve social functioning in a wide range of individuals.

 Social Cognition 
Social Psychological Insights from Normal Adults  
 K R I S T J E N    L U N D B E R G  ■ 
 Normal adults oft en have diffi  culty navigating a complex social world. Perhaps 
we have looked foolish at the offi  ce because we misinterpreted a co-worker’s care-
less error as an action involving malicious intent, or perhaps we have mistakenly 
inferred that a stranger’s haste in ending a conversation with us in a supermar-
ket checkout line was evidence for extreme dislike. Th e cognitive, emotional, and 
behavioral processes by which people come to understand themselves and others 
in the social world is known as  social cognition . Th e study of social cognition orig-
inated within social psychology during the general “cognitive revolution” (Sperry, 
1993) of the 1960s and early 1970s. Social cognition as a construct within social 
psychology is used to describe a generalized, broad theoretical paradigm focusing 
on how people process information within social contexts. It includes many spe-
cifi c topics, such as person perception, making causal attributions about self and 
others, arriving at social judgments, and the dynamics of decision making, among 
numerous other topics (Augoustinos, Walker, & Donaghue, 2006; Fiske & Taylor, 
2008; Kunda, 1999; Moskowitz, 2005; Smith & Semin, 2004). Th ese social cogni-
tive operations may occur at automatic or controlled levels of processing and may 
be further infl uenced by various motivational biases (Chaiken & Trope, 1999). 
 Potential diffi  culties in understanding the social world are compounded in 
patients with schizophrenia, who experience several social cognitive defi cits. 
Th us, it is perhaps unsurprising that both social psychologists and schizophrenia 
researchers, each with interests in people’s functioning relative to other people 
in the social world, have arrived at the common conclusion that social cognition 
is of critical importance. Th e purpose of this chapter is to briefl y describe some 
areas of social cognition research conducted by social psychologists, primarily 
using normal adults, with an eye toward providing insights that may be valuable 
to schizophrenia researchers. In the fi rst section, I suggest that social psycholo-
gists and schizophrenia researchers may be defi ning social cognition slightly dif-
ferently, and I outline four characteristics of social cognition as viewed by social 
psychologists. Recognizing these diff erences may help lessen potential confusion. 

42 
foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
In the second section, I describe social psychological social cognition research 
on topics that have been of interest to schizophrenia researchers, namely, attribu-
tion biases, emotion processing, social perception, and theory of mind (ToM). 
My second suggestion is that, even within these topics, other phenomena studied 
by social psychologists in greater depth also may be usefully examined by schizo-
phrenia researchers. Discussion of these phenomena may further enlighten what 
is known about the disorder. In the last section, I draw some conclusions and off er 
additional speculations for future research. My fi nal suggestion is that a wider 
breadth of social cognition topics studied by social psychologists may be relevant 
to schizophrenia researchers but have thus far received relatively less attention. 
 DIFFERING DEFINITIONS OF SOCIAL COGNITION 
 It is useful to note at the outset that social psychologists and schizophrenia 
researchers appear to defi ne the construct of social cognition in slightly diff er-
ent ways. For schizophrenia researchers, social cognition is used more commonly 
to defi ne particular types of social processing, such as the ability to draw causal 
inferences, process emotions, understand others’ actions, and take another’s per-
spective (Green & Horan, 2010). For social psychologists, in contrast, social cog-
nition is seen as more of a general paradigm or perspective from which to conduct 
psychological research (Carlston, 2010; also see Sherman, Judd, & Park, 1989). 
Although commonalities exist between the two perspectives (e.g., interests in per-
son perception and causal inferences), for social psychologists, social cognition is 
not a specifi c topic area of investigation per se, but rather an approach to doing 
research that can be used to investigate a wide variety of topic areas (Augoustinos 
et al., 2006; Smith & Semin, 2004). What characterizes social cognition for social 
psychologists? According to Fiske and Taylor (2008), there are four common 
features to social cognition research: unabashed mentalism, process orientation, 
interdisciplinary cross-fertilization, and real-world applications. 
 Unabashed Mentalism 
 Th e fi rst feature is what Fiske and Taylor (2008) term “unabashed mentalism,” a 
focus on people’s mental representations, such as  schemas . Schemas are organized 
sets of ideas, such as a person’s conceptualization of him- or herself, attitudes and 
beliefs concerning racial groups, or notions about the physical properties of the 
external world. Once schemas are activated and accessible, they have far-reaching 
consequences, such as when inferring whether someone is a threat or when decid-
ing whether to continue a romantic relationship. Th is mentalism contrasts, for 
example, with the behaviorist tradition of dismissing internal mental states as a 
topic of study (Watson, 1930; Skinner, 1963; Th orndike, 1940). In this sense, social 
cognition stems from social psychology’s historically “cognitive” focus, exempli-
fi ed in the classic works of Asch (1946) on trait-based impressions, Hovland and 
www.ebook3000.com

colleagues on attitude change (Hovland, Janis, & Kelley, 1953), and Festinger 
(1957) on cognitive dissonance. Th is broader rejection within social psychology 
of behaviorism’s antimentalist approach was met with a groundswell of inter-
est in the study of cognitive processes, as well as with a new set of methods and 
metaphors (e.g., the brain as a computer) borrowed from cognitive psychology. 
Th is confl uence of factors endowed social cognitive researchers with opportuni-
ties to open the “black box” and explore not only the contents of the mind, but 
also thinking and reasoning processes themselves (e.g., attention, encoding, and 
memory), as well as their impact on behavior. 
 Process Orientation 
 A second feature is that social cognition is  process oriented . From a social cog-
nitive perspective, examining cognitive processes is of pivotal importance. It is 
not enough to know a person’s response to a stimulus, but rather one must also 
know the underlying mechanism by which the person arrived at that response. 
Sometimes these evaluations and responses occur quite automatically, with 
little conscious deliberation or intention, whereas, at other times, evaluations 
and responses occur in a more deliberative, controlled fashion. Th is distinction 
between automatic and controlled processing has become one of the main theo-
retical perspectives in social cognition research.  Automatic processes are generally 
defi ned as unintentional, uncontrollable, effi  cient, and occurring largely outside of 
conscious awareness, whereas  controlled processes are generally defi ned as inten-
tional, controllable, eff ortful, and conscious (for reviews see Chaiken & Trope, 
1999; Fiske & Taylor, 2008). 
 Social cognition research has become heavily informed by advances in under-
standing automatic and oft en  implicit  processes, with an emphasis on rapid, 
unconscious reactions to environmental stimuli of which people may not be aware 
(Bargh, 1994). Researchers have utilized and adapted increasingly sophisticated 
methods ranging from reaction timing to brain imaging to assess the impact of 
automatic cognitive processes on evaluative and behavioral responses (Cacioppo 
et al., 2002). In particular, social cognition researchers have developed a variety 
of “implicit” measures to examine automatic associations between attitudes and 
behaviors (Fazio & Olson, 2003; see also Gawronski & Payne, 2010). Because such 
measures do not require conscious introspection and are designed to capture 
automatic responses, they may provide information that explicit measures can-
not. For example, although explicit expressions of prejudice against blacks may 
not always be observed publicly (Bobo, 2001), the persistence of racial dispari-
ties would lead many to doubt that prejudice itself has disappeared. Instead, indi-
viduals simply may be unable or unwilling to report their automatic evaluative 
responses. Measures of implicit attitudes (e.g., the aff ect misattribution procedure 
[AMP; Payne, Cheng, Govorun, & Stewart, 2005], the Implicit Association Test 
[IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998]) have been used to address these 
limitations, and have been shown to be predictive of a diverse range of outcome 

44 
foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
measures, such as less friendly nonverbal behavior in intergroup interactions 
(e.g., Dovidio, Kawakami, & Gaertner, 2002) and biased judgments in social per-
ception and judgment (e.g., Gawronski, Geschke, & Banse, 2003; Lambert, Payne, 
Ramsey, & Schaff er, 2005). 
 Th e fact that people with schizophrenia typically have defi cits in important 
domains of controlled processing, such as executive functioning, may lead them 
to overly rely on automatic information processing (e.g., “environmental depen-
dency”; Lhermitte, 1986; Velligan et al., 2008, 2009). Th us, distinctions between 
automatic and controlled processes in producing evaluative and behavioral out-
comes may be of particular interest to schizophrenia researchers. Indeed, as 
evidence for this interest, some schizophrenia researchers already have begun 
adopting implicit measures to assess constructs such as implicit self-esteem and 
attentional biases in schizophrenia samples (for a review, see Teachman, Cody, & 
Clerkin, 2010). 
 Interdisciplinary Cross-Fertilization 
 Th ird, social cognition is characterized by interdisciplinary approaches and  cross-
fertilization  of ideas. Not only is there an obvious melding of social with traditional 
cognitive psychology but also a melding with other fi elds, such as developmental 
psychology, clinical psychology, and neuroscience. For example, neuroscientifi c 
approaches have found that specifi c brain regions are activated in response to 
social decision making (see Jimenez et al. [2013], Chapter 4, this volume). Th e 
striatum, which is active for basic rewards, also is involved in encoding more 
abstract social rewards, such as positive feelings produced by mutual cooperation 
(Sanfey, 2007). Interdisciplinary cross-fertilization is particularly evident between 
social and clinical psychology. Th e last three decades have witnessed a burgeoning 
interest in applying social psychological concepts to better understand, diagnose, 
and treat emotional and behavioral problems; in using the study of clinical phe-
nomena to inform our understanding of intra- and interpersonal processes in 
healthy populations; and in uncovering the underlying mechanisms of constructs 
that are of common interdisciplinary interest (e.g., subjective well-being, self-
esteem; see Kowalski & Leary, 2003). Th is current book is itself testament to the 
interdisciplinary cross-fertilization between social and clinical psychology, with 
schizophrenia researchers adopting the construct of social cognition in order to 
better understand the nature of the disorder, and to inform treatments to improve 
functional outcomes for people with schizophrenia. 
 Real-World Applications 
 Finally, social cognition researchers are concerned with  real-world applications . 
One particularly interesting example of such application is that social cognition 
research has been used to inform legal decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court (Fiske, 
www.ebook3000.com

Social Cognition 
45
Bersoff , Borgida, Deaux, & Heilman, 1991). Researchers have been called upon as 
expert witnesses to testify to the antecedent conditions, indicators, consequences, 
and remedies of stereotyping, with testimony infl uencing the outcomes in preju-
dice and discrimination cases. Although it may be commonplace for schizophrenia 
researchers to be concerned with real-world applications, particularly those who 
are involved in clinical practice, real-world applications are not always of concern 
for many psychological researchers, particularly those with cognitive leanings, 
who instead may be more interested in theory-building. Such a lack of concern for 
real-world applications is  not generally the case for social cognition researchers. 
Interest in real-world applications from both social cognition and schizophrenia 
researchers can thus augment and inform both areas. Schizophrenia researchers 
can employ the theories, ideas, and methods of social cognition to better under-
stand the disorder, and social psychologists might better understand limitations 
to their theorizing in learning what goes wrong when severe social cognitive defi -
cits lead judgments astray. 
 Summary 
 Although commonalties exist between perspectives, social psychologists and 
schizophrenia researchers may be using the construct of social cognition in slightly 
diff erent ways. For social psychologists, social cognition is not a specifi c topic (or 
set of topics) of investigation per se, but instead encompasses a broader way of 
thinking about and doing research, characterized by unabashed mentalism, pro-
cess orientation, interdisciplinary cross-fertilization, and concern for real-world 
applications. Schizophrenia researchers, in contrast, more oft en use the construct 
of social cognition to study specifi c abilities and processes that are problematic for 
people with this disorder. Recognizing this distinction at the outset may help to 
diminish potential confusion that may result among social psychologists, schizo-
phrenia researchers, and others when discussing what is meant by the term  social 
cognition (see also Green et al., 2008). 
 INCREASING DEPTH OF TOPICS 
IN SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH 
 Researchers interested in utilizing a social cognition approach to better under-
stand and treat schizophrenia have consistently identifi ed four topics of primary 
interest: attribution biases, emotion processing, social perception, and theory of 
mind (ToM) (e.g., Green et al., 2008). Social psychologists also have long-standing 
interests in these topics, but with a somewhat increased depth of perspective. By 
discussing social cognition research related to these four topics from a social 
psychological perspective, I suggest that even within topics already of interest 
to schizophrenia researchers there are other phenomena that may be worthy of 
examination. I note that the categories of research described in this section are not 

46 
foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, making causal attributions (attribu-
tion biases) can involve inferring others’ emotions (emotion processing), and this 
inference may aff ect how others are perceived (social perception). 
 Attribution Biases 
 As described in the opening examples of this chapter, we have all made mistakes 
when inferring the causes of our own as well as other people’s behaviors. Inferring 
causes is known as making  causal attributions . For example, imagine you are driv-
ing down the highway in bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffi  c and you are forced 
suddenly to slam on the brakes because a shiny silver sports car cuts directly in 
front of you. Why did this driver do this? Was she unaware that that you were 
behind her? Was she trying to avoid an encroaching car in another lane? Or, was 
she simply a reckless jerk? Countless times a day, we are confronted with events 
such as these that beg for explanations, events that prompt us to ask (and to 
answer) the question:  Why? Th e importance of making causal attributions lies in 
the fact that subjectively diff erent answers to “why” questions, despite objectively 
similar actions (e.g., getting cut-off  in traffi  c), can evoke very diff erent responses. 
Th at is, if we had inferred that the driver of the sports car just did not see us or was 
avoiding another automobile, then we might more readily excuse the behavior, 
although it does not change it. However, if we had instead inferred that the driver 
was simply a reckless jerk rushing home from work, endangering our life without 
concern, then the response evoked may be one of anger, rage, or even retaliation. 
 But we are not even-handed when making causal attributions. Decades of social 
psychological research have shown that people are consistently biased in mak-
ing attributions. Generally, we are more likely to infer causality as being due to 
another’s internal dispositions (e.g., personality, attitudes, or traits). Th is tendency 
is known as the  correspondence bias or, because it is so pervasive, the  fundamental 
attribution error  (Ross, 1977; see also Ross, Amabile, & Steinmetz, 1977; Snyder & 
Frankel, 1976). Although present in normal adults, this bias in attributing causal 
fault to people’s internal qualities may be taken to extremes in some people with 
schizophrenia. For example, some people with schizophrenia may have a paranoid 
or hostile attributional bias, whereby they see mainly negative qualities in other 
people. Alternatively, people with schizophrenia who are experiencing self-stigma 
or comorbid depression may be biased toward attributing negative social events 
to their own failings. 
 To fully understand attribution biases, one must understand the processes by 
which people make attributions in the fi rst place. Within social psychology, the 
genesis of attribution theory is considered to lie in Fritz Heider’s (1958) classic 
book,  Th e Psychology of Interpersonal Relations . Among Heider’s numerous con-
tributions was the distinction between attributions made to the actor’s personality 
or disposition (i.e.,  internal attributions) versus those made to the situation (i.e., 
 external  attributions). As early as 1944, Heider foreshadowed the correspondence 
bias, noting that, although “changes in the environment are almost always caused

47
by acts of persons in combination with other factors, the tendency exists to ascribe 
the changes  entirely to persons ” (1944, p. 361, emphasis added). Th e bias toward 
internal, dispositional attributions was echoed and formalized in the subsequent 
theorizing of Kelley’s (1967, 1972, 1973) covariation model and Jones and Davis’s 
(1965) correspondent inference theory. 
 According to Kelley, an observer will use three types of information to deter-
mine the cause of another person’s (i.e., the actor’s) behavior. Th e fi rst,  consensus , 
refers to the extent to which other actors respond in the same way to the same 
stimulus (i.e., person or situation). Th e second,  distinctiveness , refers to the extent 
to which the actor has responded in a unique way to this particular stimulus. And 
the fi nal piece of information,  consistency , refers to the extent to which the same 
actor responds in the same way to the same stimulus over time. For example, 
imagine a situation in which you and your friend Robert attend a party together, 
but then Robert spends the entire night talking to everyone except you. Why did 
Robert ignore you? How might you explain his behavior? According to Kelley’s 
model, you will look for three specifi c pieces of evidence and draw your conclu-
sion on the basis of the particular pattern you fi nd. For instance, if this situation 
has low consensus (no one else ignores you at parties), low distinctiveness (Robert 
has been known to do such things to other people besides you), and high consis-
tency (Robert always ignores you at parties), then you might conclude that the 
action is due to Robert’s disposition (e.g., perhaps he is not very considerate) (see 
also McArthur, 1972). 
 Jones and Davis (1965), in their correspondent inference theory, likewise 
focused on the extent to which observers’ attributions are made to internal or 
external factors. Th e default assumption was that observers normally infer that 
an actor’s behavior corresponds to her or his stable personality traits—hence the 
name correspondent inference—unless other information overrides this assump-
tion. Jones and Davis identifi ed several factors that may lead an observer to be 
more or less likely to make an internal attribution, including: (a) how desirable 
the consequences of the behavior are (i.e., if an outcome is desirable to the actor, 
it is more likely that an internal attribution will be made), (b) what is unique or 
non-normative about the action compared to alternatives that the actor did not 
pursue (i.e., if it is unique or non-normative, it is more likely that an internal attri-
bution will be made), and (c) the hedonic relevance of the action to the actor (i.e., 
if it is seen as promoting the goals of the actor, it is more likely that an internal 
attribution will be made). As an example, imagine that a candidate were to send 
you an e-mail of thanks following a job interview. To the extent that this behavior 
is standard for job candidates (i.e., normative), you would likely attribute the act 
of doing so to social norms and not infer anything particular about the disposi-
tion of the actor. However, if the job candidate were to deliver a handwritten note 
of thanks, whether you view the action as very thoughtful or a bit obsequious, you 
are likely to infer that the candidate’s disposition is the cause, rather than attribut-
ing the behavior to social norms. 
 Formal social psychological models of attribution, such as Kelley’s covariation 
model and Jones and Davis’s correspondent inference theory, could be of value 

48 
foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
to schizophrenia researchers who study attribution biases. For example, perhaps 
patients with schizophrenia are unable to use consensus, distinctiveness, and con-
sistency information in the way that healthy adults do, and as Kelley’s attribu-
tion model would predict. Similarly, it may be that patients with schizophrenia 
severely fail to adjust for situational factors when determining the causes of peo-
ple’s actions, particularly when actions have perceived negative consequences, and 
are more likely to arrive at dispositional inferences—an extreme version of Jones 
and Davis’s predictions. Compounding these possibilities is that one main reason 
why normal adults oft en fall prey to a bias toward internal attributions is simply 
because it is easier to make such inferences, whereas it requires more cognitive 
eff ort to take situational factors into account (Gilbert, 1989; Gilbert, Pelham, & 
Krull, 1988). Because patients with schizophrenia have cognitive processing defi -
cits, these patients may be particularly prone to making internal attributions rela-
tive to normal adults. Th is possibility could help to explain some of the attribution 
biases exhibited by patients with schizophrenia and suggests that treatments to 
improve attributional bias may need to address the issue of cognitive defi cits. 
 Emotion Processing 
 Schizophrenia researchers use the term “emotion processing” to refer “broadly to 
perceiving and using emotions adaptively” (Green & Horan, 2010, p. 244). How 
people with schizophrenia perceive the emotions of others, and how they may be 
inaccurate in these emotion perceptions, has received considerable attention from 
schizophrenia researchers (Horan, Kern, Green, & Penn, 2008). For example, 
inaccurately inferring that a stranger is angry at you because she abruptly ended a 
conversation, without considering other possibilities like her being in a hurry or 
having a bad day at work, could result in your experiencing unwarranted hostil-
ity, disdain, or even paranoia. It is thus perhaps quite natural that schizophrenia 
researchers have a strong interest in how people might accurately perceive the 
emotions of others. Social psychological researchers also are interested in under-
standing how normal adults perceive others’ emotions, but they have an additional 
long-standing interest in how a person’s own emotional experiences shape—and 
oft en cloud—social cognition. Below, we discuss both of these issues. 
 Th e early years of social cognition research were dominated by a focus on cog-
nition—aft er all, the perspective was called social  cognition —and left  little room 
for emotions (Fiske & Taylor, 2008). However, there have always been proponents 
who have asserted the importance, even the primacy, of emotions (e.g., Zajonc, 
1980), and emotions are now considered to be one of the primary drivers of people’s 
processing of social information. For example, one view of the role of emotion in 
social cognition focuses on the idea of  congruence and suggests that specifi c emo-
tions infl uence attention, perception, memory, and evaluation in emotion-specifi c 
ways. From this perspective, one’s current emotion may serve as a prime, alert-
ing one to attend to emotion-consistent objects in the environment, prompting 
associated items to be recalled from memory, and so on. To illustrate the idea of

congruence, participants induced to feel specifi c emotions were faster at identify-
ing emotion-congruent words than they were at identifying emotion-incongruent, 
neutral, and even valence-congruent/emotion-incongruent words (Niedenthal & 
Setterlund, 1994). In other words, a happy person would likely be faster to identify 
the word  delight (positive, happy related) than she would be to identify  weep (neg-
ative, sad related),  crime  (negative, sad unrelated),  colony (neutral), and even  luck 
(positive, happy unrelated). Th e idea that emotions infl uence cognitive processing 
in a congruent manner may be relevant to patients with schizophrenia, some of 
whom may be experiencing relatively consistent negative emotions, confi rming 
and reinforcing their views that the world is a negative place. 
 Other accounts of the relationships between emotions and social cognition 
concentrate on the role of emotion in determining  what we think. For exam-
ple, one prominent account of how emotions infl uence social judgments is the 
 feelings-as-information approach (for reviews, see Schwarz & Clore, 1996, 2007). 
From this perspective, emotions are seen as a source of information when making 
evaluations (see also Keltner, Ellsworth, & Edwards, 1993). In one classic experi-
ment (Schwarz & Clore, 1983), researchers telephoned participants to ask about 
their perceived level of life satisfaction and found that their responses were cor-
related with the weather: On overcast days, participants reported lower average 
levels of satisfaction. Th at is, bad moods, presumably induced by the bad weather, 
were used as information when judging overall life satisfaction (“my life is unsat-
isfying”). Tellingly, in other conditions in which participants were fi rst explicitly 
asked about the weather before answering questions about life satisfaction, moods 
did not infl uence judgments. In other words, participants who did not have the 
weather brought to their attention used emotions by default when evaluating 
their lives, whereas those who fi rst had the weather brought to their attention dis-
counted it as a relevant piece of evidence (“I’m feeling bad because of the weather 
not because I’m generally unsatisfi ed”). 
 Th ese  misattributions , or mistakes in identifying the true source of our feelings, 
are known to impact a broad array of judgments and decisions. Hikers are more 
likely to be attracted to a confederate if they meet while crossing a precarious 
bridge (misattributing the arousal of fear for the arousal of attraction) versus aft er 
a period of rest (Dutton & Aron, 1974). Th ose who have been induced to experi-
ence anger make more optimistic estimates of risk, whereas those experiencing 
fear are more cautious in their judgments (Lerner & Keltner, 2001). Furthermore, 
extraneous feelings of disgust lead to more severe moral judgments (Schnall, 
Haidt, Clore, & Jordan, 2008; Wheatley & Haidt, 2005). For example, Schnall et 
al. (2008) found that participants exposed to a disgusting smell expressed more 
severe condemnations in response to moral vignettes (e.g., marriage between 
fi rst cousins). Although incidental emotions may cloud everyone’s judgments, it 
may be that patients with schizophrenia have a particularly hard time identifying 
sources of their feelings, with their judgments being pervasively overinfl uenced 
by the emotions they are experiencing at any given time. 
 Schizophrenia researchers and social psychologists are also interested in 
how people perceive the emotions of others. Classically, in his 1872 publication 

50 
foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
 Th e Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals , Darwin (1872/1998) argued for 
a biological basis to emotional expressiveness. From this perspective, facial and 
bodily movements associated with particular emotions are considered remnants 
of adaptive behaviors. For example, expressions of disgust—the wrinkled nose, 
raised upper lip, and narrowed eyes—might prepare the body to expel noxious 
substances, and may also signal that one should avoid such substances in the fi rst 
place (Rozin & Fallon, 1987; Rozin, Haidt, & McCauley, 2000). Th is adaptive value 
of emotional expressiveness suggests that particular expressions of emotion may 
be universal. Indeed, Paul Ekman and his colleagues found evidence supporting 
the idea of cross-cultural universality in emotional expressions (Ekman, 1971; 
Ekman & Friesen, 1971; see also Izard, 1971). Th eir work, as well as that of their 
successors, has demonstrated that people throughout the world both express and 
recognize the same distinct patterns of emotional facial expressions. Although 
Ekman’s research originally identifi ed six basic emotional expressions (happiness, 
sadness, fear, anger, surprise, disgust), subsequent work has continued to expand 
the list of emotional expressions having unique, universal displays to include 
contempt (Ekman & Friesen, 1986), as well as shame, embarrassment, and guilt 
(Keltner, 1997). 
 Th ese fi ndings may have particularly relevant implications for researchers who 
are interested in schizophrenia since patients with schizophrenia oft en have sig-
nifi cant diffi  culty in reading and decoding others’ emotions (Hooley, 2010; see 
Kohler, Hanson, & March (2013), Chapter 7, this volume). According to the  social-
functional perspective (Frijida & Mesquita, 1994; Keltner & Haidt, 1999), one of 
the primary functions of emotions is to direct and facilitate one’s social interac-
tions and relationships. Although identifying and responding to one’s own emo-
tions is an integral aspect of those interactions and relationships (e.g., recognizing 
one’s own sense of guilt may prompt one to make amends), accurately identifying 
and responding to the emotions of others (e.g., detecting the anger of someone 
who is a real threat or the expression of contempt that indicates our violation of an 
important social norm) is also vital to a wide range of individual and social goals. 
For example, recognizing others’ fear may provide you with information about 
threatening objects in the environment (Mineka & Cook, 1993). Another person’s 
distress may evoke sympathetic responses and further your intentions to engage 
in helpful behaviors (Eisenberg et al., 1989). Facial expressions of emotion also 
have been shown to moderate verbal communication in predicting socially coop-
erative behaviors (Stouten & De Cremer, 2010). Other underlying mechanisms by 
which we infer the mental states of others (including emotions) are discussed later 
in the section on ToM. 
 Social Perception 
 Social perception (also known as person perception) is a term used broadly by 
social psychological researchers to refer to processes by which people come to 
view themselves and other people. In this sense, as described previously, the

categories within social cognition that we have outlined are not necessarily mutu-
ally exclusive. Th at is, attribution biases and emotion processing, as well as ToM 
(described later), are all related in a more general way to how we come to perceive 
ourselves and others in a social context. Schizophrenia researchers use the term 
“social perception” to refer to abilities to identify social roles, societal rules, and 
social contexts (Green & Horan, 2010), all of which individuals with schizophre-
nia show defi cits in doing. However, both social psychologists and schizophrenia 
researchers have common interests in specifi c aspects of social perception, such 
as interpreting nonverbal communications and ambiguous features in social situ-
ations as we form impressions of other people. 
 A great deal of information is exchanged via nonverbal behavior, regularly 
proceeding without conscious intention or even awareness on the part of 
both sender and receiver. Th ese nonverbal communiqu é s are oft en working in 
the service of our social goals. For example, nonverbal displays of status and 
power may elicit compliance or submissive behavior from others (Ellsworth, 
Carlsmith, & Henson, 1972), whereas nonconscious mimicry of others may 
result in increased liking for the mimicker by those being mimicked (Chartrand 
& Bargh, 1999). In normal adults, the ability to infer information from nonver-
bal behavior oft en results in astonishingly accurate judgments, even though the 
exact cues that were used to arrive at such conclusions may remain outside of 
conscious awareness. For example, Chawla and Krauss (1994) presented par-
ticipants with conversations that had been taped either spontaneously or aft er 
having been rehearsed by actors. Th ose viewing both the video and the audio 
of the conversations were able to identify which were spontaneous and which 
had been rehearsed with about 80% accuracy. Further, participants’ responses 
were correlated with the use of certain hand gestures and pauses in speech that 
are indicative of trouble with lexical access (e.g., searching for the right word), 
a sign of extemporaneous speech. In other words, although further probes indi-
cated that participants were unable to articulate their awareness of using such 
information, they nevertheless were nonconsciously attending to it and using it 
to make judgments.  1  
 The impressive abilities of normal adults to make accurate social judgments 
is perhaps most apparent in research on  thin slicing . In a typical thin slicing 
study, observers are briefly exposed (for as little as 50 ms) to a nonverbal behav-
ior stimulus, such as a static photograph, silent video clip, or audio recording 
(filtered so as to make specific words unidentifiable), and are subsequently 
asked to make judgments regarding a range of social variables. Despite such 
limited exposure to stimuli, participants have shown remarkable accuracy in 
judgments of characteristics as varied as extraversion (e.g., Borkenau & Liebler, 
1992), sexual orientation (e.g., Rule, Ambady, & Hallett, 2009; Johnson, Gill, 
Reichman, & Tassinary, 2007), political party affiliation (e.g., Rule & Ambady, 
2010), and job performance (e.g., Ambady, Krabbenhoft, & Hogan, 2006; 
Rule & Ambady, 2008). Further, there is evidence to suggest that the impres-
sions we form in those first moments go on to guide subsequent judgments 
and decisions with substantial real-world implications. For example, Ambady 

52 
foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
and Rosenthal (1993) demonstrated that ratings of teachers’ nonverbal behav-
iors (e.g., confidence, enthusiasm; based on exposure to 30 s or less of a silent 
video clip) were predictive of end-of-semester student evaluations and prin-
cipals’ ratings. 
 Although using thin slicing to draw inferences about others can be remark-
ably accurate, it can also sometimes lead us astray. For example, Correll, Park, 
Wittenbrink, and Judd (2002) had participants view pictures of black and white 
individuals holding either guns or neutral objects (e.g., a wallet) and instructed 
them to determine as quickly as possible whether or not to “shoot.” Participants 
chose to “shoot” as a response in this experiment more quickly if the target was 
a black individual holding a gun than if he was white and to “not shoot” more 
quickly when the target was an unarmed white individual than if he was black 
(see also Payne, 2001, 2006). Th us, accuracy in using thin slicing was mod-
erated by the race of the person in question, reinforcing people’s stereotypic 
judgments. 
 Another long-standing tradition in social perception has shown that  prim-
ing , the simple activation of constructs or schemas through prior exposure, 
can infl uence how one perceives and evaluates another person (e.g., Higgins, 
Rholes, & Jones, 1977; Srull & Wyer, 1979). For example, Higgins et al. (1977) 
asked participants to read a description of a man named Donald who behaved 
ambiguously, in ways that could be construed as positive or negative (e.g., “He 
felt he didn’t really need to rely on anyone”). Participants who had been primed 
with positive trait terms (e.g.,  independent ,  self-confi dent ) were more likely to 
evaluate Donald positively, whereas those primed with negative trait terms 
(e.g.,  aloof ,  conceited ) were more likely to evaluate him negatively. Other prim-
ing research leads to similar conclusions. For example, an ambiguously behav-
ing target is more likely to be perceived as hostile by people who have been 
primed with words related to an African American stereotype (e.g.,  musical ; 
Devine, 1989). A group of people at an offi  ce water cooler is more likely to be 
perceived as gossiping if they are women or as talking about sports if they are 
men (Dunning & Sherman, 1997; see also Kunda & Sherman-Williams, 1993). 
Also, the evidence from a mock trial is more likely to be deemed support-
ive of a conviction if a defendant has a Hispanic name than an Anglo name, 
although only if the stereotype is activated before any evidence is considered 
(Bodenhausen, 1988). 
 Some schemas can be  chronically accessible and therefore aff ect not only the 
judgments made but also what information is attended to in the fi rst place (Bargh 
& Pratto, 1986). Because the use of schemas in social perception is an effi  cient 
process, requiring fewer cognitive resources (Fiske & Neuberg, 1990; Macrae, 
Milne, & Bodenhausen, 1994), they are used more oft en when cognitive resources 
are scarce (e.g., Bodenhausen, 1990). To the extent that certain constructs (e.g., 
threats, hostility) may be more chronically accessible to some people with schizo-
phrenia, who are already laboring under diminished cognitive control, the acces-
sibility of those constructs may facilitate a tendency to disproportionally see 
threatening, hostile fi gures and behavior everywhere.

 Theory of Mind 
 Social psychologists have a strong history of investigating people’s inferences 
about the mental states of others, although the specifi c construct of ToM has 
probably received more direct attention within developmental than social psy-
chology (e.g., determining how and when children begin to understand the inter-
nal states of others; see Lyons & Koenig [2013], Chapter 1, this volume). Within 
social psychology, inferring the mental states of others has been regarded typically 
as a building block of both causal attribution and social perception, although it 
is telling that the fi ft h and latest volume of the  Handbook of Social Psychology 
devotes a separate chapter to the topic of  mind perception (Epley & Waytz, 2010), 
which the authors refer to as a “preattributional process” (p. 499) and as distinct 
from person perception (Macrae & Quadfl ieg, 2010). Th is process of inferring the 
mental states of others—beliefs, goals, and intentions—is also sometimes referred 
to as  mentalizing (Frith & Frith, 2003). 
 Inferring others’ states of mind is of critical importance to virtually every social 
interaction. For example, if we are to ensure our own safety and well-being, we 
must attempt to judge the intentions of others to determine if they are friend or 
foe. If we are to infl uence others, we must fi rst understand their current perspec-
tive, their personal goals, and what persuasive messages they might fi nd most 
compelling. If we are to love and care for another in a close relationship, we must 
be responsive to their emotional states, their needs, and the many other intrica-
cies of human intimacy. Importantly, we must do all of these things and more 
without having direct access to the inner workings of the minds of others. Instead, 
we must infer these inner workings by relying on various cues in behavior and 
speech, our own knowledge and experiences, and na ï ve theories about people and 
the social world. 
 One means of better understanding what ToM entails is by reviewing a clas-
sic test of it called the  false-belief paradigm (Wimmer & Perner, 1983; see also 
Baron-Cohen, Leslie, & Frith, 1985). In this procedure, participants are told a 
story about a boy named Maxi who places some chocolate in a blue cupboard 
before going out to play. While he is gone, Maxi’s mother moves the choco-
late from the blue cupboard to the green cupboard. Participants are then asked 
where Maxi will look for the chocolate when he returns. Correctly identifying 
the blue cupboard indicates the participant’s ability to both (a) represent Maxi’s 
mind and beliefs about the world as distinct from one’s own, and (b) understand 
that beliefs (e.g., the chocolate is in the blue cupboard) may diverge from reality 
(e.g., the chocolate is now in the green cupboard). Although infants and young 
children may demonstrate an understanding of other important mental rep-
resentations, such as goals and intentions (Phillips, Wellman, & Spelke, 2002; 
Warneken & Tomasello, 2006), it is not until the approximate age of 4 years 
that the more complex inference skills that are associated with ToM begin to 
appear and children are consistently able to choose the correct cupboard where 
Maxi will look (for a review of false-belief paradigms, see Wellman, Cross, & 
Watson, 2001). 

54 
foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
 Th eory of Mind phenomena are found in complex real-world scenarios as well. 
Imagine that a close work colleague has just received bad news. How is she feeling? 
Angry or shocked or sad? How should you respond? With a comforting touch, an 
off er for aft er-work drinks, or by giving her some space to be left  alone? Research 
on ToM suggests that you will use several pieces of information when determin-
ing your colleague’s state of mind, which will in turn dictate how you will respond 
to her. In addition to the verbal and nonverbal information off ered through your 
colleague’s behavior and speech, you are likely to rely on two primary sources of 
information: your own mental states or experiences ( simulation theory ) and your 
na ï ve theories about other minds ( theory theory ). Examples of the latter strategy 
are described elsewhere in this chapter, as theory theory could be said to encom-
pass much of the research in causal attributions and person perception, in which 
it is assumed that people can reason about other minds independently of our own 
mental states. 
 Simulation theory suggests that individuals use their own thoughts, emotions, 
and mental states as the most immediate means of insight regarding the thoughts, 
emotions, and mental states of others. (Some research I previously described on 
emotion processing, such as that on congruence and feelings-as-information, 
similarly suggests that one’s own current states—in those cases emotions—can 
infl uence reasoning and judgment.) For example, research on the  false consensus 
eff ect fi nds that people use their own performance as diagnostic of how their peers 
would perform on the same test (Alicke & Largo, 1995); overestimate the extent 
to which others share their political and social views (Goethals, Allison, & Frost, 
1979; Mullen & Goethals, 1990); and believe their own level of endorsement of 
personality inventory statements (e.g., “I like to let people know where I stand 
on things”) to be normative in the population (Krueger & Clement, 1994). Th is 
“egocentric” bias even extends to attempts to determine how others view oneself. 
Chambers, Epley, Savitsky, and Windschitl (2008) asked participants to speculate 
about how observers would evaluate their performance and found people were 
unable to discount the impact of their privately held knowledge about their own 
past performance on the same task (see also Gilovich, Kruger, & Medvec, 2002). 
Work from social neuroscience has demonstrated that the same neural region—
the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)—is implicated in both mentalizing about 
others and self-refl ection (Mitchell, Banaji, & Macrae, 2005; see Jimenez et al. 
[2013], Chapter 4, this volume). Further, developments in the study of  mirror neu-
rons (for a review, see Rizzolatti & Craighero, 2004) also suggest that we may even 
be simulating the experiences of others at a neurophysiological level (Gallese & 
Goldman, 1998). 
 But what if you perceive another person to be quite diff erent from you? In that 
case, one’s own mind is likely not as useful a piece of information. Normal adults 
do, in fact, take the perceived similarity between self and others into account, 
relying less on self-refl ection when encountering a dissimilar other (Ames, 
2004; Mitchell, Macrae, & Banaji, 2006; Todd, Hanko, Galinsky, & Mussweiler, 
2011). Further, humans undoubtedly possess the ability to distinguish between 
our own minds and the minds of others to some extent, as doing so is clearly an

essential component of the false-belief procedure (i.e., “Just because I know the 
chocolate is in the green cupboard doesn’t mean that Maxi will know”). Th us, a 
related issue is  perspective taking , or actively considering the viewpoints of oth-
ers. Interestingly, perspective taking may function, at times, not by considering 
others as distinct from oneself, but by considering others  as the self. For exam-
ple, Galinsky and Moskowitz (2000) found that when participants were asked to 
write an essay about an outgroup member (e.g., an elderly person) and were also 
asked to engage in perspective taking, they were less likely to use stereotypes. 
Th ese positive consequences are in line with research indicating that other posi-
tive behaviors are associated with perspective taking, such as acting prosocially 
(e.g., Richardson, Hammock, Smith, Gardner, & Signo, 1994; Toi & Batson, 1982; 
but see Epley, Caruso, & Bazerman, 2006). Yet, one explanation that Galinsky 
and Moskowitz found for this positive change in behavior is that the essay writers 
were describing the elderly person using more self-relevant characteristics (see 
also Davis, Conklin, Smith, & Luce, 1996; Galinsky & Ku, 2004). In other words, 
the prosocial behavior that perspective taking oft en fosters may actually be con-
sidered a form of pro- self behavior! Failure to overcome this egocentric bias has 
been identifi ed as one of the key barriers to accuracy in perspective taking (for a 
review, see Epley & Caruso, 2008). For example, Kruger and colleagues found that 
although message recipients were better able to distinguish between sincere and 
sarcastic tones when messages were delivered by telephone rather than e-mail, 
the  senders of those messages failed to predict a diff erence in recipients’ accuracy 
based on mode of communication (Kruger, Epley, Parker, & Ng, 2005). Th at is, 
the senders were unable to accurately adjust for the privately held knowledge of 
their intentions. 
 Th ese fi ndings may have important implications for schizophrenia researchers 
(see Abu-Akel & Shamay-Tsoory [2013], Chapter 8, this volume). First, as inter-
ventions that are designed to address perspective taking defi cits in schizophrenic 
patients are investigated (see Part III of this volume), it may be useful to note 
that the egocentric biases in perspective taking that are present in normal adult 
populations may be exacerbated in people with schizophrenia, especially given 
the cognitively eff ortful nature of perspective taking (see Epley & Caruso, 2008), 
paired with the overreliance on automatic processing exhibited by schizophrenic 
patients. Th is combination presents an additional obstacle that must be overcome 
for eff ective treatment. Second, another side to speculating about the minds of 
others is being able to speculate about what others think about us, which can 
result in a tendency to overexaggerate the extent to which others are attending to 
and evaluating us (e.g., Gilovich, Medvec, & Savitsky, 2000). Th is hyperattentive-
ness to the evaluations of others, when taken to extremes, could possibly account 
for some of the more severe persecutory delusions that are characteristic of 
schizophrenia (Martin & Penn, 2001), an idea that supports the speculation that 
people with schizophrenia actually possess an overactive ToM (Abu-Akel, 1999; 
Badcock, 2004; see Abu-Akel & Shamay-Tsoory [2013], Chapter 8, this  volume). 
Such possibilities are a fruitful direction for future research on social cognition 
and schizophrenia.

 Summary 
 Schizophrenia researchers have emphasized four social cognition topics of pri-
mary interest: attribution biases, emotion processing, social perception, and ToM. 
Yet, even within these topics already of interest to schizophrenia researchers, there 
are other phenomena that may be usefully examined. For example, several social 
psychological theories suggest how people draw causal inferences, and schizo-
phrenia researchers may benefi t by more fully examining how various pieces of 
information are used by people with schizophrenia. Additionally, schizophrenia 
researchers may examine not only perceiving the emotions of others, but also 
focus more on how current emotional states can infl uence judgments. It may also 
be benefi cial to examine how people with schizophrenia use thin slices of infor-
mation when drawing conclusions about others and how they may struggle to 
simulate other minds due to intensifi ed egocentric biases, as well as how these def-
icits and biases may be exacerbated because patients oft en have limited  cognitive 
resources. 
 INCREASING BREADTH OF TOPICS 
IN SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH 
 Just as insights may be gained from more thoroughly exploring social cognition 
topics that are already of interest to schizophrenia researchers, insights also may 
be gained from exploring additional social cognition topics studied by social psy-
chologists. In this concluding section, I suggest that other topics studied by social 
psychological researchers may also be relevant to schizophrenia researchers but 
have thus far received relatively less attention. As examples, I discuss three topic 
areas: dual processing models, metacognitive experiences, and experiences of 
conscious will. Of course, this is not meant to be an exhaustive list of topics that 
may be potentially relevant to schizophrenia researchers. Rather, I hope to give a 
fl avor for a greater breadth of other potentially relevant issues that schizophrenia 
researchers may draw on when exploring social cognition in schizophrenia. 
 Dual-Processing Models 
 Th roughout this chapter, I have made reference to several forms of judgmental 
conclusions that may be arrived at automatically (i.e., via a process that is uninten-
tional, uncontrollable, effi  cient, and occurring largely outside of conscious aware-
ness) versus those that require more controlled (i.e., intentional, controllable, 
eff ortful, and conscious) processing. For example, research indicates that disposi-
tional (internal) causal attributions may be arrived at more automatically, whereas 
adjusting for situational (external) causes may require more controlled cognitive 
eff ort. Th e use of current emotions in judgments may occur more automatically 
by default, whereas correcting for or discounting the eff ect of current emotions

Social Cognition 
57
in judgments requires more eff ortful thought. Priming aff ects people’s social per-
ceptions relatively automatically, without much need for conscious awareness of 
prime exposure. And, people use their own minds as a guide to the mental states 
of others in an automatic way, without any deliberation. 
 Various dual-process models began emerging within social psychology 
throughout the 1980s and early 1990s to account for domain-specifi c phenom-
ena, including those in the areas of causal attribution (Gilbert, 1991; Trope, 
1986), person perception (Brewer, 1988; Fiske & Neuberg, 1990), and persuasion 
(Chaiken, 1980; Petty & Cacioppo, 1986), among many others (for a review, see 
Chaiken & Trope, 1999). However, as automatic and controlled processing may 
be relevant to numerous topic-specifi c domains, several attempts have been made 
to articulate general dual-processing models (for reviews, see Kahneman, 2003; 
Smith & DeCoster, 2000; Strack & Deutsch, 2004). Considering ideas about dual-
processing modes may be particularly relevant to researchers attempting to better 
understand schizophrenia and improve functional outcomes for schizophrenic 
individuals. As we have noted, the defi cits in important domains of controlled 
processing, such as executive functioning, exhibited by those with schizophrenia 
may result in an overdependence on automatic processing. Th is tendency may 
result in more extreme versions of attribution biases, inaccurate emotion pro-
cessing and social perception, and a greater inability to understand what oth-
ers are thinking than that exhibited in normal adult populations. An inability 
to exert control certainly presents problems if the default response is unhealthy 
or self-defeating. But, of course, automatic processes are not always  wrong (i.e., 
do not always necessitate a correction). Th erefore, one means of circumventing 
the potential problems associated with schizophrenic patients’ general reliance 
on automatic processing may be to harness its power positively by encouraging 
the automatization of healthy habits and responses (e.g., Roberts, Kleinlein, & 
Stevens, 2012; Velligan et al., 2008, 2009).  
 Metacognitive Experiences 
 Metacognitive experiences are subjective experiences that accompany all cogni-
tive operations and include experiential information, such as the ease or diffi  -
culty of recall or association and the feeling of thought-confi dence (for a review, 
see Schwarz, Sanna, Skurnik, & Yoon, 2007). Social cognition researchers have 
found that, although people certainly do form judgments based on the content of 
their thoughts (what they are thinking about), metacognitive experiences can also 
strongly infl uence judgments. For example, if one attempts to retrieve examples 
supporting another’s trustworthiness but fi nds this task subjectively diffi  cult to 
accomplish (the experience of thinking of trustworthy actions is hard), one may 
ironically infer that the other is in fact  un trustworthy. Reliance on metacogni-
tive experiences for making judgments is heightened under conditions of limited 
cognitive resources (e.g., distraction, load, or impairment; Schwarz et al., 1991), 
which are common in schizophrenia. Th us, processes such as these may have 

58 
foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
paradoxical implications, as in the common technique of “generating alternatives” 
used in cognitive therapy for psychosis. For example, a patient may report that she 
saw a long, dark limousine in front of her house and is certain that the CIA is aft er 
her. Th is assertion may lead the therapist to suggest that the person think of other 
possible reasons why the car was parked there. However, cognitive defi cits may 
make this process such an eff ortful one for the person that, even if she can gener-
ate other possibilities, she may ironically conclude that the belief must be very 
true (because the other reasons do not readily come to mind), further entrench-
ing a delusion of persecution. It is as if she is saying, “It was so diffi  cult for me to 
imagine other explanations that my original judgment must be true.” 
 Schizophrenia researchers have recently begun developing promising inter-
ventions aimed at increasing awareness and countering the infl uence of cogni-
tive biases (see Combs et al. [2013], Chapter 16, this volume, and Moritz [2013], 
Chapter 15, this volume). Additional investigation of the infl uence of subjec-
tive experiences, particularly those of various types of fl uency (see Schwarz & 
Clore, 2007), in people with schizophrenia and how they may be harnessed to 
promote adaptive thinking and behavior may prove to be a fruitful area for future 
research. 
 Experiences of Conscious Will 
 Schizophrenia is characterized by a range of symptoms involving aberrant experi-
ences of intentionality or conscious will, including delusions of control, thought 
broadcasting and withdrawal, and auditory verbal hallucinations (Roberts, Stutes, 
& Hoff man, in press). Th e processes by which people infer that the self is—or is 
not—the cause of an action, utterance, or event have also been studied by social 
psychological researchers in normal adults. Research using normal adult popula-
tions has found that people routinely, and rather consistently, make the same mis-
takes of over- and underattributing agency to conscious will that many patients 
with schizophrenia do, albeit to a much lesser degree. 
 One prime example is a line of research by Daniel Wegner and his colleagues 
on the essential components and processes of  apparent mental causation , which 
has contributed much to our understanding of the circumstances under which the 
self is viewed as a causal agent, as well as the implications of these fi ndings for the 
idea of conscious will (Wegner, 2002; Wegner & Wheatley, 1999). For example, it 
has been shown that normal adults may come to believe that they have aff ected 
the outcome of an athletic competition (involving a confederate trained to make 
successful shots in a mock basketball set-up) aft er having simply been induced to 
generate prior thoughts that are consistent with the outcome (e.g., “the shooter 
releases the ball and it swooshes through the net”; Pronin, Wegner, McCarthy, & 
Rodriguez, 2006). In other words, normal adults in these experiments display an 
exaggerated sense of will in that they believe their thoughts cause events, despite 
the fact that our normal ideas about the logic of causality would suggest other-
wise. People also have been shown to misattribute their own actions to another.

To illustrate this, Wegner and colleagues conducted a series of experiments mod-
eled on the practice of facilitated communication, a technique in which commu-
nication-impaired clients are assisted at a computer keyboard by facilitators who 
attempt to sense the clients’ responses and inclinations by bracing their hands as 
they type (Wegner, Fuller, & Sparrow, 2003). Participants (“facilitators”) placed 
their hands over those of a confederate (“communicators”) and were instructed to 
sense their partner’s answers to a series of questions. Despite the fact that the con-
federates were not privy to the questions asked, the participants tended to provide 
correct answers to the questions and to report that their partner’s inclinations had 
infl uenced the answers they provided. Th at is, normal adults in these experiments 
exhibited systematic mistakes in believing that their own actions had been caused 
by another. Th us, it may be interesting for future researchers to directly com-
pare normal adult and schizophrenia samples in how they experience conscious 
will and apparent mental causation. Again, it may be that schizophrenic patients 
exhibit more extreme versions of those biases found in normal adult populations, 
perhaps contributing to aberrant intentionality symptoms in schizophrenia. In 
short, investigating elements that indicate agency or authorship, such as visual 
action feedback and the presence of action-relevant thoughts (Wegner & Sparrow, 
2004), in both people with schizophrenia and healthy adult populations may help 
inform both areas and explain pathologies that may develop when the normal 
inference processes of healthy adults go awry. 
 CONCLUSION 
 Social psychologists and schizophrenia researchers share common interests in 
illuminating the social cognitive processes by which people come to understand 
themselves and others. We have off ered three primary observations and made 
suggestions that may be valuable to schizophrenia researchers interested in social 
cognition. First, social psychologists and schizophrenia researchers may conceive 
of social cognition diff erently, and recognizing this diff erence may help allevi-
ate confusion and facilitate more cross-disciplinary collaboration. Second, within 
the topic areas already of interest to schizophrenia researchers, social psychol-
ogy has produced in-depth theorizing that may enrich the schizophrenia litera-
ture. Th ird, there are domains of social cognition research in social psychology 
that have promising implications for schizophrenia research but have received 
little attention. Th at said, social psychologists may also have much to learn from 
schizophrenia researchers. For example, learning more about what cognitive and 
emotional skills may be most critical to healthy social interactions, understanding 
where current social cognitive process models may be incomplete, and clarify-
ing how judgments made by people with extreme impairments diff er from the 
“impairments” (biases, errors, mistakes) made routinely in normal adult popula-
tions. By examining social cognition in schizophrenia, social psychologists and 
schizophrenia researchers would be continuing the tradition of interdisciplinary 
collaboration from which social cognition research fi rst arose.

 NOTE 
  1.     It is worthwhile to note that, in some cases, consciously attempting to utilize these 
otherwise nonconscious nonverbal behaviors may be quite diffi  cult and even anti-
thetical to one’s goals. For example, studies have shown that mimicry attempts can 
backfi re when explicitly detected, resulting in more negative evaluations of the mim-
icker (Bailenson, Yee, Patel, & Beall, 2008; Bourheis, Giles, & Lambert, 1975)—a fi nd-
ing that has cautionary implications for attempting to teach those with social defi cits 
to intentionally engage in mimicry to improve social interactions. Yet, many of the 
experimental fi ndings on nonconscious mimicry relied on confederates who were 
instructed to mimic another (e.g., Chartrand & Bargh, 1999), which suggests a more 
nuanced view of the benefi ts and consequences of spontaneous versus intentional 
mimicry. Regardless, it is interesting to speculate that applying and investigating 
mimicry as part of social skills training for schizophrenia patients may help to inform 
an understanding of the relative importance of automatic versus controlled processes 
in acquiring and using nonverbal behavioral skills.

 Cross-Cultural Variation in Social 
Cognition and the Social Brain  
 S H I H U I    H A N  ■ 
 SOCIAL COGNITION AND THE SOCIAL BRAIN 
IN SOCIOCULTURAL CONTEXTS 
 Humans are essentially social animals. An individual begins to react to others 
immediately aft er birth and develops through interacting with others. One of 
the most signifi cant parts of a person’s life is to join others in a variety of social 
activities and to seek specifi c social goals. Consequences of social interactions 
may be either positive or negative, and one can suff er severely by merely being 
isolated from social environments. Current state-of-art techniques for commu-
nication have increased the number of individuals that one may interact with in 
society. Th is has resulted in large-scale, rapid social interactions among people 
from diverse geographical and cultural regions and backgrounds. 
 To navigate in social environments effi  ciently, people have to think about them-
selves and others frequently and to understand themselves and others correctly. 
Th e processing of social information about oneself and others, referred to as 
 social cognition , provides a basis for appropriate social behaviors and an avenue 
to achieve social goals. Some social information, such as facial expression, can 
be perceived directly, whereas other social information, such as intentions and 
beliefs, have to be inferred based on the analysis of perceived information. An 
important feature of social cognition is context dependence—that is, what and 
how social information is processed relies heavily on whom an individual inter-
acts with and in which social context such interactions occur. For example, people 
may think of and treat others in dominance and in subordination diff erently, and 
the way individuals interact with those who sit high or low in the social hierarchy 
may vary greatly from one society to another (Triandis & Gelfand, 1998). Based on 
cross-cultural comparisons, psychological fi ndings have formulated several varia-
tions of standard social cognitive processes in diff erent cultural contexts, such as 

70 
foundations of human social cognition
causal attribution (Choi, Nisbett, & Norenzayan, 1999), self-construals (Markus 
& Kitayama, 1991, 2010), and aff ect valuation (Tsai, Knutson, & Fung, 2006). 
 Cross-cultural variation in social cognition may refl ect, to a certain degree, 
the diff erence in cognitive styles between diff erent cultures. It has been proposed 
that the human mind can be characterized by either “a context-independent pro-
cessing style—aggregating and integrating across situations, ignoring situational 
variance in one’s thoughts, feelings, and responses” or “a context-dependent pro-
cessing style—paying attention to specifi c social contexts” (K ü hnen & Oyserman, 
2002, p. 492). Specifi cally, people in many Western cultural contexts are inclined 
to focus exclusively on the  focal object during cognitive processes, such as visual 
perception and causal attributions of social and physical events. In contrast, peo-
ple in many East Asian cultural contexts are more likely to pay attention to  con-
texts during perception, causal attribution, and other cognitive tasks (Ji, Peng, & 
Nisbett, 2000; Masuda & Nisbett, 2001; Nisbett, Peng, Choi, & Norenzayan, 2001; 
Nisbett & Masuda, 2003). Th ese fi ndings of cultural diff erences in cognitive styles 
change the classic psychological and philosophical views that the basic processes 
of human cognition are universal. 
 A key function of the human brain is to deal with the social world. From an 
evolutionary perspective, the brain evolves to cope with a complexity of social 
interactions, such that the relative neocortex volume increases as a function of 
the mean social group size (Dunbar & Shultz, 2007), suggesting that more com-
plex and larger scale social interactions require more neural resources in the pri-
mate brain. Humans have evolved specifi c patterns of brain activity to deal with 
complicated information relating to the self and others. Recent brain imaging 
studies have accumulated ample data that help to uncover the function of dif-
ferent brain regions in social cognition (Lieberman, 2010; also see Jimenez, Gee, 
Cannon, & Lieberman [2013], Chapter 4, this volume). Plasticity is part of the 
intrinsic nature of the brain (Pascual-Leone, Amedi, Fregni, & Merabet, 2005), 
and this allows, during adolescence, for the development of neural mechanisms 
that are adapted to the context-dependent nature of social cognition (Blakemore, 
2008). 
 Culture provides a framework for social interactions by building social val-
ues and norms and by assigning meaning to social events. Given the diversity 
of sociocultural contexts across the world, the human brain may develop neural 
mechanisms to mediate social interactions in specifi c sociocultural contexts. In 
this sense, culture may also function to shape neural correlates of social cognition 
in the human brain. Indeed, recent research has shown increasing evidence that 
neural activity involved in specifi c social cognitive processes may diff er between 
individuals who grow up in diff erent cultural contexts (Chiao & Ambady, 2007; 
Han & Northoff , 2008; Kitayama & Uskul, 2011). Th e increasing transcultural 
brain imaging fi ndings have given birth to a new discipline — cultural neurosci-
ence , which investigates mutual interactions between cultural values, practices, 
and beliefs and human brain function, and provides a new perspective on the 
functional organization of the human brain associated with social cognition. Th e 
new discipline is manifested in several published special issues of journals (e.g.,

and edited books (e.g., Han & P ö ppel, 2011). 
 Th is chapter reviews previous psychological fi ndings of cross-cultural varia-
tions in social cognition and recent brain imaging fi ndings of cross-cultural varia-
tions in the neural substrates underlying social cognition. Th is literature review 
outlines what aspects of social cognition vary across cultures and to what degree 
the underlying neural mechanisms are shaped by sociocultural contexts. Th is 
chapter will also discuss the implications of transcultural imaging fi ndings for 
mental health and raise future questions regarding the cultural diversity of social 
cognitive processes and their underlying neural mechanisms. 
 CROSS-CULTURAL VARIATION IN THE 
PROCESSING OF OTHERS 
 In most cases, social interactions aim to realize specifi c social goals through 
cooperation between members of a social group. To make social cooperation 
possible and eff ective, one has to coordinate his or her behaviors with others, 
based on predictions of what others are going to do. Understanding others’ 
minds, such as their thoughts and feelings, is necessary for cooperative and 
competitive social activities. Th inking about others’ minds constitutes a key 
component of social cognition, and the underlying neurocognitive processes 
have been of great interest among psychologists and neuroscientists. Increasing 
psychological and brain imaging evidence suggests that social cognition can be, 
by and large, decomposed into  cognitive capacity , which primarily supports the 
understanding of others’ intentions, beliefs, desires, and the like, and  aff ective 
capacity , which principally mediates the understanding and sharing of others’ 
feelings and emotional states. Studies of cross-cultural psychology and tran-
scultural brain imaging have shown evidence that distinct neurocognitive pro-
cesses are involved in cognitive and aff ective capacities and that these exhibit 
cross-cultural variations. 
 Perspective Taking 
 Multiple processes aimed at understanding others are engaged during social inter-
actions and communication with others (Frith & Frith, 2010). One has to realize 
that others have the power or authority to act with specifi c social goals and to 
ascribe mental states to others in order to explain and predict their actions. One 
cognitive capacity of social cognition is to know that what others see may be dif-
ferent from what is perceived by oneself. Perceiving a visual scene from another 
person’s viewpoint or taking others’ perspectives is critical for understanding oth-
ers’ minds during social communication and for coordinating behaviors between 
oneself and others. How is the ability of perspective taking infl uenced by cul-
tural contexts? In accordance with the assertion that people in a Western cultural 

72 
foundations of human social cognition
context have an independent view of the self and focus attention on the self, 
whereas people in an East Asian cultural context have an interdependent view of 
the self and focus attention on contexts and connections with others (Markus & 
Kitayama, 1991, 2010; K ü hnen & Oyserman, 2002, Nisbett et al., 2001; Nisbett & 
Masuda, 2003), it seems likely that East Asians may be better perspective takers 
compared to Westerners. 
 Th is idea was tested in a study that compared eye-track measures and behav-
ioral performance between Chinese and American participants in a game that 
required distinction between one’s own knowledge and that of another person 
(Wu & Keysar, 2007). In this game, a “director” sits opposite a participant at a table 
with objects placed in a grid and instructs the subject to move certain objects. Th e 
director’s and participant’s perspectives diff er as some objects are occluded from 
the director’s perspective and the participant knows that he or she will not be 
asked to move the occluded objects (competitors). Th e critical test is how eye fi xa-
tion and reaction times to move the target object, which can be seen by both the 
director and the participant, are infl uenced by the occluded competitor, which is 
identical to the target object but can be seen only by the participant. If Chinese 
participants pay closer attention to others’ perspectives than Americans do, their 
eye fi xation and reaction times would be infl uenced by the occluded object to a 
much lesser degree compared to those of Americans. Indeed, it was found that 
Americans fi xated on the competitor more than twice as oft en as they fi xated on 
a neutral baseline object, whereas Chinese participants fi xated on the competitor 
only slightly more than they fi xated on the baseline object. In addition, it took 
Americans much longer to identify the correct target when the competitor was 
present compared to a baseline condition, whereas the competitor caused virtu-
ally no delay for the Chinese participants. Th ese results suggest that, relative to 
Americans, Chinese individuals may be more attuned to the perspective of others 
during social interactions. 
 Th e neural substrates of perspective taking have also been investigated in 
a few studies that combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
and diff erent paradigms. For example, taking an avatar’s perspective activated 
the mesial superior parietal and right premotor cortex (Vogeley et al., 2004). 
Watching video clips depicting simple hand or foot actions fi lmed from the 
third-person perspective increased activity in the lingual gyrus (Jackson, 
Meltzoff , & Decety, 2006). Th e medial part of the superior frontal gyrus, left  
superior temporal sulcus, left  temporal pole, and right inferior parietal lobe 
showed increased activity when medical students responded to a list of health-
related questions from the perspective of a lay person (Ruby & Decety, 2003). It 
appears that distinct brain regions are engaged during taking others’ perspec-
tives, depending on whether tasks require visuospatial or conceptual transfor-
mations between the self and others. However, because most previous brain 
imaging studies of perspective taking recruited participants in the Western 
cultural contexts, neural mechanisms underlying perspective taking that are 
sensitive to cultural infl uences remain unknown (see also Jimenez et al. [2013], 
Chapter 4, this volume).

 Mental State Reasoning 
 In addition to knowing that others have diff erent perspectives, humans also 
consider others’ mental states (e.g., intentions, desires and beliefs) in order to 
interpret and predict their behavior. Th is ability, referred to as  theory of mind 
(ToM) or  mentalizing , has been studied extensively in developmental psychol-
ogy (see Lyons & Koenig [2013], Chapter 1, this volume). Children are able to 
understand that others can have false beliefs and to distinguish between their 
knowledge and that of others aft er age 4 (e.g., Perner, 1991; Wellman, Cross, & 
Watson, 2001). Moreover, children from diff erent cultures seem to show similar 
developmental trajectories of ToM ability. Chinese and American children start 
to understand others’ false beliefs at the same age (Sabbagh, Xu, Carlson, Moses, 
& Lee, 2006). However, brain imaging studies suggest that the neural bases of 
mentalizing may vary across diff erent cultural contexts. Kobayashi et al. (2006) 
found that, relative to judgments of event outcomes based on an understanding 
of physical-causal reasoning, judgments about others’ false beliefs activated the 
right dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), right anterior cingulate cortex 
(ACC), right middle frontal gyrus, and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex in both 
American English-speaking monolingual adults and Japanese-English late bilin-
gual adults. However, judgments of mental states in monolingual Americans pro-
duced greater activation in the right insula, bilateral temporoparietal junction 
(TPJ), and right DMPFC relative to bilingual Japanese participants, who showed 
greater brain activity in the right orbital frontal gyrus. Th e same group also found 
increased activity in the DMPFC and precuneus in American English-speaking 
monolingual children and Japanese bilingual children aged 8 to 11 years when 
they performed cartoon-based or word-based ToM tasks (Kobayashi, Glover, & 
Temple, 2007). However, the word-based ToM task generated greater activity in 
the left  superior temporal sulcus in American than in Japanese children, whereas 
enhanced activity was identifi ed in the left  inferior temporal gyrus in Japanese 
compared to American children. In addition, stronger activation in the right TPJ 
in the cartoon-based ToM task was observed in American compared to Japanese 
children. In the cartoon-based ToM task, Japanese children showed stronger acti-
vation in the left  anterior superior temporal sulcus and temporal pole than did 
American children. Th ese results suggest that cultural diff erences in ToM-related 
neural activity are not the same in adults and children, suggesting that, although 
children may acquire ToM ability by the age of 4, acculturation still shapes the 
underlying neural substrates during later development. 
 Recent studies using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes (RME) test (Baron-
Cohen, Wheelwright, Hill, Raste, & Plumb, 2001) also showed evidence for 
cultural infl uences on the neural substrates of ToM. Th e RME test consists of 
photographs depicting only the eye region of a face. Four mental state terms 
accompanying each stimulus are presented at each corner of the photograph, 
and participants have to identify the term that matches the mental state of 
the eyes. Adams et al. (2010) found that, relative to a gender discrimination 
task, the RME task induced increased activity in the bilateral superior temporal 

74 
foundations of human social cognition
sulci (STS) and bilateral inferior frontal gyrus in both European Americans 
and Japanese individuals. Culture-specifi c neural responses to mental state rea-
soning was observed in the bilateral posterior STS, where the neural activity 
showed an intracultural advantage; that is, greater response to eyes from the 
same culture compared to eyes from the other culture, in both the European 
Americans and Japanese. Th e intracultural advantage was also evident in 
responses to mental state judgments, with participants being more accurate 
in judging eyes from the same, compared to other, cultures. Taken together, 
these fi ndings suggest that recruitment of neural circuits associated with ToM 
varies across diff erent ToM tasks and is modulated by cultural group mem-
bership; this eff ect is similar for diff erent cultural groups. Cultural infl uences 
on neurocognitive processes involved in mentalizing may occur early during 
development.  
 Gesture Understanding 
 Because humans use gestures to communicate expressively, and gestures are 
highly culture-specifi c, neural mechanisms underlying gesture understanding 
may also be culturally specifi c. To test how motor resonance (i.e., increased corti-
cospinal excitability [CSE] during observation of gestures) is aff ected by cultural 
familiarity, Molnar-Szakacs et al. (2007) used transcranial magnetic stimulation 
(TMS) to measure CSE during observation of emblems (i.e., gestures that convey 
conventionalized meaning without accompanying speech) with culture-specifi c 
meanings. Th ey found that European Americans showed higher CSE during obser-
vations of an American compared to a Nicaraguan actor. However, Nicaraguan 
and American emblems elicited similar CSE when performed by the American 
actor, whereas Nicaraguan emblems performed by the Nicaraguan actor yielded 
higher CSE than did American emblems. Th e results suggest an interaction eff ect 
between perceptual and cultural factors on the motor resonance of observed 
gestures. 
 A recent fMRI study showed further evidence that the mentalizing and mir-
ror neuron regions, which are associated with the understanding of others’ 
mental states and with perception of others’ physical actions, respectively, may 
be differentially involved in gesture understanding, depending on the cultural 
familiarity of the gestures (Liew, Ma, Han, & Aziz-Zadeh, 2011). Specifically, 
Chinese participants showed greater activity in the brain areas associated with 
mentalizing (e.g., the posterior cingulate cortex, DMPFC, and the bilateral 
TPJ) to culturally familiar than unfamiliar gestures, whereas unfamiliar ges-
tures more strongly activated the posterior mirror neuron regions (e.g., the 
left inferior parietal lobe, left postcentral gyrus, dorsal region of the postcen-
tral gyrus, and ventral portion of the supramarginal gyrus). Thus, distinct 
brain regions in the mentalizing and mirror neuron systems may be engaged 
in social communication for understanding culturally familiar and unfamiliar 
gestures.

 Bodily Expression 
 Perception of others’ bodily expressions helps people to understand both mental 
states and social status, which helps to guide appropriate behaviors in social hier-
archies and to determine behavioral consequences. Bodily expressions give sig-
nals of dominance (marking higher status) and signals of subordination (marking 
lower status) (Hall, Coats, & LeBeau, 2005). However, bodily expressions can be 
assigned diff erent cultural values. For example, the American culture generally 
encourages dominance (Triandis & Gelfand, 1998), whereas the Japanese culture 
generally encourages subordination (Yamaguchi, Kuhlman, & Sugimori, 1995). 
Would distinct values assigned to bodily expressions be associated with cultur-
ally specifi c neural underpinnings? Freeman et al. (2009) assessed this by con-
ducting brain scans of American and Japanese individuals during the perception 
of fi gural outlines of body displays that implicate dominance or subordination. 
Self-report showed a tendency in Americans of performing more behaviors to 
dominate others. On the contrary, Japanese participants reported preference of 
more subordinate behaviors so as to be dominated by others. Moreover, domi-
nant stimuli activated the caudate nucleus, bilaterally, and the medial prefron-
tal cortex in Americans, whereas these were activated by subordinate stimuli in 
Japanese individuals. Th e results suggest that the cultural tuning of tendencies in 
social behaviors can be accomplished by way of the mesolimbic reward system. 
Moreover, the cultural values placed on social status lead to specifi c neural repre-
sentations of culturally preferred bodily expression.  
 Causal Attribution 
 In most cases, causes of human behaviors are not obvious and are beyond per-
ception. Cultural psychology has accumulated evidence for cultural diff erences 
in causal attribution of both social behaviors and physical events. It has been 
shown that East Asians are more sensitive to contextual constraints, whereas 
European Americans are more prone to individuals’ internal dispositions when 
making causality judgments on social behaviors (Choi et al., 1999; Morris & 
Peng, 1994). Cultural diff erences are also observed in causal attribution of physi-
cal events. Peng and Knowles (2003) found that American and Chinese students 
with no formal physics education emphasized diff erent causes when explaining 
physical events. Americans were more likely to attribute the causes of physical 
events to dispositional factors (e.g., weight), whereas Chinese participants were 
more likely to attribute causes of the same events to contextual factors (e.g., a 
medium). Th e cultural diff erence in causal attribution of physical events has 
been associated with culture-specifi c patterns of neural activity. Han et al. (2011) 
fi rst scanned Chinese participants during causality or motion direction judg-
ments when viewing animations of object collisions. Th ey identifi ed a neural 
circuit related to causal attribution consisting of the medial/lateral prefrontal 
cortex and left  parietal/temporal cortex by contrasting causality versus motion

direction judgments. Th ey showed further that the medial prefrontal activity was 
sensitive to the demand to infer causes of physical events whereas the left  parietal 
activity was modulated by the contextual complexity of physical events. More 
interestingly, Han et al. (2011) found that the medial prefrontal activity involved 
in causality judgments was comparable in American and Chinese participants, 
whereas the left  parietal activity associated with causality judgments was stron-
ger in Chinese than in Americans, regardless of whether participants attended 
to the contextual information. Th ese fi ndings indicate that activity in the medial 
prefrontal cortex may be universally implicated in causal reasoning, whereas the 
contextual processing in the left  parietal cortex is sensitive to cultural diff erences 
in causality perception. 
 Emotion 
 Th ere has been evidence for both universality and cultural variation of emotional 
processes. For example, emotional categories in terms of valence and arousal are 
universal (Russell, 1994), whereas the process of learning to control emotional 
expression may be dependent on cultural factors (Matsumoto, 1989). Both behav-
ioral and brain imaging studies suggest that cultural experiences may infl uence 
emotion recognition. Markham and Wang (1996) found that both Chinese and 
Australian children showed higher recognition accuracy of emotional faces from 
their own cultural group than of those from another cultural group. Recent fMRI 
research investigated whether culture aff ects the neural mechanisms that underlie 
emotion processing. Chiao et al. (2008) scanned native Japanese participants in 
Japan and Caucasians in the United States while they perceived photos of Japanese 
and Caucasian faces expressing fearful or nonfearful (e.g., angry, happy, neutral) 
emotions. Th ey found that fearful faces from the participants’ own cultural group 
induced greater activation in the left  and right amygdala compared with fear-
ful faces from another culture. Moreover, this “cultural tuning” of automatic 
neural responses was evident only for fearful faces. Th e fi ndings suggest height-
ened arousal to or vigilance for fear expressed by members of one’s own cultural 
group.  
 Empathy 
 Empathy refers to the capacity to understand and share the emotional states of 
others, which may provide a proximate mechanism for prosocial behaviors such 
as cooperation and altruism (de Waal, 2008). Both behavioral and brain stud-
ies show evidence that empathic concerns for others are strongly infl uenced by 
social relations between observers and targets. Johnson et al. (2002) found that 
white university students reported greater feelings of empathy for white com-
pared to black defendants, suggesting a bias in empathy for racial in-group mem-
bers. Recent brain imaging studies demonstrate that the racial bias in empathy 
occurs not only with black individuals but also with other racial groups. Xu et 
al. (2009) found that, when perceiving painful stimulation applied to Caucasian 
or Chinese faces, Caucasians and Chinese participants reported similar sub-
jective feelings of pain suff ered by racial in-group and out-group members.

However, empathic neural responses in the ACC decreased signifi cantly to racial 
out-group compared to in-group faces, and this was evident in both Caucasians 
and Chinese participants. Similarly, Avenanti et al. (2010) found that observ-
ing painful stimulation applied to the hands of racial in-group models elicited 
sensorimotor empathic responses in black and white individuals, whereas no 
such vicarious mapping of the pain occurred when perceiving racial out-group 
models. Moreover, the medial prefrontal activity in response to pain expressed 
by in-group relative to out-group members predicted greater empathy and altru-
istic motivation for racial in-group members (Mathur, Haradi, Lipke, & Chiao, 
2010). 
 It appears that multiple aspects of empathy for pain are modulated by racial 
intergroup relations. However, it should be noted that the bias in empathic neu-
ral responses does not take place just for specifi c racial groups, indicating that 
the bias in empathy does not simply arise from the skin color of a target person. 
Th e factor that essentially determines the bias in empathy is the group relation 
between an observer and a target; the concept of “social groups” is a product of 
social experiences and practices and appears to be common in diff erent socio-
cultural contexts. Th e current fi ndings suggest that culturally universal concepts 
of racial intergroup relations may play an important role in shaping the neural 
 activity underlying empathy. 
 CROSS-CULTURAL VARIATIONS IN THE 
PROCESSING OF ONESELF 
 Self-concept has been studied widely in philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience, 
and has been assigned with discrepant meanings in diff erent cultures. From the 
cognitive perspective, the self refers to an entity that provides a basis for percep-
tion of the outside world. However, self-concept varies greatly across sociocultural 
contexts, and the cultural variations in self-concept may generate consequences 
for other social cognitive processes. To date, most researchers have investigated 
cultural variations in self-concept in a framework proposed by social psycholo-
gists that diff erentiates between self-construals in Western and East Asian cul-
tural contexts (Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 1989). A basic assumption 
is that many Western cultures encourage the individualism that views people as 
entities who are independent of one another whereas many non-Western (e.g., 
East Asian) cultures emphasize the fundamental connectedness of human beings 
to each other. Consequently, Western cultures foster independent self-construals 
that view the self as an autonomous entity with a unique confi guration of internal 
attributes, one inclined to privilege self-focused attention and to organize behav-
iors primarily with reference to internal attributes. By contrast, East Asian cul-
tures emphasize interdependent self-construals that are sensitive to information 
related to signifi cant others and are inclined to privilege attention toward intimate 
others as much as to the self and to organize behaviors primarily with reference 
to others.

foundations of human social cognition
 Self-Face Recognition 
 Th e processing of self-related information is a key component of human social 
cognition. In the perceptual domain, self-related processing is manifested in 
self-face recognition, and recent research illustrates distinct cross-cultural dif-
ferences in the processing of one’s own face. Initial behavioral studies examined 
unique processes of self-face recognition by measuring reaction times (RTs) to 
self-face in diff erent tasks. Tong and Nakayama (1999) observed shorter RTs 
when searching for self-face compared to a stranger’s face among distractor faces. 
Keenan et al. (1999) found faster responses to self-face than to faces of famil-
iar or unfamiliar others in a face identifi cation task. Th e early observation of 
self-advantage in behavioral responses during face recognition was obtained in 
participants in a Western (American) cultural context and was explained by per-
ceptual mechanisms, such as robust representations for overlearned familiar faces 
(Tong & Nakayama, 1999). Subsequent research similarly found self-face advan-
tages in participants in an East Asian (Chinese) cultural context. However, when 
comparing RTs to self-face and a friend’s face in a face orientation judgment task 
between British and Chinese participants, it was found that the self-face advan-
tage was much more salient in British than in Chinese (Sui, Liu, & Han, 2009), 
consistent with the proposition that enhanced self-focused attention in individu-
als in Western cultural contexts facilitates self-face recognition, relative to those 
in Eastern cultural contexts. 
 Recent research proposed a social cognitive mechanism to connect the 
self-concept with behavioral responses to self-face. To test whether priming 
that constitutes a threat to one’s positive view of the self infl uences self-face 
recognition, Ma and Han (2010) fi rst asked participants to judge if a number 
of negative personal traits were appropriate to describe themselves in order to 
reduce the implicit positive association with the self. Th is self-concept threat 
priming may reduce the self-face advantage if the latter is facilitated by positive 
views of the self. Th ey found that, although RTs were shorter to the identifi ca-
tion of self-face compared to familiar faces in a control priming condition, the 
self-concept threat priming reduced the self-face advantage greatly, even leading 
to faster responses to familiar faces than to self-face. Th is fi nding supports the 
idea that self-face recognition may activate positive attributes in self-concept, 
which facilitates behavioral responses to self-face. In addition, Ma and Han 
(2010) found that the eff ect of self-concept threat priming on RTs to self-face 
was greater in Chinese than in American participants. Th is supports the idea 
that self-concept in individuals who grow up in Western cultural contexts resist 
external infl uences more strongly, relative to individuals who grow up in East 
Asian cultural contexts. 
 Cultural diff erences in self-face recognition were also evident when consider-
ing how social contexts modulate behavioral performance during self-face recog-
nition. Ma and Han (2009) fi rst tested if the self-face advantage can be reduced 
in Chinese participants in a social context with someone who is dominant in the 
social hierarchy. Th ey asked Chinese graduate students to identify orientations

of self-face intermixed with either their faculty advisor’s face or with the face of 
another faculty member. Interestingly, it was found that, although participants 
responded faster to self-face than to the faculty member’s face, they responded 
slower to self-face compared to the advisor’s face. To further assess if the self-face 
disadvantage (or the “boss eff ect”) was associated with negative evaluations from 
advisors that may constitute threats to self-esteem, Ma and Han quantifi ed the 
relation between social threats and RTs to self-face. Th ey found that diff erential 
RTs to self-face and advisor’s face correlated with individuals’ subjective ratings 
of fear of negative evaluations from the advisor. Although the fi ndings provide 
evidence that social threat in real social situations may infl uence self-face recogni-
tion in Chinese participants, one may predict that such an eff ect may be reduced 
in a Western cultural context in which self-concept depends on others’ opinions 
to a much lesser degree. Th is was tested in a follow-up study that replicated Ma 
and Han’s (2009) experiment in American participants. Liew et al. (2011) found 
that, unlike Chinese participants, European Americans did not show a “boss 
eff ect”; that is, they responded faster to self-face compared to their advisors’ faces. 
Moreover, diff erential RTs to self-face versus advisor’s face correlated with sub-
jective ratings of the advisor’s perceived social status. Th e comparison between 
the “boss eff ects” in Chinese and Americans indicates a strong cultural modula-
tion of self-face processing in social contexts. In addition, the fi ndings suggest 
that perception of self-face in social contexts is strongly infl uenced by threats to 
self-concept in Chinese cultural context but is modulated by general social dom-
inance in the American cultural context, suggesting that the very concept of a 
“boss” may be signifi cantly diff erent in relation to the self in Western and East 
Asian cultures. 
 Are neural correlates of self-face recognition infl uenced by sociocultural con-
texts? Early fMRI studies of self-face recognition explored the neural mechanisms 
that diff erentiated between the processing of self-face and the faces of familiar/
unfamiliar others, but did not consider cross-cultural variation of the underly-
ing neural substrates. Accumulating evidence now suggests that a widely distrib-
uted network is engaged during self-face recognition (Platek, Wathne, Tierney, 
& Th omson, 2008). For example, studies of American college students found 
increased activation in the right frontal cortex during self-face processing com-
pared to familiar famous face processing (Platek, Keenan, Gallup, & Mohamed, 
2004), and in the right inferior parietal lobule, inferior frontal gyrus, and inferior 
occipital gyrus when contrasting morphed face images containing more self than 
those containing more familiar others (Uddin, Kaplan, Molnar-Szakacs, Zaidel, 
& Iacoboni, 2005). Belgian college students also showed increased activity in the 
right frontal cortex and right anterior insula during perception of self-face versus 
a familiar face (Devue et al. 2007). Similarly, studies of Japanese college students 
found that perception of self-face versus unfamiliar faces increased activity in the 
right occipito-temporo-parietal junction, right frontal operculum, and the left  
fusiform gyrus (Sugiura et al., 2005). A recent fMRI study of Chinese college stu-
dents dissociated the functional signifi cance of the left  and right fusiform gyrus 
by showing evidence that the left  fusiform gyrus is sensitive to self-face physical 

80 
foundations of human social cognition
properties and the right fusiform gyrus is sensitive to self-face identity (Ma & 
Han, 2012). 
 Because these brain imaging studies respectively scanned participants in dif-
ferent cultural contexts, little can be known about the cross-cultural variations 
of neural correlates of self-face recognition without directly comparing diff erent 
cultural groups using the same procedure and task in the same study. Given that 
independent self-construals promote self-focused attention and interdependent 
self-construals stress one’s connection with others, there may be distinct neural 
mechanisms of self-face recognition in cultural contexts that facilitate diff erent 
self-construals. To test this, Sui et al. (2009) recorded event-related brain poten-
tials (ERPs) to self-face and a friend’s face from participants in Western (British) 
and East Asian (Chinese) cultural contexts. Th ey found that, in British partici-
pants, judgments of head orientations of their own face elicited a negative activity 
at 280–340 ms over the frontal-central area (N2) with larger amplitudes to self-face 
relative to a friend’s face. In contrast, Chinese participants showed larger N2 ampli-
tudes to a friend’s face compared to self-face. In addition, there was a signifi cant 
correlation between the self-advantage in behavioral responses and the diff eren-
tial N2 amplitudes to self-face versus a friend’s face: Th e larger the diff erential N2 
amplitudes to self-face versus a friend’s face, the greater the self-face advantage 
in RTs. As the anterior N2 is associated with deeper processing of faces to benefi t 
individuation of faces (Kubota & Ito, 2007), the culture-specifi c N2 modulation 
suggests that, relative to Chinese participants, British individuals with indepen-
dent self-construals may pay more attention to information about the self than 
about others. In contrast, Chinese participants with interdependent self-construals 
may assign high social salience to a friend’s face compared to self-face. 
 To directly test if culture-specifi c self-construals infl uence the neural substrates 
involved in self-face recognition, Sui and Han (2007) combined self-construal 
priming and self-face recognition tasks in an fMRI study. Self-construal priming 
refers to a procedure developed by Gardner et al. (1999) that asks participants to 
read essays including independent or interdependent pronouns (e.g., “I” or “We”). 
Behavioral performances suggest that one’s self-construal formed chronically by an 
individual culture can be temporarily shift ed by priming tasks of searching inde-
pendent or interdependent pronouns in essays (Gardner et al., 1999). If indepen-
dent self-construals facilitate self-face recognition, one may predict greater neural 
activity to self-face aft er independent compared to interdependent self-construal 
priming. Indeed, Sui and Han (2007) found that, although the neural activity in 
the right middle frontal cortex was increased to self-face compared to familiar 
faces, the right frontal activity diff erentiating between the self and familiar faces 
was enlarged by the independent relative to interdependent self-construal prim-
ing. Th e increased right frontal activity was also associated with faster responses 
to self-face than to familiar faces, suggesting that the neural correlates of self-face 
recognition can be modulated by temporary shift s of self-construals from one 
style to another. Together, studies that employed cross-cultural comparisons and 
self-construal priming indicate that self-perception is strongly aff ected by cultural 
patterns of independence or interdependence.

 Self-Related Memory 
 In addition to the fi ndings of cultural diff erences in self-face recognition, there 
has been increasing evidence for cross-cultural variation of self-related process-
ing in the memory domain. A well-known paradigm to study self-specifi c mem-
ory processes is a self-reference task developed by Rogers et al. (1977). Th is task 
fi rst asks participants to make judgments on whether a list of trait adjectives can 
describe the self or others. Aft er this encoding phase, participants have to rec-
ognize as many of the words as they can. A typical fi nding of this paradigm is 
that participants better remember self-descriptive traits than other-descriptive 
traits (the self-reference eff ect) (Klein, Loft us, & Burton, 1989). Interestingly, 
whereas Westerners showed the self-reference eff ect over close others, such as 
one’s mother and best friends (Heatherton et al., 2006; Klein et al., 1989), Chinese 
remembered equally well the trait adjectives associated with the self and close 
others (e.g., mother, Qi & Zhu, 2002; Zhu & Zhang, 2002). Wang and Conway 
(2004) also found that European Americans frequently focused on memories of 
personal experiences and placed a great emphasis on their feelings and personal 
roles in the memory events. In contrast, Chinese participants were more likely 
to describe memories of social and historical events and focused more on social 
interactions and the roles of other people. Th e fi ndings of these behavioral studies 
support the dissociation in memory processes between the self and close others in 
Western cultures but not in East Asian cultures. 
 Following the early behavioral studies, the self-reference task was used in fMRI 
research to explore the neural correlates of the self-reference eff ect and poten-
tial cross-cultural variation. Kelley et al. (2002) scanned American participants 
while they performed trait judgments on the self and a public person. It was found 
that, relative to judgments of a public person, self-judgments were associated with 
activation in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC); VMPFC activity 
associated with self-judgments was decreased relative to the resting state but was 
greater compared to that associated with public-person judgments. Th e fi nding of 
increased VMPFC activity during judgments of one’s own traits has been repeat-
edly demonstrated in subsequent studies in the Western cultural context (Northoff  
et al., 2006). VMPFC activity linked to self-trait judgments was even stronger than 
that associated with trait judgments of a close other (e.g., best friend) in American 
participants (Heatherton et al., 2006). Th e VMPFC may play an important role 
in coding self-relevance of stimuli, since trait words rated high versus low in 
self-relevance increased VMPFC activity (Moran, Macrae, Heatherton, Wyland, 
& Kelley, 2006) and VMPFC activity correlated with memory performances on 
recall of self-related trait words (Ma & Han, 2011 Macrae, Moran, Heatherton, 
Banfi eld, & Kelley, 2004).Th ese brain imaging fi ndings suggest a good paradigm 
for assessing the neural representation of the self in relation to others, one that 
may be useful for investigating cross-cultural variation of self-representation in 
the human brain. If, according to Markus and Kitayama (1991, 2010), the self is 
dissociated from close others in self-construals in many Western cultures, one 
would predict that the neural representation of the self in the VMPFC may be 

82 
foundations of human social cognition
separated from that of a close other. In contrast, neural representations of the self 
and close others may partially overlap in the VMPFC to mediate interdependent 
self-construals in East Asian cultural contexts. Th us, VMPFC activity related to 
trait judgments of the self and close others can be used to test the psychological 
model of cross-cultural variation of self-construals. 
 An early study tested this hypothesis by scanning Chinese individuals and 
English-speaking Wester individuals during trait judgments of the self, one’s 
mother, and a public person (Zhu, Zhang, Fan, & Han, 2007). Th e critical issue 
addressed in this study was whether the self and mother share neural representa-
tions in the VMPFC in individuals in the Chinese cultural context but are dissoci-
ated from each other in the VMPFC in individuals in the Western cultural context. 
A memory test aft er the scanning showed that Chinese participants remembered 
equally well the trait adjectives related to the self and mother, whereas Westerners 
remembered better the trait adjectives related to the self than those related to 
mother, replicating the fi ndings of the earlier studies (e.g., Qi & Zhu, 2002; Zhu & 
Zhang, 2002). In addition, although both Chinese and Westerners showed greater 
VMPFC activity to self- than public-person-judgments, Chinese participants 
also demonstrated stronger VMPFC activity to mother judgments compared to 
public-person judgments. Directly comparing self- and mother judgments did 
not show any signifi cant activation diff erences in the VMPFC, suggesting com-
parable neural representations of the self and mother in the VMPFC. In con-
trast, in Westerners, mother judgments failed to activate the VMPFC relative 
to public-person judgments, and self-judgments gave rise to increased VMPFC 
activation compared with mother judgments, indicating the hypothesized disso-
ciation between the self and mother in the VMPFC in Westerners. Th e results 
provide the fi rst evidence for cross-cultural variations in neural substrates under-
lying self representations in relation to close others and a neuroscience account 
of the psychological model of Western versus East Asian cultural diff erences in 
self-construals. 
 As the neural substrates of self-face recognition showed dynamic variations as a 
consequence of cultural value priming (Sui & Han, 2007), one may expect similar 
infl uences of cultural priming on the neural representation of one’s own personal-
ity traits — the mental aspects of self-concept. Specifi cally, for those with two cul-
tural systems in their minds (bicultural individuals), it is likely that self and close 
other representations may overlap in the VMPFC aft er East Asian cultural values 
are activated, whereas self and close others may be dissociated in the VMPFC 
aft er Western cultural values are activated. Indeed, Ng et al. (2010) showed that, 
aft er being primed with pictures of Chinese cultural icons, Westernized Chinese 
participants living in Hong Kong showed increased VMPFC to both the self and 
mother during the trait judgment task. However, aft er being primed with pictures 
of Western cultural icons, VMPFC activity to mother judgments was decreased, 
whereas VMPFC activity to self-judgments was enhanced. Th ese fi ndings pro-
vide evidence for dynamic cognitive and neural representations of the self in 
relation to close others in bicultural individuals. In addition, the fi nding of tem-
poral dynamic variations of neural representations of the self is consistent with

the observed diff erences in self-representations in Chinese and Westerners that 
refl ects the accumulated infl uences of cultural values and practice over time. 
 Cultural infl uences on neural representations of self-concept are also mani-
fested during the processing of general and contextual self-judgments. Chiao 
and colleagues (2009) scanned Japanese and Caucasian Americans during a 
general self-referential task that required responses to questions such as “In 
general, does this sentence describe you?” and a contextual self-referential task 
that required responses to questions such as “Does this sentence describe you 
when you are talking to your mother?” Although this study did not report diff er-
ences in the neural correlates of self-judgments between Japanese and Caucasian 
American participants, the authors classifi ed participants, in terms of self-report 
on the Singelis (1994) self-construal scale, into individualist and collectivist 
groups. It was found that individualists showed signifi cantly greater VMPFC 
activation for general self-descriptions relative to contextual self-descriptions, 
whereas collectivists demonstrated signifi cantly greater activation for contextual 
self-descriptions compared to general self-descriptions. Moreover, the degree 
of VMPFC response to self-judgments (contextual minus general) correlated 
positively with the degree of diff erential collectivism versus individualism. A 
follow-up study from the same group (Chiao et al., 2010) scanned bicultural par-
ticipants (e.g., Asian Americans) while they performed the general/contextual 
self tasks. Half of the participants were primed with cultural values of individu-
alism and half with cultural values of collectivism prior to self-judgments. Th e 
priming procedure consisted of a Sumerian warrior story task and a similari-
ties and diff erences with family and friends (SDFF) task (Trafi mow, Triandis, & 
Goto, 1991) that have been shown to infl uence self-construals. Th e bicultural 
participants primed with individualistic values showed increased activation in 
the VMPFC and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) during general relative to con-
textual self-judgments. In contrast, bicultural participants primed with collec-
tivistic values showed increased responses within the MPFC and PCC during 
contextual relative to general self-judgments. Th us, neural representations of a 
general self and a contextual self in the MPFC appear to be shaped by cultural 
values of individualism and collectivism. 
 Cross-cultural variations in other aspects of self-concept have been documented 
in social psychological research. For example, using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem 
Scale (Rosenberg, 1965), Schmitt and Allik (2005) reported higher levels of 
self-competence (i.e., feeling you are confi dent, capable, and effi  cacious) in indi-
vidualistic cultures than in collectivistic cultures, but higher levels of self-liking 
(i.e., feeling you are good, socially relevant, and maintain group harmony) in col-
lectivistic cultures than in individualistic cultures. However, to date, little is known 
about the neural correlates of self-esteem and potential cross-cultural variations, 
which should be investigated in the future. Taken together, both psychological 
and brain imaging studies have shown evidence for cross-variations in the cogni-
tive and neural processing of self-related information. Th e cultural infl uences on 
self-related processing take place in perceptual, memory, and social domains and 
show a coherent pattern. 

84 
foundations of human social cognition
 In summary, individualistic cultural contexts and cultural priming facilitates 
self-construals that emphasize the self as an independent entity, one that behaves 
in accordance with one’s own internal traits and thoughts and independently of 
others’ thoughts and feelings. In contrast, collectivistic cultural contexts and cul-
tural priming promote self-construals that view the self primarily in relation to 
others and particularly to close others. Th e observed cultural diff erences refl ect 
the consequences of social practices and interactions on how the human brain 
thinks of the self in relation to others.   
 HOW DO CROSS-CULTURAL VARIATIONS IN SOCIAL 
COGNITION AND THE SOCIAL BRAIN OCCUR? 
 Plasticity is an intrinsic property of the human brain, and it enables the nervous 
system to adapt to environmental pressures and experiences (Pascual-Leone 
et al., 2005). Th ere is robust evidence that brain function is modulated by sensory 
experiences. For example, the occipital cortex, which is commonly involved in 
visual processing in sighted humans, can be engaged in auditory processing—
such as being activated by heard sounds or words (Burton, Snyder, Diamond, 
& Raichle, 2002; Gougoux et al., 2009)—in blind individuals. VMPFC activity 
engaged in self-referential processing is also sensitive to sensory experiences, as 
sighted individuals showed VMPFC activation during self-judgments on visu-
ally but not aurally presented trait words, whereas congenitally blind individu-
als showed VMPFC activity during self-judgments on aurally presented trait 
words (Ma & Han, 2011). Auditory deprivation results in the recruitment of 
the primary auditory cortex in the processing of vibrotactile stimuli (Levanen, 
Jousmaki, & Hari, 1998) and sign language (Nishimura et al., 1999) in deaf 
humans. Th us, sensory experiences substantially shape the function of the pri-
mary sensory cortex to adapt to the processing of information from diff erent 
modalities. 
 Similarly, the brain regions involved in social cognition can be shaped pro-
foundly by social experiences due to the human rearing environment, human 
preference for social interactions, and developmental properties of the brain. 
First, humans create the most complex and varied social environments on earth, 
including massive social components and infl uences from extended families, 
communities (e.g., schools and institutes), and nation states (Wexler, 2011). 
People in diff erent social environments behave diff erently during social inter-
actions, and unique styles of social interactions also create distinct features of 
social contexts. Second, human infants show strong intentions to communicate 
and interact with others from early on. Within hours of birth, infants show inter-
est in looking at the human face (Goren, Sarty, & Wu, 1975). Within 2 days of 
birth, they imitate others’ actions using their tongues and heads (Meltzoff  & 
Moore, 1977). Th ird, most of these social cognitive processes engage the anterior 
frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, and these brain regions take the longest 
time to mature, giving them ample time to be infl uenced by cultural and personal

experiences. A longitudinal MRI study showed that gray matter density starts to 
decrease in the primary sensorimotor areas; such change then spreads over the 
frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, and this process lasts until the age of 21 
years (Gogtay et al., 2004). Th is provides a long time for the brain to adapt to 
varying sociocultural contexts. Fourth, brain regions engaged in social cogni-
tion undergo substantial functional and structural development during adoles-
cence. Prefrontal activity increases between childhood and adolescence and then 
decreases between early adolescence and adulthood, possibly related to structural 
development in this area (Blakemore, 2008). Finally, variation of brain structure 
and function may correlate directly with social behaviors. For example, orbital 
prefrontal cortex volume correlates with social cognitive competence (Powell, 
Lewis, Dunbar, Garc í a-Fi ñ ana, & Roberts, 2010), and amygdala volume corre-
lates with the size and complexity of social networks in adults (Bickart, Wright, 
Dautoff , Dickerson, & Barrett, 2011). 
 Together, the plasticity of the brain, importance of social interactions, and vari-
ety of social environments provide a framework for the human brain to develop 
specifi c neurocognitive strategies to aff ord social interactions in diff erent socio-
cultural contexts. Human cognition and the brain may also undergo modula-
tion by sociocultural contexts even during adulthood in order to adapt to new 
environments. Th is is possible because cultural priming studies have shown that 
temporary activation of specifi c cultural values and knowledge is able to modu-
late cognitive strategies (Hong, Morris, Chiu, & Benet-Martinez, 2000) and the 
underlying brain mechanisms that support them (Chiao et al., 2010; Ng et al., 
2010; Sui & Han, 2007). Th erefore, it is highly possible that functional reorganiza-
tion of the brain may occur in immigrants aft er moving to a new country with a 
diff erent cultural context and living there for an extended period of time. Shaping 
the neural activity associated with social cognition in diff erent cultural contexts 
is helpful for acculturation and in learning appropriate social behaviors in new 
sociocultural contexts.  
 IMPLICATIONS FOR MENTAL HEALTH 
 Th e fi ndings of cross-cultural variations in social cognition and the social brain 
have many implications for mental health. Each individual has his or her own 
cultural identity that defi nes oneself in relation to a cultural group. Cultural 
identity also infl uences how an individual thinks of and interacts with others in 
social environments. Th e infl uences of cross-cultural variations in social cogni-
tion on mental health may come from both general cultural values/norms and 
relationships between individuals. In most cases, people behave in accordance 
with their cultural values/norms and expect positive feedback from others dur-
ing social interactions. Th is is important for one’s mental health and well-being. 
Given the cross-cultural variation in how people think of the self and others, one 
has to adjust his or her own behaviors when moving to a new cultural context to 
get positive feedback from others. In addition, people must be aware of cultural

diff erences in the way people think of the self and others when trying to build 
relationship between themselves and others. 
 Cross-cultural variations in social cognition may be associated with specifi c 
mental disorders that lead to the impairment of normal social interactions. 
Heinrichs et al. (2006) found that people who hold collectivistic values are more 
accepting toward socially reticent and withdrawn behaviors than are those who 
hold individualistic values. Th ese cultural value diff erences may be associated 
with culture-specifi c social anxiety disorders that are characterized by persistent 
fear of social or performance situations in which a person is exposed to unfa-
miliar people or to possible scrutiny by others. Dinnel et al. (2002) found that a 
fear of displeasing or embarrassing others varies across people with diff erent self-
construals, being more likely to be expressed by individuals who construe them-
selves low on independence but high on interdependence. To date, it is unknown 
how cultural diff erence in neural substrates underlying self-construals is associ-
ated with cross-cultural variations of social anxiety disorder. Future research may 
combine cultural neuroscience and psychopathology approaches to investigate 
the cognitive and neural bases of mental problems such as social anxiety disor-
der. Findings of the neurocognitive bases of culture-specifi c mental disorders may 
help to develop culture-specifi c treatments.  
 FUTURE QUESTIONS 
 Many important fundamental questions regarding cross-cultural variations in 
social cognition and the social brain remain to be answered. From the neuro-
science perspective, the fi ndings of cross-cultural variation in social cognition 
and the social brain raise the question of the fl exibility of the cognitive system 
and its underlying neural substrates. Th e current cultural neuroscience studies 
mainly depend upon functional brain imaging techniques that are limited by spa-
tial resolution. Th e cultural neuroscience fi ndings suggest cross-cultural varia-
tions of large-scale neural networks (i.e., brain regions) but tell little about neural 
mechanisms at an individual neuron level, which is a challenge for future cultural 
neuroscience researchers to tackle. Another important fundamental question is 
whether and how culture and genes interact and lead to the co-determination of 
cognitive and neural processes involved in social cognition. Th is can be tested 
by comparing two subject groups with diff erent genotypes in diff erent cultural 
contexts. 
 Findings of cross-cultural variations in social cognition and the social brain 
also raise clinical issues regarding defi cits in social cognition and related treat-
ments. How are cultural diff erences in neurocognitive processing of social 
information related to other mental problems? Do we expect that the same neu-
rocognitive mechanisms mediate psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia 
and depression, across cultures? Finding answers to these questions is critical 
for the understanding of appropriate treatments for mental disorders in diff erent 
cultural contexts.

   Individuals with schizophrenia exhibit poor general information processing 
ability, which is thought to refl ect a generalized disruption of neuronal connec-
tivity in the brain (e.g., Heinrichs & Zakzanis, 1998; Hoff  et al., 1999; Karlsgodt 
et al., 2008; Taylor & Abrams, 1984). Th ese impairments have been shown to 
adversely aff ect functional outcomes, including social problem-solving ability 
and social skill acquisition (e.g., Green, 1996; Liddle, 2000). However, a critical 
question is whether anything particular is disrupted in how such individuals 
process social information. Before that question can be answered, one would 
need to answer the question of whether there is something special about social 
information processing per se. Some have argued that social intelligence is just 
“general intelligence applied to social situations” (Wechsler, 1958, p. 75). Th is 
chapter will review the literature illustrating a diff erent view, that social and 
emotional information processing is indeed distinct from nonsocial informa-
tion processing. 
 The chapter will primarily focus on the state of the field of basic social 
 cognitive neuroscience to set the stage for a focus on clinical populations; 
namely, social cognitive neuroscience in schizophrenia. To that end, we will 
focus on domains that may be particularly disrupted in individuals with 
schizophrenia, either based on typical clinical presentation (i.e., symptoma-
tology) or reliance of processing on distributed neural networks, which are 
evidently disrupted in schizophrenia (e.g., Bullmore, Frangou, & Murray, 
1997; Friston & Frith, 1995). Specifically, the focus will be on self- versus 
other-oriented information, emotion perception, intentional and incidental 
emotion regulation processes, and the tendency versus capacity to engage in 
such processes.

 THE SELF 
 Social cognitive neuroscience is increasingly revealing distinct networks for social 
types of information, diff erentiating between nonemotional (“cold”) cognition 
and social-emotional (“hot”) cognition. A basic premise assumed by the exis-
tence of a cohesive social cognition network is the ability to distinguish between 
 self  and  other . Th is would include existence of an intact sense of self to allow for 
self-referential knowledge, as well as the ability to understand others’ mental states 
as necessary for psychological states such as empathy, which is important for nor-
mative subsequent social interactions. Researchers have sought to reach a work-
able defi nition of  self , operationalizing both physical aspects of the self, including 
a sense of ownership and agency over one’s body, and psychological aspects of 
the self, including self-relevance of stimuli and “metarepresentation” of one’s own 
mental states (Gillihan & Farah, 2005; Vogeley et al., 2001). Such operational defi -
nitions allow for an empirical approach to the study of self-consciousness, a bur-
geoning area of inquiry within the fi eld of social cognitive neuroscience. 
 Sense of ownership involves recognition of being the one who is undergoing 
an experience, whose body is moving or responding, whether or not the move-
ment or response is voluntary (Gallagher, 2000). On the other hand, a sense 
of agency has been defi ned as the recognition of being the cause of an action, 
the sense of initiating and executing one’s own actions as opposed to another’s 
actions (Blakemore & Frith, 2003; Gallagher, 2000). To illustrate the diff erence 
between the two, a sense of ownership would be intact during passive or invol-
untary movements (such as when one’s arm is moved by someone else), whereas 
a sense of agency would, in this case, be violated (David, Newen, & Vogeley, 
2008). Both ownership and agency contribute to the self–other distinction in the 
physical domain critical to the experience of self-consciousness. However, sense 
of agency may be of particular relevance to patient experiences in schizophre-
nia, especially in regards to delusions of thought, mind, and/or action control 
(Gillihan & Farah, 2005). In a study by Spence and colleagues (1997), patients 
with delusions of control or loss of agency who erroneously attributed their 
actions to another showed abnormally high activation in right inferior parietal 
cortex (Spence et al., 1997). 
 According to a substantive review by Gillihan and Farah (2005), some physi-
cal aspects of the sense of self fail to show conclusive evidence of specialization, 
according to criteria of anatomical specifi city, functional uniqueness, and func-
tional independence. Specifi cally, they conclude that there does not appear to be a 
coherent or cohesive neural network for the holistic representation of the physical 
self. In addition, awareness and tracking of movement and position of the spa-
tial layout of one’s body seems to be represented in common with the layout and 
tracking of other people’s bodies. On the other hand, body part ownership shows 
evidence of functional independence and anatomical specifi city to the right supra-
marginal gyrus, as demonstrated by lesion studies (Gillihan & Farah, 2005). 
 Imaging studies have implicated several brain areas specifi cally in action 
ownership, or the sense of agency, beyond those regions of the motor system

(i.e., premotor cortex [PMC], supplementary motor area [SMA] and pre-SMA, 
and the cerebellum) commonly activated by planned, imagined, or actual motor 
activity. As demonstrated in studies utilizing imagined and actual self-action com-
pared to imagined or actual experimenter or other action, these regions include 
anterior and posterior insula, posterior inferior parietal cortex, dorsolateral pre-
frontal cortex (dlPFC), and the posterior segment of the superior temporal sulcus 
(pSTS; David et al., 2008; Farrer & Frith, 2002; Jeannerod, 2004; Leube et al., 2003; 
Powell, Macrae, Cloutier, Metcalfe, & Mitchell, 2009; Ruby & Decety, 2001). In 
particular, Farrer and Frith (2002) suggest that the anterior insula plays a role 
in the elaboration of an image of the body in space and in time. In addition, the 
insula may be a site for the integration of multimodal sensory signals associated 
with voluntary movements, which are attended to during self-attribution. Th e 
inferior parietal cortex, in contrast, may be a site for the elaboration of inter-
nal representations of the external world and one’s interactions with it, to then 
represent movements in an allocentric (as opposed to egocentric) coding system 
that can be applied to the actions of others, as well as to the self (Farrer & Frith, 
2002). 
 More recent studies have begun to engage multiple elements thought to be 
involved in the construction of self-consciousness to begin to deconstruct how 
such elements are organized and interact in the brain. For example, David and 
colleagues utilized a virtual ball-tossing game to simulate agency versus observing 
another person as agent of action from both a fi rst- and third-person perspective 
(David et al., 2006). No signifi cant neural interactions between agency and per-
spective taking were observed, although there was an overlap of activity in medial 
prefrontal regions associated with representations of one’s own perspective and 
actions. Finally, few studies to date have investigated the functional relationship 
between regions during sense of agency to identify neural networks in support 
of the creation of self. In one recent study, David and colleagues (2007), utiliz-
ing a psychophysiological interaction (PPI) method, found enhanced functional 
connectivity between posterior inferior parietal cortex and a region of occipito-
temporal cortex (also known as the extrastriate body area) during judgments of 
agency. Both regions were more active when visual feedback was incongruent to 
the subjects’ own executed movements, indicating involvement in distinguishing 
whether actions are caused by oneself or by another person (David et al., 2007). 
 In terms of the psychological aspects of  self, it is easy to intuit that the man-
ner in which individuals process self-relevant information and self-knowledge 
may be distinct from that of other types of information, including information 
about other people and their mental states. However, capturing the nature of 
that distinctive processing within an experimental setting has proved to be a 
challenge, as evidenced by the wide range of task paradigms utilized and their 
somewhat disparate fi ndings (e.g., Gillihan & Farah, 2005; Lombardo et al., 
2009). However, a growing body of literature continues to investigate whether 
a specialized neural system in the brain may support self-referential informa-
tion processing. Th is type of information might include self-face identifi ca-
tion, conceptual representations of self, self-evaluation, and self-referential 

96

emotions (Kircher et al., 2000; Morita et al., 2008; Platek, Keenan, Gallup, & 
Mohamed, 2004; Platek, Th omson, & Gallup, 2004; Powell et al., 2009; Zinck, 
2008). Although overlapping in many ways with studies of the physical self, 
self-identifi cation has generally been viewed as a psychological self-oriented 
process and has been investigated in a variety of ways. For example, studies 
using morphed facial images require self–other discrimination from pictures of 
the self morphed to varying degrees with famous, familiar, or unfamiliar faces. 
Neuropsychological case studies using these task paradigms have found evi-
dence for right hemisphere specialization for self-identifi cation (reviewed in 
Gillihan & Farah, 2005). A left -hand advantage in reaction time (implicating 
right hemisphere dominance) for self-face recognition has also been demon-
strated, with the speed of recognition further facilitated by multimodal sensory 
self-primes (i.e., exposure to one’s own body odor and seeing and hearing one’s 
own name; Platek, Th omson, et al., 2004). 
 Imaging studies have sought to further localize self-identifi cation processing. 
A common fi nding has been involvement of frontal regions, especially right infe-
rior frontal gyrus (IFG), using morphed (e.g., Kircher et al., 2000) and passive 
(e.g., Kaplan, Aziz-Zadeh, Uddin, & Iacoboni, 2008; Platek, Keenan, et al., 2004) 
self-face identifi cation, self-face evaluation (Morita et al., 2008), and self-voice 
recognition (Kaplan et al., 2008). 
 Conceptual knowledge of one’s own personality and traits has been stud-
ied extensively, oft en via semantic self-labeling tasks contrasting judgments of 
self with judgments of famous or unknown others, and has been shown to be 
subserved primarily by medial PFC (mPFC; e.g., Fossati et al., 2003; Kelley et 
al., 2002; Powell et al., 2009). In a recent review, Lieberman (2010) noted that 
mPFC activity was observed in 94% of studies on self-knowledge. A compre-
hensive meta-analysis by Van Overwalle (2009) revealed that, more specifi cally, 
the ventral portion of mPFC (vmPFC) was engaged in 85% of studies explor-
ing the representation, evaluation, or description of the self. Th e Lieberman 
(2010) review further revealed that the contiguous regions of the posterior cin-
gulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PC) were also represented in 63% of such stud-
ies on self-knowledge, and dorsal medial PFC (dmPFC) appeared in 53% of the 
studies. 
 Taken together, neuroimaging research suggests that the construction of 
the “self” is based on a collection of functionally independent, physically and 
psychologically based constituents involving distinct mental operations dis-
tributed throughout the brain, rather than on a unitary cognitive system (see 
Figure 4.1). Although the anterior insula seems to play a critical role in the sense 
of agency (e.g., Farrer & Frith, 2002), a number of other aspects of self seem 
to implicate mPFC, including conceptual judgments about one’s personality 
(Lieberman, 2010), autobiographical memory (Calarge, Andreasen, & O’Leary, 
2003; Maguire, 2001), and self-thought monitoring (Mason et al., 2007). Such 
fi ndings may indicate a general role for mPFC (and related midline cortical 
regions) as subserving a unique set of cognitive operations engaged by “the self,” 
broadly construed.

 UNDERSTANDING OTHERS 
 Many experimental investigations of the  self  rely on contrasts to conditions that 
reference the  other (e.g., imagining another’s actions, third-person perspective tak-
ing, and other-oriented information processing). Both self- and other processing 
requires the metacognitive ability to think about mental states, such as thoughts, 
beliefs, desires, and intentions, and make inferences about them in oneself and 
others. Such inferences can then be used to make predictions about the behavior of 
others. Th is is generally referred to as  theory of mind (ToM; Premack & Woodruff , 
1978) or  mentalizing . Closely following the ability to understand other minds is 
the ability to relate to the mental states of others with some personal relevance 
or  empathy  (e.g., Derntl et al., 2010; Gallup & Platek, 2002; Keenan & Wheeler, 
2002; Preston & de Waal, 2002). Clearly, these are highly intertwined abilities: By 
rendering the behavior of others comprehensible and predictable, both are critical 
for eff ective interpersonal relationships and normative social behavior (although 
see also Zahavi, 2008). 
 Researchers have utilized a variety of experimental paradigms to establish the 
neurobiological basis of ToM, largely driven by investigations of autism. Early 
behavioral work with children utilized false-belief tasks in which the observer 
knows more than the characters in a play and must model the character’s perspec-
tive, which is diff erent from their own, to answer questions about the story cor-
rectly (e.g., Baron-Cohen, Frith, & Leslie, 1985). Such a task requires awareness

that diff erent people can have diff erent beliefs about the same situation, and this 
awareness can guide predictions of their subsequent behavior. Developmental 
psychologists have shown that children begin to successfully complete simple 
or “fi rst-order” ToM tasks around age 2, and most do so reliably by age 4 (e.g., 
Bretherton & Beeghly, 1982; Wimmer & Perner, 1983; and see  Lyons & Koenig, 
2013, Chapter 1, this volume ). 
 More developmentally advanced or “higher-order” mentalizing has also been 
explored behaviorally, via tasks that require attribution of more complex mental 
states (e.g., recursive thinking, double bluff , white lie), subtle social reasoning 
(e.g., recognition of irony, sarcasm, humor, or faux pas), and nuanced under-
standing of motivation and intention (e.g., use of pretend play, deception, and 
persuasion). Such studies have utilized live action plays (Baron-Cohen, 1989) 
and short stories or vignettes (e.g., Happ é , 1994) to directly compare among 
diff erent levels and types of “mind-reading” or social reasoning ability. Autistic 
children who successfully complete simpler ToM tasks are oft en severely 
impaired at these higher level tasks. Similar studies have been conducted with 
patients with damage to the orbital frontal cortex (OFC; in contrast to patients 
with dlPFC damage), with similar results (e.g., Stone, Baron-Cohen, & Knight, 
1998). 
 Following this line of work, social cognitive neuroscientists have investigated 
the neural basis for simple and more complex ToM abilities in tasks utilizing 
vignettes (e.g., Fletcher et al., 1995; Saxe & Powell, 2006), cartoons (Gallagher 
et al., 2000), geometric shape animations depicting social interactions (e.g., 
Gobbini et al., 2007), and more active engagement in third-person perspective 
taking and mental state attribution via creation of stories about strangers (e.g., 
Calarge et al., 2003). Such studies have demonstrated activity in several diff er-
ent brain regions, including dmPFC, vmPFC, PCC/PC, temporo-parietal junc-
tion (TPJ), pSTS, and the anterior temporal cortex (aTC; see Figure 4.2) (see also 
Farrer & Frith, 2002; Morita et al., 2008; Platek, Keenan, et al., 2004). 
 In a substantive review, Carrington and Bailey (2009) considered whether task 
design and presentation modality (e.g., verbal vs. nonverbal; explicit vs. implicit 
instructions) explain the somewhat heterogeneous and widely distributed ana-
tomical regions implicated in ToM. However, they concluded that methodologi-
cal variability does not entirely account for the variation in fi ndings. Rather, they 
suggest that ToM activates an integrated functional network involving several dis-
tinct core (consistently activated) and peripheral (activated depending on specif-
ics of the task) brain regions contributing to ToM. Core regions were identifi ed 
as mPFC/OFC, STS, TPJ, and PCC/PC (see also Frith & Frith, 2006; Gallagher 
& Frith, 2003; Siegal & Varley, 2002). Recruitment of neural systems subserv-
ing other elements of cognition, such as autobiographical memory (e.g., Calarge 
et al., 2003) or executive control (e.g., Saxe, Schulz, & Jiang, 2006), may also come 
on line as contributing but dissociable peripheral processes, depending on the 
 specifi c ToM task. 
 Based on a meta-analysis of over 200 functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) studies of social cognition, Van Overwalle (2009) further narrowed the

Th e Social Cognitive Brain

core system for ToM processing to two primary regions: TPJ and mPFC. Th at 
analysis found that the primary distinction between mPFC and TPJ activation 
was that identifi cation and representation of temporary mental states, such as 
goals, intentions, and desires of other people, engages the TPJ, especially for 
nonverbal material, whereas inferences about more enduring dispositions or 
traits of others and the self engage the mPFC. Temporary states can also activate 
mPFC, and this is perhaps driven by the presence of a verbal component or 
the necessity of spontaneous judgments of enduring states (spontaneous trait 
inferences). 
 Indeed, although the majority of studies have implicated mPFC in self-knowledge 
(see Lieberman, 2010; Van Overwalle, 2009), this region has also been shown to be 
involved in semantic judgments about personally close others (e.g., Krienen, Tu, 
& Buckner, 2010) and similar others (e.g., Mitchell, Banaji, & Macrae, 2005), per-
haps indicating a broader role for this region in representing socially or emotion-
ally relevant information about another person (Gallagher & Frith, 2003; Saxe & 
Powell, 2006). However, Mitchell and colleagues (2006) further dissociated mPFC 
functioning in regard to similar others with the fi nding that vmPFC responds to 
mentalizing about a similar other, whereas dmPFC was diff erentially involved in 
mentalizing about a dissimilar other (Mitchell, Macrae, & Banaji, 2006). In fact, 
dmPFC, in particular, is most oft en associated with thinking about the mental 
states of others (e.g., Lieberman, 2010).

 Nevertheless, there is evidence of both overlapping and nonoverlapping 
regions of activation associated with  self and  other (especially similar other) pro-
cessing (e.g., Frith & Frith, 2006; Rabin, Gilboa, Stuss, Mar, & Rosenbaum, 2009; 
Saxe, Moran, Scholz, & Gabrieli, 2006; Vogeley et al., 2001). Th ese fi ndings sug-
gest that  other -oriented processing integrally involves  self- processing, such that 
neural architecture implicated in processing knowledge about the self is likewise 
called upon when processing knowledge about others (e.g., Platek, Keenan et al., 
2004). Th ese fi ndings are in line with a  simulation theory of ToM (e.g., Gallese & 
Goldman, 1998), which posits that perceivers use knowledge about themselves 
and refer to their own past experiences to infer the mental states of others (see 
also Apperly, 2008). 
 Th is line of thinking may implicate the putative “mirror neuron system,” which 
is thought by some investigators to be a distributed neural system in humans 
for action understanding.  Mirror neurons were so named due to fi ndings from 
research in nonhuman primates that individual neurons in PMC fi re not only 
during performance of coordinated, goal-oriented action, but also during obser-
vation of another performing these actions, suggestive of an overlap between per-
ception and execution of action (Iacoboni, 2009). In humans, a frontal-parietal 
network including posterior ventrolateral PFC (comprising posterior IFG and 
ventral PMC) and anterior inferior parietal lobule (IPL) has been suggested as the 
site for a mirror neuron system (see Figure 4.2; Iacoboni et al., 1999; Lieberman, 
2010; see also Jeannerod, 2004). To be sure, the research on mirror neurons is 
extensive, and this complex phenomenon is only briefl y described here. However, 
the key question raised by the possibility of a mirror neuron system in humans 
is whether automatic imitative processes underlie biological motion detection, 
which may in turn underlie, at least in part, ToM processing. Th at is, ToM abili-
ties may build on the capacity to recognize biological motion and goal-directed 
action, which appears much earlier developmentally and has been shown to be 
associated with pSTS activity (Lieberman, 2007). pSTS activity may thus support 
ToM processing via perception and representation of the intentions and goals of 
others implied by perceived action cues (e.g., Allison, Puce, & McCarthy, 2000; 
Gobbini et al., 2007). 
 By most accounts then, the mentalizing and mirror neuron systems are largely 
anatomically distinct and functionally dissociable, although they may interact 
in some way to aid collectively in social cognitive processes (Van Overwalle & 
Baetens, 2009). Th e precise nature of this interaction is not yet clear. Van Overwalle 
(2009) posits that a key component of early social information processing is the 
perception of goal-directed behavior, which is supported by two interactive pro-
cesses. First is the perception of biological information (e.g., human faces, bodies, 
and movements) via specialized face (i.e., fusiform face area; FFA), body (extras-
triate body area; EBA), and biological motion (pSTS) regions, followed by engage-
ment of the mirror system, which identifi es the goals behind these behaviors. A 
transition from the mirror to the mentalizing system may occur when mental 
state attributions from observation of body part and whole body motion are con-
sciously deliberated (e.g., when participants are explicitly instructed to deliberate

on the intentions of actors) and when such a focus is triggered by motions that are 
contextually inconsistent, implausible, or pretended. Th e latter may require more 
elaborative inferencing, perhaps beyond the purview of the mirror system (Van 
Overwalle & Baetens, 2009). 
 Spunt and Lieberman (2012) sought to directly test how these distinct systems 
interact in the brain during social cognition, specifi cally in regards to emotion 
recognition. Th ey developed a paradigm requiring, in one condition, partici-
pants to identify facial expressions, hypothesized to engage the human mirror 
neuron system via automatic facial mimicry (Niedenthal, Mermillod, Maringer, 
& Hess, 2010). Another condition required mental state attributions to be made 
via causal emotion judgments, hypothesized to activate the mentalizing system. 
As predicted, explicit emotion recognition was associated with core regions of the 
mirror neuron system, whereas explicit mental state attribution activated areas of 
the mentalizing system. Furthermore, frontal mirror system regions (i.e., bilateral 
posterior IFG) demonstrated functional connectivity with mentalizing regions 
(i.e., dm/vmPFC, PCC/PC, bilateral TPJ, and left  aTC), with mirror region activ-
ity preceding mentalizing region activity temporally. Th ese fi ndings suggest that 
the two systems may work in concert, with mirror activity informing mentaliz-
ing activity, to enable effi  cient and comprehensive emotional (and, by extension, 
social cognitive) processing. 
 Th e reference to emotion recognition in the preceding study highlights the fact 
that emotion understanding is an integral component of normal social cognition. 
Although eff ective emotional appraisals occur automatically for most of us, such 
judgments fi rst require that multiple stages of complex information processing 
occur, several of which show evidence of disruption in individuals with schizo-
phrenia (e.g., Karlsgodt et al., 2008) and warrant further discussion in terms of 
contributions from social cognitive neuroscience. 
 EMOTION 
 In a discussion of emotion within a social cognitive neuroscience framework, it is 
helpful to conceptualize emotion processing as occurring in a hierarchical stream, 
beginning with emotion perception—including perception of one’s own emotions 
and that of others—and ending with regulation of one’s emotions, which may 
occur intentionally with awareness or incidentally without awareness. Although 
a universally accepted defi nition of emotion may be diffi  cult to fi nd (e.g., Ekman, 
1992; Panksepp, 2007; Russel, 2003), most researchers agree that for a stimulus 
to be appraised as having emotional or aff ective content, it must be salient and 
self-signifi cant (e.g., Campos, Frankel, & Camras, 2004; LeDoux, 2000). Emotion 
perception cues us in to dangers and threats from our environment and those 
around us and facilitates the maintenance and enhancement of pleasurable or 
otherwise favorable experiences and relationships. Identifi cation of emotion from 
facial expressions is a primary example of perception of emotion in others, which 
itself requires many levels of visual perceptual ability that occur on both conscious 

102 
foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
and unconscious levels, including the basic ability to process faces. Once an emo-
tion is generated, it can be regulated through various distinct mechanisms that 
occur at diff erent times in the emotion-generative process. Emotion regulation 
can serve many aims, including the down-regulation or up-regulation of an emo-
tion. For example, during an altercation involving intense anger, eff ective emotion 
regulation allows one to down-regulate feelings of anger and express it in a more 
socially appropriate manner. In this way, such a process is adaptive and facilitates 
mood regulation and social interaction. 
 Face Perception 
 Human faces are essential for social interaction and communication and uniquely 
equipped to convey an abundance of information from person to person. As such, 
face perception is one of the most highly developed of human visual perceptual 
skills. Extensive research has been dedicated to understanding how the brain pro-
cesses faces, with a focus on facial representations as distinct from other object 
representations, and distinct neuronal pathways involved in the perception and 
appraisal of various types of information conveyed by faces. 
 Th at faces are processed diff erently than other types of stimuli and that such pro-
cessing is supported by a specialized neural system in the brain is well established. 
In human imaging studies, the perception of faces has been reliably associated 
with activity in a region of the lateral fusiform gyrus, so much so that many have 
come to refer to this region as the fusiform “face” area (FFA; Halgren et al., 1999; 
Kanwisher, McDermott, & Chun, 1997; McCarthy, Puce, Belger, & Allison, 1999). 
Other regions of visual extrastriate cortex that appear to be selective for faces 
include the inferior occipital gyrus, also known as the occipital face area (OFA; 
Gauthier, Skudlarski, Gore, & Anderson, 2000; Halgren et al., 1999; Rossion et al., 
2003; Sergent, Ohta, & MacDonald, 1992), as well as pSTS (Engell & Haxby, 2007; 
Haxby, Hoff man, & Gobbini, 2000; Hooker et al., 2003). Th ese regions of activa-
tion are usually bilateral with right hemispheric dominance (see Figure 4.3). 
 Th ese three bilateral regions of occipitotemporal cortex (OFA, FFA, pSTS) may 
participate diff erentially in the diff erent aspects of face perception (Haxby et al., 
2000). Specifi cally, invariant aspects of faces (i.e., for identity recognition) may 
be processed via FFA, whereas changeable aspects (e.g., in support of expression 
and eye gaze detection) may be processed via pSTS, and early perception of facial 
features output to both of these regions occurs via OFA. Accordingly, FFA activa-
tion seems to be most prominent when comparing response to visual perception 
of faces to nonsense stimuli, scrambled faces, or other nonface objects utilizing 
passive viewing tasks or tasks in which attention is focused on the nonvariant 
aspects of the facial confi guration (e.g., Kanwisher et al., 1997; McCarthy, Puce, 
Gore, & Allison, 1997; Sergent et al., 1992). Conversely, greater pSTS is elicited 
during tasks designed to direct attention to dynamic aspects of faces, such as 
direction of eye gaze or facial expression, rather than identity (Cloutier, Turk, & 
Macrae, 2008; Engell & Haxby, 2007; Hoff man & Haxby, 2000; Winston, Henson, 
www.ebook3000.com

Th e Social Cognitive Brain

Fine-Goulden, & Dolan, 2004). Hooker et al. (2003) further demonstrated 
increased STS activation specifi cally for analysis of gaze cues that provide socially 
meaningful spatial information (in contrast with arrows that provide spatial infor-
mation and with eye motion without spatial information; Hooker et al., 2003; see 
also Puce et al., 1998). Finally, support for the role of OFA as a visual processing 
“entry point” for face information has been supported by fMRI adaptation studies 
(e.g., Fox, Moon, Iara, & Barton, 2009). 
 Although these areas are clearly involved in face processing, not all fi ndings 
suggest the same degree of functional specifi city. For example, Ganel and col-
leagues (2005) found signifi cant FFA activity when subjects made judgments of 
facial expressions, and FFA was sensitive to variations in expression even when 
attention was directed to identity (Ganel, Valyear, Goshen-Gottstein, & Goodale, 
2005; see also Fox et al., 2009). Other researchers have suggested that, rather than 
specialization only for face recognition, these face-responsive regions may be spe-
cialized for visual expertise, responding to objects perceived as unique individuals 
rather than category exemplars (e.g., Gauthier et al., 2000; Rhodes & McLean, 
1990; Tarr & Gauthier, 2000; see also Chao, Martin, & Haxby, 1999; Spangler, 
Schwarzer, Korell, & Maier-Karius, 2010). In addition, as highlighted previously, 
right STS is usually associated with the perception of any biological movement 
or human action, and whether these are distinguishable to include specialty to 
faces is not clear (e.g., Bonda, Petrides, Ostry, & Evans, 1996). In fact, Saxe and

colleagues (2004) found that right pSTS activity served a more generalized repre-
sentation of observed intentional actions, not face action per se (Saxe, et al., 2004; 
see also Hein & Knight 2008). Finally, Rossion et al. (2003) found that, rather than 
receiving face-sensitive inputs from the OFA in a purely feed-forward hierarchical 
fashion, “feedback connections may facilitate re-entrant integration of FFA (and, 
presumably, STS) with OFA, allowing for normal face perception even in indi-
viduals with damages to right hemisphere inferior occipital cortex.” 
 In summary, although advances have been made in our understanding of the 
neural underpinnings of face perception, more research is needed to elucidate the 
details of this complex system. What is clear, however, is that effi  cient process-
ing of faces is reliant upon multiple interconnected brain regions acting in an 
orchestrated fashion. Highlighting the importance of connectivity between neu-
ronal regions in face processing beyond a “core” system, predominantly active 
and perhaps selective for faces, an “extended” system may also contribute to face 
perception, although not exclusively involved in it (Haxby et al., 2000). Th ese 
extended regions may be recruited, depending on the type of face perception, 
to extract meaning from faces and process the signifi cance of the information 
gleaned. For example, perception of emotional facial expressions may activate the 
distributed neural system for emotion processing, including limbic regions such 
as the amygdala, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), anterior insula, and 
ventral striatum (see Figure 4.3; Ishai, Schmidt, & Boesiger, 2005). 
 Emotional Expressions 
 Similar to primary face processing, the ability to display, recognize, and respond 
to facial expressions is a fundamental aspect of sociality in humans, critical for 
social information exchange (e.g., Ekman, 1993; Darwin, 1872/1998). Th e neural 
network for emotional faces has generally been investigated in imaging studies 
that use comparisons of blank, expressionless, or neutral faces to faces displaying 
an expression of emotion. A recent meta-analysis of 100 neuroimaging studies 
utilizing emotional face stimuli found that several brain regions were consistently 
activated. In addition to face-responsive regions in extrastriate occipital cortex, 
the amygdala was the area of greatest overlap, followed by regions of inferior tem-
poral cortex, mPFC, and OFC (Sabatinelli et al., 2011). 
 Amygdala activation has most oft en been associated with response to fearful but 
also neutral faces (e.g., Kesler-West et al., 2001; Whalen et al., 2001), regardless 
of spatial frequency of the facial stimuli or location in the visual fi eld (Morawetz, 
Baudewig, Treue, & Dechent, 2011). More generally, an abundance of literature 
points to the amygdala as playing a critical role in the automatic evaluation of 
both salient and ambiguous sensory inputs and then coordinating subsequent 
neurophysiological responses to these (Holland & Gallagher, 1999; LeDoux, 2000; 
Posner, 2001), possibly by biasing cognition toward perceived stimuli with poten-
tial emotional and social signifi cance (Adolphs, 2003; Vuilleumier & Pourtois, 
2007). For example, Critchley and colleagues (2000) compared activation to

Th e Social Cognitive Brain

fearful and angry faces when explicitly (judging expression task) versus implic-
itly (judging facial gender task) attended to, and found that implicit processing 
involved greater amygdala activation. Similarly, Anderson and colleagues (2003) 
found that directing attention away from disgust and fear faces modulated regions 
involved in processing disgust (i.e., insula) but not amygdala; rather, amygdala 
activation increased. Th ese fi ndings suggest that when such stimuli are not 
attended to, amygdala processing becomes more diff use to threat in general or 
attuned to the task of resolving ambiguity. 
 Selective involvement of other brain regions for experience of emotion in a 
category-specifi c manner has also been investigated with varying degrees of con-
sistency. Generally, fi ndings implicate a network of predominantly anterior limbic 
regions including the amygdala, ventral striatum, ACC, and anterior insula (see 
Figure 4.3; Kesler-West et al., 2001; Lane, Fink, Chau, & Dolan, 1997; Phillips, 
2006; Sprengelmeyer, Rausch, Eysel, & Przuntek, 1998; Vytal & Hamann, 2010). 
In line with elements of the face processing model described above (e.g., Haxby et 
al., 2000; Hein & Knight, 2008), Peelen and colleagues (2010) found that mPFC 
and left  STS activation was associated with presentation of fi ve diff erent emotions 
(fear, anger, disgust, happiness, sadness) in category-specifi c patterns of intensity 
but independent of modality of sensory input (i.e., facial expressions, body move-
ments, or vocal intonations) or emotional intensity of the stimuli (see also Lane, 
Reiman, Ahern, Schwartz, & Davidson, 1997). Th ey suggested that these “higher 
level” brain areas (also implicated in mental state attribution and ToM) represent 
emotions at an integrated, abstract, supramodal level and thus play a key role in 
understanding and categorizing others’ emotional mental states. 
 Intentional Emotion Regulation 
 Emotions play a powerful role in both facilitating and, in some cases, hindering, 
individuals’ experiences and social interactions. Th us, the regulation of emotion 
is critical to functioning. For example, eff ective emotion regulation may decrease 
experiences of negative emotion during stressful times or help to control socially 
inappropriate expressions of emotion during experiences of anger. Gross (1998a) 
defi ned emotion regulation as “processes by which individuals infl uence which 
emotions they have, when they have them, and how they experience and express 
these emotions” (p. 275). Emotion regulation can take a variety of forms, includ-
ing both intentional and incidental processing. During intentional emotion regu-
lation, individuals engage in eff ortful attempts to regulate their emotions. Th ese 
attempts can impact experiences of emotion, expressive behavior, or physiological 
responding. 
 Emotions can be conceptualized as response tendencies that are generated aft er 
a stimulus is determined to be relevant and/or salient. Emotion regulation strate-
gies can aff ect the course of the emotion-generative process at various time points. 
Gross (1998a) takes a process-oriented approach to describing fi ve diff erent 
types of emotion regulation: situation selection, situation modifi cation, attention 

106 
foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation. More specifi cally, situ-
ation selection refers to the individual’s choosing of the situation in which he or 
she fi nds him- or herself. Situation modifi cation is the process of changing that 
situation such that its emotional impact is changed. Of note, diff erent situations 
are characterized by diff erences in their complexity (e.g., how many aspects of the 
situation can be modifi ed) and the extent to which they can be changed. Attention 
deployment signifi es the individual’s selection of which aspect of a given situation 
to focus on. For example, an individual might choose to focus on a more nega-
tive or a more positive aspect of a situation. Cognitive change is the selection of 
which meaning is assigned to a situation. In each situation, many diff erent mean-
ings could exist, with each potentially leading to diff erent emotional responses. 
For example, an individual might reappraise the meaning of a situation or his 
or her own ability to deal with the situation. Finally, response modulation is the 
process of altering emotional response tendencies once they have been evoked. 
For example, these strategies might reduce or intensify an emotional experience 
or expression. 
 Emotion regulation processes can be separated into antecedent- and 
response-focused strategies (Gross 1998b). Situation selection, situation modifi -
cation, attention deployment, and cognitive change comprise antecedent-focused 
strategies, which alter the input to the emotion-generative process at an early 
stage. Conversely, response modulation is a type of response-focused strategy 
that takes place at a later stage in the process to alter the emotional response. In 
order to examine diff erential impacts of antecedent- versus response-focused 
strategies, Gross (1998b) compared reappraisal (antecedent-focused) and 
suppression (response-focused). Specifi cally, the study examined the eff ects 
of these strategies on emotional experience, expressive behavior, and sym-
pathetic activation during fi lm clips intended to elicit disgust. Participants 
were instructed to reappraise, suppress, or watch during the fi lm. Reappraisal 
resulted in decreased self-reported subjective experience of disgust, as well as 
reduced behavior expressing emotion. Reappraisal had no eff ect on sympa-
thetic activation. Suppression was associated with decreased expressive behav-
ior and increased sympathetic activation. However, participants did not report 
changes in experience of disgust while engaging in suppression. Although both 
groups exhibited smaller increases in expressive behavior (disgust, emotional 
intensity, and activity) compared to the group that simply watched the fi lm, 
ratings of disgust and emotional intensity of expressive behavior were lower 
in the suppression group. Interestingly, suppression failed to alter the subjec-
tive experience of emotion, despite aff ecting both expression and sympathetic 
activation. 
 Numerous studies have now examined neural substrates of reappraisal using 
fMRI. Although results vary from study to study, the most common activations 
associated with reappraising are in dorsolateral, ventrolateral, and dorsomedial 
PFC (e.g., Goldin, McRae, Ramel, & Gross, 2008; Ochsner, Bunge, Gross, & 
Gabrieli, 2002). Reductions in activation are commonly seen in the amygdala and 
other limbic regions (see Figure 4.4). Moreover, lateral PFC activations have been

seen in multiple studies to correlate inversely with both self-reported distress and 
with limbic activity. 
 One study compared the neural bases of strategies that diff er in how and when 
they infl uence the emotion-generative process. Specifi cally, Goldin and colleagues 
(2008) examined activation among brain regions involved in cognitive reappraisal 
(early in the process) versus expressive-suppression (later in the process). In this 
study, participants viewed fi lms designed to elicit negative emotion (negative) or 
no emotion (neutral) under the following four conditions: watch neutral, watch 
negative, reappraise negative, and suppress negative. Reappraisal, as compared 
with the watch-negative condition, was associated with early medial, dorsolateral, 
and ventrolateral PFC activation, along with decreased activation in amygdala and 
insula. However, suppression was associated with later dorsomedial, dorsolateral, 
and ventrolateral prefrontal responses and increased activation in the amygdala 
and insula. Th ese results are consistent with the temporal dynamics evident in 
Gross’s model (1998b) of emotion regulation strategies, as well as with the general 
conclusion that whereas suppression may reduce the expression of an emotion, it 
does little to diminish the experience. 
 More recently, Kanske and colleagues (2011) examined neural networks impli-
cated in reappraisal versus distraction. Kanske et al. (2011) observed that OFC 
activation was uniquely activated for reappraisal. Conversely, their results dem-
onstrated that distraction (a form of attention deployment) was associated with

activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate and parietal cortex. Both reappraisal and 
distraction resulted in increased activation in medial and dorsolateral prefrontal 
and inferior parietal cortex, as well as in decreased bilateral amygdala activation. 
Functional connectivity analyses, intended to examine regions that signifi cantly 
covaried with the amygdala, demonstrated that the amygdala covaried with diff er-
ent prefrontal regions for reappraisal and distraction, consistent with the distinct 
prefrontal regions observed to be activated during reappraisal versus distraction. 
Of note, participants reported decreased subjective experience of negative emo-
tion using both strategies. 
 Another cognitive strategy that has been examined using neuroimaging research 
is  distancing (Beauregard, Levesque, & Bourgouin, 2001; Kalisch et al., 2005). 
Male participants viewed erotic fi lm clips while either passively viewing or vol-
untarily trying to inhibit sexual arousal. During inhibition of emotional respond-
ing, participants were encouraged to distance themselves from stimuli (i.e., to 
observe the scene in a detached manner). Passive viewing, which was associated 
with increased arousal ratings, resulted in activation in the right amygdala, right 
anterior temporal pole, and hypothalamus. However, attempted inhibition was 
associated with increased activation in right superior frontal gyrus and right ante-
rior cingulate gyrus and was not associated with limbic activation (Beauregard et 
al., 2001). Th ese results suggest that a regulatory circuit including prefrontal cor-
tex and the amygdala are also implicated in emotion regulation associated with 
cognitive distancing. 
 In summary, intentional emotion regulation processes appear to operate by 
way of lateral prefrontal activations. For reappraisal, distraction, and distancing, 
these prefrontal activations have been accompanied by reduced amygdala activity 
and diminished distress responses. Suppression, however, has not been associated 
with reductions in either amygdala activity or distress. 
 Incidental Emotion Regulation and Contextual Modulation 
 Although oft en an intentional process, emotion regulation may also occur in the 
absence of awareness or explicit intent. Such regulation can be thought of as inci-
dental in nature. Given that such eff ects have been observed in the context of 
processes that are eff ortful, but not aimed at regulation, we believe “incidental” 
is a more appropriate term than “automatic” or “implicit.” Naturally, there is the 
question of whether it is appropriate to call something emotion regulation at all if 
it is not intentional, as emotion regulation does not seem to happen by accident. 
 Th ere are several concomitants of emotion regulation, and it is reasonable to 
characterize a process as emotion regulation if it has all but one of these. Successful 
emotion regulation has been associated with changes in self-reported emotional 
experience, reduced physiological responses to threatening stimuli, increased lat-
eral (usually ventrolateral) prefrontal activations, decreased limbic activity, nega-
tive correlations between prefrontal and limbic responses, and the awareness that 
one is trying to regulate one’s emotions.

 Labeling the aff ective component of something emotionally evocative (i.e., 
 aff ect labeling ) may be considered a form of incidental emotion regulation because 
all of the components of emotion regulation appear to be present, except for the 
awareness component. A number of studies have demonstrated the characteristic 
pattern of VLPFC increases, amygdala decreases, and inverse correlation between 
the two when people are shown an emotionally evocative image and asked to 
choose an aff ective word to characterize the picture, compared to when the same 
picture is shown but a nonaff ect task is used (Hariri, Bookheimer, & Mazziotta, 
2000; Lieberman et al., 2005, 2007; Payer, Lieberman, & London, 2011). Other 
studies have demonstrated physiological reductions in skin conductance asso-
ciated with aff ect labeling (Kircanski, Lieberman, & Craske, in press; Tabibnia, 
Lieberman, & Craske, 2008). Finally, a recent dataset observed reliable reduc-
tions in self-reported distress associated with aff ect labeling (Lieberman, Inagaki, 
Tabibnia, & Crockett, 2011). 
 One recent paper (Payer, Baicy, Lieberman, & London, 2012) examined aff ect 
labeling and reappraisal within the same individuals, but on separate testing days. 
Using an anatomical region of interest (ROI) approach, Payer et al. found that the 
amygdala reductions due to aff ect labeling and reappraisal were highly correlated 
with one another (r = .77). Additionally, functional connectivity analyses were 
performed to identify regions that were inversely correlated with amygdala activ-
ity from moment to moment. Th is analysis identifi ed a substantial cluster in right 
VLPFC common to both aff ect labeling and reappraisal. Th ese analyses suggest 
that, within the same individuals, aff ect labeling sets in motion a similar set of 
processes as reappraisal. With aff ect labeling showing so many of the character-
istics of an emotion regulation process, without awareness that labeling produces 
these eff ects (Lieberman et al., 2011), it is best characterized as incidental emotion 
regulation. 
 Other tasks have produced some of the characteristics of emotion regulation 
as well. For example, in a revised version of the emotional Stroop task, partici-
pants were asked to identify an emotional expression on a target emotional face 
(Egner, Etkin, Gale, & Hirsch, 2008; Etkin, Egner, Peraza, Kandel, & Hirsch, 
2006). Th e faces were superimposed with irrelevant information, which was not 
needed to respond correctly and had the potential to be distracting. Th e super-
imposed information was either emotional or nonemotional, and either congru-
ent or incongruent with the target emotional face. For example, a nonemotional 
congruent distracter would be the word “FEMALE” over a female happy face, 
and an emotional incongruent distracter would be the word “HAPPY” over a 
female fear face. Key eff ects were observed during incongruent trials in which 
participants were required to regulate their attention to incongruent distracters 
in order to respond correctly. Th e authors found that regulation of attention to 
emotional (as compared with nonemotional) distracters was related to increased 
rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) activation and corresponding decreases 
in amygdala activity. It is not yet clear whether this constitutes a form of emo-
tion regulation, as there have been no measures of physiological or experiential 
changes. 

110 
foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
 Another set of tasks is more properly characterized as  contextual modulation 
of aff ect . In these studies, the stand-alone emotional signifi cance of a stimulus 
diff ers as a function of the context in which it is found. In these tasks, prefrontal 
mechanisms seem to play a role in understanding the context, which in turn may 
alter limbic responses. For example, one study used surprised facial stimuli that 
were immediately preceded by either a positive or negative sentence that provided 
a context for the face (Kim et al., 2004). As demonstrated in prior work (Kim, 
Somerville, Johnstone, Alexander, & Whalen, 2003), surprised faces are ambigu-
ous in nature and elicit individual diff erences when participants are asked to make 
valence judgments of them. When presented in the context of positive and nega-
tive sentences, Kim and colleagues (2004) observed increased amygdala activa-
tion to surprised faces in the context of negative compared with positive sentences 
and increased rACC activation for the opposite contrast (i.e., surprised faces in 
the context of a positive compared with negative context). 
 Similarly, Hare and colleagues (2005) demonstrated contextual modulation 
of amygdala responsivity to facial expressions in diff ering contexts. Specifi cally, 
an emotional go/no-go paradigm was employed, in which participants were 
told to press a button every time they saw a fearful face. Th e fearful faces were 
interspersed with either neutral or happy faces. Th e authors reported decreased 
amygdala activation to fearful faces in the context of happy faces (compared with 
neutral faces), with a simultaneous increase in VLPFC activation during fearful 
faces in the context of happy faces. Moreover, subsequent research using a simi-
lar emotional go/no-go paradigm demonstrated that a failure of the amygdala to 
habituate to emotional stimuli was associated with weaker functional connectiv-
ity between the amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex (Hare et al., 2008). 
 Th us, there are a variety of ways that aff ect can be altered by other ongoing 
processes that are not deployed for the sake of regulation per se. Some of these are 
clearly a form of emotion regulation, and others currently fall into the category of 
aff ect modulation, but could be considered forms of emotion regulation depend-
ing on the results of future research. 
 CAPACITY VERSUS TENDENCY 
 Social cognitive neuroscience has identifi ed the basic neural networks involved 
in a variety of socioemotional processes, including those reviewed here: the self, 
understanding others, emotion perception, emotional experience, and emotion 
regulation. As these are used increasingly in a translational context to probe 
schizophrenia and other psychopathologies, there is a critical distinction that is 
buried in all of this research. 
 All of the studies that have been conducted thus far have examined the  capacity 
to perform a task and recruit particular neural regions when explicitly instructed 
to perform that task. In daily life, however, there are rarely experimenters induc-
ing us to perform particular tasks, and thus our capacity, say, to engage in emotion 
regulation will only be useful to us to the extent that we have the  tendency  to use

that ability without prompting. More critically to the study of psychopathology, 
defi cits can aff ect capacities, tendencies, or both. Th us, task paradigms that exclu-
sively focus on capacity may be unable to detect key neurocognitive defi cits. 
 To give one example, consider empathy. In a recent study, Rameson, Morelli, 
and Lieberman (2012) presented individuals who were high or low in self-reported 
trait empathy with pictures of people in empathy-inducing situations (e.g., some-
one fi nding out they have cancer). In one condition, the capacity to enter an 
empathic state was tested by explicitly instructing participants to try to empa-
thize with the targets as much as possible. Here, self-reported levels of empathic 
experience were the same for high- and low-trait empathy individuals. Similarly, 
there were no diff erences in neural activity—both groups showed robust activity 
in medial frontal regions associated with empathic processing. 
 In the second condition, no empathy instruction was given. Instead, participants 
were given a distraction task in which they had to memorize an 8-digit number 
while viewing the pictures. Because empathy was not explicitly induced in this 
condition, diff erential evidence of empathic processing would indicate diff erential 
tendencies to be empathic. In this condition, signifi cant diff erences in experience 
and neural activity were observed between high- and low-trait empathy partici-
pants. Despite the distracting task and the lack of empathy instructions, high-trait 
empathy individuals produced just as much medial frontal activity as when they 
were instructed to empathize, but low-trait empathy individuals showed a dra-
matic drop-off  in response. 
 Th us, these data suggest that high-trait empathy has more to do with everyday 
tendencies than does the capacity to be empathic. More generally, these data sug-
gest that if paradigms include only the instructed condition, without another con-
dition in which the participants have more freedom to respond in natural ways, 
important sources of variance are likely to be lost. Moreover, neuroimaging pro-
cedures that could be used to test whether an intervention has produced results 
might overlook successes if neurocognitive tendencies are not measured along 
with neurocognitive capacities. 
 CONCLUSION 
 Th is focused review has highlighted the distinctiveness of social and emotional 
information processing and demonstrated that a social cognitive neuroscience 
approach lends itself well to the study of key aspects of social cognition evidently 
disrupted in clinical populations. In particular, mapping of neural systems sub-
serving complex social psychological phenomena, such as self-relevant and other-
oriented information processing, emotion perception, and emotion regulation, 
reveals neural targets for investigation in schizophrenia. From basic brain map-
ping, the manner of inquiry in the fi eld has begun to move forward, toward elu-
cidating more precisely the nature of social cognition. Th is includes, for example, 
the diff erentiation between intentional and incidental processing and the tendency 
versus capacity to engage in such processes. Importantly, these more advanced

foundat ions of human so cial co gnition
lines of research allow for more accurate interpretations to be made when neural 
diff erences are seen in clinical populations. Although the fi eld of neuroscience is 
clearly in nascent stage relative to other more established fi elds of psychology, our 
understanding of the social brain is rapidly advancing with this methodology. Th e 
continuous emergence of studies pushing the boundaries of which research ques-
tions we may ask with this approach ensures that our knowledge of basic science, 
as well as of psychopathology, will continue to advance and be further refi ned in 
years to come.

 HISTORICAL CONTEXT 
 Th e social sciences have focused on every aspect of human behavior that deal 
particularly with conspecifi cs, encompassing fi elds ranging from psychology to 
anthropology and economics. Our knowledge has evolved with time, but has 
taken a particular leap forward in the past several decades with the advent of 
modern cognitive neuroscience tools, most notably neuroimaging, thus giving 
rise to the fi eld of social cognitive neuroscience. Most of the questions historically 
in the realm of philosophy or, more recently, psychology, are now being addressed 
by social cognitive neuroscience: How do we process memories of people? How 
do we recognize faces and their expressions? How do we make economic and 
political choices? And, more broadly, which of these social abilities are dispro-
portionate or even unique to humans as compared to other animals, which are 
domain-specifi c and rely on specialized neural circuitry, which develop at what 
points in time, and, most pertinent to this volume, which are dysfunctional in 
mental illnesses such as schizophrenia? 
 PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACHES 
 Philosophy of mind is the historical approach to understanding how we guide our 
interactions with other people and how we think about what is going on in their 
minds. Tracing its roots back to 400–500  bc, two distinct schools of philosophi-
cal thought co-existed until the 19th century, diff ering mainly in their view of 
the mind–body problem. Whereas dualists such as Plato believed the mind to be 
distinct from the body, with some variations, monists such as Parmenides took 
a position based on the unity of Nature. Th ese initial ontological views, in turn,

infl uenced how people thought about the relationship between the study of the 
mind and the study of the rest of nature: From one view, psychology should have 
a proprietary vocabulary and approach since its subject matter is distinct from all 
others; from another view, the study of the mind needed eventually to be commen-
surate with, or even reduced to, the study of the biological, chemical, and physical 
components of which it was made. Ideas such as Piaget’s constructivist theory 
(Piaget, 1953), on the one hand, or the conditioned refl exes that Pavlov (1927) 
studied and that formed the basis of behaviorism ( Pavlov, 1927 ), on the other, 
emerged as pioneering attempts in scientifi c psychology. Th e late 19th and early 
20th centuries saw the development of behaviorism, psychoanalysis, and gestalt 
theory, with ideas set by B.F. Skinner (who assumed that modifying patterns of 
behavior was the only way to treat psychological disorders), Freud (who relied on 
introspection to explain them), and von Ehrenfels (who argued that the brain is 
a holistic entity, which perceives a more complex image of its surroundings than 
expected by just adding together all the components of its input). Several of these 
were in clear opposition: Contra behaviorism, constructivism took into account 
the mind’s ability to fi lter the input from the outside world at the level of percep-
tion, and constructivists shaped the idea that internal states, feelings, and beliefs 
can and do infl uence the way we perceive the world. For instance, Piaget’s genetic 
epistemology, which posits that knowledge is a biological function resulting from 
the actions of an individual ( Piaget, 1953 ), largely fails to take into account indi-
vidual fi lters and processing mechanisms for otherwise identical external input, 
thus failing to explain how we can infer new concepts based on rules and experi-
ence, but that are novel to the brain that produces them. 
 A more systematic and comprehensive study of the social aspect of human 
behavior was initiated with the so-called cognitive revolution, which argued 
against behaviorism in particular and was based on the idea that the brain func-
tions and can be understood in many respects like computers, transforming 
inputs to outputs through rules (programs) whose elucidation was the task of the 
sciences of the mind ( Chomsky, 1964 ). First articulated as a critique to Skinner’s 
behaviorist theory, this view eventually led the way for combining evolutionary 
theory with psychology and was followed by the development of evolutionary 
psychology ( Cosmides & Tooby, 1997 ). Taking into account innate informa-
tion processing systems, along with the reverse-engineering of the psychological 
mechanisms that they ultimately underlie, has allowed psychologists to ask not 
only how a particular cognitive ability may be hard-wired in the brain, but also 
why and how it evolved to be so. Th is, in turn, holds out the promise for truly 
naturalizing psychology, linking the mind to the brain through a specifi cation of 
how adaptive behavior and cognition evolved. 
 Within this framework, social psychology has focused on studying the infl u-
ence of other people on our thoughts, beliefs, and behavior. As an example, aft er 
observing that children exposed to adult aggressive behavior are more likely to act 
aggressively ( Bandura, Ross & Ross, 1961 ) in his famous “Bobo doll” experiments, 
Bandura proposed a social learning theory, which evolved into a framework for 
explaining the role of cognitive processes in determining human motivation and 

122 
foundations of human social cognition
action ( Ozer & Bandura, 1990 ). Combining social and cognitive approaches in 
psychology has resulted in a fi eld that takes into account the processing of any 
information, external or internal, leading to the perception, thinking about, and 
acting toward, other people: in short, social cognition. Such social information 
processing can relate to the way we perceive another person and to the implicit 
biases we have of other people, as well as to how these are modulated by context 
and individual diff erences. 
 In social psychology, the term “person perception” refers to the diff erent mental 
processes that we use to form impressions of other people. Th is includes not just a 
description of the cues and sensory processing on the basis of which we form these 
impressions, but also the varied inferences, biases, and stereotypes that come into 
play. Th e sense of being able to enter other minds and learn what they have to off er 
(attunement) is a ubiquitously strong and subjective conviction ( Morsella, Gray et 
al., 2009 ). Perceiving someone else might give us insuffi  cient information to get a 
deep evaluation of their character but enough information to form an expectation 
of such character based on previous experiences we might have had with people 
we would assign to the same category—the basis of biases and stereotypes. For 
instance, we might automatically assume that a painter must be eccentric, simply 
because we know a couple of painters, who are both rather eccentric. When mak-
ing such an assumption, we are biased by our previous experience, an implicit 
attribution that is not necessarily true ( Greenwald & Banaji, 1995 ) but which our 
past experience renders as highly probable. Finally, the way we infer other people’s 
state of mind must take into account the context in which we fi nd the relevant 
information. Th e notion that our perception depends on the context in which 
the information is presented was studied by the constructive perception theorists. 
For instance, if asked to look for a particular feature in a photograph, participants 
exhibit longer reaction times to fi nd the target in a jumbled real-world scene than 
in the same, but unmodifi ed, scene ( Biederman, 1972 ). Th is introduced the idea 
that cognitive use of sensory information was necessary to construct a completed 
perception; in other words, that a previous notion of what a particular stimulus 
should look like has an infl uence on the perception of that stimulus. Th at is why, 
in a relatively dark room, even when there is not enough light to activate the cones 
(the color receptors on the retina) but only the rods (used for night vision, but 
incapable of carrying information about color), bananas will nonetheless seem 
yellow and cherries red ( Palmer, Simone et al., 1988 ). 
 In terms of this general processing picture, the challenge for understanding 
mental illness is to specify the level of processing at which dysfunction may occur. 
Th e best approach here is to combine all possible sources of data: Psychological 
and neurobiological data should be exploited broadly, as all can give clues to the 
level of the defi cit. Is there an abnormal input signal already at the level of the 
retina or early visual regions of the brain? Is there an abnormal inference based 
on a normal perceptual signal? Are there abnormal links to memory, abnormal 
control of interfering processes, or abnormal connection to decision-making and 
behavioral output? Of course, answers to these questions may never be clear-cut 
because the defi cit may occur at many levels, but phrasing the questions in this

way permits specifi c hypotheses to be tested at the process level and specifi c neu-
ral structures to be investigated.  
 NEUROSCIENCE APPROACHES 
 Current cognitive neuroscience tools are extremely varied in their ease of appli-
cation to humans, their resolution in space and time, their cost, and the kind 
of conclusions they permit. At one extreme are lesion studies (see below for a 
classic example), which allow stronger causal inferences than do studies using 
electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
(notably, one can say that damage to a specifi c structure caused the defi cit, and 
that, therefore, this structure is normally necessary for that function; one cannot 
conclude, however, that the lesioned structure normally causes the function or 
behavior under investigation, a conclusion that requires a sort of complement 
to lesions, such as focal electrical stimulation). Historically, lesion studies have, 
without question, provided the greatest insights, ranging from Broca’s patient 
Tan to Phineas Gage to modern cases such as patients H. M. and S. M. Each of 
these provided key insights into language, decision-making, declarative memory, 
and facial emotion recognition, respectively; each has been followed-up in much 
greater detail today using fMRI and other methods. What is the current state of 
the art? Th is is a hard question to answer in humans, although one should prob-
ably say that it is a combination of several methods, such as fMRI in conjunction 
with EEG or magnetoencephalography (MEG), permitting precise correlational 
mapping of structure–function relationships with the best spatial and temporal 
resolution possible: Where and when is a specifi c process implemented in the 
brain. Nonetheless, none of these methods permits strong causal inferences, and 
all lack resolution at anything close to the level of single neurons or even assem-
blies of neurons. However, in animals (currently primarily transgenic rodents, but 
to some extent also monkeys using viral vectors), the state of the art is undoubt-
edly optogenetics, a technique that permits precise manipulation of genetically 
identifi ed populations of neurons with millisecond precision. Th e answer to our 
original question is therefore likely to be that lesion studies, EEG, fMRI, and other 
approaches in humans should all be carried out, and they need to be combined 
with optogenetic studies in animal models. Only through a combination of these 
varied approaches will we really be able to dissect the neural circuitry of social 
cognition, in both health and disease. 
 Th e classic case study of how the lesion method helped to elucidate an aspect 
of social cognition is that of Phineas Gage, a railroad worker, whose case was 
documented in detail from reports at the time (see MacMillan [2000] for a good 
account of this case and the complexities involved) (Figure 5.1). In September 
1848, in Vermont, an explosion drove a metal rod completely through Gage’s 
head, destroying his left  frontal lobe. Aft er this accident, his social behavior was 
radically altered, so that, from a man known as reliable and well mannered, he 
became one unable to carry out any task beyond the point of planning it and

tation of lesions from patients with bifrontal tumor resections who all share a behavioral 
profi le similar to that reported for Gage. In general, their lesions are more restricted 
than Gage’s, but, in all cases, they include ventral and medial regions of the prefrontal 
cortex. Damage to these regions leads to a constellation of impaired emotional response, 
lack of remorse, poor planning for the future, and impulsive behavior, dubbed “acquired 
sociopathy.” (From Bechara, Tranel, & Damasio, 2002. Th e somatic marker hypothesis 
and decision-making. F. Boller & J. Grafman (Eds.),  Handbook of neuropsychology: 
Frontal lobes (Vol. 7, 2nd ed., pp. 117–143). Amsterdam: Elsevier.) 
seemed to have diffi  culties especially in regard to emotional and social func-
tioning ( Damasio, Grabowski et al., 1994 ). More recently, in patients with bilat-
eral ventromedial prefrontal cortex lesions, overlapping in part with the lesion 
that Gage suff ered, severe diffi  culties in real-world behavior, and notably social 
behavior, have been described. Whereas these patients oft en had an entirely 
normal profi le on standard neuropsychological tests of IQ, memory, language, 
and perception, they are invariably impaired in social interaction. Antonio 
Damasio’s “somatic marker hypothesis” was one of the fi rst theories to explain 
www.ebook3000.com

Social Cognitive Neuroscience 
125
the constellation of impairments seen in real life with the fi ndings from the lab: 
It postulated that damage to a specifi c sector of the prefrontal cortex, the ven-
tromedial region, disconnected the otherwise normal perception of the patients 
from their ability to trigger emotional responses that would guide cognition and 
behavior (Damasio, 1994). Th e result of this disconnection was that, when con-
fronted with complex, and perhaps especially social, situations, these patients 
were unable to guide the choices based on how they felt about the contemplated 
outcomes. Th e story of Phineas Gage, no doubt familiar to many readers, is a 
particularly compelling example of how an early (in this case, very early, even 
before the advent of MRI) lesion case eventually culminated in a specifi c theory 
in social neuroscience and spawned a host of other studies (using fMRI and 
other approaches). As with all historical cases, the actual fi ndings have turned 
out to be vastly more complicated, but it nonetheless serves to illustrate a gen-
eral line of approach: fi nd a compelling and clear dissociation following a brain 
lesion, hypothesize the mechanism that explains this, then test the hypothesis 
with more refi ned methods.  
 Another, more recent, example comes from studies of a rare condition 
(Urbach-Wiethe disease) that causes calcifi cation of the amygdala and can lead 
to bilateral amygdala damage, with aff ected people having diffi  culty recognizing 
fear in faces or even experiencing it, and thus being abnormally trustful of oth-
ers ( Adolphs, Tranel et al., 1994 , 1998;  Feinstein, Adolphs, Damasio, & Tranel, 
2011 ) (Figure 5.2). In this example (discussed in more detail below), the initial 
lesion studies were notable for their anatomical specifi city, unlike the case with 
Phineas Gage. Both of these examples highlight brain regions of intense interest 
also to those studying the neural basis of psychiatric disorders: Th e ventrome-
dial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala are known to be connected, are now 
thought of as two components of a network that processes the value of stimuli, 
and have been implicated in psychopathy, depression, anxiety disorders, autism, 
and schizophrenia.

foundations of human social cognition
 Complementing lesion studies with functional imaging in healthy individu-
als has revealed a network of brain areas that participate in social information 
processing. Returning to our initial processing outline, these can be divided into 
regions primarily concerned with social perception, in turn feeding into those con-
cerned with associating those perceptions with other social knowledge, including 
the value of the stimuli and the possible actions toward them, to executing social 
behaviors toward the social stimuli. Th is simple perception-cognition-action 
scheme is, of course, importantly modulated by context and cognitive control, two 
modulating sets of processes in which there are large individual diff erences and 
that likely contribute importantly to psychiatric illness. A brief overview of some 
of the structures that come into play in such a scheme is shown in Figure 5.3.

of images) exhibited abnormal face gaze, making far fewer fi xations to the eyes than 
did controls (left  column of images). Th is was observed across emotions (free viewing, 
emotion judgment, gender discrimination). (C) Magnetic resonance imaging scan of the 
patient’s brain whose lesion was relatively restricted to the entire amygdala, a very rare 
lesion in humans. Th e two round black regions near the top middle of the image are the 
lesioned amygdalae. (D) When the subject was instructed to look at the eyes (“SM eyes,” 
 arrow ) in a whole face, she could do this, resulting in a remarkable recovery in ability to 
recognize the facial expression of fear. Th e fi ndings show that an apparent role for the 
amygdala in processing fearful facial expressions is in fact more abstract and involves the 
detection and attentional direction onto features that are socially informative. (Modifi ed

 SOCIAL COGNITION IN THE DEVELOPING BRAIN 
 One way to understand the mechanisms of social cognition is to study the brains 
of people at the social extremes. Th is includes, on the one hand, autism spec-
trum disorders (ASD), which manifest with diminished social skills, avoidance of 
social contact, and high interest in nonsocial stimuli, and, on the other, Williams 
syndrome (WMS), which translates to overly social behavior (“hypersociability”), 
although it should be noted that this is certainly not merely an increase of normal 
social behaviors. 
 Autism 
 Autism spectrum disorders are neurodevelopmental conditions diagnosed on the 
basis of three major classes of behavioral impairments: social interaction (lack of 
social reciprocity, lack of eye-to-eye gaze, and lack of using multiple nonverbal 
behaviors to regulate social interaction), communication (delay or total lack of 
spoken language, marked impairment to initiate and sustain a conversation, lack 
of spontaneous and varied make-believe play), and restricted interests/repetitive

behaviors (apparently infl exible adherence to specifi c, nonfunctional routines or 
rituals; motor mannerisms; persistent preoccupation with parts of objects). No 
single kind of abnormal behavior seems to be specifi c to autism, but only autism 
appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors 
( Bodfi sh, Symons et al., 2000 ). 
 Childhood ASDs include a wide range of social impairments, with some 
children highly functional and able to live independent lives, albeit with some 
awkward interaction with other people, and some children so severely impaired 
that they could never hope to live without substantial help from their families. 
However, one social skill that seems to be impaired in all of these children is the 
ability to attribute mental states to others ( Leslie & Frith, 1987 ). Th is observation 
led to one of the best known theories of autism; namely, that these people have a 
defi cit in their ability to construct a representation of other minds ( Baron-Cohen, 
Leslie et al., 1985 ;  Frith & Happe, 1994 ). 
 Although the basic mechanisms are still largely unknown, and the exact nature 
of the impairment is not yet understood, the idea that there is a domain-specifi c 
impairment in social cognition in ASD has attracted a lot of attention. Th ere is 
fairly good evidence for both structural and functional abnormalities in struc-
tures thought to be concerned with processing social information, perhaps inves-
tigated most extensively in regard to face processing and structures such as the 
amygdala and temporal cortex (Pelphrey, Adolphs, & Morris, 2004). Th ere is also 
good neuropsychological evidence that this domain of processing seems to be dis-
proportionately impaired in otherwise high-functioning people with autism, and, 
indeed, in their fi rst-degree relatives to some extent (Losh et al., 2009). 
 Although the hypothesis that ASD features disproportionately impaired social 
cognition accounts well for the social defi cits in autism, it fails to explain the 
repetitive behaviors or restricted interests that are part of the phenotype. One 
attempt at linking these two domains of impairment in ASD is Baron-Cohen’s 
“extreme male brain” hypothesis, which is based on the idea that autism features 
an imbalance in systematizing and empathizing, with a decrease in empathizing 
ability and a concomitant increase in systemizing skills ( Baron-Cohen, 2002 ). 
 Another theory, coined “weak central coherence,” attempts to account for the 
nonsocial behaviors of autism by arguing that the information processing style is 
diff erent in people with ASD: Th ey focus intensely on details, at the expense of 
ignoring the context and the “big picture” of the input information ( Happe, 1999 ). 
In typically developing children, a strong central coherence allows them to take 
in information with its context, thus processing the big picture, at the expense of 
memory and detail. Th us, the restricted interests and obsession with detail that is 
seen in ASD seem to fi nd an explanation, but the theory cannot really explain the 
impaired social interaction. 
 Another theory, although not based on a feature of the diagnostic criteria per 
se, is that executive dysfunction underlies many of the impairments in ASD, an 
idea based in part on the parallel between the impairments observed in patients 
with frontal lobe damage and some of the symptoms of autism, such as rigidity 
and perseveration. Indeed, children with autism seem to have planning defi cits;

for instance, when faced with a complex planning task like the Tower of Hanoi 
( Bennetto, Pennington et al., 1996 ;  Ozonoff  & Jensen, 1999 ). Th ey also lack cog-
nitive fl exibility, as evidenced by their inability to switch rules in the Wisconsin 
Card Sorting Task, when the criterion for sorting the cards suddenly changes in 
the game ( Prior & Hoff mann, 1990 ), and they show dysfunctional inhibition of a 
prepotent response, such as not pointing to the desired reward in order to obtain 
it ( Hughes, Russell et al., 1994 ). In this latter study, children with autism were 
presented with two boxes, one empty and the other visibly containing a reward 
(chocolate). In order for them to get the chocolate, they had to point to the empty 
box, but were unable to do so, probably due to an inability to suppress the pre-
potent impulse of pointing to the desired box. Additionally, children with autism 
seem to be impaired in self-monitoring functions, as evidenced by impaired 
motor estimation ( Hermelin & O’Connor, 1975 ), error correction, and avoidance 
( Russell & Jarrold, 1998 ). 
 All in all, each of these hypotheses about the nature of the fundamental cogni-
tive defi cit that underlies autism is still alive and under investigation, although 
some more so than others. It seems unlikely that any of them in isolation will be 
able to account for the full pattern of impairments seen, thus raising important 
questions about the specifi city of both the cognitive impairment and its underly-
ing dysfunctional neural substrate (Happe et al., 2001). 
 Williams Syndrome 
 Entirely genetic in etiology, WMS describes children who appear very interested 
in social interaction, but are severely impaired in several nonsocial domains, 
particularly visuospatial processing. Caused by a hemizygous deletion of almost 
26 genes from the long arm of chromosome 7 that occurs during meiosis 
(del7q11.23), WMS is a rare disorder, aff ecting about 1 in 10,000 children. Th e 
deletion includes the gene for elastin, a protein that contributes to the elasticity 
of blood vessels and connective tissue, which results in the particular appearance 
of aff ected individuals: long philtrum, sunken nasal bridge, and small and widely 
spaced teeth, as well as in some of their frequently associated complications, such 
as high blood pressure, cardiac disease, and hypercalcemia. In contrast to their 
cheerfulness and “cocktail party” personality, children with WMS are develop-
mentally delayed, have mild to moderate mental retardation, and are impaired in 
their spatial skills. Showing an almost opposite social behavioral pattern to chil-
dren with ASD, children with WMS off er a research path toward understanding 
the apparent modularity of social cognition ( Karmiloff -Smith, 1995 ). Similar to 
patients with bilateral amygdala damage, they also seem to judge other people as 
much more approachable than do normally developing controls ( Bellugi, Adolphs 
et al., 1999 ). Furthermore, it seems that their surprisingly good verbal skills are 
driven by a genetically determined hypersociability, complemented by an appar-
ent lack of social fear, as suggested by studies showing that even preverbal infants 
with WMS display an uncharacteristic attraction toward any and all individuals, 

130 
foundations of human social cognition
in contrast to the stranger anxiety that keeps typically developing children cling-
ing to their mothers in the presence of strangers ( Korenberg, Chen et al., 2000 ; 
 Doyle, Bellugi et al., 2004 ). 
 Williams syndrome is associated with a relative increase in amygdala volume 
relative to intracranial volume as compared to age-matched controls ( Capitao, 
Sampaio et al., 2011 ) and a decreased volume of parietal regions involved in spa-
tial cognition (Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2004). Functional imaging studies show 
that normally developing children activate the amygdala when inferring the men-
tal states of people from photographs of their eyes ( Baron-Cohen, Ring et al., 
1999 ), a task that is easily mastered by children with WMS, but diffi  cult or impos-
sible for children with ASD ( Baron-Cohen, Jolliff e et al., 1997 ;  Tager-Flusberg, 
Boshart et al., 1998 ). Regions of the temporal lobe involved in face processing also 
show clear functional abnormalities in both ASD and WMS (Meyer-Lindenberg 
et al., 2005). 
 Comparing disorders at the two extremes of the social spectrum has provided 
insights into the mechanisms and brain structures involved in the processing of 
social information, while at the same time opening up questions about the hetero-
geneity of the social impairments and the need to consider the triad of behavioral 
impairments that defi ne autism as separate entities that may arise dissociably of 
each other (Happe, Ronald, & Plomin, 2006). Given the strictly genetic etiology 
and well-defi ned behavioral characteristics of WMS, in contrast to the continuum 
of impairments that defi ne ASD, it seems reasonable that a varied and heteroge-
neous etiological background (combining identifi ed genetic variants with envi-
ronmental stressors) would have an equally varied and heterogeneous behavioral 
profi le that might produce repetitive behaviors in the presence of normal commu-
nication and social interaction skills, or isolated impairments in social interaction 
in the absence of a communication disorder. Indeed, a twin study on a large popu-
lation suggests that there may be many individuals with isolated impairments in 
one aspect of the triad who show diffi  culties of comparable severity to people with 
autism although they do not meet diagnostic criteria for any recognized disorder 
( Ronald, Happe et al., 2006 ). 
 One intriguing possibility suggested by developmental disorders such as autism 
and WMS is that the origin of an impaired profi le of putatively “cognitive” abilities 
may, in fact, better be thought of as motivational rather than cognitive. In ASD, 
this idea has been discussed for some time (Dawson, Meltzoff , Osterling, Rinaldi, 
& Brown, 1998; Klin, Jones, Schultz, Volkmar, & Cohen, 2002). Th e basic picture 
is that an early failure to fi nd social stimuli rewarding in turn results in reduced 
motivation to attend to social stimuli and to engage in reciprocal social behaviors 
with other people. Th is would then result in an abnormal developmental exposure 
to social stimuli, and hence an abnormal ability for social cognition due to this 
reduced experience. Disentangling such motivational accounts from more purely 
cognitive ones is an important future challenge for neuropsychiatry, and one that 
is now being facilitated by sophisticated models and tools from reward learning 
and neuroeconomics used to investigate the distinction. Th is issue also connects 
back to what we mentioned earlier: Understanding aspects of social dysfunction

will require specifying the stage of information processing that is dysfunctional. 
Detailed dissection of this sort has helped to distinguish some disorders; for 
instance, schizophrenia and autism were found to be distinguishable in aspects of 
social orienting (measured using eye tracking) to complex stimuli, depending on 
whether faces were present in the stimuli (Sasson et al., 2007). 
 BRAIN AREAS INVOLVED IN SOCIAL COGNITION 
 The Social Brain 
 Comparative anatomy shows that primates have larger brains than those of all 
other mammals relative to their body size ( Allman, McLaughlin et al., 1993 ), thus 
raising the question of what evolutionary pressure and adaptations might account 
for this. Possibilities range from general complex problem solving to more 
domain-specifi c abilities such as tool use, language, and social cognition. Th e 
evolution of large brains seems poorly justifi ed by general ecological strategies for 
more complex problem solving, and tool use and language appear too narrowly 
present. Th e theory that emerged in the late 1980s to answer this question was that 
large brains evolved in primates to refl ect the complexity of social interactions 
faced and, in particular, their competitive nature ( Whiten, Byrne et al., 1991 ). Th e 
bigger groups that primates lived in provided protection from predators; through 
more eyes to keep watch and safety in numbers, these large groups provided for 
defense. At the same time, the bigger groups meant that members had to strike 
a balance between their individual needs and the needs of the group, and had to 
develop tools to understand the position, behavior, and intentions of other group 
members in order to successfully negotiate their place within the group. It is this 
need for understanding and navigating complex social relationships that may have 
endowed primates with larger brains, and there is evidence that the size of the 
group correlates with the size of neocortex (more specifi cally, the ratio of neocor-
tex to the rest of the brain) ( Dunbar, 2009 ). It is precisely the capacity to perceive 
dispositions and intentions about others that distinguishes primate behavior from 
that of other mammals ( Brothers, 1989 ). Although nonsocial processing pathways 
can and do make sense of the direction in which another individual is moving, its 
size, or its speed, it is the ability of the brain to perceive socially relevant informa-
tion and use this as the basis for social inferences and cognition that has prompted 
researchers to look for the structures that form the social brain. 
 Th e processes that allow us to infer the dispositions and intentions of others 
are closely related to those with which we think about ourselves and regulate our 
own behavior, and the brain structures involved show considerable overlap as 
well. Social cognition and self-relevant processing have thus been found to share 
considerable processes and structures in common and are frequently investigated 
together. Th ese mechanisms have been proposed to draw on four psychologi-
cal components that may be relatively modular: self-awareness, theory of mind 
(ToM), threat detection, and self-regulation ( Heatherton, 2011 ). 

132 
foundations of human social cognition
 Th e fi rst module, self-awareness, relies on the activity of a network that includes 
the medial prefrontal cortex, as well as the adjacent ventral anterior cingulate cor-
tex ( Harter, Waters et al., 1998 ;  Pfeifer, Lieberman et al., 2007 ). Being able to infer 
another individual’s beliefs and judgments (ToM, the second component) relies 
on nearby but more dorsal regions of the medial prefrontal cortex, together with 
the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), temporal poles, and medial parietal cortex 
( Amodio & Frith, 2006 ;  Gallagher & Frith, 2003 ;  Mitchell, 2006 ;  Saxe, 2006 ). 
For the third module (threat detection), the amygdala seems to play an impor-
tant role ( Tabbert, Stark et al., 2005 ), also evidenced by the diffi  culty of bilateral 
amygdala lesioned patients in discriminating facial expressions of social emotions 
( Adolphs, Baron-Cohen et al., 2002 ). Th ere is ongoing debate about the extent to 
which threat detection may rely on especially fast processing through a subcorti-
cal route to the amygdala (Pessoa & Adolphs, 2010). Several of these components 
likely operate together and are oft en triggered when ongoing routine behavior 
needs to be interrupted. For example, the dorsal region of the anterior cingu-
late cortex (dACC) has been highlighted in detecting potential threat to oneself, 
either through physical or social pain (Shackman et al., 2011): It is activated when 
participants play a video game designed to elicit feelings of social rejection when 
the other game players suddenly stop cooperating with the research participant 
( Eisenberger, Lieberman et al., 2003 ). For the fourth component (self-regulation), 
there is a substantial literature linking this also to sectors of the prefrontal cor-
tex and fractionating it into more cognitive and more emotional aspects; there 
are also insights from lesion studies, as patients with prefrontal cortex lesions are 
oft en impaired in self-monitoring and regulation ( Eslinger & Damasio, 1985 ). 
 Th ere are, of course, many other sets of processes relevant to human social behav-
ior, and many diff erent schemes for attempting to categorize them in some way. 
Th e simplest categorizations typically assume that there are two broad types, oft en 
mapping onto a classical distinction from cognitive psychology: that between con-
trolled and automatic processing (Schneider & Shiff rin, 1977). Th is dichotomous 
scheme has spawned a host of putatively associated attributes: Automatic process-
ing is oft en thought to be also emotional and nonconscious, whereas controlled 
processing is thought to be “cognitive” and accessible to conscious report. More 
closely related to social cognition, a distinction has been made between refl exive 
and refl ective processing, emphasizing that social cognition features both rela-
tively shallow and automatic processing, as well as processing that oft en requires 
some of the metacognitive abilities mentioned above (Lieberman, 2007).  
 The Prefrontal Cortex 
 Th e PFC is a collection of cortical areas in the frontal lobes, anterior to the pre-
motor cortex. It is interconnected to virtually all cortical sensory systems, motor 
systems, and many subcortical structures, which allows PFC to play a major role 
in higher cognitive functions ( Asaad, Rainer et al., 2000 ). Th e PFC is involved 
in short-term storage of information and “executive” control of behavior, such

as attention, task management, planning, and problem solving ( Miller, 1999 ; 
 Smith & Jonides, 1999 ). In general, social and emotional skills are complex, mul-
timodal, and highly associative tasks requiring abstract internal representation. 
PFC neurons refl ect a variety of cognitive attributes that are necessary to code, 
evaluate, process, store, and retrieve social information. But the PFC is only part 
of a broader network of structures that includes structures such as the amygdala, 
the cingulate gyrus, the fusiform gyrus, the insula and other sectors of somatosen-
sory cortex, the superior temporal sulcus, the supramarginal gyrus, and others 
( Adolphs, Baron-Cohen et al., 2002 ;  Adolphs, Tranel et al., 2003 ). 
 Some broad themes have been proposed to organize the way in which the PFC 
contributes to cognition; for instance, more conceptually abstract, symbolic, or 
cognitively mediated aspects of emotion experience appear to depend on more 
anterior sectors of prefrontal cortex, such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex 
( Lane, Reiman et al., 1998 ;  Ochsner & Gross, 2005 ), and, in general, more abstract 
and metacognitive aspects of cognitive control may rely on progressively more 
anterior regions in the frontal lobe (Koechlin, Ody, & Kouneiher, 2003). By con-
trast, there is some evidence that reward-driven control of behavior depends more 
on medial sectors of the prefrontal cortex, whereas the need to change behavior 
in response to changes in reward or experience of punishment may draw on more 
lateral sectors (Kringelbach, 2005). 
 Th e anterior cingulate gyrus plays an important role in cognitive confl ict 
monitoring and anticipation of cognitive confl ict ( Botvinick, Cohen et al., 2004 ; 
 Sohn, Albert et al., 2007 ). Macaque monkeys with bilateral lesions to the anterior 
cingulate cortex (ACC) exhibit defi cits in social behaviors, such as fewer social 
interactions, reduced time near conspecifi cs, and fewer vocalizations ( Hadland, 
Rushworth et al., 2003 ). Indeed, lesion studies in monkeys have argued that it is 
damage to the anterior cingulate gyrus, rather than to other sectors of the pre-
frontal cortex such as the orbitofrontal cortex, that may be most responsible for 
the social defi cits seen in primates following PFC damage (Rudebeck, Buckley, 
Walton, & Rushworth, 2006), and it is still an important issue for further inves-
tigation to determine to what extent this also may explain the impairments seen 
in humans with such lesion, such as the classic case of Phineas Gage discussed 
earlier. 
 Th e ACC, particularly ventral ACC, has been associated with aff ective/emo-
tional processing for some time ( Devinsky, Morrell et al., 1995 ), and it shows dif-
ferential activation for empathy and social intuition ( V ö llm, Taylor et al., 2006 ) 
and cooperation ( Rilling, Gutman et al., 2002 ). Th e ACC has long been known 
to be involved in pain perception (its white matter connections are a target of 
neurosurgery for treating intractable pain). Neurosurgical recordings in humans 
have documented single neurons that respond to pain ( Hutchison, Davis et al., 
1999 ) and motivate behavior more generally ( Vogt, 2005 ). All of these fi ndings 
taken together argue that the involvement of the ACC in emotion processing is 
related to the strong motivation to behave in a certain way and the need to moni-
tor confl ict, both of which may feature more prominently, on average, in social 
behavior than in other aspects of behavior. Although analyses based primarily 

134 
foundations of human social cognition
on human fMRI studies have argued for some time that more ventral sectors of 
the ACC are disproportionately concerned with emotion-related regulation and 
control, and more dorsal sectors with more purely “cognitive” aspects of control, 
this anatomical dichotomy has recently been called into question. Th ere is now 
substantial evidence that both “emotional” and “cognitive” aspects of behavioral 
control are intermingled in the anteromedial cingulate cortex, and it is likely that 
diverse aspects of confl ict monitoring and control draw on a more phylogenetic 
basic set of functions that have to do with the need to control emotional responses 
in a social setting (Shackman et al., 2011).  
 Temporal Lobe 
 One of the most important abilities in social interaction is face perception, which 
is crucial for the recognition of socially relevant information such as identity, 
basic emotions (fear, happiness, etc.), and gaze direction. Although faces are 
visually quite similar in appearance, we extract an impressive wealth of socially 
relevant information from them, information that allows us to recognize threat 
or approval, social status, intent, focus of attention, surprise, fear, or just a wel-
coming smile. Th ere is evidence to suggest that the processing of faces and their 
meaning draws very substantially on both cortical and subcortical structures in 
the temporal lobe. Most famously, there has been a long-standing argument that 
face processing is, to a large extent, domain-specifi c, relying on innate, specialized 
processes that primates have evolved in order to permit rapid social cognition 
based on seeing conspecifi cs. Th e original studies found that faces, more so than 
other visual stimuli, preferentially activated sectors of the ventral temporal cor-
tex, a region that was subsequently dubbed the “fusiform face area” ( Kanwisher, 
McDermott et al., 1997 ; McCarthy, Puce, Gore, & Allison, 1997). Furthermore, 
regions in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) are activated when participants 
view movement of the eyes or mouth ( Puce, Allison et al., 1998 ), leading to a view 
according to which dynamic aspects of faces (emotional expression, eye gaze, bio-
logical motion) rely disproportionately on STS and STG, whereas static aspects of 
faces (their individuation into identity) rely on ventral temporal cortex (Haxby, 
Hoff man, & Gobbini, 2000). Such a distinction between processing identity and 
emotion information from faces was already proposed in earlier psychological 
models (Bruce & Young, 1986). 
 Th e domain-specifi city of face processing is not without debate. Two key argu-
ments revolve around the question of whether face-specifi c processing is anatom-
ically specifi c or depends on more distributed regions: Initial studies found that a 
spatially quite distributed set of cortical regions carried information about faces, 
not just the fusiform face area (Haxby et al., 2001), but recent studies still argue 
that the fusiform face area plays a disproportionately important role in disam-
biguating faces from other classes of objects (Reddy & Kanwisher, 2007). A sec-
ond argument has focused on the question of whether domain specifi city arises 
from innate mechanisms for processing faces or is derivative of a more abstract

computational function of expertise-based subordinate-level categorization: Are 
we born with a module for face processing, or is the fusiform face area trained 
up to process faces because they happen to be the most frequent objects we need 
to identify? Some studies have linked the expertise we have at recognizing novel 
objects to the activity measured in the fusiform face area of the brain ( Gauthier, 
Tarr et al., 1999 ), and thus these studies suggest that, in order for humans to dis-
tinguish socially relevant features in a face, they need to develop the expertise of 
discriminating between visually highly similar inputs that yet convey very distinct 
social information ( Tarr & Gauthier, 2000 ). Such very specialized demands might 
give rise to apparent domain-specifi c modules for social processing ( Grusec & 
Davidov, 2010 ), like a module for anticipating the behavior of others in a recipro-
cal and competitive setting, or a module for generating regulating behaviors (such 
as punishment for noncooperative members of the group). 
 Th e responses of single neurons in the ventral temporal cortex to faces (recorded 
with electrodes in the brains of macaque monkeys) provide further support for 
the modularity of face processing ( Tsao, Freiwald et al., 2006 ) and have begun to 
sketch out an entire network of interconnected “patches” of regions in the tempo-
ral and frontal cortex that process the various aspects of faces (Moeller, Freiwald, 
& Tsao, 2008). Although we do not yet have equivalent detailed data from humans, 
there are some data now from intracranial recordings in epilepsy patients that also 
argue for a distributed set of cortical regions in the temporal lobe that carry infor-
mation about many diff erent aspects of faces (Tsuchiya, Kawasaki, Oya, Howard, 
& Adolphs, 2008), both dynamic and static, thus arguing against the strong ear-
lier dichotomy (Haxby et al., 2000), or at least suggesting substantial cross-talk 
between functional processing streams. Th e debate about the domain specifi city 
of face processing can be seen as an instance of a broader issue concerning a trade-
off  between two dimensions of stimulus information and functional specializa-
tion ( Atkinson & Adolphs, 2011 ) (see Figure 5.4). One mechanism might apply 
to a restricted set of stimuli or to a large domain of diff erent ones. Alternatively, 
one mechanism could contribute to several diff erent processes, within either one 
restricted stimulus class or over many such classes. 
 Although dependent on similar visual input, face identifi cation and recog-
nition of the emotions expressed by faces are in many respects quite diff erent 
processes. Th e hypothesis that face identifi cation and facial expression process-
ing are also based on distinct pathways is supported by two lines of evidence: 
(1) Neuropsychological studies of brain lesioned patients with impaired face per-
ception and (2) lesion studies in monkeys. Some patients with face agnosia fol-
lowing temporal cortex lesions, as well as monkeys with STS banks ablation, are 
impaired in recognizing frontal eye gaze from visually presented faces ( Campbell, 
Heywood et al., 1990 ). Functional imaging studies support the notion that the 
STS is involved in representing facial expressions and mouth and eye movements 
( Haxby, Hoff man et al., 2000 ) and also in reorienting the gaze in order to achieve 
joint attention ( Materna, Dicke et al., 2008 ), but is less involved in face identi-
fi cation, as we reviewed earlier. In contrast, single-unit recordings in monkeys 
( Desimone, Albright et al., 1984 ;  Tsao, Freiwald et al., 2003 ), and electrophysiology 

136 
foundations of human social cognition
( Bentin, Allison et al., 1996 ) and functional imaging ( Kanwisher & Yovel, 2006 ) 
in humans, support the role of the fusiform gyrus in coding those static proper-
ties of faces needed for face identifi cation. Remarkably, brain-damaged patients 
impaired in face identifi cation are oft en still able to recognize facial expressions 
( Tranel & Damasio, 1988 ), whereas patients with impaired abilities to recognize 
emotions in faces are perfectly able to identify the individuals whose faces they are 
shown ( Adolphs, Tranel et al., 1994 ). Th e former impairment, prosopagnosia, and 
the latter, specifi c emotion recognition impairments (to date best documented 
for the amygdala in the case of fear [Adolphs, Tranel et al., 1994] and the insula, 
together with parts of the basal ganglia in the case of disgust [Calder, Keane, 
Manes, Antoun, & Young, 2000; Calder, Lawrence, & Young, 2001]), constitute 
a classic double-dissociation. Such a double dissociation suggests two function-
ally distinct pathways for the visual analysis of faces, one that involves the basic 
identifi cation of the facial features that defi ne a particular individual, the other 
a dedicated functional mechanism for the extraction of emotional information 
from the face, independent of whom that face belongs to. Th is scheme harks back 
to earlier proposals for a segregation between face identifi cation and emotion 
processing (Bruce & Young, 1986), whose details are now clearly more complex 
and less dichotomous than originally thought, as we discussed above.

 Figure 5.4     Is social cognition special? Debates about the modularity of social informa-
tion processing oft en revolve around the two dimensions shown in this schematic: Is 
the specialization at the level of processing algorithms (functional specialization), or 
at the level of the type of information being processed (stimulus selectivity)? A mecha-
nism might be functionally monolithic and apply to a restricted set of stimuli (region 1) 
or applicable to a large domain of diff erent kinds of stimuli (region 2). Alternatively, a 
mechanism might contribute to several distinct processes, but, in the service of process-
ing, be either a restricted stimulus class (region 3) or many (region 4). (Modifi ed from

 Amygdala 
 Th e amygdala is a key structure in the medial temporal lobe that has received con-
siderable attention in regard to facial emotion processing and has been implicated 
in a large range of psychiatric disorders. Th e amygdala is known to be involved 
in a variety of processing related to fear, such as pavlovian fear conditioning; 
recognizing fear from faces—as well as perhaps from other cues, such as body 
postures and tone of voice (although the evidence is most clear for faces); and 
even the conscious experience of fear (Feinstein et al., 2011). Behavioral stud-
ies on patients with amygdala lesions, as well as functional imaging studies in 
neurologically healthy participants, have provided evidence that the amygdala 
plays a critical role in emotion recognition from faces, and particularly negative 
emotions, such as anger or fear ( Adolphs, Tranel et al., 1994 , 1999;  Breiter, Etcoff  
et al., 1996 ;  Morris, Frith et al., 1996 ;  Young, Bohenek et al. 1995 ). In general, the 
impairments are disproportionate for those emotions closest to fear, although, in 
other patients with bilateral amygdala lesions, the defi cit is certainly not restricted 
to fear (Adolphs, Tranel et al., 1999), thus highlighting an important point: Even 
following complete damage to a key brain structure, the resulting dysfunction 
shows individual diff erences that will require a broader network account of 
compensatory function. A recent study investigated the conscious experience of 
fear: Th e authors brought a patient with bilateral amygdala damage to a haunted 
house, a pet store, and the lab and exposed her to various fear-eliciting stimuli, 
like snakes, spiders, and unexpected threatening sounds, all of which failed to 
elicit a fear experience (Feinstein et al., 2011). Th e amygdala has also been linked 
to the regulation of social judgments and social behaviors, in particular those 
having to do with approach and trust behaviors (see Adolphs [2010] for a review). 
Although we rarely are aware of it, we normally keep a relatively constant social 
distance to other people when we interact with them, a distance that depends on 
cultural upbringing, the relationship to the person we interact with, and also the 
nature of the conversation we’re having with them. However, a patient with bilat-
eral amygdala lesions shows a profound lack of such social distancing and seems 
to have no sense of personal space ( Kennedy & Adolphs, 2010 ), suggesting that 
the social discomfort we normally experience when someone approaches us too 
closely largely depends on social processes in the amygdala. 
 Amygdala responses to emotional faces are modulated by the context in which 
the face occurs (Kim et al., 2004) and by the direction of eye gaze in the face 
( Adams, Gordon et al., 2003 ). By comparing the blood oxygen level-dependent 
(BOLD) signal in the amygdala of healthy volunteers when they viewed fearful 
and angry faces with direct and averted gaze in the scanner, the authors found 
evidence that an ambiguous threat (such as an angry face looking away or a fearful 
face looking directly at the participant) elicits a more vigorous activation of the 
amygdala than do clear threat situations (angry face with direct gaze and fearful 
face with averted gaze). Th is interaction between the gaze direction and the facial 
expression suggests that the amygdala is also specifi cally involved in detecting 
threat-related ambiguity.

foundations of human social cognition
 Taken together, all the varied impairments following amygdala lesions 
(cf. Table 5.1 for a summary from the famous patient S. M.) point to an impor-
tant role for the amygdala in social behavior, and in particular in behaviors and 
judgments related to potential threat. However, recent studies indicate that the 
amygdala may not serve any kind of a domain-specifi c role for fear, or even for 
emotion. For one thing, neurons in the amygdala respond to a broad variety of 
stimuli, both aversive and appetitive (Paton, Belova, Morrison, & Salzman, 2006). 
For another, some BOLD-fMRI activation of the amygdala and some modula-
tions of neuronal responses in animals seem to have nothing to do with the social 
or emotional nature of the stimuli but instead serve a broader role in processing 
any stimuli that are unpredictable (Herry et al., 2007) or ambiguous in some way 
(Whalen, 2007). Studies of patient S. M., who has bilateral amygdala lesions, have 
argued that the apparently domain-specifi c impairments in fear recognition from

faces arise from a more abstract inability to fi xate onto and process information 
from a particularly salient region of the face—the eyes (Adolphs et al., 2005; cf. 
Figure 5.2). Th ese fi ndings from the amygdala revisit our earlier discussion of the 
domain-specifi city of social cognition: On the one hand, there is clear evidence 
for impairments that are disproportionate in the social domain and for structures 
that contribute more importantly to social aspects of cognition and behavior; on 
the other hand, in all of these cases, there is further evidence suggesting a more 
general and abstract information processing function, one that may underlie and 
explain apparently domain-specifi c social cognition. 
 Connectivity 
 As briefl y reviewed in the previous section, many brain areas are involved in 
social cognitive processes, and some questions that received more attention 
recently focus on the mechanisms that allow them to work together and facilitate 
information fl ow between them. Surely, having a collection of clusters of neurons 
that become active while we assess, evaluate, and act upon social stimuli is just 
one piece of the puzzle. Viewed as a distributed system for social cognition, these 
areas reveal an intricate morphology and complex interconnectivity between the 
apparently distinct clusters of neurons. Understanding the processing of social 
information in the brain must be contingent on understanding the connectivity 
between—as well as the function of—each of its components, from the level of the 
synapse to the level of fi ber pathways. 
 Th e interest in connectivity is, of course, not new, and scientists have been 
aware of its importance since the neuron doctrine described by Santiago Ramon 
y Cajal and the functional hypotheses of thinkers like Donald Hebb: Single neu-
rons in isolation do nothing; everything comes about through their vast pattern of 
connectivity. But, although studying the anatomy and physiology of neurons was 
still possible aft er dissection of brain tissues, preserving and studying connectiv-
ity patterns proved a much more demanding task. With an average of about 7,000 
synapses per neuron in the human brain, determining information fl ow between 
neurons, between neuronal populations, and between brain areas depends on 
understanding both structural and functional aspects of connectivity. Th ere is a 
sense of profound progress now in some animal preparations, in particular with the 
advent of large-scale electron microscopic atlases, the detailed characterization of 
cell types and their expression patterns, and the ability to manipulate and control 
neuronal network activity using optogenetic techniques. Large-scale enterprises, 
such as the Allen Brain Atlas, are leading the way in such endeavors. Nonetheless, 
our ability to obtain detailed descriptions of connectivity in the human brain, let 
alone to manipulate it with any precision, are still a long way off . 
 Connectivity between brain regions has long been also a leading ingredient in 
neuropsychiatric models, including models of information processing in schizo-
phrenia ( Friston & Frith, 1995 ). For instance, Mayberg’s classic model of depres-
sion (Mayberg et al., 1999), as well as more recent models of mood disorders 

140 
foundations of human social cognition
(Pezawas et al., 2005), has focused on the connectivity between prefrontal cortex 
and amygdala, in particular the idea that sectors of prefrontal cortex may pro-
vide regulatory and control components to the emotional responses implemented 
by the amygdala ( Anand, Li et al., 2005 ). Focal lesion studies have also empha-
sized the issue: Impairments in recognizing facial emotion can arise not just from 
amygdala damage, but also from damage to right hemisphere white matter that 
may disconnect somatosensory-related cortices with structures like the amygdala 
and occipital regions (Adolphs, Damasio, Tranel, Cooper, & Damasio, 2000; 
Philippi, Mehta, Grabowski, Adolphs, & Rudrauf, 2009). 
 Th e importance of white matter integrity in cognition has been perhaps most 
specifi cally and famously studied in patients who underwent resection of the 
corpus callosum as a treatment for epilepsy. Such “split-brain” patients showed a 
pattern of impairments that off ered insight into hemispheric specialization. For 
these patients, images shown in the left  visual fi eld have meaning, but they are 
not able to name them because the right hemisphere specializes in spatial and 
nonverbal tasks, whereas the left  hemisphere dominates verbal tasks ( Gazzaniga, 
2005 ). Interestingly, in patients with developmental agenesis of the corpus cal-
losum (AgCC), these marked split-brain symptoms are not present ( Sauerwein 
& Lassonde, 1994 ), and the patients instead show a much more subtle constella-
tion of impairments, particularly in the social domain (Paul et al., 2007). It is also 
striking that patients with agenesis of the corpus callosum, despite lacking the 
largest white matter tract in the brain, show remarkably normal functional con-
nectivity between the hemispheres and seem to have a largely normal complement 
of functional networks, as revealed through an analysis of resting-state BOLD 
data (Tyszka et al., 2011). Th is latter fi nding may be important for understanding 
plasticity, reorganization, and functional compensation as well. How such nor-
mal functional networks can form without a normal structural connectivity base 
remains an important issue for future work. 
 Abnormal connectivity has been highlighted also in ASDs. In autism, high 
local connectivity may develop in tandem with long-range underconnectivity 
( Just, Cherkassky et al., 2004 ). Th is hypothesis is compatible with the weak central 
coherence theory and might be explained by widespread alterations in elimina-
tion and/or formation of synapses ( Sporns, Tononi et al., 2000 ). One plausible 
information processing mechanism may be that the high local physical connec-
tivity and low computational connectivity would fail to diff erentiate signal from 
noise ( Rubenstein & Merzenich, 2003 ). Reduced connectivity between the hemi-
spheres, consistent in particular with reduced communication through the corpus 
callosum, has recently been found in autism (Anderson et al., 2010). 
 CONCLUSION 
 Although studying the connections within the social cognitive neural system has 
improved our general understanding of the roles played by each region in pro-
cessing social stimuli, the picture can only be complete when we understand the

dynamics of the system, the precise timing at which each function comes into 
play, and the causality of each step within the network. Th is will require continued 
integration among a broad set of approaches in humans, including patient studies, 
as well as studies in healthy individuals, using fMRI, EEG, transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (TMS), and other methods, and it will continue to depend on animal 
models in which the questions can be addressed and causal models can be tested 
using methods impossible to apply in humans.

 Social Cognition and Functional 
Outcome in Schizophrenia

 If I see someone talking in a friendly way and smiling, but they have their 
arms crossed in front of them, that confuses me. It throws me off —like a 
mixed message. I’m stuck, and I don’t know how that person feels—how 
do you break that down? 
 -year-old man with schizophrenia  
 Among the diverse signs and symptoms that comprise the American Psychiatric 
Association’s  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) cri-
teria for schizophrenia, functional impairment is the only characteristic shared 
by every person who is diagnosed with this disorder. Most patients experience 
marked impairment across multiple aspects of daily life functioning, including 
social relations, vocational pursuits, and independent living (Marder & Fenton, 
2004; Murray & Lopez, 1996). As is evident in the quote above,  dysfunction in 
the social domain can have far-reaching consequences across many aspects of 
functioning, contributing to fractured family relationships, confl ict with peers 
and coworkers, and social isolation. In addition to their associated emotional 
and fi nancial burdens for aff ected individuals and those who care for them, func-
tional impairments are a major public health  concern—schizophrenia ranks as 
the sixth leading cause of disability in men and the fi ft h leading cause of disabil-
ity in women worldwide (WHO, 2004), and the costs to society are enormous 
(Murray & Lopez, 1997; Nicholl, Akhras, Diels, & Schadrack, 2010). 

152 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
 Unfortunately, functional impairments are refractory to current pharmacologi-
cal interventions (Harvey, 2009) and only partially responsive to rehabilitation 
(Cook et al., 2005; Kurtz & Mueser, 2008). Despite major advances in treating 
the acute psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, most patients continue to func-
tion poorly between episodes, and the long-term outcome of schizophrenia has 
changed little over the past 100 years (Hegarty, Baldessarini, Tohen, Waternaux, 
& Oepen, 1994). It has become clear that residual clinical symptoms are rather 
weak predictors of functional outcome, indicating that further improvements are 
unlikely to come about through better symptom management alone. Instead, new 
treatments are needed that address the key determinants of poor functional out-
come. Th is recognition is central to prevailing recovery-oriented approaches to 
treatment (Kern, Glynn, Horan, & Marder, 2009), which refl ect a fundamental 
shift  from a focus on symptom reduction to a focus on functional recovery and 
pursuit of personally meaningful goals and aspirations. 
 In the context of recovery-oriented treatment development, there has been a 
great deal of interest in identifying key determinants of poor outcome that can 
be targeted through novel intervention approaches. Over the past three decades, 
considerable evidence has shown that impairments in neurocognition, including 
attention/vigilance, speed of processing, working memory, verbal learning, visual 
learning, reasoning, and problem-solving, are among the most important determi-
nants of how well people with schizophrenia function in the community (Green, 
1996; Green, Kern, Braff , & Mintz, 2000; Green, Kern, & Heaton, 2004). Th is has 
led to major initiatives by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH; e.g., 
Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia 
[MATRICS], Treatment Units for Research on Neurocognition in Schizophrenia 
[TURNS]) to stimulate and guide the development of new pharmacological treat-
ments for cognitive defi cits that impact outcome. 
 Despite these important developments, it is unlikely that interventions target-
ing only neurocognition will be suffi  cient as the amount of variance in outcome 
that is accounted for by neurocognition is typically in the range of 20% to 40%. 
Furthermore, there has until recently been a substantial gap in our understand-
ing of the mechanisms through which neurocognitive defi cits measured in the 
laboratory ultimately give rise to the functional defi cits experienced by patients in 
their daily lives in the community. Th us, there is a critical need to identify other 
factors that contribute to functional disability. 
 Over the past decade, social cognition has emerged as a high-priority research 
topic that holds great promise for helping us understand and treat the causes 
of functional disability. As described elsewhere in this volume, social cogni-
tion refers to the mental operations underlying social interactions, and people 
with schizophrenia show substantial impairments across several social cognitive 
domains, including emotion perception/processing (EP), social perception (SP), 
attributional style (AS), and mentalizing or theory of mind (ToM). Because social 
cognition is so central to understanding and eff ectively interacting with other 
people, problems such as misperceptions and unexpected reactions to and from 
other people would be expected to adversely impact functioning across a variety

of domains. In support of this expectation, growing evidence indicates that social 
cognitive impairments do indeed make important and unique contributions to 
poor functional outcome in schizophrenia. 
 Th is chapter provides an overview of the relationship between social cogni-
tion and functional outcome in schizophrenia. We begin by briefl y reviewing 
how functional outcome is defi ned and assessed. We next review studies that 
examined correlations between diff erent types of social cognition and diff erent 
aspects of functional outcome. We then turn to more recent studies that have used 
sophisticated modeling techniques to examine how social cognition interacts 
with neurocognition to impact functional outcome. We conclude by discussing 
the important implications of these fi ndings for developing new social cognitive 
intervention approaches that facilitate functional recovery. 
 FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 
 Functional outcome is a multifaceted construct that has been defi ned in many dif-
ferent ways. It is assessed in schizophrenia using a variety of methods that focus 
on diff erent domains of life (e.g., social, vocational), diff erent levels of analysis 
(e.g., microscopic instrumental skills to macroscopic assessments of well-being), 
and diff erent sources of information (e.g., laboratory-based measures to collateral 
informants) (Bellack et al., 2007). Each approach to assessing functional outcome 
has diff erent advantages and disadvantages and, as discussed further below, the 
correspondence among these approaches, and their relations to functionally rel-
evant variables (e.g., neurocognition), can vary considerably. Th us, it is important 
to consider how functional outcome is conceptualized and assessed in the context 
of social cognitive studies. 
 Figure 6.1 provides an overview of commonly used functional outcome assess-
ment approaches and illustrative measures. At the broadest level, a distinction can 
be made between competence-based and attainment-based measures. Generally 
speaking, competence or “functional capacity” measures assess what a person 
is capable of doing in a controlled clinical research setting (Harvey, Velligan, & 
Bellack, 2007; Patterson & Mausbach, 2010). Measures of functional capacity are 
performance-based simulations or role-plays of activities required for adaptive 
daily living, such as holding a social conversation, social problem solving, select-
ing grocery items to prepare a meal, and planning a trip using public transporta-
tion. Th is approach has the advantages of providing a direct assessment of ability 
within a specifi c domain, standardization across assessments, and strong psy-
chometric properties, including interrater agreement. Furthermore, functional 
capacity measures show consistently strong relations to neurocognitive function-
ing. However, as discussed further below, good performance on these measures 
indicates only that a person has the ability to perform the assessed skills, not that 
he or she will actually use these abilities in the course of daily life.      
 In contrast to competence-based measures, attainment-based measures focus 
on what one actually experiences and does in the real world. Two subcategories

d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
of attainment-based measures can be distinguished according to whether they 
assess: (a) a person’s subjective satisfaction with or evaluation of his or her level 
of functioning, or (b) more objective information about level and quality of func-
tioning. Subjective measures evaluate perceived quality of life, which refers to a 
person’s sense of general well-being and satisfaction with his or her circumstances 
(Eack & Newhill, 2007; Tolman & Kurtz, 2012). Th ese subjective appraisals are 
typically assessed using self-report measures that inquire about satisfaction in 
particular life domains, such as social, vocational, and residential, or in terms of 
a person’s more general appraisals of overall well-being. Some measures include 
interview-based ratings of personal descriptions of so-called intrapsychic pro-
cesses, such as motivation, interest, and empathy (Heinrichs, Hanlon, & Carpenter, 
1984). Self-reports of satisfaction and well being have the virtue of simplicity and 
relatively low personnel/fi nancial resource burdens, and they incorporate a per-
son’s own perception of how well he or she is functioning. However, a person’s 
ability to accurately report on his or her own behavior can be impacted by a host 
of factors, such as poor insight, psychiatric symptoms, recall defi cits, or mood 
state infl uences. In addition, the relation between these measures and other rele-
vant variables, such as neurocognition and the more objective measures discussed 
just below, can be rather low.

Social Cognition and Functional Outcome in Schizophrenia

 Although measures in the second subcategory of “objective” attainment cover 
the same general domains of life as subjective measures, they can vary consider-
ably in the type of information on which ratings are based (Harvey et al., 2011; 
Leifk er, Patterson, Heaton, & Harvey, 2011). Th is ranges from relatively objective 
indicators (e.g., marital status, residential setting, amount of money earned), to 
self- or informant- (e.g., family member, clinician) reported data (e.g., number 
of friends and frequency of interaction), to behavioral observations of trained 
raters (e.g., ratings of ward behavior by psychiatric nurses). Th e extent to which 
a person benefi ts from enrollment in psychiatric rehabilitation is also sometimes 
considered within this category. Th us, these measures are intended to index rela-
tively objective indices of a person’s level of functional attainment in his or her 
naturalistic environment. However, information provided by diff erent sources 
can vary considerably in terms of both relations to each other and to other rel-
evant variables. For example, self-reports of functional attainment tend to provide 
lower correlations with neurocognitive and functional capacity measures than do 
informant-based assessments. However, proxy reports are oft en very diffi  cult or 
impossible to obtain, and informants may only interact with the patient in nar-
rowly specifi c life contexts. Furthermore, a host of external factors beyond an 
individual’s control can infl uence actual behaviors in the community, such as the 
extent to which treatment or residential and social services are available. 
 In summary, a variety of approaches are used to defi ne and assess functional dis-
ability in schizophrenia. It is clear that individuals with schizophrenia show sub-
stantial impairments on both competence- and achievement-based measures. Th ese 
impairments are evident during the earliest phase of schizophrenia (e.g., Horan, 
Subotnik, Snyder, & Nuechterlein, 2006; Malla & Payne, 2005) and likely precede 
onset. For example, recent studies of prodromal subjects report impairments on 
competence and achievement measures (Addington, Penn, Woods, Addington, 
& Perkins, 2008a; Pinkham, Penn, Perkins, Graham, & Siege, 2007; Shim et al., 
2008). Importantly, the variable correspondence among these diff erent approaches 
also makes it clear that a substantial disjunction oft en exists between what one can 
do and what one actually does in the community. Th is likely refl ects the complex, 
multidetermined nature of functioning, which is impacted by both individual and 
environmental factors. Generally speaking, functional capacity is more highly 
infl uenced by individual factors, such as neurocognitive level, whereas functional 
attainment is more likely to be infl uenced by environmental factors, such as social 
support, employment and housing opportunities, and treatment resources. 
 In light of the complex relations among diff erent aspects of functioning and the 
diversity of available measures, two recent NIMH initiatives have evaluated a range 
of outcome measures to make empirically based recommendations about the best 
available measures, particularly for use in clinical trials. Regarding competence 
measures, the MATRICS-CT project examined several long- and short-form 
measures. Th e University of California at San Diego’s (UCSD) Performance-
based Skills Assessment (UPSA) (Patterson, Goldman, McKibbin, Hughs, & Jeste, 
2001), which measures planning and organization, managing fi nances, commu-
nication, transportation, and household management skills, had the strongest 

156 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
overall properties for long-form measures. Among the short forms, the Test of 
Adaptive Behavior in Schizophrenia (TABS) (Velligan, Diamond, Glahn, Ritch, & 
Maples, 2007) and UPSA-Brief (Mausbach, Harvey, Goldman, Jeste, & Patterson, 
2007) appeared to have the strongest features. For attainment measures, the 
Validation of Everyday Real-World Outcomes (VALERO) (Harvey et al., 2011) 
project compared a range of measures using diff erent sources of information. 
Th e Specifi c Levels of Functioning (SLOF) scale (Schneider & Struening, 1983), 
a global measure of social, everyday living, and vocational outcomes, based on 
clinician ratings that combined self- and informant-reports, performed the best 
overall. Th ese measures will likely be increasingly used in clinical trials for new 
treatments focused on neurocognition and may also be useful for bringing greater 
uniformity to future studies of social cognition and functional disability. 
 ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SOCIAL COGNITION 
AND FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME 
 A key motivation to study social cognition in schizophrenia is to explain the 
heterogeneity of functional outcome that is evident among people with schizo-
phrenia. For example, misperceptions during social interactions could adversely 
impact how people with schizophrenia interpret the behavior of others, which 
may result in interpersonal confl icts and/or social withdrawal. In support of this 
expectation, a growing literature demonstrates associations between social cogni-
tion and various aspects of community functioning. 
 In 2006, Couture and colleagues (Couture, Penn, & Roberts, 2006) published the 
fi rst major review of the literature in this area. Th is descriptive, qualitative review 
included 23 studies and considered four aspects of social cognition: EP, SP, AB, 
and ToM. Regarding outcome, two aspects of functional competence (social skills, 
social problem solving) and two aspects of functional attainment (social behavior 
within a psychiatric inpatient milieu, community functioning as assessed by vari-
ous subjective and objective measures) were considered. Th e review documented 
solid initial support for cross-sectional correlations between social cognition and 
outcome. Results were strongest for the social cognitive domain of SP, with 10 out 
of 12 studies showing signifi cant relations with competence and attainment mea-
sures. Emotion perception showed a consistent, although less robust, relationship 
to both types of outcome in nine out of 10 studies. Th e considerably smaller num-
ber of available studies for ToM ( n  = 4) and AS ( n = 2) provided initial support 
for their functional relevance. Th e review thus documented consistent relations 
between social cognition and functioning, although some limitations of available 
studies were noted, including (a) uncertainty as to whether social cognition is 
more strongly related to functional capacity as compared to functional outcome, 
(b) nearly all studies were cross-sectional, and (3) more than half of the studies 
included chronically ill hospitalized patients. 
 Th e signifi cant linkages described by Couture and colleagues were recently rep-
licated and extended in a meta-analysis by Fett and colleagues in 2011 (Fett et al., 
www.ebook3000.com

Social Cognition and Functional Outcome in Schizophrenia 
157
2011). Th is review initially considered the same domains of social cognition and 
functional outcome as Couture et al. but used stricter criteria for inclusion in the 
quantitative analyses. Attributional style was ultimately excluded from the analy-
sis because only one appropriate study was identifi ed. For the remaining three 
social cognitive domains, there were suffi  cient numbers of studies to examine 
their relations to the functional outcome domain of “community functioning” 
(again, including various subjective and objective measures). Results indicated 
that community functioning was strongly related to each of the social cognitive 
domains, with mean correlations as follows: ToM = .48 in three studies, SP = .41 
in three studies, and EP = .31 in fi ve studies. Aside from the fi ndings for com-
munity functioning, available studies permitted examination of only two other 
specifi c social cognition-functional outcome relationships, although both were 
signifi cant. Specifi cally, EP had a mean correlation of .22 with social behavior 
in the psychiatric milieu across six studies, and SP had a mean correlation of .24 
with social skills across fi ve studies. None of the signifi cant eff ects reported in this 
review was moderated by gender, age, or inpatient status. Although this study pro-
vides support for the general conclusions of Couture et al., it should be noted that 
the relatively small number of studies precludes fi rm conclusions about whether 
specifi c aspects of social cognition are associated with specifi c aspects of func-
tional outcome. 
 In addition to the cross-sectional relations between social cognition and func-
tional outcome documented in chronically ill patients in the above reviews, we 
are also learning more about when in the course of schizophrenia these rela-
tionships are detectable, as well as the longitudinal predictive validity of social 
cognition. A few studies have documented associations between aspects of social 
cognition and functional outcome during the early, recent-onset phase of schizo-
phrenia in community dwelling outpatients (Addington, Saeedi, & Addington, 
2006b; Williams et al., 2008) indicating that these associations are evident during 
the early course of schizophrenia. It remains unclear whether these relationships 
are detectable in vulnerable subjects prior to illness onset. Although both social 
cognitive impairments and functional attainment impairments have been iden-
tifi ed in prodromal samples (Addington, Penn, Woods, Addington, & Perkins, 
2008b; Green et al. in press; Pinkham et al., 2007), no published studies have 
demonstrated a signifi cant linkage between these two domains prior to illness 
onset. 
 A few studies have also provided longitudinal support for social cognition pro-
spectively predicting functional outcome (Addington et al., 2006b; Horan et al. in 
press; Kee, Green, Mintz, & Brekke, 2003). For example, in a recent study from 
our group (Horan et al., in press), 55 fi rst-episode schizophrenia patients com-
pleted baseline and 12-month follow-up assessments of three domains of social 
cognition (EP, ToM, SP), as well as an objective measure of social attainment and 
symptom assessments. As shown in Figure 6.2, a composite score based on all 
three social cognitive tests demonstrated good longitudinal stability with a test–
retest correlation .87. Higher baseline and 12-month social cognition scores were 
both robustly associated with signifi cantly better work functioning, independent

d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
living, and social functioning at the 12-month follow-up assessment. Th e results 
were particularly robust for the domain of work functioning (displayed in the 
 fi gure). In line with earlier fi ndings from our group (Kee et al., 2003), cross-lagged 
panel analyses were consistent with a causal model in which baseline social cogni-
tion drove later functional outcome in the domain of work, above and beyond the 
contribution of symptoms. Th ese results support the notion that social cognitive 
impairments longitudinally predict later levels of functioning. 
 In summary, a solid database documents signifi cant cross-sectional associa-
tions between social cognition and diff erent aspects of functional outcome. Th e 
literature is not suffi  ciently mature to know whether particular social cognitive 
processes are more specifi cally related to functional capacity versus functional 
attainment, or to particular social, vocational, or independent living domains. 
Research is also moving beyond studies of bivariate correlations in chronically 
ill patients to identify both when and how social cognition infl uences functional 
outcome. In the following section, we expand on this theme by examining how 
social cognition interfaces with a well-established determinant of outcome— 
neurocognition—to impact functioning. 
 THE ADDED VALUE OF SOCIAL COGNITION 
 Because neurocognition and social cognition are both impaired and both related 
to poor functional outcome in schizophrenia, a fundamental question is whether

fi rst-episode schizophrenia. Cross-lagged panel analysis revealed a signifi cant  diff erence 
(Z > 2.0) between the correlations on the two diagonals. Specifi cally, the correlation 
between baseline Social Cognition and Work Functioning at follow-up (r = .57) was 
signifi cantly larger than the correlation between baseline Work Functioning and Social 
Cognition at follow-up (r = .25) aft er accounting for all other cross-sectional and 
 longitudinal correlations in the fi gure. Th e diff erence between the correlations on the

line and follow-up. Th ese results are consistent with a model in which baseline levels of 
social cognition drove later 12-month functional attainment in the domain of work.

Social Cognition and Functional Outcome in Schizophrenia

neurocognition and social cognition provide uniquely informative data for under-
standing outcome. If a very large overlap existed between them, it would raise 
questions about the value of considering social cognition as an additional factor. 
We now turn to an overview of three lines of investigation relevant to the question 
of social cognition’s “added value.” 
 Neurocognitive and social cognitive tasks oft en share cognitive processes, such 
as working memory and perception, and therefore are clearly associated. Indeed, 
signifi cant correlations are found between performance on measures of social 
cognition and neurocognition in schizophrenia (e.g., Kee, Kern, & Green, 1998; 
Pinkham & Penn, 2006; Sergi & Green, 2002). However, the magnitude of these 
relations is generally moderate. Furthermore, studies using confi rmatory factor 
analysis in schizophrenia patients (Allen, Strauss, Donohue, & van Kammen, 
2007; Bell, Tsang, Greig, & Bryson, 2009; Sergi et al., 2007) or exploratory fac-
tor analysis in participants with psychosis or heightened vulnerability to psycho-
sis (van Hooren et al., 2008; Williams et al., 2008) indicate that models fi t better 
when the two domains are separated, compared to when they are combined. Th e 
general conclusion from these studies is that social cognition in schizophrenia is 
associated with neurocognition, but is not redundant with it. 
 A related question is whether social cognition and neurocognition show dif-
ferential correlations with functional outcome in schizophrenia. Th is topic was 
addressed in the recent meta-analyses by Fett et al. (2011), which directly com-
pared the relative strength of correlations for social cognitive versus neurocogni-
tive measures. Based on available studies, this issue could be most clearly evaluated 
with regard to the domain of “community functioning.” Social cognitive measures 
accounted for an average of 16% of the variance in community functioning, which 
was signifi cantly larger than the 6% of variance accounted for by composite mea-
sures of neurocognition (as well as by nearly all individual neurocognitive domains 
considered). Th e domain of ToM accounted for the social cognition advantage. 
No diff erential correlations for the other outcome domains were reported (despite 
some trends favoring social cognition), although the number of studies available 
for these comparisons was small. Th us, available evidence indicates that social 
cognition, particularly ToM, shows a stronger relation to community functioning 
than does neurocognition. 
 Along these lines, several studies have addressed the question of whether social 
cognition accounts for additional unique variance in outcome, above and beyond 
the contribution of neurocognition. Several studies using correlation and regres-
sion techniques have now evaluated this issue. It does indeed appear from several 
datasets that social cognition contributes incremental validity for both real-world 
functional attainment and functional capacity beyond that provided by neu-
rocognition (e.g., Corrigan & Toomey, 1995; Ihnen, Penn, Corrigan, & Martin, 
1998; Mancuso, Horan, Kern, & Green, 2011; Pan, Chen, Chen, & Liu, 2009; 
Penn, Spaulding, Reed, & Sullivan, 1996; Pinkham & Penn, 2006; Poole, Tobias, & 
Vinogradov, 2000; Roncone et al., 2002). Th us, neurocognition and social cogni-
tion appear to be separable domains that uniquely contribute to the prediction of 
functional outcome in schizophrenia.

 In summary, available data support the added value of considering social cog-
nition and neurocognition as separate domains in studies of functional outcome. 
In addition to showing only moderate relations to neurocognition, social cognition 
appears to be more strongly related to functional attainment than is neurocogni-
tion and to contribute incremental variance to various aspects of functioning. In 
the following section, we consider a series of modeling studies that have examined 
exactly how these two processes interact to impact functioning. 
 MODELING STUDIES: SOCIAL COGNITION AS A MEDIATOR 
 Linkages among neurocognition, social cognition, and functional outcome are 
well documented. However, the pathway(s) through which neurocognitive or 
social cognitive defi cits ultimately lead to poor functioning are complex and likely 
involve a host of intervening and interacting variables. As illustrated in Figure 6.3, 
M.F. Green and Nuechterlein (1999) proposed that social cognition functions as 
a key mediator between neurocognition on the one hand and functional outcome 
on the other. In a mediation model, the relationship between an independent 
variable X (neurocognition) and a dependent variable Y (functional outcome) 
is explained by a third intervening, or mediating, variable M (social cognition). 
Consider an example of mediation from the depression literature. Neuroticism (X) 
is a personality trait that shows consistent relations to depression (Y). However, 
both neuroticism and depression are associated with rumination, and rumina-
tion (M) has been found to mediate the relation between neuroticism and depres-
sion (e.g., Roelofs, Huibers, Peeters, Arntz, & van Os, 2008). Th is suggests that 
rumination is a mechanism or route by which neuroticism ultimately leads to 
depression and is, therefore, an important intervention target. Using statistical 
modeling approaches, such as path analysis and structural equation modeling,

Social Cognition and Functional Outcome in Schizophrenia 
161
schizophrenia researchers have begun to empirically test whether social cognition 
mediates the link between neurocognitive impairments and functional outcome. 
 To our knowledge, 14 published studies from 12 independent datasets have 
evaluated whether social cognitive variables mediate the relation between neu-
rocognition and one or more aspects of functional outcome in schizophrenia. 
Th ese studies are summarized in Table 6.1. Th e sample sizes range from 26 to 
178 individuals in inpatient and/or outpatient settings. Regarding functional 
outcome domains, eight studies evaluated aspects of attainment measures, three 
examined competence measures, two examined a combination of competence 
and attainment measures, and one focused on 12-month psychosocial rehabilita-
tion success. Across the diverse samples, statistical methods, neurocognitive and 
social cognitive measures, and outcome domains refl ected in these 14 studies, 13 
reported support for a mediating role for social cognition. Th e hypothesis that 
social cognition serves as a mediator in explaining outcome has thus received 
remarkably consistent support to date. 
 Although the available evidence strongly supports the conceptualization of 
social cognition as a mediator, some methodological aspects of these studies war-
rant comment. First, the majority of studies were cross-sectional, which limits any 
inferences that can be made about causality. Second, certain subject characteris-
tics may be relevant to consider in understanding these mechanistic relations. For 
example, the one study that failed to support a mediating role for social cognition 
used a unique inpatient forensic sample of patients who been hospitalized as an 
alternative to incarceration (Nienow, Docherty, Cohen, & Dinzeo, 2006). Th ird, 
the range of social cognitive variables considered has been fairly narrow, focus-
ing largely on aff ect and social perception, and the role of other social cognitive 
variables remains to be explored. Fourth, open questions remain about the opti-
mal modeling of functional outcome variables. For example, it remains unclear 
whether competence measures, which assess what one can do under ideal labora-
tory conditions, should be modeled either together with or separate from attain-
ment measures of actual real-world functioning. It is also possible that diff erent 
causal pathways lead to diff erent aspects of outcome (e.g., competence measures, 
objective attainment measures, subjective attainment measures). 
 A fi nal consideration is that these models typically leave over half the variance 
in outcome unaccounted for. Th us, incorporating additional variables believed to 
impact outcome into these models (which will require larger sample sizes) will 
more comprehensively account for outcome. Th is type of work has already begun 
by examining the interactive contributions of variables such as negative symp-
toms, motivational processes, emotional experience and reactivity, dysfunctional 
attitudes, and metacognition (Couture, Granholm, & Fish, 2011; Gard, Fisher, 
Garrett, Genevsky, & Vinogradov, 2009; Lysaker et al., 2010.; Mathews & Barch, 
2010; Rassovsky, Horan, Lee, Sergi, & Green, 2011; Tso, Grove, & Taylor, 2010). 
 In summary, schizophrenia researchers are developing a clearer understanding 
of how social cognition contributes to poor functioning. Recent statistical model-
ing studies implicate social cognition as a key intervening step between neurocog-
nition and functional outcome, suggesting that social cognition is more proximal

Social Cognition and Functional Outcome in Schizophrenia

to outcome than is neurocognition in the chain of causal factors that ultimately 
lead to poor functional outcome. Further, when social cognition is included in 
statistical models, the direct relationship between neurocognition and function-
ing is oft en reduced to near zero (referred to as  full mediation ). 
 Th ese fi ndings indicate that social cognition is a rational target for 
 interventions—the proximity of social cognition to outcome suggests that 
improvements in this domain may generalize better to improvements in daily 
functioning than will improvements in neurocognition. Because social cognition 
serves as both an independent predictor and a mediator of outcome, it seems 
likely that a specifi c focus on neurocognition alone will not be suffi  cient to help 
patients achieve a full functional recovery. In terms of other clinical implications, 
these fi ndings strongly support the importance of assessing each patient’s level of 
social cognition. Finally, these fi ndings support the potential value of social cog-
nition as an important target for novel treatment development using both phar-
macological and psychosocial approaches (as discussed in other chapters). 
 CONCLUSION 
 Social cognition is an important area of study in schizophrenia for several rea-
sons, and one of them is its relationship to functioning. Th is chapter provides an 
overview of the associations between social cognition and functional outcome in 
schizophrenia. Th e studies in this area have primarily included aff ect and social 
perception, but there is increasing attention paid to other aspects of social cogni-
tion, including ToM and attributional bias. Nonetheless, some areas are largely 
missing altogether (e.g., empathy, emotion in biological motion). Studies of out-
come have considered two distinct types of outcome; although a few have con-
sidered competence measures (i.e., simulations of daily life), most have examined 
self-report measures of daily functioning in the community. As research on link-
ages to outcome progresses, alternative functional assessment approaches, such as 
in-community observational methods or experience sampling methods (Bromley 
& Brekke, 2010), may shed further light on this issue. 
 At this time, a critical mass of studies have examined social cognition and 
functional outcome, and a large subset of these studies (14 publications based 
on 12 independent databases) have used sophisticated modeling techniques to 
evaluate pathways by which neurocognition, social cognition, and functional out-
come interact. All except one of these studies demonstrated mediation by social 
cognition. Based on these studies, several conclusions are warranted about social 
cognition in schizophrenia: it is not wholly redundant with nonsocial neurocog-
nition, but instead provides unique information; it has consistent relationships to 
outcome, and a meta-analysis shows these to be stronger than the relationships 
between neurocognition and outcome; it acts as a mediator between neurocogni-
tion and outcome, indicating that it is an important intervening variable in the 
pathway to recovery; and, in all of the models considered so far, it is positioned 
more proximal to outcome than is neurocognition. Th us, an emerging literature is

helping to explain the determinants of outcome in schizophrenia and is also pro-
viding an empirical foundation and clear rationale for development of new social 
cognitive intervention approaches. Th ese interventions off er strong potential for 
greater functional recovery in our patients.

 Although the majority of eff orts to examine behavioral defi cits in schizophrenia 
have focused on clinical symptoms and neurocognition, the past 25 years have 
seen a growing literature on  social cognition , defi ned as the ability to process and 
apply social and interpersonal relevant information. Within this area, a primary 
research topic has been emotion processing. Th e general area of emotion process-
ing can be separated into the diff erent dimensions of expression, recognition, and 
experience. In schizophrenia, altered functions have been reported in all three 
dimensions to a degree not found in other psychiatric disorders. Expression and 
recognition of emotions are dependent on either production or reception of emo-
tional content that is conveyed through a limited number of channels that, most 
importantly, include face, voice, and language. Th e majority of the existing lit-
erature on conveyance of emotions in healthy persons and in psychiatric disor-
ders has focused on either facial or voice channels of communications. Th e use 
of language in schizophrenia has been the subject of a number of investigations 
(Covington et al., 2005) that have focused on speech morphology, syntax, and 
semantics; however, the use of language to convey emotional information remains 
to be examined. Similarly, abnormal use of motor functions for communication 
of emotions, including gestures and body posture, are common in schizophre-
nia, and these abnormalities may stem from clinical symptoms, medication side 
eff ects, or may refl ect neurodevelopmental disturbances. However, the extent to 
which motor functions beyond facial expressions for conveyance of emotional 
information is aff ected in schizophrenia remains to be studied. 
 Th is chapter focuses on areas of emotion processing in schizophrenia that have 
been subject to a representative number of investigations. For emotion expression 
and recognition, this will include facial and speech channels, and for emotion 
experience, we will summarize both subjective and more objective observations 
that the fi eld has relied upon to advance our understanding of hedonic experience 
in schizophrenia. Th e following sections will review how dimensions of emotion

processing are aff ected in schizophrenia, with particular emphasis placed on the 
existing measurements of these functions, their relationship to stages of illness, 
and the potential for therapeutic interventions. 
 EMOTION EXPRESSION IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 
 Diminished expression of emotions has been recognized since the earliest descrip-
tions of schizophrenia. Now viewed as a characteristic negative symptom of the 
disorder, impairment consists of prominent features that are oft en used in diag-
nosis: diminished facial and vocal expression, inappropriate aff ect, and paucity 
of expressive gestures. Although diminished vocal expression, use of expressive 
gestures, and inappropriate aff ect can be measured with widely used clinical mea-
sures of negative symptoms, diminished facial expression has received the most 
attention in studies of impaired emotion expression and has been found to relate 
to interpersonal engagement and social functioning (Bellack, Morrison, Wixted, 
& Mueser, 1990; Breier, Schreiber, Dyer, & Pickar, 1991). Studies have shown that 
blunted aff ect is inherent and stable throughout illness, more common among 
men than women, and can precede the onset of psychosis by many years (Walker, 
Grimes, Davis, & Smith, 1993). Notably, there has been a shift  in the categorization 
of inappropriate aff ect. Once grouped in the negative symptom domain with fl at 
aff ect, inappropriate aff ect is now viewed as independent of negative symptomatol-
ogy and more closely related to the disorganization dimension of schizophrenia. 
Although generally most studies have supported aff ective fl attening rather than 
inappropriate aff ect (e.g., smiling or assuming facial expressions that are incongru-
ent with the situation or content of communication), inappropriate aff ect remains 
important when considering defi cits in facial expression of emotion. If present, 
inappropriate aff ect will result in misinterpretation of emotional valence during 
social interactions, thus possibly contributing to poorer social outcome. 
 Studies that focus on vocal prosody (e.g., Hoekert, Kahn, Pijnenborg, & 
Aleman, 2007), or the emotional tone of voice, are limited in number and have 
predominantly shown that persons with schizophrenia show defi cits compared 
to healthy controls in both spontaneous prosody (elicited through the telling of 
emotional stories) and prosody repetition (repeating a neutral sentence with a 
given emotional tone) (Leentjens et al., 1998). However, people with schizophre-
nia did not show defi cits in stress prosody expression, as tested by reading a sen-
tence and stressing a nominated word (Edwards, Jackson, & Pattison, 2002). Th e 
use of expressive gestures beyond the face, such as gesticulation and body posture, 
has not yet been systematically explored. 
 Assessment of Facial Affective Flattening 
 Th e major problem in assessment of fl at or blunted aff ect has been the lack of reli-
able, objective, and effi  cient methods for quantifying facial expressions. In clinical

settings, observer-based measures of negative symptoms, such as the Positive and 
Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; Kay, Fiszbein, & Opler, 1987) and the Scale 
for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS; Andreasen, 1982) are widely 
used to rate the presence and severity of aff ective fl attening. Th ese scales are oft en 
administered in nonstandardized, clinical settings and provide an overall measure 
of facial expressivity. Although such scales remain widely used, a number of eff orts 
have been made to further elucidate and quantify facial expression measurement. 
Initial studies of facial aff ect in schizophrenia beyond standardized rating scales 
utilized judges who were asked to match photographs of posed aff ects with emo-
tion words (happy, sad, angry, surprised, or afraid) (Gottheil, Th ornton, & Exline, 
1976) and identify aff ective themes (happy, sad, or angry) in silent fi lm clips of 
subjects telling emotional stories (Gottheil, Paredes, Exline, & Winkelmayer, 
1970). Th ese studies found that posed expressions were intact whereas spontane-
ous expressions were decreased in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy 
controls. 
 Th e Facial Action Coding System (FACS), created by Ekman and Friesen 
in 1978, remains the gold standard for qualitative analysis of facial emotional 
expressions. By studying how contraction of diff erent facial muscles changes 
the appearance in the face, Ekman and Friesen identifi ed discrete facial muscle 
movements called  action units , which form the basis for the scoring system. To 
render a score, trained human coders dissect individual facial expressions into 
the presence or absence of action units that produced the expression. Problems 
with the system are that it requires extensive training of human coders, and it 
may not be sensitive to subtle eff ects. Emotion FACS (Friesen, 1986) and Facial 
Expression Coding System (FACES) (Kring, Kerr, Smith, & Neale, 1993) are 
two measures that have been simplifi ed from the original FACS and adapted 
for clinical research. Emotion FACS, or EMFACS, only identifi es the presence 
or absence of muscle movements associated with the predicted expression of a 
particular emotion. FACES provides ratings of overall dynamic facial changes 
according to the number of positive and negative facial expressions, intensity, 
and duration. 
 Studies employing FACS ratings have generally supported the existence of 
impaired facial expressions in schizophrenia. Tr é meau et al. (2005) examined 
emotional expressions in a series of experiments that utilized traditional and 
video-adapted FACS ratings to assess both posed and spontaneous expressions. 
Th e authors reported that schizophrenia patients exhibited defi cits in both spon-
taneous and posed expressions; however, these defi cits were similar to those 
exhibited by depressed patients. A study employing traditional FACS ratings 
of both posed and evoked expressions captured by still photography (Kohler et 
al., 2008a) supported clinical observations of fl at and inappropriate aff ect, and 
additionally revealed specifi c diff erences involving the  Duchenne smile for happy 
expressions and decreased furrowed brows in negative emotion expressions. 
Elements that constitute the Duchenne smile, such as eyelids tightened and 
cheeks raised, are necessary for a smile to appear sincere, and these movements 
were less common in schizophrenia. Based on FACES ratings, schizophrenia 

176 
descriptive and experimental research
patients were shown to exhibit less expressivity as measured by the Positive and 
Negative Aff ect Schedule (PANAS), yet similar experience based on subjective 
ratings in response to emotion-inducing fi lm clips (Kring, Kerr, Smith, & Neal, 
1993). Based on induction by autobiographical experiences, overall duration 
and frequencies of emotion expressions indicated aff ective fl attening and inap-
propriate aff ect in patients, as evidenced by neutral and non-target expressions. 
Separated by emotion, schizophrenia patients also exhibited impaired expres-
sion of happy, sad, and anger emotions, but not of fear or disgust (Kohler et al., 
2008b). 
 Eff orts toward a more objective measurement of facial expression include the 
employment of facial electromyography (EMG) and computerized algorithms for 
automated analysis. Facial EMG involves the placement of electrodes on two facial 
muscles groups, the corrugator and zygomaticus muscles. Studies utilizing facial 
electromyography in response to emotional fi lms (Mattes, Schneider, Heimann, 
& Birbaumer, 1995; Earnst et al., 1996) and pictures (Kring, Kerr, & Earnst, 1999) 
have yielded mixed results, suggesting similar expressions (Earnst et al., 1996; 
Mattes et al., 1995), reduced zygomaticus activity during happy fi lms (Mattes 
et al., 1995), and, possibly, inappropriate expressions in persons with schizo-
phrenia (Kring et al., 1999). Limitations of facial EMG studies include possible 
overidentifi cation of expressions that cannot be discerned in real-life settings and 
oversimplifi cation of minute expressions resulting from measurement of only two 
facial muscle groups. Preliminary applications of computerized algorithms for 
automated analysis have been successful in developing distinct quantitative pro-
fi les for four universal emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, and fear (Verma et al., 
2005). When applied to schizophrenia patients, quantitative analysis revealed dis-
tinct diff erences compared to controls, especially in the case of anger, and scores 
correlated with clinical severity of fl at aff ect (Alvino et al., 2007). Future expan-
sion of computerized instrumentations may have wide-ranging clinical implica-
tions in patient populations suff ering aff ective defi cits and may include, among 
others, examination of spontaneous emotion expression in dyadic interactions 
and real-life settings. 
 Association with Clinical Course 
 Many studies suggest that diminished emotion expression may precede the onset 
of psychosis by many years. In one such study, home movies with children who 
later developed schizophrenia were analyzed for facial expressivity (Walker et al., 
1993). Girls who later developed schizophrenia demonstrated fewer joy expres-
sions compared with other emotional expressions. Both boys and girls who sub-
sequently developed schizophrenia displayed increased negative aff ect when 
compared to same-sex siblings who did not go on to develop the disorder. Studies 
utilizing retrospective questionnaire methods have also shown that fl at aff ect may 
precede the onset of psychosis (H ä fner, Maurer, & L ö ffl  er, 2003) and increase dur-
ing the putative prodromal phase (Malla et al., 2002), and fl at aff ect in persons

with schizophrenia is associated with poorer premorbid adjustment from child-
hood into adulthood before the onset of illness (Gur et al., 2006). Diminished 
facial expression has been shown to be a stable feature throughout illness, as 
evidenced in studies of spontaneous and posed expressions in both acute and 
post-acute stages (Gaebel & W ö lwer 2004; Tr é meau et al., 2005). Furthermore, it 
oft en continues into chronic stages following the amelioration of active psychotic 
symptoms, and, when compared to patients without fl at aff ect, it has been associ-
ated with lower quality of life and poor functional outcome (Gur et al., 2006; Ho, 
Nopoulos, Flaum, Arndt, & Andreasen, 1998; Milev, Ho, Arndt, & Andreasen, 
2005). 
 Th e potential infl uence of extrapyramidal side eff ects on emotion expression 
remains unclear. Emotion expression can be worsened by the administration of 
neuroleptics with strong nigrostriatal dopaminergic blockade (Krakowski, Czobor, 
& Volavka, 1997; Rifk in, Quitkin, & Klein, 1975; Van Putten & May, 1978), as 
akinesia, or the loss of power of voluntary movement, represents a potential side 
eff ect of these medications. Although some studies have indicated an adverse 
eff ect of antipsychotic medications on facial expression (Gaebel & W ö lwer, 2004); 
others that have examined patients both on and off  antipsychotics revealed no 
clear eff ect on expressivity of emotional experience (Earnst et al., 1996; Kring 
et al., 1999). 
 Emotional Contagion 
 Emotional contagion is the phenomenon in verbal and nonverbal communica-
tion whereby individuals automatically mirror the facial expressions and moods 
of others. According to Hatfi eld et al. (1994), the process begins with the percep-
tion of others’ facial expressions, which is followed by the observer’s imitation 
in the form of covert, rapid, and involuntary movements (known as  rapid facial 
mimicry ). Th e eff ect of rapid facial mimicry is believed to be an aff erent feedback 
that induces the perceived emotion in the observer, a potential requisite for the 
experience of empathy. Th is phenomenon is similar to the “chameleon eff ect,” in 
which a person unconsciously mimics the postures, mannerisms, facial expres-
sions, and behaviors to refl ect that of others in one’s current social environ-
ment (Chartrand & Bargh, 1999). Chartrand and Bargh (1999) have shown that 
mimicry improves the quality of interpersonal interactions and increases lik-
ing between interaction partners. Furthermore, they revealed that the personal 
characteristic of empathy increases one’s likelihood to use the chameleon eff ect. 
Th e mirror neuron system has been linked to these aspects of social cognition. 
Evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigations 
suggests that this process is achieved through a simulation mechanism (Carr 
et al., 2003). To date, studies utilizing indirect measures of mirror neuron activ-
ity have yielded compelling results. In an experiment designed to assess activa-
tion of mirror neurons with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the 
left  primary motor cortex, subjects observed arm movements while concurrent 

178 
descriptive and experimental research
motor facilitation in thumb muscles was measured. Cortical excitability with 
TMS was intact in persons with schizophrenia; however, motor facilitation dur-
ing the experiment was reduced (Enticott et al., 2008). In the fi rst assessment of 
rapid facial mimicry in schizophrenia patients, Varcin et al. (2010) utilized elec-
tromyography to quantify activity in two major facial muscle groups while sub-
jects viewed happy and angry expressions and found that schizophrenia patients 
exhibited atypical facial mimicry compared to controls. Th us, the decreased 
ability to appropriately perceive and mimic other’s facial expressions, emotions, 
and behaviors may be one explanation for the social impairment commonly 
observed in schizophrenia. 
 It has been posited that schizophrenia patients’ diffi  culties in emotional inter-
action may stem from a defi cit in imitation abilities, which infl uences their ability 
to induce emotional contagion in others or to experience emotional contagion 
themselves. A number of preliminary studies lend support to the theory. In stud-
ies in which subjects were asked to imitate diff erent facial emotion expressions, 
schizophrenia patients were less accurate at imitating and producing facial expres-
sions compared to healthy controls (Park, Matthews, & Gibson, 2008; Schwartz, 
Mastropaolo, Rosse, Mathis, & Deutsch, 2006), and imitation accuracy strongly 
correlated with social competence (Park et al., 2008). In a task designed to assess 
emotional contagion, subjects were shown happy, sad, and neutral faces presented 
simultaneously with arrows, and instructed to pull their lip corners up or down 
according to the arrows (as in smiling or frowning) (Falkenberg, Bartels, & Wild, 
2008). In healthy subjects, congruous movements (i.e., pulling lip corners up when 
seeing a happy face) are facilitated and dissonant movements inhibited. Th ese ten-
dencies, considered indicators of emotional contagion, were signifi cantly dimin-
ished among the schizophrenia subjects. 
 Treatment 
 To date, the fi eld lacks remediation eff orts focused on improving facial expres-
siveness. In a small number of persons with chronic schizophrenia, Schwartz 
et al. (2006) found impairment in imitation of facial expressions that did not 
improve with real-time feedback through use of a mirror. Findings from that 
study also provided support that imitating and practicing emotional expres-
sions may improve the accuracy of facial expressions. Social Cognition and 
Interaction Training (SCIT; Penn, Roberts, Munt, Jones, & Sheitman, 2005), an 
intervention with the purpose of improving social cognition and social func-
tioning among schizophrenia patients, utilizes facial mimicry in an attempt 
to help participants accurately perceive the emotions of others. Although the 
intervention includes exercises in facial expressivity, improved expressions 
themselves are not a target of the intervention. Given the important role of 
facial expression in interpersonal communication and its implications for 
social functioning, improving facial expressiveness should be a key therapeutic 
target in future research.

 EMOTION RECOGNITION 
 Recognition of expressions of emotion relies on abilities to analyze nonverbal 
and verbal communication. For nonverbal communication, this includes facial 
expressions, gesticulations, and body posture, and for verbal communication, the 
use of expressive language and speech pattern—or prosody—for conveyance of 
emotional content. 
 Facial Channel 
 Expression of emotions through the facial channel has been the most widely 
studied component of nonverbal emotion communication, based on the unique 
ability of the face to produce emotion expressions that are universally recogniz-
able. Recognition of facial expressions of emotions are instrumental constituents 
of nonverbal communication, and a large number of studies have underscored 
the severity of impairment in schizophrenia. In a recent meta-analysis (Kohler, 
Walker, Martin Healey, & Moberg, 2010) that included 86 studies published 
between 1970 and 2007, we examined relevant methodological, demographic, and 
illness-related factors that moderate the severity of emotion recognition impair-
ment. Th ere appeared no diff erence in eff ect sizes for studies employing identifi -
cation versus diff erentiation tasks, even though the two tests may be dependent 
on diff erent visual and other cognitive abilities. In addition, recognition abilities 
are related to social competence in persons with schizophrenia (Hooker & Park, 
2002; Ihnen, Penn, Corrigan, & Martin, 1998; Mueser et al., 1996; Vauth, R ü sch, 
Wirtz, & Corrigan, 2004) and predict later work functioning and independent liv-
ing (Kee, Green, Mintz, & Brekke, 2003). Although emotion recognition impair-
ment in schizophrenia has been well documented, it is questionable whether a 
diff erential defi cit (Chapman & Chapman, 1978) can be demonstrated against 
the more general impairment in facial processing (Archer, Hay, & Young, 1994; 
Edwards, Pattison, Jackson, & Wales, 2001; Johnston, Katsikitis, & Carr, 2001; Kerr 
and Neale, 1993; Kohler, Bilker, Hagendoorn, Gur, & Gur, 2000; Novic, Luchins, 
& Perline, 1984; Penn et al., 2000; Salem, Kring, & Kerr, 1996). Among other 
reasons, impaired emotion recognition may be related to the tendency of persons 
with schizophrenia to visually scan features of the face that are not important in 
the expression of a particular emotion (Loughland, Williams, & Gordon, 2002; 
Sasson et al., 2007).  
 Speech Channel 
 Prosody  represents the nonlexical cues in spoken language and can be divided 
into linguistic and emotional prosody. Although not mutually exclusive, linguis-
tic prosody refers to putting emphasis on certain aspects of a sentence in order 
to stress the information to be conveyed, whereas emotional prosody refers 

180 
descriptive and experimental research
to emotional tone of voice. As such, prosody contributes to the pragmatics of 
speech, that is, the context in which linguistic information is conveyed. Th e study 
of prosody is complex, as prosody changes considerably depending on language, 
culture, and even socioeconomic context, whereas for facial expressions there is 
agreement about a number of emotions that are universally recognized. Hoekert 
et al. (2007) performed a meta-analysis on more than 20 studies on prosody rec-
ognition in schizophrenia and control subjects, and they reported a very large 
statistical eff ect size that was not moderated by potential clinical moderators such 
as age, duration of illness, medication, and patient status, although the latter was 
not defi ned further. Th e authors concluded that the eff ect size is similar to that 
reported on cognitive functions in schizophrenia; therefore, prosody represents a 
key dysfunction that appears stable throughout diff erent stages of the illness. 
 Measurement 
 In general, task designs within facial emotion recognition studies can be separated 
into those that focus on identifi cation of specifi c emotions, typically choosing 
from a limited number of choices, and those that diff erentiate between diff ering 
types or intensities of emotion expressions. Although early investigations included 
non-standardized emotional stimuli, most subsequent studies have employed face 
stimuli developed by Ekman and Friesen (1978) or Gur et al. (2002). In addition, 
presentation of test stimuli has changed from paper to computerized adminis-
tration. Th e black-and-white stimuli created by Ekman and Friesen consist of 
posed facial expressions of universally recognized emotions, including happiness, 
sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. Pictures are of mostly middle-aged 
Caucasian posers, with more recent inclusion of Asian posers. Th e stimuli of 
Gur et al. include color faces expressing happy, sad, angry, fearful, and disgusted 
emotions in posed and evoked conditions, across adult age groups and diff erent 
ethnicities. 
 For prosody studies, stimuli tend to be more varied, but typically consist of 
audiotaped sentences or words of neutral content that are spoken aloud in an 
emotional intonation. Most prosody tasks are not validated, and only a few have 
been employed by diff erent investigators, such as the VOICE-ID by Kerr and 
Neale (1993). VOICE-ID contains 21 stimuli across six emotions narrated by male 
and female voices and is constructed similarly to the face emotion identifi cation 
by the same group, including happy, sad, anger, fear, surprise, and shame as target 
emotions. 
 Association with Clinical Course 
 Previous longitudinal studies in acutely ill patients and subsequent stabiliza-
tion (Addington & Addington 1998, Herbener, Hill, Marvin, & Sweeney, 2005; 
W ö lwer, Streit, Polzer, & Gaebel, 1996) indicate the potential unrelatedness of 
www.ebook3000.com

Emotion Processing in Schizophrenia 
181
emotion recognition abilities and clinical status in schizophrenia, similar to what 
has been shown for neurocognition (Keefe et al., 2006). Th is is consistent with 
the above-mentioned meta-analysis (Kohler et al., 2010), in which results did not 
support a specifi c eff ect of illness duration on facial emotion recognition abilities. 
Similarly, recent meta-analysis of the relationship of prosodic abilities with ill-
ness characteristics in schizophrenia failed to fi nd an eff ect of patient status, age, 
duration of illness, or medication status on prosody (Hoekert et al., 2007). Similar 
to facial recognition (Bediou et al., 2007), studies of recognition of prosody in 
early schizophrenia (Edwards et al., 2001; Kucharska-Pietura, David, Masiak, & 
Phillips, 2005) reported impairment. 
 Recent investigations, which are described in detail in Addington and Piskulic 
(2013, Chapter 10, this volume), have extended to persons at genetic or clini-
cal risk for schizophrenia in an attempt to examine whether emotion recognition 
impairment represents a vulnerability marker for the illness. 
 Treatment 
 Attempts to improve emotion processing in schizophrenia have focused mainly 
on emotion recognition and are described in more detail in other sections of this 
book. 
 EMOTION EXPERIENCE 
 Long-standing observations suggest that decreased or abnormal emotion experi-
ence represent characteristic and stable dysfunction in persons with schizophre-
nia. Emerging evidence has underscored that defi cits in emotion experience are 
particularly important for understanding social dysfunction and poor functional 
outcome in this illness. Despite the robust fi nding that both emotion expres-
sivity and recognition are diminished in schizophrenia, the degree of altered 
 experience—ranging from lack of emotion experience to depression and anxiety—
is not as well elucidated. Th is ambiguity relates, among other things, to diff erent 
methodologies for assessment and such factors as duration of illness (i.e., acute vs. 
chronic illness), comorbid psychopathology (i.e., depression, anxiety), cognitive 
defi cits, and individual trait diff erences. Th us, formulating a better understanding 
of how emotion is experienced in persons with schizophrenia is of critical impor-
tance when we pursue ways to treat these seemingly insidious symptoms. 
 Types of Emotion Experience and Association with Clinical Course 
 Anhedonia , defi ned as a diminished capacity to experience pleasure or positive 
emotions, is considered a cardinal feature of the negative symptom cluster associ-
ated with schizophrenia. Importantly, anhedonia does not represent diminished 

182 
descriptive and experimental research
capacity to experience  all  emotions, as schizophrenia patients are well known to 
exhibit signifi cant clinical symptoms refl ecting emotions, particularly depression 
and anxiety. Anhedonia itself is not specifi c to schizophrenia, and can be found in 
other disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders. 
In addition, it is not a ubiquitous symptom of schizophrenia, as some empiri-
cal studies report elevated levels of anhedonia in general, whereas other studies 
found a bimodal distribution of patients with and without anhedonia (Sch ü rhoff  
et al., 2003; Silver and Shlomo, 2002; Suslow, Roestel, Ohrmann, & Arolt, 2003). 
Recently, Strauss and Herbener (2011) used cluster and discriminant function 
analyses to try to identify subgroups of patients within schizophrenia that dif-
fer in their emotional experiences. Th ey showed that a minority of patients dis-
played an altered pattern of emotional responsiveness. When confronted with 131 
images from the International Aff ective Picture System (IAPS), 40% of patients 
rated negative stimuli as more unpleasant and arousing compared to controls. 
However, the majority of patients (60%) displayed similar responses as normal 
controls. Furthermore, the subgroup of patients who reported increased negative 
emotion also displayed more severe symptoms and more functional impairment 
as assessed by the PANSS, Chapman Anhedonia Scales (Chapman et al., 1976), 
and a quality of life measurement. 
 In regards to clinical course, longitudinal studies generally indicate that 
anhedonia refl ects a stable trait in schizophrenia rather than a temporary state 
(Herbener & Harrow, 2002; Rey et al., 1994). In most patients, anhedonia appears 
prominent during both acute and chronic stages of the illness (Horan, Kring, 
& Blanchard, 2005; Katsanis, Iacono, & Beiser, 1990; Laos, Boyer, & Legrand, 
1999) and does not progress remarkably over time. Empirical evidence also sug-
gests that anhedonia may predate the onset of illness (Erlenmeyer-Kimling et al., 
1993). Th is evidence supports Meehl’s model (1962) that posits that anhedonia is 
the expression of a genetic defect in the brain’s limbic system, which is involved 
with reward. 
 Conceptually, anhedonia can be divided into diff erent dimensions or types. 
One approach uses the nature of the pleasurable stimulus; for example, whether 
the hedonic experience is physical or social in nature. A study by Burbridge and 
Barch (2007) reported decreased arousal by negative stimuli in persons with 
schizophrenia, and increased social and physical anhedonia. Separating patients 
into defi cit and non-defi cit types revealed higher social and physical anhedonia 
associated with the defi cit syndrome (Kirkpatrick & Buchanan, 1990). Th is fi nding 
is in contrast to Earnst and Kring (1999), who reported defi cit patients to experi-
ence levels of positive and negative emotion that are equivalent to non-defi cit 
patients and controls. 
 In an eff ort to clarify the nature of anhedonia, very recent directions in research 
have focused on the importance of the temporal course of emotion experience. 
It has been suggested that anhedonia can be divided into the temporal compo-
nents of  consummatory ,  anticipatory , and  remembered pleasure.  Consummatory 
pleasure is that pleasure experienced while “in the moment” or while participat-
ing in an activity, interaction, or event.  Anticipatory pleasure is conceptualized 
www.ebook3000.com

Emotion Processing in Schizophrenia 
183
as the ability to anticipate that future events will be pleasurable and, therefore, 
is dependent on motivation. Studies examining these constructs have yielded 
mixed results but prove to be a promising future direction. Some studies suggest 
that whereas  consummatory pleasure is spared, patients with schizophrenia are 
impaired in anticipating future pleasure (Chan et al., 2010; Gard, Kring, Germans 
Gard, Horan, & Green, 2007), and this is seen cross-culturally (Chan et al., 2010). 
Subsequent studies, however, have failed to replicate these fi ndings (Strauss, 
Wilbur, Warren, August, & Gold, 2011; Tr é meau et al., 2010) and reported that 
anticipated pleasure was not impaired when compared to controls. However, 
despite similar levels of anticipated pleasure and motivation, patients showed a 
weaker relationship between motivation and consummatory pleasure (Tr é meau 
et al., 2010). Th erefore, in patients with schizophrenia, “in the moment” pleasur-
able experiences were less likely to induce incentive to repeat the task. In more 
general terms, patients may have diffi  culty translating their emotional experience 
into an appropriate goal-directed behavior (Heerey & Gold, 2007). Th e transla-
tion of pleasurable experiences into motivational states is referred to as “incen-
tive salience attribution” in reward theory (Berridge & Robinson, 2003), and 
schizophrenia-related defi cits in this capacity have also received recent support 
from a neuroimaging study (Waltz et al., 2009). 
 Empirical evidence has also suggested that people with schizophrenia have 
trouble maintaining an emotional experience over time, in order to guide behav-
ior. In one study, based on startle response to transient evocative emotional stim-
uli (Kring, Germans Gard, & Gard, 2011), patients did not maintain the response, 
whereas controls did, thus indicating that the motivational system did not remain 
engaged in patients. Th is “maintenance defi cit” or inability to maintain the rep-
resentation of an aff ective or emotional experience was also shown in an fMRI 
study. Patients and controls did not diff er in areas of brain activation when view-
ing emotion-eliciting pictures, but only controls maintained this pattern aft er 
the images were removed (Ursu et al., 2011), suggesting a disconnection in the 
prefrontal circuitry supporting the critical link between aff ect and goal-directed 
behavior. Ultimately, the inability to “hold in mind” representations of an emo-
tional experience may interfere with a patient’s pursuit of desired goals, contribut-
ing to avolition. 
 A second mechanism that may aff ect anhedonia in schizophrenia relates 
to the potential eff ect of memory impairments for emotional experiences. An 
inability to suffi  ciently remember pleasurable events may contribute to defi cits 
in goal-directed behavior and the symptoms of avolition and anhedonia. For 
example, in one study, working memory defi cits were found to moderate the rela-
tionship between physical anhedonia and participants’ emotional experience of 
positive stimuli (Burbridge & Barch, 2007). Similarly, Gard et al. (2011) showed 
that patients’ ability to recall both positive and negative stimuli decreased over 
time delay, even when given explicit instructions to remember their experience. 
Patients with schizophrenia appear to be impaired in remembering emotional 
experiences, particularly over delay periods, and this, in turn, may aff ect their 
motivation to engage in potentially pleasurable experiences.

descriptive and experimental research
 Last, anhedonia may refl ect impairments in reward processing (Gold, Waltz, 
Prentice, Morris, & Heerey, 2008). In a preference-conditioning task, Herbener 
(2009) found that both patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls demon-
strated a greater preference for the more frequently rewarded pattern. However, 
following a 24-hour delay, controls continued to demonstrate this pattern but 
patients did not. In sum, current research in schizophrenia suggests the pres-
ences of defi cits in reward processing or in memory of pleasurable events, rather 
than a defi cit in the ability to experience pleasure during a potentially rewarding 
experience. 
 Cohen et al. (2010) have suggested a two-process theory of schizophrenia-related 
emotional defi cits involving both ambivalence and apathy.  Ambivalence is charac-
terized by simultaneous activation of positive and negative emotions and refl ects 
a dysfunction in the ability to eff ectively inhibit negative emotions; whereas  apa-
thy is characterized by anhedonia and essentially no negative emotion. Although 
apathy is more commonly associated with defi cit syndrome patients and may be 
more central to the hedonic defi cit in schizophrenia, both processes are central 
constituents of negative symptomatology and are strongly associated with func-
tional impairment. An  aff ective trait represents the stable individual tendency 
to experience specifi c emotional states. In this personality-driven view, negative 
aff ectivity (NA; i.e., the tendency to view the world as threatening, problem-
atic, and distressing) and positive aff ectivity (PA; i.e., the tendency to engage in 
the world with energy and enthusiasm), represent two core features of emotion 
experience. Schizophrenia is characterized by abnormally high levels of NA and 
low PA throughout the illness course (Horan, Blanchard, Clark, & Green, 2008; 
Kring & Moran, 2008). Beyond experiencing a lack of enjoyment in pleasurable 
activities, it has also been shown that individuals with schizophrenia report less 
positive emotions (i.e., joy and happiness) and more negative emotions (i.e., fear, 
guilt, shame, anxiety) across a range of everyday activities (Tso, Grove, & Taylor, 
2010). 
 Depression  is common in schizophrenia, with the lifetime prevalence for a 
major depressive episode estimated to be 60%, much higher than the 8%-26% risk 
for the general population (Diwan et al., 2007; Martin et al., 1985). Anhedonia 
is also a common feature of depression and, therefore, unveiling the relationship 
among anhedonia, depression, and other clinical symptoms is critical in elucidat-
ing the nature of emotional experience in schizophrenia. Clinically, the anhedo-
nia of depression can be viewed as a “loss of pleasure in usually enjoyed activities,” 
whereas anhedonia of schizophrenia is a pervasive loss and diminished capacity 
to experience pleasure. Although overlap between depression and anhedonia may 
exist in schizophrenia and may be diffi  cult to diff erentiate clinically (Kollias et al., 
2008), there have been several factor analytic studies indicating that anhedonia 
and depression are separate constructs in the symptomatology of schizophrenia 
(Horan et al., 2005; Laos, Noisette, Legrand, & Boyer, 2000) and that they repre-
sent distinct psychopathological dimensions. 
 Depression is linked to suicide (Harris & Barraclough, 1997), which represents 
the leading cause of premature death among younger people with schizophrenia

(Caldwell & Gottesman, 1990). Th e rate of suicide in schizophrenia is about 10 
times that of the general population and claims the lives of between 4% and 13% 
of suff erers (Diwan et al., 2007; Martin, Cloninger, & Guse, 1985). Persons in the 
acute and early stages of illness are more likely to experience suicidality (Barrett 
et al., 2010; Bottlender, Strauss, & Moller, 2000). In one study, the majority of 
schizophrenia patients who completed suicide were found to be depressed in 
the months preceding their death, although other factors may have contributed 
(Montross et al., 2008). 
 Anxiety disorders, although quite frequent in schizophrenia, are poorly under-
stood and underrecognized. Anxiety symptoms and disorders can occur in any 
phase of the illness and may be exacerbated or triggered by unpleasant psychotic 
experiences, responses to adverse life events, and antipsychotics. Th e prevalence 
rate of anxiety disorders in schizophrenia has been reported to be as high as 50%, 
and includes posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive dis-
order (OCD), and social anxiety disorder, with social anxiety emerging as the 
most common anxiety disorder (Achim et al., 2011). Preliminary evidence sug-
gests that anxiety may be a core feature of schizophrenia unrelated to positive 
and negative symptoms. Social anxiety, however, may be easily misidentifi ed as a 
negative symptom (e.g., social avoidance and withdrawal or low motivation and 
withdrawal) and therefore may go undetected and untreated. Schizophrenia with 
comorbid anxiety has been associated with poorer quality of life, increased life-
time suicide attempts, and increased substance abuse (Pallantini, Querciolo, & 
Hollander, 2004). Th us, current research directions are aimed at designing new 
tools for assessment of anxiety disorders in persons with schizophrenia and new 
treatment interventions. 
 Th e common assumption exists that emotion expression mirrors experience. 
Clearly, if aff ective fl attening correlates with muted experience, this would read-
ily identify impaired emotion experience in schizophrenia. However, fi ndings 
suggest that a disjunction exists between patients’ outward expression and their 
internal experience of emotions. Individuals with schizophrenia may show 
blunted aff ect in the form of signifi cantly diminished expressions, but they report 
the same intensity of emotional experience as healthy controls. Th is fi nding has 
been confi rmed in studies employing social interactions and nonsocial evocative 
stimuli (emotional fi lm clips, tastes, cartoons) (Aghevli et al., 2003) and has been 
seen across laboratories independent of patients’ medication status and defi cit 
state. 
 It has been suggested that persons with schizophrenia may be unreliable 
reporters of their internal emotional states, underscoring the need for another 
proxy measure of emotion experience (Jaeger, Bitter, Czobor, & Volavka, 1990). 
Further complicating the picture is the fi nding that patients, despite their lack of 
expressivity and comparable experience to controls, show higher skin conduc-
tance reactivity to neutral, negative, and positive stimuli (i.e., fi lm clips) (Kring & 
Neale, 1996). Th erefore, we assume that outward displays of emotion in a person 
with schizophrenia may not represent an accurate refl ection of his or her internal 
emotional experiences. 

186 
descriptive and experimental research
 Assessment of Emotion Experience 
 Two main approaches exist to study emotion experience. One approach is to study 
mood states and more transient emotional experiences and examine whether 
positive or negative emotional states are related to other clinical symptoms or 
represent reactions to external events. Another approach focuses on more stable 
aff ective traits or individual diff erences in the tendency to experience emotion. 
Measured in this way, assessment of emotional experience requires informa-
tion about the frequency and intensity of subjective experiences across a range 
of situations that would normally be expected to elicit changes in positive and 
negative emotions. A number of commonly used rating scales exist that measure 
emotion experience and potential eff ects of treatment. Th ese scales are used to 
rate intensity of emotion experience, as well as symptoms of depression, anxi-
ety, and mania. Four common approaches exist to assess emotion experience in 
schizophrenia, including interview-based assessment, self-report trait measures, 
laboratory-based assessments, and experience sampling. 
 Interview 
 In an interview-based assessment, a trained administrator uses a semi-structured 
interview to elicit information about daily activities and subjective emotional 
experiences. Some commonly used measures include the Scale for the Assessment 
of Negative Symptoms (SANS; Andreasen, 1982), the Positive and Negative 
Symptom Rating Scale (PANSS; Kay et al., 1987), the Scale for Emotional Blunting 
(SEB; Abrams & Taylor, 1978), and the Schedule for the Defi cit Syndrome (SDS; 
Kirkpatrick et al., 1989). Each of these scales marginally diff ers in how emotional 
experiences are assessed. In a review by Horan et al. (2005), it was determined that 
anhedonia can be reliably assessed using the SANS anhedonia-asociality subscale, 
and this scale was deemed as the best available assessment tool at the time for 
measuring anhedonia. 
 A collaborative study is currently undergoing validation of a new negative symp-
tom assessment scale, the Clinical Assessment Inventory of Negative Symptoms 
(CAINS; Forbes et al., 2010). Th is assessment tool is unique in that ratings are based 
on the person’s self-reported motivation, interest, and desire, as well as on their 
actual behavior across social, vocational, and recreational domains. Th e CAINS 
includes measures of consummatory and anticipatory pleasure, in which persons 
report on pleasurable experiences they had in the past week and pleasurable expe-
riences they think they will have in the upcoming week across all the domains.  
 Questionnaires 
 Another way to measure hedonic ability is via self-report questionnaires; exam-
ples include the Chapman Social and Physical Anhedonia scales (Chapman et al., 
1976) and the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS; Gard, Germans 
Gard, Kring, & John, 2006). It has been questioned whether self-reports are a 
reliable way to measure anhedonia and experience. On one hand, self-report 
questionnaires limit the eff ects that social skills and verbal expressivity exert on

measurement in an interview setting. On the other hand, it is possible that cogni-
tive defi cits associated with schizophrenia might interfere with a patient’s ability 
to accurately remember his or her emotional experience in daily life and thus he 
or she may be over- or underreporting on his or her experiences. One way to over-
come this obstacle is to examine emotion experience during everyday life or dur-
ing emotion-induction procedures.  Experience sampling provides a naturalistic 
way of assessing emotional experiences. In experience sampling, patients are cued 
randomly throughout the day to record their current emotions and experiences, 
thus eliminating the eff ect of memory. In laboratory-based assessments, subjects 
are exposed to a standard set of pleasant, neutral, and negative stimuli, such as 
pictures, movies, and food. Laboratory studies usually use self-report measures 
and/or interviews. 
 Th e type and degree of abnormal emotional experience in schizophrenia seems 
to diff er based upon the method of assessment (i.e., self-report, experience sam-
pling, and interview-based or laboratory-based assessments). For example, patients 
typically report anhedonia and defi cits in emotional experience when interviews 
or questionnaires are used. Experience sampling studies indicate that patients 
report higher levels of negative emotion and lower levels of positive emotions in 
the course of their daily lives (Horan et al., 2005). Conversely, when patients are 
presented with controlled emotional stimuli (Kring & Neale, 1996), they report 
similar amounts of emotion experience as normal controls.  Valence (a dimension 
of pleasant to unpleasant) and  arousal (activation-deactivation) are considered 
two vital features of emotional experience. When fMRI is used to detect neural 
activity along with subjective valence and arousal ratings, blunted valence, but 
not arousal, was evident in response to emotional stimuli compared to controls 
(Dowd & Barch, 2010), thus suggesting that patients’ ability to be stimulated by 
emotionally evocative stimuli was intact. Higher levels of anhedonia, measured by 
the SANS global score and Chapman scales, were associated with blunted valence 
within patients and controls, and this fi nding correlated with amygdala and right 
ventral striatum activity in patients and with bilateral caudate activity in controls. 
Past research indicates that striatal activation is associated with the anticipation of 
pleasurable stimuli; thus, this may represent a failure to respond to positive expe-
riences and contribute to an inability to anticipate and desire future experiences. 
Th erefore, decreased ability to designate stimuli as rewarding might contribute 
to a lack of hedonic experience in patients. In sum, interview-based measures 
represent a viable starting point for assessing anhedonia and in detecting possible 
treatment eff ects. However, more specifi c probes based on experience sampling 
or brain-based laboratory measure are necessary to parse elements of arousal and 
valence that may contribute to altered emotion experience. 
 Treatment Approaches 
 Attempts at improving emotional responding in schizophrenia include both 
pharmacological and psychosocial interventions. Overall, second-generation 

188 
descriptive and experimental research
antipsychotics may allow for better patterns of emotional responsiveness than 
older medications (Fakra et al., 2008), and depressive symptoms in schizophrenia 
may respond to antidepressants. Other interventions to improve anhedonia and 
more generally negative symptoms have included trials with such diff erent agents 
as cognitive enhancers, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) agonists, neurosteroids, 
and antibiotics (Hanson, Healey, Wolf, & Kohler, 2010). Nonpharmacological 
interventions shown to reduce anhedonia have included approaches as diverse 
as pet therapy (Nathans-Barel et al., 2005), paid work programs (Bryson, Lysaker, 
& Bell, 2002), and cognitive-behavioral therapy (Turkington, Dudley, Warman, 
& Beck, 2006). With increasing focus on negative symptom research, there is 
hope that new psychopharmacological and psychosocial interventions will be 
developed that specifi cally address diff erent aspects of emotion experience in 
schizophrenia. 
 CONCLUSION 
 An extensive body of literature has documented that emotion processing is 
altered in schizophrenia along the diff erent dimensions of emotion expres-
sion, recognition, and, in some cases, experience. As a central constituent of 
social cognition, emotion processing exerts profound infl uences on interper-
sonal functioning and quality of life. Whereas illness-related characteristics, 
such as age, duration of illness, clinical symptoms, and treatment, show some 
relationship to these abilities, there is considerable stability in emotion pro-
cessing impairment following onset of illness. In addition, more recent inves-
tigations have documented that emotion processing is aff ected in persons at 
clinical and genetic or familial risk of schizophrenia, in support of the notion 
that emotion processing may represent a vulnerability marker for schizophre-
nia. Although assessment of emotion recognition is well established through 
the use of validated stimuli that can be reliably administered through comput-
erized measures, assessment of emotion expression and experience have relied 
on diverse methods that have yielded diff erent results with limited external 
validity. Future investigations of emotion expression and experience will likely 
benefi t from administration of computerized test probes and obtaining brain-
based measures that can link the observable phenotype with neurobehavioral 
functions.

 Characteristics of Theory of Mind 
Impairments in Schizophrenia  
 A H M A D   A B U - A K E L   A N D

 Th e ability to infer mental states has been variably referred to as  mentalizing ,  min-
dreading , and most commonly,  theory of mind (ToM). Th eory of mind, which is 
part of our metacognitive abilities that constitute one’s knowledge of one’s own 
cognitive processes, is essential for social and behavioral functioning in that it 
allows people to understand and predict behavior in terms of the state of their 
knowledge, intentions, beliefs, and desires. A large body of research now confi rms 
that metacognition in general, and ToM functioning in particular, is disrupted in 
patients with schizophrenia, and that such impairment appears specifi c in schizo-
phrenia rather than due to some executive functioning defi cit, general cogni-
tive impairment, or the presence of general psychopathology (for recent reviews 
and meta-analyses, see Bora, Yucel, & Pantelis, 2009; Br ü ne, 2005; Frith, 2004; 
Harrington et al., 2005a; Lee, Farrow, Spence, & Woodruff , 2004; Pickup, 2008; 
Sprong, Schothorst, Ellen, Hox, & Van England, 2007). 
 Although it appears clear that schizophrenia disrupts one’s mentalizing abili-
ties, the extent and nature to which ToM is impaired in schizophrenia remains 
unclear. Some report that ToM impairment in patients with schizophrenia is 
similar to that found in autism (e.g., Corcoran, Mercer, & Frith, 1995; Mazza, 
De Risio, Surian, Roncone, & Casacchia, 2001), including in individuals with 
high-functioning autism (Couture, Penn, Losh, Adolphs, Hurley, & Piven, 2010) 
and Asperger syndrome (Craig, Hatton, Craig, & Bentall, 2004). Others report 
that the severity of ToM impairment in schizophrenia is less severe than in autism 
(e.g., Pickup & Frith, 2001; Pilowsky, Yirmiya, Arbelle, & Mozes, 2000), and some 
even suggest the absence of any such defi cits when examined in the context of 
conversational interactions (McCabe, Leudar, & Antaki, 2004). 
 Such variation in ToM performance among patients with schizophrenia is not 
surprising, given the heterogeneous nature of schizophrenia, the use of various 
ToM tasks, and the absence of a standardized ToM test (for extensive reviews, 
see Bora et al., 2009; Br ü ne, 2005; Harrington et al., 2005a). It should be noted

that such variation can also be attributed to the theoretical approaches to which 
researchers subscribe. Th ese can be classifi ed into two main approaches. Th e fi rst 
approach, which follows Frith’s model (Frith, 1992) or a variation thereof (Sarfati, 
Harde-Bayle, Besche, & Widlocher, 1997), has attempted to assign ToM impair-
ments in patients with schizophrenia to a specifi c symptom profi le. According to 
this model, severity of ToM impairments in patients with schizophrenia is asso-
ciated with specifi c groups of symptoms and predicts intact abilities in remitted 
patients (i.e., ToM impairment is a state). More specifi cally, ToM abilities are asso-
ciated with one of the following four symptom subgroups, with decreasing level of 
severity: (1) behavioral signs of negative symptoms or incoherence; (2) paranoid 
symptoms, which include delusions of persecution and of reference, as well as 
third-person hallucinations; (3) passivity experiences, which include delusions of 
control, thought insertion, and thought broadcasting; and (4) symptoms in remis-
sion. Although there is some support for this model (e.g., Corcoran & Frith, 2003; 
Pickup & Frith, 2001; Stewart, Corcoran, & Drake, 2008), the exact relationship 
between mentalizing problems and symptoms remains unclear (Bora et al., 2009; 
Frith, 2004). Indeed, a major challenge to this model is the hierarchical approach 
to this grouping where, for example, the group of patients with behavioral signs 
can also have paranoid symptoms and passivity experiences. Conversely, those 
belonging to the paranoid group are free from any behavioral signs, but may 
report passivity experiences. It has been suggested that such overlap of symptom 
clusters across groups makes it diffi  cult to identify which symptom or cluster of 
symptoms is associated with the type of impairment observed (Harrington et al., 
2005a). Another potential confound is the use of inconsistent criteria for catego-
rizing positive and negative symptoms (Harrington et al., 2005a), as well as for 
categorizing remitted and nonremitted patients (Pousa et al., 2008a). 
 Th e second approach suggests that severity of ToM impairment in schizophre-
nia is associated with abnormal ToM development, and hence is likely to be a 
trait (Herold, T é nyi, L é n á rd, & Trixler, 2002; Hollis & Taylor, 1997). Th is devel-
opmental approach predicts that ToM impairment, if present, exists before the 
onset of schizophrenia and persists over time. Th at ToM impairment in schizo-
phrenia is trait-dependent is supported by fi ndings of recent studies of individuals 
at high risk for and with schizophrenia. Th ese studies have reported mentaliz-
ing problems in remitted patients (Bora, Gokcen, Kayahan, & Beznedarouglu, 
2008; Herold et al., 2002; Inoue et al., 2006; Randall, Corcoran, Day, & Bentall, 
2003), nonclinical high schizotypal subjects (Langdon & Coltheart, 2004), 
healthy delusion-prone participants (Fyfe, Williams, Mason, & Pickup, 2008), 
and nonpsychotic fi rst-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia (Irani et al., 
2006; Janssen, Krabbendam, Jolles, & van Os, 2003; Mazza, Di Michele, Pollice, 
Casacchia, & Roncone, 2008). Th is evidence has been further corroborated in two 
recent meta-analyses of ToM performance in schizophrenia (Bora et al., 2009; 
Sprong et al., 2007). However, this conclusion should remain tentative as some 
studies did not fi nd an association between enhanced risk of schizophrenia and 
ToM defi cits (Couture, Penn, Addington, Woods, & Perkins, 2008; Kelemen, Keri, 
Must, Benedek, & Janka, 2004; Marjoram et al., 2006), and others have shown

amelioration of ToM impairments in patients with schizophrenia aft er medica-
tion treatment (Mizrahi, Korostil, Strakstein, Zipursky, & Kapur, 2007; Savina & 
Beninger, 2007). Moreover, several methodological concerns suggest that much 
more work is needed to ascertain whether ToM impairment in schizophrenia rep-
resents a possible trait marker (for details, see Pousa, Ruiz, & David, 2008b). 
 Although these models are theoretically divergent, both have largely attempted 
to characterize ToM in schizophrenia based on the use of categorical mentalizing 
tasks that indicate the presence or absence of mentalizing abilities. Th ese categori-
cal tasks, such as the false-belief and deception tasks (e.g., Frith & Corcoran, 1996), 
intention-inferencing tasks (e.g., Sarfati, Hardy-Bayle, Brunet, & Widlocher, 1999), 
indirect speech tasks (e.g., Corcoran et al., 1995; Greig, Bryson, & Bell, 2004), 
and the “Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test” (e.g., Kelemen et al., 2005; Kettle, 
O’Brien-Simpson, & Allen, 2008) are limited in that they do not off er insight as to 
the nature or characteristics of this impairment other than whether patients have 
a functioning capacity of ToM. By using such gross pass/fail indicators of mental-
izing abilities, we risk undermining the specifi c nature and complexity of ToM 
impairment in schizophrenia. 
 In this chapter, we propose that a fuller characterization of mentalizing abilities 
would require at least three levels of analyses, which include the individual’s abil-
ity to  represent ,  attribute , and  apply  mental states. Th e  representational aspect per-
tains to the individual’s ability to represent mental states. Th at is, do patients with 
schizophrenia suff er from a conceptual defi cit in which they are unable to repre-
sent mental states at all? Th is would be a case of undermentalizing (Frith, 2004) 
or hypomentalism (Crespi & Badcock, 2008). In this context, it should be noted 
that ToM is not a unitary concept (e.g., Bosco et al., 2009; Lysaker et al., 2010) and 
is comprised of representing both cognitive (i.e., beliefs, intentions, and knowl-
edge) and aff ective (i.e., emotions, desires) mental states, which are mediated by 
discrete neurocognitive processes and structures (Abu-Akel & Shamay-Tsoory, 
2011; Kalbe et al., 2010; Shamay-Tsoory & Aharon-Peretz, 2007). Representing 
cognitive and aff ective mental states can be generated via simulation processes of 
mirroring and self-projection (Waytz & Mitchell, 2011) or by theorizing about the 
content of the mind through the use of axioms and rules of inference (Gopnik & 
Wellman, 1992). It is possible, however, that situations that involve aff ective ToM 
entail more self-refl ection or simulation when compared with situations involving 
cognitive ToM (Shamay-Tsoory, 2011). 
 Th e second level of analysis pertains to the  attributional  or  agentive aspect of 
mentalizing, which refers to the individual’s ability to attribute mental state to 
self or other. Th at is, are patients with schizophrenia equally capable of gaining 
insight into their own mental states, as well as to those of others? Although the 
ability to represent self and other mental states and their relationship is far from 
straightforward (for a recent review, see Carruthers, 2009), it can be characterized 
by the presence of one metarepresentational mechanism that utilizes two types of 
information for the assignment of agency:  perception-based information for the 
representation of  other mental states, and  introspective-based information for the 
representation of  self mental states (Happ é , 2003; Zinck, Lodahl, & Frith, 2009).

However, both perception- and introspective-based information can be utilized 
while representing  self or  other  mental states (van der Meer, Costafreda, Aleman, 
& David, 2010). For example, when interacting with an individual, representing 
her mental states may mainly rely on external cues gleaned from the environ-
ment, such as direction of eye gaze, facial expressions, and tone of voice, but it 
can also be computed, although not necessarily so, in consultation with internally 
stored information, such as autobiographical memory. Once generated, whether 
through simulation or theorizing, these mental states are then assigned agency 
(i.e., attributed to self or to another). It should be noted that we use the term 
 attribution not to refer to the patient’s  attributional style , which emphasizes the 
patient’s attributional bias of the causes of particular positive and negative events 
to self, other, or the situation (Green et al., 2008). Rather, it is used here to refer 
to the patient’s ability to  attribute or  assign  mental states to self (“these are my 
feelings and beliefs”) or other (“these are her feelings and beliefs”). Last is the 
 execution/application  aspect of mentalizing, which refers to the  manner in which 
the individual applies mental states. In this context, diffi  culties with ToM may not 
be related to an absence of the ability to represent mental states, but rather to an 
abnormality in applying (or deploying) these mental states (Abu-Akel & Bailey, 
2000; Frith, 2004). 
 By reframing ToM abilities in terms of representation, attribution, and applica-
tion of cognitive and aff ective mental states (see Figure 8.1), ToM impairments 
can be characterized along a continuum of competence and performance, and, 
as such, identify the various ways in which schizophrenia can aff ect processing of 
mental states. In the following section, we review evidence to demonstrate how 
variably schizophrenia impinges on one’s ability to represent, attribute, and apply 
aff ective and cognitive mental states to self and other. 
 REPRESENTATION OF MENTAL STATES 
 In this section, we address whether patients with schizophrenia have a genu-
ine defi cit in ToM (i.e., complete conceptual loss). False-belief understanding is 
considered a litmus indicator for the presence of ToM. A traditional measure of 
false-belief understanding involves the unexpected transfer of an object from one

location to another (Wimmer & Perner, 1983), in which a patient is asked to pre-
dict where a person will say his object is, given that he fi rst put it in one location, 
and then, in his absence, the object was moved to another location by another 
person. Patients answering accurately—that the person will look in the original 
location—have been credited with having ToM, and those who are not able to 
perform correctly are thought not to be cognizant that others have mental states. 
Th ese tests, and variations thereof, are known as  fi rst-order ToM tasks and have 
been viewed by researchers as testing the presence or absence of the same under-
lying cognitive construct (however, see Harrington et al., 2005b; Tager-Flusberg & 
Sullivan, 2000). Th is construct includes an understanding that beliefs (and other 
mental states) must be represented in the mind, that beliefs may diff er among 
individuals who have access to diff erent knowledge, and thus that some people’s 
beliefs may be falsely represented if they are based on erroneous information 
(Abu-Akel & Bailey, 2001). 
 If passing fi rst-order ToM demonstrates whether an individual has basic 
representational abilities of mental states, and if patients with schizophrenia 
have a genuine representational defi cit (such as that observed in patients with 
autism), then we would expect patients with schizophrenia to perform poorly 
on fi rst- order ToM tasks. In the fi rst study addressing ToM in schizophrenia, 
Corcoran et al. (1995) presented patients with short passages designed to test 
one’s understanding of indirect intentional speech. In this task, which requires 
functional fi rst-order representational abilities, participants are required to con-
vey the real intended meaning of statements that include an obvious hint. On this 
test, patients with negative features and incoherence scored the worst compared 
to normal and psychiatric controls and schizophrenic patients with paranoid and 
passivity symptoms. Th is fi nding was further replicated in subsequent studies that 
employed more classic fi rst-order ToM tasks, such as the one described above. In 
a study by Frith and Corcoran (1996), for example, fi rst-order ToM stories were 
read aloud while showing a series of cartoon drawings presenting the sequence of 
actions depicted in the stories. Th e patients with behavioral signs (which include 
patients with negative features and/or incoherence) performed worst compared 
to the other schizophrenic subgroups (paranoid, passivity, and remission groups) 
and normal controls. In a later study, Mazza et al. (2001) categorized patients, fol-
lowing Liddle’s (1987) three-dimensional-symptom model, into a psychomotor 
poverty group, a disorganization group, and a reality distortion group. Patients 
with psychomotor poverty, which to some extent corresponds to Frith’s behav-
ioral signs subgroup, performed more poorly on the fi rst-order ToM task than did 
the patients in the disorganization group and the reality distortion group. Similar 
results were also reported in more recent studies in which patients with more 
severe symptomatology, as assessed with instruments such as the Positive and 
Negative Syndrome Scale, exhibited grave diffi  culties in representing fi rst-order 
mental states, similar to those diffi  culties observed among individuals with autism 
(e.g., Marjoram et al., 2005; Stratta et al., 2010). 
 However, given that the results in these studies (Corcoran et al., 1995; Frith 
& Corcoran, 1996; Marjoram et al., 2005; Mazza et al., 2001; Stratta et al., 2010)

were presented as relative aggregates (i.e., reported a proportion of their sub-
jects as showing no impairment in such understanding) and that the tasks used 
are not designed along a continuum of competence and performance, it is dif-
fi cult to determine from these fi ndings whether patients with negative-symptom 
schizophrenia truly exhibit a conceptual defi cit of ToM. Moreover, none of these 
studies included patients with autism as controls. In fact, a series of other stud-
ies seriously question whether patients with schizophrenia, including those with 
negative symptomatology, can be accurately described as having a conceptual 
ToM defi cit. Pilowsky and colleagues (2000) have shown that although children 
with schizophrenia performed more poorly on fi rst-order ToM tasks than typi-
cally developing children, they overall had attenuated mentalizing impairments 
compared to children with high-functioning autism. It should be noted, however, 
that patients with schizophrenia, particularly those with negative symptomatol-
ogy, performed similar to high-functioning autistics when tested on an advanced 
ToM task, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (Couture et al., 2010). Moreover, 
confi rming earlier reports (Doody, G ö tz, Johnstone, Frith, & Cunningham, 
1998; Mitchley, Barber, Gray, Brooks, & Livingston, 1998), Pickup & Frith (2001) 
reported that patients with schizophrenia, including those with behavioral signs, 
scored perfectly on a fi rst-order ToM task, but had discernible diffi  culties with 
a second-order ToM task in which the subject must judge whether a person has 
a false belief about the belief of another person. Accordingly, the authors con-
clude that the mentalizing diffi  culties observed in patients with schizophrenia are 
less severe than those observed in autism. Th ese results, in which patients with 
schizophrenia are able to pass basic mentalizing abilities and fail at more com-
plex ones, have consistently been replicated in later studies by various research 
groups (Abu-Akel & Abushua’leh, 2004; Bosco et al., 2009; Br ü ne, 2003; Herold 
et al., 2002; Inoue et al., 2006; Janssen et al., 2003). In fact, when using a nondi-
chotomous task, Br ü ne and Schaub (2011) have recently demonstrated that a sub-
stantial number of patients with schizophrenia perform within the normal range. 
Th e authors suggest that this does not mean that the patients are performing like 
controls, but that their mentalizing abilities are not completely absent. 
 Weighing in on the debate concerning the extent to which ToM is impaired in 
schizophrenia, Langdon et al. (2006) investigated both false-belief understanding 
and emotion attribution. In the latter, subjects were required to think about how 
another person is likely to be feeling. Th ey found that impairment in the ability to 
attribute emotions (happiness, sadness, shock, and anger) co-occurred with dif-
fi culties in inferring false beliefs, and suggested that patients with schizophrenia 
have a domain-general diffi  culty with empathetic perspective taking. However, in 
more recent studies, Shamay-Tsoory and colleagues (Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2007; 
Shur, Shamay-Tsoory, & Levkovitz, 2008) have argued that the confl icting evi-
dence concerning ToM abilities in schizophrenic patients may be a consequence 
of the use of various ToM tasks, which variably tap cognitive and aff ective compo-
nents of ToM. Specifi cally, they proposed that the behavioral defi cit of individuals 
with schizophrenia may be due to an impaired aff ective ToM (i.e., the ability to 
know, understand, and predict other people’s  emotions ) rather than to a general 

202 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
impairment in ToM. In testing this hypothesis, Shamay-Tsoory and her col-
leagues (2007) administered fi rst- and second-order cognitive and aff ective ToM 
tasks to patients with schizophrenia. Although the patients did not diff er from 
healthy controls on the fi rst-order conditions (both cognitive and aff ective), they 
were markedly impaired on the second-order aff ective ToM condition, but not the 
second-order cognitive ToM condition. Complementing these results, Shur et al. 
(2008) have demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia are also impaired on 
tasks (e.g., the  faux pas task) that require the integration of emotional and cogni-
tive mental states (Shur et al., 2008). In this context, it should be noted that the 
ability to represent emotional mental states is an important component of  empa-
thy , which is the ability to accurately perceive and understand the other’s emo-
tional state, and to respond to it appropriately (Leiberg & Anders, 2006). Indeed, a 
number of studies have shown that patients with schizophrenia suff er from a pro-
nounced impairment in empathic abilities (Bora et al., 2008; Derntl et al., 2009; 
Haker & Rossler, 2009; Montag, Heinz, Kunz, & Gallinat, 2007). Patients with 
schizophrenia have also been shown to be impaired in imitating emotional facial 
expressions (Haker & Rossler, 2009), as well as in the recognition of facial expres-
sions (Derntl et al., 2009; Hofer et al., 2009; Kosmidis et al., 2007; Pinkham, Gur, 
& Gur, 2007), which could underlie their inability to successfully process aff ective 
mental states and, consequently, their ability to empathize. 
 Given the evidence showing that fi rst-order ToM processing is largely spared 
in schizophrenia, and that schizophrenia seems to specifi cally impact the pro-
cessing of aff ective mental states (but not cognitive mental states), a conceptual 
defi cit account would not accurately describe the mentalizing diffi  culties pres-
ent in patients with schizophrenia. Th is suggests that the mentalizing diffi  culties 
observed in schizophrenia are not due to an absence of representational abilities 
of mental states or a general impairment in ToM abilities. 
 ATTRIBUTION OF MENTAL STATES 
 If, as suggested above, patients with schizophrenia do not suff er a defi cit in 
conceptual/representational abilities (i.e., they are able to represent mental 
states), the second level of analysis would be to explore the extent to which 
these patients are able to  attribute or  assign mental states to  self and  other . 
In his original argument, Frith (1992) suggested that schizophrenia can be 
understood in terms of one’s ability to represent self and other mental states 
in such a way that diffi  culties in representing self and other mental states may 
result in disorders of “willed action” (e.g., negative and disorganized symp-
toms), disorders of self-monitoring (e.g., “passivity” phenomena), or disorders 
of monitoring other people’s thoughts and intentions (e.g., delusions of perse-
cution and ideas of reference). Despite the recognition that studying the abil-
ity to attribute self mental states is important to understanding schizophrenia, 
and more generally the recognition that distinguishing between self and other 
mental states is fundamental to successful social interaction and understanding

interpersonal awareness, the overwhelming majority of studies have focused 
on patients’ ability to represent and attribute mental states to  others . As a result, 
the relationship between the ability to represent self and other mental states 
in schizophrenia has received very little attention, and this is clearly refl ected 
by the almost exclusive use of ToM tasks that test for one’s ability to attribute 
mental states to others. 
 Available evidence provides some important insights, nonetheless. Langdon 
et al. (1997) examined patients’ ability to attribute mental state to self and oth-
ers, using a recall task that required subjects to dissociate subjective mental 
states from objective realities to test for self mental state attribution, and picture 
sequencing and story-telling tasks to test for other mental state attribution. Th e 
results show that although some patients had diffi  culties in attributing mental 
states to self and other, some demonstrated a dissociation in which they were 
able to correctly attribute mental states to others (i.e., succeeded on the picture 
sequencing task) but failed in attributing mental states to self (i.e., failed on the 
recall of own mental state task). Findings for this latter group resonate with 
several studies that have consistently shown that patients with passivity expe-
riences (alien control or thought) have intact attributional abilities of other 
mental states (e.g., Br ü ne et al., 2008; Corcoran et al., 1995; Corcoran & Frith, 
2003; Frith & Corcoran, 1996; Pickup & Frith, 2001, Russell, Reynaud, Herba, 
Morris, & Corcoran, 2006), despite being impaired in their ability to attribute 
mental states to self, such as their intention to act (Daprati et al., 1997; Mlakar, 
Jensterle, & Frith, 1994), misattributing internally generated acts to others 
(Jeannerod, 1994), and have abnormal activation in brain areas involved in 
the evaluation of self-reference during mental state attribution (Br ü ne et al., 
2008). 
 Moreover, poor ToM abilities in schizophrenia have been shown to be related to 
reduced insight (Bora, Sehitoglu, Aslier, Atabay, & Veznedaroglu, 2007; Gambini, 
Barbieri, & Scarone, 2004; Langdon & Ward, 2009; Pousa, Ruiz, & David, 2008b), 
and poor insight was found to be signifi cantly associated with defi cits in meta-
cognitive abilities, rather than cognitive defi cits per se (Koren et al., 2004). For 
example, in the study by Gambini et al. (2004), patients were interviewed about 
their delusions, followed with questions about the content of these delusions in 
the fi rst-person (e.g., “Do you really think that what you just told me is real?”). 
Based on the patients’ answers to these sets of questions, the authors concluded 
that patients with schizophrenia lacked insight into their delusions. However, 
when the questions were framed in the third-person (e.g., “If someone else told 
you what you just told me, would you believe him or her?”), some patients were 
able to modify their own mental states. Th at is, when patients were asked to intro-
spect about their mental states, these mental states were impervious to revision. 
But when asked to consider these mental states from the perspective of another 
person, they were able to reason about the appropriateness of these mental states. 
Although it can be argued that these patients are able to reason about their own 
mental states by means of turning mindreading abilities upon themselves, one 
cannot rule out that these patients are using some compensatory mechanism to 

204 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
make sense of their behavior (Stanghellini & Ballerini, 2011). However, contrary 
to these studies, two recent studies suggest that attributing mental states to self 
is better preserved in schizophrenia than is attributing mental states to others 
(Bosco et al., 2009) and that disruption of other-perspective taking, rather than 
self-perspective inhibition, appears to more likely account for ToM impairment 
in schizophrenia (Bailey & Henry, 2010). Moreover, Schimansky et al. (2010) 
reported that abnormalities in the sense of agency among remitted or partially 
remitted patients with schizophrenia were unrelated to the mentalizing diffi  -
culties they exhibited when performing the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test. 
Collectively, these fi ndings suggest that self and other mental state attribution can 
be dissociated in schizophrenia, and that the ability to attribute mental states to 
others can be impaired irrespective of whether attributing mental states to the self 
is intact. It is interesting to note that such dissociation in self and other attribu-
tion has recently been reported for individuals with autism as well (Williams & 
Happ é , 2009). 
 To our knowledge, there are no studies that have explicitly addressed the 
ability of patients with schizophrenia to attribute self and other mental states 
along the cognitive and aff ective dimensions. Th e limited evidence pertaining 
to the dissociability between self and other mental states in schizophrenia is 
inconsistent, and so it is diffi  cult to speculate on the extent to which schizophre-
nia might impact agentive attribution of cognitive and aff ective mental states. 
However, we can speculate that patients with passivity phenomena will have 
diffi  culties in attributing both cognitive and aff ective mental states to self, but 
not to other. If we accept the model (as presented above) positing the presence 
of one metarepresentational mechanism that utilizes  perception-based infor-
mation for the representation of  other mental states, and  introspective-based 
information for the representation of  self mental states, then we can conjec-
ture that the inability of these patients to assign mental states to self is due 
to a disruption in their ability to access introspective-based information, or, 
as pointed to by Bedford and David (2008), due to ineffi  cient processing of 
self-related material. 
 In all, other than the fi ndings for the patients with passivity phenomena, the 
extent to which self and other mental state attribution is impaired in other types 
of schizophrenia warrants further research. Importantly, this research would 
need to introduce newly designed tests that place equal demands and appropri-
ate similar contexts for the attribution of self and other mental states (for a prom-
ising start, see Williams & Happ é , 2009). Such research is particularly important 
since it can inform the debate on two major theoretical issues concerning the 
relationship between self and other mental state attribution during mentalizing: 
(1) the dissociability between representing self and other cognitive and aff ec-
tive mental states, and its corollary, (2) the inferencing mechanism used during 
mindreading, such as simulation, which posits that attribution of mental states to 
self is a prerequisite step to gain insight into others’ mental states. However, these 
important issues are beyond the scope of this chapter and will not be discussed 
further.

 APPLICATION/EXECUTION OF MENTAL STATES 
 When patients with schizophrenia fail ToM tasks, the errors that the patients 
make are generally treated as evidence for the absence of a functioning capacity 
to represent mental states. Th is conclusion, as mentioned above, has been largely 
driven by study design in which patients are presented with a categorical task 
that can only refl ect the absence or presence of mentalizing abilities. Abu-Akel 
and Bailey (2000) have argued that not all patients with schizophrenia can be 
correctly described as lacking an understanding of mental states, but rather they 
lack the ability to apply such mental states. Such abnormalities of application can 
manifest in two forms. On the one hand, an individual may be aware of others’ 
mental life but fail to demonstrate this knowledge due to processing constraints. 
Th is we refer to as an  application defi cit , as opposed to a  representational defi cit . 
On the other hand, an individual may be able to apply mental states, albeit atypi-
cally. It has been suggested that this phenomenon, which has been described in 
the literature as  hyper-theory-of-mind (Abu-Akel & Bailey, 2000),  overmentalizing 
(Frith, 2004), or  hypermentalism  (Crespi & Badcock, 2008), could result from the 
unconstrained generation of hypotheses that can impact either the content of the 
mental states or the number of mental states generated. Such atypical application 
of mental states to one’s self and to other people may result from either generating 
a fantastical hypothesis about the content of the mind, such as having powers of 
omniscience, or from diffi  culties in deciding among several competing hypoth-
eses about the mind, which could result in an increase in the likelihood of choos-
ing an erroneous hypothesis about the content of the mind. 
 To our knowledge, the fi rst clue to such application defi cits was presented 
by Bowler (1992), who demonstrated that although both patients with chronic 
schizophrenia and Asperger syndrome possessed knowledge about other people’s 
minds, as measured by their success on second-order ToM tasks, they were defi -
cient in applying this knowledge during interactions with others in everyday con-
texts. He concluded that “the combination of social impairment with an intact 
second-order theory of mind suggests that it is a failure of application rather than 
an absence of knowledge” (Bowler, 1992, p. 891). Although some patients with 
schizophrenia suff er from application defi cits, other patients with disorganized, 
paranoid, and delusional schizophrenia are able to apply ToM, albeit atypically. 
By defi nition, ToM abilities must be available for such symptoms of delusion and 
paranoia to transpire. For example, schizophrenic patients with delusions of alien 
control who misattribute their own intentions to others (Daprati, et al., 1997) 
clearly represent others’ minds and are capable of applying ToM, but err due to an 
overattribution of particular mental states to others, rather than to an inability to 
mentalize or apply their mentation. In a later study, Walston et al. (2000) reported 
that patients with “pure” persecutory delusions performed normally on ToM 
tasks, scoring perfectly or at a high level, and showed no evidence of any general 
impairment of the ability to make inferences concerning others’ mental states. 
However, the content of these delusions suggests that these patients oft en attrib-
uted fantastical hypotheses about the content of the mind. A similar conclusion 

206 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
was presented by McCabe and collaborators (2004) when analyzing the conversa-
tions between mental health professionals and people with chronic schizophrenia. 
Using conversation analysis techniques, the authors showed that these patients 
appropriately reported fi rst- and second-order mental states. However, their erro-
neous beliefs persisted despite recognizing that their interlocutor did not share 
their belief or accept their justifi cations of these beliefs as convincing. It is clear 
from these conversation analyses that the problems facing these patients are not 
due to defi cit, but to management or application of their mental states. 
 It has been suggested that the purest evidence for overmentalizing would be 
to show that paranoid patients ascribe intentions to behavior that the rest of us 
see as mechanical or random (Blakemore, Sarfati, Bazin, & Decety, 2003; Frith, 
2004). Indeed, such evidence has been observed in both healthy adults exhibiting 
delusion proneness (Fyfe et al., 2008) and in patients with paranoid schizophre-
nia (Montag et al., 2011; Russell et al., 2006; Walter et al., 2009). In the study by 
Fyfe and collaborators (2008), individuals were required to rate the strength of 
relationship between the movements of two shapes (the contingency task) and, 
in another, to view and then describe the movement of triangles on a computer 
screen in “random,” “physical,” and “ToM” conditions (the triangles task). In both 
tasks, delusion-prone individuals not only perceived meaning when the move-
ments were random, but also tended to attribute mental states where none was 
indicated. Th e authors suggest that overmentalizing could refl ect a hyperassocia-
tive cognitive style in which there is an exaggerated tendency to attribute mental 
states. Th e attribution of mental states to physical evidence has also been observed 
by Walter and collaborators (2009). In this neuroimaging study, patients with par-
anoid schizophrenia were scanned while performing one of four tasks: a physical 
causation condition and three intention attribution conditions. Th e patients per-
formed worse than the normal controls in all conditions. Interestingly, no signal 
drop in putative ToM brain regions was observed for the physical causality condi-
tion, compared to the controls. Th is was attributed to the patients’ tendency to 
attribute intentionality to physical objects, suggesting that patients with positive 
symptoms might have a hyperactive intention detector for physical events. 
 Most recently, Montag et al. (2011) assessed the mentalizing styles of a group 
of 80 patients with paranoid schizophrenia using the Movie for the Assessment 
of Social Cognition (MASC; (Dziobek et al., 2006), which is designed to capture 
whether aberrant mentalizing is due to undermentalizing (either lack of ToM 
or reduced ToM) or overmentalizing, and whether it is specifi c to cognitive or 
aff ective mental states. Th e authors report that although negative symptoms were 
associated with undermentalizing, positive symptoms, like delusions, were associ-
ated with overmentalizing. Interestingly, although Montag et al. (2011) found that 
undermentalizing was correlated with both cognitive and aff ective mental state 
decoding, they detected a stronger interaction between positive symptoms and a 
dysfunction of cognitive mentalizing than emotional mentalizing. Th ese results 
largely replicate those obtained by Shamay-Tsoory and collaborators (2007), who 
found that aff ective ToM and empathy correlated with measurements of nega-
tive symptoms, whereas cognitive ToM correlated with the severity of positive

symptoms. A partial confi rmation of these fi ndings can also be inferred from the 
study of Mehl et al. (2010), who found that schizophrenics’ ability to infer inten-
tions of others (i.e., cognitive ToM) was more strongly associated with general 
delusions and positive symptoms, whereas ToM abilities to infer emotions and to 
understand second-order false beliefs were not associated with delusions or posi-
tive symptoms. Collectively, these fi ndings indicate that overmentalizing might 
apply to the cognitive dimension of ToM only, and that undermentalizing may 
specifi cally impact aff ective ToM (Montag et al., 2011; Shamy-Tsoory et al., 2007). 
However, this conclusion should remain tentative, given that patients with para-
noid schizophrenia can exhibit hyperaff ective mental states, such as morbid jeal-
ousy (Charlton & McClelland, 1999) and delusions of being loved or erotomania 
(Badcock, 2004). 
 Current evidence thus strongly suggests that not all schizophrenic patients 
can appropriately be characterized as oblivious of their own or others’ minds. In 
fact, most patients with schizophrenia appear cognizant of mental life, but diff er 
in their abilities to apply such knowledge. To varying degrees, the mentalizing 
capacity of some patients may manifest as undermentalizing due to an applica-
tion defi cit or processing constraints, and in others as overmentalizing, which can 
result either from a tendency to overattribute mental states or the unconstrained 
generation of mental-state hypotheses due to lack of inhibition (Abu-Akel, 2003). 
It has been suggested that such variation in under- and overmentalizing could be 
context dependent (Langdon & Brock, 2008), as there is evidence showing that 
the same patients can exhibit both under- and overmentalizing while performing 
precisely the same task (Langdon, 2005; Montag et al., 2011; Russell et al., 2006). 
Interestingly, in both studies by Langdon (2005), using the visual appreciation 
joke task, and by Russell et al. (2006), using the animated shapes task, undermen-
talizing was observed in the ToM condition, and overmentalizing was observed in 
the nonmentalistic condition, as if patients undermentalize when they are, in fact, 
expected to mentalize and overmentalize when they are not. Collectively, these 
observations raise the possibility that ToM application abilities could be highly 
variable within and among individuals, and are likely to be situated along a con-
tinuum of extremes of absence and excess. Th erefore, it is important for future 
research to utilize suitable contexts in which intra- and interindividual diff erences 
in the application of ToM abilities can be examined. 
 CONCLUSION 
 Mentalizing impairments have been consistently identifi ed in schizophrenia. 
However, inconsistency as to the nature and extent of these impairments abound. 
Our review of the literature suggests that patients with schizophrenia are largely 
capable of at least representing basic cognitive mental states. However, their men-
talizing abilities appear to break down when performing advanced mentalizing 
tasks, particularly those requiring patients to infer aff ective mental states or the 
integration of cognitive and aff ective mental states (Shur et al., 2008). Except for

patients with passivity phenomena, in which attribution of mental states to others 
appears intact in the face of impaired sense of self, the extent to which schizo-
phrenia impacts one’s mental-state sense of agency is unclear. Research in this 
domain is sorely needed to clarify the extent to which schizophrenia impacts one’s 
mental-state sense of agency, especially along the cognitive and aff ective dimen-
sions of ToM. More broadly, such research would provide important information 
regarding the putative relationship between self and other in processing mental 
states. Last, evidence suggests that the performance of patients with schizophre-
nia on ToM tasks vacillates along a continuum of undermentalizing, on one end, 
and overmentalizing, on the other. Th ere is some evidence suggesting that under-
mentalizing is associated with negative symptoms and overmentalizing with posi-
tive symptoms. However, we should review this distinction with caution as there 
is also evidence showing that context-dependent variation could induce varying 
forms of mentalizing abilities within the same patient. Th is underscores the view 
that a defi cit account is not appropriate to describe the mentalizing abilities of 
patients with schizophrenia, and, equally importantly, calls for future research to 
place special emphasis on the role of individual variation. 
 Accurate characterization of these impairments is paramount, particularly 
when it is becoming increasingly clear that mentalizing is a useful measure for 
understanding schizophrenia and psychopathology in general. In our view, 
separating component processes of ToM in schizophrenia is crucial to gain bet-
ter insight into the nature and extent of this impairment. Here, we identifi ed 
three main component processes that should be considered when character-
izing ToM impairments in schizophrenia: (1) representation of cognitive and 
aff ective mental states, (2) attribution of agency to cognitive and aff ective men-
tal states, and (3) the application/execution of cognitive and aff ective mental 
states. Such conceptualization allows us to characterize patients’ interindividual 
as well as intraindividual performance along a continuum of competence and 
performance, and to minimize the mischaracterization of patients’ ToM abili-
ties that is oft en brought to bear when employing a categorical approach of pres-
ence and absence.

 Social Cognition and the 
Dynamics of Paranoid Ideation  
 R I C H A R D  P.   B E N T A L L   A N D   A L I S A   U D A C H I N A  ■ 
 Abnormal beliefs are a common feature of severe mental illness and are oft en 
reported by patients diagnosed as suff ering from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, 
or major depression. However, until about two decades ago, they were rarely the 
focus of psychological research (Oltmanns & Maher, 1988). Since that time, how-
ever, there has been a burgeoning research literature on the topic, so that summa-
rizing and integrating the fi ndings is no easy task. 
 DEFINITIONAL ISSUES 
 When they are held with great conviction, are apparently incomprehensible to 
others, and are resistant to counterargument, these kinds of beliefs are usually 
termed “delusions.” Th e  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
(DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) defi nes a delusion as:
 A false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that is fi rmly 
sustained despite what almost everyone else believes and despite what con-
stitutes incontrovertible and obvious proof or evidence to the contrary. Th e 
belief is not one ordinarily accepted by other members of the person’s culture 
or subculture (e.g. it is not an article of religious faith). 
 Th is defi nition, along with others that have been proposed, is not entirely sat-
isfactory. What counts as “incontrovertible and obvious proof or evidence to the 
contrary” for example? However, despite the tendency in psychiatry to see delu-
sions as qualitatively diff erent from other kinds of beliefs and attitudes (so that 
they are, “empty speech acts, whose informational content refers to neither world 
or self”; Berrios, 1991), this diffi  culty becomes less serious if it is assumed that 
they exist on a continuum with other less bizarre but nonetheless tenaciously 
held beliefs, such as eccentric political attitudes or beliefs about the supernatural. 

216 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
As we will see, there is, with some important qualifi cations, empirical evidence to 
support this assumption. 
 Th e term “paranoia,” now commonly used to specifi cally indicate a tendency to 
hold abnormal beliefs about unwarranted persecution by others, has undergone 
a series of subtle changes in meaning over the last 100 years or so. In modern 
psychiatry, the term was fi rst introduced in 1863, by Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum, to 
refer to a type of persistent delusional illness characterized primarily by cognitive 
defi cits (Munro, 1982). Kraepelin (1907) later argued that the term should be con-
fi ned to an uncommon, insidious, chronic illness characterized by a fi xed delu-
sional system in the absence of hallucinations or a deterioration of personality. 
A variety of delusional beliefs came under this category, including persecutory, 
grandiose, and jealous delusions (Kraepelin, 1907; Manschreck, 1989). 
 Th e publication of DSM-III (American Psychiatric Association, 1980) marked 
a shift  toward a more modern, restricted conception of paranoia. In DSM-IV-TR 
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000), a persecutory delusion is defi ned as the 
belief that the person is being tormented, followed, tricked, spied upon, maliciously 
maligned, harassed, or ridiculed. Th e manual also defi nes Paranoid Personality 
Disorder in terms of a persisting pattern of distrust and suspiciousness toward 
others, so that others’ motives are usually interpreted as malevolent. Consistent 
with this last concept, in popular and literary usage, the term “paranoid” has come 
to mean irrationally suspicious or distrustful (Manschreck & Khan, 2006). 
 Paranoid or persecutory delusions are perhaps the most common kind of 
abnormal belief seen in patients suff ering from psychosis. In a study of 160 acute 
psychiatric inpatients in Sydney, Australia, 80% of deluded patients reported per-
secutory beliefs (Brakoulias & Starcevic, 2008). High rates of persecutory beliefs 
have also been reported in fi rst-episode psychotic patients in Denmark (Jorgensen 
& Jensen, 1994) and also the United Kingdom, where a recent analysis of data 
from 255 consecutively admitted schizophrenia spectrum patients reported that 
as many as 90% showed signifi cant levels of paranoid ideation, according to their 
scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Schedule (Moutoussis, Williams, 
Dayan, & Bentall, 2007). Paranoia is also observed in patients with other diagno-
ses, such as major depression (Frangos, Athanassenas, Tsitourides, Psilolignos, 
& Katsanou, 1983; Lattuada, Serretti, Cusin, Gasperini, & Smeraldi, 1999), bipo-
lar disorder (Goodwin & Jamison., 1990), posttraumatic stress disorder (David, 
Kutcher, Jackson, & Mellman, 1999; Kozari ć -Kova č i ć & Borove č ki, 2005), and 
neurological disorders, such as dementia (Rubin & Drevets, 1988). 
 Th ese observations of a high prevalence of paranoid beliefs among psychiatric 
patients seem to be cross-culturally robust. Ndetei and Vadher (1984) compared 
the abnormal beliefs of psychiatric inpatients from Europe, the Caribbean, India, 
Africa, the Middle East, and the Far East, and found persecutory delusions to be 
the most common except in Far East, where sexual delusions were more com-
mon. In the World Health Organization study of the Determinants of Outcome of 
Severe Mental Disorders, involving hundreds of fi rst-contact psychotic patients in 
10 diff erent countries, almost half of the patients presented with persecutory delu-
sions (Jablensky et al., 1992). Of course, the exact content of paranoid delusions

tends to vary with time and place. For example, Sendiony (1976) found that mid-
dle- and upper-class Egyptian patients typically report persecutory delusions that 
have scientifi c or secular themes, whereas the delusions of poorer patients oft en 
involve religious institutions. In a study conducted in the Far East, Kim, Li, Jiang, 
and Cui (1993) reported that the paranoid delusions of Korean patients tended to 
refl ect fears of rape, whereas fears of vampires and poisoning were more common 
in Chinese patients. 
 THE PARANOID SPECTRUM 
 Despite their usual attribution to mental illness, epidemiological research sug-
gests that paranoid beliefs can also be observed in nonclinical populations. Th e 
Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study found that the lifetime 
prevalence of broadly defi ned persecutory beliefs, which include nondistressing 
experiences and experiences with plausible origin, was 10%, whereas the lifetime 
prevalence of narrowly defi ned persecutory delusions (i.e., beliefs causing dis-
tress and help-seeking behavior) was about 1% (Rutten, van Os, Dominguez, & 
Krabbendam, 2008). New onset of persecutory delusions over a period of 1 year 
was observed in 0.2% of the sample using the narrow criteria and in 1% when the 
broad defi nition was used. (Within the sample, approximately a third of individu-
als identifi ed as suff ering from a psychotic disorder experienced narrowly defi ned 
persecutory delusions, but this proportion increased to 65% when persecutory 
delusions were defi ned more broadly.) 
 A similar British study assessed several thousands of individuals from the gen-
eral population using the Psychosis Screening Questionnaire; individuals with 
identifi able psychotic disorder were deliberately excluded from the study (Johns 
et al., 2004). Th e results showed that around 9% of individuals felt that, over the 
past year, others were deliberately trying to harm them or their interests, and 1.5% 
believed that in the past year people had been plotting against them to cause harm 
or injury. 
 Longitudinal data on paranoid beliefs in the general population are available 
from a Swiss study, in which a general population cohort was followed for 20 
years and participants were interviewed on six separate occasions between ages 
of 20 and 40 (R ö ssler et al., 2007). Although the endorsement of paranoid beliefs 
varied at diff erent time points, on average, about 5% of respondents felt that, over 
the week preceding their interviews, others were to blame for their troubles, 7% 
believed that most people could not be trusted, and nearly 9% reported feeling 
taken advantage of. All three types of beliefs were associated with at least moder-
ate levels of distress. 
 Th ese kinds of fi ndings have been widely taken as indicating that paranoia 
exists on a continuum with less severe forms of suspiciousness toward and mis-
trust of others. Indeed, a number of psychological investigators have developed 
scales for measuring paranoid thinking within healthy populations, for example 
university students (Fenigstein & Vanable, 1992; Freeman, 2008; Melo, Corcoran, 

218 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
& Bentall, 2009). Freeman et al. (2005) explicitly investigated the possibility of a 
paranoid continuum in a large sample of healthy individuals recruited over the 
internet. Milder beliefs such as “Strangers and friends look at me critically” (on 
a weekly basis, endorsed by 21% of the sample) were more common than less 
plausible forms of paranoid beliefs such as “Th ere is a possibility of a conspiracy 
against me” (on a weekly basis, endorsed only by 1% of the sample). Th e results 
also showed that the more pathological beliefs usually occurred in tandem with 
more common and less implausible forms of suspiciousness. Hence, Freeman and 
his colleagues proposed the existence of a hierarchy of paranoid beliefs, rang-
ing from common social evaluative concerns (e.g., fear of rejection) through less 
common, moderately paranoid beliefs (e.g., the belief that others are trying to 
cause the individual distress) to full-blown paranoid delusions. 
 Qualitative Differences Between Psychotic and Subclinical Paranoia 
 Th e idea of a paranoid spectrum appears compelling, not only because it seems 
consistent with the available epidemiological data, but also because it implies that 
clinical paranoia may be rooted in the kind of concerns about one’s position in 
the social universe that are perhaps a ubiquitous feature of human life. However, 
there is also evidence of qualitative diff erences between the persecutory beliefs 
of psychotic patients and those experienced by ordinary people. For example, in 
a qualitative study in which both clinical and nonclinical individuals with para-
noid beliefs were interviewed, Campbell and Morrison (2007) reported that the 
most striking diff erence between the two groups was that the clinical participants 
felt under the control of their paranoid thoughts whereas nonclinically paranoid 
individuals did not. 
 Collip et al. (2011) used the experience sampling method (in which individuals 
keep diaries of their thoughts and experiences, with frequent entries over periods 
of days cued by electronic devices such as especially programmed digital watches) 
to study the context of paranoid thinking in ordinary people, nonpatients with 
subclinical levels of trait paranoia, and also paranoid and nonparanoid psychi-
atric patients. In people with low to moderate levels of trait paranoia, paranoid 
thoughts typically occurred in stressful circumstances, for example, when in the 
presence of unfamiliar others. However, in individuals with high levels of trait 
paranoia, paranoid thinking, although fl uctuating across time, seemed relatively 
unaff ected by stress and the individual’s social context. 
 As we will consider in more detail later, an important distinction between 
two diff erent kinds of paranoid beliefs, fi rst proposed by Trower and Chadwick 
(1995), may help to illuminate the distinction between clinical and nonclinical 
paranoia. According to Trower and Chadwick, patients with “poor-me” (PM) 
paranoia believe themselves to be innocent victims of the malign intentions of 
others, whereas those with “bad-me” (BM) delusions believe that they are being 
persecuted for good reason (that they are the sort of people who others reasonably 
might want to persecute). Not surprisingly, it has been reported that patients with

BM delusions typically suff er from lower self-esteem than PM patients (Chadwick, 
Trower, Juusti-Butler, & Maguire, 2005), although the self-esteem of PM patients 
is still lower than that of appropriately matched healthy controls (Melo, Taylor, 
& Bentall, 2006). BM patients are also typically much more depressed than PM 
patients (Melo et al., 2006), who are sometimes quite grandiose. 
 In a questionnaire study involving a large student sample and a smaller sam-
ple of psychotic patients, Melo et al. (2009) found that, in the student sample, 
fear of persecution was positively correlated with the belief that persecution was 
deserved whereas, in the patient sample, even severely paranoid patients tended to 
report low deservedness scores. Th is fi nding is consistent with observations from 
other studies that have reported that BM paranoia is rare in psychotic patients 
(Fornells-Ambrojo & Garety, 2005; Melo et al., 2006). 
 A more complex picture of the paranoid beliefs of patients emerges from three 
longitudinal studies in which patients were asked to make repeated deservedness 
judgments. In a study in which 41 patients were questioned haphazardly over a 
period of a month, Melo et al. (2006) found that some switched from PM to BM 
over the follow-up period. A further study using the same methodology revealed 
that these changes were accompanied by changes in self-esteem (Melo & Bentall, 
2012). In a more detailed study with a smaller sample, using the more intensive 
experience sampling method over a week, Udachina and colleagues (2012) again 
found that some patients’ deservedness judgements fl uctuated, sometimes over 
quite short periods. Th ose patients whose deservedness ratings fl uctuated were 
typically judged to be BM at the beginning of the study, whereas the deserved-
ness judgments of patients initially classifi ed as PM were relatively more stable. 
Overall, these fi ndings add up to a complex, dynamic picture of paranoia, with 
some similarities between subclinical and clinical variants, as outlined in Table 9.1. 
Although this degree of complexity creates challenges for the psychopathologist, 
it also provides some clues about the underlying psychological processes. 
 PARANOIA AS A FORM OF SOCIAL ADAPTATION 
 Over the past 10 years, epidemiologists have reported consistent evidence that a 
wide range of social environmental adversities confer an increased risk of psy-
chosis, especially if these adversities are experienced during childhood. Known 
social risk factors for psychosis include growing up in an urban area (Pedersen & 
Mortensen, 2001); being a member of an ethnic minority group (Cantor-Graae, 
Pedersen, McNeil, & Mortensen, 2003; Selten et al., 2001; Zolkowska, Cantor, 
& McNeil, 2001), particularly if living in a predominantly nonminority neigh-
borhood (Boydell et al., 2001; Veling et al., 2007) or if suff ering discrimination 
(Reininghaus et al., 2010; Veling et al., 2008); being separated from parents early 
in life (Morgan et al., 2007) or experiencing other kinds of nonoptimal relation-
ships with parents (Goldstein, 1998; Tienari et al., 2004); being the victim of sexual 
assault, especially in childhood (Bebbington et al., 2004; Read, van Os, Morrison, 
& Ross, 2005), and being the victim of bullying by peers (Arseneault et al., 2011; 

220 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
Schreier et al., 2009). Interestingly, some of these eff ects have been replicated with 
respect to subclinical psychotic experiences (e.g., Morrison & Petersen, 2003; 
van Os, Hanssen, Bijl, & Vollebergh, 2001) Th e eff ect sizes reported are generally 
much larger, and the data are much more consistent, than the fi ndings for any 
single genetic contribution to psychosis (a research area in which fi ndings have 
been notoriously diffi  cult to replicate; Crow [2008]). 
 Th ese observations raise the question of whether any particular kind of social 
adversity leads to paranoid thinking. Most studies in psychiatric epidemiology 
have adopted a broad defi nition of psychosis, so only a small number of inves-
tigations have addressed this question. In a sociological survey of residents of El 
Paso, in the United States, and Juarez in Mexico, Mirowsky and Ross (1983) found 
that paranoid beliefs were associated with social circumstances that they char-
acterized as involving victimization and powerlessness, and they also reported 
that external locus of control mediated between these experiences and paranoid 
thinking. In a prospective study based in Holland, Janssen et al. (2003) found that 
experiences of discrimination predicted the future onset of paranoid beliefs. It is 
possible that these kinds of eff ects help to explain the increased risk of psycho-
sis in certain ethnic minority groups; studies from the United States suggest that 
African Americans (Combs, Penn, & Fenigstein, 2002), especially if they have 
experienced racial discrimination (Combs et al., 2006), experience higher levels 
of paranoia than other ethnic groups. 
 In a recent study, Bentall, Wickham, Shevlin, and Varese (2012) studied the 
specifi city of diff erent types of adversity for diff erent types of psychotic symptoms 
using data from the 2007 U.K. Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey. Whereas hal-
lucinatory experiences (once comorbidity had been controlled for) appeared to 
be specifi cally associated with childhood sexual abuse, paranoid beliefs seemed

to be associated with the experience of physical abuse (being frequently beaten 
when a child) and being separated from parents, as indexed by being brought up 
in institutional care. 
 Physical abuse might be thought of as a kind of chronic victimization, whereas 
being brought up in institutional care is clearly an index of disrupted attachment 
relations. With respect to the latter, it is interesting to note that subclinical para-
noia is associated with an insecure attachment style (MacBeth, Schwannauer, 
& Gumley, 2008; Pickering, Simpson, & Bentall, 2008) and that adult paranoid 
patients, even when their symptoms are completely in remission, oft en report 
extremely negative relationships with their parents (Rankin, Bentall, Hill, & 
Kinderman, 2005). Hence, although any conclusions about the social origins of 
paranoia must be considered tentative, given the current evidence available, it 
seems plausible to hypothesize that lack of secure attachment relations (leading 
to a diffi  culty in trusting others), together with the experience of chronic threats, 
provide the life circumstances under which a paranoid way of understanding the 
world is most likely to develop. 
 Threat Anticipation as a Central Process 
 Sensitization to threat cues under the circumstances just described might be 
thought of as adaptive. Indeed, it is clearly considered to be adaptive by people 
experiencing either clinical or nonclinical paranoia, who oft en report that their 
beliefs have positive consequences (e.g., by endorsing questionnaire items such 
as “If I were not paranoid others would take advantage of me” (Campbell & 
Morrison, 2007; Morrison et al., 2005, 2011). Interestingly, Morrison et al. (2011) 
found that clinical, as opposed to nonclinical paranoia, was also characterized 
by the endorsement of highly negative beliefs about paranoid thinking (e.g. “My 
paranoia distresses me”). 
 All vertebrate species have mechanisms for anticipating and avoiding threaten-
ing events, which have been extensively studied in the animal learning laboratory, 
typically by means of the conditioned avoidance paradigm. (In this paradigm, 
animals are presented with a warning stimulus, such as a tone, a short time before 
receiving an aversive stimulus, such as an electric shock. On receipt of the shock, 
the animal is able to execute an escape response, for example by jumping over a 
barrier. Very quickly, the animal learns to anticipate the shock and avoid it on 
detecting the warning stimulus.) Interestingly, there is evidence that dopamine 
circuits in the basal ganglia play an important computational role in this kind of 
learning (Moutoussis, Bentall, Williams, & Dayan, 2008), an observation that may 
be of some signifi cance, given the widely held view that excessive dopamine trans-
mission is involved in psychosis (Kapur, Mizrahi, & Li, 2005). Indeed, all eff ective 
antipsychotics block avoidance behavior in animals but have no impact on escape 
behavior (even if an animal is in receipt of an antipsychotic, once it receives an 
aversive stimulus, such as an electric shock, it tries very hard to get away from it). 
For this reason, suppression of avoidance responding is employed as an initial

screening test by pharmaceutical companies when trying to develop new antipsy-
chotic agents (Moutoussis, Williams, Dayan, & Bentall, 2007). Th e implication of 
these observations is that psychosis in general, and perhaps paranoid thinking in 
particular, may co-opt dopamine-mediated avoidance mechanisms that are adap-
tive under most circumstances (an animal that could not learn to avoid threats 
would have little chance of surviving to maturity). 
 Human beings are highly social animals (Brothers, 1990; Dunbar, 1997), so 
it is perhaps not surprising that we are oft en preoccupied by social threats from 
those around us, as opposed to threats from natural phenomena or other species. 
However, studies of  threat perception and threat-related information processing in 
paranoid patients have produced a complex picture. On Stroop tasks, paranoid 
patients show evidence of increased attention to threat-related words (Bentall 
& Kaney, 1989) and words relating to self-esteem (Kinderman, 1994). Paranoid 
patients also show a tendency to more readily recall threat-related information 
compared to neutral information (Bentall, Kaney, & Bowen-Jones, 1995; Kaney, 
Wolfenden, Dewey, & Bentall, 1992). Some studies have shown that patients with 
paranoia, compared with healthy controls, have an enhanced ability to identify 
sham facial expressions, especially of negative emotional states (Davis & Gibson, 
2000; LaRusso, 1978), whereas others have shown that people with clinical or 
subclinical paranoia are poor at recognizing emotional expressions in general 
(Combs, Michael & Penn, 2006), and that clinically paranoid patients are poor 
at recognizing individual’s emotional states from their eyes (Craig, Hatton, & 
Bentall, 2004). Eye tracking studies, in which patients have been asked to look at 
scenes with threatening content, have revealed that patients with paranoid delu-
sions actually direct their gaze less toward threatening information than controls 
(Phillips & David, 1997b) and spend less time focusing on facial features than 
nonparanoid patients (Phillips & David, 1997a). Perhaps these apparent inconsis-
tencies can be resolved by Phillips and David’s (1997b) suggestion that paranoid 
individuals, like anxious patients, rapidly identify sources of threat before avert-
ing their gaze elsewhere. 
 Clearer evidence of the importance of social threat  anticipation  in paranoia 
comes from studies in which paranoid patients and others have been asked to 
estimate the likelihood of unpleasant encounters with other people. For exam-
ple, Kaney, Bowen-Jones, Dewey, and Bentall (1997) asked paranoid patients, 
depressed patients, and healthy controls to estimate how oft en various positive, 
neutral, and negative social encounters had occurred to them in the previous 
month, and how oft en these kinds of events were likely to happen in the future. 
Th is study found that paranoid patients, compared to controls, overestimated 
the likelihood of threats from others, a result that was subsequently replicated 
by Corcoran et al. (2006) and by Bentall et al. (2008). Interestingly, in these stud-
ies, judgments about the likelihood of future negative events correlated with the 
participants’ recall of past negative events in all groups with the exception of 
depressed patients. Th is observation suggests that, when anticipating threats, par-
anoid patients, like ordinary people, base their estimates of threat likelihood on 
the availability of memories of similar experiences (i.e., they used the “availability

heuristic” when predicting future events; Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982). 
Th e paranoid patients’ high estimates of future threat are therefore consistent with 
their preferential recall of threat-related information (Bentall et al., 1995; Kaney 
et al., 1992) and also with their actual experiences of victimization (Bentall et al., 
2012; Janssen et al., 2003; Mirowsky & Ross, 1983). 
 Two further aspects of these fi ndings are worth noting. First, the negative items 
used in these studies were fairly generic (e.g., “someone stares at you menac-
ingly”) and were not tied to the specifi c content of the patients’ delusions. Hence, 
it can be argued that what these studies demonstrate is a quite general tendency to 
overestimate threats. Second, Bentall et al. (2009) found that scores on these items 
correlated so highly with a clinical measure of paranoia that they were diffi  cult 
to distinguish from the clinical measure psychometrically. Hence, this tendency 
seems to be a core feature of paranoid thinking.   
 SOCIAL-COGNITIVE DEFICITS AND PARANOIA 
 A number of investigators have attempted to identify specifi c defi cits in reasoning 
and information processing that might infl uence the paranoid individual’s ten-
dency to overestimate threat. Two processes that have received particular atten-
tion are theory of mind (ToM) defi cits and the jumping to conclusions bias. 
 Individuals are said to have a “theory of mind” if they are able to infer the 
mental states (beliefs, attitudes, and emotions) of other people (Baron-Cohen, 
1995). It has been known for some years that autistic children, in particular, have 
diffi  culty with tasks that measure this kind of skill, for example, by requiring the 
participant to identify when someone holds a false belief (Baron-Cohen, Leslie, 
& Frith, 1985). Th e idea that this kind of defi cit might play a role in paranoid 
ideation was fi rst put forward by Chris Frith (1994). In a series of studies with 
Rhiannon Corcoran, he found that patients with paranoid delusions performed 
poorly on ToM tasks (Corcoran, Cahill, & Frith, 1997; Corcoran, Mercer, & Frith, 
1995; Frith & Corcoran, 1996), leading them to argue that, during an acute psy-
chotic episode, patients may become cognitively compromised and lose ToM 
skills that were intact until the onset of illness, and that this sudden inability to 
read the thoughts of other people might prompt the belief that others have con-
cealed malevolent intentions. 
 Following these initial fi ndings, a considerable amount of energy has been 
directed toward measuring ToM skills in patients with psychosis (Brune, 2005; 
Harrington, Siegert, & McClure, 2005). Th e only unequivocal fi nding is that ToM 
skills are usually impaired during a psychotic episode but, typically, not during 
remission. Some studies have reported that ToM impairments are specifi cally 
associated with paranoid symptoms (Corcoran et al., 2008; Randall, Corcoran, 
Day, & Bentall, 2003; Shryane et al., 2008), but other studies have either suggested 
that the impairment is not symptom-specifi c (e.g., Drury, Robinson, & Birchwood, 
1998) or is associated with other symptoms such as thought disorder (Sarfati & 
Hardy-Bayle, 1999; Sarfati, Hardy-Bayles, Brunet, & Widloecher, 1999). 

224 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
 A second controversy is the extent to which the eff ects of ToM are independent 
of a more general psychological impairment. It has been well documented that 
patients with psychosis, on average, perform poorly on cognitive tests, but it is 
equally clear that performance on such tests correlates with social functioning 
and negative symptoms rather than positive symptoms such as paranoid delu-
sions (Green, 1998). In a systematic review, Pickup (2008) was able to identify 
eight studies in which both ToM and executive functioning had been measured 
and which the latter was controlled for when determining whether ToM predicted 
psychosis; in all of these studies, the eff ect of ToM was found to survive aft er con-
trolling executive functioning. However, in a more recent transdiagnostic study, 
which examined depressed and schizophrenia patients both with and without 
paranoid beliefs, it was found that ToM scores, although contributing to paranoia, 
correlated very highly with a short IQ test (Bentall et al., 2009). 
 Th e second kind of cognitive defi cit that has been specifi cally investigated in 
relation to delusions in general and paranoia in particular is a tendency to jump 
to conclusions (JTC bias), typically measured by a “beads in a jar” task, in which 
the individual is asked to observe a sequence of blue or red beads and is asked to 
decide whether the beads are drawn from a jar with a majority of red beads or a 
jar with a majority of blue beads. Aft er each draw, the individual can either make 
a decision or ask to see another bead. Th e general fi nding, fi rst reported by Huq, 
Garety, and Hemsley (1988) and Garety, Hemsley, and Wessely (1991), is that, 
in comparison to controls, patients with delusions ask to see fewer beads before 
making a decision, and this has been replicated many times, including specifi cally 
with patients suff ering from paranoid delusions (e.g., Corcoran et al., 2008) and 
with ordinary people with high levels of paranoid conviction (Freeman, Pugh, & 
Garety, 2008). A recent study found that, in ordinary people, a brief anxiety induc-
tion procedure led to a temporary increase in JTC bias, with a corresponding 
increase in paranoid thoughts (Lincoln, Lange, Burau, Exner, & Moritz, 2010). 
 It is tempting to believe that the JTC bias is, as its name implies, simply a ten-
dency to make decisions on the basis of inadequate information, and that this 
leads to erroneous conclusions about the world or about preexisting anomalous 
experiences, and hence delusional beliefs (Garety et al., 2011). However, there 
are good reasons for doubting whether this is the case. In a version of the beads 
task in which individuals are asked to report their beliefs aft er seeing each bead, 
and in which the weight of the evidence fi rst favors one jar and then the other, 
deluded patients more quickly shift  their beliefs (Garety et al., 1991; Young & 
Bentall, 1997). Although deluded patients report a high subjective need for clo-
sure (a subjective need to reach defi nitive conclusions in the face of uncertainty; 
Bentall & Swarbrick, 2003), this tendency does not seem to correlate with the JTC 
bias (Colbert & Peters, 2002). In a recent transdiagnostic study of both depressed 
and schizophrenia patients, some in each group suff ering from paranoid delu-
sions, the JTC bias correlated heavily with general tests of intellectual function-
ing (Bentall et al., 2009). A more detailed Bayesian analysis of the choices of the 
participants in that study was able to break down the behavior of the participants 
into three parameters: the cost of waiting for further information (the standard

Social Cognition and the Dynamics of Paranoid Ideation

interpretation suggests that this should be high in deluded patients), the cost 
of reaching the wrong decision, and a random parameter essentially represent-
ing an inability to integrate information over the multiple trials of the task. It 
was this last, random parameter that diff erentiated the paranoid patients from 
the controls (Moutoussis, Bentall, El-Deredy, & Dayan, 2011). Hence, it appears 
that the tendency to jump to conclusions may refl ect a more general intellectual 
impairment. 
 EMOTIONAL FACTORS IN PARANOIA 
 Human beings, like other primates, tend to organize themselves in terms of social 
rank, with those of high social rank being much less vulnerable to social threat 
than those of low rank. Indeed, it has been argued that subjective self-esteem is 
simply an internal representation of our social rank relative to others (Allan & 
Gilbert, 1995; Leary, Tambor, Terdal, & Downs, 1995). Not surprisingly, therefore, 
some clinicians and researchers have argued that self-esteem plays an important 
role in paranoid thinking. For this reason, Zigler and Glick (1988) have argued 
that paranoid schizophrenia should be considered a camoufl aged form of depres-
sion (a condition which, they argued, was similarly characterized by problems of 
self-esteem and preserved cognitive functioning) and not a form of schizophrenia 
(in which, they assumed, impaired cognitive functioning was the main feature). 
However, the exact relationship between self-esteem and paranoia has proved to 
be a focus of some controversy. 
 One persistent idea, which can be traced to Bleuler (1911/1950) and certain 
psychoanalytic writers (Colby, 1977; Colby, Faught, & Parkinson, 1979) is that 
paranoia arises at least partly as a defence against low self-esteem. According 
to this account, the paranoid individual assumes that others have malevolent 
intentions because this is less painful than accepting that life’s misfortunes are 
self-caused. Th e most researched version of this theory, which was originally pro-
posed by the fi rst author and his colleagues (Bentall, Kinderman, & Kaney, 1994) 
and subsequently updated several times (Bentall, Corcoran, Howard, Blackwood, 
& Kinderman, 2001; Kinderman & Bentall, 1997), used theoretical constructs 
drawn from attribution theory (which concerns the social cognitive processes 
involved when people construct causal explanations for salient life experiences; 
Weiner, 2008) and also from self-discrepancy theory (a well researched model of 
how multiple representations of the self—for example, the actual self and the ideal 
self—when discrepant, lead to negative emotional states; Higgins, 1987). 
 Th e original attributional model was inspired by an early study in which par-
anoid patients were asked to generate attributions (statements about the likely 
causes) for hypothetical positive and negative events, such as being praised at 
work or failing an exam (Kaney & Bentall, 1989). Whereas the depressed controls 
in this study made excessively internal attributions for negative events (blaming 
themselves), the paranoid patients made excessively external attributions (blaming 
other people or circumstances). Bentall et al. (1994) therefore proposed that the 

226 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
paranoid individual has a latent negative self-schema that is easily activated when 
the individual is faced with a threat to a preferred view of the self, an event that 
would normally lead to activation of discrepancies between the person’s ideal self 
and actual self-perceptions and therefore to depression. According to the model, 
paranoid individuals escape the activation of this discrepancy and associated 
unpleasant feelings by making external attributions (explanations) for negative 
events—that is, by blaming external agents for their misfortunes. Although these 
kinds of explanations reduce the discrepancy between self-actual and self-ideal 
representations, they have the less desirable eff ect of activating beliefs that oth-
ers view them more negatively than they view themselves. It was argued that the 
recurrent use of this strategy leads to progressively more elaborate suspicions 
about the intentions of others and ultimately to a paranoid worldview. Th is theory 
predicts that explicit self-esteem in paranoia should be relatively preserved, but 
that self-esteem should appear very low on implicit measures. 
 In the fi rst revision of the theory (Kinderman & R. Bentall, 2000; Kinderman & 
Bentall, 1997), a distinction was drawn between two types of external explanations: 
a situational attribution in which a negative experience is blamed on circumstances 
or bad luck, and an external-personal attribution, in which the individual blames 
his or her misfortunes on the malevolent actions of others. Paranoid patients were 
observed to make an excessive number of external-personal attributions for nega-
tive events, and it was argued that the situational attributions made by ordinary 
people were, by contrast, psychologically benign. Th e paranoid patient’s tendency 
to make personal attributions was believed to be related to impaired ToM skills, 
as the ability to infer other’s mental states is oft en required in order to make situ-
ational attributions for negative events (e.g. if, when being ignored by a friend, 
we assume this is because the friend is preoccupied rather than angry toward us). 
Consistent with this last assumption, several studies have shown that, in ordi-
nary people, impaired ToM skills are associated with a tendency to make personal 
rather than situational attributions (Kinderman, Dunbar, & Bentall, 1998; Taylor 
& Kinderman, 2002). It was later argued that a tendency to jump to conclusions 
would also lead to rapid attribution generation, and therefore excessively personal 
rather than situational attributions, as the latter require more cognitive eff ort. 
Consistent with this assumption, Merrin, Kinderman, and Bentall (2007) found 
that paranoid patients searched for less information than controls when deciding 
the likely causes of events. 
 Th e most recent version of the attributional model (Bentall et al., 2001) took 
into account evidence from healthy people that showed that the relationship 
between attributions and self-representations is bidirectional (Kinderman & 
R. P. Bentall, 2000). For example, it seems that negative beliefs about the self can 
provoke internal (self-blaming) attributions for negative events (a person who 
believes him- or herself to be stupid will attribute the failure to pass an exam to 
him- or herself), whereas positive beliefs about the self will prompt external attri-
butions under these circumstances (the exam must have been unfair or situational 
factors made revision impossible). However, the kinds of attributions we make 
about our experiences modulate our beliefs about ourselves (a self-blaming or

internal attribution for a negative event will worsen self-esteem whereas external 
attributions will preserve a positive view of the self, even in the face of adver-
sity). Attributional and self-representational processes, in this model, are locked 
together in an attribution–self-representational cycle (see Figure 9.1). Th is ver-
sion of the theory predicts that self-esteem will be highly unstable in paranoid 
patients. 
 A competing psychological model of paranoia has been advanced by Daniel 
Freeman and colleagues (Freeman, Garety, & Fowler, 2008; Freeman, Garety, 
Kuipers, Fowler, & Bebbington, 2002), who argue that, rather than being a form 
of defence, paranoid delusions are a direct extension of emotional concerns of 
the individual. Following an earlier suggestion by Maher (1988) that delusions 
refl ect rational attempts to explain unusual experiences, they argue that, at the 
delusion formation stage, stressful life events, drug use, or a number of other fac-
tors, combined with preexisting emotional vulnerabilities, may lead to anomalous 
experiences that drive a search for meaning. In this search, individuals are likely 
to draw upon preexisting beliefs about the self, others, and the world. On this 
view (and consistent with the evidence on the social origins of paranoia discussed 
earlier), individuals will be more likely to develop a paranoid explanation if their 
earlier experiences (such as trauma) have provoked concerns about personal vul-
nerability accompanied by feelings of anxiety and depression. Preexisting anxiety 
is considered to be particularly relevant in this model as it refl ects expectations of 
impeding danger. However, other emotions, such as anger and depression, may 
also add to the contents of the delusional system. Th e explanations considered 
in the search for meaning will also be infl uenced by cognitive factors, such as 
JTC bias and ToM defi cits. Similarly to the attributional model of paranoia, this 
account also implicates the tendency to attribute negative events to external causes. 
However, the role of attributions in this case is seen as much more limited. 
 Freeman and colleagues further suggest that processes associated with emo-
tion are also likely to be involved in the maintenance of delusions which, they 
argue, oft en persist because of the emotion-driven attentional and memory biases 
described earlier. Th ey have also emphasized the importance of safety behav-
iors (avoidance behaviors designed to protect the individual from encountering

d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
their imagined threats), which are oft en reported by paranoid patients (Freeman, 
Garety, & Kuipers, 2001). Th ese kinds of behaviors prevent the individual from 
testing his or her paranoid beliefs and, paradoxically, in the long run lead to an 
increase in distress (Freeman et al., 2007). 
 It is probably worth noting, before proceeding further, that these models actu-
ally have quite a lot in common. Both argue that paranoia oft en arises against 
a background of adverse social experiences. Both emphasize the importance of 
emotional processes in paranoid thinking, especially feelings of personal vul-
nerability and low self-esteem. Both also allow a role for ToM defi cits and the 
JTC bias. Th e major diff erences are that Freeman’s model puts more emphasis 
on anomalous experiences during the earliest stages of delusion formation, and 
the attributional model emphasizes defensive processes (dysfunctional attempts 
to repair self-esteem). 
 Anomalous Perceptions 
 Th ere has been surprisingly little research on the role of anomalous experiences 
in paranoia. In an attempt to test Maher’s (1988) earlier anomalous perception 
model of delusions, Chapman and Chapman (1988) interviewed a large sample 
of individuals with subclinical psychotic symptoms, fi nding little evidence that 
delusional beliefs were associated with perceptual abnormalities. In a more recent 
experience sampling study, Ben-Zeev, Ellington, Swendsen, and Granholm (2010) 
assessed psychotic patients for emotional disturbance, hallucinatory experiences, 
and paranoid thoughts, fi nding that paranoid thinking was associated with an 
increase in anxiety, but no evidence that these thoughts were preceded by hal-
lucinatory experiences. However, the Freeman et al. (2002) model implies that 
anomalous perceptions may well be most important during the initial stage of the 
formation of paranoid beliefs. Consistent with this hypothesis, a study of children 
experiencing auditory hallucinations found that some went on to develop second-
ary delusional beliefs, and that those who were impaired in their performance on 
ToM tests were especially likely to do so (Bartels-Velthius, Blijd-Hoogwys, & van 
Os, 2011). 
 Deafness and sleep loss are two potential sources of anomalous experience 
that have been specifi cally investigated with respect to paranoia. Following clini-
cal observations of an apparent association between the slow onset of deafness 
and paranoid symptoms in later life, Cooper and his colleagues suggested that 
elderly patients’ failure to recognize that they have hearing diffi  culties might cause 
them to be mistrustful and suspicious of others (Cooper & Curry, 1976; Cooper, 
Garside, & Kay, 1976). In an attempt to test this hypothesis, Zimbardo, Andersen, 
and Kabat (1981) used hypnosis to induce a temporary state of deafness in sug-
gestible students, allowing some to remain aware that they had been hypnotized. 
Th ose who were unaware of the source of their deafness, but not those who knew 
that they had been hypnotized, showed an increase in paranoia, as indicated by 
their responses on questionnaires and by their attitudes toward others present

during the experiment. Th ese fi ndings are diffi  cult to interpret because it is not 
clear how well hypnotic deafness simulates real hearing loss, and studies pub-
lished soon aft erward failed to fi nd evidence of high rates of premorbid deafness 
in paranoid patients (Moore, 1981; Watt, 1985). However, more recent epidemio-
logical investigations have found an association between hearing impairment and 
paranoid beliefs at the population level (Th ewissen et al., 2005; van der Werf et al., 
2007). Th is association seems to be especially strong if the hearing impairment 
begins early in life (Stefanis, Th ewissen, Bakoula, van Os, & Myin-Germeys, 2006) 
and if the individual suff ering from the hearing impairment grows up in a com-
plex, inner-city environment (van der Werf, van Boxtel, & van Os, 2010). 
 With respect to sleep loss, Freeman, Pugh, Vorontsoya, and Southgate (2009) 
found that paranoid patients were especially likely to have experienced sleep dif-
fi culties, with about 50% aff ected. In an epidemiological study, it was found that 
sleep loss, along with depression and anxiety, predicted the development of para-
noid symptoms at 18-month follow-up. Most impressively of all, perhaps, a pilot 
study of a brief psychological intervention to reduce insomnia led to a fairly rapid 
reduction in paranoid thinking in a small group of psychotic patients (Myers, 
Startup, & Freeman, 2011). 
 Clearly, the role of anomalous experiences in paranoia should be subjected to 
further investigation. Th e evidence that currently exists suggests that these expe-
riences may well be important in some cases, particularly during the formation of 
paranoid beliefs. Th e fi ndings on insomnia are particularly intriguing, although 
it is not clear that anomalous experiences is the mechanism behind this eff ect; 
as Freeman and his colleagues acknowledge, chronic sleep deprivation can have 
many eff ects, including cognitive impairment, depression, and anxiety, all of 
which may provoke paranoid thoughts. 
 Experiential Avoidance, Attributions, and Defensiveness 
in Paranoid Patients 
 Evidence of abnormal defensiveness in people with paranoid beliefs is more dif-
fi cult to interpret. One way of construing defensiveness is in terms of the avoid-
ance of unwanted mental contents (Moutoussis et al., 2007)—sometimes termed 
“experiential avoidance” (EA) by cognitive-behavior therapists (Hayes, Wilson, 
Giff ord, Follette, & Strosahl, 1996). In two recent studies, one with students dif-
fering in scores on a paranoia questionnaire (Udachina et al., 2009), and one with 
psychiatric patients (Moutoussis, El-Deredy, & Bentall, in press) it was found that 
EA as reported by questionnaire was highly correlated with paranoia, and that this 
eff ect survived aft er controlling for mood. Furthermore, in the study carried out 
with students (Udachina et al., 2009), the experience sampling methodology was 
used to show that periods of self-reported paranoia were typically preceded by 
periods of self-reported EA. However, it is not clear to what extent self-reported 
EA correlates with actual, behavioral EA. In the study by Moutoussis, El-Deredy, 
et al. (in press), a novel experimental procedure was used that allowed participants 

230 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
to avoid thinking about negative aspects of the self, and no evidence of excessive 
avoidance was found in paranoid patients. Other evidence pertaining to this ques-
tion is no clearer. 
 Recall that, according to the attributional model, two lines of evidence point 
to abnormal defensiveness. First, the model proposes that paranoid individuals 
show an excessive tendency to attribute negative events to external causes (the 
actions of others) and positive events to internal causes. Th is is believed to be an 
exaggeration of the normal “self-serving bias” that is found in ordinary people, 
particularly when self-esteem is threatened, and which is believed to be a method 
of buff ering self-esteem in the face of adversity (Campbell & Sedikides, 1999). 
Second, the theory also suggests that, on implicit measures of self-esteem (when 
attributional defences are by-passed), self-esteem should be low, but that it should 
be relatively preserved on explicit measures. 
 In fact, the evidence on attributional style and paranoia is, at best, mixed. 
Some early studies seemed to confi rm that paranoia is associated with a strong 
self-serving bias (Candido & Romney, 1990; Fear, Sharp, & Healy, 1996; S Kaney 
& Bentall, 1989), but many subsequent studies have failed to fi nd this association. 
A number of factors may account for these inconsistencies in the evidence. 
 First, researchers have used a wide range of measures of attributional reasoning, 
varying from questionnaire measures such as Peterson et al.’s (1982) Attributional 
Style Questionnaire (ASQ) and Kinderman and Bentall’s (1996) Internal, Personal 
and Situational Attributions Questionnaire (IPSAQ), through experimental pro-
cedures in which individuals have been asked to report the causes of contrived 
success and failure experiences (Kaney & Bentall, 1992) to naturally occurring 
attributions coded from interviews (Lee, Randall, Beattie, & Bentall, 2004). Th e 
ASQ, which is perhaps the most widely employed measure, has been criticized for 
poor reliability, especially on the crucial internality subscale (Reivich, 1995). Th is 
measure does not distinguish between external-personal and external-situational 
attributions, which are measured separately by the IPSAQ, which allows the cal-
culation of an externalizing bias (the tendency to attribute positive events more 
than negative events to internal causes) and a personalizing bias (the tendency, 
when making external attributions, to assume the cause is some action of others 
rather than chance or situational factors). 
 Second, studies have involved both clinical and nonclinical participants who 
have varied in the severity of their paranoid beliefs. Janssen et al. (2006) reported 
evidence of an abnormal self-serving bias in acutely ill paranoid patients, but not 
in people suff ering from subclinical paranoia. Combs et al. (2007) used a cluster 
analysis to identify groups of student participants who were maximally homog-
enous within each group and maximally diff erent from each other on a range of 
dimensions, including depression and fear of negative evaluation. Th is analysis 
identifi ed three discreet groups: paranoid students with high levels of depression, 
paranoid students with moderate depression, and paranoid students without 
depression. When paranoia was correlated with the externalizing and personal-
izing biases within the entire sample, no associations were found. However, group 
comparisons showed that nondepressed paranoid students and paranoid students

Social Cognition and the Dynamics of Paranoid Ideation 
231
with moderate depression showed a greater externalizing bias than the depressed 
paranoid students, whereas nondepressed paranoid students also showed an 
abnormal personalizing bias. Similar results were obtained in another study that 
found no association between paranoia and attributions in a large sample of stu-
dents (Fornells-Ambrojo & Garety, 2009); comparisons between extreme high 
and extreme low scorers on paranoia revealed that paranoid students generated 
more external-personal attributions for negative events than their nonparanoid 
counterparts. Hence, attributional abnormalities seem to be associated with only 
the most severe levels of paranoia. 
 A third factor that makes the attributional data rather hard to interpret is 
comorbid symptoms, which have oft en been neglected. Th is limitation is particu-
larly important with respect to depression, as it is known that low mood is associ-
ated with an attenuated or even reversed self-serving bias (Abramson, Seligman, 
& Teasdale, 1978; Mezulis, Abramson, Hyde, & Hankin, 2004). For example, in an 
apparently negative study of the association between paranoia and attributional 
style conducted by Humphreys and Barrowclough (2006), levels of depression 
were approximately twice as high in the currently paranoid patients (mean Beck 
Depression Index [BDI] score = 25.40) than in the nonparanoid clinical con-
trols they were compared to (14.85). Jolley et al. (2006) estimated the relation-
ship between paranoia and attributional style measured with the ASQ in a sample 
of psychotic patients while controlling for comorbid depression and grandiosity. 
Th ey found that an externalizing bias for negative events but not positive events 
was predicted by a combination of paranoia and grandiosity, with more paranoid 
and more grandiose patients showing the greatest bias. In contrast, an external-
izing bias for positive events was predicted by a combination of paranoia and 
depression. Consistent with this fi nding, Melo et al. (2009) reported an abnormal 
externalizing bias for negative events in patients with PM paranoid beliefs, but not 
in patients with BM beliefs. 
 A fi nal complicating factor is that attributions may be better considered as 
 actions than a  style . Th at is, they may not be trait-like and, indeed, this is implicit 
in the latest version of the attributional model of paranoia and the concept of 
an attribution self-representation cycle (Bentall et al., 2001). Consistent with this 
account, Bentall and Kaney (2005) reported that paranoid patients showed an 
excessive externalizing bias for negative events before a contrived failure experi-
ence (participants were asked to solve a series of anagrams, some of which were 
unsolvable) but not aft erward, when their attributional style was similar to that of 
depressed controls.  
 Self-Esteem in Paranoid Patients 
 A second diffi  culty with the attributional model of paranoia is that it seems to 
imply that patients, at least on explicit tests, should evidence preserved self-esteem. 
As Freeman et al. (1998) have pointed out, many patients suff ering from paranoid 
delusions in fact appear to have low self-esteem. Th is has been confi rmed in a 

232 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
number of studies, including a large cross-sectional study of patients with various 
psychiatric diagnoses conducted by the author of the attributional model (Bentall 
et al., 2008). 
 With respect to implicit measures of self-esteem, results have been very mixed. 
Lyon, Kaney, and Bentall (1994) administered an implicit measure of attributional 
style (disguised as a memory test) to paranoid patients and controls, fi nding that 
the paranoid patients made excessively self-blaming attributions for negative 
events (the pattern typically found in depressed patients). Th e results were inter-
preted as consistent with the defensiveness hypothesis since, it was argued, the 
self-derogatory attributions made by the patients on the implicit task were con-
sistent with implicit low self-esteem. However, with the exception of one study in 
which paranoia was associated with low implicit and also low explicit self-esteem 
(Mehl et al., 2010), other researchers have not been able to replicate this fi nding 
(Diez-Alegria, Vazquez, Nieto-Moreno, Valiente, & Fuentenebro, 2006; Kristev, 
Jackson, & Maude, 1999; Martin & Penn, 2002). 
 Th e Implicit Attitudes Test (Greenwald & Farnham, 2000) is a more promis-
ing measure of implicit self-esteem for studies of paranoia. Th is well-validated 
measure requires individuals to sort self-relevant and self-irrelevant words, mixed 
with positive and negative words, into the two categories in two conditions: self 
or good versus other or bad and self or bad versus other or good. Greater speed 
when the self-relevant and positive words are sorted into the same category, as 
opposed to when the self-relevant and negative words are sorted into the same 
category, is taken as an index of positive implicit self-esteem. On this test, sev-
eral research groups have reported a discrepancy between preserved explicit but 
impaired implicit self-esteem in paranoid patients (McKay, Langdon, & Coltheart, 
2007; Moritz, Werner, & von Collani, 2006; Valliente, Cantero, Vazquez, Sanchez 
et al. 2011). However, once again, other studies have failed to fi nd diff erences 
between implicit and explicit self-esteem in paranoid patients (Kesting, Mehl, 
Rief, Lindenmeyer, & Lincoln, 2011) and ordinary people suff ering from subclini-
cal paranoia (Cicero & Kerns, 2011). Overall, the inconsistencies in the fi ndings 
are concerning and perhaps suggest that further thinking about the relationship 
between self-esteem and paranoia is required. 
 Th e studies considered so far have two serious limitations. First, they fail to 
distinguish between PM and BM paranoia. As discussed earlier, on explicit tests 
of self-esteem at least (appropriate studies using implicit measures have yet to 
be conducted), PM patients, who believe that their persecution is undeserved, 
show higher self-esteem than do BM patients, who believe that their persecu-
tion is deserved (Chadwick et al., 2005). Second, they have failed to address the 
dynamics of psychological processes, assuming that self-esteem is a relatively 
stable trait. 
 Inspired by the latest version of the attributional model of paranoia, and the 
concept of an attribution–self-representation cycle, Th ewissen, Bentall, Lecomte, 
van Os, and Myin-Germeys (2008) conducted an experience sampling study, in 
which paranoid and nonparanoid patients, as well as healthy controls, rated their 
own self-esteem 10 times a day for 6 days. In this study, paranoia was associated

with self-esteem that was, when averaged over the recording period, low, but also 
highly fl uctuating. Th e relationship between paranoia and stability of self-esteem 
survived, even aft er average self-esteem and depression were controlled for. 
Using a simpler diary method, Melo and Bentall (2012) found that these shift s 
in self-esteem were associated with a tendency to switch between BM and PM 
beliefs. 
 In a more recent ESM study, Udachina et al. (2012) compared patients who 
were judged to be PM or BM at the beginning of the study period, fi nding again 
that self-esteem was unstable in relation to paranoia. Interestingly, PM and BM 
patients responded very diff erently following the onset of paranoid thoughts. In 
the latter group, the onset of paranoia was followed by a further reduction in self-
esteem. However, as might be predicted by a defence model, in PM patients, the 
onset of paranoid thoughts was followed by an improvement in self-esteem. 
 CONCLUSION 
 From being a topic that was virtually neglected only two decades ago (Oltmanns 
& Maher, 1988), the study of delusional thinking, and paranoia in particular, has 
become a major focus of psychological inquiry. It might be argued that eff orts 
so far have produced almost as much confusion as clarifi cation and, certainly, 
some lines of research, particularly studies focusing on self-esteem and attribu-
tions, have generated fi ndings that are inconsistent and sometimes contradictory. 
Nonetheless, there seem to be some points of consensus among researchers in the 
area, and it is possible to see the outlines of a dynamic, developmental model of 
paranoia emerging from the evidence. 
 First, it is now generally accepted that adverse early experiences and victimiza-
tion increase the risk of paranoid beliefs in later life. Whereas previously it has 
not been possible to specify which kinds of adversity are associated with paranoia, 
the emerging evidence suggests that disturbed attachment relations and chronic 
victimization are particularly toxic infl uences. In a way, these fi ndings are not 
surprising; attachment theorists argue that early relationships form a template 
for forming trusting relationships with others in adulthood (Holmes, 1993), so it 
stands to reason that disruption of these relationships, especially when combined 
with experiences such as discrimination, create the circumstances in which the 
mistrust of others is an adaptive process. 
 Second, the data on ToM and, especially, the JTC bias has been fairly consistent 
and, again, it is not hard to see why defi cits in this area, especially against the kind 
of background we have already alluded to, might increase the tendency to assume 
that the world is populated by malevolent others. However, there is no agreement 
about the extent to which these defi cits might refl ect a more generalized underly-
ing cognitive defi cit, rather than defi cits in specifi c domains (Bentall et al., 2009). 
If these measures are tapping into a more generalized defi cit, then future research 
must address what this defi cit is. One suggestion by Corcoran (2010) is that these 
tasks require an ability for “mental time travel,” or to synthesize information 

234 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
across time. A more simple possibility is that they refl ect poor executive function. 
An impairment of this kind might contribute to paranoid thinking by making it 
diffi  cult to consider alternative, nonparanoid explanations for troubling events. 
As Coltheart (2007) has suggested, any account of abnormal beliefs needs to con-
sider not only the source of the unusual ideas entertained by the patient but also 
why the individual is unable to reason these ideas away. 
 With respect to the two models of paranoia that have received most attention 
from researchers—the attributional account in its various forms (Bentall et al., 
2001; Bentall et al., 1994; Kinderman & Bentall, 1997) and the model proposed by 
Freeman and his colleagues (Freeman, Garety, et al., 2008; Freeman et al., 2002)—
there is no escaping the fact that the latter seems to receive more support from the 
available study data. If the attributional account was a viable model of the  onset 
of paranoid delusions, then an abnormal attributional style should appear very 
early in or even before the development of paranoid thoughts. In fact, attribu-
tional abnormalities, when they have been observed, have been reported only in 
people with full-blown delusional systems (Janssen et al., 2006; McKay, Langdon, 
& Coltheart, 2005), especially those with PM or grandiose paranoia (Jolley et al., 
2006; Melo et al., 2006) and not in people with subclinical paranoid ideation. 
Hence, attributional abnormalities tend to make a very late appearance in the 
evolution of the paranoid belief system. For this reason, at present, the model by 
Freeman and his colleagues (Freeman, Garety, et al., 2008; Freeman et al., 2002) 
seems to provide a better account of the processes that may be important during 
the emergence of paranoid beliefs which, at this stage, we have argued, tend to be 
of the BM variety. One feature of the Freeman et al. model that perhaps should 
be prioritized for future research is the role of anomalous experiences; on present 
evidence, it seems likely that these experiences may be important in only some 
patients. 
 Nonetheless, it may be too soon to write off  the hypothesis of a paranoid 
defence entirely. Acute paranoid delusions, especially of the PM type, seem to 
be particularly associated with defensive performance on various psychological 
measures (McKay et al., 2007; Moritz et al., 2006; Valiente et al., 2011). Moreover, 
the psychological processes underlying paranoid delusions seem to be peculiarly 
dynamic during psychotic illness (Th ewissen et al., 2008; Udachina et al., 2012), 
so that patients fl uctuate between the PM and BM types and show corresponding 
changes in attributional style and self-esteem related variables (Melo et al., 2006; 
Melo & Bentall, in press; Udachina et al., 2012). Hence, there appears to be some 
evidence of defensiveness during the acute stage of a psychotic illness, and the 
attributional model, at least in its latest incarnation, which emphasizes dynamic, 
nonlinear interactions between psychological processes (Bentall et al., 2001), 
remains a plausible account of what may be happening at this stage. Elsewhere, we 
have argued that this may occur when dopamine-mediated avoidance processes 
are turned on self-generated cognitive processes (Moutoussis et al. 2007). 
 Th ere are two important methodological implications of this review. First, 
future research should pay more attention to particular subtypes of paranoia. 
Second, and related to this, more attention should be given to the developmental

precursors of paranoia. An underlying theme of this review has been the idea that 
paranoid beliefs emerge at the end of a long developmental pathway. A clearer 
understanding of the role of social cognition in paranoia is likely to emerge only 
following a detailed examination of the evolution of the relevant psychological 
processes from nascent suspiciousness, through the prodromal stage, to the acute 
psychotic crisis and beyond. Th is will require the use of sophisticated longitudinal 
designs that have so far been rarely applied in this fi eld (see Peer, Kupper, Long, 
Brekke, & Spaulding [2007] for a discussion of these approaches).

 Social Cognition Early in the 
Course of the Illness  
 J E A N    A D D I N G T O N  A N D   D A N I J E L A   P I S K U L I C  ■ 
 Interest and research in social cognition has experienced tremendous growth in 
the past 5–10 years, as is clearly presented in earlier chapters in this book. It is well 
established that individuals with schizophrenia have impairment on a wide range 
of social cognitive tasks relative to healthy controls, as well as to other diagnos-
tic groups. What is less clear is when these impairments begin. Are they present 
at the start of the illness, or even before there is evidence of full-blown psycho-
sis? Over the last 15 years, a major emphasis has been placed on early detection 
and intervention in the development of a psychotic illness. Th e goal was to detect 
and treat major psychotic illnesses early in their development, so that individuals 
could receive appropriate treatment at the earliest stage possible and have the best 
opportunity for recovery. Th is work focused on identifying young people as soon 
as possible aft er the onset of the psychotic illness (Addington et al., 2007). More 
recently, the focus has moved to an even earlier stage of the illness, the prodrome, 
since there is evidence that subclinical symptoms are present during the prepsy-
chotic period. 
 In schizophrenia, the prodromal phase refers to the signs and symptoms 
that a person experiences prior to the onset of a full-blown syndrome (Yung, 
Phillips, Yuen, & McGorry, 2004). Recent developments in research have led 
to the development of reliable criteria to identify individuals who may be at 
risk of developing psychosis and thus potentially experiencing a prodrome 
for psychosis (McGlashan, Walsh, & Woods, 2010). Th e criteria for what can 
be thought of as a putative prodrome for psychosis was fi rst introduced by 
Alison Yung and colleagues in Melbourne, Australia (Yung & McGorry, 1996) 
and incorporated into the Comprehensive Assessment of the At-Risk Mental 
State (CAARMS). Th ese criteria were modifi ed by McGlashan and colleagues 
(McGlashan et al., 2010) to form the Criteria of Psychosis-risk Syndromes 
(COPS). Th e COPS are evaluated using the Structured Interview for Prodromal 
Syndromes (SIPS) and the Scale of Prodromal Symptoms (SOPS) (McGlashan 
et al., 2010). 

246 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
 Both the Melbourne criteria and the COPS have three possible criteria: brief 
intermittent psychotic symptoms (BIPS), attenuated positive symptoms (APS) 
and/or genetic risk and deterioration (GRD). Th e BIPS state requires the presence 
of any one or more threshold positive psychotic symptoms that are too brief to 
meet diagnostic criteria for psychosis. 
 Th e APS requires the presence of at least one particular positive psychotic 
symptom of insuffi  cient severity to meet diagnostic criteria for a psychotic 
 disorder. Th e GRD requires having a combination of both functional decline and 
genetic risk; genetic risk refers to having either schizotypal personality disorder or 
a fi rst-degree relative with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (McGlashan et al., 
2010). 
 Researchers are therefore able to prospectively follow the course of the illness, 
with the goal of being able to distinguish early on diff erences in those who go 
on to develop schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder from those who do 
not. Current evidence indicates that approximately 25% of these at-risk individu-
als will go on to develop a full-blown illness within 1 year and 35% in 2 years 
(Cannon et al., 2008). Several terms have been coined to distinguish this popula-
tion from other high-risk groups, such as those with a family history risk or those 
with schizotypy. Th ese individuals are considered to be at enhanced high risk and 
thus the Melbourne group used the term “ultra-high risk” (UHR). Since the risk 
is oft en based on the presence of clinical symptoms, these individuals have also 
been described as being at clinical high risk (CHR) of developing psychosis. In 
this chapter, the term CHR will be used to describe such samples. 
 First, we will review relevant literature on social cognition at the fi rst episode, 
then during the period of clinical high risk, and, fi nally, for those who are at 
 familial high risk of developing the illness. 
 SOCIAL COGNITION IN FIRST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS 
 It has been well established that the performance on a range of social cognitive 
tests in patients with schizophrenia is reliably below that of healthy volunteers, and 
that it correlates with poorer functional outcomes (Fett et al., 2011). A number of 
reviews and meta-analytic studies have suggested a strong magnitude of impair-
ment for social cognitive domains such as theory of mind (ToM) (Brune, 2005; 
Sprong, Schothorst, Vos, Hox, & van Engeland, 2007; Bora, Yucel, & Pantelis, 2009); 
aff ect recognition, both facial aff ect (Kohler, Walker, Martin, Healey, & Moberg, 
2009) and emotional prosody (i.e., vocal emotion perception or the evaluation 
of emotional non-lexical cues in speech; Hoekert, Kahn, Pijnenborg, & Aleman, 
2007); and social perception/knowledge (Piskulic, Addington, & Maruff , 2010). 
An overwhelming majority of these explorations, however, have been based on 
patients in the more chronic stage of the illness. It therefore remains unclear if 
the degree of impairment is diff erent in earlier stages of the illness, such as at the 
recent onset or fi rst episode (FE) of psychosis, and if those impairments apply to 
multiple domains of social cognition (Green et al., in press).

Social Cognition Early in the Course of the Illness 
247
 Compared to the chronic stage, FE psychosis is generally characterized by 
greater fl uctuations in clinical presentation and can therefore be particularly 
informative when determining whether social cognitive defi cits are state or trait 
phenomena, or a combination of the two (Nuechterlein et al., 1992; Horan et al., 
in press). It can be similarly informative when assessing if defi cits in social cogni-
tion are potential vulnerability indicators while ruling out possible confounding 
 factors such as illness chronicity and long-term medication use. 
 To date, evidence from cross-sectional studies suggests that FE individuals 
exhibit impairments on multiple domains of social cognition such as ToM, aff ect 
recognition (both facial and prosodic), social perception/knowledge, and attri-
butional bias. In the following sections, we review fi ndings from all studies of FE 
psychosis that explored defi cits in those four domains of social cognition. 
 Affect Recognition in First-Episode Psychosis 
 Aff ect recognition is the capacity to recognize and be aware of emotional expres-
sions in one and others. It includes identifying, facilitating, understanding, and 
managing emotions, either by observing body language or nonlexical cues in 
speech. In FE psychosis research, six studies have investigated aff ect perception 
defi cits using a variety of tests. Whereas all six studies explored facial aff ect rec-
ognition, two studies also looked at aff ective prosody, making it the focus of their 
investigation (Edwards, Pattison, Jackson, & Wales, 2001; Kucharska-Pietura, 
David, Masiak, & Phillips, 2005). 
 All studies compared performance on aff ect recognition tests in groups of 
FE individuals with that of healthy volunteers. Changes in aff ect recognition 
across diff erent stages of psychotic illness were examined in three studies using 
the cross-sectional design and comparing FE individuals with samples of par-
ticipants with chronic schizophrenia (Addington, Saeedi, & Addington, 2006a; 
Kucharska-Pietura et al., 2005; Pinkham, Penn, Perkins, Graham, & Siegel, 
2007). Temporal stability of aff ective processing defi cits in fi rst-episode psy-
chosis individuals was additionally investigated by three research groups who 
retested their samples aft er a 12-month period (Addington et al., 2006a) and 
following a short-term antipsychotic treatment (Behere, Venkatasubramanian, 
Arasappa, Reddy, & Gangadhar, 2009; Herbener, Hill, Marvin, & Sweeney, 
2005). 
 Compared to healthy volunteers, individuals with FE psychosis were reported to 
be impaired on multiple components of aff ect recognition, irrespective of modal-
ity, facial or prosodic. Th at is, FE individuals were reportedly performing poorer 
than controls on tests of aff ect recognition (Addington et al., 2006a; Behere et al., 
2009; Edwards et al., 2001; Kucharska-Pietura et al., 2005; Pinkham et al., 2007), 
aff ective acuity (Herbener et al., 2005), and aff ect discrimination (Addington et 
al., 2006a; Herbener et al., 2005; Pinkham et al., 2007), which is in accordance 
with fi ndings from studies in chronic schizophrenia (Hoekert et al., 2007; Kohler 
et al., 2009). Impairments in aff ect recognition in FE individuals were, however, of 

248 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
comparable (Addington et al., 2006a ; Pinkham et al., 2007) or lesser magnitude 
(Kucharska-Pietura et al., 2005) to those reported in chronic schizophrenia. 
 Furthermore, four studies have investigated the stability of defi cits in aff ect 
recognition over time. Specifi cally, Addington and colleagues (2006a) and Horan 
et al. (in press) reported defi cits to be stable at 12-month follow-up, which was 
irrespective of improvements in symptoms. Herbener et al. (2005) also reported 
no change in aff ect recognition over time. Only one study using treatment-na ï ve 
schizophrenia patients (Behere et. al., 2009) reported a reduction in aff ect recog-
nition defi cits, suggesting that the outcome was most likely secondary to symp-
tom improvement following medication treatment. Th us, although there are few 
longitudinal studies, there is preliminary evidence of stability of aff ect recognition 
defi cits in FE psychosis. 
 Social Perception and Social Knowledge in First-Episode Psychosis 
 Social perception is the awareness of cues that typically occur in social situa-
tions. Social knowledge is the awareness of what is socially expected in diff er-
ent situations, and it guides social interactions (Green, Olivier, Crawley, Penn, & 
Silverstein, 2005). Since the identifi cation of social cues generally requires knowl-
edge of what is expected and acceptable in social situations (Green et al., 2005), 
social perception and social knowledge are oft en considered together under the 
domain of social perception. 
 In schizophrenia research, the concept of social perception and social knowl-
edge has not been as extensively researched as other domains, such as aff ect rec-
ognition and ToM, which is also true of the research in FE psychosis. To date, only 
two studies investigated social perception and social knowledge in FE individu-
als, relative to chronic schizophrenia and healthy control samples (Addington, 
Saeedi, & Addington, 2006b; Green et al., in press). Results of these studies dem-
onstrated that FE individuals were as impaired as chronic schizophrenia patients 
in their understanding of social relationships (Green et al., in press), their ability 
to appraise social roles and context, and their awareness of the rules, goals, and 
roles that characterize social situations (Addington et al., 2006b). Longitudinal 
investigations of social perception and social knowledge test performance sug-
gested persistent defi cits across a 12-month study period (Horan et al., in press). 
 Theory of Mind in First-Episode Psychosis 
 Th eory of mind, also referred to as  mentalizing or  mental state attribution , typi-
cally involves the ability to infer the intentions, dispositions, and beliefs of oth-
ers (Frith & Corcoran, 1996; Green et al., 2005). To the best of our knowledge, 
there have been seven studies to date that examined ToM performance in FE 
samples. Although all studies compared FE individuals with healthy volunteers, 
one study additionally examined ToM performance across diff erent stages of

Social Cognition Early in the Course of the Illness 
249
illness (Green et al., in press) and one study included a group of clinical controls 
(Kettle, O’Brien-Simpson, & Allen, 2008). Only one research group additionally 
examined temporal stability of ToM performance over a 12-month period (Horan 
et al., in press). 
 Findings based on comparisons with healthy volunteers from all seven studies 
suggest that FE individuals exhibited impaired performance on a range of ToM 
tests. Specifi cally, FE individuals were impaired in their ability to perceive com-
plex mental states (Kettle et al., 2008), understand and describe social interactions 
(Koelkebeck et al., 2010), and correctly infer intentions and mental states of oth-
ers (Bertrand, Sutton, Achim, Malla, & Lepage, 2007; Herold et al., 2009; Inoue 
et al., 2006), including understanding of irony and empathy (Green et al., in press; 
Williams et al., 2008). Green and colleagues (in press) compared FE individuals 
to patients with chronic schizophrenia using the Awareness of Social Inference 
Test Part III (TASIT; McDonald et al., 2003) as a measure of ToM and reported 
no signifi cant group diff erence. Moreover, the authors reported that both clinical 
groups were signifi cantly impaired on ToM compared to healthy volunteers. In a 
subsequent longitudinal study by the same group, FE individuals were followed 
up over the period of 12 months. Th e authors reported good longitudinal stability. 
Last, in the study by Kettle and colleagues (2008), in which FE individuals were 
compared to patients with major depressive disorder, the authors reported no dif-
ference on the “eyes task” between the two groups. 
 Based on the current research from FE studies, which almost exclusively comes 
from cross-sectional research, there is evidence that FE patients have impairments 
relative to controls and similar to those with a more chronic course of illness. No 
conclusions can be drawn regarding trait or state status of ToM impairments in 
psychosis, or their specifi city to FE psychosis. 
 Attributional Style in First-Episode Psychosis 
 Attributional style refers to the causal explanations that individuals attribute 
to their own behavior and the behavior of others (Fiske & Taylor, 1991). Th is 
domain of social cognition is generally assessed in reference to patients who 
experience hallucinations and delusions, especially persecutory delusions, and 
their explanations of positive and negative life events. A tendency to internally 
attribute more positive than negative events to self is referred to as  self-serving 
bias (SSB). 
 Most of what is now known about attributional style in psychosis comes from 
research in chronic schizophrenia. Only two studies to date investigated attri-
butional style in FE psychosis using cross-sectional design and both overt (i.e., 
Pragmatic Inference Task [PIT], Winters & Neale, 1985; and Internal, Personal 
and Situational Attributions Questionnaire [IPSAQ], Kinderman & Bentall, 1996) 
and covert (i.e., Attributional Style Questionnaire [APQ], Lyon, Kaney, & Bentall, 
1994) assessment methods (Humphreys & Barrowclough, 2006; Krstev, Jackson, 
& Maude, 1999). Based on the current evidence using overt tests of attributional 

250 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
style, level of paranoia did not predict SSB in FE individuals. On the covert tests, 
however, FE individuals reportedly showed an underlying depressive attributional 
style, whereby they made more external attributions for positive than for nega-
tive events and more internal attributions for negative than for positive events 
(Humphreys & Barrowclough, 2006; Krstev et al., 1999). Furthermore, this pat-
tern of association in FE psychosis was the same as that reported in patients with 
chronic schizophrenia, although not as pronounced (Krstev et al., 1999). Given 
the limited evidence and lack of longitudinal research, the stability of attributional 
style in FE psychosis remains unclear. 
 Correlates of Social Cognition at the First Episode 
 Current fi ndings regarding clinical, neurocognitive, and real-life functioning cor-
relates of social cognition in FE psychosis are mixed. Results from cross-sectional 
studies suggest both presence and absence of association between psychopathol-
ogy and performance on tests across diff erent domains of social cognition. Th e 
same is true for longitudinal studies that reported both small reductions (Behere 
et al., 2009; Horan et al., in press) and no change (Addington et al., 2006a,b; 
Herbener et al., 2005) in social cognitive defi cits following improvement in 
psychopathology. 
 Although social cognition is considered psychometrically distinguishable from 
neurocognition (Sergi et al., 2007), evidence from FE research suggests that there 
still exists a signifi cant association between the two constructs (Addington et al., 
2006a,b; Bertrand et al., 2007; Koelkebeck et al., 2010; Krstev et al., 1999). Despite 
the association, however, social cognitive defi cits reportedly persisted even aft er 
neurocognitive performance was controlled for (Bertrand et al., 2007; Koelkebeck 
et al., 2010). 
 Finally, there is evidence to suggest that social cognition has a unique associa-
tion with functional outcome in the early course of psychosis, as it was reported 
as a signifi cant predictor of real-life functioning (Horan et al., in press) and a 
mediator of the relationship between neurocognition and poor functional out-
come (Addington, Girard, Christensen, & Addington, 2010). 
 Summary 
 Overall, consistent evidence demonstrates that individuals at the fi rst episode of 
psychosis not only demonstrate signifi cant impairment in all domains of social 
cognition, but that this impairment is comparable to that reported in more chronic 
stages of illness. Although there is evidence that FE patients have defi cits in all 
domains, relatively few studies simultaneously addressed more than one domain 
of social cognition and typically used one test per domain. Finally, although only 
a small number of studies investigated temporal stability of those impairments, 
there is growing evidence that these impairments are stable over time.

Social Cognition Early in the Course of the Illness 
251
 SOCIAL COGNITION AND CLINICAL HIGH RISK 
OF PSYCHOSIS 
 Research in the area of social cognition and the risk of psychosis is steadily grow-
ing, although only a few studies have been completed to date. Th ere is evidence 
from studies examining emotion recognition both in faces and voices, and there 
are early studies on ToM and attributional style. 
 Affect Recognition in Clinical High Risk Patients 
 Addington and colleagues (Addington, Penn, Woods, Addington, & Perkins, 
2008) examined facial aff ect recognition and facial aff ect discrimination in a sam-
ple of 86 young people who were at CHR based on the SIPS/SOPS and compared 
their performance to individuals with a chronic course of schizophrenia, individ-
uals experiencing their fi rst episode, and healthy controls. Results demonstrated 
that, on the identifi cation task, the healthy controls performed signifi cantly better 
than the CHR and patient groups. On the discrimination task, patient groups 
performed signifi cantly more poorly than the normal controls, and the perfor-
mance of the CHR group fell between that of the patient and control groups with-
out signifi cantly diff ering from either. Th is was in contrast to an early study by 
Pinkham et al. (2007), who did not fi nd any diff erences between a CHR group 
and healthy controls on the same tasks. However, this was a very small study with 
19 subjects. 
 A recently published study by Amminger and colleagues (in press) compared 
individuals at CHR based on the CAARMS with a FE psychosis group and a 
healthy control group. Th is Austrian study used a facial aff ect task and a measure 
of aff ective prosody designed by Edwards et al. (2001). Th ey found defi cits in the 
recognition of fear and sadness across both face and voice modalities for the both 
the CHR and the FE group compared to the healthy controls. Furthermore, in 
comparison to the healthy controls, both clinical groups had a signifi cant defi cit 
for fear and sadness recognition in faces and for anger recognition in voices. In 
reviewing their results, these authors suggest that this may be a trait defi cit and 
hypothesized about amygdala involvement.  
 Social Perception and Social Knowledge in Clinical High Risk 
 Social perception is the ability to understand and appraise social roles, rules, and 
context. Th e Social Cue Recognition Test (SCRT) is one measure that has been 
used to assess social perception. Th is requires individuals to use social cues to 
make inferences about the situational events that generated the particular social 
cue or to identify interpersonal features in a given situation (Corrigan, 1997). To 
the best of our knowledge, no studies have addressed this in the CHR popula-
tion, although one study by Couture et al. (Couture, Penn, Addington, Woods, & 

252 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
Perkins 2008) used the abbreviated trustworthiness task to assess complex social 
judgments (Adolphs, Tranel, & Damasio, 1998) that could potentially be consid-
ered a measure of social perception. In this task, participants were shown 42 faces 
of unfamiliar people and were asked to imagine they had to trust the pictured 
person with their money or with their life. Th ey rated how much they would trust 
the person on a 7-point scale, ranging from -3 (very untrustworthy) to +3 (very 
trustworthy). Previous work with this task has reported diff erent biases between 
the two ends of the continuum in individuals with bilateral amygdala damage and 
in those with high-functioning autism (both groups provide more positive rat-
ings to untrustworthy faces) (Adolphs et al., 1998; Adolphs, 2001). In Couture et 
al.’s study (2008), there were no diff erences between the CHR participants (deter-
mined by the SIPS/SOPS) and healthy controls in terms of rating the trustworthy 
faces, but the CHR group rated the untrustworthy faces as more positive signifi -
cantly more oft en than did the healthy controls. 
 Theory of Mind in Clinical High Risk 
 Couture and colleagues (2008) used what is known as the “reading the mind in the 
eyes task.” Th e eyes task was designed to assess adult ToM abilities (Baron-Cohen, 
Wheelwright, Hill, Raste, & Plumb, 2001). Participants were shown a pair of eyes 
and asked to choose from among four words the one that best describes what the 
person is thinking or feeling. Th e percentage of correct responses was used as a 
summary score for this measure, consistent with previous research. In this study 
with 86 CHR participants, there were no diff erences between the CHR group and 
healthy controls. Th e eyes task was considered by the authors to be a task of ToM, 
although there is some debate as to whether this is typically a task used in this 
domain. 
 Using more typical tasks of ToM, a Korean group, Chung and colleagues 
(Chung, Kang, Shin, Yoo, & Kwon, 2008), compared the performance of CHR 
group ( n = 33) on the false-belief task (Perner & Wimmer, 1985), the strange story 
task (Happe, 1994), and a visual cartoon task (Oh et al., 2005) to that of a healthy 
control group. Th ere were signifi cant diff erences on the both the strange story 
task and the false-belief task, with the CHR group performing more poorly, but 
no  diff erences were observed on the visual cartoon task. 
 Attributional Style in Clinical High Risk 
 Attributional style is the fourth domain oft en addressed in social cognition. 
One recently developed task in this area is the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility 
Questionnaire (AIHQ; Combs, Penn, Wicher, & Waldheter, 2007). Th e AIHQ is a 
self-report questionnaire about negative outcomes that vary intentionally or acci-
dentally or with ambiguous intentions. Using this task, a second group of inves-
tigators from South Korea compared the attributions of 24 CHR participants to

Social Cognition Early in the Course of the Illness 
253
those of healthy controls ( n = 39) and FE patients ( n = 20) (An et al., 2010). Both 
the FE and CHR participants demonstrated a perceived hostility bias. In the FE 
group, this was related to persecutory symptoms. Similarly, in the CHR group, 
their attribution bias for perceiving hostility was linked to a paranoid process. 
 Multiple Domains 
 One of the issues about the prodromal studies to date is that they tended to use 
a single control group. As suggested by Green et al. (in press), a potentially more 
direct test of whether there is increasing defi cits from the prodromal phase to 
the illness phase would include separate comparison groups that demographically 
matched each of the clinical groups. In this study, the tasks selected refl ected three 
domains: the Relationships Across Domains (RAD; Sergi et al., 2009) to assess 
models or rules for interactions; the Awareness of Social Inference Test (Part II) 
(TASIT) to assess capacities to understand other minds; and the Mayer Salovey 
Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test 2.0 (MSCEIT; Mayer et al., 2004) to assess 
emotional communication. Th ree samples, each with their own carefully matched 
control group, were examined: a group of patients with a more chronic course 
of schizophrenia, an FE psychosis group, and a CHR group. Results of this study 
demonstrated impairment in schizophrenia across phase of illness. However, 
most interesting was a lack of evidence of progression or improvement over the 
three phases of the illness (i.e., from the period of high risk, to the fi rst episode, 
and then to the more chronic phase of schizophrenia). Furthermore, age had a 
limited eff ect on performance for either the clinical or comparison groups. Th is 
study supports that impairment in social cognition begins in the early phases of 
a psychotic illness and remains stable. Although it was limited to three domains, 
results were consistent across all three of them. 
 Summary 
 Th ere are, at this stage, limited studies examining social cognition in those at CHR. 
Studies in this area are increasing, although it is diffi  cult to fi nd samples, and these 
samples tend to be small. It appears as if those in this risk group are already dem-
onstrating impairments in facial aff ect recognition that is oft en equivalent to that 
observed in individuals at their fi rst episode of psychosis or even in those with a 
more chronic course of schizophrenia. Studies examining social perception and 
social knowledge are rare, and thus limited conclusions can be drawn. Th ere is some 
evidence of impairment in tasks assessing ToM. Results from the single study on 
attribution fi t with observation from patient populations that defi cits are typically 
linked to paranoid or persecutory symptoms. Th us, at this stage, there is support 
that defi cits in social cognition are already present at the prepsychotic period. 
 However, there are clear limitations to the current research. Longitudinal stud-
ies are rare, and there is no evidence on the longitudinal nature of these social

cognitive impairments in these young people. Further work needs to be done in 
examining the role of such defi cits in conversion from the CHR stage to that of 
full-blown psychosis. 
 Social cognition research has examined correlates of impairment such as symp-
toms, social functioning, and neurocognition. Th ere is evidence that social cog-
nition potentially mediates the relationship between neurocognition and poor 
functioning in both FE patients and in those with a more chronic course of schizo-
phrenia. No such relationships have yet been explored in these CHR samples. 
 SOCIAL COGNITION AND FAMILY HIGH RISK OF PSYCHOSIS 
 Given the strong evidence for the role of genetic factors in the development of 
psychotic disorders, a number of studies have examined social cognitive defi -
cits as potential markers of vulnerability to psychosis. One approach has been to 
investigate whether defi cits identifi ed in individuals with psychosis also occur in 
their unaff ected biological relatives; that is, those who are at family high risk of 
psychosis (FHR). Such an approach is particularly useful as it evades many of the 
confounding factors typically associated with patient samples, such as medica-
tion side eff ects, prominent neurocognitive defi cits, and relationships to clinical 
symptoms of the illness (Kee, Horan, Mintz, & Green, 2004). If social cogni-
tive defi cits are indeed enduring vulnerability indicators of psychosis, they are 
expected to show a substantial genetic infl uence and to occur with exceptionally 
high frequency in individuals at increased risk for schizophrenia (Nuechterlein 
et al., 1992). 
 Affect Recognition in Family High Risk Patients 
 Six studies have investigated aff ect recognition impairments in those at family 
high risk of psychosis. Th e results of these studies, however, have been somewhat 
varied (Alfi mova et al., 2009; Bolte & Poustka, 2003; Eack, Greeno et al., 2010; Kee 
et al., 2004; Leppanen et al., 2006; Loughland, Williams, & Harris, 2004). In all six 
studies, the unaff ected relatives performed signifi cantly better on tasks of aff ect 
recognition compared to their psychotic relatives. However, four studies reported 
signifi cant trends of reduced performance accuracy in unaff ected relatives com-
pared to healthy volunteers (Alfi mova et al., 2009; Eack, Greeno et al., 2010; Kee 
et al., 2004; Leppanen et al., 2006). Specifi cally, Kee and colleagues (2004) and 
Alfi mova et al. (2009) reported poorer overall performance on tests of facial aff ect 
recognition in nonpsychotic relatives compared to healthy controls. Leppanen 
et al. (2006) and Eack et al. (2010) reported only specifi c group defi cits in relation 
to negative emotions and neutral faces, respectively. Th e other two studies con-
versely reported no signifi cant diff erence in the accuracy on facial aff ect recogni-
tion tasks between unaff ected relatives and healthy volunteers (Bolte & Poustka, 
2003; Loughland et al., 2004).

Social Cognition Early in the Course of the Illness 
255
 Th e relationship of other factors, such as cognition or even the presence of 
psychotic-like experiences, to aff ect recognition in unaff ected relatives has not 
been consistently documented. Whereas one study endorsed the relationship 
between attenuated psychopathology, such as schizotypal traits (Eack, Mermon 
et al., 2010), and aff ect perception, two other studies did not report any associa-
tion (Alfi mova et al., 2009; Kee et al., 2004). Moreover, two studies that investi-
gated the association between neurocognitive performance and aff ect perception 
in unaff ected relatives reported it to be nonsignifi cant (Alfi mova et al., 2009; Eack, 
Mermon et al., 2010). 
 It is important to note that all reviewed investigations included tests of facial 
aff ect recognition, with the exception of Kee and colleagues (2004), who addition-
ally examined voice aff ect recognition. Exploring multiple aspects of aff ect recog-
nition using both visual and prosodic modalities, however, may be more eff ective 
in discerning true vulnerability indicators.  
 Social Perception and Social Knowledge in Family High Risk 
 To the best of our knowledge, only two studies to date investigated social percep-
tion and social knowledge in populations at family high risk of psychosis. In the 
fi rst study, Toomey and colleagues (Toomey, Seidman, Lyons, Faraone, & Tsuang, 
1999), investigated social perception of nonverbal cues using the Profi le of 
Nonverbal Sensitivity Test (PONS), and found that unaff ected relatives of people 
with schizophrenia demonstrated poorer test performance compared to healthy 
volunteers. In the second study, Baas et al. (Baas, van’t Wout, Aleman, & Kahn, 
2008) assessed trustworthiness evaluations about unfamiliar faces with neutral 
expressions in siblings of individuals with schizophrenia. Healthy siblings dis-
played similar, although attenuated, bias to aff ected siblings in judging trustwor-
thiness, whereby they judged faces to be more trustworthy compared to healthy 
volunteers. Future studies, however, are required to replicate these fi ndings using 
a wider battery of social perception/knowledge tests. 
 Theory of Mind in Family High Risk 
 Th eory of mind defi cits have been well documented in individuals with psychotic 
illness (Bora et al., 2009; Sprong et al., 2007), but the extent to which these defi -
cits are aggregated in unaff ected fi rst-degree relatives has not been determined. 
A limited number of studies that have investigated if impaired performance on 
ToM tests is evidenced in those at FHR and have reported confl icting results. Two 
studies found no signifi cant association between performance on ToM tests and 
having a family history for schizophrenia (Gibson, Penn, Prinstein, Perkins, & 
Belger, 2010; Kelemen et al., 2005), and two studies found a nonsignifi cant trend 
for this association (Irani et al., 2006; Marjoram et al., 2006). However, the major-
ity of studies reported this association to be signifi cant (Anselmetti et al., 2009; 

256 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
de Achaval et al., 2010; Janssen, Krabbendam, Jolles, & van Os, 2003; Kelemen 
et al., 2005; Marjoram et al., 2006; Wykes, Hamid, & Wagstaff , 2001). 
 Some studies have addressed correlates of ToM impairments in unaff ected rela-
tives of individuals with schizophrenia. Irani et al. (2006) found that relatives with 
schizotypal personality traits performed signifi cantly more poorly than relatives 
without such traits. In addition, Keleman and colleagues (2005) and Marjoram 
et al. (2006) similarly noted poorer ToM performance in relatives with past or 
present transient psychotic-like symptoms compared to symptom-free relatives. 
Some studies found an association between impairments in cognition and ToM 
in unaff ected relatives (Janssen et al., 2003), and others did not (Anselmetti et al., 
2009; de Achaval et al., 2010; Wykes, 1994). 
 Summary 
 Even though the existence of social cognitive impairments has been investigated 
in only a few studies to date, it is an important part of a larger eff ort to identify 
endophenotypes of psychotic disorders. Identifying possible vulnerability mark-
ers of psychosis among samples of individuals at FHR has implications for an 
improved understanding of schizophrenia. Based on the current research fi nd-
ings, individuals at FHR for psychosis demonstrate subtle impairments in most 
domains of social cognition. When evaluated against fi ndings from CHR studies, 
however, social cognition in FHR appears to be less impaired compared to CHR 
individuals and more impaired compared to healthy individuals without the fam-
ily risk of psychosis. Th erefore, it may be that worsening of social cognitive defi cits 
in FHR is contingent on emergence of subpsychotic symptoms and worsening in 
functioning, both of which are observed in CHR. However, little is known about 
the extent to which these attenuated defi cits are associated with the transition to 
psychosis in individuals at FHR (Eack, Mermon et al., 2010), or with other factors, 
such as neurocognition. Future studies of familial risk would benefi t from having 
a suitable design that would include FHR individuals of diverse ages and genetic 
loadings, comparison groups consisting of CHR individuals and those at diff erent 
stages of a psychotic illness, longitudinal follow-up, and broad measures of mul-
tiple domains of social cognition (Eack et al., 2010). 
 CONCLUSION 
 Several studies have demonstrated that impairments in social cognition are pres-
ent early in the course of a psychotic illness and that such impairments appear to 
be of a stable magnitude from the period of high risk until the more chronic phase 
of illness. Although all of the domains have not been examined in one study, there 
is evidence of impairment in the key domains of emotion perception, ToM, social 
perception and social knowledge, and attributional style. It is possible that this 
is early evidence of a vulnerability measure of illness, rather than an indicator

of either the severity of the illness or of chronicity. To be a vulnerability or trait 
marker, the impairments need to be manifest at all stages of the disorder, includ-
ing both acute and remitted periods. In addition, there needs to be evidence of the 
disorder in high-risk groups, such as those at FHR, those at CHR, and in those 
with schizotypy. 
 In schizotypy, some studies have supported an impairment in social cognition 
(Aguirre, Sergi, & Levy, 2008; Meyer & Shean, 2006; Phillips & Seidman, 2008) 
but other studies have not (Fernyhough, Jones, Whittle, Waterhouse, & Bentall, 
2008; Jahshan & Sergi, 2007). In the present review, there is enough evidence 
demonstrating impaired social cognition in the risk period to warrant further 
work. Understanding social cognition at this early stage has clear implications 
for a greater understanding of the development of psychosis. It is possible that 
impairment that leads to distortion in perceiving and interpreting social infor-
mation may have an impact on symptom development (Bentall, Kinderman, & 
Kaney, 1994). Attempts to understand the neural systems involved in social cog-
nition have been addressed in other chapters (Chapters 4, 5, and 11). However, 
understanding the neural underpinnings of social cognition in this period of 
risk can only help to further our understanding of the development of the illness. 
With the increased interest in the role of social risk factors in the development 
of psychosis (van Os, Rutten, & Poulton, 2008), further research, particularly 
with the CHR group, can begin to explore the nature of an association between 
social cognitive impairments and other risk factors, such as social function-
ing. It remains to be determined if the emergence of social cognitive defi cits 
precedes, coincides, or succeeds defi cits in social functioning. Given that some 
components of social cognition, such as ToM, are suggested to be critical for 
eff ective social functioning (Roncone et al., 2002), it is possible that the early 
development of defi cits in social cognition is secondary to social functioning 
defi cits. 
 Finally, there are implications for treatment. Treatment approaches are reviewed 
in detail in other chapters, and, undoubtedly, the sooner one intervenes the more 
helpful it may be. For example, if poor social cognition is related to social function-
ing, there are many advantages in off ering remediation of social cognitive defi cits 
at the fi rst episode (Eack, Mermon et al., 2010). However, treatment eff ectiveness 
studies of those at CHR are in the early stages, and there is noted improvement 
at least in some domains with psychosocial interventions. Th e impact of a social 
cognition remediation intervention at this high-risk stage may off er valuable 
insights into a range of ways to at least ameliorate the outcome.

 The Social Cognitive 
Neuroscience of Schizophrenia  
 A M Y  E .    P I N K H A M  ■ 
 Th ere has long been an interest in uncovering the brain basis of dysfunction in 
schizophrenia, and social cognition has proved no exception. Relatively soon 
aft er the initial reports of social cognitive impairment were published, researchers 
began to apply the technology and methods of neuroscience to the study of social 
cognition in schizophrenia, and, as the availability of neuroimaging facilities 
increased, so too did investigations of the neural correlates of social cognitive dys-
function. To date, a large literature has accrued, and the majority of this work has 
focused on the key domains of social cognition identifi ed in the previous chapters 
(i.e., emotion processing, theory of mind [ToM], and social cognitive bias). Th e 
current review of neuroimaging fi ndings will therefore follow a similar structure 
and will discuss the neural underpinnings of each of these domains in turn. Th is 
information will then be integrated to provide support for a social cognitive neu-
ral network that functions abnormally in individuals with schizophrenia and that 
may subserve social cognitive impairment. 
 EMOTION PROCESSING 
 Within the schizophrenia research community, emotion processing is loosely 
defi ned as the ability to perceive and use emotions (Green et al., 2008). Th e major-
ity of work in this area has focused on the perception of emotion, and, although 
this work has spanned multiple modalities including facial and vocal expressions 
of emotion, most has examined the recognition of emotion from facial displays. 
Several lesion and functional brain imaging studies have demonstrated that a 
group of neural regions are involved in face processing and emotion recognition 
(Adolphs, 2001; Allison, Puce, & McCarthy, 2000; Vuilleumier & Pourtois, 2007). 
Although these regions span the visual and temporal cortices, as well as the limbic 
system, the lateral fusiform gyrus (FG), posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS), 
and amygdala have been most consistently implicated. Both the FG and STS have 

264 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
been linked to face processing, with the FG showing the strongest activation in 
response to tasks focusing on facial identity and the STS being more strongly 
activated during tasks that focus on the changeable aspects of the face, such as 
shift s in eye gaze and mouth movements associated with emotional expression 
(Aylward et al., 2005; Chao, Martin, & Haxby, 1999; Haxby, Hoff man, & Gobbini, 
2000; Puce, Allison, Asgari, Gore, & McCarthy, 1996; Rhodes, Byatt, Michie, & 
Puce, 2004; Winston, Henson, Fine-Goulden, & Dolan, 2004). In contrast, via its 
role in directing attention to salient stimuli (Adolphs, 2010), the amygdala has 
been more specifi cally linked to emotion recognition and may be particularly 
important for processing negative emotions such as fear (Adolphs, 2002, 2010; 
Adolphs, Baron-Cohen, & Tranel, 2002; Fusar-Poli et al., 2009; Gur, Schroeder 
et al., 2002; Loughead, Gur, Elliott, & Gur, 2008; Phelps, 2004; Phillips et al., 1997; 
Vuilleumier, 2005; Whalen et al., 2004). 
 Work examining these neural regions in schizophrenia has included both struc-
tural and functional investigations, and, generally speaking, has adhered well to a 
defi cit model that would suggest that reduced volume and decreased neural acti-
vation should been seen in individuals with behavioral impairments. Although 
the majority of studies have focused on the amygdala, fi ndings pertaining to the 
FG and STS have reinforced the potential importance of these regions for under-
standing face and emotion processing impairments in schizophrenia. In regard to 
structural diff erences in FG, several studies have found decreased regional gray 
matter in the left  FG of individuals with schizophrenia as compared to healthy 
controls (McDonald et al., 2000; Paillere-Martinot et al., 2001; T. Takahashi et al., 
2006), and these fi ndings have been replicated in both chronic (Onitsuka et al., 
2003, 2006) and fi rst-episode samples (C. U. Lee et al., 2002; Witthaus et al., 2009; 
although see Pinkham et al., 2005, for failure to replicate). Abnormal functioning 
of the FG and face specifi c regions of the FG have also been extensively reported 
in schizophrenia, with reductions in activation evident during both basic identity 
processing (Quintana, Wong, Ortiz-Portillo, Marder, & Mazziotta, 2003; Walther 
et al., 2009) and emotion recognition (Habel et al., 2010; Seiferth et al., 2009; 
Williams et al., 2004). Interestingly, however, reduced FG activation during emo-
tion recognition may be specifi c to only those tasks that explicitly require the 
recognition of emotion and may not extend to tasks that are assumed to include 
the implicit processing of emotion, such as determining the gender or age of emo-
tional faces (Li, Chan, McAlonan, & Gong, 2010). 
 Reduced STS volumes are also apparent in individuals with schizophrenia 
(Cachia et al., 2008); however, there is less evidence supportive of functional 
impairments. First, among the numerous studies of facial emotion processing in 
schizophrenia, the STS has not been reported as a region showing abnormal acti-
vation (Li et al., 2010). Caution is warranted in drawing conclusions based on 
null fi ndings, particularly since many of these studies utilized a region-of-interest 
approach wherein only regions identifi ed a priori are investigated, and the STS was 
not among them; yet, it is possible that no STS diff erences exist between patients 
and controls. Second, in the earliest study to specifi cally examine STS activation 
in schizophrenia, Brunet and colleagues (2003) utilized a ToM task and found

that both patients and controls showed comparable levels of activation in this 
region. Similarly, during a task in which participants were asked to determine the 
trustworthiness of pictured individuals, patients showed normative levels of STS 
activation as compared to controls (Pinkham, Hopfi nger, Pelphrey, Piven, & Penn, 
2008). Although these studies may suggest intact STS functioning in schizophre-
nia, it is important to consider that neither of these studies used a basic face or 
emotion processing task. Th e one study that has implemented an emotion recog-
nition paradigm while focusing on the STS actually found  hyperactivation , rather 
than underactivation, in patients (Mier, Sauer et al., 2010). Th e authors note that 
this unexpected fi nding could be refl ective of greater compensatory brain activa-
tion in patients during a relatively easy task and therefore could still be indicative 
of neural impairment in basic face processing. 
 Due to its strong links to emotion processing, the amygdala has been a ready 
target for schizophrenia researchers, and a substantial body of evidence has 
accrued demonstrating both structural and functional abnormalities in patients. 
A meta-analysis of structural abnormalities published in 2000 reported a 6% vol-
ume reduction in bilateral amygdala for patients (Wright et al., 2000), and more 
recent studies have continued to fi nd bilateral reductions (Namiki et al., 2007; 
Niu et al., 2004), even among fi rst-episode individuals (Ellison-Wright, Glahn, 
Laird, Th elen, & Bullmore, 2008; Joyal et al., 2003). Despite this seeming agree-
ment among studies, a few reports have failed to fi nd diff erences between healthy 
individuals and individuals with schizophrenia (Sumich et al., 2002; Tanskanen 
et al., 2005) and suggest that volumetric reductions may not be consistent across 
symptom profi les or illness subtypes (Sumich et al., 2002). Specifi cally, Sumich 
and colleagues found smaller left  amygdala volumes in patients with paranoid 
schizophrenia as compared to patients with nonparanoid subtypes. Th us, struc-
tural abnormalities may be more nuanced than generalized volumetric reductions 
in all patients. 
 Likewise, functional abnormalities of the amygdala in schizophrenia also 
appear to be quite nuanced and complex. Initial results from investigations of 
amygdala activation during emotion processing appeared to converge on hypo-
activation in schizophrenia, as reductions were reported during sad mood induc-
tion (Schneider et al., 1998), viewing emotionally salient stimuli (Paradiso et al., 
2003; H. Takahashi et al., 2004), and assessing facial aff ect (Das et al., 2007; Fakra, 
Salgado-Pineda, Delaveau, Hariri, & Blin, 2008; Gur, McGrath et al., 2002; Habel 
et al., 2004; Hempel, Hempel, Schonknecht, Stippich, & Schroder, 2003; Johnston, 
Stojanov, Devir, & Schall, 2005; Michalopoulou et al., 2008; Phillips et al., 1999; 
Williams et al., 2004). However, as more studies were conducted, the fi ndings 
became mixed, with a few studies reporting increased amygdala responding (i.e., 
hyperactivation) during emotion recognition (Blasi et al., 2009; Fernandez-Egea 
et al., 2010; Hall et al., 2008; Holt, Kunkel et al., 2006; Kosaka et al., 2002). Possible 
explanations for these confl icting results have been a focus of recent research 
eff orts, and three conclusions can currently be drawn. 
 First, as noted in a recent meta-analysis, methodological diff erences among 
studies may contribute to the varied results. Anticevic and colleagues (2012) found 

266 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
that, across 35 studies, hypoactivation was apparent when patients and controls 
were compared on a contrast between neutral and emotional conditions but not 
when amygdala responses to only negative emotional stimuli were directly com-
pared. Th is fi nding suggests that patients and controls show comparable levels of 
amygdala activation when processing emotional stimuli but that patients actually 
show increased amygdala responses to neutral stimuli. An increased response to 
neutral stimuli would yield a small diff erence between neutral and emotional con-
ditions in patients as compared to controls that could then be misinterpreted as 
reduced amygdala activation. Th us, the nature of amygdala dysfunction in schizo-
phrenia may be more highly related to overattributing emotional signifi cance 
to neutral stimuli rather than showing aberrant responses to overtly emotional 
stimuli. Such a pattern of amygdala responding would be consistent with behav-
ioral studies demonstrating that patients tend to misattribute negative emotion 
to neutral stimuli (Holt, Titone et al., 2006; Pinkham, Brensinger, Kohler, Gur, 
& Gur, 2011) and with reports of elevated tonic (i.e., baseline) amygdala activity 
in schizophrenia (Aleman & Kahn, 2005; Fernandez-Egea et al., 2010; Hall et al., 
2008; Scheef et al., 2010; Taylor, Phan, Britton, & Liberzon, 2005). 
 Second, despite tendencies to treat individuals with schizophrenia as a homog-
enous group, amygdala functioning may diff er among patients, depending on 
symptom presentation. For example, studies that have considered patients’ 
levels of paranoid ideation at the time of study participation have consistently 
found that patients who are highly paranoid show reduced amygdala responses 
as compared to healthy controls, but that nonparanoid patients show normative 
levels of amygdala activation (Pinkham, Hopfi nger, Pelphrey et al., 2008; Russell 
et al., 2007; Williams et al., 2004). Likewise, studies that have created subgroups 
of patients based on the presence or absence of fl at aff ect have reported diff er-
ences between groups, suggesting that only patients with fl at aff ect fail to show 
amygdala activation while viewing negative pictures (Fahim et al., 2005) and that 
fl at aff ect is associated with abnormally increased amygdala responses to fearful 
expressions (Gur et al., 2007). 
 Finally, absolute levels of amygdala activation during a task may not be as 
informative as patterns of amygdala activation across diff erent stimulus catego-
ries. Specifi cally, Gur and colleagues (2007) demonstrated that, during emotion 
recognition, incorrectly identifying fearful expressions as nonfearful was associ-
ated with hyperactivation in patients as compared to controls, but that correctly 
identifying anger was associated with hypoactivation. Based on these fi ndings, 
the authors suggest that increased amygdala activation may interfere with later 
cortical, top-down processing necessary for accurate identifi cation of fear. In a 
similar investigation of the eff ect of gaze direction on recognition of threat-re-
lated facial expressions (Pinkham, Loughead et al., 2011), amygdala responses in 
patients were found to diff er from controls only for direct-gaze anger expressions. 
In all other conditions, patients were comparable to control participants, reveal-
ing that amygdala hypoactivation does not generalize to all stimulus conditions. 
Amygdala activation to direct-gaze anger expressions was also positively corre-
lated with level of functioning. Likewise, an investigation of amygdala responses

in paranoid and nonparanoid patients during judgments of trustworthiness indi-
cated that paranoid patients were distinguished by a failure to show normative 
increases in amygdala activation when a face was judged to be untrustworthy. 
No diff erences were found between groups for faces that were judged as trust-
worthy (Pinkham, Hopfi nger, Ruparel, & Penn, 2008). Such fi ndings suggest that 
impaired modulation of amygdala responding across stimulus categories may 
prove more meaningful for understanding social cognitive and social functioning 
impairments than generalized levels of activation. 
 THEORY OF MIND 
 Th eory of mind broadly refers to the ability to infer the intentions, dispositions, 
and beliefs of others (Frith, 1992). Across a variety of ToM tasks, performance 
is reliably associated with activation of a specifi c group of cortical regions, 
including the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), STS and surrounding superior 
temporal gyrus, and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) (Amodio & Frith, 2006; 
Saxe, 2006). Lateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex are also 
cited, but less consistently (Carrington & Bailey, 2009). Although the specifi c 
role of each region has not yet been fi rmly established, available evidence sug-
gests some initial conclusions. First, MPFC may perform a decoupling function 
that allows one to separate a mental representation from the objective represen-
tation of reality. MPFC is also activated during tasks requiring self-refl ection 
(Gusnard, Akbudak, Shulman, & Raichle, 2001; Ochsner et al., 2004), which 
may be related to ToM as either a causal factor (Gallese & Goldman, 1998) or 
consequence (Happe, 2003). Causally, it can be hypothesized that ToM evolved 
only aft er individuals were able to master the ability to assess their own inten-
tions and engage in self-refl ection. Alternately, a fi tness advantage for predict-
ing the actions of competitors may have prompted ToM to have evolved fi rst, 
with self-refl ection following. Second, the STS becomes implicated in ToM for 
its role in detecting biological motion (Allison et al., 2000; Pelphrey et al., 2003; 
Th ompson, Clarke, Stewart, & Puce, 2005), particularly as an individual’s move-
ments (e.g., his or her actions or changes in body posture or facial expression) 
may be informative for understanding his or her mental state. Finally, the role of 
the TPJ in ToM may be in attributing agency to others (Decety & Lamm, 2007; 
Farrer & Frith, 2002). 
 Recent neuroanatomical investigations of the frontal cortices of individuals 
with schizophrenia have been consistent in demonstrating reduced gray mat-
ter volumes in MPFC (Glahn et al., 2008; Hirao et al., 2008; Honea et al., 2008; 
Pomarol-Clotet et al., 2010). It is important to note that reduced volume does 
not necessarily imply reduced functional capacity; however, one study does sug-
gest a direct link between structural abnormalities in MPFC and impaired ToM. 
Specifi cally, Yamada and colleagues (2007) found a signifi cant association between 
reduced MPFC volumes and poorer abilities to attribute aff ective mental states to 
protagonists in social situations. 

268 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
 In line with the structural fi ndings, reduced activation in MPFC has also been 
linked to poor ToM performance. Th e earliest study examining neural activa-
tion during mental state reasoning in individuals with schizophrenia reported 
that, as compared to healthy controls, patients made more errors in mental state 
attribution and showed less activation of the middle frontal cortex (Russell et al., 
2000). More recent studies have better localized abnormalities to the MPFC and 
demonstrate reduced activity in this region across a variety of nonverbal ToM 
tasks, including both those in which patients showed behavioral impairments 
(Benedetti et al., 2009; Brunet et al., 2003; Walter et al., 2009) and those in which 
patients showed comparable performances to controls (Brune et al., 2008, 2011; 
K. H. Lee et al., 2006; Taylor et al., 2005). 
 Despite these rather consistent fi ndings, several subtleties are worthy of note. 
First, the work of Walter and colleagues (2009) suggests that the presence of 
reduced neural activation may depend on the type of intention represented in 
stimuli. In this study, the investigators included three diff erent intentionality 
conditions, two of which involved social intentions (i.e., intending to interact 
socially with another person in the future or communicating with someone in 
the present to achieve a goal) and one that included only a single person’s non-
social intention (e.g., replacing a light bulb to read a book). Reduced activation 
in MPFC was only evident during the two social intention conditions, and no 
neural diff erences were seen between patients and controls for private intentions. 
Th e authors speculate that this diff erential activation between social and nonso-
cial intentions may be due to the greater demand of decoupling posed by social 
intentions, in which is it necessary for participants to clearly distinguish between 
the intentions of others and their own. It is also possible, however, that these 
results could simply refl ect diff erences in diffi  culty between conditions and that, 
as ToM inferences become more complex, neural abnormalities also become 
more pronounced. 
 Second, furthering their conclusion that MPFC may not be uniformly under-
active in schizophrenia, Walter et al. also noted increased MPFC activation in 
patients relative to controls in response to a physical causality condition that did 
not include intentionality. Th is fi nding, which is remarkably similar to fi ndings of 
increased amygdala activation to neutral emotional stimuli, suggests that patients 
may overattribute intentional agency in some instances and supports hypotheses 
of “hyper ToM” in positive-symptom schizophrenia (Abu-Akel & Bailey, 2000; 
see also  Abu-Akel & Shamay-Tsoory , 2013, Chapter 8, this volume). Importantly, 
Walter et al. examined only individuals diagnosed with the paranoid subtype, and 
such a fi nding is consistent with behavioral reports of paranoid patients show-
ing an increased tendency to overattribute intentions to the actions of a potential 
agent (Blakemore, Sarfati, Bazin, & Decety, 2003; Montag et al., 2011). 
 Th ird, severity of illness may also infl uence neural functioning. In a longitu-
dinal study examining patients during and aft er an acute exacerbation of symp-
toms, Lee and colleagues (2006) found reduced task-related MPFC activation in 
patients relative to controls only during the acute phase. In contrast, once patients 
achieved symptomatic improvements that warranted discharge from an inpatient

facility, activation of the MPFC was signifi cantly greater and no longer diff ered 
from control participants. 
 Unlike those of MPFC, investigations of STS and TPJ functioning during ToM 
inferences have provided less consistent results. As mentioned previously, the 
earliest work examining neural responses during a ToM task reported compa-
rable activation of the STS in both patients and controls during the perception of 
human fi gures, including a condition in which characters were acting intention-
ally (Brunet et al., 2003). A more recent study that examined both structural and 
functional abnormalities, however, found increased activation of posterior supe-
rior and transverse temporal gyrus in patients relative to controls (Benedetti et al., 
2009). Interestingly, higher neural responses correlated negatively with perfor-
mance, and these same regions also showed volumetric reductions in the patient 
groups. Th us, whereas greater recruitment of neural regions may potentially be 
seen as adaptive, these fi ndings demonstrate links among overactivation, poor 
performance, and structural abnormalities that may suggest overactivation is an 
ineffi  cient means of compensating for more primary defi cits. 
 Likewise, fi ndings pertaining to TPJ functioning have been mixed, with some 
studies showing reduced activation of this region and others showing overactiva-
tion. Specifi cally, across two studies, Brune and colleagues reported both hyperac-
tivation (Brune et al., 2008) and hypoactivation (Brune et al., 2011) of TPJ during 
the same ToM task. Th e authors reconcile their fi ndings by noting that the study 
reporting hyperactivation examined patients with passivity symptoms (e.g., third-
person auditory hallucinations or delusions of control), whereas the study report-
ing hypoactivation included patients with more prominent negative symptoms. 
Th ey note that hyperactivation in the passivity group may be due to a failure to 
experience the self as an agent and a tendency of patients to perceive their own 
thoughts and actions as externally generated, which presumably would not apply 
to patients without these symptoms. Findings from Walter et al. (2009) also pro-
vide evidence for both hyper- and hypoactivation, depending on intention type. 
As with MPFC, TPJ showed reduced activation in patients relative to controls 
during social intentions but greater activation during physical causality. Despite 
the lack of clarity regarding the exact nature of functional impairments of TPJ, 
the reviewed fi ndings do indicate that this region is likely abnormal in patients, 
and that both symptom presentation and intention type should be considered in 
future investigations. 
 ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLE 
 Relatively little work has addressed the potential neural underpinnings of the 
attributional biases most commonly reported in schizophrenia. At present, no 
work has specifi cally examined the  personalizing bias —the tendency to explain 
negative outcomes as being due to the malevolent intentions of another individ-
ual rather than a situational context. Two studies, however, have investigated the 
neural processes involved in expression of a self-serving bias (i.e., taking credit 

270 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
for successful outcomes and denying responsibility for negative outcomes). Aft er 
asking fi ve healthy individuals to respond to items from the Internal, Personal, 
and Situational Attributions Questionnaire (IPSAQ; Kinderman & Bentall, 1996), 
Blackwood et al. (2000) fi rst reported that left  middle temporal gyrus (Brodmann 
area [BA] 39) and precentral gyrus (BA 6) showed greater activation for inter-
nal attributions relative to external attributions. Non–self-serving attributions 
(i.e., internal attributions for negative events vs. external attributions for positive 
events) were associated specifi cally with activation of the left  precentral gyrus, and 
self-serving attributions (i.e., internal attributions for positive events vs. external 
attributions for negative events) were linked to activation of the left  superior tem-
poral gyrus (BA 38). 
 A follow-up study with a larger sample provided partial replication of these 
results (Blackwood et al., 2003). Here, internal attributions were again accompa-
nied by activation of precentral gyrus (BA 4/6), but additional activations were 
found in left  lateral cerebellar hemisphere and right lingual gyrus (BA 17). Further, 
the contrast of external relative to internal attributions revealed specifi c activation 
of left  posterior STS, and non–self-serving attributions showed activation in right 
angular gyrus (BA 39), left  lateral orbitofrontal cortex (BA 11), and right middle 
temporal gyrus (BA 39). Self-serving attributions were this time associated with 
activation of bilateral caudate nucleus. Th e authors noted that activation of the 
regions associated with internal attributions likely refl ects the representation of 
the self as an intentional or responsible agent, with the precentral gyrus relating 
to the simulation of one’s own and others actions, the cerebellum playing a role 
in the labeling of the consequences of one’s actions as the product of one’s inten-
tions, and the lingual gyrus being responsible for the visual imagery of intentional 
actions. In regard to the STS, the authors point out that the activation seen for 
external attributions probably relates to the processing of others’ internal states 
that might accompany a personal external attribution. Finally, Blackwood and 
colleagues note that dorsal striatal activations, seen here as bilateral caudate, 
refl ect the possibility that a self-serving bias may be rewarding, particularly in 
supporting self-esteem, as proposed by Bentall, Kinderman, and Kaney (1994), 
whereas activation of the frontal cortex, seen here as lateral orbitofrontal cortex, 
may refl ect suppression of the automatic tendency to implement a self-serving 
attribution. Interestingly, the latter conclusion has since gained some support 
from an electroencephalographic (EEG) study in which non–self-serving attribu-
tions were associated with dorsomedial frontal cortex activity that was interpreted 
as a mechanism for suppressing the self-serving bias (Krusemark, Campbell, & 
Clementz, 2008). 
 Confl icting reports about the presence of a true self-serving bias in schizo-
phrenia (Bentall, Corcoran, Howard, Blackwood, & Kinderman, 2001; Garety 
& Freeman, 1999) render it somewhat diffi  cult to apply these fi ndings; however, 
recent behavioral work has been consistent in providing evidence of an external-
izing bias in patients that may be informed by the imaging work (Janssen et al., 
2006; Langdon, Corner, McLaren, Ward, & Coltheart, 2006; Langdon, Ward, & 
Coltheart, 2010). Such a bias includes making external attributions for negative

events but does not require concomitant internal attributions for positive out-
comes. Given that activation of the precentral gyrus was associated with inter-
nal attributions in both studies, it could be hypothesized that the tendency for 
individuals with schizophrenia to favor external attributions may be related to 
reduced activation of this region while attempting to explain events. Th e single 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study that has examined attribu-
tional style in patients provides tentative support for this hypothesis, as patients 
showed decreased activation of ventral premotor cortex (BA 6) as compared to 
healthy controls when attempting to infer what past event caused the current emo-
tional state of a stimulus avatar (Park et al., 2009). Th is study also noted reduced 
right inferior frontal gyrus activation in patients, which may provide a clue for 
understanding increased expression of a self-serving bias if indeed activation of 
the frontal cortex serves to suppress self-serving attributions, as noted above. 
 EMERGING MODELS OF SOCIAL COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT 
 Th e literature reviewed above provides convincing evidence of neural abnormali-
ties in social cognitive brain regions in individuals with schizophrenia; however, 
it falls short of providing a comprehensive neurobiological model of social cogni-
tive impairment. Th is is primarily due to the fact that previous work has largely 
been descriptive, and, although this is understandable given the early state of the 
fi eld, it provides only limited information about  how neural abnormalities con-
tribute to social cognitive impairment. Additionally, the tendency of this work to 
focus on one social cognitive ability, such as emotion recognition or ToM, ren-
ders it tempting to view social cognitive impairments in schizophrenia as separate 
domains subserved by abnormal functioning of discrete groups of neural regions. 
However, these groups oft en interact in concert and show reciprocal connections 
between regions (Atkinson & Adolphs, 2011; Vuilleumier & Pourtois, 2007). Th e 
neural basis of social cognition can therefore be better thought of as a cohesive 
network that more generally subserves the processing of social stimuli. Similarly, 
the fact that several of the same neural structures are implicated across social 
cognitive domains (e.g., the STS shows signifi cant activation in tasks of emotion 
perception, ToM, and attributional style; also see Mier, Lis et al., 2010; Ochsner, 
2008) further suggests the validity of network-based models and questions the 
soundness of treating ToM, emotion perception, and attributional biases as dis-
sociable natural categories. Th us, models are needed that emphasize interactions 
between brain regions and core cognitive processes. 
 An emerging model that off ers particular promise for furthering our under-
standing of social cognitive impairment in schizophrenia capitalizes on the 
dual-process (DP) framework utilized in social psychology (Chaiken & Trope, 
1999; see Lundberg, 2013, Chapter 2, this volume). As elegantly formulated by 
Lieberman (2007), instead of focusing on a specifi c domain of social cognitive 
processing, the DP model invokes core processing distinctions that span the dif-
ferent domains of social cognition by centering on the type of brain processing 

272 
d e s c ri p ti v e  and e x pe rim e nta l re se a rch
that is engaged. Both automatic versus controlled and internally focused versus 
externally focused processes have been described; however, as applied to schizo-
phrenia, the core processing distinction between automatic and controlled pro-
cessing may be particularly relevant. 
 Specifi cally, within this framework, automatic social cognitive processing is 
thought to rely on perceptual, emotional, and physiological systems and to take 
place outside the awareness and control of the individual. In contrast, controlled 
social cognitive processing relies on higher order cognitive systems and is associated 
with awareness, intention, and eff ort. As the name implies, controlled processing 
is also under the direction of the individual and can be interrupted, thus enabling 
deliberate reasoning, juxtaposition, critical evaluation, and self-correction. Both 
types of processing are also thought to be subserved by distinct neural regions. 
Automatic social cognitive processing is subserved by amygdala, lateral temporal 
cortex (LTC) (including posterior STS and the temporal poles), and ventromedial 
prefrontal cortex (vMPFC), with basal ganglia and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex 
(dACC) being less consistently implicated. Th e general roles of amygdala and LTC 
have already been reviewed, but vMPFC is associated with the experience of empa-
thy and making empathic judgments (Botvinick et al., 2005; Farrow et al., 2001; 
Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2005; Shamay-Tsoory, Tomer, Berger, & Aharon-Peretz, 
2003). Controlled social cognition, conversely, is subserved by lateral and medial 
prefrontal cortex (LPFC and MPFC) and lateral and medial parietal cortex (LPAC 
and MPAC; Ochsner & Gross, 2008). In LPFC, ventral LPFC (vLPFC) plays a role 
in inhibiting automatic responses, including suppressing the infl uence of one’s 
own experience while one is eff ortfully considering others’ mental states (Samson, 
Apperly, Kathirgamanathan, & Humphreys, 2005; Vogeley et al., 2001) and down-
regulating amygdala activity (Cunningham, Raye, & Johnson, 2004; Richeson 
et al., 2003). As noted above, MPFC is associated with the cognitive estimation of 
others’ inner states or ToM. LPAC activation, including TPJ, broadly refl ects judg-
ment of one’s own behavior and reference to one’s behavior when judging another’s 
(Lieberman, 2007). Finally, MPAC functioning is associated with self-refl ection 
(Johnson et al., 2005; Ochsner et al., 2004), self-processing (Cavanna & Trimble, 
2006), and reappraisal of negative stimuli (Ochsner et al., 2004). 
 According to the DP model, normative and effi  cient social cognition relies on 
the interaction between automatic and controlled systems; thus, integrating the 
reviewed literature with the DP model would suggest that impaired social cogni-
tion in schizophrenia is the result of aberrant automatic inputs combined with 
unusually weak controlled processing resources. As noted above, the most recent 
fi ndings demonstrate that individuals with schizophrenia show overactivation of 
automatic neurocircuitry (e.g., amygdala: Anticevic et al., 2012; Fernandez-Egea 
et al., 2010; Gur et al., 2007; STS: Mier, Sauer et al., 2010) but underactivation of 
controlled processing neurocircuitry (e.g., MPFC: Brunet-Gouet & Decety, 2006; 
vLPFC: Pinkham, Hopfi nger, Pelphrey et al., 2008; Pinkham, Hopfi nger, Ruparel 
et al., 2008). Th is interaction likely yields inaccurate automatic responses that 
remain uncorrected due to a failure to fully engage controlled processing net-
works. As a basic example, activation of the amygdala to a neutral facial expression

may result in the conclusion that someone is angry or intending harm. Reduced 
vLPFC  activation and subsequent controlled processing would preclude adjust-
ment of this initial impression for situational or contextual information (e.g., “He 
is reading a book and is not paying attention to me, so he’s likely not a threat”) 
and may lead to inappropriate social reactions, such as feeling fearful or acting in 
a hostile manner toward the stimulus individual. Th us, in this example, abnor-
mal functioning of both automatic and controlled neural networks would play a 
causal role in the social cognitive and social functioning impairments displayed 
by  individuals with schizophrenia.  
 CONCLUSION 
 As studies demonstrating a direct link between social cognition and social func-
tioning continue to emerge (for reviews, see Couture, Penn, & Roberts, 2006; Fett 
et al., 2011), the necessity of investigating the underlying mechanisms of social 
cognitive impairments becomes greater. In doing so, utilization of theoretical 
models like the DP model is imperative. Application of such models provides 
concrete, testable hypotheses for moving forward and also has implications for 
both pharmacological and behavioral remediation strategies. For example, sev-
eral pharmacological agents show promise for attenuating amygdala responses 
during emotion processing (reviewed in Pinkham, Gur, & Gur, 2007), suggesting 
that such agents may allow for intervention at the level of automatic processing. 
Similarly, recently developed social cognitive behavioral interventions such as 
Social Cognition and Interaction Training focus on teaching individuals to “check 
out” their initial impressions of a stimulus (see Combs, Torres, & Basso, 2013, 
Chapter 16, this volume), which is in eff ect an eff ort to increase the amount of 
controlled cognitive processing. Both treatment approaches should yield observ-
able changes in patterns of neural activation that would bolster theories of causal 
mechanism. Future work investigating this and related hypotheses is warranted. 
Additionally, in moving forward, it is important to note that social cognitive 
impairments are not specifi c to schizophrenia but are also prominent in other neu-
rodevelopmental disorders, such as autism. Comparative studies that attempt to 
chart the specifi city of social cognitive impairments at both behavioral and neural 
levels are also likely to contribute valuable information to remediation eff orts by 
specifying disorder-specifi c mechanisms that can be capitalized on in treatment 
(Sasson, Pinkham, Carpenter, & Belger, 2011). It is only aft er a full mechanistic 
understanding of social cognitive impairment is established that treatments are 
likely to yield optimal results.

 Introduction to Social Cognitive 
Treatment Approaches for 
Schizophrenia 
 J O A N N A  M .    F I S Z D O N  ■ 
 ROOTS OF SOCIAL COGNITIVE TREATMENT APPROACHES 
 Although social cognitive treatments are relative newcomers to the fi eld of psy-
chosocial rehabilitation for schizophrenia, their roots can be traced back to more 
established interventions, including social skills training and neurocognitive 
remediation. Shared across all three types of treatments is a focus on improving 
specifi c domains in an eff ort to improve community and social functioning in 
schizophrenia. As noted by Kern (Kern, Glynn, Horan, & Marder, 2009), they all 
represent diff erent approaches to facilitating recovery, each focusing on a diff erent 
treatment target, but with the same overarching goal. 
 Social skills training is among the most established and widely studied of psycho-
social therapies for schizophrenia (Bellack & Hersen, 1979; Heinssen, Liberman, & 
Kopelowicz, 2000; Kern et al., 2009; Kurtz, & Mueser, 2008; Liberman, 2008). Dating 
back to the 1970s, these treatments were originally developed based on social learn-
ing theory and operant conditioning techniques, and they focused on training spe-
cifi c motor behaviors related to social interactions, like eye contact, loudness and 
duration of speech, and speech content. As these treatments developed, their focus 
expanded to targeting not only the acquisition of specifi c motor skills but also social 
competence or social perception—one’s ability to know when, where, and how to 
make specifi c behavioral responses (Bellack & Hersen, 1979). In a chapter on cogni-
tive factors in the social skills of schizophrenic patients, Wallace and Boone (1984) 
note the crucial role of information processing in training social skills leading to 
successful social interactions. In a series of studies of skill training, they show the 
increasingly important role of cognitive factors such as attending, perceiving, and 
problem solving, in the successful training of more complex social skills. Social skills 
can be broadly grouped into three subsets: receiving skills, processing skills, and 
sending skills. Receiving skills focus on the processing of relevant verbal, nonverbal, 

286 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
and paralinguistic social information, including others’ aff ective states and intentions, 
as well as on social norms and expectations for the particular situation (Liberman, 
2008). Th e two other subsets of skill training—processing skills and sending skills—
also entail social cognitive abilities, as they involve subjective judgments of the eff ects 
of diff erent behavioral responses on another person and the modulation and delivery 
of such behaviors in a manner most likely to achieve the desired outcome (i.e., “how 
will the other person perceive and respond to what I do”). 
 Another predecessor of social cognitive treatments is  neurocognitive remedia-
tion . Although both neurocognitive remediation and skill training have as their 
ultimate goal improving social and community functioning, neurocognitive reme-
diation focuses on remediating neurocognitive functions, including attention, 
memory, and problem solving (Krabbendam & Aleman, 2003; Kurtz, Moberg, Gur, 
& Gur, 2001; McGurk, Twamley, Sitzer, McHugo, & Mueser, 2007; Twamley, Jeste, 
& Bellack, 2003; Wykes, & Huddy, 2009). Th is approach is supported by a grow-
ing literature showing signifi cant links between neurocognition and various aspects 
of functioning (Bowie & Harvey, 2005; Green, 1996; Green, Kern, Braff , & Mintz, 
2000). Neurocognitive remediation approaches vary considerably in terms of dura-
tion, intensity, focus of training, delivery format, and, perhaps most importantly, 
in terms of theoretical rationale, with some basing their training on a restorative, 
bottom-up, drill-and-practice model in which the initial targets are the building 
blocks of cognition, such as processing speed and sustained attention, and others 
relying on a compensatory, top-down, approach in which the focus is on developing 
general strategies (e.g., chunking, mnemonics, overrehearsal) that can be applied 
to a range of cognitive processes. Although the overall success of neurocognitive 
remediation in improving neuropsychological test performance and other proximal 
measures has been clearly demonstrated (Krabbendam & Aleman, 2003; Twamley 
et al., 2003), newer studies indicate that these treatments have minimal to (at most) 
modest eff ects on functioning unless provided in the context of more broad-based 
psychosocial treatments, including interventions like vocational rehabilitation or 
skill training (McGurk et al., 2007; McGurk & Wykes, 2008), which arguably may 
also include a social training component. Combined with recent studies suggest-
ing that social cognitive variables may mediate the eff ects of neurocognitive reme-
diation on functional outcomes and may account for unique variance in predicting 
these functional outcomes (Brekke, Kay, Lee, & Green, 2005; Brekke, Hoe, Long, & 
Green, 2007; Sergi, Rassovsky, Nuechterlein, & Green, 2006), these neurocognitive 
remediation approaches can be conceptualized as a precursor to the newly emerging 
social cognitive treatments described in subsequent chapters of this book, in which 
the focus shift s from broadly remediating information processing defi cits to reme-
diating the defi cits and biases in the processing of uniquely social information.  
 PROOF-OF-CONCEPT SOCIAL COGNITIVE STUDIES 
 Many of the current social cognitive treatments are rooted, at least in part, in 
laboratory-based proof-of-concept studies conducted in the 1990s and 2000s.

Introduction to Social Cognitive Treatment Approaches for Schizophrenia 
287
Th ese studies were oft en single-session interventions focused on remediating 
specifi c social cognitive domains, such as aff ect recognition, attributional style, or 
theory of mind (ToM). Th e key contribution of these studies has been the identi-
fi cation of separable social cognitive defi cits in schizophrenia, along with a dem-
onstration of their malleability and, in some cases, generalization and durability 
of intervention eff ects. 
 For example, in a 1995 study by Corrigan and colleagues (Corrigan, Hirschbeck, 
& Wolfe, 1995), 40 individuals with schizophrenia were shown brief videotaped 
vignettes of social situations. Compared to a single-session 60-minute training in 
vigilance only, a similar length training that incorporated semantic elaboration 
memory techniques with the vigilance training led to higher recall of social cues 
presented on both the training materials as well as on an ancillary measure of 
social cue recognition, indicating that this component of social perception can be 
improved. Th ese gains were maintained at a 2-day follow-up. 
 A number of proof-of-concept studies also indicate that aff ect recognition 
can be improved. Silver and colleagues (Silver, Goodman, Knoll, & Isakov, 2004) 
administered three 15-minute sessions of a computerized emotion training pro-
gram, originally developed for individuals with autism, to 20 hospitalized patients 
with chronic schizophrenia. Th e computerized program targeted both the recog-
nition and prediction of emotional responses, and was associated with improve-
ments on two tasks of emotion recognition, although not on a task of emotion 
diff erentiation. 
 In another single-session study of facial identifi cation training administered 
to inpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaff ective disorder, Penn and Combs 
(2000) showed that performance on a trained emotion recognition task could 
be improved through the use of either facial mimicry (prior to making emo-
tion judgments) or monetary reinforcement for correct responses, and that these 
improvements were evident at 1-week follow-up, although they did not general-
ize to a related measure of aff ect discrimination. Th is group of investigators later 
also showed that a single-session, computer-based attention shaping procedure, 
which combines computerized attentional prompts to key parts of the face (eyes, 
mouth) with monetary reinforcement for correct responses, was superior to prac-
tice or monetary reinforcement alone conditions in improving aff ect recognition 
(Combs et al., 2008). Signifi cant group diff erences were evident during training, 
at end of training, and at 1-week follow-up on the trained emotion task. Th ese 
improvements for the attention shaping group also generalized to an untrained 
aff ect recognition task administered at 1-week follow-up, with notable improve-
ments on recognition of emotions that were not part of the original training (dis-
gust, no emotion). However, support for more distal generalization was weak, 
with trend-level group diff erences (again favoring the attention shaping group) 
on an observer-rated social mixing subscale, administered 1 week aft er the end 
of training. 
 In another brief emotion training study, Russell and colleagues (Russell, Chu, & 
Phillips, 2006) examined the malleability of aff ect recognition performance in 20 
outpatients with schizophrenia and 20 healthy controls. All participants completed 

288 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
a single session of the computerized Micro-Expressions Training Tool (METT). 
Th is training consists of a pretraining assessment phase in which participants are 
asked to identify emotions in 15-millisecond video clips of faces morphing from 
neutral to an emotion and back to neutral, followed by a training phase in which 
commonly confused emotions (e.g., anger and disgust) are shown, and subtle dif-
ferences between them are explained and demonstrated. Next, participants prac-
tice labeling microexpressions and receive feedback on their performance. Finally, 
in the posttraining assessment phase, participants are presented with an alterna-
tive set of commonly confused microexpressions and asked again to correctly 
label them. Results of this brief intervention indicated that both individuals with 
schizophrenia as well as healthy controls improved on the posttraining assess-
ment, with the posttraining performance of patients comparable to pretraining 
performance of healthy controls. 
 Finally, several proof-of-concept studies also examined the modifi ability of 
ToM impairments. Sarfati and colleagues (Sarfati, Passerieux, & Hardy-Bayle, 
2000) hypothesized that some ToM impairments may be due to diffi  culty in 
separating out relevant data from other contextual information and that, by 
forcing patients to verbally process contextual information, impairments in 
ToM may be attenuated. Participants were administered a “character intention 
task” consisting of three-panel nonverbal comic strips where, in the standard 
condition, the examinee was asked to choose the correct pictorial fourth panel 
that accurately characterized the intent of the portrayed character. In a modi-
fi ed condition, the fourth panel options contained sentences describing poten-
tial intentions. On the modifi ed verbal answer format of the task, 40% of the 
schizophrenia participants normalized their performance to healthy control 
levels, suggesting that a deeper, verbal processing of information may decrease 
ToM impairments. In another test of the modifi ability of ToM impairments in 
schizophrenia, Kayser and colleagues (Kayser, Sarfati, Besche, & Hardy-Bayle, 
2006) asked eight schizophrenia patients to watch a total of 2 hours of short 
video clips portraying interactions between two or more people, then make 
attributional judgments about the portrayed characters’ intentions and mental 
states. Th e therapist provided assistance by fi rst asking the patients to provide 
an overview of the content of each video clip and, as necessary, followed up with 
specifi c questions about the likely intentions and mental states of the charac-
ters, as well as justifi cation for the chosen interpretation. Th is method of verbal 
mediation and elaboration was associated with signifi cant improvements on a 
pre–post ToM task. 
 Th ese laboratory studies of social cognitive training have a number of limita-
tions: In general, sample sizes were small, some reported only modest pre–post 
eff ects and no signifi cant diff erences when compared to control groups, some failed 
to even include control groups, many lacked blind assessors, those that included 
follow-up periods were generally brief, and none examined change on real-world 
social functioning. Nevertheless, these studies do demonstrate that social cogni-
tive impairments can be attenuated, and they serve as proof-of-concept studies for 
subsequent, more intensive intervention work in this area.

 TARGETED, COMPREHENSIVE, AND BROAD-BASED 
SOCIAL COGNITIVE TREATMENTS 
 Contemporary social cognitive interventions are oft en classifi ed as targeted, 
comprehensive, or broad-based. As their name implies, targeted social cognitive 
interventions focus on a single social cognitive domain, such as aff ect recogni-
tion or ToM. Comprehensive interventions aim to ameliorate social cognitive 
impairments in a number of domains. Finally, broad-based interventions pro-
vide training in multiple social cognitive domains in the context of broader psy-
chosocial treatment. Below is a summary of some of the better-known of these 
treatments. Cognitive Enhancement Th erapy (CET), Integrated Neurocognitive 
Th erapy (INT), Metacognitive Th erapy (MCT), and Social Cognition and 
Interaction Training (SCIT), which can also be subsumed under these catego-
ries, are separately and more thoroughly reviewed in a subsequent section of 
this chapter. 
 Targeted Treatments 
 Affect Perception 
 Th e majority of targeted social cognitive treatments have focused on improving 
aff ect recognition. One such intervention is called Training in Aff ect Recognition 
(TAR). TAR is a 6-week, 12-session, manualized treatment consisting of three seg-
ments: identifi cation of prototypical components of basic emotions, integration of 
facial elements to form quick decisions about aff ect, and application of learned 
information to the processing of nonprototypical, ambiguous facial expressions. 
Th e training relies on both compensatory and restorative techniques, includes 
both computerized stimuli and “desk work,” and relies heavily on strategies like 
verbalization and self-instruction. In a preliminary feasibility open trial of TAR, 
Frommann and colleagues (Frommann, Streit, & Wolwer, 2003) reported that 
TAR met with good adherence and led to pre–post improvements on untrained 
aff ect recognition tasks. 
 In a more rigorous examination of the effi  cacy of TAR, Wolwer and colleagues 
(Wolwer et al., 2005) randomly assigned 77 post-acute schizophrenia inpatients 
and outpatients to TAR, cognitive remediation therapy (CRT), or treatment as 
usual (TAU). CRT consisted of 12 sessions of computerized training in attention, 
memory, and executive function, as well as dyad training in cognitive strategies. 
Adherence to the full course of treatment was not as good as in the original trial, 
with 24 participants dropping out prior to treatment completion (eight from 
the TAR group, ten from CRT, and six from TAU). However, in intent-to-treat 
analyses, the authors reported signifi cant group diff erences in aff ect recognition 
and basic neurocognitive performance, with evidence of a double-dissociation—
individuals in the TAR group improved signifi cantly more than the other two 
groups on pre–post measures of aff ect recognition, whereas individuals in CRT 
improved signifi cantly more than TAU on measures of memory and learning. 

290 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
Examination of the impact of pre–post neurocognition and clinical symptoms 
on aff ect recognition performance indicated that attention and comprehension 
of social scripts (picture arrangement task) accounted for 19% of the variance 
in aff ect recognition improvement, whereas improvement in negative symptoms 
was associated with 7% of the explained variance. Because the authors included 
an active control group (CRT), they were also able to speculate that impairments 
in aff ect recognition were not simply a manifestation of a generalized cogni-
tive defi cit, since improvements on this domain were only found in the group 
receiving specifi c aff ect recognition training. In more recent evaluations, aff ect 
recognition improvements following TAR have also been replicated in a foren-
sic schizophrenia sample, with evidence of durability of improvements at 4- to 
6-week follow-up (Wolwer & Frommann, 2009), and were shown to be asso-
ciated with increased activation in occipital, parietal, and frontal brain regions 
(Habel et al., 2010).  
 Social Perception 
 Several studies have shown that defi cits in social perception can be ameliorated 
in schizophrenia. For example, Social Cognition Enhancement Training (SCET) 
(Choi & Kwon, 2006), which focuses on improving social context appraisal and 
perspective-taking abilities through practice with arranging cartoons of social sit-
uations, has been shown to lead to improvements in social perception, although 
the training did not generalize to aff ect recognition. Th e training was also rather 
intensive (35 1.5-hour sessions administered twice a week), and nearly 50% of the 
sample dropped out of the treatment before its end. Th e drop-out rate was similar 
in both the treatment and standard psychiatric rehabilitation control conditions, 
underscoring the well-known diffi  culties in psychosocial treatment engagement 
and adherence in this population. 
 Van der Gaag and colleagues (van der Gaag, Kern, van den Bosch, & Liberman, 
2002) have also evaluated the effi  cacy of a social perception combined with emo-
tion recognition training. Th is 22-session training consisted of manualized, 
individual 20-minute sessions, held twice weekly over approximately 3 months. 
Training progressed from focusing on visual, tactile, and auditory perception to 
integration of information from diff erent modalities, to attention and listening 
skills, and, fi nally, to emotion recognition. Specifi c training strategies included 
verbal mediation, use of compensatory strategies to aid in recall of information, 
training in inductive reasoning, instruction on emotion identifi cation, role-
plays, repetition, and mimicry. Although the training included remediation of 
basic cognitive skills like attention, memory, and executive function, these skills 
were conceptualized as necessary building blocks for successful social perception. 
Evaluated in a sample of 42 inpatients with schizophrenia randomized to either 
the treatment or time-matched leisure activities, the training led to improvements 
in social perception, with a 23% reduction in errors on emotion matching and a 
49% reduction in errors on emotion labeling. Th ere was also some evidence of 
improvements in executive function; however, these were only observed in with-
in-group paired t-tests.

291
 Theory of Mind 
 Th ere is also evidence that targeted training can ameliorate defi cits in ToM. 
Roncone and colleagues (Roncone et al., 2004) randomly assigned 20 inpatients 
with residual schizophrenia to Instrumental Enrichment Program (IEP) or a usual 
treatment control condition. IEP, which the authors compare to Hogarty and col-
leagues’ Cognitive Enhancement Th erapy, focuses on exposing participants to 
new situations and decreasing ToM impairments by “teaching and learning how 
to change cognitive structure by transforming a passive dependent cognitive style 
to an autonomous one” (p. 426). IEP was conducted in a single 6-month weekly 
group, which included ten patients and fi ve therapists. Compared to the control 
condition, IEP was associated with decreases in negative symptoms, improve-
ments in ToM (both fi rst- and second-order false beliefs), executive functions, 
strategic thinking, and aff ect recognition for two types of emotions—sadness and 
fear. 
 In another study of the malleability of ToM impairments, Mazza and colleagues 
(Mazza et al., 2010) compared changes in ToM performance following 12 sessions 
of Emotion and ToM Imitation Training (ETIT) or Problem Solving Skill Training 
(PST) administered to 33 outpatients with schizophrenia. ETIT is a group-based 
treatment consisting of four training phases: observing others’ eye direction, imi-
tating facial emotions, inferring others’ mental states, and making attributions 
of intentions based on observations of others’ actions. Compared to the active 
control condition, individuals randomized to ETIT evidenced improvements in 
several ToM measures, aff ect recognition, empathy, clinician-rated social func-
tioning, and positive symptoms. Improvements in memory were observed only in 
the group receiving PST. 
 Th ere is also evidence that ToM training may lead to symptom reduction. 
Lecardeur and colleagues (Lecardeur et al., 2009) pseudo-randomized 30 outpa-
tients into one of three groups: usual treatment, ToM training, and training in 
mental fl exibility. Th e ToM training consisted of education about mental state 
attributions and their relevance to social functioning, practice in the identifi ca-
tion of meaningful social information, and practice in mental state attribution 
using cartoons, comic strips, and short stories. Th e mental fl exibility training 
also included education about ToM and its relevance to social functioning, along 
with practice inhibiting initial attributions and practice applying diff erent rules 
to language and categorization exercises. Compared to the control group, both 
treatment groups showed an improvement in positive, general, and overall psy-
chiatric symptoms, with the mental fl exibility group showing somewhat greater 
improvements. Neither of the treatments appeared to impact negative symptom 
severity. Unfortunately, the assessments were limited to measures of symptoms 
and subjective cognitive function, and did not include ToM or other social cogni-
tive measures. 
 Summary 
 In summary, targeted social cognitive treatments have been developed for aff ect 
recognition specifi cally and social perception more generally, as well as for ToM, 

292 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
which included attributional style training. All of these interventions have met 
with some success, at least on proximal measures of the targeted social cognitive 
domain, with mixed evidence of generalization to nontrained cognitive skills. As 
with the proof-of-concept studies described in the preceding section, the majority 
of targeted treatments did not evaluate the durability of treatment gains, nor the 
generalization of these gains to social functioning. Moreover, it is still unknown 
whether targeting single social cognitive domains can lead to clinically meaning-
ful change, as the various social cognitive skills likely act in concert to create a 
pattern of interpersonal interactions, leading to impairments in overall social and 
community function. Nevertheless, these targeted studies provide an evaluation 
of potential methods that can (and have been) incorporated into more compre-
hensive treatments addressing a range of social cognitive functions. 
 Comprehensive Treatments 
 Comprehensive treatments targeting the full range of social cognitive impair-
ments present in schizophrenia are relatively new to the group of social cogni-
tive interventions. Th e fi rst such comprehensive social cognitive treatment, SCIT, 
developed by Roberts and Penn at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
is described in detail in a subsequent section of this chapter. A related treatment, 
called Social Cognitive Skill Training (SCST) was developed by Green, Horan, 
and colleagues at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and com-
bines and expands on elements from other social cognitive treatments including 
SCIT and TAR. Th e 12-session intervention incorporates successful components 
of traditional skills training, including identifying specifi c skills related to indi-
vidual social cognitive performance, providing gradual increases in trained task 
diffi  culty, and using practice and repetition to automate skills taught. Th e training 
is divided into two six-session phases: (1) emotion recognition and social percep-
tion, and (2) social attribution and ToM. Similar to SCIT, the attributional style 
and ToM training consists of avoiding jumping to conclusions by separating facts 
from guesses and “checking out” evidence in support of various beliefs, as well as 
applying the learned material to social situations in the patients’ own lives. Novel 
to SCST is specifi c training in nonverbal cue perception and the identifi cation of 
sarcasm and deception. Th e intervention also includes a number of new exercises 
and didactic training materials. 
 In the fi rst evaluation of the feasibility and tolerability of SCST (Horan et al., 
2009), 34 schizophrenia spectrum outpatients were recruited from a Veterans 
Administration hospital and randomly assigned to either the social cognitive skill 
training or a time- and structure-matched illness management and recovery skills 
group. Treatment adherence was good in both groups, with, on average, more than 
nine of the 12 sessions attended. Participants in both groups also reported high 
satisfaction/enjoyment and high perceived relevance to daily life for both groups.

eff ect sizes; these improvements were independent of any change in neurocogni-
tive function or clinical symptoms. Th ere were also trend-level improvements on 
measures of attributional bias and ToM. Although the results of the initial study 
are encouraging, evaluations of social cognitive domains were relatively limited 
(one measure per social cognitive domain) and did not include measures of gen-
eralization to actual social functioning. Additionally, this was a small sample of 
mostly male veterans, and the generalizability of this intervention to nonveteran 
populations has not been evaluated to date. Th e authors speculated that a longer, 
more intensive training in attributional bias and ToM may be necessary to eff ect 
clinically meaningful change in these complex components of social cognition, 
and have expanded the full intervention into a 24-session format. 
 In a subsequent evaluation of the now-expanded SCST treatment (Horan et al., 
2011), 85 individuals with psychotic disorders were randomized to receive one 
of four time-matched treatments: SCST, computerized neurocognitive remedia-
tion, a hybrid intervention that included both SCST and neurocognitive reme-
diation components, and a standard illness management skills training group. 
Assessments were expanded somewhat to include measures of functional capacity 
and emotion management, along with neurocognition and symptoms. Data were 
analyzed for 68 individuals who completed at least one follow-up assessment. 
Group attendance was good, with, on average, 19 of 24 sessions attended across all 
conditions. As with the earlier study, diff erential eff ects favoring SCST were found 
for aff ect recognition, which generalized to emotion management; however, there 
were no signifi cant between-group diff erences on measures of social perception, 
attributional bias, or ToM, nor on neurocognition or psychiatric symptoms. Th ere 
was a trend-level improvement for social skill ability in both the SCST and the 
neurocognitive remediation group. Of note, baseline performance on the attri-
butional bias measure across all groups was similar to that previously reported 
in healthy control samples, suggesting a potential ceiling eff ect. Because eff ects 
on emotion processing were specifi c to the SCST group, the authors conclude 
that this intervention has a specifi c eff ect on social cognition not observed for 
the other three treatment conditions, and they suggest that eff orts at improving 
social cognition may be successful in stand-alone social cognitive treatments that 
do not require concomitant neurocognitive remediation. Lack of SCST eff ects on 
what may be considered higher order social cognitive domains, including social 
perception and ToM, may refl ect the more complex nature of these processes, and 
the authors suggest further refi nement and expansion of treatments to adequately 
target these domains. 
 Broad-Based Treatments 
 One of the best known and most researched broad-based treatments is Integrated 
Psychological Th erapy (IPT), a manual-based, cognitive-behavioral group treat-
ment that combines cognitive remediation, social cognitive remediation, and psy-
chosocial rehabilitation. IPT consists of fi ve subprograms: cognitive diff erentiation, 

294 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
social perception, verbal communication, social skills, and interpersonal prob-
lems solving, which are generally delivered sequentially, although booster ses-
sions of the various subprograms may be administered based on patient need. 
Th is therapy has been studied in several countries, and entire books published on 
its methods and eff ectiveness (Mueller & Roder, 2010; Roder, Mueller, Brenner, & 
Spaulding, 2010), so a detailed summary of IPT research is beyond the confi nes of 
this chapter. A recent meta-analysis of the effi  cacy of IPT (Roder, Mueller, Mueser, 
& Brenner, 2006), however, indicates effi  cacy in all examined domains, includ-
ing neurocognition, psychiatric symptoms, and psychosocial functioning, with 
within-group eff ect sizes in the medium range. Th is pattern of fi ndings persists 
when only methodologically rigorous IPT studies with large samples are included, 
and it generalizes to a broad range of assessment types, settings, and treatment 
phases. Th ere is also evidence that the eff ects of IPT are maintained or even 
enhanced during an average follow-up period of over 8 months. Th e only patient 
variable found to predict success of IPT was duration of illness, with shorter ill-
ness duration associated with greater treatment effi  cacy, suggesting that this treat-
ment should be administered early in the course of illness. 
 Another well-studied comprehensive treatment with a social cognitive compo-
nent is Neurocognitive Enhancement Th erapy (NET). Developed by Bell and col-
leagues, this 6- to 12-month intervention consists of computerized neurocognitive 
remediation, along with a weekly social information processing group consisting 
of participant presentations on select topics (e.g., “A Day at Work”) along with 
constructive feedback from other group participants. Several large-scale trials of 
NET plus vocational rehabilitation, compared to vocational rehabilitation alone 
(Bell, Bryson, Greig, Corcoran, & Wexler, 2001; Bell, Fiszdon, Greig, Wexler, & 
Bryson, 2007; Bell, Zito, Greig, & Wexler, 2008; Wexler & Bell, 2005), indicate that 
it has eff ects on both proximal as well as distal outcomes, including neurocog-
nition, social cognition, and work outcomes, with lasting eff ects observed 6–12 
months following the end of the active intervention. Sustained within-, but not 
between-group diff erences have also been reported on psychiatric symptoms and 
interviewer-rated general functioning (quality of life).

 Cognitive Enhancement Therapy 
 CET is a broad-based psychosocial treatment combining neurocognitive reme-
diation and social cognitive group training. Although from the beginning CET 
has been conceptualized as a social cognitive treatment, it nevertheless includes 
a signifi cant neurocognitive training component, with neurocognition seen as a 
necessary building block for successful social behavior. As described in chapter 
14 of this volume, the focus of the social cognitive training is on providing learn-
ing exercises that lead the individual to automatic, “gistful” processing of social

information, with an emphasis placed on accurate context appraisal and appropri-
ate perspective taking (Hogarty & Flesher, 1999a,b). 
 In the fi rst published evaluation of CET (Hogarty et al., 2004), 121 chroni-
cally ill patients with schizophrenia were randomized to 2 years of CET or an ill-
ness self-management focused intervention called Enriched Supportive Th erapy 
(EST). Comprehensive assessments by nonblind raters were conducted at study 
entry, 12 months into the treatment, and at 24 months aft er intake (end of treat-
ment). Of the 121 patients randomized, only 12% terminated treatment early, and 
the 61 CET patients who remained in treatment for the 2-year duration attended 
on average over 91% of their scheduled therapy appointments, indicating good 
adherence. At the halfway point of the treatment (12 months), group diff erences 
favoring CET were observed on processing speed, neurocognition, and social 
adjustment, with trend-level improvements for social cognition and cognitive 
style. Here, cognitive style was defi ned as how patients approached social and 
instrumental tasks, and consisted of impoverishment, disorganization, and rigid-
ity. Th ere were no signifi cant group diff erences on symptoms. At the end of the 
2-year treatment, observed group diff erences remained or were enhanced, with 
large eff ect size improvements for CET on all assessed composite scores, with 
the exception of psychiatric symptoms. Most importantly perhaps, at the end of 
treatment, the groups diff ered signifi cantly on measures of social functioning and 
social adjustment, including vocational and interpersonal eff ectiveness, instru-
mental task performance, and adjustment to disability. In an eff ort to disentangle 
relevant patient variables associated with treatment effi  cacy, the authors report 
that when the sample was divided into more versus less chronic patients (those ill 
for more or less than 15 years), among more chronic patients, CET participants 
improved more than EST participants only on measures of reaction time, whereas 
for the less chronic patients, group diff erences were observed on several of the 
assessed domains, including social functioning, suggesting that CET may be par-
ticularly helpful to individuals earlier in the course of illness. 
 In a subsequent report of the durability of CET eff ects 1 year aft er the conclu-
sion of treatment (Hogarty, Greenwald, & Eack, 2006), follow-up data were avail-
able for close to 90% of the originally randomized sample. Posttreatment CET 
improvements were maintained on processing speed, cognitive style, social cogni-
tion, and social adjustment, and there was evidence that early (fi rst year) improve-
ments in processing speed mediated improvements in social cognition and social 
adjustment in the CET group. At follow-up, the two groups no longer diff ered sig-
nifi cantly on neurocognition. Th e authors speculate that this may have been due to 
participants in both groups receiving stress reduction training, and thereby being 
better able to regulate stress and perform better on the neurocognitive assessment 
measures. Perhaps of most interest is that at the follow-up assessment, group dif-
ferences were noted on several real-world outcomes, including participation in 
social, recreational, or therapeutic group activities, with 30% of the CET group 
(vs. only 9% of EST group) engaged in these types of activities. Th ere were also 
group diff erences on the proportion of patients engaged in volunteer work (27% 
for CET and 4% for EST). Th e groups did not diff er on proportions of patients 

296 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
in paid employment. Th e groups also did not diff er on relapse rates, medication 
compliance, and frequency of treatment visits. 
 More recent evaluations of CET have examined its effi  cacy in early-course 
schizophrenia (Eack et al., 2007). Eighteen individuals who had been diagnosed 
with schizophrenia within the past 8 years were randomized to CET and 20 to 
EST. Assessments of emotional intelligence (a construct overlapping consider-
ably with social cognition) were performed at study intake and 1 year into the 
treatment. Large eff ect size improvements for the CET group were reported on 
emotional intelligence, with performance approaching that of healthy control 
norms. Greatest improvements were noted for domains assessing the abilities to 
understand, manage, and use emotions to make decisions. A report on the 2-year 
eff ects of CET in the same sample (albeit now with a larger total sample size of 
58; Eack et al., 2009) indicated that CET was associated with medium eff ect size 
improvements on neurocognition and large eff ect sizes on social cognition, cog-
nitive style, social adjustment, and symptoms. In this early-course sample, CET 
was not associated with improvements in processing speed; however, the baseline 
performance of this sample was similar to the end-of-treatment performance of 
the more chronic sample evaluated in initial studies, and the authors suggest that 
this may represent a possible ceiling eff ect due to the relatively preserved process-
ing speed of early-course patients. Similar to the initial CET evaluation with more 
chronic patients, the authors also report signifi cant between-group diff erences on 
real-world outcomes, including social functioning, global adjustment, activities of 
daily living, instrumental task performance, and employment status. 
 An examination of employment outcomes in a subsample of 46 of the 58 random-
ized patients who completed the 2-year intervention (Eack, Hogarty, Greenwald, 
Hogarty, & Keshavan, 2011) indicated group diff erences for rates of competitive 
employment at end of treatment (54% for CET vs. 18% for EST), rates of part-time 
employment (29% for CET vs. 5% for EST), and weekly earnings ($208 for CET vs. 
$70 for EST), and a large diff erential eff ect size in reported satisfaction with employ-
ment, all favoring individuals in CET. An examination of potential predictors of 
CET eff ects on employment indicated that social cognitive, as well as neurocog-
nitive, improvements during the treatment predicted likelihood of employment, 
with individuals who had large (1 standard deviation) improvements in either of 
these domains three times more likely to be employed at the end of the treatment. 
An additional analysis of predictors of CET eff ects on overall functioning (Eack, 
Pogue-Geile, Greenwald, Hogarty, & Keshavan, 2011) indicated that social cog-
nitive improvements in emotion management and neurocognitive improvements 
in executive function predicted functional outcomes at the end of the treatment 
(Lewandowski, Eack, Hogarty, Greenwald, & Keshavan, 2011). 
 A further 1-year follow-up of this early-course sample (Eack, Greenwald et al., 
2010) suggested that CET-associated functional improvements were maintained. 
Specifi cally, individuals in the CET condition continued to evidence signifi cant 
diff erential eff ects on social adjustment measures, including social function-
ing, social leisure activities, major role adjustment, and overall global function-
ing. Durability of these social adjustment eff ects appeared to be mediated by

neurocognitive improvements (but not social cognitive improvements) during 
the 2-year active phase of the study. Between-group diff erences in employment 
reported at the end of the 2-year treatment were no longer signifi cant, with the 
rate of employment for the CET group remaining stable from end-of-treatment, 
and increasing during follow-up for the EST group. 
 CET has also been reported to be associated with changes in brain morphology 
(Eack, Hogarty et al., 2010). In a subsample of 53 of the 58 early-course schizo-
phrenia patients described above, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assess-
ments were conducted at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years. Comparing regional volume 
changes between the two groups at the end of treatment, CET seemed to pro-
vide a neuroprotective eff ect against gray matter loss in temporal lobe structures. 
Th is attenuated loss was reported to be a signifi cant mediator of CET eff ects on 
neurocognitive and social cognitive outcomes at the end of treatment. Although 
the authors report a lack of group diff erences in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
volumes—structures frequently associated with neurocognition—they speculate 
that the lack of group diff erences in these areas may be due to relatively better 
preserved neurocognitive functions in early course, as compared to more chronic, 
schizophrenia samples. Results of between-group diff erences in gray matter loss 
should be interpreted with caution, as the authors note that they did not correct 
for multiple inferences, and no data from healthy controls were available to serve 
as a baseline of structural development and subsequent changes over time. 
 Taken together, available research on CET indicates that it is eff ective for both 
chronic and early-course schizophrenia, with perhaps some indication that it may 
be more eff ective in early-course samples. Comprehensive evaluations of CET 
eff ects indicate treatment-associated improvements in a broad range of domains, 
including neurocognition, social cognition, and real-world functioning, with evi-
dence of some improvements 1 year into the treatment, and evidence that both 
neurocognitive and social cognitive improvements mediate the benefi ts of CET 
on real-world functional outcomes. CET-associated improvements appear dura-
ble for at least 1 year aft er the end of the active intervention. 
 As with any broad-based treatment, the specifi c eff ects of any single treatment 
component cannot be disentangled from the synergistic eff ects of combining 
neurocognitive and social cognitive training. To date, CET has only been evalu-
ated by the research group that developed this treatment, so further evaluations 
by other groups would inform us of the replicability of these fi ndings, as well as 
the feasibility of implementing this treatment in other settings. Finally, given the 
considerable length of the full intervention, there is a need to evaluate whether 
this treatment will be accepted and tolerated outside of a research setting, in com-
munity clinics. 
 Integrated Neurocognitive Therapy 
 INT is another broad-based social cognitive treatment, although a relative new-
comer to the fi eld. INT is a modifi cation and refi nement of the popular IPT, 

298 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
refocusing the treatment to specifi cally align with the National Institute of Mental 
Health (NIMH) Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in 
Schizophrenia (MATRICS)-defi ned neurocognitive and social cognitive domains 
(Roder & Mueller, 2009; Roder et al., 2010). INT includes both computerized 
exercises, as well as cognitive-behavioral group sessions and homework assign-
ments meant to promote generalization of training to real-world functioning. 
Neurocognitive training focuses on processing speed, learning and memory, exec-
utive functions, and working memory, whereas social cognitive training focuses 
on emotion perception, social perception, social schema, and attributional style. 
Sessions begin with a discussion of patients’ individual resources and how they 
can be maximized, along with psychoeducation on specifi c module topics. In 
subsequent sessions, both compensatory and restorative strategies are evaluated 
and practiced, making this treatment a combination of bottom-up and top-down 
approaches (Mueller & Roder, 2010). 
 Th e feasibility and preliminary effi  cacy of INT is currently being evaluated in an 
international, eight-site randomized trial being conducted in Germany, Austria, 
and Switzerland. To date, 169 outpatients with schizophrenia have been random-
ized to INT or TAU. Forty-fi ve hours of INT training was administered over 15 
weeks. Comprehensive assessments of neurocognition, social cognition, and 
functioning were conducted at study intake, end of the active phase, and 1-year 
from study intake (37 weeks aft er completion of active phase). Although fi nal 
study results have yet to be reported, preliminary analyses (Mueller, Schmidt, & 
Roder, 2011) indicate good treatment tolerability, with nearly 90% of random-
ized patients remaining in the treatment and attending more than 80% of INT 
sessions. Compared to TAU, INT led to improvements in neurocognition, symp-
toms, functioning, and social cognition, with some indication that treatment gains 
were maintained or even enhanced at the follow-up assessment. Th ere is also evi-
dence that social cognition and negative symptoms may mediate the relationship 
between neurocognition and functional outcomes in INT participants (Roder, 
2010). However, the empirical evaluation of INT is still at a very early phase, and 
numerous other trials will need to be conducted to assess the treatment’s feasibility, 
effi  cacy, durability, and generalizability before any conclusions can be reached.  
 Social Cognition and Interaction Training 
 SCIT is an example of a comprehensive, manualized, group-based treatment 
developed to target a full range of social cognitive defi cits present in schizophre-
nia, including aff ect recognition, attributional style, and ToM (Penn et al., 2007). 
SCIT is a combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy and social skill training 
approaches, with a focus on active social processes. Techniques used throughout 
SCIT include psychoeducation, guided problem solving, Socratic questioning, 
and discussion shaping. 
 Initial manual development for the SCIT intervention began in 2003, followed 
by small, uncontrolled inpatient feasibility trials that have recently progressed to

Introduction to Social Cognitive Treatment Approaches for Schizophrenia 
299
larger outpatient trials. In the fi rst uncontrolled inpatient feasibility trial (Penn 
et al., 2005), seven individuals with chronic psychotic illness who were also iden-
tifi ed as having diffi  culties interacting with others were referred to the study by 
state hospital treatment teams. Pre–post intervention analyses indicated signifi -
cant, medium-large eff ect size improvement in ToM, trend-level medium eff ect 
size improvements in attributional bias, and no change in aff ect recognition. Th e 
SCIT intervention then underwent modifi cation to increase the training compo-
nents focusing on emotion training. In the second inpatient trial (Combs et al., 
2007), 18 forensic inpatients self-selected to be in the SCIT group and were com-
pared to 10 inpatients enrolled in a standard coping skills group. Adherence to 
both treatments was good (96% for SCIT, 90% for coping group), although that 
may have been at least in part due to the inpatient status of the sample. Relative 
to the coping skills control group, individuals in SCIT improved on all adminis-
tered social cognitive measures, including aff ect recognition, ToM, and attribu-
tional bias. SCIT participants also improved their scores on social engagement 
and social interactions indices, although these were self-report measures and 
should be interpreted with caution. Finally, SCIT participants evidenced a decline 
in aggressive incidents on the ward, computed for the 3-month interval before the 
start of and aft er the end of the group. Th e above group diff erences remained sig-
nifi cant aft er controlling for potential change in symptomatology over the course 
of the intervention, suggesting that they likely refl ect the eff ects of the treatment, 
and not just concomitant symptom improvement. 
 Th e durability and generalizability of SCIT eff ects 6 months following the 
end of treatment was investigated in the same sample of 18 forensic inpatients 
(Combs et al., 2009). Since data were not available for the 10 inpatients from the 
original study who participated in the coping group, a new cohort of 18 nonpsy-
chiatric community controls was recruited. At follow-up, although aff ect recogni-
tion and social engagement and interactions scores signifi cantly decreased from 
end-of-treatment, they were still signifi cantly better than at baseline and, most 
importantly, not meaningfully diff erent from the scores of community controls. 
Data on generalization of eff ects at 6-month follow-up were mixed, with social 
skills performance similar to that of the community controls, but performance on 
a novel aff ect recognition measure was lower than that of the controls. 
 In the fi rst outpatient quasi-experimental trial of SCIT (Roberts & Penn, 2009), 
31 individuals with schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses were recruited from an 
outpatient psychiatry department. Although 20 of them were assigned to SCIT, 
the remainder (who either declined to be in the group, had a scheduling confl ict, 
or had participated in other studies with this research group) were assigned to 
a TAU condition. Both intent-to-treat and completer analyses were conducted. 
Fourteen of the 20 SCIT participants were categorized as completers (attended 
more than 50% of sessions with at least two from each module). SCIT group atten-
dance rate for the completers subgroup averaged 82% of the sessions, whereas for 
the entire SCIT sample it was 64%. For completer analyses, participants in SCIT 
improved signifi cantly more on aff ect recognition and social skills performance, 
with medium to large within-group eff ect sizes. Th ere was a trend-level eff ect for 

300 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
a secondary ToM measure, but no signifi cant improvement on primary measures 
of ToM nor attributional style. When the analyses were repeated for the sample 
as a whole, as may be expected, the results were attenuated, with improvements 
in social skills performance dropping to trend level. It should be noted, however, 
that this sample had a pretreatment ceiling eff ect on the primary ToM measure 
and normal-range pretreatment attributional bias scores, making it less likely that 
change on the assessment battery would occur. 
 Recently, the transportability, feasibility, and acceptability of SCIT was evalu-
ated in three outpatient rehabilitation centers providing services to individuals 
with serious and persistent mental illness (Roberts, Penn, Labate, Margolis, & 
Sterne, 2010). Th e sites were unaffi  liated with the developers of SCIT. Graduate- 
or master’s-level rehabilitation center clinicians with an average of 8 years of expe-
rience working with the study population administered the SCIT groups aft er 
having read the manual, participated in a training workshop, and consulted with 
treatment developers. Clinicians also participated in weekly supervision calls with 
treatment developers. SCIT was off ered as an adjunct to existing interventions, 
and no eff ort was made to restrict group composition, resulting in a mixed sample 
of individuals with psychotic, aff ective, and other disorders. Since no research 
staff  was available to conduct comprehensive pre–post social cognitive assess-
ments, commonly used instruments were modifi ed for group administration and 
training provided to clinicians in how to administer these measures in the context 
of the group sessions. 
 Of the 50 SCIT participants who completed baseline assessments, 38 completed 
the training (although only 34 completed posttreatment assessments), with 11 
dropping out during the fi rst three sessions. Available data from study completers 
indicate that, on average, they attended approximately 69% of the sessions. More 
than 90% reported that they found the group useful and that it helped them think 
about social situations and relate to other people. Participants who completed 
both pre- and post-assessments improved signifi cantly on aff ect recognition and 
ToM, but not on a measure of attributional bias. Clinicians administering the 
intervention reported that they found the SCIT manual helpful, and that they 
believed the treatment would aid their clients in improving social cognition and 
subsequent social interactions. At the end of the transportability trial, two of the 
three rehabilitation centers elected to continue to provide the SCIT group as part 
of standard programming, whereas the third was unable to do so due to staffi  ng 
issues. 
 Recently, the fi rst randomized controlled trial of a modifi ed SCIT intervention 
has also been published (Tas, Danaci, Cubukcuoglu & Brune, 2012). Although the 
original SCIT intervention encourages group participants to identify a “practice 
partner” with whom they can practice some of the skills learned in the group, in 
this SCIT adaptation, referred to as family-assisted SCIT (F-SCIT), a specifi c fam-
ily member or close friend was included as a social cognition practice partner. Th is 
individual received four sessions of education and training, including an overview 
of social cognition and the SCIT intervention; information about the relation-
ship among thoughts, feelings, and actions; information on how individuals learn

from observation; and information on the importance of positive reinforcement 
and realistic goals/expectations for group participants. F-SCIT was also modifi ed 
from the original by adding an individual session focusing on integration and 
transfer of learning material to everyday situations, and condensing the number 
of sessions to 14, with only three of those sessions specifi cally targeting emotion 
perception. Finally, since the study was conducted in Turkey, some of the original 
SCIT stimuli were modifi ed to better apply to this population. 
 Data from 19 individuals who participated in F-SCIT and 29 individuals ran-
domized to a “social stimulation” active control condition were very positive, 
indicating improvements on a range of proximal and distal outcomes. Signifi cant 
diff erences, with medium to large between-group eff ect sizes, were observed 
for clinician-rated social functioning, symptoms, and quality of life. Th ere were 
also medium to large between-group eff ects for several social cognitive tasks, 
including those measuring emotion perception, ToM, empathy, and reasoning. 
No signifi cant between-group diff erences were observed for social perception or 
attributional bias. Although the results of this study are probably among the most 
encouraging of the SCIT trials to date, the generalizability of the family-assisted 
modifi cation to other countries and cultures is uncertain—although the majority 
of patients in this Turkish study lived with their families and therefore likely had 
at least moderate family social support, this may not be the case in some other 
countries, including in the United States, where many individuals with chronic 
schizophrenia live alone or in supported housing and have limited contact with 
family members. 
 Th e effi  cacy of SCIT has also been evaluated in several other psychiatric 
populations. A 2008 feasibility trial (Turner-Brown, Perry, Dichter, Bodfi sh, & 
Penn, 2008) evaluated the effi  cacy of a modifi ed SCIT intervention (SCIT-A) 
in improving social cognitive impairments in adults with high-functioning 
autism. SCIT was modifi ed to emphasize distinctions between expressions of 
interest/disinterest and distinctions between relevant versus irrelevant social 
facts. Videotaped examples of social situations used throughout SCIT were 
also modifi ed to better approximate the types of social challenges encoun-
tered by adults with high-functioning autism. Of the 13 individuals initially 
referred to the study, 11 were either randomized or assigned to SCIT-A or 
usual treatment (two individuals originally randomized to SCIT-A did not 
want to participate in the group, so were reassigned to the control condition). 
Five of the six SCIT-A participants reported that they found the groups useful, 
and, in general, participants reported that they liked the focus of the groups, 
although would have liked them to have been longer and wished they had had 
more occasions to practice skills taught during groups. SCIT-A participants 
improved signifi cantly on a measure of aff ect recognition and at a trend-level 
on a questionnaire of social communication skills, although there were no 
group diff erences on actual social skills performance or ToM. Th is preliminary 
investigation suggests that SCIT-A may improve social cognitive performance 
in adults with high-functioning autism, and a larger, more rigorous evaluation 
of SCIT-A is currently under way.

tre atm e nt a pproach e s
 In a 2010 report of the effi  cacy of SCIT in individuals with schizotypal features 
(Chan et al., 2010), 40 college students with high schizotypy ratings were ran-
domly assigned to either SCIT or a no-treatment control. SCIT was again modi-
fi ed, this time so that examples of social situations were more appropriate for a 
nonpsychiatric sample of students from mainland China. Although no ratings 
of social cognition were administered, self-report ratings of general mental and 
physical health, along with social functioning, were collected at intake, end of 
treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Th ere were no pre–post diff erences on out-
come measures between groups; however, at 3-month follow-up, individuals in 
SCIT improved on self-reported somatic symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, and social 
dysfunction. Th is study suggests that SCIT may have an eff ect on general symp-
toms in individuals with schizotypy, but these results clearly need to be inter-
preted with caution, as all are based on self-report. 
 Finally, preliminary results of a just-completed controlled trial of SCIT in indi-
viduals with bipolar disorder suggest that the training may be associated with 
improvements in emotion perception in this population (Guillermo Lahera, 
 personal communication). 
 A total of fi ve studies have evaluated the effi  cacy of SCIT in schizophrenia spec-
trum, with an additional three studies examining its eff ects in other psychiatric 
populations. Overall, treatment-related gains in aff ect recognition are clear in the 
majority of studies that assessed this domain of social cognition. Eff ects on ToM 
are not as uniform across studies, and there is little indication that SCIT improves 
attributional bias, although this may at least in part be due to choice of assessment 
measures. 
 To date, there has been only one published randomized controlled trial evaluat-
ing the effi  cacy of a modifi ed SCIT intervention in schizophrenia patients, and the 
quasi-experimental studies that have been conducted have been limited by small 
samples, relatively small assessment batteries lacking real-world outcomes, and 
little evaluation of the long-term maintenance of SCIT-associated improvements. 
Initial data on the feasibility of incorporating SCIT into community settings are 
promising, but require replication, with more rigorous assessments of treatment 
fi delity and pre–post social cognitive and functional changes. 
 Metacognitive Therapy 
 Th e aim of the targeted MCT treatment is to teach participants about cognitive 
biases, their negative consequences, and their relationship to psychotic symptoms, 
and to provide corrective experiences that will weaken patients’ conviction in the 
accuracy of their sometimes faulty reasoning processes (Moritz & Woodward, 
2007b). Although similar to cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp) in 
its focus on reasoning biases, unlike CBTp, which targets conviction in individual 
delusions, MCT takes what has been referred to as a “backdoor approach” and 
instead focuses on the “metacognitive infrastructure,” or general types of reason-
ing errors that are presumed to be related to the formation and maintenance of

delusions, including attributional bias, jumping to conclusions (JTC) bias, bias 
against disconfi rmatory evidence, ToM impairments, overconfi dence in memory 
errors, and depressive cognitive patterns. Each of these biases is addressed in a 
series of eight MCT modules, off ered in an open group format. To date, MCT has 
been evaluated by a number of diff erent research groups in several countries. 
 In one of the fi rst reports on the safety, acceptance, and feasibility of MCT 
(Moritz & Woodward, 2007a), 40 outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum diag-
noses were randomly assigned to 4 weeks of twice-weekly MCT sessions or com-
puterized cognitive remediation using CogPack. Adherence to MCT was high, 
with, on average, MCT participants missing fewer than one of the eight sessions, 
although this was not statistically diff erent from adherence to the active control 
intervention. Acceptance of the treatment was signifi cantly higher for the MCT 
group, however, who rated the treatment as more fun, more likely to be recom-
mended to others, less boring, and more useful to daily life. 
 In a subsequent study, the effi  cacy of several of the MCT reasoning exercises 
was evaluated in 34 individuals with high conviction in current delusions (Ross, 
Freeman, Dunn, & Garety, 2011). Participants were randomly assigned to a single 
session of either reasoning training or an attentional control. Between-group anal-
yses indicated that, compared to controls, individuals undergoing the reasoning 
training increased the amount of data they needed in order to draw conclusions, 
suggesting an attenuation in the JTC bias. However, the overall rate of individuals 
with a JTC bias in the treatment group remained the same, indicating that aver-
age group improvement was driven by individuals who did not have a severe JTC 
bias, and suggesting that a longer, more intensive treatment may be necessary to 
successfully remediate signifi cant JTC biases. 
 Evaluations of the effi  cacy of a full eight-session course of MCT suggest that 
this more intensive treatment may in fact lead to some reductions in not only JTC 
but, in some cases, also in positive symptoms. Aghotor and colleagues (Aghotor, 
Pfueller, Moritz, Weisbrod, & Roesch-Ely, 2010) randomly assigned 30 inpatients 
with schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses and either past or current delusions to 
4 weeks of twice-weekly MCT or a newspaper discussion group. Adherence to 
MTC was high, and participants reported that they felt they were successful in 
the training and that they were willing to recommend it to others. Although the 
sample size was too small to obtain statistically signifi cant group diff erences, 
MCT was associated with medium between-group eff ect sizes on positive symp-
toms and small eff ects sizes on JTC bias. In another evaluation of the effi  cacy of 
eight sessions of MCT in improving positive symptoms, Kumar and colleagues 
(Kumar et al., 2010) randomly assigned 16 recently admitted inpatients to MCT 
or TAU. As can be expected when newly admitted patients are stabilized, both 
groups improved somewhat on assessed measures. Between-group analyses were 
underpowered to detect signifi cant interactions; however, medium to large eff ect 
size diff erences were noted for improvement in positive symptoms and belief con-
viction, favoring the MCT group, and the degree of positive symptom reduction 
in the MCT group (28%) was more than twice that in the TAU group (12.9%). 
In a related study, Moritz Kerstan and colleagues (Moritz et al., 2011) examined 

304 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
MCT effi  cacy in a sample of 36 stabilized although chronic patients (about half 
of whom met remission criteria). As can be expected from such a low symptom 
sample, there were no changes in symptomatology over the course of the interven-
tion. Compared to a wait-list control, participants randomized to MCT improved 
signifi cantly in delusional distress, memory, and quality of social relationships. 
Although not statistically signifi cant, there was also a medium within-group eff ect 
size improvement in JTC bias for the MCT group. 
 Th ere are also several anecdotal or unpublished reports evaluating MCT. Th ese 
reports suggest that the treatment does in fact lead participants to become more 
aware of their reasoning biases, reduce their tendency to jump to conclusions, and 
increase the likelihood of considering alternative hypotheses (Gaweda, Moritz, & 
Kokoszka, 2009). Th ey also suggest that even a single session of MCT can lead to 
reductions in JTC, paranoid thoughts, and delusional conviction, and improve the 
quality of social life (Moritz et al., 2011; Moritz & Woodward, 2007b). 
 Based on clinical experience with patients who deny the presence of even 
objectively measured cognitive biases, the authors of MCT recently devel-
oped an individualized metacognitive training program for individuals with 
psychosis (MCT+) that focuses on the same reasoning biases as addressed in 
the original MCT, but tailors content to specifi c individuals and adds a ses-
sion on relapse prevention. A combination of MCT followed by MCT+ was 
recently compared to eight sessions of computerized cognitive training (Moritz, 
Veckenstedt, Randjbar, Vitzthum, & Woodward, 2011) in a sample of 48 inpa-
tients with schizophrenia spectrum who were randomly assigned to one of the 
treatments. Compared to the active control, MCT/MCT+ participants rated the 
training more favorably, and indicated that they found it important and useful, 
and that they were more likely to apply it in everyday life. Signifi cant group 
diff erences were reported for delusions, positive symptoms, and delusional con-
viction. Th ere was also indication that, compared to the active control group, 
individuals in MCT/MCT+ signifi cantly decreased in JTC bias. Eff ect sizes were 
in the medium range. 
 In summary, MCT has been evaluated in a number of diff erent countries, 
although with mostly inpatient populations. It appears that although single-
session administrations of select training materials are associated with some 
increase in data gathering and a reduction of the JTC bias, these improvements 
are strengthened when a full course of MCT is administered. Th ere is also evi-
dence that MCT is associated with decreases in delusional conviction and positive 
symptoms. Although encouraging, most of the published reports included small 
participant samples, and whereas medium eff ect size diff erences were reported 
for many of the assessed domains, these diff erences oft en failed to reach statistical 
signifi cance. Future randomized trials of MCT will need to evaluate this treat-
ment in larger, outpatient samples, in the context of a time-matched active con-
trol. Additional studies are also necessary to evaluate the generalizability of MCT 
to multiple social functioning measures, as well as the durability of treatment 
gains. Finally, mediator and moderator analyses will help us better understand 
MCT’s mechanisms of action.

 CONCLUSION 
 In the past two decades, much work has been done on the development of 
social cognitive interventions for individuals with psychosis. Although early 
proof-of-concept studies showed that social cognitive defi cits in psychosis are 
malleable, more intensive treatments have attempted to address the full range of 
social cognitive defi cits, as well as determine whether their improvement does in 
fact lead to better social functioning. Overall, a review of existing studies suggests 
that various domains of social cognition can be improved, and that these improve-
ments may generalize to more distal outcomes. Th is is in part consistent with 
a recent meta-analysis of the effi  cacy of controlled social cognitive treatments, 
which indicates medium to large eff ect sizes on aff ect perception and small to 
medium eff ect sizes on ToM, but no signifi cant eff ects on the handful of evaluated 
studies that targeted social perception and attributional bias (Kurtz & Richardson, 
2011). Although this work is encouraging, much more remains to be done. 
 Of the treatments reviewed here, IPT has the largest and most rigorous evidence 
base supporting its effi  cacy. Many of the studies evaluating the other treatments 
were poorly controlled, had small samples, used brief and narrow assessment bat-
teries, did not include measures of social functioning, and did not examine the 
durability of training eff ects. Assuming that the early positive results from these 
studies can be replicated in larger, more comprehensive and rigorous trials (per-
formed by researchers unaffi  liated with the developers of the treatments), many 
of these treatments may also require signifi cant alteration to make their delivery 
feasible and acceptable in community treatment settings. 
 Additionally, although the majority of studies that target aff ect recognition have 
met with at least some success, there is much less of a research base to indicate 
that the relatively few existing treatments targeting “higher order” components 
of social cognition, including social perception, attributional style, and ToM, 
are effi  cacious. Future researchers will need to focus their eff orts on modifying 
existing or developing new interventions to eff ectively target these arguably more 
complex components of social cognition. Potential treatment paradigms can be 
adapted from laboratory studies conducted outside the fi eld of schizophrenia 
research. For example, Mathews and colleagues (Grey & Mathews 2000; Mathews 
& Mackintosh, 2000; Yiend, Mackintosh, & Mathews, 2005) have shown that 
negative interpretive biases can be experimentally induced in healthy controls. 
Th ese types of experimental manipulations can be used to inform the design of 
complementary interventions aimed at reducing attributional biases in individu-
als with psychosis. 
 Th ere is great heterogeneity in the treatments examined so far, and, to date, 
their mechanisms of action are poorly understood. In addition to disentangling 
the active ingredients of these treatments, future researchers will also need to 
determine the most appropriate and effi  cacious methods for the delivery of these 
treatments. Moreover, there is evidence that variables such as duration of illness, 
age, education, and inpatient versus outpatient status may mediate the effi  cacy of 
social cognitive treatments (Kurtz & Richardson, 2011), so these and other patient 

306 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
and treatment characteristics will need to be carefully assessed and examined in 
future evaluations of social cognitive treatments and their effi  cacy in order to best 
match treatments to individuals. 
 Finally, as noted by several other researchers (Green et al., 2008; Horan, Kern, 
Green, & Penn, 2008; Horan et al., 2011; Kurtz & Richardson, 2011), much more 
emphasis needs to be placed on the outcome measures used in treatment evalua-
tion studies. Many of the measures employed have had unknown or questionable 
psychometric properties, and, in numerous cases, only a single measure was used 
as a proxy for each social cognitive domain. A more in-depth analysis of the psy-
chometric properties of the various social cognitive measures and their appropri-
ateness for clinical trials with psychosis may reveal that it is not only the specifi c 
treatment, but how its effi  cacy is assessed, that requires modifi cation.

 Integrated Neurocognitive Th erapy (INT) for schizophrenia patients represents a 
further development of Integrated Psychological Th erapy (IPT). INT is a compre-
hensive, integrated, and “broad-based” therapy approach. Its intervention techniques 
and therapeutic tools were adopted from IPT and were further developed. Th erefore, 
in order to understand the INT intervention, knowledge about IPT is needed. Th irty 
years ago, IPT was one of the very fi rst comprehensive and manual-driven group 
therapy approaches for schizophrenia patients. During the last 30 years, it has been 
established as a standard approach in many countries, especially in Europe. IPT is 
a “bottom-up” and “top-down” approach, addressing both basic cognitive building 
blocks and higher order integrative processing. It consists of fi ve subprograms, each 
with incremental steps. IPT starts with a subprogram addressing the neurocognitive 
domain, followed by a second subprogram to enhance social cognition. In a third 
stage, IPT focuses on interpersonal and social context using verbal communication 
tools, thereby bridging the gap between cognitive and social functioning. Finally, 
social competence is targeted with exercises to improve social skills (fourth sub-
program) and to increase patients’ mastery in coping with interpersonal and social 
problems (fi ft h subprogram) for more independent living. 
 Th e sixth, revised edition of the German IPT manual (Roder, Brenner, & 
Kienzle, 2008a) is now available, as well as a new, fully updated edition in English 
(Roder, Mueller, Spaulding, & Brenner, 2010). Th e manual has been translated 
into 12 languages, and IPT has been extensively researched. Th irty-six indepen-
dent evaluation studies have been conducted in 12 countries in Europe, North and 
South America, and Asia. Th e data from these studies were recently summarized 
in a meta-analysis (Roder, Mueller, Mueser, & Brenner, 2006; Roder, Mueller, & 
Schmidt, 2011; Mueller & Roder, 2008). Th e results were promising for the proxi-
mal outcomes of neurocognition, social cognition, and psychosocial functioning, 
as well as for the more distal outcome of symptoms aft er therapy. Th ese eff ects 
were maintained at follow-up. Using the complete IPT with all fi ve subprograms 
generated stronger and longer lasting eff ects than did single subprograms, even 
aft er having controlled for therapy duration.

 What We Have Learned from IPT 
 IPT represents a complete therapy program integrating interventions for many of 
the key rehabilitation goals of schizophrenia patients. In our opinion, the thera-
peutic success of IPT is based on the following conceptual and therapeutic strate-
gies and techniques:
 
1. IPT is a group therapy approach and therefore strongly supports group 
processes during treatment . Th is seems to be an important requirement 
for social skills training within a behavioral therapy approach. However, 
group therapy has been rarely practiced in cognitive remediation therapy.  
 
2. IPT fi rst targets neurocognition and social cognition before social and 
interpersonal skills are practiced . Th e improvement of cognitive skills 
during the initial IPT subprograms reduces the rate-limiting impact of 
basic and social cognition within social skills therapy. 
 
3. IPT starts with simple exercises, which are clearly structured and thereby 
allow the patients to become familiar with the social context of the group . 
Th is may be one reason why patients with negative symptoms especially 
benefi t from the initial exercises on neurocognition. 
 
4. Th e IPT exercises are highly structured and progress sequentially in 
incremental steps, beginning with simple and emotionally neutral tasks 
and ending with complex and partially emotionally loaded tasks . Th is 
didactic structure gives therapists greater fl exibility in choosing an 
adequate level of diffi  culty in accordance with each patient’s individual 
capacity and needs. 
 Evolution of IPT 
 During the last decade, a number of advances have been made in intervention 
technology and therapy topics associated with an improved understanding of 
functioning in schizophrenia. To take these advances into account, the IPT con-
cept was expanded and modifi ed in our laboratory in Bern, Switzerland. In two 
research projects supported by the Swiss National Foundation (SNF), our research 
group developed and evaluated two new therapy approaches for schizophrenia 
patients:
 Th ree cognitive social skills programs addressing residential, vocational, 
• 
and recreational topics (WAF;  [ German abbreviation for  Wohnen, Arbeit, 
Freizeit ] ; SNF-Grant No: 32–45577.95, Roder et al., 1996–2001). Th e three 
WAF programs (Mueller & Roder, 2005; Roder et al., 2002, 2006b, 2008b) 
address specifi c functional areas of patients’ daily living.

 Treatment Targets of INT 
 INT represents an extension of the two cognitive subprograms of IPT. 
Following IPT, the primary aim of the development of INT was to integrate 
neurocognitive and social cognitive exercises using group processes as thera-
peutic tools. The treatment targets strongly correspond with the definitions of 
the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Measurement and Treatment 
Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) initiative 
(Green & Nuechterlein, 2004; Green, Oliver, Crawley, Penn, & Silverstein, 
2005; Nuechterlein et al., 2004). Following the recommendations of this task 
force, six neurocognitive domains (speed of processing, attention/vigilance, 
verbal and visual learning and memory, reasoning and problem solving, and 
working memory) and five social cognitive domains (emotional processing, 
social perception, theory of mind [ToM], social schema, and attribution style) 
were operationalized for therapeutic intervention. The primary treatment 
goal of INT is to improve functioning in these neurocognitive and social cog-
nitive domains. The secondary treatment goal is to transfer improved cogni-
tive skills into daily living to minimize the impact of cognitive deficits on 
the acquisition and use of social and interpersonal skills. Requirements to 
realize this goal seem to be to improve patients’ willingness for change by 
increased intrinsic motivation, to enhance patients’ insight into their cogni-
tive functioning by improving a realistic self-estimation of their own cognitive 
resources and deficits, and to reduce fear of failure. This should pave the way 
for improvement in social functioning and possibly for a reduction in nega-
tive symptoms (e.g., anhedonia), which could be maintained after the end of 
treatment.  
 THEORETICAL BASIS FOR THE INTERVENTION 
 Treatment Concept of INT 
 Following IPT (Roder et al., 2010), the concept of INT is based on an inte-
grated model of functioning. This model was originally postulated by Green 
and Nuechterlein (1999) and confirmed by recent empirical data. It has been 
extended by our research group (Figure 13.1). It suggests that functional 
outcome (“coping with life successfully”) is determined by a multiplicity of 
organismic factors, including neurocognitive and social cognitive domains 
described by the MATRICS initiative, as well as by positive and negative 
symptoms. All of them interact with recovery-oriented variables like a per-
son’s orientation to treatment, which includes such psychological factors as 
(a) a patient’s knowledge and insight into his or her own functioning, (b) 
intrinsic motivation for therapeutic change, and (c) self-efficacy expectancies 
in patients’ daily living.

 Therapy Rationale of INT 
 Based on the broad clinical experience and research on IPT, INT includes the fol-
lowing main intervention techniques and rationales:
   INT interventions take place in a group setting. A team of a therapist 
1. 
and a co-therapist support group processes, using them as a therapeutic 
tool. Two-thirds of the therapy sessions are held in a standard 
cognitive-behavioral group therapy setting and one-third use PC-based 
exercises. However, group interactions are not restricted to the social 
cognitive part of INT, as they are important for the generation of 
compensation strategies for addressing neurocognitive defi cits in 
computerized exercises that allows patients to experience self-effi  cacy in 
a social context. 
 Every intervention addressing one of the various cognitive domains 
2. 
includes an introduction in which education in the respective cognitive 
domain is given. Teaching patients about cognitive functions and their 
relevance in real-life situations within a vulnerability-stress-coping 
framework of schizophrenia enhances patients’ insight into the role of 
cognitive capacity. It also improves patients’ knowledge about their own 
cognitive functioning and the eff ects of illness on cognition in general.

  INT combines bottom-up drill and practice exercises with top-down 
3. 
learning of compensation strategies. Over the course of therapy, the 
main focus shift s from restitution to strategy learning. 
 Like in IPT, the incremental steps of INT are built sequentially. Th ey 
4. 
always begin with simple, low-level, and not emotionally loaded tasks, 
following errorless learning principles. 
 A main goal of INT is to closely link the patient’s daily living context 
5. 
to his or her cognitive functioning. Patients’ own experiences with 
their cognitive functioning in the real world and the successful or 
unsuccessful use of strategies to cope with individual daily life demands 
are taken into consideration in every part of INT. Th is therapeutic 
approach should support the generalization of the acquired cognitive 
skills and their transfer to daily functioning. 
 Th is leads to a further goal of INT: generating an individual profi le of 
6. 
resources and defi cits in cognitive functioning across the addressed 
cognitive domains. It is particularly important to identify the cognitive 
resources of each patient during the therapy process as this helps to 
overcome the avoidance of cognitively demanding (social) situations 
oft en shown by schizophrenia patients. Additionally, it supports patients’ 
more realistic judgment of their individual cognitive skills. 
  INT focuses on patients’ intrinsic motivation during every step 
7. 
of treatment. Th is is accomplished by allowing patients to choose 
their degree of active participation in the group exercises and by 
modulating the level of diffi  culty, following errorless learning principles. 
Additionally, didactics are designed to emphasize the importance of each 
cognitive domain for real-life functioning. 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERVENTION 
 How to Implement INT 
 INT includes a broad scope of interventions in neurocognitive and social cogni-
tive domains, allowing the therapists to compose exercises according to the par-
ticipants’ needs. In a recently fi nished international evaluation study of INT, a 
total of 30 sessions were administered. Sessions took place biweekly, and each 
lasted 90 minutes, including a short break. Th e clinical experience clearly demon-
strated that a longer lasting therapy could show more improvements. Th erefore, 
we would recommend 50 sessions twice a week for clinical implementation. 
 A team of one primary therapist and one or two co-therapists lead a group of 
six to eight patients. At least the primary therapist should be well trained in cog-
nitive-behavioral therapy techniques and should be familiar with group processes 
in groups with schizophrenia patients. In Europe, we are additionally off ering 
INT training workshops in several languages for therapists. Th e main role of the 

316 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
primary therapist is to structure the group sessions and to support and encour-
age the group members by using positive reinforcement and strongly focusing 
on patients’ resources. Th e function of the co-therapist(s) is formally equal to the 
patients’ role. Th e co-therapist serves as a model for the patients and facilitates 
group processes to support and encourage weaker patients. 
 Infrastructural Needs 
 Before INT can be implemented in a clinical setting, some infrastructural needs 
have to be organized. Since INT includes computer-based exercises, therapy 
procedure requires a computer room in addition to the standard group inter-
vention room (Figure 13.2). Each of the two rooms should provide standard 
equipment (therapists’ PC, projector, fl ipchart). During a therapy session of 
90  minutes, divided by a short break, PC-based exercises are limited to 30–45 
minutes. Th erefore, patients and therapists should be able to switch easily from 
the equipped PC-room to the group intervention room during each session. If 
an agency does not have suffi  cient resources to off er two rooms, the computers 
can be placed in the standard group room as well. However, the therapist has to 
make sure that there is enough space for group exercises, like role-plays. Laptops 
are also a good alternative. In our evaluation study, the CogPack computer pro-
gram distributed by Marker Soft ware was used. Th e integration of other computer 
 programs in English seems possible. 
 Four Modules of INT 
 Th e bottom-up and top-down approaches of INT consists of four therapy modules. 
Each is separated into a neurocognitive and a social cognitive subpart, always start-
ing with the neurocognitive part. Although INT is designed in incremental steps,

the content of former modules is repeated in later ones. For example, the emotion 
perception content of the fi rst module is highly relevant for the attribution style 
of the last module, in which it is therefore repeated. A schematic presentation of 
INT is given in Figure 13.3. Although the fi rst module (“A”) includes tasks on basic 
neurocognitive functions, such as speed of processing and attention, which are 
treated by low-complexity interventions, the last two modules addressing execu-
tive functioning are cognitively more demanding. Besides this increase of com-
plexity during treatment in the neurocognitive part, the emotional strain of the 
focused therapy topics increases in each successive module’s social cognitive part, 
with attribution style and emotion regulation in the last module imposing the most 
demands on the participants. In the cross-sectional structure of each module, the 
emotional salience and the personal relevance is higher in the social cognitive part 
compared to the neurocognitive part due to the closer association of social cogni-
tion to social functioning. However, as stated above, the link to the daily living 
context is established in every neuro- and social cognitive intervention of INT.  
 Didactic Therapy Components and Therapy Materials of the Modules 
 It is important to keep in mind that INT uses group processes as a therapeutic tool. 
INT also follows cognitive-behavioral therapy principles in analyzing problems 
and working on solutions, such as coping techniques. Against this background, 
each INT module consists of  introduction sessions followed by  consecutive ses-
sions, and each module uses its own set of intervention materials (Table 13.1). 
 INT starts with an introductory session at the beginning of every neurocog-
nitive and social cognitive part of the four modules. Th e primary intervention 
technique of these introductory sessions is based on educational tools to support

patients’ understanding of the focused cognitive domain and its relevance in 
individual daily life situations. Bridging the gap between the experiences patients 
have during therapy and their real-world daily living context requires establishing 
the patients’ awareness of their own resources. In addition, it requires enhancing 
insight into illness-specifi c defi cits in the focused cognitive functions and their 
corresponding limitations in coping with daily problems. For this purpose, three 
kinds of psychoeducation materials are used during introduction sessions:
 
• Prototypical case vignettes (written short stories) designed for each 
cognitive domain. In these stories, the same fi ctional character has 
successful or unsuccessful experiences based on specifi c cognitive 
resources or defi cits. Th e introduction of a theme through the use of these 
short stories gives patients an initial opportunity to discuss cognitive 
functioning without relation to their own oft en stressful, emotionally 
loaded experiences. In a second step, the patients are asked whether they 
have had experiences in daily life similar to the content of the stories. 
 
• Worksheets to let patients document their individual experiences with 
diffi  culties in the respective cognitive domain during real-life daily living 
situations and to refl ect on successful or unsuccessful coping strategies they 
have used to handle such situations. 
 
• Information sheets to teach patients about cognitive functioning and its 
relevance for daily life in the focused cognitive domain, or to summarize 
coping strategies. 
 In consecutive sessions in each INT module, individual coping strategies are 
elaborated in the group setting. To take advantage of implicit learning in a social

context, compared to lab-based drill and practice, patients have the opportunity 
to try out new coping strategies in the group (e.g., role plays). Th ey compensate for 
cognitive defi cits and optimize their individual resources for managing demands 
of daily life associated with cognitive functioning. 
 Combined with this strategy-learning approach, INT includes rehearsal-based 
training sessions. A broad range of materials is used in these sessions, includ-
ing computerized exercises, standardized written cards, and stimulus pictures. In 
this approach, much of the work remains group-based, using group processes and 
interactions to activate patients and to simulate real-life situations. Even during 
computer sessions, therapists largely support group processes. For example, ther-
apists ask patients to debate and discuss their solution and to articulate possible 
strategies in team competition. 
 Finally, in vivo exercises and homework assignments are used to promote 
transfer of the learned cognitive skills into practice, to support generalization of 
the eff ects to other functions, and to maintain the eff ects aft er therapy. Again, 
worksheets are used to document patients’ experience outside of therapy. 
 Module A 
 INT starts with an introduction to the basic neurocognitive domains of speed 
of processing and attention, coupled with the social cognitive domain of emo-
tion perception. In the beginning, the INT procedure is very structured and the 
co-therapist models each new exercise. Th e fi rst exercises are simple, easy to 
 handle, and are not aff ected by emotional strain. 
 Neurocognitive Part: Speed of Processing 
 Introduction session : Aft er a short overview of the contents of INT, 
information-processing models and information sheets are used to educate 
patients regarding the impact of cognitive functioning on daily living. In this con-
text, patients are asked for the fi rst time about their own perceived resources and 
defi cits in general cognitive functioning and especially in the targeted domains. 
To individualize the information, a worksheet including a very brief question-
naire (1 = this is a defi cit; 5 = this is a resource) is used to generate a patient’s 
personal cognitive profi le. 
 Speed of processing : Aft er the introduction phase, simple PC-based exercises are 
introduced for three reasons: to reduce schizophrenia patients’ fear of the social 
group context and of negative expectancies through well-structured, goal-oriented 
exercises free of social and emotional strain; to give them confi dence to be able 
to handle the computer; and to identify patients’ individual profi le of function-
ing in the targeted cognitive domain by comparing their performance in the 
PC-exercises with their personal estimation of their own resources and defi -
cits. Th e level of diffi  culty in the PC exercises is augmented following errorless 
learning principles. Additionally, behavioral therapy techniques, such as positive 
reinforcement and positive connotation, are implemented to support patients’ 
motivation and self-expectancies. Aft erward, patients’ experiences during the PC 
exercises are discussed in the group context. Th is didactic tool can be used in all of 

320 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
the following neurocognitive intervention parts of INT, but it will not be explicitly 
described in the text. 
 Compensation sessions : In this phase of treatment, a strong focus is given to the 
identifi cation of patients’ individual resources and defi cits in speed of processing. 
Th e relevance of speed of processing in daily living situations is summarized for 
each participant. Th en, patients learn coping strategies to compensate for defi cits 
and to optimize resources by the didactic use of information sheets and work-
sheets. Information sheets summarize the knowledge about the function of speed 
of processing in information processes and behavior. Th e worksheets individual-
ize the information by asking patients whether they have any experience in deal-
ing with such problems in work, leisure time activities, or at home. Examples of 
successful strategies are drinking a cup of coff ee, and using self-instructions and 
self-reinforcement (“I know that I am able to master this task. Aft erward I will 
enjoy a break”). All strategies are summarized fi rst, before their probability of 
success is discussed in the group. 
 Restitution sessions : Th e learned compensation strategies are rehearsed in 
repeated PC exercises, such as reaction time tasks. Patients are encouraged to apply 
their own compensation strategies to the task. Th erefore, the chosen strategies 
may diff er among patients, but are practiced extensively using diff erent exercises. 
For example, one patient may fi nd self-instructions helpful to avoid distractions, 
whereas another patient prefers time management, including breaks. 
 Neurocognitive Part: Attention/Vigilance 
 Introduction session : A brief introduction phase complements the initial intro-
ductory sessions at the beginning of the module. To introduce the new theme, 
the relationship between speed and attention is discussed. Th ereby, alertness and 
vigilance are addressed separately. Both are introduced by reading prototypical 
short stories in the group. An excerpt of a case vignette is given in Figure 13.4. 
Case vignettes focus on resources and successful coping, as well as on defi cits and 
problems. 
 Compensation sessions : Patients’ individual experience with (un)successful 
coping strategies in daily living situations demanding alertness and vigilance are 
summarized using worksheets (Figure 13.5). 
 Participants receive information about alternative coping strategies, which are 
individualized in specifi c situations (e.g., work, at home, leisure time, interper-
sonal situations). For example, patients learn to take a short rest during work 
and to focus awareness on the experience of neutral objects in the environment 
in order to draw attention from stressful thoughts. Finally, the individually cho-
sen strategies are practiced in the group context. For example, patients learn that 
attention (and speed of processing) is strongly aff ected by one’s state of mood and 
level of interest. Here, card-sorting exercises are introduced, which require inte-
gration of emotional expression and attention to verbal stimuli. 
 Restitution sessions : PC-based exercises addressing attention to simulated 
tasks, as well as to the already described card sorting exercises, are repeatedly 
practiced.

 In-vivo exercises and homework assignments : To promote the transfer of the 
learned skills into daily life and to support generalization to other areas of 
functioning, patients are encouraged to practice new compensation strategies 
in daily life. Individual goals prior to the exercise, as well as diffi  culties and 
level of success, are documented using worksheets. Th ese documents support 
patients’ input to the discussion in the following group session of each indi-
vidual experience with coping exercises in the real-life, daily living context. 
In vivo exercises and homework assignments are implemented in each part 
of the four modules, but they will not be explicitly discussed in the following 
sections.  
 Social Cognitive Part: Emotion Perception 
 Introduction session : Th is topic has already been introduced in the neurocogni-
tive part of Module A using the above described card sorting exercise. Th is is 
an example of the integration of neurocognitive and social cognitive interven-
tion in INT. Patients are introduced to the discussion of perceptual processes 
using a fi lter model addressing the relationship of perception and memory and 
individual experience. Emotional distress and mood are identifi ed as fi lters that 
infl uence perception. As an example of an information sheet, the fi lter model is 
shown in Figure 13.6. Th e relationship of emotional feelings to cognitive func-
tioning, somatic reaction, and behavior is elaborated in summarizing patients’ 
own experience. 
 Compensation sessions : Th e group identifi es universal basic emotions. 
Patients are asked about their own or the experience of others with each of 
these basic emotions. Th e aim is to improve patients’ understanding of factors

that aff ect emotion and of the impact of each emotion in daily-living situations. 
Furthermore, patients learn facial recognition techniques and how to interpret 
human gestures: Th ey are encouraged to diff erentiate facial aff ects by identify-
ing typical features of the mouth, eyes, eyebrows, nose and facial wrinkles of 
each emotion. Th e same procedure is used for human gestures. We put spe-
cial emphasis on the position of the arms, hands, and fi ngers, as well as of the 
whole body. 
 In complementing aff ect recognition exercises, a second card sorting exer-
cise was designed to address emotional concept formation: Patients receive dark 
gray and light gray cards. One basic emotion is written on each of the dark gray 
cards. Light gray cards contain diff erent commonly used terms, mostly referring 
to one basic emotion. Others are ambiguous and refer to more than one emo-
tion (e.g., disappointment is oft en interpreted as anger or sadness, sometimes

this is not possible due to the ambiguous meaning of a word, two solutions are 
accepted. Finally, the impact of the emotional state on cognitive functioning in 
daily life is discussed in the group.

 Restitution sessions : A large body of pictures is available in the manual to 
improve aff ect decoding. Th ree diffi  culty levels are included: First, unambigu-
ous pictures show simple stimuli of facial aff ect, followed by pictures addressing 
facial aff ect and gestures, and ending with complex pictures showing emotionally 
loaded interpersonal situations. In all of the three stages, patients are reinforced to 
use the learned interpretation strategies of the compensation sessions. 
 Module B 
 Th e two MATRICS dimensions of verbal learning and memory, as well as visual 
learning and memory, are dealt with separately, beginning with verbal learning 
and memory. Th e social cognitive part of this module represents a straight con-
tinuation of the perceptual process introduced in Module A. Patients learn to rec-
ognize the key information in social situations (social perception). In this context, 
INT works on patients’ judgments about the intentions and thoughts of others in 
a social situation, which is defi ned in the literature as ToM. 
  Neurocognitive Part: Verbal and Visual Learning and Memory 
 Introduction session : Didactically, Module B is strongly related to the content of 
Module A. Th e already-introduced fi lter model is used to explain the relationship 
of perception and memory, wherein the quality of selective attention to the envi-
ronment is postulated as strongly dependent on an individual’s earlier experiences 
and mood. Th is neurocognitive domain is further introduced by reading two pro-
totypical short stories in the group. One short story addresses short-term memory 
and the other one prospective memory. Information sheets support patients in 
diff erentiating among short-term memory, long-term memory, and prospective 
memory. 
 Compensation sessions : Again, we focus on the relevance of these abilities for 
successful coping with life and patients’ assumptions about their own level of func-
tioning in this area. Individual strategies of the patients used in daily life to com-
pensate for memory defi cits are summarized and completed through information 
sheets available for short-term memory, as well as for prospective memory. Patients 
then try each of the new coping strategies (e.g., chunking, immediate repetition, 
or external memory hook) using group exercises. Th ereaft er, patients’ experience 
of their performance in the exercises is compared with their pre-exercise predic-
tion. Th is allows them to identify their resources and defi cits in memory domains. 
Having both defi cits and resources is normalized using the rationale that every-
body has an individual profi le of cognitive functioning comprising strengths and 
weaknesses; it is hardly possible to have strengths in every domain of cognitive 
functioning. 
 Restitution sessions : Th e compensation strategies are exercised in repeated PC 
tasks, following errorless learning principles. Additionally, we developed group 
exercises addressing verbal and visual memory. Th ese exercises simulate real-life 
situations, foster group processes, and are more related to interpersonal demands 
on memory functions than are computer exercises. For example, in a role-play in 
which all patients participate, every patient gets a card including the name, the

hobby, the local phone number, and the favorite color of a fi ctional person (e.g., a 
politician, or a popular movie or sports star). In a highly structured exercise, each 
patient reads the description of the respective person on his or her card, which 
has to be memorized by the other group members. Such exercises, which take 
participants’ interests of private life into account, strongly support the motivation 
for active participation in the program. 
 Social Cognitive Part: Social Perception and Th eory of Mind 
 Introduction session : Th e social cognitive section of Module B is a straight contin-
uation of the intervention on emotion perception from Module A. However, the 
pictures showing emotion expression are embedded in an interpersonal and social 
context in this module. Additionally, ToM functioning is implicitly implicated in 
interpersonal scenes. Patients learn about the impact of social and emotion per-
ception and ToM functioning on interpersonal behavior using information and 
worksheets. Th e main objective is that patients learn to diff erentiate between facts 
and assumption. 
 Compensation sessions : Th e intervention in social perception is strongly 
based on the one used in IPT. Th e social pictures, which were rated for their 
level of diffi  culty, vary in visual complexity (number of presented stimuli) 
and emotional loading. At the beginning of the module, slides rated with a 
low degree of complexity and emotional loading are presented. Th e level of 
diffi  culty gradually increases as group members improve. Additionally, a set 
of more complex pictures was designed to create a higher level of diffi  culty. 
Following social learning principles, patients act out some of the pictured 
scenes in role-plays. Th is helps to activate the patients and gives them experi-
ence with key aspects of the situation. Broadly, the use of group process and 
role-plays is thought to stimulate ToM functioning, helping patients learn to 
take the perspective of others. 
 Didactically, patients learn social perception techniques in three steps:
 
1. Gathering information : Th e group members are asked to describe a slide 
as accurately and in as much detail as possible. At this step, the slide 
should not be interpreted to diff er between fact and assumption. 
 
2. Interpretation and discussion : Group members are asked to state their 
views on possible interpretations of the situation and the expressed 
emotions depicted on the slide. Every opinion needs justifi cation by 
reference to the actual visual information gathered in the fi rst step. 
All group members discuss the diff erent possible interpretations 
subsequently. Th ey learn how to judge the correctness and the likeliness 
of each interpretation. By comparing and substantiating various 
interpretations, the participants learn to evaluate the evidence for 
their interpretation, rather than just adopting group consensus. In 
addition, they learn to decode facial aff ect and emotional gestures 
and understand how and why a social situation can be interpreted in 
various ways.  

326 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
 
3. Assigning a title : Aft er gathering information and interpreting the 
pictures, the therapist asks the group members to choose a title for the 
picture. Th e title should be short and meaningful, refl ecting the most 
important aspects of the social situation on the slide (summarizing the 
contents of the slide). Th e appropriateness of the suggested title will 
enable the therapists to verify whether the key aspects of a situation have 
been perceived and understood. 
 Th eory of mind skills have already been improved implicitly by the interpreta-
tion of depicted interpersonal situations. Against this background, we developed 
the following exercise (Figure 13.8): Th e group is split in two parts. While one half 
leaves the room together with the co-therapist to do some alternative exercises 
(called the “receiving group”), the other half (the “sending group”) chooses one 
picture out of a set of landscape pictures and describes it in detail, in a manner 
analogous to the social perception task. Th e members of the sending group mem-
orize the detailed description. Th e receiving group returns to the room without 
knowing the targeted picture. Th e sending group verbalizes the description. Th e 
members of the receiving group have to take the verbalized perspective to form 
an internal picture. Th e receiving group then attempts to recognize the targeted 
picture from a set of pictures. In further exercises, the participants have to take 
over the perspective of actors in fi ctional written stories, movies, or comics. Some

of the contents of these ToM exercises are also transferred into role-plays. Th is 
increases the experience of emotional impact on the actors and facilitates com-
parison with their individual daily-life experiences. 
 Restitution sessions : Social perception, emotion perception, and ToM skills are 
rehearsed in repeated exercises with a continuously increasing level of diffi  culty 
and emotional salience. 
 Module C 
 Th e neurocognitive part of Module C focuses on the MATRICS domains of rea-
soning and problem solving. In these domains of executive functioning, the INT 
procedure introduces the highest level of neurocognitive demands. Th e two tar-
geted domains are dealt with separately, beginning with reasoning. Th e social 
cognitive part of this module addresses social schema, including exercises of 
social norms and social scripts. Th erapeutically, it should be taken into consider-
ation that many patients have negative experiences with their own inappropriate 
social behavior, according to general norms. Confl icts with others and emotional 
 reactions may have been the consequences of such behavior. 
 Neurocognitive Part: Reasoning 
 Introduction session : In the educational part, the term “reasoning” is replaced by 
the term “thinking” in the context of daily-living situations. When reading short 
stories, a strong focus is given to patients’ own thoughts regarding concrete social 
situations and their emotional impact. Information and worksheets address con-
cept formation, cognitive fl exibility, and neurobiological aspects of this cognitive 
domain. 
 Compensation sessions : Verbal concept exercises are used to enhance verbal 
communication skills. Patients practice fi nding the appropriate words during a 
conversation and summarizing in their own words movies they have watched 
or books they have read. Worksheets individualize the learned coping strategies, 
according to patients’ daily-living situations. 
 Restitution sessions : Several PC exercises are used. For example, six diff erent 
kinds of plants are shown on the computer screen: carnation, anemone, tulip, 
palm, rose, narcissus. Patients are asked which plant is diff erent from all others 
(i.e., the palm). Computerized exercises are followed by group exercises concern-
ing conceptual hierarchies and categorizing of diff erent stimuli. For example, 
patients are shown a word or a phrase (e.g., “packing for a beach trip”). Aft erward, 
brainstorming is done to gather related words. Finally, the summarized 30 to 40 
related words are categorized (e.g., “toiletries,” “food,” “medication,” “entertain-
ment materials”). 
 Another exercise involves the planning of specifi c behaviors in diff erent situa-
tions. Th is is operationalized in a group exercise: Th e course of concrete actions 
well known in daily living, such as cooking spaghetti or going to a birthday party, 
is split apart into sequences. Th e therapist writes these sequences on diff erent 
cards. Each patient gets one card. Th e group members have to put the diff erent 
cards (sequences) in the right order.

 Neurocognitive Part: Problem Solving 
 Introduction session : Patients are familiarized with problem and goal-oriented 
thinking (information sheet in Figure 13.9) by presenting the standard problem-
solving model in seven steps commonly used in cognitive-behavioral therapy. 
Patients’ own resources in problem solving in the context of daily living are sum-
marized using worksheets. 
 Compensation sessions : Th e standard problem-solving techniques are applied. 
Didactically, the INT procedure in this part resembles an individual intervention: 
Each patient mentions one problem he or she actually could not solve. Problems 
should be rather simple, with a high probability of fi nding a solution during ther-
apy (e.g., to clean the apartment, to fi nd a friend, to stop smoking). Each patient 
practices the learned strategies individually, using the other group members as 
resources during discussion. Finally, chosen solutions are translated into action in 
real-life situations using homework assignments. 
 Restitution sessions : Patients repeat abstract lab-based computer exercises for 
problem solving (e.g., to fi nd the right path out of a labyrinth or to equilibrate 
scales). Th ese exercises are partly done in small groups of two or three patients 
to enhance group interaction and the social context of problem solving. Patients 
have to debate and convince the other group members of their own solution and 
have to fi nd a consensus. Riddles are also used. 
 Social Cognitive Part: Social Schema 
 Introduction session : Many techniques are adopted as described in the reasoning 
and problem solving sections, but the emphasis is on social relations. Patients’ 
social schema are modifi ed in two ways: fi rst, by the use of social action sequences 
(scripts), and second, by refl ection on the impact of behaviors from the perspective 
1. Identifying and analyzing the problem
2. Describing the problem
3. Generating Alternative Solutions
4. Evaluating the Alternatives
5. Deciding on a Solution
6. Translating the Solution into Action

of social norms and social roles. Again, teaching is based on information and 
worksheets. 
 Compensation sessions : Patients learn and discuss which behavior is appro-
priate in selected social roles, according to social norms. Patients’ own negative 
experiences, as well as personal resources, are summarized using worksheets. 
Furthermore, general expectancies of others and social consequences following 
role violation are emphasized. Movie sequences showing actors whose behavior 
is incompatible with general social norms and roles are analyzed sequentially. 
Aft erward, alternative behaviors are role-played. Additionally, patients learn how 
to deal with social stigma (e.g., “I’m not like others”), following a normalizing 
approach. 
 Finally, patients are supported to develop goal-oriented individual planning 
skills, in accordance with the demands of social roles and stresses, following a 
strategy learning approach used in the already-described problem-solving model. 
Th ese skills are repeated extensively in the restitution sessions. 
 Restitution sessions : In a social script exercise, cards with pictures referring to a 
common daily action (e.g., buying a bus ticket, ordering a meal) are presented to 
the group. Patients then describe the pictures on the cards and aft erward try to put 
the cards into the right order to depict a logical sequence of events. Finally, patients 
fi nd a title best describing the content of the sequence. Patients are instructed to 
use facts and not assumptions in discussion. Following this same procedure, an 
additional group exercise addressing actions of daily life is used: Patients have to 
assemble segments of an action into a logical sequence (e.g., repairing a bicycle). 
 Module D 
 Th e neurocognitive part of the last module addresses working memory. Th e 
respective interventions address cognitive fl exibility and selective attention pro-
cessing. Social cognitive interventions focus on the impact of individuals’ attri-
bution styles on themselves, others, and the situation. Consequently, patients’ 
emotional strain is highest in this fi nal part of INT treatment. Th us, strategies for 
coping with emotional strain associated with overstimulation are a main focus 
during these sessions. Patients learn to implement both emotional and behavioral 
coping strategies. 
  Neurocognitive Part: Working Memory 
 Introduction session : In the fi rst educational part, patients read a short story 
wherein the protagonist has to shift  between several actions during competitive 
work. Th e cognitive fl exibility skills needed are related to the life experiences of 
the patients using worksheets. 
 In a second short story, patients learn that coping with a stress-inducing, sen-
sory overloaded situation demands selective attention skills. Here, cognitive, 
emotional, behavioral, and somatic consequences of internal and external over-
stimulation are analyzed. 
 Compensation sessions : Compensation strategies are introduced using informa-
tion sheets. Th e intervention uses worksheets, and individualizes and transfers the 

330 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
coping compensation strategies into concrete daily-living situations. Th ereby, the 
impact of the environment, interpersonal and social circumstances, and individual 
resources are considered. Patients learn (a) how to improve cognitive fl exibility, 
such as by using behavioral rituals to simultaneously cook and talk on the phone, 
and (b) how to cope with distraction, such as during work or leisure-time activi-
ties. Coping strategies addressing cognitive fl exibility and selective attention are 
improved during role-plays in the group, focusing on interpersonal situations. For 
example, a patient has to communicate with another patient while all other group 
members are talking very loudly to simulate overstimulation in a restaurant. 
 Restitution sessions : By means of PC-based exercises, patients fi rst practice the 
learned strategies on a highly abstract level. An example of a PC-based exercise 
is to identify a targeted stimulus in a bulk of similar but not identical stimuli. 
Additionally, patients improve their selective attention using stimuli of complex 
pictures. An example of a complex picture is included in Figure 13.10. While 
showing this picture, patients listen to a brief story; for example, that the therapist 
wants to send a letter. Th en patients are asked whether they can help to fi nd the 
post offi  ce. Finally, repeated role-plays stimulate the use of cognitive fl exibility 
skills in social context before each patient tries to implement the learned skills in 
his or her personal life. 
 Social Cognitive Part: Attribution And Emotion Regulation 
 Many schizophrenia patients suff er from persistent positive symptoms associated 
with negative life experiences. Th e social cognitive domain of attribution is oft en 
 Figure 13.10   Integrated Neurocognitive Th erapy Module D: example of a pictured 
stimuli group exercise addressing selective attention (working memory): “Where is the

strongly related to positive symptoms. In appraising a situation, schizophrenia 
patients oft en jump to conclusions without gathering all the information or show 
an overgeneralized attributional style. Because intervening on attributions can be 
stressful for the patients, INT addresses this theme at the end of treatment, when 
the group has established high cohesion (friendship and confi dence). 
 Introduction session : Th is fi nal part of INT starts with education about individ-
ual attributional styles that determine thinking and behavior (attributional bias). 
Continuing the content of the previously introduced neurocognitive part of INT, 
the association of attributional styles with overstimulation and emotional strain 
is described. Introducing a vulnerability-stress-coping model, patients learn to 
understand how individual stress is determined, how emotional strain reduces 
functional capacity, and how to manage stressful situations. 
 Compensation sessions : Here, INT works with standardized descriptions of con-
crete situations. Th e fi ctional protagonist, who is well known from the short stories 
previously read in the group, acts in situations taken out of real life. Th e probability 
is high that some patients have had comparable experiences. For example, “Peter 
(fi ctional protagonist) is sitting in a restaurant drinking a coff ee and reading a news-
paper. A man eating at another table looks at him from time to time.” Patients are 
asked to describe the situation in detail and to generate hypotheses about why the 
man is looking at Peter. A typical paranoid attribution would be that the man is 
looking at Peter because the man is a police offi  cer who is monitoring him. Th e 
didactic means are the same as in the social cognitive part of Module B addressing 
social perception: First, patients have to gather all the information available before 
they generate a hypothesis refl ecting their interpretation of the situation. In other 
words, patients are taught to use facts instead of assumptions and that listing of facts 
has to be completed before the situation can be interpreted. Th is procedure dimin-
ishes patients’ tendency to jump to inadequate conclusions. Aft erward, all alter-
native hypotheses are summarized and evaluated. Th e cognitive, emotional, and 
behavioral consequences of each hypothesis are analyzed. Th e described situation 
is practiced in role-plays to stimulate patients’ perception of related feelings. Th is 
represents one goal of INT: Patients experience their feelings related to a concrete 
situation, and they realize that a change in thinking and behavior has emotional 
consequences. Patients may thereby learn to make less stressful attributions. 
 In a fi nal stress-inoculation training, including relaxation strategies like 
self-instruction and visualization techniques, patients learn to identify their own 
stress indicators and to cope with individual stress reactions. Th ey learn to dis-
tinguish between behavioral and emotional coping techniques using information 
sheets. An example from our lab: A patient reports how he has managed to deal 
with a stressful situation in his daily-life context using behavioral and emotional 
coping strategies. He was waiting for a colleague at the stairs of the station, as he 
had arrived too early. However, the station security personnel told him to go away. 
In former times, this would have caused feelings of anger and aggressive reactions. 
However, he thought that they were only doing their job. Consequently, he walked 
away without complaining about their behavior. He also did shadowboxing in a 
quiet corner, which helped him to calm down. 

332

 Restitution sessions : In the fi nal section, attributional processing is repeatedly 
improved in role-plays addressing actions of daily life (e.g., “while sitting in a res-
taurant, someone at the next table is looking at me”). Patients should habituate to 
use less stressful attributions by practicing them in various situations of individual 
relevance in the group. Again, we use written short stories as stimuli or individual 
experiences of daily living described by group members. In parallel, patients are 
taught to repeatedly improve individualized stress reduction techniques that they 
have designed. Th is therapy sequence is later expanded to the real-world context 
through homework assignments. 
 TROUBLESHOOTING 
 Based on our experience with both IPT and INT, we think that one of the main 
problems in conducting such a group therapy occurs at the beginning, say, during 
the fi rst fi ve sessions: When group cohesion is low, it can be diffi  cult to motivate 
patients to participate on a regular basis in the group sessions. Th erefore, thera-
pists should be well trained in cognitive and behavioral intervention techniques and 
therapy planning. Th ey should also have some experience in group therapy and 
especially in handling group processes. Generally, the group should be well struc-
tured in the beginning by the main therapist supported by the co-therapist. In other 
words, the main therapist should be clearly defi ned as the leader of the group. 
 In the beginning, as well as in the following sections of INT, an ongoing diffi  culty 
is activating and motivating the participants. Against the background of therapists 
supporting group processes, INT always focuses closely on patients’ resources, 
instead of defi cits alone. Additionally, patients are allowed to take a time-out when 
an exercise seems to be too diffi  cult or when they are not in the mood to par-
ticipate actively. In this context, patients also have the option to choose between 
diff erent exercises of various levels of diffi  culty. Here, it should be mentioned that 
a substantial minority of patients struggle with illiteracy or motor diffi  culties that 
hinder writing. Additionally, from our experience with IPT and INT groups, some 
patients may have problems reading and writing due to cognitive defi cits or emo-
tional strain. In this case, the co-therapist supports such a patient in writing down 
comments at the beginning of the therapy. Aft er group cohesion has been estab-
lished, other patients oft en help group mates with such defi cits. Last, but not least, 
the daily-living experiences of each patient are strictly taken into consideration in 
the INT. All of these points should help to improve and maintain patients’ intrinsic 
motivation during therapy, which prevents dropouts. In our groups, INT seems to 
be quite successful in attaining these goals since the dropout rate is always around 
10%, and the session participation rate is more than 80%.  
 PATIENT SELECTION CONSIDERATIONS 
 INT was originally designed for stabilized outpatients. Th e criteria for optimal 
INT treatment diff er in some points from its predecessor, IPT, as well as from 
www.ebook3000.com

Integrated Neurocognitive Th erapy 
333
IPT’s other sequel, WAF (Figure 13.11). Clinical experience implementing INT 
in various outpatient settings during an extensive international evaluation study 
clearly has demonstrated the benefi t of INT to participants with low to moderate 
therapy motivation, insight into own resources and defi cits in cognitive function-
ing, and moderate social integration and functioning. Additionally, INT could be 
an appropriate intervention for individuals in a prodromal phase of illness at a 
high-risk stage. On the other hand, the literature suggests that IPT may be more 
appropriate for more chronic patients with severe negative symptoms, as well as 
for elderly patients and patients in a more post-acute phase in inpatient settings. 
Th e social part of IPT and the WAF programs are both designed for patients 
fi rst rehabilitated in cognitive functioning. In these programs, cognitive defi cits 
should not limit social intervention. In contrast to IPT, patients participating in 
WAF procedures should be well stabilized. WAF is indicated when patients show 
unmet needs in work, residential, or leisure areas of daily living. Several studies 
indicate that patients benefi t from IPT, INT and WAF independently of their age. 
Implementing INT showed that it is appropriate for young patients in their fi rst 
episode of psychosis, due, in part, to the various therapy materials, including PC 
exercises. For this reason, we are currently modifying INT for use with patients 
at high risk for developing a psychosis. We have also found that middle-aged to 
older patients are oft en very motivated to work on a computer for the fi rst time 
in their lives.

 INT includes various therapy materials: case vignettes, information sheets, work-
sheets, stimulus pictures, standardized written cards for group exercises, and a 
computer program for restitution sessions. Currently (Spring 2011), we only have

 Cognitive Enhancement Therapy  
 S H A U N  M .   E A C K  ■ 
 Social cognition is pervasively and markedly impaired in individuals with schizo-
phrenia (Green et al., 2008; Penn et al., 1997), and a growing body of evidence 
indicates that these impairments are signifi cant contributors to functional dis-
ability in the disorder (Couture, Penn, & Roberts, 2006). Unfortunately, pharma-
cotherapeutic interventions designed to enhance cognition, social or nonsocial, 
have had a limited impact on these defi cits (Keefe et al., 2007; Sergi et al., 2007a). 
However, cognitive rehabilitation approaches that utilize computerized and/or 
group-based training methods have emerged as eff ective approaches for enhanc-
ing cognition in schizophrenia (Horan et al., 2009; McGurk, Twamley, Sitzer, 
McHugo, & Mueser, 2007). Cognitive Enhancement Th erapy (CET; Hogarty & 
Greenwald, 2006) is a comprehensive approach to the remediation of social and 
nonsocial cognitive impairments in schizophrenia, which has demonstrated con-
siderable effi  cacy in clinical trials with this population (Eack et al., 2009; Hogarty 
et al., 2004). 
 CET is an integrated, small-group intervention designed to enhance the neuro-
cognitive and social-cognitive impairments that limit functional recovery from 
schizophrenia. Th e treatment integrates 60 hours of computer-based neurocog-
nitive training in attention, memory, and problem solving, with 45 structured 
social-cognitive group sessions designed to improve perspective taking, gistful-
ness, social context appraisal, and other core social-cognitive processes needed to 
succeed in adult life. Although the enhancement of social cognition is a primary 
focus of CET, targeting impairments in neurocognition is seen as necessary to 
support the attention, memory, and executive functions that provide a foundation 
for social information processing. It is through the unique integration of these two 
methods of intervention that CET has conferred signifi cant benefi ts for patients 
with schizophrenia to improve cognition and functional outcome, and even pro-
tect against brain loss in this population (Eack et al., 2009; Eack et al., 2010b; 
Hogarty et al., 2004). Th is chapter provides an overview of CET, its theoretical 
foundations, targets, and treatment methods for patients with schizophrenia. A 
complete and detailed description of CET is available in  Cognitive Enhancement 
Th erapy: Th e Training Manual  (Hogarty & Greenwald, 2006).

 THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS 
 CET is based upon a neurodevelopmental theory of cognitive development, which 
draws from disciplines ranging from neuroscience to sociology, and lays the 
foundation for the principles of treatment employed in the approach (Hogarty & 
Flesher, 1999a). Th is theoretical framework begins with recognition of the devel-
opmental nature of the brain and cognition (Gogtay et al., 2004), and increasing 
evidence characterizing schizophrenia as a disorder of neurodevelopment (Lewis 
& Levitt, 2002; Weinberger, 1987). Th e cognitive impairments experienced by 
people with schizophrenia do not begin at the onset of psychosis; rather, their 
origins are clearly evident years before the onset of the clinical syndrome (Eack 
et al., 2010c; Keshavan, Diwadkar, Montrose, Rajarethinam, & Sweeney, 2005). 
Studies have implicated prenatal (Kunugi, Nanko, & Murray, 2001), perinatal 
(Seidman et al., 2000), and postnatal (Prasad et al., 2011) insults in the develop-
ment of schizophrenia, all suggesting a neurodevelopmental pathogenesis. Th e 
onset of schizophrenia typically occurs during a key maturational period for the 
development of social cognition, as individuals are learning to transition to adult-
hood and assume adult social roles. Th e timing of illness onset at this period has 
a signifi cant neurodevelopmental impact and places schizophrenia patients at a 
profound disadvantage compared to their nonaff ected peers. Indeed, when com-
paring the neurocognitive abilities of adult patients with schizophrenia to preado-
lescent children, striking similarities exist. Slowness of processing, inattentiveness, 
and poor cognitive fl exibility are the norm in preadolescent children (Lezack, 
1983). In addition, individuals at this age routinely exhibit egocentric behavior 
that is incongruent with situational norms and indicative of an underdeveloped 
capacity for perspective taking, foresight, and social context appraisal (Selman & 
Schultz, 1990). Th ese characteristics of early cognitive development are hallmark 
signs of adults with schizophrenia, and, when combined with evidence on the 
neurodevelopmental nature of the condition, increasingly suggest that patients 
with schizophrenia suff er from a developmental delay in higher order cognitive 
processes, particularly social cognition. 
 By conceptualizing the cognitive impairments experienced by patients with 
schizophrenia in a neurodevelopmental context, Hogarty and colleagues then 
created CET as a method to “jump start” the developmental delay in cognitive 
functioning in schizophrenia. Methods for addressing this delay and enhancing 
cognition were based upon the emerging literature of brain plasticity (Karni et al., 
1995) and the classic literature on social development (Selman & Schultz, 1990). 
Studies have increasingly documented the remarkable capacity of the brain to 
respond to enriched environmental experiences and reorganize itself for func-
tional specialization and to compensate for injuries. Th e repetitive and strategic 
practice of motor tasks were shown to result in changes in the motor cortex and 
improved motor function in those who had experienced a stroke (Johansson, 
2000). Th ese principles were also successfully used to remediate other cogni-
tive problems, such as attention defi cits in patients with a traumatic brain injury 
(Ben-Yishay, Piasetsky, & Rattok, 1985). In CET, schizophrenia is viewed as a

brain disorder, and the emerging evidence on brain plasticity points to the possi-
bility of altering brain function through the practice of tasks designed to challenge 
the very cognitive processes that are impaired in the disorder. CET capitalizes on 
the growing evidence supporting the brain’s capacity for plasticity and its ability 
to benefi t from enriched environmental experiences, and provides a comprehen-
sive approach employing innovative experiential methods to improve social and 
nonsocial cognitive functioning for schizophrenia patients. 
 Although studies on brain plasticity helped provide a meaningful organization 
of how cognition might be improved in schizophrenia, models and theories of 
information processing provided a meaningful organization to these methods. 
Contemporary information processing models structure cognitive processes in 
a hierarchical fashion and outline their many interdependencies (Simon, 1979). 
For example, the ability to hold a piece of information in working memory is 
highly dependent upon intact attentional abilities. Higher order social-cognitive 
processes are also dependent upon intact basic information processes. Individuals 
are unlikely to ever succeed in the interpretation and recognition of social cues if 
they cannot attend to them in the fi rst place. Social-cognitive abilities also neces-
sitate a rapid, gistful, and parallel processing of information that is in contrast 
with the slow, serial, and concrete processing style of many patients with schizo-
phrenia. Evidence of the interdependent nature of cognitive processes, as well as 
the interrelations between cognitive impairments in schizophrenia (Eack et al., 
2010a; Sergi et al., 2007b), clearly establishes the need for an integrated approach 
to improving cognition in the disorder, one that focuses on both neurocognitive 
and social-cognitive functioning. Th is evidence also indicates that some remedia-
tion of basic defi cits in attention and processing speed are likely to be necessary 
for individuals to benefi t from social-cognitive training. As such, CET begins with 
training in attention and processing speed for several months before individuals 
engage in the social-cognitive group curriculum. 
 Finally, the methods used to enhance social cognition in CET have relied on 
well-established theories of social development, particularly the sociological 
principles of secondary socialization (Parsons & Bales, 1956). Individuals develop 
an understanding of the social world in a variety of ways that usually involves a 
nonlinear trajectory. In early childhood, primary socialization is the mainstay for 
gaining social knowledge and consists of direct instruction about concrete rules 
of behavior by others, oft en parents or caregivers, such as “don’t talk with your 
mouth full” and “say please and thank you” (Hogarty & Flesher, 1999a). However, 
as individuals enter into the adult social world, strict rules for behavior become 
less commonplace and primary socialization becomes insuffi  cient for successful 
interpersonal interactions. In fact, a hallmark of adult social cognition is the abil-
ity to be cognitively fl exible and recognize that the rules and norms that govern 
one social situation may not apply to others. Frequently, individuals fi nd them-
selves needing to spontaneously appraise the informal rules that govern many 
social contexts. Information about these informal rules and norms for behavior 
are gained through accumulating secondary socialization experiences, or those 
experiences in which an individual is able to observe the situational context; 

338 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
identify the perspectives, intentions, and emotional tone of others; and abstract 
the informal social rules that govern these situations. Unlike primary socializa-
tion, secondary socialization does not involve direct instruction of specifi c rules, 
but relies on individuals using a variety of social-cognitive abilities (e.g., perspec-
tive taking, social context appraisal) to learn how to behave. 
 Th e observation that much of adult social life is guided by informal rules of 
behavior obtained through secondary socialization experiences led Hogarty and 
colleagues to posit that the provision of such experiences within a therapeutic con-
text could be of substantial value for enhancing social cognition in schizophrenia. 
As a result, CET makes use of a small-group context to facilitate the process of 
secondary socialization in schizophrenia. In the social-cognitive groups, individ-
uals must not only learn the formal rules and norms of behavior that govern the 
group, but also the informal rules that characterize their interactions with their 
peers and CET coaches. Teamwork during in-group exercises, the presentation of 
homework, and the expression of feedback to peers are all based on formal and 
informal rules of conduct that must be extracted by observing others and taking 
their perspectives, appraising the group context, and relying on previous social 
knowledge from related experiences. Th rough the integration of these enriched 
secondary socialization experiences, along with the computer-based training in 
neurocognition, CET is able to facilitate improved social cognition among its 
recipients. 
 TREATMENT GOALS AND TARGETS 
 CET addresses the social and nonsocial cognitive impairments that limit functional 
outcome in schizophrenia. Cognitive impairments are viewed as rate-limiting fac-
tors to functional recovery in the disorder, and their amelioration is essential to 
supporting the personal goals of individuals with schizophrenia and improving 
their quality of life. Th is overall goal of enhancing cognition in CET is divided 
into the following two major subgoals during treatment: (1) fostering higher 
order thinking and (2) the development of social wisdom. Th e goal of facilitat-
ing higher order thinking among recipients is refl ective of the neurodevelopmen-
tal theory guiding CET, which views cognitive impairment in schizophrenia as a 
developmental delay. Th e fi rst goal of CET is then to support the transition to an 
adult cognitive style. Th e higher order thinking that characterizes adult cogni-
tion is fl uid, abstract, and gistful, as opposed to concrete. Adult thinking is also 
active and fl exible, and does not rely on rigid rules for behavior. Further, adults 
respond spontaneously to unrehearsed social situations and take the initiative to 
learn about their social environment in order to accomplish their goals. One of 
the primary goals of CET is to facilitate a mental shift  to these characteristics 
of adult cognition through the provision of targeted therapeutic experiences and 
structured cognitive activities designed to facilitate higher order thinking. 
 Th e second goal of CET is to help individuals with schizophrenia develop social 
wisdom through the provision of enriched secondary socialization experiences.

Cognitive Enhancement Th erapy

CET focuses on helping individuals learn how to abstract the rules and norms for 
behavior in unrehearsed social exchanges, appraise the social context to identify 
appropriate behavior, take the perspective of others to assess their feelings and 
intentions, and assess the eff ectiveness of likely responses. CET fosters the devel-
opment of foresightfulness to evaluate potential options for discourse/behavior 
and their likely consequences, and then to choose a course of action accordingly. 
Th ese social-cognitive abilities become the foundation that CET uses to help indi-
viduals become more interpersonally wise. In addition, individuals develop social 
knowledge in CET by coming to appreciate the importance of social and emo-
tional reciprocity in interactions. Many patients are accustomed to being the one 
who is cared for, and they rarely recognize the critical role of providing support 
and empathy to others in building and maintaining relationships. Finally, through 
this process of becoming more knowledgeable about the adult social context, CET 
aims to demystify the socialization process and increase social comfort among 
participants. 
 Th e therapeutic targets of CET address its goals of fostering higher order think-
ing and developing social wisdom. Clearly, impaired cognition is the primary 
target of CET. Unfortunately, the heterogeneity of schizophrenia results in many 
types of cognitive impairments, which must be taken into account to personal-
ize the approach to the unique strengths and diffi  culties of each individual being 
treated. To parse the heterogeneity of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and 
provide a personally meaningful framework for treatment targets, CET views 
impaired cognition as belonging to three dysfunctional cognitive styles of think-
ing (Hogarty & Flesher, 1999b). Th ese include unmotivated, disorganized, and 
infl exible cognitive styles. Each style has its own behavioral characteristics that 
are meaningful and recognizable to patients. 
 An  unmotivated cognitive style is characterized by diffi  culties with motivation 
and impoverished thinking and speech. For individuals with this cognitive style, 
CET aims to help them generate ideas, become more motivated, use elaborated 
speech, and think actively in social situations. Individuals with a  disorganized style 
of thinking have diffi  culty organizing their ideas and oft en experience emotional 
dysregulation or “fl ooding.” Th e focus for individuals with a disorganized style in 
CET is to help them organize their ideas by abstracting the main point or “gist” out 
of social situations and discarding irrelevant details, as well as helping individuals 
learn and practice the use of autoprotective strategies to regulate their emotions. 
Th e third cognitive style,  infl exible thinking , is characterized by diffi  culty consid-
ering alternative points of view and explanations, and following rigid routines and 
rules for behavior. In CET, individuals with an infl exible style of thinking learn 
how to identify alternative solutions to problems, tolerate ambiguity, cope with 
the arousal associated with modifying routines, and become more cognitively 
fl exible. Th ese cognitive styles exist along a continuum of severity. Individuals 
may have characteristics of multiple cognitive styles, although one style is usually 
predominant. Th e identifi cation of a person’s dysfunctional cognitive style pro-
vides a personally meaningful set of treatment targets that  individuals can address 
throughout CET.

 PATIENT POPULATION 
 CET was developed for individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaf-
fective disorder, who are in the recovery phase of their condition. Schizophrenia 
is a phasic disorder characterized by prodromal, acute, and recovery phases 
(McGlashan & Johannessen, 1996). When individuals are acutely psychotic, the 
need for hospitalization and pharmacotherapeutic and psychosocial approaches 
to help stabilize positive symptoms is paramount, and CET would likely be of 
little benefi t for such individuals at that time. However, the majority of patients 
with schizophrenia recover from the positive symptoms psychosis with adequate 
pharmacologic and psychosocial treatment, and most schizophrenia patients are 
able to enter the recovery phase of the disorder. CET was developed specifi cally 
for this population, as Hogarty and colleagues had previously developed several 
highly eff ective psychosocial approaches to be used in conjunction with antip-
sychotic medication for individuals in the earlier, more acute phases of schizo-
phrenia (Hogarty et al., 1974, 1986; Hogarty, 2002), and they sought to create in 
CET a recovery-phase intervention that would directly target the social and non-
social defi cits that kept patients from achieving improved functioning and a bet-
ter quality of life. It is important to note that the recovery phase of illness is not 
synonymous with a complete absence of positive symptoms, but rather refl ects 
that these symptoms have been stabilized and are reasonably well-controlled. 
Individuals who still experience frequent psychotic exacerbations leading to hos-
pitalization or who are not adherent to medication are in need of treatment more 
specifi c to the acute phase of schizophrenia, such as Personal Th erapy (Hogarty, 
2002). 
 In addition, CET was developed for patients with schizophrenia who do not 
have a comorbid intellectual disability, which is operationalized as an IQ of 80 
or below. Early trials of CET included some individuals with schizophrenia who 
had borderline intellectual functioning, and it was observed that such individuals 
had greater diffi  culty in grasping the concepts of the intervention, particularly the 
social-cognitive group curriculum, and were less likely to benefi t from the treat-
ment (Hogarty et al., 2004). Further, CET was not developed for patients with 
active substance use problems, due to the negative impact of substances on cogni-
tion and brain function. Importantly, it must be established that a potential recipi-
ent of CET experiences signifi cant cognitive and social disability, and since the 
majority of schizophrenia patients experience disability in these two areas, CET 
is indicated for many patients. It is also important to note that CET has shown 
effi  cacy in patients with chronic (Hogarty et al., 2004) and early-course (Eack 
et al., 2009) schizophrenia, indicating its broad applicability across the course of 
the illness. 
 Finally, since the development of CET, two new advances have begun to expand 
the population of individuals for whom CET could be eff ective and available. Th e 
fi rst initiative targets persons with schizophrenia and substance use problems, the 
most frequent of which are cannabis and alcohol (Volkow, 2009). Recognizing 
the frequency and impact of substance use on people with schizophrenia, Eack 
www.ebook3000.com

and colleagues have begun to integrate and expand the cognitive and social-cog-
nitive methods employed in CET with the aff ect regulation strategies of Personal 
Th erapy (Hogarty, 2002) to address cognitive impairment, aff ect dysregulation, 
and functional problems in patients with schizophrenia who misuse substances. 
Th e second CET initiative concerns individuals with autism spectrum disorders. 
Recently, Eack, Greenwald, Hogarty, and Minshew have begun adapting CET for 
verbal adults with autism spectrum disorders, who also experience signifi cant 
impairments in neurocognitive and social-cognitive functioning (Baron-Cohen, 
Leslie, & Frith, 1985; Minshew & Goldstein, 1998). Although these developments 
are still in progress and not currently available outside of our research setting, 
evidence of the potential benefi ts of CET for substance misusing schizophrenia 
patients and adults with autism spectrum disorders is eagerly awaited. 
 INTERVENTION METHODS 
 Initial Assessment 
 Th e process of CET begins with a collaborative assessment between the patient 
and treating coach to identify strengths and areas in need of improvement. As 
with all eff ective interventions, the treatment process cannot begin without a 
careful assessment of the presenting problems and goals for the patient. A careful 
assessment of the patient helps to establish both the need and readiness for CET. 
In addition, since CET is primarily a small-group–based intervention, assessment 
becomes essential not only for directing individual treatment, but also for consid-
ering the composition of the neurocognitive and social-cognitive groups. 
 Assessment in CET begins with a review of the patient’s history and the char-
acteristics that indicate eligibility for the program, which usually includes a thor-
ough psychiatric diagnostic assessment, an assessment of general intellectual 
ability (by an IQ test), and some inquiry into basic resources and housing stabil-
ity. Aft er this initial review, a semi-structured interview is conducted to provide 
a formal assessment of patient’s cognitive and social diffi  culties. Th is interview is 
known as the Cognitive Styles and Social Cognition Eligibility Interview, and is 
published in the CET training manual (Hogarty & Greenwald, 2006). During the 
interview, patients are asked a series of questions about problems they may expe-
rience in thinking, socialization, role adjustment, and goal attainment. Questions 
are open-ended and provide information on the three cognitive styles (impover-
ished, disorganized, and infl exible) that are the targets of CET. In addition, ques-
tions regarding social-cognitive and functional diffi  culties are also asked to assess 
problems in vocational and social functioning, as well as the patient’s adjustment 
to his to her disability. It is oft en helpful to videotape this interview so that it 
can be reviewed by other members of the CET treatment team, who may iden-
tify additional problems and areas of diffi  culty that the patient is experiencing. 
At a minimum, the fi nalization of clinical ratings on this assessment should be 
reviewed and discussed with the larger clinical team, as this assessment becomes 

342 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
important to the treatment planning process necessitating as accurate an assess-
ment as possible. 
 Aft er a patient has been admitted to the program, it is customary for them to be 
assigned a CET coach, who reviews the overall results of the Cognitive Styles and 
Social Cognition Eligibility Interview with them, as well as any neuropsychologi-
cal testing results that were completed. Th is initiates a productive dialog with the 
patient about the impact of cognitive impairment on his or her life, and how the 
treatment of such impairments can support the achievement of broader life goals. 
In addition to the eligibility interview, participants also undergo a brief (5-minute) 
test of simple reaction time developed as part of one of the CET soft ware pack-
ages (Ben-Yishay et al., 1985). Th is assessment provides a gauge of pretreatment 
attention and processing speed ability, which is important for constructing neu-
rocognitive training pairs, as the fi rst neurocognitive training module in CET is 
an attention and processing speed module. Th e pairing of individuals who have 
faster processing speeds (200–250 ms) with those who have slower processing 
speeds (350–450 ms) could be potentially demoralizing to the slower participant 
and frustrating to the faster participant, who would most likely be able to move at 
a faster pace. Since attention and processing speed are the foundations for many 
more complex cognitive abilities, the matching of individuals in reaction time is 
oft en helpful in subsequent memory and problem-solving exercises that occur 
during the later stages of CET. Consideration of other aspects, such as age and 
common interests, is also useful when pairing participants for computer work. 
 Finally, it is important to mention that collecting some assessment of outcome 
data is helpful during the CET program. For agencies with access to neuropsycho-
logical testing services, repeated testing using standardized neuropsychological 
tests such as the Wechsler Memory Scale (Wechsler, 1987), the Wisconsin Card 
Sorting Test (Heaton, Chelune, Talley, Kay, & Curtiss, 1993), the California Verbal 
Learning Test (Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, & Ober, 1987), and Trials B (Reitan & 
Waltson, 1985) at annual or 9-month intervals has been helpful for assessing treat-
ment progress. Other agencies that do not have resources or access to neuropsy-
chologists can assess progress by repeating the initial reaction time assessment, as 
well as using two CET clinician rating measures (Cognitive Styles Inventory and 
Social Cognition Profi le) at initial assessment and at annual or 9-month intervals. 
Th ese assessments have been shown to be sensitive to CET treatment eff ects in 
previous research studies (Eack et al., 2009; Hogarty et al., 2004). In this age of 
evidence-based practice, the systematic collection of outcome data is imperative 
for program evaluation and in assessing the gains and future needs of individual 
patients. 
 Neurocognitive Training

ence that patients encounter. Th is consists of a comprehensive training program 
that employs exercises in attention, memory, and problem solving designed to

address the neurocognitive impairments experienced by patients with schizo-
phrenia. Neurocognitive training in CET makes use of a “bottom-up” process, 
in which problems in attention and processing speed are targeted fi rst using the 
Orientation Remediation Module (Ben-Yishay et al., 1985), followed by impair-
ments in memory, and ultimately diffi  culties in reasoning, planning, and problem 
solving using soft ware developed by Bracy (1994) (see Table 14.1). Unlike most 
neurocognitive training programs in which patients participate in neurocognitive 
training as a solitary activity, patient pairs are formed for neurocognitive train-
ing in CET. Th e pairing of patients has numerous benefi ts, including promoting 
treatment engagement; providing an early opportunity for socialization and the 
practicing of basic social-cognitive abilities, such as giving support; and making 
the computer training process more enjoyable for the participants. In addition, 
unlike other programs, neurocognitive training in CET is not a “hands-off ” activ-
ity, but is actively facilitated by a therapist/coach who guides participants through 
the exercises and challenges them to think strategically about their performance.

A coach facilitates only one neurocognitive session at a time in a private offi  ce 
with a single pair of participants. All neurocognitive training sessions are held for 
approximately 1 hour per week, and proceed in this fashion for a total of 60 hours 
over the course of treatment. 
 An example neurocognitive training exercise is the Attention Reaction 
Conditioner in the Orientation Remediation Module suite, which is designed to 
improve sustained attention and processing speed (Ben-Yishay et al., 1985). In 
this exercise, participants view a screen that contains a critical stimulus light in 
the center and nine feedback lights that form a pyramid across the screen (see 
Figure 14.1). Th e task for participants is to press the space bar as soon as the center 
light appears. Participants receive a preparatory auditory cue (a “warning” tone) to 
let them know the task is beginning, and then, 5 seconds later, the critical stimulus 
or target light illuminates. Based on their performance (speed), feedback lights 
will then illuminate, telling participants whether or not they responded quickly 
enough. If participants do not respond within a given window (e.g., 300 ms) only 
a portion of the feedback lights will appear, with the number illuminated depend-
ing on how far outside the stimulus window participants responded. Th e faster 
participants respond, the more feedback lights will appear, and all nine feedback 
lights will illuminate if the participant responds within the stimulus window.      
 To aid participants in the exercise, auditory cues are given before the target 
light presents. At the beginning of attention training with this exercise, partici-
pants are given fi ve auditory cues (one for each second) before the target appears. 
Gradually, these cues are faded, so that participants must begin to internalize 
the timing of when the target will appear. Th is greatly increases the diffi  culty of 
the task and promotes sustained attention. As participants progress further, the 
stimulus window is also reduced (e.g., from 300 ms to 170 ms), requiring them 
to not only sustain their attention for longer periods of time without cues, but 
to respond faster to the presentation of the target stimulus. In this fashion, the 
Attention Reaction Conditioner becomes a highly eff ective method for enhancing

processing speed and sustained attention. It is important to note that through-
out the neurocognitive training (attention, memory, and problem solving) par-
ticipants are encouraged to generate their own personal strategies for succeeding 
at the computer exercises. Th e role of the coach is to help facilitate this process, 
not to provide the strategy for the participant. Indeed, the process of developing 
strategies for solving the exercises is just as important as the particular strategy 
used in CET. Th e CET coach facilitates this process by encouraging self-refl ection, 
suggesting consultation with the participant’s computer partner, and the use of 
Socratic questioning to help individuals generate their own strategies. 
 Social-Cognitive Training 
 Overview 
 Th e enhancement of social cognition lies at the heart of CET. Neurocognitive 
training is designed to provide the requisite cognitive abilities needed to facilitate 
improved social cognition, but neurocognitive training alone does not provide the 
necessary strategies to address the social-cognitive defi cits experienced by patients 
with schizophrenia. Targeted strategies for enhancing social cognition specifi cally 
are needed, and in CET this accomplished through the social-cognitive group 
experience. Aft er approximately 3–6 months of attention training, three or four 
participant pairs join to form a social-cognitive group. A group-based approach 
to social-cognitive training, as opposed to individual or computer-based training, 
was adopted in CET because of the social nature of groups and their power for 
facilitating secondary socialization experiences. Much of the “social” in social cog-
nition would be lost from an individual or computer-based experience, whereas 
a group setting aff ords many opportunities to learn and practice social-cogni-
tive abilities in a more complex social setting. In addition, although studies have 
identifi ed individual defi cits in social cognition in schizophrenia (e.g., emotion 
perception, perspective taking), social-cognitive abilities are rarely performed in 
isolation in the real world, and the application of these abilities in a social setting 
oft en necessitates the use multiple aspects of social cognition in an integrated 
fashion that more closely resembles daily social interactions. 
 Group Content 
 Th ere are a total of 45 structured social-cognitive group sessions in CET, which 
are designed to facilitate key aspects of social cognition, including perspective 
taking, social context appraisal, foresightfulness, and emotion management. 
Social-cognitive groups integrate key psychoeducational content on social cog-
nition with experiential learning opportunities through various in-group cogni-
tive exercises, coaching, and homework assignments. Th e social-cognitive group 
curriculum is divided into three interrelated modules (see Table 14.1). Th e fi rst 
module (Basic Concepts) focuses on schizophrenia and its management and intro-
duces foundational concepts that are critical to subsequent sessions. Areas covered 
range from emotion regulation and stress management through the identifi cation 

346 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
of early distress cues and implementation of autoprotective coping strategies (e.g., 
diaphragmatic breathing) to increasing cognitive fl exibility, enhancing motiva-
tion, and obtaining the main point or “gist” in communications. 
 Th e second module (Social Cognition) focuses on key social-cognitive abilities 
(e.g., perspective taking, social context appraisal, reading nonverbal cues, using 
elaborated speech, and giving support) and encourages participants to practice 
using these abilities in their everyday life through related and structured home-
work assignments. Social-cognitive enhancement in CET centers around improv-
ing the ability of participants to take the perspective of others in unrehearsed 
social situations. As such, perspective taking becomes the unifying theme around 
which other social-cognitive concepts and abilities are learned. For example, 
social context appraisal refers to the ability to spontaneously extract the rules and 
norms of behavior in a given social situation, which requires eff ortful observation 
and understanding the perspectives of all participants involved in the interaction. 
Reading nonverbal cues is another essential social-cognitive ability emphasized 
in CET. As participants learn to understand the perspectives of others, they are 
coached to observe others’ feelings and behaviors, which are oft en most clearly 
stated through nonverbal behaviors such as facial expressions, posture, and tone 
of voice. Elaborated speech, which provides a shared context and allows others 
to understand the participant’s own perspective, is also a core social-cognitive 
strategy learned in the CET group. Many of these concepts are strengthened when 
participants learn the social-cognitive strategies of giving emotional support, 
including reading the nonverbal cues of the person in need of support, taking their 
perspective and “emotional temperature,” and conveying empathy. Experiential 
learning exercises are practiced to enhance these and other social-cognitive abili-
ties learned throughout the second module, along with psychoeducation on their 
use and importance. 
 Finally, the third module of the social-cognitive group curriculum (CET 
Applications) focuses on the generalization and application of CET concepts 
and social-cognitive abilities in daily life, and how to use the strategies and abili-
ties learned in CET to enhance the quality of one’s life (e.g., expanding social 
networks, initiating new vocational or educational activities, deepening existing 
relationships). Obstacles to implementing CET strategies are also identifi ed and 
addressed. 
 Group Structure 
 Each social-cognitive group session follows a very specifi c agenda that was 
designed to keep the group predictable and productive. Although the group 
sessions are highly structured, there remains ample opportunity for spontane-
ity and creativity within this format, while at the same time accomplishing the 
tasks of the particular group session. A typical social-cognitive group session 
includes several core components. First, one of the CET coaches provides a 
“Welcome Back” to participants and reviews the agenda for the session. Next, a 
group member volunteers to be the chairperson for the previous week’s home-
work assignment. Th e chairperson role is one of the many opportunities for 
www.ebook3000.com

Cognitive Enhancement Th erapy 
347
active participation in the group, as CET requires a great deal of active thinking 
and participation from group members, as opposed to a passive therapy group 
that only provides didactic instruction and problem solving for patients. Th e 
chairperson is in charge of calling on his or her peers to present their home-
work, as are the coaches who ask questions about the particular homework that 
is presented. Th e chairperson role provides many opportunities to integrate and 
utilize concepts that participants are learning in CET, such as motivation (e.g., 
volunteering to chair), strengthening working memory (e.g., keeping an online 
representation of the role of the chair and who has yet to present), and cognitive 
fl exibility (e.g., deciding how to handle situations in which multiple partici-
pants volunteer to present their homework at the same time). Elaboration and a 
deeper understanding of the concepts involved in the homework assignment are 
encouraged by the coaches, who always ask follow-up questions of each present-
ing participant and use Socratic questioning to increase his or her understand-
ing of the concepts. It is particularly rewarding as a CET coach to observe the 
growth in active thinking, abstraction, expressive language, and social under-
standing that participants exhibit during their homework presentations as they 
progress throughout the program. Once all participants, including the chair, 
have presented their homework assignment, the homework presentation com-
ponent of the session is concluded. 
 Aft er the homework presentation, selected participants engage in a cogni-
tive exercise designed to provide direct experiential learning opportunities for 
enhancing social cognition. Th ere are a total of nine thematic in-group exercises, 
each of which challenges participants to integrate and utilize the social-cognitive 
abilities that are being learned in the group. Variations of the nine thematic exer-
cises are repeated across a number of group sessions, so that all participants will 
have the opportunity to perform each exercise at least once. Exercises are center 
stage, and consist of designated group members moving to the front of the group 
to perform the activity. Participants are given a brief introduction to the exercise 
by one of the coaches, and then encouraged to “think on their feet” to solve the 
given problem in these minimally rehearsed and novel interpersonal situations. 
Every exercise requires, at a minimum, the use of perspective taking for its suc-
cessful completion. One example of an exercise that occurs during the second 
module of the group is known as “Condensed Messages.” In this exercise, two 
participants are given the background of a social problem that ultimately involves 
someone who needs to send a message to persuade another person to act in a 
specifi c way. For example, an individual traveling overseas for an important busi-
ness deal becomes sick with the fl u and needs his spouse to travel immediately to 
his location to close the deal for him. Participants are given relevant information 
about the social context (e.g., that the husband and wife have an excellent rela-
tionship, and that the wife can take a leave from her job at a moment’s notice), and 
are asked to construct a message that gets the recipient to act to solve the problem. 
A key challenge of this exercise is that the message must be brief (e.g., the husband 
can only send a 10-word telegram), but at the same time meaningful enough to 
encourage appropriate action. 

348 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
 Th e Condensed Message exercise requires the simultaneous use of many 
social-cognitive abilities. Participants must take the perspective of the sender to 
identify what action he would like the recipient to take (e.g., “come help close the 
business deal immediately”), as well as the perspective of the recipient to decipher 
what she must hear in order to act appropriately (e.g., that the husband needs 
immediate in-person help with the deal). Th e two participants must also appraise 
the social context and consider this information when formulating their message. 
For example, sending a message only indicating that the husband was sick and the 
wife needed to come quickly could lead her to believe he is seriously ill and prompt 
distress and perhaps a diff erent course of action than the desired one. Participants 
must work together to determine the main gist of the message they would like to 
send, within the allotted number of words that are permitted. Th roughout this 
and all other exercises in the social-cognitive group, participants must also be 
aware of their own emotions and anxieties about performing the exercise in front 
of the group, and work to manage these emotions to successfully complete the 
task. In this manner, the cognitive exercises become a primary vehicle for practic-
ing and promoting the use of various social-cognitive abilities and other concepts 
learned throughout CET. 
 During the fi nal module of the social-cognitive group curriculum, in-group 
cognitive exercises become particularly focused on facilitating the use of CET con-
cepts and strategies in everyday life, which is a theme that is repeated throughout 
the CET program. One example of a cognitive exercise in this module is “Using 
CET to Help a Friend.” In this exercise, participants are presented with a scenario 
(adapted from real-life situations encountered by previous patients) of a friend 
who is having diffi  culty in a social situation and is asking for help on what he 
or she might do to address the problem. For example, in one exercise, a friend 
who has been doing well and is hoping to move out of the family home to his 
own apartment comes to the participant asking for advice when his family is dis-
couraging his move. Th e friend feels hurt, as though his family is being negative 
and does not trust him. He would like to become more independent, but at the 
same time wants to keep the peace at home. Participants complete this exercise in 
pairs, with one of the participants presenting the problem and the other trying to 
help using CET strategies, such as perspective taking (e.g., of the friend with the 
problem and family members who have a valid concern), giving a motivational 
account (e.g., helping the friend develop a convincing explanation of why he feels 
ready to move that acknowledges the perspective of the family), active listening 
(e.g., not rushing to give advice and displaying empathic concern), cognitive fl ex-
ibility (e.g., that multiple perspectives are present in the scenario, and they must 
all be considered), and providing support (e.g., to the friend and the family). All 
participants eventually complete an exercise in which they have assumed both 
roles. Th e goal of this exercise is to facilitate the generalization of key CET “gists” 
and the use of independent, unrehearsed problem solving in common social 
dilemmas. Taken together, this exercise facilitates the review and consolidation of 
social-cognitive abilities learned throughout CET and promotes the generaliza-
tion of these abilities to common social dilemmas.

 While the selected participants complete the cognitive exercises, the remaining 
group members are tasked with organizing feedback to their peers about their 
performance using structured feedback sheets. Th is requires engagement and 
sustained attention for those not completing the exercise, and facilitates the use 
of social-cognitive abilities required in delivering feedback in a supportive and 
tactful manner. Aft er each participant provides feedback, the coaches in the group 
provide their feedback on the strengths they observed during the exercise, as well 
as on any areas that could be improved. As with any therapeutic message, feed-
back from the coaches (and peers) is largely positive and always supportive. Any 
critical feedback that is provided is accompanied by a clear and genuine identifi -
cation of the strengths of the participant’s performance and off ered in the spirit 
of helping the individual to continue to develop social wisdom and interpersonal 
eff ectiveness. 
 Aft er the completion of the cognitive exercise and feedback has been provided, 
a coach delivers a brief (10- to 15-minute) psychoeducational lecture on a new 
topic in social cognition. Topics for these lectures were gleaned from the larger 
developmental literature on the social-cognitive abilities needed for interpersonal 
success (e.g., Baldwin, 1992; Selman & Schultz, 1990). Careful attention is paid 
by the coach to deliver the lecture in an engaging manner and to direct the focus 
of the lecture to real-world considerations that are of importance to participants 
(e.g., why perspective-taking is important for improving relationships with family 
members or succeeding at a job interview). When the lecture is completed, the 
coach asks for any clarifying questions (which is also done frequently throughout 
the lecture), then assigns a homework assignment for the following week based 
on the lecture content. Homework is intended to facilitate the application of CET 
concepts to everyday life outside of the therapeutic context. A typical homework 
assignment asks participants to think about the social-cognitive concept under 
consideration and how it applies to their personal lives. For example, when learn-
ing about perspective taking, individuals are asked to think of a person whose 
perspective is particularly important to understand, and then discuss how they 
would arrive at an understanding of that person’s perspective given what they 
learned in the group. Finally, the time and date for the following group session 
is announced, and the group is adjourned. Each group session lasts 1.5 hours, 
and, given the amount of information covered in the social-cognitive groups, time 
management is essential. 
  Recovery Plans 
 As with any eff ective treatment, patients arrive at CET with a unique set of per-
sonal goals and diffi  culties, and an eff ective treatment must incorporate these 
personal considerations to tailor intervention strategies to the diff erent circum-
stances of the patient. In CET, treatment is individualized through the develop-
ment of recovery plans, which target a participant’s goal, the problem he or she is 
encountering that stands in the way of achieving the goal, and the CET strategies 
that he or she can use to work toward overcoming the problem and improving 
his or her life. With the help of the coach, participants develop recovery plans 

350 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
that are specifi c to each individual and obtainable in the time frame of CET. If 
long-term goals that are beyond the scope of CET are identifi ed, the coach helps 
participants break these into a series of short-term goals that can be addressed in 
CET. Example recovery plans are provided in Table 14.2. Th e recovery plans are 
written on large poster boards and displayed during the social-cognitive group 
sessions, to help apply the content of the group to the personal goals of each of 
the members. Initial recovery plans are created at the beginning of the social-
cognitive groups. Midway through the CET program, participants are asked to 
review the progress they have made on their initial recovery plan, and then a new 
recovery plan is formulated that incorporates their increased understanding of 
their social-cognitive diffi  culties in light of what they have learned thus far during 
the group. Final recovery plans are developed near the completion of the group, 
and serve to provide guidance and direction to participants as they graduate from 
CET and move toward an independent application of what they have learned to 
their daily lives. When helping individuals develop their recovery plan, the coach 
integrates the comprehensive neurocognitive and social-cognitive training strate-
gies of CET to provide a meaningful treatment experience to participants that is

clear in its aim to help them achieve their own personal goals and enhance their 
quality of life. 
 Individual Therapy 
 Th e primary therapeutic components of CET are the neurocognitive computer 
training and social-cognitive group curriculum. All of these aspects of the inter-
vention are conducted in groups, whether they be a pair (for neurocognitive train-
ing) or a small group (for social-cognitive training) of participants. Individual 
meetings between participants and CET coaches address personal issues in the 
participant’s life, review initial assessments, assist with developing recovery plans, 
and provide individual coaching on some CET homework assignments and exer-
cises. All participants who enter the CET program are assigned a primary coach, 
who meets with the participant individually and frequently leads exercises involv-
ing the participant in the social-cognitive group. Th e need for individual sessions 
varies among participants; however, in the beginning of treatment, it is essential 
that coaches meet with their participant weekly to begin building a strong thera-
peutic relationship. 
 Individual therapy sessions also provide the opportunity to reinforce key CET 
concepts that are learned throughout the group. For example, during the early 
stages of the social-cognitive group curriculum, participants may still have con-
siderable ambivalence about the need for medications, which would be inap-
propriate to discuss at length during group sessions. Th e coach uses individual 
sessions with the participant to review his or her medication history, note pat-
terns of emerging illness that are associated with medication nonadherence, and 
share information about the likelihood of psychotic relapse when medication is 
not used. As individuals learn autoprotective strategies for managing stress and 
arousal during the early group curriculum, the coach encourages participants to 
recognize their early cues of stress and to apply healthy autoprotective strategies 
promptly. As participants gain more understanding of social cognition, the coach 
is always mindful to reinforce such CET strategies as perspective taking, giving a 
motivational account, and social context appraisal when participants discuss their 
interpersonal and social activities or concerns. In this fashion, the individual ses-
sions help to further tailor CET to the individual needs of the participant. 
 Finally, individual sessions are particularly helpful when issues arise that are 
not the focus of the neurocognitive training or social-cognitive curriculum. Th e 
emphasis of CET is on improving cognition, not discussing residual symptoma-
tology, paranoid delusional systems, or diffi  culties obtaining needed resources. Of 
course, during the 18- to 24-month period of receiving CET, it is not uncommon 
for these issues to occur among individuals with schizophrenia, and the coach 
should actively address these issues in individual sessions. Th e recurrence of psy-
chotic symptoms can happen even when individuals faithfully take medication as 
prescribed, and the CET coach may be the fi rst to discuss these symptoms with 
the participant. Changes in entitlements, housing, and other resource issues also 

352 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
can lead to stress and very signifi cant life problems. Individual sessions give the 
participant an opportunity to discuss these issues in a more private setting. Since 
the emphasis of CET is on the improvement of cognition, the CET coach usually 
does not attempt to address these problems themselves, but calls upon local psy-
chiatric and other resources that specialize in treating the presenting problem. 
 IMPLEMENTATION 
 Th e implementation of evidence-based practices in community mental health 
settings is of paramount importance, and it remains an area in which provid-
ers, policymakers, and researchers have not traditionally excelled. CET contains 
several key elements that facilitate its implementation in the community mental 
health centers that provide the majority of care for patients with schizophrenia. 
A group-based approach is oft en more economically feasible than an approach 
that consists primarily of individual-based therapy. Th is enables a greater 
patient-to-session ratio, which maximizes the use of therapist time, while still 
providing substantial benefi ts to the patient. In addition, a comprehensive treat-
ment and training manual has been developed for CET (Hogarty & Greenwald, 
2006), which includes highly specifi c, session-by-session guidance on the imple-
mentation of CET. Further, the evidence of the benefi ts of CET from two National 
Institutes of Health (NIH)-supported clinical trials (Eack et al., 2009; Hogarty et 
al., 2004) has supported third-party reimbursement of the treatment, which is 
essential for sustained implementation. 
 Community agencies interested in implementing CET will need a few addi-
tional resources. Th e CET training manual and accompanying supplemental 
CD-ROM are essential for obtaining information on how to implement and use 
the approach in patients with schizophrenia, as well as in obtaining the treatment 
materials that are utilized in the neurocognitive and social-cognitive groups. In 
addition, the neurocognitive training soft ware from Ben-Yishay (Orientation 
Remediation Module) and Bracy (PSSCogRehab) are required for the attention, 
memory, and problem-solving training that occurs in CET. Beyond these initial 
costs, most community agencies already have the necessary resources for imple-
menting CET. An offi  ce with a single computer is needed for neurocognitive 
training, and a medium-sized conference or group room is needed for conducting 
the social-cognitive groups. Th e neurocognitive training soft ware is designed to 
operate on almost any existing PC-compatible computer. A white board is needed 
in the group room for cognitive exercises and developing patients’ recovery plans, 
and large poster boards are needed for displaying fi nalized versions of the initial 
and interim recovery plans during the group. A Velcro board or cork board is also 
needed for one of the group exercises. A black-and-white printer is necessary for 
printing agendas, treatment handouts, and computer scoring sheets for partici-
pants, and three-ring binders are used to help participants organize the treatment 
materials they receive.

 Staffi  ng considerations are very important in conducting CET. Eff ective CET 
coaches can come from many disciplines, as social workers, psychologists, 
nurses, and other mental health professionals have all been trained to success-
fully provide CET in previous research studies. An interdisciplinary team is pre-
ferred, if possible, to bring in the diff erent background and training experiences 
that oft en create a rich and eff ective treatment team. Individual coaches should 
have, at a minimum, master’s-level preparation in a mental health profession 
and several years of direct clinical experience with patients with schizophre-
nia. Beyond these basic qualifi cations, individuals must be interested in learn-
ing a new approach, open to diff erent styles of treatment, and passionate about 
helping patients with schizophrenia. Th e active nature of the social-cognitive 
groups places signifi cant demands on the coaches, and thus at least two coaches 
are necessary for conducting these groups. CET is an agency- or center-based 
intervention. It is unlikely that it would be feasible to implement CET in a pri-
vate practice setting. Support from agency leadership to provide the time and 
resources necessary for staff  to learn and provide CET is essential for eff ective 
implementation.  
 CONCLUSION 
 CET is a unique and comprehensive approach to the remediation of social and 
nonsocial cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. Th e intervention eff ectively 
integrates computer-based training in attention, memory, and problem solving, 
with a social-cognitive group curriculum designed to enhance perspective tak-
ing, social context appraisal, gistfulness, and other important aspects of social 
cognition. Clinical trials of CET in schizophrenia have consistently documented 
its benefi ts on cognition and functioning (Eack et al., 2009; Hogarty et al., 2004), 
with recent evidence indicating a neuroprotective benefi t of CET for patients in 
the early course of the disorder (Eack et al., 2010b). Th e integration of neurocog-
nitive and social-cognitive training is viewed as a helpful combination by patients, 
who consistently engage and succeed in the program. Patients appreciate that CET 
is personalized, targets areas that are problematic for them, and increases their 
strengths. Th e demonstrated effi  cacy of CET, its emphasis on personal recovery, 
and its acceptability to patients all make this cognitive rehabilitation approach 
a particularly eff ective adjunct to pharmacotherapy for enhancing quality of life 
and facilitating a greater functional recovery among the many patients who live 
with schizophrenia.

 Despite their widespread usage, neuroleptic agents do not provide lasting and 
comprehensive treatment success in many patients with schizophrenia. One-third 
of all patients are neuroleptic-resistant (Elkis, 2007; Lindenmayer, 2000), and 
the mean eff ect size of neuroleptics above placebo is only in the medium range 
(Leucht, Arbter, Engel, Kissling, & Davis, 2009). Even for those who benefi t from 
neuroleptic administration, treatment can oft en come at a considerable cost in 
view of side eff ects, particularly neurological symptoms under fi rst-generation 
neuroleptic agents, and metabolic symptoms, such as weight gain and diabetes 
under some second-generation agents (Haddad & Sharma, 2007; Rummel-Kluge 
et al., 2010). In addition to side eff ects, poor therapeutic alliance, lack of insight 
(Bora, Sehitoglu, Aslier, Atabay, & Veznedaroglu, 2007; Buchy, Malla, Joober, & 
Lepage, 2009), and memory problems (Moritz et al., 2009) are reasons why up to 
three-quarters of patients withdraw medication aft er hospital discharge (Byerly, 
Nakonezny, & Lescoufl air, 2007; Lieberman et al., 2005). 
 Th e complacency that followed the introduction of atypical neuroleptics has 
led to a sober reassessment of the benefi ts and risks of neuroleptic treatment. Th e 
initial enthusiasm about the benefi ts of atypical drugs has markedly diminished 
in recent years (Davis, Chen, & Glick, 2003; Lehrer, 2010). In addition, the role 
of psychotherapy is being reconsidered, and psychological models and treatment 
approaches now face less skepticism. An extensive line of research has put forward 
evidence for contributions of neuropsychological defi cits (Schretlen et al., 2007) 
and, more recently, cognitive biases (Bell, Halligan, & Ellis, 2006; Freeman, 2007) 
in the pathogenesis of psychosis. Results from basic research are increasingly 
translated into treatment programs (Roder & Medalia, 2010). So far, the most 
eff ective psychological treatment of psychosis appears to be cognitive-behavioral

therapy (CBT), which exerts a small to medium eff ect size as an add-on treatment 
to neuroleptics (Wykes, Steel, Everitt, & Tarrier, 2008), although—as in other psy-
chological disorders—dissemination is scarce (Shafran et al., 2009). 
 Psychopharmacology and psychotherapy should be seen as complementary 
rather than as rivals or counterexclusive interventions. For example, psychophar-
macology is oft en a prerequisite for psychotherapy in order to mute agitation, 
formal thought disorder, and hostility, which may undermine or even preclude 
a therapeutic relationship. Psychotherapy, in turn, improves the person’s under-
standing of his or her symptoms and thereby oft en ameliorates medication 
adherence. Tentative evidence suggests that the routes of action are very diff er-
ent (Birchwood & Trower, 2006; Moritz et al., 2009); neuroleptics provide some 
detachment and emotional numbing but do not alter belief conviction (Mizrah 
et al., 2006), whereas psychotherapy can enhance illness insight and decreases 
stress. 
 METACOGNITIVE TRAINING FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA: OVERVIEW 
 Metacognitive training (MCT; from  metacognition , “thinking about one’s think-
ing”) is a novel approach founded in the tradition of psychoeducation, cognitive 
remediation, social cognition training and CBT. It is now in its fourth edition, and 
has been translated into 29 languages. MCT targets cognitive biases putatively 
involved in delusion formation, for which patients oft en lack adequate awareness 
(see next section). Another explicit aim of MCT is to foster improved social cog-
nition and theory of mind (ToM; for an overview see Moritz, Vitzthum, Randjbar, 
Veckenstedt, & Woodward, 2010; Moritz & Woodward, 2007b). Th e training is 
highly structured, as we endeavored to keep preparation time short and thus facil-
itate its dissemination. Depending on the group’s level of understanding, the text 
should be read or paraphrased. A friendly and humorous atmosphere should be 
created, and the exercises should be delivered in an entertaining, interactive, and 
playful fashion. Th e present program can be downloaded free of charge via the 
following link: www.uke.de/mkt. Table 15.1 summarizes the eight modules of the 
MCT along with target domains and learning aims. 
 Th e main objective of the MCT program is to raise the patient’s awareness of cog-
nitive biases (e.g., jumping to conclusions) and to prompt him or her to critically 
refl ect on, complement, and alter his or her current repertoire of problem-solving 
and thinking skills. Longitudinal studies (Klosterk ö tter, 1992) assert that psycho-
sis is not a sudden and inevitable event but is oft en preceded by a gradual change 
in the evaluation of one’s cognitions and (social) environment over several weeks. 
Th e route into psychotic breakdown is thus not necessarily a one-way street, but is 
a potentially reversible process. Empowering metacognitive competency by rais-
ing awareness for cognitive biases may then act prophylactically against psychotic 
breakdown. 
 Th e training is delivered by a health care professional in a group of 3–10 schizo-
phrenia spectrum patients. Although trainers should preferably be psychologists 

 Table 15.1   Summary of Each Metacognitive Training Module (Group Sessions) 
Module
Target domain
Description of core exercises and learning aims
(1) Attribution: 
blaming and 
taking credit
Monocausal 
inferences
Diff erent causes of positive and negative events should be contemplated. Participants are taught to 
consider various causes instead of converging on monocausal explanations. For example, “a friend 
was talking behind your back”; dominant interpretation: “friend is not trustworthy” (blaming others); 
alternatives: “I have done something bad” (blaming self), “she is preparing a surprise party for my 
birthday” (circumstances). Th e negative consequences of a self-serving attribution are repeatedly 
highlighted.
(2) Jumping to 
conclusions I
Jumping to 
conclusions/
liberal acceptance
Motifs contributing to hasty decision making are discussed and disadvantages of jumping to 
conclusions are highlighted. Fragmented pictures are shown that eventually display objects. Premature 
decisions oft en lead to errors, emphasizing the benefi ts of cautious data gathering.
In the second part, ambiguous pictures are displayed. Here, a quick survey leads to the omission of 
details, demonstrating that fi rst impressions, in many cases, only reveal half the truth.
(3) Changing 
beliefs
Bias against 
disconfi rmatory 
evidence
Cartoon sequences are shown in reverse order, which increasingly disambiguate a complex scenario. 
Aft er each (new) picture, participants are asked to (re-)rate the plausibility of four interpretations. On 
some pictures, participants are “led up the garden path.” Th us, participants learn to withhold strong 
judgments until suffi  cient evidence has been collected, and they are encouraged to maintain an open 
attitude toward counterarguments and alternative views.
(4) To empathize I
Th eory of mind 
fi rst order
Facial expression and other cues are discussed for their relevance to social reasoning. Th en, pictures 
of human faces are presented in the exercises. Th e group should guess what emotions the depicted 
character(s) may feel. Th e correct solution oft en violates the fi rst intuition, demonstrating that reliance 
on facial expression alone can be misleading and that response confi dence needs to be attenuated when 
the available evidence is insuffi  cient.
In the second part, cartoon strips are shown that either must be completed or brought into the correct 
order. Participants are shown that social inferences should involve multiple pieces of evidence.
www.ebook3000.com

(5) Memory
Over-confi dence 
in errors
Factors that foster or impair memory acquisition are discussed fi rst, and examples for common 
false memories are presented. Th en, prototypical scenes (e.g., beach) are displayed with two typical 
elements each removed (e.g., towel, ball). Owing to logical inference, gist-based recollection, and 
liberal acceptance, many patients falsely recognize these lure items in a later recognition trial with high 
confi dence. Th e constructive rather than passive nature of memory is thus brought to the participants’ 
attention. Participants are taught to diff erentiate between false and correct memories by means of the 
vividness heuristic.
(6) To empathize 
II
Th eory of mind 
second order/need 
for closure
Diff erent aspects guiding theory of mind (e.g., language) are discussed with respect to both their 
heuristic value and fallibility for social decision making. Th en, cartoon sequences are presented, and the 
perspective of one of the protagonists must be taken, which involves discounting knowledge available to 
the observer but not available to the protagonist. For the majority of sequences, no defi nitive solutions 
can be inferred, which is unsatisfactory for patients with an enhanced need for closure.
(7) Jumping to 
conclusions II
Jumping to 
conclusions/
liberal acceptance
As in module 2, the disadvantages of quick decision making are emphasized with multiple examples. 
In the exercises, paintings are displayed for which the correct title must be deduced from four response 
options. On superfi cial inspection, many pictures tempt false responses.
(8) Mood and 
self-esteem
Mood and 
self-esteem
First, depressive symptoms, causes for depression, and treatment options are discussed. Th en, typical 
depressive cognitive patterns are presented (e.g., overgeneralization, selective abstraction), and the 
group is asked to come up with more constructive and positive ones. At the end, some strategies are 
conveyed to help patients transform negative self-schemata and elevate their mood.

or psychiatrists who have experience with schizophrenia spectrum disorder 
patients, psychiatric nurses, social workers, and occupational therapists may also 
be eligible. For example, our groups in Hamburg are run by psychology students 
receiving extensive training and supervision. 
 The MCT comprises eight modules that consist of a series of PDF-converted 
slide shows that should be displayed via a video projector onto a white wall or 
screen. For several languages, two parallel cycles are now available that allow 
participants to undergo two sessions for each target domain, with new exam-
ples. Each session should not last longer than 60 minutes, as many patients 
have a poor attention span. As each module contains more exercises than 
can be accomplished in this timeframe, the trainer can choose among the 
extensive material and should skip ahead to the learning aims when the allot-
ted 45–60 minutes is nearing completion. Trainers may well deviate from the 
slides, or blend the MCT with alternative therapeutic techniques. For exam-
ple, the vignettes in module 1 which deal with attributional style (e.g., you 
failed an exam) can be used to stage role-play, as in social competence train-
ing. An administration mode of two sessions per week is advantageous (at one 
module per session, a full cycle can be completed in 4 weeks) to ensure that 
participants undergo as many sessions as possible. The group is open; that 
is, participants may enter at any module (each module deals with a separate 
bias and the contents are independent), so that there is no fixed group. This 
procedure has some advantages over fixed groups, as open groups do not as 
easily “dry out.” 
 Each module follows a certain sequence: (1) an introduction demonstrating 
how cognitive biases and social misinterpretations/misunderstandings impact 
our everyday lives (the “normalizing” phase); (2) relationship of extreme forms 
of the respective bias/problem with mental illness in general and psychosis in 
particular (the slide entitled “Why are we doing this?”); (3) exercises highlight-
ing the dysfunctionality of the respective bias/problems (corrective experiences); 
(4) summary of learning aims; and (5) case example(s) emphasizing the relation-
ship between cognitive biases and psychosis. During the training, videos may be 
shown that can be downloaded at Google/video (search with the key term “meta-
cognitive training”) or are available at the bottom of our webpage at www.uke.de/
mkt. Finally, leafl ets with homework are handed out. 
 Aft er his or her fi rst session, each participant should receive a yellow card and 
a red card (again, templates can be downloaded from the MCT website). Th e yel-
low card raises three fundamental questions that a patient should consider when 
feeling off ended, persecuted, or insulted:
 What is the evidence? 
1. 
  Are there alternative views? 
2. 
  Even if it’s like that . . . am I overreacting? 
3. 
 Th ese questions are intended to prompt participants to master critical situa-
tions and to avoid hasty and consequential decisions. On the red card, the patient

is encouraged to write down names and telephone numbers of persons and/or 
institutions that may help in case of crisis or breakdown. 
 Th e exercises demonstrate how cognitive biases—which are almost normal, 
benign, and sometimes even functional when presenting in a subtle degree 
(decisiveness as the bright side of jumping to conclusions; perseverance as the 
bright side of incorrigibility; self-certainty as the bright side of overconfi dence in 
errors)—as well as problems with social cognition can escalate into troublesome 
situations. It is assumed that these biases may separately or in combination culmi-
nate in the formation of beliefs that may eventually become delusions (Bentall et 
al., 2009; Moritz, Veckenstedt, Hottenrott et al., 2010). In the next section, empiri-
cal evidence for the presence of problematic thinking styles in schizophrenia is 
summarized. We also subsequently explain how these are dealt with in the dif-
ferent modules of the MCT (for a summary, see Table 15.1). Th e following biases 
and problems are at the core of the MCT: attributional style (module 1), jump-
ing to conclusions (JTC; modules 2 and 7), bias against disconfi rmatory evidence 
(BADE; module 3), social cognition/ToM (modules 4 and 6), overconfi dence in 
memory errors (module 5), and depressive cognitive patterns and low self-esteem 
(module 8). In the closing section, several recommendations for administration 
are provided. 
 COGNITIVE BIASES IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 
 A psychological or cognitive understanding of delusion formation has long 
been obstructed by claims that delusions are not amenable to understanding. 
Beginning in the 1980s, however, cognitive research has questioned strong for-
mulations of this account. Several meaningful cognitive mechanisms have been 
implicated in the pathogenesis of fi xed false beliefs (i.e., delusions). Th ese will be 
described in the following sections, which will fi rst present the theory and empiri-
cal  evidence and then show how they are dealt with in the MCT. 
 Attributional Style: Theory 
 As dynamic theorists like Adler (1914/1929) had already reasoned at the begin-
ning of the last century, patients with schizophrenia show deviances in attribu-
tional style, specifi cally a tendency to blame others for own failure ( scapegoating ). 
In contrast, healthy people are more likely to attribute blame to circumstances and 
are less prone to monocausal inferences than are patients (Randjbar, Veckenstedt, 
Vitzthum, Hottenrott, & Moritz, 2011). Deviances of attributional style in schizo-
phrenia are virtually undisputed, but the exact signature is not consensually 
determined. Early research (Bentall, 1994) found a self-serving bias (attribution 
of success to oneself, attribution of failure to others or circumstances), whereas 
a common denominator of more recent research, which oft en used the Internal, 
Personal and Situational Attributions Questionnaire (IPSAQ; Kinderman & 

364 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
Bentall, 1997) was the personalization of blame to others (Kinderman & Bentall, 
1997). Our group (Moritz, Woodward, Burlon, Braus, & Andresen, 2007) and 
Lincoln et al. (2010) found a general externalization style indicating a form of 
helplessness and loss of control: Patients deem others responsible for good and 
bad things in their lives more than do healthy subjects. 
 Problems with attributional style have been linked with self-uncertainty 
and a deep-rooted low self-esteem (Bentall, Corcoran, Howard, Blackwood, & 
Kinderman, 2001) that is addressed in module 8 of the MCT. 
 Dealing with Attributional Style in the MCT (Modules 1 and 8) 
 In module 1 (Attribution: Blaming and Taking Credit), participants are fi rst 
familiarized with the concept of attribution. It is made clear that three major 
sources may determine or infl uence an outcome: oneself, other persons, and/or 
circumstances. Th ese infl uences usually act in combination rather than alone, and 
participants should thus resist the tendency to rely on only one explanation. Th e 
social consequences of diff erent attributional styles are highlighted (e.g., blaming 
others for failure may lead to interpersonal tensions). Th e following exercises are 
inspired by the IPSAQ, which confronts the subject with complex social events for 
which situational as well as personal factors have to be taken into account (for an 
example, see Figure 15.1). Diff erent possible explanations should be considered 
(e.g., “A friend says you do not look good”; possible explanations may be that you 
have been ill, harsh neon light, an insult, true concern). Group members are made 
aware that monocausal inferences are unlikely, and that it can be helpful to gener-
ate alternative explanations. 
 Figure 15.1      In module 1 (attributional style), group members must discuss possible 
reasons for the occurrence of complex scenarios. Here: routine control (possible), driving 
at too high speed (possible), policeman is in bad mood and stops people driving non-U.S. 
car brands (unlikely). Monocausal inferences should be avoided. (Permission to repro-

 Jumping to Conclusions and Need for Closure: Theory 
 Garety and coworkers were among the fi rst (e.g., Garety, Hemsley, & Wessely, 
1991; Huq, Garety, & Hemsley, 1988) to systematically investigate information 
acquisition preferences in schizophrenia. Following their seminal work, an exten-
sive literature has asserted that patients with schizophrenia are hasty in their deci-
sion making (for a review, see Fine, Gardner, Craigie, & Gold, 2007). Th is line 
of research has been mainly conducted with the beads task, and a variant of the 
task is illustrated in Figure 15.2. Usually, 40%–70% of the patients show jumping 
to conclusions (JTC) in this task. In recent studies, we found that patients do not 
only collect less information but also weigh information inadequately (Gl ö ckner 
& Moritz, 2009). Jumping to conclusions is intuitive and almost a literal descrip-
tion of schizophrenia delusions, which oft en rely on scarce pseudo-“evidence” 
(e.g., a sudden police siren and an unfriendly remark by a waitress are taken as 
solid evidence that the village is populated by “evil rednecks” who will hunt the 
patient down at night), but according to several studies, JTC, is also measurable 
in nondelusional scenarios. 
 Jumping to conclusions is thought to play an important role in the formation 
and maintenance of the disorder and is unlikely to represent a mere epiphenom-
enon of delusions. Th is is supported by the fact that it occurs in psychosis-prone 
but nonclinical participants (Freeman, Pugh, & Garety, 2008; Van Dael et al., 
2006) and can be detected using delusion-neutral material, such as the beads task. 
 Figure 15.2   Example of the so-called Fish task, a variant of the “Beads task” (Moritz, 
Veckenstedt, Hottenrott et al., 2010; Speechley, Whitman, & Woodward, 2010; 
Woodward, Munz, Leclerc, & Lecomte, 2009). Subjects are asked to deduce from which 
of two lakes a fi sherman is catching fi sh. A decision aft er only one (or sometimes 
two) fi sh is considered evidence for jumping to conclusions. Approximately 40%–70% 
of schizophrenia patients arrive at a decision aft er only one fi sh (or bead), whereas 
most controls wait for several fi sh or beads until they decide. Figure created for MCT 
Working Group.

Although poor motivation and memory have been ruled out as contributors to 
JTC, some authors implicate low intelligence as a moderator (Lincoln, Ziegler, 
Mehl, & Rief, 2010). Other research fi ndings suggest that JTC is a special case of 
liberal acceptance (Moritz & Woodward, 2004; Moritz, Woodward, & Hausmann, 
2006; Moritz, Woodward, & Lambert, 2007) or hypersalience of evidence-hypoth-
esis matches (Speechley, Whitman, & Woodward, 2010; Balzan et al., 2012). 
Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that patients are largely unaware of their 
hastiness and oft en view themselves as rather hesitant and indecisive (Freeman 
et al., 2006; Moritz, Kuepper, Veckenstedt, Randjbar, & Hottenrott, unpublished 
manuscript). 
 Dealing with Jumping to Conclusions in the MCT (Modules 2 and 7) 
 Aft er discussing the advantages (e.g., saving time and cognitive eff ort) and dis-
advantages of JTC (e.g., risk to make false decisions) at the start of both module 
2 and 7, participants are introduced to drastic historical errors induced by JTC. 
Th en, “urban legends” are discussed (e.g., that the Ku Klux Klan owns Marlboro). 
Arguments for and especially against these beliefs are displayed, exchanged, and 
evaluated for their plausibility among group members.  1 
 Th e exercises from the fi rst task set of module 2 are picture fragments that 
eventually display common objects (e.g., a pig; see Figure 15.3). At each stage, the 
plausibility of either self-generated or prespecifi ed response alternatives should be 
rated. Participants are encouraged to make a decision once they feel entirely sure, 
and all the material was created in such a way that premature decisions lead to 
errors, thus providing corrective experiences (“seeing is believing”). 
 An edited example of the second task set is shown in Figure 15.4. Here, com-
plex pictures are shown, which, depending on the observer’s perspective, contain 
two diff erent objects/scenes. Group members are asked to give their fi rst impres-
sion of the picture, and then to change their perspective in order to generate an 
alternative solution. Th us, participants are trained to avoid succumbing to fi rst 
 Figure 15.3      Brain, back of a man . . . or pig? In module 2 (jumping to conclusions I), 
participants are shown a fragmented object that is displayed with increasing details (for 
display purposes only, two out of the eight stages are shown). Hasty decisions oft en lead 
to wrong judgments, thus demonstrating the dysfunctionality of jumping to conclusions.

 Bias Against Disconﬁ rmatory Evidence (BADE): Theory 
 Incorrigibility is a hallmark criterion feature of delusions. Th e strong infl exibil-
ity seen during delusions (e.g., dismissing arguments proposed by relatives about 
impressions, which may turn out to be incorrect (fi rst task set) or reveal only half 
truths (second task set). Th ese perhaps abstract examples are substantiated by 
case stories and videos (see bottom of www.uke.de/mkt or enter “metacognitive 
training” as a keyword when searching in http://video.google.de). 
 In the exercises of module 7 (jumping to conclusions II), participants have to 
deduce the correct title for classical paintings (see Figure 15.5). Many of them 
contain cues for the correct solution that may be easily missed upon superfi cial 
inspection. Here, participants should be shown that a thorough search is perhaps 
more time-consuming but ensures a more reliable judgment.       
 Figure 15.4  In task set 2 of module 2 (jumping to conclusions I), picture puzzles with 
two diff erent objects or scenes are presented (e.g., saxophone player vs. woman’s face). 
Th e learning aim is to point out that hasty decisions oft en reveal only half the truth.

response option b). Closer inspection oft en reveals several hints that speak for the correct 
solution (here, book, devices on the table) and at the same time speak against alternative 
titles. (Figure created by Johann Peter von Langer.)

why the CIA is, in fact, not interested in the patient) extends to nondelusional con-
tents. For this line of research, the bias against disconfi rmatory evidence (BADE) 
paradigm has been employed (Veckenstedt et al., 2001; Woodward, Buchy, 
Moritz, & Liotti, 2007; Woodward, Moritz, & Chen, 2006; Woodward, Moritz, 
Cuttler, & Whitman, 2006; Woodward, Moritz, Menon, & Klinge, 2008). In a stan-
dard BADE item, the subject is confronted with increasing pieces of information 
(sequences of three sentences or pictures). Th e fi rst and sometimes also the sec-
ond sentence or picture lures the subject into false assumptions that are eventually 
disconfi rmed by subsequent information. In order to obscure the rationale of the 
test, control trials are presented in which the fi rst sentence correctly suggests the 
solution. Patients with schizophrenia typically are more easily “led up the garden 
path” for BADE items than are healthy and even psychiatric controls. Patients 
with schizophrenia are less able to disengage from initially plausible interpreta-
tions, which, over the course of three trials, become more and more implausible. 
Th is eff ect was demonstrated in both fi rst-episode (Woodward, Moritz, & Chen, 
2006) and predominantly chronic patients (Moritz & Woodward, 2006), as well 
as in healthy participants scoring high on delusional ideation (Buchy, Woodward, 
& Liotti, 2007). In some studies, this bias was more pronounced in currently 
deluded patients (Woodward, Moritz, & Chen, 2006; Woodward, Moritz, Cuttler 
et al., 2006), but it is as yet unclear under which conditions a BADE is a state or 
trait marker of the illness. 
 Dealing with Bias Against Disconﬁ rmatory Evidence 
in Schizophrenia in the MCT (Module 3) 
 At the beginning of module 3, participants are encouraged to discuss the advan-
tages and disadvantages of infl exibility. For example, hard-headedness is a com-
mon human feature and, in a mild form, can also be functional (e.g., to overcome 
obstacles when pursuing one’s goals). Th en, historical examples and case samples 
are conveyed showing how incorrigibility has led to big problems, to the point 
of disastrous events or delusions (case examples). Following this, an example of 
the so-called confi rmation bias is presented: three (diff erent) types of fl owers 
are displayed (parallel version: fruits). Subjects are asked to deduce the corre-
sponding higher level category by proposing items that may also fi t that category 
(superordinate categories: living beings; parallel version: food). Th e presented 
objects mislead many persons to believe the to-be-identifi ed superordinate cat-
egory is  fl owers . Th erefore, most people generate objects that  only fi t this category, 
instead of contemplating alternative hypotheses. Th e confi rmation bias refl ects 
the human tendency to ignore information that does not match a person’s atti-
tudes or expectations. 
 Th e subsequent exercises consist of a series of three pictures shown in reverse 
order. Some of these were employed in the studies mentioned above. Th e 
sequences of pictures gradually disambiguate a complex plot (see Figure 15.6). 
For each picture, participants are asked to discuss the plausibility of four 
www.ebook3000.com

Metacognitive Training in Schizophrenia 
369
diff erent interpretations. Aft er each picture, they should state if their opinions 
have changed. Th e correct interpretation is highlighted at the end of each trial. For 
the BADE trails, which represent the majority of items, one of the four interpreta-
tions appears improbable upon the presentation of the fi rst picture, but eventually 
is true. Two of the other interpretations seem plausible upon the presentation of 
the fi rst (and sometimes even second) picture, but are eventually incorrect (lure 
interpretations). Participants should learn to search for more information before 
making defi nite judgments, and to stay open-minded and correct themselves if 
disconfi rmatory evidence is encountered. 
 Social Cognition: Theory 
 Perhaps beginning with the pioneer work of Frith and coworkers (Frith, 1994; 
Frith & Corcoran, 1996), cognitive research on schizophrenia has increasingly 
embraced the social cognitive domain, which is oft en subsumed under the 
umbrella term “theory of mind.” Th eory of mind encompasses a wide range of 
aspects, including knowledge about “unwritten social rules,” social competence, 
emotion recognition, and social reasoning. (For a more in-depth overview on 
ToM, see Abu-Akel & Shamay-Tsoory [2013], Chapter 8, this volume.) Although 
 Figure 15.6  Preach water, drink wine? Module 3 teaches that things are oft en diff er-
ent than they appear at fi rst sight. Th ree pictures are shown successively along with four 
response alternatives (fi rst, picture 3 only; then, pictures 3 and 2 together; subsequently, 
all pictures together; the correct solution is highlighted at the end). Information in the 
fi rst picture (marked with the number 3) misleads to false responses (especially response 
options 2 or 4). However, the subsequent pictures make clear that option 1 is the most 
plausible alternative, thereby demonstrating the dysfunctionality of infl exibility. (Figure 
created by Benny-Kristin Fischer for MCT Working Group.)

perhaps not specifi c to patients with schizophrenia (e.g., Kerr, Dunbar, & Bentall, 
2003; Uekermann et al., 2008), defi cits in social cognition are frequently observed 
in psychosis (Br ü ne, 2005), and interpersonal confl icts deriving from social cog-
nitive impairments are likely to fuel psychotic symptoms (Moritz, Veckenstedt, 
Hottenrott et al., 2010). In recent years, programs have been developed, for exam-
ple, Social Cognition and Interaction Training (SCIT; see Combs, Torres, & Basso 
[2013], Chapter 16, this volume), that target this important aspect. As with other 
cognitive defi cits and biases, patients are mostly not adequately aware that their 
behavior is inappropriate or maybe even appear impolite at times. Reviews and 
meta-analyses assert substantial defi cits for ToM in schizophrenia. Th e symptom 
correlates are equivocal, however (Br ü ne, 2005). Although some studies found 
correlations with positive symptoms (Mehl et al., 2010), the preponderance of 
the evidence suggests that ToM defi cits are tied to disorganized patients (Sprong, 
Schothorst, Vos, Hox, & van Engeland, 2007) or negative symptoms (Brune, 2005; 
Woodward et al., 2009). Th e question of whether ToM is a state or trait has not yet 
been resolved, but there is evidence that ToM defi cits are also present in remission 
(Bora, Yucel, & Pantelis, 2009). 
 Dealing with Social Cognition in the MCT (Modules 4 and 6) 
 Module 4 is primarily devoted to fi rst-order ToM and emotion recognition, 
whereas module 6 primarily deals with second-order ToM, need for closure, 
 Figure 15.7  Example from module 4 (To empathize . . . I). Participants are asked to 
deduce emotional states. As these pictures provide rich contextual information, partici-
pants oft en arrive at correct conclusions. However, subsequent pictures (see Figure 15.8) 
in module 4 only show faces without context, which oft en mislead to wrong inferences. 
Participants are encouraged to attenuate their level of conviction in case information is 
incomplete. Permission to reproduce photos granted under a creative commons license.

and complex social reasoning. First-order ToM may involve guessing a person’s 
intentions (e.g., based on their facial expressions), and second-order ToM may 
involve determining another person’s guess about a third person’s intentions (e.g., 
based on the situation). In module 4, participants are fi rst familiarized with dif-
ferent cues for social cognition (e.g., appearance, language) and their validity. It is 
made clear that each social cue alone is fallible (e.g., face: happiness is not always 
expressed with a smile; anxiety and surprise oft en have a similar facial signature) 
and that social cognition is best when a range of diff erent cues is used in combi-
nation. Participants are then asked to identify basic human emotions and assign 
them to facial expressions (see Figure 15.7). Th is task set is easily solved by most 
participants as context information is provided (e.g., a smiling woman in a wed-
ding dress). However, subsequent items do not contain contextual information, 
thereby commonly prompting misinterpretations (see Figure 15.8). Th e manual 
advises the trainer not only to ask for the most likely response option, but also to 
rate the patient’s degree of confi dence. Participants are asked to withhold strong 
judgments in order to prevent overconfi dence in errors. Other tasks of module 
4 have been adopted from Sarfati and Hardy-Bayl é  (1999), depicting a sequence 
of black-and-white pictures that have to be logically terminated with one out of 
three response options (these exercises are not recommended anymore). Module 
4 conveys the message that although facial expressions are very important for 
identifying the feelings of a person, they can also lead to false assumptions. 
 In module 6, comic sequences are presented. Participants are required to take 
the perspective of one of the protagonists and to deduce what the character may 
think about another person or a certain event (see Figure 15.9). As mentioned 
before, this task taps into second-order ToM constructs: Th e subject has to deduce 
what a second person is thinking about a third person. In other words, the subject 
has to socially think outside the box. 
 In the style of the BADE exercises in module 3 (see above), most slides are 
presented in reverse temporal order: Th e picture showing the fi nal action or situ-
ation is presented fi rst. Each novel picture reveals more about the storyline, and 
explanations that initially seem plausible eventually prove wrong and have to 
be corrected. For the majority of items, several interpretations remain possible 
1. Street musician
Cutout!
passion!
3. Street fight
4. Man receives bad news
2. Man having his foot
    stepped on
 Figure 15.8  Th is item is taken from the second task set of module 4 and shows that 
facial information can mislead to false responses. Only a few people assume the cor-
rect response ( right image ) from the picture ( left  ) shown fi rst. Participants are taught to 
withhold strong judgments and collect additional information in ambiguous and unclear 
situations. Permission to reproduce photos granted under a creative commons license.

until the end, which is unsatisfactory for patients with an enhanced need for 
closure (i.e., intolerance for ambiguity). For such items, participants should 
propose what additional information is needed to make a reliable judgment. 
Nevertheless, it should be discussed which interpretation is best supported by 
the available evidence.       
 Metamemory Problems in Schizophrenia: Theory 
 Memory problems are ubiquitous in most psychiatric disorders, but are espe-
cially pronounced in patients with schizophrenia (Aleman, Hijman, de Haan, & 
Kahn, 1999; Heinrichs & Zakzanis, 1998). Memory dysfunctions impact nega-
tively on functional (Green, Kern, & Heaton, 2004) and symptomatic outcome 
(Moritz et al., 2000) in the disorder. Unlike in the amnestic syndrome, memory 
defi cits in schizophrenia refl ect problems with encoding and learning informa-
tion rather than rapid forgetting (Moritz, Heeren, Andresen, & Krausz, 2001). 
Patients are not usually aware of their memory problems. In fact, our group 
 Figure 15.9  Cold-hearted boss? Th e example is taken from module 6 (To empa-
thize . . . II). Th e pictures are viewed one aft er the other (the lower right picture is 
 presented fi rst). In this example, participants sometimes do not understand that the 
viewer has more information than the boss. Whereas the boss’ reaction may seem 
adequate initially (the woman is obviously late), the other pictures cast some doubt on 
this. Th e woman has apparently received a bad message from her doctor and is  visibly 
devastated in the two pictures before. Likely manifestations of crying (especially red 
eyes, bad make-up) may be visible to the boss, who might therefore have reacted more 
 compassionately even if he was unaware of the doctor’s message. Figure created by

found a zero-correlation between subjective and objective memory impairments 
(Moritz, Ferahli, & Naber, 2004). 
 A new line of literature has turned to  metamemory , which is concerned with 
the subjective appraisal of one’s memory performance, particularly response con-
fi dence (Moritz & Woodward, 2006) and memory vividness rather than memory 
accuracy. As shown by Danion and others (2005), the recollections in schizo-
phrenia patients are oft en vague and lack detail. Further, our group has repeat-
edly demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia are overconfi dent in memory 
errors, while at the same time being underconfi dent in correct responses (for 
a review, see Moritz & Woodward, 2006). Th is response pattern has now been 
independently replicated (Bhatt, Laws, & McKenna, 2010; Dor é , Caza, Gingras, & 
Rouleau, 2007; Peters et al., 2007). Some of the more recent studies have been 
conducted with items from the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm, 
which readily elicits false memories (see below for an example). Although in most 
investigations patients with schizophrenia did not diff er from controls in  accuracy 
on the DRM paradigm (e.g., Huron & Danion, 2002), their conviction for error 
responses was disproportionately increased (Moritz, Woodward, & Rodriguez-
Raecke, 2006). Importantly, overconfi dence in errors has been found with non-
delusional material and likely represents a risk factor and not a consequence of 
paranoid symptoms. We have put forward that this twofold response pattern mir-
rors liberal acceptance for response alternatives and JTC, respectively (Moritz, 
Woodward, Jelinek, & Klinge, 2008; Moritz, Woodward, & Lambert, 2007): 
Premature termination of cognitive search processes and liberal decision criteria 
may result in a neglect of essential cues that might have indicated the fallibil-
ity of an incorrect response option, thereby promoting overconfi dence in errors. 
In contrast, controls adopt more careful and deliberate strategies, expressed as 
a reluctance to fully endorse a response option when the available evidence is 
ambiguous. Along the same lines, we assume that healthy control participants 
exhibit greater confi dence in correct responses relative to patients, as the detection 
of multiple supportive cues raises response confi dence. A recent study identifi ed a 
general pattern of overconfi dence in schizophrenia patients, which, however, was 
more pronounced for errors (Kircher, Koch, Stottmeister, & Durst, 2007). 
 Dealing with Metamemory Problems in the MCT (Module 5) 
 Module 5 fi rst introduces mnemonic strategies to help the patient recall informa-
tion, and it provides examples for the fallibility of human memory (e.g., in con-
trast to popular belief, the line “Play it again, Sam” was never uttered in the movie 
Casablanca): Healthy subjects also forget, mix up, embellish, or recall memory 
information falsely. In the main part of the module, complex visual scenes are dis-
played. Many of the stimuli have been utilized in prior basic research studies on 
the false memory paradigm (Miller & Gazzaniga, 1998; Roediger & McDermott, 
1995). Th is material prompts a high frequency of false memories, even in 50%–
80% of healthy subjects, as core items that you would expect in the picture are in

tre atm e nt a pproach e s
fact removed. Group members are instructed to study the pictures carefully (see 
Figure 15.10) and to memorize each item as vividly as possible. Each scene is fol-
lowed by a recognition task asking participants to decide whether an item was 
displayed or not. Subjects are also asked about their response confi dence, and the 
trainer should later ask for perceptual details and for participants to adopt “vivid-
ness heuristics” (i.e., the recollection of perceptual details is a good proxy that an 
object has indeed been shown, whereas “pale” recollections oft en indicate false 
memories. Here, response confi dence should be attenuated). It is made clear to 
participants that our memory can play tricks on us, as it is constructive and does 
not work passively like, for example, a video recorder. Participants should learn 
to doubt their memories and collect additional information if a vivid recollection 
is not available. 
 Mood and Self-Esteem in Schizophrenia 
 It is now well-established that approximately 50% (Buckley, Miller, Lehrer, & 
Castle, 2009) of the schizophrenia population (in contrast to accounts by, for 
example, Kraepelin) share aff ective disturbances. Other studies estimate that two 
(Moritz, Veckenstedt, Randjbar et al., 2010) to three (Freeman et al., 1998) out 
of four patients have low self-esteem, which may be one reason (among others) 
 Figure 15.10     Module 5 shows complex and rather prototypal scenes. Th ese pictures elicit 
false memories in most subjects, as strongly suggested items are not displayed (here, 
blackboard or backpacks are expected from the context but, in fact, are not shown). 
Exercises teach participants to base their judgments on perceptual recollections rather 
than gist or on logical inferences. When the recollection is vague, confi dence should be 
attenuated.

for the high suicide rate in schizophrenia, which is in the range of 5%–15% (for 
overviews, see Preston & Hansen, 2005; Siris, 2001). 
 Dealing with Low Mood and Self-Esteem in the MCT (Module 8) 
 In view of the high prevalence of depression and low self-esteem in schizophrenia, 
module 8 specifi cally targets depressive cognitive schemata (overgeneralization and 
selective abstraction), unhelpful coping strategies (especially rumination, thought 
suppression), underlying depression, and low self-esteem (see Figure 15.11). Th e 
trainer provides more realistic and helpful strategies and encourages participants 
to use detached mindfulness (this technique plays a prominent role in the treat-
ment program devised by Fisher and Wells [2009]) instead of thought suppression 
and rumination for dealing with negative thoughts. Finally, some simple tech-
niques derived from CBT of depression are provided that, if used regularly, help to 
alter low self-esteem and raise depressed mood (e.g., writing down positive events 
during the day, engaging in social activities). 
 INTRODUCING THE PROGRAM TO PARTICIPANTS 
 As mentioned earlier, the MCT is designed as an open group therapy program, 
so participants enter at any module within a cycle. New participants are fi rst wel-
comed by all members and informed about the goal of the program—preferably by 
participants who have already attended some sessions. Most participants will not 
know what metacognition signifi es, which can be explained as follows: “ Meta is 
Greek for about and  cognition  refers to higher mental processes, such as attention 
 Figure 15.11  In module 8 (mood and self-esteem), participants are taught how to replace 
negative appraisals with more positive and constructive ones. At the end of the module, 
some recommendations are provided on how to raise one’s mood (part 1 of this exer-
cise is shown on the left ). In addition, alternatives for dysfunctional coping strategies 
(e.g., thought suppression, see right side) are conveyed (e.g., detached mindfulness for 
worries).

and problem solving. In brief,  metacognition  is thinking about our thinking. Th e 
aim of the program is to learn more about human cognition, and how we can 
observe and change it to optimize our problem-solving abilities. At the heart of 
the program are several thinking styles that may contribute to the formation of 
odd ideas and psychotic symptoms.” 
 Inclusion Criteria, Problematic Situations, 
and Individualized Treatment 
 Inclusion criteria for the MCT group are very liberal. As a rule of thumb, all 
schizophrenia spectrum patients can participate who are able to attend and follow 
other group programs as well (e.g., occupational therapy). In our view, important 
inclusion criteria are past or current delusional ideas or hallucinations. Patients 
with primary diagnoses other than schizophrenia, depression with psychotic fea-
tures, and bipolar disorder with beliefs of grandiosity may also be included. 
 According to our experience and that of our collaborators, groups may com-
prise fi rst-episode and chronic patients, in- and outpatients, and male and 
female patients at the same time. Patients with a short attention span or inap-
propriate/eccentric behavior, aggression/hostility, and severe formal thought 
disorder should not take part until symptoms have at least declined somewhat. 
Although we have successfully run groups with patients diagnosed with oligo-
phrenia, here, a stronger focus on the main exercises and frequent repetition is 
advisable. 
 Good feasibility and treatment fi delity are now well-established in both 
in- and outpatients samples (Favrod et al., 2009; Favrod, Maire, Bardy, Pernier, & 
Bonsack, 2011; Gaweda, Moritz, & Kokoszka, 2009; Moritz & Woodward, 2007a). 
Nevertheless, problematic situations can occur. Here, general treatment guidelines 
apply. For example, if a group member displays severe psychotic symptoms dur-
ing sessions, these should neither be supported nor openly challenged. However, 
if patients are already distanced a bit from their symptoms, such experiences may 
be picked up with MCT exercises containing delusional themes (e.g., module 1, 
scenario “A friend is talking behind your back”; module 6, scenario in which two 
men appear to talk about a third man). At the start and at the end of each module, 
we also raise the questions “Why are we doing this?” and “What does this have 
to do with psychosis?” Th ese slides translate knowledge from basic research to 
patients and provide an opportunity for further refl ections on personal experi-
ences of psychosis; participants are encouraged to talk in a nonjudgmental cli-
mate about their past and present psychotic experiences. However, an in-depth 
analysis and exchange about individual delusional ideas is best addressed in the 
framework of face-to-face sessions, as in CBT. An alternative is individualized 
Metacognitive Th erapy (MCT+), which is available in a German-language version 
and as a beta version in English and Dutch at www.uke.de/mct_plus. Th e MCT+ 
is more focused on individual symptoms and combines elements of CBT (dispute

of an illness model) with core features of the MCT. As in the group training, a 
“back-door approach” is adopted: Instead of challenging symptoms and delu-
sional appraisals directly, which may undermine the therapeutic alliance, cogni-
tive biases are addressed fi rst before the therapy continues to challenge individual 
biases and delusions. 
 Metacognitive Training: Feasibility, Subjective Feedback, & Efﬁ cacy 
 As described in further detail in Chapter 12 (Fizdon, 2013, this volume), various 
studies have now asserted the feasibility of the MCT in German (Moritz, Vitzthum 
et al., 2010; Moritz & Woodward, 2007b) and other languages (Favrod et al., 2009; 
Gaweda et al., 2009). Participants consider the training to be both entertaining 
and (subjectively) eff ective. Attendance rates are usually high. Moreover, studies 
from our group, as well as from other researchers, have shown a positive impact 
on symptoms (Aghotor, Pfueller, Moritz, Weisbrod, & Roesch-Ely, 2010; Kumar 
et al., 2010; Moritz, Veckenstedt et al., in press; Moritz, Veckenstedt, Randjbar, 
Vitzthum, & Woodward, in press; Ross, Freeman, Dunn, & Garety, 2011), cogni-
tive biases (Aghotor et al., 2010; Moritz, Kerstan et al., in press; Moritz, Veckenstedt 
et al., in press; Ross et al., 2009), and quality of life (Briki et al., 2008; Moritz, 
Kerstan et al., in press). Still, follow-up analyses are needed to provide insight into 
the stability of the eff ects. 
 CONCLUSION 
 Over the last two decades, increasing support has been gathered for both psycho-
logical theories and interventions of schizophrenia. MCT is one manifestation 
of this new trend. Cognitive biases and social cognitive impairments are likely 
involved in the formation and maintenance of the disorder and thus represent 
important treatment targets. Th e goal of the MCT is to sharpen patients’ (meta-
cognitive) awareness of these biases and impairments and to carry over the learn-
ing aims into their daily life. Although there is increasing support for the effi  cacy 
of the MCT as a stand-alone program, we advise clinicians to complement MCT 
with personal therapy, for example CBT or MCT+ (Moritz, Veckenstedt, Randjbar, 
& Vitzthum, 2010; Moritz, Veckenstedt et al., in press). Against the background 
of high rates of relapse and only modest symptom decline under antipsychotic 
medication alone, we hope that (adjunct) cognitive interventions someday will be 
the norm rather than the exception in treatment.

 Social Cognition and Interaction Training (SCIT) is a comprehensive, stand-
alone manual-based group intervention that targets the three core social cognitive 
defi cits in schizophrenia: emotion perception, theory of mind (ToM), and attribu-
tional style (Roberts, Penn, & Combs, 2009). By targeting these defi cits in social 
cognition, it is believed that social and community functioning will ultimately 
improve (Combs et al., 2007; W ö lwer, Combs, Frommann, & Penn, 2010). SCIT is 
comprised of three distinct phases, lasts 20–24 weeks, and is built around a weekly 
1-hour group therapy session. SCIT has shown improvements in both inpatients 
and outpatients with schizophrenia (Combs et al., 2007; Penn et al., 2005; Roberts 
et al., 2009), and these gains persist at 6-month follow-up (Combs et al., 2009). 
SCIT has the potential to become an evidence-based treatment for schizophre-
nia (Penn, Roberts, Combs, & Sterne, 2007). SCIT involves the use of didactic 
instruction, videotape and computerized learning tools, and role-play methods to 
improve social cognition. SCIT involves weekly homework assignments and uses 
optional phone-in contacts and practice partners to consolidate gains made in the 
sessions. Th e theoretical underpinnings of SCIT will now be discussed. 
 THEORETICAL ORIENTATION 
 Defi cits in social cognition have been shown to be closely related to poor social and 
community functioning (Penn, Addington, & Pinkham, 2006). SCIT is based on 
empirically derived social cognitive models of schizophrenia, particularly as they 
apply to paranoid processes (Combs & Penn, 2008). SCIT emphasizes several key 
social cognitive domains that appear to interact in hindering eff ective social behavior 
in schizophrenia. First, a need for closure (i.e., intolerance of ambiguity) is associ-
ated with the tendency to truncate searches for explanatory evidence and jump to 
hasty conclusions in many social situations. Second, externalizing and personalizing

attributional biases are used in explaining negative events. When many individuals 
with schizophrenia experience negative events, they are vulnerable to hastily blaming 
factors outside of themselves and blaming other people, as opposed to blaming situa-
tions. Th is is especially true for persons with paranoia (Combs & Penn, 2008). Th ird, 
ToM is the ability to simulate in one’s own mind the mental states of people other 
than oneself. Th is includes the ability to infer the intentions, perspectives, desires, 
and emotions of other people (i.e. “to put oneself in another’s shoes”). It also includes 
the ability to imagine oneself in a diff erent situation from the here-and-now, and to 
evaluate one’s current thoughts and emotions nonsubjectively, as if looking at oneself 
from the outside. It has been widely demonstrated that persons with schizophre-
nia have defi cits in ToM, and these defi cits are linked to social functioning (Brune, 
2005). Th is latter aspect of ToM overlaps with the concept of  metacognition . Fourth, 
emotion perception abnormalities include diffi  culties identifying facially expressed 
emotions. Abnormalities in emotion perception are thought to exacerbate the above 
constellation of diffi  culties as they apply to interpersonal functioning. 
 Conceptually, SCIT is structured hierarchically, such that training on recogniz-
ing emotions is presented fi rst in phase 1. It is believed that obtaining accurate 
information on emotional expressions provides important “data” that can be used 
to “fi gure out” situations (how people are feeling, in order to make better deci-
sions), which is the focus of phase 2. Phase 3 focuses on problems in the partici-
pant’s real life, and participants can use data to fi gure these situations out. SCIT 
achieves change by correcting the inherent social cognitive defi cits and biases 
found in schizophrenia and makes adaptive processes more automatic in nature. 
 OVERVIEW OF SCIT 
 SCIT is designed to meet at least once per week for 45–60 minutes, for 20–24 ses-
sions. Th is manual is structured around a 20-session treatment phase. However, 
facilitators may elect to add up to four “catch-up” sessions within the treatment if 
they decide that it would be useful to spend more than the allotted time working 
through specifi c content areas. 
 SCIT is divided into three distinct treatment phases, as shown in Table 16.1.

 Phase I: Introduction and Emotions 
 Th e initial two sessions are spent building group alliance and introducing par-
ticipants to the SCIT group and the concept of social cognition. Aft er this intro-
duction, the remainder of phase I is spent defi ning basic emotions, discussing 
the relationship between emotions and social situations, and identifying facial 
expressions of emotion. Th e goals of phase I are to:
 Begin building group alliance. 
1. 
 Introduce SCIT and the concept of social cognition.  
2. 
 Share personal experiences of emotion and link them to social contexts. 
3. 
 Defi ne seven basic emotions. 
4. 
  Flexibly distinguish between diff erent facial expressions of emotion 
5. 
and improve attention to crucial areas of the face needed for emotion 
perception. 
 Conceptualize paranoia as an emotion. 
6. 
 Phase II: Figuring Out Situations 
 Phase II presents social cognitive strategies to avoid the pitfalls associated with 
“jumping to conclusions” (JTC) in social situations. Th ese strategies include gen-
erating multiple attributions for negative events, perspective taking, distinguish-
ing social facts from social guesses, tolerating ambiguity in social situations, and 
utilizing new information to improve interpretation of social situations. Th e goals 
of phase II are to:
   Learn to recognize “jumping to conclusions.” 
1. 
 Learn the diff erence between internal/personal, external/personal, and 
2. 
external/situational attributions. 
  Learn to generate causal attributions from these three perspectives. 
3. 
 Appreciate the diffi  culty of interpreting ambiguous situations. 
4. 
 Recognize the diff erence between social facts and guesses. 
5. 
 Practice gathering evidence instead of JTC. 
6. 
 Learn to judge the likelihood that a conclusion is right. 
7. 
 Phase III: Checking It Out 
 Th is fi nal phase of SCIT is a consolidation of skills learned up to this point and 
an application of these skills to participants’ own lives. Th is is achieved by learn-
ing, rehearsing, and applying a step-by-step problem-solving algorithm called the 
“checking it out” process. Participants are encouraged to bring in problematic 
situations from their daily lives. Th e group then analyzes the situations and devel-
ops behavioral strategies for “checking out” problems with other people based on 
SCIT skills. Th e goals of phase III are to:

 DESCRIPTION OF INDIVIDUAL SCIT SESSIONS 
 Check-In 
 Each SCIT session begins with a 10-minute group check-in, during which mem-
bers are asked how they are feeling (participants are asked “are you feeling mostly 
good, mostly bad, or neutral?”). Th is check-in procedure occurs in all SCIT ses-
sions. Th e check-in sets the tone early on that members are expected to share 
their feelings openly in the group and also provides examples for SCIT leaders 
to draw upon if needed. A secondary goal is to promote awareness of emotional 
reactions in social situations (to help address possible alexithymia) and the eff ect 
that emotions can have on social judgments and behavior. Aft er check-in, the 
leaders review the previous week’s homework and then begin the material for the 
current session.  
 Phase 1: Emotion Training 
 Sessions 1 and 2: Introduction 
 Th ese initial sessions orient participants to the general goals of the SCIT 
intervention and provide a shared model of thinking that will be emphasized 
throughout the intervention. Th e group leaders introduce themselves and the 
goals of SCIT. Participants are informed that the group will help them enhance 
their social lives by avoiding misunderstandings with others. Th e group sessions 
will consist of a number of diff erent activities, such as watching and discussing 
videos, doing puzzles and games, and having conversations about participants’ 
lives and problems. Participants then introduce themselves and, if possible, state 
goals for themselves. Th en the leaders collaboratively discuss the group rules, 
attendance, homework, and the role of practice partners to lay the foundation 
for a successful group. Aft er the basic information about SCIT is presented, the 
session then shift s to the fi rst main point, which is illustrated by use of the SCIT 
triangle. Th e SCIT triangle (Figure 16.1) depicts the causal connections among 
emotions, thoughts, and actions. An example serves to illustrate the relationships 
to the participants.

tre atm e nt a pproach e s
 So, let me give you an example of how this triangle works. Yesterday, I was in 
a bad mood for some reason. A friend of mine called me on the phone and 
asked if I wanted to go see a certain movie with him. I said no and told him 
that it sounded like a stupid movie. Aft erward, I felt bad because I realized 
that my bad mood made me treat my friend badly. It also made me think that 
it was a dumb idea to go see that movie. 
 Every time we talk to somebody, all three of these things are happening—
emotions, thoughts, and actions— and they’re all aff ecting each other. 
 Following the above example from the group leader, a video vignette is shown 
and the members discuss how emotions, thoughts, and behaviors are interrelated. 
Th en, group members are asked to apply the SCIT triangle to their own lives in a 
group discussion. Members are asked to write down two things they would like to 
improve about their own lives as homework. 
 Session 3: Emotions and Social Situations 
 Th is session continues the psychoeducational lesson from the previous sessions, with 
an emphasis on the causal links between emotions and social situations. Participants 
are primed to conceptualize emotions as factors that can aff ect one’s perception of 
a situation. Th ey are challenged to employ a metacognitive perspective in thinking 
about how emotions in their own lives may aff ect their behavior. Th e group leader 
provides an example to discuss how our feelings aff ect thoughts and behaviors. Th is 
exercise explicitly counteracts the temptation to use “aff ect as information” in inter-
preting social situations, by contrasting emotional and cognitive infl uences. Many 
persons feel unhappy and then use this emotion to create paranoid beliefs about 
the situation. At the end of the session, the use of facial mimicry is introduced as a 
tool for understanding others’ emotional states. A structured activity called “How 
Would You Feel in Th eir Shoes” is completed in session. Participants read a short 
vignette such as “Carrie just heard that her pet dog was just hit by a car” and are 
asked to decide which emotion Carrie might be feeling and to mimic that emotion 
as well. Th e use of facial cues can provide important data to help recognize emotions 
and later in SCIT help participants understand the role of social context.

 Session 4: Defining Emotions 
 Th is session develops basic conceptual knowledge about seven basic emotions 
(happy, anger, sadness, surprise, fear, shame, and disgust). Th e session is devoted 
to describing how these emotions are expressed on the faces of others and to 
developing a shared defi nition of diff erent emotional expressions. Th ese facial 
“cues” are then placed on an “Emotion Poster,” which is used for the remainder 
of SCIT. Consistent with the SCIT triangle, to initiate the discussion, a situation 
is presented that then evokes an emotion. For example, “We hear a loud bang. 
What emotion would be present?” Time is also spent discussing paranoia as an 
emotion, as many participants have paranoid beliefs about others. For homework, 
participants complete an exercise called “Emotions in My Life,” in which they 
write down the meaning of each emotional state. 
 Session 5: Guessing People’s Emotions 
 Following the creation of the Emotion Poster, session 5 provides more practice in 
emotion recognition. Participants view a PowerPoint slide show presentation that 
contains diff erent facial depictions of the seven basic emotional states. Participants 
are asked to look at each image and make a “guess” about the emotion being pre-
sented. Facial “cues” are used to provide the data that informs their guess, and 
participants can refer to the emotion poster for assistance. It is important to note 
that participant answers are viewed as guesses since we cannot be 100% confi dent 
which emotion someone is feeling. Aft er a guess, participants then rate on a scale 
of 0%–100% how confi dent they are with their guess. If participants are not sure 
of the emotional expression, they can mimic the emotional expression to receive 
facial feedback. 
 An optional exercise comes from research on attention shaping as a means to 
improve emotion recognition (Combs et al., 2006, 2008, 2011). Th e center of the 
face contains a wealth of important information, and persons with schizophre-
nia oft en look at nonrelevant areas of the face when recognizing emotions. By 
focusing attention on the eyes, nose, and mouth areas, emotion perception can 
improve. Th us, visual attention is shaped or directed toward these areas. Attention 
is directed by using a visual prompt that focuses the participants on the right 
areas to view. A PowerPoint demonstration of how attention shaping works can 
be shown that contains fi ve practice and 12 training faces in which an attentional 
prompt directs attention to the center of the face. As evident, session 5 contains 
a wealth of material, and participants fi nd this session especially challenging yet 
informative. 
 Session 6: Updating Emotion Guesses 
 During session 6, participants continue to practice identifying emotional expres-
sions. In this session, they are asked to make guesses about emotional expressions 
that change or “morph” over time. Since most emotional expressions can rapidly 
change, it is benefi cial to see how facial expressions change from a neutral to a 
strongly expressive emotion. An example of several emotion morph slides is pre-
sented in Figure 16.2 to illustrate this activity. 

390 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
 Participants view a series of six images that increase in saliency, and, at each 
step, they make a “guess” about which emotion is present and how confi dent they 
are in their guess. As emotions become more intense, the facial cues become more 
evident to participants. Five diff erent slide shows can be used for training pur-
poses to provide ample practice. In addition to reinforcing the techniques from 
the previous session, this exercise is designed to improve social cognitive fl ex-
ibility and to decrease rigid responding. Such responding may be due to neu-
rologically based perseveration, especially among participants with pronounced 
negative symptoms. However, according to the SCIT model, infl exible, repetitive 
responding may also be due to psychological factors, such as a high need for clo-
sure. Th is is especially true among participants who are emotionally aroused by 
the social context and the evaluative implications of the exercise. 
 Session 7: Suspicious Feelings 
 Paranoia is especially common in SCIT participants and engenders a wide range 
of emotions such as anger, fear, or even sadness. Session 7 focuses specifi cally 
on paranoia and suspiciousness as an emotion. For participants to benefi t from 
SCIT, they must be able to identify fl uctuations in emotional states, including

paranoia, that infl uence how they interpret situations and behave. Th is session 
is aimed at normalizing the experience of paranoia by framing it as an emotion 
that is continuous with more normative experiences, such as wariness and sus-
picion. Participants collaboratively come up with diff erent reasons for paranoia, 
and answers are grouped into three categories: (1) Characteristics of others (past 
lying behaviors, ambiguous behaviors), (2) situational factors (being in a danger-
ous situation), and (3) internal factors (anxiety, drug use, lack of sleep). Th e point 
is that paranoia has a number of causes and may not refl ect the actual or true 
belief of the other person. 
 Paranoia as applied to social situations can be justifi ed, inappropriate, or ambig-
uous. Th ree video vignettes are used to discuss each type of paranoia, and partici-
pants discuss the vignettes. Two homework assignments are used to consolidate 
gains, and these involve an introspection of times in their lives when participants 
were mistrustful of others and situations in their lives that were ambiguous in 
terms of others’ intentions. 
 Phase 2: Figuring Out Situations 
 Session 8: Jumping to Conclusions 
 As phase 2 begins, the focus of SCIT shift s to teaching strategies and skills to 
fi gure out social situations. Th e initial session focuses on identifying and defi ning 
the JTC bias. Th e JTC bias involves making hasty decisions using very little data. 
Persons with delusions and paranoia oft en rush the decision-making process and 
do not seek out other pieces of information that might lead to a diff erent and, 
more likely, accurate conclusion. Participants take the role of a “social detective,” 
and it is emphasized that detectives examine all sources of data before making a 
decision. Detectives oft en work slowly, and participants should too in social situ-
ations. Th e JTC bias is normalized as a common human error that is more likely 
to occur in situations that are ambiguous in nature (e.g., where intention is not 
clear). Th e JTC bias oft en leads to negative judgments about people and, more 
specifi cally, paranoid beliefs. Using the SCIT triangle (Figure 16.1), paranoia is 
placed in the “Emotion” corner while JTC is placed in the “Th oughts” corner of 
the triangle. In other words, just as paranoia is a kind of emotion that can lead to 
social problems, JTC is a kind of thinking that can also lead to social problems. 
People who jump to conclusions oft en believe they are right but are oft en wrong, 
and this kind of thinking can create bad feelings in others. Th rough two video 
vignettes, participants begin to develop skills at recognizing this error in fi ctional 
characters, so that they may later identify it in their own lives. Homework consists 
of having the participants generate times in their lives when they engaged in JTC 
and the consequences of this type of decision making. 
 Sessions 9 and 10: Think Up Other Guesses 
 Following a discussion of the JTC, participants are taught a strategy to possibly 
remediate this social cognitive bias that focuses on “thinking up other guesses 

392 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
as means to avoid jumping to conclusions.” Th is approach is a modifi ed form of 
“generating alternatives,” a common cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) tech-
nique that is familiar to many clinicians. Generating alternatives is used primar-
ily to decrease a client’s conviction in a maladaptive belief or conclusion and to 
slow down the decision-making process. Th e SCIT approach is unique in two 
ways. First, individuals with cognitive limitations oft en have diffi  culty engag-
ing in open-ended brainstorming. Th erefore, we have deliberately constrained 
the brainstorming exercise so that participants must only think of three possible 
guesses and can use a simple heuristic in generating these guesses by adopting the 
perspective of three fi ctional characters (i.e., Blaming Bill, My-Fault Mary, and 
Easy Eddie; see below). Th e goal is to make this process less cognitively taxing 
and more automatic in nature. Second, we have linked this approach to research 
on attributional style among individuals with persecutory delusions. Th us, the 
three characters refl ect the diff erent types of attributional styles found in research 
studies. “Blaming Bill” exhibits the personalizing bias that involves blaming oth-
ers for negative events (external-personal) and is oft en angry. Blaming Bill refl ects 
the attributional style of most paranoid persons. “My-Fault Mary” blames herself 
for negative events (internal-personal) and gets depressed over her perceived fail-
ures. Finally, Easy Eddie blames the situation and tends to remain calm (exter-
nal-situational). Participants are also asked to describe what types of emotional 
expressions and behaviors these three characters would exhibit. Th ese questions 
about thoughts, emotions, and behaviors perfectly align with the SCIT triangle. 
Participants practice generating alternative explanations for a number of nega-
tive fi ctional events to reinforce this skill. An example of this activity is provided 
here: 
 Tasia said she would go to Betty’s party. But on the night of the party, Tasia 
didn’t come. 
 Questions:
What does Betty think? 
 How would Blaming Bill, My-Fault Mary, and Easy Eddie interpret the situ-
ation, and what emotions they would feel? 
 Th e responses are organized into a three-column table with the headings Facts, 
Guesses, and Feelings for each character.  
 Participants continue to practice with fi ctional scenarios and then provide 
examples from their own life. For these exercises, aft er the three alternatives are 
discussed, participants must decide which one they believe is most correct (based 
on the facts and evidence) and then rate how certain they are of the correct deci-
sion on a 10-point scale to make “gradients of certainty” judgments. Th is meta-
cognitive process should increase the dissonance that participants experience 
when they jump to conclusions, and therefore it should increase the likelihood of 
their entertaining other guesses.

 Sessions 11, 12, and 13: Separate Facts from Guesses 
 Th ese sessions extend the work of sessions 9 and 10 by presenting another strategy 
for avoiding jumping to conclusions: separating facts from guesses. Individuals 
with psychotic disorders oft en make poor judgments, even when they possess 
suffi  cient information to make good judgments. Participants are taught the diff er-
ences between objective facts and a guess. Objective facts are things that almost 
all people agree on (oft en what is visible or known), and guesses are things that 
we cannot know for certain, such as feelings, motivations, and thoughts. Guesses 
are usually inferences or attributions about why people do things or how they are 
feeling. By identifying and then using the facts, we can make better social guesses; 
however, guesses could also be wrong. Th e diff erence between facts and guesses is 
illustrated by using a series of SCIT pictures (eight total). Participants are shown 
a picture and are asked to come up with facts, guesses, and feelings. A script for 
this activity is provided below. 
 Th is is like the game we did a few weeks ago where we listed facts and guesses. 
Only this time, we are going to look at pictures instead of having me read you 
situations. We are going to try to name as many facts as we can about the pic-
tures. Th ink of yourself as a detective at the scene of a crime. We want to list 
everything that we know for sure, things that everybody will agree on. Th ese 
are the facts. I’ll write the facts on the board. Make sure you don’t jump to 
conclusions about things that you aren’t 100% sure about. 
 Aft er we list facts, we are going to list guesses—things that we think might be 
true about the people in the situation, but might not. I have a sheet of paper 
that tells me what the real facts are “behind the scenes” in the pictures, so that 
we can see how many of our guesses are right and how many are wrong. 
 A sample picture similar to one used in SCIT is illustrated in Figure 16.3. 
 Once participants are comfortable discussing pictures, several videos are used. 
Th en, at the end of session 13, participants discuss this activity in their own lives. 
A series of homework assignments are used aft er each session to practice this 
activity with a practice partner. One particular homework assignment centers on 
inferring what a person wants for his or her birthday using known facts (e.g., 
what they like to do) to make a good guess. For example, “Lonnie is in school, but 
wishes he was a chef. Every day he has class from 8:30 to 3:30. Aft er school, he

 Sessions 14 and 15: Gather More Evidence 
 To reinforce all of the skills learned in phase II and continue to target the JTC bias, 
participants play the 20 Questions game, which emphasizes data gathering and 
making good guesses. Th is activity is designed to target participants’ metacogni-
tive abilities and tolerance of ambiguity in the context of a “hot” social cognitive 
situation—a competitive guessing game. By participating with others in a game 
in which points are won and lost, participants are at risk of performing poorly in 
front of their peers, and thus are at risk of increased social cognitive error. Th e 
rules of the game are presented, and the group leaders conduct the fi rst several 
rounds. Th e leader thinks of an animal, a place, or a food. Participants can only 
ask “yes-or-no” type questions. Participants begin with 10 points and each yes/
no question earns them an additional 1 point. Aft er asking a question, each par-
ticipant has the option of guessing what the correct answer is. If a player elects to 
guess the answer, he or she must decide how many points to bet on whether the 
guess is correct or incorrect. Players cannot bet more points than they have. Aft er 
each round, players review their scores, discuss the strategies they used in the 
round, and state how it might be possible to improve their strategy for the next 
round. Th e focus is on players who jumped to conclusions by betting on a guess 
before enough information was available to make a good guess and/or by betting 
too many points on their guess, given how little information was available. An 
alternative version of the 20 Questions game is available using participant likes 
and dislikes. Th e use of points is optional for some groups.

 Phase III 
 Sessions 16 to 24: Integration (or “Checking It Out”) 
 Th e primary goals of phase III (integration) are to assess the certainty of facts 
and guesses surrounding events in participants’ personal lives, recognize that 
it is sometimes necessary to obtain more information about social situations, 
and to teach eff ective social skills for checking out guesses. Th e essential pur-
pose of the fi nal phase is to put into practice what participants have learned in 
SCIT. Participants are taught a systematic method for making social decisions 
called “checking it out.” Th e steps of the checking it out process are presented in 
Table 16.3. 
 Once the steps in the checking it out method are presented (usually in sessions 
16 and 17), the rest of the sessions focus on applying these steps to problems in 
the participants’ lives. For example, a participant arranges to go to a movie with 
a friend, and the friend does not show up. Th e participant is asked to make an 
attribution about why this occurred. Th e check it out process involves all of the 
tools learned in SCIT, such as separating facts from guesses, avoiding jumping to 
conclusions, and gathering good data, in order to make an informed guess about 
the situation. Th e participant can then choose to check out his or her guess by 
asking the person directly (or asking another person, write a letter or e-mail, or do 
nothing at all) to see if their guess was correct. Of course, the group discusses the

pros and cons of each proposed action before this is done in real life. For example, 
a person who is very angry may not be advised to confront the person about the 
event. Role-plays are oft en used at this point to practice the skills needed for an 
eff ective interaction. Th e participant is off ered constructive feedback on his or 
her social skills and can practice as much as he or she desires with other people 
or practice partners. To assist with making a good decision, participants organize 
their thoughts into four columns: facts, guesses, feelings, and possible actions. 
Table 16.4 shows an illustrative example of such a chart. 
 TROUBLESHOOTING 
 Given that schizophrenia is a heterogeneous condition, SCIT was developed to be 
fl exible in its methods and activities to accommodate the full range of symptoms 
and characteristics. Here, we review some of the issues that may aff ect group per-
formance and the achievement of the learning objectives. 
 Symptom Heterogeneity 
 Th e activities in SCIT can be varied for persons with diff erent symptom presen-
tations, with special emphasis placed on working with persons with negative 
symptoms. Within the SCIT manual, a common symbol (yin-yang symbol) des-
ignates when symptoms may aff ect an activity. SCIT conceptualizes social cogni-
tive dysfunction in the two broad syndromal subtypes of schizophrenia: type 1 
(positive syndrome) and type 2 (negative syndrome). Behavioral techniques are

more likely to be eff ective for participants with predominant negative syndrome 
features (type 2), whereas a combination of cognitive and behavioral techniques 
is recommended for participants with predominant positive syndrome features 
(type 1). More in-session activities are used with negative-symptom persons due 
to poor motivation for homework compliance aft er the session. Also, persons with 
negative symptoms require more attention from the group leaders to keep them 
engaged. At the beginning of SCIT, a special emphasis is placed on cultivating 
client motivation, engagement, and “buy in” throughout the course of treatment. 
Participants develop personal goals for how SCIT can improve their lives and are 
then reminded of these goals oft en. SCIT activities are designed to be fun and 
engaging, to make the groups more intrinsically motivating. 
 Homework 
 To reinforce gains, SCIT makes ample use of homework assignments following 
each session. However, we acknowledge that homework compliance tends to be 
low in this population, and pressuring participants to comply with homework 
may strain the therapeutic alliance. On the other hand, empirical research indi-
cates that homework assignment and adherence has a modest impact on treatment 
outcome (Kazantzis, Deane, & Ronan, 2000). Additionally, a core assumption of 
SCIT is that most skill practice will take place outside of therapy sessions through 
participants using SCIT strategies in their day-to-day lives. 
 To balance these issues, SCIT takes a moderate approach to homework. SCIT 
facilitators should provide homework activities, encourage client adherence, and 
spend time at the beginning of each session reviewing homework. Aft er all, if 
a group leader assigns homework but does not review it in session, the partici-
pants learn that it is not important. However, we suggest that facilitators honor a 
participant’s decision if he or she decides not to do homework and refrain from 
requiring it or coercing him or her to complete it. Homework is given to the class 
at the end of each session. Th e directions for each assignment need to be clearly 
presented and discussed to troubleshoot any potential problems. Copies of the 
materials should always be handed out to improve compliance with the assign-
ment as well.  
 Practice Partners 
 SCIT involves the optional use of “practice partners” to provide more practice in 
developing the skills taught in SCIT. A practice partner is a specifi c person from 
the participant’s life outside of the group who has agreed to help him or her prac-
tice SCIT skills. Th is can include a family member, friend, individual therapist, 
case manager, or acquaintance. As with homework, the use of practice partners 
provides an increased opportunity for the consolidation of concepts, as well as 
for skill application and integration through social interaction. Depending on 

398 
tre atm e nt a pproach e s
the population, it may not be feasible for all or some group members to iden-
tify an appropriate practice partner. Th erefore, group leaders should use their 
judgment in deciding if it is appropriate to introduce this aspect of homework 
assignments. With consent, the group leaders should contact the practice part-
ners and explain the goals and structure of SCIT. Th e practice partner must be 
aware of his or her weekly involvement. Ask the participant to identify another 
practice partner if it seems that the initially identifi ed practice partner is not 
interested or does not have the time to be involved. At the end of the weekly 
session, the SCIT leaders either mail or e-mail the SCIT homework to the prac-
tice partner. Th e SCIT manual contains weekly activities for practice partners 
that mirror the content taught in the SCIT session. Th e activities instruct the 
practice partner on how to engage the client and provide an outline of topics 
to discuss. When required, the group leaders should call the practice partners 
weekly to update them on what happened in each SCIT group and check in with 
them about the homework.  
 PARTICIPANT SELECTION AND PRACTICAL ISSUES 
 SCIT is appropriate for individuals who are at least 18 years of age, suff ering from 
a psychotic illness, and who have interpersonal diffi  culties as a result of their 
illness. SCIT is designed for individuals in both inpatient and outpatient treat-
ment centers, and works well for both positive and negative symptoms (Roberts 
& Penn, 2009). SCIT is particularly appropriate for individuals with symptoms 
of suspiciousness and paranoia. SCIT is less useful for individuals with profound 
cognitive impairments (i.e., IQ below 70), profound depression, or for individuals 
with serious substance abuse or dependence problems. 
 We recommend including fi ve to eight participants and two leaders in each 
SCIT group, although groups of 10–12 have been conducted. Having at least 
fi ve participants will bring a variety of perspectives to the group and ensure that 
individual participants will not feel too much pressure to perform. Although the 
group can be run with one facilitator, with two facilitators, one can lead the group 
while the other keeps participants on task, hands out materials, and writes on the 
fl ipchart or board. SCIT can be administered by mental health professionals, such 
as psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and nurses with experience work-
ing with individuals with schizophrenia, who possess training in SCIT. 
 Th e following materials are needed to implement SCIT:

 CONCLUSION 
 SCIT is a group intervention for schizophrenia. Th e training addresses many of 
the central social cognitive abnormalities found in schizophrenia. SCIT targets 
defi cits in emotion perception, ToM, and attributional style, as well as the ten-
dency to jump to conclusions. SCIT attempts to remediate these defi cits by using 
a combination of didactic instruction and repeated practice. Participants hone 
their skills on practice vignettes, videos, and, fi nally, their real lives. Th e empirical 
evidence on SCIT has been promising, and SCIT fi lls the gap that many cognitive 
remediation interventions do not. In the end, SCIT may lead to changes in the 
person’s quality of life and social and community functioning.

 CONCLUSION 
 The Future of Social Cognition in 
Schizophrenia 
 Implications from the Normative Literature  
 D A V I D  L .   R O B E R T S   A N D      A M Y  E .    P I N K H A M  ■ 
 Th e study of social cognition in schizophrenia is a young and rapidly changing 
fi eld. As in most new fi elds, researchers have made rapid and important progress 
while also encountering a range of vexing obstacles. In particular, the study of 
social cognition in schizophrenia has yet to develop a solid conceptual founda-
tion or a conventionally accepted set of basic measurement tools. To address these 
issues, an expert consensus panel convened by the National Institute of Mental 
Health (NIMH) advised that schizophrenia researchers look to the literature on 
normal social cognition for guidance (Green et al., 2008). Th e current volume was 
designed to facilitate this process. Part I of this volume is dedicated to reviewing 
the normative literature on social cognition, including its developmental emer-
gence (Chapter 1), manifestation in healthy adults (Chapter 2), cross-cultural 
variation (Chapter 3), and neural bases (Chapter 4). In Chapter 5, Tudusciuc and 
Adolphs (2013) provide a roadmap for translating this normative literature into 
the study of dysfunctional social cognition. 
 Part II of this volume describes research on mechanisms of abnormal social cog-
nition in schizophrenia and their link to social functioning impairment. In Chapter 
6, Horan and colleagues (2013) review research that establishes the importance of 
social cognition as an independent focus of study in schizophrenia—showing that 
it is relatively dissociable from neurocognition and is strongly and independently 
associated with functional outcome. In Chapter 7, Kohler and colleagues (2013) 
review the descriptive literature on emotion processing in schizophrenia. Th ey 
conclude that there is strong evidence of impairment in the recognition of emo-
tions, but that the research on emotional expression and experience is limited by 
variability in measurement approach. Chapter 8 reviews the literature on theory of 
mind (ToM), which provides consistent support for the existence of ToM defi cits 
in schizophrenia. As in the emotion processing literature, however, Abu-Akel and 

402 
tre atm e nt a pproache s
Shamay-Tsoory (2013, Chapter 8, this volume) emphasize that the use of widely 
varying measurement approaches and incompatible theoretical assumptions are 
important rate limiting factors in this area of study. 
 A common theme in the research on emotion perception and ToM is the ten-
dency to conceptualize abnormal performance as a type of defi ciency in informa-
tion processing capacity. Less infl uential than this capacity-oriented literature is 
the literature, infl uenced by social psychology, that examines the role of social 
cognitive bias in explaining abnormalities in schizophrenia. If, from the cognitive 
perspective,  defi cient capacity refers to the inability to perform an information 
processing function, then  bias refers to information-processing functions that 
produce  systematically distorted  output. Th is perspective is represented in Chapter 
9, where Bentall and Udachina (2013) review research in which paranoid social 
cognition in schizophrenia is conceptualized as partly resulting from an exag-
geration of normal social cognitive processes, including threat detection, need for 
cognitive closure, emotional arousal, and self-esteem maintenance. Th e possibility 
that social cognitive abnormality in schizophrenia may result from some combi-
nation of information-processing defi cits and biases is also supported by the neu-
roimaging research reviewed by Pinkham (2013) in Chapter 11. For example, she 
reviews studies that have shown hypoactive amygdala function during emotion 
processing tasks, suggesting defi cient function, along with other studies reporting 
 hyper activity, which may lead to biased social inferences. 
 Th e chapters in Part II echo the conclusions of the expert consensus panel 
noted above. Th ey highlight the need for a solid theoretical foundation that can 
guide the standardization of measurement instruments and provide a framework 
for integrating defi cit- and bias-based research. 
 Our aim in this fi nal chapter is to facilitate the application of the normative 
literature reviewed in Part I of this volume to address the issues with research on 
social cognition in schizophrenia, as reviewed in Parts II and III. First, we expand 
on a point made by Lundberg (2013) in Chapter 2—that social psychologists con-
ceptualize social cognition in a markedly diff erent way than do schizophrenia 
researchers, which has far-reaching implications for measurement, understand-
ing of mechanisms, and treatment development. Second, and building on this fi rst 
point, we describe the dual-process (DP) framework, a theoretical model that has 
taken hold in both social psychology (see Chapter 2) and social neuroscience (see 
Chapter 4) and which, we think, has particular promise as a guiding theoretical 
model for the study of social cognition in schizophrenia. 
 WHAT IS SOCIAL COGNITION? 
 We suspect that most schizophrenia researchers are like us in thinking of social 
cognition as the ability to infer the mental and emotional states of others, and that 
to the extent that our patients fail to do this accurately, it is due to their having 
either  capacity defi cits or  biases (or both) in social cognition. When we turn to the 
social psychological literature, however, we see a very diff erent perspective. Social

psychologists do not appear to share the basic assumption that normal people 
have the capacity to infer others’ mental and emotional states. And, although 
social psychologists do use concepts like  capacity and  bias , they have slightly dif-
ferent meanings—and starkly diff erent implications for measurement and treat-
ment development. 
 The Capacity to Infer Others’ Mental and Emotional States 
 Social psychologists generally do not share the view that healthy people are 
endowed with the capacity to accurately infer others’ mental and emotional 
states. Th eir perspective appears to have emerged from a confl uence of empiri-
cal fi ndings and theoretical principles. First, social psychologists have found that 
the social cognitive judgments of healthy adults exhibit only a mediocre level of 
accuracy (Ickes, 2003), and oft en, that accuracy does not appear to be the goal of 
judgment makers. Instead, normal adults’ judgments oft en are infl uenced more 
by the subject’s own goals and motives than by a desire to be correct (Fiske & 
Taylor, 2008; Kunda, 1990). Second, social neuroscience suggests that, not only 
are people oft en not motivated to be accurate, but even if we were, our brains 
aren’t designed to achieve accuracy. Neural circuits that subserve social cogni-
tion appear to be involved in the processing of two types of information: socially 
relevant  external features of others (such as facial confi guration and biological 
motion), and socially relevant  inner features of the self (such as emotional experi-
ence and metacognitive processes; see Chapter 4). Th us, rather than conferring 
access to others’ inner states, our brains appear to be designed to draw on our own 
inner states when judging others’. Th is evidence from neuroscience is consistent 
with the long-held theoretical position of philosophers of mind that a brain-based 
capacity to perceive or otherwise gain objective knowledge of others’ inner states 
is impossible (Dennett, 1987; Skinner, 1953; Wittgenstein, 1958). What is going 
on in others’ heads is fundamentally intangible to us. 
 In sum, social psychologists tend toward the view that, whereas normal people 
are in the practice of drawing inferences about others’ mental and emotional states, 
we are neither able to nor motivated to maximize  accuracy in these inferences. 
 A Social Psychological View of Social Cognitive Capacity 
 What is the implication of this perspective for our understanding of social cog-
nitive capacity? Th e concept of social cognitive capacity is foundational to our 
approach as schizophrenia researchers (i.e., poor performance on an emotion rec-
ognition task indicates an inability to judge the emotional expressions of others), 
but if even normal people cannot accurately infer others’ mental and emotional 
states, then is capacity a bankrupt concept? 
 To our reading, the answer is no. Social psychologists do appear to be very 
interested in the role of capacity in social cognition, but in a diff erent way 

404

than are schizophrenia researchers. Since its very early days, social psychology 
has been concerned with the distinctively human capacity to generate impres-
sions about others’ thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and motives. Th is is illustrated in 
Heider and Simmel’s infl uential (1944) study of social attribution. Participants 
completed the social attribution task (SAT), which requires them to view and 
then describe “what happened” in a video of moving geometrical shapes. Th e 
authors found that normal subjects typically ascribed complex human motives 
and feelings to the shapes, and described a consistent storyline in which bul-
lied small shapes escape from a tormenting larger shape. In the years since 
this study, the understanding of the human capacity to ascribe mental states 
has been refi ned, and its neural underpinnings are emerging through research 
in social neuroscience. Th is line of research supports the view that humans 
have the capacity to generate and manipulate mental and emotional state 
representations. 
 Th ese two capacities have notable diff erences. Th e capacity to  generate social 
cognitive representations comes easily and automatically to most adults. However, 
the capacity to  manipulate these representations can be highly variable, even in 
high-functioning adults. Manipulating representations is a labor-intensive pro-
cess mediated by prefrontal executive circuitry. Because this capacity is scarce, 
people use it judiciously, and frequently seek short-cuts to minimize the dif-
fi culty of social cognitive processing. Th ese short cuts oft en take the form of 
 heuristics , which are described below. Th e term “cognitive miser” is used in 
social psychology to describe this human tendency to resist eff ortful mental 
processing. In addition to being scarce, the capacity to manipulate representa-
tions also is vulnerable to being handicapped through situational factors such as 
cognitive load and emotional arousal. For example, in a classic study, described 
further below, Gilbert, Pelham, and Krull (1988) showed that forcing people to 
memorize a string of digits while making social cognitive judgments did not 
aff ect their ability to  generate  social cognitive attributions but diminished their 
capacity to strategically  manipulate these attributions, which led to maladaptive 
judgments. 
 In sum, the social psychological literature appears to support a more circum-
scribed conceptualization of social cognitive capacity than does the schizophre-
nia literature. It includes the capacity to generate social cognitive representations, 
which is strong and stable in normal adults, and the capacity to manipulate these 
representations, which is variable and overlaps considerably with executive func-
tioning. What is not included, however, is the identifi cation of capacity with 
accuracy. 
 Social Cognitive Bias 
 In the schizophrenia literature, the concept of capacity has received more atten-
tion than the concept of bias. Th e opposite appears to be true in the social psy-
chological literature. To our reading, social psychologists see the capacities to

generate and manipulate representations as the parameters which constrain social 
cognition, whereas  biases  are the processes that drive social cognition. Th e most 
important type of bias process is called  heuristics . Heuristics are guess-making 
strategies that enable people to effi  ciently make judgments about phenomena 
that are impossibly complex and inaccessible. Because nearly all social cognitive 
judgments involve evaluation of intangible phenomena (i.e., others’ inner states), 
heuristics are a core social cognitive process. For example, Bob’s emotional state 
is fundamentally intangible to you, but you still want to make a judgment about 
it. Using heuristics, you might take your own feeling, or your desire about Bob’s 
feeling, to be a good enough guess about Bob’s feeling (“Because I’d like to believe 
that Bob likes me, I’ll take his smirk to mean that he is happy”). Heuristics are 
practically useful because they effi  ciently generate actionable social inferences 
that typically are in line with the subject’s situational goals. However, heuristic 
social cognitive judgments are always biased due to the fact that they do not draw 
on the actual inner states of others (e.g., your judgment of Bob’s feeling is biased 
by your own situational goal).   
 WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS PERSPECTIVE FOR 
SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH? 
 Th e normative perspective described above has implications for both 
capacity-oriented and bias-oriented research in schizophrenia. 
 Implications for Capacity-Oriented Research 
 Th is perspective implies that eff orts to quantify schizophrenia patients’ social 
cognitive capacity in terms of the  accuracy of their judgments may be off  track. 
(Aft er all, even healthy adults’ judgments are as likely to be inaccurate as accu-
rate.) Instead, it suggests that capacity should be quantifi ed in terms of the ability 
to generate and manipulate social cognitive representations, irrespective of accu-
racy. Schizophrenia researchers interested in pursuing this implication could start 
by recalibrating how we score existing measures. For example, research shows 
that schizophrenia participants’ responses on Heider and Simmel’s SAT deviate 
from the norm (Bell, Fiszdon, Greig, & Wexler, 2010). Th e social psychological 
perspective would caution against interpreting deviation in story interpretation, 
in and of itself, as evidence of social cognitive defi cit. Instead, it would recom-
mend that the term “defi cit” be used to describe only subjects who fail to generate 
mental state attributions at all. 
 Using this latter scoring approach, Klin (2000) found evidence of defi cit among 
autistic participants on the SAT, who tended to attribute physical instead of 
intentional attributes to the shapes (e.g., “Th e triangle moved quickly toward the 
circle”). In contrast, our lab found that whereas people with schizophrenia did 
indeed generate abnormal story narratives (e.g., “Th e circle is me annoying my 

406 
tre atm e nt a pproache s
brother”), they did not exhibit evidence of defi ciency. Th at is, they told unusual 
stories, but the stories included as many mental and emotional state attributions 
as those provided by healthy controls (Roberts, unpublished data). In contrast 
to our fi ndings, Horan and colleagues (2009) used a task similar to the SAT and 
found evidence that people with schizophrenia do generate fewer and less elabo-
rated mental and emotional state representations, suggesting a true defi cit in this 
ability. Nevertheless, these confl icting results demonstrate the importance of the 
distinction between defi cit (i.e., no representations) and accuracy (i.e., unusual 
representations) for understanding social cognitive abnormalities in schizophre-
nia, and they highlight the need for more research that will determine whether 
schizophrenia patients have true “defi cits” in the ability to generate social cogni-
tive representations. 
 Implications for Bias-Oriented Research 
 As noted above, in the schizophrenia literature, we generally view abnormal 
social cognitive judgments as resulting from defi cient capacity, but a growing 
literature is examining the role that bias may contribute to poor social cogni-
tive performance and is conceiving of bias as a mechanism of dysfunction. Th is 
view of bias diff ers from the social psychological perspective, in which bias is 
seen as a mechanism of normal functioning. Th at is, bias is not seen as an indi-
cator of failed accuracy but rather of successful heuristic use. Th is perspective 
argues against research on bias in schizophrenia that focuses on why patients 
“got it wrong” and suggests that a more relativistic approach might be appropri-
ate. Researchers may do well to ask questions like, “Why do some patients use 
heuristic strategies that lead to X bias, while non-ill subjects use heuristics that 
lead to Y bias?” 
 Th e potential value of this more relativistic perspective is illustrated in 
research using the  beads task. Th e beads task is a measure of bias in probabi-
listic reasoning that requires subjects to judge from which of two jars a series 
of beads is drawn. Th e dependent variable is the number of successively pre-
sented beads the subject views before picking the jar. Patients with delusions 
exhibit a “jumping to conclusions” bias on this task, as indicated by the fact 
that they lock in their judgment aft er fewer beads than is optimal according to 
Bayesian logic. From a social psychological standpoint, however, it is notable 
that non-ill participants also exhibit a bias, but in the opposite, conservative 
direction. Th ey wait to pick a jar until having viewed  more beads than is proba-
bilistically optimal (reviewed in Garety & Freeman, 1999). Th us, it is not the 
case that normal subjects make more accurate judgments, but rather that they 
use a diff erent heuristic strategy in making their judgment. In holding with this, 
in Chapter 9 of the present volume, Bentall and Udachina (2013) conceptualize 
bias in schizophrenia as continuous with bias in non-ill individuals, and empha-
size motivational factors that may contribute to patients’ selection of judgment-
making heuristics.

 The Dual-Process Framework 
 Above, we described how social psychological research diverges from schizophre-
nia research in its conceptualization of social cognitive capacity and bias. In this 
section, we describe a theoretical model that is consistent with the social psy-
chological perspective and that we believe holds promise for advancing research 
on social cognition in schizophrenia in the coming years. Already alluded to in 
several chapters in the present volume (Chapters 2, 4, and 11), the dual-process 
(DP) framework is parsimonious, empirically and methodologically robust, and 
coheres across behavioral and neural levels of analysis. Further, it suggests prom-
ising hypotheses regarding capacity- and bias-based mechanisms of social cogni-
tive dysfunction in schizophrenia that have powerful implications for treatment 
development. 
 Th e DP framework holds that social cognitive judgments emerge from the 
interaction of  automatic and  controlled cognitive processing (Chaiken & Trope, 
1999). Automatic processing is the primary mechanism for  generating initial 
social cognitive representations, and plays a large role in heuristic  manipulation 
of representations. It is fast and effi  cient, and takes place outside of the intention, 
awareness, and control of the subject. Automatic generation of social cognitive 
representations draws on early perception-based representations of others’ facial 
features and bodily motion, mediated in part by fusiform gyrus and superior tem-
poral sulcus, respectively. It also draws on well-rehearsed interpersonal scripts or 
stereotypes, and emotional experiences and representations of the subject’s own 
bodily and physiological states, as mediated by subcortical structures such as the 
amygdala and insula (Lieberman, 2007). 
 Th e neural mechanisms by which automatic processes subserve heuristic 
manipulation and assignment of social cognitive representations are not well 
understood. One hypothesized mechanism that has gained empirical support in 
recent years is based in the mirror neuron system (Carr et al., 2003). It appears that 
when a subject observes another, the other’s behavior is automatically represented 
in the subject’s brain as if she were performing it herself. Th is spurs automatic 
generation of subjective inner state representations as proto-hypotheses regarding 
the other’s possible inner states. It is as if the subject’s brain is saying, “If I were in 
Bob’s position, I would likely be thinking/feeling X. Th erefore, I imagine that Bob 
is thinking/feeling X.” As in the earlier example with Bob, this represents a heuris-
tic process because it substitutes an unanswerable question (how Bob is thinking/
feeling) with the answerable question (how the subject would be thinking/feeling 
if she were in Bob’s place). Additionally, as with other heuristics, this is a highly 
effi  cient process, which occurs largely outside of the subject’s awareness, inten-
tion, and control, thus furnishing an actionable impression of others’ thoughts, 
intentions, and feelings without burdening conscious processing. 
 Automatic processing has the advantage of enabling rapid, holistic evaluation 
of social situations, providing people with gistful impressions to guide behavior 
in the real world of fast-paced social interaction. However, automatic processing 
has the disadvantage of being vulnerable to maladaptive biases because it is not 

408 
tre atm e nt a pproache s
infl uenced by conscious, refl ective thought and is always based on partial, imper-
fect information. 
 In contrast to automatic processing, controlled social cognitive processing is 
slow, ineffi  cient, and late to initiate aft er stimulus presentation. It takes place within 
the intention, awareness, and control of the subject, and includes self-monitoring, 
deliberative reasoning, and impulse inhibition. Overlapping considerably with 
executive functioning, controlled social cognition is mediated primarily by medial, 
lateral, and ventral prefrontal circuitry (Lieberman, 2007). Controlled processing 
supports the capacity to consciously manipulate social cognitive representations, 
conferring the advantage of enabling subjects to strategically evaluate, modify, 
and suppress automatic impressions that may be maladaptive or inconsistent with 
the subject’s goals. However, controlled processing has the disadvantage of being 
ineffi  cient and having severely restricted capacity. 
 Th e basic DP model of social cognition is illustrated in Figure 17.1. Automatic 
processing responds immediately to a social stimulus, quickly and unconsciously 
generating an actionable impression on the basis of whatever combination of per-
cepts, emotion, cognitive schemas, and physiological inputs happen to be most 
salient at the time. Aft er roughly 500 ms post stimulus onset, controlled process-
ing  may or may not be engaged to modify or suppress this initial impression, 
depending on multiple factors. Controlled processing is less likely to be engaged if 
the automatic impression is highly salient; if the subject is experiencing cognitive 
load, emotional arousal, or distraction; is cognitively impaired; is unaware that 
the initial impression may be maladaptive; or is not motivated to question the ini-
tial impression. Failure to actively engage controlled cognition results in passive 
endorsement of the automatic impression, and subsequent controlled processing 
will be biased toward its continued endorsement. 
 In the DP framework, social cognitive  capacities comprise the automatic ability 
to generate mental and emotional state representations, and the controlled ability 
to manipulate these representations.  Biases refer to systematic response tenden-
cies that emerge out of the interaction of these capacities and automatic infl u-
ences on judgment. Th e interaction of capacity and bias within the DP framework 
is illustrated in a study by Gilbert and colleagues (Gilbert et al., 1988) in which 
healthy participants were shown a fi lm of a young woman behaving in an anxious 
manner and asked to judge the cause of her behavior. Subjects who were forced 
to answer the question while holding a string of numbers in memory judged her 
to be a constitutionally neurotic person, whereas subjects not under cognitive 
load judged her to be reacting to a situational stressor. Th e loaded group had

controlled processing handicapped and thus were guided in their judgment by the 
 fundamental attribution error , a normative heuristic in which people automati-
cally assume that behavior is driven by intention and personality. Th e downside of 
this heuristic in this case is that it leads to an unfairly derogatory appraisal of the 
woman’s character. In contrast, the nonloaded group deployed controlled process-
ing to override this initial impression and make more prosocial situationalizing 
attributions for the woman’s behavior (e.g., she just saw a scary movie). Th is study 
illustrates that when healthy adults evaluate others’ inner states, their judgments 
oft en are guided by social goals rather than accuracy, but that their ability to use 
these goals to guide judgment may be moderated by the availability of controlled 
processing capacity, which, when unavailable, leaves judgments to be based on 
biased automatic impressions. 
 Applying the Dual-Process Framework to Social Cognition 
in Schizophrenia 
 To our thinking, the DP framework provides a strong basis for applying social 
psychological principles to the study of social cognition in schizophrenia. A 
plausible initial DP model is that social cognitive abnormality in schizophrenia 
results from two factors: (1) diminished controlled processing capacity and (2) 
excessively salient and aberrant automatic social cognitive impressions. Th ere is 
broad support in the literature for the fi rst factor, as schizophrenia is linked to 
diminished prefrontal functioning (Ragland, Yoon, Minzenberg, & Carter, 2007). 
Th ere is also support for the second factor in the literature on dopamine-mediated 
aberrant salience experience (Kapur, 2003), including evidence that dysregulated 
neural signaling causes feelings of social threat, alien control, and other forms 
of aberrant intentionality (Roberts, Stutes, & Hoff man, in press). Th is two-factor 
model predicts the generation of highly salient but maladaptively biased auto-
matic social cognitive impressions (e.g., the impression of being the object of hos-
tility) in combination with a handicapped ability to evaluate, suppress, or modify 
these dysfunctional impressions. Other hypotheses may also be tested within the 
DP framework, such as those relating to reductions in the automatic capacity to 
generate social cognitive representations, as suggested by the Horan study above. 
 Researchers using the DP framework have developed a range of well-validated 
manipulation and measurement techniques. For example, automatic and con-
trolled capacities can be dissociated through a range of experimental manipula-
tions, including cognitive load (as described in the Gilbert study, above), speeded 
tasks, use of distraction, obfuscating the automatic source of an impression, and 
depletion of controlled resources (Bargh, 1994). From a data analytic standpoint, 
techniques such as signal detection (Green & Swets, 1966) and process dissocia-
tion (Payne & Stewart, 2007) have been developed that are capable of reliably dis-
sociating capacity and bias parameters. 
 To be sure, application of DP techniques to schizophrenia research requires 
thoughtful and creative adaptation. Readers are referred to Martin and Penn’s

(2002) study, an application of Gilbert et al.’s (1988) paradigm to schizophrenia, 
which shows both the potential value of the social psychological perspective and 
the diffi  culty of adapting it to schizophrenia. 
 Treatment Implications of the Dual-Process Framework 
 Part III of this volume addresses the research on social cognitive treatment 
in schizophrenia. Interventions such as Integrated Psychological Th erapy 
(IPT)/Integrated Neurocognitive Th erapy (INT) (Chapter 13) and Cognitive 
Enhancement Th erapy (CET; Chapter 14) conceive of social cognition and neu-
rocognition as closely related, and are designed to improve both in a synergistic 
manner. Th ese represent the oldest and most intensive social cognitive interven-
tions, and have amassed the most evidence of effi  cacy. More recently, interven-
tions such as Metacognitive Th erapy (MCT) and Social Cognition and Interaction 
Training (SCIT) have built off  of evidence of the relative independence of social 
cognition, attempting to improve social functioning more effi  ciently by enhancing 
social cognition at the exclusion of neurocognition. Initial results from these new 
interventions are promising, but much more research is needed. Unfortunately, 
problems with measurement and theoretical integration are rate-limiting factors 
in the treatment literature, just as they are in the basic descriptive research. 
 In addition to its implications for research on the mechanisms of social cogni-
tive abnormality, the DP framework has implications for treatment development 
in schizophrenia. Foremost, it suggests that the treatment goal of improving the 
accuracy of social cognitive judgments may be a red herring. Not only is accu-
racy not the typical goal or the outcome of normal social cognition, but com-
pletely accurate social cognitive judgment making is likely to be maladaptive. It 
is well established that adaptive social cognition is characterized by a range of 
biases (Haselton & Buss, 2003), including a self-serving bias for explaining posi-
tive events, a situationalizing bias for negative events, and a conservative bias for 
probabilistic judgments, among others (Fiske & Taylor, 2008). Further, given that 
the tendency to believe in mind reading is a common delusion in schizophrenia, it 
may be inadvisable for social cognition training to teach that it is possible to read 
others’ minds and emotions. Instead of teaching patients how to “get it right” in 
social situations, the DP framework suggests that it may be preferable to design 
interventions that teach patients that it is impossible to know for sure what others 
might be thinking and feeling. 
 Th is goal would be in line with the broader trend in empirically supported 
psychological treatment development, which is moving away from an empha-
sis on correcting inaccurate thinking toward an emphasis on acceptance of 
uncertainty (Hayes, Villatte, Levin, & Hildebrandt, 2011). Initial applications of 
acceptance-based interventions in schizophrenia have been promising. For exam-
ple, one preliminary study targeting psychotic symptoms found treatment-related 
decreases in the believability of symptoms and in symptom-related distress 
(Bach & Hayes, 2002). Th is fi nding was subsequently independently replicated

(Gaudiano & Herbert, 2006). One might hypothesize that an analogous social 
cognitive intervention would lead to patients having decreased confi dence in 
their ability to infer others’ mental and emotional states alongside decreased 
social anxiety and distress. 
 A second treatment implication of the DP model stems from the fact that con-
trolled social cognitive capacity is a scarce resource, and that even healthy adults 
must oft en behave as “cognitive misers,” relying more on automatic impressions 
than on controlled evaluation. From this perspective, interventions that teach 
patients to slow down and think carefully may not be likely to succeed (especially 
given the cognitive defi cits associated with schizophrenia), and may be teaching 
a brand of social cognition that is itself abnormal and unlikely to be useful in 
dynamically evolving social situations. Instead, the DP framework suggests that 
social cognitive interventions of the future may do well to harness people’s natural 
tendency toward quick, heuristic processing. For example, patients may benefi t 
more from practice in manipulating social gestalts than from practice in gather-
ing and evaluating pieces of social cognitive evidence. 
 Th e pitfalls of overemphasis on controlled processing are highlighted by 
emerging social psychological research on  cognitive fl uency , which refers to the 
experiences of ease or diffi  culty that accompany controlled cognition (Schwarz, 
2004). Th is research has established that when people experience the act of think-
ing to be diffi  cult, this experience in and of itself is interpreted by the subject as 
evidence  against the product of the cognitive act. For example, the commonly 
used psychotherapeutic technique of  generating alternatives  requires patients to 
consciously think up alternative interpretations to compete with an existing dys-
functional belief or conclusion. If the patient generates a large number of alterna-
tives, to the extent that the process of generating alternatives is experienced as 
diffi  cult, the patient may essentially conclude, “It was so hard for me to imagine 
alternatives that my initial impression  must be correct.” Th is suggests the unset-
tling possibility that our widespread technique of teaching patients to use delib-
erate, strategic social cognition may not only be ineff ective, but may actually be 
counterproductive! 
 In conclusion, we have shared two thoughts on how the social psychological lit-
erature may be used to advance research on social cognition in schizophrenia. First, 
the social psychological perspective suggests that our convention in schizophre-
nia research of operationalizing social cognitive capacity in terms of the  accuracy 
of social cognitive judgments may be off  base. As suggested by the recent expert 
consensus panel on social cognition in schizophrenia (Green et al., 2008), modi-
fying our view of capacity to match the social psychological perspective may help 
us to address rate-limiting factors in our research. Second, a promising method 
for aligning our research with social psychological research is the DP framework. 
Attractive features include its basis in the normative research, parsimony, com-
patibility across behavioral and neural levels of analysis, established methods 
and research paradigms, ability to contextualize both capacity- and bias-based 
research, and its implications for social cognitive treatment development.

 Social cognition has been a focus of research in the normative literature for over 
80 years. We hope that this chapter, and this volume more broadly, will inspire 
schizophrenia researchers and clinicians to delve further into the rich normative 
literature in the years to come, so that we may speed progress in the understand-
ing and treatment of social cognitive dysfunction in this illness.
