Acknowledgments
I thank Brendon Joseph, who was my team leader when I started my journey in ITIL. 
Without his insistence, I don’t know if I would’ve taken up my first ITIL training.
I also thank all the organizations that I have worked in for believing in me, my 
managers who turned over the reins to projects that taught me the nuances of ITIL, 
my customers who questioned the logic and have helped me shape and reflect on the 
designs, and my team, without whom I wouldn’t have been able to complete the projects 
I embarked on. I also thank my students in various classroom and online trainings who 
helped me think like a trainer. Finally I thank my online readers who pestered me for a 
long time, asking why I hadn’t written a book on ITIL yet.

Preface
When my first book, Communication for IT Professionals, got published, many people 
told me that they were surprised that it was a book on soft skills rather than on ITIL, 
due to my prowess in ITIL circles. I knew it was forthcoming, and as it happens often 
in the movies, an opportunity came knocking when my debut book hit the stands. An 
acquisition editor from Apress asked me if I was willing to publish a book on ITIL. We 
shook hands, and within a month, we set the ball rolling.
I have worked as an ITIL trainer. ITIL concepts are pretty dry, you may start 
mumbling them one after another. So, I found a way to make this interesting. I always 
explained the concepts with a couple of examples, one from non-IT and the other from 
IT. This trick worked, and the training feedback further justified my faith in providing 
examples. Even when I wrote articles on ITIL-based topics, I always added an example. 
And the appreciation came in! This is the approach that I have undertaken in this book. 
You will find plenty of examples to relate to and quickly learn the topic rather than 
memorize phrases for passing the examination.
I signed the book contract while I was working in Sydney, and wrote a few chapters 
before moving back to Bengaluru for the arrival of my second child. I lost the momentum 
that I had gathered in Sydney, and the book schedule got delayed, at least by four months. 
Toward the end, I burned the midnight oil a number of days to finish shaping the book 
that people always wanted me to write.
Although I have done several ITIL implementations, trainings, and consultations, the 
journey of Become ITIL Foundation Certified in 7 Days taught me several possibilities and 
new approaches that I hadn’t thought of earlier. It helped to tighten my hold on the ITIL 
framework.
I am heartbroken that this book project that I traversed the past year has ended. 
However, it gives me a chance to look toward future book projects. I have several ideas: 
advanced ITIL topics, DevOps, project management, and last but definitely not the least 
priority, a fiction book. Time and ideas will dictate my next book!

Introduction
The people who undertake ITIL Foundation certification are more often than not IT 
professionals who work full time and are trying to cram training and certification exams 
in between. Become ITIL Foundation Certified in 7 Days is designed and organized for IT 
professionals who have the will to go the extra mile and have the motivation to learn and 
grow.
The book is organized to enable you to be certification exam ready by the end of the 
seventh day. It is structured to help you study for a couple of hours a day, and in seven 
days time, without any additional reading, write the ITIL Foundation exam successfully.
I have considered that each day you have around three hours to spare for ITIL 
Foundation preparation, and in just a week of preparation will earn you the certification 
that can turn your career on its head.
The book is structured based on the lifecycle phases of ITIL. So the journey through 
the book will take you through step-by-step building blocks on IT services and how they 
evolved and were designed, implemented, and maintained.
If you wish to skip ahead, you are not going to miss the connection, as each chapter 
stands on its own and elaborates on the specifics. However, it is common to find 
references and interfaces to previous phases.
Chapters 1 and 2 offer general management topics and can be used outside of ITIL 
too. However, these chapters are included as the information is used heavily in ITIL and 
forms the basis of many activities, processes, and functions. Chapter 3 introduces the ITIL 
lifecycle phases, and Chapters 4 through 8 are dedicated to each of the phases in ITIL. 
The final chapter, Chapter 9, provides all the tips and tricks you need to pass the exam. 
As a bonus, in this chapter, I have answered several frequently asked questions (FAQs) 
on ITIL-based careers. Alternatively, you can read Chapter 9 first, and then start from the 
first chapter to give you the context for questions you might have on the choice of an ITIL 
career.

CHAPTER 1
Service Management as a 
Practice
Activities in the information technology (IT) industry can be broadly categorized into 
IT projects (waterfall, agile, etc) and IT service management. The design, development, 
testing, and creation of computer programs, mobile applications, telecommunications, 
data processing, and analytics engines, among others, come under the IT projects’ scope. 
The IT products that are developed need to be maintained on an ongoing basis. They need 
to be fixed when they break down. Thus, the IT service management sector must take care 
of the maintenance of these IT products. Maintenance activities include upkeep of the 
infrastructure and software the way it was designed to work. It further includes activities 
like monitoring jobs, patching, performing administrative tasks, handling batch tasks, and 
optimizing performance.
IT projects are driven through frameworks such as Waterfall and Agile 
methodologies. IT service management, on the other hand, runs on frameworks such 
as ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library), COBIT (Control Objectives for 
Information and Related Technology), or MOF (Microsoft Operations Framework).
Let’s start by discussing the importance of service management.
1.1  Importance of Service Management
When you buy a product, say a smartphone, what are some of the things that you will 
consider? You would look at the features, brand, and price for sure. But what else comes 
up on the list? Perhaps service-related options such as cost of servicing, warranty, 
availability of service centers, parts covered under the service, and turnaround times 
are important. In fact, today, a brand gets its value not only from the products it has on 
the market, but also on the service factor. Apple makes the most popular phone today in 
iPhone. What else makes the iPhone click? The international warranty, proximity to Apple 
stores across the globe, professional approach to fixing problems, and the no nonsense 
approach to keeping the customer happy are of foremost importance.
I repeat. A brand gets its value from the services it offers. Think of all the cars you 
have owned and the service comfort you have had within the service provider. Yes, the 
service provider plays a major role in keeping things in motion. It could be the tangibles 
such as your iPhone 7 or your Chevrolet car. Or, it could be intangibles such as electricity,

mobile Internet, and landscaping. The services offered collectively fall under service 
management, which branches out toward various specializations like IT, hospitality, and 
medicine. According to the ITIL publication, service management is defined as:
A set of specialized organizational capabilities for providing value to 
customers in the form of services.
The specialized organizational capabilities point to the technical maturity, 
experience, customer service, and service frameworks that the service provider brings to 
the table in servicing the customers, meeting their needs, and creating value.
1.2  Introduction to IT Service Management
There was a time when there was business and then there was IT. Businesses had their 
set of practices and IT was a supporting agent, helping businesses achieve their tasks, like 
supplying the business with a word processor for drafting contracts and providing them 
the ability to compute complex formulas. Without IT, businesses could survive, although 
surely with some inconvenience.
Today, the world of business has been turned on its head. You take IT out of business 
and the business will cease to exist. In other words, there is no business without IT. The 
business relies on IT for its sustenance and IT is not a support function anymore. Rather, 
it is a partner that enables businesses to achieve their goals and succeed in beating their 
competitors. Try to think of a midsize business where IT may not be involved. Aha! I 
know your results came up blank. To reiterate, IT is a part of the business and there is no 
looking back.
IT service management is defined as the implementation and management of 
quality IT services that meet the needs of the business. IT services are provided by IT 
service providers (the entity that provides IT service to internal and external customers) 
through an appropriate mix of people, processes, and information technology.
There is increased pressure on IT to deliver on its services. IT must deliver services 
that not only meet its objectives, but also does it effectively and efficiently. And it must be 
done at a minimal possible cost. The competition in the IT service management industry 
is fierce. You have some of the biggest names playing ball, cutting down on the IT costs, 
and providing the best in class service. The world of IT service management is challenging 
with ever changing technology, exciting with innovative ideas coming into play, and at the 
same time a race that can be won only if you couple technology with management.
1.3  Welcome to the World of ITIL
The history of ITIL is nebulous and inconsistent. It started sometime during the late 1980s 
as a collection of best practices in IT management. A department in the UK government, 
known as the OGC (Office of Government Commerce), sanctioned the coalition. 
Basically, the best practices of various IT departments and companies in the United 
Kingdom were studied and documented. It is believed that most of the initial practices 
that constituted ITIL came from IBM.

Chapter 1 ■ Service Management as a Practice

The first version of ITIL was bulky and lacked direction with a compilation of over 
30 books. The second version of ITIL was cut down to nine books in 2000, but mainly 
revolved around two books: service delivery and service support. The ITIL certifications 
were based on these two books as well. ITIL v2 introduced ten processes, five each from 
service delivery and service support. I started my ITIL journey with ITIL v2.
ITIL v2 was process centric. IT organizations were expected to operate around the 
ITIL processes. The processes were interconnected but lacked a broader vision and a flow 
to move things along.
The shortcomings and inadequacies in v2 gave rise to ITIL v3 in 2007. It had an 
excess of 20 processes, spanning across the entire lifecycle of a service, from conception 
up to a point where the service runs on regular improvement cycles. I will delve into the 
details in the Chapter 2.
ITIL v3 came out with five books, each book spanning a lifecycle phase of an IT service.
ITIL v3 has penetrated across most IT organizations. Even the conservative IT 
organizations have embraced the ITIL v3 service management framework with open 
arms. The framework is rampant in the industry today and enjoys the monopolistic 
nature, except for Microsoft, which adheres to a derivative version of ITIL, the Microsoft 
Operations Framework.
In 2011, ITIL v3 received a minor update where a couple of new processes were 
added along with some minute changes in definitions and concepts.
The latest version of ITIL is referred to as ITIL 2011 and some people refer to it as 
ITIL v3 2011, indicating the version and the revision year. It’s been close to a decade since 
the new stable version was introduced, and colloquially people refer to it as simply ITIL, 
without any versions or revision years appended to it. ITIL currently has 26 processes and 
four functions.
1.4  Why ITIL Is Successful
ITIL has been dominant for the past two decades. There are no other service 
management frameworks that are competing for space. It is also quite lonely in the club 
of service management frameworks. Why do you think this is the case?
A lot of things have worked in ITIL’s favor. It has a single objective—to deliver value 
to the business. To deliver unparalleled value, it has adopted the following characteristics:
• 
ITIL is based on best practices
• 
ITIL is nonprescriptive
• 
ITIL is vendor and technology neutral
• 
ITIL is nonproprietary
Let’s examine each of these characteristics in detail.

Chapter 1 ■ Service Management as a Practice
4
1.4.1  ITIL Is Based on Best Practices
One of the chief reasons why ITIL is so successful is because it was born out of the 
management practices across leading IT services organizations. ITIL borrowed all its 
concepts from the best practices that existed at the time and has built on this stable 
foundation since then. Don’t forget that the best practices discussed here are a result of 
efforts from the leaders of the IT services industry and invaluable experiences that made 
these companies successful in the first place.
1.4.2  ITIL Is Nonprescriptive
ITIL is a framework, not a set of policies and rules, but rather a set of guidelines and best 
practices. It has been time tested and adopted from the leading organizations and has 
gone through several iterations of improvements since its inception.
ITIL does not prescribe what the organizations must do. It describes the best 
practices in achieving service management-related objectives, and the organization 
implementing it is free to tweak and bend the process around the edges as needed. In 
other words, it gives you the flexibility that is needed, considering every service provider 
organization is different and no two businesses (customers) are the same.
1.4.3  ITIL Is Vendor and Technology Neutral
ITIL can be implemented across various technologies and across any organization. There 
are no limits, and any advancement in technology, including the cloud-based services, 
does not make ITIL obsolete.
I have seen ITIL implemented in hardcore IT services organizations, manufacturing 
companies, health care, retail, banking; in short, in any industry. I have worked on ITIL 
that was implemented in the legendary mainframe systems, as well as the modern SAP, 
data warehousing, mobile application, and cloud services technologies. ITIL has been 
just as effective with physical servers as it is with virtual machines. ITIL can work with the 
Waterfall methodology of project management, as well as the Agile methodology. Devops 
too! In short, it works no matter what you bring to the table.
1.4.4  ITIL Is Nonproprietary
ITIL is owned by the UK government. The mantle has been handed to Axelos to develop 
and manage the copyrighted ITIL publication, along with training and certification.
Organizations are free to implement ITIL. They are not required to pay any royalty, 
nor do they need to inform Axelos that they have implemented ITIL. The nonproprietary 
nature has made this service management framework far more popular and has brought 
in a number of experts to collaborate. Just like open source!

Chapter 1 ■ Service Management as a Practice

1.5  Best Practices Trump Proprietary Knowledge
As mentioned earlier, best practices are collated from various organizations. Some 
organizations may be doing a great job in gathering requirements, while others focus on 
identifying improvements. So, when you take the best of such organizations and bring 
that together, you have knowledge that is enviable.
Proprietary knowledge, on the other hand, stays within close quarters, and fewer 
heads have been banged together to come up with proprietary knowledge, which may be 
good, but not as diverse and experienced as public frameworks such as ITIL.
Proprietary knowledge is developed for the sole purpose of meeting the 
organization’s objectives. It is not meant to be adapted and flexed to meet other 
organization objectives. Moreover, if you are adopting proprietary knowledge, you are 
expected to pay a fee or royalty of some kind. Public frameworks are free.
When you can get an all-you-can-eat buffet for free, why would you opt for a paid 
a-la-carte dinner?
1.6  Introduction to IT Service
As mentioned earlier, ITIL v3 is a framework that is centered on IT services. So, it is 
imperative to first understand the meaning of a service, according to ITIL. Here is the 
official definition of an IT service:
A service is a means of delivering value to customers by facilitating 
outcomes that customers want to achieve, without the ownership of 
specific costs and risks.
I will break the definition down, part by part, and also provide examples to help you 
comprehend the concept, which will be the core for everything else you will learn from 
this point forward.
1.6.1  Understanding the Definition
The best way to understand anything that is complex is to break it into parts. This is my 
method for understanding the concept of IT services.
The first section of the definition states: means of delivering value to customers by 
facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve.
IT services in ITIL are defined from a customer viewpoint. Essentially, an IT service 
must deliver value to the customer. The value delivered must be something that the 
customer considers as helpful. Let’s take the example of an IT service that is quite 
common across the board: the Internet. An Internet service delivers value to customers to 
help them achieve their objectives. So, it fits the bill of what an IT service is all about.  
If the Internet service provider (ISP) were to provide speeds upward of 100MB per second 
for a customer who only checks e-mails, it would be overkill. The high speeds offered by 
ISPs are generally appreciated by gamers and social networking users. In contrast, the 
customer who uses Internet for checking e-mails does not find any special value between 

Chapter 1 ■ Service Management as a Practice
6
a high-speed Internet and a normal Internet connection. But for a user who hogs a lot 
of bandwidth, it is valuable. To summarize, the value of an IT service is derived from the 
customer’s standpoint. So from this example, value to one customer may not be value to 
another.
Now the last part of the definition states: without the ownership of specific costs  
and risks.
The customer enjoys the service but does not pay for specific costs. Instead, they pay 
for the service as a lump sum. For example, in the Internet example, the customer pays 
for the high-speed Internet a fixed sum every month, not a specific price for the elements 
that make up a service, such as the infrastructure that supports it, the people who 
maintain and design, and the other governmental regulation costs. Instead, the customer 
just pays an agreed amount.
The final part of the definition states that the customer does not take ownership of 
the risks. Yes, but the Internet service provider does. What are some of the risks that exist 
in the IT world pertaining to ISPs?
• 
Fiber cuts
• 
Availability of support technicians
• 
Infrastructure stability among others
1.6.2  Understanding ITIL with a Non-IT Example
When I train ITIL students in a classroom setting, they often understand ITIL better when 
I relate the concepts of ITIL with non-IT examples. I am going to leverage on this teaching 
maturity in this book and provide non-IT examples at all crucial junctures.
Let’s take an example of a lawn mowing service. It’s a simple service and quite 
common in most parts of the world. The customer hires a landscaping company to mow 
the vast areas of lush lawn. The landscaping company sends in two landscapers, each 
handling a lawn mowing machine.
In this example, the customer pays an agreed rate to the landscaping company, and 
as per the agreement, the entire area where there is overgrown lawn will be mowed to 25 
mm height. The landscaping company conveys the requirements to their landscapers, 
who go ahead and do what they are supposed to.
Let’s relate this example to the ITIL service definition: delivering value to customers 
by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve. The customer gets value through 
the mowing of the lawn. This is exactly the service that the customer wanted in the first 
place and he has gotten it.
From the definition: without the ownership of specific costs and risks. The customer is 
paying a certain agreed amount to the landscaping company and not paying the specifics, 
such as the hourly wage for the landscapers, rent for the mowing machines, and other costs 
like fuel for mowing machines. The customer also does not own the risks. If the landscapers 
get hurt during the lawn mowing operation, it is not the customer’s problem. If the mowing 
machines stutter and stop working, once again, the customer is not responsible. In other 
words, the customer does not own the risks that come from the service.
Thus, both parts of ITIL service are satisfied with the lawn mowing service example. 
I hope you now have a better understanding of the concept of ITIL service. If you have 
doubts, I suggest you reread these sections before proceeding any further.

1.7  Main Stakeholders in Service Management
Who are the stakeholders? The Oxford dictionary states a stakeholder is a person or 
persons having an interest or concern in something. So, this something here is service 
management. In a service management organization, you have a number of stakeholders, 
whom you’ll learn about during our journey in learning ITIL. But the main ones who are 
absolutely necessary are:
• 
Customers
• 
Users
• 
Suppliers
1.7.1  Customers
Customers are perhaps the most common group across all businesses, projects, and 
management frameworks. The person who pays for the commodity or the delivery that he 
is getting in return is a customer. In service management, a customer pays for the service.
I will again explain with an example. An accounting company contracts with an 
Internet service provider to provide high-speed Internet. The accounting company is the 
customer as it is paying for the services. Simple enough?
1.7.2  Users
Now it gets confusing. You thought that a user was a customer, and now you will see that 
they have a different role, a prominent one, differentiated from the customer role. A user 
is someone who uses the service, not necessarily the one who pays for the service. A 
customer can also be a user, but the distinction is between the person paying and the one 
using the services.
In the earlier example, the accounting company’s employees will use the Internet. 
They are the users. They don’t pay for the service, they only use it.
At home, I pay for my Internet connection. I use the Internet as well. So, I am both 
the customer and the user.
1.7.3  Suppliers
The service provider leverages other parties to deliver the services. These third parties are 
referred to as suppliers, and they could provide hardware, software, services, or people.
Let’s go back to the earlier example involving the accounting company obtaining 
Internet service through an ISP. The cabling between the ISP and the accounting company 
is managed by a different company. This other company is referred to as a supplier, as they 
are supplying their goods and services to the service provider, not to the customer.

Chapter 1 ■ Service Management as a Practice

1.8  Internal and External Customers
Not all customers are the same. They come in different shapes and colors. However, in the 
IT service management area, customers can be broadly divided into two types:
• 
Internal customers
• 
External customers
In this section, I’ll explain the two types of customers and the differences between 
them. Figure 1-1 depicts the concepts of internal and external customers.
1.8.1  The Concept
In Figure 1-1, you will see two organizations: A and B. Organization B has multiple business 
units and an IT team as well. Organization A merely has business units and no IT team.

Figure 1-1.  Internal and external customers

Chapter 1 ■ Service Management as a Practice

The business units within Organization B get their IT support from their own 
organization’s IT team. As the business units and the IT teams are embedded within  
the same organization, the business units are considered to be internal customers for the 
IT teams.
Now you can guess who the external customers are, can’t you? Organization A’s 
business units get their IT support from Organization B. The key here is that the IT 
support is being provided for an entity outside the organization. This setup essentially 
makes Organization A external customers for the IT team sitting in Organization B.
1.8.2  The Difference
There is a world of difference between internal and external customers. Because 
internal customers are from the same organization, the level of service offered can be 
lax compared to that for an external customer. It is quite likely that an IT team could find 
themselves relaxed with the internal customers compared to external customers. Ideally, 
no organization would like their internal users being treated unequally over external 
customers. So, as a good practice, there are similar service-level agreements (SLA) in 
place between customers (for both internal and external) to set an expectation and to 
measure against it.
At the end of the day, it is really just business. The difference between internal and 
external customers is merely measured in terms of finances. External customers pay real 
money, and hence their importance is at a high. Internal customers, on the other hand, 
are an obligation, something that organization must tend to and cannot live without. 
The internal IT team charges the internal business units notionally. No real money gets 
transferred between the business units and the IT team, but is noted only in the ledgers. 
It’s like taking money out of your left pocket and depositing it into your right pocket.
1.9  Processes
ITIL is made up of processes. Just as with services, you cannot get into the nitty gritty of 
ITIL if you don’t understand the concept of a process. I will give you some examples to 
emphasize its importance, so that your foundation is strong for what you have to build on 
for your career. First, the official definition. ITIL defines a process as:
A structured set of activities designed to accomplish a specific objective. 
A process takes one or more inputs and turns them into defined outputs.
You could envision a process as a set of activities that you need to perform, one after 
another, to achieve something. Each activity that you perform sets the precedence for the 
next one, and then the next. The objective of a process would be to achieve an output that 
is along the expected lines and as desired.
Now for an example to make the concept simple and digestible. A process is very 
similar to a recipe for cooking a dish. In a recipe, you have several steps that you need to 
follow, as instructed, to get the dish you desire.

Chapter 1 ■ Service Management as a Practice
10
Let’s look at the recipe for an egg omelet. It goes something like this:
Step 1: Break a couple of eggs into a bowl
Step 2: Whisk it until it becomes fluffy
Step 3: Add salt and pepper to the mixture
Step 4: Heat a nonstick frying pan, and melt some butter until 
it foams
Step 5: Pour the egg mixture onto the pan, and tilt the pan 
until it covers the base
Step 6: Cook for a minute or two, and flip the omelet and cook 
it for a minute more
Step 7: Serve the omelet hot with toasted bread
You need to follow the steps to the tee to get an egg omelet. You cannot  
interchange any two steps to get the same output. In IT language, this is the process to 
make an egg omelet.
The main aspect of a process is the interconnectivity between the individual steps, and 
collectively, all the steps work toward a common goal, a common objective that is desired.
1.9.1  Characteristics of a Process
The comparison of a recipe with the ITIL process is the first step toward understanding it. 
Going one level deeper, every process has characteristics that orient the outcome toward 
the objective at hand.
There are a number of characteristics that a process must possess in order to be one, 
and the main ones are:
• 
Processes are measurable
• 
Processes deliver specific results
• 
Processes serve customers
• 
Processes respond to specific triggers
Let’s looks at these characteristics in detail.
1.9.1.1  Processes Are Measurable
Every process that is defined in ITIL must be measurable. This is the only way to 
understand how the process is performing, and the only way you can set benchmarks for 
future improvements.
Some measurements could be derived from the triple constraints of project 
management, such as time, cost, and scope. Along with it, a process could be measured 
on productivity (efficiency) and the quality it delivers (effectiveness).

Chapter 1 ■ Service Management as a Practice
11
1.9.1.2  Process Deliver Specific Results
If you start following the recipe for an egg omelet but end up fixing scrambled eggs, the 
recipe has failed in its purpose and its reason to exist. Likewise, a process exists to deliver 
results that are predefined and as desired. In other words, there is an outcome that is 
along the expected lines at the end of a process cycle.
1.9.1.3  Processes Serve Customers
Without customers, service management has no meaning. ITIL has no basis. And, that 
translates to processes being irrelevant. So, in order for a process to function, it needs to 
serve a customer. Whether the customer is internal or external is irrelevant.
1.9.1.4  Processes Respond to Specific Triggers
When do you start fixing an egg omelet? When you are hungry. When your loved ones are 
hungry. When your customers order one (if you are a restaurateur). The common thread 
is that there is a spark that sets off the need to prepare an egg omelet. This spark is the 
trigger that sets the motion in play. I will discuss this further in the next section.
1.9.2  The Process Model
One level deeper takes us to processes. I mentioned earlier that a process will contain 
a specific trigger, an input, and an output. Apart from the core basics, there are other 
components that make a process rugged and open for improvements.
In Figure 1-2, the middle block (process) consists of the essentials. It contains the 
list of activities (remember the steps in the recipe example?), procedures and work 
instructions for detailing the activities, roles for those who play their part in the process, 
improvements if any, and metrics for measuring performance.

Chapter 1 ■ Service Management as a Practice
12
Every process needs governance to control and guide the process toward efficiency 
and effectiveness. This is represented in the top block: process control. It contains policies, 
identifies process owners, lists process objectives, and, most importantly, receives 
feedback about a process (generally from the output) and uses it to improve the process.
The final block in the process model is the process enabler. Basically, this block 
consists of components that are needed to support the process and its activities. For a 
process to be implemented and operationalized, you need resources such as people, 
capital, infrastructure, application, and information. You would also need expertise or 
capabilities that come from people, knowledge, management, organization, and other 
processes.
1.10  Functions
Before I discuss functions, let’s take a look at organization structures. It is quite common 
these days for there to be teams with people who have expertise in one area. Examples 
could be the networking team, the Unix team, the Windows team, the Java team, and 
the web development team. It is also in vogue that teams are carved out based on the 
depth of knowledge. An example would be a Network L1 team (junior), Network L2 team 
(senior), and Network L3 team (expert teams, the architects). L1 teams consist of people 
with less experience and the tasks they are asked to take care of are quite basic and 
administrative in nature. For an L2 team, it gets a little more complicated, and they could 
be asked to troubleshoot and diagnose outages. A L3 team could be your top notch team 
who not only provides support when L2 needed but also helps architecting networks.

The teams that I have been referring to are known as functions in ITIL, nothing 
more, nothing less. There are only four functions that are defined in ITIL, and all of them 
come into play during the entire lifecycle of ITIL framework. The official definition of a 
function is:
A team or group of people and the tools or other resources they use to 
carry out one or more processes or activities.
Intersect Between Processes and Functions
There are processes and there are functions in ITIL. While there are 26 processes, there 
are only four functions. Processes don’t run by themselves. They need people to carry 
out the individual process activities. And the people the processes look for come from 
functions. To state it simply, functions provide the resources needed by the processes to 
complete their objectives.
Within the organization where you work, there are verticals—say banking, retail, and 
insurance. There are processes that cut across all the verticals of the organization such as 
human resources. The people in the verticals perform their role in the human resources 
process, which is horizontal cutting across all verticals, even though they are a part of a 
function. This would be an example of how a process leverages on functions for carrying 
out the set objectives.
Figure 1-3 illustrates the intersect that I have explained. You can replace the 
functions with the verticals in your organization and the processes with the common 
processes such as travel process, promotion processes, and others to establish a better 
understanding.

1.13  Summary
In this chapter you were introduced to the exciting world of ITIL, its importance, its history, 
and the IT service management industry. I introduced the concept of an IT service, which is 
the fulcrum on which ITIL runs its processes. I also presented the various stakeholders that 
you can expect to find in an ITIL environment. Lastly, I discussed processes and functions. 
I will delve deeper into the individual processes from Chapters 4 onward. Functions are 
discussed in detail in Chapter 7.
In the next chapter, you will be introduced to the concepts that are an integral part of 
the ITIL environment.

CHAPTER 2
Generic Concepts
ITIL is a de facto standard for IT service management. However, service management per 
se is based on certain management basics that need to be well understood before I start 
to explain the specifics.
In this chapter, I will introduce a number of service management concepts. These 
concepts are generic, and whether or not you are dealing with ITIL, you probably either 
have already used them or will soon start using them. This chapter lays the foundation for 
understanding ITIL.
2.1  Utility and Warranty
ITIL has something to offer to IT professionals from all technical and management areas. 
The concepts of utility and warranty are dear for those who are geeks by nature and 
academics at heart. ITIL derives heavily from digital electronics, so if you can read the 
circuit, you will pretty much understand the logic. Figure 2-1 diagrams the logic of the utility 
and warranty of ITIL.

Chapter 1 discussed IT service. A service provides value to the customer; nothing 
more, nothing less. The value is seen by the customer, not just as defined by the service 
provider. A service provider may embellish the features of a service by uplifting its 
capabilities and downplaying its competitors. At the end of the day, this is a marketing 
tactic. But what counts is what the customer perceives about the service that the service 
provider has to offer. The customer may not buy into all the facts and figures and, based 
on the customer’s previous experience, they might downplay a service.
For example, a lawn mowing company might claim to provide unparalleled lawn 
mowing service, where the lawn will be mowed within the agreed timeline, the length 
of the grass will be even across the yard, and the service provided will be noiseless and 
hassle free. But the customer has used this service provider once before and knows 
that some of the things claimed are to taken with a grain of salt. So, here, the customer 
sees value in this service from his standpoint but not from the way the service provider 
projects it.
2.1.1  Elements That Create Value
Value is created from a service. I have already discussed IT service in Chapter 1 and 
described its value proposition. To break it down further, let’s say that it creates value only 
if it is fit for the purpose and fit for the use. Most of the time, these terms are used and 
abused in IT organizations without anyone knowing the actual meaning of them. So let’s 
try to understand what these two terms actually mean. Figure 2-2 presents a diagram of 
this concept.
T: True
F: False
Value created
AND
T/F
Fit for use?
Fit for 
purpose?
Figure 2-2.  Value creation logic gate
Fit for purpose refers to a service’s functionality. Does the service come with all 
the features and functions that it is supposed to carry? Does the service meet all the 
functional requirements? If yes, then one of the inputs into the AND gate will be TRUE, 
and that takes us one step closer to creating value. A mobile service provider’s core 
service is to provide the ability to talk over cellular phones. If this is achieved, then we can 
consider it fit for purpose.
On the other hand, fit for use refers to the ability to make use of the service 
functionality. Through the service functionality, you are given the capability to achieve 
certain outcomes. But can you make use of the service? If you can, this input to the AND 

Chapter 2 ■ Generic Concepts
19
gate will be TRUE. If fit for purpose is also TRUE, then you create value. If any one of the 
inputs is FALSE, then value cannot be created. It’s like having a mobile network and a 
capable mobile instrument but lacking sufficient bandwidth to allow you to slot your calls 
through. It’s like having a top-notch, state-of-the-art television set but no electricity to run it.
Creating value is represented through an AND gate. Refer to Table 2-1 to help you 
understand when the value is created.

2.1.2  Utility of a Service
The utility is the functionality offered by a product or a service to meet a 
particular need.
The logic diagram in Figure 2-3 shows an OR gate for the utility part of a service.
For a service to be fit for purpose, it needs to meet any one (or both) of the  
following criteria:
	
1.	
Performance supported
	
2.	
Constraints removed
These criteria are represented through an OR gate, and Table 2-2 provides the 
conditions when the service would be fit for purpose.

Chapter 2 ■ Generic Concepts
20
For a service to create value, it needs to meet certain criteria. One such case is 
its performance. A service must inherently improve the performance of the business 
outcomes that the customer desires. For example, a mobile phone service must provide 
the customer efficiency to enable better communication.
The second criterion for which fit for purpose is applicable is the constraints that can 
be removed through the service. If the service can remove the barricades for a customer, 
it might fulfill the terms of the service being fit for the purpose. The mobile service 
provider, by providing the ability to make calls while you golf, removes the constraints 
that usually would exist if you had to stop midgame, head back to your office, and make 
the call. In this instance the constraints have been removed through the service the 
mobile phone offers.
For a service to be fit for purpose, it should boost performance or remove the 
constraints. If it can do both, even better.
2.1.3  Warranty of a Service
Warranty provides assurance that a product or a service will meet its 
agreed requirements.
Warranty comprises four parts:
	
1.	
Is the service available when needed?
	
2.	
Is there sufficient capacity available?
	
3.	
Is the service continuous?
	
4.	
Is the service secure?
All four criteria must be met for the service to be fit for use. This is represented 
through an AND diagram, as shown in Figure 2-4.

Table 2-3 provides the criteria for ensuring that the service is fit for use. It is not 
complete for all permutations and combinations. The AND gate provides a FALSE output 
whenever any of the inputs are FALSE.

In the following illustrations, I provide examples for each criterion that needs to be 
met for the service to be fit for use.
2.1.3.1  Available Enough?
You subscribe to a cell phone service and pay a premium for that service. You are now 
head out on holiday. When you reach your resort, you are flabbergasted to see that the 
mobile service provider does not have coverage inside the resort. Is the service providing 
you any value, although the provider claimed to provide many features? Definitely not!
2.1.3.2  Capacity Enough?
You are stuck in a traffic jam. You want to call your partner to inform him that you 
wouldn’t be joining him for dinner, thanks to the awful city traffic. You have service 
coverage, but the call does not go through. The service provider does not have sufficient 
capacity to handle calls from that particular cell tower. Even though there is coverage, if 
you are not able to make calls, is the service adding value? Nope.

Chapter 2 ■ Generic Concepts
22
2.1.3.3  Continuous Enough?
You are in the midst of the telephone round of an interview for a company based 
overseas. The call drops every few minutes, distracting you from the ideas you want to 
state and thereby causing you to lose your train of thought. The service has coverage and 
sufficient capacity, but is it giving you the value you perceive? Heck no!
2.1.3.4  Secure Enough?
You are calling your human resources department to discuss the appraisal your manager 
has given you. How would you feel if the conversation you are having from the confines 
of your home, with the HR person on a different continent, is accessible over the cloud by 
your manager? Is the service giving you value? You know the answer.
To sum up from these example, for the cell phone service warranty conditions to 
be met, the service must be available, have sufficient capacity, must be continuous, and 
must be secure. Without any one of these elements in place, the cell phone service is not 
fit for use and does not add value.
2.2  Assets, Resources, and Capabilities
Earlier I mentioned the functional aspects of a service that create value for customers. 
Now let’s look at the practicalities that support creating value from services. Figure 2-5 
illustrates the various resources and capabilities that typically contribute toward creating 
value from services.
Capabilities
Resources
Management
Organization
Processes
Knowledge
Financial capital
Infrastructure
Applications
Information
People (number
of employees)
People (experience, skills
and relationships)
Figure 2-5.  Resources and capabilities

Chapter 2 ■ Generic Concepts
23
You need both resources and capabilities to create value from services.
2.2.1  Resources
Resources are direct inputs that are needed upfront to create value. Resources generally 
include:
• 
Financial capital: Think of it as the seed money needed to start a 
business to deliver services.
• 
Infrastructure: Various IT and non-IT infrastructures that 
contribute toward service creation (servers, routers, offices, data 
centers, etc.).
• 
Applications: The many applications that you need to leverage to 
create a service (analyzer tools, BI, accounting, auditing tools, etc.).
• 
Information: The basic information needed to start a service, 
like what the requirements are, who is looking for what kind of 
service, etc.
• 
People: The most important component of a service. In this case, I 
am not referring to the skill sets but rather the manpower needed 
to carry out service activities.
2.2.2  Capabilities
Capabilities are a direct representation of an organization’s maturity, history, and its 
experience. It is driven mainly by components that are impalpable such as experience, 
leadership, and knowledge. The main components of capabilities are:
• 
Management: A company driven by good management skills, 
extracting profits, brand value, and customers by motivating the 
resources in the right direction.
• 
Organization: Much like management, where the organizational 
skills come in handy in using the time, energy, finances, and 
people and turning them into something of value.
• 
Processes: The building blocks of a service; they need to be at their 
optimal best, structured around ruggedness, and bound by objectives.
• 
Knowledge: Companies mature just like individuals do with 
experience. A company’s knowledge and experience in dealing 
with various situations and the capabilities that are needed to 
provide solutions make it an apt component of value creation.
• 
People (again): Under resources, we considered people by 
themselves, but under capabilities, it is the skill sets of people 
that are the focus. In this case, people’s maturity, technical and 
managerial capacity, and experience make up the capabilities.

Chapter 2 ■ Generic Concepts
24
2.2.3  Assets
Each of the items discussed under resources and capabilities are generally called assets.
If these assets (resources and capabilities) contribute toward designing and running 
a service (thus creating value), they are referred to as service assets. Examples of service 
assets are infrastructure, networks, applications, and the organizational leadership that 
provides direction and governance.
When the resources and capabilities are leveraged by a customer to achieve business 
outcomes, these resources and capabilities are referred to as customer assets. Examples 
of customer assets are people (both as a resource and capability), applications, and 
processes. Note that it is highly likely that service assets and customer assets can be the 
same, as the same set of assets are leveraged to deliver services to a customer (service 
asset) and are leveraged by a customer to achieve business objectives (customer asset).
Asset: Any resource or capability.
Service asset: Any resource or capability used by a service provider to 
deliver services to a customer.
Customer asset: Any resource or capability used by a customer to achieve 
a business outcome.
2.3  Types of Service Providers
A service provider is someone who provides service to the customer. In today’s world, the 
person offering the service could be embedded in your team or your organization or an 
outside entity.
In ITIL, and in this book, when I refer to the term service provider, I am referring 
to the nuance of an entity delivering service, and it is applicable to each of the service 
provider types that I am going to discuss.
2.3.1  Type 1: Internal Service Provider
The first type is an internal service provider. When I say internal, I am referring to the 
service provider organization that is embedded inside business units. The service 
provider is exclusive to each of the business units.
Business units are also referred to as towers (or verticals) in an organization. 
Examples include a banking business unit, a retail business unit, and a research and 
development business unit. So, in each of these business units, a service provider team 
exists. In this structure, an organization will end up having as many service provider 
teams as the number of business units.
Pros: The service provider is localized to the business unit and the customers can 
expect personalized service. This structure allows the service provider to be aware of 
the business unit’s requirements, expectations, and unstated needs. This is a distinct 
advantage in servicing the customer.

Chapter 2 ■ Generic Concepts
25
Cons: The financial side of things will not look pretty. This is an expensive 
proposition for an organization as the organization decentralizes the service provider 
organization by setting up multiple service providers (one each in a business unit).
2.3.2  Type 2: Shared Service Unit
Let’s say that an organization has multiple business units, and each business unit has an 
IT team sitting inside it. If the organization were to pull the IT teams out, centralize them, 
and reallocate responsibilities to the centralized team to cater to all of the business units, 
you would be looking at a type 2 shared service unit kind of a service provider.
Pros: Shared service units are more economical versus internal service providers. 
Centralization helps optimize the manpower, infrastructure, and the applications needed 
to deliver services.
Cons: Customers will start to miss the personalized service that is available with the 
internal service provider. This may lead to possible gaps between expectations and reality.
2.3.3  Type 3: External Service Provider
Outsourcing has been in vogue for a couple of decades, and it is the way of the present 
and the future. In this type, the service provider it outside your organization but does 
everything the same as an internal or shared service provider would.
Pros: Outsourcing works for the simple reason that businesses can concentrate 
on their core activities and let someone else take care of IT. And, it is also evident that 
delivering services through external service providers is an economical option as 
compared to hosting your own service providers. When you are a customer, outside the 
organization, you can demand what you want and how you want it. If the service provider 
is inside your organization, the process might not go as smoothly simply because of the 
office politics at play.
Cons: More often than not, your service provider might communicate in a way you 
are not used to. This might have made some people uncomfortable a few years ago, but is 
not as much of a factor today.
2.4  Types of Services
Next up on the list are the types of services that exist. Let’s dissect it from a higher altitude 
and identify the boundaries that exist.
Figure 2-6 shows three subsets of services. This is the area of focus in this section. 
The customer is still in view as well. I discussed this role enough already, so the customer 
has the basic roles of enjoying the services and paying for it.

Chapter 2 ■ Generic Concepts
26
A service can be divided into three components:
	
1.	
Core service
	
2.	
Enabling service
	
3.	
Enhancing service
2.4.1  Core Service
A core service is at the heart of the service that is delivered to the customer. It delivers 
the basic outcomes that the customer is interested in. The value representation for the 
customer starts with the core service, and it drives the money the customer is willing to 
pay for.
Example: I signed on with a cellular service provider to make and receive calls on the 
go. The most basic service that a cell phone service provider offers is the ability to make and 
receive calls. This is the core service.
2.4.2  Enabling Service
For the core service to work, you need services that can support it. These services are the 
enabling or supporting services. Enabling services are generally not customer facing, and 
the customer may or may not see them. The customer does not pay for them individually, 
but the payment that goes toward a core service gets back charged internally for the 
enabling service.

ENHANCING SERVICE

ENABLING  SERVICE

Figure 2-6.  Types of services

Chapter 2 ■ Generic Concepts
27
Example: Sticking with the cellular service example, what services do you think are 
needed to support the core service: making and receiving calls? 1. A service for installing 
and maintain cell towers. 2. A network service for routing your calls. 3. Software service 
for accounting and billing. This list could get pretty long. I hope you get the idea. All the 
aforementioned services work in the background and exist to support the core service, 
without which, the cell phone service may not function like it should.
2.4.3  Enhancing Service
Enhancing services provide the excitement factor to the customer. They add on to the 
core service, providing a number of services that most often excite the customer into 
paying more for the service. The enhancing services on their own may not function, so it 
is necessary for them to be piggybacked on the core service for their deliverance.
A core service can exist without enhancing service but the reverse is not possible. But 
the presence of enhancing services differentiates the service provider from others in the 
market.
Example: I can make and receive calls. Okay. What else? When I looked at the service 
brochure, I was more interested in what else the service provider could offer as the calling 
part was a given. I was offered 4G Internet, Internet hotspots around the city, voicemail, 
SMS, and others. These additional features helped me make my decision in choosing the 
service provider.
2.5  Contracts and Agreements
There are contracts and agreements that exist between various entities in the service 
management world. It is a formality that helps set the expectations and, in some cases, 
legally binds them to it. In a generic sense, an agreement is a formal understanding 
between two parties and a contract brings legality into the picture. A contract may be 
appended to an agreement to legalize the underlying expectation. Let’s look at the types 
of agreements and contracts that are normally used in IT service management.
2.5.1  Service-Level Agreement
A service-level agreement (SLA) is a formal understanding between the service provider 
and the customer. It defines the customer’s expectations in terms of the service levels. 
The document is usually drafted, agreed to, and signed by signatories from both sides of 
the table. Figure 2-7 illustrates the service-level agreement.

Chapter 2 ■ Generic Concepts
28
Example: When I signed on with my Internet service provider, I was given the 
following SLA:
Internet speed: 100MBps for wired connection
Resolution response: 6 business hours
Issue resolution: 16 business hours
My service provider was basically setting the expectations by stating that I would get a 
minimum of 100MBps when I connect my laptop directly to their fiber optic line. If I report 
an issue, such as loss of Internet connection or slow speeds, they were allowed a maximum 
of six business hours to respond to my request and 16 business hours to resolve the issue. 
These are published on their web site, and even in the e-mails that I received. Through the 
SLA, the service provider is setting an expectation on when the services will be back up.
2.5.2  Operational-Level Agreement
Operational-level agreement (OLA) is similar to SLA, except that it’s signed between a 
service provider and another entity within the same organization. The agreement exists 
to facilitate the provision of services to the customer, as shown in Figure 2-8.
Figure 2-7.  Service-level agreement

Chapter 2 ■ Generic Concepts
29
Example: The OLA exists to support the SLA. In the example provided for SLA, if the 
customer is expecting resolution in under 16 business hours, the service provider must have 
OLAs that are aligned to it.
One form of the OLA could be:
Service desk will spend no more than two hours to resolve the issue.
If service desk is unable to resolve the issue within two hours, then the incident gets 
escalated to the Level 2 support team.
The Level 2 support team has ten business hours to resolve the incident. If they are 
unable to do it within that time, the incident gets escalated to the Level 3 support team.
The Level 3 support team is expected to be the expert in resolution, and they are given 
six hours to resolve the incident.
The idea behind setting the OLAs in this example is to ensure that the SLA is adhered to.
2.5.3  Underpinning Contract
Underpinning contracts (UC) are signed between service providers and suppliers. The 
suppliers include those who deliver products or external services. The service or products 
sourced from the suppliers support directly or indirectly the delivery of service to the 
customers. This contract documents the targets that are to be achieved by the supplier. 
It also provides the supplier’s and service provider’s responsibilities in the context of

Service Provider Organization

receiving services and products from the supplier. The UC targets must be aligned with 
the SLA targets that are defined and agreed to with the customer. Figure 2-9 provides an 
illustration.
Service Provider
Supplier
UC
Figure 2-9.  Underpinning contracts
Example: In the same example, let’s say that a component needs to be replaced. So the 
service provider needs to have a contract with a multiple hardware supplier(s) to meet the 
SLA agreed with the customer. The SLA might state that the maximum amount of time that 
can be taken to fix the breakdown is four hours. To make this happen, the service provider 
agrees to a UC with the supplier to delivery the component within two business hours to 
ensure that the component can be replaced and services be brought back up before the four-
hour deadline.

2.7  Summary
In this chapter, I touched on various management topics that are not unique to ITIL 
alone. These included the concept of creating value through utility and warranty and the 
various components (assets, resources, and capabilities) that create an IT service.  
Further, I discussed the three types of service providers and the three types of services. 
Lastly, I described the various agreements that exist in IT service management: SLAs, 
OLAs, and UCs.
In the next chapter, you will be introduced to the ITIL service lifecycle, which 
consists of five distinct phases.

CHAPTER 3
ITIL Service Lifecycle
The ITIL service management framework we have today was not born overnight. It has 
evolved through years of trials, errors, and endurances. Service organizations learned 
the art of IT service management through trial and error. The practices that worked were 
continued forward, and these successful practices and activities laid the foundation for 
the ITIL as we know it today.
My first experience of ITIL was the second version of ITIL, two versions previous to 
the current version. When I picked it up (ITIL v2) and read through it, cover to cover, I was 
amazed at how all the aspects of service management were brought forth and shaped. So 
when ITIL v3 was introduced, a reporter who had insight into the changes described ITIL 
v3 as a paradigm shift and strategically different. And my first taste of ITIL v3 just blew my 
socks away!
While ITIL v2 introduced two silos—service delivery and service support—to carry 
out various service management activities, ITIL v3 spun a story in the service management 
world that brought about the idea of creating an IT service, progressing onward to further 
developmental and deployment stages of IT services. The IT service story in ITIL v3 is a 
good one. Its flow and logic make it rugged, flexible, and adaptable to IT service provider 
organizations.
In this chapter, I will introduce the lifecycle of IT services and how a service can be 
incepted, designed, built, tested, and transitioned into operations. The story does not end 
here; - it adopts Deming’s quality principles (discussed in chapter 8 - Continual Service 
Improvement) to provide momentum and mature over time.
3.1  ITIL Service Lifecycle
ITIL v3 (ITIL henceforth) was derived from various high-level activities that encounter an 
IT service, and each of these high-level activities were introduced as phases in the ITIL 
service lifecycle. The five phases are:
	
1.	
Service strategy
	
2.	
Service design
	
3.	
Service transition
	
4.	
Service operations
	
5.	
Continual service improvement

Chapter 3 ■ ITIL Service Lifecycle
34
These five phases are represented in Figure 3-1. It shows service strategy at the core to 
indicate the importance and involvement of a sound strategy in the inception of IT services. 
Service strategy provides guidance around existing and new IT services. Surrounding 
service strategy includes service design, service transition, and service operations. Service 
design provides the direction pertaining to realization of a service. The IT services that are 
identified in the service strategy are defined and designed and blueprints are created for 
its development. These designs are built, tested, and implemented in the service transition 
phase. After implementation, the services move into a maintenance mode. Maintenance of 
services is handled by the service operations phase. Continual service operations envelop 
the other four phases. The depiction shows that all four phases present opportunities for 
improvement, and the continuous service improvement will provide the means to identify 
and implement improvements across the service lifecycle.

Did you notice that every single phase in ITIL has “service” in it? This is not 
happenstance, but rather strongly indicates that ITIL is service-centric, and it revolves 
around services that provide value to customers.
In ITIL, there are 26 processes spanning across the lifecycle phases. As mentioned 
earlier, the phases are based on high-level objectives. The processes embedded within 
lifecycle phases provide support in realizing the phase objectives. Figure 3-2 provides the 
entire list of processes in ITIL.

3.1.1  Service Strategy
Service strategy is at the core of IT services. It is the heart of service management. The 
main intent of ITIL and IT service management is to create value for customers. The value 
creation starts at the service strategy lifecycle phase.
In this phase, the question “Why do it?” is posed before the question “How to do 
it?” The core intent of this phase is to develop a strategy and create services that add 
value to customers. In order for the service provider organization to flourish financially, 
everything must be business as usual at the end of the day.
Suppose you find a gadget online that prepares noodles using flour. And, you are in 
a country where noodles are found in every shelf in the market, including the ones made 
from exotic grains. Plus, finances don’t justify preparing your own noodles when you 
compute the gadget’s cost and the raw materials needed (not to mention the time that 
is spent). Would it add value to create noodles on your own or just buy some? There is a 
good likelihood that this gadget would flop in the market. Why? The strategy is all wrong. 
The company that manufactured it didn’t spend time finding out what creates value for 
the customer and what the customer really needs. Perhaps a gadget to shred vegetables 
would’ve been a better gadget to launch!
The most important aspect of service strategy is to understand the customer, identify 
customer’s needs, and fill those voids. If the provider can do this, even a dim-witted 
service or product would take off exponentially, until someone else finds a competing 
service or a product to counter yours.
To explain with another non-IT example, let’s say that a landowner identifies a 
location in a popular neighborhood that lacks a decent mall in the vicinity. Building one 
would be like striking gold; you have customers waiting to lap up what you have to offer 
once it is built. This move can potentially be termed as a successful strategy.
Specifically, with ITIL, service strategy’s role is to provide guidance on creating value 
through IT services. The idea is to introduce services that has the potential to succeed, 
and garner market.
3.1.2  Service Design
At the end of the service strategy lifecycle phase, smart heads (read: leadership) have 
thought over and have provided direction and guidance on which services to offer. The 
outcome of the service strategy is like the idea that an entrepreneur comes up with. 
Whether the idea would come to fruition will become known in time.
The service design lifecycle phase answers the question “How do I do it?” It takes the 
idea and comes up with solutions and designs that give wings to the ideation process set 
forth in the previous phase.
The success of a service depends primarily on the service design phase. While 
strategy plays an initial part, the solution to make it happen is equally important.
Tablet computers have existed for a long time. My earliest memory of it was the 
Palm Pilot in the 1990s, and I started using Windows-based tablet PCs in the early 2000s. 
They were commonly called PDAs (personal digital assistants). But it was not until the 
introduction of iPads in 2010 that led to an explosion in the demand for the touch portable 
computing devices. They stepped in and became synonymous with the tablet computers.

Chapter 3 ■ ITIL Service Lifecycle
37
What are the differences between an iPad and all the other personal hand-held devices 
that came prior to it? In my opinion, it is the iPad’s design that made the difference. The 
strategy was out there, since the 1980s, but the lack of a good design didn’t take the early 
versions to the pinnacle as you would expect. This is my interpretation of the tablet computer 
history and its relation to design, others may see it differently. But the key takeaway is to 
highlight the importance of design. Before I end this topic, I would honorably mention 
Android tablets, which are competing with the iPads neck to neck. There is nothing better 
than two good designs fighting for fame on a strong foundation built on wise strategy.
Remember the non-IT example that I used under the service strategy topic? After 
identifying the location, the landowner will have to hire the best architects to bring the 
most value money can buy on the land that is most sought after. The architectural designs 
that the architects come up with become the blueprint that gives insight on paper as to 
what things would look and feel like once they are realized.
3.1.3  Service Transition
The output of the service design is a set of design documents, which gives you the designs 
pertaining to all aspects of a service. The next task is to develop the service based on 
the designs. In the ITIL world, this is called the service transition, where the designs 
are transitioned into production environments through development, testing, and 
implementation.
The service transition lifecycle phase answers the question “What do I develop and 
deploy into production?” To achieve the objectives of service transition, you could either 
employ service design lifecycle activities, hardware delivery lifecycle (HDLC) activities, or 
any other framework that delves into building a system/service and deploying it into the 
intended environment. ITIL is flexible like that, it can integrate seamlessly with any of the 
frameworks you can throw at it.
Going back to the example earlier in this chapter, there are architectural drawings 
from the previous design phase. These designs are handed over to a qualified builder to 
construct the mall as per the architectural designs. The builder constructs the mall in this 
phase as per the plan and brings it to a state where it could be operationalized. This is 
exactly the role of the service transition phase.
3.1.4  Service Operations
Service operations is the most popular phase in the ITIL service lifecycle. Reasons are twofold:
	
1.	
Operations run for a long time. I am trying to avoid the word 
infinite here, as there is nothing guaranteed in this world. So, 
in effect, operations run for a long time, which translates into 
most service management practitioners working under the 
service operations lifecycle phase.
	
2.	
As the phase runs the maximum amount of time, it has 
the maximum number of touch points with the customer. 
Moreover, operations is considered to be the first point of 
interaction for a customer on a regular basis. (You will find out 
more about this in Chapter 7.)

Chapter 3 ■ ITIL Service Lifecycle
38
Service operations entails maintenance and making sure the services are running 
as per the plan—status quo is achieved. Under service operations, there is no new 
development, no deployments, and only maintenance. Some maintenance activities 
could include health checks, fixing issues when they arise, and ensuring recurring 
activities are scheduled and run as planned. This will be discussed in detail in Chapter X.
Drawing on the previous example, the mall owner takes possession of the mall, 
rents out the shops, and sets the ball in motion for it to run smoothly. For it to be 
operationalized, he needs to hire people who can manage various areas of the mall and 
employees who can carry out day-to-day tasks, like cleaning, security, marketing, etc. He 
also needs to set up daily/weekly/monthly/yearly activities to ensure required activities 
to keep the mall functioning. Examples could be monthly generator checks, security 
audits, four-hour restroom janitorial services, etc. You get the drift?
By looking at this simple example, you can easily see the activities that are needed 
in operations. The operations phase in IT service management is a lot more complicated 
and requires plenty of minds to work out various aspects of it.
3.1.5  Continual Service Improvement
The final phase in ITIL is continual service improvement. While I call it the final phase, 
it does not necessarily come into play after the service operations phase. If you look at 
Figure 3-1 closely, you will observe that this phase encircles all of the other four phases. 
There is meaning to this. This phase takes input from any of the other phases to carry out 
its process activities. You can also say that it does not fit in the lifecycle phases as it does 
not roll once the previous phase has completed its delivery. But remember that this is 
the phase that keeps the ball rolling, the service breathing. You will learn more about this 
later in this book.
I strongly believe that if something does not grow, it is as good as dead. This is true 
with our careers, bank accounts, or anything else you might think of, except of course our 
waists! This concept applies to services too; if they do not improve over time, IT services 
wither away and something else takes its place. The objective of the continual service 
improvement (CSI) phase is to identify and implement improvements across the four 
lifecycle phases; be it improvements in strategies, designs, transition, or operations, CSI is 
there to help. It is also the smallest phase of all the phases in ITIL.
In keeping with the example, in the fully functional mall, you might have thought 
that general maintenances should be sufficient for upkeep and ongoing operations. It 
may be good for a brief period but not for long. Competition heats up with other malls 
competing with it in terms of amenities, parking availability, and aesthetics, among 
others. If our mall does not improve in due time, customers are going to lose interest, 
and sales will start to dwindle. So, to keep up with the growing demands, the mall owner 
must find ways to make the mall exciting for shopkeepers as well as for customers, 
perhaps providing space underground for a public transit station, valet parking for certain 
customers, free high-speed Internet for customers, and installation of moving walkways. 
These improvements need not happen overnight, it can be a process set over days and 
months. But the important thing is to keep improving the mall on a regular basis.

3.2  ITIL Roles
ITIL is a harbinger of employment. It has introduced a number of roles, all useful and 
necessary, that are the most sought after in the IT industry today. As mentioned earlier, 
ITIL has 26 processes, and each of these processes needs to be owned, managed, and 
practiced. Automation has its place in ITIL, but machines cannot do what people can, 
even in the age of machines ruled by Skynet.
3.2.1  Roles vs. Designations
Roles and designations are different. Often, people get confused and believe that one is 
synonymous with the other, which is not the case. Designations provide you a hierarchy 
based on your organization’s structure. It places you in the pyramid based on your 
experience, salary, and maturity. ITIL roles, or any other roles, tell you which activities 
you will be performing and which areas of ITIL are under your supervision. It does not 
delve into the seniority of the people performing it. It is up to the organization to map the 
right designations with the ITIL roles. In many cases, a designation analyst will perform 
the role of a change manager in a particular organization. In another organization, a 
designation senior manager could be performing the same role.
So, to conclude, in ITIL, whenever roles are referred to, we are referring to the 
activities that a person will be performing as a part of this role and not the person’s 
designation.
3.2.2  Generic vs. Specific
Every ITIL process brings to the table at least a couple of roles. So it brings plenty of 
employment opportunities, plus, customers would be happier dealing with people with 
the right skill set and with the organization that has clarity over people owning and 
managing respective areas. So with 26 processes in the pipeline, you are looking at over 
50 different roles at a minimum.
I am not going to define each and every role in this section. Here I will provide insight 
into the generic roles that can be slotted against respective processes to define specific roles.
For example, the generic role for somebody who owns the process is a process 
owner, and the person managing the activities is the process manager. For these roles to 
be defined specifically for a particular process, say the incident management process, 
we need to define the specific role as that of an incident management process owner or 
an incident manager. At a higher level, the generic role will define what a process owner 
does, and specifically at the process scope, we define the objectives and responsibilities 
of an incident management process owner.
3.2.3  Generic Role: Service Owner
In Chapter 2, I explained what a service is. So, this service, which provides value to the 
customer, must have an owner to ensure somebody has accountability. The person who 
owns the service, end to end, and the person without whose consent no changes would 
be done is the service owner.

Chapter 3 ■ ITIL Service Lifecycle
40
In the mall example, the mall owner is accountable for the shopkeepers and the 
customers. He owns the place, so he puts his signature across all changes being made to 
it, in other words, he approves enhancements and modifications and decommissions if 
any. He is the service owner in ITIL terminology.
3.2.4  Generic Role: Process Owner
I also introduced the concept of a process Chapter 2. A process is a set of coordinated 
activities that exist to meet the defined objectives. This process, or the series of 
coordinated activities, needs an owner, someone who has a finger on the pulse to check 
if the process is fit for the purpose, and that it is subjected to continuous improvements. 
He is the process owner. He will be accountable for the process deliveries, be it in terms of 
effectiveness or efficiency.
In the mall example, there will be several processes defined and implemented. One 
such process is the process to maintain diesel generators. The maintenance process could 
go something like this: weekly general checks on Sundays at 10 P.M. Detailed monthly 
checks on the first Sunday of a month at 11 P.M. Checks are done based on a checklist. 
If minor repairs are identified, they are carried out during the maintenance window. If 
a major repair is identified, a suitable window is arranged, all necessary resources are 
mobilized and repairs are carried out by a specialist team. This diesel generator process 
cannot be orphaned. It needs somebody to own it and ensure that it is meeting its 
objectives: no outages owing to the generators.
3.2.5  Generic Role: Process Manager
We know what a process is and who the owner is. It is unlikely that an owner will actually 
manage things on his own. He will hire people who can manage the process for him. 
Process managers ensure that the processes run as per its design and achieve what 
it’s meant to. Since they are close to the works, they are in a good position to suggest 
improvements to the process owner. A decision to accept or reject the suggestions is 
made by the process owner.
A process manager is accountable for the operational management of the 
process, which defines coordinating activities between various parties; monitoring, 
developing, and publishing reports; and, as mentioned earlier, identifying improvement 
opportunities.
In the diesel generator maintenance process, the process owner hires an electrical 
engineer to manage the maintenance activities and to report on the outcomes. The 
maintenance manager is responsible for ensuring that technicians involved have the right 
skill set and are following the right set of instructions in carrying out the maintenance 
activities. If the manager finds that the weekly checks are not adding value, he can 
suggest to the process owner to shelve the weekly checks and set it for every two weeks. 
As mentioned earlier, the decision to make the checks every two weeks is made by the 
owner, not the manager.

Chapter 3 ■ ITIL Service Lifecycle
41
3.2.6  Generic Role: Process Practitioner
Anyone who plays a part in the process is a process practitioner. This may be the manager 
or the owner, or someone who may not be part of the process hierarchy. To rephrase, 
people who are responsible for carrying out one or more activities in a particular process 
are process practitioners.
In the generator maintenance process, technicians have the responsibility to check 
the generators based on a checklist. They are process practitioners. It is also likely 
that the technician is a process practitioner for multiple processes, depending on the 
number of processes he is acting on. For example, he could also be responsible for 
electrical maintenance, electrical repairs, and elevator maintenance, thus being a process 
practitioner in each of these processes.
3.3  RACI Matrix
In an organization, it is important that roles and responsibilities be clearly defined. When 
there is ambiguity over responsibilities for activities, it often leads to inefficiency within 
the system. You might have seen in your own organization that a lack of clarity over roles 
and responsibilities can end up in a mess, where both of the perceived responsible parties 
duplicate activities or both leave them to the other to act on.
RACI is an acronym for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. 
According to the ITIL service management framework, these four types of roles can be 
used to define all responsibilities and ownerships in an organization.
Responsible: The person who is responsible to carry out the 
activity gets this tag. He is the person who actually gets the job 
done. Examples could be your process manager and process 
practitioner, who are responsible for managing activities and 
performing deliveries, respectively.
Accountable: The person who owns the activity. He is the 
person who is the decision maker. Examples are the service 
and process owners. It is important to remember that 
although in the real world you could have joint ownership, in 
the world of ITIL, there is no joint ownership. An activity has a 
single owner. It can never be shared across two individuals.
Consulted: In any organization, you have subject matter 
experts who need to consulted before and during activities. 
These people play the role of a catalyst in the service 
management organization. They do not own anything, nor do 
they get their hands dirty in the actual operations. But, they 
provide their expertise in successful execution of the activity. 
Examples are corporate lawyers and technical architects.
Informed: There are the people who just like to soak in the 
information. They do not have any role in the activity, but 
would like to be informed of the progress or the lack of it. They 
are, in other words, stakeholders without the power of making 
decisions. Examples are users and senior management.

Chapter 3 ■ ITIL Service Lifecycle
42
3.3.1  Understanding RACI with an Example
Here is an example of how a RACI looks. It has activities to be performed as a part of a 
process in several rows. Those who would play a role in the process figure in the column. 
We get a matrix by putting the activities and the roles together, as shown in Figure 3-3.
In the example, for the activity, Schedule maintenance activities, this is owned 
and performed by the maintenance manager (AR represents Accountability and 
Responsibility in the respective cell). So, both the accountability and responsibility 
lie with him. For this activity, he is consulting (represented by C) with the mall owner 
on suitable dates, and informing (represented by I) the maintenance engineer on the 
maintenance schedule.
Let’s look at the final activity: fix issues with diesel generator. In this activity, the 
accountability lies with the maintenance manager, but the person performing the fixing 
is the maintenance engineer. The engineer consults with the manager regarding this 
activity, as the manager is an experienced hand in diesel generators. The mall owner is 
merely informed on this activity.
3.3.2  Ground Rules on RACI Matrix
Developing a good RACI matrix takes experience and good insight into the activities 
on hand. However, there are a few ground rules that will aid you in your RACI creation 
endeavors:
	
1.	
For every activity, you can have only one person accountable.
	
2.	
Responsible, consulted, and informed can be spread across 
multiple roles, although I have not illustrated this in the 
example.
	
3.	
A single role can don various hats, such as accountable  
and responsible for the Sponsor maintenance activities by the 
mall owner.
	
4.	
Accountable and responsible are mandatory for every  
single activity.

CHAPTER 4
Service Strategy
A strategy delineates a territory in which a company seeks to be unique.
—Michael Porter
A strategy can make or break a company’s present and future. All companies need 
direction to be governed and directed in the path that brings value to the customer and 
sustenance to the service provider. In this chapter, I will discuss the service strategy phase 
in detail and all the associated processes.
A strategy is nothing but a plan, a plan for a company to survive, grow, and 
accomplish the set objectives. Likewise, in the IT service management industry, an IT 
services organization requires a strategy to develop and offer services to its customers. 
These services must cater to the customer, as well as the well-being of the service 
provider organization.
The official definition of ITIL service strategy defines how a service provider will use 
services to achieve the business outcomes of its customers, thereby enabling the service 
provider to meet its objectives.
4.1  Purpose of Service Strategy
Why does service strategy exist? Why does any other strategy exist? If you are a student of 
finances and understand business, you know that any business exists for the purpose of 
making money and expanding the company. In an IT services organization, the business 
grows by offering services that customers want to buy. Customers buy services that help 
them, either personally or through servicing their customers. For the customer, the service 
offered must meet their requirements of value, if not, the customer goes elsewhere.
If you were to procure the services of an Internet service provider, you might realize 
that after using the services for a month it is not meeting your needs in terms of speed 
and latency. You then are bound to look for an alternate Internet service provider who 
can meet your expectations. The world of IT services is all about meeting customer’s 
requirements, ensuring that the customer derives value from the delivered services and 
thereby growing the coffers of the IT service provider organization.

Chapter 4 ■ Service Strategy
46
To understand the purpose of the service strategy better, let me introduce the 
concept of the four Ps that provide a framework for the service strategy. This concept was 
defined by Henry Mintzberg in 1994. The four Ps of service strategy are:
	
1.	
Perspective
	
2.	
Positions
	
3.	
Plans
	
4.	
Patterns
The purpose of service strategy is to define the perspective, position, plans, and 
patterns that a service provider needs to be able to execute to meet an organization’s 
business outcomes.
4.1.1  Perspective
Perspective gives the service provider organization the direction and the vision in 
developing IT services. It states what the company’s focus is going to be. It provides 
directions on how the company will be viewed and how the services will be offered.
In the airline industry, for example, Cathay Pacific is viewed as an airline where the 
service offered by its cabin and ground crew is exemplary.
4.1.2  Positions
Position provides the strategy around competing with others in the industry. It provides 
direction on how the company would differentiate itself from others and how it is going 
to position itself in taking on competition. The service provider could teeter off anything 
that glistens in the eye of the customer; it could be low cost, excellent service, or a wide 
range of services to choose from.
For example, Jetstar Airways in Australia is viewed as a low-cost air carrier that has 
an excellent safety rating. People are aware of the limited amenities on the flight, yet they 
prefer to fly on Jetstar for financial and safety reasons.
4.1.3  Plans
This one is straightforward. Plans describe the actions that need to be taken for the 
company to reach its goals from its current position. Plans look at the perspective and 
positions as the end goal and chart the strategic activities for reaching it.
All organizations typically come up with plans and goals to achieve in the next 
quarter, next year, and in five years to come. These plans and objectives are dictated by 
the company’s board members. Such plans act as a guiding star for all the upcoming 
organizational activities.

Chapter 4 ■ Service Strategy
47
4.1.4  Patterns
The plans that are set forth may not be a one-time activity. A plan needs to be repeated 
and duplicated over a period of time, such as reaching out to customers with a marketing 
campaign over a period of time with appropriate gaps.
Patterns are critical for an organization’s survival. One such example is the timing for 
when consumers buy certain products. In the United States and other Western countries, 
Christmas is the time when people shop like no other time. So, organizations plan to 
launch their products just before Christmas. Typically, you will see Apple release their 
products during the September to October period.
4.2  Objectives of Service Strategy
Service strategy as a phase has specific goals and objectives to achieve in order for the 
service provider organization to become competent and a major player in the market. 
The following are the objectives of service strategy:
	
1.	
Define the strategy for the service provider organization and 
provide direction for the company to head toward.
	
2.	
Identify which services are going to be developed as a part of 
service offerings.
	
3.	
Identify the customer base.
	
4.	
Roadmap for identifying and exploiting market opportunities 
in the IT service industry.
	
5.	
Plan to obtain funds for developing services.
	
6.	
Plan on how services will be delivered to the customer.
4.3  Value of Service Strategy
The whole premise of ITIL is creating value for the customer through IT services. Value 
blooms from the seeds sown in the service strategy phase. When I say value, it can be 
interpreted in a number of ways and is highly subjective. Value to one customer may 
not be value for another. Value is defined from the perspective of the customer. So, the 
customer’s perception of value dictates the well-being of the IT service management 
organization.
Service strategy can influence the customer’s perception of value by:
	
1.	
Being proactive to customer’s demands rather than reacting 
to increased loads.
	
2.	
Understanding customer’s explicit and implicit needs and 
delivering on both counts.
	
3.	
Making certain that there are competitive advantages for the 
customer.

Chapter 4 ■ Service Strategy
48
	
4.	
Ensuring that the customer makes a positive return on 
investment on the IT services’ costs.
	
5.	
Opening a transparent communication channel between 
the customer and the IT service provider to ensure that the 
implicit requirements don’t fall through the cracks.
4.4  Value Creation
How do you know that you have created value for the customer through IT services? 
There is no easy answer for this. Perhaps, if you were running a courier company, you 
could have confidently claimed that you delivered the tendered papers to a government 
organization, there were no delays, you charged economically, and you have quantified 
value to your customer.
What if you are running a service whose value cannot be quantified, like an 
insurance company where customers haven’t yet filed claims? How will the customer 
know that you have created value? You could say that you have given your customers 
peace of mind by covering all eventualities. But, the reality is, you don’t know if the 
customer has perceived your definition of value.
So, in effect, whether value is created for the customer is judged and perceived by 
the customer. The service provider, at best, can research his customers and come up with 
possible solutions that can make the customer happy. And in the end, he still cannot be 
sure that value was created for the customer. This is due to the fact that value is always 
measured through the eyes of the customer. However, there are two other components 
that define value apart from customer perception. They are illustrated in Figure 4-1.
Figure 4-1.  Components of value

Chapter 4 ■ Service Strategy
49
Service strategy defines value based on three components:
	
1.	
Business outcomes
	
2.	
Customers’ preferences
	
3.	
Customers’ perception
Value is defined not only strictly in terms of the customer’s business outcomes; 
it is also highly dependent on the customer’s perceptions and preferences.
The value depends on what the business is able to achieve as a result of the services that 
you provide. If the service does not meet the customer’s preferences, then it is not in tune 
with what the customer expects. Lastly, customers’ perception matters. It is the customer who 
must see the value; it cannot be measured, and it can only be understood by the customer.
Perception is a funny thing. It may depend on a number of factors such as the various 
bells and whistles that a service comes plugged with, the service provider’s track record, 
the service provider’s brand value, the customer’s self-image, and the customer’s past 
experiences with other service providers. So, from this list, you can see that the service 
provider is not at an advantage when it comes to the perception component of value, 
as things that are out of their control seem to dictate the value proposition. The best the 
service provider can hope to do is influence the perception toward positivity. Figure 4-2 
illustrates how the customer perceives value from the delivered services.

The first vertical bar from the left is the reference value for the customer. This is the 
benchmark that the customer has set, based on the current engagements or DIY (do it 
yourself) strategies. The bar next to it indicates the positive difference that the service has 
provided. An example could be HD streaming that the customer is able to enjoy, thanks 
to high-speed Internet. The world is not without problems. When the Internet goes down 
or acts erratically, it leaves a bad taste in the customer’s mouth. This leads to negative 
difference resulting from the service. These are the perceived losses from utilizing the 
service.
The difference between the positive and negative differences is the actual value, 
as perceived by the customer. The overall economic value of a service is the difference 
between the positive and negative differences, plus the reference value that the customer 
has set.
4.5  Patterns of Business Activity
IT services are aligned with business activities. Business activities in turn are aligned with 
business outcomes. In other words, IT services drive business activities and business 
activities deliver business outcomes.
Whenever business activities are performed, IT services are expected to deliver. This 
cycle generates demand for IT services, and when IT services are leveraged, customer 
assets are utilized. The customer assets are generally leveraged in a pattern.
For example, in a bank, there are month-end activities that are run on the last day 
of the month. These activities in turn bring about special focus for the people involved, 
additional activities they perform, additional load on the IT infrastructure, usage of 
applications, and a host of other activities.
To support the business activities, an IT service provider must understand the 
patterns of business activity to ensure that:
	
1.	
All people resources are fully available.
	
2.	
Infrastructure is error free.
	
3.	
Sufficient network bandwidth and storage space are provided.
	
4.	
Escalation channels are in place. 
In effect, the month-end activities present a pattern of business activity (PBA) and 
are dynamic in nature. It is also important to note that the same set of services cater 
to various PBAs. In the same example, the infrastructure support caters to month-end 
activities as well as the daily routine activities. Since the same services support multiple 
PBAs, it is critical that they are well understood and planned for.
4.5.1  PBA with Example
Let’s say that a customer hires personnel based on a number of factors, such as attrition 
due to appraisals, salary hikes, customer deliveries, new projects, etc. The service 
provider is tasked with providing all IT services to employees when they are onboarded.

Chapter 4 ■ Service Strategy
51
Figure 4-3 illustrates the hiring pattern. It has a couple of dips, once in mid-year and 
the second during Christmas. Otherwise, the pattern ascends and descends between the 
troughs. 
The service provider needs to provide IT services when employees are onboarded. 
This includes laptop provisioning, creating e-mail addresses, login ID creation, and 
access to business applications. The service provider can provide IT services if he is aware 
of the patterns of the business activity, in this case hiring. When he knows the pattern, 
he can plan ahead and order the necessary hardware, software, and plan respective IT 
activities around the pattern.
Let’s say that the service provider is unaware of the PBA. He will be forced to 
work reactively during the peak months by placing hardware orders and mobilizing IT 
resources at the twelfth hour and breaching all the SLAs pertaining to IT provisioning. 
Likewise, if the service provider can build PBA profiles for all the customers, he will be 
better placed to plan IT activities well ahead of time and to mobilize resources in time.
4.6  Risk Management
The greatest risk is really to take no risk at all. You’ve got to go out there, 
jump off the cliff, and take chances.

Chapter 4 ■ Service Strategy

Risks are inherent in every business, including the business of providing IT services. The 
world’s most popular entrepreneurs wouldn’t have reached peaking heights if they hadn’t 
taken risks at various instances. An IT service provider has to take risks in order to come 
out on top.
When a service is conceived, it comes inherent with risks. They cannot be avoided. 
The smart thing would be to identify and manage them. It is like harnessing the sun’s rays 
for power generation rather than staying indoors during the day.
A risk is a possible event that could cause harm or loss or affect the ability to  
achieve objectives.
There are two parts to risks:
	
1.	
The first is being pro-active and assessing risk. Based on 
the assessments, mitigation activities are planned and 
implemented.
	
2.	
No matter how pro-active an organization is, it may not be 
able to avoid the risk triggers (e.g., economic recessions). 
For such instances, risks need to be managed when they 
materialize.
4.6.1  Risk Assessment
Planning plays a major role in ITIL and it involves assessing risks before they materialize. 
It is an exercise that needs to be done at various stages of the service lifecycle. In most 
organizations, there are separate risk management teams that think of the worst possible 
thing that can happen to an IT service and start mapping it out with the impacts and the 
possible mitigations that can be achieved. Who said there is no place for pessimists in ITIL?
Under assessment of risks, there are two major activities:
	
1.	
Risk identification
	
2.	
Risk analysis
4.6.1.1  Risk Identification
Risks have to be identified before they happen. The best way to do this is by having 
brainstorming sessions with all stakeholders. When you brainstorm risks, just start listing 
them out. It could be as silly as the janitor tripping over power cables in the datacenter. Well, 
it’s not silly really, as there have been instances of it that have been widely case studied.
After identifying the risks, add a column for identifying the possible impact coming 
from the risk. For the janitor tripping over power cables, the impact is not primarily 
servers shutting down, but the impact that the customer faces, say web sites going offline 
or business applications losing connection to databases.
The placeholder for this information is a risk register. It is a fancy name for the 
spreadsheet or Word document where all the identified risks are recorded.

Chapter 4 ■ Service Strategy
53
4.6.1.2  Risk Analysis
After you think you have identified all the risks (which is impossible), add another 
column next to the risk to identify the probability that the risk could materialize:
• 
Datacenter losing power during janitorial activities: Low
• 
End users losing connectivity to business applications: Medium
• 
Employees taking sick leave in December: High
Also, you would expound on the potential impact that you identified in the previous 
activity—risk identification. There are two ways to analyze an impact: quantitative and 
qualitative. In one column, you could quantify the impact by providing numbers for the 
impact, such as 100 users impacted and losses amount to $10,000. In the next column, 
you can describe the impact in words, the things that cannot be quantified. Such as the 
company losing the brand image and facing legal action from customers.
The next item on the agenda to analyze is the mitigation actions. For every identified 
risk, you need to come up with a plan to mitigate it. Remember that you cannot avoid all 
risks, so you need a concrete plan to handle them when risk events are realized.
4.6.2  Risk Management
Risk management is twofold: pro-active and reactive, with the emphasis being on being 
pro-active.
Reactive risk management is straightforward. You have a risk register that lists all the 
risks against the mitigation actions. When it happens, whoever is in charge needs to take 
mitigation action and see it through the day. Nothing fancy about it, but it’s a necessity.
Pro-active risks can be managed by reviewing the risk register regularly. Basically 
in this activity, smart people in the room look at every risk and the probability of it 
happening and review if it is still the case. If the probability has changed, the risk register 
is updated. It is possible that the janitor tripping over the power line is no longer a risk 
one year after it was recorded, as janitors are no longer allowed to enter datacenters. 
Perhaps air quality issues where resolved because there is a new technology in place that 
automatically sucks all the dust through its ducts, and the air conditioning comes with 
improved air purifying filters that ensure 99.99% dust-free air.
Risk management overall is an interesting activity. Although you play the devil’s 
advocate, it helps you understand the stability of the service and keeps you better 
prepared for the worst to come. As the adage goes, expect the best and plan for the worst.
4.7  Governance
Governance is a way of organizing, amplifying, and constraining power.
—Rebecca MacKinnon

Chapter 4 ■ Service Strategy
54
IT must be tightly aligned with the business to ensure that the business gets what it needs. 
Governance helps IT service providers achieve this alignment. In fact, governance is 
perhaps the only thing that brings the customer and the service provider under the same 
umbrella and achieves synchronization.
The alignment is brought about by defining common vision, policies, processes, and 
the governance structure for regular engagements.
Governance ensures the service provider’s strategy is in sync with the customer. 
It ensures that there are sufficient touch points and control mechanisms to define the 
processes, roles, responsibilities, and measurements. They police the implemented 
processes for compliance and adherence.
The lack of governance leads to chaos. The business does not get what it wants, 
because the policies and processes would not be defined based on its needs. It would be 
a matter of time before things start to wrap up and end the business relationship. In the 
IT service management world, lack of a proper governance model has been identified as 
the major reason for failure to deliver on contractual obligations, leading to loss of the 
customer base.
4.8  Service Strategy Processes
There are five service strategy processes in the ITIL 2011 version. These processes 
are aligned to the service strategy phase’s objectives and are aimed toward providing 
guidance for the service provider to strategize, govern, and manage the outcome of the 
services. However, for the ITIL foundation examination, three processes are in scope:
• 
Service portfolio management
• 
Financial management for IT services
• 
Business relationship management
I have touched on some concepts pertaining to the two processes that are omitted 
from the ITIL Foundation syllabus in the preceding sections. These processes are:
• 
Strategy management for IT services: I explained the concept of 
value that comes out of this process.
• 
Demand management: Patterns of the business activity concept 
are tagged under this process.
All the service strategy processes will come into play across the service lifecycle, 
although it has been explicitly mentioned under the service strategy phase.
4.8.1  Service Portfolio Management
A portfolio is a collection of assets. A financial portfolio is a familiar term where in all 
the assets we own, such as shares, money in the bank, and bonds, among others, are 
collectively addressed by the term. Likewise, in the IT service management world, a 
service provider’s assets are the services that it has in its repertoire. These services are 

Chapter 4 ■ Service Strategy
55
known as the service portfolio; I will explain this further in the next section. Management 
of the service portfolio is the essence of service portfolio management.
The service portfolio is the asset that makes or breaks the service provider. It is 
the only arrow in the quiver that will differentiate one provider from the other service 
providers in the market. It is the only reason why customers would do business with a 
provider. In short, it is everything!
Portfolio management is the process where the service provider starts to take shape. 
It defines what services can make it to the assets, based on the business outcomes and 
the strategic objectives. Furthermore, the process provides guidance around measuring, 
tracking, and monitoring the services.
4.8.1.1  Service Portfolio
The service portfolio is a database that consists of all the services in various stages of its 
lifecycle. It represents where the investments are made, across various markets and all 
customers. It consists of services that are in use, that are retired, those getting developed, 
and those undergoing improvements. In all, it provides a bird’s eye view into the service 
provider’s assets—the services.
There are three parts to a service portfolio, as represented in Figure 4-4:
• 
Service pipeline
• 
Service catalog
• 
Retired services
4.8.1.1.1 
Service Pipeline
The service pipeline is a subsection of the service portfolio that consists of all services 
that are under development, including the ones that are in the conception stage. It also 
represents where the majority of new investments go in. This list is generally not visible 
to the customer, except when services are nearing the end of development stages and 
entering into testing and pilot phases. This helps service providers get assured business 
even before the service is implemented.
To state an example, a service provider who is in the business of mobile phone 
service has to launch new services every few months to stay competitive and ahead in the 
market. If it is developing new services, the provider may not want its competitors to have 
knowledge of the new service. Ideally, it would like to inform the market once the service

Chapter 4 ■ Service Strategy
56
is ready to be launched. That’s when the competitors would learn about it as well, most 
likely too late for them to react and start matching services.
For this example, the mobile phone service provider needs to create new services 
fairly regularly to stay competitive. This is perhaps true for all service providers in other 
areas of IT as well. Every company must apportion some of their budget toward creating 
new services and improving existing services. If new services fail to kick off on a regular 
basis, the service provider will soon find itself in the back of the line and playing catch up 
for the rest of its lifetime. This showcases the importance of the service pipeline and the 
criticality it brings to the table.
What are some of the triggers for creating new services or improving existing 
services? Here are some:
• 
Feedback regarding existing service
• 
Customer requests for a new service
• 
Competitors launching a new service
• 
Service provider has new strategic objectives
• 
New technological advancements
• 
Lack of outcome from existing services
4.8.1.1.2 
Service Catalog
The service catalog is the database of all services that are currently available. The service 
catalog is visible to the customer, in fact, the service provider will showcase it every time 
he sits down with the customer in order to get new business.
Service catalog is discussed at length in Chapter 5. Service catalog management is 
a process that resides in the service design phase. However, as the service catalog is an 
integral part of the service portfolio, I will discuss the topic here and connect it to the 
interfacing databases.
A service catalog is like a restaurant menu. It has all the live services listed, including 
the ones that are going to be live in the near future. For every listed service, there a brief 
description of what the service delivers, how to request it, who to contact, and, most 
importantly, the cost of availing the service.
The services listed in the service catalog are in the operational phase, in the sense 
that the service has been fully developed and is working as per the design. There could 
be improvements to the service, but they are not made public unless they are ready for 
deployment.
Imagine you head to a restaurant and glance through the menu items: appetizers, 
entrees, soups, meals, desserts, etc. All the items listed are available for delivery. They 
would not list items in there that are not delivered, right?
It is common for a service provider to maintain multiple service catalogs, depending 
on the customers and market spaces. For example, a service provider may rank the 
customers as gold, platinum, or diamond and provide varied services, with differentiating 
SLAs and cost points.

Chapter 4 ■ Service Strategy
57
4.8.1.1.3 
Retired Services
Services once conceived, developed, and operationalized will not run forever. Everything 
has a shelf life, and it’s the same case with services too. Some services move out of the 
service catalog into another database called retired services. This repository contains all 
the services that have been disengaged. This is not visible to the customer, unless they 
specifically ask for it.
There are a number of reasons why services get disbanded:
	
1.	
Technological advancements bring in new services, and new 
services replace the existing ones
	
2.	
Lack of interest from customers
	
3.	
Operationalizing services does not meet the financial 
objectives of the service provider
	
4.	
Legislative ruling could bring an end to services, like Voice 
over Internet Protocols (VoIP) in certain countries
It is also worthwhile thinking about why we need to maintain an additional database 
featuring all the retired services. Here are some reasons to do so:
	
1.	
Rule of the land might impose keeping records of all  
retired services
	
2.	
Legislative policies can change and bring some services back 
to life, like VoIP
	
3.	
New services that replaced the existing ones are not meeting 
business objectives, so there is a dire need to fall back to 
the old and tested (also a popular Hollywood theme where 
antiquated soldiers are better than the new breeds)
	
4.	
Recycling is popular with services too. New services might 
leverage certain parts of the older services to deliver 
outcomes. Why reinvent when you can rebadge?
4.8.1.2  Objectives of Service Portfolio Management
Service portfolio management exists to support the service provider in creating the 
right mix of services that make them competitive and attractive and achieve business 
outcomes. It also ensures that the investments are getting tracked, and if there are 
any services that are not generating income or not achieving business outcomes, then 
providing guidance toward retiring them.
The overall objectives of the service portfolio management are:
	
1.	
Before a service gets developed, there is a lot of analyses and 
investigations that are done to ensure that the right services 
that generate regular income and provide business outcomes 
are incepted. This is the primary objective.
	
2.	
Manage the portfolio of services that are offered to customers.

Chapter 4 ■ Service Strategy
58
	
3.	
Track investments across the lifecycle of a service to ensure 
that the majority of the funds are going toward services 
that are bearing maximum fruits and achieving business 
outcomes.
	
4.	
Control what services are being offered, at what service levels, 
and at what level of investment.
	
5.	
Keep a finger on the pulse whether the services are on 
the path of strategic objectives of the organization and 
appropriately responding to events (like technological 
breakthroughs, market orientation, and customer 
preferences) appropriately.
	
6.	
Retire services that are no longer viable for the organization to 
continue maintaining.
4.8.1.3  Scope of Service Portfolio Management
All the services that are developed by the service provider, the services that are offered to 
customers, and the services for which customers pay for come under the scope of service 
portfolio management.
More specifically:
	
1.	
Services that are in the development stage
	
2.	
Services that are in the operational phase, offered to 
customers
	
3.	
Services that are no longer in use, retired
4.8.2  Financial Management for IT Services
Financial management for IT services is needed to do business. It is the process that 
enables the service provider to understand what is being spent, how much is being 
allocated, and what is being charged to the customers. This process has the highest 
visibility across the echelons of the organization. It is controlled by the top tier in the 
organization but it flows down to every nook and corner of the organization. Every single 
team in IT will have a budget to play with, need to account for expenses, and advise on 
charging the customer.
For example, if the service provider is providing technical support to a customer’s 
base, the service provider would have accounted for the number of PCs, servers, and 
other IT equipment that needs to be managed. A contract would be signed between the 
two parties listing the number of systems to be managed, at what costs, and at what levels, 
and how quickly the service provider can respond, resolve, and support the service.
Suppose the customer procures additional laptops and a couple more servers during 
the period of a contract; the service provider will have to charge the customer accordingly 
based on the updated numbers. Suppose computer administrators were asked to work 

Chapter 4 ■ Service Strategy
59
through the night due to month-end activities; the service provider must charge the 
customer accordingly. This mechanism of keeping track of what services were offered, 
and at what levels, and quantifying them accordingly is one of the key objectives of 
financial management of IT services.
Going deeper, I would like to rethink the definition of quantifying the returns to the 
customer. In fact, the goal of this process is not only to quantify the money part but also 
to quantify the value that the customer generated due to the service. If the customer can 
get the visibility due to value quantification, he will be keen on appreciating the service 
that is helping his organization rather than believing that IT is a necessary burden that he 
needs to learn to live with.
4.8.2.1  Objectives of Financial Management for IT Services
Financial management is a complex process as IT services are measured and charged in 
small fragments, including pay as you use. For the scope of ITIL foundation, I will discuss 
the high-level objectives of the process. They are:
	
1.	
Evaluate financial impact due to new strategies being 
conceived of or changing for the existing strategies. For 
example, when IBM went from being a product company to a 
service organization.
	
2.	
Secure funding for developing new services and operating 
new services.
	
3.	
Budget the expenses for the organization based on the 
projected incomes.
	
4.	
Account for the money spent on various services, on various 
customer-related activities, and other administrative costs.
	
5.	
Comply with regulatory and legislative requirements by 
carrying out appropriate financial activities.
	
6.	
Charge the customers as per contracts and recover costs if any.
4.8.2.2  Scope of Financial Management for IT Services
The entire service provider’s organization comes under the scope of financial 
management. Generally, this process is handled separately by a team of finance experts, 
accountants, and legal experts with the process rolling up to the chief financial officer 
(CFO). For managing IT services, however, you need people who understand the service 
landscape, people who can speak the language of services and communicate better.

Chapter 4 ■ Service Strategy
60
At a high level, financial management for IT services can be broken down into:
• 
Budgeting: This is a process that involves forecasting expenses 
for a finite term. It involves understanding all the intricacies of 
the organization and understanding expenses coming from all 
quarters of the organization. Budgeting does not stop at creating 
budgets for the service provider but also controls the flow of 
money to these avenues.
• 
Accounting: Once the budgets are set, expenses start to come in, 
usually from a number of channels, most expected and some 
unexpected. The accounting part of the process ensures that 
every penny spent by the organization is accounted for and is 
placed under a silo where it rightly belongs. At the end of the 
day, the beauty of accounting is to report the costs based on 
various factors, such as customers, services, departments, and 
administration.
• 
Charging: The service provider is required to recover the costs 
by charging the customer on a regular basis. The terms and 
conditions for recovery are most often mandated by the contracts. 
In addition, there could be cases where additional charging needs 
to be made. The source of charging, therefore, comes from sound 
accounting practices.
4.8.2.3  Business Case
A business case is a documented justification for supporting decision making. Business 
cases are used when a business objective needs to be achieved, for which certain actions 
need to be taken. They may or may not involve costs.
This document brings out the potential benefits or consequences if the 
recommendation is to be ratified. Also they look at the benefits and consequences from 
both qualitative and quantitative perspectives.
A business case will generally contain the following sections:
• 
Business objective to be achieved/problems to solve
• 
Analysis and assumptions
• 
Quantitative business impact
• 
Qualitative business impact
• 
Risks and mitigations involved
• 
Recommendations
Business cases are different for every service provider, as every service provider is 
different and their business objectives and the corresponding business impacts differ 
as well. Also, the perspective or the lens through which they view problems can also be 
different. The commonality between the service providers hinges on the business impacts 

Chapter 4 ■ Service Strategy
61
that the recommended action is likely to cause and the associated risks. An internal 
service provider may weigh the case in tight alignment with the business unit, whereas 
an external service provider may have eyes on the brand image and the financial impacts 
along with meeting the business obligations.
4.8.3  Business Relationship Management
Business relationship management (BRM) is a fairly new process to ITIL; although it existed 
in principle, it did not have a process on its own until the 2011 version. This process acts 
as a bridge between the customer and the service provider to ensure that the customer’s 
requirements are well understood and the services are delivering business outcomes.
There is another process under the service design phase called the service-level 
management (SLM), which has existed for as long as I can remember. SLM links the 
customer on the service levels of the services and ensures that the services are delivered 
as per the signed contract. I will discuss the SLM process in detail in Chapter 5.
The process objectives for the BRM and the SLM are similar from a distance, but 
they differ in terms of what kind of touch points take place between the processes and 
the customers. BRM looks at the strategic and tactical levels, while SLM concentrates 
on the operational level. In essence, BRM acts as a big brother to SLM to ensure there is 
alignment between the processes and the list of items agreed to at strategic and tactical 
levels are materializing in the operations. The relationship between BRM and SLM in 
explained in detail in Chapter 5.
4.8.3.1  Objectives of Business Relationship Management
Do you remember the cartoon that depicts what the customer conceived as a deliverable 
and what the project actually delivered? Well, let’s just say that the customer wanted a 
monster truck and he got a tractor instead. This kind of mismatch can be avoided if there is a 
communication line open at the highest levels of echelon of the organizations, to understand 
the customer’s deepest needs and to meet those needs, rather than delivering just what is 
asked for. There are a number of case studies that suggest that business partnerships break 
not because of communication, but rather the lack of it. BRM plugs this gap.
These are the objectives of BRM:
	
1.	
Understands customer’s perspective of IT services delivering 
business outcomes, leading to prioritizing services and 
service assets.
	
2.	
Ensure customer satisfaction levels are at a high, which is a 
good indicator whether or not the service provider is fulfilling 
the customer’s needs.
	
3.	
Understand the customer’s business, customer’s pain points, 
and business drivers to facilitate services, providing value as 
the customer sees it.
	
4.	
Engage new and upgraded technology to serve the customer 
better with fitter service levels and quality of service.

Chapter 4 ■ Service Strategy
62
	
5.	
Understand customer’s requirements for developing new 
services or changing existing services.
	
6.	
Manage conflicts where necessary.
	
7.	
Provide a path for the customer to initiate and lodge complaints 
if services are not up to the expected levels. This ensures that the 
customer reaches out to the identified chain of command rather 
than going after the customer’s favorites (usually the CEO).
4.8.3.2  Scope of Business Relationship Management
BRM is generally known as account management in most of the top service organizations. 
Each customer or a set of customers is assigned an account manager, depending on the 
size of the customer. The account managers are tasked with meeting customers on a 
regular basis, taking them out for dinner and drinks with the sole purpose of feeling the 
pulse of the customer and ensuring corrective actions if all is not well.
In the case of an internal service provider, it is unlikely that an account manager role 
is set up. One of the senior managers in the IT organization is tasked with putting on the 
hat of a business relationship manager and understanding the needs and pains of the 
customer’s business.
The following come under the scope of BRM:
	
1.	
The business outcomes that the customer wants to achieve 
through service providers
	
2.	
All the services that are offered to the customer, pitched to the 
customer, how, when, where, and other details of the service
	
3.	
Technological advancements that could potentially impact 
the existing services
	
4.	
Customer satisfaction levels
	
5.

4.10  Summary
In this chapter, I explained the four Ps of service strategy and the value creation principle. 
I also discussed the patterns of business activity, risk management, and governance. 
I discussed the first set of processes in the ITIL framework, the processes that are 
embedded in the service strategy phase. I covered the following processes: service 
portfolio management, financial management, and business relationship management.
In the next chapter, you will learn about the second phase of ITIL service  
lifecycle—service design—the concepts of designing a service and the processes that 
belong to this phase.

CHAPTER 5
Service Design
Good design is making something intelligible and memorable. Great 
design is making something memorable and meaningful.
—Dieter Rams
Service design begins when the senior management in the organization has given the 
direction in setting up IT services. The vision for the service strategy is blueprinted in the 
service design phase.
Let’s resume with the example of the mall that I previously discussed in this book. 
In the strategy phase, visionaries who understand business investing and demography 
decide that a mall built on a certain piece of land would be a great investment and help 
the community immensely. The decision to build the mall is made in the service strategy 
phase, and it is handed over to the service design phase to come up with the plans.
Service design is like a building architect who sits down and starts drawing plans 
using a software like AutoCAD. The architect designs how many floors the mall would 
have, how to allocate parking without sacrificing commercial spaces, determines what 
the layout will look like, and plans for the escalators, elevators, staircases, emergency 
exits, patios, and all other aspects of the mall. The design’s objective is to ensure that 
minimal changes would be necessary in the future, so whatever needs to be thought of, or 
provisioned for, needs to be done now. You cannot expect to design something with plans 
to include major changes a few years down the line, which would defeat the purpose of a 
good design.
The output of the mall design is a set of architectural diagrams, 3D blow-ups, civil 
designs, and other associated plans. Everything is built first on paper. Not a single brick 
in laid in the design phase. Similarly, in the service design lifecycle phase, the technical, 
governance, and management designs are blueprinted based on the strategic direction, 
and this package is the overall outcome of the phase.
5.1  Purpose of Service Design
The mall example illustrates all the plans that will be designed in the design phase. 
Coming back to ITIL, the business runs around IT services. The service design phase is 
tasked with designing the IT services and its associated activities.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
66
Some examples of IT services include:
• 
Internet
• 
Cellular phone (calling, texting, data, etc.)
• 
E-mail
• 
Web hosting
• 
Text messaging
These are basic examples of IT services, but there are a number of other complex IT 
services that could be added to the list.
The purpose of the service design phase is to develop designs for the IT services 
that were envisioned in the service strategy phase, along with the policy and process 
documents that are necessary to control and govern the designed IT services. The designs 
must fit into the environment the customer is looking to deal with, ensuring maximum 
customer satisfaction and minimum costs while meeting all the quality requirements.
5.2  Objectives of Service Design
From the mall example, the underlying principle for the designs is to ensure that minimal 
improvements are foreseen in the future. So too, IT designers must ensure that they 
foresee the future of the IT services in play and design them with an eye to the future. 
If the designs are robust and can stand the test of time, then you can expect minimum 
improvements to be made over the course of time.
Let’s say that the designers are tasked with designing a dynamic web site. The 
designers must be judicious in choosing the content management system (CMS) that is 
going to help them in the long run. They must opt for a popular CMS such as Wordpress 
rather than Drupal, which has a diminishing support base. The reason to choose 
Wordpress is to ensure that further updates that come about from the CMS developers 
will ensure that the web site will stay current, secure, and relevant. If Drupal is chosen, 
there is a possibility that development might stagger in a couple of years, or even come 
to a standstill, which will force the designers to transition to a different CMS and lead to 
major design changes, risks, and unwanted expenses.
The objective of service design is to ensure that IT services require minimal 
improvements during the course of its lifecycle. I am not implying that improvements 
are bad, but improvements must be grounded on changing requirements or triggered by 
unforeseeable events, rather than enhancing the drawbacks in the service. You don’t want 
to have to build a restroom in the mall after it goes live, because the architect overlooked 
providing one.
Also, the services designed must be scalable, customizable, and resilient to internal 
and external conditions. The policies, processes, standards, guidelines, metrics, Key 
Performance Indicators (KPI), and SLAs are defined during this phase.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design

5.3  Value of Service Design
ITIL is based on the premise of creating value to the business, and the service design, 
the biggest phase, has a major role to play in it. It is the phase where the design of value 
proposition gets under way and is blueprinted. Service strategy provides the basic framework 
to create value, and the service design fits the pieces of the puzzle into its creation.
This phase is key to the service provider organization, and it determines the set of 
activities that start to give the service portfolio a shape, its bone structure, the elements 
needed to align business processes to the technical components. Further, service design 
caters to the ever growing demand in building a design that stands the test of time, 
technology, load, and plan for the future. The strategic relationship building that starts 
in the earlier phase needs the backbone from the operational feedback, and this phase 
caters to it. Service design acts as a conduit for translating the financial aspects of a 
service into a plan that fits the budget and is cost effective for the customer to sustain 
using the services.
The business can derive the following value components from the service design phase:
	
1.	
The business depends on reducing its overall expenditures, 
therefore maximizing its profits. Service design helps in 
reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO) and supporting 
the business in its business goals.
	
2.	
Businesses are like rivers, they need to keep flowing, merge 
with tributaries, and maximize their outflow. For this to 
happen, the services they leverage off of must be consistent 
and available. A solid quality design can help achieve it.
	
3.	
Change is the only constant, be it business services or 
IT services. Service design’s place is to ensure that the 
implementation of new or changed services is seamless.
	
4.	
Businesses and IT cannot run on parallel tracks. Both swim in 
the same waters, often by joining hands and collaborating. IT 
must know which business processes are critical and ensure 
that it aligns its priority, urgency, and resources in delivering 
them to the critical parts of the business. Service design must 
enable the business.
	
5.	
The value of IT services comes from its effectiveness. If the 
IT does not deliver on its services, businesses cannot deliver 
on their outputs. It’s a critical success factor, and the service 
design phase has a major role to play in it.
	
6.	
Business leaders are expected to make critical decisions that 
are bound to have short-term and long-term effects. Service 
design provides the base data, information, and knowledge to 
act as a catalyst for making such judicious decisions.
	
7.	
The business needs to comply with regulatory and legislative 
policies of the land. The service design must support the business 
in inheriting these compliances from the IT services front.

5.4  Four Ps of Service Design
An effective design needs to consider the entire landscape—past, present, and  
future—identify stakeholders, and plan for contingencies, among others. At a high level, 
there are four areas that need to be comprehended to develop an effective design, as 
shown in Figure 5-1:
	
1.	
Processes
	
2.	
Products

People

Figure 5-1.  Four Ps of service design
5.4.1  Processes
Processes are an integral part of any IT service. During the design of IT services, processes 
are hard at work to bring form and structure. Once IT service is designed, processes 
are necessary for deployments and for keeping track of configurations, and processes 
form the basis for governing changes. Once implemented, processes drive operations, 
maintaining status quo. To sum up, processes are the foundational elements of the ITIL 
framework, and these processes need to work together and interface with one another 
to provide robust and stable IT services to customers. Think of it like the edutainment 
cartoon Captain Planet and the Planeteers, where five individual elements when brought 
together created the superhero called Captain Planet. In IT service management, the 
superhero is none other than IT services, and for it to be effective, efficient, cost effective, 
and consistent among all other jewels, you need the individual processes to interlock, 
interface, combine, and work toward the common objective.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
69
Service design is the phase where all the processes, including the ones in other 
phases, are designed, along with its interfaces, KPIs, RACI, and other components.
5.4.2  Product
Products comprise a twofold system. The first branch is the service design, which is the 
output of the service design phase. Products also extend beyond design to technological 
components that are leveraged to implement, support, measure, and improve services 
across the entire lifecycle of an IT service.
For example, for an ATM service to maintain service over a period of time, it must 
have an IT security product to keep hackers at bay, a business program to communicate 
with banks, and a monitoring tool to provide status updates.
5.4.3  People
Leveraging on technology is good and automation is fantastic. But who drives, controls, 
and operates technology? Who makes decisions on operational, tactical, and strategic 
situations that arise on a fairly regular basis? People.
The service design phase identifies the necessary skill sets that people need to 
possess to design, implement, and support IT services. They also identify the training 
requirements to upskill people and influence the culture in the organization.
If a new service is being introduced, how many people will be needed to design, 
implement, and support it? The loading of resources is yet another responsibility that 
comes under the ambit of service design.
5.4.4  Partners
The days of a single organization delivering all services are over. Services are so complex 
and diverse that a single organization cannot manage everything. It needs partners and 
suppliers to work alongside and deliver on the service objectives. I will discuss in detail 
the role of partners and suppliers under the supplier management process later in this 
chapter. But for now, a key ingredient in making an effective service is partners, and they 
must be considered while drawing roadmaps and blueprints in the service design phase 
of the ITIL service lifecycle.
5.5  Five Aspects of Service Design
There are five aspects that service design must consider apart from the four Ps to ensure 
that a holistic view of services is taken rather than the individual elements of the service. 
The five aspects, as shown in Figure 5-2, are:
	
1.	
Service solutions for new or changed services
	
2.	
Management information systems and tools
	
3.	
Technology and management architectures

5.5.1  Service Solutions for New or Changed Services
The service solution for new or modified services is at the heart of IT services. The 
solution obtains the requirements from the service portfolio management process, and 
it is developed under the technical and financial constraints. For example, technological 
specifications such as SAP-based solutions and financial constraints are based on the 
financial agreements made with the customer. An economical IT service will not have a 
high availability design. The solution must also comply with the service-level agreements.
5.5.2  Management Information Systems and Tools
Tools are an integral part of IT service solutions. They are required in automation, 
reporting, and monitoring and are identified based on the existing tool sets, service 
requirements, and their functionality.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
71
5.5.3  Technology and Management Architecture
No organization will start as a green field. They will have some services and would like to 
start adding additional IT services. In such cases, the new architecture and technologies 
must interface with the existing architecture and technological components. This is 
applicable for the management structure in organizations as well.
5.5.4  Processes
IT services, new or modified, require processes for transition and maintenance. Every 
process comes with its own objectives, and they must be aligned to meet customer 
requirements and interface with existing processes.
5.5.5  Measurement Methods and Metrics
Measurement forms the basis for feeling the pulse of IT services and identifying service 
improvements. It is critical to know what needs to be measured in order to find loopholes 
and performance initiatives. Service design is at the best juncture to define measurement 
methods and the metrics needed for the rest of the service lifecycle.
5.6  Service Design Package
The main output of the service design phase is the service design package (SDP). This 
is yet another term you need to remember, and remember well, for the sake of the 
examination.
The SDP is a set of plans, blueprints, and architecture for the IT service. It also 
contains all the necessary documents required for service transition and operations.
The service design phase produces a service design package for the following:
	
1.	
When a new service is getting introduced
	
2.	
When a major change is being done to a service, like an 
overhaul of the entire IT infrastructure
	
3.	
When a service is getting decommissioned
The typical contents of a service design package are:
• 
Business goals
• 
Service contracts
• 
Service applicability
• 
Functional requirements
• 
Operational requirements
• 
Design and topology

5.7  Service Design Processes
Service design is the biggest phase in the ITIL lifecycle. It encompasses eight processes, 
and each process looks at the service from a different facet. Together, they provide all the 
design parameters of an IT service.
The eight processes under service design are:
	
1.	
Service-level management
	
2.	
Service catalog management
	
3.	
Information security management
	
4.	
Availability management
	
5.	
Capacity management
	
6.	
Supplier management
	
7.	
IT service continuity management
	
8.	
Design coordination

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
73
5.7.1  Service-Level Management
Service-level management is a key process in which the customer and the service 
provider agree to specific service levels. The process ensures that the service levels are 
met and due course of action ensues if there is failure to do so.
I discussed key concepts on contracts and agreements involving service-level 
agreements, operational-level agreements, and underpinning contracts in Chapter 
2. In this section, I will delve deeper to understand the nuances of the service-level 
management process.
5.7.1.1  Objectives of Service-Level Management
Service-level management exists to constantly sync with the customer at a tactical and 
an operational level. It’s a means to formal agreements, understanding and meeting 
expectations, and to keeping a finger on the IT service pulse.
The following are the prime objectives of service-level management:
	
1.	
Understand service-level expectations, document, agree to, 
and track service levels on a regular basis
	
2.	
If the service levels are not up to par, take corrective actions
	
3.	
Ensure that the customer and IT are on the same page in 
understanding and delivering on customer expectations
	
4.	
Work with the IT teams to improve the quality of services
	
5.	
Work with the business relationship management to improve 
the relationship with the customer
	
6.	
Warrant service levels that are specific and measurable for 
every IT service delivered to the customer
	
7.	
Ensure customer satisfaction through the delivery quality  
of service
	
8.	
Define and document operational-level agreement (OLA) with 
the IT teams, derived from the service-level agreement (SLA)
	
9.	
Report and manage all service-level breaches to closure
	
10.	
Ensure service risks are identified and mitigated pro-actively
5.7.1.2  Service-Level Requirements
Before I move further, there is yet another term you need to understand, which has 
not been discussed so far in this book. Service-level requirements (SLRs) are the set of 
expectations that the customer puts on the table with respect to IT services (or aspects 
of it). SLRs are aligned to business objectives and form the basis for negotiating and 
agreeing to service levels between the customer and the service provider.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
74
To state a few examples of SLRs, the customer might ask for critical incidents to be 
resolved within the hour, might ask for changes to the systems be implemented within a 
day, and might ask for 100% availability of Internet service. Not all SLRs are feasible, even 
by the top service providers. In fact, the cost of services tends to go up exponentially as 
the service-level requirements hit the high percentage. So, the art of negotiation is to find 
the balance between the service levels and the cost of providing services.
Then there are some SLRs which are impossible to match, even by the best of service 
providers, perhaps implementing system changes within a day. Not all changes may be 
feasible given the timeline, as changes need to be developed, tested, and then deployed. 
It takes a lot of planning, coordinating, risk measures, and countermeasures. If the service 
provider signs off on an SLR stating that all changes would be implemented within a day, 
he would be setting himself up for a grand failure.
Ideally SLRs are captured in the service strategy phase by the service portfolio and 
business relationship management processes. But, this is at a high level. Specifics are 
not discussed until the agreements are charted. When the contracts are set in stone, the 
ball passes to the service-level management to obtain specific requirements from the 
customer, who then translates them into workable SLAs.
When SLRs have been determined, the next activity is to come up with service-
level targets (SLT). SLTs are hard to come up with in the first instance. Generally, initial 
SLTs are defined, and over a period of time, they are refined and finalized. SLTs are a 
commitment made by the service provider against an aspect of a service. Examples of 
SLTs might be:
• 
More than 95% of the incidents will be resolved within 8 hours
• 
Configuration management database (CMDB) will be greater 
than 99.5% accurate
When SLTs are agreed to, they go into the SLA document. SLAs are finalized, signed 
off on, and then make their way into an addendum to the business contract. I will explain 
this process in detail in the next section.
5.7.1.3  SLA Frameworks
SLAs can be drafted in a number of ways. The two most popular types in vogue are 
service-based and customer-based SLAs. Figure 5-4 illustrates the service- and  
customer-based SLAs.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
75
In a service-based SLA, the service that is being offered has a common set of SLAs for 
all customers. There are no tweaks and customizations for these SLAs. These services are 
common for all customers, as all service components would be shared across customers. 
So, it would be impossible for a service provider to provide different service levels to 
specific customers.
For example, the service that I have picked up as shown in Figure 5-4 for Internet 
has 99.9% availability and maximum ping time of 22ms for all customers. Customers 
cannot negotiate for anything more nor need to settle for subpar service levels. Not that 
customers would ask for reduced service levels, I am just trying to get the concept across. 
You may have also encountered such service levels when you tried to buy webhosting 
services. The service provider quotes a service level, and there is no discussion around 
it. You take it or leave it. If you want better service levels, you opt for a better service like 
Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting.
In customer-based SLAs, every service that the service provider offers is up for 
negotiation in terms of service levels. The customer can negotiate the service levels, 
and the service provider will be in a position to fulfill them. This is possible because the 
service components such as the infrastructure and applications are built for a specific 
customer and can be changed as per SLRs. Of course, there will be specific costs, and it 
normally goes up exponentially for every decimal increase in the service levels.
In the illustration in Figure 5-4, the customer Carl Steaks is picking up a bunch of 
services, at the service levels that he requires. Rest assured, there will be costs for service 
levels that are above the threshold.
When it comes to SLA frameworks, there are provisions to be as flexible as a service 
provider can be, and as rigid as the webhost service provider offering shared boxes for 
customers to host their web sites. Remember that everything comes at a cost; and better 
the service levels, the more the customer has to shell out.

5.7.1.4  Multilevel SLA Framework
There is a third kind of SLA framework that makes it multilevel, offering more flexibility 
and stability for the service provider. The top of the SLA line, and the SLA framework that 
dictates to every customer and to each service, is the corporate-level SLA, as illustrated in 
Figure 5-5.

Figure 5-5.  Multilevel service-level agreement
The corporate-level SLAs are decided at the corporate level, meaning the service 
provider’s top most decision layer has decided that the SLAs for specific parts of the 
service or supporting activities’ are set in stone and cannot be changed.
For example, the service desk’s timing for reaching out to the customer is common 
across all platforms. It cannot be altered at a customer’s request or for a critical service 
requiring extended coverage.
There could be various reasons why corporate SLAs are framed. It could include 
legislation or laws, cost balances, or other strategic reasons that will benefit the service 
provider. By taking a stand that certain SLAs will not change, the service provider may 
well prove that he is not going to be partial toward any of his customers, no matter how 
much money is involved. This could be a marketing gimmick or a principled stand. What 
matters for you in this book is understanding the concept of multitiered SLAs and the 
level of trumping between the SLA frameworks.
In Figure 5-5, you can see that corporate-level SLA is top tiered. So the levels set 
at this magnitude cannot be overridden by customers or services. The next tier is the 
customer-level SLA. So SLAs agreed to with customers for specific services stand, even if 
a specific service has different service levels across the board.
The last in the pecking order is the service-level SLAs. Whatever is left over from 
corporate- and customer-based SLAs belongs to the service-based SLAs.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
77
5.7.1.5  Service Reporting
Reporting is a major activity in all business areas, and it is not just restricted to IT. 
Reporting gives clarity with numbers. What the reports do is quantify the delivered 
service levels and set up the agenda for upcoming discussions for meeting stakeholders.
In the ITIL world, IT services come tagged with various SLAs to measure the service 
levels against a number of aspects of services. Reports are pulled with the actual service 
levels and compared with the agreed to SLAs.
SLA documents define the reports that need to published and also the frequencies. 
Some reports may be pulled more regularly than others, for example, a weekly change 
report versus a CMDB accuracy report that is pulled every three months. For some critical 
services, a daily report comes in handy as well. The service provider must agree with the 
customer on the reports that will be produced, how often they will be generated, their 
format, and their distribution lists.
There are exception reports, where the report does not get generated if the service 
levels are met, but instead, get generated if the SLA is missed or in some cases stays 
on the borderline. Examples could include a breach in SLA resolution time for critical 
incidents or a breach in SLA for implementation of normal changes.
Service providers must work toward automating all of their reports to ensure 
consistency and cut back on resource costs. There are a number of advanced reporting 
tools in the market that can automate many reports and create dashboards to monitor the 
delivery of services in real time.
Merely procuring a tool will not do the job. Service providers need reporting 
specialists to create reports for all their service obligations and provide other internal 
reports that can help the organization to reduce the total cost of ownership, increase 
productivity, and help it be more efficient. The art of reporting is a delicate skill and it 
is rare to find professionals who can produce reports that hit the right chords, meaning 
using filters to get what information is needed and to make the reports visually appealing. 
It is not a role that can be ignored.
5.7.1.5.1 
SLAM Chart
SLAM is an acronym for service-level agreement monitoring. It is a color-coded report on 
the service level not using numbers but the RAG (red, amber, green) status, as shown in 
Figure 5-6.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
78
If the service levels are faring well, such as Sales, across all the reported months, the 
cell corresponding to the month and service is shaded green. If the service levels have 
breached for certain periods, as in Accounts in January, it is shaded red. And if the service 
levels are in borderline, such as HR and Factory in March, the cell gets shaded amber.
It’s a visual tool that helps senior managers and higher management to feel the pulse 
of the services on the fly. In cases of amber cells, the report might suggest that the service 
provider come up with actions aiming to get the status back to green. If it is red, the SLAM 
report goes deeper to find the cause and to come up with corrective and preventive 
actions, which I will discuss during the problem management process in Chapter 7.
5.7.1.6  Service Reviews
Service reports are the basis for conducting service reviews. Service reviews are generally 
meetings between the service provider and the customer, and they are planned meetings 
that happen at a regular frequency: monthly or quarterly. Additionally, there could be 
half-yearly or annual service review meetings between the senior management of both 
the organizations.
Service review meetings follow service reports. So, there needs to be alignment 
between the two activities. For example, if the service reports are mandated to be 
published on the fourth business day of every month for the previous month, the service 
review meeting can be planned to be conducted every seventh business day, giving time 
for both parties to plan their respective meeting strategies.
In service review meetings, the service-level manager or a designate is generally the 
chairperson, and a minute taker must be assigned well beforehand. All discussions must 
be documented and actions must be tagged with a timeline, along with an associated 
owner. This could be either from the service provider or customer. Minutes are supplied 
to both parties, including the senior management, for visibility and guidance.

Usually, service breaches are discussed in detail in service review meetings. The 
service provider must come prepared not only with an answer to what caused the breach, 
but also to find a permanent solution to prevent it in the future.
In some cases, the service provider might find it unfeasible to meet certain SLAs. In 
such cases, service review meetings are the forum to discuss whether the SLAs need to be 
tweaked to make them realistic.
I personally look forward to being in service review meetings. No matter how much 
we prepare, the other party always throws a curve ball at you, and it is also interesting 
from the service provider standpoint to hear customer’s observations on service 
deliverance, something you might have rated trivial might end up being a big deal for the 
customer.
5.7.1.7  Service Improvement Plan
More often than not, the outcomes of service review meetings are seeds to improve 
the quality of services. The initiation to improve services might come as a result of 
suggestions or recommendations and as one of the components on the contract 
document.
It is extremely critical for services to improve, and not stagnate by barely keeping 
their head above water. When I say improve a service, what aspect of the service am I 
referring to? Remember the resources and capabilities I discussed in Chapter 1 that make 
up the service? There were ten service assets within the resources and capabilities, and 
improving any or multiple assets leads to service improvement.
Let’s say that you are looking at the people aspect of a service. Getting mature 
resources to work on services, those who can resolve incidents quickly, improves the 
quality of service. Getting a technology upgrade to bypass certain service constraints and 
deliver better on business outcomes is another example of service improvement.
To state a real-life experience, when I started out, I was working for a customer 
whose users used to call the help desk to get passwords reset. At the time, automated 
password resets were not as common as they are today. When we implemented a self-
help password reset enhancement, the customer greatly benefited by the increase in 
productivity of his employees. The service provider, who was my employer at the time, 
benefited by reducing the headcount at the help desk. It was a win-win situation. Who 
said service improvements benefit the customers alone?
A service improvement plan (SIP) is a document that contains all the identified 
aspects of a service that could potentially undergo improvements. The instigation for the 
SIP items comes from the service review meetings. Service-level management initiates 
the SIP and it gets carried out in the continual service improvement lifecycle phase (see 
Chapter 8).
It is also not uncommon for contracts to list the projected service improvements. The 
underpinning contract could state that the cost of services should reduce by 10% year on 
year. While inflation hits the world, how in the world can the cost of services decrease? 
Mainly from service improvements. Such clauses mandate service providers to work 
diligently toward improving services, not just maintain the existing services. Of course, 
service improvements need a budget of their own.
Let’s say that a user requests a laptop. As per the process, the team that fulfills the 
request reaches out to the user’s manager, obtains approval, and then places an order 

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
80
with the procurement team to create a purchase order. This coordination between 
various parties requires a good amount of effort. Instead, I automate the process; I don’t 
skip any steps, but I remove the coordination efforts using the power of automation. I 
would design the tool to seek the manager’s approval when the request is raised. After the 
manager’s approval, I route the ticket directly to the procurement team. In this example, 
I have taken out the middleman. This translates to more efficient and cost-effective 
service.)
5.7.1.8  SLM vs. BRM
The SLM works with ears to the ground and is tasked with dealing with all issues 
pertaining to service quality. The BRM, on the other hand, works closely with the 
business and is aligned to the customer’s current and future requirements. BRM also acts 
as a conduit for the customer to share their feedback.
The BRM and the SLM processes are similar in principle, but they differ in the 
outcomes they are trying to achieve. The BRM works at a strategic level (as discussed in 
Chapter 4). It works with customers to understand the pains, requirements, and desires 
to formulate and tailor IT services to their needs. On the other hand, the SLM process 
works with the customer during and after the IT service delivery stage. It works with the 
customer in ensuring that the service levels are met and making sure pain points and 
other runway-level issues are handled.
The BRM process works at the strategic level and at times at the tactical level. The 
SLM process works at the operational level and at times at the tactical level. Although 
at a tactical level, both BRM and SLM are involved, there is no overlap between their 
responsibilities as laid out in the process.
The BRM is required to act as the big brother as strategy feeds into tactics and operations. 
The SLM must work within the ambit of the services and can take support from the BRM to 
align with the strategy. Likewise, BRM needs to interface with the SLM quite stably as the 
operations on the ground are the basis for all discussions with existing customers.
5.7.1.9  SLM Interfaces
As the SLM process deals with measuring and reporting service levels, in principle it must 
interface with every ITIL process. This is in fact true for all processes. None of them can 
work in isolation. They require at least one or multiple process to provide triggers, inputs, 
and feedback on output. In the case of SLM, the following sections discuss some of the 
critical interfaces.
5.7.1.9.1 
Business Relationship Management
As discussed earlier, there are differences in interfacing between the SLM and the BRM.
5.7.1.9.2 
Service Catalog Management
The SLM interfaces with the service catalog management for obtaining service 
information and associated service levels from the service catalog.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
81
5.7.1.9.3 
Incident Management
The incident management process interfaces with the SLM process by ensuring that the 
service levels pertaining to incident management, such as response and resolution times, 
are adhered to and provide the means to measure it. Also, the incident management 
process provides the data and recommendations for negotiation of service levels.
5.7.1.9.4 
Supplier Management
The SLM works with the suppliers to implement agree to SLAs and ensure that the SLAs 
with the suppliers are aligned with the customer SLAs. The supplier management process is 
responsible for providing service-level measurements achieved by all suppliers to the SLM.
5.7.1.9.5 
Availability, Capacity, IT Service Continuity, and 
Information Security Management
Similar to the incident management process, these processes provide respective service 
levels achieved through them and provide recommendations during service-level 
negotiations.
5.7.1.9.6 
Financial Management of IT Services
The financial management for IT services process interfaces with the SLM process in 
identifying the cost of building and providing services to customers.
5.7.2  Service Catalog Management
I don’t want to hear the specials. If they’re so special, put ’em on the menu.
 —Jerry Seinfeld
The exercise of marketing IT services starts with cataloging them and making them 
known to potential customers. This is the essence of service catalog management. It is the 
process that ties together the various services of the service provider to provide a unified 
view in an effort to provide quality services to the customer.
5.7.2.1  Service Catalog
I discussed the service catalog in Chapter 4. The service catalog is one of the three parts 
of the service portfolio, and the most crucial one in terms of design, operations, and 
continual improvements.
A service catalog is a list of all your operational services, which are available for 
customers to leverage. The purpose of the process is to ensure that all the live services are 
listed and are accurate at any given time.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
82
Think of a service catalog as a restaurant menu. A menu lists all the appetizers, 
entrees, main courses, drinks, and desserts the restaurant serves, along with the price for 
every item on the menu. The customer looks at the menu, decides what he wants, and 
places an order. Typically, you would not find dishes that are not served listed on the 
menu. If any of the dishes were served at a previous time but are no longer available, they 
would be duly taken out of the menu.
In a similar vein, a service catalog lists all the operational services that the service 
provider offers, along with other aspects such as the details of the service, who the point 
of contact is, and the cost and specifications. As with the restaurant menu, the services 
that are no longer offered (retired services) are taken off of the list.
Apart from the live services, the service catalog may also contain services being 
prepared to be deployed in the near future. However, whether or not to-be-live services 
make it into the service catalog is at the discretion of the service provider. In a practical 
sense, it is a good marketing trick to ensure that your customers start seeing yet-to-be-
launched services, with the aim of getting buyers before the service has launched.
To state an example, think of your mobile service provider. They all have their 
services listed on their services menu. And the new services, such as 4G Internet, which 
was introduced sometime in 2014, would have made it to the list of services even before it 
was launched.
Figure 5-7 is a view of a service catalog tying in with the customer’s business 
processes and in the backend with the supporting services. When the customer looks 
at the service catalog, he will see services A, B, C, and D on the menu along with their 
depictions but not the supporting services (a, b, c, d, and e) that enable the customer-
facing services.

5.7.2.2  Service Catalog Structure
A service catalog can be drafted in a number of ways, depending on the maturity of a 
service provider. The structure of a service catalog can be as detailed to drill down to 
the individual service components or can be simple with basics hooks and bolts. The 
deeper a service catalog structure drills into, the better control an organization is going to 
leverage and there are endless possibilities of improvements resulting from it.
I will discuss two views of a service catalog structure in this book.
Figure 5-8 depicts a two-view service catalog, one for the customer and one for the 
support teams providing technical support. While the customer sees the menu that I 
discussed in this section with all the services he can buy and enjoy, the backend of this 
service catalog is visible only to the support teams. The backend may or may not look 
anything like what the customer sees. More often than not, it is completely different. 
While the customer sees a service he can use, the support team sees services in a way that 
makes more sense for the geeks in us.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
84
To state an example, a customer purchasing mobile phone service will see the 
following options on the service catalog:
	
1.	
National calling
	
2.	
International calling
	
3.	
4G Internet
	
4.	
Voicemail
	
5.	
Messaging
As a customer, you connect with these services, and you are pretty sure that you 
need one or more of the services listed. This is illustrated by services A, B, C, D, and E in 
Figure 5-8.
The technical teams from the service provider organization have a list of services 
that they support. The services they support are not the list of what the customer sees 
(services A, B, C, D, and E). Instead, technically grouped services replace the service 
catalog, along with the mapping between customer-facing services and technical 
services.
For the mobile phone service provider example, the technical services could be:
	
1.	
Antenna
	
2.	
Server
	
3.	
Networks
	
4.	
Messaging software
	
5.	
Storage
	
6.	
Applications
These technical services are depicted by services 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in Figure 5-8. The 
technical services are interlinked/mapped to the customer services. In this example, the 
mapping looks something like this:
	
1.	
National calling: Antenna, Server, Networks
	
2.	
International calling: Antenna, Server, Networks
	
3.	
4G Internet: Server, Networks, Applications
	
4.	
Voicemail: Server, Storage, Networks, Applications
	
5.	
Messaging service: Blackberry Software, Server, Storage, 
Networks
The reason for mapping business services to technical services is to enable 
support teams to troubleshoot and support the services in a better fashion. Suppose 
the Blackberry service stops working; the support teams are aware that the Blackberry 
software, server, storage, and networks make it up. So, they can start troubleshooting 
the technical services to identify the smoking gun. Suppose the Blackberry software is 
getting an upgrade; the technical teams are aware that the supporting services need to 

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
85
be considered before going ahead with the upgrade. The examples and the level of detail 
I am providing is just the very tip of the iceberg. The iceberg goes very deep, and the 
journey is exciting.
To arouse your interest in the drilling down and mapping services, the technical 
services are further mapped into individual technical components, and it drills down 
to the basic infrastructure that makes up the service, such as servers, switches, load 
balancers, etc.
There is another view of a service catalog that does not go deep downstream but 
rather segregates on the types of customers. An example is shown in Figure 5-9.

Figure 5-9.  Three-view service catalog
You might be aware of the terms B2B and B2C: business to business and business to 
customer. A B2B or a wholesale customer, as in the example, is one in which the customer 
is not an individual but rather an organization. For example, if a customer organization 
procures services from an Internet service provider, this customer will see the wholesale 
service catalog, which will be at a higher scale, lists prices for hundreds and thousands of 
users, and is managed with a dedicated business relationship and service-level managers.
On the other hand, the B2C transaction, such as an individual purchasing cable 
TV, mobile service, and Internet service, is viewed as a retail customer, and that person 
is shown the retail service catalog, the catalog that is generally put on web sites and in 
flyers, and is more often than not made public. All the terms of the service are listed 
next to the service, and you buy it directly from the service provider. You may or may not 

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
86
have a relationship manager. Mostly, you may never talk to a soul in the service provider 
organization, unless you have issues. In some cases, issues are sorted out by bots today.
5.7.2.3  Objectives of Service Catalog Management
From the service catalog management, these are the expected objectives:
	
1.	
Manage the service catalog end to end, including technical 
and customer service catalogs
	
2.	
Keep the catalog accurate at any given point in time, including 
the operational services and, if necessary, the soon-to-be-
operationalized services as well
	
3.	
Ensure the right parties with access are able to view the 
catalog, for example, a business customer must be able to 
view the wholesale catalog while an individual must be able to 
view the retail catalog
	
4.	
Support other processes by providing the information it requires
	
5.	
Support in defining services and service definitions
	
6.	
Maintain dependencies with the service portfolio and other 
service catalogs in the organization
	
7.	
Maintain dependencies with the service components 
(configuration items; this will be discussed in Chapter 6)
5.7.3  Information Security Management
Passwords are like underwear: you don’t let people see it, you should 
change it very often, and you shouldn’t share it with strangers. 
—Chris Pirillo
The only truly secure system is one that is powered off, cast in a block of 
concrete and sealed in a lead-lined room with armed guards.
 —Gene Spafford
Information security management is a process that deals with the security of data, 
especially the customer data. Remember from Chapter 1 when I discussed value derived 
from services using logical gates, one of the aspects that provided warranty of a service 
was information security. If warranty fails, then the utility part of a service ceases to make 
sense, hence failing the entire service objective. In effect, this is one of the most important 
processes within the ITIL service lifecycle.
This is a governance process that ensures that risks rising from information security 
perspective are identified and dealt with appropriately. It manages all aspects of IT 
security, be it application data, sensitive business information, or the data center security.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
87
5.7.3.1  Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
There are three information security-related terms that secures the security aspects of 
information. They are confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Confidentiality is the protection of information from unauthorized access. In other 
words, only those with access to information are able to access it. Service providers and 
customers store information on servers, share points, and other file servers, and these 
data could contain sensitive business strategies, tactics, credit card information, or 
personal information of the end users. This information needs to be secured through 
methods known best to information security professionals, such as encryption and 
safeguarding.
Integrity is the protection of information from getting modified by those who are not 
authorized to do so. It tightly integrates with confidentiality and goes a step further in 
protecting the interests of all the involved parties. Information is valuable if it is accurate, 
and when it is modified by unauthorized users (read: hackers), the sabotaged data will 
pull companies down faster than a speeding bullet. There are several ways integrity is 
protected these days, cryptography being one of them.
The last of the tenets of information security is availability. It ensures that the 
authorized parties have access to information when they need it. If you provide the right 
level of encryption through confidentiality, ensure integrity through cryptography, but fail 
to provide accessability to those authorized, the whole exercise of securing information 
is counterproductive, right? The value from service comes from parties having the 
availability to access information when they desire to access it. Hackers have found a way 
to breach information security by blocking access to information through distributed 
denial of service (DDoS) attacks. A number of popular web sites such as Facebook go 
down due to such attacks fairly regularly. In this sense, denial of access to information is a 
breach in achieving information security objectives.
5.7.3.2  Information Security Policy
Every nation has to follow a certain policy: Commercial, trade, various 
other types of policies.
 —APJ Abdul Kalam
A policy is the guided path with lights at the periphery to ensure that you don’t stray from 
the principles set forth. A policy draws boundaries and drafts rules for play. In the ITIL 
service lifecycle, an information security policy provides the rules and boundaries that 
are necessary for ensuring that the information security management objectives are met, 
meaning CIA components are adhered to.
All policies must be driven by senior management, and only in this case does it 
become effective and get the value treatment that it deserves. The senior management 
must completely endorse the policy guidelines and ensure sufficient communication 
goes out to the rest of the organization to show their faith and commitment to it. When 
there is backing from senior management on policies, the rest of the organization falls in 
line and starts to comply with the policy controls.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
88
Policies do not cover the service provider alone, but also encompass customers. 
You do not want customers to carry out illegal activities using your services, do you? 
Information security policies are always made a part of SLRs, SLAs, OLAs, and UCs.
According to the ITIL service design publication, these are some of the various 
policies that make up information security policy. This list is not comprehensive:
• 
An overall information security policy
• 
Use and misuse of IT assets policy
• 
An access control policy
• 
A password control policy
• 
An e-mail policy
• 
An Internet policy
• 
An antivirus policy
• 
An information classification policy
• 
A document classification policy
• 
A remote access policy
• 
A policy with regard to supplier access to IT service, information, 
and components
• 
A copyright infringement policy for electronic material
• 
An asset disposal policy
• 
A records retention policy
A detailed study of the listed policies is not within the scope of the ITIL  
Foundation exam.
5.7.3.3  Objectives of Information Security Management
To state it plainly, information security management exists to keep customer information, 
data, assets, and all aspects of customer resources safe. If we take a step back, the 
customer will have certain policies and guidelines in place for business security. The 
purpose of information security management is to align with the business security and 
ensure that CIA is intact.
Further, the objectives of information security management are as follows:
	
1.	
Confidentiality: Information can be accessed only by those 
who are authorized.
	
2.	
Integrity: Information is accurate, complete, and is in 
verbatim condition.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
89
	
3.	
Availability: Information is available when required to those 
who are authorized.
	
4.	
Authenticity: Transactions between various parties (enterprise 
to enterprise or enterprise to vendor and other relationships) 
are trustworthy.
5.7.3.4  Scope of Information Security Management
As mentioned earlier, the information security management must be based on the 
business security policies and other customer security requirements. This is the best way 
of protecting the customer’s interests. In lieu of this, the following areas come under the 
scope of the information security management:
	
1.	
Understand customer’s security requirements, both present 
and future, and align information security policy accordingly
	
2.	
Define, maintain, communicate, and enforce information 
security policy
	
3.	
Implement IT security controls in line with the information 
security policy
	
4.	
Assess security risks pro-actively and manage security risks in 
case of eventuality
	
5.	
Reduce risks (using a process such as problem management)
	
6.	
Manage and assess supplier’s security controls to ensure 
alignment with the information security policy
	
7.	
Manage (pro-actively fight) security-related incidents and 
problems within the delivered services
5.7.4  Supplier Management
Supplier management is a key process in the delivery of IT services to customers. The 
process helps to bring the customer and his deliverables on board and in line with the 
customer’s requirements, and they are aligned to the SLAs as agreed to with the customer.
The service provider is tasked with providing end-to-end IT services to the customer. 
However, it is unlikely that he has all the required resources to deliver services. He needs 
other parties/companies/organization to deliver bits and pieces of the service, so that the 
service provider can join the dots and deliver it as an IT service.
For example, an IT company wins a bid to provide e-mail services to an organization. 
At a high level, to provide e-mail services, the company requires servers, storage, 
software, people, and networks. Typically IT service providers have the necessary 
maturity, skill sets, people, and processes. They are dependant on suppliers for procuring 
hardware infrastructure such as servers and storage, network infrastructure such as 
switches and routers, and software for handling and managing e-mails (such as Exchange 
or Lotus Notes). No service provider would ever think of manufacturing hardware, 
software, and having their own network. So, pairing with suppliers is essential.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
90
Traditionally organizations have called this process vendor management, as it 
is mainly involved in procuring products. But now there are a lot of services that are 
obtained through suppliers such as phone connectivity, leased lines, software as a service 
(SaaS), and IT professionals.
5.7.4.1  Types of Suppliers
Not all suppliers fall into the same category, and each is as important as another. Every 
supplier plays his part in the delivery of IT services, and it is key for the service provider 
to identify the types of suppliers and prioritize their importance in a workable fashion. In 
other words, some suppliers may have a seat at the table during management meetings 
and some don’t. Who makes it or misses out depends on the supplier’s type.
It works the other way as well. A service provider may spend more time with key 
suppliers over others. ITIL recommends that the supplier management process spend 
more time with key suppliers as their deliveries have the most impact to the delivery of IT 
services, and any misalignment will lead to breaches and penalties.
The value and importance of suppliers is best explained through Figure 5-10. The x 
axis indicates risk and impact and the y axis shows the value and importance of suppliers. 
In this simple matrix, there are four types of suppliers based on the risk, impact, value, 
and importance:
	
1.	
Strategic suppliers
	
2.	
Tactical suppliers
	
3.	
Operational suppliers

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
91
5.7.4.1.1 
Strategic Suppliers
Suppliers that support service providers transform and support strategically the business 
of delivering IT services located at the top of the competition and are called strategic 
suppliers. These suppliers are normally referred to as partners, which indicates a 
partnership of sorts to ensure that the supplier respects and meets the commitments 
coming from his end. Considering their importance to service deliverance, it is important 
to prepare some suppliers as partners and make them more than accountable for their 
side of the bargain.
You might have seen companies boasting of having technology partners, media 
partners, and other appropriate partners. Welcome to the new world, where achievement 
comes through collaboration, and there is a dire need for partners, rather than merely 
suppliers! The trend started a few years ago and will continue to flourish over the next 
several years.
I worked for Atos, a French IT service provider, sometime back. The organization 
has been the IT partner for the Olympics since 1989, and they are not referred to as an IT 
service provider by the IOC (the company that manages Olympics) because the Olympics 
events today hinge on the success of IT, unlike in past events. So, it is extremely critical 
for the IOC that Atos succeeds in its promised delivery to make the Olympics events a 
success. Hence the term partner is fitting, although there is no joint sponsorship of the 
Olympics events.
In the case of strategic suppliers, the supplier management activities are taken 
care of by a senior person and is directly overseen by the senior management. Yet, the 
activities partaken come under the ambit of the supplier management process. Yes, there 
might be caveats and different sets of controls for strategic suppliers, but that does not 
take them outside the ambit of the process.
The management involves regular conversations, meetings, follow ups, performance 
reviews, steering committee meetings, and other bicommunicational exercises. During 
the interactions, it is imperative that the service strategy and design resources be a 
mandatory presence more often than not.
5.7.4.1.2 
Tactical Suppliers
Tactical suppliers are important but not as important as the strategic ones. They are not 
referred to as partners, but rather just suppliers. They provide support in the service 
provider’s tactical activities.
This can best be explained with an example. A service provider buys a bid to support 
a customer on the floor. The customer is a well-established supermarket based across the 
major cities in a country. So, in other words, the customer is spread out and the service 
provider needs to have an IT personnel presence in every city and in every neighborhood 
in which the supermarket operates. The service provider takes a tactical decision in 
aligning with a supplier who is in the business of providing IT support to home users 
across the country. By leveraging the reach of the supplier, the service provider is able to 
broaden his scope into servicing every supermarket in the chain. The supplier therefore 
is an important one, as he supports tactical deliverance of services to one or more of the 
service provider’s customers.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
92
Unlike strategic suppliers, the management of tactical suppliers is handled by 
the middle layer of the service provider management organization. The supplier 
management process supports performance reviews, regular meetings, and 
implementation of performance improvement measures.
5.7.4.1.3 
Operational Suppliers
The third tier of suppliers is important operationally but not otherwise. These 
suppliers do the basic things that run certain smaller sections of the IT service provider 
organization.
An example could be provision of telephone lines for the service provider 
organization to make local and international calls. There could be multiple operational 
service providers providing the same type of services, one acting as the backup to the 
other or working in parallel.
Operational suppliers are managed directly by the service provider’s operational 
teams. The suppliers’ management process helps in coordinating and tracking their 
performance.
5.7.4.1.4 
Commodity Suppliers
Commodity suppliers, as the name suggests, provide commodities that more often than 
not do not impact the delivery of IT services to the customer. The products they deliver 
can be sourced through a different commodity supplier, which entails the dependence on 
individual commodity suppliers.
An example of a commodity supplier would be a company that delivers products 
such as coffee beans for the vending machine, ink cartridges for the printers, and other 
items to this effect.
5.7.4.2  Objectives of Supplier Management
I have discussed enough suppliers and how they are required to be aligned to the 
customer’s requirements rather than their own interests, which is one of the main 
objectives of a supplier. Think about it, if the customer’s requirement for a resolution 
is five business hours and the service provider agrees and signs it off on the SLA, the 
supplier who is delivering a part of the service must adhere to the same set of SLAs. 
He cannot agree to a different timeline (more is not okay, less is good). All the supplier 
contracts and supplier-related information are stored in a database called the supplier 
and contract management information system (SCMIS).
Here are the top goals or objectives of the supplier management process:
	
1.	
Suppliers form a part of the business, so it is imperative that 
the primary objective of the process is to ensure that the 
service provider obtains value for the money
	
2.	
Ensure through service-level management that the SLAs with 
suppliers are aligned with the customer’s SLAs

5.	
Track and manage supplier performance and conduct 
supplier performance review meetings to ensure corrective 
and preventive actions are undertaken by the supplier
	
6.	
Manage SCMIS with supplier policies, processes, procedures, 
and other related documents
5.7.4.3  Scope of Supplier Management
The scope of the supplier management process starts with suppliers, ends with suppliers, 
and encompasses everything in between. This includes management of suppliers and 
their contracts. It includes continuing a relationship by championing through dedicated 
supplier managers. These relationships help in resolving conflicts and help the supplier 
understand the customer and the customer’s requirements better.
The process has a significant role to play in today’s consideration of suppliers’ 
dependence on delivering IT services. ITIL recommends that a separate process be 
tailored for every supplier based on their importance and the role they play in value 
generation. When each supplier is carefully managed through processes and work 
activities, the sums of their individual activities generate synergy through value creation 
and achieving business outcomes. If a supplier is adding more value, then the service 
provider must spend more time with him, and vice versa.
From the scope perspective, supplier management process includes the following:
	
1.	
Categorization of suppliers based on risk and impact versus 
value and importance
	
2.	
Contract and SLA negotiations and agreement
	
3.	
Management of SCMIS
	
4.	
Draft, implement, and enforce supplier policy
	
5.	
Supplier assessment and evaluation
	
6.	
Contract initiation, renewal, review, and termination
	
7.	
Track and manage performance reviews
	
8.	
Identify improvement opportunities and work with supplier to 
deliver the identified opportunities
	
9.	
Resolve conflicts and disputes

5.7.5  Availability Management
Being available is more important than being desirable. 
—Constance Chuks Friday
If you are invited for a dinner at a friend’s place, only your presence will give your friend 
the satisfaction of having enjoyed your company. You cannot be absent and still expect 
the hosts to have the same satisfaction. Availability is the key for whatever we are able 
to enjoy today. Even customers who enjoy IT services can only enjoy them if they are 
available. Take it away from them, and then the anger bombards the call centers night 
in and night out. No matter how wonderfully you served your customer up to that point 
in time, everything would be forgotten and you would be viewed as the lousiest service 
provider in the world. My point being, availability of a service is key for an IT service 
provider to exist in the business of providing services.
Availability is defined in ITIL as the ability of an IT service or other configuration 
item to perform its agreed function when required. It is represented as a percentage. 
Normally, you would see availability as one of the main marketing techniques used 
by webhosting service providers. They promise availability that is very close to 100% 
(99.9999% is what my webhost promises). Whether they achieve it or not is generally 
unknown. As a retained consumer, they do not share reports with me, and as I don’t 
employ any monitoring tools to monitor my web sites, I don’t have a faintest clue when 
my web site goes down. But, it may not work the same way for business customers, 
where the business goes into hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. Businesses 
get regular availability reports and reports on demand as well. They can dispute claimed 
availabilities as they have mechanisms to track that from their end.
5.7.5.1  Service and Component Availability
Availability comes at a cost. When customers negotiate the availability of a service, it 
all comes down to cost. Let’s just say that a customer is billed US$1 million for 99% 
availability. If the customer requests an availability of 99.9%, the bill may jump to US$2.5 
million, add another decimal integer, the figure might shoot up multiple times, say US$5 
million for 99.99% availability. This concept is best explained in Figure 5-11. This image 
is from Mysql, and it represents how the costs shot up for every single decimal point. 
Referring to the figure, service providers and businesses offer 99.9% availability, which 
comes at a reasonable cost, which translates to eight hours of acceptable outage in a 
month. SaaS and webhosts provide 99.99% availability, which translates to around 50 
minutes of outage in a month, which is not very much at all. If you want better than this, 
such as for government and defense organizations where availability is of the essence 
for doing what the CIA and the Pentagon does around the clock, they are able to accept 
grudgingly an outage of five minutes, which is an incredible availability of 99.999%.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
95
Why does the cost shoot up exponentially as availability increases by every decimal? 
To state it plainly, the cost of availability is expensive. The complexity of the infrastructure 
and supporting applications dictates the costing. The service design takes into account 
the agreed SLA levels for availability and designs the availability of services accordingly. If 
the customer wants to have 99.999% availability, the service provider needs to ensure that 
there is sufficient resilience to take into account all possible disruptions. For example, the 
service must have at least a couple of resilience layers. If the primary fails, the secondary 
takes over. If both the primary and secondary fail, then there is a tertiary layer that is 
ready to take over. The customer would keep using the services, as though nothing 
happened, all through the failures of the primary and secondary. In fact, as a backup to 
the tertiary, high availability designs ensure there is a disaster recovery site, with real-
time replication, and it will automatically take over. I will discuss disaster recovery under 
the IT service continuity process later in this chapter.
It is a common sight these days for servers to be set up in a clustered environment, 
network devices to have multiple failovers, and applications and data to have multiple 
copies of replication, lying in different parts of the globe, to cater to disasters for every 
kind. To architect such high-availability designs requires additional resources, storage 
requirements, people, and other add-ons. This is the reason for the inflated costs for 
every decimal point in availability.
5.7.5.1.1 
Service Availability
Service availability is the availability of a service measured end to end. When I say end 
to end, I mean all aspects of a service need to be available for it to be counted toward 
availability. If any of the aspects are unavailable, even the tiniest bit, it adds up toward 
unavailability of the service.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
96
For example, let’s say you buy a webhost service, which is the core service, and it 
comes with e-mails as an enhancing service. If the e-mail service goes down and the web 
site stays up, it is still considered unavailable service.
5.7.5.1.2 
Component Availability
Interconnected components make up a service. Each component’s availability can be 
measured as well to ensure that the services offered are stable. Examples of components 
are servers, routers, load balancers, switches, and others.
Component unavailability may not lead to service unavailability if the high-
availability design is employed with resilience. If resilience is not factored in, due to 
various reasons starting from costs and requirements, component availability could very 
much lead to service availability.
Let me further explain this with an example. Let’s assume in a high-availability 
design, a critical core switch is backed by an autofailover facility. If the switch fails, 
the traffic is automatically routed to a backup switch. The service is not affected, as 
the switchover takes place before users can notice it. This high-availability design is 
expensive. So, not all services and not all organizations opt for high-availability design. 
In a normal design, if the core switch fails, the concerned team is made aware, and they 
manually replace the core switch with a good one. The notification and replacement 
takes a certain amount of time, leading to service downtime. So, in the first instance, 
although the component (core switch) failed, the service was unaffected. The component 
availability was affected but the service availability was unaffected. In the normal design, 
the component took down the service with it. So, component availability affected the 
service availability.
5.7.5.2  Aspects of Service Availability
There are a few terms and formulas that you need to learn as a part of this process. When 
was the last time you dealt with mathematical formulas, was it in college?
You are required to remember these formulas and definitions from a Foundation 
examination perspective.
5.7.5.2.1 
Availability
Availability is defined in ITIL as the ability of a service, component, or CI to perform its 
agreed function when required.
%Availability

Agreed Service Time

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
97
Agreed service times are based on the SLA. If the contract says that the agreed 
service time is Monday-Friday 9 A.M.-7 P.M., and in a particular month, if there are 22 
days, then:
Agreed Service Time
hrs x

In this particular time, if there is a downtime on the first and second Monday 
between 10 A.M. and 2 P.M., then the monthly downtime is eight hours. Plugging the 
figures back into the availability formula:

96 36
If there is a downtime outside the agreed service time, it is not considered in the 
availability reports. However, it could still be recorded and reported, but penalties, if any, 
will not apply to downtime outside the agreed service time.
5.7.5.2.2 
Reliability
It cannot get any simpler than this. This term refers to the reliability of a service. It 
measures how long a service or a component can function without disruptions. When I 
learned ITIL in version 2, this term was referred to as mean time between failures (MTBF). 
Many old timers like me still call it MTBF, and understand MTBF better than the simple 
word reliability!
Reliability
Agreed Service Time

In the example that I considered above, plugging the numbers for reliability  
gives me:

5.7.5.2.3 
Maintainability
Maintainability is the measure of recouping from a service or a component failure. 
In other words, how quickly the service or component is brought back up after it had 
failed. This term is also referred to as mean time to restore service (MTRS). In some 
organizations, the warranty period is also considered downtime, which is not accurate 
within the principles of ITIL.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design

Anyway, here’s the formula for maintainability:

Plugging the numbers:

That concludes the math lessons in ITIL. You can relax.
5.7.5.2.4 
Serviceability
When you measure availability, reliability, and maintainability of a supplier, all three 
put together under a single term, ITIL calls it serviceability. It is an important term 
considering that the three underlying aspects of a supplier may very well impact 
the overall availability of a service. Hence the customer, in his right, can demand 
measurements and reports from all associated suppliers to provide their serviceability 
numbers on a preagreed schedule.
5.7.5.2.5 
Vital Business Functions
Some parts of the business are more critical than others. These critical business activities 
are referred to as vital business functions (VBFs) in ITIL. When availability is designed, it 
is important for the business to identify VBFs to ensure that they get the highest priority in 
terms of high and continuous availability.
A bank has several functions. An ATM that disburses cash is important, but its effect 
is limited to a particular geography and to a limited number of users. On the other hand, 
a central processing unit that processes transfers from and to all banking accounts affects 
a whole lot more users compared to an ATM. If it were to go down, a major mass of all 
banking customers would be impacted. So, comparing the two banking functions, we can 
draw conclusions that the transfer system is more critical and can be considered a VBF. 
Another point to note is that the identification of VBFs is done by the business and not by 
the IT service provider.
When availability is designed, VBFs are given priority. They are fitted with multiple 
layers of resilience, and the design costs are far more expensive compared to an ATM 
availability design.
VBFs can be provided with extra care and protected from failures using special 
designs such as:
• 
High availability: High-availability design is a well-known 
concept in the IT industry, where multiple layers of resilience 
are built for individual components. Any component failure is 
compensated with other similar components with no human 
intervention. The end user will continue to work, as though 
nothing had ever happened.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
99
• 
Fault tolerance: IT services or individual components continue to 
work the way they should even after anomalies or failures. Their 
design is embedded with their ability to function and to meet 
their objectives, even when they fail.
• 
Continuous operation: Some businesses can never stop, such 
as mining and health. They need to operate continuously. 
There are no options for planned downtime. One of the special 
designs allows IT services to continue functioning 24/7, even 
though certain individual components are brought down for 
maintenance or replacement.
• 
Continuous availability: Similar to continuous operation, the 
objective of this design is to achieve 100% availability. There are 
no planned or unplanned downtime options.
5.7.5.3  Objectives of Availability Management
Availability management exists to set the right availability expectations with the customer 
and to ensure that the service provider is meeting its end of the bargain. We have looked 
at various aspects of availability management, so you must have a fairly good idea of what 
its objectives are. Here’s the list:
• 
Develop a high-availability plan to reflect the right set of 
availability parameters for all services, including future ones
• 
Maintain availability plans across the service lifecycle, 
remembering that the availability plan needs to be relooked at 
whenever major service designs are made
• 
Achieve service availability targets by pro-actively managing 
service assets
• 
Provide advice to other parts of the service provider organization 
on availability-related queries and concerns
• 
Provide assistance to incident and problem management process, 
as any outage impacts availability of services
• 
Continuous improvement of design to increase availability, 
provided that the costs do not exceed the agreement with the 
customer

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
100
5.7.5.4  Scope of Availability Management
Availability management is an overarching process across the service lifecycle. In short, it 
is active throughout the stages, and it ceases to exist when the service is decommissioned. 
Its scope includes the following:
	
1.	
Monitoring of components and IT services, including 
providing criteria for categorizing events
	
2.	
Defining techniques and methodologies to measure 
availability
	
3.	
Automating recovery of components and IT services through 
development of scripts
	
4.	
Developing availability plans with availability targets that are 
in line with agreed SLAs
	
5.	
Providing necessary guidance during design of services with 
respect to expected availability targets
	
6.	
Periodically conducting tests on components and services to 
check the in-built resiliency
	
7.	
Finding ways to pro-actively improve availability of services
5.7.6  Capacity Management
Men are wise in proportion, not to their experience, but to their capacity 
for experience. 
—George Bernard Shaw
Capacity management is similar to availability management, in the sense that it is a key 
component of service warranty and extends across the service lifecycle. The process deals 
with the capacity of services and other aspects of a service where capacity comes into play.
Let’s say that you are hungry for Italian food, and there’s a Jamie’s Italian restaurant 
down the street. You have been planning on dining there for a long time, but things 
haven’t been favorable for a quiet evening dinner. You check their web site and find the 
restaurant is open (available) until 11 P.M. You head to the restaurant, and check with the 
maitre d’ for a seat. The maitre d’ shrugs and apologetically tells you that the restaurant is 
full, and there are reservations running up to closing time. In this example, the restaurant 
was available, meaning service was available for use. But, it did not have sufficient 
capacity to service you. Being available was not sufficient, there needed to be enough 
capacity as well!
You probably have faced many scenarios such as this one. In Sydney and elsewhere, 
one of the most frustrating “available, but no capacity” moments is when I go to park my 
car in mall parking lots. There are multiple levels of car parking available, but capacity is 
full the whole time. Likewise, in the IT field, we may have Internet connectivity, but on a 
Sunday evening, the speeds are terrible, thanks to a lack of capacity.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
101
Capacity management deals with the capacity within the IT services. As you have 
seen in my examples, being available isn’t enough, there needs to be sufficient capacity as 
well. But, you don’t want to have excess capacity when you don’t need it. Excess capacity 
leads to higher costs of services. So, a customer expects to have the right capacity and at 
the right time.
5.7.6.1  Capacity Plan
All you need is the plan, the road map, and the courage to press on to 
your destination.
 —Earl Nightingale
They say that good planning is half the battle. It’s true in business, in life, and even in 
service management—capacity management specifically.
When I discussed availability management earlier, I barely touched on the topic 
of an availability plan. It was not even a side note, but rather just a bullet. But capacity 
management has an entire section dedicated to it. Why do you think this is the case?
Once you get a plan for availability of different services, they don’t change over time 
unless there is a renewed demand from the customer or negotiating from the service 
provider to bring the availability percentage down. If none of the parties intervene, the 
availability plan sticks to what it is. A regular review, maybe once a year, is all it takes 
to keep it breathing. Capacity management is a different ballgame. Capacity is a living 
creature; it keeps growing over time. Monitor your hard drive usage. You barely filled 
a third of it when you bought your laptop, and within a year, you are looking around 
for an external hard drive. In the age of information, data never ceases to grow. Every 
transaction, every conversation, every plan, every design, and every yin and yang 
occupies space, demanding space, and the need for additional capacity will just be a 
matter of time.
To cope with the growing demand for capacity, there is a dire need for planning to 
work better than ever. The capacity plan, as we call it in ITIL, is a living document that 
needs to be used as a bible for trending, demand planning, design changes, and every 
other trigger you can think of.
The capacity plan consists of the current capacities in the IT infrastructure, 
application capacities, and other related capacities such as people workload. The plan 
also would contain results of business intelligence and trending capacities to include the 
future capacity to look forward to the next quarter, six months, and a year. These trends 
give a heads up for increasing capacities, upgrading design, and technology to meet the 
capacity needs and to take measures to curb unnecessary capacity overload.
From my consulting and operational experience, I can tell you that this powerful 
planning tool is hardly being made use of in most organizations. When things go pear-
shaped, organizations jump into action and perform emergency capacity upgrades. In 
other words, capacity management has become a reactive activity, and the entire art of 
planning is lost in the midst of putting out fires and dealing with issues when they arise.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
102
5.7.6.2  Capacity Management Subprocesses
Capacity management is like a onion—it has multiple layers, and for every layer you peel 
out, a new one gets uncovered. To do a complete capacity management planning and 
implementation, you need to look at capacity management from a number of levels. They 
are referred to as subprocesses of capacity management:
	
1.	
Business capacity management
	
2.	
Service capacity management
	
3.	
Component capacity management
Remember the names of these subprocesses, especially from a Foundation exam 
perspective.
5.7.6.2.1 
Business Capacity Management
Business capacity management is the highest layer. It provides a structure for taking 
future demands from the customer and porting them into plans, designs, and roadmaps 
for upgrading capacities. It ensures that the right amount of capacity is available at the 
right time.
Business capacity management leverages various models, such as trending, 
predictive modeling, and getting future requirements from customer to source the future 
capacity requirements.
Let’s say that an organization is planning on acquiring a few smaller organizations 
in its quest for growth. The capacity management is expected to understand the potential 
increase in capacity is a result of the acquisition. Based on the capacity changes, capacity 
management must analyse the impact to the infrastructure and make necessary plans to 
designs for the forecasted capacities.
Inputs for this subprocess mainly come from the service strategy lifecycle phase, 
which has an ear to the customer, and as the saying goes, the ear is the avenue to the 
heart. Service portfolio management in the service strategy phase plays a big part in 
shaping the future capacity requirements by introducing new services, new processes, 
and new technology to cater to it.
5.7.6.2.2 
Service Capacity Management
One layer deep, the service capacity management drives the operational side of capacity 
management. It manages the capacities of the IT service usage on a regular basis and 
places control mechanisms to ensure that the capacities are in check. One way to do 
this is to program thresholds on the monitoring tool to raise a warning message at some 
capacity and throw out errors at a higher threshold.
A real-life example is the iCloud service that sends out e-mail when you near the 
90% capacity mark, warning you that backups may not be possible if you don’t buy more 
capacity. At the next threshold capacity, it warns you that the backup did not take place as 
you didn’t have sufficient capacity. This happens with every single service that we use on 

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
103
a day-to-day basis. Other examples include broadband Internet data usage, minutes on 
your mobile phone, and bandwidth usage of your web sites.
This subprocesses also keeps an eye on the performance of capacities and its related 
SLAs as agreed to with the customer. On an agreed term, service capacities are measured 
and reported back to the service-level management process and to the customer. It also 
aids business capacity management in predicting future capacity requirements.
5.7.6.2.3 
Component Capacity Management
The innermost layer in capacity management is the component capacity management. It 
deals with the capacities of individual components that make up the service. It deals with 
the management of the individual components and places control mechanisms around it.
Just as in services, automated thresholds are placed to ensure there is a warning 
before the storm. Examples could include the warning message from a storage server 
when it reaches 80% disk capacity. Let’s say that the storage management group ignores 
it, and when it reaches 90%, it sends out an exception alert. Still no response at 95%, so 
it triggers an incident, which will force the teams to act on it at the earliest. This is the 
reactive phase that I was referring to earlier. This is the reality today. Teams don’t gear up 
before the storm, but rather take corrective measures when the storm is about to hit.
5.7.7  IT Service Continuity Management
IT is the lifeline for all of us today, and living without it is unthinkable. Whether we deal 
with communicating with people, medical operations and scans, entertainment, or even 
the day-to-day work we perform, in one form or another, they are all connected somehow 
to IT. So it is imperative that IT services provide some kind of insurance, which does not 
deal with penalties and compensation, but rather a ring of resilience outside the normal 
resilience discussed in the availability management process.
IT services come in all shapes and sizes, mainly from the criticality perspective. 
Not all IT services are equally critical. IT service continuity management (ITSCM) is 
expensive, so it mainly covers critical services. For example, a customer dealing with a 
call center leverages on telephony and Internet from a service provider. For his business, 
telephony would be a critical IT service considering he is in the business of making and 
receiving calls. For another customer who is in the business of content writing for blogs, 
Internet would be a critical IT service, but telephony would not be critical. So, how does 
the service provider decide which IT services to take into the ring of an additional layer of 
resilience and which ones to leave out?
It’s simple really. The service provider doesn’t have to make that choice. It asks the 
customer to pick out critical services, and the customer would be firmed up with the IT 
service continuity process. I will discuss the entire process in the next section.
So what exactly is this resilience that I am talking about, you might ask?
Suppose a customer obtains e-mail service from a service provider. The servers 
hosting the e-mail IT infrastructure, database, and applications are in a single data center 
in one part of the city. Let’s say that this part of the city gets flooded, or gets hit by a riot 
or earthquake, and the data center as a result becomes inaccessible or powered down. 
The business still has to continue. And without e-mails, as the critical service for this 

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
104
business, business activities cannot function. So the customer would want to be ensured 
that IT service continuity process is shielding its IT service. The service provider should 
have built servers, databases, and applications (maybe something like a stripped-down 
version) and have set up a real-time replication in another data center located in another 
city. So if the main data center were to go down, the traffic for e-mail services would 
switch automatically to the backup data center located in the other city, and the customer 
could keep working as though there were no drop in IT services. The IT service continuity 
is what the customer gets by enrolling in the process and paying a special premium for it. 
IT service continuity, or disaster recovery (DR) as it is popularly known, will not 
come into play unless there is an incident that cannot be resolved within the SLA. It is 
enacted only when resolution seems unlikely and most definitely when disaster strikes.
5.7.7.1  Scope of IT Service Continuity Management
As mentioned earlier, ITSCM comes into the picture only if disaster strikes. Normal 
outages that can be resolved within the SLA and maybe just outside it are dealt with 
through the incident management process.
The scope of IT services that needs to be protected from disasters is not a decision 
that the service provider makes. It has to come from the business. The business, on 
the other hand, may not know the various IT services that are important to it. They 
would only know the business services that are critical for them. The business would 
have a process to cater to disasters, and this process is called the business continuity 
management (BCM). The BCM will give insight into which business services are critical to 
the customer, and the IT service provider will map critical IT services based on the critical 
business services. This is illustrated in the ITSCM lifecycle in Figure 5-12.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
105
The output of BCM will be a business continuity plan (BCP). The BCP is a document 
that provides the recovery details for the business to undertake during a disaster. Say, for 
example, in a bank, the foreign exchange department is valued as critical, and in case of 
a disaster, the business decides to shift its operations to another country. This document 
consists of the details around how they plan to do it, not from an IT perspective but from 
a business perspective.
The corresponding plan for the IT service provider is the IT service continuity plan 
(ITSCP). It is derived from the BCP and aims to support the BCP activities. In the earlier 
example, the business’s plan is to move foreign exchange operations to another country. 
The ITSCP will support it by developing the list of activities it will take to shift operations 
to another country. An ITSCP for this scenario could be something like “inform other 
country’s IT team on the BCP invocation, route all traffic to another country, retrieve data 
from backup, and perform tests.”
ITSCM covers all service assets, including infrastructure, applications, networks, 
technical teams, and other items that contribute to a service. The BCM is responsible for 
taking care of seats, users, and other items relating to business processes.
The scope of ITSCM process extends to the following items:
	
1.	
Development of ITSCM and ITSCP, and these would 
eventually become a part of the customer’s BCM process and 
BCP document

made in the ITSCP are in working order
	
6.	
Maintenance of the ITSCP on an ongoing basis, and changes 
may be needed when major design changes are performed
5.7.7.2  Objectives of IT Service Continuity Management
At a high level, ITSCM exists to ensure that the ITSCM is in sync with BCM, and ITSCP 
with BCP. When disaster strikes, recoveries need to be done as per the ITSCP, at the 
agreed timelines.
Specifically, the objectives of ITSCM include:
	
1.	
Develop ITSCP in line with BCP to support business 
continuity management of the customer organization
	
2.	
Conduct BIA exercises on a regular basis, and after major 
changes to ensure that the ITSCP is aligned to customer 
requirements
	
3.	
Perform risk assessment, and manage risks when they occur, 
along with the business, availability, and information security 
management processes
	
4.	
Advise change management on all major changes, in line with 
the ITSCP
	
5.	
Advise all other processes and the business on ITSCM-related 
activities
	
6.	
Conduct regular drills to ensure service continuity designs 
work as per the plan
	
7.	
Provide guidance to improve availability of services
	
8.	
Negotiate with suppliers and agree to ensure that the ITSCP 
is supported and provisioned in conjunction with supplier 
management process

5.7.7.3  Business Impact Analysis
BIA is an analysis methodology that helps in identifying critical IT services for the customer’s 
organization. This tool helps to spell out all possible impacts when services go down.
For example, I am an author, and work full time writing books, articles, and blogs. If I 
were to lose Internet, I will:
	
1.	
Not meet my writing targets
	
2.	
Not make money writing, which is a financial loss
	
3.	
Not meet my legal obligations as I fail on my SLAs
	
4.	
Lose readership base, which puts me at a competitive 
disadvantage over my peers
In this example, I have broken down the impacts of losing a critical IT service. The 
first three items on the list are black and white, and they are often referred to as hard 
impacts. The last in the list, losing readership base, is a soft impact, as it is my perception 
of the impact, and it cannot be quantified as I did with the others. To summarize, BIA 
deals with both the hard and soft impacts of the customer if he potentially loses IT 
services.
In this exercise, the analysis is done against every single service that is offered to a 
customer. The results are tabulated and compared and decisions are made in identifying 
the critical services. All the IT services that are leveraged by the VBF can be tagged as 
critical IT services, as VBFs are critical to the customer’s organization.
Here are some items that are considered when BIA is performed:
• 
Direct financial losses
• 
Indirect financial losses
• 
Loss of reputation
• 
Competitive disadvantage
• 
Legislative and regulatory losses
• 
Health and safety risks
• 
Embarrassment
• 
Loss of control
ITIL recommends that this exercise be conducted by obtaining data and feedback 
from across all hierarchical levels in the organization. A senior management member can 
provide the estimated losses in terms of numbers, a middle-level manager can provide 
operational losses, including productivity losses. A junior staffer can provide runway 
details like the customer’s direct feedback, and they can also provide insight into the 
pulse of the customer. After gathering feedback from all levels, the numbers and the 
feedback need to be tallied to ensure that one layer’s exaggeration does not lead to wrong 
IT services being termed critical, and vice versa.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
108
5.7.7.4  Risk Assessment
I have touched on risk assessment and management in the risk management process in 
the service strategy lifecycle phase. The area surrounding risks is critical to organizations, 
and generally they hire many risk management experts to deal with risks in the 
organization and their mitigation. In service strategy, it is looked at from a strategic 
perspective. Here, I’ll delve deeper and embed risk mitigations in the design of IT 
services.
There is a distinct difference between risk assessment and risk management. Risk 
assessment deals with the possibility of threats and the potential impact the risks bring 
to the table. It also works with various design processes to reduce risks in the system. It 
is somewhat like having a backup diesel generator (DG) and an uninterrupted power 
supply (UPS) for data centers housed in countries where power shutdowns are common. 
Risk management, on the other hand, looks at the response when risks materialize. For 
all the identified risks, a mitigation action (risk management responses) is identified, and 
when the risk materializes, the planned responses are carried out to the tee.
To reduce risks, here are some countermeasures undertaken by IT service providers:
	
1.	
Storage Area Network (SAN) and Network Area Storage (NAS) 
storage solutions for ensuring multiple resilience layers to 
secure data
	
2.	
Full, incremental, and differential backups to ensure data are 
safeguarded
	
3.	
Installation of diesel generators (DG) and uninterrupted 
power supply (UPS)
	
4.	
Autofailover for IT components like servers, switches, and 
routers
	
5.	
Elimination of single point of failures in service design
5.7.8  Design Coordination
There are seven processes in the service design lifecycle phase, excluding the design 
coordination. All seven processes contribute to the design of IT services. They do not 
work in isolation, and yet they need to be coordinated and brought under a single 
umbrella for alignment with the objectives, sequencing, timelines, and synergies. The 
process that connects various dots in the service design lifecycle phase, that manages 
end-to-end design activities, and that communicates evenly with all other design 
processes is the design coordination process. It is like a project management process, 
setting objectives, tracking, measuring, and resolving conflicts if any arise.
Design coordination is a small process as it does not add anything directly to the 
design of IT services. But it opens up communication channels between processes and 
provides all the support that is needed for achieving design objectives. Although it is a 
small process, it is an important and integral part of service design.

Chapter 5 ■ Service Design
109
5.7.8.1  Objectives of Design Coordination
The main objective of design coordination process is to ensure that the service design 
objectives are met. The complete objectives include:
	
1.	
Aligning with various design processes toward the common 
goal involving various technologies, processes, architectures, 
and systems
	
2.	
Ensuring consistency in design across processes, partners, 
personnel, standards, frameworks, and architecture
	
3.	
Ensuring that the service design aligns to the direction set by 
the service strategy phase and conforms to the governance 
and architectural requirements
	
4.	
Managing conflicts with various teams, resources, schedules, 
and costs
	
5.	
Managing communication between various parties such as 
internal teams, suppliers, customers, and other stakeholders
	
6.	
Managing design-related activities by coordinating between 
various involved parties
	
7.	
Creating service design package (SDP) for new and changed 
IT services
	
8.	
Obtaining requirements from the service strategy phase and 
ensure transition to the service transition phase, the phase 
responsible for building and implementing the services
	
9.	
Performing quality and sanity checks for all inputs and 
outputs coming in and out of service design phase
	
10.	
Ensuring that the service design processes improve 
continually, and churn out robust designs and quick 
turnaround
	
11.	
Defining the entry and exit criteria for service designs
5.7.8.2  Scope of Design Coordination
The scope of the design coordination process extends to all service design processes. But 
the question we should be asking is whether the process must be involved for all design-
related activities. The answer to the question is for the service provider to decide.
For example, development of a new service requires major coordination efforts, so yes, 
design coordination is definitely needed. A simple change involving a few configuration 
modifications can leave out design coordination. A major change that is being implemented 
across the customer landscape involving major design changes needs to be coordinated 
between various stakeholders. So the service provider must think through such scenarios 
and come up with a policy that draws boundaries for design coordination.

1.	
Providing support to projects through the service design 
processes and related activities

CHAPTER 6
Service Transition
Transitions themselves are not the issue, but how well you respond to 
their challenges!
—Jim George
The service strategy has been drawn. Blueprints have been developed. The next logical 
step is to develop and implement the services. Service transition takes care of this.
Hopefully you have begun to see a trend in each of the lifecycle phases presented so 
far. Every lifecycle phase has a specific role, and the role can be carried out sequentially. 
You cannot implement a service without a strategy getting mapped out and designed. 
Likewise, as you will see in the future phases as well, they have a specific role to play.
When I mention developing and implementing a service, I am talking about giving 
wings to the design to make it fly. Say, for example, the service that has been designed is 
an e-mail service involving an Exchange server, Outlook clients, and web accessibility. To 
implement it, the service transition must procure the recommended servers, software, 
network, and other pieces of the service that are absolutely necessary. Once they are 
procured, servers need to be built, software needs to be deployed, networks need to be 
configured, and the entire service must be tested end to end. This is the role of service 
transition, to implement services and to ensure that they are developed and implemented 
as per the designs, and then once the service stabilizes, hand it over to service operations 
to maintain the status quo.
For a service involving application development, let’s say you are developing a new 
software to cater to customers for their bandwidth usage. The software design is obtained 
from the service design lifecycle phase. Service transition must build, test, and deploy 
IT services. Upon deploying, the service transition phase verifies the functionalities, and 
when all the functionalities are working as designed, it is handed over to application 
support to perform ongoing operational activities.
6.1  Objectives of Service Transition
Service transition exists to ensure that the design elements get translated into working blocks 
of service components and are integrated with the existing services, or work independently 
as a standalone service, meeting the service strategy and service design objectives.

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
116
Service transition does not come into play until new services are introduced, but it 
does have a role whenever changes are made to services, including retirement of services.
In short, service transition acts as a bridge between service design and service 
operations. Service design is the phase that develops blueprints, and service operations 
ensures that the services are maintained as per the requirements, design, and as 
mandated. Service transition ensures that the service design (which is on paper) gets 
built, tested, and handed over to service operations.
The overall objectives of service transition are:
• 
Planning of service changes, including risks, impacts, and 
management
• 
Managing risks, end to end, for new services, retired services, and 
for services undergoing changes
• 
Building and deploying services as per the service design
• 
Providing feedback to service design on the performance of 
services, so that the right expectations are set with the customer
• 
Policing all changes to ensure only those with business value get 
implemented
• 
Building and managing the individual service components 
and their respective relationships, to aid in risk and impact 
assessment of changes, and to support incident troubleshooting
• 
Maintaining a knowledge database on all services
6.2  Scope of Service Transition
The ITIL service transition lifecycle phase acts as a bridge between service design and 
the actual services that will be leveraged by the users. It plays a big part in translating 
the designs on paper into actual servers, configured network switches, application 
development, testing, deployment, evaluation, and handover to operations. It is a critical 
phase as it builds and deploys IT services into production through rigorous evaluation, 
testing, and validation.
The scope of service transition is massive considering that it guides the IT service 
provider to transition new, modified, and retired services. It touches technology, people, 
people’s behaviors (in terms of process adherence), vendors, and the entire service 
provider organization.
Specifically, the scope includes:
• 
Introduction of new services: all components of new services 
such as building, testing, deployment, training, and handover
• 
Managing changes to services: hardware and software, including 
build, test, deployment, and handover
• 
Retirement of services: hardware and software

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
117
• 
Acting as a guardian for innovation and minimizing unintended 
consequences
• 
Transfer of services to other service providers
The service transition lifecycle phase plays a major role when management of IT 
services changes hands from one entity to another or one model to another, such as:
• 
Outsourcing of services to an external company
• 
Insourcing of services from an external organization
• 
Co-sourcing with another service provider
• 
Transfer of services from one service provider to another
• 
Offshoring of services
• 
Near-shoring of services
• 
Transfer to service integrators
• 
Mergers and acquisitions
• 
Joint ventures with other organizations
• 
Downsizing and upsizing
6.3  Value of Service Transition
The service provider and customer organizations can benefit from a standardized 
service transition framework which is based on best practices and lessons learned from 
previous service transition projects. None of these transitions are smooth, be in IT or in 
life. Changing to new ways of working changes the behaviors of people and the processes 
involved, and it is associated with a learning curve that is not going to be straightforward. 
A standardized service transition framework can alleviate problems by ensuring that 
transitions are effective, efficient, and conform to service objectives.
The values obtained from service transition are:
• 
Accurate estimation of service transition constraints such as 
scope, schedule, and cost
• 
Better management of risks and assessments
• 
Ensure changes succeed and don’t lead to unintended 
consequences
• 
Make service transition processes as simple and easy to follow for 
seamless adoption
• 
Play a pivotal role in ensuring service transition assets are shared 
between services
• 
Resolve conflicts between various service transition projects

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
118
• 
Reduce service transition efforts
• 
Set the right expectations on the services from various parties: 
customers, senior management, suppliers, and other stakeholders
6.4  Service Transition Processes
Service transition is a major phase for ITIL applicability and popularity in terms of roles 
in organizations. You might find roles such as change managers, release managers, 
and transition managers being touted for opportunities and acquisition. There are five 
processes in the ITIL foundation syllabus that you will study in the service transition phase:
	
1.	
Change management
	
2.	
Release and deployment management
	
3.	
Service asset and configuration management
	
4.	
Knowledge management
	
5.	
Transition planning and support
6.4.1  Change Management
Change management governs all the changes performed on the IT services that are 
offered to customers. It ensures that only the necessary changes go through after proper 
validation, approvals, and analysis. This process is the gatekeeper for any new services 
that get introduced, services that are retired, and all the major and minor modifications 
that are done to IT services.
A change in ITIL is defined as an activity performed (generally on 
a configuration item) that affects IT services (either positively or 
negatively). It could be modification of existing configuration, additions, 
or decommissions.
Here are some examples of changes:
• 
Implementation of optic fiber Internet service to the customer 
organization
• 
Transition of e-mail services from Exchange to Gmail
• 
Decommissioning of mainframe computers
• 
Adding extra memory to servers
• 
Changing ownership of a core switch
• 
Adding an IP to blacklist on firewall

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
119
• 
Modification of a batch job
• 
New version release of an iPhone app
• 
Upgrade of an enterprise application
6.4.1.1  Objectives of Change Management
I mentioned that change management is a governance process. It is a process that 
controls the changes that go into the IT environment. It is a process that acts as a 
gatekeeper, vetting, analyzing, and letting through only the qualified changes.
According to ITIL, the official definition of change management is that it controls the 
lifecycle of all changes, enabling beneficial changes to be made with minimum disruption 
to the services. This is change management in a nutshell: Ensure only beneficial 
changes go through, remove the wheat from the chaff, and ensure that if anything were 
to go wrong, the risks are well understood, mitigated, and prepared for with minimal 
disruption.
To expand on this, the way this process works is somewhat like the changes that 
get funneled through the change management process. Only the changes that pass all 
the criteria set forth, that are of good quality, and are deemed beneficial to customers or 
service providers in general are approved for implementation. You should also know that 
the buck stops with change management for providing approvals. Implementing changes 
is managed through the release and deployment management process, which works in 
tight integration with the change management process. To reiterate, change management 
is accountable for providing approvals, and the release and deployment management 
process is accountable for implementation and postimplementation activities. I will 
discuss release and deployment in detail later in this chapter.
Digging deeper into change management, the output or the objectives of change 
management are as follows:
• 
Respond to the customer’s ever changing needs (technology 
upgrades and new business requirements) by ensuring that value 
is created
• 
Align IT services with business services when changes are 
planned and implemented
• 
Ensure all changes are recorded, analyzed, and evaluated by the 
process
• 
Ensure only authorized changes are allowed to be prioritized, 
planned, tested, and implemented in a controlled manner
• 
Ensure changes to configuration items (CIs; you will learn 
about this under service asset and configuration management 
process later in this chapter) are recorded in the configuration 
management system
• 
Ensure business risks are well understood and mitigated for  
all changes

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
120
6.4.1.2  Scope of Change Management
Change management applies to all changes that are performed on the IT services. 
But what is the definition of a change? I have provided examples of changes when I 
introduced the process. The official definition of what a change is:
Change is the addition, removal, or modification of anything that could 
have an effect on IT services.
Yet, the scope is not clear. An IT service can spread far and wide, including 
the suppliers who support the service, the IT professionals who manage it, and the 
documentation for it. Does changing any of these peripheral components call in a 
change? Yes, but it depends on the agreement between the service provider and customer 
organization. Managing more items requires more time and resources, which adds up 
to expenses. If the customer wants to have absolute control over the IT services, then 
yes, every single element that makes up a service must come into the purview of change 
management. In the real world, this is often not the case, owing to the financials. Many 
of the indirect components are ignored in the interests of reducing expenses, and some 
companies find innovative ways of controlling the peripheral objects using standard 
changes and service requests.
From my experience, there is much more to change management than addition, 
removal, and modification of IT services. Take the example of running an ad hoc 
report. You are not adding, removing, or modifying anything, just reading data from the 
database. Yet, you possess the power in your hands to break systems with the wrong set 
of queries that goes searching in each and every table, that utilizes the infrastructure’s 
resources, and could potentially cause performance issues to the IT service. In this case, 
if you bring this through to change management, they can possibly identify the resource 
consuming queries and shelve them or schedule them to be run during off-peak hours.
To define scope, ITIL takes a holistic approach to define what can be categorized a 
change. It scopes changes based on the five aspects of design:
	
1.	
New or modified services, where functional requirements are 
changing, translating to resources and capabilities
	
2.	
Management information systems (reporting and 
communication) and tools
	
3.	
Technology and management architecture
	
4.	
Policies, processes, and components derived from processes, 
such as templates, guidelines, etc.
	
5.	
Measurement systems, metrics, key performance indicators 
(KPIs), and associated methodologies

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
121
6.4.1.3  Types of Change Requests
Not all changes are the same. They come in all shapes and sizes. You cannot use the same 
yardstick for all changes. You need different policies and processes to handle various 
types of changes. In this section, I will introduce the three types of changes, which will 
act as a guideline for organizations to further customize the change types based on their 
respective requirements.
The three types of change requests are:
	
1.	
Normal changes
	
2.	
Emergency changes
	
3.	
Standard changes
6.4.1.3.1 
Normal Changes
All the changes that are planned (unlike the emergency changes that cannot be planned), 
and those that are not pre-approved (the standard changes) are normal changes.  
In effect, the maximum number of changes in an organization is initially categorized as 
normal changes.
Normal changes are generally associated with all the bells and whistles of the change 
management process and are often well analyzed, tested, mitigated, and verified. The 
maturity of an organization’s change management process is often measured through the 
normal change process and the metrics and KPIs associated with it.
Examples of normal changes would be a major upgrade from Windows Server 2008 
to Windows Server 2012, implementation of a program to handle the supply chain, and 
decommissioning of mainframe servers.
Normal changes are discussed in detail later in this chapter.
6.4.1.3.2 
Emergency Changes
Changes that are necessary to urgently fix an ongoing issue or crisis are considered 
emergency changes. These changes are mostly implemented as a resolution to a high-priority 
incident. The nature of such changes requires swift action, whether it is getting the necessary 
approvals or the testing that is involved. Generally, emergency changes are not thoroughly 
tested, as the time availability is minimal. In some cases, they may go through without any 
testing, although this is not recommended, even for an emergency change.
The success of emergency changes reflects the agility of an organization and the 
change management process to act on disruptions in a time-constrained environment 
and to come out unscathed in the eyes of the customer and your competition. Emergency 
change management supports the incident management process in the resolution of 
incidents, especially major ones.
Examples of emergency changes are replacement of hardware infrastructure and 
restoring customer data from backup volumes.

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
122
6.4.1.3.3 
Standard Changes
Normal changes that are low risk and low impact in nature can be categorized as standard 
changes. I specifically use the word “can” in the previous sentence, as categorization 
of changes as standard is at the discretion of the service provider and customer 
organizations.
Any organization will have a good chunk of low-risk and low-impact changes. In my 
estimate, it should run up to 50% or thereabouts. The service provider’s responsibility to 
deliver agile change management depends on their ability to identify standard changes 
from the normal change list and obtain necessary approvals to standardize them.
Standard changes have distinct advantages and create value for customers. They 
follow a process that is less stringent and are free from multiple approvals and lead times 
that are often associated with normal changes. This provides the service provider the 
arsenal needed to implement changes on the fly, which increases productivity and also 
helps deliver better value to the customer.
Examples of standard changes include minor patch upgrades, database reindexing, 
and blacklisting IPs on firewalls.
My expertise is in value creation, and standard changes often deliver maximum 
value with minimum effort. Organizations must make an effort to identify standard 
changes and provide able controls around them to ensure that standard changes don’t go 
uncontrolled and are reined in with governance and rugged process.
6.4.1.4  Change Models
In the previous section I discussed the types of change requests at a high level. Going a 
few hierarchies down, every type of change can be further broken down based on the 
technology involved, personnel, customer requirements, and change management policies.
For example, the steps involved in introducing a software upgrade and replacement 
of a hard disk are different. A single standardized process to incorporate all types of 
changes, irrespective of the technology involved, will not present the best that the 
change management process can offer. So it is necessary, in the interests of the service 
provider to improve delivery, to create change models for different types of changes. In 
Figure 6-1, I provide examples of change models for a software upgrade and for hard disk 
replacement.

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
123
Change model is a repeatable way of dealing with a particular category 
of change. A change model defines specific agreed-upon steps that will be 
followed for a change of this category.
Not all organizations opt for change models. They run with change management 
processes that are standard for all technologies, teams, and customers. This has its 
limitations, although the concept of standardizing sounds good on paper. Tailoring the 
process through change models helps improve delivery and provides better control 
and governance of changes. Generally speaking, every change model must contain the 
following:
• 
Individual steps for processing changes, including mitigation  
and risks
•

6.4.1.5  Change Remediation
There is no assurance that all changes that go in will come out undaunted and successful 
as planned. You need an alternate plan if the change were to fail. The actions taken to 
nullify the change (back out or rollback) or to invoke service continuity plans are called 
change remediation. It is an important part of the change plan to ensure that the IT 
services do not affect the customer.
When any change proposal comes in, it is imperative that the change plan consist 
of a section to detail the back-out procedures. Not all changes can be backed out. For 
example, reloading of an operating system after disk format is not reversible. In such 
cases, an alternate plan must be in place to ensure that the IT service that is being 
changed does not affect the business services it supports. In extreme cases, when changes 
fail, IT service continuity plans are invoked. Say, for example, a live database is being 
altered and the change breaks down, taking down the entire customer’s business. In such 
cases, IT service continuity plans will power the business continuity plans to ensure that 
businesses come back to life at the earliest possible time.
All changes are inherently risky. The spectrum of risk depends on the particular 
change. Risks can be identified accurately when change remediation plans are spelled 
out. Say, for a particular change, change remediation is to invoke service continuity plans. 
This is a high-risk change and needs to be handled with the utmost care. In effect, all 
changes must include change remediation plans to ensure that risks are identified fully 
and completely. Only when the risks are identified can appropriate decisions and actions 
be taken to mitigate the risks.
A change window is the timeframe between the start of the change and when the 
change is to be complete—implemented and verified. The back-out plans must be in 
line with the change window and ensure that the plan to back out a change is during the 
change window and not outside it.
A typical change plan consists of an implementation plan with various phases, 
triggers, and milestones. At every milestone, the plan spells out what is expected. If the 
expected output is not as per the plan, then a remediation plan is also drafted in line with 
it. So it becomes transparent for change implementers and change managers to expect 
as planned or to rollback if things don’t go as intended. This way, there is no space for 
ambiguity or speculation.
6.4.1.6  Change Advisory Board
The change advisory board (CAB) exists to support the change management team and to 
make decisions on approving or rejecting changes. To state it simply, it can be described 
as an extension of the change management role, and it exists to ensure that the proposed 
changes are nondisruptive, scheduled to minimize conflicts, prioritized based on risk and 
impact, and analyzed for every possible outcome to the hilt.
In an organization, you can have multiple CABs to support change management. A 
typical example would be a change being represented in an infrastructure CAB before 
it goes into the enterprise CAB, and perhaps followed by a global CAB. The essence of 
having a CAB is important, not the way it gets implemented.

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
125
It is critical for the change owner to present the complete change to the CAB, with 
all the possible details. This will help the CAB decide on authorization to proceed with it. 
The CAB has the authority to ask for additional information to be gained, additional tests 
to be conducted and presented back to them, and to ask that changes be rescheduled. In 
some cases, the CAB can reduce the scope of the change to ensure minimal impact, for 
business and technical reasons.
6.4.1.7  Lifecycle of a Normal Change
This section will explain the normal change process. Of the three types of changes 
(normal, emergency, and standard), the normal change process is elaborate, lengthy, and 
contains the most elements of the change management process.
Figure 6-2 indicates a typical workflow for the normal change management process. 
At first glance, it looks complicated, but as I break it down, you will understand that it is 
logical, and perhaps this will give you insight on how changes are recorded, approved, 
and implemented. The blue boxes indicate process activities and the yellow boxes 
indicate the people/team who is responsible for carrying out the activity.

6.4.1.7.1 
Create a Request for Change
A request for change (RFC) is a proposal initiated to perform a change. At this stage, the RFC 
is just a document with the change proposal. It is generally raised by the customer team or 
the technical team. There are no approvals or authorizations to perform the change.
The RFC document consists of all the necessary information pertaining to the 
change. RFCs will vary for every organization. The information needed, the format, the 
depth, and the necessary technical jargon are dictated by the change management policy. 
Generally speaking, an RFC consists of the following fields:
• 
Change number
• 
Trigger for the change
• 
Change description
• 
Configuration items that are changing
• 
Change justification
• 
What happens if the change is not implemented
• 
Change start and end date and time
• 
Change category (major, significant, minor)
• 
Who is involved in the change
• 
Test plan
• 
Implementation plan
• 
Back-out plan
• 
Verification plan
In most ITIL change management implementations, the RFC is directly available on 
IT service management tools such as ServiceNow and BMC Remedy. The details required 
are collected using web forms. A few years back, before the ITSM tools were a luxury, 
RFCs were presented in the form of Microsoft Excel templates. IT stakeholders used the 
copies of the template to populate and sent RFCs to change managers for processing and 
approval. This process was rather cumbersome as it was manual and was not governed 
using a system that applied the same yardstick for all change requesters. Change 
management has come a long way with the application of digital technology.
6.4.1.7.2 
Assess and Evaluate Change
The RFC is analyzed and evaluated for risk, impact, and conflicts. The change 
management team is responsible for performing the assessment. They typically 
understand the change details, check if the right stakeholders are indeed carrying out 
the change, and check for conflicts with connected systems and related changes going in 
during the same change window, among other conflict criteria. When the change is free 
of conflicts and is fully scoped and documented, it is scheduled to be presented in the 
CAB meeting.

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
128
In this activity, the role of the change manager is critical as the change manager 
alone would have visibility across the organization’s changes and are in the best position 
to identify conflicts, if any arise. For fantasy fanatics, you could think of change managers 
as the first line of defense against potential malicious changes.
I worked as an enterprise change manager at one stage in my career. The role was 
daunting, and knowing that the entire billion-dollar organization depended on your 
foresight and analysis was a scary thought. It was a challenging role that I enjoyed during 
my heydays in an operations role.
6.4.1.7.3 
Authorize Build and Test
The change manager calls for a CAB meeting of all stakeholders, from technical and 
business lines in the organization. I will explain CAB in detail in the next section.
In the CAB meeting, the change manager chairs the meeting and presents the 
change. The CAB provides its approval for building and testing the change. The forum 
provides authorization for developing the change, and this is the most critical approval in 
the change management process.
6.4.1.7.4 
Build and Test
The build and test process, which includes software development, unit testing, system 
integration testing, and user acceptance testing, is not part of the change management 
process. I have included it under the change management process to provide continuity 
in the process activities. These activities belong to the release and deployment process, 
which is the next process discussed in this chapter.
6.4.1.7.5 
Authorize Implementation
The test results are presented back to the change governance body: change management 
and the CAB. Based on the results, the change management team provides authorization 
to implement the change in the production environment.
This is yet another important activity, as all the identified testing activities must 
be completed successfully before the change is allowed to be implemented into the 
production environment.
6.4.1.7.6 
Implementation and Verification
The implementation and verification process is not part of the change management 
process per se. Like the build and test activity, this one comes under the release and 
deployment management process.
In this activity, the technical team will deploy the change in the production 
environment during the approved change window and perform postimplementation 
verification to ensure that the change is successful. If the change is not successful, it will 
be rolled back to the previous state if possible.

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
129
6.4.1.7.7 
Review and Change Closure
A postimplementation review (PIR) is conducted to ensure that the change has met its 
objectives. During this review, checks are performed to identify whether any unintended 
side effects were caused. There are lessons to be learned from changes. If there are any 
such candidates, it is fed into the knowledge management database (KMDB).
After the successful completion of the PIR, the change ticket is closed with an 
appropriate status, such as implemented successfully, change rolled back, change caused 
incident, or change implemented beyond the window.
The responsibility for carrying out this activity generally falls to the change 
management team, but some organizations have the change owners and change 
initiators close the change with the correct status.
6.4.1.8  Composition of the Change Advisory Board
The composition of the CAB consists of stakeholders from the business as well as from 
the service delivery. It can also include suppliers, legal experts, business relationship 
managers, and other stakeholders as identified by the chairperson.
CABs are dynamic. They could different for every change that comes up for 
discussion. For a particular change, you may have Supplier A, network manager, 
exchange manager, and IT security. For another change in the same CAB meeting, you 
may have Supplier B, application delivery head, and SAP manager as CAB members. 
Some organizations might insist on a set of permanent members of CAB who sit in on all 
proposed changes, during every single CAB, and additional approvers (dynamic) would 
come and go as necessary.
No matter who sits on the CAB as an approver, the change manager, who is 
responsible for all the change management activities, is the chairperson of the meeting 
and decides on CAB members, the changes that get represented on the CAB, and the final 
decision of the CAB.
Potential CAB members include:
• 
Change manager as chairperson
• 
Customers
• 
Suppliers
• 
IT security
• 
Service owners
• 
Business relationship managers
• 
Application delivery managers
• 
Operations managers
• 
Technical subject matter experts
• 
Facilities managers
• 
Legal representation

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
130
6.4.1.9  Emergency Change Advisory Board
Emergency changes require urgent attention and quick decisions. A CAB will not work 
for assessing emergency changes. These changes may happen in the middle of the night 
and require people to spring into decision-making mode to approve or reject changes. 
The need of the hour (literally) to help change management decide on approvals is the 
emergency change advisory board (ECAB).
The need for emergency changes pops up through incidents. It is possible that 
carrying out an emergency change (unsuccessfully) could impact the service more than 
the incident itself. So, in all necessity, there is a need for a few extra pairs of eyes to look at 
the proposed emergency change and provide the approval in the most awkward hours of 
the night (or day).
In most cases, a change ticket will not be created when approvals are sought. Change 
documentation may be done retrospectively for emergency changes. So it is imperative 
that emergency changes are approved based on what is heard and what was relayed.
An ECAB is comprised of key members who provide their decision on the proposed 
change. ECABs mostly happen over a phone line, and its extremely unlikely that there 
would be the luxury of members sitting across from one another. In some instances, 
the ECAB members may provide their approval individually, but not while they sit in a 
gathering. Individual responses are collected, and the change manager uses his wisdom 
in providing a direction for emergency changes.
Not all emergency changes call for an ECAB. Most of these are approved directly 
by the change manager if the ECAB rights are delegated. The critical ones, where entire 
enterprises could possibly be negatively impacted, would call for an ECAB to make 
decisions. The emergency change management process should not be exploited to push 
nonemergency changes under the guise of emergency changes.
It is possible that ECABs could ask service delivery teams to convert an emergency 
change to a normal change if a workaround exists to keep the service running.
An example could be a database containing customer information that has gone 
corrupt and the database team wants to restore data from backup tapes. They wish to 
do it as an emergency change to ensure that the customer’s data are present before the 
customer’s business starts in the morning. An RFC for performing an emergency change 
is raised. An ECAB is convened and approvals are sought. Change documentation may 
be done retrospectively. The database team restores the customer’s data from the backup 
tapes, and the emergency change is a success. During the business hours, the change 
document gets created with all the bells and whistles, and it goes through the entire cycle 
of obtaining approvals for visibility and to keep other stakeholders who were not involved 
in the ECAB process informed.
There is a specific place for ECABs, and they have a specific job to do. This process 
must not be abused with trivial emergency changes knocking on the doors of ECAB. It 
dilutes the process and forces the ECAB members to lose focus on what really requires 
their attention.

6.4.1.10  Change Management Interfaces
Change management is seated in the midst of all operational and transitional processes. 
In other words, change management is necessary for most ITIL processes to carry out 
their respective activities. It is a process that interfaces with operation and transition 
processes for operational changes, with design processes for tactical changes, and with 
processes from the service strategy for strategic changes.
This section will touch on the most important change management interfaces within 
the IT service management space. They include:
• 
Release and deployment management: Change management 
interlocks tightly around release and deployment management. 
While change management is responsible for obtaining change 
approvals, release and deployment management is responsible 
for building, testing, implementing, and verifying of changes.
• 
Service asset and configuration management: The service asset 
and configuration management process (which I will discuss later 
in this chapter) deals with configuration items, the individual 
elements of a service. Examples are servers, routers, load 
balancers, firewalls, applications, and the operating system. The 
process supports change management in identifying downstream 
and upstream impacts of the proposed change to a configuration 
item.
• 
Incident management: Change management has a special 
two-way relationship with incident management. Incidents are 
disruptions to services, and the incident management process 
deals with restoring services. To restore services, at times, changes 
need to be performed. Say, for example, a hard drive needs to 
be replaced or a database needs to be restored from backup 
tapes. These incident-resolving activities cannot be performed 
on the fly, but they need to go through change management for 
its assessment, approval, and authorization. It is also true that 
changes that go south often result in disrupted IT services, which 
gives rise to incidents. In this case, a change is the trigger for 
an incident, and in the previous instance, it was the other way 
around. Hence, the special two-way relationship between the two 
processes.
• 
Problem management: Problems are incidents where the root 
cause is unknown. Problem management looks at identifying 
the root cause and finding a permanent solution for repetitive 
incidents. A permanent solution, more often than not, calls for 
a change to be implemented. For example, the investigation 
of a problem could result in a recommendation to upgrade a 
particular software to the latest version. This action requires a 
change to be raised.

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
132
• 
IT service continuity management: Although IT service continuity 
management works mostly in the background and gets under 
way during disasters, it has a significant linkage with the change 
management process. Any major change involving design 
modifications calls for a revision or review of IT service continuity 
plans, procedures, and work instructions. IT service continuity 
has a permanent seat at the CAB for changes involving design 
changes. In every change meeting, this criterion needs to be 
assessed for potential changes in IT service continuity actions.
• 
Capacity management: Similar to IT service continuity 
management, capacity management needs to be in play for major 
changes and changes involving adding, removing, or modifying 
capacity levels. Suppose an upgrade to a technology is being 
proposed, one of the mandatory checks would be from the 
capacity management process to assess capacity requirements 
and to ensure required capacities are available.
• 
Information security management: As indicated earlier, IT 
security has a permanent seat in the CAB and is one of the 
important stakeholders for change management to function. 
Information security is most relevant in today’s world, and every 
change performed has the potential to create loopholes and 
vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers.
6.4.1.11  External Interfaces of Change Management
As mentioned earlier, change management is in the middle of all IT activities. This does 
not necessarily mean that ITIL processes alone interact with the process, but they  
interact and interface with a number of practices and frameworks in the projects and 
programs world.
Changes have triggers and, generally, demands and new requirements come from 
the business. The business has a similar change management process to govern the 
business side of things. The two change management sectors, business change and 
IT change, must talk to each other, pro-actively and regularly, to ensure that business 
requirements get translated into IT changes.
There is yet another type of change management for managing organizational 
changes, such as managing people, their behavior, and the changes that could 
unsettle them. IT change management needs to interface with organizational change 
management to ensure IT changes are accepted with open arms.
Suppliers play a major role in IT organizations today. Often, changes performed at 
the IT service provider end impact the supplier and vice versa. Therefore, it is necessary 
that the supplier change management process conforms to the IT change management 
process and policy controls.
In any organization, you have project lifecycles dictated by Project Management 
Institute (PMI) and Prince2 frameworks. Then you have the service management 
framework based on ITIL. The amalgamation between the frameworks is in the 
change management process. For example, a new software developed using the PMI 

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
133
framework needs to be introduced into production, and to do this, it needs to go through 
change management. Likewise, programs also interact and interface heavily with the 
change management process. The specifics of interfacing are outside the scope of ITIL 
Foundation syllabus.
6.4.2  Release and Deployment Management
While change management owns the approval side of things, release and deployment 
management process is in charge of the technical side of the change. It ensures that the 
change is built as per plan, tested as defined in the blueprints, and deployed as per the 
implementation plan.
6.4.2.1  Objectives of Release and Deployment Management
The purpose of release and deployment management is to ensure that the release 
succeeds without compromising the integrity of the live services through the build, test, 
implementation, and verification phases.
The objectives of release and deployment management include:
• 
Draft the release and deployment plan and get an agreement on it 
with all stakeholders, including customers
• 
Ensure that all releases are routed through the change 
management process
• 
Build release packages as defined in the release and deployment 
plan
• 
Test (unit, system integration, and user acceptance as necessary) 
release packages as defined in the release and deployment plan
• 
Ensure the integrity of release packages are stored in definitive 
media library (DML) and logged in configuration management 
system (CMS)
• 
Implement/deploy releases from DML as per the release and 
deployment plan
• 
Track releases on CIs through various stages: install, verify, and 
backed out if needed
• 
Track deviations in releases in the knowledge management 
database to ensure future releases are deviation free
• 
Record risks during the entire transition management process 
and identify mitigation actions
• 
Transfer knowledge of maintaining the release package to service 
operations lifecycle, by conducting sessions and handholding

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
134
6.4.2.2  Scope of Release and Deployment Management
As mentioned earlier, all changes come under the ambit of the release and deployment 
management process. I earlier mentioned that build, test, implementation, and 
verification are the key activities of this process. However, it is possible that certain 
activities, such as building and testing, may not be applicable for all changes, say for 
hardware changes where parts get replaced. There is no build and perhaps not a lot of 
testing that could be done unless the hardware is placed on the network.
In principle, the scope of release and deployment management starts at the build 
stage and traverses through testing, deployment, and verification and ends when the 
responsibilities are handed over to service operations for maintaining the status quo.
The set of configuration items that could possibly come under the release and 
deployment management process is defined by the customer. The following set of CIs 
generally figure in most implementations:
• 
Hardware CIs such as servers, routers, switches, and storage
• 
Virtual servers such as VMWare and Citrix
• 
Virtual storage servers
• 
Software and applications
• 
Database
• 
Staff training (handover to service operations) and training to users
• 
Documentation regarding release packages and the results of its 
key activities
6.4.2.3  Four Phases of Release and Deployment Management
The release and deployment management has four major activities. These activities are 
referred to as the four phases of release and deployment management:
	
1.	
Release and deployment planning
	
2.	
Release build and test
	
3.	
Deployment
	
4.	
Review and close
The four phases of release and deployment management are shown in Figure 6-3.

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
135
6.4.2.3.1 
Release and Deployment Planning
A good amount of planning has to go into release activities. A good plan is equivalent to 
half of the job being done. To ensure that the release is successful, it is critical that the 
architects and other experts brainstorm various possibilities, risks, and mitigations.
Before the plan gets under way, the change management typically provides approval 
to start the planning process. However, in practice, the approval to create release and 
deployment plans is provided from a different body such as a transition management 
group or a group that governs the projects that are chartered. In principle, these bodies 
govern the changes made to the system, and this can be the equivalent to change 
management authorization to create release and deployment management plans.
6.4.2.3.2 
Release Build and Test
The release and deployment plans are submitted to the CAB. The plans are dissected 
from every possible angle to identify loopholes and vulnerabilities. Upon successfully 
passing the CAB and change management scrutiny, the authorization to build and test 
the change is provided.
Building a change amounts to code development, getting hardware ready, or the 
prerequisites for building the change.
There are various types of testing. The most popular ones are unit tests (UTs), where 
individual components of a change are tested in isolation. Upon successful testing, the 
individual components are conjoined and a system integration test (SIT) is performed. 
After it successfully passes, users are asked to test the function in the user’s environment 
to check whether the change meets the requirements that are needed. This is called user 
acceptance testing (UAT). The testing is deemed complete after the user provides the 
okay that all elements of the change meet the requirement and are good to proceed.
The definitive media library (DML) is a repository where all the original codes, 
software licenses, and other software components are stored, physically and logically.

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
136
When the release and deployment management provides ample proof that the testing 
has been successful, the change management provides authorization to store the code/
software in the DML. DML is explained in detail later in this chapter.
6.4.2.3.3 
Deployment
The results of the release and deployment testing are brought before the CAB once again, 
and the results are vetted for possible complications and unseen bugs. When the CAB 
and change management are happy with what they see, they authorize it for deployment 
during the planned change window.
Deployment is a common term for implementation. It could include retiring of 
services or transferring services to another service provider as well. For simplicity, I’ll just 
refer to it as deployment.
Deployment of release packages is a specialized skill and calls for alignment of a 
number of parameters. There are a number of approaches to the release package. The 
big-bang approach is used when all the CIs are targeted to receive the package at the 
same time. Say there are 10,000 workstations that need to be pushed with a security 
patch. All 10,000 systems will receive the release package during the same window. 
This method is rarely employed as it has the ability to choke the network. And, if there 
are any mishaps, all the targeted systems could be affected, causing severe damage 
for the customer. The most popular approach is a phased approach, where the release 
is staggered through multiple phases to minimize complications and avoid network 
choke. In the same example involving 10,000 systems, it could be phased to target 1,000 
systems a day, and to run the entire release cycle for ten days. Further details on release 
deployment is outside the scope of ITIL Foundation exam and this book.
6.4.2.3.4 
Review and Close
After deployment, the release and deployment management process conducts a review to 
check the performance of the release and assesses the targets achieved. Lessons learned 
are documented in the KMDB. The release is closed after the review.
6.4.3  Service Asset and Configuration Management
Service asset and configuration management (SACM) is one of the most critical processes 
in the ITIL Framework. This process acts as a foundation/prerequisite for all other 
operational and transitional processes to carry out their respective objectives.
6.4.3.1  Service Assets and Configuration Items
There are two parts to this process: service assets and configuration items.
Service assets are individual elements that make up a service. In Chapter 2, I 
discussed service assets. The ten service assets are managed under this process. The 
entire lifecycle of the service assets, beginning with initiation, the changes it undergoes, 

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
137
and finally retirement, is managed, controlled, and tracked in the SACM process. 
Examples of service assets are monitors, laptops, datacenters, and servers.
A service asset is any resource or capability that could contribute to the 
delivery of a service.
Not every service asset is a CI, but every CI is a service asset. A CI is the fundamental 
component of a service that can be configured, tracked, accounted for, and controlled. 
For example, in an e-mail server involving servers, routers, and exchange application, 
each server, router, switch, application, and firewall can be called a CI. Why? Because 
these CIs can be tracked, controlled, accounted for, and audited.
A configuration item is a service asset that needs to be managed in order 
to deliver an IT service.
Who decides what can or cannot be a CI? It is at the discretion of the customer. If 
the customer is willing to shell out more to control and manage deeper than the servers, 
like the hard drive, processor, or RAM inside a server, then he might as well label them 
as individual CIs. But it is not prudent to take the CI level as low as the components of a 
server or any other equipment, as management then becomes complicated. Moreover, 
when you plot the value generated against the depth of CIs, by going deeper into the 
components, the value derived is negligible.
Every CI has a number of attributes attached to it. Attributes are various details 
that get recorded against a CI, such as owner, location, date of commission, status, and 
configuration. All these attributes are controlled through change management. This 
means that if any of the attributes have to be changed, the configuration manager or 
whoever wants to make the change should take it up with the change management 
process team. Attributes on configuration items cannot be changed on the fly.
Figure 6-4 illustrates the attributes of a server.

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
138
Any service asset that is critical or that directly impacts a service is a configuration 
item. This definition gives rise to a number of types of CIs that could potentially be 
leveraged in a service provider organization. Human CIs (workforce management), 
document CIs (document management), business CIs (the business processes that 
connects business side of things), software CIs (business applications and in-house 
developed software), and hardware CIs (server, router) are some examples. An 
organization can choose to hand over only software and hardware CIs to SACM, human 
CIs to HR departments, and document CIs to documentation teams. It is entirely their 
decision how to manage the CIs appropriately.
6.4.3.2  Configuration Management Database
A configuration management database (CMDB) is a repository containing all the CIs 
including their relationships. An example of a CMDB model is illustrated in Figure 6-5.

model

Figure 6-4.  Illustration of a configuration management database model

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
139
Within the CMDB, you can have multiple services, the individual CIs, and their 
relationships. Most modern ITSM tools, such as BMC Atrium, offer placeholders to record 
the upstream and downstream impacts. If you pick up a service and would like to see 
it visually, to see how CIs connect to one another, you will see an array of connections 
between the CIs, as illustrated in Figure 6-5. Using this visual image, other processes 
such as incident management can troubleshoot incidents with ease, and processes 
like change management can identify upstream and downstream impacts with a click 
of a button. Imagine if this were not in place, the whole activity involving analysis and 
troubleshooting would be tough.
In an organization, you could have multiple CMDBs depending on the requirement, 
business structure, and customer obligations. For example, you can have a CMDB for 
business units A, B, and C, a CMDB separately for customer ABC, and yet another CMDB 
for internal infrastructure and software. There is no limit, as long as the logic makes sense 
to manage, control, and keep matters uncomplicated.
6.4.3.3  Configuration Management System
The configuration management system (CMS) is the super database that contains all the 
CMDBs and more in its ecosphere. It is the layer that integrates all the individual CMDBs 
along with other databases in the IT service management space, such as known error 
database, incident records, problem records, service request records, change records, and 
release records. Figure 6-6 provides an illustration of a CMS.

It is possible that some CIs within a CMDB talk to other CIs in another CMDB. The 
overview of all the relationships between the CIs is provided in the CMS.
The CMS holds the CI data as well as other databases such as incident records, so 
service providers and customers alike can utilize the CMS in identifying all the incidents 
raised against a CI and the number of times they have failed on a regular basis.
6.4.3.4  Definitive Media Library and Definitive Spares
The DML is a repository for storing all licensed copies of procured software and software 
that has been developed in house. The repository can be an online one or a physical one, 
but it needs to be access controlled.
The software that gets accepted into the DML is controlled by the change 
management process, and only those copies that are authorized by change management 
into the DML are allowed to be used during the release and deployment management 
process. The software that gets into the DML is expected to be analyzed, quality tested, 
and checked for vulnerabilities before getting accepted.
In case of a physical DML where CDs, DVDs, and other storage media are used, it is 
expected that the storage facility is fireproof and can withstand normal rigors of nature 
and secure against media thefts.

The DML is ideally designed during the service design lifecycle phase and the 
following are considered during the planning stages:
• 
Medium to be used and the location for the master copies to  
be stored
• 
Security arrangements for both online and offline storage
• 
Access rights, who has access, and how it is controlled
• 
Naming convention for the stored media to help in easy retrieval 
and tracking
• 
What types of software go into the DML, for example, source 
codes or packages
• 
Retention period
• 
Audit plan, checklist, and process
• 
Service continuity of DML if disaster strikes
Definitive spares (DS) is a repository for storing hardware spares. Generally, all 
organizations store a certain amount of stock, mostly pieces of critical infrastructure, 
to be use to quickly replace hardware in case of an incident. And then there are stocks 
that are needed for the operational consumption and ever increasing demands of the 
customer.
Like DML, DS must be secured, tracked, managed, and controlled. However, change 
management generally does not get involved in controlling the items that go in and out 
of DS, as the gravity of compromising intellectual property and master copies of licensed 
versions can be very messy as compared to hardware spares. SACM process oversees the 
overall functioning of the DS.
6.4.3.5  Objectives of Service Asset and Configuration Management
The SACM process exists to ensure that the service assets that deliver the services are 
governed, controlled, managed, and tracked across their lifecycles. All attributes of 
service assets and CIs, including relationships, come under the ambit of SACM.
The objectives of SACM are:
• 
Ensure service assets are identified and are managed
• 
Identify, control, record, report, audit, and verify configuration items
• 
Maintain CI versions, baselines, attributes, and relationships
• 
Ensure CIs are controlled through change management, and only 
authorized changes can trigger changes to CIs
• 
Ensure CIs are accounted for, managed, and protect the integrity of it
• 
Maintain all CIs including their correct statuses, relationships, 
and attributes in the configuration management database

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
142
• 
Maintain historical information of CIs and their planned states as well
• 
Ensure CMDB is accurate at all times
• 
Support other processes by providing accurate and up-to-date 
configuration and asset management data
6.4.3.6  Scope of Service Asset and Configuration Management
Let’s looks at the scope of the service asset and configuration management individually.
6.4.3.6.1 
Asset Management
The asset management part of the SACM process is where the accountability of all the 
service assets happens. Under this, the service assets are identified, accounted for, 
managed, and controlled. The type of assets that will be individually managed will be at 
the discretion of the service provider organization.
For example, the service provider might decide to include the monitor as a part of a 
desktop, and not manage the monitor individually but under the whole unit of a desktop 
computer.
The question to ask is how well a service provider is able to manage the service 
assets, without any compromises to the users, service provider personnel, and to the 
services. Based on this, the service design lifecycle phase deems whether certain service 
assets are within or outside the scope for individual management. Remember that every 
single asset has to be managed. Whether they would be managed individually or as a 
group is at the service provider’s discretion.
In most organizations, service assets have a financial value associated with them. 
The user group that enjoys the service will be charged for the assets leveraged. For 
example, if I am using a laptop, each year my business unit gets billed a certain amount 
of money for the laptop that I use. Of course, it is notional charging, where an actual 
exchange of money does not take place. But, it is a good practice to keep track of assets 
and their financial information across the organizational units.
6.4.3.6.2 
Configuration Management
The customer decides the scope of CIs in their organization. I discussed this earlier. 
Based on the customer scoping, all CIs that directly impact services by their presence of 
lack thereof will generally be brought under the purview of the SACM process. In short, 
every identified CI is in scope, including the ones in stores and DML.
Remember that both hardware and software pieces of the service are considered 
CIs. Hardware CI examples include servers, routers, datacenter, and racks. Software CIs 
include operating systems, business applications, and licensed software.
The complete management of CIs, which encompasses the CI attributes, the 
relationships, and the configuration baselines, is brought under the management of 
SACM and is governed through the change management process.

6.4.4  Knowledge Management
The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
—Lao Tzu
As people start working in the IT field, they begin to understand the business of IT and 
become aware of the required work etiquettes. They learn to handle stakeholders and 
customers, they start managing teams, start leading engagements, and then move on to 
greater heights. This is a typical maturity cycle for an IT professional.
Likewise, organizations also go through a maturity lifecycle. It takes time, experience, 
and learning that the work brings in. One of the secrets to maturing on a fast-paced 
ladder is learning to capture knowledge, document experiences, and analyze failures. The 
ones who do these the best will learn from their mistakes and focus on new targets every 
time they set their sights on a goal. Knowledge management is the key to success, even for 
an organization that has matured over the years.
It is critical for organizations to avoid reinventing the wheel. If there is an SLA 
breach, the service provider organization must have learned from the past to jump into 
action right away rather than sit on the analysis bench. Current standards expect them 
to hit the ground running, and the only way they can achieve this is with the backbone 
created by a knowledge architecture that provides the right information at the right point 
in time.
Risks are inherent in every IT organization. One such risk is the attrition caused 
by employees jumping ship. What are the mitigation plans if there is excess attrition? 
Companies learn from the past and from the experience of others to (a) offer industry 
standard salaries and benefits, (b) provide growth opportunities for employees, and (c) 
maintain bench strength. When risk comes calling, they start enacting the plans executing 
measures to retain talent and to protect delivery to their customers. A not-so-mature 
organization might falter in being reactive to the situation and come up with actions after 
the eventuality and not before or during the risk proceedings.
6.4.4.1  Objectives of Knowledge Management
Knowledge management exists to support the service provider organization to succeed 
and to be better prepared for the decisions it needs to undertake. It is not a process 
that a is customer facing, but it’s effects make a difference in how decisions are made, 
customers are managed, and issues are dealt with.
The purpose of the knowledge management process as per the ITIL service 
transition publication is to share perspectives, ideas, experience, and information; to 
ensure that these are available in the right place at the right time to enable informed 
decisions; and to improve efficiency by reducing the need to rediscover knowledge.
The objectives of knowledge management are:
• 
Support the service provider organization to make sane decisions 
based on the wealth of information, experience, and learning
• 
Support the service provider to better efficiency and effectiveness 
of the services delivered to the customer

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
144
• 
Help in reducing the total cost of ownership by eliminating the 
need to reinvent the wheel
• 
Align the service provider personnel with the organization’s 
goals, objectives, and the principles that are leveraged to deliver 
services to the customer
• 
Manage the service knowledge management system (SKMS), 
which acts as a source of wisdom, information, and a library to 
rely on
• 
Provide the means to gather data, vet for usability, store for the 
future, and retrieve when needed
6.4.4.2  Scope of Knowledge Management
The knowledge management process appears in the service transition publication, but it 
does not necessarily mean that it gets acted upon in the service transition lifecycle phase 
alone. It is an overarching process that has a significant role to play in all five lifecycle 
phases and every process within the phases.
The knowledge management process gets designed in the service design phase 
and is implemented in the service transition phase, but it finds wide usage in the service 
operations phase where day-to-day operational activities bring in plenty of data points 
and the staff actively look for direction in the SKMS.
Service strategy also employs knowledge management in recording the strategic 
decisions, reminiscing on the previous decisions, and gaining the wisdom of the 
operational data to take decisions. For service design to be successful, it needs to reuse 
previously created designs and architectures. Service transition can lean on knowledge 
management to get aid in implementation strategies of the past, the successful strategies 
employed, and to chart a future course of action. Continual service improvement, which 
is a lifecycle phase that overarches across all other phases, is similar in nature to the 
knowledge management process. It heavily relies on the data available to complete its 
objectives.
6.4.4.3  Data-to-Information to Knowledge-to-Wisdom Concept
The data-to-information to knowledge-to-wisdom (DIKW) concept emphasizes the 
importance of data collection and indicates the lifecycle of its transformation. It is 
generally depicted through a pyramid structure, as shown in Figure 6-7.

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
145
Across the ITIL lifecycle phases, data are extracted during every process. Reports 
are prepared, and analysis is performed and presented to various stakeholders. All this is 
possible because the right set of data is captured in the first place. The DIKW pyramid/
model showcases how the data, which are nothing but numbers, can go through various 
stages of transformation in becoming something usable and useful and to trigger 
improvements.
6.4.4.3.1 
Data
Data are the most basic units that you can capture. Examples can be 54 incidents, 23 
services, 6 changes, and so on. They indicate a number or quantify the element that is 
measured. But they are mere numbers, and numbers by themselves don’t mean anything. 
Think about it. If I say 22 movies, am I conveying information that you could use without 
providing some additional information?
Data are a set of discrete facts.
So, to put it simply, data by themselves are useless. They are a set of discrete 
facts, and every organization captures tons of data daily. Unless you pad them up with 
relevancy, they are as good as junk. Let’s see how data can be made useful.
6.4.4.3.2 
Information
Numbers don’t tell you the story behind them. Unless you have the context associated 
with the numbers, they mean zilch. Information, as the word literally indicates, provides 
you the basic context to go with the data.
Information comes from providing context to data.

Figure 6-7.  The data-to-information to knowledge-to-wisdom pyramid model

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
146
For example, “54 incidents were raised yesterday and 23 services have been offered 
to customer ABC” means a whole lot more than the using just the numbers themselves.
To create information, data should be padded with contextual information, 
answering questions pertaining to who, what, when, or where. An example is shown in 
Figure 6-8.
Information exists in various forms. It can be embedded in a document, in an e-mail, 
or PowerPoint presentation. However, the key or the main purpose of storing information 
is to retrieve information when it is needed. Also information is meant to be reused, 
rejigged, and ported for various tangential and derivative needs.
6.4.4.3.3 
Knowledge
“Knowledge is power” is a popular aphorism derived from the Latin phrase 
scientiapotentia est. It is a powerful weapon to possess because it is a culmination 
of people’s experiences, ideas, thoughts, and insights. The result of all these factors 
transforms information into knowledge.
Knowledge is composed of the tacit experiences, ideas, insights, values, 
and judgments of individuals.
In the process, the knowledge tries to answer the “how” part of the information. How 
did the 54 incidents get raised? How are we offering 23 services to the customer? Figure 6-9 
illustrates the question asked for transforming information to knowledge.

The answers to these questions require excessive analytical skills, and sound analysis 
is made possible by the person doing it.
6.4.4.3.4 
Wisdom
Wisdom is the highest echelon in the knowledge management process. While data, 
information, and knowledge lie in the reactive quadrant, capturing, recording, and 
analyzing events, wisdom sits on the pro-active front, making decisions in tune with the 
process and organizational objectives.
The outcome of knowledge, which is the result of the analysis, is leveraged to make 
sound decisions. These decisions can potentially have a lasting impact on the services 
offered and the future of the company. Therefore, wisdom is placed in the top-most tier 
as it has the most potential to impact the service provider.
Wisdom creates value for the service provider organization and for the customer. 
Remember that services exist to create value. They create value by asking the most basic 
question: Why do we do what we do? By tackling the source and by keeping their sights 
on the targets, the wisdom of people helps organizations achieve their goals through 
informed decisions. This is depicted in Figure 6-10.

Instead of focusing on the incidents in the system, wisdom asks the question: Why 
are incidents getting raised in the system? By answering the question, organizations can 
find themselves in a good position for minimizing incidents.
6.4.4.4  Service Knowledge Management System
The service knowledge management system (SKMS) is the mother of all repositories. 
It is the superset of all other databases in the service provider organization, and these 
individual databases are needed to manage the lifecycle of services.
Figure 6-11 depicts the hierarchy or the structural components of the SKMS. It 
consists within itself, the configuration management system mainly. As mentioned 
earlier, the CMS consists of multiple configuration management databases. Apart from 
the illustrated databases, the SKMS also consists of:
	
1.	
Policy and process documents
	
2.	
Financial documents like budget and accounting
	
3.	
Service portfolio

Chapter 6 ■ Service Transition
149
This list is by no means comprehensive. Anything and everything that is related to 
the service provider organization pertaining to design, management, and delivery of IT 
services goes into the SKMS.
6.4.5  Transition Planning and Support
Transition planning and support (TPS) is a minor process in the service transition 
lifecycle phase and it exists to manage and control the other processes within the phase. 
It is similar to the design coordination process discussed in Chapter 5. Management roles 
such as transition manager are housed in this process.
6.4.5.1  Objectives of Transition Planning and Support
There are a number of processes within the service transition lifecycle, each looking at a 
different aspect of transitioning services into production. So there is a need for a single entity 
to overarch the processes and to ensure that they are aligned to the service design lifecycle 
phase and the overall objectives of the service provider organization. This requirement 
brings in the TPS process to manage the activities of the service transition phase.
The ITIL publication states that the purpose of the transition planning and support 
process is to provide overall planning for service transitions and to coordinate the 
resources that they require.

The objectives of TPS include:
• 
Support in planning and obtaining resources needed to transition 
service design plans and the strategies set forth by the service 
strategy lifecycle phase
• 
Ensure that the service operations phase has all the knowledge 
and support needed to manage services on status quo
• 
Coordinate between various suppliers, internal teams, and 
projects within the organization
• 
Transition services per the service design plans within the 
constraints of time, cost, scope, and quality
• 
Implement processes, technology, and management information 
system as envisioned by service strategy and as designed by 
service design
• 
Ensure that standard processes and policies are the norms for 
suppliers and internal teams to achieve the service provider’s and 
customer’s objectives
• 
Manage risks that arise during the service transition lifecycle phase
• 
Monitor the performance of transition activities and take 
improvement actions
6.4.5.2  Scope of Transition Planning and Support
All transitional activities come under the scope of transition planning and support 
process. To be specific:
• 
Manage service transition policies, processes, guidelines, and 
standards
• 
Ensure all the service transition activities adhere to the policies 
and processes set forth
• 
Manage conflicts as and when they arise
• 
Create budgets for the transitions in pipeline
• 
Ensure service transitions coordinate with project and program 
management activities to ensure service design and development 
is controlled
An organization may not work on a single service at any given point in time, so there 
is a need to manage multiple transitions with limited resources and time, which comes 
under the scope of TPS.

6.6  Summary
In this chapter, I discussed the service transition lifecycle phase and explained its 
objectives, scope, and the value it brings to the table. I also discussed the processes 
embedded within the service transition phase: change management process, release and 
deployment management process, service asset and configuration management process, 
knowledge management process, and transition planning and support.
In the next chapter, you will learn about the ITIL service operations lifecycle phase, 
which consists of five processes and four functions.

CHAPTER 7
Service Operations
Our business is about technology, yes. But it’s also about operations and 
customer relationships.
—Michael Dell
In the end, all business operations can be reduced to three words: people, 
product, and profits.
 —Lee Iacocca
They say that you need to put your money where your mouth is. For a service provider, 
most of the action takes place in the service operations lifecycle phase. The customer 
always tends to remember service operations over all other phases as his interactions 
mostly happen in this area. The service provider also bills the maximum amount of the 
total contract in the operations phase. Yet, this is not the best place to put your money, 
although the mouth is wide open. You will find out the reasons soon enough!
Service operations deals with maintaining services that have been implemented in 
the service transition phase. In this phase, no functional or nonfunctional modifications 
are performed to the service. A status quo is maintained, ensuring that the service runs as 
it was designed to. The service operations phase runs the longest in terms of timeline, is 
the biggest in terms of staff strength, and, most importantly, the customer generally forms 
a perception of the service provider through the operational phase achievements.
If the strategy is innovative, the design is sound, and the transition is perfect, then 
you can expect service operations to be less noisy and probably peaceful. In reality 
though, this never happens. Strategies are bound to change over time, designs have 
flaws, either manmade or limitations owing from technology, and transitions are rarely 
event free. Technological innovations and advancements bring in changes to IT services 
through the service design phase. These changes are implemented by the service 
transition phase, and the service operations phase must maintain them. For maintaining 
them, the resources utilized in this phase must be trained on the new technology. Plus, 
during the transition, and in the initial period, it is likely that the maintenance will 
become tricky due to new technology, and glitches are quite common in introductions. 
SLAs are not always met, customer satisfaction runs high and low, and human errors 
ensure that service operations managers have challenging times while they lead the 
operational activities.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
156
I have worked in service operations for a good portion of my career, and it is not 
something that I would like to focus my memory cells on. The usual run-of-the-mill day 
included taking calls on the fly, sleeping when the customer is sleeping, and juggling 
vacation plans in sync with peers. Now the good part. Service operations hires the most 
people in the IT service management industry. ITIL professionals have job security in the 
next decade or so, thanks to service operations, and I don’t see this changing. And most 
importantly, service operations brings about challenges that were previously unheard of. 
Service operations can often cause service architects much frustration in trying to find 
the root cause of new issues and problems. This phase has its ups and downs. It depends 
on how you accept it, and which part of your career you decide to jump into. The earlier 
the better.
7.1  Objectives of Service Operations
The service strategy phase has decided which IT services to offer, and there is a strategic 
direction in the decision. Based on the strategy, the service design phase prepares the 
blueprints and various designs for these services. The service transition phase uses these 
designs and builds the service. After developing it, these services are tested, piloted, and 
implemented in the production environment. After successful deployment, the service 
transition’s scope ceases and service operations takes over. The objective of the service 
operations phase is to maintain the services and to ensure that the services operate as 
they were designed to.
It is important to get a sound design for the services and then to implement them 
fully, complying to the designs. It is equally important that the service operations 
process be designed using rugged process principles and optimized to ensure that the 
service operations are optimally staffed (to keep costs in check) and are scalable. Note 
that service operations provides value to the customer, but not to the service. Service 
operations provides inputs and pointers for improving services and the problem 
management process (discussed later in this chapter), especially in looking at services 
holistically and minimizing incidents.
The list of objectives of service operations is rather short, although this is the longest 
running phase. They are:
• 
Deliver service operations effectively and efficiently as per the 
agreed terms
• 
Build and maintain business satisfaction in IT through delivery  
of services
• 
Minimize the impact to the business caused by an outage of services
• 
Optimize service costs and improve the quality of service
• 
Provide access to users (to servers, switches, applications, 
physical locations) who have received valid authorization

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
157
7.2  Scope of Service Operations
The scope of the service operations encompasses all things operational:
• 
All IT services that are delivered to customers come under the 
scope of service operations to maintain status quo (e.g., Internet 
service and telephony).
• 
The service operations phase has five processes and four 
functions under it. Apart from this most of the processes from 
other phases are triggered or have touch points with the service 
operations phase (e.g., capacity and change management).
• 
Technology drives IT services. It is imperative that the service 
operations phase involved in managing services will by default 
leverage the technology that is used (e.g., SaaS and cloud 
computing).
• 
No matter how far we have progressed technologically, we need 
people to manage, maintain, and fine tune the infrastructure and 
applications. Without people there is no service to the customer. 
The service operations phase hires and utilizes the maximum 
number of human resources across all other phases (e.g., people 
managing incidents and people managing data centers).
7.3  Value of Service Operations
For a customer, the most value is derived from the service operations phase, as it 
encompasses the maximum number of touch points between the customer and the 
service provider. All the customer’s deliveries are realized in the service operations phase. 
Therefore, it is imperative that service operations be given the utmost importance during 
its design, implementation, and execution.
Value for the customer can be quantified as:
• 
Reduce service downtime
• 
Reduce the frequency of interruptions
• 
Reduce labor wastage, which is a result of service outages
• 
Reduce unplanned costs by optimizing plans during outages and 
identifying root causes
• 
Provide service operational data to other processes for their 
consumption to identify improvement opportunities
• 
Provide service operational data for continual service 
improvement and recommending service improvements
• 
Provide inputs to other processes for automating operational 
activities

• 
Enact customer’s security policy by complying with all the  
policy controls
• 
Provide accesses to those (customers and IT) approved and 
deprive access to others
7.4  Communication in Service Operations
Communication plays an important role in the IT service management area, more so in 
the service operations phase. There are a number of interactions between the service 
provider, customer, and other parties in the service operations phase. Figure 7-1 illustrates 
the number of communication channels in a typical small setup and shows five key 
stakeholders who are involved in day-to-day communicational activities: customer, user, 
supplier, IT management, and IT staff. The number of communication channels is 5C2 = 10.
(5 C 2) = 5!/(2!*3!)
= (5*4*3*2*1)/(2*1*3*2*1)
= (5*4*3)/(3*2*1)
= 60/6 = 10

Figure 7-1.  Communication channels
This is a conservative figure. The number of communication channels increases 
as the number of teams involved and the users involved increases. The bottom line is 
that communication in service operations matters as it plays a major role in relaying 
information between stakeholders. So the service provider organization should take 
notice of the communication plans set forth and ensure there is standardization of 
communicational etiquettes, quality, and a common code for communication to ensure 
effective and efficient operations.
I have given the utmost priority to communication in all the projects that I have 
run and the services that I have delivered. All customer communications were planned 
much earlier, along with styles and templates to ensure that the customer experienced 
uniformity in all communication. Communication makes or breaks the service 
management-business relationship.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
159
You can refer to my first book, Communications for IT Professionals (Packt 
Publishing, 2015), which delves into the nitty gritty of communication platforms, 
channels that form an integral part of your work life. That book can help you develop 
your communication skills, and you will reap the benefits such as increased customer 
satisfaction, effective work delivery, and career advancement.
The different types of communication you can expect in service operations are:
• 
Routine operational communication, such as providing updates 
and confirming actions
• 
Communication regarding changes and releases
• 
Shift handovers
• 
Performance and service-level agreement (SLA) reports
• 
Presentations for training, performance showcasing, and 
initiatives
• 
Project-related communication
• 
Classroom and web-based trainings
• 
Scheduled meetings with customer and internal teams
7.5  Service Operations Processes
Service operations is the most popular and important phase, and the processes that are a 
part of it are most sought after. The five processes of service operations are:
	
1.	
Event management
	
2.	
Incident management
	
3.	
Request fulfillment management
	
4.	
Problem management
	
5.	
Access management
Incident and problem management processes are considered the major processes, 
while event, request fulfillment, and access management processes are minor in 
importance of service delivery.
7.5.1  Event Management
Event management is a minor process in the service operations lifecycle phase. But it is 
a process that can change the landscape of operations for the better, and it is a process 
that is the closest to the services delivered. This process provides the ability of being pro-
active to the service provider, and this, in my opinion, is invaluable. What is an event? The 
ITIL Service Operations publication gives this definition:
An event is any change of state that has significance for the management 
of a configuration item (CI) or IT service.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
160
You have services, and these services are made up of various components. You 
could have multiple types of events taking place for any of the services or components. 
Examples could be an administrator logging in to a core router. A service that stops 
working as it should is also an event. A hard drive that is almost full is considered an 
event. In short, anything that changes a service’s state is an event.
The event management process deals with the various nuances of 
events, and how each event correlates to further action or inaction from 
interfacing processes is the essence of it.
This process is primarily operated through the use of technology and managed by 
administrators who have experience in managing event management tools and toolsets. 
For example, there are monitoring tools that keep a pulse on services or components 
to ensure that they are working as they should. One such monitoring tool keeps 
pinging IT components like the router or servers at regular intervals. As per design, an 
acknowledgment ping should be received. If the monitoring tool does not receive an 
acknowledgment after three consecutive pings, it raises a warning alert (a notification 
that a threshold has been reached, something has changed, or a failure has occurred). 
Alerts are often created and managed by system management tools and are managed by 
the event management process, with appropriate teams in place to take urgent action. If, 
for example, there is no acknowledgment after a ping, the monitoring tool will raise an 
error alert that gets converted to an incident and the incident management process  
takes over.
7.5.1.1  Objectives of Event Management
Event management exists to keep track of all events occurring in the IT environment. 
The event may not necessarily be associated with failures or warnings, but can be 
informational in nature, such as an administrator logging in with a wrong password.
The process’s purpose is to track and manage all events in the lifecycle of a service. 
When events are detected, most events just go into the record but some will initiate 
follow-up actions to be carried out by various teams. The logic is built in the design of 
the event management to capture events that make sense and then take appropriate 
optimized follow-up actions.
The event management process comes into play in the operations phase of the 
service lifecycle. This is the phase that calls for real-time monitoring and on-the-fly 
actions. Any lapses in the services, even for a few minutes, could cost the customer 
big time with irrecoverable losses. So it is critical that event management is tuned to 
perfection to ensure that the pulse of the service is clearly heard and follow-up actions 
are unambiguously drafted and designed.
Automation of monitoring activities is one of the biggest features of event 
management. While monitoring in real time is automated, even the actions to undertake 
during warnings and exceptions are generally automated to ensure standardization 
of operational activities, quick turnaround, and to increase productivity. Technology, 
therefore, is the biggest ally in designing and implementing the event management process.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
161
The overall objectives of event management include:
• 
Detect all state changes of IT services and IT components (CIs) 
that are in scope
• 
Identify the complete flow of follow-up actions on the 
detected events, such as logging incidents and firing e-mails to 
stakeholders
• 
Act as an interface for other processes to trigger their operational 
activities
• 
Support the service-level management (SLM) process with figures 
and numbers required for computing the service-level agreement 
(SLA) achievement status
• 
Support the continual service improvement (CSI) phase with 
necessary data to suggest improvements to services and processes
7.5.1.2  Scope of Event Management
Event management comes into play when services, infrastructure, or applications are 
required to be monitored for change of status. The following come under the ambit of 
event management:
• 
When services are broken down, the constituent elements or the 
individual components that make up a service are configuration 
items. CIs are a classic case of event management in action. 
Not all CIs are brought under the process as controlling every 
single one of them is cumbersome and does not justify the cost 
associated with it. Generally, only the critical CIs are identified 
and brought in scope. An example would be a core switch for a 
datacenter or a server that hosts a banking web site.
• 
Service environment can come into the scope of the event 
management process as well. For example, a data center will have 
the air temperature and smoke detection automated to control 
the changes in the environment and to alert stakeholders if the 
situation goes awry.
• 
IT and physical security are in the priority list for all IT 
organizations. Any intrusions or virus attacks need to be dealt 
with quickly. This requires automation built into rugged layers of 
control.
• 
A typical IT organization owns thousands of licenses of various 
software that are needed to support and deliver services. Or 
it could just be the software licenses that customers use. To 
keep track of software licensing and compliance, the event 
management process can play a major role to avoid breaching 
contracts and to ensure that only the authorized versions are 
being used.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
162
• 
You don’t need event management when things go haywire. 
You need it when you have to find out the number of assets an 
organization owns or to get regular data on various parameters of 
a service.
7.5.1.3  Types of Events
All events are not the same. Events are broadly categorized under different types, as 
presented in the sections that follow.
7.5.1.3.1 
Exception Events
These events signify errors. They are classified in the top-most tier and normally require 
immediate attention. Examples are:
• 
Server is unreachable
• 
Hard disk space has exceeded the threshold limits
• 
Administrator has tried to log in with an incorrect password
• 
PC scan reveals malware
7.5.1.3.2 
Warning Events
These events exist to warn about an impending exception. They throw out a warning 
stating that things will soon take a wrong turn if not dealt with quickly. They are 
important, because they help an IT organization be pro-active and to prevent exceptions. 
Examples include:
• 
Memory usage is hovering close to the acceptable threshold
• 
Turnaround time for a certain transaction is not within the 
optimized limits
• 
Temperature in the datacenter is not at the ideal level
7.5.1.3.3 
Informational Events
These events convey information, and I am not talking about information pertaining to 
errors or warnings, but rather general information. These events do not call for urgent 
action from IT staff and are generally recorded for compliance and audit purposes. 
Examples include:
• 
User has logged in to a server
• 
New folder created on a sharepoint drive
• 
Hardware technician has entered the datacenter

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
163
7.5.2  Incident Management
Incident management is the most popular ITIL process, from the perspective of the 
number of jobs the process creates. Quite naturally, most ITIL professionals are aware of 
the principles that the process lives by.
In addition, the process runs the longest, and with maximum touch points with 
various stakeholders in the service lifecycle. The incident management process is 
primarily responsible for the customer satisfaction and the agility with which service 
interruptions are handled.
I have worked a number of years in the incident management process area, some as 
an incident manager and mostly as the incident management process owner. The process 
is lively and you always end up learning something new every time a new situation comes 
up. You cannot get bored with the process, as every situation is different, and even in two 
similar situations, the potential responses could vary. It is also the process that has kept 
me up all night on certain days and has kept the senior management of the customer 
organization at the edge of their seats throughout.
If you need to be exact about the incident management process, you can state that it is 
a reactive process with no pro-active side to it. And I would agree. It reacts to situations, and 
its efficiency depends on how quickly and efficiently the service outage is managed. The 
customer does not get upset if there are service outages, but the customer would definitely 
employ some disgruntled tactics when the restoration goes beyond the expectations set. I 
will discuss service interruptions and the expectations surrounding them in the next section.
7.5.2.1  What Is an Incident?
You are quite well aware what a service is at this junction. If a service such as e-mail, 
Internet, or voicemail faces an outage, if the end users cannot use the IT services, this 
situation is referred to as an incident. The ITIL service operations publication defines an 
incident in this way:
An incident is an unplanned interruption to an IT service or reduction in 
the quality of an IT service or a failure of a CI that has not yet impacted 
an IT service (for example, failure of one disk from a mirror set).
The IT service that the customer uses or enjoys comes with certain specifications 
and parameters. A classic example could be that Internet service will be available at 
100MBps speed with certain ping rates.
• 
Let’s say that the Internet stops working. Then an incident is 
required to be raised.
• 
Let’s say the speed of the Internet drops to 55MBps, then there is 
degradation in the quality of service, so an incident is required to 
be raised.
• 
Let’s say that the Internet is being offered through a specific router 
that has an automatic failover mechanism in place, and if one of 
the routers fail but does not cause an interruption to the service, 
an incident is still required to be raised.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
164
The examples above help you disseminate the definition of an incident as specified 
in the ITIL publication.
An incident is raised when:
• 
There is an interruption to the IT service
• 
The quality of the IT service is degraded
• 
A component that supports delivering a service fails, even though 
there is no impact to the IT service
If you can get a handle on the triggers for an incident, consider yourself on a 
good footing for getting a solid grip on the incident management process and the job 
opportunities that come calling.
7.5.2.2  Objectives of Incident Management
Incident management exists to fight fires in the service disruptors and to ensure that 
these disruptions are managed. Its purpose is to ensure that the services are restored as 
quickly as possible and to ensure that the service outage causes minimal damage to the 
business. Plus, the incident management process is tasked with ensuring that relevant 
service levels are upheld and the quality of service is maintained.
Let’s say a printer is not working, then the printing service for the affected user is 
disrupted. In this example, the main objective of the incident management process is 
to ensure that the service becomes operational as soon as possible, whether it entails 
repairing the printer, replacing the printer, or routing the print queue to another printer 
in the vicinity, which is decided by the process during the course of resolution. The 
point to note is that the restoration of the service has to happen as quickly as it can be 
practically done.
The other objectives of the incident management process are:
• 
Follow a common process and procedure to ensure that 
restoration is efficient and response is prompt
• 
Ensure there is full transparency and visibility of incidents to the 
business and the internal IT staff
• 
Restore services professionally to enhance the business’s 
perception of the service provider
• 
Design incident priorities and related activities in alignment with 
the business
• 
Maintain good customer satisfaction (CSAT) for the restoration 
and related activities

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
165
7.5.2.3  Scope of Incident Management
All services that are offered to customers come under the scope of the incident 
management process, including the enhancing and enabling services.
The scope of the incident management process can be better explained through the 
following:
• 
Disruptions to services reported by users by calling the service 
desk or using a web form to report it or other acceptable means 
such as chat, e-mail, and so forth
• 
Disruptions to services reported by IT staff
• 
Failure of CIs reported by IT staff that haven’t disrupted the 
service (due to redundancy)
• 
Failure of CIs reported by event management tools
• 
Threshold breach of CIs reported by event management tools
• 
Anomalies detected by IT staff or potential incident cases (such as 
the hard drive filling up on a storage server)
7.5.2.4  Incident Prioritization
Consider a real-life scenario of a company that employs 100,000 employees and there 
is a support team which of about 100 technicians. At any given time, around 1% of the 
employees raise incidents for issues faced by them—1,000 tickets. So you have 100 IT staff 
to handle 1,000 incidents. They cannot handle them all at the same time. They need to 
pick and choose which ones to work on first and follow up with the rest. How do they pick 
and choose? The answer is in prioritization of incidents.
Not all incidents carry the same weight in terms of their impact and urgency. Some 
are more urgent, some cause more impact than others, some may not be urgent, and 
some are neither grossly affecting nor urgent.
To state some examples:
• 
Finance application at the end of the month will cause a major 
impact and it needs to be fixed urgently
• 
Finance application in the middle of a month will cause major 
impact but it may not be urgent
• 
The PDF viewer not displaying in the right format for a single user 
is low impact and not urgent
• 
Network connectivity for an entire floor of business users causes a 
great impact and is urgent
• 
The e-mail application not working for a VIP user is low impact 
but is very high on the urgency list

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
166
Incident priority therefore can be determined based on impact and urgency:
Incident Priority = Impact × Urgency
Impact refers to the business impact, which is definitely a factor that drives the 
incident priority. Business impact normally refers to the following:
• 
Financial losses
• 
Productivity losses
• 
Loss of reputation
• 
Regulatory or legislative breaches
Urgency is a measure of how quickly or how swiftly the incident needs to be resolved. 
It may demand a majority of the staff be dedicated to a particular incident immediately or 
indicate resolution when IT resources become available.
To determine the priority of an incident, let’s imagine a 3×3 matrix for deriving the 
incident priority based on impact and urgency, as shown in Figure 7-2.
As per the matrix, a high impact and a high urgency incident would be classified 
as priority 1. A medium impact and urgency incident is prioritized as 2, and so on. The 
matrix shown here is too simple to be used in the real world. There are far too many 
permutations and combinations to consider in rating the priority of an incident, but the 
principle is the same.
Response SLA is the target set for technicians to respond to incidents, say by 
acknowledging and accepting the incident in their respective queues. For example, an 
incident was logged at 10 A.M. and the defined response SLA is 30 minutes. In this case, 
the technician is expected to accept the incident before 10:30 A.M.
Resolution SLA is the target set for technicians to resolve incidents. For example, an 
incident was logged at 10 A.M. and the defined resolution SLA is one hour. In this case, 
the technician is expected to resolve the incident before 11 A.M.
Now that we have the priorities considered and determined, each of the priorities 
comes with its own set of response and resolution SLAs. These SLAs are drawn during the

Figure 7-3.  Response and resolution SLAs for incidents
In the example, the highest priority, P1, has a response SLA of 15 minutes and 
resolution SLA of two hours. This requires the technical team to acknowledge the 
incident within 15 minutes (start working on the resolution) and the P1 incident is 
required to be resolved before two hours. Say, for example, a very sensitive banking 
application that allows foreign exchanges to transact is down. This outage will cost the 
bank a significant amount of financial loss and the bank will lose customer perception. 
Also, it could face the government’s wrath as well owing to regulatory norms. To ensure 
that such a scenario is contained, a P1 priority with stringent timelines will allow the 
maximum resources to be allocated at the earliest possible time to resolve the incident.
Incident priorities and parameters for setting the priority are different for every 
customer. The service provider is expected to adhere to the requirements put forth by 
the customer and charge them accordingly based on the number of resources and assets 
utilized in fulfilling the service obligations.
7.5.2.5  Major Incidents
Major incidents, as the name suggests, are severely impacting incidents that have the 
potential to cause irreparable damage to the business. So the ITIL service management 
suggests that major incidents be dealt with through a different lens. This can be done 
by having a separate process, a more stringent one of course, with stricter timelines 
and multiple lines of communication. Many organizations institute a separate team to 
look into major incidents and hire those with specialized skill sets to be exposed to the 
pressure that this job inherits.
The people who work solely on major incidents are called major incident managers. 
They have all the privileged powers to mobilize teams and summon management 
representatives at any time of the day (or night). They run the show when there is a major 
incident and become completely accountable for the resolution of the incident. The 
pressure on them is immense, and it calls for nerves of steel to withstand the pressure 
from the customer, service provider senior management, and all other interested parties.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
168
I once worked as a major incident manager and was heading a major incident 
management team not too long ago. The job entailed keeping the boat floating at all 
times, and any delays from my end could potentially jeopardize the lives of miners across 
the globe. During a major incident, there could have been two or three phones buzzing 
with action, e-mails flying daggers into my inbox, and chat boxes flashing and roaring. It 
is a good experience when you think about it in hindsight and a time I will cherish.
In a typical organization, you will have the service desk working on low-priority 
incident resolution. I will discuss the service desk later in this chapter. To track, manage, 
and chase incident-related activities, there are incident managers who keep tabs on 
all occurrences. When a major incident hits the queue, none of these groups take 
responsibility, but they call in the experts (major incident managers) to manage the 
situation. In some cases, the service desk and incident managers might validate the 
incident priority before calling the major incident line.
It is a good practice to let the whole service provider team and the customer 
organization know that a major incident is in progress to make sure that everybody knows 
that certain services are down and to avoid users calling the service desk to report on 
the same incident. A few good practices in this regard include sending out e-mails at the 
start and end of major incidents, flashing messages on office portals and on ticket logging 
pages, and playing an interactive voice response (IVR) message when users call the 
service desk.
7.5.2.6  Incident Management Lifecycle
An example of a generic incident management lifecycle is shown in Figure 7-4. 
Remember that the objective of the incident management process is to resolve incidents 
as soon as possible, and this process helps to make it happen. You can come up with 
your own process to achieve the goal. The steps shown in the ITIL publication provide 
guidance on how to indicate the typical incident management process.

In the incident management process lifecycle, there are seven steps to achieve the 
objective. I will explain each of the steps in the sections that follow.
7.5.2.6.1 
Step 1: Incident Identification
There needs to be a mechanism to identify incidents, they don’t show up at the doorstep 
by themselves. Incident identification or triggering of incidents can happen in a number 
of ways. Remember that a process gets kick started when they are fueled by the identified 
triggers. It is important that all the triggers are identified during the process definition 
stage. The more the merrier, but controlling all the known triggers requires plenty of 
effort and could lead to misidentification of incidents if they are not curtailed. The most 
commonly used incident management triggers are:
• 
Event management: In the event management process, I 
discussed the output of the process triggering the incident 
management process. For example, a server that goes down 
raises an exception with an event management tool. The tool 
is configured to translate the exception into an incident ticket 
on the ITSM ticketing tool such as ServiceNow, CA IT Service 
Management, and BMC Remedy.
• 
Telephone: One of the oldest forms of raising complaints is to pick 
up the phone and complain about a broken down service. To raise 
an incident, users have the option of calling the service desk. The 
trigger in this case is the phone call by the users. It is also possible 
that IT staff could find a fault in one of the systems and call the 
service desk.
• 
E-mail/chat: Instead of calling in, users can opt for a passive form 
of communication through e-mail or real-time chat. They would 
still be interacting with the service desk and getting them to raise 
an incident on their behalf.
• 
Web interface: In today’s world of cutbacks, the service desk is 
often replaced by self-help mechanisms. ITSM ticketing tools 
provide the front end for users to raise their own tickets without 
the aid of the service desk. In a way, it is good that precious 
resources can be used elsewhere. But it could also lead to a good 
amount of misidentified incidents that could add to the flab that 
you don’t like to see.
7.5.2.6.2 
Step 2: Incident Logging
All incidents that are identified should be logged, with a timestamp that is unalterable. 
Incidents are generally logged directly into the tool by the user if there is a web interface. 
And the event management tools can also create incidents based on the threshold levels 
and the designed algorithms. The service desk raises incidents on behalf of end users 
when they call, e-mail, or chat about their issues.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
171
An incident ticket has a number of fields associated with it, primarily to support 
the resolution of the incident and to control the various parameters and pull reports as 
necessary. Some common fields that are found on incident tickets are:
• 
Incident number (unique)
• 
End user name
• 
End user team name
• 
Incident logger name
• 
Time of logging the incident
• 
Incident medium (phone/chat/web/e-mail)
• 
Impact
• 
Urgency
• 
Priority
• 
Category
• 
Related CI
• 
Incident summary
• 
Incident description
• 
Assigned resolver group
• 
Assigned engineer
• 
Status
• 
Resolution code
• 
Time of resolution/closure
7.5.2.6.3 
Step 3: Incident Categorization
Not all incidents fall into the same bucket. Some incidents are server based, some 
network, and some application/software. It is very important to identify which bucket 
the incident falls under, as the incident categories determine which resolver group gets 
assigned to resolve it.
For example, if there is an incident logged for the loss of Internet, you need the 
network team in charge of handling network issues to work on it. If this incident gets 
categorized incorrectly, say applications, the incident will be assigned to a resolver group 
that specializes in software troubleshooting and code fixes. They will not be able to 
resolve the incident. They are required to recategorize and assign it to the right group. But 
the effect of wrong categorization is that the resolution takes longer and this defeats the 
purpose of the incident management process. So it is absolutely imperative that the team 
that is logging the incident is specialized in identifying the incident types and categorize 
them correctly.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
172
In cases of autologged incidents, event management tools are designed to select 
a predetermined category that does not falter. User-raised incidents are automatically 
categorized based on the keywords mentioned in the incident summary and description. 
It is quite possible that the incident could be categorized incorrectly in this scenario, but 
in the interests of automation, this is the price we have to pay.
7.5.2.6.4 
Step 4: Incident Prioritization
Earlier I discussed extensively incident prioritization. This is the step where the process of 
incident prioritization gets acted upon.
The service desk measures the urgency and impact and sets the incident priority. 
Event management tools have the ability to set the right priority based on an algorithm. 
User-created incidents are normally assigned a default priority, and the resolver group 
changes the priority once it begins resolving the incident.
Incident priorities are not set in stone. They can be changed throughout the lifecycle 
of an incident. It is possible that the end user has hyped the impact of the incident and 
could have gotten a higher priority incident raised. During the resolution process, the 
resolver group validates the impact and urgency and alters the priority as needed. Some 
critical incidents are monitored after resolution. The observation period could see the 
priority pushed down until closure.
7.5.2.6.5 
Step 5: Diagnosis and Investigation
The service desk performs the initial diagnosis of an incident by understanding the 
symptoms of the incident. The service desk tries to understand exactly what is not 
working and then tries to take the user through some basic troubleshooting steps to 
resolve the incident. This is a key substep, as it provides the necessary data points for 
further investigation on the incident. It is analogous to a doctor asking you about the 
symptoms you have: Do you have throat pain? Do you have a cough? Do you have a cold? 
Do you have a headache? You get the drift. Likewise, the service desk is expected to ask a 
series of questions to provide the necessary information to resolve the incident quickly, 
which is the objective of the incident management process.
Not all incidents can be resolved by the service desk. They get functionally escalated 
to the next level of support, generally referred to as level 2, or L2. The L2 group is normally 
a part of an expert group, such as the server group, network group, storage group, or 
software group.
The resolver group diagnoses the incident with the available information, and if 
needed, calls the user to obtain more information. It is possible that the service desk’s 
line of questioning could be on the wrong path, and perhaps the resolver group must start 
all over again by asking the right set of questions.
Investigation of the incident digs deeper into the incident by understanding one or 
more of the following thought processes:
• 
What is the user expecting to obtain through the incident?
• 
What has gone wrong?
• 
What are the sequence of steps that led to the incident?

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
173
• 
Who is impacted? Is it localized or global?
• 
Were there changes performed in the environment that might 
have upset the system?
• 
Are there any similar incidents logged previously? Are there any 
KEDB articles available to assist?
7.5.2.6.6 
Step 6: Resolution and Recovery
Based on the investigation, resolutions can be applied. For example, if the resolver 
group determines that a particular incident is not localized, there is no reason for it to 
resolve the incidents on the user’s PC, but rather it starts troubleshooting in the server or 
network. Or perhaps it brings in the experts who deal with global issues.
The success of resolution rides on the right path of investigation. If the doctor you 
are seeing prescribes the wrong medicines as the line of investigation was completely way 
off, the chances of recovery are close to nil, isn’t it?
For incidents that are widespread in nature (affecting multiple users), once the 
resolution is applied, various tests have to be conducted by the resolver group to be 
absolutely sure that the incident has been resolved, and there is generally a recovery 
period to observe the incident and be on the lookout if anything were to go wrong again. 
In some of the accounts that I have handled in major incident management, it was a 
regular practice to keep major incidents open for at least a week, to observe, and to hold 
daily/hourly meetings with stakeholders to check the pulse and to keep tabs on things 
that could go wayward.
7.5.2.6.7 
Step 7: Incident Closure
When an incident is resolved, it is normal practice to confirm with the user before closing 
the incident ticket. The confirmation is generally made by the service desk, not the 
resolver group. So the process for postresolution of an incident is that the incident gets 
assigned to the service desk for confirmation and closure of the incident.
Some organizations feel that this step adds too much overhead to the service desk 
and prefer to forgo this confirmation. They keep the incident in resolved status for 
maybe three days. An e-mail is shot out to the user informing him that the incident has 
been resolved, and if he feels otherwise, he is expected to inform back or to reopen the 
incident. If there is no response within three days, the incident would be autoclosed. I like 
doing this and have been a proponent of the autoclosure system as confirmation can be 
overbearing, and, from a user’s standpoint, irritating to the customer to receive calls just 
to ask for confirmation.
After an incident has been closed, a user satisfaction survey goes out asking for 
feedback on the timeliness of the resolution, the ease of logging incidents, and whether 
the user was kept informed of the incident status throughout the lifecycle.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
174
7.5.2.14  Incident Models
Not all the incidents logged are new. Most would have occurred in the past and resolved 
successfully through a series of steps. In the interests of resolving known incidents quickly, 
organizations can create standard incident models that help in quick resolution of 
incidents. These models contain all the steps that are to be taken to resolve the incident.
For example, if you have an incident that involves a particular supplier, to quicken 
the resolution, the incident would be predetermined with steps such as:
Step 1: Log the incident ticket on the ITSM tool
Step 2: Send an e-mail to the supplier with the details of the 
incident
Step 3: When the incident is resolved, the supplier will 
respond back with an e-mail giving the details of the 
resolution
Step 4: Update the resolution details and close the incident ticket
Step 5: Call user and confirm resolution
For such models, the service desk could be used to run the predetermined steps and 
resolve incidents without intervention of the L2 or L3 support groups.
The ITIL publication has defined an incident model as a way of predefining the 
steps that should be taken to handle a process (in this case a process for dealing with a 
particular type of incident) in an agreed way.
The following set of steps are generally included in an incident model:
	
1.	
Steps to manage an incident
	
2.	
Parties responsible for carrying out the resolution steps
	
3.	
Chronological order of the steps
	
4.	
Activities that are to be performed before resolution using the 
incident model steps (such as turning on the safe mode and 
disconnecting from the Internet)
	
5.	
Timelines for completion of activities
	
6.	
Escalation matrices
	
7.	
Instruction to save certain artifacts (reports, screenshots, etc.)
7.5.2.15  Incident Statuses
During its lifecycle, an incident is bound to have several statuses just as we go through 
various stages of our lives (infant, kid, youth, adult, middle age and old age).

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
175
An incident typically goes through the following stages of its lifecycle, called the 
statuses:
Open ➤ Work in Progress ➤ Pending (If Needed) ➤ Resolved ➤ Closure
• 
Open: When an incident is logged, it goes into the open status. 
It generally remains in this state until the resolver group or the 
service desk takes ownership toward resolving the incident.
• 
Work in progress: When the resolver group starts diagnosing, 
investigating, and resolving the incident, the incident status gets 
changed to work in progress.
• 
Pending: This is not a mandatory status for an incident. However, 
some incidents may have to be placed in pending (or hold) status 
as the resolver group may be seeking additional information from 
the user or waiting for a change to be implemented to resolve the 
incident. In such cases, to indicate that the incident is not being 
worked on and to indicate dependencies, it is placed in pending 
status.
• 
Resolved: When the resolution is applied to an incident, the 
resolver group places the incident on resolved status. It is the 
prerogative of the resolver group to ascertain that the incident is 
resolved and to move the status appropriately.
• 
Closure: Moving the incident status to closure status generally 
requires the concurrence of the user who has raised it. As 
mentioned earlier, in some cases, incidents get automatically 
moved from resolution to closure after a certain number of days.
Setting the right incident status is important from the transparency and reporting 
standpoints. Incidents with the right statuses provide an accurate dashboard of how 
many incidents in the system are in the open, work in progress, pending, resolved, and 
closure stages. This helps in setting the right expectations and to take corrective actions if 
necessary.
Changing the incident statuses as and when activities are performed helps the 
management understand the resolution speeds and the kinks in the process. For 
example, if the majority of incidents are placed on pending status, awaiting the user 
to provide more information to aid in incident resolution, then perhaps there is a 
shortcoming in the way information is sought during the incident logging process.
7.5.3  Request Fulfillment Process
Incident management process exists to ensure that the service outages and degradation 
of services are dealt with on a timely basis and to bring the services back to normal. In the 
IT world, there is more than just the outages and degradations. This is where the request 
fulfillment management process comes in. It is a minor process that caters to various 
demands of the users and plays an important role in the delivery of IT services.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
176
7.5.3.1  What Is a Service Request?
Service requests, as the name suggests, are requests from the users, on various aspects of 
the services. They are neither incidents nor change requests, but rather are characterized 
by nonimpacting, low cost, frequently occurring, and low risk. Examples of service 
requests include mailbox creation, software installation, printer replacement, new phone 
line installation, seeking information, and requesting a wireless mouse. In the examples 
provided above, they orient toward getting something new, having something modified, 
or removal of services. This is the essence of service requests. They are based on adding 
on (or modifying) various aspects of a service or enabling new services.
7.5.3.1.1 
Service Requests vs. Incidents
Understanding the differentiating factors between incidents and service requests is 
crucial. Incidents are raised on the back of a service interruption, degraded service, or 
to prevent potential interruption/degradation. The services already exist in the user’s 
ecosystem, and abnormality to it leads to an incident. Service requests are raised to 
obtain new services, to modify existing services, or to discontinue services. In short, there 
is a gulf between incidents and service requests.
Many organizations do not differentiate between service requests and incidents 
and treat both of them as incidents. This approach is not recommended. For starters, by 
putting incidents and service requests in the same bucket, the technician or the service 
desk is expected to resolve the service request during the same timeline as an incident. 
Remember that an incident is caused due to an outage or degradation of a service. 
And a service request is an add-on to existing services or a request for a new service. 
In principle, this should not be urgent. If incidents and service requests are bunched 
together, there is a fair possibility of service requests being resolved before incidents, 
thereby leading to prolonging loss of services to users, which defeats the purpose of 
incident management process and fails the service provider organization in its efforts to 
provide effective and efficient IT services.
It is highly recommended to keep incidents and service requests separate, and 
possibly handled by separate resolver teams. This will provide the right focus and ensure 
that incidents are prioritized over service requests. You should also know that service 
requests come with their own set of priority matrices, SLAs, OLAs, and KPIs. So the urgent 
service requests, such as creation of a mailbox, get fulfilled earlier than a service request 
raised for getting an additional LAN cable.
7.5.3.1.2 
Service Requests vs. Standard Changes
Under the pretext of service requests, we are actually making tiny low-risk changes to 
the services. For example, adding a new mailbox requires a new entry to be made on 
the mailbox platform, and this can be seen as a change. From the change management 
perspective, it probably comes under the ambit of standard changes, as the changes 
we are foreseeing are low risk and low impact in nature. In effect, service requests are 
efficient replacements for the standard changes as the service requests are raised by users 
and fulfilled either by the service desk or resolver groups.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
177
There is no specific line drawn in ITIL publications as to what constitutes a service 
request and what is a standard change. The practice in the IT industry is that any changes 
to services that involve users directly are under the service request umbrella, and the 
changes performed on the central infrastructure and software are handled within the 
scope of change management process as standard changes.
7.5.3.1.3 
Service Requests and Service Catalog
In Chapter 5 I discussed the service catalog management process. This process gave 
insight into the world of services and the offerings from which customers could pick and 
choose. In a similar vein, there is a catalog of services that users can request from. All the 
service requests must be preconceived and put into this user-facing service catalog. This 
is a huge exercise for the service provider to undertake, and developing an accurate and 
complete service catalog takes a lot of effort, discipline, and good understanding of the 
customer and his business activities.
7.5.3.2  Objectives of Request Fulfillment Management
The prime objective of the request fulfillment management process is to ensure that 
service requests from the user community are fulfilled within the stipulated timelines. 
This is a minor process in the service operations lifecycle phase. The other objectives are:
• 
Make the user aware of the provisions of the service catalog and 
the process for requesting services
• 
Ensure that a list of service requests exists and is made available 
to users
• 
Efficiently and effectively handle all service requests to maintain 
customer satisfaction levels for the service request area
• 
Source (obtain from necessary suppliers or other entities) and 
deliver the service request components such as software licenses
• 
Provide support in taking complaints, compliments, and 
providing general information to the user community
7.5.3.3  Scope of Request Fulfillment Management
The scope of service requests is subjective in nature. You cannot put a finger on a 
boundary and name them as service requests. I made a point earlier stating that service 
requests are a subset of standard changes, so it is fair for organizations to place service 
requests under the change management umbrella. Not-so-mature organizations group 
service requests with the incidents, as discussed earlier. To summarize, the scope is to be 
deduced by the service provider organization on what will constitute service requests and 
how they will be handled.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
178
Most mature organizations publish a service catalog, and users can only raise service 
requests that are listed in this catalog. Any additions or subtractions to this catalog will 
go through a separate channel and generally involve the change management process. 
All the items in the catalog are then broken down based on the activities that need to be 
performed to fulfill the service requests.
For example, a service request for ordering a new wireless mouse will proceed with 
the following activities:
Step 1: Approval from supervisor
Step 2: Approval from financial approver
Step 3: Store supervisor to check for availability in stores
Step 4: Source wireless mouse from stores if available, or else 
procure from designated vendor
Step 5: Deliver wireless mouse to user
Step 6: Obtain confirmation
Such work instructions are generally documented for every service request. They 
are stored in the service knowledge management system (SKMS). Some organizations 
make it more efficient by automating the approval process in the ITSM ticketing tool and 
integrating the service requests with the hardware/software asset database for sourcing 
options. This saves time and avoids delays pertaining to placing orders.
7.5.4  Problem Management
Problem management is the only other major process in the ITIL service operations 
phase. As the name suggests, it deals with problems. I will get to the crux of problems and 
other related terms in the next few sections. However, the way I represent the problem 
management process is as the investigation unit of the IT service provider organization. 
You might have seen the popular crime scene investigation television series, where 
crimes are solved by following the clues and lead to solving the crime committed. I had 
written an article in a popular training portal describing how problem management 
is the crime scene investigation of IT service management, and since then, many ITIL 
practitioners and students have used the terms interchangeably. I have received many 
comments commending my parallel observations.
In the IT world, there are problems. Say, for example, a bug in an application crashes 
it every time users try to access particular functions. The resolution of this problem is not 
simple. There is a workaround available, so this bug does not bring down the customer 
organization. But it needs to be fixed. So an investigation into the problem needs to be 
launched and software validation and compilation logs must be examined in detail. 
Tens of thousands of lines of codes must be analyzed, and the bug must be identified. 
After identifying the cause, a solution needs to be developed and implemented. All of 
these activities are done under the auspices of problem management. In short, problem 
management deals with identifying the smoking gun and finding a permanent fix.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
179
7.5.4.1  What Is a Problem?
The ITIL service operations publication offers the following definition of a problem:
A problem is the underlying cause of one or more incidents.
In simple terms, there are incidents where the fix is yet to be found. The resolution 
of these incidents is not possible as the root cause of the incident is unknown. This is 
similar to a doctor prescribing medicines; if he does not know what the cause of certain 
symptoms are, he will not be on a strong footing to prescribe medicines. Likewise, 
to resolve incidents, the technical resolver groups must know the root cause of the 
problems. If they do not know the root cause, they start to shoot in the dark by asking 
users to restart machines, uninstall and reinstall software, and do other needless activities 
that most often amount to a waste of time and resources. But if the principles of problem 
management were to be applied and the root cause identified, the solution would follow 
as a matter of routine.
A problem gets raised when the root cause of an incident is unknown. Or a bunch of 
incidents with a common thread are unable to be resolved as the underlying root cause is 
yet to be identified.
7.5.4.1.1 
Incidents vs. Problems
It is my experience that many IT professionals in the IT service management industry 
use the terms incident and problem interchangeably. This does more harm than good, 
especially if you are working in an organization that takes shape after ITIL, and especially 
if you are preparing for the ITIL Foundation exam. In this section, I will differentiate 
the two terms with examples, so as you move forward toward the process and other 
key terminology, there shouldn’t be any doubt in the difference between incidents and 
problems.
Incidents are raised due to loss or degradation of services. They are raised by users, 
IT staff, or event management tools. When incident resolution is not possible, as the 
underlying root cause is unknown, the IT team will raise a problem.
In some instances, IT staff may resolve incidents without understanding the root 
cause. In such cases, a problem ticket is raised as well. For example, as a resolution step, 
the server is rebooted, and the incident gets resolved. However, the underlying cause of 
why the incident happened in the first place will remain a conundrum.
Remember that users and event management tools don’t raise problems, but 
generally speaking, they can only come through the incident. Although, in a mature IT 
environment, you can configure event management tools to look for specific patterns of 
events and subsequently raise problems on the back of them. But, let’s keep this discussion 
out of the scope and restrict problems to be derived only on the back of incidents.
Let’s consider the example of a software application that crashes when it is initiated. 
The user raises an incident to fix this issue. The software resolution team tries to start 
the application in safe mode, uninstall and reinstall the application, and finally make 
changes to the operating system registry, but to no avail. When all hopes fail, they provide 
a heads-up to the problem management process to find the root cause and provide a 
permanent solution.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
180
The problem management process, aided by experts in the software architecture 
group, debug the application, loading and running a series of tests to find the triggers that 
sparked the crash. They find out that the root cause of the crash was due to a conflict with 
a hardware device driver. They recommend a solution to uninstall the hardware device 
driver and update it with the latest driver. The recommendation works like a charm and 
the software application that used to crash now loads nicely without any fuss. This is the 
problem management process in action, working on iron-legged problems that can cause 
irreparable damage to the customer’s organization if not dealt with on a timely basis.
7.5.4.2  Objectives of Problem Management
Problem management exists to reduce the number of incidents in the systems and to 
alleviate the client organization of losses that might occur through outages. Further, the 
process aims to reduce the impact caused by incidents that are generally an outcome 
of underlying errors in the IT ecosystem. The purpose of the process is to ensure that 
problems are managed across its lifecycle, starting from problem logging, followed by 
prioritization, categorization, investigation, resolution, and closure.
The objectives of the problem management process are:
	
1.	
Reduce recurring incidents
	
2.	
Prevent incidents that are caused through identified problems
	
3.	
In cases were incidents cannot be prevented, the process aims 
at reducing the impact of such incidents
7.5.4.3  Scope of Problem Management
The problem management process can be called into play in the service operations 
phase, generally with respect to incidents, as incidents are the first reported outage 
for services. Problem management can come in two flavors. It can react to incidents, 
and the incident facts and logs are used to investigate the underlying root cause. This 
is called reactive problem management. Or the process could be used pro-actively to 
preempt future incidents and identify and implement a solution. Recurring incidents 
are normally brought under the hammer to identify the common underlying root cause 
and solve it permanently and to avoid future incidents. This is called pro-active problem 
management.
The scope of problem management extends to:
• 
Resolution of problems caused by incidents
• 
Prevention of incident recurrences
• 
Reviewing major incidents to identify an underlying cause
• 
Analyzing event management logs to identify an underlying cause

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
181
7.5.4.4  Key Terminology Used in Problem Management
Problem management digs deep and the process brings a certain amount of complexity 
to the table. The complexity begins with a few terms that are used quite often during 
various stages of the process activities. It is key that you understand all the terminology 
discussed here. This will help you to use the correct terms at work and most definitely will 
bag you a few more right answers on the ITIL Foundation exam.
7.5.4.4.1 
Root Cause
The root cause is the fundamental reason for the occurrence of an incident or a problem. 
Let’s say you are in a bank and the ATM does not disburse the money you requested. The 
underlying cause, or the root cause, for the denial of service in this instance is attributed 
to a network failure in the bank. Likewise, for every incident there will be a root cause.
Only when you identify the root cause will you be able to resolve the incident. In 
the ATM instance, unless you know of the network failure, you cannot bring the ATM 
service back up. As discussed earlier, in some instances incidents can be resolved without 
knowing the root cause. However, to understand the root cause and eliminate the 
underlying cause, problem management must be brought in.
7.5.4.4.2 
Root Cause Analysis
Identifying the root cause of an incident is no menial task. At times, the root cause may 
reveal itself, but many times it will become challenging to identify the root causes of 
complex incidents. You are required to analyze the root cause by using techniques that 
commonly fall under the activity of root cause analysis (RCA).
Remember that the outcome of RCA may not always result in finding the root cause 
of an incident. In such cases, RCA must be performed using complex techniques and with 
experts pertaining to related fields of technology and management.
7.5.4.4.3 
Known Error
When the outcome of the RCA procedure yields results, the root cause becomes known. 
But it may not always be possible to implement a permanent solution. Instead, temporary 
fixes called workarounds are identified. Such cases where the root causes are known 
workarounds are found are called known errors.
There could be various reasons why solutions cannot be implemented. Commonly, 
permanent solutions come with a high price tag. Most organizations are price conscious 
these days and may not approve excess expenditures. Other reasons could include a 
lack of experts or people resources to implement the permanent solution or could cite 
governance or legislation controls that could prevent them from being implemented.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
182
7.5.4.4.4 
Known Error Database
Known errors are documented and are stored in a repository called the known error 
database (KEDB). The KEDB consists of various known errors, their identified root 
causes, and the workarounds that can be applied. The known error records are not 
permanent members of a KEDB. Known errors will cease to exist in this repository when 
the permanent solution is implemented. The known error records where permanent 
solutions are implemented are generally archived.
7.5.4.4.5 
Workaround
As mentioned earlier, workarounds are fixes to solve incidents temporarily. Each incident 
could have one or multiple workarounds, but none of them will alleviate the problem 
permanently, and it may be required to revisit the workaround applied on a regular basis.
Let’s say a printer on your floor is not working and you cannot wait until the 
technician can get around to fixing it. A classic workaround in this case is to print from 
a printer on a different floor. The workaround will solve your problem temporarily by 
providing a way to print, but it may not be a permanent solution as you may find it 
inconvenient to run to the next floor each time you need to print something. Another 
workaround could be that you don’t print the document, but instead send the soft copy to 
the intended recipient.
7.5.4.4.6 
Permanent Solution
When the root cause of a problem is known, the follow-up activity in problem 
management process is to identify a permanent solution. This solution permanently 
resolves the problem and contributes toward reduction in incident count and avoids 
future outages.
As mentioned earlier, permanent solutions come at a cost, and organizations may 
not always be willing to shell out the required capital. In such cases, permanent solutions 
are known but not implemented.
7.5.4.5  Problem Management Lifecycle
A generic problem management lifecycle is shown in Figure 7-5. This lifecycle exists 
to meet the prime objectives of the problem management process, which I touched on 
earlier. The process shown here is generic, and it could be used to create the process that 
fits specific requirements and organizational structures.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
184
In the problem management process lifecycle, I have used seven steps to achieve the 
objectives. I will explain each of the steps in the following sections.
7.5.4.5.1 
Step 1: Problem Detection
As with the incident management process, problems need to be detected for the process 
to be triggered. A problem can be identified from any source; it can come as an action 
item from the customer, a threat notification from regulatory departments, or loopholes 
identified by hackers. In the problem management lifecycle, I have considered the 
most common triggers for a problem. Remember that the triggers need to be identified 
beforehand to ensure that the process is well controlled and does not spiral into 
directions that were not factored in.
7.5.4.5.1.1  Event Management
These days, event management tools play a large role in keeping a finger on the pulse 
and to standardize monitoring and capture events that are of significance to IT service 
management. I discussed the application of event management tools in the incident 
management process. In a similar vein, these tools can be programmed to detect 
problems as well. For example, if a server being monitored goes down, an incident 
ticket is raised. Suppose the same server alternates between being offline and online at 
a preconceived number of times. The tools can then be programmed to raise a problem 
ticket for the problem manager to start investigation-related activities.
That being said, it is rare to see the event management tools used to raise problem 
tickets. I have seen such instances with a handful of implementations. To program 
problems on the automation solutions requires a certain amount of maturity for the 
service management organization to design, execute, and control.
7.5.4.5.1.2  Major Incidents
The most common source for triggering problems are major incidents. It is a common 
sighting in the process world to see major incidents tagged to problem investigations. 
Normally, toward the resolution of a major incident, a problem ticket gets created by the 
incident manager. While the major incident resolution brings logical closure to the major 
incident management process, it also gives rise to the problem management process to 
initiate investigations.
This is a good practice as major incidents can cause massive damage to clients, 
financial, productivity, brand image, among others. It is in the interests of all stakeholders 
that a problem investigation is performed for the major incident to identify the loopholes 
and come up with a preventive measure to ensure such outages do not happen in the 
future.
7.5.4.5.1.3  Partners/Suppliers
We live in a world where no single IT service provider organization can afford to provide 
all IT services. There is a need for having suppliers. I discussed this in Chapter 5. 
Suppliers handle specific areas in the delivery of IT services. Let’s say that a particular 

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
185
supplier provides networks, a supplier provides infrastructure, and a supplier manages 
applications. These suppliers would be the best sources for identifying problems in their 
respective areas, rather than a third party trying to identify a problem. Suppliers are one 
of the main triggers or sources of detecting problems. Suppliers are also referred to as 
partners to make them accountable for the overall delivery of IT services.
7.5.4.5.1.4  Analysis/Trending
I briefly touched on pro-active problem management earlier in this chapter. Pro-active 
problem management’s objective is to forecast future problems and stop them from 
happening. In the movie Minority Report, the aim of the main crime fighting organization 
was to stop crimes before they actually took place. This concept of problem management 
is similar to the movie theme. How do you forecast what is going to happen in the future? 
We don’t a crystal ball in IT nor do we have precogs as in the movie. But what we possess 
are historical data. These data can be dissected and when cross-sections are analyzed, we 
can see future problems. One of the techniques of doing pro-active problem management 
is to trend the incidents, or the common root causes of incidents. This will provide insight 
on what is generally going wrong. If we can concentrate our cognitive powers to these 
frequent occurrences and devise a way to fix them permanently, eureka, we can reduce 
recurring incidents. Along with this, we have reduced the incident count, potential 
outages, penalties, and brand image scarring, among others.
Another technique is use of the Pareto principle, where we identify the top 20% of 
the causes, which normally would be responsible for 80% of the incidents, and find a 
permanent solution for the identified incidents. If you could do this, you would reduce 
the incident count by 80%.
7.5.4.5.2 
Step 2: Problem Logging
Problems that are detected need to be documented in a formal way to ensure that the 
problem goes through all the steps in its lifecycle.
Every problem ticket is likely to have all or a subset of these attributes:
• 
Problem number (unique)
• 
User details
• 
Problem summary
• 
Problem description
• 
Problem category
• 
Problem priority
• 
Incident reference number(s)
• 
Investigation details
• 
Resolution/recovery details

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
186
7.5.4.5.2.1  Event Management
Most event management tools today have the capability to autolog problems on the ITSM 
tool. If this capability is not available, the tool will raise alerts in the form of e-mails to the 
service desk function.
7.5.4.5.2.2  Major Incidents
Problems are logged by the incident manager or the service desk function, generally 
toward the end of incident resolution.
7.5.4.5.2.3  Partners/Suppliers
Suppliers or partners who identify problems either log problem tickets on their own or 
provide necessary input to the service desk function or the problem manager.
7.5.4.5.2.4  Analysis/Trending
Problem managers who perform the analysis activities raise the problem ticket based on 
their findings.
7.5.4.5.3 
Step 3: Problem Categorization
All problems have to be categorized similar to incidents. Categorization will help in 
assigning the problem tickets to the right resolver groups and in reporting.
7.5.4.5.4 
Step 4: Problem Prioritization
Some problems are more important than others. They need to be worked with more focus 
than others. How do you differentiate one problem from another? Through assigned 
priorities. This exercise is similar to that used for incidents.
Similar to the incident priority matrix, a problem priority matrix exists, and a 
timeline is associated with it to set targets for investigation and resolution. However, in 
the service industry, problem timelines are not strictly adhered to because incidents, 
as with investigations, tend to take longer than expected in cases of complex problems. 
Generally there will not be the resources assigned to problem management specifically, 
but rather this will be shared with incidents and changes. When an incident comes up 
during at the same time as a problem, the incident always takes priority, and resources 
will always fall short of the time needed to investigate problems and come up with a 
permanent solution.
7.5.4.5.5 
Step 5: Problem Investigation and Diagnosis
Problem investigation and diagnosis starts with identifying the root cause of the problem. 
Getting to the root cause of the problem is the biggest challenge in this exercise. An RCA 
is the output of this step, and it involves various RCA techniques that are employed in 
getting to the root cause. Five why analysis, Ishikawa diagram, Pareto analysis, affinity 

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
187
mapping, and hypothesis testing are the popular techniques used for RCA. A discussion 
about these techniques is outside the scope of the ITIL Foundation examination and 
hence this book.
To conduct a thorough investigation into a problem, suitable resources, referred 
to as problem analysts, must be assigned. They are technical experts who have the 
expertise to delve deeper into the cause of the problem. They will be aided by the KMDB 
and the CMS. The known error database (KEDB) will also be referenced to identify 
whether similar problems had occurred in the past and if so what resolution steps were 
undertaken.
In most cases, the problem analyst tries to re-create the problem to identify the root 
cause. After identifying the root cause, problem resolutions are developed, preferentially 
economical resolutions.
7.5.4.5.6 
Step 6: Problem Resolution
In the previous step, the root cause of the problem is identified and a solution is 
developed to mitigate the problem. The solution can either be a permanent solution, 
which is preferable, or a workaround. You should also be aware that the solution 
implementation may come at a cost. The client might have to invest some capital 
into resolving problems, maybe adding extra infrastructure, procuring applications, 
developing connectors between applications, and leasing more bandwidth, among 
others. So financial approval from the sponsors will always precede the problem 
resolution activity. The financial approval will be based on the business case that the 
service provider develops and the return on investment that the resolution brings to the 
table. For example, if a particular resolution costs $1 million and can improve the client 
productivity by 10%, the client might be tempted to approve it. On the other hand, for the 
same $1 million, if the return on investment cannot be quantified, it may not get the nod. 
Implementation activities will be carried out through the change management process.
Resolution can also come in the form of a workaround. I discussed workarounds 
earlier in this chapter. Workarounds too will face the music from the change management 
process.
At the end of the resolution activity, KEDB will get updated. If a permanent solution 
is implemented, the KEDB record will be archived. If a workaround is implemented, the 
KEDB record will be updated with the necessary workaround details. In a workaround 
implementation, it is a good practice to keep the problem record open.
7.5.4.5.7 
Step 7: Problem Closure
When a permanent solution is implemented, the problem record needs to be updated 
with the historical data (of the problem), resolution details, change details, and then 
closed with the appropriate status. If a workaround is implemented, keep the problem 
record open in an appropriate status to indicate that the problem is temporarily fixed 
using a workaround. The problem manager is generally responsible for closing all 
problem records.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations

7.5.4.6  Problem Management Interfaces
Problem management interfaces with a number of processes across the IT service 
lifecycle. The most commonly used interfaces are discussed in the sections that follow.
7.5.4.6.1 
Incident Management
Incidents and problems share the closest interface as unresolved incidents due to an 
unknown root cause lead to problems. Moreover, recurring incidents also come under the 
scope of the problem management process. When problems are resolved, leading to an 
implementation of a permanent solution, the incident count comes down.
7.5.4.6.2 
Change Management
Change management also plays an important part in interfacing with the problem 
management process during the solution implementation. All permanent solutions 
and workarounds that are identified in the problem management process go through 
the change management process before implementation. A request for change is raised 
by the problem management process to trigger the change management process for 
implementing solutions.
Change management keeps track of all changes that were implemented for solving 
problems and reports back to the problem management process, especially during 
anomalies.
When changes fail, an investigation is conducted to identify the reasons for the 
change failure. This investigation is performed by the problem management process.
7.5.4.6.3 
Release and Deployment Management
The problem management process can be employed to identify problems arising from 
deployment activities. The release and deployment management process is a direct 
beneficiary of the problem management’s investigation and permanent solution.
7.5.4.6.4 
Service Asset and Configuration Management
The CMS is the foundation for all processes to carry out their activities accurately and 
effectively. Problem management also leverages the CMS to identify faulty CIs and use 
these relationships to arrive at the underlying root cause of incidents.
7.5.4.6.5 
Seven-Step Improvement Process
The seven-step improvement process is a part of the continual service improvement 
(CSI) lifecycle phase, which will be discussed in Chapter 8. The process uses the existing 
incidents and problems to identify service improvements.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
189
7.5.4.6.6 
Availability Management
The availability management process aims at increasing the uptime and decreasing the 
downtime of IT services. The problem management process can help the availability 
management process achieve its target through pro-active problem management, 
proposing solutions that can prevent outages.
7.5.4.6.7 
Capacity Management
Capacity-related problems require the capacity management process for support during 
the problem investigation. Maybe there is a problem pertaining to excessive storage 
allocations, which requires the capacity management process to provide input to solve 
the problem.
7.5.4.6.8 
Service-Level Management
The service-level management reports on the performance of IT services, which is 
dependent on the incidents and problems in the system. The reduction of incidents 
brought forth and the improvements recommended by the problem management 
process are duly reported to the customer, and it drives the value proposition for the 
service provider.
7.5.5  Access Management
Access management is the final process in the service operations lifecycle phase. It is a 
minor process and it takes shape from the request fulfillment management process and 
the information security management process.
The purpose of the access management process is to provide access to various 
services and components of a service and to authorized or prevent access to 
unauthorized users. Examples could include access to applications, datacenters, IT 
offices, server administration, and accessing e-mails and Internet services.
The access management process is primarily based on the request fulfillment 
process, as the act of requesting and providing access falls under service requests and 
the activities follow the pattern set forth by the request fulfillment process. The essential 
principle of providing access to services and its components falls under information 
security management and is governed through various information security and access 
management policies.
7.5.5.1  Objectives of the Access Management Process
The objectives of the access management process are as follows:
• 
Provide access to authorized users and prevent access to 
unauthorized users
• 
Manage access provision under the boundaries set by the 
information security process

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
190
• 
Comply with the request fulfillment management process 
controls in providing, revoking, and changing accesses
• 
Ensure users’ access is not exploited or improperly used
7.5.5.2  Scope of Access Management
Access management’s scope covers the length and breadth of IT services provided to the 
customer and its related components. For examples, if the service offered to a customer 
is related to financial services, this includes all access to applications that fall under 
the financial services, access to administration of servers and switches that enable the 
service, access to security bays, among others.
Access management is usually a part of the request fulfillment process. It is highly 
unlikely that people would be deployed just to provide access. Access management 
activities will be grouped with other service request fulfillment activities, and the groups 
that fulfill service requests will be given the responsibility for providing access as well.
Providing access manually is becoming rare and could soon become a thing of the 
past. Access is grouped with the roles in the organization, and assignment of various roles 
by the human resources department will automatically provide access. This is possible 
through the identity management tools that integrate with various applications through 
plug-ins and are powered to provide and revoke access based on the assigned roles.
Access also comes in different flavors. Generally, you have the following accesses 
commonly assigned:
• 
Read only access
• 
Modify access
• 
Create access
• 
Super user access (includes deletion)
• 
Administrator access
The scope for providing, altering, and revoking access is derived from the 
information security policy and process. As I discussed under the information security 
management process, the process strictly adheres to confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability parameters. However, the access management process is only responsible for 
the confidentiality part of information security.
7.6  Functions
In Chapter 1 I briefly discussed the concept of functions and how they interface with 
processes. To reiterate, think of functions as a team or group of people who carry out 
process activities. In the IT industry, there are generally several teams: Unix team, Wintel 
team, SAP team, JAVA team, and Network team, to name a few. Each of these teams has a 
function, and their work is driven through processes. For example, the network team will 
work on incidents when a network incident is detected. And they also work on network 
changes, say if a switch is getting replaced.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
191
There are four functions defined in ITIL service lifecycle based on the activities 
performed and the scope that falls under the respective teams. The four functions are:
	
1.	
Service desk
	
2.	
Technical management
	
3.	
Application management
	
4.	
IT operations management

7.6.1  Service Desk
The most important function in service management engagements is the service desk. 
It is a team of people who carry out a number of activities under the pretense of various 
processes. When you dial the service or product help lines in your organization, your call 
is invariably answered by a service desk. When you send out e-mails requesting support, 
it is the service desk that processes it.
A service desk is designed to be the single point of contact for IT end users. 
Whenever they have to report incidents, they are required to reach out to the service desk 
for support, not to individual teams like the server and network team. If end users need to 
request services through the request fulfillment management process, they also need to 
reach out to a service desk.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
192
Not only for end users, a service desk can also be scoped to be the first point of 
contact for suppliers, other process managers such as service-level management, and 
availability and capacity management. In short, a service desk is capable of carrying out a 
number of activities.
7.6.1.1  Benefits of a Service Desk
There was a time when a service desk did not exist in service management organizations. 
They didn’t see the need for one at the time. Whenever users had to report incidents, 
they knew the technical people, and they would contact them directly. During those days 
(before the dawn of the information age), the numbers of IT end users were manageable. 
The direct rapport with technical teams helped them get the job done.
Today, there are thousands of IT end users working around the clock, in multiple 
locations, and using various IT devices to carry out their work. If the times when no 
service desk was available were to be imagined, think of all the calls that technical team 
would start to receive. How would the technical team ensure that the load was spread 
across the team? How would the technical team know whether the user was calling the 
right technician? How would they decide on the priority, which issues to work first and 
which ones to pick up later in the day or week? The answer is that it is impossible to think 
of IT service management functioning without a service desk. They channel triggers and 
route them to the right groups of people. They prioritize incidents and service requests to 
aid technical teams in acting on higher priorities first.
There was a time when IT service providers were required to provide a business case 
for installing service desks. Not anymore!
Here are the other benefits of having a service desk:
• 
Improves accessibility to IT staff for IT end users, customers, and 
suppliers
• 
Optimizes usage of IT resources
• 
Improves customer service and customer excitement
• 
Provides faster turnaround on service requests
• 
Optimizes the cost of providing IT support
Let me explain the last item here. The people who work at the service desk are not 
required to possess much experience, nor are they expected to be technically sound. 
It is a position that opens its doors for fresh college grads and those who wish to start 
their careers in IT. One of the main requirements for working at a service desk is good 
communication skills—telephonic and writing.
I mentioned that the cost of providing IT services is optimized. The service desk hires 
entry-level job seekers who are paid less than an experienced technical professional. 
So by hiring less-skilled resources, the operational costs are reduce, and this provides a 
win-win situation for the fresh graduates, IT service providers, and the customers (as the 
benefit of cost reduction is passed on to the customer).

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
193
7.6.1.2  Objectives of a Service Desk
The service desk exists to serve the purpose of being a single point of contact for IT end 
users. They primarily handle incidents and service requests but can also be equipped to 
take care of changes and communicate with users and other parties.
The other objectives of a service desk are:
• 
Log, categorize, and prioritize incidents and service requests
• 
Act as the first level of support for incident diagnosis and 
investigation
• 
Fulfill simple service requests that do not require technical 
expertise
• 
Resolve incidents and fulfill service requests during the first 
interaction with users
• 
Communicate with users on updates to incidents and service 
requests, such as confirmation of incident resolution and delay in 
stock arrivals
• 
Provide functional escalation of incidents and service requests for 
speedy turnaround
• 
Perform customer satisfaction surveys and related feedback 
activities
• 
Update CMDB (depends on the ITIL design and implementation)
7.6.1.3  Service Desk Structures
I am assuming that you have worked in more than one organization. Compare your 
current organization’s structure with the previous organization’s structure. There were 
definitely distinct differences between the two structures, right? Why do organizations 
choose to build their own structure and not follow a set structure based on certain 
standardized principles? The answer is strategy.
Strategy drives how organizations are to be structured. Some structures work better 
than others, while others might bring in synergy, generating more value with the same set 
of people. It is observed that traditional organizations typically opt for highly hierarchical 
structure, while start-ups and new age organizations go for flat organizations. There 
are advantages and disadvantages with both. As long as the advantages outweigh the 
disadvantages, organizations are convinced of their justification to opt for it.
As the service desk is manned by people, lots of them, it is imperative that the 
structuring needs some serious thinking. There can be a number of ways a service desk 
can be structured. As long as the core objectives of the service desk are met, it can be 
structured as needed. In this book, I will discuss three common types of service desk 
structures. This is an important topic from the service management perspective and also 
from an examination standpoint.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
194
The three structures of a service desk are:
	
1.	
Local service desk
	
2.	
Centralized service desk
	
3.	
Virtual service desk
7.6.1.3.1 
Local Service Desk
As the structure nomenclature indicates, a local service desk has a limited boundary and 
serves a subset of the overall function. It is a service desk that is particular for a specific 
office/location/region. This type is shown in Figure 7-7.

Figure 7-7.  Local service desk
In Figure 7-7, I have considered three distinct locations that an organization is set 
up in, which is quite common these days: Bangalore, Sydney, and Zurich. Each of these 
locations houses a service desk. The service desk in Bangalore caters to the Bangalore 
location only, and the Sydney and Zurich location service desks cater to their respective 
locations as well. Within the location, the end users, technical teams, suppliers, and 
operations teams reach out to their respective service desk.
The advantages of a local service desk are:
• 
The service desk, end users, and the teams involved generally 
speak the same language, which leads to better understanding of 
the problem and the feedback provided by both the parties
• 
Sharing a similar culture helps develop rapport and reduce 
differences

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
195
• 
VIP users can be better served through customized service
• 
Increased customer satisfaction
The disadvantages of a local service desk are:
• 
Expensive option as the infrastructure, applications, and other 
aspects of a service desk have to be duplicated in every location
• 
Call volumes in a local service desk normally do not justify its 
existence
• 
Processes and tools within the organization may not be 
standardized and could lead to differential treatment
7.6.1.3.2 
Centralized Service Desk
Organizations normally opt for a centralized service desk. There are distinct advantages, 
which has led to this being the most popular structure. An organization will mobilize and 
station a single service desk at a strategic location. This is shown in Figure 7-8.

Centralized Service Desk
Figure 7-8.  Centralized service desk
A centralized service desk is formed with a single service desk, instead of having 
a service desk at every location. In this example, the locations Bangalore, Sydney, and 
Zurich have no individual service desk, and a centralized service desk is formed, which 
caters to all the locations. The centralized service desk could be formed in any one of the 
existing locations or in a new location altogether. It does not matter where the centralized 
service desk is set up, but what matters is that the organization has only one service desk 
as a single point of contact for all end users and other stakeholders.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
196
It is possible that the technical teams and suppliers are still localized. Yet, when they 
have to reach out to the service desk, they need to call the centralized service desk. In 
most organization setups, there are centralized technical teams that handle respective 
technologies from a central location as well. These central teams, if they need to, reach 
out to a centralized service desk.
A local presence may be installed if the organization sees the need to have hands-on 
support. This is totally optional.
The advantages of a centralized service desk are:
• 
Since there is a single setup, the cost of operations will be 
economical when compared to the local service desk setup
• 
Cost savings extend to optimizations made with the service desk 
resources, infrastructure, administration, and other indirect 
expenses
• 
Service desk can be operated with fewer resources
• 
Standardization can be achieved easily, as a single team following 
the same set of protocols is easier to achieve than multiple teams 
following a single set of processes, procedures, standards, and 
scripts
• 
Management has a better overview on the performance and 
effectiveness of a service desk in the centralized setup
The disadvantages of centralized service desk are:
• 
The local flavor, language and culture, will be lost on the users
• 
Some users may prefer proximity and personal touch for their 
support needs, and a centralized service desk may not provide 
this option for all the organizational locations
7.6.1.3.3 
Virtual Service Desk
A centralized service desk is a good idea. But how easy or difficult is it to find the people, 
a location, willingness to work through the night, friendly regulatory controls to support 
24/7 operations, and other bells and whistles that make it a reality? Through technology, 
we can achieve a centralized service desk without the co-location factor for service desk 
employees. We could have a centralized service desk even when service desk agents sit in 
different parts of the globe and operate as one unit. Let’s look at how this is achieved.
Figure 7-9 represents a virtual service desk, and it is almost similar to the centralized 
service desk. It looks the same, as the underlying principle between the two setups is the 
same. But in a virtual service desk, we achieve centralization through technology. And the 
virtual service desk enforces usage of a common service knowledge management system 
(SKMS) to ensure standardization and easy exchange of information.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
197
Today, we have the technology to bring service desk agents onto the service desk 
platform from the comfort of their homes. A number of housewives are working at call 
centers from their homes. The phones calls are routed to their personal lines or come in 
through voice over Internet protocol on the agent’s personal computer. The end user will 
notice no difference between a centralized service desk and a virtual service desk, as the 
technology seamlessly integrates disjointed bits into a single unit.
Likewise, organizations are off-shoring, near-shoring, and outsourcing a number of 
service desks to countries where talent is available in plenty and where the operational 
costs are marginal when compared to the customer’s market location.
In this book, I’ll discuss two ways of creating a virtual service desk: the follow-the-
sun model and the specialized service desk.
The follow-the-sun model works the best in a global organization that houses users 
across the globe and has a need to support the users 24/7 and 365 days a year.
Instead of having a centralized service desk in one single location, it can be spread 
across multiple locations across the globe. The concept of this model is that the service 
desk in a particular location is operational during their daytime. During the nights, the 
next service desk where it is still daytime takes over until nightfall.
Let’s consider the example of an organization with service desk setups in Bangalore, 
Tokyo, and Detroit. Tokyo sees the first daylight, and the service desk becomes 
operational, say at around 9 A.M. local time. Calls from users from across the globe get 
routed to the Tokyo service desk. The service desk in Bangalore will become operational

at 9 A.M. local time. The Tokyo service desk closes down when the sun sets (6 P.M.). Calls 
from users will start landing in the Bangalore service desk. As daytime begins in Detroit (6 
A.M.), the service desk in that city takes effect, and becomes operational. The service desk 
in Bangalore closes down, and the Detroit service desk takes over. As the day in Detroit 
comes to a close, the Tokyo service desk would start up the following day, and the cycle 
continues.
This model is in vogue with some major organizations. When you call the customer 
care line, you will notice that the call sometimes gets picked up by those with foreign 
accents (multiple accents), and at times by those with local accents. This, you may 
have observed, happens during a particular period of time. Say, when you call at night, 
somebody in India will be your service desk agent. And when you call during the day, 
you might hear a service desk agent speaking American English. This is virtualization 
chugging its wheels in the background, and you, as the user, will have called the same 
number each time, and all the technicalities of call routing are done in the backend. Isn’t 
it cool?
The next type of a virtual service desk is not based on time, zones, or daylight. It takes 
shape based on the expertise in a particular area. In this service desk, it is possible to 
house different types of experts in different locations. And, through the power of IVR and 
routing, it is possible to route the call to the respective expert sitting across the globe.
Let’s consider an example of an organization with the specialized service desk setup. 
When a user calls in, the IVR prompts him to select the type of problem that he is facing: 
Laptop, Desktop, Network, Storage, or Application. When the user selects laptop, the call 
gets routed to a laptop support group sitting in London. They will talk to him and take 
care of the resolution. If the user selects Application, the call gets routed to Manila, and 
application experts who are seated in Manila are responsible for the resolution of the 
user’s application issue. Likewise, it is possible that expert teams are spread across the 
globe, and depending on the issue on hand, the respective service desk takes over.
This type of a setup is common in IT services organizations, as they normally tend to 
hire specific skill sets in particular locations.
The advantages of a virtual service desk are:
• 
Organizations can become resilient with virtual service desks, 
where they can bank on one or the other service desks if one was 
to fail and eliminate the single point of failure
• 
It can be a less expensive option compared to the centralized 
service desk, as deploying home-working professionals can 
reduce the resourcing costs
• 
It can also be less expensive if the organization doesn’t have to 
shell out infrastructure costs because the service desk agents are 
working out of their homes
• 
There are rules in some countries to pay an additional wage if 
professionals are made to work beyond a certain time, which can 
be eliminated with a virtual service desk

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
199
The disadvantages of a virtual service desk are:
• 
Aligning all service desks on common processes, procedures, 
terminologies, and language is an onerous task and requires 
plenty of training, course corrections, and constant management
• 
Coordination between virtual service desk teams and technical 
teams can be challenging
• 
End users may feel a difference in service quality, as when they 
reach different service desks
• 
Plenty of management efforts are needed, and there is a need for 
automation to transfer tickets from one service desk to another
7.6.2  Technical Management
The technical management function is a team or a set of teams that handle IT 
infrastructure. They are accountable for the overall IT infrastructure management in the 
organization. There are various technical management teams that are employed, such as 
server teams, network teams, database teams, storage teams, and datacenter teams.
7.6.2.1  Technical Management Roles
The role of technical management is twofold. First, they possess the complete technical 
expertise that is needed to strategize, design, transition, operate, and improve IT 
infrastructure. The decisions pertaining to infrastructure (like say switching from one 
technology to another) are consulted with the technical management function.
Second, the resources who work on IT infrastructure are a part of the technical 
management function. They are all housed in this function and are deployed to various 
projects depending on their expertise, location and experience.
The objective of technical management is to ensure that the organization can get the 
right infrastructure personnel, as and when the need arises. The function forecasts and 
plans resources based on existing projects, projects in the pipeline, and resilience.
In a typical organization, the hiring structure will be based on a pyramid. The base 
of the pyramid represents lower-skilled resources, forming the majority of the function. 
The next layer is the higher-level resources. They are fewer in strength. So, as the level of 
expertise increases, the strength of technical resources reduces.
For example, for normal administrative activities, you need resources with minimal 
experience, say L1 resources. For advanced administrative activities, you need people 
with decent operational experience, L2 resources. Resources who are involved in 
transition and designs need to have in-depth knowledge of the technology, L3 resources. 
Strategic decisions are made by resources who have technical, managerial, and 
innovative skill sets.

7.6.2.2  Objectives of Technical Management
The objectives of the technical management function are:
• 
Develop stable and highly resilient infrastructure designs
• 
Design cost-effective infrastructure
• 
Maintain IT infrastructure by using adequate resources
• 
Ensure the right technical resources are deployed for on-time 
resolution of incidents
7.6.3  Application Management
Application management and technical management are two sides of the same coin. 
While technical management function takes care of IT infrastructure (hardware), 
application management is accountable for software management and its related 
activities.
The application management function is a team or set of teams that have expertise in 
managing applications. All applications, including enterprise and business applications, 
come under the scope of application management. They have the overall accountability 
across the lifecycle of an application, requirement gathering, decision to buy or build, 
application development, testing (unit, system, and UAT), deployment, retirement, and 
improvements.
7.6.3.1  Application Management Roles
The roles of application management are as follows:
• 
They are accountable for the applications knowledge and the 
intellectual properties pertaining to software development and 
provide the expertise to manage applications throughout their 
lifecycle.
• 
They works hand in hand with the technical management 
function, and together they are responsible for the knowledge and 
maturity of designing, building, testing, deploying, and improving 
applications.
• 
Resources to manage applications across the lifecycle come from 
the application management team. This function is typically 
divided into applications support and build groups such as the 
SAP team, Java team, web software team, etc. These resources 
will be deployed for all activities pertaining to applications 
maintenance across the service lifecycle.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
201
• 
The resources in the application management lifecycle have to be 
trained and kept current in terms of the coding and applications 
technologies in vogue and must be brought up to speed whenever 
technology enhancements happen.
• 
Application management provides the expertise and guidance 
to the service operations lifecycle phase to manage and keep 
the applications in status quo during the operational phase. 
The target is to achieve the SLAs that are agreed upon with the 
customer and to ensure that applications’ improvements lead to 
improvement in service to the customer.
7.6.3.2  Objectives of Application Management
The objectives of application management are:
• 
Provide wisdom in the build versus buy decision for applications
• 
Develop stable applications designs that can stand the test of 
time, are resilient, and are cost effective
• 
Develop and maintain resources with required skill sets to 
improve and maintain the applications in scope
• 
Ensure that the applications outages and issues are resolved 
within the customer agreed upon timelines
• 
Ensure that the applications meet the business objectives
7.6.3.3  Applications Development vs. Application Management
It was once believed that applications development and application management lived in 
separate worlds. Much to our horror, the two are closer related than ever before, and they 
have started to work as the same team and collaborate more than ever envisaged.
Applications development deals with development of an application. It follows a 
project management methodology such as Waterfall or Agile, and the product is made 
available after a finite number of days. The stages of an application development lifecycle 
are illustrated in Figure 7-10.

Chapter 7 ■ Service Operations
202
Application management deals with the application with respect to the service 
offered to the customer. It deals with the strategy of build versus buy, the design and 
inclusion in the service, and how the application will meet the business outcome in 
transition, operation, continual improvement, and finally pull the plug (decommission) 
when necessary. Figure 7-11 illustrates the stages of application management.

7.6.4  IT Operations Management
The objective of IT operations is to ensure that the services that are in production remain 
in status quo, and if there are any anomalies, they are detected early and resolved before 
they cause a bigger impact to the customer. The IT operations management is a function 
that is involved at the ground level, keeping their ears close to the ground and carrying 
out repeatable tasks that are necessary to keep the service floating above the surface.
This function is closely involved in monitoring the service, whether it is the hardware 
or the software. If anything were to go wrong, they would pick up the alert and act on it. If 
needed, they would functionally escalate to the technical and application management 
functions for support.
Note that the activities performed by the IT operations management are basic and 
are repetitive in nature. However, to be able to perform this task, the resources involved 
must undergo stringent training to ensure that mishaps are avoided from human error 
and subtrained resources.
However, today there is a conscious drive to automate repetitive activities, and most 
monitoring activities are taken care of by event management tools, which are capable of 
logging incidents and generating alerts as necessary. Yet, service provider and customer 
organizations rely on human resources to keep tabs on activities through command 
centers, which usually house large monitors with real-time activity and operations 
personnel sitting in front of them, feeding jobs, running scripts, and calling other 
command centers for action and counteraction.
As mentioned earlier, IT operations management is divided into two subfunctions:

7.6.4.1  IT Operations Control
IT operations control is a centralized monitoring and overseer of the operational activities 
in the service operations phase. Individual teams have their own setup to monitor 
and track operations, but what goes on inside IT operations control is service/tower/
organizational-level monitoring and overseeing.
Its role includes the following:
• 
Monitoring of service and other towers from a central monitoring 
station, generally referred to as a command center, operations 
bridge, or console management, which monitors on a real-time 
basis and takes appropriate actions
• 
Monitoring of scheduled jobs and scheduling new jobs, 
undertaken by IT operations control
• 
Monitoring of incremental, differential, and full backups, and 
restoration of data from backups
• 
Centralized printing and electronic outputs, which includes 
collation and distribution within and outside the organization
7.6.4.2  Facilities Management
Management of services does not include hardware and software alone. It requires a 
place to house it all. This is where the facilities management comes in.
Its objectives include:
• 
Management of data centers, workplaces, AC cooling units, and 
other facilities, which includes regular maintenance activities
• 
Achieving cost reduction and stability by consolidating facilities, 
such as data center consolidation for management oversight cost 
reduction
• 
Providing physical security to sensitive areas and ensuring access 
to only the authorized personnel
• 
Management of facilities contracts if facilities management is 
outsourced to a supplier
7.6.4.3  Objectives of IT Operations Management
The objectives of IT operations management are:
• 
Ensure stability of an organization through maintenance activities 
governed by various processes, procedures, and work instructions
• 
Achieve cost reductions in maintenance of services through 
introduction of improvements
• 
Resolve issues arising in the monitoring space as quickly as 
possible to ensure that the services do not affect customer’s 
activities to a great extent

7.8  Summary
In this chapter, I discussed the service operations lifecycle phase and explained its 
objectives, scope, and the value it brings to the table. I also explained the processes 
embedded within the service operations phase. The processes that I explained include: 
event management process, incident management process, request fulfillment process, 
problem management process, and access management process. I also described the 
functions that are included under the phases of service desk, technical management, 
application management, and IT operations.
In the next chapter, you will learn about the ITIL continual service improvement 
lifecycle phase, which consists of a single process, and a number of new concepts to 
improve the quality of service.

CHAPTER 8
Continual Service 
Improvement
Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, 
achievement, and success have no meaning.
—Benjamin Franklin
If you are not improving, you are dying.
—Abhinav Krishna Kaiser
Everything in nature is bound to improve, although some improve in leaps and bounds 
and some more gradually. If something or someone doesn’t improve, they wither and 
die. Take, for example, the theory of evolution. Certain characteristics have changed in 
us and in other living things over successive generations. They have always changed for 
the better, with successive generations bettering from their parents and forefathers in 
adapting to the environment. Mutations and genetic drifts are other improvements that 
are a result of evolution. So, in effect, we have survived all these years and will survive for 
years to come because we have improved and continue to do so.
Take, for example, the products and services we use every day. They have invariably 
improved, some products like mobile phones and televisions have seen exponential 
improvements, while others like air conditioners and irons have more or less improved at 
a snail’s pace. In the service industry, Internet service has come a long way from dial-up 
connections to fiber optic-powered broadband, while e-mail service has taken baby steps. 
Yet, the common underlying element is that all services need improvement for them to 
survive, or a competitor who brings in a better performing service will run away with the 
market share.
In IT service management too, improvements are absolutely essential. The services 
that were conceived in the service strategy phase, designed in the service design phase, 
built and deployed in the transition phase, and maintained in the service operations 
phase have to remain relevant. The only way they can remain useful and competitive 
is if they improve, improvement in terms of what it can deliver, how quickly it can be

delivered, and with a reduced rate of breakdowns. If you are providing application 
maintenance services, you are expected as a service provider to:
• 
Improve MTTR (mean time to resolve) for incidents
• 
Reduce outages by introducing monitoring alerts and through 
pro-active measures
• 
Provide change management that is dynamic and agile
• 
Reduce the cost of providing services by introducing 
improvements such as self-help options
• 
Increase the service window through automation
The continual service improvement (CSI) phase does not follow a sequence; instead 
it stretches across the other lifecycle phases. The CSI phase can be initiated during any 
of the other four phases, and improvements can be enacted on the strategy, design, 
build, deployment, and operational activities. The important factor in the CSI phase is 
that the CSI processes keep a close check on and monitor the services and processes for 
improvement opportunities.
8.1  Why Continual and Not Continuous?
The words continuous and continual are often used interchangeably, although there is a 
significant variance between the two terms. The term continuous is more in vogue, and 
it refers to actions that are unending. So, in our context, the improvements that we are 
referring to are unending, which is true to an extent.
The term continual, which is used in the context of improvements in this chapter 
and in ITIL, refers to improvements that are unending, but with breaks for the sake of 
stability. Continual refers to implementing an improvement and letting it stabilize for a 
period of time before embarking on the next improvement. Although the improvements 
are continuous in nature, the stabilization periods in between make it continual. This is 
illustrated in Figure 8-1.
Continuous

Figure 8-1.  Continuous versus continual

Chapter 8 ■ Continual Service Improvement
211
In ITIL, continual service improvement is embraced as the need for stability 
prioritized over the number of improvements that can be done over a period of time.
8.2  Deming’s Cycle
Deming’s cycle is popularly known as the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act). It is also referred 
to as PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act). It is an iterative cycle that guarantees improvements 
for the activity it has been applied to. PDCA can be applied to any activity, including IT 
services in the IT service management space.
Dr. William Edwards Deming is the man behind the concept, who is considered to 
be the father of modern quality control. PDCA is one of the many quality controls that he 
introduced. Deming is an American engineer, who became a legend in Japan after World 
War II. He is believed to have changed the manufacturing and business process in Japan 
more than any other individual not of Japanese origin. Japan honored him by inducting 
an annual quality management award known as the Deming Prize in 1951. The United 
States awarded him the National Medal of Technology in 1987.
8.2.1  The PDCA Cycle
The PDCA cycle can be applied to an activity or a set of activities that are planned in 
advance. In the IT industry, it is mostly applied to the service management function. The 
cycle is somewhat similar to Kaizen (continuous improvement in Japanese), where minor 
improvements are done at one time, and the cycle must be iterated to get the essence of it.
In the ITIL service lifecycle, the CSI phase relies on the PDCA cycle’s principles for 
identifying and effecting improvements. The cycle can be applied to IT services as well 
as ITIL processes. The sections below examine each of the parts of the PDCA process, as 
shown in Figure 8-2.
Plan

Act
Figure 8-2.  Deming’s PDCA cycle

Chapter 8 ■ Continual Service Improvement
212
8.2.1.1  Plan
Any activity you need to undertake requires some planning. The first step in the cycle 
is to prepare a plan that will consider all the possible combinations of outcomes, risks, 
necessary resource requirements, among others.
The plan gets initiated based on various triggers that you have set forth for triggering 
the CSI cycle. For example, you could get feedback from a customer, the service provider 
organization could get penalized for breaching the SLA, or the service design may not 
fully meet all the customer’s requirements.
Deming’s cycle recommends that the improvements be made small and repetitively. 
So it is important that planning be based on improvements that are quick to realize and 
easy to adapt if necessary. Agile project management methodology works the best with 
the PDCA cycle.
A typical plan will have the deliverables that will be delivered by the end of the 
improvement project. The plan would also incorporate the timeline, cost, and scope the 
improvement covers. It’s like any other project management plan, nothing fancy, nor is it 
any different.
Let’s say you have identified a resolver group that is struggling to meet their target 
SLAs. To initiate a PDCA cycle for improving the SLA, you have analyzed and audited 
the incident tickets and, based on your analysis, you will come up with a plan. The plans 
could be as follows:
	
1.	
Develop a process for monitoring the queue
	
2.	
Provide technical trainings to the team members
	
3.	
Create hierarchical structure with team leads to share 
accountability
8.2.1.2  Do
The plans have to be executed during the Do phase of the PDCA cycle. This phase 
generally stretches for the longest duration as the planned activities are carried out in this 
step. Care must be taken to ensure that the project management’s triple constraints (time, 
cost, and scope) are controlled to ensure success of the improvements being initiated.
By adopting the Agile project management methodology, the Do or the execution 
phase becomes less sluggish and easier to control and deliver.
In the example stated above, you will start developing a process to monitor their 
work queue, start providing technical training, and, with the help of the human resources 
department, create some team structure.
8.2.1.3  Check
The PDCA cycle mandates checking or vetting the applied improvement against its set 
objectives. For example, if you have stated initiatives to improve the SLA of a particular 
resolver group, the Check phase of the PDCA cycle checks, after a certain measurable 
period of time, whether the improvement has had any effect and whether the SLAs have 
improved since the last count.

Chapter 8 ■ Continual Service Improvement
213
Big bang improvements are a rarity. Improvements are generally miniscule, and 
the sum of the parts presents the big picture. In the same example, let’s assume that the 
resolver group is sitting on a SLA of 60% and the target SLA is 90%. The improvement 
project that you have undertaken should not aim to take the SLA to beyond 90% in one 
go, as it could then be prone to failure. The prudent thing to do is to aim at improvement 
of 10% at a time. Once an improvement is completed, check what has been done right 
and determine the things that have been futile or wrong.
The activity of the Check phase is to conduct a thorough analysis of deliveries that 
were achieved and those that failed, including any partial results. The analysis must 
suggest what has gone right and wrong, and then outline the steps to undertake to bridge 
the actual results with the goals.
8.2.1.4  Act
The analysis conducted would provide pointers on what needs to be done to fill the 
bridge between what was planned and what was implemented. And the improvements 
that were listed are implemented in this part of the cycle.
This step is similar to the Do step, where execution is involved. In the Act phase, 
however, the execution is based on the gap analysis conducted in the Check phase.
Returning to the example above, let’s say that during the Check phase you found out 
that the training is not effective. You need to fix the gap by identifying relevant training 
and putting the resolver groups into these training sessions.
8.2.1.5  Iteration
Figure 8-2 illustrated the PDCA cycle and the effect of iterations of this cycle. To achieve 
continual improvement, it is imperative that iterations be performed until the desired 
results are obtained. Figure 8-2 also indicated that running several iterations will move 
the wheel on an upward incline, leading to better results and improving the services or 
the processes in a desired pattern.
My advice is to iterate as long as you deem the results provide a return on investment 
that has been put in, and as long as it makes sense to improve a service or a process. But, 
it is important to make sure that the improvements implemented are continual in nature, 
so provide time between improvements for stabilization.
In the SLA improvement scenario, you can perform the PDCA cycle a number of 
times, across various resolver groups. There is no limit as to how many criteria you can 
pick in each iteration.
8.2.2  Another PDCA Example
8.2.2.1  Plan
Let’s say you are building a web site. First, develop a plan on what you want to do 
along with rough sketches in a document. Think thoroughly on various aspects of web 
designing, such as the features you want to include, perhaps adding a newsletter module, 
a contact form, and so on. Make sure that it is all in writing.

Chapter 8 ■ Continual Service Improvement
214
8.2.2.2  Do
Whether you outsource it to a professional or develop the web site yourself is your choice. 
As I said earlier, this is a very simple step. But, the Do process must reproduce what the 
Plan step states.
8.2.2.3  Check
After the web site is developed, compare the plan with what you have on hand; there 
will be gaps that you need to bridge in the next step. Apart from this, analyze for any 
improvements that can be made like adding Ajax forms instead of a normal one. 
Document the gaps and the improvements that you wish to make in the same document.
8.2.2.4  Act
Let’s say the Check step has uncovered some gaps in the web site development. The Act 
step undertakes activities to bridge the gap.
You have now completed one cycle of PDCA. Remember that this cycle is an iterative 
one, and you can take as many as you want to build a web site, which will improve every 
time it rolls through the cycle.
8.3  CSI Approach
As discussed earlier, improvements should be made in increments, and the sum of the 
parts will fully realize the desired enhancements to the services and processes. To achieve 
improvements, ITIL recommends a logical approach for making improvements. It is 
shown in Figure 8-3, and each item is discussed in the sections that follow.
What is the Vision?

be?
How do we keep the
Momentum going?
How do we get
there?
Did we get there?
Figure 8-3.  Continual service improvement approach

Chapter 8 ■ Continual Service Improvement
215
8.3.1  What Is the Vision?
Vision in the business context comprises the long-term goals and objectives for the 
organizations. Every business will therefore start with a vision, such as being a leader in 
mobile cell service with over 50% of the market share, and maybe spreading peace across 
the globe through spirituality and thoughtfulness.
8.3.1.1  Real-Life Story on Vision
McDonald’s founder Ray Kroc was in a bar with a bunch of MBA students. He asked one 
of them: “What business do you think we are in?” The student duly replied: “You are in 
the business of selling hamburgers.” Ray retorted: “I am selling hamburgers but that is not 
my business. My real business is real estate.”
As a service provider organization, you must make sure that you understand your 
customer’s vision. Unless you are in sync with it, you will start working toward selling 
hamburgers rather than the core business objectives.
The IT strategy must be based on the business vision, mission, goals, and objectives. 
This is the only way the service provider can understand and create value (through 
improvements) to the customer organization.
8.3.2  Where Are We Now?
Unless the present situation is known, it is impossible to measure the level of 
improvements applied at the end of the cycle. An assessment needs to be performed to 
gather the current establishment, setup, and performances. Perform a dipstick check to 
obtain a snapshot view, which will be used as a baseline for future comparison.
The assessment must be based on all aspects of a service such as people, technology, 
processes, and so forth. Only when all aspects of a service are obtained will it be possible 
to perform an unbiased assessment of the current baseline, not based on conjecture.
8.3.3  Where Do We Want to Be?
We know what the final goal is and we are aware of the current state of affairs. Now 
we need to know the targets that we aim to achieve. The answer to this question must 
come from the business alone, as the targets define the set of improvements, associated 
activities, and the respective service improvement costs that the customer has to bear.
Targets will generally come in lists. Attach priorities and timelines to each of the 
milestones, and obtain approval for these from the customer.
8.3.4  How Do We Get There?
We have a target in front of us, and the next step is to identify a set of steps to achieve the 
business targets or requirements. Basically we are looking at a plan, architecture, and 
solution to achieve and improve targets.
Some of the activities that you perform may be relevant to the individual 
improvement cycle, and some activities may contribute throughout the improvement 

Chapter 8 ■ Continual Service Improvement
216
program. Identify such activities to ensure that they are aligned with the overall 
improvement program delivery.
8.3.5  Did We Get There?
The improvement solution gets implemented through the change management process. 
Once it is implemented, we need to verify whether the improvement execution meets the 
goals that the cycle wished to achieve.
In some places, improvements can be measured immediately, and in most cases, 
services need to be put under observation through monitoring, measuring, and reporting.
The expected target must meet or exceed the targets set by the customer, such 
as meeting or exceeding service-level agreement measurements, ensuring process 
compliance is high, and determining if the other measurements were met or exceeded.
8.3.6  How Do We Keep the Momentum Going?
As discussed earlier when I introduced Deming’s cycle, improvements rarely come in a 
one-off pattern but rather take shape in small incremental steps. To achieve this, the cycle 
needs to keep rolling, and the service provider organization must not lose the momentum 
it is mounted on.
The service provider organization must put in measures to ensure that the 
improvement cycles are well controlled, tracked, and made accountable for their objectives. 
Sufficient improvement budgets must be made available well in advance to ensure that the 
organization does not lose momentum while the search for funds takes place.
8.4  CSI Register
A CSI register is a tracker for all identified CSI initiatives. It is a part of the service 
knowledge management system (SKMS). It is owned by somebody such as a CSI manager 
who is responsible for keeping it current and accessible to all stakeholders. In smaller 
organizations that cannot afford a dedicated position for this task, the problem manager 
steps in to take over.
This register consists of all the CSI initiatives, along with their category, priority, the 
teams involved, statuses, and other administrative details. The purpose of a CSI register 
is to bring together all the initiatives into a single repository and provide visibility to the 
service provider and customer organizations on the CSI initiatives and their respective 
lifecycle statuses.
The priority of the CSI initiatives is set by the customer, and based on this priority, 
improvement activities are initiated for solution and implementation. A higher priority 
improvement activity gets initiated first with stringent timelines, whereas you can expect 
a lower priority improvement action to be slotted if there is slack in the system or for 
when the resources have free time.
A CSI register can be as simple as an Excel sheet with various columns indicating 
necessary fields and details. Today, there are a number of IT Service Management 
(ITSM) tools that provide CSI register functionality, and these are fitted with abilities to 

Chapter 8 ■ Continual Service Improvement
217
autoremind action owners before the milestone deadlines and will send out automated 
reports as per the crystal reporting structure.
8.5  Baselines
When you develop reports on performance achieved or any other similar reports, it 
is important to have a threshold defined. The performance threshold acts as a point 
of comparison, and it helps provide the context for the improvements or downturns. 
This threshold is called a baseline in ITIL. We use baselines in a number of processes 
in ITIL, such as creating configuration baselines in the service asset and configuration 
management process.
In CSI lifecycle phase, the baselines play an important role in measuring the level of 
improvement that was brought about through the undertaken improvement initiatives. It 
provides a basis for the extent of the improvements applied.
When a baseline is drawn, it needs to be documented, circulated, and agreed upon 
by all involved stakeholders to achieve transparency and agreement of the comparison 
marker. Baselines come in different levels: strategic, tactical, and operational baselines. 
When baselines are created, they need to be examined at all three levels.
If a baseline is not obtained before embarking on an improvement project, the 
extent of improvements achieved will be questioned, and the measurements taken 
postimprovements will be set as the baseline for upcoming improvements.
8.6  Types of Metrics
The performed improvements need to be measured to determine whether they have 
accomplished their intended purpose. This is achieved through metrics, which is defined 
in ITIL CSI as a scale of measurement defined in terms of a standard (well-defined unit).
Let’s say that you have performed an improvement initiative to reduce the overall 
number of incidents. How do you measure it? Through metrics. For this example, the 
number of incidents logged in a calendar month is the metric that provides the needed 
measurement to vet whether the improvement has been effective. Generally speaking, 
metrics provide the quantitative view of the activity or the process or anything that needs 
to be measured.
Metrics are generally tailor made for the activity you are trying to measure. A metric 
defined for one activity cannot be readily used for another activity. Let’s say that you have 
another requirement for a metric to measure the percentage of failed changes in a month. 
You cannot use the incident metric to measure this.
For failed changes, you need a separate metric:
Percentage of failed changes in a calendar month  
= (failed changes / overall changes) × 100
However, there are some generic metrics, such as number of incidents, number of 
changes, and percentage of service uptime, that can be used across the board.

Chapter 8 ■ Continual Service Improvement
218
Metrics come in three types to aid measuring CSI initiatives or any other activity that 
needs measuring:
	
1.	
Technology metrics
	
2.	
Process metrics
	
3.	
Service metrics
8.6.1  Technology Metrics
Technology metrics are the quantification of individual technological components such as 
measurements for servers, routers, applications, and so forth. They measure the effectiveness 
and efficiency of the components. These should be examined for various reasons:
	
1.	
They serve as an indicator to pinpoint faulty components in 
the system (which can possibly replaced)
	
2.	
If less than normal performing components are identified, 
either the design or its configurations can be analyzed and 
improved upon.
	
3.	
Component warranty can be invoked to obtain working 
components.
Examples include server uptime, number of breakdowns of a switch, or time taken 
for reindexing a database.
8.6.2  Process Metrics
Process metrics measure the effectiveness and efficiency of a process. These metrics are 
determined through critical success factors (CSF) and key performance indicators (KPIs). 
All the ITIL processes can be measured, and because measurements are the basis for 
assessing baselines and improvements, process metrics are employed. Every process  
will have specific process metrics. A process metric for a particular process cannot be 
applied for another process. Examples include average resolution time for incidents, 
percentage of changes rejected by CAB, and the number of knowledge articles created in 
a calendar month.
8.6.3  Service Metrics
Service metrics measure the effectiveness and efficiency of a service. These metrics are 
applied to measure end-to-end service performance. When we refer to service metrics, 
it is always end to end and not subsets of a service. At times it may be challenging to 
measure a service end to end. In such cases, we leverage technology and process metrics 
to derive service metrics. Examples include the percentage of uptime for Internet service, 
the number of transactions performed by a business application in an hour, and the 
average call drop rate in a calendar month.

Chapter 8 ■ Continual Service Improvement
219
8.7  CSFs and KPIs
The governance, tracking, and monitoring for services, processes, and projects are 
performed through two key concepts: critical success factors and key performance 
indicators. These two set the base for creating metrics and measurements and are also 
utilized to identify whether the improvements are effective. They are also employed to 
track the overall performance of various IT services, processes, and related activities.
8.7.1  Critical Success Factors
The official definition of a critical success factor, according to the ITIL CSI publication,  
is something that must happen if an IT service, process, plan, project, or other activity is 
to succeed.
In essence, for an IT service or an ITIL process to succeed, there are certain CSFs 
identified during the definition phase. These CSFs provide the various elements that are 
needed to achieve all the objectives set forth.
For example, “safeguard ATM machines” is a CSF in the banking industry, more 
specifically in the money disbursal services that the bank offers its customers. So for 
the money disbursal to happen successfully, it is critical that the ATM machines are 
safeguarded from thieves, skimmers, and hackers. It is a common occurrence in countries 
such as India where ATM machines are wheeled away in the middle of the night. In 
African and American countries, there have been countless cases of ATMs being rigged 
to capture the debit card information. To counteract this, the CSF mentioned in this 
example sets the direction.
Let’s look at an IT example that we are familiar with. “Assess changes for risk and 
impact” is a CSF for the change management process. To elaborate, all changes need to 
be assessed for potential risks and impact before they are allowed to be implemented. 
This is necessary in the interests of the business and for service continuity. This CSF for 
the change management process ensures that for the process to succeed, assessment 
must happen.
8.7.2  Key Performance Indicators
Key performance indicators (KPIs) are the key components used to measure success. 
Simply put, they define the measure and the trends that make or break the output of a 
process or a project.
As the name states, they are performance indicators, and they indicate whether the 
performance is on the expected lines or going downhill.
In the IT service management industry, we use KPIs to measure the outcome of an IT 
service, a process, or a function.
Defining a KPI is an art driven by the maturity of an individual or the organization. 
It is of prime importance to identify individuals who can make a particular activity a 
stunning success or a lame duck. Identifying KPIs is not as easy as differentiating white 
from black, but rather is like picking out iron filings from a heap of sand. You need to use 
the magnetic wand, which in this case is the diligence of a mature professional.

Chapter 8 ■ Continual Service Improvement
220
For the ATM example stated earlier, the KPIs can be defined as: “Number of thefts 
decreased in a calendar month; decrease in percentage of hacked ATMs.” These KPIs 
provide the desired trend that will set the wheels rolling toward achieving the objectives 
of a service or a process or anything that is being measured.
In the IT example, KPIs can be defined: “Decrease in percentage of failed changes in 
a calendar month.” This KPI provides the desired trend (to reduce failed changes), and 
this can be achieved by assessing changes. The direction comes from the CSF and the 
measurements are analyzed through KPIs.
8.7.2.1  Some Examples of KPIs
Here are some examples of KPIs. They will help you define KPIs that are real KPIs and not 
just metrics or numbers:
	
1.	
Percentage increase of projects completed on time
	
2.	
Percentage increase in solved homicide cases in the city of 
New York
	
3.	
Percentage increase in the salary YOY
8.7.3  Relationship Between CSFs and KPIs
CSFs and KPIs are closely related. CSFs provide the high-level direction to be followed for 
the subject to succeed. The KPIs use the CSFs, or rather work within the boundaries of 
them, to define a desired trend. Every CSF can have one or multiple KPIs associated with 
it. You can clearly see this in the ATM example used above. For the single CSF, I provided 
two KPIs.
8.7.3.1  What Does ITIL Recommend?
The ITIL publication recommends that for every CSF, there needs to be at least two KPIs, 
but not more than five KPIs, to make processes and services efficient and effective.
In IT service management, it is a common practice for the KPIs to change over 
time. Normally, CSFs remain unaltered as they provide general direction for services 
and processes to succeed. However, KPIs are dependent on the environment, changes, 
updates, and other factors that matter to a service or a process and may change from time 
to time.
Figure 8-4 illustrates the relationship of CSFs to KPIs, starting from the vision I 
discussed earlier in the chapter that triggers the mission statement an organization will 
follow. This is followed by the objectives that are set at every level. Objectives of a process 
or a service provide the boundaries for CSFs to operate. Based on CSFs, the KPIs are 
defined. Metrics take the input from KPIs to identify what needs to be measured, with 
measurements being the final block in the chain.

Chapter 8 ■ Continual Service Improvement
221
8.7.4  Seven-Step Improvement Process
There is just one process in the CSI lifecycle phase. The seven-step improvement process 
is based on the PDCA cycle and is derived from the CSI approach (both were discussed 
earlier in the chapter).
The seven steps also follow the knowledge management’s data-information-
knowledge-wisdom model, called the knowledge spiral, because the activities are set to 
be performed in cycles.
As mentioned earlier, CSI stretches across the other four lifecycle phases and can be 
triggered in any of the phases to identify and implement improvements. Figure 8-5 shows 
the steps involved in the seven-step improvement process. The details of the process are 
discussed in the sections below.
Vision
Mission
Goals
Objectives
CSF
KPI
Metrics
Measurments
Figure 8-4.  Relations from vision down to measurements

Chapter 8 ■ Continual Service Improvement
222
8.7.4.1  Step 1: Identify the Strategy for Improvement
The organization’s leadership provides the vision, mission, and objectives to identify and 
implement improvements across the lifecycle. They can set specific targets to be achieved 
in each of the areas: strategy, design, transition, and operations. In most organizations, 
CSI is implemented in the design, transition, and operations lifecycle phases only. 
Strategy is normally left out of the scope, perhaps for reasons owing to junior resources 
manning the CSI activities.
8.7.4.2  Step 2: Define What You Will Measure
Once you have the scope established and objectives documented, you will have clarity 
on what activities need to be measured in order to measure improvements against the 
objectives. Referring to Figure 8-4 and comparing it with the service lifecycle, vision, 
mission, goals, and objectives are established in the service strategy phase. The CSF, KPI, 
metrics, and measurements are defined and designed in the service design phase.
1.  Identify the stragegy for
      improvement
2.  Define what you will
measure
Apply
7.  Implement improvement
3.  Gather the data
       •    Who? How? When?
       •    Criteria to evaluate
             integrity of data
       •    Operational goals
       •    Service measurement
4.  Process the data
       •    Frequency?
       •    Format?
       •    Tools and systems?
       •    Accuracy?
6.  Present and use the
      information
       •    Assessment summary
       •    Action plans
       •    Etc.
5.  Analyse the information
      and data
       •    Trends?
       •    Targets?
       •    Improvements required?
 •    Vision
 •    Business need
 •    Strategy
 •    Tactical goals
 •    Opeartional goal

Chapter 8 ■ Continual Service Improvement
223
8.7.4.3  Step 3: Gather the Data
In this step, based on the objectives, data are gathered through various sources. Data can 
come from the event management tools, service reports, feedback from the customer, 
feedback from the supplier, government regulations, and so forth.
This step concentrates on just getting the data and collating it. Analysis is not in scope.
8.7.4.4  Step 4: Process the Data
The data come from various sources, and they are in different formats. They need to be 
standardized to aid in analysis activities.
Processing of data and publishing the processed data must work in a cycle or in strict 
timelines based on the CSFs and KPIs.
8.7.4.5  Step 5: Analyze the Data
Data analysis and documenting conclusions are done in this step. This step starts to 
analyze the who, what, when, where, and how questions.
Conclusions are drawn based on the CSFs and KPIs that are in place, for example, if 
the KPI specifies that the desired trend is for incidents to decrease, the analysis presents a 
negative conclusion when incidents increase month after month.
This is an important step that requires the maximum amount of unwavering effort to 
analyze and present the right information to the management.
8.7.4.6  Step 6: Present and Use the Information
In this step, the analysis is presented to the management. It focuses on comparison 
between the improvement objectives against the actual implementation results. It tries to 
answer the question: Did we get there?
8.7.4.7  Step 7: Implement Improvements
Not all improvements identified are approved for implementation. The management 
makes a judgment call based on the business case. Most improvements identified come 
with an associated cost factor, some justified and some not. For example, a particular 
improvement may cost a huge sum of money but the expected output may improve by a 
small percentage. In business lingo, this means management might not find a viable return 
on investment on some improvements, which are eventually put on the back burner.
At the end of this step, a new baseline is set, which will be used for the improvements 
in the next cycle.

Chapter 8 ■ Continual Service Improvement
224
8.7.5  Objectives of Seven-Step Improvement Process
The seven-step improvement process is the only process listed in the CSI phase. It 
therefore inherits all the objectives of the phase and is solely responsible and accountable 
for identifying and implementing the process activities.
The objectives of the process include:
• 
Identify improvement opportunities across service management 
areas: services, processes, tools, governance.
• 
Cost is a major factor in service delivery. CSI has the onus to 
reduce the cost of providing services to customers, without 
affecting the quality of the service.
• 
Keep a finger on the pulse of what is being delivered to the 
customer and whether it is in line with the expectations. If it is 
misaligned, it is the responsibility of CSI to take corrective actions.
• 
Identify the metrics and measurements across services, processes, 
and tools to establish improvement opportunities.
8.7.6  Scope of Seven-Step Improvement Process
As discussed earlier, the CSI phase is leveraged. Its scope includes:
• 
Ensuring IT services, processes, technologies leveraged, 
suppliers, partners, and all activities are performed in the ITIL 
service lifecycle.
• 
Ensuring that the alignment of the current and future services 
offered is in line with the market offerings and customer’s 
expectations.
• 
Keeping a tab on technological advancements to introduce  
state-of-the-art IT services that provide value, and reduce the cost 
of services.
• 
Examining the functions, and whether they are rightly staffed 
with people with specific capabilities who are placed in the right 
teams; if there is a lack of capability found, ensuring corrective 
actions are taken by the functional heads.

8.9  Summary
In this chapter, I described the continual service improvement lifecycle phase and 
explained Deming’s PDCA cycle. I also touched on the CSI approach and the seven-step 
improvement processes. I also presented a number of ITIL concepts such as baselines, 
metrics, CSI register, CSFs, and KPIs.
In the next chapter, the final chapter, you will learn some tips that will help you pass 
the exam with flying colors. Also, I will provide answers to FAQs about ITIL-based careers.

CHAPTER 9
ITIL Foundation Exam Tips 
and Tricks
Before anything else, preparation is the key to success.
—Alexander Graham Bell
To acquire knowledge, one must study; but to acquire wisdom, one must 
observe.
—Marilyn vos Savant
The ITIL Foundation examination is one of the most sought after examinations in 
the service industry. It is considered mandatory during employment in most of the 
organizations that provide IT services to customers.
I attended ITIL v2 training when I got started with service management. This was 
more than a decade ago. I did not pass the practice exam. I was flabbergasted. Then I sat 
down for the next two days trying to decipher the question pattern, the clues, and the 
giveaways. In the next practice exam, I scored 80%, and on the paper-based ITIL exam,  
I got just one question wrong. Still, I hadn’t recovered from my failure in the first practice 
exam. I felt that it was the trainer’s responsibility to help in the preparations for the 
certification exam. The trainer should have been there and done that, so he would be in 
the best position to provide an overview of the lay of the land. This is exactly what I plan 
to do in this chapter.
My training experience has further deepened my knowledge of the Foundation 
examination. I sometimes feel that I can read the question setter’s mind. Not really! I 
have shared the tips that I am going to share with you in this chapter with my students, 
and more than 90% of my students have passed the examination in their first attempt. 
Moreover, a good number of my students have opted for my trainings in the ITIL Expert 
certification courses as well.
In this chapter, I will not only provide information on the ITIL Foundation 
examination, but I will also provide details on the more complicated certifications that 
follow the ITIL Foundation certification. As promised earlier, I will provide tips and tricks 
for answering the questions on the exam. Last but not the least, I will answer the most 
commonly asked questions regarding career choices that ITIL brings to the table.

Chapter 9 ■ ITIL Foundation Exam Tips and Tricks

9.1  ITIL Certification Structure
Axelos, entrusted with the responsibility to develop, manage, and operate the good 
practices in service management through the ITIL Framework, offers a number of 
certification exams for individuals, based on depth of knowledge and the intentions for 
getting certified. Remember that organizations cannot get ITIL certified. If they wish to 
get certified on ITIL Framework, they have to opt for ISO 20000 certification. The ISO 
20000 certification is also based on ITIL.
The various ITIL certifications are depicted in Figure 9-1.
9.1.1  ITIL Foundation Certificate
ITIL Foundation certification is the test of ITIL concepts and awareness. It is ideally suited 
for entry-level professionals in the IT services industry.
Most ITIL-based jobs are in service operations, and for a service operations role, 
the ITIL Foundation certification is considered adequate. As most service organizations 
operate on the ITIL Framework, they expect new employees to hit the ground running 
when they start. For this to happen, there needs to be an alignment of processes,

terminology, and the ways of working. This is primarily the reason for employers to insist 
on the ITIL Foundation certification.
People often change career paths within the same organization. To change into a 
service management role, organizations insist that employees undergo ITIL training and 
probably be certified before the transition.
I have also had students who are primarily from the projects side of the industry, and 
they were keen to understand how the services operate, and to get the general awareness 
of IT service management, they took the ITIL Foundation certification course.
To sum it up, ITIL Foundation is for all those who are interested in getting a foothold 
in the IT service management space.
ITIL FOUNDATION EXAM FORMAT

9.2  ITIL Examination Providers
As discussed in Chapter 1, Axelos is the organization that owns the ITIL Framework. 
The company is a joint venture between the UK government and Capita. The ITIL 
publications were created by a massive team of ITIL experts and masters. When you read 
the publication, if you are sensitive to writing styles, you can observe the different styles 
across various sections and books.
However, Axelos does not conduct exams on their own, but instead, have partnered 
with examination institutes to conduct exams and to accredit training organizations and 
trainers. At the time of writing, the authorized examination institutes are:
• 
APMG International
• 
EXIN
• 
PeopleCert
• 
BCS, Learning and Development Ltd
• 
Acquiros
The most popular ones are APMG International and EXIN. The examination 
institutes frame their own question papers, based on the framework laid out by Axelos.
9.3  Foundation Exam Tips and Tricks
I first became ITIL Foundation certified in its second version: ITIL v2. I had worked for at 
least four years in this ITIL version before I became ITIL v3 certified. There was a world 
of change between the two versions, and for me, it was relooking at ITIL from whole 
different angle, and even after working in ITIL principles, I had to go through the cycle of 
exam preparation and the nerves on the exam day.
ITIL v3 was not as popular as it is now, and there weren’t too many people to  
guide you along. It was strenuous but heartwarming when the PASS result was displayed 
on the screen.
When I started training for ITIL, I became aware of a number of techniques, patterns, 
and shortcuts that one could use to pass the ITIL exam. When you see exam papers for 
too long, you pick up the intricate details, variations, and patterns. The techniques I 
advocated worked as I expected, and my students, who attended a day and a half training 
session, were in a good position to take and pass the exam. I never asked them to study at 
home after the first day. It was not needed.
In this section, I will pass on the tips and tricks that have helped my students all along.
9.3.1  Preparation
Reading this book in its entirety is sufficient. I don’t expect you to read any other material 
to pass the exam. However, the information provided in this book is based on the ITIL 
Foundation examination syllabus. There is much more to ITIL than what I have touched 
upon. My recommendation is that you just stick to this book before you take the ITIL 

Chapter 9 ■ ITIL Foundation Exam Tips and Tricks

Foundation exam. When you are ITIL certified, then start reading the ITIL publications 
and other advanced ITIL books for getting deeper into the ITIL concepts. Of course, 
you have the hierarchy of ITIL exams, and that should also help you become closely 
acquainted with the Framework.
When I planned to take the ITIL v3 Foundation certification, I took off from work the 
previous day and studied for about five hours. As I mentioned earlier, it was sufficient for 
me as I was getting certified from a previous version, and I had ample working experience 
in ITIL. I don’t expect the same to work for you. If it does, or even you cut down the time, 
kudos to you!
Here are my tips and tricks for preparing for the exam:
	
1.	
Get ITIL Foundation Certified in 7 Days is all that you need 
to pass the ITIL Foundation exam. I have broken down the 
book into seven sections based on a working professional’s 
self-study availability. However, you know your schedule the 
best. Feel free to alter the timelines based on your schedule. 
However, I insist that you prepare a study plan before you start 
reading the book. Do not read the book by aiming to complete 
as much as possible.
	
2.	
Schedule the ITIL Foundation exam from one of the 
examination institutes (EI) before you start preparing for 
the exam. If you study first and then schedule the exam, you 
would be looking at a moving target for the exam date, and 
this, in my experience, is prone to failure.
	
3.	
Take plenty of notes. Although all the information you need 
is in printed form, it is not nearly equivalent to writing down 
your own notes, in your own hand and in your own words. 
Make notes at every juncture, including the tips and tricks that 
I am offering you in this chapter. Research has proven that 
taking notes helps you understand concepts better and helps 
you ask the right questions.
	
4.	
ITIL is old-school when it comes to definitions and keywords. 
Success on the exam stems from identifying the right 
keywords in the questions and the answer choices. So, it is 
imperative that you learn the definitions for ITIL concepts, 
or at least be familiar with the keywords. For example, 
an incident is a disruption to a service. The keyword to 
remember is disruption in this case. The objective of change 
management is to enable beneficial changes to be made and 
minimize disruption to IT services. In this definition, the 
keywords to remember are enable beneficial changes and 
minimize disruptions. Likewise, find the keywords, circle 
them, highlight them, underline them, do whatever is going to 
help you commit them to memory.

5.	
ITIL is best learned through examples. I have provided ample 
examples in this book. I encourage you to come up with your 
own examples to help you understand the topics better. If you 
have any questions on the topics presented in this book, reach 
out to me on my blog: http://abhinavpmp.com. I have helped 
thousands of ITIL seekers since 2009 through my blog, and I 
will answer your questions too.
9.3.2  Mock Exams
It is common with any certification that you attempt a few mock papers after you have 
studied all the topics. The same goes with ITIL Foundation exam. Here are some tips in 
relation to taking mock exams:
	
1.	
Axelos has provided a sample paper that you can 
download from their web site: https://www.axelos.com/
certifications/sample-papers. You are required to register 
before you can download it.
	
2.	
Do not do the ITIL sample question paper before you have 
completed reading this entire book. Sample papers must be 
used to gauge where you stand in terms of understandability, 
and it is best leveraged when this entire book has been read, 
understood, jotted down, and digested.
	
3.	
Answer the Axelos sample immediately after you have 
completed this entire book. This will give you a good handle 
on how well you have understood the ITIL Framework. The 
real exam will be in the same pattern as this one, so in all 
probability, you can expect to find a few questions directly 
picked from the sample paper as well.
	
4.	
APMG is one of the EIs used to manage the ITIL Framework 
before Axelos was awarded the contract. They used to provide 
two sample papers. They are not available presently on the 
APMG web site. However, they do have a mock online exam 
that you can take: http://www.apmg-exams.com/index.aspx?
subid=4&masterid=3#
	
5.	
There are a number of ITIL questions available on the 
Internet. Try to answer as many as possible. I cannot 
guarantee all the questions will be of the same quality as the 
exam questions, however, by the time you have completed 
the two sample papers, you will have a fair idea on what is a 
probable question and what isn’t.

9.3.3  Examination Day
D-day brings in plenty of permutations: what ifs rule and the succeeding thoughts blur 
the machinations of ITIL that you have ingested over the past week or so. So, it is my rule 
of thumb to get plenty of sleep the night before, and then on the exam day, I don’t review 
the material, and will probably watch a movie or a TV show to keep my mind off the 
clutter. But there is a lot more to the examination day, here they are:
	
1.	
I would try and schedule the exam in the first half of the day, 
when you are fresh and energetic.
	
2.	
It is important for you to know that the ITIL Foundation exam 
does not pose trick questions, where questions are twisted in a 
way to confuse candidates. The questions are straightforward 
as they are trying to test your awareness of ITIL concepts.
	
3.	
The ITIL Foundation exam is a test of the awareness of the 
concepts. The trickiest questions that you will encounter are 
those with negative connotations: Which of these is NOT a . . . ?
	
4.	
Read the question, fully, completely, and accurately. 
Understand what is being asked. Check and double check 
whether the question is in a negative connotation. After you 
understand the question, look at the answer choices.
	
5.	
You have 60 minutes to complete 40 questions. That’s 1.5 
minutes for every question, which is plenty of time in my 
opinion. Around half the questions on the exam would be 
straightforward, which can help you move on within half a 
minute. And there are some (in minority) that will make you 
think. Take time where you need it.
	
6.	
There will be some questions that you may not be confident 
of and need some time to think over. In such a scenario, leave 
the question unanswered and move ahead. Take on the easy 
and simple ones first, and then go back to the tougher ones.
	
7.	
There are no negative markings, a wrong answer doesn’t end 
up deducting marks from the overall score. So you should at 
least attempt to answer all the questions.
	
8.	
Important one! If you are already working in an ITIL 
environment, students often answer ITIL Foundation 
examination based on their work experience rather than what 
they have studied in this book. Never make that mistake. What 
your organization has implemented may be a flavor of ITIL, 
with plenty of customizations. And what is offered in this book 
is pure ITIL, verbatim. So unlearn what you do at work and 
learn the ITIL concepts. Only use these concepts on the exam.

Chapter 9 ■ ITIL Foundation Exam Tips and Tricks
238
	
9.	
There is a simple way to spot the right answer. After you 
have read and understood the question, go through the 
four possible answers. Instead of picking the right answer, 
eliminate the incorrect ones first. Out of the four, two 
generally look highly unlikely. Then you are left with two 
possible answers to choose from, and this should be a 
cakewalk if you have read and understood the concepts as 
explained in this book.
	
10.	
A friend of mine believes that he gets the answer based on his 
first instinct. So he normally does not change his answer once 
he gets that feeling. He is an extraordinarily smart person, 
so for him, his first instinct is mostly the right direction. But 
I would not suggest that you take this approach too. When 
you read and reread the question and possible answers, you 
will start to frame the context, the interfaces, and the possible 
answers in your mind. This will help you come up with the 
right answer.
	
11.	
If you are working on a paper-based exam, be sure to 
darken the circles on the Optical Mark Reader (OMR) sheet 
completely. Since the answer papers are machine fed, you 
may end up losing out on half-shaded answers.
9.4  BONUS: FAQs on ITIL-Based Careers
On my blog and on my YouTube channel, many IT professionals, experiences ranging 
from debuts to those with ten years of experience, often ask me questions related to 
ITIL-based careers. Though hundreds of queries have come my way, the nature and the 
direction of the queries are similar. In this section, I will provide a list of frequently asked 
questions (FAQ) regarding careers in ITIL and answer them.
9.4.1  How Different Is ITIL from Project Management?
ITIL is a framework for service management. The activities that are performed as part of 
service management are generally perpetual, meaning that you will not have a definite 
end date. Project management, on the other hand, is finite. It has definite start and 
end dates. The project ceases to exist after it has ended, and then you generally move 
on to another project. To summarize, ITIL and project management are on different 
hemispheres. However, they do interface when you run service management projects 
such as upgrading the datacenter, optimization of a database, and decommissioning of 
mainframe computers.

239
9.4.2  Do I Need an IT Background to Become ITIL 
Certified?
You don’t become ITIL certified for the heck of it, right? You try to find a role in line 
with ITIL and become employable through the certification. If you do not have an IT 
background, you can become ITIL Foundation certified, as long as you understand 
the concepts. However, for you to just start working in an ITIL organization, it will be 
a massive hill to climb. ITIL concepts are used in the workplace closely with the IT 
topologies and frameworks, and the disability sans IT knowledge will leave you wanting 
in every activity hurdle that you come across. My advice is that you enroll yourself 
in some IT training as well to become aware of the IT infrastructure, networks, and 
applications. To summarize, there is no ITIL without IT.
9.4.3  I Am in Software Development. I Want to Change 
My Career to ITIL-Based. What Can I Pick Up?
Software development follows project management methodology. Software support, 
however, works on service management. So if you want to switch over in a technical area, 
software support is the area that you should aim for. If you are interested in moving over 
to the management side of things, all the roles that ITIL has to offer are up for grabs. But 
for starters, you can aim at managing incidents by working as an incident manager or 
managing changes by working as a change manager. In short, on the management side of 
things, the roles are pretty interchangeable if you have the right kind of mindset for it.
For example, if you are a methodical and organized person, I recommend a change 
to a manager’s role. If you are a communicator who can bring parties together, and if you 
like action, incident manager is the role to move into. And if you are the investigative type 
of a person, problem manager should be your pick.
9.4.4  What Are the Entry-Level Roles in ITIL?
Service desk is the most popular entry-level role in ITIL. Other roles that are offered 
to start are service reporting, operations control (monitoring batch runs), request 
fulfillment, and access management roles.
However, every organization might tag certain roles as entry level depending on their 
maturity and the expectations of their customers. I have seen certain organizations hire 
IT professionals with barely a year of experience as incident and problem managers. I 
have my reservations against hiring inexperienced professionals for such roles. I believe 
that these roles are developed with experience, and a less-experienced person may not 
see all the aspects that an experienced campaigner would be able to address.

Chapter 9 ■ ITIL Foundation Exam Tips and Tricks
240
9.4.5  What Is the Normal Role Progression in Service 
Operations?
Service operations offers the most number of jobs in any service provider organization. 
When it comes to progression, service desk followed by request fulfillment and 
access management are considered junior-level roles. The next role hierarchy in 
service operations is an incident manager followed by a problem manager. In some 
organizations, incident management is placed above problem management, as 
incidents are viewed as critical over problems. Incident management roles are divided 
into incident manager and major incident managers. The major incident managers are 
often experienced professionals with over ten years of ITIL experience under their belts. 
Although change management is a process under service transition, for most practical 
purposes, the roles are considered as service operations. Change manager roles are 
considered in line with the problem manager roles.
9.4.6  What Are the Technical Roles in ITIL?
There are a number of technical roles in ITIL. The processes that I discussed under 
service design offer technical ITIL roles. For example, an availability manager is expected 
to understand the technicalities of a service, infrastructure, and applications involved. 
An information security manager must have additional IT security-related certifications 
like CISA to be effective in the role. In service operations as well, the event manager plays 
a technical role rather than a management role. Other roles include the release manager, 
capacity manager, and IT service continuity manager, among others.
9.4.7  I Am Excellent at Customer Service. What Role 
Should I Aim for?
I recommend customer-facing roles for those who have a natural ability to connect 
and build rapport with people. These roles include the service-level manager, business 
relationship manager, and service delivery manager. Also, you will have sales roles in 
all organizations, where you are expected to meet customers and showcase the service 
management capabilities.
9.4.8  What Is the ITIL Role That You Have Enjoyed the 
Most?
This question was posed to me about five years ago. My answer was different then, it 
will be different now, and I am sure in years to come, it will change again based on my 
experiences in IT service management.
To answer the question, I enjoy working as a consultant. My job involves finding a 
solution to a business or a management problem, and providing all the plans necessary to 
implement it. The job involves plenty of customer interactions, makes full use of my ITIL 
expertise, and the short terms associated with consulting projects ensure that I don’t get 
saturated over time.

241
9.4.9  What Roles Can I Play with the ITIL Foundation 
Certification?
Most of the roles are available for someone with an ITIL Foundation certification. 
However, if you want to grow within the ITIL environment and with the growing 
competition, it is important that you step on the gas and take the ITIL Intermediate 
certification to start with, and then aim for ITIL Expert certification.
9.4.10  What Do I Have to Do to Become Highly 
Successful in IT Service Management?
If you wish to succeed, then you must be a lifelong learner. There are many things to 
learn, everyday. ITIL is a service management framework. Likewise, you have COBIT 
that is picking up speed. COBIT aims at strengthening the governance framework and 
it interfaces seamlessly with ITIL. Devops is the flavor of the season. Most software 
organizations are moving into a devops environment, which is an integrated organization 
that works in both the development and support areas. If you are a quality buff, Six Sigma 
will give value to your brand and will help you progress.
The bottom line is that you identify what you are good at, where you want to be, and 
start to learn toward your target. Nothing is impossible to conquer, and you can do it if 
you have the right guidance and the willpower to carry you through.
9.5  Summary
In this chapter, I explained the various ITIL certifications that exist and the pertinent 
information regarding the certification examinations. Further, I offered plenty of advice, 
tips, and tricks for passing the ITIL Foundation exam. Lastly, I answered some questions 
regarding ITIL-based careers.
