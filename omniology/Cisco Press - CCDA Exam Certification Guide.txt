Introduction to CCDA
So you have worked on Cisco devices for a while, designing networks for your customers, and now you want to get cer-
tiﬁed? There are several good reasons to do so. Cisco’s certiﬁcation program permits network analysts and engineers to 
demonstrate their competence in different areas of networking and at different levels. The prestige and respect that come 
with a Cisco certiﬁcation will deﬁnitely help you in your career. Your clients, peers, and superiors will recognize you as 
an expert in networking.
In the Cisco Routing and Switching career certiﬁcation path, there are two certiﬁcation tracks: the Network Design 
track, with which this book is concerned, and the Network Support track. Figure I-1 illustrates the various levels of the 
two design tracks for Cisco Routing and Switching career certiﬁcation. Note that Cisco Certiﬁed Design Associate 
(CCDA) is the entry-level certiﬁcation in the Network Design track.

The test to obtain CCDA certiﬁcation is called Designing Cisco Networks (DCN) Exam #640-441. This is a computer-
based test that currently consists of between 80 and 90 questions and has a 120-minute time limit. All exam registrations 
are made by calling Sylvan Prometric at 1-800-204-3926. The cost for the exam is $100 USD. Throughout this book, 
you will see the exam referred to as the DCN exam or the CCDA exam; they are the same exam for the purposes of this 
text.
The DCN exam measures your ability to design networks that meet certain requirements for performance, security, 
capacity, and scalability. The exam is focused on small- to medium-sized networks. The candidate should have at least 
one year of experience in the design of small- to medium-sized networks using Cisco products. A CCDA candidate 
should have an understanding of internetworking technologies, including network topologies, routing, switching, WAN 
technologies, LAN protocols, and network management. Cisco suggests taking the Designing Cisco Networks self-
paced training material before you take the CCDA exam. For more information on the various levels of certiﬁcation, 
career tracks, and Cisco exams, go to the Cisco Learning Connection page of the Cisco Connection Online (CCO) Web 
site at http://www.cisco.com/certiﬁcations.
About This Book
CCDA Exam Certiﬁcation Guide is intended to help you prepare for the CCDA exam, recognize and improve your areas 
of weakness, and increase your chances of passing the test. The book is designed to provide you with mastery of the 
CCDA objectives. Because the scope of this book focuses on helping you master the CCDA exam objectives, the 
authors assume that readers have a certain level of internetworking knowledge. It is strongly recommended that you take 
the DCN course or acquire an equivalent amount of on-the-job training before solidifying your CCDA knowledge with 
the elements of this book. You might even want to review the extensive internetworking reference materials provided in 
the appendixes of this book.
At the beginning of each chapter you will ﬁnd a “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz to help you assess the degree to which 
you need to review the subject matter covered in that chapter. You may then read the entire chapter thoroughly or skip 
directly to only those sections and objectives that you need to review further. In addition, at the end of each chapter is a 
“Q&A” review quiz. Use this after you have read the chapter to determine your knowledge of the topics.
Objective of This Book
The objective of this book is to help you fully understand, remember, and recall all the details of the topics covered on 
the CCDA exam. If that objective is reached, passing the CCDA exam should follow easily. The CCDA exam will be a 
stepping stone for most people as they progress through the other Cisco certiﬁcations; passing the exam because of a 
thorough understanding and recall of the topics will be incredibly valuable at the next steps.
This book prepares you to pass the CCDA exam by doing the following:
•
Helping you discover which test topics you have not mastered
•
Providing explanations and information to fill in your knowledge gaps
•
Supplying exercises and case studies that enhance your ability to recall and deduce the answers to 
test questions
•
Providing a practice exam and exercises on the CD-ROM that will help you assess your overall 
progress and preparation level for the CCDA exam
Who Should Read This Book?
This book is intended to tremendously increase your chances of passing the CCDA exam. This book is intended for an 
audience who has taken the Designing Cisco Networks course or has an equivalent level of on-the-job experience. 
Although others may beneﬁt from using this book, the book is written assuming that you want to pass the exam.

xxi
So why should you want to pass CCDA? For one of many reasons: to get a raise; to show your manager you are working 
hard to increase your skills; to fulﬁll a manager’s requirement (before he will spend money on another course); to 
enhance your résumé; because you work in a presales job at a reseller and want to eventually become CCDP–certiﬁed; 
to prove you know the topic, if you learned via on-the-job experience rather than from taking the prerequisite classes—
or one of many other reasons.
Have You Mastered All the Exam Objectives?
The exam tests you on a wide variety of topics; most people will not remember all the topics on the exam. Because some 
study is required, this book focuses on helping you obtain the maximum beneﬁt from the time you spend preparing for 
the exam. You can access many other sources for the information covered on the exam; for example, you could read the 
Cisco Documentation CD. However, this book is the most effective way to prepare for the exam.
You should begin your exam preparation by spending ample time reviewing the exam objectives listed in the section 
“The CCDA Exam Objectives,” later in this introduction. Check out Cisco’s Web site for any future changes to the list of 
objectives.
How This Book Is Organized
The book begins with a chapter that generally deﬁnes the topics that will be covered by the CCDA exam. Before you 
begin studying for any exam, it is important that you know the topics that could be covered. With the CCDA exam, 
knowing what is on the exam is seemingly straightforward; Cisco publishes a list of CCDA objectives. However, the 
objectives are certainly open to interpretation.
Chapters 1 through 8 directly follow Cisco’s CCDA exam objectives and provide detailed information on each objec-
tive. Each chapter begins with a quiz so that you can quickly determine your current level of readiness. Each chapter 
ends with a review “Q&A” quiz as well as case study questions.
Appendix A, “Answers to Quiz Questions,” provides the answers to the various chapter quizzes. The answers to the case 
study questions can be found at the end of each chapter. 
Finally, in the back of the book you will ﬁnd an invaluable CD-ROM. It contains exercise questions on study cards and 
ﬂash cards that provide answer explanations and links to the appropriate section in an electronic version of the book. 
The CD-ROM also enables you to take a timed practice CCDA exam that is very similar in format to the actual CCDA 
exam you will be taking. The practice exam is complete with both general knowledge and case study questions and 
draws on your knowledge of all the published CCDA exam objectives. The practice exam has a database of more than 
200 questions, so you can test yourself more than once.
Features and Conventions of This Book
This book features the following:
•
Cross-Reference to CCDA Objectives—Cisco lists the objectives of the CCDA exam on its Web 
site. That list is included in this Introduction. The beginning of each core chapter will include a 
reference to the CCDA objectives discussed in that chapter. Each major section also begins with a 
list of the objectives covered in that section.
•
Do I Know This Already? Quiz—This beginning section of each chapter is designed to quiz you 
on the topics in that chapter. This gives you an opportunity to assess just how much you need to 
review the subject matter covered in that chapter.

xxii 
•
Foundation Topics—This section in each chapter explains and reviews topics that will be covered 
in the exam. Each section in the Foundation Topics begins with a list of objectives covered in that 
section and then follows up with extensive review of that subject matter. Foundation Topics sections 
are the bulk of the material in this book.
•
Foundation Summaries—Most of the major facts covered in each chapter are summarized in 
tables and charts in this section. This format enables you to review a chapter quickly, focusing on 
these summaries, so that you can solidify your knowledge of the major subject matter of the chapter.
•
Q&A—Each chapter contains a section of review questions. These questions test you on your 
retention of the knowledge presented in the Foundation Topics for that chapter.
•
Case Studies—Each chapter ends with case studies that include a battery of questions. These case 
studies are intended for use after you have reviewed the chapter and are ready to validate your 
mastery of the CCDA objectives presented in that chapter. Chapter 9, “Additional Case Studies,” is 
a complete chapter of new case studies that you should read and work on after you feel you have 
mastered all the objectives presented in the book. The CCDA exam will most likely include some 
questions based on a design case study.
•
Test Questions—Using the test engine on the CD-ROM, you can take simulated exams. You can 
also choose to be presented with several questions on an objective that you need more work on. This 
testing tool provides you with practice that will make you more comfortable when you actually take 
the CCDA exam.

Foundation Topics
Customer Objectives
The following CCDA objectives are covered in this section:
A CCDA should design networks based on the customer’s objectives. In other words, you will 
need to ﬁnd out what the customer wants to solve. You then must create a design that solves the 
networking problem or issue the customer is having.
The ﬁrst step in network design is to obtain the customer’s requirements. To obtain a complete 
picture of the customer’s objectives, the engineer needs to document the client’s business 
requirements, technical requirements, and any business and political constraints.
Business Requirements of the Customer
For this aspect of determining the customer’s objectives, think about the purpose of the project. 
Project how the business will improve. Find out if the network is affecting the company’s 
capability or effectiveness to develop, produce, and track products. Find out if any business 
applications are being affected. Determine whether the company will be audited.
Scalability is a very important consideration, and it is wise for the network designer to build a 
network that can scale. You should ﬁgure out how much the company will grow in one year or 
in ﬁve years.
Technical Requirements of the Customer
Think about the type of technical problems you are trying to solve. Consider the network’s 
topology. For example, it may be difﬁcult to introduce Ethernet to a customer that religiously 
uses Token Ring. Also consider the company’s use of modern technologies. Find out whether 
the client is willing to experiment with the latest, bleeding-edge technologies. Keep in mind 
scaling issues; decide whether switched Ethernet will provide the necessary bandwidth or 
whether Fast Ethernet is necessary to scale the network. 
1
Design a network that meets a customer’s requirements for performance, 
security, capacity, and scalability.
5
Document the customer’s current applications, protocols, topology, and 
number of users.
6
Document the customer’s business issues that are relevant to a network 
design project.

Customer Objectives     7
Technical requirements can be divided into the following areas:
•
Performance requirements
•
Applications requirements
•
Network management requirements
•
Security requirements
Performance Requirements
Determine the following performance requirements:
•
Identify any issues concerning network latency and response times.
•
Find out if there is high utilization on LAN segments or WAN links.
•
Determine how often the WAN links go down.
Application Requirements
Consider existing application integration. The network design will need to seamlessly 
accommodate the existing applications. Investigate the current application ﬂows, and 
incorporate those into the network design. Determine the following application requirements:
•
Find out what new applications have been introduced to the network.
•
Determine the number of users using these applications.
•
Find out the trafﬁc ﬂow for these applications.
•
Identify what new protocols are being introduced to the network.
•
Determine what applications are used during the daytime hours and what are used during 
the nighttime hours.
•
Determine the time of day that represents the peak usage hours of applications.
Network Management Requirements
Determine the following network management requirements:
•
Determine how the network is managed.
•
Determine whether there is a network management station to view network performance 
and faults.
•
Ascertain whether there are any accounting and security management requirements.
•
Find out whether the staff is training on the network management applications.
•
Find out whether there is a station for conﬁguration management.

8     Chapter 1: Design Goals
NOTE
Remember the acronym FCAPS: fault, conﬁguration, accounting, performance, and security 
management.
Security Requirements
Determine the following security requirements:
•
Determine what type of security is required.
•
Find out what external connections are present in the network and why they are there.
•
Determine whether additional security is required on Internet connections.
Business and Political Constraints
The ﬁnal aspect of determining the customer’s objectives is to identify any constraints. 
Consider the following and ascertain whether they are constraints in your design:
•
Ascertain budget or resource limitations for the project.
•
Determine the timeline to complete the project.
•
Determine whether any internal politics play a role in the decision-making process. Find 
out what different sources or groups are providing input into the requirements.
•
Make sure the client’s staff is able to operate and manage the new network.
•
Find out whether the customer wants to reuse or trade in any existing equipment 
The network design must be cost-effective and efﬁcient. The goal is to get the best solution at 
a reasonable price. For example, a Catalyst 5500 may not be best solution for a remote ofﬁce 
LAN with only 14 users.
Framework for Small- to Medium-Sized Network Design
The following CCDA objective is covered in this section:
3
Upon completion of this introduction, you will be able to describe a 
framework you can use to simplify the complexities associated with 
analyzing customer network problems and creating Cisco scalable solutions.

Steps for Network Design     9
As you gather information from the customer, keep in mind that Cisco has proposed a 
framework to use when designing complex small to medium-sized networks. The framework 
proposes the following rules (which are summarized in Figure 1-1):
•
If the problems are protocol-related, use routing. Many LAN protocols use periodic 
broadcasts and service advertisements and do not scale well as the network size increases. 
Routers can be used to further subnet your network and reduce broadcast domains. Access 
and security policies can be applied on routers.
•
If the problem involves media contention, use LAN switching. To expand on this rule, if 
you have too many nodes on a shared network, you will expect to have high utilization; 
devices will have to compete to obtain access to the network, and application response 
may be slow. Introducing LAN switching will help resolve the contention on the network.
•
If high bandwidth is required, consider switched Fast Ethernet. Switched Fast Ethernet 
offers a good cost-to-performance ratio for small to medium-sized networks. For larger 
networks in which high bandwidth and low latency is required, use ATM. Gigabit Ethernet 
now provides another option in the LAN for the backbone and for bandwidth-intensive 
application servers.

10     Chapter 1: Design Goals
The steps for designing a network are as follows:
1 Gather information to support the business and technical requirements.
2 Assess the current network.
3 Consider the applications involved.
4 Design the local-area networks.
5 Design the wide-area network.
6 Design for speciﬁc network protocols.
7 Create the design document and select Cisco network management applications.
8 Test the design.
This section provides an overview of these steps. The remainder of the book ﬁlls in the details 
of these steps.
Gather Information to Support the Business and Technical 
Requirements
The section “Customer Objectives,” earlier in this chapter, covers step 1. Chapter 2, “Assessing 
the Existing Network and Identifying Customer Objectives,” covers this step in much more 
detail.
Assess the Current Network
This is the step during which you collect all data pertaining to physical, logical, trafﬁc, and 
management information of the network. Chapter 2 covers this step in more detail. This section 
contains an overview of this step.
Physical Assessment
To perform a physical assessment, you need to document the physical topology of the network. 
Create a diagram with all routers, switches, and hubs. For example, in Figure 1-2, a list of 
network devices is created and the type and amount of devices is documented. Physical 
connectivity between devices should also be documented; also list the speed and type of media 
used between devices.

You will also need to list the LAN technologies being used. The following is a list of possible 
LAN technologies:
•
Ethernet
•
Token Ring
•
FDDI
•
Fast Ethernet
•
Gigabit Ethernet
Finally, document the WAN circuit information and list the WAN technologies being used. The 
following is a list of possible WAN technologies used:
•

Logical Assessment
To perform the logical assessment, determine the following:
•
The protocols that are being routed
•
The IP address assignment scheme
•
The Novell IPX address assignment
•
The AppleTalk address assignment
•
Whether any access list is used to ﬁlter addresses or broadcasts
•
The Layer 3 architecture
Figure 1-3 provides an example of a logical assessment. Here, the IP address subnet 
information is documented. The ﬁgure shows ﬁve Ethernet segments with 24-bit subnet masks 
that can support up to 254 nodes each. This ﬁgure also shows four point-to-point links with 30-
bit masks. With this mask, two IP addresses are used for each router on the link.
Figure 1-3
Logical Assessment
Trafﬁc Assessment
To perform the trafﬁc assessment, determine the following:
•
Document the trafﬁc ﬂows on the network.
•
Determine how much trafﬁc is on each segment.
•
Locate the servers.

Steps for Network Design     13
Management Assessment
Determine the current tools used for network management:
•
Determine whether the customer has the necessary tools to manage the network.
•
Determine whether there is a management station
•
Find out whether CiscoWorks is being used to manage routers and switches.
•
Verify whether there are capacity or performance monitoring tools.
•
Determine whether a network protocol analyzer is available for LAN segment 
troubleshooting.
•
Find out whether any RMON probes are in use.
Consider the Applications Involved
A good designer needs to take into consideration the applications that the network supports. The 
only reason the network is there is to provide a highway on which application information can 
ﬂow. Never ignore the applications in use. Chapter 3, “Application Considerations,” covers this 
step in more detail. This section contains an overview of the applications to consider in this step.
Microsoft Workgroups
MS Networking uses the session-layer NetBIOS protocol for ﬁle and print sharing. NetBIOS 
over NetBEUI is not routable and must be bridged for all devices to communicate on the 
network. For this reason, NetBIOS over NetBEUI does not scale well. NetBIOS over TCP 
(NBT) scales better because it relies on TCP/IP for transport, thus enabling NetBIOS trafﬁc to 
be routed.
Novell Application Services
Novell uses the Service Advertising Protocol (SAP) for devices to announce their services to 
the network. SAP broadcasts are generated by ﬁleservers, print servers, and so on. These 
broadcasts are sent every minute. As required by the protocol, a router adds all SAP broadcasts 
to its SAP table and broadcasts it every 60 seconds to its IPX interfaces. On larger networks, 
these broadcasts can overwhelm the network. Consider using access lists to ﬁlter SAP 
broadcasts from LAN segments. 

14     Chapter 1: Design Goals
IBM Networking
Traditional SNA networking involves the use of SDLC for WAN connectivity and Token Ring 
for LANs. Communication between hosts and terminals is bridged. The designer needs to 
document the Source-Route Bridging (SRB) requirements and consider Data-Link Switching 
Plus (DLSw+) for transporting SNA and NetBIOS trafﬁc over WAN links in the IP network.
Multimedia Services
The network designer should investigate requirements to support multimedia services such as 
video and voice. Use techniques such as multicast routing to multicast video streams to reduce 
the total bandwidth used on the network. Multicast routing can transmit video streams to 
preselected end stations and reduce bandwidth consumption when compared to broadcasting. 
On networks supporting Voice over IP, use techniques such as RTP header compression on 
WAN links to reduce overhead. RSVP, policy routing, and tag switching are techniques used in 
the design of these time-sensitive applications.
Design the Local-Area Network
The Cisco Certiﬁed Design Associate must be able to design local-area networks that meet the 
customer’s objectives on performance and scalability. A CCDA must design networks in a 
hierarchical manner to provide scalable solutions. A CCDA also must decide where to use hubs, 
switches, and routers to separate broadcast and collision domains. Know the differences 
between Layer 2 and Layer 3 switching as well. Chapter 4, “Network Topologies and LAN 
Design,” covers this step in more detail. This section contains an overview of this step.
Hierarchical versus Flat Designs
The CCDA should understand that there is a limit on the number of nodes in ﬂat network 
designs. Network broadcasts can overcome slow serial links. Build the network in a hierarchical 
manner with subnetting to reduce the amount of trafﬁc on WAN links.  
The CCDA must understand the three layers of the hierarchical model for network design: the 
core, distribution, and access layers. Figure 1-4 provides an example of these three layers.
At the core layer, high-speed switching is used with high availability and redundancy. Apply 
access and distribution lists at the distribution layer, which is where the security policies are 
applied. Address summarization and media translations are applied in the distribution layer as 
well. The access layer consists of the remote ofﬁce sites using ISDN, Frame Relay, and DDR, 
and private lines accessing the corporate network. Local-area networks end segments are also 
part of the access layer.

Steps for Network Design     15
Figure 1-4
Hierarchical Design Model
LAN Protocols
You need to understand the characteristics of LAN protocols, including physical distance 
limitations of LAN technologies: Ethernet (10Base2, 10Base5, and 10BaseT), Fast Ethernet, 
Gigabit Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI. Use these technologies to satisfy requirements 
ranging from user workstations to high-bandwidth servers.
LAN Physical Design
Select the equipment to be used, keeping in mind the LAN technologies and the number of ports 
required for the network.  
Cisco LAN solutions include repeaters and switches.
Repeaters:
•
Cisco 1500 hubs
•
FastHub 100, 200, and 300 families

•
Catalyst 5000 Switch family
•
Catalyst 5500 family
•
Catalyst 1900 family
•
Catalyst 2800 family
•

Design the Wide-Area Network
The CCDA must design WAN networks that meet the customer’s objectives of performance and 
scalability. Design networks in a hierarchical manner. and plan for bandwidth capacity to 
provide scalable solutions. Determine the WAN technologies to use, and plan for Cisco router 
solutions. Chapter 5, “WAN Design,” covers this step in more detail. This section contains an 
overview of this step.
Transport Selection
Decide on the WAN technology to use. The following list will help you make this decision:
•
Use leased lines where trafﬁc ﬂows are constant between point-to-point locations.
•
Use ISDN for on-demand access to remote ofﬁces and for backup for another link type.
•
Use Frame Relay as a high-bandwidth, cost-effective transport. This very popular WAN 
protocol provides permanent virtual circuits (PVC) between routers. Frame Relay 
provides characteristics such as congestion notiﬁcation, discard eligibility (DE) bit, 
bursting, and the capability to have several PVCs on a physical port. These and other 
features (such as cost) made Frame Relay a very popular WAN technology in the 1990s.
•
Use X.25 when the reliability of the WAN links is suspect. X.25 is an older WAN 
technology that is still widely in use and can be found running over low-speed (9600 to 
64000 bps) lines. Throughput using X.25 suffers in comparison to Frame Relay due to 
X.25’s additional error checking.
•
Use ATM when high bandwidth (155+ Mbps) is required on the core. ATM offers different 
Quality of Service (QoS) types, allowing trafﬁc with varying tolerances for bandwidth and 
latency to travel over the same network.

Steps for Network Design     17
Bandwidth Planning
The CCDA must look at the applications being deployed at remote sites and decide on the sizing 
of WAN circuits. Rely on the analysis of existing trafﬁc ﬂows and past experience to help 
determine an appropriate bandwidth size for a circuit. If WAN circuit utilization is more than 
70 percent for a long period of time, the circuit bandwidth should be increased. When planning 
bandwidth allocation, consider the following:
•
The type of servers that are located at the remote site
•
Whether the applications in the hub site will be accessed remotely and whether the 
intranet Web sites will be accessed remotely
•
Whether there are Microsoft Domain controllers or MS Exchange servers at the remote 
sites
•
Whether there are any database applications
Physical Design
Select the equipment to be used, keeping in mind the technologies and the number of interfaces 
required for the network. Take into consideration that the CCDA is focused on Cisco small to 
medium-sized network solutions.
The small to medium-sized network solutions include the following router series:
•
Cisco 760/770 series
•
Cisco 1000 series
•
Cisco 1600 series
•
Cisco 2500 series routers
•
Cisco 3600 series routers
•
Cisco MC3810 router
•
Cisco 4500/4700 series routers
•
Cisco 5200/5300 access servers
•
Cisco 7200 series router
Design for Speciﬁc Network Protocols
In this step, take into consideration the type of protocols to be used on the network. Chapter 6, 
“Designing for Speciﬁc Protocols,” covers this step in more detail. This section contains an 
overview of this step.

18     Chapter 1: Design Goals
IP
The CCDA needs to design an IP address assignment scheme based on a hierarchical model. 
Use VLSMs to assign networks based on the number of devices and areas on the network. A 
hierarchical model for address assignment with VLSMs allows the network to take advantage 
of routing summary features supported by protocols such as EIGRP and OSPF. Choose routing 
protocols that will not add signiﬁcant trafﬁc to the network. Understand the differences between 
distance vector and link-state routing protocols.
Novell
Create IPX addressing schemes. Consider the broadcast characteristics of Novell’s distance 
vector Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Service Advertising Protocol (SAP). RIP 
broadcasts its table every 60 seconds; SAP also broadcasts the SAP table every 60 seconds. Use 
access lists to ﬁlter speciﬁc SAP broadcasts. Consider the design of the distance vector IPX RIP 
versus NetWare Link-Services Protocol (NLSP). EIGRP can be used on WAN links to reduce 
IPX trafﬁc.
AppleTalk
Consider the AppleTalk cable ranges to assign to each interface and the zones for each area. To 
overcome the limitations of the AppleTalk routing protocol RTMP, use methods such as AURP 
or EIGRP on the WAN.
Bridging
Transparent and source-route bridged networks have size limitations and do not scale well. To 
reduce the trafﬁc of bridged protocols, limit the size of bridged networks.
Create the Design Document and Select Cisco Network Management 
Applications
After working with the LAN, WAN, and protocol design, incorporate the solutions into one 
design during this step. Verify that the total solution meets the customer’s objectives on 
performance, scalability, and cost. Incorporate a proactive network management solution that 
satisﬁes the customer’s network service goals. Chapter 7, “The Design Document and Cisco 
Network Management Applications,” covers this step in more detail. This section contains an 
overview of this step.

Steps for Network Design     19
The Design Document
The design document helps the designer explain how the solution meets the requirements of the 
project. It consists of the following primary sections:
•
Executive Summary
•
Design Requirements
•
Design Solution
•
Summary
•
Appendixes
•
Cost of Proposed Design (optional)
Management Applications
A CCDA must be able to select the appropriate management applications for the designed 
network. Chapter 7 covers several management applications with which the CCDA must be 
familiar and discusses which are appropriate for various networks.
Test the Design
After a design has been proposed, the next step is to verify that the design will work. For large 
networks, a prototype can be built; for smaller networks a pilot can be devised. Chapter 8, 
“Building a Prototype or Pilot,” covers the steps of building prototype and pilot test networks.

Case Studies
Because passing the CCDA exam requires you to answer design questions about an ongoing 
case study, “Case Studies” and “Case Study Answers” sections will appear at the end of each 
body chapter in this book. Each “Case Studies” section asks questions based on one or more of 
the case studies presented in this section. Each “Case Study Answers” section answers those 
questions with detailed explanations. Each chapter’s questions in the “Case Studies” section 
deal with the subject matter covered in that chapter. In some chapters, other case study 
background information will be presented in the question in addition to the general case study 
information here. This is so that you can answer that chapter’s speciﬁc questions.
The remainder of this section introduces the three case studies that will be referred to at the end 
of each chapter. When you come across a question on a particular case study, refer back to these 
sections so that you can go about answering the questions on that case study.
Case Study #1: GHY Resources
Mr. Martin of GHY Resources is responsible for the company’s network. He has invited you to 
a meeting to discuss some issues.
GHY Resources is a manufacturing company with its headquarters based in St. Louis. In the 
past 10 years, GHY has grown from 10 employees to more than 400. It now has a manufacturing 
site in Kansas City, and a new site is opening in Nashville, Tennessee, in three months. The 
manufacturing sites connect back to St. Louis via a 256 K circuit. Sales ofﬁces exist in more 
than seven cities throughout the United States. Each sales ofﬁce connects back to the 
headquarters via a 56 K leased line. These leased lines run at more than 70 percent utilization 
at certain times during the day. The company currently uses a mix of routers from different 
vendors and wants to standardize on Cisco’s if the price is right. The current routing protocol 
is RIPv1. Figure 1-5 shows the current topology of GHY Resources.
Novell NetWare ﬁleservers are used throughout the company, with one server at each of the 
sales ofﬁces. Local ofﬁces have print servers also. The headquarters’ local-area network 
consists of Ethernet using 10BaseT hubs. These Ethernet segments constantly run at about 45 
percent utilization. There are around 10 segments connecting to a pair of Cisco 4000 routers. 
One of the network analysts mentioned that the protocol analyzer reported broadcast storms on 
some of the Ethernet segments.
Business applications run on an HP 3000 machine located on one of the segments at the 
headquarters. An HP 3000 is located at the manufacturing site. The manufacturing site has two 
NetWare ﬁle servers. Mr. Martin expects the new manufacturing site to have the same business 
applications. The LAN in Kansas City consists of three Ethernet segments with 30 stations 
each. Network utilization is at 35 percent on each segment.

Case Study #2: Pages Magazine, Inc.     23

GHY Resources Logical Diagram
Mr. Martin has mentioned that he is interested in Frame Relay as an alternative for his WAN 
links. He would like to upgrade his LANs as well. He has requested a LAN/WAN solution that 
would help reduce the utilization problems he is having on the network. He also would like a 
solution to reduce the SAP trafﬁc on the network. In addition, he wants to ﬁnd a way to conserve 
IP addresses on his network. Mr. Martin needs to get a proposal in one week to have his 
managers approve the money. The design needs to be installed before the new manufacturing 
site becomes operational.
Look for questions on the GHY Resources case study at the end of some of the book’s chapters.
Case Study #2: Pages Magazine, Inc.
Ms. Phillips is the newly appointed Director of IT at Pages Magazine, Inc. Pages Magazine 
realizes that to aggressively compete in its market, this company needs changes to its 
infrastructure that will support new applications and Internet access, allowing them to increase 
their productivity and to follow market trends. Pages wants to use the Internet to gain clients 
and ﬁnd new opportunities. Ms. Phillips is faced with many options but needs your help in 
developing a solution that is both cost-effective and scalable. She needs to make sure that the 
solution will address her immediate needs and also be scalable enough to support future 
applications.

Case Study #3: MediBill Services, Inc.     25
These leased lines have provided enough bandwidth to support basic e-mail and ﬁle transfer 
services. Each ofﬁce has its own Novell servers that are currently managed independently, 
running on a ﬂat 10BaseT Ethernet environment. A T1 will be installed at the NYC ofﬁce to 
provide Internet access to the remote ofﬁces. Internet access and e-mail are the ﬁrst critical 
applications that need to be addressed. Currently, the ofﬁces use CC:mail as their e-mail 
platform.
Pages Magazine has not standardized on MS Ofﬁce applications and currently uses a mix of 
Apple and Microsoft application products. All the routers route IPX, AppleTalk, and IP; 
however, Pages Magazine wants to migrate to a purely IP environment with Novell GroupWise 
as the e-mail platform. Each ofﬁce will have a GroupWise server that needs to be synchronized 
with the NYC ofﬁce for Internet e-mail. After the two new ofﬁces go online, every ofﬁce will 
slowly migrate to Netware 5, using native IP for transport. Until then, AppleTalk still needs to 
be supported as a routed protocol. The new Novell servers will also have a synchronized NDS 
directory structure that will manage the user access and login process.
Network manageability has been difﬁcult since different vendor products are being used to 
provide WAN access. Ms. Phillips is looking for a single vendor solution that can be managed 
more effectively with her limited staff.
The additional ofﬁces for the new network are another concern, and she is looking to implement 
a network management solution that will support her staff. She has three remote IT support 
people in addition to three NYC-based people. One support person is located in Danbury and 
the other is in White Plains. The third supports Queens. Most of her staff have desktop and 
moderate networking skills.
The network used RIPv1, but Ms. Phillips plans to use DHCP to readdress her network so that 
she can conserve the valid IP address and to create a more scalable IP addressing scheme. Pages 
Magazine, Inc., will require a new routing protocol that will support subnetting and possible 
VLSM. Ms. Phillips is also interested in ﬁnding a more cost-effective WAN solution that will 
support the additional two ofﬁces that will go online within two months.
Ms. Phillips must present an infrastructure upgrade and Internet access plan to the CEO and 
CFO in three weeks. The presentation will include a network design to show how the network 
will scale to support new ofﬁces and to address any return on investment issues.
Look for questions on the Pages Magazine, Inc., case study at the end of some of the book’s 
chapters.
Case Study #3: MediBill Services, Inc.
MediBill Services, Inc., started out providing billing support and services for a small 
community of independent medical ofﬁces. These ofﬁces used MediBill to service medical 
claims and provide patient data storage. After ﬁve years of service, MediBill has decided to 
grow and provide online medical information and Internet access to service its expanding client 

26     Chapter 1: Design Goals
base. The company also is looking to provide the security for ﬁle transfers for disaster recovery 
purposes. MediBill is looking to ensure that the integrity of the information transferred will not 
going be in question.  
MediBill’s CIO, Mr. Lee, is responsible for approving a design strategy that would support 
MediBill’s future goals of providing secured remote storage of medical ﬁles, as well as Internet/
e-mail services and desktop support to the small to medium-sized medical ofﬁces.  
MediBill currently has a T1 out to the Internet but isn’t sure whether this is enough bandwidth 
to support its client base. The company has just acquired eight more ofﬁces that will need access 
within three months. MediBill has already begun the PC installation process and is waiting to 
coordinate the installation of the WAN connections. Prior to the WAN installations, Mr. Lee will 
need to purchase routers and security equipment for the Internet access.
Mr. Lee has asked several consultants to respond to the following information provided in a 
Request for Proposal (RFP).
MediBill has maintained an NT SQL database in its main ofﬁce, which connects to the six 
remote doctors ofﬁces via 56 kbps dialup connections. These connections will have to be 
upgraded to support new services provided by the Internet. The connections will have to support 
Internet Web, e-mail, and ﬁle transfers as well as network management trafﬁc. Mr. Lee is 
looking to implement the Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) for remote monitoring 
and management. MediBill has decided to standardize on the Microsoft platform to simplify IT 
management issues. MediBill has already implemented Microsoft Exchange and Outlook as the 
e-mail system.
MediBill is going to start by providing its clients with basic Web access, FTP, and e-mail. 
After the Internet access and WAN upgrades, Mr. Lee wants to roll out a full network 
management solution that includes the management of each of the company’s customers as well 
as its own network. Currently, each remote ofﬁce must provide its own PC equipment, but with 
MediBill’s new services, the company has decided to provide the PCs and all the customer 
premise equipment (CPE) necessary. Each ofﬁce will have ﬁve to ten PCs per ofﬁce, all running 
Microsoft Windows 98.  
MediBill also won a contract with the MetroCenter Hospital, where the company will provide 
Internet services as well as secured disaster recovery services for data and ﬁles. The hospital 
will be connected to MediBill via a dedicated T1 circuit. The hospital has contracted MediBill 
to manage the 50 Internet workstations that will be distributed throughout the hospital, as well 
as the 10 data-transfer stations.
The client needs to review its WAN strategy and provide a design plan to upgrade the WAN 
network to support its growing client base. The client wants a demonstration of the security that 
his network will provide so that he can use that information in MediBill’s marketing strategy.

Additional Case Studies     27
Mr. Lee wants a proposal that will provide a baseline of the existing network and WAN 
connections as a comparison to a new network. Due to the large scale of changes that need to 
be made with MediBill, Mr. Lee is looking for a proposal that will outline how the company 
will migrate from its previous network to the new, more scalable network.
Additional Case Studies
Chapter 9, “Additional Case Studies,” consists entirely of case studies that cover an array of 
CCDA topics. When you have completed all the chapters in the book, work on these case 
studies to ﬁne tune your CCDA case study skills.

Assessing the Existing Network 
and Identifying Customer 
Objectives
To create a comprehensive design that will meet your customer’s needs, you must 
understand the customer’s objectives. This chapter is designed to help you obtain the 
fundamental skills necessary to determine those needs. These skills will help you formulate 
questions, understand what elements of the network to review, and develop a scope for the 
project. When a project scope has been deﬁned, a project plan can be created to satisfy the 
customer’s requirements. The success of the project plan and resulting design proposal will 
rely heavily on your ability to collect data that is both accurate and pertinent.
While the information-gathering process may seem overwhelming, guidelines introduced 
in this chapter can make the task more manageable. No project plan, no matter how well 
thought out, can anticipate every possible scenario. Use of the guidelines outlined in this 
chapter can provide a solid framework for a project plan that can be adapted to any 
unanticipated changes.
Unlike other Cisco exams, the CCDA has both a technical and a process focus. While many 
technical facts can be memorized, the process for developing a sound design must be 
understood. The various steps in the process must make sense to be useful. Eventually, as 
the process becomes clear, it will become easier to accurately deﬁne your customer’s 
objectives and formulate satisfactory designs.
“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz
The questions in the following quiz are designed to help you gauge how well you know the 
material covered in this chapter. Compare your answers with those found in Appendix A, 
“Answers to Quiz Questions.” If you answered most or all of the questions thoroughly and 
correctly, you might want to skim the chapter and proceed to the “Q&A” and “Case Study” 
sections at the end of the chapter. If you ﬁnd that you need to review only certain subject 
matter, search the chapter for those sections that cover the objectives you need to review, 
and then test yourself both with these questions and with the “Q&A” and “Case Study” 
questions. If you ﬁnd the following questions too difﬁcult, read the chapter carefully until 
you feel that you can easily answers these and the “Q&A” and “Case Study” questions.

Foundation Topics
The Necessary Data for Characterizing the Existing 
Network
The following CCDA objective is covered in this section:
To help you understand and characterize your customer’s network, you will review two basic 
areas of your customer’s business. First you will review nontechnical data related to your 
customer’s business goals, issues, and constraints—this is also known as the corporate proﬁle 
information. This information is essential to understanding growth trends, corporate structure, 
and policies that would affect your design. The second major area you will need to review is the 
customer’s current technical information. It is important to distinguish between business or 
administrative information and technical data. However, as you are collecting this data, it is 
important to see how they are related to each other. Remember that the goal here is to 
understand your customer’s existing network and to uncover any problem areas you might 
encounter later. This section discusses basic guidelines and topics you can use to begin to 
proﬁle your customer’s design needs and existing network.
Assessing the Customer’s Corporate Proﬁle Information
Assessing the corporate proﬁle information will help you characterize the type of business and 
your customer’s business constraints. Understanding your customer’s network means 
understanding your customer’s business. The proﬁling data will help you determine the 
following:
•
Business goals and business type—Determine what type of business your customer is 
engaged in and what the company’s major business goals are for the future. The growth 
of a company will differ from one to another; try to understand how you would measure 
the growth of the company. Should you look for signiﬁcant growth every six months, or 
in one year, or over the next four years? This will help you determine the scalability 
requirements and also help you understand the return on the investment the customer is 
seeking. By researching your customer’s industry and the competition, you will be able to 
better position Cisco products to help the customer grow. 
•
Corporate structure—A network design usually resembles the corporate structure of a 
company by having different networks for different departments, such as Marketing, 
Media, Human Resources, and Accounting. An organizational chart or a similar document 
can help you better understand the corporate structure. An example of some information 
4
Identify all the data you should gather to characterize the customer’s existing 
network.

The Necessary Data for Characterizing the Existing Network     33
you would ﬁnd includes stafﬁng at headquarters and how regions of the company interact 
with each other. Of course, the best source to verify and explain the corporate structure is 
your customer.
•
Geographical structure—Determine how the customer’s company is spread 
geographically. You should always review the geographical structure of the company with 
the corporate structure. Doing this research helps you understand and locate major user 
communities. 
•
Current and future stafﬁng—The network must have enough ﬂexibility to address the 
needs of the existing staff as well as support the growth and expansion of a company. To 
help you determine current and future stafﬁng needs, ask the following questions: 
— Ask the network users how these network changes will affect them.
— Ask the network users which department or departments will be affected.
— Ask the IS staff how much in-house internetworking expertise there is.
— Ask the IS staff if the company plans to expand staff as required to support the 
new internetwork design.
— Ask the IS staff who will help you design the internetwork.
— Ask if the new design will cause changes in job functions or possibly eliminate 
jobs.
•
Policies and politics—Provides an understanding of how the design and implementation 
of the new network will affect the people and policies in the company. Find out whether 
they have any current policies related to the infrastructure. An example would be the 
corporate security policy or LAN access.
Assessing the Customer’s Technical Information
Before you can begin developing a design solution, you must assess the company’s current 
network technical information. Technical data helps you identify any network bottlenecks, 
understand how systems work together, and determine whether there are any obvious issues in 
implementing the new design.
Use the business proﬁle information to act as a guide when gathering technical information. 
After gathering all the business data, it is possible to start extrapolating questions you would 
ask to assess the customer’s current technical information. For example, determining the type 
of business your customer is engaged in can help you determine what type of applications are 
used within the business. If the company provides data warehousing and administrative support, 
you can be sure it will have some type of database system. Also consider whether the company 
is in media—then you can be sure that this involves some graphic-intensive trafﬁc. Also in this 
case, you might suspect that there is some AppleTalk on the network because many companies 
still use Apple computers for graphical design.

34     Chapter 2: Assessing the Existing Network and Identifying Customer Objectives
Another example of using the business proﬁle information to assess technical information 
would be to determine what IT services your customer needs to supply its clients. What are the 
technical requirements to achieve this goal? If your customer wants to supply Internet services 
to its clients with e-mail, then you can begin to see that the WAN connections from your 
customer to the client will be essential; your client’s services will be dependent on the Internet 
connection. You can use the information to start understanding how the applications and trafﬁc 
ﬂow for these applications will be affected by the bandwidth.
Technical assessment can be divided into the following areas:
•
Performance
•
Applications
•
Network management
•
Security
The following sections discuss each of these areas.
Performance Assessment
To assess the performance issues of the current network, you will want to ask the following 
questions:
•
Is there any latency?
•
What is causing that latency?
•
When do the performance problems happen?
•
How will performance be affected by the proposed design?
•
How much trafﬁc ﬂows between segments?
•
Are there new applications, networks, or segments that will add to the trafﬁc?
Sometimes it might be possible to perform a baseline of the network. If that is not possible 
because the network is too large, consider doing the trafﬁc analysis on the critical segments, 
such as the backbone.
Applications Assessment
To completely assess the applications on the current network, you will need to look at the 
following:
•
Applications—Identify the customer’s current applications and plans for future 
applications, including information such as who uses the applications.

Documenting the Existing Network     35
•
Information ﬂows—Analyze where information ﬂows in the company and how different 
applications and trafﬁc affects that ﬂow. If possible, try to reference existing 
documentation—if none is available, this process could require considerable time based 
on the size of the network 
•
Shared data—Determine where shared data resides and who uses it. 
•
Categorize data—This will help you understand the different types of data passed along 
in the company’s network, such as routed protocols, nonrouted protocols, and routing 
protocols
Network Management Assessment
Ask the following questions to assess the company’s network management situation:
•
Who manages the network? Are all aspects of the network managed by the same people?
•
What type of network management is the client looking to implement? Reactive versus 
proactive?
•
What type of notiﬁcation does the client want to warn it of performance or fault issues?
•
Who in the company knows how to perform network management tasks?
Security Assessment
Finally, ask the following questions to assess the company’s network security:
•
What security risks concern the customer?
•
What security risks are priorities to the customer?
•
Are there any existing security policies? Are the policies documented?
•
What are the different access levels a user can have?
•
What is the physical security of the network? Does everyone have access to the data closet 
or center?
Documenting the Existing Network
The following CCDA objectives are covered in this section:
5
Document the customer’s current applications, protocols, topology, and 
number of users.
6
Document the customer’s business issues that are relevant to a network 
design project.

36     Chapter 2: Assessing the Existing Network and Identifying Customer Objectives
As you can see, beginning with an assessment of the customer’s business goals and current 
network is the ﬁrst step in designing the new network. The previous section gives you an idea 
of the sort of information you will need to look for to make this assessment. The following 
section explains how a CCDA can go about organizing and documenting this information to 
begin working on the new design. Again, a holistic approach is very important. You must 
thoroughly document your customer’s business needs and future plans to be able to build an 
efﬁcient and scalable network. You must document your customer’s current network to be able 
to identify performance needs and problems that a new network will need to overcome.
The “Case Study” section at the end of this chapter demonstrates these documentation 
techniques put to use on a case study network.
Twelve Steps for Documenting Your Customer’s Existing 
Network
The following CCDA objectives are covered in this section:
The following list shows the 12 steps you should take to help you describe what your customer’s 
network currently looks like. Before you alter a network, you need to know what currently 
exists and the impact of your design on the existing environment.
Step 1
Characterize the customer’s applications.
Step 2
Characterize the network protocols.
Step 3
Document the customer’s current network.
Step 4
Identify potential bottlenecks.
Step 5
Identify the business constraints and inputs into your network 
design.
Step 6
Characterize the existing network availability.
Step 7
Characterize the network performance.
Step 8
Characterize the existing network reliability.
Step 9
Characterize the network utilization.
5
Document the customer’s current applications, protocols, topology, and 
number of users.
6
Document the customer’s business issues that are relevant to a network 
design project.
7
Assess the health of the customer’s existing network and make 
conclusions about the network’s capability to support growth.

Twelve Steps for Documenting Your Customer’s Existing Network     37
Step 10
Characterize the status of the major routers.
Step 11
Characterize the existing network management tools.
Step 12
Summarize the health of the existing network.
Step 1: Characterize the Customer’s Application
The existing applications are a critical part of the assessment because applications are an end-
user service. This means that application documentation must be accurate and detailed because 
each segment and each application can have unique qualities. Create a table with the ﬁelds 
displayed in Table 2-1 to document the customer’s applications. Remember that a good analysis 
of the customer’s requirements can help you narrow the applications you need to document.
This simple chart helps you organize the applications into categories as well as determine the 
trafﬁc and information ﬂows. Mapping information ﬂows can be accomplished by ﬁrst 
identifying the source device and then the destination device. These devices could be end 
stations, such as workstations, or other devices, like application servers, routers, or CPE 
equipment. Note that application ﬂows can include multiple protocols, so you need to be 
speciﬁc about what you are mapping. For example, you could map an application ﬂow between 
a Web server and a client. One option would be to diagram the Layer 3 IP protocol associated 
with the HTTP application and another would be to diagram Layer 4 TCP protocol. The process 
of using application ﬂows is a great tool for understanding how an application works.

38     Chapter 2: Assessing the Existing Network and Identifying Customer Objectives
Step 2: Characterize the Network Protocols
Gathering information on the network protocols can be approached much in the same manner 
as gathering the application information. You also want to document both routed protocols and 
routing protocols. Create a table using the ﬁelds displayed in Table 2-2, and use it to document 
the network protocols.
Step 3: Document the Customer’s Current Network
This step involves doing the following:
•
Documenting the network topology
•
Documenting the addressing schemes
•
Documenting concerns about the network
Documenting the Network Topology
Having a network topology map is crucial for understanding the existing network and 
formulating a basis for the new network design. Usually, the client will have some sort of 
network topology map. If not, make sure you create one and verify that the map is accurate with 
the client. Two basic types of network topology maps exist: One is a logical map with generic 
router symbols and overall network layout. This type of map is an excellent way to overview 
trafﬁc ﬂow and LAN and WAN topologies. A more detailed physical diagram includes router 
speciﬁcations, network addresses, and so on. Ideally, you would want both types of network

diagrams, but sometimes features of both diagrams are merged into one. The following are 
guidelines for the topology map or an accompanying document:
•
Every segment on the customer’s network should be represented.
•
All segments should have the appropriate LAN or WAN topology (for example, Ethernet, 
Token Ring, FDDI, Frame Relay cloud, serial links, and so on).
•
All segments should be identiﬁed with the correct line and segment speeds.
•
Try to include addressing schemes, such as network addresses, and the corresponding 
subnet masks for IP.
•
Include all routers and switches, along with their naming schemes, if possible.
•
Document any concerns about the network diagram, including trafﬁc-ﬂow issues and 
architectural questions.

that you can see the elements discussed previously.

Documenting the Addressing Schemes
Addressing schemes are very important factors to consider. As long as you need network 
access, your devices must have addresses. IP addressing has become the most popular type of 
addressing. Many companies have implemented a Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol 
(DHCP) server, which is used to manage IP addressing within a network. This technology helps 
administrators quickly implement IP changes without having to track them in a spreadsheet.  
Internet access and the need for network address translation (NAT) is a perfect example of how 
critical addressing becomes. NAT allows private addresses (those addresses not routable on the 
Internet) to be translated into a few public addresses. Many companies implement this 
technology because of the public IP address shortage. Addressing information is often included 
in topology diagrams.
Documenting Concerns About the Network
Document any concerns about the network diagram, including trafﬁc-ﬂow issues and 
architectural questions.
Step 4: Identify Potential Bottlenecks
When identifying potential bottlenecks, look for links or segments that are almost or completely 
over utilized because they are experiencing large amounts of broadcast/multicast trafﬁc, or 
would be over utilized if additional application trafﬁc were introduced. By identifying patterns 
in the trafﬁc, you can redesign the infrastructure to get better response times.
A good example of trafﬁc patterning is the 80-20 rule for LAN design. The 80-20 rule states 
that 80 percent of the trafﬁc on a segment should be local to that segment. The remaining 20 
percent of the trafﬁc should be backbone trafﬁc.
The CCDA exam covers ﬁve basic tools you can use throughout the design and testing process. 
These tools can be used to identify the potential bottlenecks in the existing network by looking 
at bandwidth utilization and trafﬁc patterns:
•
Netsys Enterprise/Solver
•
NetFlow
•
CiscoWorks
•
Protocol analyzer/sniffer
•
Scion
The exam focuses on the uses of these products more than technical details of their 
implementation.

Twelve Steps for Documenting Your Customer’s Existing Network     41
The Netsys Enterprise/Solver performance tools analyze interface statistics, routing table sizes, 
IP/IPX accounting data, and enterprise RMON information to provide an observed 
performance snapshot of the current network. You can read more about Netsys tools in the 
“Network Management” section of Cisco’s product catalog or on the Cisco Web site at http://
www.cisco.com.
Cisco’s NetFlow switching trafﬁc management enables full-time monitoring of network trafﬁc 
and collection of detailed statistics. It also offers advanced accounting and reporting 
capabilities through the NetFlow Data Export function and applications from Cisco partners. It 
offers advantages over many tools because it does not require an extra protocol, such as RMON.
CiscoWorks is a set of SNMP-based tools for characterizing a customer’s network, monitoring 
the status of devices, maintaining conﬁgurations, and troubleshooting problems. Detailed 
information on both Cisco’s NetFlow and CiscoWorks is available on the Cisco Web site and 
on the Cisco documentation CD-ROM.
Protocol analyzers such as Network Associate’s Sniffer network analyzer capture and analyze 
network trafﬁc, providing both protocol analysis and statistics. More information on Network 
Associate’s Sniffer is available at http://www.nga.com.
The Scion software package is a freeware, turn-key Internet service provider (ISP) network 
statistics package developed by Merit Network, Inc. It uses SNMP to collect network 
management information from network routers, and it employs a standards-based client/server 
architecture to make the information available on the Web. More information on the Scion 
software package can be found at http://www.merit.edu/~netscarf/.
Step 5: Identify the Business Constraints and Inputs into Your Network 
Design
Now that you know what information you need to gather about a customer’s company, it is time 
to take a step back to organize, review, and understand your data. This section offers 
recommendations on how to organize your data so that it will become usable information that 
you can apply to your design.  
When you have collected the administrative data, it is time to isolate the information that is needed 
speciﬁcally for the network design. This section shows you how to document and identify the 
customer’s business issues. These issues all have some impact on the network design process and 
will help you plan and implement your network design. The following is a checklist provided by 
Cisco to help you determine whether you have collected all the necessary information related to 
understanding your customer’s business constraints. Use this checklist as a guideline to help you 
check your data. Remember that this list can be used as a basis for your own outline:
I I understand the corporate structure.
I I have analyzed the information ﬂow in the corporation. 

42     Chapter 2: Assessing the Existing Network and Identifying Customer Objectives
I The customer has identiﬁed any mission-critical data or operations. 
I The customer has explained any policies regarding approved vendors, protocols, or 
platforms. 
I The customer has explained any policies regarding open versus proprietary solutions. 
I The customer has explained any policies regarding distributed authority for network 
design and implementation—for example, departments that control their own 
internetworking purchases. 
I I have a good understanding of the technical expertise of my clients. 
I I have researched the customer’s industry and competition. 
I I am aware of any politics that might affect the network design proposal. 
Step 6: Characterize the Existing Network Availability
Another business constraint would be the cost associated with downtime. This is a very critical 
aspect of understanding the customer’s business constraints. This information will affect how 
you plan and implement your network design. For example, if your customer is a publisher, he 
will have critical times during which his network cannot be down due to a publishing schedule. 
If this customer had a disruption in his network, it could affect whether he could publish his 
magazine for that month. Here are some questions to help you gather statistics on network 
downtime and the mean time between failure (MTBF) for the internetwork:
•
What are the critical or fragile segments? 
•
Does any MTBF documentation exist for any network segment?
•
What caused the network failure for those segments?
•
How long were the network failures?
•
What is the cost by department for a network outage (per hour)? 
•
What is the cost to the company or organization for a network outage (per hour)? 
These questions will clarify the customer’s requirements for redundancy and reliability in their 
network. The customer must weigh the cost of having a certain level of redundancy against the 
level of network redundancy needed. Therefore, it is important that the customer agree to the 
level of redundancy or reiliency being sold into the network.

Twelve Steps for Documenting Your Customer’s Existing Network     43
Use a chart similar to the one presented in Table 2-3 to determine the impact of downtime.
Step 7: Characterize the Network Performance
Characterizing network performance means measuring the response times between hosts, 
devices, and even applications. This information can be charted for later comparison. This is 
especially helpful when used as information in a baseline study because the customer can easily 
use this information as proof of improvement.
Step 8: Characterize the Existing Network Reliability
Both Step 8, Characterize the Existing Network Reliability, and Step 9, Characterize Network 
Utilization, require understanding network trafﬁc to capture accurate data. The section “Step 4: 
Identify Potential Bottlenecks,” earlier in this chapter, introduced some tools that help 
characterize the customer’s network. Documenting network trafﬁc can be the most time-
consuming of all the data collections. This is primarily due to the time you need to devote to 
each segment to get accurate data. Determining the sampling rate depends on your analysis of 
network trafﬁc cycles. Network trafﬁc cycles are patterns in network trafﬁc that show peak 
utilization, average and standard network trafﬁc, segment-speciﬁc types of trafﬁc, and so on. 
This type of analysis should be carefully planned so that you gather the critical data without 
compromising the delivery time of the project.  
You can use a protocol analyzer or another network management tool to assess the reliability 
of the network. Document the following values:
•
Total megabytes (MB)
•
Total number of frames
•
Total number of CRC errors
•
Total number of MAC-layer errors (collisions, Token Ring soft errors, and FDDI ring 
operations)
•
Total number of broadcasts/multicast frames

44     Chapter 2: Assessing the Existing Network and Identifying Customer Objectives
Cisco recommends that you document the information in the ﬁelds in Table 2-4 to track the 
network reliability. Each segment should be tested to yield the information necessary to 
complete Table 2-4. The chart includes the methods used to calculate the necessary information.
Step 9: Characterize the Network Utilization
Characterizing the network utilization can easily be done with a network management tool. You 
just need to conﬁgure the monitoring tool to the time settings to gather the data, and the tool 
will do it for you automatically. You can gather data for every protocol and segment and even 
break down the sampling of protocols such as TCP/IP into TCP and UDP protocols. This would 
be useful in tracking different types of applications; the granularity of the sampling is really 
dependent on need.
Peak utilization is a very telling statistic that can help you determine the causes of excessive 
trafﬁc and bandwidth constraints. On Ethernet segments, it’s important to note that a 40 percent 
peak utilization that lasts beyond a minute can cause performance problems. If you notice a 
problem like this, then increase the sampling times from every hour to each minute. However, 
it is important to note that if you are going to be sampling each minute, you must calculate the 
appropriate time to do the sampling. Table 2-5 has ﬁelds that can be used in a table to 
characterize utilization of network protocols such as IP, IPX, and SNA.

Description/Calculation Method
Average Network Utilization
Divide hourly average utilization amount it by the 
number of hourly averages.
Peak Network Utilization
Document the peak utilization amount. Note the 
time and date these peak utilizations occur.  
Average Frame Size
This information can determine future bandwidth 
needs as well as trafﬁc ﬂow needs. If one segment 
is sending large frames to another segment, this 
can indicate that the devices involved need to 
reside on the same logical segment.
CRC Error Rate
Divide the total number of CRC errors by the 
number of megabytes
MAC-layer Error Rate
These errors help determine LAN problems 
associated with collisions.
To calculate the MAC-layer error rate, divide the 
total number of MAC-layer errors by the total 
number of frames.
Broadcast/Multicast Rate 
To calculate the rate of broadcasts/multicasts, just 
divide the total number of broadcasts/multicasts 
by the total number of frames.

Twelve Steps for Documenting Your Customer’s Existing Network     45
Step 10: Characterize the Status of the Major Routers 
Characterizing the status of the major routers can easily be done with Cisco IOS software using 
some basic show commands that should be issued every hour. Refer to the network health 
checklist in the section, “Step 12: Summarize the Health of the Existing Network,” later in this 
chapter, for guidelines for determining the health of the routers. Cisco’s show commands are 
powerful tools that give statistical information about the routers and the type of trafﬁc the 
routers encounter. The following are three commands that can be used to show the status of 
routers:
•
show interfaces—Provides statistical information on all the interfaces attached to the 
device, such as type of interface, identiﬁcation of interface, whether the interface is up or 
down, and so on.
•
show processes—Displays active processes, including CPU processes.
•
show buffers—Shows information in main system memory to identify overutilization 
problems.
Step 11: Characterize the Existing Network Management Tools
The tools introduced earlier in this section represent only some of the of available network 
management devices. It is very possible that you will use other tools to characterize your 
customer’s network or that the existing network already has some of these tools. This step 
reminds you to document the tools that already exist, as well as those you used to gather your 
information. It is also a good idea to document how you went about using these tools to gather 
your information.
Table 2-5
Chart for Characterizing Utilization of Network Protocols

Description/Calculation
Relative Network Utilization
Calculate the percentage of each type of protocol 
on a segment. This is done by dividing the 
utilization amount for the segment from a speciﬁc 
protocol by the total bandwidth use for the 
segment.
Absolute Network Utilization
Note the bandwidth use of each segment relative 
to the size of the actual bandwidth.
Average Frame Size
Note the average frame size for each segment.
Broadcast/Multicast Rates
To calculate the rate of broadcasts/multicasts, just 
divide the total number of broadcasts/multicasts 
by the total number of frames.

46     Chapter 2: Assessing the Existing Network and Identifying Customer Objectives
Step 12: Summarize the Health of the Existing Network
The network health checklist presented in Table 2-6 can help you make some quick assessments 
on the overall health of the network
Although these numbers are guidelines, it’s important for the exam that you refer to these 
guidelines when answering the questions. Many guidelines need to be tempered by taking into 
account the environment you are comparing. Therefore, when you compare your ﬁndings to the 
health list, remember to also document the reason for the deviation.

Extracting the New Customer Requirements     47
Extracting the New Customer Requirements
The following CCDA objectives are covered in this section:
Now that you have determined what the customer currently has in its network, you need to 
determine the customer’s new design needs. Combining a thorough assessment of the existing 
network with complete documentation of the customer’s network design needs will provide you 
with all the information you need to begin the customer’s new network design.
Cisco provides you with the following list of steps to help you organize the customer’s 
networking needs. Each step is followed by criteria or questions to help gather the information:
Step 1
Characterize the customer’s business constraints.
•
Document the customer’s budget.
•
List the resources available for this project, the stafﬁng, the 
training level, and the timelines.
Step 2
Identify the security requirements.
•
Determine the security concerns of the customer.
•
Document how much security the customer needs and who 
will be affected.
•
List the type of security the customer needs—ﬁrewalls, access 
lists, and so on.
•
Document the type of authentication required.
•
List how much node security is required, as well as 
information on passwords, physical security, and access rights.
Step 3
Document the customer’s manageability requirements.
•
Identify the speciﬁc needs for the ﬁve manageability areas: 
fault management, accounting management, conﬁguration 
management, performance management, and security 
management.
8
Determine the customer’s requirements for new applications, protocols, 
number of users, peak usage hours, security, and network management.
9
Diagram the ﬂow of information for new applications.
10
Isolate the customer’s criteria for accepting the performance of a 
network.
11
List some tools that will help you characterize new network trafﬁc.

48     Chapter 2: Assessing the Existing Network and Identifying Customer Objectives
Step 4
Extract the customer’s application requirements.
•
Document the application requirements.
•
Document any new applications, including the users and the 
information ﬂow.
•
List any new protocols required.
Step 5
Characterize the new network trafﬁc.
•
Characterize the new network trafﬁc using methods similar to 
those you would use to characterize the existing network 
trafﬁc. This is done by using the analysis tools covered earlier 
in the chapter.
•
Capture parameters such as trafﬁc load and trafﬁc behavior.
Step 6
Characterize the performance requirements.
•
Document the customer’s requirements in the following areas:
Response time—Time it takes to respond to a service request 
from a node.
Accuracy—Comparison of useful trafﬁc to transmission errors 
relative to total trafﬁc. 
Availability—Amount of time the network is running
Maximum network utilization—The maximum capacity of the 
network before it is considered to be saturated.
Throughput—Quantity of data transferred between nodes in 
seconds.
Efﬁciency—Measurement of how much effort is required to 
produce a certain amount of data throughput.  
Latency—Time between a node being ready for transmission 
and time for successful completion of the transmission.
Step 7
Identify speciﬁc customer needs.
•
Document any other customer requirements or needs.
Characterizing Network Trafﬁc
This next section is an overview of technologies to help you characterize network trafﬁc.

Characterizing Network Traffic     49
Five areas will be covered in this section:
•
Broadcast behavior
•
Frame size
•
Windowing
•
Flow control
•
Error-recovery mechanisms
Each topic also includes some tables to use as a reference to compare information you would 
have gathered in the previous sections.  
Broadcast and Multicast Behavior
Broadcast behavior is critical to understanding network trafﬁc. Three types of broadcasts and 
multicasts are covered in this exam:
•
Broadcasts and multicasts from desktop protocols, such as AppleTalk, IP, IPX, and 
NetBIOS
•
Broadcasts and multicasts from servers to advertise their services
•
Broadcasts and multicasts from routing protocols such as RIP
The ﬁrst types of broadcasts are those caused by routed or desktop protocols such as TCP/IP, 
AppleTalk, NetWare, and NetBIOS. For example, when your machine looks for an IP address 
from the DHCP server, it sends out a broadcast looking for the addressing service.
There are also applications that send broadcasts from workstations, such as a request for 
printing services. These printer servers advertise their services using broadcasts. Your 
workstation can also broadcast requests to these print servers to ﬁnd out which printer server is 
available to receive the print job.
Routing and bridging protocols also use broadcasts and multicasts; this topic is discussed in 
detail in Chapter 6, “Designing for Speciﬁc Protocols.”
Routers and VLANs control broadcasts and multicasts; therefore, if you have a ﬂat network, 
your broadcast and multicast trafﬁc can adversely affect your network’s performance.  
All these broadcasts and multicasts also affect the CPU of network devices by causing the CPU 
of a machine to process the unnecessary trafﬁc. With the right type of network design, you can 
separate trafﬁc to maximize the bandwidth. The following information comes from Cisco’s 
technical marketing group for the effects of broadcasts:
•
100 broadcasts/multicasts per second used a noticeable 2 percent of the CPU power on a 
Pentium 120 MHz CPU with a 3Com Fast Etherlink PCI Ethernet adapter. 

50     Chapter 2: Assessing the Existing Network and Identifying Customer Objectives
•
1300 broadcasts per second used 9 percent of the CPU power. 
•
3000 broadcasts per second consumed 25 percent of the CPU power. 
•
CPU performance was measurably affected by as few as 30 broadcasts/multicasts per 
second on a generic i386 PC.
•
Macintosh CPUs were affected by as few as 15 broadcasts/multicasts per second.
Table 2-7 contains recommendations for the number of workstations that should populate a 
segment (isolated by a VLAN or a router) for different protocols. Remember that the actual 
number of workstations per segment will depend on other factors, such as size of frames, type 
of trafﬁc, and security. As discussed later in this chapter, workstations can generate varying 
trafﬁc size, depending on their function. Therefore, machines that generate more trafﬁc, such 
as multimedia workstations, should be limited per segment.
Frame Size
To improve network performance, you can manipulate the frame size so that it is the largest 
possible maximum transmission unit (MTU) for ﬁle transfer applications on that medium. Not 
all protocols support MTU conﬁguration, and you must make sure that you avoid increasing the 
MTU too much. This would cause network performance issues because some devices such as 
routers need to process the frame by fragmenting it and then reassembling it. Many vendors and 
industry sources recommend using the default MTU value and not modifying the MTU. 
Remember that the calibration of the MTU should be done with caution.
In an IP network, you might be able to use a protocol stack that supports MTU discovery, which 
will automatically use the largest frame size that doesn’t require any fragmentation. However, 
make sure that you check to see whether this feature is available and enabled.
Windowing and Flow Control
Windowing and ﬂow control are error-control methods. Network-layer protocols use 
windowing and ﬂow control. Some protocols, such as Novell’s traditional NetWare Core

Protocol (NCP), used a method called the ping-pong approach, in which each request generated 
a response that used bandwidth.
IP, however, uses burst-mode protocols. These protocols send as much data as the receiver can 
handle. Examples of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) applications that use this method are 
presented in Table 2-8.
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) does not offer windowing and ﬂow control because it is 
connectionless. UDP, like TCP, is a Layer 4 (transport layer) protocol. Table 2-9 shows the 
applications that use this protocol and the associated port numbers. This type of information is 
often used in access lists and ﬁrewalls.
Error Recovery
Error recovery is a method that a protocol uses to ensure successful transmission of a packet. 
For example, retransmission is a method of error recovery, but if the protocol retransmits the 
data too quickly or too often, it can cause bandwidth degradation.  
Some transport-layer protocols such as UDP don’t use any error-recovery methods, much like 
data link-layer and network-layer protocols. However, connection-oriented protocols such as 
TCP do use error-recovery mechanisms. You can use a protocol analyzer to see whether any of 
your customer’s protocols use effective error-recovery methods.

Characterizing Trafﬁc Loads and Behaviors
The tables in this section cover the different broadcasts and trafﬁc patterns that affect the 
network. The information in these charts can vary depending on use, but you can use these 
tables to understand the relative values and to understand the impact on the network.
In comparison, plain-text information is generally smaller than multimedia or illustrative 
information because of the screen image. For a multimedia or illustrative application, you must 
transfer not only the color and the data, but also the pixels for the actual image. Therefore, a 
dumb terminal part of a mainframe, such as the 3270 terminal emulation application, transfers 
only 4000 bytes. This includes characters and the screen information.
Table 2-10 shows what is added to a data packet based on the protocols used. It is interesting to 
note how the behavior of the protocol, such as 802.3 versus 802.5, differs and how that 
difference correlates to the overhead that protocol carries.

The behaviors of the workstations differ depending on the state of the workstation. This means 
that the workstation’s behavior during a boot process can be different. For example, an 
AppleTalk workstation that had been part of the network will retain its previous network 
number and node and try 10 times to verify that the network.node combination is unique. If the 
AppleTalk station has never been on a network or has moved, it sends 20 multicasts—10 
multicasts with a provisional network number, and 10 multicasts with a network number 
supplied by a router that responded to the ZIPGetNetInfo request. Table 2-12 shows packet 
information for AppleTalk client initialization.

The company wants to use networking technology to compete in the market by 
increasing productivity and identifying new opportunities. The company will use its 
new infrastructure to support the growth of its new ofﬁces.
2 What routed protocols are used in the current network?
IPX, IP, and AppleTalk
3 Which routed protocols will be needed for the new network?
The ﬁnal network will be a pure IP network, but the migration to the new network 
will require AppleTalk.
4 Describe Ms. Phillips’ concerns for stafﬁng and managing her new network.
Ms. Phillips is concerned that she has limited stafﬁng and has not stated that she will 
increase the number of staff that will support her new network. Her new network 
will include new applications as well as new infrastructure, which will require 
experienced staff to support. She is also concerned about the geographic expansion 
and how she would distribute her staff to support the rapid expansion.
5 Describe some beneﬁts of implementing a network management solution.
Ms. Phillips described her staff as having moderate networking skills. There will be 
a substantial implementation of new technology, such as Internet security, new 
routing, and new applications. The network support people will have to be trained to 
support the infrastructure. Therefore, a well-planned centralized network 
management solution would have the following results:
— Cost savings on having to hire new support staff because the IT personnel at 
remote ofﬁces can be supported by more experienced staff located in central 
ofﬁce.
— Diagnosis of problems would be more effective.
— Network management can support proactive monitoring to address possible 
issues before affecting users.
— Increased productivity would result due to a more reliable network.
— Increased devices could be supported with the same number of IT personnel.
— Travel costs would be reduced for sending experienced IT staff to remote ofﬁces.
— The solution would be scalable for additional ofﬁces.

Objectives Covered in This Chapter
The following is a list of the objectives covered in this chapter. The list of all the CCDA 
exam objectives and the chapters in which they are covered can be found in the Introduction 
of this book.
8
Determine the customer’s requirements for new applications, protocols, 
number of users, peak usage hours, security, and network management.
9
Diagram the ﬂow of information for new applications.
12
Predict the amount of trafﬁc and the type of trafﬁc caused by the 
applications, given charts that characterize typical network trafﬁc.

C H A P T E R 3
Application Considerations
The purpose of this chapter is to review the different types of applications that a network 
architect should consider when designing a network. Some network application families 
cannot be routed; others can. The network must provide a way to transport the trafﬁc across 
wide-area network (WAN) links. Some network operating systems produce broadcast 
trafﬁc that can be ﬁltered. A CCDA must be able to identify the types of applications your 
clients use and must understand how those affect the network design.
“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz
The questions in the following quiz are designed to help you gauge how well you know the 
material covered in this chapter. Compare your answers with those found in Appendix A, 
“Answers to Quiz Questions.” If you answer most or all the questions thoroughly and 
correctly, you might want to skim the chapter and proceed to the “Q&A” and “Case 
Studies” sections at the end of the chapter. If you ﬁnd you need to review only certain 
subject matter, search the chapter for those sections that cover the objectives you need to 
review, and then test yourself with these question again, as well as with the “Q&A” and 
“Case Studies” questions. If you ﬁnd the following questions too difﬁcult, read the chapter

IBM Networking
The CCDA objectives covered in this section are:
This section covers the protocols and design methods used when internetworking with legacy 
IBM devices. Source-route bridging (SRB), data-link switching plus (DLSw+), and, brieﬂy, 
Advanced Peer-to-Peer Networking (APPN) are discussed in this section.
Source-Route Bridging
IBM developed SRB in the mid-eighties as a way to bridge between Token Ring local-area 
networks (LANs). In SRB, the source determines the route to arrive at the destination node 
before sending an information frame to it. This differs from Ethernet transparent bridging, 
where the bridges build and maintain tables containing paths to data-link layer destinations. In 
SRB, the source node acquires the routes to destinations on the network using explorer frames.
In Figure 3-1, when a source node wishes to send information to a destination that is not on the 
local LAN, it sends out an explorer frame. Bridges receive the explorer frame in one interface 
and forward the frame out all other interfaces. Bridges add route information, called route 
descriptors, to the frames as they travel throughout the network. The route information includes 
each bridge and ring number over which the explorer frame has traveled (see Figure 3-2). In 
Figure 3-2, when the explorer frame reaches Bridge 6, it adds information about Ring 7/Bridge 
6 and the outgoing Ring 3. At Bridge 4, route information of Bridge 4 and Ring 2 is added. The 
bridge value of the last route descriptor is set to 0, to indicate the destination has been reached. 
The information gathered by the exploration process makes up the routing information ﬁeld 
(RIF) of a Token Ring frame.

Figure 3-2
SRB Ring/Bridge Routing Information
When the explorer frames arrive at the destination, the destination node sets the direction bit 
(also known as the D-bit) to 1 and sends the frame back to the source node via the same route 
it used to arrive at the destination. When multiple reply frames reach the source node, it usually 
uses the route of the ﬁrst frame received. Other decision metrics include the minimum number 
of hops and the path with the largest maximum transmission unit (MTU) allowed.
Unlike transparent bridging, which uses the Spanning-Tree Protocol to form loop-free paths to 
data-link layer destinations, SRB is inherently loop-free and does not rely on the Spanning-Tree 
Protocol when delivering data. SRB can use Spanning-Tree Protocol when sending explorer 
frames, thus reducing the trafﬁc generated during route discovery.
The routing information ﬁeld is contained in the 802.5 frame. It is composed of a 2-byte RIF 
header and may contain one or more route descriptors (see Figure 3-3).

Routing Information Field
In the RIF ﬁrst byte, the ﬁrst 2 bits indicate the type of frame, as follows:
00—Indicates this is a regular frame that should be routed to the destination following the 
information in the route descriptors.
10—Indicates this is an all-rings explorer frame that should take all possible routes to the 
destination.
11—Indicates this is a Spanning-Tree explorer frame that should take only one path to the 
destination.
The next bit is unused. The 5 least signiﬁcant bits in the ﬁrst byte indicate the total length of the 
RIF ﬁeld, including the 2-byte header. A RIF with only one bridge hop is 6 bytes long.
The most signiﬁcant bit in the second byte is the D-bit, which determines whether the route 
descriptors in the RIF header are processed left-to-right or right-to-left. A value of 0 indicates 
left-to-right. A value of 1 indicates right-to-left.
As displayed in Figure 3-3, the next 3 bits indicate the largest frame size that can be handled 
along a designated route (011 indicates 4472 bytes). The lower 4 bits are not used.
As indicated in Figure 3-3, the route descriptors are 2 bytes long. The ﬁrst 12 bits are used to 
indicate the ring number. The 4 least signiﬁcant bits are used to indicate the bridge number.
SRB Design with Cisco Routers
SRB is limited in that it is a ﬂat network topology in the data-link layer. Another limitation is 
the maximum hop count of seven bridges. Token Ring chipsets were originally designed to 
process two rings. Routers can be introduced into the network to help overcome these 
limitations. This is accomplished with the concept of the virtual ring (see Figure 3-4). Consider 
each router interface as a minibridge that connects the external ring to the internal virtual ring. 
The ring number is used in the RIF ﬁeld as in any other physical ring. To conﬁgure the virtual 
ring group, use the global command source-bridge ring-group virtual-ring-group-
number. Each Token Ring LAN is bridged to the virtual ring using the interface command 
source-bridge ring-number bridge-number virtual-ring-group-number.

The virtual ring can be extended to several routers in a cloud, to connect remote Token Rings

Advanced Peer-to-Peer Networking
With the limitations of Systems Network Architecture (SNA) and the growth of 
communications requirements, IBM introduced its second-generation SNA: Advanced Peer-to-
Peer Networking (APPN). With APPN, IBM moved from the mainframe to a peer-based 
hierarchy composed of network nodes (NNs), end nodes (ENs), and low-entry nodes (LENs).
The CCDA test does not include detailed questions on APPN.
Data-Link Switching Plus
Data-link switching (DLSw) is documented in RFC 1795. IBM originally submitted it to the 
IETF as RFC 1434, to overcome some of the limitations on SRB networks, especially in WANs. 
The Cisco implementation of DLSw is called DLSw Plus (DLSw+). Some of the beneﬁts of 
implementing DLSw+ are that link-layer acknowledgements and keep-alive messages of SNA 
and NetBIOS trafﬁc do not have to travel through the WAN. Also, DLSw+ trafﬁc can be 
rerouted around link failures and can be prioritized on WAN links, while SRB does not provide 
this ability. Figure 3-6 shows an example of a DLSw+ network.
Figure 3-6
DLSw+ Network
End systems can attach to the DLSw network from Token Ring, Ethernet, FDDI, Qualiﬁed 
Logical Link Control (QLLC), and Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) networks. 
Although there are other methods, the preferred method for establishing peer connections is 
using TCP. After a connection is established, the peer routers can exchange capabilities. 
Circuits are established between end systems (SNA and NetBIOS). NetBIOS names can be 
conﬁgured to prevent NetBIOS Name Queries from traversing the DLSw network; Media 
Access Control (MAC) addresses can be conﬁgured in the same manner, to reduce SRB 
explorer frames.
The basic conﬁguration of DLSw is quite simple. Each router with attached networks is 
conﬁgured as a local peer. Remote peers are then conﬁgured to remote routers. It is preferable 
to use an IP address assigned to an internal loopback interface as the local peer address. 
Loopback interfaces provide a virtual interface and do not fail if a physical link fails, thus 
providing a stable peer address. For designs with multiple branches connecting to a hub site,

the promiscuous keyword can be used to permit remote peers to connect without being 
individually speciﬁed. See Figure 3-7 for a sample conﬁguration.

Notice that Router A only deﬁnes a remote peer for Router B. It does not need to deﬁne Router 
C as a peer because the promiscuous keyword is used to accept connections from remote 
peers without having to deﬁne them. Router C must deﬁne Router A as a remote peer because 
the promiscuous keyword was not used.
Microsoft Windows Networking
The CCDA objectives covered in this section are as follows:
Microsoft’s network operating system is composed of Windows NT Server and several client 
operating systems—Windows NT Workstation, Windows 95, and Windows 98.
NT Protocols
NT uses the session layer NetBIOS protocol for ﬁle and print sharing, messaging, and name 
resolution. Client PCs discover other nodes on the network using NetBIOS. Users can browse 
the network for shares and services, but NetBIOS produces many broadcasts on the network. 
Services are searched for using NAME_QUERY requests and replies. In its historical 
environment (NetBIOS was created by IBM), NetBIOS runs over NetBEUI. NetBEUI is a data-
link layer protocol that cannot be routed; it must be bridged. Large bridged networks run into

high utilization caused by uncontrollable and unﬁltered broadcasts. NetBIOS over NetBEUI 
does not scale well for large networks; it should only be used in small LANs.
NetBIOS can also run over Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX); in NT, this is called NWLink. 
This solution can be used in small to medium networks or in networks that already are running 
the Novell IPX protocol. This implementation uses IPX packet type 20.
The most scalable solution is to run NetBIOS over TCP/IP. It is recommended for medium to 
large networks. With NetBIOS over TCP/IP, NetBIOS broadcasts still exist, but they run on top 
of TCP port 137. This provides the ability to ﬁlter NetBIOS, if necessary, using TCP port access 
lists.
Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol
Until the Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) was developed, automatic assignment 
of IP addresses to hosts was virtually obsolete. The only method available was BOOTP (RFC 
0951), which required knowledge of the MAC layer address and preconﬁguration of the IP 
address for a particular MAC on a BOOTP server before the station could get an address. If a 
station had to be moved from one subnet to another, the BOOTP server had to be reconﬁgured.
DHCP (RFC 2131/1541/1531) solved these problems by creating address scopes in subnets to 
be assigned automatically to DHCP clients. A scope is a range of subnet addresses used to 
dynamically assign IP addresses. This provides the beneﬁt of being able to move a laptop from 
one subnet to another and be assigned an IP address.
Additional beneﬁts are that other information, called DHCP options, can be automatically 
loaded to the PC client. DHCP options include subnet mask, default gateway, WINS server, 
Domain Name System (DNS) server, TFTP server, and others. Microsoft provides a DHCP 
server application as part of Windows NT. Cisco also provides a DHCP server called Cisco 
DNS/DHCP Manager.
A network designer must keep in mind the locations of DHCP servers in the network. Subnets 
without a local DHCP server require that the router forward the DHCP discover request to the 
DHCP servers. The ip helper-address command is used to accomplish this task. Looking 
at Figure 3-8, the interfaces Ethernet 0 and Ethernet 1 are conﬁgured to forward DHCP discover 
requests to the DHCP server.
The packet contains the source subnet information so that the server knows from which scope 
to assign IP addresses. Ethernet 2 does not need the ip helper-address command because 
the server is on the same subnet.

76     Chapter 3: Application Considerations
Figure 3-8
DHCP Trafﬁc Flow
Windows Internet Naming System 
Microsoft uses NetBIOS to resolve friendly device names to IP addresses in Windows. By 
default, Windows computers send NAME_QUERY broadcasts to all devices on a segment, and 
the device with the NetBIOS-friendly name being requested responds with its IP address. To 
reduce the number of broadcasts generated by NetBIOS devices, it is recommended that 
Windows network clients use the Windows Internet Naming System (WINS).
WINS is a service (included with Windows NT Server) that provides a dynamic NetBIOS name 
registration database similar to the service DNS provides for Internet names. WINS server IP 
addresses can be automatically assigned to PCs using DHCP. Windows clients register their 
NetBIOS names with the WINS server upon startup and then send unicast requests directly to 
the WINS server, to resolve NetBIOS names to IP addresses, virtually eliminating 
NAME_QUERY broadcasts. In Figure 3-9, in the NetBIOS over TCP/IP environment without 
WINS, PC A sends NetBIOS broadcasts for name resolution and will not locate remote clients 
unless the NetBIOS broadcast is bridged across the WAN. As shown on the right of Figure 3-9, 
using WINS, the unicast request generated by PC A is routed, and PC A gets the information 
from the WINS server.

Multimedia Networking
The CCDA objectives covered in this section are as follows:
With the introduction of technologies to integrate data with voice and video, a network designer 
must consider the time-sensitive nature of these applications. Packet voice introduces the ability 
to bypass toll charges by using the data network as a voice transport for telephone calls. When 
designing for video applications, consider using multicasting to reduce the amount of duplicate 
unicast trafﬁc on the network.
Packet Voice
With the converging of data and voice networks, the introduction of packet voice technology 
provides the means for companies to save toll charges on voice telephone calls. Voice is 
digitized into packets, cells, or frames, is sent as data throughout the networks, and is then 
converted back to analog voice (see Figure 3-10). Calls are placed on telephones attached to 
routers. The routers digitize the voice and then forward the calls on the WAN links. If it is 
determined that sufﬁcient bandwidth is not available on the data network, the call is forwarded 
over the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Calls placed outside the company’s 
intranet are forwarded to the PSTN.

Packet Voice
With Voice over IP (VoIP) technology, voice is digitized into IP packets. A dial plan is created 
to list the IP destinations of VoIP telephones and outbound telephones. When a number is dialed 
on a telephone attached to a router, it looks at the digits and routes the call to the appropriate 
destination. For example, in Figure 3-10, if a call to 8-1234 is placed from telephone 6-1234, 
Router A will forward the packets with voice data to Router B. Router B will convert the 
digitized voice into analog signals and send them out its voice interface to telephone 8-1234. 
Table 3-1 shows the dial plan for Router A in Figure 3-10.
In VoIP, Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to transport audio streams. RTP runs over 
User Datagram Protocol (UDP), but there is no speciﬁc port assigned. The only requirement is 
that the data is transported on an even port and RTCP (RTP Control Protocol) is carried on the 
next odd port. However, ports 5004 and 5005 have been reserved for those applications that 
choose to use them.
UDP, in contrast to TCP, is a connectionless protocol that relies on upper layer protocols for 
acknowledgement and error checking. UDP is preferred to TCP for voice due to the time-
sensitive nature of voice transmissions. Since voice applications are sensitive to the 
accumulation of delay, any Quality of Service techniques used on the network must prioritize

these RTP/UDP IP packets over other trafﬁc, such as FTP and HTTP. RTP header compression 
can also be used on WAN links to reduce the size of voice packets.
Video Streams
Video applications generally fall into two types—bidirectional and unidirectional. 
Videoconferencing between remote sites is an example of a point-to-point video application. 
Trafﬁc ﬂow is bidirectional in videoconferencing. The ﬂow of a video stream from one source 
to many users on the network is an example of unidirectional ﬂow.
Multicasting can help reduce the total amount of bandwidth used on the network (see Figure 3-
11). In Figure 3-11, trafﬁc ﬂows through the network, and the video stream is sent to only those 
networks with registered clients. Note that the video stream is sent once from the server; there 
are no duplicate unicasts being sent. The video stream is sent to a multicast address.

In multicast environments, a multicast server registers with its local router as a multicast group 
number. Clients register with the local router, requesting a multicast group. Using a multicast 
routing protocol, the routers determine the paths to forward the video stream through the 
network to only those segments that have a client that requested the multicast group. Client and 
server registration is done using the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). More 
information on IGMP can be found in RFC 1112. The most current multicast routing protocol 
is Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM). For more information on PIM go to http://
www.ietf.org/html.charters/pim-charter.html.
Novell Application Services
The CCDA objectives covered in this section are as follows:
In the Novell IPX environment, network resources advertise their services using the Service 
Advertising Protocol (SAP). These resources are devices such as ﬁle and print servers. Each 
SAP service has a unique SAP number. For example, a ﬁle server is listed as 0004(hex), a 
printer server is listed as 0007(hex), and a Novell SNA gateway is listed as 010f(hex). A list of 
common SAP numbers can be obtained at ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/novell-
sap-numbers.
Routers gather the SAP information, build a SAP table, and then, every 60 seconds, forward 
SAP updates to other routers, out all LAN and WAN segments. Each SAP update may contain 
up to seven services. This trafﬁc is in addition to the IPX Routing Information Protocol (RIP) 
routing table updates, which occur every 60 seconds, at 50 routes per update packet. Even if 
there is no change in the network and no change in the services, this trafﬁc is still generated 
every 60 seconds. In large networks, this broadcast trafﬁc may become too large and overwhelm 
slow WAN links or high utilization networks. There are several ways to reduce the amount of 
SAP trafﬁc:
•
Use IPX SAP ﬁlters—Apply access lists to interfaces, to ﬁlter SAP sources that are 
not necessary in other areas of the network. This can deny local print devices to a segment 
but still permit ﬁle services to other segments. This author has seen a network with a total 
of 1000 SAPs reduced to 300, using SAP ﬁlters. Use access lists in the range from 1000 
to 1099 for SAP ﬁlters.

AppleTalk Services     81
•
Use NetWare Link Services Protocol (NLSP) for routing IPX—NLSP is 
NetWare’s link-state routing protocol (IPX RIP is distance-vector) for routing IPX trafﬁc. 
The beneﬁt is that it does not send routing and service information in a periodic fashion 
but only when a change has occurred. This signiﬁcantly reduces the amount of periodic 
broadcast trafﬁc on the network. NLSP also supports hierarchical network design with 
route summarization.
•
Use Enhanced IGRP (EIGRP) for routing IPX—EIGRP also reduces the 
amount of periodic SAP broadcasts because it sends updates only when changes occur. 
The design involves using IPX RIP in the LAN interfaces on the router and using EIGRP 
for the WAN interfaces. EIGRP automatically redistributes the routes and services to and 
from IPX RIP/SAP.
AppleTalk Services
The CCDA objectives covered in this section are as follows:
AppleTalk uses the concept of zones to form a logical grouping of nodes, similar to the 
workgroups found in the network neighborhood of the Windows environment. Devices look for 
resources in their zone, so groupings are generally departmental, such as engineering, 
marketing, and research. Zones allow users to ﬁnd resources in their workgroup, regardless of 
physical location, without having to browse the entire device list in the Apple Chooser. Zones 
can span networks and can contain nodes in multiple cable ranges on different segments.
Zones control broadcast trafﬁc in AppleTalk networks. As the network grows, more zones can 
be created to control the trafﬁc. The Zone Information Protocol (ZIP) maintains the network-
to-zone mappings in AppleTalk routers. ZIP maintains a zone information table (ZIT) that can 
be viewed on the router. ZIP ﬁlters can be used to control access of a network to applications 
on a zone. For example, a GetZoneList ﬁlter can be conﬁgured to deny access to the Human 
Resources zone for hosts on a speciﬁc network. AppleTalk access lists are from 600 to 699.

Firewall Services
The CCDA objectives covered in this section are as follows:
A ﬁrewall is a system of devices and applications used to protect one network from another 
untrusted network, such as the Internet (see Figure 3-12). Usually it is implemented using a 
three-layer design. On the outside there is a ﬁltering router that implements access lists, to 
permit access to hosts only in the isolation LAN. In the isolation LAN, hosts are installed to 
provide services such as Web server, DNS, FTP servers, e-mail relays, and Telnet. These hosts 
are usually referred to as bastion hosts. An inside ﬁltering router permits access from the 
internal network to the isolation LAN. There should be no devices communicating directly 
from the inside network to the outside router (no back doors).

Figure 3-12 shows a diagram of a three-layer ﬁrewall system. The outside ﬁltering router should 
restrict Telnet access to itself, use static routing, and encrypt passwords. It should permit access 
to the bastion hosts based on speciﬁc TCP/UDP port numbers. Use the established keyword 
to allow inbound TCP packets from established TCP sessions.
The inside ﬁltering router should also allow inbound TCP packets. It should permit access to 
bastion hosts in the isolation LAN, such as proxy services, DNS, and Web servers.
Sites requiring strong security can use the Cisco PIX Firewall in addition to or instead of 
packet-ﬁltering routers. The Cisco PIX Firewall is a hardware device that offers more robust 
security, provides Network Address Translation (NAT), and veriﬁes inbound trafﬁc state 
information. NAT translations can be static and/or dynamic and are veriﬁed on the command-
line interface. The PIX Firewall operates on a secure real-time kernel. An architecture with a 
PIX Firewall could be like that shown in Figure 3-13. The PIX Firewall will control access 
between the outside and the isolation network and between the isolation network and the inside. 
NAT can be used to translate inside node IP addresses to an outside IP address pool.

Mail Application Flow
The CCDA objectives covered in this section are as follows:
Messaging application servers are usually deployed throughout the enterprise, based on the 
number of users and geographical distances. Usually, a hierarchy is used to deploy mail servers. 
E-mail trafﬁc will follow the hierarchy and will be bidirectional. The Simple Mail Transfer 
Protocol (SMTP) gateway will reside at some point near the top of the hierarchy, providing 
transport to Internet messaging. Figure 3-14 shows an example of e-mail trafﬁc ﬂow.

Future Application Plan     85
Future Application Plan
The CCDA objectives covered in this section are as follows:
When designing for current and future applications, document the application characteristics. 
Include information such as the following:
•
Application name.
•
Application type—e-mail, ﬁle, database, and so on.
•
Protocols used—IP (UDP/TCP), IPX, SNA, and so on.
•
Number of users.
•
Number of hosts.
•
Other comments—Include information such as future requirements in Quality of Service, 
Network Address Translation, and scalability.
Attempt to characterize the application trafﬁc ﬂow as one of the following:
•
Terminal/host—These are applications with low-volume character trafﬁc (keyboard 
entries) streams being sent to the host and the host returning many characters (a screen). 
Telnet and TN3720 terminals are examples of this type of trafﬁc ﬂow.
•
Client/server—The trafﬁc ﬂow is bidirectional and asymmetric. Trafﬁc sent to the host 
is usually less than 100 bytes, and the return trafﬁc from the host can be more than 1500 
bytes. Examples include Windows NT, Novell NetWare, AppleShare, Banyan Vines, and 
HTTP.
In HTTP, clients use a web browser, such as Netscape Navigator or MS Explorer, 
to access web servers. Trafﬁc from the client to the server involves URL requests. 
The server sends the web page, which contains text and graphics, to the client. 
Trafﬁc is bidirectional and asymmetric.
In FTP, clients connect to an FTP server. If a get command is issued, ﬁles are 
transferred from the server to the client; if a put command is used, the trafﬁc 
ﬂow is the opposite.

•
Peer/peer—This trafﬁc ﬂow is bidirectional and symmetric. Communications devices 
within a workgroup use the same types of protocols and applications. Users sharing ﬁles 
and directories on their workstations with others is an example of peer-to-peer trafﬁc. 
Other examples include NFS and videoconferencing.
•
Server/server—This type includes trafﬁc between ﬁle servers for directory 
information (Windows NT, Novell), load balancing, and redundancy. E-mail servers also 
communicate, to exchange mail information.

102     Chapter 4: Network Topologies and LAN Design
Foundation Topics
LAN Topology Design
The CCDA objectives covered in this section are as follows:
This section covers CCDA exam objectives about designing network topologies for the LAN. 
LANs provide data transfer rates that are typically much faster than wide-area networks 
(WANs). While most companies own their own LAN infrastructure, wide-area connections 
between LANs are usually leased on a monthly basis from an outside carrier. With the recent 
developments in Gigabit Ethernet technologies, LAN designs are now capable of 1000 Mbps 
speeds. High-speed Gigabit links can connect servers to LAN switches. At these speeds, the 
capacity is there to meet the performance requirements of current high-bandwidth applications.
Various speeds of Ethernet have evolved into the de facto standard for LANs. Ethernet uses a 
contention-based access method, meaning each device competes simultaneously for access to 
the network. All devices attached to the same Ethernet segment form a collision domain. Each 
device transmitting on that segment may attempt to transmit at the same time as another device 
on the same segment, resulting in a collision. As the number of devices in the same collision 
domain increases, so do the collisions, resulting in poorer performance.
Although not discussed in newer switched (bridged) networks, legacy Ethernet networks with 
repeaters and hubs should limit the size of the collision domain. To scale multiprotocol 
networks and networks with high-bandwidth applications, limit the size of collision domains 
using bridges, switches, and routers. This is covered in the section “LAN Hardware” later in the 
chapter.
Three different network topology models are discussed in the following sections:
•
Hierarchical models
•
Redundant models
•
Secure models
Hierarchical Models
Hierarchical models enable you to design internetworks in layers. To understand the importance 
of layering, consider the Open System Interconnection (OSI) reference model, which is a

of standard internetwork topologies.

Draw a topology map that meets the customer’s needs and includes a high-
level view of internetworking devices and interconnecting media.

LAN Topology Design     103
layered model for implementing computer communications. Using layers, the OSI model 
simpliﬁes the tasks required for two computers to communicate. Hierarchical models for 
internetwork design also use layers to simplify the tasks required for internetworking. Each 
layer can be focused on speciﬁc functions, allowing you to choose the right systems and 
features for each layer. Hierarchical models apply to both LAN and WAN design.
Beneﬁts of Hierarchical Models
The many beneﬁts of using hierarchical models for your network design include the following:
•
Cost savings
•
Ease of understanding
•
Easy network growth
•
Improved fault isolation
After adopting hierarchical design models, many organizations report cost savings because they 
are no longer trying to do it all in one routing/switching platform. The modular nature of the 
model enables appropriate use of bandwidth within each layer of the hierarchy, reducing wasted 
capacity.
Keeping each design element simple and small facilitates ease of understanding, which helps 
control training and staff costs. Management responsibility and network management systems 
can be distributed to the different layers of modular network architectures, which also helps 
control management costs.
Hierarchical design facilitates changes. In a network design, modularity allows creating design 
elements that can be replicated as the network grows, facilitating easy network growth. As each 
element in the network design requires change, the cost and complexity of making the upgrade 
is contained to a small subset of the overall network. In large, ﬂat, or meshed network 
architectures, changes tend to impact a large number of systems.
Improved fault isolation is facilitated by structuring the network into small, easy-to-understand 
elements. Network managers can easily understand the transition points in the network, which 
helps identify failure points.
Today’s fast-converging protocols were designed for hierarchical topologies. To control the 
impact of routing overhead processing and bandwidth consumption, modular hierarchical 
topologies must be used with protocols designed with these controls in mind, such as EIGRP. 
Route summarization is facilitated by hierarchical network design. Route summarization 
reduces the routing protocol overhead on links in the network and reduces routing protocol 
processing within the routers.

104     Chapter 4: Network Topologies and LAN Design
Hierarchical Network Design
As Figure 4-1 illustrates, a hierarchical network design has three layers:
•
The core layer provides optimal transport between sites.
•
The distribution layer provides policy-based connectivity.
•
The access layer provides workgroup/user access to the network.
Figure 4-1
A Hierarchical Network Design Has Three Layers: Core, Distribution, and Access
Each layer provides necessary functionality to the network. The layers do not need to be 
implemented as distinct physical entities. Each layer can be implemented in routers or switches, 
represented by a physical media, or combined in a single box. A particular layer can be omitted 
altogether, but for optimum performance, a hierarchy should be maintained.
Core Layer
The core layer is the high-speed switching backbone of the network, which is crucial to enable 
corporate communications. The core layer should have the following characteristics:
•
Offer high reliability
•
Provide redundancy
•
Provide fault tolerance
•
Adapt to changes quickly
•
Offer low latency and good manageability
•
Avoid slow packet manipulation caused by ﬁlters or other processes
•
Have a limited and consistent diameter

LAN Topology Design     105
NOTE
When routers are used in a network, the number of router hops from edge to edge is called the 
diameter. As noted, it is considered good practice to design for a consistent diameter within a 
hierarchical network. This means that from any end station to another end station across the 
backbone, there should be the same number of hops. The distance from any end station to a 
server on the backbone should also be consistent.
Limiting the diameter of the internetwork provides predictable performance and ease of 
troubleshooting. Distribution layer routers and client LANs can be added to the hierarchical 
model without increasing the diameter because neither will affect how existing end stations 
communicate.
Distribution Layer
The distribution layer of the network is the demarcation point between the access and core 
layers of the network. The distribution layer can have many roles, including implementing the 
following functions:
•
Policy (for example, to ensure that trafﬁc sent from a particular network should be 
forwarded out one interface, while all other trafﬁc should be forwarded out another 
interface)
•
Security
•
Address or area aggregation or summarization
•
Departmental or workgroup access
•
Broadcast/multicast domain deﬁnition
•
Routing between virtual LANs (VLANs)
•
Media translations (for example, between Ethernet and Token Ring)
•
Redistribution between routing domains (for example, between two different routing 
protocols)
•
Demarcation between static and dynamic routing protocols
Several Cisco IOS software features can be used to implement policy at the distribution layer, 
including the following:
•
Filtering by source or destination address
•
Filtering on input or output ports
•
Hiding internal network numbers by route ﬁltering
•
Static routing

106     Chapter 4: Network Topologies and LAN Design
•
Quality of service mechanisms (for example, to ensure that all devices along a path can 
accommodate the requested parameters)
Access Layer
The access layer provides user access to local segments on the network. The access layer is 
characterized by switched and shared bandwidth LANs in a campus environment. 
Microsegmentation, using LAN switches, provides high bandwidth to workgroups by dividing 
collision domains on Ethernet segments and reducing the number of stations capturing the 
token on Token Ring LANs.
For small ofﬁce/home ofﬁce (SOHO) environments, the access layer provides access for remote 
sites into the corporate network by using WAN technologies such as ISDN, Frame Relay, and 
leased lines. Features such as dial-on-demand routing (DDR) and static routing can be 
implemented to control costs.
Hierarchical Model Examples
For small- to medium-sized companies, the hierarchical model is often implemented as a hub-
and-spoke topology, as shown in Figure 4-2. Corporate headquarters forms the hub and links to 
the remote ofﬁces form the spokes.

Redundant Models
When designing a network topology for a customer who has critical systems, services, or 
network paths, you should determine the likelihood that these components will fail and design 
redundancy where necessary.
Consider incorporating one of the following types of redundancy into your design:
•
Workstation-to-router redundancy
•
Server redundancy
•
Route redundancy
•
Media redundancy
Each of these types of redundancy is elaborated in the sections that follow.
Workstation-to-Router Redundancy
When a workstation has trafﬁc to send to a station that is not local, the workstation has many 
possible ways to discover the address of a router on its network segment, including the 
following:
•
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
•
Explicit conﬁguration
•
Router Discovery Protocol (RDP)
•
Routing Information Protocol (RIP) 
•
Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX)
•
AppleTalk
•
Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)
The sections that follow cover each of these methods.
ARP
Some IP workstations send an ARP frame to ﬁnd a remote station. A router running proxy ARP 
can respond with its data link layer address. Cisco routers run proxy ARP by default.
Explicit Conﬁguration
Most IP workstations must be conﬁgured with the IP address of a default router. This is 
sometimes called the default gateway.

LAN Topology Design     109
In an IP environment, the most common method for a workstation to ﬁnd a server is via explicit 
conﬁguration (default router). If the workstation’s default router becomes unavailable, the 
workstation must be reconﬁgured with the address of a different router. Some IP stacks enable 
you to conﬁgure multiple default routers, but many other IP stacks do not support redundant 
default routers.
RDP
RFC 1256 speciﬁes an extension to the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) that allows 
an IP workstation and router to run RDP to facilitate the workstation learning the address of a 
router.
RIP 
An IP workstation can run RIP to learn about routers. RIP should be used in passive mode rather 
than active mode. (Active mode means that the station sends RIP frames every 30 seconds.) The 
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol also supports a workstation running RIP.
IPX
An IPX workstation broadcasts a ﬁnd network number message to ﬁnd a route to a server. A 
router then responds. If the client loses its connection to the server, it automatically sends the 
message again.
AppleTalk
An AppleTalk workstation remembers the address of the router that sent the last Routing Table 
Maintenance Protocol (RTMP) packet. As long as there are one or more routers on an AppleTalk 
workstation’s network, it has a route to remote devices.
HSRP
Cisco’s HSRP provides a way for IP workstations to keep communicating on the internetwork 
even if their default router becomes unavailable. HSRP works by creating a phantom router that 
has its own IP and MAC addresses. The workstations use this phantom router as their default 
router.
HSRP routers on a LAN communicate among themselves to designate two routers as active and 
standby. The active router sends periodic hello messages. The other HSRP routers listen for the 
hello messages. If the active router fails and the other HSRP routers stop receiving hello 
messages, the standby router takes over and becomes the active router. Because the new active 
router assumes both the IP and MAC addresses of the phantom, end nodes see no change at all. 

110     Chapter 4: Network Topologies and LAN Design
They continue to send packets to the phantom router’s MAC address, and the new active router 
delivers those packets.
HSRP also works for proxy ARP. When an active HSRP router receives an ARP request for a 
node that is not on the local LAN, the router replies with the phantom router’s MAC address 
instead of its own. If the router that originally sent the ARP reply later loses its connection, the 
new active router can still deliver the trafﬁc.
Figure 4-5 shows a sample implementation of HSRP.
Figure 4-5
An Example of HSRP: The Phantom Router Represents the Real Routers
In Figure 4-5, the following sequence occurs:
1 The Anderson workstation is conﬁgured to use the Phantom router as its default router.
2 Upon booting, the routers elect Broadway as the HSRP active router. The active router 
does the work for the HSRP phantom. Central Park is the HSRP standby router.
3 When Anderson sends an ARP frame to ﬁnd its default router, Broadway responds with 
the Phantom router’s MAC address.
4 If Broadway goes off line, Central Park takes over as the active router, continuing the 
delivery of Anderson’s packets. The change is transparent to Anderson. If a third HSRP 
router was on the LAN, that router would begin to act as the new standby router.
Server Redundancy
In some environments, fully redundant (mirrored) ﬁle servers should be recommended. For 
example, in a brokerage ﬁrm where traders must access data in order to buy and sell stocks, the 
data can be replicated on two or more redundant servers. The servers should be on different 
networks and power supplies.

If complete server redundancy is not feasible due to cost considerations, mirroring or duplexing 
of the ﬁle server hard drives is a good idea. Mirroring means synchronizing two disks, while 
duplexing is the same as mirroring with the additional feature that the two mirrored hard drives 
are controlled by different disk controllers.
Route Redundancy
Designing redundant routes has two purposes: load balancing and minimizing downtime.
Load Balancing
AppleTalk and IPX routers can remember only one route to a remote network by default, so they 
do not support load balancing. You can change this for IPX by using the ipx maximum-
paths command and for AppleTalk by using the appletalk maximum-paths command 
on a Cisco router.
Most IP routing protocols can load balance across up to six parallel links that have equal cost. 
Use the maximum-paths command to change the number of links that the router will load 
balance over for IP; the default is four, the maximum is six. To support load balancing, keep the 
bandwidth consistent within a layer of the hierarchical model so that all paths have the same 
cost. (Cisco’s IGRP and EIGRP are exceptions because they can load balance trafﬁc across 
multiple routes that have different metrics by using a feature called variance.)
A hop-based routing protocol does load balancing over unequal bandwidth paths as long as the 
hop count is equal. After the slower link becomes saturated, the higher-capacity link cannot be 
ﬁlled; this is called pinhole congestion. Pinhole congestion can be avoided by designing equal 
bandwidth links within one layer of the hierarchy or by using a routing protocol that takes 
bandwidth into account.
IP load balancing depends on which switching mode is used on a router. Process switching load 
balances on a packet-by-packet basis. Fast, autonomous, silicon, optimum, distributed, and 
NetFlow switching load balance on a destination-by-destination basis because the processor 
caches the encapsulation to a speciﬁc destination for these types of switching modes.
Minimizing Downtime
In addition to facilitating load balancing, redundant routes minimize network downtime.
As already discussed, you should keep bandwidth consistent within a given layer of a hierarchy 
to facilitate load balancing. Another reason to keep bandwidth consistent within a layer of a 
hierarchy is that routing protocols converge much faster if multiple equal-cost paths to a 
destination network exist.

112     Chapter 4: Network Topologies and LAN Design
By using redundant, meshed network designs, you can minimize the effect of link failures. 
Depending on the convergence time of the routing protocols being used, a single link failure 
will not have a catastrophic effect. 
A network can be designed as a full mesh or a partial mesh. In a full mesh network, every router 
has a link to every other router, as shown in Figure 4-6. A full mesh network provides complete 
redundancy and also provides good performance because there is just a single-hop delay 
between any two sites. The number of links in a full mesh is n(n–1)/2, where n is the number 
of routers. Each router is connected to every other router. (Divide the result by 2 to avoid 
counting Router X to Router Y and Router Y to Router X as two different links.)
Figure 4-6
Full Mesh Network: Every Router Has a Link to Every Other Router in the Network
A full mesh network can be expensive to implement in wide-area networks due to the required 
number of links. In addition, practical limits to scaling exist for groups of routers that broadcast 
routing updates or service advertisements. As the number of router peers increases, the amount 
of bandwidth and CPU resources devoted to processing broadcasts increases.
A suggested guideline is to keep broadcast trafﬁc at less than 20 percent of the bandwidth of 
each link; this will limit the number of peer routers that can exchange routing tables or service 
advertisements. When planning redundancy, follow guidelines for simple, hierarchical design. 
Figure 4-7 illustrates a classic hierarchical and redundant enterprise design that uses a partial 
mesh rather than a full mesh architecture. For LAN designs, links between the access and 
distribution layer can be Fast Ethernet, with links to the core at Gigabit Ethernet speeds.

Figure 4-7
Partial Mesh Design with Redundancy
Media Redundancy
In mission-critical applications, it is often necessary to provide redundant media.
In switched networks, switches can have redundant links to each other. This redundancy is good 
because it minimizes downtime, but it may result in broadcasts continuously circling the 
network, which is called a broadcast storm. Because Cisco switches implement the IEEE 
802.1d Spanning-Tree Algorithm, this looping can be avoided in the Spanning-Tree Protocol. 
The Spanning-Tree Algorithm guarantees that only one path is active between two network 
stations. The algorithm permits redundant paths that are automatically activated when the active 
path experiences problems.
Because WAN links are often critical pieces of the internetwork, redundant media is often 
deployed in WAN environments. As shown in Figure 4-8, backup links can be provisioned so 
they become active when a primary link goes down or becomes congested.

Backup Links Can Be Used to Provide Redundancy
Often, backup links use a different technology. For example, a leased line can be in parallel with 
a backup dialup line or ISDN circuit. By using ﬂoating static routes, you can specify that the 
backup route has a higher administrative distance (used by Cisco routers to select which routing 
information to use) so that it is not normally used unless the primary route goes down.
NOTE
When provisioning backup links, learn as much as possible about the actual physical circuit 
routing. Different carriers sometimes use the same facilities, meaning that your backup path is 
susceptible to the same failures as your primary path. You should do some investigative work 
to ensure that your backup really is acting as a backup.
Backup links can be combined with load balancing and channel aggregation. Channel 
aggregation means that a router can bring up multiple channels (for example, Integrated 
Services Digital Network [ISDN] B channels) as bandwidth requirements increase.
Cisco supports the Multilink Point-to-Point Protocol (MPPP), which is an Internet Engineering 
Task Force (IETF) standard for ISDN B channel (or asynchronous serial interface) aggregation. 
MPPP does not specify how a router should accomplish the decision-making process to bring 
up extra channels. Instead, it seeks to ensure that packets arrive in sequence at the receiving 
router. Then, the data is encapsulated within PPP and the datagram is given a sequence number.

At the receiving router, PPP uses this sequence number to re-create the original data stream. 
Multiple channels appear as one logical link to upper-layer protocols.
Secure Models
This section introduces secure topology models. The information in this book is not sufﬁcient 
to learn all the nuances of internetwork security. To learn more about internetwork security, you 
might want to read the book Firewalls and Internet Security, by Bill Cheswick and Steve 
Bellovin, published by Addison Wesley. Also, by searching for the word “security” on Cisco’s 
web site (www.cisco.com), you can keep up to date on security issues.
Secure topologies are often designed by using a ﬁrewall. A ﬁrewall protects one network from 
another untrusted network. This protection can be accomplished in many ways, but in principle, 
a ﬁrewall is a pair of mechanisms: One blocks trafﬁc and the other permits trafﬁc.
Some ﬁrewalls place a greater emphasis on blocking trafﬁc, and others emphasize permitting 
trafﬁc. Figure 4-9 shows a simple ﬁrewall topology using routers.
Figure 4-9
A Simple Firewall Network, Using Routers
You can design a ﬁrewall system using packet-ﬁltering routers and bastion hosts. A bastion host 
is a secure host that supports a limited number of applications for use by outsiders. It holds data 
that outsiders access (for example, web pages) but is strongly protected from outsiders using it 
for anything other than its limited purposes.

Three-Part Firewall System
The classic ﬁrewall system, called the three-part ﬁrewall system, has the following three 
specialized layers, as shown in Figure 4-10:
•
An isolation LAN that is a buffer between the corporate internetwork and the outside 
world. (The isolation LAN is called the demilitarized zone (DMZ) in some literature.)
•
A router that acts as an inside packet ﬁlter between the corporate internetwork and the 
isolation LAN.
•
Another router that acts as an outside packet ﬁlter between the isolation LAN and the 
outside internetwork.
Figure 4-10
Structure and Components of a Three-Part Firewall System
Services available to the outside world are located on bastion hosts in the isolation LAN. 
Example services in these hosts include:
•
Anonymous FTP server
•
Web server
•
Domain Name System (DNS)
•
Telnet
•
Specialized security software such as Terminal Access Controller Access Control System 
(TACACS)

The isolation LAN has a unique network number that is different than the corporate network 
number. Only the isolation LAN network is visible to the outside world. On the outside ﬁlter, 
you should advertise only the route to the isolation LAN.
If internal users need to get access to Internet services, allow TCP outbound trafﬁc from the 
internal corporate internetwork. Allow TCP packets back into the internal network only if they 
are in response to a previously sent request. All other TCP trafﬁc should be blocked because 
new inbound TCP sessions could be from hackers trying to establish sessions with internal 
hosts.
NOTE
To determine whether TCP trafﬁc is a response to a previously sent request or a request for a 
new session, the router examines some bits in the code ﬁeld of the TCP header. If the 
acknowledgement ﬁeld (ACK) is valid or reset the connection (RST) bits are set in a TCP 
segment header, the segment is a response to a previously sent request. The established keyword 
in Cisco IOS access lists (ﬁlters) is used to indicate packets with ACK or RST bits set.
The following list summarizes some rules for the three-part ﬁrewall system:
•
The inside packet ﬁlter router should allow inbound TCP packets from established 
sessions.
•
The outside packet ﬁlter router should allow inbound TCP packets from established TCP 
sessions.
•
The outside packet ﬁlter router should also allow packets to speciﬁc TCP or UDP ports 
going to speciﬁc bastion hosts (including TCP SYN packets that are used to establish a 
session).
Always block trafﬁc from coming in from between the ﬁrewall routers and hosts and the 
internal network. The ﬁrewall routers and hosts themselves are likely to be a jumping-off point 
for hackers, as shown in Figure 4-11.

118     Chapter 4: Network Topologies and LAN Design
Figure 4-11
Firewall Routers and Hosts May Make Your Network Vulnerable to Hacker Attacks
Keep bastion hosts and ﬁrewall routers simple. They should run as few programs as possible. 
The programs should be simple because simple programs have fewer bugs than complex 
programs. Bugs introduce possible security holes.
Do not enable any unnecessary services or connections on the outside ﬁlter router. A list of 
suggestions for implementing the outside ﬁlter router follows:
•
Turn off Telnet access (no virtual terminals deﬁned).
•
Use static routing only.
•
Do not make it a TFTP server.
•
Use password encryption.
•
Turn off proxy ARP service.
•
Turn off ﬁnger service.
•
Turn off IP redirects.
•
Turn off IP route caching.
•
Do not make the router a MacIP server (MacIP provides connectivity for IP over 
AppleTalk by tunneling IP datagrams inside AppleTalk).
 Cisco PIX Firewall
To provide stalwart security, hardware ﬁrewall devices can be used in addition to or instead of 
packet-ﬁltering routers. For example, in the three-part ﬁrewall system illustrated earlier in 
Figure 4-10, a hardware ﬁrewall device could be installed on the isolation LAN. A hardware 
ﬁrewall device offers the following beneﬁts:
•
Less complex and more robust than packet ﬁlters

Cisco’s PIX Firewall is a hardware device that offers the features in the preceding list, as well 
as full outbound Internet access from unregistered internal hosts. IP addresses can be assigned 
from the private ranges, as deﬁned in RFC 1918 (available at http://info.internet.isi.edu/in-
notes/rfc/ﬁles/rfc1918.txt). The PIX Firewall uses a protection scheme called Network Address 
Translation (NAT), which allows internal users access to the Internet while protecting internal 
networks from unauthorized access. 
Further details on the PIX Firewall are available on Cisco’s web site at www.cisco.com/warp/
public/cc/cisco/mkt/security/pix/.
The PIX Firewall provides ﬁrewall security without the administrative overhead and risks 
associated with UNIX-based or router-based ﬁrewall systems. The PIX Firewall operates on a 
secure real-time kernel, not on UNIX. The network administrator is provided with complete 
auditing of all transactions, including attempted break-ins.
The PIX Firewall supports data encryption with the Cisco PIX Private Link, a card that provides 
secure communication between multiple PIX systems over the Internet using the data 
encryption standard (DES).
The PIX Firewall provides TCP and UDP connectivity from internal networks to the outside 
world by using a scheme called adaptive security. All inbound trafﬁc is veriﬁed for correctness 
against the following connection state information:
•
Source and destination IP addresses
•
Source and destination port numbers
•
Protocols
•
TCP sequence numbers (which are randomized to eliminate the possibility of hackers 
guessing numbers)
 LAN Types
The CCDA objective covered in this section is as follows:
Local-area networks can be classiﬁed as a large building LAN, campus LAN, or small/remote 
LAN. The large building LAN contains the major data center with high-speed access and ﬂoor 
communications closets; the large building LAN is usually the headquarters in larger

companies. Campus LANs provide connectivity between buildings on a campus; redundancy 
is usually a requirement. Small/remote LANs provide connectivity to remote ofﬁces with a 
small number of nodes.
It is important to remember the Cisco hierarchical approach of network design. First, build a 
high-speed core backbone network. Second, build the distribution layer, where policy can be 
applied. Finally, build the access layer, where LANs provide access to the network end stations.
Large Building LANs
Large building LANs are segmented by ﬂoors or departments. Company mainframes and 
servers reside in a computing center. Media lines run from the computer center to the wiring 
closets at the various segments. From the wiring closets, media lines run to the ofﬁces and 
cubicles around the work areas. Figure 4-12 depicts a typical large building design.
Figure 4-12
Large Building LAN Design
Each ﬂoor may have more than 200 users. Following a hierarchical model of access, 
distribution, and core, Ethernet and Fast Ethernet nodes may connect to hubs and switches in 
the communications closet. Uplink ports from closet switches connect back to one or two (for 
redundancy) distribution switches. Distribution switches may provide connectivity to server 
farms that provide business applications, DHCP, DNS, intranet, and other services.

LAN Types     121
Campus LANs
A campus LAN connects two or more buildings located near each other using high-bandwidth 
LAN media. Usually the media (for example, copper or ﬁber) is owned. High-speed switching 
devices are recommended to minimize latency. In today’s networks, Gigabit Ethernet campus 
backbones are the standard for new installations. In Figure 4-13, campus buildings are 
connected by using Layer 3 switches with Gigabit Ethernet media.
Figure 4-13
Campus LANs
Ensure that a hierarchical design is implemented on the campus LAN and that network layer 
addressing is assigned to control broadcasts on the networks. Each building should have 
addressing assigned in such a way as to maximize address summarization. Apply contiguous 
subnets to buildings at the bit boundary to apply summarization and ease the design. Campus 
networks can support high-bandwidth applications such as video conferencing. Although most 
WAN implementations are conﬁgured to support only IP, legacy LANs may still be conﬁgured 
to support IPX and AppleTalk.
Small/Remote Site LANs
Small/remote sites usually connect back to the corporate network via a small router 
(Cisco 2500). The local-area network service is provided by a small hub or LAN switch 
(Catalyst 1900). The router ﬁlters broadcasts to the WAN circuit and forwards packets that 
require services from the corporate network. A server may be placed at the small/remote site to 
provide DHCP and other local applications such as NT backup domain controller and DNS; if 
not, the router will need to be conﬁgured to forward DHCP broadcasts and other types of 
services. Figure 4-14 shows a typical architecture of a small or remote LAN. Building Cisco 
Remote Access Networks from Cisco Press is an excellent resource for more information on 
remote access.

The most signiﬁcant design rule for Ethernet is that the round-trip propagation delay in one 
collision domain must not exceed 512 bit times, which is a requirement for collision detection 
to work correctly. This rule means that the maximum round-trip delay for a 10 Mbps Ethernet 
network is 51.2 microseconds. The maximum round-trip delay for a 100 Mbps Ethernet 
network is only 5.12 microseconds because the bit time on a 100 Mbps Ethernet network is 0.01 
microseconds as opposed to 0.1 microseconds on a 10 Mbps Ethernet network.
To make 100 Mbps Ethernet work, distance limitations are much more severe than those 
required for 10 Mbps Ethernet. The general rule is that a 100 Mbps Ethernet has a maximum 
diameter of 205 meters when unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cabling is used, whereas 10 Mbps 
Ethernet has a maximum diameter of 500 meters with 10BaseT and 2500 meters with 10Base5.

allows data terminal equipment (DTE) end-node connections rather than just repeaters, which 
were allowed with the older FOIRL speciﬁcation.
100 Mbps Fast Ethernet Design Rules
100 Mbps Ethernet, or Fast Ethernet, topologies present some distinct constraints on the 
network design because of their speed. The combined latency due to cable lengths and repeaters 
must conform to the speciﬁcations in order for the network to work properly. This section 
discusses these issues and provides example calculations.
Understanding Collision Domains
The overriding design rule for 100 Mbps Ethernet networks is that the round-trip collision delay 
must not exceed 512 bit times. However, the bit time on a 100 Mbps Ethernet network is 0.01 
microseconds, as opposed to 0.1 microseconds on a 10 Mbps Ethernet network. Therefore, the 
maximum round-trip delay for a 100 Mbps Ethernet network is 5.12 microseconds, as opposed 
to the more lenient 51.2 microseconds in a 10 Mbps Ethernet network.

100BaseT Repeaters
For a 100 Mbps Ethernet to work, you must impose distance limitations based on the type of 
repeaters used.
The IEEE 100BaseT speciﬁcation deﬁnes two types of repeaters: Class I and Class II. Class I 
repeaters have a latency (delay) of 0.7 microseconds or less. Only one repeater hop is allowed. 
Class II repeaters have a latency (delay) of 0.46 microseconds or less. One or two repeater hops 
are allowed.
Table 4-3 shows the maximum size of collision domains, depending on the type of repeater.
The Cisco FastHub 316 is a Class II repeater, as are all the Cisco FastHub 300 series hubs. 
These hubs actually exceed the Class II speciﬁcations, which means that they have even lower 
latencies and therefore allow longer cable lengths. For example, with two FastHub 300 
repeaters and copper cable, the maximum collision domain is 223 meters.

Other topologies are possible as long as the round-trip propagation delay does not exceed 5.12 
microseconds (512 bit times). When the delay does exceed 5.12 microseconds, the network 
experiences illegal (late) collisions and CRC errors.
Checking the Propagation Delay
To determine whether conﬁgurations other than the standard ones shown in Figure 4-15 will 
work, use the following information from the IEEE 802.3u speciﬁcation.
To check a path to make sure the path delay value (PDV) does not exceed 512 bit times, add up 
the following delays:
•
All link segment delays
•
All repeater delays
•
DTE delay
•
A safety margin (0 to 5 bit times)
Use the following steps to calculate the PDV:
1 Determine the delay for each link segment; this is the link segment delay value (LSDV), 
including interrepeater links, using the following formula. (Multiply by two so it is a 
round-trip delay.)
LSDV = 2 × segment length × cable delay for this segment.

LAN Media     127
For end-node segments, the segment length is the cable length between the physical 
interface at the repeater and the physical interface at the DTE. Use your two farthest DTEs 
for a worst-case calculation. For interrepeater links, the segment length is the cable length 
between the repeater physical interfaces.
Cable delay is the delay speciﬁed by the manufacturer if available. When actual cable 
lengths or propagation delays are not known, use the delay in bit times as speciﬁed in 
Table 4-4.
Cable delay must be speciﬁed in bit times per meter (BT/m).
2 Add together the LSDVs for all segments in the path.
3 Determine the delay for each repeater in the path. If model-speciﬁc data is not available 
from the manufacturer, determine the class of repeater (I or II).
4 MII cables for 100BaseT should not exceed 0.5 meters each in length. When evaluating 
system topology, MII cable lengths need not be accounted for separately. Delays 
attributed to the MII are incorporated into DTE and repeater delays.
5 Use the DTE delay value shown in Table 4-4 unless your equipment manufacturer deﬁnes 
a different value.
6 Decide on an appropriate safety margin from 0 to 5 bit times. Five bit times is a safe value.
7 Insert the values obtained from the preceding calculations into the formula for calculating 
the PDV:
PDV = link delays + repeater delays + DTE delay + safety margin
8 If the PDV is less than 512, the path is qualiﬁed in terms of worst-case delay.
Round-Trip Delay
Table 4-4 shows round-trip delay in bit times for standard cables and maximum round-trip delay 
in bit times for DTEs, repeaters, and maximum-length cables.

128     Chapter 4: Network Topologies and LAN Design
NOTE
Note that the values shown in Table 4-4 have been multiplied by two to provide a round-trip 
delay. If you use these numbers, you need not multiply by two again in the LSDV formula 
(LSDV = 2 × segment length × cable delay for this segment).
Example Network Cabling Implementation
See Figure 4-16 for this example. Company ABC has all UTP Category 5 cabling. Two Class 
II repeaters are separated by 20 meters instead of the standard 5 meters. The network 
administrators are trying to determine whether this conﬁguration will work.

An Example Network Cabling Implementation for Company ABC (Showing the Two Most Distant DTEs)
To ensure that the PDV does not exceed 512 bit times, the network administrators must 
calculate a worst-case scenario using DTE 1 and DTE 2, which are 75 meters from their 
repeaters.
Assume that DTE 1 starts transmitting a minimum-sized frame of 64 bytes (512 bits). DTE 2 
just barely misses hearing DTE 1’s transmission and starts transmitting also. The collision 
happens on the far-right side of the network and must traverse back to DTE 1. These events 
must occur within 512 bit times. If they take any longer than 512 bit times, then DTE 1 will 
have stopped sending when it learns about the collision and will not know that its frame was 
damaged by the collision. To calculate the link delays for the Category 5 cable segments, the 
repeaters, and DTEs, the administrators use the values from Table 4-4. (Remember that Table 
4-4 uses round-trip delay values, so you need not multiply by two.)
To test whether this network will work, the network administrators ﬁlled in Table 4-5.

Table 4-7 lists some scalability concerns when designing Token Ring segments. Refer to IBM’s 
Token Ring planning guides for more information on the maximum segment sizes and 
maximum diameter of a network.
Gigabit Ethernet Design Rules
The most recent development in the Ethernet arena is Gigabit Ethernet. Gigabit Ethernet is 
speciﬁed by two standards: IEEE 802.3z and 802.3ab. The 802.3z standard speciﬁes the 
operation of Gigabit Ethernet over ﬁber and coaxial cable and introduces the Gigabit Media 
Independent Interface (GMII). The 802.3z standard was approved in June 1998.

The 802.3ab standard speciﬁes the operation of Gigabit Ethernet over Category 5 UTP. Gigabit 
Ethernet still retains the frame formats and frame sizes and it still uses CSMA/CD. As with 
Ethernet and Fast Ethernet, full duplex operation is possible. Differences can be found in the 
encoding; Gigabit Ethernet uses 8B/10B coding with simple nonreturn to zero (NRZ). Because 
of the 20 percent overhead, pulses run at 1250 MHz to achieve a 1000 Mbps. Table 4-8 covers 
Gigabit Ethernet scalability constraints.
 FDDI Design Rules
The FDDI speciﬁcation does not actually specify the maximum segment length or network 
diameter. It speciﬁes the amount of allowed power loss, which works out to the approximate 
distances shown in Table 4-9.

LAN Hardware
The CCDA objectives covered in this section are as follows:
This section covers the following hardware technologies as they can be applied to LAN design:
•
Repeaters
•
Hubs
•
Bridges
•
Switches
•
Routers
•
Layer 3 switches
•
Combining hubs, switches, and routers
Repeaters
Repeaters are the basic unit used in networks to connect separate segments. Repeaters take 
incoming frames, regenerate the preamble, amplify the signals, and send the frame out all other 
interfaces. Repeaters operate in the physical layer of the OSI model. Because repeaters are not 
aware of packets or frame formats, they do not control broadcasts or collision domains. 
Repeaters are said to be protocol transparent because they are not aware of upper-layer 
protocols such as IP, IPX, and so on.
One basic rule of using repeaters is the 5-4-3 Rule. The maximum path between two stations 
on the network should not be more than 5 segments with 4 repeaters between those segments 
and no more than 3 populated segments. Repeaters introduce a small amount of latency, or 
delay, when propagating the frames. A transmitting device must be able to detect a collision 
with another device within the speciﬁed time after the delay introduced by the cable segments 
and repeaters is factored in. The 512 bit-time speciﬁcation also governs segment lengths. A 
more detailed explanation of the speciﬁcation can be found at www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/
doc/cisintwk/ito_doc/ethernet.htm. Figure 4-17 illustrates an example of the 5-4-3 Rule.

Figure 4-17
Repeater 5-4-3 Rule
Hubs
With the increasing density of LANs in the late 80s and early 90s, hubs were introduced to 
concentrate Thinnet and 10BaseT networks in the wiring closet. Traditional hubs operate on the 
physical layer of the OSI model and perform the same functions as basic repeaters.
Bridges
Bridges are used to connect separate segments of a network. They differ from repeaters in that 
bridges are intelligent devices that operate in the data link layer of the OSI model. Bridges 
control the collision domains on the network. Bridges also learn the MAC layer addresses of 
each node on each segment and on which interface they are located. For any incoming frame, 
bridges forward the frame only if the destination MAC address is on another port or if the bridge 
is not aware of its location. The latter is called ﬂooding. Bridges ﬁlter any incoming frames with 
destination MAC addresses that are on the same segment from where the frame arrives; they do 
not forward the frame on.
Bridges are store and forward devices. They store the entire frame and verify the CRC before 
forwarding. If a CRC error is detected, the frame is discarded. Bridges are protocol transparent; 
they are not aware of the upper-layer protocols like IP, IPX, and AppleTalk. Bridges are 
designed to ﬂood all unknown and broadcast trafﬁc.
Bridges implement the Spanning-Tree Protocol to build a loop free network topology. Bridges 
communicate with each other, exchanging information such as priority and bridge interface 
MAC addresses. They select a root bridge and then implement the Spanning-Tree Protocol. 
Some interfaces are placed in a hold state, while other bridges will have interfaces in forwarding

mode. Looking at Figure 4-18, note that there is no load sharing or dual paths with bridge 
protocols as there is in routing.
Figure 4-18
Spanning-Tree Protocol
Switches
Switches are the evolution of bridges. Switches use fast integrated circuits that reduce the 
latency that bridges introduce to the network. Switches also enable the capability to run in cut-
through mode. In cut-through mode, the switch does not wait for the entire frame to enter its 
buffer; instead, it forwards the frame after it has read the destination MAC address ﬁeld of the 
frame. Cut-through operation increases the probability that error frames are propagated on the 
network, which increases CRC and runt frames on the network. Because of these problems, 
most switches today perform store-and-forward operation with CRC check as bridges do. 
Figure 4-19 shows a switch; note that it controls collision domains but not broadcast domains.

136     Chapter 4: Network Topologies and LAN Design
Switches have characteristics similar to bridges; however, they have more ports and run 
faster. Switches keep a table of MAC addresses per port, and they implement Spanning-Tree 
Protocol. Switches also operate in the data link layer and are protocol transparent. Each port 
on a switch is a separate collision domain but part of the same broadcast domain. Switches 
do not control broadcasts on the network.
Routers
Routers make forwarding decisions based on network layer addresses. In addition to controlling 
collision domains, routers control broadcast domains. Each interface of a router is a separate 
broadcast domain deﬁned by a subnet and a mask. Routers are protocol aware, which means 
they are capable of forwarding packets of routed protocols such as IP, IPX, Decnet, and 
AppleTalk. Figure 4-20 describes a router; each interface is a broadcast and a collision domain.
Figure 4-20
 Routers Control Broadcast and Collision Domains
Routers exchange information about destination networks by using one of several routing 
protocols. The following are lists of routing protocols. The lists are divided by the protocols that 
can be routed.
For routing TCP/IP:
•
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
•
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
•
Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
•
Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (ISIS)
•

LAN Hardware     137
For routing AppleTalk:
•
Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP)
•
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
Routing protocols are discussed in further detail in Chapter 6, “Designing for Speciﬁc 
Protocols.” 
Routers are the preferred method of forwarding packets between networks of differing media, 
such as Ethernet to Token Ring, Ethernet to FDDI, or Ethernet to Serial. They also provide 
methods to ﬁlter trafﬁc based on the network layer address, route redundancy, load balancing, 
hierarchical addressing, and multicast routing.
Layer 3 Switches
LAN switches that are capable of running routing protocols are Layer 3 switches. These 
switches are capable of running routing protocols and communicating with neighboring 
routers. An example is a Catalyst 5500 with a Routing Switch Module (RSM). Layer 3 switches 
have LAN technology interfaces that perform network layer forwarding; legacy routers provide 
connectivity to WAN circuits. The switches off-load local trafﬁc from the WAN routers. 
Layer 3 switches perform the functions of both data link layer switches and network layer 
routers. Each port is a collision domain. Interfaces are grouped into broadcast domains 
(subnets) and a routing protocol is selected to provide network information to other Layer 3 
switches and routers.
Combining Hubs, Switches, and Routers
Available in Ethernet and Fast Ethernet, hubs are best used in small networks where there are 
few nodes on the segment. Hubs do not control the broadcasts nor do they ﬁlter collision 
domains on the network. If higher bandwidth is required, use 100 Mbps hubs. When the number 
of nodes on the network grows, move to switches.
With the cost of switch ports comparable to hubs, use switches as the basic network 
connectivity devices on the network. Switches reduce collisions and resolve media contention 
on the network by providing a collision domain per port. Replace hubs with switches if the 
utilization is over 40 percent on Ethernet networks or above 70 percent on Token Ring and 
FDDI networks. Switches cannot resolve broadcast characteristics of protocols; use routing to 
resolve protocol-related problems. As you can see in the sample in Figure 4-21, the repeaters 
are pushed to the outer layer of the design, connecting to switches. Switches control the 
collision domains. Fast Layer 3 switches are used for routing between LAN segments, and the 
router provides access to the WAN.

138     Chapter 4: Network Topologies and LAN Design
Figure 4-21
Combining Routers, Switches, and Hubs
Use routers for segmenting the network into separate broadcast domains, security ﬁltering, and 
access to the WAN. If broadcast trafﬁc on the network is over 20 percent, use routing.

The 3011 WAN access module for the Catalyst 3200 and Catalyst 3100 provides WAN 
interconnect integrated with the switch backplane. The 3011 WAN access module was the ﬁrst 
FlexSlot module to be introduced. Based on the Cisco 2503 router, the 3011 provides two high-
speed serial ports, an ISDN BRI port, and an auxiliary (AUX) port. 
Catalyst 3900 Token Ring Stackable Switch
The Catalyst 3920 switch provides 24 Token Ring ports. With the Catalyst 3920 switch, you 
can start with a single 24-port switch and add capacity as you need it, while still managing the 
entire stack system as one device.
Catalyst 3500 10/100 Autosensing Switch
The Catalyst 3500 XL architecture is designed to meet the technical requirements of 
autosensing 10/100BaseT Ethernet interfaces. Autosensing enables each port to self-conﬁgure 
to the correct bandwidth upon determining whether it is connected to a 10- or 100-Mbps 
Ethernet channel. This feature simpliﬁes setup and conﬁguration and provides ﬂexibility in the 
mix of 10 and 100 Mbps connections the switch supports. Network managers can alter 
connections without having to replace port interfaces.
GBIC-Based Gigabit Ethernet Ports
Each Catalyst 3500 XL comes with two or eight Gigabit Ethernet gigabit interface connector 
(GBIC) ports. Customers can use any of the following IEEE 802.3z-compliant GBICs based on 
their connection needs: 1000BaseSX, 1000BaseLX/LH, or the Cisco GigaStack stacking 
GBIC. These GBIC ports support standards-based, ﬁeld-replaceable media modules and 
provide unprecedented ﬂexibility in switch deployment while protecting customers’ 
investments.
Catalyst 4000
The Catalyst 4912G is a 12-port dedicated Gigabit Ethernet switch featuring high-performance 
Layer 2 switching and intelligent Cisco OSI network (Layer 3) services for high-speed network 
aggregation. 
The Catalyst 4003 offers 24 Gbps of switching bandwidth and provides expansion to 96 ports 
of 10/100 Ethernet or 36 ports of Gigabit Ethernet. Up to 96 10/100 Ethernet ports, or up to 36 
Gigabit Ethernet ports, can be installed into one managed unit.

142     Chapter 4: Network Topologies and LAN Design
The Catalyst 4000 series provides an advanced high-performance enterprise switching solution 
optimized for wiring closets with up to 96 users and data center server environments that 
require up to 36 Gigabit Ethernet ports. New FlexiMod uplinks support up to eight 100BaseFX 
riser connections with EtherChannel beneﬁts. The Catalyst 4000 series provides intelligent 
Layer 2 services leveraging a multiGigabit architecture for 10/100/1000-Mb Ethernet 
switching. The modular three-slot Catalyst 4003 system leverages the software code base from 
the industry-leading Catalyst 5500/5000 series to provide the rich and proven feature set that 
customers demand in the wiring closet for true end-to-end enterprise networking.
Catalyst 5000 Switch Series
The Cisco Catalyst 5000 series features modular chassis in 2-, 5-, 9-, and 13-slot versions. All 
chassis share the same set of line cards and software features, which provides scalability while 
maintaining interoperability across all chassis.
The Catalyst 5002 is positioned to deliver a consistent architecture and features set in a smaller 
package that addresses the needs of smaller wiring closets. The Catalyst 5002 switches at the 
1 Mpps (million packets per second) range. The Catalyst 5002 is a fully modular, two-slot 
Catalyst 5000 series member, using the same architecture and software as the Catalyst 5000. 
The switch can deliver more than one million packets per second throughput across a 1.2-Gbps, 
media-independent backplane that supports Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, FDDI, Token Ring, and 
ATM.
The Catalyst 5000 will continue to address the needs of switched 10BaseT and group switched 
wiring closets with performance in the 1–3 Mpps range. 
The Catalyst 5505, a ﬁve-slot chassis like the Catalyst 5000, is designed for a high-end wiring 
closet and data applications with performance in the 1–25 Mpps range. The Catalyst 5505 
combines the size of the original Catalyst 5000 with the performance boost and added features 
of the Catalyst 5500 series.
The Catalyst 5509 supports high-density 10/100 Ethernet for the wiring closet, or high-density 
Gigabit Ethernet for backbone applications, delivering over 25-Mpps switching performance. 
The Catalyst 5509 provides dedicated switching for up to 384 users, making this chassis an 
ideal platform for wiring closet solutions. The Catalyst 5509 also supports high-density Gigabit 
Ethernet for switched intranet backbones and data centers.
The Catalyst 5500 is the most versatile switch in the Catalyst family, able to support 
LightStream 1010 ATM switching or Catalyst 8500 Layer 3 switching line cards in addition to 
all the Catalyst 5000 family line cards. The Catalyst 5500 is positioned as a high-capacity 
wiring closet or data center switch, delivering over 25-Mpps switching performance.
The Catalyst 5500 is a 13-slot chassis that is rack-mountable using the rack-mount kit. All 
functional components, including power supplies, fan trays, supervisors, ATM switch 
processors (ASPs), and interface modules are accessible and hot-swappable from the network 
side of the chassis. This setup ensures ease of use in tight wiring closets.

network. Many companies are using WANs to connect the growing number of remote 
ofﬁces and to share services as they would on the local-area network (LAN). With transport 
and switching improvements, as well as bandwidth increases, WAN design has become a 
critical skill needed by design consultants.

Foundation Topics
WAN Design Considerations
The CCDA objectives covered in this section are the following:
There are different requirements when choosing a technology for a WAN than when you are 
selecting LAN technology. The cost and speed are the critical factors for designing a WAN. 
WAN connections are high in cost and usually have reoccurring monthly costs. These monthly 
costs vary depending on the speed of the WAN connection, and sometimes even depend on 
usage. These charges come mostly from carriers such as MCI, AT&T, and Bell Atlantic, and 
they can charge different rates depending on the line speed and distance needed by the 
customer. WANs have traditionally been represented as an unreliable network at lower speeds 
than LAN connections and at a much higher cost. Recently, WAN technologies have greatly 
improved to support multiple services and to increase throughput. This section is an overview 
of the different WAN technologies and covers the hardware used to implement them.
With today’s globalization of businesses, the WAN is proving to be an essential component of 
the network design. These changes in businesses include the growth of remote ofﬁces, increased 
numbers of telecommuters, and a growing business reliance on the Internet. These areas can be 
categorized into remote access networks and WAN access in the enterprise network.
Remote access solutions have characteristics such as lower speeds (less than T1), lower costs, 
and high latency due to low speeds and the fact that the connections take time to set up 
(nondedicated lines). These characteristics make this type of connection useful for remote 
ofﬁces with minimal data transfer needs, such as a remote sales ofﬁce making nightly uploads 
of the transaction data for the day. Typical remote access solutions include analog modem 
access, ISDN, digital subscriber line (DSL), and cable modems.
Unlike remote access, WAN technology is the more broad term that encompasses technology 
used to provide remote access to the telecommuter and WAN access for an entire company. 
Enterprise WAN connections can vary in speed from 56 Kbps to 2.488 Gbps. Enterprise WAN 
technology has a broad spectrum of technologies, equipment, and services that can be 
implemented, such as Frame Relay, ATM, SONET, modems, routers, switches, and Quality of 
Service (QoS), all of which are covered in this chapter.
WAN technology goals are dependent on bandwidth considerations, Quality of Service, 
network topology, scalability, affordability, performance, and availability.

Steps for Designing the WAN
The following is a list of the steps a CCDA needs to take to complete a successful WAN design:
1 List the requirements for the WAN design.
2 Select a WAN technology.
3 Select the WAN hardware.
4 Provision the WAN.
The remainder of this chapter covers these steps.
Listing the Requirements for the WAN Design
The CCDA objectives covered in this section are the following:
WAN designs should meet the following criteria:
•
Reliable service
•
Minimize the cost of bandwidth
•
Optimize the efﬁciency of bandwidth
The remainder of this section covers these criteria.
Reliable Service
Reliable service can be achieved through redundancy. This section covers three basic WAN 
design topologies that describe the interconnection between the routers that provide 
redundancy:
•
Star topology
•
Fully meshed topology
•
Partially meshed topology
14
Draw a topology map that meets the customer’s needs and includes a 
high-level view of internetworking devices and interconnecting media.
17
Update the network topology drawing you created in the previous section 
to include hardware and media.
18
Recognize scalability constraints and issues for standard WAN 
technologies.
20
Recommend Cisco products and WAN technologies that will meet the 
customer’s requirements for performance, capacity, and scalability in an 
enterprise network.

Listing the Requirements for the WAN Design     159
Star Topology
Figure 5-1 illustrates a star topology (also known as a hub and spoke topology), which is a 
common design for packet-switched networks such as Frame Relay. However, this design has 
a single point of failure, which is the core router. The core router also acts as a bottleneck and 
must be able to scale to the needs of the remote ofﬁces.
Figure 5-1
Star Topology
Fully Meshed Topology
Figure 5-2 illustrates a fully meshed design, which has the most redundancy. However, this 
design has a few problems. As the internetwork grows, each router that is added will add to the 
overall trafﬁc of the existing routers. This is especially true if the trafﬁc has a lot of broadcasts. 
Also, each router needs to support the performance level needed in this design, which means

that the routers need to be comparable. This design is costly both in equipment and in cost for 
the WAN connections.
Figure 5-2
Fully Meshed Topology
Partially Meshed Topology
Figure 5-3 illustrates a partially meshed topology that would be used in a Frame Relay network. 
This is often called redundant star conﬁguration. It provides a fair amount of redundancy with 
a limited amount of meshing and without the negatives associated with fully meshed topologies.
Minimizing the Cost of Bandwidth
The cost of bandwidth can be minimized by choosing the proper WAN technology, such as 
ISDN. The customer only pays for the use of ISDN. If the service is not used, the customer does 
not have to pay for access. Analog modem and Frame Relay connections have similar features, 
but often the customer has to pay an additional monthly fee for having access to the network. 
In the case of Frame Relay, the customer needs to pay a reoccurring fee for T1 or partial T1 
access to the carrier’s Frame Relay network.
Optimizing the Efﬁciency of Bandwidth
Multiplexing or combining multiple services over the same bandwidth is a method of 
improving the efﬁciency of the bandwidth. Voice technology is a perfect example of using 
bandwidth more effectively. Now a point-to-point T1 between two ofﬁces can carry not only 
data, but also voice packets as well, using new hardware and compression technology. However, 
a critical component of this type of sharing of bandwidth is using Quality of Service techniques.

Listing the Requirements for the WAN Design     161
Figure 5-3
Partially Meshed Topology
Quality of Service
QoS is a method of measuring and maintaining a level of service needed to support technologies 
such as voice and video. This is an important concept because technologies such as voice and 
video are sensitive to bandwidth congestion and errors. For example, voice data arriving in the 
wrong order would make conversations very difﬁcult.

bandwidth for Internet access can be up to 27 Mbps; however, actual 
bandwidth would depend on how populated the cable line is.
An excellent reference on cable modems can be found at http://
www.cable-modems.org/tutorial/.

Selecting a WAN Technology     163
A key design consideration for WAN implementations is cost. The costs associated with WAN 
connections can vary depending on the implementation. The cost associated with establishing 
a WAN connection can have multiple variables. For example, in the chart above, Frame Relay 
is described as a technology where the customer pays for the access on a usage basis. The cost 
of usage is charged in addition to the cost for access to the Frame Relay network. An example 
of this type of charge is a monthly phone bill. Every month you pay a ﬂat access fee for having 
the phone service, and in addition, you are charged for certain speciﬁc phone calls. These 
factors contribute to the high cost of WAN access.
Leased line

Applications

164     Chapter 5: WAN Design
There are four basic methods to manage costs for WAN connections. The ﬁrst is negotiating 
with carriers to ﬁnd inexpensive and competitive pricing for bandwidth. The increase in 
competition within the carrier market has made shopping for inexpensive bandwidth even 
easier. The second method to manage costs is optimizing WAN lines by controlling trafﬁc and 
by optimizing the WAN design to best use the bandwidth. The third method to manage costs is 
the integration of multiple services across the same bandwidth, such as voice, data, and video. 
The ﬁnal method incorporates quality of service issues.
Frame Relay
One of the most popular WAN technologies is Frame Relay. Technology improvements and 
support for Frame Relay has made this WAN technology as prevalent as ATM and its use is 
growing. Frame Relay is being used to connect remote ofﬁces to extend the LAN and replace 
dial-up connections. Because Frame Relay is cost-effective and because you pay for your usage 
of the bandwidth, people use the Frame Relay network to deliver services such as the Internet 
to remote ofﬁces.
Figure 5-4 shows an example of a network that uses a Frame Relay WAN for connection to 
remote ofﬁces. Note that the Frame Relay network is portrayed as a cloud. The cloud is used to 
illustrate a network that does not use the same path between two end points. That means that 
the packets between the remote ofﬁces and the corporate network will most likely take different 
paths within the Frame Relay network.
Frame Relay is a common WAN solution for small to medium businesses because of its lower 
costs and scalability. Frame Relay uses a method called packet switching to transport data and 
operates on Layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model. Packet switching takes data and formats it into 
small chunks, called packets or frames, which allows you to transport different data packets 
over the same physical data path. A main difference between X.25 technology and Frame Relay 
is latency and overhead. X.25 technology assumes that the physical line is unreliable and 
therefore X.25 uses error checking, whereas Frame Relay does not, thereby achieving greater 
speeds with minimal latency.
More information on Frame Relay can be found in the section “Provisioning a Frame Relay 
Network” later in this chapter.

Leased lines, also known as point-to-point links, are permanent connections established 
between two customer end points through a carrier’s WAN. Usually these types of links are for 
private use by the customer for the duration of their lease or contract.
Circuit switching is a technology used by ISDN. This is where the carrier establishes a physical 
circuit for the length of the session. This type of technology is similar to establishing a phone 
call.
Packet switching, used by ATM, Frame Relay, Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS), 
and X.25, can share a single physical connection through the carrier network. In these types of 
networks, broadcast trafﬁc can greatly affect the network’s performance. However, a 
technology such as X.25 and SMDS that does not support broadcasting is called a nonbroadcast 
multi-access (NBMA) network. Networks such as Frame Relay and ATM that do support 
broadcast are called multi-access networks.
Beyond meshing topologies, there are two other WAN conﬁguration or connection types that 
need to be discussed. The ﬁrst is a point-to-point connection. This is a description of a type of 
logical connection. There is a distinction between the point-to-point WAN technology and the 
point-to-point connection. A Frame Relay network can have one core router that only allows 
communication between the core and the remote ofﬁces. This means that the remote ofﬁces 
could not talk directly to each other, so logically the Frame Relay network is operating as 
multiple point-to-point connections. This type of connection is very common in T1 WAN 
conﬁgurations where one end system is connected to another. This connection is also seen in 
Frame Relay and ATM.
The other type of connection, which is often used in packet-switched networks, is the point-to-
multipoint type of connection. This is similar to the star topology conﬁguration, where one core 
or root device is connected to multiple end devices or leaves. These types of connections, as 
well as the meshing topologies, pose problems in routing because of loops.
Using the split-horizon update prevents a common problem with routing loops. Split horizon is 
a method of preventing a router from sending routing information out to the same interface from 
which it received the update. However, in the case of point-to-multipoint topologies, also 
known as hub-and-spoke topologies, where one central point handles all the trafﬁc, how is this 
problem resolved? This problem is addressed in Frame Relay by using subinterfaces. That 
means that one physical interface has multiple virtual interfaces. Routing information from one 
virtual interface is sent out another virtual interface, thereby avoiding the split horizon problem.
After reviewing the WAN technology you want to implement, the next step is to select the right 
hardware.

Cisco has anticipated the need for their hardware to have the ability for rapid changes to keep 
up with changes in technology and the changing needs of their customers. They have addressed 
the issues in Table 5-2—cost, ﬂexibility, redundancy, and scalability—by modularizing their 
hardware. By creating separate components, or modules, such as IOS, VIP cards, and WAN 
interface cards, Cisco has devised a great way to keep up with changing needs. Now for a router 
to expand in functionality does not require that the entire router be replaced. The scalability 
issue can be addressed by changing the IOS and a module, for example. Table 5-3 is an 
overview of the most common of the router features and components.

170     Chapter 5: WAN Design
Switching Modes
A router’s ability to process packets plays a key role in the design. Once a router examines the 
Layer 3 information in a packet, it must switch the packet to the proper outbound interface for 
delivery. Cisco routers use different switching methods, outlined in the paragraphs below.
Process Switching
Process switching occurs when the packet’s destination causes the router to look up the path in 
the routing table. This means that the packet is processed in main memory. Process switching 
will occur if a router has an access list, because it requires that each packet be reviewed and 
compared to the access list before being forwarded. Using encryption and compression also 
requires the use of process switching.
Fast Switching
In fast switching, incoming packets are passed based on previously cached route information 
derived from previous packets. These caches are stored in main memory.
With this type of switching, packets are passed to the outbound interface based on previous 
information. So all packets that need to go to the same location use the same switching path. 
Fast switching uses asynchronous interrupts, which are handled in real time. Using the route 
cache is more efﬁcient than the routing table, so fast switching is faster than process switching. 
Fast switching can drastically reduce CPU utilization on routers. The ﬁrst packet is always 
process switched if not already in the fast cache. Once the cache is populated, future packets 
are fast switched.
Silicon Switching
Silicon switching passes packets on 7000 series routers only, using information in the silicon 
switching engine (SSE) of the Silicon Switch Processor (SSP) module. The switching speed 
comes from the fact that the SSP module will make the forwarding decision without 
interrupting the CPU.
Optimum Switching
You will ﬁnd optimum switching functionality is available only on the Route Switch Processor 
(RSP). Because of enhancements to the caching capability, optimum switching is almost twice 
as fast as silicon switching.

Selecting the WAN Hardware     171
NetFlow Switching
NetFlow switching creates trafﬁc ﬂows using process switching, after which it will review the 
following packets for the same source, destination, encryption, and so on, and will pass them 
to the same destination port. When a packet meets the same criteria, it is considered part of the 
same ﬂow and is passed.
NetFlow has a ﬂow cache that makes it possible to process access lists faster than process 
switching. NetFlow also supports detailed trafﬁc reporting that can be used for network 
management, planning, and departmental chargebacks.
Choosing a Router Platform
You need to provide your client with the right router platform, based on your customer’s 
requirements. Remember to refer back to the Table 5-2 for selecting the right hardware. You will 
notice that there are many variables that can affect your choice of router platform.
For example, the section “Provisioning a Frame Relay Network” later in this chapter covers 
provisioning a Frame Relay network and its equipment. The equipment choice depends directly 
on various factors that are part of the implementation of Frame Relay.
The problem of selecting a router in this situation is no different from the process of extracting 
the customer’s requirements for the new network. Identify existing equipment, deﬁne the 
requirements for the new network and apply them to features needed on the new equipment 
(performance, capacity, and scalability), and use tools to identify recommended equipment. 
This is a simpliﬁcation of the process, but as you will see in the section for provisioning a Frame 
Relay network, the murkiness of choosing the equipment becomes clear when details of the 
implementation are available.
The router’s ability to process packets quickly and efﬁciently will affect the router’s overall 
performance. Previously, many designers were concerned about the speed at which packets 
were passed through the router. The following guide is a tool you can use to improve router 
performance.
Merike Kaeo from the Enterprise Technical Marketing group at Cisco wrote a short guide that 
provides information on router performance, called the “Router Performance Design and 
Implementation Guide.” This guide is a strong overview on router performance and includes 
many design tips, such as recognizing design ﬂaws. This guide is included as the following 
section. It has been edited here for formatting.
Router Performance Design and Implementation Guide
This Router Performance Design and Implementation Guide was originally written by Merike 
Kaeo from the Enterprise Technical Marketing group at Cisco. It has been edited here for 
formatting.

172     Chapter 5: WAN Design
With the proliferation of Cisco router products in the past few years and the ever-increasing 
features and functionality available, understanding some of the intricate interworkings of these 
devices is necessary to design optimal performance networks. In the early days of routers, raw 
packet-per-second performance was a valid concern, but with the increased improvements in 
processor power and memory management, the increasing performance numbers are reaching 
a point where perception and reality are becoming blurred. This paper focuses primarily on the 
realities of real network performance considerations and how the varying router platforms that 
Cisco provides can meet the appropriate criteria for any given network.
The network performance considerations will not address issues regarding latency of routers 
because, in a network system as a whole, latency per switch or router has been found to be 
negligible when compared to normal workstation or PC disk access speeds and lower-speed 
media bandwidth considerations.
It is important to note that raw performance numbers in packets per second should never 
be the sole criterion for choosing any product because criteria based on support responsiveness, 
company ﬁnancials, feature enhancements, software reliability, troubleshooting capability, and 
a variety of other criteria factor heavily into a ﬁnal product decision. Performance of the varying 
platforms should be understood to determine what meets the user’s requirement, allowing for 
future growth and expansion of a user’s network.
A description of how to determine what a user’s performance requirements may be follows, 
including some sample calculations that can then be used as a guideline and extrapolated to ﬁt 
into speciﬁc network designs. The trafﬁc patterns and network applications may not be well 
understood in new network designs, but it is important for some investigation to be done to 
determine approximate trafﬁc patterns and worst-case scenarios (not to be misconstrued as 
theoretical worst-case scenarios). Next, the switching paths of varying Cisco router platforms 
are listed and platform aggregate numbers are speciﬁed to help determine the most optimal 
platform in a given network design scenario. The last section of the paper lists some common 
features that may affect switching paths and gives general guidelines for optimum network 
designs.
Realities of Network Performance Criteria
The bottom line of any given network is that it becomes a medium whereby users (the people 
relying on the network to do their work) accomplish their jobs without incurring any noticeable 
delays. Performance criteria are met when every user is satisﬁed in terms of network 
responsiveness. To ensure user satisfaction, every aspect of the network must be examined, 
from the media to the applications to the individual devices creating the network as a whole. 
This task is complex.

Selecting the WAN Hardware     173
Differentiating Performance Tests Versus Real Network Performance
Three areas require classiﬁcation:
•
What comprises a performance test?
•
How does one interpret results?
•
How does one compare the results to any realistic performance requirements?
The more common performance tests include blasting trafﬁc from an input port to an output 
port of a device. For a given device, injecting trafﬁc through multiple input ports to multiple 
output ports on the same device gives aggregate performance numbers. Usually, these tests are 
performed on Ethernet because Ethernet-based testers were the ﬁrst available. Aggregate 
performance numbers are media-independent, but the type of media used plays an important 
role in deﬁning what the theoretical packet-per-second limitation is. Table 5-4 shows 
characteristics of some of the more common media in use today. 
Calculating the theoretical maximum packets per second involves all the variables listed in 
Table 5-4: interframe gap, bandwidth, and frame size. The formula to compute this number is:
Bandwidth/Packet Size = Theoretical Maximum Packets per Second (where packet size 
may incorporate interframe gap in bits)
Table 5-5 lists the theoretical packet-per-second limitations for three common media—10 Mbps 
Ethernet, 16 Mbps Token Ring, and FDDI—each for eight different Ethernet frame sizes. These

eight frame sizes, widely used in the industry, are derived from the performance testing 
methodology as outlined in the Internet standard for device benchmarking in RFC 1944. The 
numbers are derived by using the above formula.
NOTE
RFC 1944 has recently been made obsolete by RFC 2544. 
More speciﬁc detail in how the numbers in Table 5-5 were derived for the three media (10 Mbps

the theoretical minima are hard to pin down, but by using only the frame format itself the

header bits for the correct calculation of the data portion. So, for a 64-byte Ethernet frame, we 
get 64 – 18 = 46 bytes of data for the Data portion of the Token Ring frame shown in Figure 5-6.

Frame and Packet Size    The packet size is a major factor in determining the maximum 
packets per second, and, in the theoretical test world, one packet size at a time is tested. Eight 
standard packet sizes are tested: 64-, 128-, 256-, 512-, 768-, 1024-, 1280-, and 1518-byte 
packets. Figure 5-8 shows a graph of the theoretical maximum packets per second for 10 Mbps 
Ethernet.
It is important to note that as the frame size increases, the maximum theoretical packets per 
second decrease.

178     Chapter 5: WAN Design
Figure 5-8
10 Mbps Ethernet Theoretical Performance
Having seen how maximum theoretical performance is determined, we now see how that data 
ﬁts in with the performance requirements of real user networks. Each medium has a speciﬁc 
ﬁxed-size bandwidth pipe associated with it, and each one may or may not deﬁne a minimum 
and maximum valid frame size. The minimum and maximum frame sizes are important because 
most good applications written for workstations or PCs make efﬁcient use of bandwidth 
available and use maximum-sized frames. The smaller the frame size, the higher the percentage 
of overhead relative to user data; in other words, smaller frame sizes mean less effective 
bandwidth utilization as illustrated in Figure 5-9.

Figure 5-9
Bandwidth Efﬁciency for Small Versus Large Frames
An understanding of real trafﬁc patterns is important when designing networks. At least some 
typical applications should be known so that the average packet sizes on the network can be 
determined. Sniffer traces to look at typical packet sizes for varying applications are helpful; 
some of the more common ones include:
•
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) (World Wide Web)—400 to 1518 
bytes
•
Network File System (NFS)—64 to 1518 bytes
•
Telnet—64 to 1518 bytes
•
NetWare—500 to 1518 bytes
•
Multimedia—400 to 700 bytes
For optimal network designs, an understanding of the kinds of applications that will be used is 
necessary to determine the typical packet sizes that will be traversing your network. The 
following example, taken from a real network, shows how to optimize your network design.
Example
Consider a very simple network, depicted in Figure 5-10.

 Sample Network
The network consists of six Ethernet networks that are interconnected via an FDDI backbone. 
Router A interconnects the Ethernet networks to the FDDI backbone. For simplicity, we assume 
that all the Ethernets have trafﬁc characteristics similar to those shown in Figure 5-11.
Figure 5-11
Graph of Typical Ethernet Network
Most of the trafﬁc falls between 256-byte and 1280-byte packets, with numerous 64-byte 
packets that are typically acknowledgment packets. Our calculations assume that the Ethernet 
network is fairly busy with average utilization at 40 percent; in other words, 4 Mbps of Ethernet

bandwidth is utilized. For average trafﬁc rates, 40 percent utilization of Ethernet bandwidth is 
a rather heavily utilized network because collisions are very probable and most of the trafﬁc on 
the network is retransmission trafﬁc. However, the example is intended to show a worst-case, 
real-world performance scenario.
For simplicity, we assume that the following trafﬁc is on the Ethernet:
•
768-byte packets, 35%
•
1280-byte packets, 20%
•
512-byte packets, 15%
•
64-byte packets, 30%
To calculate the total packets per second that would be on the Ethernet, we need to apply the 
following formula for each of the different packet sizes: (Bandwidth × Percent Media Used)/
(Packet Size × bits/byte) = Packets per Second.
Using this formula yields:
•
(4 Mbps × 35%)/(768 bytes × 8 bits/byte) = 228 pps
•
(4 Mbps × 20%)/(1280 bytes × 8 bits/byte) = 79 pps
•
(4 Mbps × 15%)/(512 bytes × 8 bits/byte) = 147 pps
•
(4 Mbps × 30%)/(64 bytes × 8 bits/byte) = 2344 pps
The total, 2798 pps, is not the pps rate that goes through the router. If it is, the network design 
is not optimal and should be changed. Rather, the 80/20 rule applies to most nonswitched 
networks, where 80 percent of the trafﬁc stays on the local network and 20 percent goes to a 
different destination. Then we have 2798 × 20% = 560 pps that the router must deal with from 
that single Ethernet network. If we take six Ethernets with similar characteristics, we get an 
aggregate of 3360 pps that the router must support.
Now consider a scenario with central servers and assume that the 80/20 rule does not apply; 
only 10 percent of the trafﬁc stays local and 90 percent goes through the router to the servers 
that are off the backbone. In this scenario, the router must support 6 × (2798 × 90%) = 15,110 
pps for our example of six Ethernets. The appropriate router platform must be chosen that will 
meet the trafﬁc requirements.
This example shows how the packets-per-second requirement for varying networks is 
computed. As will be shown in subsequent sections, all Cisco router platforms meet and greatly 
exceed the pure packets-per-second requirements of real networks.
Router Platform Switching Paths
This section will list the switching paths that the various router platforms support.

182     Chapter 5: WAN Design
Low-End/Midrange Routers
This category of routers includes the Cisco 2500, 4000, 4500, and 4700 series routers. The 
switching paths supported for these routers are process switching and fast switching. Fast 
switching is on by default for all protocols.
The aggregate performance numbers in packets per second are listed in Table 5-6.
Features Affecting Performance
Understanding how a given feature will affect the router’s switching paths is critical when designing 
networks. Many new features are initially incorporated into the process switching path and, in 
subsequent releases, incorporated into faster switching paths. The most current enhancements are 
listed in Cisco Connection Online (CCO) under Technical Assistance/Tech Tips: Hot Tips/IOS 
Information. There you will ﬁnd new features for Cisco Internetwork Operating System (Cisco 
IOS™) releases and any performance enhancements to previously implemented features.
Low-End and Midrange Router Memory Considerations
Most performance concerns arise from the need for sufﬁcient memory to run in certain 
environments and the necessity to prevent overstrain on the CPU. The memory considerations 
are primarily issues for the low-end and midrange platforms. Product Bulletins #284 and #290 
address these issues for the Cisco 4000 and 2500 series routers, respectively. They can be 
accessed via the Web as follows:

Selecting the WAN Hardware     183
No boilerplate mechanism that gives hard-and-fast platform limitations exists. What needs to be 
considered is that for any given platform, the number of interfaces you can support depends 
greatly on the encapsulations and features used. The aggregate maximum packets per second is a 
useful number for approximating the maximum number of interfaces to put into a given platform, 
as long as some real-world analysis of the trafﬁc ﬂow is done. If designs follow a more theoretical 
maximum packets-per-second approach, the Cisco routers will be greatly underutilized.
Some common rules to follow include:
•
Because access lists are checked sequentially, always optimize your access lists so that 
most trafﬁc meets the criteria of the ﬁrst entries of the list. If a customer has extensive 
access lists and this problem is the major performance bottleneck, it may be time to look 
at a higher performance router.
•
Custom, priority, and weighted-fair-queuing activate only when the serial line is congested. 
As of Release 11.1 they are fast-switched; as long as the serial line is not congested, the 
fastest switching path that the interface supports and is conﬁgured for will be used.
•
For low-end and midrange router platforms, compression should be performed for serial 
lines running at 128 kbps or lower. At higher line rates, compression may tax the CPU.
•
Encryption is very CPU- and memory-intensive, so careful consideration of appropriate 
platforms is necessary.
Network Design Guidelines
Some common network designs are suboptimal in terms of performance; most of these are 
based on media mismatch as illustrated in Figure 5-12.
This scenario shows two separate cases of common media mismatch problems. The ﬁrst 
problem is between Router B and Router C where multiple clients are trying to access a 
centralized server farm. What may not be obvious at ﬁrst glance is that the 56-Kbps line is the 
primary connection between the clients and the servers, and it will quickly become 
oversubscribed with trafﬁc. At the very least, enough bandwidth to support the maximum 
expected peak trafﬁc between the clients and servers should be in place. Or, if certain Ethernet 
segments make extensive use of a particular server, distributing servers to local Ethernet 
segments will greatly improve network performance.
The second performance problem is through Router A, where the server farm gets backed up to 
a network of backup servers. The media mismatch from 100 Mbps FDDI to 10 Mbps Ethernet 
is the bottleneck. To gain optimal performance for high-speed backups going through the router, 
the media speeds should be maximized.

Provisioning the WAN
The CCDA objective covered in this section is the following:
Provisioning for WAN services means preparing to receive WAN services. The act of planning 
for WAN services is an essential component not only for this exam but for your internetwork 
design as well. This section covers line speeds, which is basic information needed for planning 
your WAN access. This section also includes an example of the steps needed to provision a 
common WAN service. Frame Relay has grown in popularity over the past ﬁve years and is 
essential WAN technology for a CCDA candidate to understand. Therefore, Frame Relay is 
used here as an example for provisioning a WAN network.
First, you must understand the different WAN speeds and the terminology surrounding them. 
WAN bandwidth is often provisioned in the United States using the North American digital 
hierarchy. The term DS, or digital signal, is based on the transmission rate of 64 Kbps, also 
known as DS0. This is the transmission rate usually associated with voice transmission. The T 
system used in the US and the E system used in Europe and Japan are multiples of the DS0, as 
seen in Table 5-7. The bit rate in Table 5-7 also includes circuit overhead, such as the 8K for

channelizing a T1. This is what accounts for the slight variation on the total bit rate. This 
overhead would need to be added to the total number of DSO multiplied by 64K.
The T1/T3 format is used primarily in North America and parts of Asia. The E1/E3 format is 
used in most of the rest of the world. The J1 format is used primarily in Japan.
After choosing a signaling standard, or speed, the next step is to review the components of the 
WAN technology you want to implement. Different WAN technologies require very different 
components and steps for the implementation. The following example shows how to plan for 
the provisioning of a Frame Relay connection. For the exam, understand each step needed for 
provisioning the Frame Relay network, and pay speciﬁc attention to the terminology used.
Provisioning a Frame Relay Network
This section includes details on how to provision a Frame Relay network as well as trafﬁc 
shaping over the Frame Relay network. Note that provisioning means that you are prepared to 
request a Frame Relay service. These are not the steps needed to create a Frame Relay network. 
The actual network is provided by the carrier and is usually represented in a network diagram 
in the form of a cloud. The cloud contains the Frame Relay network, and the following steps 
outline information you need when provisioning for a Frame Relay network. More technical 
details on how to implement Frame Relay networks can be found in the section “Frame Relay” 
earlier in this chapter. Another excellent resource for more information on Frame Relay is a 
document called “Frame Relay” from Cisco Press that can be found at http://www.cisco.com/
cpress/cc/td/cpress/fund/ith2nd/it2410.htm. There is also a Frame Relay Forum that has up-
to-date information on Frame Relay networks and technology that is located at http://
www.frforum.com/.
Provisioning a Frame Relay network involves the following steps:
1 Choose a committed information rate (CIR) based on realistic, anticipated trafﬁc rates.
2 Aggregate all CIRs to determine core bandwidth requirements.
3 Determine the link speed and number of interfaces required on the core router.
4 Choose a router platform that can handle the job.

186     Chapter 5: WAN Design
Step 1: Choose a CIR Based on Realistic, Anticipated Trafﬁc Rates
A CIR is a connection’s minimum bandwidth (information rate) and is speciﬁed in kilobits per 
second. Bandwidth in a provider’s Frame Relay network is shared amng its customers. 
Ordering Frame Relay service with a Committed Information Rate allows the router to transmit 
at speeds upto the speed of the CIR without the packets being discarded in the event of 
congestion in the Frame Relay network. Choosing a CIR means that you need to determine 
what is the lowest guaranteed transmission rate needed to support your services. This step 
requires that you identify the WAN trafﬁc that needs to be transferred through the Frame Relay 
network. The tools you use in Chapter 2, “Assessing the Existing Network and Identifying 
Customer Objectives,” should help you to categorize and identify the trafﬁc load that you 
should anticipate on your Frame Relay network. File transfers and broadcast trafﬁc are some of 
the criteria that need to be determinedfor the trafﬁc load.
Keep in mind that for nondata trafﬁc, such as voice and video, you will need additional 
considerations, such as QoS. Cisco IOS Release 11.2 and later versions support a featured 
called trafﬁc shaping, which is discussed later in this section.
Some Frame Relay providers claim their network has more available bandwidth than has been 
sold and offer a zero CIR. While a zero CIR can cut monthly reoccurring costs, all packets 
transmitted by the router are discard eligible. If you decide to get a zero CIR, try to get a service 
level agreement from your provider that will assure that you receive the bandwidth that you 
requested. Service level agreements (SLAs) are a set of metrics that are contracted with your 
carrier or Frame Relay provider. This is also a good audit trail to determine whether the 
provisioned network rates are obtained.
Step 2: Aggregate All CIRs to Determine Core Bandwidth Requirements
Add up all the CIRs used at each site, and if the access site has a zero CIR, use half of the link 
speed as the estimated speed. This information is needed to help determine the load on the core 
router. Frame Relay supports multiple virtual connections using the same physical devices, so 
it is important to know the total bandwidth needed by your services to determine which physical 
device can support your needs.
Step 3: Determine the Link Speed and Number of Interfaces Required on the Core Router
Determine the number of data-link connection identiﬁers (DLCIs) each interface will need. The 
DLCI identiﬁes a logical connection between two data terminal equipment (DTE) devices; it 
basically identiﬁes the virtual circuit within the Frame Relay network. Remember to decrease 
the number of DLCIs per interface if there are multiple protocols, because using too many 
DLCIs will adversely affect the router’s performance. The following are examples of factors 
that would affect the number of DLCIs on an interface when using multiple protocols:
•
Using multiple routed protocols could result in an increase in broadcasts, which would 
decrease the number of DLCIs per interface.

Provisioning the WAN     187
•
Size of routing protocols and updates means that for a large internetwork, these updates 
can be substantial, therefore, fewer DLCIs per interface should be implemented.
These examples cite routing protocols and their trafﬁc for decreasing the amount of DLCIs per 
interface. However, the use of static routes would decrease the broadcast trafﬁc and would 
support more DLCIs per interface.
Step 4: Choose a Router Platform That Can Handle the Job
Cisco recommends no more than 30–50 maximum DLCIs per interface that need to support 
broadcast trafﬁc. This number does not deﬁne the type of router you would use in your 
implementation. The router type also plays a role in how many DLCIs can be supported on an 
interface. If the router’s performance will degrade due to processing overhead, your decision 
for the router will need to depend on the processor, memory, and interface requirements.
For example, if you have 10 access sites, each provisioned with 64 Kbps CIR, you will need a 
total of 640 Kbps bandwidth. You could use one serial interface to support T1/E1 and support 
all ten DLCIs on that one interface. Almost all routers starting with 1600 support T1/E1 ports. 
However, you have to consider the type of trafﬁc on those DLCIs. If seven out of ten DLCIs 
have a considerable amount of broadcasts, using a higher end router, such as a 3600 router, will 
have greater performance.
Trafﬁc Shaping over Frame Relay
Cisco IOS Release 11.2 and later supports a feature called Frame Relay trafﬁc shaping. You 
were brieﬂy introduced to trafﬁc shaping in the section that discusses the need for QoS for 
nondata services, such as voice and video. With trafﬁc shaping you can virtually eliminate 
bottlenecks in the Frame Relay network, using these additional features:
•
Rate enforcement on a per virtual circuit basis—Controls the loss of packets 
for the remote locations because the rate for outbound packets can be conﬁgured. This is 
especially helpful when the sending location has a higher bandwidth than a remote 
location.
•
Dynamic trafﬁc throttling on a per virtual circuit basis—This feature uses 
the backward explicit congestion notiﬁcation (BECN) packets that indicate when there is 
congestion on the network. It then dynamically controls the outbound trafﬁc rate until the 
congestion is relieved.
•
Enhanced queuing support on a per virtual circuit basis—This feature uses 
either customer or priority queuing to guarantee bandwidth for speciﬁc trafﬁc, such as 
video.

1 Characterize the trafﬁc between the remote ofﬁces and MediBill.
Internet trafﬁc, email trafﬁc, and database transfer trafﬁc.
2 What type of router would you recommend for Internet access to MediBill?
An access router such as a 2500 or a 2600 would be ideal because there 
is a line speed of T1. A 2600 would be necessary over a 2500 if the client 
needed a CSU/DSU. The 2500 access routers do not support one.
3 If the Internet access router were to be upgraded to support two T1s using Border Gateway 
Protocol (BGP), what would be the best choice?
For line speeds higher than T1, you would need multiple serial 
interfaces. However, the key in choosing the router would be the need 
for the router to have enough processing power to support BGP 
convergence and route calculations and the additional memory to 
support the BGP routing tables. Therefore, a Cisco 3640 router would 
be recommended.
4 What type of router would you recommend for the hospital?
The hospital would also need an access router such as a 2500 or a 2600. 
The hospital currently has a T1 connection to MediBill but might need 
a redundant connection. Both routers will adequately serve the needs 
for the hospital; however, the 2600 is a better choice. The 2600 is a good 
choice for the T1 because the WAN interface card modules can support 
an integrated CSU/DSU component for the T1 access. Also, the WAN 
interface card module for the 2600 could support a backup ISDN or 
even a second T1, if necessary.
5 What type of WAN topology is the hospital’s connection to MediBill?
This is logically a point-to-point connection because there are two end 
points connected together. It is a point-to-point leased line because the 
T1 provides a connection between two end points through the carrier’s 
T1.
6 If Mr. Lee wanted to implement Frame Relay connections to the six remote ofﬁces with 
the current bandwidth, what would be the CIR for each ofﬁce?

The existing ofﬁces use a 56-Kbps dial-up service, so the CIR would be 
56 Kbps per ofﬁce. The CIR is the guaranteed throughput rate for each 
connection.
7 Mr. Lee has determined that MediBill will need a CIR of 1.544 Mbps. If all the remote 
ofﬁces need to communicate with MediBill corporate ofﬁces, would Mr. Lee’s calculation 
cause a bottleneck?
No. Mr. Lee’s calculation should be based on adding all the CIRs for 
the remote ofﬁces. There are six remote ofﬁces, which means that the 
total of the CIRs is 336 Kbps. That is more than enough for MediBill 
to support the other ofﬁces and their need for greater CIRs to support 
their new Internet services.

Foundation Topics
Device Naming Schemes
The following CCDA objective is covered in this section:
Having the right naming scheme can help the network staff know which device they are using 
without having to rely on a printed spreadsheet or other outside reference.
Naming schemes can be functional or geographical, or they can just follow a random scheme, 
such as a movie or mythological scheme.
For very small networks, you could use a naming system such as Sneezy, Sleepy, and so on, but 
these names do not provide an understanding of the function of these devices. As a better 
solution, you could name servers based on their function or the group they serve, such as 
Admin01, Netman01, Finance01, IM01, and so on. End stations can also be given names. 
Routers can be named by site locations—Houston, Austin, and SanAntonio, for example—in 
small networks. Most campus sites can use building numbers for router names, such as bldg-
1001, bldg-2000, and so on. However, these schemes will not scale for larger networks that 
might span the globe, as some city building names may not be unique. 
For larger networks, you may want to use a country-city-site-number scheme. The name US-
tampa-mfg-001 gives good information about the router that is being conﬁgured. For country 
code, you might want to use the ISO 3166 county code standard. Including the router model 
within the name can also help identify router types. You could use the unique global airport 
codes to identify the city in which the router is located.
IP Addressing
The following CCDA objectives are covered in this section:
The most important requirement that the network designer has in scaling a network is to assign 
addresses in a manner that can be scaled. Routing protocols cannot summarize networks if the 
networks are not assigned in contiguous blocks per region. This section covers IP address types, 
variable-length subnet masking (VLSM), and IP address assignment.
23
Propose a naming scheme for servers, routers, and user stations.
21
Propose an addressing model for the customer’s areas, networks, 
subnetworks, and end stations that meets scalability requirements.

Propose a plan for conﬁguring addresses.

An IP address is a unique 32-bit logical number assigned to a network device. IP addresses are 
network-layer (Layer 3) addresses and are represented in dotted decimal format. With the 
exclusion of address ranges documented in RFC 1918 for private use, all addresses on the 
Internet must be unique. Each 8 bits are represented with a decimal format. In Figure 6-1,
 the binary IP addresses is represented in dotted decimal format as 161.8.73.84.
Figure 6-1
Binary IP Address and Dotted Decimal Format
Five classes of IP addresses exist. The most signiﬁcant bits of the ﬁrst octet determine the class. 
Those addresses with a 0 in the most signiﬁcant bit are Class A addresses. These are addresses 
from 00000000 (0) to 01111111 (127) in the ﬁrst octet. The network numbers assigned to 
companies are 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0, with networks 0 and 127 being reserved. For example, 
127.0.0.1 is reserved for localhost. The ﬁrst octet in a Class A address is the network number, 
and the remaining three octets are the host portion of the address, by default.
Class B addresses use 10 as the 2 most signiﬁcant bits of the ﬁrst octet. These are addresses 
from 10000000 (128) to 10111111 (191). The networks are 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0. By 
default, the ﬁrst two octets of a Class B address are the network portion of the address. The 
remaining two octets are the host portion.
Class C address use 110 as the 3 most signiﬁcant bits of the ﬁrst octet. These are address from 
11000000 (192) to 11011111 (223). The networks are 192.0.1.0 to 223.255.255.0. By default, 
the ﬁrst three octets of a Class C address are the network portion of the address. The remaining 
octet is the host portion.
Class D addresses use 1110 as the 4 most signiﬁcant bits of the ﬁrst octet. These are address 
from 11100000 (224) to 11101111 (239). The network addresses are from 224.0.0.1 to 
239.255.255.255. These addresses are used for multicast addresses and do not have a network 
or host part.
Class E addresses use 11110 as the most signiﬁcant bits of the ﬁrst octet. These are address from 
11110001 (240) to 11111110 (254). These addresses are used for experimental networks.
Private Addresses
Several addresses have been reserved for private use. Any company can use these addresses in 
its internal network in production or in experimental networks. The one caveat is that these 
addresses might not be routed to the Internet. To prevent this, Internet service providers ﬁlter 
out private addresses. Private addresses are described in RFC 1918; with one Class A network,

16 Class B networks, and 256 Class C networks in existence. Table 6-1 lists these private 
addresses.
Subnets
Subnetting plays an important part in IP addresses by helping to determine the network, 
subnetwork, and host part of an IP address. The network designer can manipulate the default 
mask to create subnetworks for LAN and WAN segments. From an IP address and a subnet 
mask, the subnetwork and broadcast address of the subnetwork can be determined; the CCDA 
must master these concepts.
Each A, B, and C address class has a default address mask. This mask is a 32-bit string. The 
mask bits are set to 1 to establish the network portion of the address. Table 6-2 shows the default 
mask for Class A, Class B, and Class C addresses.
Network-layer devices use the IP address and mask to determine the network portion of the 
address. Table 6-3 shows that a device with an IP address of 172.17.33.1 with a mask of 
255.255.240.0 is on subnetwork 172.17.32.0.
Remember that the major network is still 172.17.0.0, a Class B network. The 255.255.240.0 
mask creates 16 subnetworks (4 bolded bits in Table 6-3). The subnet mask takes the four most 
signiﬁcant bits of the third octet for subnetwork deﬁnition. Table 6-4 shows the subnetworks 
deﬁned with this mask.

IP Addressing     203
The subnetwork 172.27.0.0/28 is used when the ip subnet-zero command is conﬁgured on 
the router. Each subnetwork has 12 bits for the host portion. This produces (212) – 2 = 4096 – 
2 = 4094 hosts on each subnet. Two is subtracted for the subnet number and the broadcast 
address number. Looking at Table 6-5 with subnet 172.17.48.0, host addresses will range from 
172.17.48.1 to 172.17.63.254, with the subnet broadcast address of 172.17.63.255. Notice that 
the subnetwork address has 12 0s, and the broadcast address has all 1s as the least signiﬁcant 
bits (bolded in Table 6-5).

Mask Nomenclature
Two ways exist by which to represent a subnet mask. The ﬁrst format is dotted decimal—for 
example, 255.255.255.0. Recently, the bit mask number format has become popular. This 
format represents the subnet mask by using a slash with the number of bits with 1s in the mask. 
For example, the mask 255.255.255.0 is represented as /24. Table 6-6 shows some mask 
representations.
Variable-Length Subnet Masks 
Using one of the subnets from Table 6-4 on a point-to-point serial link would be a waste of IP 
addresses. Only two addresses are needed on a point-to-point serial link; therefore, more than 
4000 addresses would be wasted. Variable-length subnet masks (VLSMs) provide the 
capability to use different masks in a network for different segments. Large LANs could use a 
/23 mask, for example, for 510 hosts. A serial link could use a /30 mask for two hosts (routers). 
Not all routing protocols support VLSM; routing protocols will be covered in the “IP Routing 
Protocols” section later in this chapter.
Take subnet 172.17.48.0/20 from Table 6-4. Subdividing this network using a /23 mask 
produces eight subnetworks. Table 6-7 displays the results of this example; the bolded bits 
indicate the 3 bits used to determine subnets

Now take one of these subnetworks and use it for the serial links of the internetwork. Taking 
172.17.62.0/23 and subdividing it using a /30 mask produces 128 subnetworks for serial links. 
Table 6-8 displays the subnets created for serial links. The bolded bits indicate the bits used to

Supernetting
Just as subnetting provides the capability to subdivide Class A, Class B, and Class C addresses 
into smaller groups, supernetting groups networks into larger supernets by borrowing bits from 
the network portion of the address.  Say that you want a LAN network to have more than 254 
hosts; a class C network is not sufﬁcient. You can group two Class C networks using supernets 
to provide more IP addresses to the LAN segment without using secondary IP addresses on the 
router interface. Grouping classfull networks into supernets is considered classless routing.
Take networks 192.168.4.0/24 and 192.168.5.0/24, for example. These are Class C networks 
with a default mask of 255.255.255.0.  
Notice from Table 6-10 that these networks are the same up to 23 bits. They are combined, 
or supernetted, into one network—192.168.4.0/23. The mask for the new network is 
255.255.254.0. The ﬁrst host address is 192.168.4.1. The last host address is 192.168.5.254. 
The broadcast address is 192.168.5.255.
Address Aggregation
A set of classfull networks can also be summarized in routing entries by creating aggregate 
addresses at the supernet level. Figure 6-2 shows how address aggregation summarizes routes 
in which Router A sends only one route, 192.168.16.0/21, to its upstream router.
Classless Interdomain Routing 
Classless interdomain routing (CIDR) is used in Internet Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) 
routing to reduce the number of Class C routes coming from an autonomous system. For 
example, ISPs can allocate blocks of 4, 8, or 16 Class C networks to a customer and use only 
one route for reachability. In Figure 6-3, the client has a CIDR block of four Class C networks, 
but Router A announces only 208.10.8.0/22 to the ISP router.

Addressing Scheme
When assigning addresses to areas, networks, subnetworks, and end stations, it is important to 
maintain an addressing scheme that can scale as the company grows. Hierarchical network 
design begins with the addressing scheme. Routers cannot summarize routes if the networks are 
not assigned within bit boundaries. Assume, for example, that network 172.17.0.0/16 will be 
used in a medium- to large-sized company with nine areas. Each area could have several sites. 
192.168.16.0/24

208     Chapter 6: Designing for Specific Protocols
How can the network be divided allowing at least 2000 nodes per area? One method involves 
dividing the network into 16 areas at the /20 bit boundary. Notice that a /19 bit boundary would 
provide only eight areas, which would not be sufﬁcient for this exercise. The areas can be 
classiﬁed as in Table 6-11, providing sufﬁcient room for growth.
Networks within the areas should be assigned based on the expected number of hosts and 
segments on the networks. Serial links should be assigned a /30 subnet. Using the America East 
network, 172.17.16.0/20, subdivide into two large LANs with around 1000 hosts each, four 
medium LANs with 200 hosts, ﬁve small LANs with 20 hosts, and reserved addresses for serial 
links; leave room for future medium and small LANs. Table 6-12 shows one way of how the 
network can be further divided.

It is important to design the address assignment for LAN subnets as well. Reserve addresses for 
the network devices, such as routers, switches, and analyzers. Set aside a range of addresses for 
statically assigned servers. The rest can be used for dynamically assigned Dynamic Host 
Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) devices. Table 6-13 shows an example.

IP Routing Protocols
The following CCDA objectives are covered in this section:
Routing is the process by which a packet is forwarded from one network to another. Routers 
perform this function and also maintain tables of reachable networks and corresponding 
interfaces used to reach those networks. Such a table can be manually entered or dynamically 
created using information gathered by routing protocols.
This section covers IP routing protocol characteristics and differences.
Static Versus Dynamic Routing
Static routing is the method by which the network administrator manually enters routing entries 
on the router. The forwarding table is not learned by speaking with other routers on the network; 
these entries do not change unless the administrator alters them. The main beneﬁt of static 
routing is that no routing protocol trafﬁc is generated by the router. The drawback is that routers 
with static routes cannot react to network changes. Static routing is recommended for hub-and-
spoke topologies with low bandwidth.
Dynamic routing protocols build routing tables from information received from other routers in 
the internetwork. In the event of a network change, they can recalculate the best routes to a 
destination.

IP Routing Protocols     211
Distance Vector Versus Link-State Routing Protocols
Dynamic routing protocols are mainly divided into two types: distance vector or link-state. 
Distance vector protocols tend to be less complex than link-state protocols. Link-state protocols 
require routers to run algorithms to compute best paths to destinations, driving router CPU 
utilization higher.
Distance Vector Routing Protocols
The ﬁrst routing protocols produced were distance vector routing protocols, and are 
occasionally referred to as Bellman-Ford or Ford-Fulkerson routing protocols, based on the 
work of R.E. Bellman, L.R. Ford, and D.R. Fulkerson. These protocols are simpler than link-
state protocols. In distance vector routing protocols, distance vector routes are advertised as 
vectors of distance and direction. The distance metric is usually router hop count. The direction 
is the next-hop router to forward the packet to. The hop count is usually limited to 15 hops in 
distance vector routing protocols, an important scaling limitation. 
Distance vector algorithms call for each router to send all or some portion of its routing table 
only to its neighbors. The router builds a new table and sends it to its neighbors, and so on. The 
table is sent in a periodic fashion. The following is a list of distance-vector routing protocols 
(including non-IP routing protocols):
•
IP Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
•
Cisco’s Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP)
•
IPX Routing Information Protocol (IPX RIP)
•
AppleTalk Router Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP)
•
DEC DNA Phase IV
•
Xerox’s XNS Routing Information Protocol (XNS RIP)
Another protocol, Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol, is considered a hybrid routing 
protocol. This is a distance vector that acts as a link-state routing protocol.
Link-State Routing Protocols
Link-state routing protocols were developed to address some limitations of distance vector 
protocols. When running a link-state routing protocol, routers originate information about 
themselves (IP addresses), their connected links (number and type of links), and the state of 
each those links (up/down). The information is forwarded from router to router in the network. 
Each router makes a copy of the information and does not change it. Each router maintains a 
map of the network and independently calculates the best paths to destinations.

212     Chapter 6: Designing for Specific Protocols
Link-state protocols are sometimes called shortest path ﬁrst or distributed-database protocols. 
They are built on the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm, an algorithm from graph theory that was 
developed by E.W. Dijkstra. Because link-state protocols send only the state of their own links 
to all routers, and distance vector protocols send full routing tables to their neighbors, it can be 
said that link-state algorithms send small updates everywhere, while distance vector algorithms 
send larger updates only to neighboring routers. Link-state protocols are usually more CPU- 
and memory-intensive than distance vector routers. The following is a list of link-state routing 
protocols (including non-IP):
•
IP Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
•
CLNS and IP Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS)
•

IPX NetWare Link-Services Protocol (NLSP)
Routing Information Protocol 
Routing Information Protocol (RIP) version 1 is deﬁned in RFC 1058. This is a distance vector 
routing protocol that uses hop count as a metric. The maximum hop count is 15, with 16 
registering as unreachable. RIP is a classfull protocol and does not support VLSM or 
authentication. RIP routers send updates to their neighbors every 30 seconds. RIP was designed 
for smaller networks, usually implemented in UNIX environments.
RIP routers expect to see routes from their neighbors every 30 seconds. An expiration timer is 
implemented to set a route as an invalid route. For RIP, the invalid timer is 180 seconds (six 
times the update timer). Another timer is used to remove the route from the routing table. This 
is the ﬂush timer and it is set to 240 seconds, by default. Although not in RFC 1058, Cisco 
implements a hold-down timer for RIP. When a change occurs on a route, a triggered update is 
sent and the route is placed in holddown—no changes are accepted until the hold-down timer 
expires. The default hold-down timer is 180 seconds (six times the update timer).
RIP employs algorithms to prevent routing loops. These algorithms include triggered updates 
and split horizon with poison reverse.
Triggered Updates
A triggered update is a routing table update sent before the update timer has expired—for 
example, broadcasting the RIP table to neighboring routers before the normal 30-second 
interval. The triggered update is sent if a metric changes for a particular route, such as if a serial 
interface goes down.

IP Routing Protocols     213
Split Horizon with Poison Reverse
Split horizon is the technique in which routes that are learned from a neighboring router are not 
sent back to that neighboring router. With poison reverse, instead of suppressing the route, the 
route is sent with a metric of Unreachable.
RIP Version 2 
RIP version 2 (RIPv2) is deﬁned in RFC 1723. RIPv2 maintains the same distance vector 
characteristics of RIPv1. Updates are still sent every 30 seconds, and the 15-hop limitation still 
exists. However, RIPv2 becomes a classless routing protocol. The new features implemented 
include support for VLSM, support for authentication of route updates, and multicast updates.
RIPv2 can be used in small networks where VLSM masking is required. Authentication can be 
used to prevent communication from listening to UNIX stations. RFC 1723 deﬁnes simple 
plain-text authentication for RIPv2. In addition to plain-text passwords, Cisco’s implementa-
tion provides the capability to use MD5 authentication. MD5 is the message digest algorithm 
deﬁned in RFC 1321. Its algorithm takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces 
as output a 128-bit ﬁngerprint or message digest of the input, making it much more secure than 
plain-text passwords.
Interior Gateway Routing Protocol 
Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) was developed by Cisco Systems in the mid-1980s 
to overcome the limitations of RIP. IGRP is not limited to the 15-hop count limit of RIP. 
Although not used as a metric, IGRP keeps track of the hop count, which has an upper limit of 
255 hops. As with RIP, IGRP is a distance vector routing protocol that updates its neighbors in 
periodic fashion. IGRP is a classfull routing protocol and cannot implement VLSM. IGRP also 
summarizes addresses at network boundaries. As with RIP, IGRP implements split horizon, 
triggered updates, and hold-down timers for stability. One beneﬁt of IGRP is that it can load 
balance over unequal-cost links. As a routing protocol developed by Cisco, it is available only 
on Cisco routers. 
The IGRP update timer is set to 90 seconds. The invalid timer is set to 270 seconds (three times 
the update period). The ﬂush timer is set to 630 seconds (seven times the update period). If a 
triggered update is implemented, the route is placed in holddown—no new changes for the 
route are accepted until the hold-down timer expires. The default hold-down timer is 280 
seconds (three times the update timer, plus 10 seconds).
IGRP Metrics
IGRP uses a composite metric based on bandwidth, delay, load, and reliability. Although the 
path maximum transmission unit (MTU) is not used for the composite metric calculation, it is 
also tracked. By default, interface bandwidth and delay are used to calculate the metric.

214     Chapter 6: Designing for Specific Protocols
Open Shortest Path First 
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is deﬁned in RFC 2328 as a link-state routing protocol that 
uses the Dijkstra shortest path ﬁrst algorithm to calculate paths to destinations. In OSPF, each 
router sends link-state advertisements about itself and its links to all other routers in the 
network. Note that it does not send routing tables, but link-state information. All routers in the 
internetwork receive this information and calculate the best routes to the destination by running 
the SPF algorithm.
OSPF is a classless routing protocol that permits the use of VLSM. It supports equal-cost load 
balancing and route authentication. The metric used in OSPF is cost, which is an unsigned 16-
bit integer in the range of 1 to 65535. The default cost for interfaces is calculated based on the 
bandwidth in the formula 108/BW, with BW being the bandwidth of the interface expressed as 
a full integer of bits per second. A 10BaseT (10Mbps = 107bps) interface will have a cost of 
108/107 = 10. OSPF introduces some concepts of areas, border routers, and designated routers.
Link-State Advertisement Types
OSPF deﬁnes different link-state advertisement (LSA) types for router, network, summary, 
external, and so on. Table 6-14 describes the major LSA types.
Table 6-14
Major LSA Types 
Type Code

Description
1
Router LSA
Produced by every router and includes all the 
router’s links, interfaces, state of links, and cost.
2
Network LSA
Produced by every designated router (DR) on every 
transit broadcast or nonbroadcast multiaccess 
(NBMA) network. It lists all attached routers in the 
multiaccess network.
3
Summary LSA for 
ABRs
Produced by area border routers (ABRs). It is sent 
into an area to advertise destinations outside the 
area.
4
Summary LSA for 
ASBRs
Originated by area border routers (ARBs). It 
advertises autonomous system boundary routers 
(ASBRs). 
5
Autonomous System  
External LSA
Originated by ASBRs. Advertises destinations 
external to the OSPF autonomous system (AS), 
ﬂooded throughout the OSPF AS.
7
Not-so-stubby area 
External LSA
Originated by ASBRs in a not-so-stubby area 
(NSSA). It is not ﬂooded throughout the OSPF 
autonomous system, only to the NSSA. 

IP Routing Protocols     215
OSPF Areas
As a network grows, the initial ﬂooding and database maintenance of LSAs can burden the CPU 
of a router. OSPF uses areas to reduce these effects. An area is a logical grouping of routers and 
links that divides the network. Routers share link-state information with only those routers in 
their area. This reduces the size of the database.
Area 0 is reserved for the backbone area, which is responsible for distributing routing 
information between areas. As you can see in Figure 6-4, communication between Area 1 and 
Area 2 must ﬂow through Area 0. In intra-area trafﬁc, packets are passed between routers in a 
single area. In inter-area trafﬁc, packets are passed between routers in different areas.
Figure 6-4
OSPF Areas
Stub Areas
Consider Area 1 in Figure 6-4. Its only path to the external routes is through Router A. All 
external routes are ﬂooded to all areas in the OSPF autonomous system (AS). An area can be 
conﬁgured as a stub area to prevent OSPF external LSAs (type 5) from being ﬂooded into that 
area. Note that network summary LSAs (type 3) from other areas will still be ﬂooded into the 
area.

216     Chapter 6: Designing for Specific Protocols
Totally Stubby Areas
Take the Area 1 case in Figure 6-4 one step further. The only path for Area 1 to get to Area 0 
and other areas is through Router A. So, in addition to preventing external LSAs (type 5) from 
being ﬂooded, in a totally stubby area network summary LSAs (type 3) are not ﬂooded. Only a 
single LSA is sent for the default route.
Not-So-Stubby Areas
Notice that Area 2 in Figure 6-4 has an ASBR. If this area is conﬁgured as a Not-so-stubby area 
(NSSA), it will allow the external LSAs (type 7) into the OSPF system, while retaining the 
characteristics of a stub area to the rest of the AS. The area border router (ABR) for area 2 can 
be conﬁgured to convert the not-so-stubby area External LSAs (type 7) to autonomous system 
external LSAs (type 5) and ﬂood the rest of the network.
OSPF Router Types
OSPF introduces several router types related to their place in the area architecture. Figure 6-5 
displays a diagram of OSPF router types.

IP Routing Protocols     217
The following is a list of explanations for each router type shown in Figure 6-5:
•
Internal router—All routers whose interfaces belong to the same OSPF area. 
These routers keep only one link-state database.
•
Area border router (ABR)—Routers that are connected to more than one area. 
These routers maintain a link-state database for each area to which they belong.
•
Autonomous system boundary router (ASBR)—Routers that inject external 
link-state advertisements into the OSPF database. These external routes are learned either 
via other routing protocols or as static routes.
•
Backbone router—Routers with at least one interface attached to Area 0.
Note that a router can be an ABR, ASBR, and backbone router at the same time.
Designated Routers
On multiaccess networks (such as Ethernet or multipoint Frame Relay), OSPF routers on the 
network select a designated router (DR) and a backup designated router (BDR). To reduce 
LSAs on the multiaccess network, all routers send their LSAs to the DR and BDR. The DR 
forwards them to all non-DR routers. The DR also sends the Network LSA (type 2) to the rest 
of the internetwork. The BDR takes over the function of the DR if the DR fails.
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol 
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) was released in the early 1990s as a 
signiﬁcant evolution toward a scalable routing protocol. EIGRP is a classless protocol that 
permits VLSMs and supernetting. Routing updates are not sent periodically, as in IGRP. EIGRP 
also allows authentication, even with MD5. Another enhancement is that EIGRP can be used to 
route IPX and AppleTalk over WANs. EIGRP autosummarizes networks at borders and can 
load balance over unequal-cost paths.
EIGRP uses the same metrics as IGRP, but scaled by 256 for ﬁner granularity. The metrics 
are bandwidth, delay, load, reliability, and MTU. EIGRP implements a Diffusing Update 
Algorithm (DUAL) to guarantee freedom from routing loops. Work on DUAL was developed 
by Garcia-Luna-Aceves.  
EIGRP is considered a hybrid protocol, distance vector with link-state characteristic. It 
advertises its routing table to its neighbors as distance vector protocols do, but it uses hellos and 
forms neighbor relationships as link-state protocols. EIGRP can be used only on Cisco routers.
EIGRP updates are sent only when necessary (as with link-state protocols) and are sent only to 
those routers requiring the new information. Hello packets are used to learn of neighboring 
routers. On most networks, the hello packet interval is 5 seconds. On multipoint networks with 
link speeds of T1 and slower, hello packets are unicast every 60 seconds.

218     Chapter 6: Designing for Specific Protocols
Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System 
Although not an objective for the DCN test, a CCDA should know that Intermediate System-
to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) is a link-state routing protocol capable of routing IP packets. IS-
IS can also route ISO’s Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP). The ISO adopted IS-IS for 
TCP/IP instead of the OSPF protocol that was being developed by the Internet Architecture 
Board. DEC also adopted IS-IS for its DECNet Phase V. 
IS-IS is very similar to OSPF. It implements link-state database with SPF algorithms to 
calculate paths, uses the area concept and classless protocols, elects DR routers, and has 
authentication capabilities.
Border Gateway Protocol 
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an IP Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) used to connect 
different autonomous systems, and it is commonly used to connect larger organizations to the 
Internet. BGP performs routing among multiple autonomous systems or domains and 
exchanges reachability information with other BGP systems. All other routing protocols 
(EIGRP, OSPF, RIP, and IS-IS) are used as Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) inside an 
autonomous system. The current version is BGP version 4.
IP Routing Protocol Administrative Distance
On routers running several routing protocols, the possibility exists that two different routing 
protocols have a route to a destination. Cisco routers assign each routing protocol an 
administrative distance, which by default is as show in Table 6-15. The lower the administrative 
distance, the more preferred that route will be.
For example, say that a router has a route in EIGRP for network 172.20.10.0/24 with the best 
path out Ethernet 0, and has a route in OSPF for network 172.20.10.0/24 with the best path out 
Ethernet 1. Because EIGRP routes have an administrative distance of 90 and OSPF routes have 
an administrative distance of 110, the EIGRP route will be entered into the routing table, and 
packets with destinations of 172.20.10.0/24 will be sent out Ethernet 0.

Novell IPX Addressing     219
Novell IPX Addressing
The following CCDA objectives are covered in this section:
Novell’s Network Operating System (NOS) has been popular for years. Although newer 
versions of this NOS uses TCP/IP for network transport, legacy implementations are still out 
there. Legacy Novell uses SPX/IPX protocols for transport.
IPX Addresses
IPX addresses consist of a 32-bit network part and a 48-bit host part. The 32-bit network 
address is represented in hexadecimal format and is conﬁgured by the network administrator. 
The host part of the address is the 48-bit MAC address on the network interface card of network 
nodes; the host part of the address is not conﬁgured by the administrator.
Figure 6-6 shows an IPX network number in binary and hexadecimal format. Every 4 bits of a 
binary number can be converted to hexadecimal, and vice versa. Table 6-16 shows binary-to-
hexadecimal conversion.

0ABCDEF0, and 00ADDBAD. 
IPX Address Assignment
The best way to assign addresses to IPX networks is to convert the IP subnet address from 
dotted decimal to hexadecimal format. For example, take IP subnet 172.16.3.0 and convert it to 
AC0F0300. This is a proven technique that will make the IPX addresses unique and that also 
will provide scalability. Table 6-17 shows some samples of IPX networks.

IPX Routing and Service Advertising Protocols     221
IPX Routing and Service Advertising Protocols
The following CCDA objectives are covered in this section:
This section covers IPX routing and advertisement protocol characteristics and differences.
IPX Routing Information Protocol
IPX Routing Information Protocol (IPX RIP) is a distance vector routing protocol for Novell. 
IPX RIP sends periodic updates every 60 seconds and uses a tick as a metric. A tick is a delay 
assigned to interfaces off a router. One tick is 1/18th of a second. In the case of two paths with 
equal tick count, then hop count is used as a tie breaker. As in IP RIP, IPX RIP has a maximum 
hop count limit of 15 hops, by default.
IPX Service Advertising Protocol 
IPX Service Advertising Protocol (SAP) is not a routing protocol; it is a protocol for network 
resources, such as ﬁle and print servers, to advertise the addresses and services they provide. 
SAP is the companion protocol to IPX RIP—RIP takes care of the networks, and SAP takes 
care of the services. As with IPX RIP updates, SAP advertisements are sent every 60 seconds. 
Routers gather SAP advertisements, add them to the SAP table, and broadcast the SAP table 
out of their interfaces.

222     Chapter 6: Designing for Specific Protocols
NetWare Link-Services Protocol 
IPX RIP and SAP each produce periodic broadcasts every 60 seconds, adding signiﬁcant trafﬁc 
to the network. NetWare Link-Services Protocol (NLSP) is a link-state routing protocol 
designed to overcome the limitations of RIP/SAP. NLSP has characteristics similar to other 
link-state protocols—link-state advertisements are generated by routers and are ﬂooded 
throughout the network, and each router computes best paths to destinations. Updates are sent 
only when required.
NSLP also supports up to 127 hops and permits hierarchical routing with area, domain, and 
global internetwork components. An area is a collection of connected networks with the same 
area address, and a domain is a collection of areas. A global internetwork is a collection of 
domains.
NSLP supports hierarchical addressing, in which each area is identiﬁed by the 32-bit address 
and a 32-bit mask. This is similar to the masking done in IP addressing. The mask identiﬁes the 
network address for an area. For example, take the address of 005A7000 with a mask of 
FFFFFF00. Notice that 24 bits are set to 1 in the mask. The network address for the area is 
005A70. The remaining 8 bits are used for networks within this area.
AppleTalk Addressing
The following CCDA objectives are covered in this section:
AppleTalk was developed by Apple Computer in the early 1980s. This section reviews the 
addressing of AppleTalk networks and its routing protocols.
21
Propose an addressing model for the customer’s areas, networks,

25
Recommend routing and bridging protocols that meet a customer’s 
requirements for performance, security, and capacity.

AppleTalk Addressing     223
Address Formats and Assignment
The current implementation of AppleTalk is Phase 2. Addresses are composed of three 
elements:
•
Network number—A 16-bit value assigned by the administrator using the cable-
range command.
•
Node number—An 8-bit value dynamically assigned that identiﬁes the node.
•
Socket number—This 8-bit number identiﬁes the socket running on the node; it is 
similar to a port number in TCP/IP.
Addresses are written in decimal format, with periods separating the ﬁelds. Examples of 
AppleTalk addresses are 11.2, 100.50, and 67.10. If the socket number is included in the 
addresses, it is appended to the end. For AppleTalk address 11.2 with socket 7, the full address 
is 11.2.7. Network addresses range from 1 to 65,535, and node addresses range from 1 to 254. 
Sockets also range from 1 to 254.
Another particularity of AppleTalk network number assignments is that several consecutive 
network numbers can be assigned to an interface. This is called an extended cable range. For 
example, an Ethernet segment can have a cable range of 10 to 11 conﬁgured, which includes 
nodes from 10.1 to 11.255.
AppleTalk Zones
AppleTalk deﬁnes a zone as a logical group of nodes or networks. These nodes or networks 
need not be physically contiguous to belong to the same AppleTalk zone. Zones are conﬁgured 
to group resources together and are used to limit AppleTalk broadcasts and provide some 
security. Zones can be conﬁgured by function within a company, as in separating a ﬁnance 
department from an engineering department.
The Zone Information Protocol (ZIP) is the session-layer A protocol that maintains network 
number-to-zone name mappings in AppleTalk routers. Each router maintains a table with the 
network numbers and the zone(s) to which they belong.
AppleTalk Routing Protocols
AppleTalk’s routing protocol is Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP). AppleTalk also 
can be routed over a WAN using EIGRP. In addition, AppleTalk can be tunneled using the 
AppleTalk Update-Based Routing Protocol (AURP).

224     Chapter 6: Designing for Specific Protocols
Routing Table Maintenance Protocol 
Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP) is the distance vector routing protocol for 
forwarding AppleTalk packets. RTMP is based on RIP, uses hop count as the metric, and has 
the same limitation of 15 hops. Routing table updates are sent in periodic fashion. The table 
contains the following information for each of the destination routes known to the router:
•
Network cable range of the destination network
•
Distance, in hops, to the destination network
•
Router port that leads to the destination network
•
Address of the next-hop router
•
Current state of entry (good, suspect, or bad)
AppleTalk Update-Based Routing Protocol 
AppleTalk Update-Based Routing Protocol (AURP) can be used to extend AppleTalk networks 
over a TCP/IP network, as shown in Figure 6-7. AURP encapsulates AppleTalk packets in User 
Datagram Protocol (UDP) headers, creating a virtual link between AppleTalk networks. AURP 
is the routing protocol in this virtual link and is more effective than RTMP because it does not 
send periodic updates through the link.
EIGRP for AppleTalk
EIGRP can be used to route AppleTalk packets over a WAN. EIGRP is conﬁgured for links 
between routers; RTMP is used on other interfaces. EIGRP sends updates only when changes 
occur, which represents a signiﬁcant improvement over the periodic (10-second) RTMP 
updates.

more update packets are sent every period. Table 6-18 compares distance vector protocol update 
times and routes per packet.
*IPX SAP is not a routing protocol, but a Service Advertising Protocol. However, it is periodic by nature.
Bridging Protocol Scalability
The following CCDA objectives are covered in this section:
This section covers the two scalability issues concerning bridging protocols.
Transparent Bridging Scalability Issues
A transparent bridge ﬂoods all multicast frames, broadcast frames, and frames with an unknown 
destination address out every port except the one on which the frame was received. Broadcasts 
and multicast create scalability issues that can be controlled only with routing.
Transparent bridges implement the Spanning-Tree Algorithm, which is speciﬁed in IEEE 
802.1d. In the sample network in Figure 6-8, the Spanning-Tree Protocol states that only one 
active path exists between two stations. If a physical loop exists in the network, the Spanning-
Tree Protocol handles this loop by disabling bridge ports.

Figure 6-8
Spanning-Tree Protocol
Transparent bridges send Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) frames to each other to build and 
maintain a Spanning Tree. The BPDU frames are sent every two seconds. The amount of trafﬁc 
caused by BPDU frames can be a scalability issue on large ﬂat networks with numerous 
switches and bridges. For more information on the Spanning-Tree Protocol, see Chapter 4, 
“Network Topologies and LAN Design.”
Source-Route Bridging Scalability Issues
In source-route bridging (SRB), a source node ﬁnds another node by sending explorer packets. 
An all-routes explorer packet will ﬂood the network with explorer packets. As the number of 
nodes grows, scalability is affected. The amount of explorer frames can also affect the 
destination Token Ring. Furthermore, the diameter of an SRB network is limited to seven hops. 
For more information on SRB, see Chapter 3, “Application Considerations.” To reduce the 
amount of trafﬁc on the network, do the following:
•
Limit the size of ﬂat, bridged networks
•
Use routing to segment the network
•
Use IP or IPX to transport NetBIOS trafﬁc versus NetBEUI

Cisco IOS Software Features
The following CCDA objective is covered in this section:
Cisco IOS provides several features that can be used to optimize and scale an internetwork. This 
section describes Cisco IOS features that help scale a network.
Depending on customer requirements, the following features may be implemented with Cisco 
IOS:
•
Access lists
•
Encryption
•
Proxy services
•
Compression
•
Trafﬁc shaping
•
Queuing: custom, priority, and weighted-fair
The remainder of this section discusses these features.
Access Lists
Access lists are primarily used to control (block or forward) trafﬁc at router interfaces.  The 
access list deﬁnes a criteria that is applied to every packet that is processed by the router for that 
interface. Access lists are also used to improve the performance of a network, such as to ﬁlter 
unnecessary IPX Service Advertising Protocol (SAP) broadcasts, or to ﬁlter routes in routing 
protocol redistribution.
Two types of access lists exist: standard and extended. Standard access lists allow only simple 
criteria to be speciﬁed, such as packet source address. Extended access lists allow additional, 
more complex criteria to be speciﬁed, such as the packet destination address, upper-layer 
protocol, and application port number. Access lists can be deﬁned for each protocol, with an 
individual speciﬁc set of criteria that can be deﬁned.
Access lists can be applied inbound or outbound to interfaces. If the access list is applied 
inbound to an interface, Cisco IOS checks the access list’s criteria statements for a match when 
the router receives a packet. If the packet is permitted, the software continues to process the 
packet. If the packet is denied, the software discards the packet. If the access list is applied 
outbound to an interface, the software checks the access list’s criteria statements for a match

as access lists, proxy services, encryption, compression, and queuing.

after receiving and routing a packet to the outbound interface. If the packet is permitted, the 
software transmits the packet. If the packet is denied, the software discards the packet.
Certain numbers are used to deﬁne access lists. A range of numbers has been reserved for each 
type of access list, as shown in Table 6-19.
Access List Example
The access-group command is used to apply an access list to an interface. The access-list 
command is used to deﬁne the criteria for the access list. The order of the access list statements 
is important. The Cisco IOS software tests the packets against every criteria statement in the 
order in which the statements were created. After a match is found, no more criteria statements 
are checked.
In the following conﬁguration, an IP protocol access list is applied on the interface Ethernet 0 
to inbound packets. All trafﬁc from network 10.0.0.0/8 is denied; the rest is permitted.

Encryption
To safeguard IP data, Cisco IOS 11.2 implements Cisco Encryption Technology (CET). CET 
provides packet-level encryption that enables you to protect the conﬁdentiality and integrity of 
network data traveling between peer encrypting routers. On Cisco IOS 11.3(3)T and later 
versions, another encryption option, IPSec, is available. IPSec is a framework of open standards 
developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). IPSec services are similar to those 
provided by CET; however, IPSec provides a more robust security solution and is standards-
based.
More information on IP security and encryption can be found at www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/
td/doc/product/software/ios120/12cgcr/secur_c/scprt4/scencove.htm.
Proxy Services
Cisco IOS has numerous proxy services that can be used to meet performance and connectivity 
concerns due to topology and behavior of network applications. Some examples are listed in 
this section.
Resource Discovery on Serverless LANs
To aid in the resource discovery on serverless LANs, the router can provide the following 
services:
•
A router can respond to an IPX GetNearestServer request from a NetWare client if there 
is no local NetWare server.
•
A router can forward certain types of UDP broadcast frames by conﬁguring a helper 
address.
•
A router can respond to an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) request when a local IP 
station looks for a remote station. This is called proxy ARP.
Trafﬁc Reduction on Bridged Networks and WANs
On bridge networks and WANs, the route provides the following services:
•
A source-route bridging router can convert an all-routes explorer frame into a single-route 
frame, thus reducing the number of frames in a network that has many redundant paths.
•
NetBIOS name caching allows a router to convert NetBIOS name-lookup frames from 
explorers to single-route frames.

Cisco IOS Software Features     231
•
Watchdog spooﬁng on the server end of a NetWare Core protocol session answers 
keepalives locally, permitting DDR links to drop.
•
Novell Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX) spooﬁng does the same thing as watchdog 
spooﬁng, except that this is for applications that use SPX instead of NCP.
Improved Performance for Time-Sensitive Applications
The Logical Link Control (LLC) local acknowledgement feature allows a router to respond to 
LLC frames so that SNA and other time-sensitive applications do not time out when used on 
large routed networks.
Data Compression Solutions
Compression can be used to help reduce the bandwidth utilized on the network, especially on 
low-speed WAN links. Cisco IOS software provides the following data compression solutions:
•
Van Jaconson TCP/IP header compression, which conforms to RFC 1144
•
Per-interface (link) compression
•
Per-virtual circuit (payload) compression
•
Frame-Relay Payload Compression, from FRF.9 compression per DLCI
•
Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) header compression
Trafﬁc Shaping
Cisco IOS 11.2 supports both generic trafﬁc shaping and Frame Relay trafﬁc shaping, 
as detailed in this section.
Generic Trafﬁc Shaping
Generic trafﬁc shaping helps reduce the ﬂow of outbound trafﬁc from a router interface into a 
backbone transport network when congestion is detected in the downstream portions of the 
downstream network or in a downstream router. Topologies that have high-speed links feeding 
lower-speed links often experience bottlenecks because of speed mismatch. Generic trafﬁc 
shaping helps by throttling back trafﬁc volume at the source end.

232     Chapter 6: Designing for Specific Protocols
Frame Relay Trafﬁc Shaping
Frame Relay trafﬁc shaping uses the characteristics of Frame Relay to help shape the trafﬁc on 
a PVC basis. Introduced in Cisco IOS 11.2, it offers the following capabilities:
•
Rate enforcement on a per-virtual circuit (VC) basis—A peak rate can be 
conﬁgured to limit outbound trafﬁc to either the committed information rate (CIR) or 
some other deﬁned value,
•
Generalized backward explicit congestion notiﬁcation (BECN) support 
on a per-VC basis—The router can monitor BECNs and throttle trafﬁc based on 
BECN marked packet feedback,
•
Priority and custom queuing support at the VC level—This allows for ﬁner 
granularity in the queuing of trafﬁc, based on an individual VC.
Queuing Services
Queuing services enable a network administrator to manage the varying demand that 
applications put on networks. Since Cisco started supporting weighted fair queuing in IOS 11.0, 
there has been less need for more drastic types of queuing, such as priority and custom queuing. 
In some cases, however, mission-critical applications running on congested serial links might 
still require priority or custom queuing. The following sections describe the different queuing 
types.
Priority Queuing
Priority queuing is particularly useful for time-sensitive, mission-critical protocols such as 
SNA. It is appropriate for cases in which WAN links are congested from time to time. Priority 
queuing has four queues: high, medium, normal, and low. Trafﬁc can be assigned to the various 
queues based on protocol, port number, or other criteria. The high-priority queue is always 
emptied before the lower-priority queues are serviced. Priority queuing ensures that one type of 
trafﬁc will get through at the expense of all other types of trafﬁc.
Custom Queuing
Custom queuing is a different approach for prioritizing trafﬁc. As with priority queuing, trafﬁc 
can be assigned to various queues based on protocol, port number, or other criteria. However, 
custom queuing handles the queues in a round-robin fashion. Custom queuing works by 
establishing interface output queues. The transmission size of each queue is speciﬁed in bytes. 
When the transmission window size has been reached by transmitting the appropriate number 
of frames from a queue, the next queue is checked. Custom queuing is more fair than priority 
queuing, although priority queuing is more powerful for prioritizing a mission-critical protocol.

Cisco IOS Software Features     233
Weighted Fair Queuing
Weighted fair queuing was ﬁrst implemented in Cisco IOS 11.0. It is enabled by default on most 
low-bandwidth interfaces; no conﬁguration is required to use weighted fair queuing. Weighted 
fair queuing is more fair than either priority or custom queuing because it handles the problems 
inherent in queuing schemes that are essentially ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served.
The main problem with ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served algorithms is that sessions using large packets 
can impede sessions using small packets. For example, FTP can negatively affect the 
performance of Telnet. The weighted fair queuing implementation looks at sizes of messages 
and ensures that high-volume senders do not crowd out low-volume senders. Weighted fair 
queuing queues packets are based on the arrival time of the last bit rather than the ﬁrst bit, which 
ensures that applications that use large packets cannot unfairly monopolize the bandwidth.

Network Management
The following CCDA objectives are covered in this section:
Network management becomes even more essential as networks increase in size. The 
recommended network management solution must help manage this growth. Beyond 
monitoring current network behavior and conﬁguration, network management products must 
assist in identifying potential problem areas or elements that might limit future growth.
Proactive Network Management
Recommend that the customer take a proactive approach toward network management. This 
means monitoring the network before problems occur. The client must gather network statistics 
and document those as a baseline of the current status of the network. As part of the baseline, 
include segment utilization, router CPU utilization, and response time tests. Then deﬁne 
acceptable service goals for the network. 
Cisco recommends that you help customers develop proactive network management strategies 
by assisting in the following steps:
•
Determine network service goals.
•
Deﬁne metrics for measuring whether the goals have been met.
8
Determine the customer’s requirements for new applications, protocols, 
number of users, peak usage hours, security, and network management.

Network Management Processes
The ISO deﬁnes ﬁve types of network management processes. You can remember these 
processes by the acronym FCAPS (fault, conﬁguration, accounting, performance, security):
•
Fault management—Refers to detecting, isolating, and correcting problems (faults). 
HP OpenView is an example of a fault-reporting network management station. Fault 
events are reported to the station via Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) 
traps or regular interval polling by the management station. The station can be conﬁgured 
to pop a window or to send an email or page to network analysts. A cable tester must still 
be used to troubleshoot physical-layer errors. 
•
Conﬁguration management—Refers to baselining, modifying, and tracking 
conﬁguration changes of network devices. This facility also provides the capability of 
tracking versions of operating systems on the devices. CiscoWorks is an excellent 
example of a network application used for conﬁguration management of Cisco devices.
•
Accounting management—Refers to tracking the usage of segments to determine 
usage-based billing of service.
•
Performance management—Refers to the measure of network behavior and 
effectiveness of delivering frames, packets, and segments. It includes protocol and 
application behavior, reachability to destinations, and the measurement of response times.  
•
Security management—Refers to the maintenance and distribution of authentication 
and authorization information, such as passwords and encryption keys. The use of audit 
logs to document logins or repeated unsuccessful attempts to log in is also part of security 
management. A company should have a documented security policy based on the 
understanding of which assets are most valuable. 

254     Chapter 7: The Design Document and Cisco Network Management Applications
Simple Network Management Protocol 
The SNMP is an application-layer protocol that facilitates the exchange of management 
information between network devices. It is part of the TCP/IP protocol suite. SNMP enables 
network administrators to manage network performance, ﬁnd and solve network problems, and 
plan for network growth. 
Two versions of SNMP exist: SNMP Version 1 (SNMPv1) and SNMP Version 2 (SNMPv2). Both 
versions have a number of features in common, but SNMPv2 offers enhancements, such as 
additional protocol operations. Standardization of yet another version of SNMP—SNMP 
Version 3 (SNMPv3)—is pending. This section provides descriptions of the SNMPv1 and 
SNMPv2 protocol operations. Figure 7-1 illustrates a basic network managed by SNMP.
Figure 7-1
SNMP Facilitates the Exchange of Network Information Between Devices 
An SNMP managed network consists of three key components: managed devices, agents, and 
NMSs.
A managed device is a network node that contains an SNMP agent and resides on a managed 
network. Managed devices collect and store management information and make this 
information available to NMSs using SNMP. Managed devices, sometimes called network 
elements, can be routers and access servers, switches and bridges, hubs, computer hosts, or 
printers.
An agent is an NMS software module that resides in a managed device. An agent has local 
knowledge of management information and translates that information into a form compatible 
with SNMP.
ith4601

Network Management     255
An NMS executes applications that monitor and control managed devices. NMSs provide the bulk 
of the processing and memory resources required for network management. One or more NMSs 
must exist on any managed network.
Figure 7-2 illustrates the relationship between these three components. 
Figure 7-2
An SNMP Managed Network Consists of Managed Devices, Agents, and NMSs
SNMP Basic Commands
Managed devices are monitored and controlled using four basic SNMP commands: read, write, 
trap, and traversal operations.
The read command is used by an NMS to monitor managed devices. The NMS examines 
different variables that are maintained by managed devices.
The write command is used by an NMS to control managed devices. The NMS changes the 
values of variables stored within managed devices.

The trap command is used by managed devices to asynchronously report events to the NMS. 
When certain types of events occur, a managed device sends a trap to the NMS.
Traversal operations are used by the NMS to determine which variables a managed device 
supports and to sequentially gather information in variable tables, such as a routing table.
SNMP Management Information Base
A Management Information Base (MIB) is a collection of information that is organized 
hierarchically. MIBs are accessed using a network-management protocol such as SNMP. They 
are comprised of managed objects and are identiﬁed by object identiﬁers.
A managed object (sometimes called an MIB object, an object, or an MIB) is one of any number 
of speciﬁc characteristics of a managed device. Managed objects are comprised of one or more 
object instances, which are essentially variables.
Two types of managed objects exist: scalar and tabular. Scalar objects deﬁne a single object 
instance. Tabular objects deﬁne multiple related object instances that are grouped together in 
MIB tables.
An example of a managed object is atInput, which is a scalar object that contains a single object 
instance, the integer value that indicates the total number of input AppleTalk packets on a router 
interface.
An object identiﬁer (or object ID) uniquely identiﬁes a managed object in the MIB hierarchy. 
The MIB hierarchy can be depicted as a tree with a nameless root, the levels of which are 
assigned by different organizations. Figure 7-3 illustrates the MIB tree.
The top-level MIB object IDs belong to different standards organizations, while lower-level 
object IDs are allocated by associated organizations.
Vendors can deﬁne private branches that include managed objects for their own products. MIBs 
that have not been standardized typically are positioned in the experimental branch.
The managed object atInput can be uniquely identiﬁed either by the object name— iso.identiﬁed-
organization.dod.internet.private.enterprise.cisco.temporary variables.AppleTalk.atInput—
or by the equivalent object descriptor: 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.3.3.1.
SNMP and Data Representation
SNMP must account for and adjust to incompatibilities between managed devices. Different 
computers use different data-representation techniques, which can compromise the ability of 
SNMP to exchange information between managed devices. SNMP uses a subset ofAbstract 
Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) to accommodate communication between diverse systems.

SNMP Version 1 (SNMPv1)
SNMP Version 1 (SNMPv1) is the initial implementation of the SNMP protocol. It is described 
in RFC 1157 and functions within the speciﬁcations of the Structure of Management 
Information (SMI). SNMPv1 operates over protocols such as User Datagram Protocol (UDP), 
IP, OSI Connectionless Network Service (CLNS), AppleTalk Datagram-Delivery Protocol 
(DDP), and Novell IPX. SNMPv1 is widely used and is the de facto network-management 
protocol in the Internet community.
SNMPv1 and Structure of Management Information (SMI)
The Structure of Management Information (SMI) deﬁnes the rules for describing management 
information, using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1). The SNMPv1 SMI is deﬁned in 
RFC 1155. The SMI makes three key speciﬁcations: ASN.1 data types, SMI-speciﬁc data types, 
and SNMP MIB tables.
SNMPv1 and ASN.1 Data Types    The SNMPv1 SMI speciﬁes that all managed objects 
have a certain subset of ASN.1 data types associated with them. Three ASN.1 data types are 
required: name, syntax, and encoding. The name serves as the object identiﬁer (object ID). The 
syntax deﬁnes the data type of the object (for example, integer or string). The SMI uses a subset 
of the ASN.1 syntax deﬁnitions. The encoding data describes how information associated with 
a managed object is formatted as a series of data items for transmission over the network.
The SNMPv1 SMI speciﬁes the use of a number of SMI-speciﬁc data types, which are divided 
into two categories: simple data types and application-wide data types.
Three simple data types are deﬁned in the SNMPv1 SMI, all of which are unique values: integers, 
octet strings, and object IDs. The integer data type is a signed integer in the range of 
2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Octet strings are ordered sequences of zero to 65,535 octets. 
Object IDs come from the set of all object identiﬁers allocated according to the rules speciﬁed in 
ASN.1.
Seven application-wide data types exist in the SNMPv1 SMI: network addresses, counters, 
gauges, time ticks, opaques, integers, and unsigned integers. Network addresses represent an 
address from a particular protocol family. SNMPv1 supports only 32-bit IP addresses. Counters 
are nonnegative integers that increase until they reach a maximum value and then return to zero. 
In SNMPv1, a 32-bit counter size is speciﬁed. Gauges are nonnegative integers that can 
increase or decrease but retain the maximum value reached. A time tick represents a hundredth 
of a second since some event. An opaque represents an arbitrary encoding that is used to pass 
arbitrary information strings that do not conform to the strict data typing used by the SMI. An 
integer represents signed integer-valued information. This data type redeﬁnes the integer data 
type, which has arbitrary precision in ASN.1 but bounded precision in the SMI. An unsigned 
integer represents unsigned integer-valued information and is useful when values are always 

Network Management     259
nonnegative. This data type redeﬁnes the integer data type, which has arbitrary precision in 
ASN.1 but bounded precision in the SMI.
SNMP MIB Tables    The SNMPv1 SMI deﬁnes highly structured tables that are used to group 
the instances of a tabular object (that is, an object that contains multiple variables). Tables are 
composed of zero or more rows, which are indexed in a way that allows SNMP to retrieve or 
alter an entire row with a single Get, GetNext, or Set command.
SNMPv1 Protocol Operations
SNMP is a simple request-response protocol. The network-management system issues a 
request, and managed devices return responses. This behavior is implemented by using one of 
four protocol operations: Get, GetNext, Set, and Trap. The Get operation is used by the NMS to 
retrieve the value of one or more object instances from an agent. If the agent responding to the 
Get operation cannot provide values for all the object instances in a list, it does not provide any 
values. The GetNext operation is used by the NMS to retrieve the value of the next object 
instance in a table or list within an agent. The Set operation is used by the NMS to set the values 
of object instances within an agent. The Trap operation is used by agents to asynchronously 
inform the NMS of a signiﬁcant event.
SNMP Version 2 (SNMPv2)
SNMP Version 2 (SNMPv2) is an evolution of the initial version, SNMPv1. Originally, 
SNMPv2 was published as a set of proposed Internet standards in 1993; currently, it is a Draft 
Standard. As with SNMPv1, SNMPv2 functions within the speciﬁcations of the SMI. In theory, 
SNMPv2 offers a number of improvements to SNMPv1, including additional protocol 
operations.
SNMPv2 and Structure of Management Information (SMI)
The SMI deﬁnes the rules for describing management information, using ASN.1.
The SNMPv2 SMI is described in RFC 1902. It makes certain additions and enhancements to 
the SNMPv1 SMI-speciﬁc data types, such as including bit strings, network addresses, and 
counters. Bit strings are deﬁned only in SNMPv2 and comprise zero or more named bits that 
specify a value. Network addresses represent an address from a particular protocol family. 
SNMPv1 supports only 32-bit IP addresses, but SNMPv2 can support other types of addresses 
as well. Counters are non-negative integers that increase until they reach a maximum value and 
then return to zero. In SNMPv1, a 32-bit counter size is speciﬁed. In SNMPv2, 32-bit and 64-
bit counters are deﬁned.

260     Chapter 7: The Design Document and Cisco Network Management Applications
SMI Information Modules    The SNMPv2 SMI also speciﬁes information modules, which 
specify a group of related deﬁnitions. Three types of SMI information modules exist: MIB 
modules, compliance statements, and capability statements. MIB modules contain deﬁnitions 
of interrelated managed objects. Compliance statements provide a systematic way to describe 
a group of managed objects that must be implemented for conformance to a standard. 
Capability statements are used to indicate the precise level of support that an agent claims with 
respect to an MIB group. An NMS can adjust its behavior toward agents according to the 
capabilities statements associated with each agent.
SNMPv2 Protocol Operations
The Get, GetNext, and Set operations used in SNMPv1 are exactly the same as those used in 
SNMPv2. SNMPv2, however, adds and enhances some protocol operations. The SNMPv2 Trap 
operation, for example, serves the same function as that used in SNMPv1. It, however, uses a 
different message format and is designed to replace the SNMPv1 Trap.
SNMPv2 also deﬁnes two new protocol operations: GetBulk and Inform. The GetBulk 
operation is used by the NMS to efﬁciently retrieve large blocks of data, such as multiple rows 
in a table. GetBulk ﬁlls a response message with as much of the requested data as will ﬁt. The 
Inform operation allows one NMS to send trap information to another NMS and receive a 
response. In SNMPv2, if the agent responding to GetBulk operations cannot provide values for 
all the variables in a list, it provides partial results.
SNMP Management
SNMP is a distributed-management protocol. A system can operate exclusively as either an 
NMS or an agent, or it can perform the functions of both. When a system operates as both an 
NMS and an agent, another NMS might require that the system query managed devices and 
provide a summary of the information learned, or that it report locally stored management 
information.
SNMP Security
SNMP lacks any authentication capabilities, which results in vulnerability to a variety of 
security threats. These include masquerading, modiﬁcation of information, message sequence 
and timing modiﬁcations, and disclosure. Masquerading consists of an unauthorized entity 
attempting to perform management operations by assuming the identity of an authorized 
management entity. Modiﬁcation of information involves an unauthorized entity attempting to 
alter a message generated by an authorized entity so that the message results in unauthorized 
accounting management or conﬁguration management operations. Message sequence and 

Network Management     261
timing modiﬁcations occur when an unauthorized entity reorders, delays, or copies and later 
replays a message generated by an authorized entity. Disclosure results when an unauthorized 
entity extracts values stored in managed objects, or learns of notiﬁable events by monitoring 
exchanges between managers and agents. Because SNMP does not implement authentication, 
many vendors do not implement Set operations, thereby reducing SNMP to a monitoring 
facility.
SNMP Interoperability
As presently speciﬁed, SNMPv2 is incompatible with SNMPv1 in two key areas: message 
formats and protocol operations. SNMPv2 messages use different header and protocol data-unit 
(PDU) formats than SNMPv1 messages. SNMPv2 also uses two protocol operations that are 
not speciﬁed in SNMPv1. Furthermore, RFC 1908 deﬁnes two possible SNMPv1/v2 
coexistence strategies: proxy agents and “bilingual” network-management systems.
Proxy Agents
An SNMPv2 agent can act as a proxy agent on behalf of SNMPv1 managed devices, as follows:
•
An SNMPv2 NMS issues a command intended for an SNMPv1 agent.
•
The NMS sends the SNMP message to the SNMPv2 proxy agent.
•
The proxy agent forwards Get, GetNext, and Set messages to the SNMPv1 agent 
unchanged.
•
GetBulk messages are converted by the proxy agent to GetNext messages and then are 
forwarded to the SNMPv1 agent.
•
The proxy agent maps SNMPv1 trap messages to SNMPv2 trap messages and then 
forwards them to the NMS.
Bilingual Network-Management System
Bilingual SNMPv2 network-management systems support both SNMPv1 and SNMPv2. To 
support this dual-management environment, a management application in the bilingual NMS 
must contact an agent. The NMS then examines information stored in a local database to 
determine whether the agent supports SNMPv1 or SNMPv2. Based on the information in the 
database, the NMS communicates with the agent using the appropriate version of SNMP.

SNMP Reference: SNMPv1 Message Formats
SNMPv1 messages contain two parts: a message header and a protocol data unit. Figure 7-4 
illustrates the basic format of an SNMPv1 message.

SNMPv1 Message Header
SNMPv1 message headers contain two ﬁelds: Version Number and Community Name. The

Version Number—Speciﬁes the version of SNMP used.
•
Community Name—Deﬁnes an access environment for a group of NMSs. NMSs within the 
community are said to exist within the same administrative domain. Community names 
serve as a weak form of authentication because devices that do not know the proper 
community name are precluded from SNMP operations.
SNMPv1 Protocol Data Unit  
SNMPv1 PDUs contain a speciﬁc command (Get, Set, and so on) and operands that indicate 
the object instances involved in the transaction. SNMPv1 PDU ﬁelds are variable in length, as 
prescribed by ASN.1. Figure 7-5 illustrates the ﬁelds of the SNMPv1 Get, GetNext, Response, 
and Set PDUs transactions.

CiscoWorks Blue
The CiscoWorks Blue suite of products is designed to simplify management of a consolidated 
Systems Network Architecture (SNA) and IP network. 
Because many enterprises still manage their SNA networks with NetView or 
SOLVE:Netmaster, the Cisco IOS software includes support for native service point, which 
allows the Cisco routers to send alerts and to receive commands from a mainframe management 
application. Working with Cisco IOS, CiscoWorks Blue Internetwork Status Monitor enables 
router monitoring, reporting, and even conﬁguration from a mainframe console. 
In addition to host-based management tools, Cisco offers SNMP-based management with 
CiscoWorks Blue Maps and SNA View. These tools are ideal for managing a consolidated IP 
and SNA network. With one console, you can view, activate, and deactivate SNA devices 
(physical and logical units) and understand how they are connected to mainframe applications 
over a router backbone. Color-coding and the capability to drill down to the data link layer 
enable rapid problem isolation and resolution. 
To ensure that service levels are met, Cisco offers CiscoWorks Blue Internetwork Performance 
Monitor, which monitors network response time on a hop-by-hop basis for both SNA and IP 
trafﬁc and provides historical reporting, as well as real-time indications of problems.

Netsys Connectivity Tools
The Netsys Connectivity Service Manager enables you to view, assess, and troubleshoot a full 
spectrum of connectivity issues, including network availability, security, and reliability. It 
monitors the actual network conﬁguration data and uses built-in intelligence to verify the 
availability of key network services. It also enables you to establish service-level policies for 
connectivity, reliability, and security services, and it uses the unique VISTA (view, isolate, 
solve, test, apply) troubleshooting methodology to automate the diagnosis and repair of 
problems. 

Network Management     269
As a result, you can begin to focus more on strategic network issues, such as growth and 
capacity planning, and less on solving the network crisis of the moment. The Connectivity 
Service Manager dramatically increases the productivity of network and system administrators, 
thereby reducing overall network management costs.
The Connectivity Service Manager collects actual router conﬁguration data and creates 
multiprotocol topologies so that you can visually navigate your network and gain a complete 
understanding of how it works. The topologies are drawn automatically, so you do not have to 
spend hours manually linking interfaces and grouping objects. All physical and logical 
relationships between routers and LAN switches are represented, so you focus on solving 
problems, not drawing pictures. You can also generate views such as campus, virtual ring group, 
and OSPF areas in an instant.
All multiprotocol topologies support the following:
•
Visual queries, exposing devices running combinations of network or routing protocols
•
Pop-up menus, accessing conﬁguration information on each LAN, link, router, and circuit
•
Graphical views of routing table coverage
•
Graphical displays of round-trip paths between end systems
Netsys Performance Tools
The Netsys Performance Service Manager complements the capabilities of the Netsys 
Connectivity Service Manager, enabling you to deﬁne, monitor, and optimize performance 
service levels to make the most efﬁcient use of existing network resources; to diagnose and 
solve network performance problems; to tune existing networks; and to plan network changes. 
This product is the only Cisco-certiﬁed performance-modeling application on the market. By 
providing accurate modeling of routing and ﬂow transport over Cisco devices, you can analyze 
interactions among trafﬁc ﬂows, topologies, routing parameters, router conﬁgurations, and 
Cisco IOS software features.
Working interactively with the Performance Service Manager, you can ensure that service-level 
policies are being met, that performance problems are being solved, and that WAN costs are 
reduced through resource optimization. This scenario positions your company to meet future 
equipment and protocol migration plans and application performance requirements.
Performance Baseline
The performance baseline quickly provides a snapshot of current performance and load levels 
reported by router MIBs in critical areas of your network. MIB information includes interface 
summary and protocol statistics, buffer hits and misses, and CPU utilization. You can easily 
schedule MIB data collection, deﬁning how often and at what intervals data samples should be 
gathered.

270     Chapter 7: The Design Document and Cisco Network Management Applications
From this baseline, you can quickly determine overloaded or underutilized network resources 
and grasp general performance and loading trends. In addition, you can determine where it is 
safe to activate IP/IPX accounting or NetFlow switching and guide your placement of RMON 
agents for maximum coverage with the least impact. Where collection of end-to-end trafﬁc data 
is difﬁcult, interface statistics can also be used as a supplement.
End-to-End Trafﬁc Baseline
The Performance Service Manager provides an accurate representation of the application-layer 
trafﬁc ﬂows between communicating subnets or host pairs. Using the end-to-end trafﬁc baseline 
in combination with performance analysis enables you to better use existing resources and to 
more effectively plan network growth. 
The Performance Service Manager can be easily scheduled to collect end-to-end trafﬁc 
matrices from either Cisco router accounting or NetFlow data, or RMON data from Network 
General, Frontier NetScout, and Hewlett-Packard NetMetrix agents. You can also create your 
own trafﬁc proﬁles to model the impact of new applications and users on your network. With 
this information, you can view and understand your network trafﬁc ﬂows and network-wide 
application breakdowns, and you can identify the volume of trafﬁc through key devices and 
links or to and from remote networks or hosts.
Netsys Baseliner for Windows NT
Netsys Baseliner for Windows NT displays, debugs, and validates your network conﬁguration. 
Netsys Baseliner for Windows NT enables you to do the following:
•
Test conﬁgurations and changes ofﬂine, before committing them to the live network. 
Cisco Netsys Baseliner for Windows NT creates a model of your network and checks for 
conﬁguration problems. 
•
Graphically view your network as conﬁgured, not as planned or discovered. It enables you 
to visually navigate the network and to gain a complete understanding of how it works. 
•
Proactively monitor conﬁguration changes. When problems occur, recent conﬁguration 
changes are often to blame.

mobility, and tracking. 
Other Network Management and Troubleshooting Tools
Other tools also are used to troubleshoot networks. The tools discussed in this section are not 
SNMP-based.
Protocol Analyzers
Protocol analyzers are devices that are placed on the network to monitor network trafﬁc in a 
problem area. These devices are not SNMP-based; rather, they are placed in a problem area to 
monitor every frame or a ﬁltered subset that is forwarded on the network. These devices gather 
information from Layer 2 up to application information. The devices are placed on SPAN ports 
on Cisco switches. The SPAN port is used to monitor the trafﬁc of a certain port on the switch—
for example, the port with a server connected to it. Microsoft NT includes the Network Monitor 
application that is a protocol analyzer; Network Associates Sniffer also is a very popular 
product.
Cable Testers
Cable testers are used to troubleshoot physical-layer problems. Issues include the wiring of

31
Describe how to demonstrate the prototype or pilot to the customer so 
that the customer understands that the proposed design meets 
requirements for performance, security, capacity, and scalability, and 
accepts the costs and risks.

C H A P T E R 8
Building a Prototype or Pilot
The last step in creating a successful design solution is demonstrating to the customer how 
your design solution meets that customer’s needs for performance, security, capacity, and 
scalability.
This chapter concentrates on methods used to ﬁnalize the customer’s acceptance of the 
design. Often the designs proposed are complex and have many different components that 
must be brought together to build a complete solution. Usually a more complex design 
means a greater cost to the customer. Therefore, it is important that the consultant provide 
sound proof to the customer that the proposed design will meet the customer’s needs.
Two methods demonstrate to the customer how the proposed design will solve that 
customer’s network needs. The ﬁrst method is to build a prototype, which is used for large-
scale designs. The second is to construct a pilot, which is a smaller and less complicated 
version of the prototype that is ideal for smaller designs. This chapter covers the criteria that 
will help you choose the right testing method and then details the steps involved in 
implementing each method.
“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz
The questions in the following quiz are designed to help you gauge how well you know the 
material covered in this chapter. Compare your answers with those found in Appendix A, 
“Answers to Quiz Questions.” If you answered most or all of the questions thoroughly and 
correctly, you might want to skim the chapter and proceed to the “Q&A” and “Case Study”

Foundation Topics
Determining the Appropriate Test Plan
The following CCDA objectives are covered in this section:
A prototype is a complex and full trial run of the network design used to prove that the design 
works. A prototype is usually a large-scale, fully functional form of a new design and thus is 
used to prove a large implementation. The customer would have to decide whether the need to 
prove the design justiﬁes the cost of setting up a prototype. If the prototype is not appropriate 
for your customer, you might consider recommending a pilot, which is a smaller test designed 
for smaller businesses. The pilot usually tests more basic functions of the design, and it also 
usually requires less time and fewer resources. The criteria for choosing either test plan involves 
comparing the cost of the test against the need to prove that the design works. Table 8-1 
summarizes this criteria for choosing the pilot or the prototype. 
After you have determined the customer’s testing needs, you must perform the appropriate steps 
for creating a pilot or a prototype. Depending on your choice, see “Steps for Building a 
Prototype” or “Steps for Creating a Pilot,” later in this chapter.

 Steps for Building a Prototype
The following CCDA objectives are covered in this section:
This section covers the process of building a successful prototype. The prototype can be a fully 
functional test either of a portion of the network or of the entire network. Therefore, as with the 
design of the network, the design of the prototype demands careful planning to maximize its 
effectiveness. The success of the prototype could help determine whether the customer will 
accept the project. To study for the exam, remember the steps involved in building each type of 
test. Remember that the purpose of both the prototype and the pilot is to validate your design to 
a customer.
Table 8-2 shows the steps for building a prototype. Each of these steps is covered in detail in 
the rest of this section.

Step 1: Review the Customer’s Requirements
Having a clear goal for building your prototype is essential. In fact, the prototype design should 
be created using the same approach you used to determine customer requirements for the 
original design. Refer back to Chapter 2, “Assessing the Existing Network and Identifying 
Customer Objectives,” if you need to review the list of requirements.
Step 4: Develop a test plan.
Draw a network diagram.
List tools for the test.
List the plan scheduling, resources, and milestones.
Prepare the demonstrations.
Determine how each test will prove that the design meets 
the customer’s requirements.
Identify how the design shows Cisco’s strengths.
Determine how each test will show that the competitor’s 
products do not provide the ideal solution.
Step 5: Purchase and prepare equipment.
Some or all of following equipment must be acquired and 
prepared:
Network simulation tools

Step
Description

Steps for Building a Prototype     289
First, list the customer’s major goals. Then identify the customer’s requirements for 
performance, security, capacity, and scalability. Also consider other customer requirements 
such as return on investment (ROI) issues, management of the new network, equipment reuse, 
and cost of implementing the prototype test.
You also should determine what speciﬁc advantages for the customer you can illustrate with the 
prototype. These ideas should be well planned to ensure that the prototype is complete and 
serves as a useful vehicle to demonstrate these points.
Just as it is important to list the good ideas, you also want to be ready for any problems or issues 
that might negatively affect the success of the project. Take the time to list the cons to the 
prototype so that you are ready to address them as well. 
Step 2: Determine the Extent of the Prototype
Creating the right size prototype is critical. You must determine how much of the design is 
necessary to be included in the prototype to meet the customer’s expectations. The scope of 
your prototype is a factor that you and your customer must agree on before work can begin. Cost 
and the purpose of the prototype will often determine the size of the demonstration. For 
example, if one of the customer’s primary concerns is time, that customer might request that 
you focus your test on a speciﬁc problem. The customer might need to roll out your design in 
multiple locations and thus might be willing to implement a full prototype in one of the 
company’s many locations.
For the exam, it is important to remember that the customer’s goals are the deciding factor in 
determining how much of the network design should be implemented to prove its value to the 
customer. When proving the effectiveness of your design, you can use tools and investigative 
services to simplify the development of the prototype by simulating some of the equipment and 
their effect on the network. 
These simulations generally remove the need to purchase, install, and conﬁgure actual 
equipment to make the task of creating the prototype less costly. One of the tools mentioned in 
the exam is Network General’s Sniffer network analyzer. A network analyzer can be used to 
simulate trafﬁc and also works as a tool to prove the effectiveness of the network design. 
Third-party industry tests also sometimes are done on competing products, and you can use 
these tests and their results to prove your design without building a test yourself. An example 
of one of these tests is the Strategic Networks Consulting, Inc. (SNCI) switch test, available 
from SNCI’s Web site. This test was done on Cisco’s Catalyst 5000 switches and Cabletron’s 
MMAC-Plus switches. Go to SNCI’s Web site at www.zdnet.com/zdtag/snci/ to review the test 
and other similar comparisons. 

290     Chapter 8: Building a Prototype or Pilot
Step 3: Understand Your Competition
For a large design that requires a prototype, the customer probably is considering other designs 
as well. It is important to plan this particular prototype to highlight the advantages that your 
design can offer above the competition. Working with the account manager and sales team can 
help you ﬁnd out about the competition’s design. Taking the time to gather as much information 
on what the competition will propose is always a good way to double-check your own design 
and to make sure that you didn’t miss a point. 
If it isn’t possible to get information on the competition, try to make some assumptions on what 
they would propose to meet the customer’s requirements by referencing information from the 
client’s Web site or product descriptions. You can make a comparison list of features based on 
the client’s requirements, or draw up a list of pros and cons about the competition’s products. 
Then use this information to build your strategy.
Step 4: Develop a Test Plan
Now that you have prepared to create the prototype, the next step is to create the test plan that 
will be used on the prototype. The best tool available to a designer is a topology map of the 
prototype test network. This one diagram can be used to view the entire network and can be the 
single most important document of a prototype. On this diagram, you can include major 
conﬁguration parameters such as network speeds, topology information, WAN line speeds, and 
descriptions of speciﬁc network devices, such as ﬁrewalls.
Figure 8-1 shows a topology map of a sample network design. Notice that only the marked 
region of this proposed design will be the subject of the actual prototype test.
A topology map of the test environment proves invaluable. The prototype topology map can 
include a list of simulation tools, Cisco hardware and software, and non-Cisco hardware and 
software you will need for the prototype. Some of the non-Cisco hardware you might want to 
make use of include cables, modems, null modems, WAN connections, Internet access, 
workstations, servers, design simulation tools, telephone equipment simulators, and so on. 
While compiling a list of the resources you will need, it is important also to list and plan the 
tests that you will perform on the prototype network. The test plan should reﬂect the goals you 
decided upon when the design for the prototype was created: Remember that these goals were 
designed to meet the customer’s needs.  
Performing a demonstration for the client might be complicated and might require the 
involvement of multiple people to ensure its success. If you require help from coworkers or 
collaboration from the customer’s staff, remember to request the help with ample time to 
coordinate your resources. To make sure that everyone understands what to do for the test, be 
sure to develop and review a script.

Table 8-3 shows a table included in a script that maps out the roles and responsibilities of the 
people involved in the presentation. By clearly deﬁning this type of information, people are 
better prepared to contribute to the success of the presentation.
The script should be tested ahead of time either at the Cisco lab or the customer’s lab. 
Preparation only reinforces the testing, which in turn shows your customer that your team is 
coordinated and professional and also may point out any unforeseen problems that must be 
resolved before you present the ﬁnal product to the customer.
Finally, the test should highlight the strengths of the Cisco product and point out how the 
competitor’s product would not prove as useful. Remember to review the test plan to avoid 
possible issues that would arise later during the demonstration.  
Step 5: Purchase and Prepare Equipment
Remember that it is important to prepare for the prototype demonstration well in advance so 
that you can purchase and conﬁgure the equipment with ample time. Because there are always 
instances in which equipment purchases can be delayed or other unforeseen problems can arise, 
the equipment should be gathered and conﬁgured as soon as a list is compiled. This list would 
include the following:
•
Network simulation tools 
•
Cisco hardware and software 
•
Non-Cisco hardware and software

Remember to prepare an inventory sheet to help you track of the products as they arrive. It’s 
also important to stage some of the equipment with basic testing. Staging is a method of setting 
up the equipment for basic conﬁguration and testing the hardware. This is a good time to 
develop an inventory to help you sort your equipment. Table 8-4 shows a sample staging and 
inventory chart.
Step 6: Practice
Performing the demonstration for the client will be a complex task. It’s important to practice 
with the members of your team to coordinate your presentation—this is especially important if 
you are going to demonstrate the equipment. You want to make sure that your demonstration 
doesn’t have any small surprises that would adversely affect your success. Make sure that you 
give yourself ample time, and practice several times.
Step 7: Conduct Final Tests and Demonstrations
This ﬁnal step will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter in the section “Testing the 
Prototype or Pilot.” That section outlines some basic tools that you can use to make your 
demonstrations more effective.
The steps for developing and implementing a prototype will help you prove your design. The 
next section shows how to develop a pilot program. As you read through the next section, note 
the differences in the steps and the execution of testing via pilot versus testing via prototype.

294     Chapter 8: Building a Prototype or Pilot
Steps for Creating a Pilot
The following CCDA objectives are covered in this section:
Many of the same processes that apply to creating a prototype also apply to building a pilot. 
However, the main difference between the prototype and the pilot is that the pilot is a small 
demonstration of a basic feature. That makes a pilot an appropriate test for a small business or 
a network undergoing minimal design changes.  
Unlike the prototype, developing a pilot should not require as much effort because of the 
smaller scale of the test. First, test the design to make sure that it meets the client’s 
requirements. Then review the competition’s proposal so that you can address any issues the 
client might have. This again gives you the opportunity to review the pilot to make sure that you 
have not missed any points you need to highlight.  
After you have planned the pilot, draw up a well-practiced script to ensure a smooth 
presentation of the pilot. Finally, schedule time with the customer to present the demonstration 
when you are ready. The following list summarizes the steps involved in creating a pilot:
•
Step 1: Test the design.
•
Step 2: Review the competition’s proposal.
•
Step 3: Script the demonstration.
•
Step 4: Practice.
•
Step 5: Schedule time and present the demonstration to the customer.
The remainder of this section covers these steps in detail.
Step 1: Test the Design
When testing the design, make sure that you have clear objectives for the testing based on the 
customer’s request and requirements. It will be beneﬁcial to review the customer’s requirements 
before engaging in the pilot so that you can ensure that your tests will be effective. For more 
information on how to test a pilot, see the section “Testing the Prototype or Pilot,” later in this 
chapter.

number of users, peak usage hours, security, and network management.

List the tasks required to build a prototype or pilot that demonstrates the 
functionality of the network design.

Testing the Prototype or Pilot     295
Step 2: Review the Competition’s Proposal
This step of the pilot is the same as Step 3 of prototype testing. This is important because your 
demonstration should point out the beneﬁts of your design over the competition’s. By 
understanding your competition’s proposal, you will be able to address any questions that the 
client asks related to the competition’s products and features.
Step 3: Script the Demonstration
This essential step will help you incorporate all the aspects of the project, including the design, 
project management, and implementation. You will want to highlight the following:
•
Verify that the tests will prove that the proposed solution meets the client’s requirements
•
Review the strengths and beneﬁts of the Cisco products
•
Demonstrate where the competition falls short
Step 4: Practice
Be sure to practice, practice, practice. Rehearsing the presentation gives you the opportunity to 
coordinate all the different components involved, including the people, resources, and results 
you want to demonstrate. This will ensure a smooth presentation without any surprises.
Step 5: Schedule Time and Present the Demonstration to the Customer
The last step is the scheduling of the demonstration. Remember that if you use any devices 
(such as laptops) and presentation materials (such as projectors), you should set them up well 
ahead of time.
Now that you understand the differences between the processes of developing the pilot and the 
prototype, the next section covers the testing process. This process highlights some tools you 
might use to improve your design and show that your design meets the client’s needs.
Testing the Prototype or Pilot
The following CCDA objectives are covered in this section:
30
List the Cisco IOS software commands you should use to determine whether 
a network structure meets the customer’s performance and scalability goals.
31
Describe how to demonstrate the prototype or pilot to the customer so that 
the customer understands that the proposed design meets requirements for 
performance, security, capacity, and scalability, and accepts the costs and 
risks.

296     Chapter 8: Building a Prototype or Pilot
After conﬁguring and setting up the prototype or pilot, you can use three types of tools to prove 
that your test meets the customer’s requirements:
•
Cisco IOS software commands
•
Protocol analyzer
•
Simulation tools
Besides using these tools to test your design, you also can use them to demonstrate your results 
to the customer. The remainder of this section covers these testing tools and shows how you can 
demonstrate your results.
When proving your design to a customer during the testing phase, it is important to consider 
both the cost and the practicality of the tools you will use. Good planning, including clearly 
deﬁned objectives for your prototype testing and efﬁcient resources, makes up the right formula 
for creating a successful test environment.
When trying to prove the functionality of a network, it is more cost effective to use tools that 
will generate a simulation of the type of trafﬁc on a live network instead of purchasing the actual 
equipment. Protocol analyzers and simulation tools help you create the necessary environment 
as well as capture and present data. 
Network management is evolving as quickly as the networks themselves. A common network 
management tool such as a probe, a device placed at a key point in the network, gathers and 
analyzes trafﬁc using remote monitoring (RMON). This speciﬁcation deﬁned in RFC 1271 
(Ethernet) is also supported on the Cisco Catalyst class switches and is used for trafﬁc analysis 
on switched LAN networks as well as T1 WAN links. To read more on the uses of RMON for 
trafﬁc analysis, refer to the white paper from Cisco at www.cisco.com/warp/public/614/4.html.
Using Cisco IOS Commands to Test the Prototype or Pilot
Table 8-5 lists the recommended IOS commands and the results they would yield. These are 
only a subset of the Cisco IOS commands that are available; for a full listing of Cisco IOS 
commands, refer to the CCO Web site or the Cisco Documentation CD-ROM.

Using Protocol Analyzers
Protocol analyzers are ﬂexible tools that provide a wide range of data collection and trafﬁc 
analysis methods. These are some examples of protocol analyzers and the Web sites that contain 
more information on them:
•
Network Associate’s Sniffer Suite of Products—www.nai.com/asp_set/products/tnv/
tnv_literature.asp
•
Network Instruments’ NetSense for Observer—www.netinst.com/html/
netsense_for_observer.html
•
RADCOM’s LAN, WAN, and ATM analyzers—www.radcom-inc.com/
This is just a tiny fraction of the protocol analyzers available. As with many technologies, you 
must assess the functionality by asking some questions to determine how to choose the right 
product. The following questions can help you select the right protocol analyzer:
•
What type of environment will the protocol analyzer need to function in? LAN, WAN, 
ATM, switched networks, 100 Mb Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, T1?
•
What type of protocols does it need to understand? IP, IPX/SPX, SNA, NetBEUI, Banyan 
Vines, AppleTalk?
•
What type of network management protocols does it need to support? SNMP, RMON, 
RMON2?
•
What type of information do you want to collect? Network utilization, protocol analysis, 
latency, jitter?
•
What other products need to get this information? Does this involve other network 
management tools, such as HP Openview, CiscoWorks, Catalyst switches?

Using these questions can help you to determine what type of functionality is needed in your 
protocol analyzer tools.
The following are some basic steps to take when using a protocol analyzer:
•
Conﬁgure for the correct LAN and WAN media
•
Capture data
•
Test the prototype or pilot
•
Demonstrate security
Table 8-6 describes these steps in more detail.
Simulation Tools
Simulation tools need to be compatible with the components necessary to affect the 
performance of a network. Think of all the components necessary to create a simulation of a 
network—the protocols, other vendor devices, the topology, application utilization on a 
network that ﬂuctuates depending on time of day, and so on. Different simulation tools also test 
Table 8-6

Description
Conﬁgure for the correct LAN and WAN 
media.
Identify the correct media you are attaching.
For WAN links, this includes leased lines, Frame 
Relay, HDLC, X.25, ATM, and ISDN.
For LAN links, this includes 10 Mbps Ethernet, 100 
Mbps Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, 4 Mbps Token 
Ring, and 16 Mbps Token Ring.
Capture data.
Deﬁne the criteria for capturing data:
• Identify how many days’ worth of data will give 
you the accurate information. Make sure that you 
capture data for at least one day.
• Identify errors and irregularities.
• Check network utilization.
• Refer to the network health list presented in the 
section “Step 12: Summarize the Health of the 
Existing Network,” in Chapter 2.
Test the prototype or pilot.
Generate trafﬁc that replicates the customer’s desired 
network.
Demonstrate security.
You can prove the security of your access lists by 
showing whether the trafﬁc passes through your 
ﬁlters.

the functionality of critical devices on the network, such as a ﬁrewall. This type of simulation 
tool mimics different types of network attacks on a ﬁrewall or network servers to test its 
vulnerability.
The following are just a few links to simulation tool vendors. You will need to identify your 
testing needs to determine the correct product:
•

www.makesys.com/
•
Internet Security Systems’ SAFESuite products for network vulnerability testing—
www.iss.net/
Demonstrating Your Findings to the Customer
After completing the tests, you need to provide proof of the results to the customer. The 
following are some tips to help you present the information.
•
Publish your ﬁndings in a concise but comprehensive report. This report should have an 
organized method demonstrating how you came to your conclusions. Make sure to focus 
your work on the customer requirements. Include your diagrams and some of the raw data 
you have collected.
•
Add the results of your test to the network design document or response to an RFP. For 
more information on writing a design document, refer to Chapter 7, “The Design 
Document and Cisco Network Management Applications.”
•
Create slides that graphically demonstrate the correlation between your test results and the 
customer’s requirements. This should be done by examining the data you collected during 
your testing.
•
Meet with the customer to present your ﬁndings. Be prepared to use different presentation 
methods to make the meeting more effective.
•
Meet with the customer and reproduce your tests while the customer is watching. Do this 
only after you have had an opportunity to practice and replicate the results. 
Conclusion
This chapter concludes the coverage of the CCDA exam objectives. The next chapter provides 
you with some additional case studies and questions for you to further assess your mastery of 
the CCDA exam objectives. You can also use the extensive assessment tools on the CD-ROM 
to take an entire practice CCDA exam or to test yourself on speciﬁc objectives. If you identify 
any objectives in which you are not completely proﬁcient, use this book’s objective cross-
references, the CD-ROM electronic text links, the book’s reference appendixes, and even 
Cisco’s Web site to help you brush up on that subject matter before you take the CCDA exam.

Case Study #3: MediBill Services, Inc.
1 Draw a topology map of the existing MediBill Services, Inc., network and a topology map 
of the proposed new network. Include in the proposed network the trafﬁc ﬂow of the 
e-mail system.
During your demonstration, you will present the client with a topology 
map of the existing network. Figure 8-2 shows a topology map of the 
existing network.
Figure 8-3 shows a topology map of the new network, including the 
trafﬁc ﬂow of the e-mail system.
2 What type of routed protocol will be used across the WAN to MediBill’s customers?
The only routed protocol necessary is IP because all of MediBill’s 
applications, including PC network management, are IP-compliant. 
The client’s only other type of trafﬁc will be Internet trafﬁc, which is 
also IP-based. Many companies are looking to simplify their network 
by standardizing to one protocol.
3 What are the two main areas of management concern for the client based on its 
requirements?
Security management and network management
4 In your design, what type of testing would you recommend for this customer?
Mr. Lee wants a demonstration of the security that will be 
implemented. Considering that certain sites can receive Internet 
services, a pilot is the best solution. Mr. Lee needs to see a 
demonstration of the security only. The test can be conducted on a 
subset of the existing environment to test basic connectivity and 
security. This is particularly true because the remote doctor ofﬁces will 
be duplicates of the same design.

— E-mail system (Exchange/Outlook)
6 What tool would you use during the pilot demonstration to show the effectiveness of the 
security solution?
You should use a protocol analyzer, such as Network Associate’s 
Sniffer, which will demonstrate whether these packets are passing 
through the router or ﬁrewall to the other network. The Sniffer can 
also generate trafﬁc such as pings to test an access list rule.

Case Study #1: Cicala and Rosado Law Firm
Mr. Kunkel, the IT manager at Cicala and Rosado Law Firm, is responsible for updating the 
network to use new technologies. He has two network analysts working for him that handle 
the routers, hubs, clients, servers, and media for the company. The company is understaffed, 
and the analysts are overworked. There is no network management station monitoring the 
network.
The ﬁrm has two locations, one in Houston and one in Dallas, specializing in corporation 
legalities. A Frame Relay WAN link exists between the sites. Each ofﬁce has approximately 
40 workstations. The company expects only 4 percent network trafﬁc growth in the next two 
years. 
The current network was built in the early 1990s. Each ofﬁce has a large 10BaseT 
concentrator with stations attached. A router in Houston provides connectivity to the Dallas 
ofﬁce and to the Internet via a local ISP. The current routing protocol is RIP. The WAN link 
currently has a 256k bit rate and runs at an average of 85 percent utilization with occasional 
bursts. The Ethernet segments currently run at an average 45 percent utilization; 
occasionally, network utilization will burst to 60 percent utilization. Users complain of 
slow response time through the day.
The ﬁrm uses the Microsoft Ofﬁce suite of applications because it does a lot of word 
processing and exchanging documents. E-mail and HTTP are highly used as well. The ﬁrm 
also uses CD-ROM servers for reference. IP is the only protocol routed on the network.

314     Chapter 9: Additional Case Studies
The ﬁrm recently upgraded its work stations and is now equipped with 10/100 network interface 
cards. Mr. Kunkel would like a proposal to upgrade the network to Fast Ethernet. He would also 
like a solution to integrate voice and data on the WAN link between Dallas and Houston. Mr. 
Kunkel mentioned that a previous network audit uncovered security issues from access to the 
Internet.

Case Study #2: Big Oil and Gas
Mr. Abbott is an IT manager at Big Oil and Gas. He is in charge of the network infrastructure, 
including routers and switches. Mr. Abbott’s group includes personnel that can install and 
conﬁgure Cisco routers and switches. Another group manages the servers. The company 
currently has a Unix server with HP OpenView.
Big Oil and Gas is a medium-sized petrochemical company based in Houston. It also has 
operations in the Gulf and in South America. 
The network includes more than 30 routers. Mr. Abbott hands you the diagram displayed in 
Figure 9-1, which describes the topology of the network. Although the average utilization is 
around 50 percent, some WAN segments are experiencing utilization peaks of 72 percent. 
All LAN segments are under 20 percent utilization. 
Unix servers run SAP business applications, and Novell servers are used for ofﬁce suite 
applications. IPX is routed throughout the network.
Mr. Abbott would like a solution to reduce the IPX SAP trafﬁc on the WAN. He also would like 
a network management solution to better manage the router conﬁgurations.

Case Study #3: CartoonWorks, Inc.
CartoonWorks, Inc., is a graphical ﬁrm specializing in animation for the advertisement and 
entertainment industries. This ﬁrm is growing quickly and needs to remain competitive. The 
ﬁrm just completed a strategy meeting to decide how each department can contribute to create 
a corporation that will give the company an edge in the market.
Ms. Roberts, the Director of IS for CartoonWorks, Inc., is responsible for all LAN and WAN 
implementations. She has proposed networking CartoonWorks’ remote ofﬁces in an effort to 
capture and share the intellectual capital and to allow for easy communications between 
designers and artists to increase creativity and productivity.  
LAN
Internet

320     Chapter 9: Additional Case Studies
The company has always operated with independent ofﬁces. Ms. Roberts has hired you to help 
her come up with a cost-effective plan to start connecting the different ofﬁces and to help her 
create this network. Ms. Roberts is interested not only in the initial design, but also in a phased 
implementation plan so that she can budget correctly for this upgrade.
Currently, there are two main ofﬁces, each with anywhere from 70 to 100 Apple and PC 
workstations, making the total hosts of the two ofﬁces no more than 200. Each ofﬁce has one 
network segment. All administrative functions are located in CartoonWorks Main Street ofﬁce. 
The Human Resources, Accounting, and Corporate departments all share two Novell 4.11 ﬁle 
servers. The Administrative and IT users have only PCs, and the Production users have a mix 
of PCs and Macintosh computers. The third server is the primary NDS directory for user 
authentication and home directories.
However, the Marketing, Production, and IT departments occupy two ﬂoors in the Oak Street 
ofﬁce. Marketing and Production share two servers, and IT uses the secondary NDS server. The 
two ofﬁces are connected via a point-to-point T1 connection. Ms. Roberts has expressed 
concern about the redundancy for the line. All the graphical work is done on Apple computers, 
and the operations and administration work for the corporation is done on PCs. The network 
uses AppleTalk and IPX/SPX protocols. However, the new documentation management and 
chat room server that is designed to facilitate communication in a company is a Web-based 
product.
In addition, the company has been developing and testing its two new NT Web servers on the 
new Internet segment. These new Web servers need to communicate with the new NT SQL 
database at the Oak Street ofﬁce. The Media Group, which is part of the Production department, 
will complete its testing within one month. With the new Web servers, Ms. Roberts needs to 
also implement a DNS solution and register a domain name. Ms. Roberts has begun the process 
of acquiring a domain name in preparation for the Internet access, but she needs to install and 
secure her DNS servers.  
A new T1 Internet connection has been installed at the data center in the Oak Street ofﬁce, but 
CartoonWorks does not have a security policy and needs to install security. Everyone in the 
company will have Web access, and the company is concerned about the legal implications of 
using the Web. Ms. Roberts wants to make changes to the network as seamlessly as possible for 
her users. This is especially critical due to the lack of technical support staff and the recent 
implementation of critical applications, such as a GroupWare system. CartoonWorks migrated 
to Novell’s GroupWise from cc:Mail, but the company has not installed the Internet e-mail 
capability and has made that and security its ﬁrst concern.
CartoonWorks executives know that they need to upgrade their infrastructure to work more 
aggressively, but they cannot disrupt production to do so. Now that you have information on 
what Ms. Roberts is looking to implement, use the information to help her decide on the right 
solution. CartoonWorks is interested in a phased solution that will address its immediate needs 
for connectivity to the remote users and to include the NT e-mail system.

Case Study #4: Martin & Martin, LLC
Mr. Jones is the Director of IT at Martin & Martin, LLC., a law ﬁrm located in downtown 
Chicago. He is charged with the task of planning for a network upgrade. However, Mr. Jones 
has decided that he would like to have a network analysis done before the upgrade so that he 
can ﬁnd out which systems would require upgrades, and to create a three-year strategy to 
present to the partners. Mr. Jones is concerned about presenting the right strategy that will 
include the return on investment.
Martin & Martin has provided services to its clients for more than 10 years and is planning to 
open two new ofﬁces in the next six months. These ofﬁces will be across town, and each ofﬁce 
will have approximately 30 people. Each ofﬁce will have four senior attorneys and 10 junior 
attorneys, clerks, and administrative staff. To support these ofﬁces, the IT department has one 
support person for each remote location for desktop and level 1 support.

Case Study #4: Martin & Martin, LLC     323
The law ofﬁces occupy four ﬂoors of a high-rise building in Chicago. The customer is 
experiencing network latency, especially in the Accounting and Finance department and in 
the Human Resources department, which both reside on the 22nd ﬂoor. The director of the 
Accounting and Finance department has raised concerns about the security of his ﬁles. To 
address any further security concerns with other departments, Mr. Jones met with the directors 
of each department, except for the attorneys. The legal department includes Research and the 
attorneys. Research, IT, and the Corporate Administration departments share the 23rd ﬂoor. 
The senior and junior partners and all attorneys with their administrative support staff occupy 
the 25th ﬂoor, and the 26th ﬂoor is used for reception and conference rooms. The law ﬁrm has 
decided that video conferencing is an essential component of its business and is looking to 
implement video conferencing as soon as possible so that the original ﬁrm can communicate 
with the two new remote ofﬁces.
The customer has four network segments for each ﬂoor but has been experiencing network 
latency. Each ﬂoor except the 26th has 10 to 20 printers. Each ﬂoor has a 100 Mb uplink to the 
Data Center on the 23rd ﬂoor. There are approximately 50 PCs on the 26th ﬂoor, 150 PCs on 
the 25th ﬂoor, and 40 PCs on both the 22nd and 23rd ﬂoors. The servers for each department 
reside on their respective ﬂoors.
Martin & Martin currently uses Microsoft Ofﬁce applications and Exchange for mail. However, 
Martin & Martin is concerned about network security and wants a recommendation to secure 
the trafﬁc of three speciﬁc departments: Human Resources, Accounting and Finance, and 
Corporate Administration. Mr. Jones needs to provide Internet security for the entire 
corporation. However, due to the sensitivity of the information in these departments, Mr. Jones 
wants to secure each segment so that access will be strictly deﬁned. With the growth of the 
remote ofﬁces and a network audit in the near future, Mr. Jones wants to secure these networks. 
The senior partners are also considering the use of video and audio ﬁles in the Research 
department for reference. Mr. Jones is interested in a centralized IS management that can 
monitor devices and eventually grow to remote monitoring and proactive monitoring with the 
new ofﬁces. However, he is concerned that the new network would require a more experienced 
IS staff.
This is a critical decision for Mr. Jones to make because he needs to understand what trafﬁc 
patterns he should plan for. With the need for teleconferencing looming on the horizon for each 
of the ofﬁces, Mr. Jones needs to take into account additional WAN capacity in his plan. 
Mr. Jones has asked for a design proposal and an implementation plan for the network analysis.

3 What applications are being used?
Microsoft Ofﬁce suite applications, WWW and HTTP applications, and CD-ROM 
servers.
4 What would you recommend to alleviate the WAN utilization problem?
To overcome the utilization problems on the WAN link, upgrade the link to 256 Kbps 
and then monitor the utilization of the network.
5 What would you recommend to improve the LAN utilization problem? What switches 
could you use?
Because the clients have been equipped with 10/100 NIC, replace the 10 Mbps hubs 
with Fast Ethernet switches. The switches will also provide a separate collision 
domain to each device.
You could use two Cisco 2948 switches at each site, providing 96 ports for network 
devices.
6 What Cisco device could be used to provide protection from the Internet?
The Cisco PIX Firewall can be used to provide additional security from the Internet. 
The PIX Firewall provides stateful inspection of conversations and can be used for 
network address translation. 
7 What Cisco devices could be used to provide an integrated voice and data solution?
Cisco 3600 series routers provide a Voice over IP solution.
8 Would you suggest a full CiscoWorks 2000 solution with HP OpenView on a Unix 
workstation to Mr. Kunkel?
Because Mr. Kunkel’s staff is already overworked, learning new Unix skills might 
not be an option. They already run NT servers, so recommend CiscoWorks for 
Windows as a network management solution.
9 The ﬁrm’s network is small. Would you propose a pilot or a prototype to demonstrate the 
VoIP solution?
Because this is a small network with only two sites, recommend a pilot 
demonstration.

Case Study #1 Answers: Cicala and Rosado Law Firm     327
What routing protocol would you recommend, and how would you change the addressing 
scheme?
You should recommend using a routing protocol that can do VLSMs. Possible 
options are RIPv2, OSPF, and Enhanced IGRP. Because both routers are Cisco, 
Enhanced IGRP would be most efﬁcient. You need to place the power users with the 
CD-ROM servers onto another segment.

1 What possible solutions can be used to reduce SAP trafﬁc over the WAN?
Possible solutions include the following:
— Access lists could be used to control the broadcasted SAPs. 
— Enhanced IGRP could be used to route IPX over the WAN.
— NLSP could be used to route IPX.
2 If the remote locations need to see only four corporate ﬁle servers, what type of ﬁlter can 
be used?
An IPX SAP ﬁlter (range 1000 to 1099) should be used on outbound WAN links to 
permit the list of servers.
3 What network management application would you recommend for router conﬁguration 
tracking and hardware inventory management?
CiscoWorks can be used to track router conﬁgurations and inventory. CiscoWorks 
also can be used to make changes to routers and for viewing logs.
4 Are there any protocols that cannot be routed on this network?
Big Oil and Gas uses IP and IPX; both are routable protocols.
5 What does the diagram in Figure 9-2 describe?
It describes the ﬂow of SAP broadcasts.
6 Do you see any utilization problems with the LAN segments?
No. The Ethernet segments are still under the recommended maximum utilization.

Case Study #3 Answers: CartoonWorks, Inc.
1 List the new applications that the customer wants to implement in the network.
Video conferencing
Novell Internet e-mail system
Web servers
SQL database
DNS Server
2 Draw a logical diagram of the existing network.
The customer deﬁned the network by describing the geographical locations and the 
services that the network provides its users. The logical diagram in Figure 9-6 is 
based on those services.
3 What type of WAN technology would you recommend as a redundant solution for the T1 
between CartoonWorks ofﬁces?
Suggest an ISDN dial-up connection to begin with until it is determined that the 
client has a higher than 256K backup solution. This would require an assessment of 
the trafﬁc and bandwidth utilization on the T1. However, the ISDN equipment and 
line are both cost-effective and can be implemented quickly. 
4 What CartoonWorks services depend on the DNS server in this network?
The e-mail system depends on the DNS server because it requires a mail exchange 
record for Internet mail services. Web servers depend on the DNS server for name 
resolution. Web browsers also depend on the DNS server for name resolution.
5 If the client were given a valid address of 199.199.199.32 with a mask of 255.255.255.224 
from its ISP, what solution would you recommend to give all CartoonWorks’ users access 
to the Internet?
CartoonWorks plans to give Internet access to all its 200-plus users. The address 
range that the ISP had provided is not sufﬁcient for the company’s network size, 
so it needs to use Network Address Translation (NAT).

Case Study #4 Answers: Martin and Martin, LLC     331
6 During the process of characterizing the network, you have found the following:
— Broadcasts are 17 percent of total trafﬁc.
— There are 100 mixed-media workstations.
— Utilization on the segment is at 30 percent.
What would you recommend to the customer to improve the performance on this 
network?
Segmenting the ﬂat network would be recommended based on the ﬁndings. The 
threshold for broadcasts is that broadcasts should be less than 20 percent of the total 
trafﬁc. This means that a Layer 3 segmentation needs to occur to isolate the 
broadcast trafﬁc. Therefore, a recommendation for creating VLANs with Catalyst 
switches would provide the Layer 3 segmentation and also reduce collision domains.
7 What are the routed protocols used in this network?
IPX, AppleTalk, and IP
8 What would you recommend to use as routed protocols in the new network, and why?
The client will need to implement IP to support the NT applications and the Web-
based applications. However, the customer does not describe any plans to change the 
graphical or ﬁle systems. Therefore, the network would also include IPX and 
AppleTalk.
9 Which routing protocol can be used to support all the routed protocols of the new 
network?
Because the new network includes IP, IPX, and AppleTalk, the recommendation 
should be for using Enhanced IGRP. Enhanced IGRP supports all the above-
mentioned routed protocols.
Case Study #4 Answers: Martin and Martin, LLC
1 Draw the corporate structure of this client.
Figure 9-7 explains the corporate structure of Martin & Martin, LLC. The diagram 
shows that there are two main divisions, which are the corporate functions and the 
legal departments. The chart reﬂects only information that is speciﬁcally stated.
2 What type of testing program would you recommend to test the video conferencing 
among the remote ofﬁces?
A prototype would be the recommended form of testing because, for the video 
conferencing to work, there needs to be well-tested connectivity among the ofﬁces.

332     Chapter 9: Additional Case Studies
3 What network management tool would you recommend Martin & Martin purchase to 
support its new network?
Recommend CiscoWorks for Windows. CiscoWorks is an SNMP-based tool that can 
provide the monitoring of devices. Martin & Martin will be opening new ofﬁces, 
which need to be managed remotely. The case study speciﬁes that the remote ofﬁces 
will have limited IT support. Therefore, CiscoWorks’ remote management and 
conﬁguration capability will be useful. Also, CiscoWorks’ statistical information will 
be useful data for comparison with the baseline.
4 What type of naming structure would you give to servers and endnodes in this network?
The server naming convention should be based on the departments that use those 
servers. The workstations should also be named for those departments. For example, 
a printer in the Research department could be named RSC_Ptr0001.
5 The client wants to see the effect of data encryption on the router’s performance during 
the prototype stage in which you establish connectivity among the remote ofﬁces. How 
would you demonstrate this effect?
You can use the show processes command and monitor the CPU utilization.
6 Describe why Mr. Jones’ existing network does not provide adequate security for the data 
in each department.
The network is segmented by ﬂoors, which means that people in the Accounting and 
Finance department share the network with those in Human Resources. If each of 
these departments wants security, the trafﬁc needs to be separated.

This is a Class A address with a default mask of 255.0.0.0. The host 
portion is 240.32.45.
9 This protocol supports route summarization, but it must be conﬁgured. If link ﬂapping 
occurs, streams of updates are generated, causing router CPU overhead.
This describes a link-state protocol, such as OSPF.
10 If a customer is looking for ways to reduce WAN trafﬁc and is also considering tunneling 
AppleTalk in IP, what protocol would you recommend?
AppleTalk Update-Based Tunneling Protocol

networks.
18 What is an ASBR?
Autonomous system boundary router. This term is used in OSPF 
networks to identify those routers that have connections to external 
networks.
19 What is a stub network in OSPF?
A stub network does not receive External LSAs (type 5) from the ABR. 
A default gateway (0.0.0.0) is sent instead. Network Summary LSAs 
(type 3) are still sent in the area.
20 What is a totally stubby network in OSPF?
A totally stubby area does not receive External (type 5) and Network 
Summary (type 3) LSAs from the ABR. A default gateway (0.0.0.0) is 
sent instead. This signiﬁcantly reduces that amount of LSAs sent into 
the area.
21 True or False: Bridged networks provide large scalability.
False. Bridge networks are subject to broadcasts and multicast in the 
entire network, limiting their size in the internetwork.
22 True or False: To reduce the trafﬁc in bridge networks it is recommended to limit the size 
of the network and use routing to segment the network.
True. Use routers to segment bridged networks into smaller segments.
23 RIP uses a feature in which routes learned from a neighboring router are sent back to that 
neighbor with an inﬁnite unreachable metric. What is that feature?
Split horizon with poison reverse
24 What is the update time in IGRP?
IGRP sends updates every 90 seconds.
25 Does EIGRP send periodic updates?
No. EIGRP sends updates only when a metric is changed on a route. 
The update includes only that route and is sent only to those routers 
affected by that route.
26 Which queuing technique can be recommended to prioritize mission-critical SNA trafﬁc?

354     Appendix A: Answers to Quiz Questions
Priority queuing
27 List at least four Cisco IOS features.
Cisco IOS features include access lists, encryption, proxy services, 
compression, trafﬁc shaping, and queuing (custom, priority, and 
weighted fair).
28 True or False: The order in which access list commands are conﬁgured is not signiﬁcant 
to the router.
False. The order of access list statements is important. The router tests 
against each criteria statement in the order in which the statements 
were created.

AAL.  ATM adaptation layer. Service-dependent sublayer of the data link layer. The 
AAL accepts data from different applications and presents it to the ATM layer in the 
form of 48-byte ATM payload segments. AALs consist of two sublayers, CS and SAR. 
AALs differ on the basis of the source-destination timing used, whether they use CBR 
or VBR, and whether they are used for connection-oriented or connectionless mode 
data transfer. At present, the four types of AAL recommended by the ITU-T are AAL1, 
AAL2, AAL3/4, and AAL5. See AAL1, AAL2, AAL3/4, AAL5, CS, and SAR. See 
also ATM and ATM layer.
AAL1.  ATM adaptation layer 1. One of four AALs recommended by the ITU-T. 
AAL1 is used for connection-oriented, delay-sensitive services requiring constant bit 
rates, such as uncompressed video and other isochronous trafﬁc. See also AAL.
AAL2.  ATM adaptation layer 2. One of four AALs recommended by the ITU-T. 
AAL2 is used for connection-oriented services that support a variable bit rate, such as 
some isochronous video and voice trafﬁc. See also AAL.

AAL3/4.  ATM adaptation layer 3/4. One of four AALs (merged from two initially 
distinct adaptation layers) recommended by the ITU-T. AAL3/4 supports both 
connectionless and connection-oriented links, but is primarily used for the 
transmission of SMDS packets over ATM networks. See also AAL.
AAL5.  ATM adaptation layer 5. One of four AALs recommended by the ITU-T. 
AAL5 supports connection-oriented, VBR services, and is used predominantly for the 
transfer of classical IP over ATM and LANE trafﬁc. AAL5 uses SEAL and is the least 
complex of the current AAL recommendations. It offers low bandwidth overhead and 
simpler processing requirements in exchange for reduced bandwidth capacity and 
error-recovery capability. See also AAL and SEAL.
AARP.  AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol. Protocol in the AppleTalk protocol 
stack that maps a data-link address to a network address.
AARP probe packets.  Packets transmitted by AARP that determine whether a 
randomly selected node ID is being used by another node in a nonextended AppleTalk 
network. If the node ID is not being used, the sending node uses that node ID. If the 
node ID is being used, the sending node chooses a different ID and sends more AARP 
probe packets. See also AARP.
ABM.  Asynchronous Balanced Mode. An HDLC (and derivative protocol) 
communication mode supporting peer-oriented, point-to-point communications 
between two stations, where either station can initiate transmission.
ABR.  1. available bit rate. QOS class deﬁned by the ATM Forum for ATM networks. 
ABR is used for connections that do not require timing relationships between source 
and destination. ABR provides no guarantees in terms of cell loss or delay; it provides 
only best-effort service. Trafﬁc sources adjust their transmission rates in response to 
information they receive describing the status of the network and its capability to 
successfully deliver data. Compare with CBR, UBR, and VBR. 2. area border router. 
Router located on the border of one or more OSPF areas that connects those areas to 
the backbone network. ABRs are considered members of both the OSPF backbone and 
the attached areas. They therefore maintain routing tables describing both the 
backbone topology and the topology of the other areas.

can be transmitted by the X.25 network. See also address resolution.
address mask.  A bit combination used to describe which portion of an address refers 
to the network or subnet and which part refers to the host. Sometimes referred to 
simply as a mask. See also subnet mask.

protocol independent and can be operated in two modes: dense mode and sparse mode. 
See also PIM dense mode and PIM sparse mode.
PIM dense mode.  One of the two PIM operational modes. PIM dense mode is data 
driven and resembles typical multicast routing protocols. Packets are forwarded on all 
outgoing interfaces until pruning and truncation occurs. In dense mode, receivers are 
densely populated, and it is assumed that the downstream networks want to receive 
and will probably use the datagrams that are forwarded to them. The cost of using 
dense mode is its default ﬂooding behavior. Sometimes called dense mode PIM or 
PIM DM. Compare with PIM sparse mode. See also PIM.
PIM DM.  See PIM dense mode.
PIM SM.  See PIM sparse mode.
PIM sparse mode.  One of the two PIM operational modes. PIM sparse mode tries to 
constrain data distribution so that a minimal number of routers in the network receive 
it. Packets are sent only if they are explicitly requested at the RP (rendezvous point). 
In sparse mode, receivers are widely distributed, and the assumption is that 
downstream networks will not necessarily use the datagrams that are sent to them. The 

policy routing     465
cost of using sparse mode is its reliance on the periodic refreshing of explicit join 
messages and its need for RPs. Sometimes called sparse mode PIM or PIM SM.

trafﬁc policing .  A process used to measure the actual trafﬁc ﬂow across a given 
connection and compare it to the total admissible trafﬁc ﬂow for that connection. 
Trafﬁc outside the agreed on ﬂow can be tagged (where the CLP bit is set to 1) and can 
be discarded en route if congestion develops. Trafﬁc policing is used in ATM, Frame 
Relay, and other types of networks. Also know as admission control, permit 
processing, rate enforcement, and UPC (usage parameter control). See also tagged 
trafﬁc.

Internetworking Technology 
Review
An internetwork is a collection of individual networks, connected by intermediate 
networking devices, which functions as a single large network. Internetworking refers to 
the industry, products, and procedures that meet the challenge of creating and administering 
internetworks.
The ﬁrst networks were time-sharing networks that used mainframes and attached 
terminals. Such environments were implemented by both IBM’s System Network 
Architecture (SNA) and Digital’s network architecture.
Local-area networks (LANs) evolved around the PC revolution. LANs enabled multiple 
users in a relatively small geographical area to exchange ﬁles and messages, as well as 
access shared resources such as ﬁle servers.
Wide-area networks (WANs) interconnect LANs across normal telephone lines (and other 
media), thereby interconnecting geographically dispersed users.
Today, high-speed LANs and switched internetworks are becoming widely used, largely 
because they operate at high speeds and support high-bandwidth applications such as voice 
and video conferencing.
Protocols
Computers need to agree on a set of trafﬁc rules to successfully communicate. Such a set 
of rules is known as a protocol. Two computers use the same protocol if they want to 
communicate. Two computers trying to use different protocols would be like speaking 
French to a German—it wouldn’t work.
There are many different networking protocols in use. In the past, each networking vendor 
would invent their own protocol; today, standard protocols exist so that devices can 
communicate with each other. For example, TCP/IP is the most widely used routed 
protocol, but Novell’s IPX and Apple Computer’s AppleTalk are also used.

The OSI Model
Because sending data, like an e-mail, involves doing so many things, a standards committee—
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)—came up with a list of these 
functions and divided them into seven categories. These categories are collectively known as 
the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) seven-layer model. It represents everything that must 
happen in order to send data. It doesn’t say how these things are to be done, just what needs to 
be done. Figure C-1 illustrates the seven layers of the OSI model.
Figure C-1
Each Layer of the Seven-Layer OSI Model Represents a Function that Is Needed When Devices 
Communicate
Different vendors will implement the functions at these layers differently. For example, there 
are different physical layers (wires)—copper and ﬁber optic are two common ones.
As data is sent through the functions at each of the layers, information is added to allow the data 
to go through the network. The data is encapsulated, or wrapped in, the appropriate 
information. This encapsulated information includes addressing and error checking.
At Layer 4, the transport layer, the data is encapsulated in a segment.
At Layer 3, the network layer, this segment is then encapsulated in a packet or datagram. At 
Layer 3, routed protocols are used to send data through the network. There are different types 
of packets for each of the routed protocols at Layer 3; examples include IP and IPX packets.
At Layer 2, the data link layer, this packet is then encapsulated in a frame. The data link layer 
used is determined by the type of LAN or WAN you are connected to. There are different types 
of frames for each type of LAN or WAN. For example, the frames sent out on Ethernet are 
different than those sent out on Frame Relay because there are different protocols to be 
followed.
At Layer 1, the physical layer, the frame is sent out on the wire in bits.
When data is received at the other end of the network, it must have the additional information 
removed. Thus the data is decapsulated, or unwrapped, until the original data sent arrives at its 
destination.

LAN Protocols     513
LAN Protocols
A LAN typically has the following characteristics:
•
Interconnects devices over a “short” distance (hence the term “local area”)
•
Is fast
•
Belongs to you
•
Is there all the time
There are a number of different LAN technologies. Ethernet is the most common. Ethernet runs 
at 10 million bits per second (10 Mbps). New versions, known as Fast Ethernet and Gigabit 
Ethernet, run at 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps, respectively.
Other LAN technologies include Token Ring and FDDI. Token Ring is an IBM invention and 
is found mainly at IBM sites. FDDI is based on optical ﬁber and runs at 100 Mbps.
LAN protocols function at the lowest two layers of the OSI reference model: the physical layer 
and data link layer.
LAN Physical Network Access
LAN protocols typically use one of two methods to access the physical network medium:
•
In the carrier sense multiple access/collision detect (CSMA/CD) scheme, network devices 
contend for the use of the physical network. CSMA/CD is sometimes called contention 
access. Examples of LANs that use the CSMA/CD media access scheme are Ethernet/IEE 
802.3 networks.
•
In the token passing media access scheme, network devices access the physical medium 
based on possession of a token. Examples of LANs that use the token passing media 
access scheme are Token Ring/IEEE 802.5 and FDDI.
LAN Data Transmission Types
LAN data transmissions fall into three classiﬁcations:
•
In a unicast transmission, a single packet is sent from the source to a destination on a 
network. The source node addresses the packet by using the address of the destination 
node. The packet is then sent to the network, and ﬁnally, the network passes the packet to 
its destination.
•
A multicast transmission consists of a single data packet that is copied and sent to a 
speciﬁc subset of nodes on the network. The source node addresses the packet by using a 
multicast address. The packet is then sent to the network, which makes copies of the 
packet and sends a copy to each node that is part of the multicast address.

514     Appendix C: Internetworking Technology Review
•
A broadcast transmission consists of a single data packet that is copied and sent to all 
nodes on the network. In these types of transmissions, the source node addresses the 
packet by using the broadcast address. The packet is then sent to the network, which 
makes copies of the packet and sends a copy to every node on the network.
WAN Protocols
A WAN interconnects devices located at different geographical locations. A WAN typically
•
Interconnects devices over a “long” distance (hence “wide-area”)
•
Is slow (compared to a LAN)
•
Belongs to someone else (the “service provider”)
•
Is there only when you want to send something
WAN protocols function at the lowest two layers of the OSI reference model, the physical layer 
and data link layer. (X.25 is an exception to this; it functions at layer three also.)
WAN Categories
WANs can be categorized as follows:
•
Point-to-point links—Provide a single, preestablished WAN communication path 
from the customer premises through a carrier network, such as the telephone company, to 
a remote network. A point-to-point link is also known as a leased line because its 
established path is permanent and ﬁxed for each remote network reached through the 
carrier facilities.
•
Circuit switching—A WAN switching method in which a dedicated physical circuit 
is established, maintained, and terminated through a carrier network for each 
communication session. Used extensively in telephone company networks, circuit 
switching operates much like a normal telephone call. Integrated Services Digital 
Network (ISDN) is an example of a circuit-switched WAN technology.
•
Packet switching—A WAN switching method in which network devices share a 
single point-to-point link to transport packets from a source to a destination across a 
carrier network. Statistical mulitplexing is used to enable devices to share these circuits. 
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Frame Relay, Switched Multimegabit Data Service 
(SMDS), and X.25 are examples of packet-switched WAN technologies.

WAN Protocols     515
WAN Virtual Circuits
Virtual circuits are logical circuits created to ensure reliable communication between two 
network devices. Two types of virtual circuits exist:
•
Switched virtual circuits (SVCs)—Virtual circuits that are dynamically 
established on demand and terminated when transmission is complete. Communication 
over an SVC consists of three phases: circuit establishment, data transfer, and circuit 
termination.
•
Permanent virtual circuits (PVCs)—Permanently established virtual circuits that 
consist of one mode: data transfer.
WAN Dialup Services
Dialup services offer cost-effective methods for connectivity across WANs. Two popular dialup 
implementations follow:
•
Dial-on-demand routing (DDR)—A technique whereby a router can dynamically 
initiate and close a circuit-switched session as transmitting end stations demand. A router 
is conﬁgured to consider certain trafﬁc interesting (such as trafﬁc from a particular 
protocol) and other trafﬁc uninteresting. When the router receives interesting trafﬁc 
destined for a remote network, a circuit is established, and the trafﬁc is transmitted 
normally. If the router receives uninteresting trafﬁc and a circuit is already established, 
that trafﬁc also is transmitted normally. The router maintains an idle timer that is reset only 
when interesting trafﬁc is received. If the router receives no interesting trafﬁc before the 
idle timer expires, the circuit is terminated. Likewise, if uninteresting trafﬁc is received 
and no circuit exists, the router drops the trafﬁc.
•
Dial backup—A service that activates a backup serial line under certain conditions. 
The secondary serial line can act as a backup link that is used when the primary link fails 
or as a source of additional bandwidth when the load on the primary link reaches a certain 
threshold.
WAN Devices
Devices used in WAN environments include:
•
WAN switch—A multiport internetworking device used in carrier networks. These 
devices typically switch such trafﬁc as Frame Relay, X.25, and SMDS and operate at the 
data link layer.
•
Access server—Acts as a concentration point for dial-in and dial-out connections.
•
Modem—A device that interprets digital and analog signals, enabling data to be 
transmitted over voice-grade telephone lines.

516     Appendix C: Internetworking Technology Review
•
Channel service unit/digital service unit (CSU/DSU)—A digital-interface 
device (or sometimes two separate digital devices) that adapts the physical interface on a 
data terminal equipment (DTE) device (such as a terminal) to the interface of a data 
circuit-terminating (DCE) device (such as a switch) in a switched-carrier network. The 
CSU/DSU also provides signal timing for communication between these devices.
•
ISDN terminal adapter (TA)—A device used to connect ISDN Basic Rate 
Interface (BRI) connections to other interfaces, such as EIA/TAI-232. A terminal adapter 
is essentially an ISDN modem.
Deﬁning the type of WAN and the speciﬁcations and options desired is called provisioning the 
network.
Internetwork Addressing
Internetwork addresses identify devices separately or as members of a group. Addressing 
schemes vary depending on the protocol family and the OSI layer.
MAC Addresses
Media Access Control (MAC) addresses identify network entities in LANs. MAC addresses are 
unique for each LAN interface on a device. MAC addresses are 48 bits in length and are 
expressed as 12 hexadecimal digits. The ﬁrst 6 hexadecimal digits, which are administered by 
the IEEE, identify the manufacturer or vendor and thus comprise the Organizational Unique 
Identiﬁer (OUI). The last 6 hexadecimal digits comprise the interface serial number, or another 
value administered by the speciﬁc vendor. MAC addresses sometimes are called burned-in 
addresses (BIAs) because they are burned into read-only memory (ROM) and are copied into 
random-access memory (RAM) when the interface card initializes.
Network Layer Addresses
A network layer address identiﬁes an entity at the OSI network layer. Network addresses usually 
exist within a hierarchical address space and sometimes are called virtual or logical addresses.
Network layer addresses have two parts: the network that the device is on and the device (or 
host) number of that device on that network. Devices on the same logical network must have 
addresses with the same network part; however they will have unique device parts.
This is analogous to the postal “network” addresses: one part indicates the street, city, 
province/state, and so on, whereas the other part identiﬁes the building number on that street. 
For example, a building at 27 Main Street is on the same “network” as a building at 35 Main 
Street. The “network” portion of their addresses, Main Street, is identical, whereas the “device” 
portions are unique.

Network Devices     517
Network Devices
The main devices used in networking are as follows:
•
Hubs
•
Bridges and switches
•
Routers
Hubs
A hub is used to connect devices so that they are on one LAN, as shown in Figure C-2. The 
cables normally used for Ethernet have RJ-45 connectors. Because only two devices can be 
connected with these cables, we need a hub if we want to interconnect more than two devices 
on one LAN.
Figure C-2
A Hub Connects Devices So that They Are on One LAN
A hub is not a “smart” device. A hub sends all the data from a device on one port to all the other 
ports. When devices are connected via a hub, the devices all hear everything that the other 
devices send, whether it was meant for them or not. This is analogous to being in a room with 
lots of people—if you speak, everyone will hear you. If more than one person speaks at a time, 
there will just be noise. Rules must be put in place if real conversations are to happen; in 
networking, these rules are the protocols.
Bridges and Switches
To improve performance, LANs are usually divided into smaller multiple LANs. These LANs 
are then interconnected by a LAN switch or by a bridge, as shown in Figure C-3.

Mac

518     Appendix C: Internetworking Technology Review
Figure C-3
LANs Are Split into Many Smaller LANs, Using Switches or Bridges to Improve Performance
Switches and bridges have some “smarts.” When devices are connected via a switch or a bridge, 
a device will only hear the following:
•
Everything that the other devices on its port send
•
Any information from devices on other ports that was meant for everyone (a broadcast)
•
Any information from devices on other ports that was meant for devices on its port
A device connected to a switch or bridge will not hear any of the information meant just for 
devices on other ports of the switch.
Upper-layer protocol transparency is a primary advantage of both bridging and switching. 
Because both device types operate at the data link layer, they are not required to examine upper-
layer information. This means that they can rapidly forward trafﬁc representing any network 
layer protocol. It is not uncommon for a bridge to move AppleTalk, DECnet, TCP/IP, XNS, and 
other trafﬁc between two or more networks.
By dividing large networks into self-contained units, bridges and switches provide several 
advantages. Because only a certain percentage of trafﬁc is forwarded, a bridge or switch 
diminishes the trafﬁc experienced by devices on all connected segments. Bridges and switches 
extend the effective length of a LAN, permitting the attachment of distant stations that were not 
previously permitted.
Bridging Protocols
Switches and bridges may communicate with each other by using a bridging protocol. Several 
types of bridging protocols are supported by Cisco routers (acting as bridges) and switches, 
including the following:
•
Transparent bridging—Found primarily in Ethernet environments.
•
Source-route bridging (SRB)—Found primarily in Token Ring environments.
•
Translational bridging—Translates from Ethernet bridging to Token Ring bridging.

Network Devices     519
•
Encapsulating bridging—Allows packets to cross a bridged backbone network.
•
Source-route transparent (SRT) bridging—Allows a bridge to function as both 
a source-routing and transparent bridge.
•
Source-route translational (SR/TLB) bridging—Allows a bridge to function 
as both a source-routing and transparent bridge, and to bridge between the two.
NOTE
In SRB terminology, Layer 2 frames are also known as packets.
Transparent bridges send Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) frames to each other to build and 
maintain a spanning tree, as speciﬁed in IEEE 802.1d. The Spanning-Tree Algorithm states that 
there is one and only one active path between two stations. If a physical loop exists in the 
network (for redundancy reasons), the Spanning-Tree Algorithm handles this loop by disabling 
bridge ports. This prevents broadcast storms in networks with redundancy, which occurs when 
broadcasts continuously circle the network.
Bridges Versus Switches
Although bridges and switches share most relevant attributes, several distinctions differentiate 
these technologies. Switches are signiﬁcantly faster because they switch in hardware, whereas 
bridges switch in software. Switches can interconnect LANs of unlike bandwidth; a 10-Mbps 
Ethernet LAN and a 100-Mbps Ethernet LAN, for example, can be connected using a switch. 
Switches also can support higher port densities than bridges. Some switches support cut-
through switching, which reduces latency and delays in the network, whereas bridges support 
only store-and-forward trafﬁc switching.
Switches also support virtual LANs (VLANs). A VLAN is a logical, rather than physical, 
grouping of devices. The devices are grouped using switch management software so that they 
can communicate as if they were attached to the same wire, when in fact they might be located 
on a number of different physical LAN segments.
Cisco switches are known as Catalyst switches (because Cisco bought a company called 
Catalyst). Catalyst switches include the following series:
Catalyst 1900
Catalyst 4000
Catalyst 2820
Catalyst 5000
Catalyst 2900
Catalyst 5500
Catalyst 2900XL
Catalyst 6000
Catalyst 3000
Catalyst 3900
Catalyst 8500 multiservice switch routers
Generally the bigger the series number, the more LAN ports the switch has.

520     Appendix C: Internetworking Technology Review
Routers
A router connects devices on LANs to devices on other LANs, usually via WANs, as shown in 
Figure C-4.
Figure C-4
A Router Connects Devices on LANs to Devices on Other LANs, Usually Via WANs
A router has a lot of “smarts.” When companies started deploying PCs and connecting them via 
LANs, they soon wanted to go one step further and interconnect LANs and PCs located at 
geographically separate locations. The router provides this facility. The router will connect to a 
local LAN and then connect over a longer distance to another router, which in turn is connected 
to the remote LAN. Two PCs located hundreds of miles apart can now exchange data.
A router’s job is comprised of the following tasks:
•
Segment LANs and WANs
•
Figure out the best way to send data to its destination
•
Talk to other routers to learn from them and tell them what it knows
•
Send the data the best way, over a LAN or a WAN
When devices are connected via a router, a device will hear only the following:
•
Everything that the other devices on its port send
•
Any information from devices on other ports that was meant for devices on its port
A device connected to a router will not hear any of the information meant just for devices on 
other ports, nor any information from devices on other ports that was meant for everyone.
Cisco has a large selection of routers, including the following series:

Routing     521
Generally the bigger the series number, the more LAN and WAN ports the router has and the 
better performance it provides.
Routing
Routing is the act of moving information across an internetwork from a source to a destination. 
Along the way, at least one intermediate node typically is encountered. Routing occurs at Layer 
3, the network layer.
The book Introduction to Cisco Router Conﬁguration (Cisco Press) deﬁnes routed protocols 
and routing protocols:
•
A routed protocol is a protocol that contains enough network-layer addressing information for 
user trafﬁc to be directed from one network to another network. Routed protocols deﬁne the 
format and use of the ﬁelds within a packet. Packets that use a routed protocol are conveyed 
from end system to end system through an internetwork.
•
A routing protocol supports a routed protocol by providing mechanisms for sharing routing 
information. Routing protocol messages move between the routers. A routing protocol allows 
the routers to communicate with other routers to update and maintain routing tables. Routing 
protocol messages do not carry end-user trafﬁc from network to network. A routing protocol 
uses the routed protocol to pass information between routers. (pg. 79)
A metric is a standard of measurement, such as path length, that is used by routing algorithms 
to determine the optimal path to a destination. To aid the process of path determination, routing 
algorithms initialize and maintain routing tables, which contain route information. Route 
information varies depending on the routing algorithm used.
Routing algorithms can be classiﬁed by type. Key differentiators include:
•
Static versus dynamic—Static routing algorithms are hardly algorithms at all, but 
are table mappings established by the network administrator prior to the beginning of 
routing. These mappings do not change unless the network administrator alters them.
•
Single-path versus multipath—Some sophisticated routing protocols support 
multiple paths to the same destination.
•
Flat versus hierarchical—In a ﬂat routing system, the routers are peers of all others. 
In a hierarchical routing system, some routers form what amounts to a routing backbone. 
Routing systems often designate logical groups of nodes, called domains, autonomous 
systems, or areas.
•
Host-intelligent versus router-intelligent—Some routing algorithms assume 
that the source end-node will determine the entire route. This is usually referred to as 
source routing. Other algorithms assume that hosts know nothing about routes. In these 
algorithms, routers determine the path through the internetwork based on their own 
calculations.

522     Appendix C: Internetworking Technology Review
•
Intradomain versus interdomain—Some routing algorithms work only within 
domains; others work within and between domains.
•
Link-state versus distance-vector versus hybrid—Link-state algorithms (also 
known as shortest path ﬁrst algorithms) ﬂood routing information to all nodes in the 
internetwork. Each router, however, sends only the portion of the routing table that 
describes the state of its own links. Distance-vector algorithms (also known as Bellman-
Ford algorithms) call for each router to send all or some portion of its routing table, but 
only to its neighbors. In essence, link-state algorithms send small updates everywhere, 
whereas distance-vector algorithms send larger updates only to neighboring routers. 
Hybrid, or advanced, routing protocols have attributes associated with both distance-
vector and link-state protocols; hybrid protocols send small updates only to neighboring 
routers.
There are many suites of protocols that deﬁne protocols corresponding to the functions deﬁned 
in the OSI seven layers, including routed protocols, a selection of routing protocols, 
applications, and so forth. They are called protocol suites because they have protocols for doing 
many different things included in their suites. Protocol suites are also known as protocol stacks. 
This section provides a brief overview of some of these protocol suites.
TCP/IP Protocol Suite
TCP/IP is by far the most widely used protocol suite; it is the only one used in the Internet. TCP/
IP is short for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, after two of the protocols in the 
suite. It was not invented by any single vendor but evolved as the Internet grew.
TCP/IP Network Layer
The network layer (Layer 3) includes the following protocols:
•
Internet Protocol (IP)—Deﬁnes a set of rules for communicating across a network. 
IP contains addressing information and some control information that enables packets to 
be routed. IP has two primary responsibilities: providing connectionless, best-effort 
delivery of datagrams through an internetwork, and providing fragmentation and 
reassembly of datagrams to support data links with different maximum transmission unit 
(MTU) sizes.
•
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)—Allows a host to dynamically discover the 
MAC-layer address corresponding to a particular IP network layer address. In order for 
two machines on a given network to communicate, they must know the other machine’s 
physical addresses.

Routing     523
•
Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP)—Used to map MAC-layer 
addresses to IP addresses. RARP, which is the logical inverse of ARP, might be used by 
diskless workstations that do not know their IP addresses when they boot. RARP relies on 
the presence of a RARP server with table entries of MAC layer-to-IP address mappings.
•
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)—Used to report errors and other 
information regarding IP packet processing back to the source.
TCP/IP Transport Layer
At the transport layer (Layer 4), two transport protocols are deﬁned:
•
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)—Provides connection-oriented, end-to-
end reliable transmission of data in an IP environment. Connection establishment is 
performed by using a “three-way handshake” mechanism. A three-way handshake 
synchronizes both ends of a connection by allowing both sides to agree upon initial 
sequence numbers. This mechanism also guarantees that both sides are ready to transmit 
data and know that the other side is ready to transmit as well. This is necessary so that 
packets are not transmitted or retransmitted during session establishment or after session 
termination.
•
User Datagram Protocol (UDP)—A connectionless protocol that is basically an 
interface between IP and upper-layer processes. Unlike the TCP, UDP adds no reliability, 
ﬂow-control, or error-recovery functions to IP. Because of UDP’s simplicity, UDP headers 
contain fewer bytes and consume less network overhead than TCP.
TCP and UDP use protocol port numbers to distinguish multiple applications (described in the 
next section) running on a single device from one another. The port number is part of the TCP 
or UDP segment and is used to identify the application to which the data in the segment belongs. 
There are well-known, or standardized, port numbers assigned to applications, so that different 
implementations of the TCP/IP protocol suite can interoperate. Examples of these well-known 
port numbers include the following:
•
File Transfer Protocol (FTP)—TCP port 20 (data) and port 21 (control)
•
Telnet—TCP port 23
•
Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)—UDP port 69
TCP/IP Application Layer
In the TCP/IP protocol suite, the upper three layers of the OSI model are combined together 
into one layer, called the application layer. This suite includes many application layer protocols 
that represent a wide variety of applications, including the following:
•
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Trivial File Transfer Protocol 
(TFTP)—To move ﬁles between devices

524     Appendix C: Internetworking Technology Review
•
Simple Network-Management Protocol (SNMP)—Primarily reports 
anomalous network conditions and sets network threshold values
•
Telnet—Serves as a terminal emulation protocol
•
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)—Provides electronic mail services
•
Domain Name System (DNS)—Translates the names of network nodes into 
network addresses
IP Addressing
As mentioned, network layer addresses have two parts: the network that the device is on and the 
device (or host) number of that device on that network. Devices on the same logical network 
must have addresses with the same network part; however, they will have unique device parts.
IP addresses are 32 bits, as shown in Figure C-5. The 32 bits are grouped into four sets of 8 bits 
(octets), separated by dots, and represented in decimal format; this is known as dotted decimal 
notation. Each bit in the octet has a binary weight (128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1). The minimum 
value for an octet is 0, and the maximum decimal value for an octet is 255.
Figure C-5
IP Addresses Are 32 Bits, Written in Dotted Decimal Format
IP Address Classes
IP addressing deﬁnes ﬁve address classes: A, B, C, D, and E. Only classes A, B, and C are 
available for addressing devices; class D is used for multicast groups, and class E is reserved 
for experimental use.
The ﬁrst octet of an address deﬁnes its class, as illustrated in Table C-1. This table also shows 
the format of the addresses in each class as deﬁned by the network bits (N) and host bits (H).

Reference: RFC 1700, available at http://info.internet.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc1700.txt
IP Subnets
IP networks can be divided into smaller networks called subnetworks (or subnets). Subnetting 
provides the network administrator with several beneﬁts, including extra ﬂexibility, more 
efﬁcient use of network addresses, and the capability to contain broadcast trafﬁc (a broadcast 
will not cross a router).
Subnets are under local administration. As such, the outside world sees an organization as a 
single network and has no detailed knowledge of the organization’s internal structure.
A subnet address is created by “borrowing” bits from the host ﬁeld and designating them as the 
subnet ﬁeld. A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that is associated with an IP address; each bit in 
the subnet mask indicates how to interpret the corresponding bit in the IP address. In binary, a 
subnet mask bit of one indicates that the corresponding bit in the IP address is a network or 
subnet bit; a subnet mask bit of zero indicates that the corresponding bit in the IP address is a 
host bit. The subnet mask then indicates how many bits have been borrowed from the host ﬁeld 
for the subnet ﬁeld.
The default subnet mask for an address depends on its address class. Referring to Table C-1, 
class A addresses have one octet, or 8 bits, of network and 3 octets or 24 bits of host; therefore 
the default subnet mask for a class A address is 255.0.0.0, indicating 8 bits of network (binary 
ones in the mask) and 24 bits of host (binary zeros in the mask). Similarly, the default subnet 
mask for a class B address is 255.255.0.0 and for a class C address is 255.255.255.0.
Subnet mask bits come from the high-order (left-most) bits of the host ﬁeld.
When all the host bits of an address are zero, the address is for the wire (or subnet); when all 
the host bits of an address are one, the address is the broadcast on that wire.
As an example, a class B network 172.16.0.0 with 8 bits of subnet would have 8 of the available 
16 host bits “borrowed” for subnet bits; the subnet mask would be 255.255.255.0. With these 8 
subnet bits, there are 28 – 2 = 254 subnets; each subnet has 8 host bits, so there are 28 – 2 = 254 
hosts available on each subnet. (The two hosts and subnets are subtracted in the above 
calculations because of the network address and broadcast address.) The subnets would be

would be 172.16.1.1, 172.16.1.2, 172.16.1.3, and so on.
Usually within the same “major” network (a class A, B, or C network), the subnet mask used is 
the same for all subnets of that network. Using variable length subnet masking (VLSM) means 
using a different mask in some parts of the network. 
Tables C-2 and C-3 indicate the number of bits of subnetting, associated subnet mask, and 
resulting number of subnets and hosts available for class B and C networks, respectively.

Routing     527
How Subnet Masks Are Used to Determine the Network Number
The router performs a set process to determine the network (or more speciﬁcally, the 
subnetwork) address to which a packet should be forwarded. First, the router extracts the IP 
destination address from the incoming packet and retrieves the internal subnet mask. It then 
performs a logical AND operation to obtain the network number. This causes the host portion 
of the IP destination address to be removed, while the destination subnetwork number remains. 
The router then looks up the destination subnetwork number in its routing table and matches it 
with an outgoing interface. Finally, it forwards the frame to the destination IP address.
Three basic rules govern logically “ANDing” two binary numbers. First, 1 “ANDed” with 1 
yields 1. Second, 1 “ANDed” with 0 yields 0. Finally, 0 “ANDed” with 0 yields 0. The truth 
table provided in Table C-4 illustrates the rules for logical AND operations.
Two simple guidelines exist for remembering logical AND operations: Logically “ANDing” a 
1 with any number yields that number, and logically “ANDing” a 0 with any number yields 0.
Table C-5 illustrates an example of the logical “ANDing” of a destination IP address and the 
subnet mask. The subnetwork number remains, which the router uses to forward the packet.

•
Routing Information Protocol (RIP)—A distance-vector protocol that uses hop 
count as its metric. RIP is widely used for routing trafﬁc and is an Interior Gateway 
Protocol (IGP), which means it performs routing within a single autonomous system. The 
latest enhancement to RIP is the RIP 2 speciﬁcation, which allows more information to be 
included in RIP packets and provides a simple authentication mechanism.
•
The Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP)—A routing protocol that was 
developed in the mid-1980s by Cisco Systems, Inc. Cisco’s principal goal in creating 
IGRP was to provide a robust protocol for routing within an autonomous system (AS). 
IGRP is a distance vector interior gateway protocol. IGRP uses a combination (vector) of 
metrics. Internetwork delay, bandwidth, reliability, and load are all factored into the 
routing decision.
•
Enhanced Internet Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)—Represents an 
evolution from its predecessor IGRP. Enhanced IGRP is a hybrid routing protocol. It 
integrates the capabilities of link-state protocols into distance-vector protocols. EIGRP 
incorporates the Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL). Key capabilities that distinguish 
Enhanced IGRP from other routing protocols include fast convergence, support for 
VLSM, support for partial updates, and support for multiple network layer protocols 
(EIGRP supports IPX and AppleTalk, as well as IP).
•
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)—A link-state routing protocol that calls for the 
sending of link-state advertisements (LSAs) to all other routers within the same 
hierarchical area. Information on attached interfaces, metrics used, and other variables is 
included in OSPF LSAs. As OSPF routers accumulate link-state information, they use the 
shortest path ﬁrst (SPF) algorithm to calculate the shortest path to each node. Unlike RIP, 
OSPF can operate within a hierarchy. The largest entity within the hierarchy is the 
autonomous system (AS), which is a collection of networks under a common 
administration that share a common routing strategy. OSPF is an interior gateway routing 
protocol, although it is capable of receiving routes from and sending routes to other ASs. 
An AS can be divided into a number of areas, which are groups of contiguous networks 
and attached hosts.
•
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)—An exterior gateway protocol (EGP), which 
means that it performs routing between multiple autonomous systems or domains and 
exchanges routing and reachability information with other BGP systems. BGP was 
developed to replace its predecessor, the now obsolete Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP), 
as the standard exterior gateway routing protocol used in the global Internet. BGP solves 
serious problems with EGP and scales to Internet growth more efﬁciently.

Routing     529
Resource Reservation Protocol
The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) is a network control protocol that enables Internet 
applications to obtain special qualities of service (QoSs) for their data ﬂows. RSVP is not a 
routing protocol; instead, it works in conjunction with routing protocols and installs the 
equivalent of dynamic access lists along the routes that routing protocols calculate. RSVP 
occupies the place of a transport protocol in the OSI seven-layer model.
In RSVP, a data ﬂow is a sequence of messages that have the same source, destination (one or 
more), and quality of service. QoS requirements are communicated through a network via a 
ﬂow speciﬁcation, which is a data structure used by internetwork hosts to request special 
services from the internetwork. A ﬂow speciﬁcation often guarantees how the internetwork will 
handle some of its host trafﬁc.
RSVP supports three trafﬁc types: best-effort, rate-sensitive, and delay-sensitive. The type of 
data ﬂow service used to support these trafﬁc types depends on QoS implemented:
•
Best-effort trafﬁc is traditional IP trafﬁc. Applications include ﬁle transfer, mail 
transmissions, disk mounts, interactive logins, and transaction trafﬁc. The service 
supporting best-effort trafﬁc is called best-effort service.
•
Rate-sensitive trafﬁc is willing to give up timeliness for guaranteed rate. Rate-sensitive 
trafﬁc, for example, might request 100 kbps of bandwidth. If it actually sends 200 kbps 
for an extended period, a router can delay trafﬁc. An example of such an application is 
H.323 videoconferencing, which is designed to run on ISDN (H.320) or ATM (H.310) but 
is found on the Internet. H.323 encoding is a constant, or nearly constant, rate and it 
requires a constant transport rate. The RSVP service supporting rate-sensitive trafﬁc is 
called guaranteed bit-rate service.
•
Delay-sensitive trafﬁc is trafﬁc that requires timeliness of delivery and varies its rate 
accordingly. MPEG-II video, for example, averages about 3 to 7 Mbps, depending on the 
amount of change in the picture. MPEG-II video sources send key and delta frames. 
Typically, one or two key frames per second describe the whole picture, and 13 or 28 
frames describe the change from the key frame. Delta frames are usually substantially 
smaller than key frames. As a result, rates vary quite a bit from frame to frame. A single 
frame, however, requires delivery within a frame time or the CODEC (coder-decoder) is 
unable to do its job. A speciﬁc priority must be negotiated for delta-frame trafﬁc. RSVP 
services supporting delay-sensitive trafﬁc are referred to as controlled-delay service (non-
real-time service) and predictive service (real-time service).
RSVP data ﬂows are generally characterized by sessions, over which data packets ﬂow. A 
session is a set of data ﬂows with the same unicast or multicast destination, and RSVP treats 
each session independently.

530     Appendix C: Internetworking Technology Review
In the context of RSVP, quality of service is an attribute speciﬁed in ﬂow speciﬁcations that is 
used to determine the way in which data interchanges are handled by participating entities 
(routers, receivers, and senders). RSVP is used to specify the QoS by both hosts and routers. 
Hosts use RSVP to request a QoS level from the network on behalf of an application data 
stream. Routers use RSVP to deliver QoS requests to other routers along the path(s) of the data 
stream. In doing so, RSVP maintains the router and host state to provide the requested service.
To initiate an RSVP multicast session, a receiver ﬁrst joins the multicast group speciﬁed by an 
IP destination address by using the Internet Group Membership Protocol (IGMP). In the case 
of a unicast session, unicast routing serves the function that IGMP, coupled with Protocol-
Independent Multicast (PIM), serves in the multicast case. After the receiver joins a group, a 
potential sender starts sending RSVP path messages to the IP destination address. The receiver 
application receives a path message and starts sending appropriate reservation request messages 
specifying the desired ﬂow descriptors using RSVP. After the sender application receives a 
reservation request message, the sender starts sending data packets.
NetWare Protocol Suite
NetWare is a network operating system (NOS) that provides transparent remote ﬁle access and 
numerous other distributed network services, including printer sharing and support for various 
applications, such as electronic mail transfer and database access. NetWare speciﬁes the upper 
ﬁve layers of the OSI reference model and, as such, runs on virtually any media-access protocol 
(layer 2). Additionally, NetWare runs on virtually any kind of computer system, from PCs to 
mainframes. Introduced in the early 1980s, NetWare was developed by Novell, Inc. It was 
derived from Xerox Network Systems (XNS), which was created by Xerox Corporation in the 
late 1970s, and is based on a client-server architecture. Clients (sometimes called workstations) 
request services, such as ﬁle and printer access, from servers.
Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) is the original NetWare network layer (Layer 3) protocol 
used to route packets through an internetwork. IPX is a connectionless datagram-based network 
protocol and, as such, is similar to the Internet Protocol found in TCP/IP networks.
The Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX) protocol is the most common NetWare transport 
protocol at Layer 4 of the OSI model. SPX resides on top of IPX in the NetWare Protocol Suite. 
SPX is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol that supplements the datagram service provided 
by the IPX protocol. SPX was derived from the Xerox Networking Systems (XNS) Sequenced 
Packet Protocol (SPP).
NetWare supports a wide variety of upper-layer protocols, including the following:
•
NetWare shell—Runs on clients and intercepts application input/output (I/O) calls to 
determine whether they require network access for completion. Client applications are 
unaware of any network access required for completion of application calls.
•
NetWare Remote Procedure Call (NetWare RPC)—Another more general 
redirection mechanism similar in concept to the NetWare shell supported by Novell.

Routing     531
•
NetWare Core Protocol (NCP)—A series of server routines designed to satisfy 
application requests coming from, for example, the NetWare shell. The services provided 
by NCP include ﬁle access, printer access, name management, accounting, security, and 
ﬁle synchronization.
•
Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS)—A session layer interface 
speciﬁcation from IBM and Microsoft. NetWare’s NetBIOS emulation software allows 
programs written to the industry-standard NetBIOS interface to run within NetWare 
system.
NetWare application layer services include:
•
NetWare message-handling service (NetWare MHS)—A message-delivery 
system that provides electronic mail transport.
•
Btrieve—Novell’s implementation of the binary tree (btree) database-access 
mechanism.
•
NetWare loadable modules (NLMs)—Add-on modules that attach into a NetWare 
system. NLMs currently available from Novell and third parties include alternate protocol 
stacks, communication services, and database services.
•
IBM Logical Unit (LU) 6.2 network-addressable units (NAUs)—Support 
to allow peer-to-peer connectivity and information exchange across IBM networks. 
NetWare packets are encapsulated within LU 6.2 packets for transit across an IBM 
network.
IPX Addressing
As with other network addresses, Novell IPX network addresses must be unique. These 
addresses are represented in hexadecimal format and consist of two parts: a network number 
and a node number. The IPX network number, which is assigned by the network administrator, 
is 32 bits long. The node number, which usually is the Media Access Control (MAC) address 
for one of the system’s network interface cards (NICs), is 48 bits long.
NetWare Routing and Service Advertisement Protocols
IPX uses the following protocols for routing and service advertisement:
•
IPX Routing Information Protocol (RIP)—A distance vector routing protocol 
that sends routing updates every 60 seconds. To make best-path routing decisions, IPX 
RIP uses a tick as the metric, which in principle is the delay expected when using a 
particular length. One tick is 1/18th of a second. In the case of two paths with an equal 
tick count, IPX RIP uses the hop count as a tie breaker.

532     Appendix C: Internetworking Technology Review
•
Service Advertisement Protocol (SAP)—An IPX protocol through which 
network resources, such as ﬁle servers and print servers, advertise their addresses and the 
services they provide. Advertisements are sent via SAP every 60 seconds. Services are 
identiﬁed by a hexadecimal number, which is called a SAP identiﬁer (for example, 4 = ﬁle 
server and 7 = print server). SAP is pervasive in current networks based on NetWare 3.11 
and earlier but is utilized less frequently in NetWare 4.0 networks because workstations 
can locate services by consulting a NetWare Directory Services (NDS) Server. SAP, 
however, still is required in NetWare 4.0 networks for workstations when they boot up to 
locate an NDS server.
•
NetWare Link-Services Protocol (NLSP)—A link-state routing protocol from 
Novell designed to overcome some of the limitations associated with the IPX RIP and 
SAP. As compared to RIP and SAP, NLSP provides improved routing, better efﬁciency, 
and scalability. In addition, NLSP-based routers are backward-compatible with RIP-based 
routers. NLSP-based routers use a reliable delivery protocol, so delivery is guaranteed. 
NLSP is based on the OSI Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol 
and is similar to IS-IS except that a hierarchical topology was not deﬁned until Version 1.1 
of NLSP was speciﬁed (which is supported in Cisco IOS™ Release 11.1). NLSP now 
supports hierarchical routing with area, domain, and global internetwork components.
AppleTalk Protocol Suite
AppleTalk, a protocol suite developed by Apple Computer in the early 1980s, was developed in 
conjunction with the Macintosh computer. AppleTalk’s purpose was to allow multiple users to 
share resources, such as ﬁles and printers. The devices that supply these resources are called 
servers, whereas the devices that make use of these resources (such as a user’s Macintosh 
computer) are called clients.
AppleTalk was designed with a transparent network interface. That is, the interaction between 
client computers and network servers requires little interaction from the user. In addition, the 
actual operations of the AppleTalk protocols are invisible to end users, who see only the result of 
these operations. Two versions of AppleTalk exist: AppleTalk Phase 1 and AppleTalk Phase 2.
Four main media-access implementations exist in the AppleTalk protocol suite: EtherTalk, 
LocalTalk, TokenTalk, and FDDITalk. These data link layer implementations perform address 
translation and other functions that allow proprietary AppleTalk protocols to communicate over 
industry-standard interfaces, which include IEEE 802.3 (using EtherTalk), Token Ring/IEEE 
802.5 (using TokenTalk), and FDDI (using FDDITalk). In addition, AppleTalk implements its 
own network interface, known as LocalTalk.
AppleTalk Network Components
AppleTalk networks are arranged hierarchically. Four basic components form the basis of an 
AppleTalk network: sockets, nodes, networks, and zones.

Routing     533
•
An AppleTalk socket is a unique, addressable location in an AppleTalk node. It is the 
logical point at which upper-layer AppleTalk software processes and the network layer 
Datagram-Delivery Protocol (DDP) interact.
•
An AppleTalk node is a device that is connected to an AppleTalk network. This device 
might be a Macintosh computer, a printer, an IBM PC, a router, or some other similar 
device.
•
A nonextended AppleTalk network is a physical-network segment that is assigned only 
a single network number, which can range between 1 and 1,024. An extended AppleTalk 
network is a physical-network segment that can be assigned multiple network numbers. 
This conﬁguration is known as a cable range.
•
An AppleTalk zone is a logical group of nodes or networks that is deﬁned when the 
network administrator conﬁgures the network. The nodes or networks need not be 
physically contiguous to belong to the same AppleTalk zone.
AppleTalk Protocols
There are two protocols at the network layer:
•
AppleTalk Address-Resolution Protocol (AARP)—Associates AppleTalk 
network addresses with hardware addresses
•
Datagram Delivery Protocol (DDP)—Provides a best-effort connectionless 
datagram service between AppleTalk sockets
Five key implementations exist at the transport layer of the AppleTalk protocol suite:
•
Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP)—Responsible for establishing 
and maintaining routing tables for AppleTalk routers. RTMP is a distance-vector protocol 
typically used in AppleTalk LANs; it uses hop count as its metric.
•
Name-Binding Protocol (NBP)—Maps the addresses used at lower layers to 
AppleTalk names.
•
AppleTalk Update-Based Routing Protocol (AURP)—Allows two or more 
AppleTalk internetworks to be interconnected through a TCP/IP network to form an 
AppleTalk WAN. AURP encapsulates packets in User Datagram Protocol (UDP) headers, 
allowing them to be transported transparently through a TCP/IP network; this creates a 
virtual data link between the AppleTalk networks. AURP is also the routing protocol used 
on this virtual data link; in this capacity, it is similar to distance vector routing protocols 
but is designed to handle routing update trafﬁc over WAN links more efﬁciently than 
RTMP by only sending changed information.
•
AppleTalk Transaction Protocol (ATP)—Handles transactions between two 
AppleTalk sockets.

534     Appendix C: Internetworking Technology Review
•
AppleTalk Echo Protocol (AEP)—Generates packets that test the reachability of 
network nodes.
The session layer protocol implementations supported by AppleTalk include:
•
AppleTalk Data-Stream Protocol (ADSP)—Establishes and maintains full-
duplex communication between two AppleTalk sockets
•
Zone-Information Protocol (ZIP)—Maintains network number-to-zone name 
mappings in AppleTalk routers
•
AppleTalk Session Protocol (ASP)—Establishes and maintains sessions between 
AppleTalk clients and servers
•
Printer-Access Protocol (PAP)—Allows client workstations to establish 
connections with servers, particularly printers
The AppleTalk Filing Protocol (AFP) is implemented at the presentation and 
application layers of the AppleTalk protocol suite. AFP permits AppleTalk workstations to 
share ﬁles across a network.
AppleTalk Addressing
AppleTalk utilizes addresses to identify and locate devices on a network in a manner similar to 
the process utilized by protocols such as TCP/IP and IPX. These addresses, which are assigned 
dynamically, are composed of three elements:
•
Network number—A 16-bit value that identiﬁes a speciﬁc AppleTalk network (either 
a nonextended network or from an extended cable range)
•
Node number—An 8-bit value that identiﬁes a particular AppleTalk node attached to 
the speciﬁed network
•
Socket number—An 8-bit number that identiﬁes a speciﬁc socket running on a 
network node
AppleTalk addresses usually are written as decimal values separated by a period. For example, 
10.1.50 means network 10, node 1, socket 50. This also might be represented as 10.1, socket 50.
IBM Systems Network Architecture Protocols
IBM networking today consists of essentially two separate architectures that branch from a 
common origin. Before contemporary networks existed, IBM’s Systems Network Architecture 
(SNA) ruled the networking landscape, so it is often referred to as traditional or legacy SNA.
With the rise of personal computers, workstations, and client/server computing, the need for a 
peer-based networking strategy was addressed by IBM with the creation of Advanced Peer-to-
Peer Networking (APPN) and Advanced Program-to-Program Computing (APPC).

Routing     535
Traditional SNA Environments
SNA was developed in the 1970s with an overall structure that parallels the OSI reference 
model. With SNA, a mainframe running Advanced Communication Facility/Virtual 
Telecommunication Access Method (ACF/VTAM) serves as the hub of an SNA network. ACF/
VTAM is responsible for establishing all sessions and for activating and deactivating resources. 
In this environment, resources are explicitly predeﬁned, thereby eliminating the requirement for 
broadcast trafﬁc and minimizing header overhead.
IBM SNA model components map closely to the OSI reference model, as shown in Figure C-6.
Figure C-6
The IBM SNA Model Maps Closely to the OSI Model
The SNA layers are:
•
Data-link control—Deﬁnes several protocols, including the Synchronous Data Link 
Control (SDLC) protocol for hierarchical communication, and the Token Ring Network 
communication protocol for LAN communication between peers.
•
Path control—Performs many OSI network-layer functions, including routing and 
datagram segmentation and reassembly (SAR).
•
Transmission control—Provides a reliable end-to-end connection service, as well as 
encrypting and decrypting services.
•
Data ﬂow control—Manages request and response processing, determines whose turn 
it is to communicate, groups messages together, and interrupts data ﬂow on request.
•
Presentation services—Speciﬁes data-transformation algorithms that translate data 
from one format to another, coordinate resource sharing, and synchronize transaction 
operations.
•
Transaction services—Provides application services in the form of programs that 
implement distributed processing or management services.
Traditional SNA physical entities assume one of the following four forms:

Session
Transport

Data Link

536     Appendix C: Internetworking Technology Review
•
Hosts—In SNA, control all or part of a network and typically provide computation, 
program execution, database access, directory services, and network management. (An 
example of a host device within a traditional SNA environment is an S/370 mainframe.)
•
Communications controllers—Manage the physical network and control 
communication links. In particular, communications controllers (also called front-end 
processors [FEPs]) are relied upon to route data through a traditional SNA network. (An 
example of a communications controller is a 3745.)
•
Establishment controllers—Commonly called cluster controllers, these devices 
control input and output operations of attached devices, such as terminals. (An example 
of an establishment controller is a 3174.)
•
Terminals—Also referred to as workstations, terminals provide the user interface to the 
network. (A typical example would be a 3270.)
IBM Peer-Based Networking
Changes in networking and communications requirements caused IBM to evolve (and generally 
overhaul) many of the basic design characteristics of SNA. The emergence of peer-based 
networking entities (such as routers) resulted in a number of signiﬁcant changes in SNA. 
Internetworking among SNA peers hinges on several IBM-developed networking components.
Advanced Peer-to-Peer Networking (APPN) represents IBM’s second-generation SNA. In 
creating APPN, IBM moved SNA from a hierarchical, mainframe-centric environment to a 
peer-based networking environment. At the heart of APPN is an IBM architecture that supports 
peer-based communications, directory services, and routing between two or more Advanced 
Program-to-Program Computing (APPC) systems that are not directly attached.
Network Management
In general, network management is a service that employs a variety of tools, applications, and 
devices to assist human network managers in monitoring and maintaining networks.
Most network management architectures use the same basic structure and set of relationships. 
End stations (managed devices), such as computer systems and other network devices, run 
software that enables them to send alerts when they recognize problems (for example, when one 
or more user-determined thresholds are exceeded). Upon receiving these alerts, management 
entities are programmed to react by executing one, several, or a group of actions, including 
operator notiﬁcation, event logging, system shutdown, and automatic attempts at system repair.
Management entities also can poll end stations to check the values of certain variables. Polling 
can be automatic or user-initiated, but agents in the managed devices respond to all polls. 
Agents are software modules that ﬁrst compile information about the managed devices in which 
they reside, store this information in a management database, and ﬁnally provide it (proactively 
or reactively) to management entities within network management systems (NMSs) via a 

Network Management     537
network management protocol. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a well-
known network management protocol. Management proxies are entities that provide 
management information on behalf of other entities.
Simple Network Management Protocol
The Simple Network Management Protocol is an application layer protocol that facilitates the 
exchange of management information between network devices. It is part of the TCP/IP 
protocol suite. SNMP enables network administrators to manage network performance, ﬁnd 
and solve network problems, and plan for network growth.
Two versions of SNMP exist: SNMP Version 1 (SNMPv1) and SNMP Version 2 (SNMPv2). 
Both versions have a number of features in common, but SNMPv2 offers enhancements, such 
as additional protocol operations.
Managed devices are monitored and controlled using four basic SNMP commands:
•
The read command is used by a network management system (NMS) to monitor 
managed devices. The NMS examines different variables that are maintained by managed 
devices.
•
The write command is used by an NMS to control managed devices. The NMS changes 
the values of variables stored within managed devices.
•
The trap command is used by managed devices to asynchronously report events to the 
NMS. When certain types of events occur, a managed device sends a trap to the NMS.
•
Traversal operations are used by the NMS to determine which variables a managed 
device supports and to sequentially gather information in variable tables (such as a routing 
table).
A Management Information Base (MIB) is a collection of information that is organized 
hierarchically. MIBs are accessed using a network management protocol such as SNMP. MIBs 
are composed of managed objects and are identiﬁed by object identiﬁers. A managed object 
(sometimes called a MIB object, an object, or a MIB) is one of any number of speciﬁc 
characteristics of a managed device. Managed objects are composed of one or more object 
instances, which are essentially variables. An object identiﬁer (or object ID) uniquely identiﬁes 
a managed object in the MIB hierarchy.
SNMP is a simple request-response protocol. The NMS issues a request, and managed devices 
return responses. This behavior is implemented by using one of four protocol operations in 
SNMPv1:
•
The Get operation is used by the NMS to retrieve the value of one or more object 
instances from an agent.
•
The GetNext operation is used by the NMS to retrieve the value of the next object 
instance in a table or list within an agent.

538     Appendix C: Internetworking Technology Review
•
The Set operation is used by the NMS to set the values of object instances within an 
agent.
•
The Trap operation is used by agents to asynchronously inform the NMS of a signiﬁcant 
event.
The Get, GetNext, and Set operations used in SNMPv1 are exactly the same as those used in 
SNMPv2. SNMPv2, however, adds and enhances some protocols operations. The SNMPv2 
Trap operation, for example, serves the same function as that used in SNMPv1; however, it uses 
a different message format and is designed to replace the SNMPv1 Trap. SNMPv2 also deﬁnes 
two new protocol operations:
•
The GetBulk operation is used by the NMS to efﬁciently retrieve large blocks of data, 
such as multiple rows in a table.
•
The Inform operation allows one NMS to send trap information to another NMS and 
receive a response.
Remote Monitoring
Remote Monitoring (RMON) is a standard monitoring speciﬁcation that enables various 
network monitors and console systems to exchange network-monitoring data. The RMON 
speciﬁcation deﬁnes a set of statistics and functions that can be exchanged between RMON-
compliant console managers and network probes. As such, RMON provides network 
administrators with comprehensive network-fault diagnosis, planning, and performance-tuning 
information. RMON delivers information in nine RMON groups of monitoring elements, each 
providing speciﬁc sets of data to meet common network-monitoring requirements. Each group 
is optional so that vendors do not need to support all the groups within the Management 
Information Base (MIB).



A P P E N D I X D
LAN Media Reference
To supplement the material in Chapter 4, “Network Topologies and LAN Design,” this 
appendix covers Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, FDDI, and Token Ring 
technologies. This appendix covers the frame formats and the speciﬁcations for each LAN 
technology.
Ethernet Standards
Today’s Ethernet networks are based on the Ethernet development by Digital, Intel, and 
Xerox (DIX). Version 1 of the standard was created in 1980. It used unbalanced signaling 
(0,+5). In 1982, Version 2 of Ethernet was introduced. It added the heartbeat signal to 
transceivers and moved to balanced signaling (-5,0,+5). The heartbeat is used as a link test 
pulse. Version 2 is the basis of Ethernet that is used today.
Carrier sense multiple access/collision detect (CSMA/CD) is the media access method on 
Ethernet networks. In this scheme, nodes listen to the network for activity. If there is none, 
they can transmit a frame onto the network. While transmitting, they listen to the network 
for any collisions with other transmitting nodes. If a collision is detected, the node waits a 
random amount of time, listens for trafﬁc on the segment, and if there is none, attempts to 
send the frame, again. It attempts 16 times before sending an error message to the upper-
layer protocol.
Manchester encoding was selected to code signals on the wire on Ethernet. In Manchester 
encoding, a 0 is represented as a transition from high to low in the middle of the clocking 
time interval. A 1 is represented as a transition from low to high in the middle of the time 
interval. Figure D-1 shows a sample of Manchester encoding.

After the DIX Ethernet Version 2 standard was published, an effort went into producing an 
IEEE standard for Ethernet. The IEEE produced their 802.3 and 802.3 SNAP frame formats. 
Novell also produced their frame format for their network operating system. As a result, these 
different groups produced different frame formats for the Ethernet wire, but the signaling, 
encoding, and frame maximum and minimum sizes remain the same; therefore, these four 
frame formats can reside on the same segment:
•
Ethernet Version 2
•
Novell 802.3 raw
•
IEEE 802.3
•
IEEE 802.3 SNAP
Ethernet Version 2 Frame Format
Figure D-2 shows the Ethernet Version 2 frame format. The remainder of this section discusses 
the ﬁelds in the Ethernet Version 2 frame format.
Figure D-2
Ethernet Version 2 Frame Format
The preamble is a string of 1s and 0s, ending with 11, to indicate the beginning of the 
destination address (DA) ﬁeld. The string of 1s and 0s is used by the transceiver to sync up to 
the receiving signal. The preamble is as follows:
10101010 10101010 10101010 10101010 10101010 10101010 10101010 10101011
The DA ﬁeld contains the 48-bit MAC layer Ethernet address of the destination host.
The source address (SA) ﬁeld contains the 48-bit MAC layer Ethernet address of the host that 
sent the frame.
The type ﬁeld contains the Ethernet type (Ethertype) number that indicates the upper-layer 
protocol that this frame should be sent to. This number is greater than 1500 (05DC hex). 
Examples of Ethertypes are 0800 for the IP protocol and 6004 for Dec LAT. A list of Ethernet  
types can be viewed at http://www.standards.ieee.org/regauth/ethertype/type-pub.html.
The data ﬁeld contains the upper-layer protocol information. If the information is less than 46 
bytes, padding is used to reach the minimum frame size of 64 bytes (header plus data).
The frame check sequence (FCS) ﬁeld contains the CRC data to check for errors when receiving 
the frame.

The minimum frame size on Ethernet is 64 bytes, and the maximum is 1518. When calculating 
the frame size, do not include the preamble. The Version 2 frame format conforms to the 
following speciﬁcation:
•
The minimum frame size is 6+6+2+46+4 = 64 bytes
•
The maximum frame size is 6+6+2+1500+4 = 1518 bytes
Novell 802.3 Raw Frame Format
Prior to the IEEE 802.3 speciﬁcation, Novell needed a frame format for their NetWare 
Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) network operating system. The IEEE was going to change 
the Type ﬁeld to a Length ﬁeld, but no other work was completed.  Novell went ahead with their 
frame format to run on CSMA/CD networks.
Figure D-3 shows the Novell 802.3 raw frame format. The remainder of this section discusses 
the ﬁelds in the Novell 802.3 raw frame format.
Figure D-3
Novell 802.3 Raw Frame Format
The preamble ﬁeld is exactly the same as in Ethernet Version 2 frame format.
The DA ﬁeld contains the MAC address of the destination.
The SA ﬁeld contains the MAC address of the source.
The length ﬁeld contains the length of the data ﬁeld. Values are from 3 to 1500 bytes.
The FCS contains the CRC information.
Novell frames are unique in that the data ﬁeld begins with FFFF hex (at the beginning of the 
IPX protocol header).
IEEE 802.3 Frame Format
The IEEE produced their Ethernet standard in June 1983. They changed the type ﬁeld to a 
length ﬁeld and added the Logical Link Control (LLC) layer.
Figure D-4 shows the IEEE 802.3 frame format. The remainder of this section discusses the 
ﬁelds in the IEEE 802.3 frame format.

The IEEE deﬁned the preamble to be a string of 1s and 0s that is 7 bytes long. The following 
byte is the Start Frame Delimiter (SFD):
10101011
Following the SFD are the DA and SA ﬁelds, with MAC addresses.
The length ﬁeld contains the length of the LLC plus the data ﬁeld. Its values range from 3 to 
1500.
The LLC layer is added by the IEEE to indicate the upper-layer protocol. It is divided into three 
ﬁelds, as shown in Figure D-5.
Figure D-5
IEEE LLC Layer Fields
The destination service access point (DSAP) indicates the destination upper-layer protocol. 
The source service access point (SSAP) indicates the source upper-layer protocol. Examples of 
SAPs are as follows:
•
NetBios = F0
•
Bridge PDU = 42
•
SNA = 04,05,0C

The problem the IEEE faced when developing the IEEE frame format was, by then, protocols 
using DIX Version 2 had been in use for three years. To transition to an IEEE 802.3-compliant 
frame, the SNAP ﬁeld was added to 802.3, to provide transition. The SNAP ﬁeld includes the 
Ethernet type information used in DIX Version 2. Figure D-6 shows the IEEE 802.3 SNAP

All ﬁelds are the same as in IEEE 802.3. The SNAP ﬁeld is added. It contains two ﬁelds, 
including a 3-byte vendor code ﬁeld that is unique to different vendors. The next ﬁeld in the 
SNAP is the 2-byte Ethernet type ﬁeld, used in Ethernet Version 2. The SNAP ﬁelds are 
displayed in Figure D-7.

What has happened in the years following these standards is that IP and DEC protocols use 
Ethernet Version 2, Novell IPX (3.x) uses its 802.3 raw format, and SNA uses 802.3. In multi-
protocol networks today, there is a mix of frame formats on the network.
The following sections cover Ethernet physical speciﬁcations.

10BaseT
Unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) has become a very popular medium for LAN systems. 10BaseT 
was made an IEEE standard in 1990. The 10BaseT speciﬁcations are as follows:
•
24 AWG UTP 0.4-/0.6-mm cable
•
Maximum segment length is 100 m
•
One device per cable
Figure D-10 shows a sample 10BaseT Ethernet network.
Figure D-10
Sample 10BaseT Network
100BaseT Fast Ethernet
The IEEE developed the 802.3u in 1995 to provide Ethernet speeds of 100 Mbps over UTP and 
ﬁber cabling. The 100BaseT standard is similar to 10 Mbps Ethernet in that it uses CSMA/CD; 
runs on Cat 3, 4, and 5 UTP cable; and the frame formats are preserved. Connectivity still uses 
hubs, repeaters, and bridges.
The difference is that the encoding changed from Manchester to 4B/5B with nonreturn to zero 
(NRZ), the new speed is 100 Mbps, and the Media Independent Interface (MII) was introduced 
as a replacement to the AUI.
The 4B/5B coding takes 4 bits of data and expands it into a 5-bit code for transmission on the 
physical channel. Because of the 20 percent overhead, pulses run at 125 MHz on the wire, to 
achieve 100 Mbps. Table D-1 shows how some data numbers are converted to 4B/5B code.

The following speciﬁcations are covered in the following sections:
•
100BaseTX
•
100BaseT4
•
100BaseFX
100BaseTX
The 100BaseTX speciﬁcation uses Category 5 UTP wiring. Like 10BaseT, Fast Ethernet uses 
only two pairs of the four-pair UTP wiring. If Category 5 cabling is already in place, upgrading 
to Fast Ethernet only requires a hub or switch and NIC upgrades. Because of the low cost, most 
of today’s installations use switches. The speciﬁcations are as follows:
•
Transmission over Cat 5 UTP or Cat 1 STP wire
•
RJ-45 connector (same as in 10BaseT)
•
Punchdown blocks in the wiring closet must be Category 5 certiﬁed
•
4B/5B coding
100BaseT4
The 100BaseT4 speciﬁcation was developed to support UTP wiring at the Category 3 level. 
This implementation is not widely deployed. The speciﬁcations are as follows:
•
Transmission over Cat 3, 4, or 5 UTP wiring
•
Three wires used for transmission, and the fourth wire is used for collision detection
•
No separate transmit and receive pairs are present, so full-duplex operation is not possible

1000 Mbps Gigabit Ethernet
The most recent development in the Ethernet arena is Gigabit Ethernet. Gigabit Ethernet is 
speciﬁed by two standards: IEEE 802.3z and 802.3ab. The 802.3z standard speciﬁes the 
operation of Gigabit Ethernet over ﬁber and coaxial cable and introduces the Gigabit Media 
Independent Interface (GMII). The 802.3z standard was approved in July 1998. The 802.3ab 
standard speciﬁes the operation of Gigabit Ethernet over Category 5 UTP. It was approved in 
June 1999. Gigabit Ethernet still retains the frame formats and frame sizes of 10 Mbps Ethernet, 
along with the use of CSMA/CD. As with Ethernet and Fast Ethernet, full-duplex operation is 
possible. Differences can be found in the encoding; Gigabit Ethernet uses 8B/10B coding with 
simple NRZ. Because of the 20 percent overhead, pulses run at 1250 MHz to achieve 1000 
Mbps. Gigabit Ethernet includes the following methods to achieve 1 Gbps speed:
•
8B/10B coding
•
Bytes are encoded as 10-bit symbols
•
Run-length limited (no long sequences of 1s or 0s)
•
Pulses on the wire run at 1250 MHz to achieve 1000 Mbps speed

The following speciﬁcations are covered in the following sections:
•
1000BaseLX
•
1000BaseSX
•
1000BaseCX
•
1000BaseT
1000BaseLX
The IEEE 1000BaseLX uses long-wavelength optics over a pair of ﬁber strands. The 
speciﬁcations are as follows:
•
Uses long wave (1300nm)
•
Use on multi-mode or single-mode ﬁber
•
Maximum lengths for multi-mode ﬁber are:

The speciﬁcations are as follows:
•
Uses short wave (850nm)
•
Use on multi-mode ﬁber
•
Maximum lengths:
— 62.5-micron: 220m
— 50-micron: 500m
•
Uses 8B/10B encoding with simple NRZ

Token Ring     551
1000BaseCX
The IEEE 1000BaseCX standard is intended for short copper runs between servers. The 
speciﬁcations are as follows:
•
Used on short copper runs
•
Over a pair of 150-ohm balanced coaxial cables (twinax)
•
Maximum length is 25m
•
Mainly for server connections
•
Uses 8B/10B encoding with simple NRZ
1000BaseT
The IEEE standard for 1000 Mbps Ethernet over Category 5 UTP is IEEE 802.3ab. This 
standard uses the four pairs in the cable (Fast and 10BaseT Ethernet use only two pairs). The 
speciﬁcations are as follows:
•
Category 5, four-pair UTP
•
Maximum length is 100m
•
Encoding deﬁned as a 5-level coding scheme
•
1 byte is sent over the four pairs at 1250 MHz
•
Standard was approved in June 1999
Token Ring
Token Ring was developed by IBM for the forwarding of data on a logical unidirectional ring; 
the physical connectivity can be a star. The IEEE standard for Token Ring is IEEE 802.5; the 
differences with IBM’s speciﬁcation are minor. Devices connect to a multistation access unit 
(MSAU). MSAUs can be connected together with patch cables, to form a ring. The MSAU can 
also bypass stations that are defective on the ring. Figure D-11 shows the connectivity in the 
Token Ring network. The MSAUs are connected in a physical ring.
Token Ring uses Differential Manchester as a coding scheme. In Differential Manchester, a 0 
is represented as a transition at the beginning of the clock time interval. A 1 is indicated as an 
absence of a transition. Access is controlled by using a token. A token is passed along the 
network from station to station; if a station has no data to transmit, it forwards the token to the 
next station. If the station wants to transmit data, it seizes the token, produces a data frame, and 
sends it to the destination. The receiving station reads the frame and forwards it along the ring, 
back to the source station. The source station veriﬁes that the data frame was read and releases 
a token back onto the network.

552     Appendix D: LAN Media Reference
Figure D-11
Token Ring
One station on the Token Ring is selected to be the active monitor. This station acts as a 
centralized source of timing information for other ring stations and performs a variety of ring-
maintenance functions. The active monitor can remove continuously circulating frames that are 
not removed by a fault sender.
Token Ring Frame Format
There are two types of frame formats: data/command frames and token frames. These frames 
are displayed in Figures D-12 and D-13. Tokens are 3 bytes in length and consist of a start 
delimiter, an access control byte, and an end delimiter. Data/command frames vary in size, 
depending on the size of the information ﬁeld. Command frames contain control information 
and do not carry upper-layer protocols.

•
Data rates—4 and 16 Mbps
•
Maximum stations per segment—250
•
Topology—Logical ring, physical star

Fiber Distributed Data Interface
Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) was developed for the transmission of data over ﬁber 
at 100 Mbps. The standard is governed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). 
FDDI is deployed in a dual-ring topology. Each dual-attached station (DAS) attaches to both 
rings; the second ring is on standby. If there is a failure of a station or a link on the ring, a ring 
wrap occurs, creating a single ring for continued communication. Access to the ring is by the 
use of a token (as in Token Ring). Figure D-14 shows a sample FDDI network.

554     Appendix D: LAN Media Reference

FDDI Frame Format
The FDDI frame format is similar to the format of a Token Ring frame. FDDI frames can be as 
large as 4500 bytes. There is a token and a data frame format. Figures D-15 and D-16 show 
these formats.

medium-sized businesses to provide secure access to the Internet. It also links users and 
ofﬁces so that they can easily share resources such as information, documents, and printers.
Cisco Branch Ofﬁce Connectivity Solutions
Communication becomes challenging for small- and medium-sized companies with branch 
ofﬁces, warehouses, or business partners located in various geographical areas. These 
companies frequently need to share customer information, check inventory, look up sales 
data, transfer ﬁles, process invoices, and exchange e-mail. The integration of voice and data 

558     Appendix E: Cisco Small and Medium Business Solution Guide
trafﬁc over shared WAN lines can save companies signiﬁcant amounts of money. Still, a 
dispersed organization cannot communicate effectively and efﬁciently without the right 
technology.
Customers in need of branch ofﬁce connectivity solutions require the following:
•
Cost-effective branch ofﬁce connectivity solutions that combine application availability 
with fast and timely access to business information, to increase productivity and stay 
competitive
•
Low cost of ownership to control wide-area connections and ongoing management costs
•
Scalability to protect investments and allow for expansion
•
Reduction of WAN line costs by integrating voice and data trafﬁc over shared lines
Branch Ofﬁce Connectivity Considerations
This section covers branch ofﬁce connectivity considerations.
WAN Connectivity Flexibility
A central site solution should have a modular design that can accommodate many different 
types of WAN connections with remote locations. In addition, this solution should meet 
bandwidth and usage connection time requirements.
WAN service options for branch ofﬁce connectivity include these:
•
ISDN leased lines for a high-bandwidth, cost-effective solution for companies requiring 
light or sporadic high-speed access to either a central ofﬁce or a branch ofﬁce
•
Frame Relay or X.25 for companies needing more permanent connections
•
Leased-line solutions in which higher connection times and shorter distances are 
generally more cost-effective
WAN Optimization Features
Because some WAN charges (such as ISDN) are based on usage, it is important that companies 
have a solution that can implement features to optimize bandwidth and help keep WAN costs 
to a minimum. Bandwidth-on-demand (BOD), dial-on-demand routing (DDR), snapshot 
routing, Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) spooﬁng, and compression keep WAN costs to a 
minimum.

Cisco Business Solutions     559
Security
Ensuring that central site and branch ofﬁce data remains secure is an important consideration 
for these reasons:
•
Access lists can ﬁlter out unauthorized data ﬂow between ofﬁces.
•
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) network links, Password Authentication Protocol (PAP), 
and Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) can identify the remote entity 
to prevent unauthorized network connections.
Branch Ofﬁce to Central Site Solutions
For simpliﬁed management and to ensure full interoperability, customers should consider 
vendors that have solutions for both the branch ofﬁce and the central site. Figure E-1 shows 
sample branch ofﬁce connectivity solutions.

integration, and price points.
The multifunctional Cisco 2505, 2507, and 2516 models deliver the capabilities of a 
manageable Ethernet 10BaseT hub and router in the same box. By eliminating multiple 
standalone network devices, clumsy cabling, and complicated installations, these versatile 
routers are ideal for deployment in remote ofﬁce locations. The Cisco 2516 also offers an ISDN 
BRI port that can be used as a backup link, to allow ﬂexibility for disaster recovery and 
additional BOD.
The Cisco 2501-4 and 252x models offer the ﬂexibility, performance, and redundancy of dual 
serial interfaces and the option of ISDN BRI.
The Cisco 2513, 2514, and 2515 models double the LAN interfaces of the Cisco 2501-4 models 
to two Ethernet or Token Ring interfaces, or one of each. These models give branch ofﬁces a 
cost-effective way to segment existing LANs for faster network response and to provide ﬁrewall 
applications to improve security.
The Cisco 1600 series represents a class of routers optimized for small branch ofﬁces. It 
contains a feature set that matches the concerns customers have today over the need to protect 
investments, ﬂexibility in WAN service choices, feature support for multimedia, and enhanced 
security functions. In addition to providing IP, IPX, and AppleTalk routing protocols, the Cisco 
1600 series also includes enhanced features unique to Cisco: This includes Network Address 
Translation (NAT), which lets customers use any IP address in the internal network; and generic 
routing encapsulation (GRE) tunneling, a scheme for tunneling trafﬁc between networks, 
allowing customers to create virtual private networks. With a WAN interface card slot and 
support of multiple WAN technologies, the Cisco 1600 ensures investment protection as 
customer needs change and different services are required.

Cisco Telecommuting and Remote User Solutions
As advances in digital communications shrink time and distance, a new model of the workplace 
is taking shape. The modern ofﬁce is no longer contained within a structure—instead, it is 
mobile and geographically scattered. The twenty-ﬁrst century workplace is becoming any place 
where work is done. Companies must provide remote access to e-mail and other network 
resources to telecommuters and remote users. Telecommuting can be a valuable tool for 
recruiting and retaining key personnel in today’s tight labor market.
Small- and medium-sized businesses in need of integrated telecommuting and remote user 
solutions need to take the following actions:
•
Integrate dialup connectivity with traditional, remote user to LAN access
•
Support the higher levels of performance required for new applications, such as Internet 
access, intranet communications, and multimedia
•
Ensure security, data privacy, and availability as users connect from any location, 
including branch ofﬁces, home ofﬁces, and hotel rooms
•
Integrate products powerful enough to handle today’s needs and ﬂexible enough to grow 
and to adapt to tomorrow’s requirements.
Telecommuting and Remote User Considerations
This section covers telecommuting and remote user considerations.
Scalability
Scalability and modularity are key requirements—as a company grows, it can leverage its 
investment in existing equipment.
For telecommuting and remote access solutions, it is critical that the central ofﬁce solution 
allows system administrators to scale their network capacities.

Cisco Business Solutions     563
Security
When implementing telecommuting and remote user solutions, it is critical that security for the 
central site be preserved; user authentication features prove a user’s true identity to prevent 
unauthorized use of network resources.
WAN Optimization
Because most ISDN charges are based on usage, it is important that ISDN telecommuting users 
have a solution that can implement dial-on-demand routing, enabling users to initiate a WAN 
connection only when there is network trafﬁc destined for a remote location.
Bandwidth-on-demand is another important feature that allows ISDN users to dynamically 
aggregate multiple B channels for high bandwidth when required.
Conﬁguration Flexibility
Today, two popular WAN services for telecommuters are modem dialup via basic telephone 
service and ISDN modem dialup is a cost-effective solution for users who need occasional 
access to the corporate network to transfer relatively small amounts of data, or for mobile users 
who need to connect from customer sites, hotel rooms, or other locations. ISDN offers an 
attractive alternative for users who need high-speed access to network resources and large ﬁles. 
In addition, Frame Relay is growing in popularity as a WAN service for full-time 
telecommuters. It is important that a central site solution for telecommuting have a modular 
design that can accommodate all three types of connections from a single device.
Telecommuter to Central Site Solutions
A vendor that provides both home ofﬁce and central site products offers a solution that 
simpliﬁes network management and that ensures full interoperability. The correct solution 
depends on the needs of the user:
•
Does the user need additional analog interfaces that allow devices such as fax machines 
to share the ISDN BRI line?
•
Does the user need an integrated four-port hub?
•
Does the user require support for multiprotocol routing or synchronous serial WAN 
connectivity?

Cisco Internet and Intranet Solutions
Small- and medium-sized companies seeking to remain competitive must leverage the Internet 
as a business asset. From simple electronic mail to marketing and customer service information, 
the Internet is changing the way everyone does business. Cisco solutions support a variety of 
Internet and intranet applications.
Internet Access
At its most basic, Internet access is the process of connecting a private local-area network to the 
Internet. Most small- and medium-sized businesses rely upon an Internet service provider (ISP) 
to provide technical expertise to set up and manage an Internet access point. Small and medium-
sized businesses require an access router to link their Ethernet or Token Ring LANs to ISP sites 
via dialup or dedicated WAN lines.
Intranets
An intranet is a private communications network based on TCP/IP and Web technologies, and 
it resembles a private version of the Internet. Intranets can span a single network segment, a 

Cisco Business Solutions     567
building, or all ofﬁces of a company. Familiar, easy-to-use Web browsers act as interfaces to 
existing network applications and databases. Users no longer have to know where a server is 
located or how to connect to it. Older, powerful mainframe or client/server applications are 
easier to use with simpliﬁed Web interfaces.
Internet Marketing
Internet marketing uses World Wide Web sites and other means (such as e-mail and File 
Transfer Protocol [FTP] sites) to market companies. The Internet has been called the great 
equalizer between giant corporations and small businesses. With Internet marketing, customers 
do not know how small or large a company is because Web sites focus on the product or service. 
Web sites can also help small- and medium-sized businesses build stronger customer and 
partner relationships by providing easy access to company information from anywhere and at 
any time.
Extranets and Electronic Commerce
Extranets are an extension of a company network or a collaborative Internet connection to key 
customers, suppliers, and partners. Extranets use private WAN lines or virtual private networks 
(VPNs) to provide access to speciﬁc company information and to build closer business 
relationships. VPNs use the Internet to create secure pathways between a company and its 
extranet partners. VPNs provide the same types of network services you expect in your private 
network, but they do it over the Internet, thus saving money. A typical extranet solution requires 
a router at each end, a ﬁrewall, authentication software, a server, and a dedicated WAN line or 
VPN over the Internet.
Electronic commerce is the act of purchasing goods and services online and requires the 
electronic exchange of funds, usually by credit card. E-commerce can build customer 
satisfaction by receiving orders and fulﬁlling them more quickly, with less hassle and greater 
accuracy. E-commerce applications require a commerce application deployed on a Web site, an 
access router, a ﬁrewall, and a full-time Internet connection.
Security
What most concerns customers about any Internet solution is security. Good security solutions 
reduce costs, enable new applications and services, and make the Internet a low-cost, ubiquitous 
access media. Cisco offers a comprehensive security solution through Cisco IOS software and 
dedicated ﬁrewall appliances that enable customers to securely take advantage of the Internet.

Cisco High-Performance LAN Solutions
Networks are a vital business asset. Small- and medium-sized businesses must be sure that their 
networks provide quick, reliable access to applications and data, which are the keys to success 
in today’s highly competitive, increasingly global economy. Today’s business applications 
require high-bandwidth networks. Businesses also require more powerful network technologies 
that are capable of intelligently and efﬁciently managing trafﬁc ﬂow.

572     Appendix E: Cisco Small and Medium Business Solution Guide
Traditional hub-centric LANs can no longer support the bandwidth needed for companies to 
conduct business. Small- and medium-sized businesses often connect remote or branch ofﬁces, 
mobile users, and telecommuters. Internet usage to support marketing and commerce 
applications also places demand on LANs once isolated from the rest of the world.
Customers need the additional bandwidth of high-performance LANs in these circumstances:
•
Users are sitting idle while tasks complete over the network.
•
File transfers become a productivity bottleneck.
•
Project schedules are compromised by an incapability to quickly access and share data.

Cisco FastHub 100 series 10/100 hubs are standalone hubs with a choice of ﬁxed 12 or 24 
10BaseT/100BaseTX ports for UTP attachment. These cost-effective hubs are ideal for 
providing 10 or 100 Mbps performance for users with multiple workstations, small 
workgroups, or switch aggregation when management is not a requirement.
Cisco FastHub 200 series Fast Ethernet hubs deliver the lowest-cost, managed 100BaseT hub 
solution for midsize workgroups and server farms. These standalone hubs combine 100 Mbps 
performance and integrated management with Cisco IOS technologies in an extremely 
affordable solution.
When manageability and scalability are required, the FastHub 300 series is the optimal 
solution. The FastHub 300 series combines all the beneﬁts of stackable hubs with unmatched 
conﬁguration ﬂexibility, exceptional affordability, and integrated Cisco IOS software.
The FastHub 300 series is the only Fast Ethernet hub available that lets you add users and 
management in a single unit.
The FastHub 300 series hubs offer richer management options than any other Fast Ethernet hub. 
A single, optional network management module provides comprehensive manageability and 
simpliﬁed troubleshooting on a per-port, per-hub, and per-stack basis using SNMP, Telnet, 
RMON, or an out-of-band console.
The 10/100 bridge module with integrated management extends cabling for the FastHub 300 
series and provides Ethernet/Fast Ethernet connectivity.
Catalyst switches and FastHub repeaters can be used alone or together to improve network 
performance.
Existing Ethernet users can be attached to the switches directly through their existing adapter 
cards, and new users or high-bandwidth users with 10/100 network interface cards are 
connected to the FastHubs.
Servers can be attached to high-speed switch ports, or the FastHub repeater can act as both a 
server farm and a high-speed local backbone for the switches.
As trafﬁc increases, 10/100 Fast Ethernet switches can be added to prevent backbone 
congestion and to provide dedicated Fast Ethernet connections for individual users.

Cisco Ease of Use and Network Management Overview
Ease of use and network management are important to small- and medium-sized companies and 
SOHO customers because these businesses are not highly technical or because occasional or 
infrequent users might be put off by the complexities of networking.
Many of the router solutions on the market today for small- to medium-sized businesses have 
installation instructions requiring a high level of network understanding. All the cables look 
alike, and conﬁguring the router requires use of non-user-friendly command-line interfaces. 
Cisco has developed two Windows NT/95 wizard-based tools to speciﬁcally address 
conﬁguring and installing routers designed for small companies and SOHO users.
Network management is also of growing concern because of the increasing number of 
difﬁculties and high expense that arise due to seemingly uncontrollable problems. Network 

Cisco Ease of Use and Network Management Overview     631
