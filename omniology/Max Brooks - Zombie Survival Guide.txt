INTRODUCTION
The dead walk among us. Zombies, ghouls—no matter what their label—these somnambulists are the
greatest threat to humanity, other than humanity itself. To call them predators and us prey would be
inaccurate. They are a plague, and the human race their host. The lucky victims are devoured, their bones
scraped clean, their flesh consumed. Those not so fortunate join the ranks of their attackers, transformed
into putrid, carnivorous monsters. Conventional warfare is useless against these creatures, as is
conventional thought. The science of ending life, developed and perfected since the beginning of our
existence, cannot protect us from an enemy that has no “life” to end. Does this mean the living dead are
invincible? No. Can these creatures be stopped? Yes. Ignorance is the undead’s strongest ally,
knowledge their deadliest enemy. That is why this book was written: to provide the knowledge necessary
for survival against these subhuman beasts.
Survival is the key word to remember—not victory, not conquest, just survival. This book will not teach
you to become a professional zombie hunter. Anyone wishing to devote their life to such a profession

must seek training elsewhere. This book was not written for the police, military, or any government
agency. These organizations, if they choose to recognize and prepare for the threat, will have access to
resources far beyond those of private citizens. It is for them that this survival guide was written—private
citizens, people with limited time and resources who nonetheless have refused to be victimized.
Naturally, many other skills—wilderness survival, leadership, even basic first aid—will be necessary in
any encounter with the living dead. These were not included in this work, as they can be found in
conventional texts. Common sense will dictate what else should be studied to complement this manual.
Subsequently, all subjects not directly related to the living dead have been omitted.
From this book, you will learn to recognize your enemy, to choose the right weapons, about killing
techniques, and about preparation and improvisation when on the defense, on the run, or on the attack. It
will also discuss the possibility of a doomsday scenario, in which the living dead have replaced humanity
as the planet’s dominant species.
Do not discount any section of this book as hypothetical drama. Every ounce of knowledge was
accumulated by hard-won research and experience. Historical data, laboratory experiments, field
research, and eyewitness accounts (including those of the author) have all served to create this work.
Even the doomsday scenario is an extrapolation of true-life events. Many actual occurrences are
chronicled in the chapter of recorded outbreaks. Studying them will prove that every lesson in this book
is rooted in historical fact.
That said, knowledge is only part of the fight for survival. The rest must come from you. Personal choice,
the will to live, must be paramount when the dead begin to rise. Without it, nothing will protect you. On
the last page of this book, ask yourself one question: What will you do—end your existence in passive
acceptance, or stand up and shout, “I will not be their victim! I will survive!” The choice is yours.
THE UNDEAD:  MYTHS AND REALITIES
He comes from the grave, his body a home of worms and filth. No life in his eyes, no warmth of
his skin, no beating of his breast. His soul, as empty and dark as the night sky. He laughs at the
blade, spits at the arrow, for they will not harm his flesh. For eternity, he will walk the earth,
smelling the sweet blood of the living, feasting upon the bones of the damned. Beware, for he is
the living dead.
—OBSCURE HINDU TEXT, CIRCA 1000 B.C.E.
ZOM-BIE: (Zom¢be)n. also ZOM-BIES pl.1. An animated corpse that feeds on living human flesh.
2. A voodoo spell that raises the dead. 3. A Voodoo snake god. 4. One who moves or acts in a
daze “like a zombie.”[a word of West African origin]
What is a zombie? How are they created? What are their strengths and weaknesses? What are their
needs, their desires? Why are they hostile to humanity? Before discussing any survival techniques, you
must first learn what you are trying to survive.
We must begin by separating fact from fiction. The walking dead are neither a work of “black magic” nor

any other supernatural force. Their origin stems from a virus known as Solanum, a Latin word used by
Jan Vanderhaven, who first “discovered” the disease.
SOLANUM: THE VIRUS
Solanum works by traveling through the bloodstream, from the initial point of entry to the brain. Through
means not yet fully understood, the virus uses the cells of the frontal lobe for replication, destroying them
in the process. During this period, all bodily functions cease. By stopping the heart, the infected subject is
rendered “dead.” The brain, however, remains alive but dormant, while the virus mutates its cells into a
completely new organ. The most critical trait of this new organ is its independence from oxygen. By
removing the need for this all-important resource, the undead brain can utilize, but is in no way dependent
upon, the complex support mechanism of the human body. Once mutation is complete, this new organ
reanimates the body into a form that bears little resemblance (physiologically speaking) to the original
corpse. Some bodily functions remain constant, others operate in a modified capacity, and the remainder
shut down completely. This new organism is a zombie, a member of the living dead.
1. SOURCE
Unfortunately, extensive research has yet to find an isolated example of Solanum in nature. Water, air,
and soil in all ecosystems, from all parts of the world, have turned up negative, as have their
accompanying flora and fauna. At the time of this writing, the search continues.
2. SYMPTOMS
The timetable below outlines the process of an infected human (give or take several hours, depending on
the individual).
Hour 1: Pain and discoloration (brown-purple) of the infected area. Immediate clotting of the wound
(provided the infection came from a wound).
Hour 5: Fever (99–103 degrees F), chills, slight dementia, vomiting, acute pain in the joints.
Hour 8: Numbing of extremities and infected area, increased fever (103–106 degrees F), increased
dementia, loss of muscular coordination.
Hour 11: Paralysis in the lower body, overall numbness, slowed heart rate.
Hour 16: Coma.
Hour 20: Heart stoppage. Zero brain activity.
Hour 23: Reanimation.
3. TRANSFERENCE
Solanum is 100 percent communicable and 100 percent fatal. Fortunately for the human race, the virus is
neither waterborne nor airborne. Humans have never been known to contract the virus from elements in
nature. Infection can occur only through direct fluidic contact. A zombie bite, although by far the most
recognizable means of transference, is by no means the only one. Humans have been infected by brushing
their open wounds against those of a zombie or by being splattered by its remains after an explosion.
Ingestion of infected flesh (provided the person has no open mouth sores), however, results in permanent
death rather than infection. Infected flesh has proven to be highly toxic.

No information—historical, experimental, or otherwise—has surfaced regarding the results of sexual
relations with an undead specimen, but as previously noted, the nature of Solanum suggests a high danger
of infection. Warning against such an act would be useless, as the only people deranged enough to try
would be unconcerned for their own safety. Many have argued that, given the congealed nature of
undead bodily fluids, the chances of infection from a non-bite contact should be low. However, it must be
remembered that even one organism is enough to begin the cycle.
4. CROSS-SPECIES INFECTION
Solanum is fatal to all living creatures, regardless of size, species, or ecosystem. Reanimation, however,
takes place only in humans. Studies have shown that Solanum infecting a non-human brain will die within
hours of the death of its host, making the carcass safe to handle. Infected animals expire before the virus
can replicate throughout their bodies. Infection from insect bites such as from mosquitoes can also be
discounted. Experiments have proven that all parasitic insects can sense and will reject an infected host
100 percent of the time.
5. TREATMENT
Once a human is infected, little can be done to save him or her. Because Solanum is a virus and not a
bacteria, antibiotics have no effect. Immunization, the only way to combat a virus, is equally useless, as
even the most minute dosage will lead to a full-blown infection. Genetic research is under way. Goals
range from stronger human antibodies to resistant cell structure to a counter-virus designed to identify and
destroy Solanum. This and other, more radical treatments are still in the earliest stages, with no
foreseeable success in the near future. Battlefield experiences have led to the immediate severing of the
infected limb (provided this is the location of the bite), but such treatments are dubious at best, with less
than a 10 percent success rate. Chances are, the infected human was doomed from the moment the virus
entered his or her system. Should the infected human choose suicide, he should remember that the brain
must be eliminated first. Cases have been recorded in which recently infected subjects, deceased by
means other than the virus, will nonetheless reanimate. Such cases usually occur when the subject expires
after the fifth hour of infection. Regardless, any person killed after being bitten or otherwise infected by
the undead should be immediately disposed of. (See “Disposal.”)
6. REANIMATING THE ALREADY DECEASED
It has been suggested that fresh human corpses could reanimate if Solanum were introduced after their
demise. This is a fallacy. Zombies ignore necrotic flesh and therefore could not transfer the virus.
Experiments conducted during and after World War II (see “Recorded Attacks”) have proven that
injecting Solanum into a cadaver would be futile because a stagnant bloodstream could not transport the
virus to the brain. Injection directly into a dead brain would be equally useless, as the expired cells could
not respond to the virus. Solanum does not create life—it alters it.
ZOMBIE ATTRIBUTES
1. PHYSICAL ABILITIES
Too often, the undead have been said to possess superhuman powers: unusual strength, lightning speed,
telepathy, etc. Stories range from zombies flying through the air to their scaling vertical surfaces like
spiders. While these traits might make for fascinating drama, the individual ghoul is far from a magical,
omnipotent demon. Never forget that the body of the undead is, for all practical purposes, human. What
changes do occur are in the way this new, reanimated body is used by the now-infected brain. There is

no way a zombie could fly unless the human it used to be could fly. The same goes for projecting force
fields, teleportation, moving through solid objects, transforming into a wolf, breathing fire, or a variety of
other mystical talents attributed to the walking dead. Imagine the human body as a tool kit. The
somnambulist brain has those tools, and only those tools, at its disposal. It cannot create new ones out of
thin air. But it can, as you will see, use these tools in unconventional combinations, or push their durability
beyond normal human limits.
A. Sight
The eyes of a zombie are no different than those of a normal human. While still capable (given their rate
of decomposition) of transmitting visual signals to the brain, how the brain interprets these signals is
another matter. Studies are inconclusive regarding the undead’s visual abilities. They can spot prey at
distances comparable to a human, but whether they can distinguish a human from one of their own is still
up for debate. One theory suggests that the movements made by humans, which are quicker and
smoother than those of the undead, is what causes them to stand out to the zombie eye. Experiments
have been done in which humans have attempted to confuse approaching ghouls by mimicking their
motions and adopting a shambling, awkward limp. To date, none of these attempts have succeeded. It
has been suggested that zombies possess night vision, a fact that explains their skill at nocturnal hunting.
This theory has been debunked by the fact that all zombies are expert night feeders, even those without
eyes.
B. Sound
There is no question that zombies have excellent hearing. Not only can they detect sound—they can
determine its direction. The basic range appears to be the same as that for humans. Experiments with
extreme high and low frequencies have yielded negative results. Tests have also shown that zombies are
attracted by any sounds, not just those made by living creatures. It has been recorded that ghouls will
notice sounds ignored by living humans. The most likely, if unproven, explanation is that zombies depend
on all their senses equally. Humans are sight-oriented from birth, depending on other senses only if the
primary one is lost. Perhaps this is not a handicap shared by the walking dead. If so, it would explain
their ability to hunt, fight, and feed in total darkness.
C. Smell
Unlike with sound, the undead have a more acute sense of smell. In both combat situations and
laboratory tests, they have been able to distinguish the smell of living prey above all others. In many
cases, and given ideal wind conditions, zombies have been known to smell fresh corpses from a distance
of more than a mile. Again, this does not mean that ghouls have a greater sense of smell than humans,
simply that they rely on it more. It is not known exactly what particular secretion signals the presence of
prey: sweat, pheromones, blood, etc. In the past, people seeking to move undetected through infested
areas have attempted to “mask” their human scent with perfumes, deodorants, or other strong-smelling
chemicals. None were successful. Experiments are now under way to synthesize the smells of living
creatures as a decoy or even repellent to the walking dead. A successful product is still years away.
D. Taste
Little is known about the altered taste buds of the walking dead. Zombies do have the ability to tell
human flesh apart from that of animals, and they prefer the former. Ghouls also have a remarkable ability
to reject carrion in favor of freshly killed meat. A human body that has been dead longer than twelve to

eighteen hours will be rejected as food. The same goes for cadavers that have been embalmed or
otherwise preserved. Whether this has anything to do with “taste” is not yet certain. It may have to do
with smell or, perhaps, another instinct that has not been discovered. As to exactly why human flesh is
preferable, science has yet to find an answer to this confounding, frustrating, terrifying question.
E. Touch
Zombies have, literally, no physical sensations. All nerve receptors throughout the body remain dead after
reanimation. This is truly their greatest and most terrifying advantage over the living. We, as humans, have
the ability to experience physical pain as a signal of bodily damage. Our brain classifies such sensations,
matches them to the experience that instigated them, and then files the information away for use as a
warning against future harm. It is this gift of physiology and instinct that has allowed us to survive as a
species. It is why we value virtues such as courage, which inspires people to perform actions despite
warnings of danger. The inability to recognize and avoid pain is what makes the walking dead so
formidable. Wounds will not be noticed and, therefore, will not deter an attack. Even if a zombie’s body
is severely damaged, it will continue to attack until nothing remains.
F. Sixth Sense
Historical research, coupled with laboratory and field observation, have shown that the walking dead
have been known to attack even when all their sensory organs have been damaged or completely
decomposed. Does this mean that zombies possess a sixth sense? Perhaps. Living humans use less than 5
percent of their brain capacity. It is possible that the virus can stimulate another sensory ability that has
been forgotten by evolution. This theory is one of the most hotly debated in the war against the undead.
So far, no scientific evidence has been found to support either side.
G. Healing
Despite legends and ancient folklore, undead physiology has been proven to possess no powers of
regeneration. Cells that are damaged stay damaged. Any wounds, no matter what their size and nature,
will remain for the duration of that body’s reanimation. A variety of medical treatments have been
attempted to stimulate the healing process in captured ghouls. None were successful. This inability to
self-repair, something that we as living beings take for granted, is a severe disadvantage to the undead.
For example, every time we physically exert ourselves, we tear our muscles. With time, these muscles
rebuild to a stronger state than before. A ghoul’s muscle mass will remain damaged, reducing its
effectiveness every time it is used.
H. Decomposition
The average zombie “life span”—how long it is able to function before completely rotting away—is
estimated at three to five years. As fantastic as this sounds—a human corpse able to ward off the natural
effects of decay—its cause is rooted in basic biology. When a human body dies, its flesh is immediately
set upon by billions of microscopic organisms. These organisms were always present, in the external
environment and within the body itself. In life, the immune system stood as a barrier between these
organisms and their target. In death, that barrier is removed. The organisms begin multiplying
exponentially as they proceed to eat and, thereby, break down the corpse on a cellular level. The smell
and discoloration associated with any decaying meat are the biological process of these microbes at
work. When you order an “aged” steak, you are ordering a piece of meat that has begun to rot, its
formerly toughened flesh softened by microorganisms breaking down its sturdy fiber. Within a short time,
that steak, like a human corpse, will dissolve to nothing, leaving behind only material too hard or
innutritious for any microbe, such as bone, teeth, nails, and hair. This is the normal cycle of life, nature’s

way of recycling nutrients back into the food chain. To halt this process, and preserve dead tissue, it is
necessary to place it in an environment unsuitable for bacteria, such as in extreme low or high
temperatures, in toxic chemicals such as formaldehyde, or, in this case, to saturate it with Solanum.
Almost all the microbe species involved in normal human decomposition have repeatedly rejected flesh
infected by the virus, effectively embalming the zombie. Were this not the case, combating the living dead
would be as easy as avoiding them for several weeks or even days until they rotted away to bones.
Research has yet to discover the exact cause of this condition. It has been determined that at least some
microbe species ignore the repelling effects of Solanum—otherwise, the undead would remain perfectly
preserved forever. It has also been determined that natural conditions such as moisture and temperature
play an important role as well. Undead that prowl the bayous of Louisiana are unlikely to last as long as
those in the cold, dry Gobi desert. Extreme situations, such as deep freezing or immersion in preservative
fluid, could, hypothetically, allow an undead specimen to exist indefinitely. These techniques have been
known to allow zombies to function for decades, if not centuries. (See “Recorded Attacks.”)
Decomposition does not mean that a member of the walking dead will simply drop. Decay may affect
various parts of the body at different times. Specimens have been found with brains intact but nearly
disintegrated bodies. Others with partially rotted brains may control some bodily functions but be
completely paralyzed in others. A popular theory has recently circulated that attempts to explain the story
of the ancient Egyptian mummy as one of the first examples of an embalmed zombie. The preservation
techniques allowed it to function several thousand years after being entombed. Anyone with a
rudimentary knowledge of ancient Egypt would find this story almost laughably untrue: The most
important and complicated step in preparing a pharaoh for burial was the removal of the brain!
I. Digestion
Recent evidence has once and for all discounted the theory that human flesh is the fuel for the undead. A
zombie’s digestive tract is completely dormant. The complex system that processes food, extracts
nutrition, and excretes waste does not factor into a zombie’s physiology. Autopsies conducted on
neutralized undead have shown that their “food” lies in its original, undigested state at all sections of the
tract. This partially chewed, slowly rotting matter will continue to accumulate, as the zombie devours
more victims, until it is forced through the anus, or literally bursts through the stomach or intestinal lining.
While this more dramatic example of non-digestion is rare, hundreds of eyewitness reports have
confirmed undead to have distended bellies. One captured and dissected specimen was found to contain
211 pounds of flesh within its system! Even rarer accounts have confirmed that zombies continue to feed
long after their digestive tracts have exploded from within.
J. Respiration
The lungs of the undead continue to function in that they draw air into and expel it from the body. This
function accounts for a zombie’s signature moan. What the lungs and body chemistry fail to accomplish,
however, is to extract oxygen and remove carbon dioxide. Given that Solanum obviates the need for
both of these functions, the entire human respiratory system is obsolete in the body of a ghoul. This
explains how the living dead can “walk underwater” or survive in environments lethal to humans. Their
brains, as noted earlier, are oxygen-independent.
K. Circulation
It would be inaccurate to say that zombies have no heart. It would not be inaccurate, however, to say
that they find no use for it. The circulatory system of the undead is little more than a network of useless
tubes filled with congealed blood. The same applies to the lymphatic system as well as all other bodily
fluids. Although this mutation would appear to give the undead one more advantage over humanity, it has
actually proved to be a godsend. The lack of fluid mass prevents easy transmission of the virus. Were this

not true, hand-to-hand combat would be nearly impossible, as the defending human would almost
certainly be splattered with blood and/or other fluids.
L. Reproduction
Zombies are sterile creatures. Their sexual organs are necrotic and impotent. Attempts have been made
to fertilize zombie eggs with human sperm and vice versa. None has been successful. The undead have
also shown no signs of sexual desire, either for their own species or for the living. Until research can
prove otherwise, humanity’s greatest fear—the dead reproducing the dead—is a comforting
impossibility.
M. Strength
Ghouls possess the same brute force as the living. What power can be exerted depends greatly on the
individual zombie. What muscle mass a person has in life would be all he possesses in death. Unlike a
living body, adrenal glands have not been known to function in the dead, denying zombies the temporary
burst of power we humans enjoy. The one solid advantage the living dead do possess is amazing stamina.
Imagine working out, or any other act of physical exertion. Chances are that pain and exhaustion will
dictate your limits. These factors do not apply to the dead. They will continue an act, with the same
dynamic energy, until the muscles supporting it literally disintegrate. While this makes for progressively
weaker ghouls, it allows for an all-powerful first attack. Many barricades that would have exhausted
three or even four physically fit humans have fallen to a single determined zombie.
N. Speed
The “walking” dead tend to move at a slouch or limp. Even without injuries or advanced decomposition,
their lack of coordination makes for an unsteady stride. Speed is mainly determined by leg length. Taller
ghouls have longer strides than their shorter counterparts. Zombies appear to be incapable of running.
The fastest have been observed to move at a rate of barely one step per 1.5 seconds. Again, as with
strength, the dead’s advantage over the living is their tirelessness. Humans who believe they have outrun
their undead pursuers might do well to remember the story of the tortoise and the hare, adding, of course,
that in this instance the hare stands a good chance of being eaten alive.
O. Agility
The average living human possesses a dexterity level 90 percent greater than the strongest ghoul. Some
of this comes from the general stiffness of necrotic muscle tissue (hence their awkward stride). The rest is
due to their primitive brain functions. Zombies have little hand-eye coordination, one of their greatest
weaknesses. No one has ever observed a zombie jumping, either from one spot to another or simply up
and down. Balancing on a narrow surface is similarly beyond their ability. Swimming is also a skill
reserved for the living. The theory has been put forth that, if an undead corpse were to be bloated enough
to rise to the surface, it could present a floating hazard. This is rare, however, as the slow rate of
decomposition would not allow by-product gas to accumulate. Zombies who walk or fall into bodies of
water will more likely find themselves wandering aimlessly across the bottom until eventually dissolving.
They can be successful climbers, but only in certain circumstances. If zombies perceive prey above them,
for example, in the second story of a house, they will always attempt to climb to it. Zombies will try to
scale any surface no matter how unfeasible or even impossible. In all but the easiest situations, these
attempts have met with failure. Even in the case of ladders, when simple hand-over-hand coordination is
required, only one in four zombies will succeed.
2. BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS

A. Intelligence
It has been proven, time and again, that our greatest advantage over the undead is our ability to think.
The mental capacity of the average zombie ranks somewhere beneath that of an insect. On no occasion
have they shown any ability to reason or employ logic. Attempting to accomplish a task, failing, then by
trial and error discovering a new solution, is a skill shared by many members of the animal kingdom but
lost on the walking dead. Zombies have repeatedly failed laboratory intelligence tests set at the level of
rodents. One field case showed a human standing at one end of a collapsed bridge with several dozen
zombies on the other side. One by one, the walking dead tumbled over the edge in a futile attempt to
reach him. At no time did any of them realize what was happening and change their tactics in any way.
Contrary to myth and speculation, zombies have never been observed using tools of any kind. Even
picking up a rock to use as a weapon is beyond their grasp. This simple task would prove the basic
thought process involved in realizing that the rock is a more efficient weapon than the naked hand.
Ironically, the age of artificial intelligence has enabled us to identify more easily with the mind of the
zombie than that of our more “primitive” ancestors. With rare exceptions, even the most advanced
computers do not have the ability to think on their own. They do what they are programmed to do,
nothing more. Imagine a computer programmed to execute one function. This function cannot be paused,
modified, or erased. No new data can be stored. No new commands can be installed. This computer will
perform that one function, over and over, until its power source eventually shuts down. This is the zombie
brain. An instinct-driven, unitask machine that is impervious to tampering and can only be destroyed.
B. Emotions
Feelings of any kind are not known to the walking dead. Every form of psychological warfare, from
attempts at enraging the undead to provoking pity have all met with disaster. Joy, sadness, confidence,
anxiety, love, hatred, fear—all of these feelings and thousands more that make up the human “heart” are
as useless to the living dead as the organ of the same name. Who knows if this is humanity’s greatest
weakness or strength? The debate continues, and probably will forever.
C. Memories
A modern conceit is that a zombie retains the knowledge of its former life. We hear stories of the dead
returning to their places of residence or work, operating familiar machinery, or even showing acts of
mercy to loved ones. In truth, not a shred of proof exists to support this wishful thinking. Zombies could
not possibly retain memories of their former lives in either the conscious or subconscious mind, because
neither exist! A ghoul will not be distracted by the family pet, living relatives, familiar surroundings, etc.
No matter who a person was in his former life, that person is gone, replaced by a mindless automaton
with no instinct other than for feeding. This begs the question: Why do zombies prefer urban areas to the
countryside? First, the undead do not prefer cities, but simply remain where they are reanimated.
Second, the main reason zombies tend to stay in cities instead of fanning out into the countryside is
because an urban zone holds the highest concentration of prey.
D. Physical Needs
Other than hunger (discussed later), the dead have shown none of the physical wants or needs expressed
in mortal life. Zombies have never been observed to sleep or rest under any circumstances. They have
not reacted to extreme heat or cold. In harsh weather, they have never sought shelter. Even something as
simple as thirst is unknown to the living dead. Defying all laws of science, Solanum has created what
could be described as a completely self-sufficient organism.
E. Communication

Zombies have no language skills. Although their vocal cords are capable of speech, their brain is not. The
only vocal ability appears to be a deep-throated moan. This moan is released when zombies identify
prey. The sound will remain low and steady until physical contact is made. It will then shift in tone and
volume as the zombie commences its attack. This eerie sound, so typically associated with the walking
dead, serves as a rallying cry for other zombies and, as has been recently discovered, is a potent
psychological weapon. (See “On the Defense.”)
F. Social Dynamics
Theories have always proliferated that the undead function as a collective force, from an army controlled
by Satan to an insect-like pheromone-driven hive to the most recent notion that they achieve group
consensus by telepathy. The truth is that zombies have no social organization to speak of. There is no
hierarchy, no chain of command, no drive toward any type of collectivization. A horde of the undead,
regardless of size, regardless of appearance, is simply a mass of individuals. If several hundred ghouls
converge on a victim’s location, it is because each one is drawn by its own instinct. Zombies appear to
be unaware of one another. Individuals have never been observed to react to the sight of one another at
any range. This goes back to the question of sense: How does a zombie distinguish between one of its
own and a human or other prey at the same range? The answer has yet to be found. Zombies do avoid
one another in the same way they avoid inanimate objects. When they bump into one another, they make
no attempt to connect or communicate. Zombies feasting on the same corpse will tug repeatedly on the
meat in question rather than shove a competitor out of the way. The only suggestion of communal effort is
seen in notorious swarm attacks: the moan of a ghoul calling others within earshot. Once they hear the
wail, other walking dead will almost always converge on its source. An early study theorized that this was
a deliberate act, that a scout used its moan to signal the others to attack. However, we now know that it
happens purely by accident. The ghoul that moans at the detection of prey does so as an instinctive
reaction, not as an alert.
G. Hunting
Zombies are migratory organisms, with no regard for territory or concept of home. They will travel miles
and perhaps, given time, cross continents in their search for food. Their hunting pattern is random. Ghouls
will feed at night and during the day. They will stumble through an area rather than deliberately searching
it. Certain zones or structures will not be singled out as more likely to contain prey. For example, some
have been known to search farmhouses and other rural structures while others in the same group have
moved by without even a glance. Urban zones take more time to explore, which is why the undead
remain longer in these areas, but no building will take precedence over another. Zombies appear to be
totally unaware of their surroundings. They do not, for example, move their eyes in a way that would take
in the information of a new setting. Shuffling silently, with a thousand-yard stare, they will wander
aimlessly, regardless of location, until prey is detected. As discussed earlier, the undead possess an
uncanny ability to home in on a victim’s precise location. Once contact is made, the previously silent,
oblivious automaton transforms into something more closely related to a guided missile. The head turns
immediately in the direction of its victim. The jaw drops, lips retract, and, from the depths of its
diaphragm, comes the moan. Once contact is made, zombies cannot be distracted by any means. They
will continue to pursue their prey, stopping only if they lose contact, make a successful kill, or are
destroyed.
H. Motivation
Why do the undead prey upon the living? If it has been proven that human flesh serves no nutritional
purpose, why does their instinct drive them to murder? The truth eludes us. Modern science, combined
with historical data, has shown that living humans are not the only delights on the undead menu. Rescue
teams entering an infested area have consistently reported them stripped of all life. Any creatures, no

matter what their size or species, will be consumed by an attacking zombie. Human flesh, however, will
always be preferable to other life forms. One experiment presented a captured specimen with two
identical cubes of meat: one human, one animal. The zombie repeatedly chose the human. Reasons for
this are still unknown. What can be confirmed, beyond any shadow of doubt, is that instinct brought on
by Solanum drives the undead to kill and devour any living creature they discover. There appear to be no
exceptions.
I. Killing the Dead
While destroying a zombie may be simple, it is far from easy. As we have seen, zombies require none of
the physiological functions that humans need to survive. Destruction or severe damage of the circulatory,
digestive, or respiratory system would do nothing to a member of the walking dead, as these functions no
longer support the brain. Simply put, there are thousands of ways to kill a human—and only one to kill a
zombie. The brain must be obliterated, by any means possible.
J. Disposal
Studies have shown that Solanum can still inhabit the body of a terminated zombie for up to forty-eight
hours. Exercise extreme care when disposing of undead corpses. The head in particular possesses the
most serious hazard, given its concentration of the virus. Never handle an undead corpse without
protective clothing. Treat it as you would any toxic, highly lethal material. Cremation is the safest, most
effective way of disposal. Despite rumors that a pile of burning corpses will spread Solanum in a cloud of
smoking plague, common sense would dictate that any virus is unable to survive intense heat, to say
nothing of an open flame.
K. Domestication?
To reiterate, the zombie brain has proved, so far, to be tamper-proof. Experiments ranging from
chemicals to surgery to electromagnetic waves have yielded negative results. Behavioral modification
therapy and other such attempts to train the living dead like some kind of pack animal have similarly met
with failure. Again, the machine cannot be rewired. It will exist as is, or it will not exist at all.
THE VOODOO ZOMBIE
If zombies are the creation of a virus and not black magic, then how does this explain the so-called
“voodoo zombie,” a person who has died, been raised from his grave, and is doomed to spend eternity
as a slave of the living? Yes, it is true that the word “zombie” originally comes from the Kimbundu word
“nzúmbe,” a term describing a dead person’s soul, and yes, zombies and zombification are integral parts
of the Afro-Caribbean religion known as voodoo. However, the origin of their name is the only similarity
between the voodoo zombie and the viral zombie. Although it is said that voodoo houngans (priests) can
turn humans into zombies by magical means, the practice is rooted in hard, undeniable science. “Zombie
powder,” the tool used by the houngan for zombification, contains a very powerful neurotoxin (the exact
ingredients are a closely guarded secret). The toxin temporarily paralyzes the human nervous system,
creating a state of extreme hibernation. With the heart, lungs, and all other bodily functions operating at
minimal levels, it would be understandable if an inexperienced coroner declared the paralyzed subject to
be dead. Many humans have been buried while in such a state, only to awaken screaming in the pitch
darkness of their coffin. So what makes this living human being a zombie? The answer is simple: brain
damage. Many who are buried alive quickly use up the air inside their coffins. Those that are recovered
(if they are lucky) almost always suffer brain damage from lack of oxygen. These poor souls shamble
about with little cognitive skills, or, indeed, free will, and are often mistaken for the living dead. How can
you distinguish a voodoo zombie from the genuine article? The telltale signs are obvious.

These guidelines should give you a good idea of how to tell a voodoo zombie from a true zombie. One
final note: Voodoo zombies are almost always encountered in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean,
Central and South America, and the southern United States. Although it is not impossible to find
someone who has been turned into a zombie by a houngan elsewhere, the chances of such an encounter
are slim.
THE HOLLYWOOD ZOMBIE
Since the living dead first stepped onto the silver screen, their greatest enemy has not been hunters, but
critics. Scholars, scientists, even concerned citizens have all argued that these movies depict the living
dead in a fantastic, unrealistic fashion. Visually stunning weapons, physically impossible action sequences,
larger-than-life human characters, and, above all, magical, invincible, even comical ghouls have all added
their colors to the controversial rainbow that is “the Zombie Movie.” Further criticism argues that this
“style over substance” approach to somnambulist cinema teaches human viewers lessons that may get
them killed in a real encounter. These serious charges demand an equally serious defense. While some
zombie movies are based on actual events*, their goal, indeed the goal of almost every movie in every
genre, has always been, first and foremost, to entertain. Unless we are discussing pure documentaries
(and even some of those are “sweetened”), moviemakers must take some artistic license to make their
work more palatable to the audience. Even movies that are based on actual events will sacrifice pure
reality for good storytelling. Certain characters will be an amalgam of real-life individuals. Others may be
purely fictional in order to explain certain facts, facilitate the plotline, or simply add flavor to the scene.
One might argue that the role of the artist is to challenge, educate, and enlighten her audience. That may
be true, but try imparting knowledge to an audience who has either left or fallen asleep within the first ten
minutes of the picture. Accept this basic rule of moviemaking and you will understand why Hollywood
zombie films stray, in some cases wildly, from the reality on which they are based. In short, use these
photo-plays as their makers intended: as a source of temporary, lighthearted entertainment and not a
visual aid to your survival.
OUTBREAKS
Although each zombie attack is different, given the number, terrain, reaction of the general populace, etc.,
its level of intensity can be measured in four distinct classes.
CLASS 1
This is a low-level outbreak, usually in a Third World country or First World rural area. The number of
zombies in this class of outbreak ranges between one and twenty. Total human casualties (including those
infected) range from one to fifty. The total duration, from the first case to the last (known), will range
between twenty-four hours and fourteen days. The infested area will be small, no larger than a
twenty-mile radius. In many cases, natural boundaries will determine its limits. Response will be light,
either exclusively civilian or with some additional help from local law enforcement. Media coverage will
be light, if present at all. If the media is present, look for common stories like homicides or “accidents.”
This is the most common type of outbreak and also the easiest to go unnoticed.
CLASS 2
Urban or densely populated rural areas are included in this level of outbreak. Total zombies will range
between twenty and one hundred. Total human casualties may reach as high as several hundred. The
duration of a Class 2 attack may last no longer than a Class 1 outbreak. In some cases, the larger

number of zombies will spark a more immediate response. A rural, sparsely populated outbreak may
extend to a hundred-mile radius, while an urban outbreak may encompass only several blocks.
Suppression will almost certainly be organized. Bands of civilians will be replaced by local, state, even
federal law enforcement. Look for an additional, if low-level, military response, the National Guard in the
United States or its equivalent abroad. Most often, so as to ease panic, these units will take a more
noncombatant role, providing medical assistance, crowd control, and logistical support. Class 2
outbreaks almost always attract the press. Unless the attack occurs in a truly isolated area of the world,
or one where the media is strictly controlled, the story will be reported. This does not mean, however,
that it will be reported accurately.
CLASS 3
A true crisis. Class 3 outbreaks, more than any other, demonstrate the clear threat posed by the living
dead. Zombies will number in the thousands, encompassing an area of several hundred miles. The
duration of the attack and a possible lengthy mop-up process could last as long as several months. There
will be no chance for a press blackout or cover-up. Even without media attention, the sheer magnitude of
the attack will leave too many eyewitnesses. This is a full-blown battle, with law enforcement replaced by
units of the regular military. A state of emergency will be declared for the infested zone, as well as the
neighboring areas. Expect martial law, restricted travel, rationed supplies, federalized services, and
strictly monitored communication. All these measures, however, will take time to implement. The initial
phase will be one of chaos as those in power come to grips with the crisis. Riots, looting, and widespread
panic will add to their difficulties, further delaying an effective response. While this is happening, those
living within the infested area will be at the mercy of the undead. Isolated, abandoned, and surrounded by
ghouls, they will have only themselves to depend on.
CLASS 4
(See “Living in an Undead World.”)
DETECTION
Every undead outbreak, regardless of its class, has a beginning. Now that the enemy has been defined,
the next step is early warning. Knowing what a zombie is will not help if you are unable to recognize an
outbreak before it’s too late. This does not entail building a “zombie command post” in your basement,
sticking pins in a map, and huddling around the shortwave radio. All it requires is looking for signs that
would slip by the untrained mind. These signs include:

Once an event has tripped your sensors, keep track of it. Note the location, and its distance from you.
Watch for similar incidents around or near the original site. If, within a few days or weeks, these incidents
do occur, study them carefully. Note the response of law enforcement and other government agencies. If
they react more forcefully with each occurrence, chances are that an outbreak is unfolding.
WEAPONS AND COMBAT TECHNIQUES
At least fifteen or twenty of them; men, women, children. We opened up at seventy, maybe eighty
meters. I could see chunks of flesh blasting off their bodies. Our rounds were hitting their mark!
They kept coming, they just kept coming! I sighted one and let go a full burst from my BXP. I
know I snapped his spine, because the man dropped like a leaf. Legs still twitching, he kept
crawling after me! At twenty meters, we opened up with the Vektor. Nothing! I watched bits of
organ and bone blown out their backs. I watched limbs literally sawed off at the joints. The SS77
is the best MG ever made, 840 meters per second, 800 rounds per minute, and it wasn’t doing a
goddamn thing! What grenades we had only downed one of them. One! His mangled body lay
motionless with a still-snapping head![Name Withheld]let go with his RPG. The damn rocket went
right through its soft target and took out a rock behind it! Finally, at five meters, we used the last
bit of fuel in the flamethrower! The sons of bitches lit up like torches but just wouldn’t stop! One
of them grabbed [Name Withheld],setting him on fire as it bit through his neck. I saw the rest of
those things surround him as we took off for the jungle, a mob of burning bodies squatting down
to tear another screaming human torch apart. Goddamn the devil’s mother, what the hell were
we supposed to do!?!
—SERBIAN MERCENARY DURING THEZAIRIAN CIVIL WAR,1994
Choosing the right weapons (never carry just one) can make the difference between a pile of dead
zombies and becoming one yourself. When confronted with the undead, it is easy to believe in the
super-commando strategy: Load up with the heaviest, most powerful weapons possible and go out to
“kick ass.” This is not only foolish—it is suicidal. Zombies are not camp guards in some POW escape
movie, crumbling en masse with the first theatrical volley. Arming yourself for a zombie encounter
requires careful consideration, a cool head, and a practical analysis of all factors involved.

CLOSE COMBAT
Hand-to-hand combat should almost always be avoided. Given a zombie’s lack of speed, it is much
easier to run (or walk quickly) than stand and fight. However, it may be necessary to destroy a zombie at
close quarters. When this happens, split-second timing is critical. A wrong move, a moment’s hesitation,
and you may feel cold hands gripping your arm, or sharp, broken teeth biting into your flesh. For this
reason above all, choosing a close-combat weapon is more important than any other in this section.
1. BLUDGEONS
When using a blunt weapon, the goal is to crush the brain (remember, the only way to kill a zombie is by
destroying its brain). This is not as easy as it sounds. The human skull is one of the hardest, most durable
surfaces in nature. So, of course, is the zombie’s. Extreme force is needed to fracture, let alone shatter it.
However, this must be done, and done with a single, well-placed blow. Missing your target or failing to
breach the bone will leave you with no second chance.
Sticks, ax handles, and other wooden clubs are good for knocking a zombie out of the way or beating off
an individual attack. What they lack is the weight and strength necessary for a lethal strike. A section of
lead pipe will work for a single encounter but is too heavy for those on the move. A sledgehammer has
the same drawback and also requires practice for its user to hit a moving target. Aluminum bats are light
enough to work for one, maybe two fights, but are known to bend after prolonged use. The standard,
one-handed carpenter’s hammer has striking power but severely limited reach. Its short handle allows a
zombie to grab your arm and pull it in. The police baton, made of acetate plastic (in most cases), is strong
enough for any battle but lacks the lethal power for a one-blow kill. (Note: This was intended in its
design.)
The best bludgeon is a steel crowbar. Its relatively lightweight and durable construction makes it ideal for
prolonged close combat. Its curved, semi-sharpened edge also allows for a stabbing motion through the
eye socket, directly into the brain case. More than one survivor has reported killing zombies in this
manner. Another benefit of the crowbar is that it may be necessary to pry open a door, shift a heavy
object, or perform other tasks for which it was originally designed. None of these functions can be
accomplished with any of the previously mentioned items. Even lighter and more durable than the steel
crowbar is the titanium model, now trickling into Western markets from Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union.
2. EDGED WEAPONS
Blades, in any form, have advantages and disadvantages over bludgeons. Those that have enough
strength to split the skull rarely stand up after many repetitions. For this reason, slicing, particularly
decapitation, serves almost the same function as a head blow. (Note: The severed head of a zombie is
still able to bite and must be regarded as a threat.) The advantage of slicing over bludgeoning is that it can
make killing a zombie unnecessary. In some cases, simply chopping off a limb or severing the spine is
enough to disable an undead assailant. (Note: Severing a limb also brings the possibility of contact with
the virus through the exposed area.)
The civilian ax can easily crush a zombie’s skull, smashing through bone and brain in one swing.
Decapitation is equally easy, which is why the ax has been the favored tool of executioners for centuries.

Connecting with a moving head, however, might be difficult. Furthermore, if the swing ends in a total
miss, you might be taken off balance.
The smaller, one-handed hatchet is a good weapon of last resort. If you find yourself cornered, and
larger weapons are useless, a hatchet blow will more than take care of an attacker.
The sword is the ideal edged weapon, but not every kind will suffice. Foils, rapiers, and similar fencing
weapons are not suited for slicing. Their only possible use would be a direct stab through the eye socket
followed by a quick swirling action through the brain. This motion, however, has been accomplished only
once, by a trained swordsman, and is therefore not recommended.
Single-handed long swords allow you a free hand for other tasks such as opening a door or defending
your body with a shield. Their only drawback is the lack of swinging power. One arm may not have the
strength to slice through the thick cartilage between bones. Another drawback is its user’s notorious lack
of accuracy. Scoring a flesh wound anywhere on the body of a living opponent is one thing. Making an
exact, clean chop through the neck is something else altogether.
Double-handed swords could be considered the best in their class, providing the strength and accuracy
for perfect decapitation. Of this type, the Japanese Samurai Katana ranks first. Its weight (three to five
pounds) is perfect for long-term conflicts, and its blade can sever the toughest organic fiber.
In tight quarters, shorter blades hold the advantage. The Roman Gladius is one choice, although
combat-ready replicas are hard to find. The Japanese Ninjite boasts a two-handed grip and, in genuine
models, renowned tempered steel. Both factors make it a superior weapon. The common machete,
because of its size, weight, and availability, is probably your best choice. If possible, find the military type
usually sold at Army surplus stores. Its steel tends to be of a higher quality, and its blackened blade helps
concealment at night.
3. MISCELLANEOUS HAND WEAPONS
Spears, pikes, and tridents serve to skewer a zombie, keeping it out of reach but not necessarily scoring
a kill. The chance of an eye-socket stab is possible, but remote. The medieval European halberd (an
ax-spear hybrid) may serve as a chopping weapon but, again, requires great amounts of skill and practice
to accomplish a decapitating blow. Other than using them as bludgeons, or keeping your attacker at a
distance, these weapons serve little purpose.
Morning stars or “flails,” a spiked ball chained to a rod, do basically the same damage as a crowbar,
albeit in a more dramatic way. The owner swings the rod in a wide, circular motion, providing enough
momentum to bring the ball crashing through the skull of his or her opponent. Using this weapon takes
considerable skill, and it is therefore not recommended.
The medieval European mace serves the same function as the standard household hammer but without
benefit of the latter’s practical uses. A mace cannot pry open a door or window, drive a chisel, or
hammer a nail. Attempting such an act could result in accidental injury. Therefore, carry this medieval
weapon only when no alternative is available.
Knives are always useful, serving a variety of functions in a range of situations. Unlike a hatchet, they can
kill a zombie only when the blade is stabbed through the temple, eye socket, or base of the skull. On the
flip side, knives almost always weigh less than hatchets and, therefore, are better if you are on the move.
When choosing a knife, make sure the blade is no more than six inches long and always smooth. Avoid
serrated knives and saw-blade combinations found in survival knives, as they tend to become lodged in
their victims. Imagine yourself stabbing one zombie through the temple and turning to engage the other

three ghouls but not being able to retrieve your blade.
The trench spike is, without a doubt, the best compact anti-zombie weapon on earth. It is a combination
of a seven-inch steel spike for a blade and brass knuckles for a handle. It was developed during the
vicious hand-to-hand combat of World War I, where soldiers killed each other in trenches no wider than
a few feet. Specifically, it was designed to stab downward, through an enemy’s steel helmet. You can
imagine how effective this weapon would be against a zombie. The user could stab easily through a
zombie’s skull, withdraw cleanly and quickly, then turn to either brain another zombie or, at the very
least, knock one over with a brass-knuckle punch to the face. Original models are extremely rare, with
barely a few remaining in museums and the homes of private collectors. However, if accurate, detailed
schematics can be found, have one or perhaps two combat-ready, stress-tested replicas made. They will
be an investment you will never regret.
The Shaolin Spade
This weapon bears special mention in the anti-ghoul arsenal. It may appear unconventional: a six-foot
hardwood staff with a flat, bell-shaped blade on one end and an outward-facing crescent blade on the
other. Its roots date back to a bronze-bladed agricultural tool used during the Chinese Shang Dynasty
(1766–1122 B.C.E.). When Buddhism migrated to China, the spade was adopted by Shaolin monks as
both tool and weapon. On several occasions, it has proven to be surprisingly effective against the living
dead. Thrusting forward with either blade will produce instant decapitation, while its length provides
complete safety for the user. This length does make it impractical for indoor combat, and it should
therefore be avoided in those situations. In open spaces, however, nothing combines the safety of a spear
with the killing power of a katana sword like the Shaolin spade.
A variety of other hand weapons exist around the world, and space does not permit the author to discuss
each one individually. If you discover an implement or tool that you think might make a good weapon,
ask yourself these questions:

Questions 3, 4, and 5 will have to depend on your present situation. Questions 1 and 2 are essential!
4. POWERTOOLS
Popular fiction has shown us the awesome, brutal power of the chainsaw. Its lightning-quick, rotating
teeth can easily slice through flesh and bone, making the strength and skill required for manual weapons
unnecessary. Its roar might also give the owner a much-needed psychological boost—empowerment in a
situation where abject terror is a given. How many horror movies have you seen in which this industrial
killing machine has spelled doom for anyone and anything it touched? In reality, however, chainsaws and
similar powered devices rank extremely low on the list of practical zombie-killing weapons. For starters,
their fuel supply is finite. Once drained, they provide as much protection as a hand-held stereo. Carrying
extra fuel or power cells leads to the second inherent problem: weight. The average chainsaw weighs ten
pounds, compared to a two-pound machete. Why increase the chances of exhaustion? Safety must also
be considered. One slip, and the spinning teeth might be slicing through your skull just as easily as your
enemy’s. Like any machine, another problem is noise. A chainsaw’s distinctive roar, even if running for
just a few seconds, will be enough to broadcast to every zombie within earshot, “Dinner is served!”

SLINGS AND ARROWS
It is a commonly held notion that using non-firearm ballistics such as bows and slingshots are a waste of
energy and resources. In most cases, this is true. However, if used properly, such a weapon will enable
you to score a kill at long range with little or no sound. What if you’re attempting to escape an infested
area, you turn a corner, and a single ghoul blocks your path? It’s too far away for a hand weapon.
Before you get close, its moans will betray your position. The crack of a firearm will sound an even
louder alarm. What do you do? In cases like these, certain silent weapons may be your only option.
1. THE SLING
Made famous from the biblical story of David and Goliath, this weapon has been part of our heritage
since prehistoric times. The user places a smooth, round stone in the wider center of a thin leather strip,
grabs both ends, swings it repeatedly in a rapid circle, then releases one end of the strip, loosing the stone
at his target. Theoretically, it is possible to dispatch a zombie with a silent headshot at just under thirty
paces. However, even with months of training, the chances of scoring such a hit are one in ten at best.
With no experience, the wielder would be better off just throwing stones.
2. THE SLINGSHOT
A descendant of the leather strap, the modern slingshot has at least ten times the accuracy of its ancestor,
the sling. What it lacks is punch. Small projectiles fired from a modern slingshot simply do not have the
force, even at minimum range, to penetrate a zombie’s skull. Using this weapon might serve only to alert
a ghoul to your presence.
3. THE BLOWGUN
Given that poison has no effect on the undead, discount this weapon entirely.
4. SHURIKEN
These small, multipoint devices were used in feudal Japan to pierce a human skull. In appearance they
resemble a steel, two-dimensional replica of a shining star, hence their nickname, “throwing stars.” In
expert hands, they could easily bring down a zombie. However, as with many weapons discussed, the
throwing star requires great expertise. Unless you are one of the few masters of this art (only a handful
can still claim this title), refrain from such an exotic method.
5. THROWING KNIVES
As with shuriken, these short-range weapons require weeks of practice to hit something as large as a
human body and months to hit something as small as a human head. Only a dedicated expert could even
hope for a reliable zombie kill. The time and energy spent training could be much more productive if
applied to a conventional weapon. Remember, you have a variety of skills to learn, and not all the time in
the world to learn them. Don’t waste those valuable hours attempting to master a third-rate weapon.
6. THE LONG OR COMPOUND BOW
To be blunt, hitting a zombie through the head with an arrow is an extremely difficult feat. Even with
compound bows and modern sights, only experienced archers have a chance of making a direct shot.
The only practical use for this weapon is the delivery of incendiary arrows. For starting fires silently, at
long distance, nothing works better than a flaming arrow. This manner of attack can, and has, been used
to set undead individuals on fire. The targeted zombie will not know enough to pull the arrow from its
body and might, given the right circumstances, burn other ghouls before succumbing to the flames. (See

“Fire,” for appropriate use.)
7. THE CROSSBOW
The power and accuracy of a modern crossbow can send a “bolt” (crossbow arrow) clean through a
zombie’s skull at over a quarter mile. Small wonder it has been dubbed “the perfect silent killer.”
Marksmanship is important, but no more so than with a rifle. Reloading requires time and strength, but
this should be unnecessary. The crossbow is a sniper’s weapon, not a crowd-stopper. Use only against
one zombie. Any more, and you might find yourself grabbed and mauled before you have time to load
another bolt. As for bolts, either triangular or bullet-shape will suffice. For increased accuracy, a
telescopic sight should be added. Unfortunately, the size and weight of any good crossbow will make it
the primary weapon. Therefore, choose one only when the situation permits, such as traveling in a group,
defending your home, or when no silenced firearms are available.
8. THE HANDBOW
Smaller, one-handed crossbows can serve as a complement to your primary weapon. Carrying one
means that a compact, silent weapon will always be on hand if needed. In comparison to the larger
crossbow, hand bows have inferior accuracy, power, and range. Using one means getting closer to the
target. This increases not only the danger but the risk of detection, which, in turn, negates the need for a
silent weapon. Use the hand bow carefully, and sparingly.
FIREARMS
Of all the weapons discussed in this book, nothing is more important than your primary firearm. Keep it
cleaned, keep it oiled, keep it loaded, keep it close. With a cool head, steady hand, and plenty of
ammunition, one human is more than a match for an army of zombies.
Choosing a firearm must be an exact science, with every variable considered. What is your primary goal:
defense, attack, or flight? What outbreak class are you facing? How many people, if any, are in your
group? What environment is your battleground? Different firearms serve different functions. Almost none
serve all. Selecting the perfect tools means dispelling conventional doctrines of warfare that have worked
so well against our fellow humans. Sadly, we know all too well how to kill each other. Killing
zombies—that’s another story.
1. THE HEAVY MACHINE GUN
Since World War I, this invention has revolutionized human conflict. Its mechanism allows a storm of lead
to be discharged in seconds. These tactics may be invaluable on the human battlefield but are a feckless
waste against the living dead. Remember, you are going for a head shot: one bullet, precisely placed. As
the machine gun is designed for saturation fire, it may take hundreds, even thousands of rounds for one,
randomly lethal shot. Even aiming the machine gun as a rifle (a tactic used by U.S. special forces) is a
losing proposition. Why hit a zombie with a well-aimed five-round burst when one well-aimed rifle shot
produces the same result? In the 1970s, one school of thought favored the “scythe theory”: If a machine
gun is placed at the head level of an undead crowd, it could mow them down with one long burst. This
argument has been debunked—ghouls, like the humans they used to be, are not all the same height. Even
if some are destroyed, at least half will survive to close on your position. But what about the massive
body damage caused by these weapons? Won’t a machine gun have enough punch to rip a body in half,
and doesn’t that negate the need for a head shot? Yes and no. The standard 5.56-millimeter round used
by the U.S. Army SAW (Squad Automatic Weapon) does have the ability to snap a human spine, sever

limbs, or yes, tear a zombie’s form in two. This, however, does not mean a head shot is unnecessary. For
one, the chance of dismembering a zombie is slight and therefore requires large amounts of ammunition.
For another, unless the brain is destroyed, the zombie itself is still alive—crippled, yes, perhaps even
immobile, but still alive. Why give yourself the unnecessary need of having to finish off a mass of writhing
and potentially dangerous body parts?
2. THE SUB-MACHINE GUN
The problem presented by this weapon is similar to that of the heavy machine gun: ammo expended
versus living dead dispatched. However, when fighting in tight quarters, the submachine gun finds its
niche. The short barrel makes it easier to handle than a rifle, but the folding stock gives it much more
support than a pistol. Always be sure to keep it on the single-shot setting. As we discussed, full auto is
simply a waste of ammo. Also, be sure to aim it from the shoulder. Shooting from the hip will produce
nothing more than a loud noise and a clean miss. One disadvantage is poor accuracy at long range.
Because the submachine gun was designed as a close-combat weapon, you will have to get much closer
to a zombie than if you were carrying a rifle or assault weapon. This would normally not be a problem
except that submachine guns, like all auto and semiautomatic weapons, have the possibility of jamming
while in use. At short range, you may be putting yourself at unnecessary risk. This is the only reason to
discount a submachine gun as your primary weapon.
3. THE ASSAULT RIFLE
This weapon was invented originally to bridge the gap between the rifle and submachine gun, offering
both range and rapid fire. Wouldn’t these traits make it ideal against the undead? Not really. Although
range and accuracy are needed, rapid fire, as we’ve seen, is not. Even though an assault rifle can be set
for semiautomatic, just like a submachine gun, the temptation to go full auto still exists, as it does with a
submachine gun. When fighting for your life, it may simply be too easy to flip the switch to “rock ’n’ roll,”
no matter how wasteful and useless this might be. If you do choose an assault rifle as your primary
weapon, keep in mind the basic questions that apply to all firearms: What is its range? What is its
accuracy? Is the appropriate ammunition readily available? How easy is it to clean and maintain?
To answer some of these questions, it is best to examine two extreme examples. The U.S. Army M16A1
is considered by many to be the worst assault rifle ever invented. Its overcomplicated mechanism is both
difficult to clean and prone to jamming. Adjusting the sight, something that must be done every time a
target shifts its range, requires the use of a nail, ballpoint pen, or similar device. What if you didn’t have
one, or lost it as several dozen zombies shambled steadily toward you? The delicate plastic stock of the
M16A1 obviates bayonet use, and by attempting to use it as such you would risk shattering the hollow,
spring-loaded stock. This is a critical flaw. If you were confronted by multiple ghouls and your A1
jammed, you would be unable to use it as a last-ditch hand-to-hand weapon. In the 1960s, the M16
(originally the AR-15) was designed for Air Force base security. For political reasons typical of the
military-industrial complex (you buy my weapon, you get my vote and my campaign contribution), it was
adopted as the principal infantry weapon for the U.S. Army. So poor was its early battle record that
during the Vietnam War, communist guerrillas refused to take them from dead Americans. The newer
M16A2, although somewhat of an improvement, is still regarded as a second-class weapon. If given the
choice, emulate the Vietcong and ignore the M16 entirely.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, the Soviet AK-47 is considered the best assault rifle ever made.
Although heavier than the M16 (10.58 pounds versus 7 pounds) and possessing a considerably harder
kick, this weapon is famous for its rugged efficiency and sturdy construction. Its wide, spacious firing
mechanism prevents jamming from dirt or sand. In hand-to-hand combat, you could either stab a zombie
through the eye socket with the weapon’s bayonet or use the solid, steel-backed wooden stock to smash

through a zombie’s skull. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then several nations have chosen to
flatter the AK with either direct copies (Chinese Type 56) or modified designs (Israeli Galil). Again,
although the assault rifle is not ideal for defense against the living dead, a member of the AK-47 family
will be your best bet.
4. THE BOLT-/LEVER-ACTION RIFLE
A product of the mid-nineteenth century, these weapons are often regarded as obsolete. Why use a
hunting rifle when you can own a submachine gun? Such arrogance is simply unfounded, its roots based
in techno-chauvinism and the absence of practical experience. A well-made, expertly used bolt- or
lever-action rifle offers a defense against the living dead that is as good if not better than the latest military
hardware. A rifle’s single-shot capability forces the user to make each round count, increasing the chance
of a hit. This feature also eliminates even the possibility of “rock ’n’ rolling,” and therefore preserving
ammunition whether the user intends to or not. A third reason is the relative easiness to clean and operate
a rifle, something that must not be overlooked. Hunting rifles are designed for a civilian market.
Manufacturers know that if they are too complex, sales will plummet. A fourth and final reason is ready
availability of ammunition. As there are more civilian gun shops than military armories in the United States
(a pattern not shared by the rest of the world), you will find it easier to obtain ammunition for a hunting
rifle than an assault weapon or submachine gun. This will prove critical in any of the scenarios covered in
the latter part of this manual.
When choosing a bolt- or lever-action rifle, try to find an older, military version if possible. This does not
mean that civilian models are inferior weapons—quite the opposite—but almost all military bolt-action
rifles were designed for use in hand-to-hand combat. Make sure you take the time to study the use of a
rifle for this purpose. Simply swinging it like a club would destroy any weapon, military and civilian alike.
Manuals are available that explain how to use a rifle as a bludgeon. Even old war films can demonstrate
how deadly these weapons are without firing a shot. Examples of bolt-action military rifles are the U.S.
Springfield, the British Lee Enfield, and the German Mauser Kar 98k. Many of these still exist, some in
good working order. Before choosing, however, make sure the appropriate ammunition is in ready
supply. Having an impressive, bolt-action military rifle will do no good if the only rounds available fit
civilian models.
5. THE SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE
Since its debut, this weapon has shown itself to be a superior zombie killer. Given the possibility of
wasting ammunition (a round is expended every time the trigger is pulled), a fair amount of discipline is
required. However, this option can be a blessing when engaging multiple targets. In one recorded
instance, a trapped woman dispatched fifteen attacking zombies in twelve seconds! (See “1947 A.D.,
Jarvie, British Columbia.”) This story illustrates the potential of a semiautomatic rifle. For close combat or
for people on the run, the semiautomatic carbine serves the same function as the larger model. Although
possessing half the range, the carbine tends to be lighter and easier to carry, and uses smaller ammunition.
Either type will serve you well, depending on the situation. When choosing a semiautomatic weapon, the
World War II M1 Garand or M1 Carbine are, in many ways, superior to contemporary weapons. This
may be surprising, but these older military weapons were designed to survive the greatest conflict in
history. Not only did they meet this task admirably, but the Garand remained the U.S. Army’s main rifle
through the Korean conflict, while the Carbine saw action up until the first years of Vietnam. Another
advantage of the M1 Garand is its secondary role as a hand-to-hand weapon (in WWII, bayonet use
was still considered a vital part of combat). Although no longer in production, many Garands still remain
on the market with ammunition widely available. The M1 Carbine is, amazingly, still in production. Its
light weight and short muzzle perfectly suit this weapon to indoor combat or long journeys on foot. Other,
more modern choices include the Ruger Mini-30, Ruger Mini-14, and the Chinese Type 56 (a copy of

the Soviet SKS carbine, not to be confused with the assault rifle of the same name). If discipline can be
maintained, you will not find a better weapon than the semiautomatic rifle.
6. THE SHOTGUN
At close range against human attackers, this weapon reigns supreme. Against the living dead, this is not
entirely true. A good twelve-gauge shotgun can literally blow a zombie’s head off. However, the longer
the range, the greater the pellet dispersal pattern, and the lesser chance of skull penetration. A solid slug
would have the same effect as a rifle, even at greater range (provided the barrel is long enough), but in
that case, why not just use a rifle? What shotguns do possess is stopping power. The scattering shot acts
as a solid wall, whereas a rifle bullet might pass clean through or miss the target altogether. If you are
cornered, or on the run, and need time to escape, a good shotgun blast can send several zombies
sprawling. The downside of a shotgun is that the large, twelve-gauge shells are bulky and therefore
burdensome when traveling and leave less room for other equipment. This must be considered if a long
journey is required.
7. THE PISTOL
Americans have a special relationship with handguns. They seem to appear in every movie, every TV
show, every pop novel, every comic book. Our heroes have always carried them, from the Old West
lawman to the gritty urban cop. Gangsters rap about them; liberals and conservatives fight over them.
Parents shelter children from them and manufacturers make untold fortunes from them. Possibly more
than the automobile, the handgun is synonymous with America. But how useful is this cultural icon against
a swarm of newly risen flesh-eaters? In truth, not very. Unlike our fictional heroes, the average person
may have difficulty hitting anything, let alone something as small and mobile as a zombie’s head. Throw in
the obvious emotional strain of undead combat, and the possibility of a successful shot ranks one step
above negotiating with your attacker. Studies have shown that of all wasted ballistic wounds—e.g., those
that struck a zombie in a non-lethal way—73 percent came from some type of handgun. A laser sight
increases the odds of accurate aim but does nothing to steady a shaky wrist. Where handguns do come
in handy is in extreme circumstances. If you are grabbed by a zombie, a pistol can be a life-saver.
Pressing its muzzle against the undead temple and squeezing the trigger takes no skill and ensures a
positive kill. The fact that handguns are small, light, and easy to carry make them attractive as a
secondary weapon for any scenario. If your primary weapon is a carbine, this adds the possibility of
shared ammo and lighter load. For these reasons, a pistol should always be carried when confronting
ghouls, but as a backup only. Never forget that many dismembered, half-eaten corpses have been
discovered with these wonder weapons still clutched in their cold, dead hands.
8. .22-CALIBER RIM-FIRE WEAPONS
These weapons (rifle or pistol) fire a round no wider than a few millimeters and no longer than an inch. In
normal circumstances it is usually relegated to practice, competition, or the hunting of small game. In an
attack by the undead, however, the diminutive .22 rimfire stands proudly alongside its heavier cousins.
The small size of its rounds allows you to carry three times as much ammunition. This also makes the
weapon itself lighter, a godsend on long treks through ghoul-infested territory. The ammunition is also
easy to manufacture and plentiful throughout the country. No shop that sells any kind of ammunition
would fail to stock .22 rimfire. Two disadvantages present themselves, however, when the use of a .22 is
considered. The small round has zero stopping power. People (including former President Reagan) have
been shot with .22s and not even realized it until later. A ghoul taking a round to the chest would not even
be slowed, let alone stopped, by this puny projectile. Another problem is the lack of skull penetration at
longer ranges. With a .22, you might have to get a little too close for comfort, a fact that could increase

stress and degrade the odds of a kill. By the same token, the lack of power in a round fired by a .22 has
been called a blessing in disguise. Without the force to punch through the back of a zombie’s skull, .22
bullets have been known to ricochet inside the brain case, doing as much damage as any .45. So when it
comes time to arm yourself against a looming zombie menace, do not discount the small, almost toy-like
nature of this nimble, efficient firearm.
9. ACCESSORIES
Silencers, if attainable, can be a vital attachment to your firearm. Their ability to muffle noise obviates the
need for a bow, sling, or other non-ballistic weapon (essential if on the move).
A telescopic sight can increase aim immeasurably, especially for long-range sniper attacks. Laser sights,
on the surface, may be your best bet. After all, how hard is it to place a red dot on a ghoul’s forehead?
The disadvantage is limited battery life. The same goes for night-vision scopes. Although they allow for
accurate, long-range hits on zombies after dark, they become nothing more than useless black tubes
when the power runs out. Conventional glass and metal sights are the preferable accessory. They may
not be fancy, and they may lack the cachet of electronics, but these basic instruments will never let you
down.
RANGE versus ACCURACY
Studies have shown that, given the trauma of battle, the closer a human is to a zombie, the wilder his
shooting will be. When practicing with your firearm(s), establish a maximum range for repeated accuracy.
Practice against moving targets in ideal (stress-free) conditions. Once that range is fixed, divide it by half.
This will be your effective kill zone during an actual attack. Make sure the undead do not move closer
than this zone, as your accuracy will erode. If engaging a group, make sure to hit those that enter the
zone first before dispatching the others. Do not discount this advice no matter what your previous
experience has been. Street-hardened police officers, decorated combat veterans, even “cold-blooded”
murderers have ended up as well-chewed meat because they believed in their “nerves” and not their
training.
EXPLOSIVES
Question: What could be better than hurling a hand grenade at a mass of approaching zombies? Answer:
almost anything. Anti-personnel explosives kill mainly by shrapnel, metal shards tearing through vital
organs. As this will not affect zombies, and the chance of shrapnel penetrating the skull is slim, grenades,
bombs, and other explosive tools are inefficient weapons.
These devices should not be completely discounted, though. For blasting through doors, creating instant
barricades, or even scattering zombie mobs, nothing works better than a jar of gunpowder.
FIRE
The living dead have no fear of fire. Waving an open flame in a ghoul’s face will do nothing to slow or
impede its advance. Zombies who have caught fire will neither notice nor react to the engulfing flames in
any way. Too many humans have met with tragedy for failing to understand that fire is no
deterrent to zombies!
As a weapon, however, fire is still humanity’s greatest ally. Complete incineration is the best way to
destroy a zombie once and for all. Burning eliminates not only the body but all traces of Solanum.

However, don’t think a flamethrower and several Molotov cocktails are the solution to all your problems.
In actual combat, fire can be as deadly a threat as it is a protector.
Flesh—human, undead, or otherwise—takes a long time to burn. In the minutes or hours before a blazing
zombie succumbs, it will become a walking—or to be perfectly accurate, a shambling— torch. Several
cases have been recorded in which burning ghouls have done more damage, even caused more deaths,
than they would have with only their fingernails and teeth.
Fire itself has no loyalty. Consider the flammable nature of your surroundings, the chance of smoke
inhalation, the possibility that a blaze will act as a beacon for other zombies. All these factors must be
considered before such a powerful and unpredictable weapon is unleashed.
For this reason, fire is mainly considered an attack or flight weapon, and rarely used for static defense.
1. MOLOTOV COCKTAILS
This term applies to any jar of flammable liquid with a primitive fuse. It is a cheap, effective way to kill
multiple zombies at once. If the situation permits—e.g., fleeing an advancing horde, clearing a fireproof
structure, or destroying a flammable structure with multiple zombies trapped in it—by all means,
bombard the ghouls in question until nothing is left but ash.
2. DOUSING
The act of dousing consists of simply filling a bucket with flammable liquid (gasoline, kerosene, etc.),
throwing it at a zombie or zombies, lighting a match, and running. If there is room for escape and no
danger of residual fire damage, the only drawback to this method is the close proximity required to fully
drench the enemy.
3. THE BLOWTORCH
The common torch, which consists of a propane tank attached to a nozzle, has neither the heating power
nor the fuel supply to burn through a zombie skull. But it can be a convenient firestarter if the undead in
question have already been soaked in a flammable liquid.
4. THE FLAME THROWER
This device, perhaps more than any other, strikes people as the ultimate zombie eliminator. A jet of
flame, two hundred feet long, composed of jellied gasoline, can turn an undead crowd into a wailing
funeral pyre. So why not acquire one? Why not forsake all other weapons for this man-made
fire-breathing dragon? The answers are as realistic as they are numerous. The flamethrower was
developed purely as a military weapon and is no longer in service with the U.S. Army and Marine Corps.
It would be difficult to find any model, let alone one that works properly. Acquiring the fuel is even more
difficult than the thrower. But assuming you can find both, you must consider its practical use. Why carry 
seventy pounds of equipment on your back when only a handful of ghouls are loose? A flamethrower’s
weight makes it a liability if you are on the move. Unless you are in a fixed position or have access to
motorized transport, sheer exhaustion will become as dangerous a threat as the walking dead. Common
sense would suggest that a flamethrower’s place on the battlefield is against overwhelming numbers,
swarms of undead numbering in the hundreds if not thousands. If such a horde were, heaven forbid, to
exist, chances are they would be facing a much larger, well-equipped government force rather than one

private citizen and his trusty (and let’s not forget illegal) flamethrower.
OTHER WEAPONS
Imagination and improvisation are two invaluable assets during clashes with the living dead. By all means,
feel free to regard all the materials around you as a cache of potential weapons. But always keep in mind
a zombie’s physiology, and what your homemade device is likely to accomplish.
1. ACID
Apart from fire, sulfuric acid is the best way to completely destroy a zombie. Implementing it is another
matter. If somehow you have the means to acquire or produce large amounts of sulfuric acid, treat it with
the same respect you would an incendiary weapon. Not only is this substance as much a danger to
yourself as it is to the undead, the time it takes to dissolve zombie flesh and bone is considerable. Acid
should be used as a post-encounter disposal tool rather than a combat weapon.
2. POISON
As there are hundreds of thousands of lethal compounds in this world, it is impossible to discuss them all.
Instead, we will review some basic rules that govern the physical and physiological makeup of the
undead. Zombies are immune to all types of tranquilizers and irritants such as Mace and tear gas. Any
compound designed to halt bodily functions would be equally impotent, as the undead no longer require
these functions. Zombies do not suffer from heart attacks, nerve paralysis, suffocation, or any other fatal
effects caused by poison.
3. BIOLOGICALWARFARE
Wouldn’t it be poetic to destroy beings infected by a virus with another virus? Unfortunately, this is not
an option. Viruses attack only living cells. They have no effect on the dead. The same is true for all types
of bacteria. Several laboratory attempts have been made to culture and spread necrotizing fasciitis (a
flesh-eating bacterial disease) among captured zombies. None have proved successful. Experiments are
now under way to grow a new strand of bacterium that feeds only on dead flesh. Most experts are
skeptical of its success. Tests are ongoing to determine which of the many microorganisms normally
involved in decomposition continue to consume flesh in spite of its infected nature. If these microbes can
be isolated, reproduced, and delivered in a manner not harmful to its user, they could be humanity’s first
weapon of mass destruction in the battle against the living dead.
4. ZOOLOGICAL WARFARE
Hundreds of creatures, great and small, feed on carrion. Employing some of these animals to devour the
dead before they devour the living might seem the ideal solution. Unfortunately, all species, from hyenas
to fire ants, instinctively avoid zombies. The highly toxic nature of Solanum appears to be encoded in the
survival patterns of the animal kingdom. This mysterious warning signal that Solanum emits, be it an odor
or some kind of “vibe” long forgotten by humans, is impossible to mask by any known substance. (See
“1911 A.D., Vitre, Louisiana.”)
5. ELECTROCUTION
As the zombie’s muscular system is basically that of a human, electricity does have the ability to
temporarily stun or paralyze its body. Lethal results have been seen only in extreme cases such as power

lines used to completely char a zombie’s brain. This is not a “wonder weapon”—the current that runs
through power lines is enough to burn almost any organic matter, living or undead, to a crisp. It requires
twice the voltage to stun a zombie that it does to stun a human, so common taser guns are ineffective.
Electricity has been used to create a temporary barrier with water-filled, electrified ditches to keep ghouls
paralyzed long enough for a secondary fatal method to be employed. Several such incidents have been
recorded over the years.
6. RADIATION
Experiments are now being conducted to test the effects of microwaves and other electromagnetic signals
on the brains of the undead, on the theory that such a device could generate massive, instant, lethal
tumors in a zombie’s gray matter. Research is still in its early stages, and results have so far been
inconclusive. The only known instance when zombies came into contact with gamma radiation occurred
during the notorious Khotan Incident. (See “1987 A.D., Khotan, China.”) In this event, the ghouls were
not only unaffected by rads that would have killed humans, but they threatened to spread their
contamination throughout the province. For the first time, the world glimpsed a new and even deadlier
threat: the radioactive zombie. As much as this sounds like the product of bad 1950s science fiction, it is,
or was, a very real and historically significant fact. According to records, the radioactive ghouls
possessed no enhanced abilities or magical powers. The threat they posed lay in their ability to spread
deadly radiation to everything and everyone they touched. Even people who drank from a water supply
the ghouls had touched died soon afterward from radiation sickness. Fortunately, the outbreak was
crushed by the overwhelming power of the Chinese army. Not only did this solution put an end to this
new danger—it prevented the disaster of the Khotan reactor going critical.
7. GENETIC WARFARE
Some recent proposals recommend a variety of genetic weapons in the war against the undead. The first
step would be to map the genetic sequence of Solanum. Next, an agent would be developed to rewrite
that sequence, ordering the virus to suspend its attack on human tissue, turn on itself, or simply
self-destruct. Instead of retraining the zombie, we would retrain the virus that controls the zombie. If
successful, any of these agents would be a revolutionary breakthrough in combating the undead. Through
genetic engineering we could find an actual cure. Celebration of this breakthrough, however, will have to
wait. The science of genetic therapy is still in its infancy. Even with media attention and massive financial
resources, both of which are nonexistent, an agent to combat the virus will have to remain a theory.
8. NANOTHERAPY
Nanotechnology, the study of microscopic machinery, is only in its adolescence. At present, experimental
computer chips are being made that are no bigger than a molecule! One day robots that small will be able
to perform tasks within the human body. These nanobots, or whatever the accepted term will be, will one
day destroy cancer cells, repair damaged tissue, even attack and destroy hostile viruses. Theoretically,
there is no reason why they could not be injected by the billions into a recently infected human to identify
the Solanum virus and eradicate it from the system. When will this technology be perfected? When will it
find its way into the medical profession? When will it be adapted for combating Solanum? Only time will
tell.
ARMOR
Speed and agility should be your first defense against the walking dead. Armor will not only decrease
both these advantages that you have over zombies, but it will also sap your energy during prolonged

conflict. Add the risk of dehydration, and the prospect seems even less attractive. One final, less obvious
disadvantage to armor is not physical but psychological: People wearing protective garb tend to feel more
confident and therefore take greater risks than those in simple clothing. This artificial bravery has resulted
in too many senseless deaths. Simply put, the best protection from a zombie bite is distance. If for some
reason you insist on some type of protective gear, the follow-ing summary will provide all the information
necessary for prudent decision-making.
1. PLATEMAIL
This could be defined as the classic “suit of armor.” The term itself conjures up images of seemingly
invincible knights dressed from head to toe in shining steel. With so much protection, wouldn’t one be
able to wander among the undead ranks, taunting them at will with no danger of repercussion? In truth,
standard medieval armor is far from invulnerable. The leather or metal joints that hold its many pieces
together can be torn apart by an individual’s persistent hands, to say nothing of a mob. Even intact, steel
suits are heavy, cumbersome, suffocating, dehydrating, and extremely noisy. If possible, study and wear a
real suit of armor and practice fighting in it against even one (mock) attacker. You will find the experience
uncomfortable at best, excruciating at worst. Now imagine five, ten, fifty attackers, all converging on your
position, grabbing at the plates, pulling them in all directions. Without the speed to outrun them or the
agility to avoid them, even the necessary vision to find and strike them, you will almost certainly end up as
little more than canned food.
2. CHAINMAIL
If worn from head to toe, this simpler form of armor actually does provide some protection from zombie
bites. Teeth will be unable to penetrate its links, thereby saving you from infection. Its flexibility allows for
greater movement and speed; its lack of a faceplate allows for greater visibility. Its very nature (unlike
solid plates) allows the skin to breathe and thereby cuts down on dehydration and overheating.
Drawbacks, however, are still plentiful. Unless you have been training with this armor for years, your
combat effectiveness is bound to be impaired. Its weight can still increase exhaustion. Its general
discomfort can lead to unwanted distraction, something that must be avoided in battle. Although chain
mail may keep you safe from infection, the pressure of a zombie bite may still be enough to crack bones,
tear muscles, or rip flesh within the armor. As with plate mail, the clanking of so many chain links will
signal to any nearby zombies that prey has arrived. Unless you want your presence announced, discount
this idea entirely. On a practical note, if you choose chain mail, make sure it is battle-quality! Much of the
medieval or ancient armor produced today is for decoration or stage performance. For this reason, less
expensive alloys are used in their production. When purchasing your chain mail, always ensure, through
inspection and careful testing, that it can withstand a zombie’s bite.
3. THE SHARKSUIT
Although designed for protection against shark bites, this mesh bodysuit can stand up to the toughest
undead jaws. Made of either high-tensile steel or titanium, it provides twice the protection of chain mail
with half the weight. Noise, however, is still a factor, as well as physical discomfort and decreased speed
and agility. Shark suits might come in handy if hunting the dead underwater. (See “Underwater Battles.”)
4. HELMETS
This type of armor would be invaluable to ghouls, if only they knew enough to wear them. To humans,
they serve no purpose other than obstructing vision. Unless your battle is taking place in a “hard hat

area,” avoid this cumbersome waste of space.
5. BULLETPROOF VESTS
Because almost all combat-related zombie bites occur on the limbs, this and other torso armor are a total
waste of time. One might consider a bulletproof vest only in a chaotic situation in which there is a chance
of being shot by your own people. Even in this situation, the misguided sniper would probably be going
for a head shot.
6. KEVLAR COVERS
In recent years, law enforcement have begun to equip officers with this light, ultra-strong material. While
thicker, harder plates are used in vests to stop bullets, a thinner, more flexible version is employed to stop
blades and the occasional guard dog. This new version, if covering the lower legs and forearms, can help
to reduce the risk of zombie bites in close-quarter situations. If you do acquire Kevlar covers, make sure
to wear them only during battle, and do not draw any false bravery from them! Many humans in the past
have believed that Kevlar or similar kinds of body armor gave them carte blanche to take unnecessary
risks. No armor in the world can protect a human from that kind of stupidity. As stated before, your goal
is to survive, only survive, and never be a hero. Bravado in combat is the surest way to endanger
yourself and those around you!
7. TIGHT CLOTHES AND SHORT HAIR
Cold, hard figures have shown that when battling the living dead, nothing has saved more victims than
basic, tight clothing and closely cropped hair. The simple fact is that ghouls attack by reaching out to grab
their victims, pulling them in, then biting. Logic dictates that the less material a person offers up for grabs,
the better his or her chances will be. Baggy clothing, complete with pockets, straps, or anything that
might hang freely, will be a convenient handle for grasping zombie claws. Anyone who has worked in
factories or with some kind of heavy machinery will tell you the importance of never letting anything hang
loose. Tight clothing, obviously within comfort limits, will help to eliminate this danger. Hair can be a
similar hazard. Many times, victims have been seized and even dragged by their hair to a gruesome end.
Tying one’s hair back before a conflict may work temporarily. However, a short haircut, one inch or
shorter, is ideal for hand-to-hand combat.
ON THE DEFENSE
The story of Yahya Bey, a Turkish immigrant to the United Kingdom, describes an attack on his home
village of Oltu. According to Bey, a swarm of zombies descended from the surrounding hills in the dead
of night. Those who were not devoured fled either to their homes, the town mosque, or the local police
station. Several were crushed in the panic to enter this last location while an accidental fire killed
everyone inside. Many people, lacking the time and materials to barricade all their doors and windows,
were overrun by the undead. Many, suffering from bites, sought shelter in the home of the town doctor.
As he attempted to treat his patients, they expired, then reanimated. Bey, a six-year-old boy, managed to
climb onto the roof of his house, remained there for most of the night, then took off at first light, jumping
from roof to roof until he reached open ground. Although no one in the nearby villages believed his story,
a search party was sent to look for human marauders. This group found Oltu in shambles, all buildings
burned, smashed, or otherwise destroyed. Half-eaten corpses littered the deserted streets. Dragging
footprints, enough to suggest a sizable group, followed a track of fewer, faster tracks into the mountains.

Neither group was ever discovered.
What is the perfect protection from the undead? Truthfully, there isn’t one. Defense isn’t as simple as
physical safety. Supposing you manage to find, build, or modify a structure to keep the external threats at
bay—then what? Zombies will not just go away, and there’s no telling how long it will take for rescue.
How will you survive? Hunger, thirst, disease, and many other factors have claimed as many lives as the
walking dead. Siege warfare, the type our ancestors faced when their castles or villages were surrounded
by enemies, is what you will be facing when the dead walk again. Physical safety is only one part of the
equation. To be fully prepared, you must have a working knowledge of stationary survival. In an
interdependent world, this art has long since been forgotten. Look around your home. How many items
have been manufactured within ten, fifty, even a hundred miles of it? Our way of life, particularly as
members of the richest industrialized nation on earth, requires a delicate network of transportation and
communication to exist. Remove that network, and we are reduced to a standard of living reminiscent of
medieval Europe. Those who comprehend this and plan for such an existence stand a much greater
chance of survival. This section shows both how to create a stronghold and how to live within its
boundaries.
THE PRIVATE RESIDENCE (DEFENDING YOUR HOME)
For Class 1 conflicts, most people’s homes will provide adequate shelter. There is no need to flee the
city or town as soon as you hear that the dead are walking. In fact, this is highly discouraged. In the first
hours of a zombie attack, most of the population will try desperately to escape. Roads will become a
mass of stationary vehicles and panicked people, a situation that is rife with the potential for violence.
Until the living destroy the dead, or the dead overrun the living, trying to flee would only add more bodies
to the anarchy. So load your weapons, prepare for a fight, but stay put, stay safe, stay alert. And what
better place to do so than in the comfort of your own home?
1. PREPARATION PART I:  THE HOME
Before the dead rise, before the chaos and carnage begin, certain homeowners will find that they are
safer than their neighbors. Although no house was ever constructed for the purpose of zombie defense,
several designs have proved remarkably secure. If your house itself is not structurally ready for a zombie
attack, various measures can be employed to fortify it.
A. Exceptions
Stilted homes, as seen on beaches and along rivers and other high watermark areas, were built mainly to
avoid being overrun by floods. Their height already makes conventional attacks impossible. Doors and
windows could even remain open and unboarded. The only entrance and one or two outside staircases
could either be barricaded or destroyed once the alarm is sounded. Secure on this raised platform,
survival time would be determined only by the amount of provisions a homeowner had stockpiled.
There is another highly protective dwelling that was built to combat a force just as prevalent, and just as
deadly, as an undead army: Tornado-proof “safe houses,” now being constructed in the American
heartland, are designed to resist mild to moderate twisters. Their layout consists of concrete walls,
steel-reinforced doors, and steel shutters neatly concealed behind everyday curtains. On their own, these
domiciles could withstand both a Class 1 and Class 2 outbreak.
B. Modifications to Houses
Securing a house against the undead is similar to securing it from the living. One difference is the common

burglar alarm. Many of us sleep securely at night only because our alarms are “armed” and working. But
what do these devices really do, other than send a signal to a private security or police force? What if
these forces don’t come? What if they are occupied with other battles? What if they are ordered to
protect areas deemed “more important”? What if they have ceased to exist, disappeared into the
stomachs of ghouls? In any of these cases, direct means of defense are called for.
Security bars on doors and windows will stop a group of zombies for a limited amount of time.
Experience has shown that as few as three walking dead can tear them down in less than twenty-four
hours.
Tempered safety glass prevents entry by smashing but can be forced right out of its pane. This can easily
be fixed by installing concrete or steel frames. However, the money it would take to replace each
window in an average house could and should be spent instead on purchasing or building one of the two
house types discussed above: stilted or tornado-proof domiciles.
A good ten-foot chain-link fence can hold dozens of zombies for weeks, even months, provided their
numbers remain at Class 1. A ten-foot cinder-block wall, reinforced with steel rods and filled with
concrete, is the safest barrier in both Class 1 and Class 2 outbreaks. Zoning laws may prohibit a wall this
high, but don’t dismiss it. (Check with your local zoning board.) Although zombies have been known (on
rare occasions) to hoist themselves over obstacles as high as six feet, this has never occurred en masse.
Several people, well-armed and with good communication, can maintain a six-foot wall, not easily but
safely, for as long as the stamina of this group holds out.
A gate should be steel or wrought-iron, solid if possible. It should slide to one side, not swing in or out.
Reinforcement is as simple as parking your car up against it. Electric motors make opening easier but will
leave you trapped in a power outage or breakdown.
As stated earlier, a ten-foot concrete wall will only provide adequate protection in a Class 1 or Class 2
outbreak. In a Class 3 outbreak, enough zombies can, and will, climb on top of each other until they form
an undead ramp right over your wall.
C. Apartments
Apartments and apartment buildings vary in size and layout and, therefore, in defensibility. However,
from the squat two-story buildings of Los Angeles to the concrete and glass towers of New York,
certain basic rules apply.
First-floor apartments present the highest risk simply because of their accessibility. Tenants living above
the ground floor are almost always safer than those in any type of house. Destroying the staircase
effectively isolates the rest of the building. With the elevator turned off and the fire escape too high for a
zombie to reach (strict limits are imposed by law), any apartment house can become an instant haven
from the walking dead.
Another advantage of the apartment complex is its large population. Whereas a private homeowner may
be forced to hold the residence by himself, an apartment building can be defended by all of its tenants.
This also increases the chances of having multiple skilled experts such as carpenters, electricians,
paramedics, and Army reservists (not always the case, but still a possibility). Of course, with additional
people comes the challenge of additional social conflicts. This potential problem, however, should never
be a deterrent when choosing between a house and an apartment. Given the choice, always pick the
latter.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  DISCOUNT HOME-DEFENSE MANUALS!
Although almost every other section in this book encourages the use of conventional texts (on weapons
use, military tactics, survival skills, and so on), those written to protect a domicile are not recommended.
Home-defense books are designed to counter a human adversary with human skills and human
intelligence. Many of the tactics and strategies featured in these books, such as employing elaborate
alarm systems, booby traps, and painful, but nonlethal devices such as Mace canisters or nail heads in the
carpet, would be useless against an undead intruder.
2. PREPARATION PART II: SUPPLIES
Once the private residence is secure, stockpiling for a siege must be undertaken. There is no telling how
long it will take for help to arrive. There is no telling if help ever will. Always be prepared for a long siege.
Never assume a quick rescue.
A. Weapons
Whereas in the field you must travel light to maintain mobility, in your home you have the luxury of storing
and maintaining a plethora of weapons. This does not mean filling your home with any capricious
instrument of destruction. Each home arsenal should include:

Now that all weapons have been chosen, consider what equipment is necessary for your maintenance
and perhaps even survival. In the short run, standard disaster-survival kits will suffice. Any longer, and
the material below will be necessary. Common household items such as clothing, toilet paper, etc., are
assumed to be kept on hand in reasonable quantities.

3. SURVIVING AN ATTACK
The siege has commenced. Zombies swarm around your home, incessantly attacking but unable to enter.
At this point, your worries are far from over. Waiting out a siege does not mean sitting idle. Many tasks

will have to be accomplished and repeated for survival in a confined space.

4. IMMEDIATE DEFENSE
The dead have risen. You smell the smoke, hear the sirens. Screams and shots fill the air. You have been
unable or unwilling to properly prepare your home—what now? Although the situation looks grim, it by
no means signals your demise. If you take the right actions at the right time, you can save yourself and
your family from joining the ranks of the undead.

B. Strategies for Single-Story Homes
If you do not live in a two-story house, the attic will be a less comfortable but equally secure substitute.
Most can be secured by simply raising the retractable staircase or removing the temporary ladder.
Zombies lack the cognitive ability to build a ladder of their own. If you stay quiet, they will not even know
that an attic exists.
Never use a basement as a shelter. Popular horror flicks have shown that, in a crunch, this subterranean
chamber can protect the living from the dead. This is a dangerous fallacy. Burning, suffocating, or simply
starving to death in basements have claimed hundreds of lives over the years.
If you find yourself in a one-story home with no attic, grab whatever supplies you can, take hold of a
weapon, and climb onto the roof. If the ladder is kicked away, and there is no direct access (a window
or trapdoor), the undead will not be able to reach you. Keep still and keep silent to avoid attracting the
undead. Zombies in the area will break into the house below you, search it for prey, then wander off.
Remain on the roof for as long as you can, until supplies are exhausted or a rescue patrol arrives. It may
not be comfortable, but it is your best chance for survival. Eventually, it will become inevitable to
abandon this refuge. (See “On the Run,” for details.)
PUBLIC SPACES
As with private homes, safety can be found in public or nonresidential buildings. In some cases, their size
and layout may afford more protection than the most secure domiciles. In other cases, the exact opposite
is true. Because arming and equipping these structures should be done in the same manner as in private
homes, albeit on a grander scale, this section focuses on the best and worst public sanctuaries.
1. OFFICE BUILDINGS
Many of the same rules regarding apartment houses can be applied to office buildings. Once the first floor
has been abandoned, the staircases destroyed, and the elevators shut down, an office building can be a
tower of safety.
2. SCHOOLS
As there is no generic layout, deciding whether a public school is a good place to hole up can be tricky.
Keep in mind the general rules of defense (see “General Rules”). Unfortunately for our society but
fortunately for a zombie siege, inner-city schools have taken on a fortress-like atmosphere. Not only are
the buildings themselves built to withstand a riot, but chain-link fences surrounding them make these halls
of education look more like military compounds. Food and medical supplies should be readily available
from the cafeteria, the nurse’s station, or the physical-education office. Often, a school is your best
bet—perhaps not for education but certainly for protection from an undead attack.
3. HOSPITALS
What would seem to be the safest, most logical place to flee to during an outbreak is actually one of the
worst. Yes, hospitals may be stocked with food, medical supplies, and an expert staff. Yes, the
structures themselves could be secured, as with any office or apartment building. Yes, they may have
security, even a regular police presence. In any other disaster, a hospital should be first on your list of
havens. Not so when the dead rise. Even with growing awareness about zombies, Solanum infections are
still misdiagnosed. Humans with bites or newly murdered corpses are always brought to hospitals. The
majority of first-wave zombies (in some cases 90 percent) consist of medical staff or those involved with

the treatment of cadavers. Chronological maps of zombie outbreaks show them literally radiating from
these buildings.
4. POLICE STATIONS
Unlike with hospitals, the reason for avoiding police stations has less to do with zombies than with
humans. In all probability, the people living in your city or town will flock to the local police station,
creating a nexus of chaos, bodies, and eventual blood. Imagine a packed, writhing crowd of frightened
people, too many to control, all trying to force their way into the building they think best represents
safety. One does not need to be bitten by zombies when beatings, stabbings, accidental shootings, and
even tramplings are just as likely. So when the dead rise, locate your local police station—and head the
other way.
5. RETAIL STORES
For Class 1 uprisings, many types of retail stores will provide adequate shelter. Those with roll-down
gates, solid or otherwise, can stop up to ten zombies for several days. If the siege lasts any longer or if
more zombies arrive, the situation may change dramatically. Enough rotting fists, enough heaving forms
smashing against the gate will eventually break it down. Always have an alternate escape route planned,
so that if the barricade is breached, you can quickly move on. If you can’t formulate a solid Plan B, do
not consider this place a refuge. Stores without gates should not be considered. Their display windows
will do nothing more than advertise you to the zombies.
6. SUPERMARKETS
Although they have enough food to sustain your group for years, supermarkets are also dangerous. Their
huge glass doors, even when locked and gated, provide little protection. Reinforcement of these
entrances would be difficult. Basically, the exterior of a supermarket is a giant display window, meant to
show the fresh, delicious food within. With humans on the inside and zombies on the outside, that is
exactly what it will do.
Not all food stores are deathtraps, however. The smaller, family-owned markets and bodegas of the
inner city can serve quite well as temporary havens. To protect against theft and, more recently, riot, all
have strong steel gates, some even solid roll-down shutters. As with stores, these small markets can
provide adequate protection for short-term, low-intensity attacks. If you find yourself in one, remember
to eat perishables first and be ready to dispose of the rest if (when) the electricity is cut.
7. SHOPPING MALLS
A practically indefensible structure. Large shopping centers are always targets for both humans and
zombies. It is always the case with social disturbance: At the first sign of trouble, these concentrations of
wealth swarm with private security, police, even overzealous shop owners. If the crisis occurs suddenly,
a large number of shoppers may become trapped within the mall, creating problems of overcrowding,
trampling, and suffocation, as well as attracting the dead. In an outbreak of any class, heading for a
shopping mall would mean heading for a center of chaos.
8. CHURCHES
Forgive the expression, but places of worship are a mixed blessing. The main advantage of most
churches, synagogues, mosques, and other houses of worship is that they are built to withstand forced
entry. Most have heavy wood or metal doors. Windows tend to be high off the ground. A majority
possess wrought-iron fences that, despite their aesthetic intent, can serve as added protection. When

compared to many secular structures of equal size, your typical place of worship is surprisingly secure.
However, the protection they offer during an outbreak will never be enough against the horde of zombies
that are sure to come. The inevitable onslaught has, of course, nothing to do with the supernatural.
Satan’s soldiers are not out to invade God’s house. Ultimate evil is not doing battle with ultimate good.
The walking dead attack churches for one good reason: It’s where the food is. Despite their education,
technical savvy, and professed disinterest in the spiritual world, urban Americans run, screaming to their
gods, at the first sight of zombies. These places of worship, crammed with people loudly praying for their
souls, have always served as beacons for the undead. Aerial photographs have shown zombies migrating,
slowly, steadily, and with increasing numbers, toward their future slaughterhouse: the nearest church.
9. WAREHOUSES
Given their lack of windows, easily secured entrances, and generally spacious layouts, warehouses can
be an ideal refuge for an extended period of time. Many warehouses have a security office, usually
equipped with bathroom facilities and therefore an immediate source of water. If the merchandise that is
stored there is both heavy and kept in large, durable crates, consider yourself lucky. These boxes can be
used to reinforce doorways, create private rooms, or even, as many of us did when we were children, be
used to build a secondary line of defense or “fort” within the main area. There is the possibility, however
unlikely, that whatever goods are stored could be helpful to your survival. For all these reasons, rank
warehouses among your most attractive hideouts. One caveat concerning location: 50 percent of the
time, these buildings are close to shipyards, factories, or other industrial sites. If this is the case, be
cautious, observant, and always ready to flee. Also, beware of refrigerated warehouses storing
perishable goods. Once electricity is lost, their quick decomposition can become a severe health hazard.
10. PIERS AND DOCKS
With some modifications, adequate supplies, and the right location, any dock or pier can be made
practically unreachable. Because zombies can neither swim nor climb, their only access would be from
land. Destroying that one access point would leave you on an artificial island.
11. SHIPYARDS
Despite the fact that they frequently are the storage site for industrial waste and hazardous materials,
shipyards do present undeniable possibilities for refuge. Like warehouses, their containers can be
transformed into barriers or, in some cases, even weapons. (See “Mar. 1994 A.D., San Pedro,
California.”) The ships themselves become ready havens once the gangway has been secured. But before
boarding, make sure you check these waterborne fortresses for infected crew, particularly in smaller,
recreational marinas. In the first stages of an outbreak, citizens will no doubt flock to the shoreline, hoping
to use (or steal) any available cabin cruiser. Because many marinas are built in relatively shallow water,
they are not deep enough to keep zombies completely submerged. More than once, an unwary, amateur
sailor has climbed aboard his boat to find several ravenous, waterlogged zombies waiting for him.
12. BANKS
What could be safer than a stronghold already built to house the most valuable commodity on Earth?
Wouldn’t a bank be a logical place to prepare a defense? Wouldn’t its security measures be more than
enough to repel a horde of walking dead? Not in the least. Even the most cursory examination of banks
reveals that a majority of their so-called “security” features require the deployment of police and/or
outside security. With the police and all other special forces otherwise engaged during an outbreak, silent

alarms, surveillance cameras, and waist-high locked gates will be useless when the dead smash through
the plate-glass windows, hungry for human flesh. Of course, there is safety in the vault. These titanic
constructions would stop even zombies armed with rocket launchers. (No, zombies do not know how to
operate rocket launchers.) However, once inside the vault, what next? Given that there is no food, no
water, and precious little oxygen, seeking refuge in a vault does little more than give you enough time to
place a gun to your head, make peace with your god, and pull the trigger.
13. CEMETERIES
Ironically, and despite many popular myths, cemeteries are not the most dangerous place to be when the
dead rise. In fact, they can be a place of temporary rest. As previously stated, infected bodies are more
likely to end up in hospitals or morgues, reanimating long before they can be taken to cemeteries for
conventional burials. And if by some miracle, a corpse did come to life inside its coffin, would it really
“rise from the grave”? To answer this question, one must ask another: how? How would a body with
normal human strength claw its way out of a coffin, possibly made of steel, possibly encased in a
hermetically sealed box, six feet underground? If one looks at the preservation methods involved in
standard American burials, the fact is obvious that any person, undead or otherwise, could not possibly
scrape, scratch, and crawl his or her way to the surface. But what if the casket is not made of steel? Even
a plain pine box would be prison enough to entomb the most tenacious zombie. What if the wooden
casket has rotted? In that case, the body has been lying buried so long that its brain has rotted away as
well. Remember: Bodies that reanimate have to be fresh, reasonably intact, and infected with the virus.
Does this describe a long-dead corpse? Although it’s seen as an iconic vision of the living dead, like
vampires drinking blood or werewolves howling at the full moon, the fact remains that zombies have not
and never will rise from the grave.
14. CAPITOLS AND CITY HALLS
Apply the same principles regarding police stations, hospitals, and houses of worship to state, municipal,
and federal government buildings. Most will be the focus of concentrated human activity, making them
centers of chaos and zombie congregation. Avoid all government buildings if possible.
GENERAL RULES:
Buildings in poorer, inner-city neighborhoods tend to be more secure than others. Their reliance on high
fences, razor wire, barred windows, and other anti-crime features make them readily defensible.
Buildings in middle- or high-income areas tend to emphasize aesthetics. What rich city council wants an
eyesore in its neighborhood? Instead of ugly, even tacky, safety features, these affluent people rely more
heavily on law enforcement and private security (forces of proven unreliability). For these reasons, and if
the situation permits, head away from the suburbs and toward the inner city.
Avoid “accidents waiting to happen.” Many industrial structures of the sort commonly found in inner-city
or “downtown” areas house explosive or flammable materials. They also may contain complicated
machinery such as power generators and environmental regulators, mechanisms that require constant
supervision. Put those two together, and disaster is guaranteed. The Khotan nuclear power plant is only
one extreme example. More numerous if less dramatic incidents usually occur with all Class 2 and 3
outbreaks. Do not seek refuge in or near industrial sites, fuel-storage facilities, airports, or any other
place identified as high-risk.

Make sure to consider all these questions when choosing where to make your stand. Resist the urge to
dash into the nearest building. Remember, no matter how desperate the situation seems, time spent
thinking clearly is never time wasted.
THE FORTRESS
In Class 3 outbreaks, private homes and even public structures prove insufficient to support human life.
Eventually, the people inside will have either suffered the eventual degradation of their defenses, or simply
run out of supplies. What is needed in a severe outbreak is a nearly impregnable structure with all the
facilities of a self-sustaining biosphere. What is needed is a fortress. This does not mean you must search
one out immediately. The first days, even weeks, of a Class 3 infestation will be marked by utter bedlam,
an orgy of panicked violence that will make travel risky. When things have “quieted down,” humans in the
area will have been organized, evacuated, or completely devoured. Only then should you begin your
search for a fortress.
1. MILITARY COMPLEXES
Army, Marine, or even Air Force bases should be your top priority when searching for a fortress. Many
are located in sparsely populated and therefore less infested areas. Almost all have elaborate security
fences around their perimeters. Some have secondary, even tertiary defensive positions. Most are
equipped with fully stocked, fully functional fallout shelters, some with the capabilities of a small city.
Because they have multiple means of communication, they will undoubtedly be the last of all global
facilities to lose contact with one another. What is most important, however, is not the physical
fortifications but the men and women within them. As has been noted, well-trained, well-armed,
well-disciplined people are always the best defense. Even with some desertions, a small cadre of soldiers
would be enough to hold the perimeter indefinitely. To enter a military base in times of crisis, you would
find a self-contained world of trained specialists, most probably with their dependents (families) on base,
all ready to defend their new home. The best example of this was Fort Louis Philippe in French North
Africa, where in 1893 a unit of French Foreign Legionnaires successfully survived a zombie siege for an
amazing three years! One expected problem of military bases is that their obvious advantages make them
prone to overcrowding during an outbreak, which creates the additional dangers of acute supply
consumption and security degradation.
2. PRISONS
Although designed from the ground up to keep the living in, correctional institutions can also be more than
efficient in keeping the dead out. Behind their formidable walls, each cell block, corridor, and room is a
fortress unto itself.
Problems, of course, do arise when considering prisons as a refuge. Ironically modern penitentiaries are
less defensible than older models because of the way they were designed. High concrete walls are a
classic trademark of the pre-1965 prison. Their design is a product of the industrial age, when sheer size
was valued as a means of intimidation and respect. Although this psychological aspect may be lost on the
dead, anyone seeking refuge could not ask for a better, time-honored barrier than the ones that kept our
ancestors safe from society’s criminal element. In an age of bottom lines and frugal budgeting, available
technology has replaced heavy and expensive construction. Surveillance cameras and motion sensors
leave only a double fence of razor wire as the physical deterrents to escape. A dozen zombies would be
stopped in their tracks. Hundreds could maybe cause some damage. Several thousand, however,
crawling over each other in a writhing, growing mound, would eventually rise high enough to topple the

first fence, then the second, then come swarming into the compound. Against this onslaught, who
wouldn’t trade all the high-tech machinery in the world for twenty feet of old-fashioned concrete?
And what about the inmates? Considering that within a prison’s walls are the most dangerous members
of our society, wouldn’t it be wiser to confront the undead? Most of the time, the answer is yes. Anyone
with common sense knows it’s safer to take on ten zombies than one hardened criminal. However, in the
event of a large-scale, long-term infestation, prisoners will no doubt be released. Some may decide to
stay and fight for their safety (see “1960 A.D., Byelgoransk, Soviet Union”), or risk the dangers of the
outside for freedom, even a chance to raid the surrounding countryside. Be careful when approaching a
prison. Make sure the inmates have not taken over. Use caution if internal leadership consists of a
prisoner-guard coalition. In other words, unless the penitentiary is abandoned or populated by civilians
and guards, always be on your toes.
Once inside the gates, several major steps must be taken to transform this correctional facility into a
self-contained village. The following is a Checklist for Survival should you find the penitentiary
abandoned.

3. OFFSHORE OIL RIGS
When choosing a fortress purely for its safety, nothing on earth holds a candle to these artificial islands.
Completely isolated from shore, with living and work spaces towering far above the waterline, even a
bloated, floating zombie could never climb aboard. This makes security almost a non-issue, allowing you
and your group to concentrate fully on the task of survival.
Offshore platforms also excel in self-containment, especially in the short term. As with ships, they carry
their own living and medical facilities. Many are equipped to supply all their crew’s needs for up to six
months. All have their own distilleries, so fresh water will never be a problem. Since all are equipped to
mine either oil or natural gas, power will be unlimited.
Food is also plentiful, as the ocean provides a nutritious (and, some would argue, superior) diet of fish,
kelp, and if possible, seaborne mammals. Unless the rig is extremely close to land, there is no danger of
industrial pollution. People can, and do, live entirely, indefinitely from the riches of the sea.
This complete isolation, as attractive as it sounds, also presents its own brand of difficulties.
Anyone living near the beach will tell you what a killer salt air can be. Corrosion will be your number one
enemy, eventually winning out against all preventative measures. Essential machines can be repaired.
Cruder distilleries of steel pots and copper tubing work just as well as high-tech desalinizers. Wind- or
tidal-powered dynamos could provide more than half the power of the fossil-fuel generators. Sensitive
electronic gear, however, such as computers, radios, and medical machinery, will be the first to go and
the hardest to replace. Eventually, the entire complex will deteriorate, from a cutting-edge industrial
wonder to a crude and rusty albeit still serviceable hulk.
Unlike prisons and military bases, offshore oil rigs will be the first places abandoned. Within the first few
days of an outbreak, workers will no doubt demand to get to their families, leaving the rig without a
trained staff. If none of your group knows how to operate the machinery, learning might be difficult.
Unlike prisons, there may not be a library with how-to books on every shelf. This may require a little
creative improvisation, making do with what you can operate instead of, or until you can master, all the
technology that can be found on most sophisticated rigs.
Industrial accidents—explosions of stored oil and gas—are bad enough on land. In the middle of the
ocean, they have materialized into some of the worst disasters in history. Even with all the firefighting and
rescue facilities of a living, functional world, entire crews have been killed when their rigs went up in
flames. What would happen if a fire occurred and there was no one to cry to for help? This does not
mean that oil rigs are sea-based bombs waiting to go off; it does not mean they should be avoided by all
but the most foolhardy. What is recommended, however, is to shut down the drill. This may rob you of
new petroleum but will work wonders for your life expectancy. Use already-stored fuel for the generator.
As stated above, it will not give you the same amperage as the primary generator, but with the drill off
and all industrial facilities closed, what will you need it for?
The ocean can be a source of life, but also a merciless killer. Storms, striking with a ferocity rarely seen
on land, can smash even the sturdiest platforms. News tapes of North Sea rigs literally turning over,
disintegrating to rubble, then sinking beneath the waves are enough to make anyone think twice about
leaving shore. This is, unfortunately, a problem that cannot be remedied by humanity. Nothing in this or
any other book can save you from nature when she decides to remove this hunk of steel from her ocean.

ON THE RUN
The 1965 “Lawson Film,” as it is now commonly called, is an 8mm home movie of five people attempting
to escape the infestation of Lawson, Montana. Its shaky, soundless footage shows the group racing to a
school bus, starting the engine, and attempting to drive out of town. After only two blocks, they
accidentally rammed several wrecked cars, backed up into a building, and cracked the rear axle. Two
members of the group smashed the windshield and tried to make it out on foot. The camera operator
filmed one of them being grabbed and mauled by six zombies. The other ran for her life, disappearing
around a corner. Moments later, seven zombies surrounded the bus. Fortunately, they were unable to
turn the vehicle over or smash the glass of the side door. As the film ran out after only a few minutes, little
is known of what happened to the survivors. The bus was eventually found with its door caved in. Dried
blood covered the inside.
During the course of an outbreak, you may find it necessary to flee the area. Your fortress may be
overrun. You may run out of supplies. You may become critically injured or ill, in need of professional
medical attention. Fire, chemicals, or even radiation may be rapidly approaching. Crossing an infested
area is generally the most dangerous thing you can do. You will never be safe, never be secure. Always
exposed, in hostile territory, you will know what it means to be prey.

EQUIPMENT
Traveling light is essential to your journey. Before packing anything, ask yourself, “Do I really need this?”
Once you’ve compiled your gear, go down the list and ask that question again. Once you’ve done that,
do it again. Of course, traveling light does not mean just holstering a .45, grabbing some beef jerky and a
water bottle, and heading down the road. Equipment will be vital, more so than in any other scenario
where you are holed up in a place—a prison, a school, your own home—where supplies are in
abundance. The equipment you take with you may be all you have. You will carry your hospital,
storeroom, and armory on your back. The following is a list of standard equipment you will need for a
successful journey. Specific gear such as alpine skis, sunblock, or mosquito netting should be added
according to your environment.

Once you have chosen your gear, make sure everything works. Try it all, over and over again. Wear
your backpack for an entire day. If the weight is too much in the comfort of your fortress, imagine how it
will feel after a daylong hike. Some of these problems can be solved by choosing objects that combine
various tools (some portable radios come equipped with flashlights, survival knives carry compasses,
etc.). Apply this space-saving philosophy when choosing weapons as well. A silencer for an existing
weapon requires less space than a whole new weapon, such as a crossbow and extra bolts. Wearing
your pack for a day will also give you an idea where the chafe points are, where the harness needs
adjusting, and how best to secure the gear.
VEHICLES
Why walk when you could ride? Americans have always been obsessed with the idea of labor-saving
machinery. In all walks of life, industry struggles in an endless race to invent and perfect machines that
make the chores of everyday life faster, easier, and more efficient. And what could be a greater deity of
American techno-religion than the automobile? No matter what our age, gender, race, economic status,
or geographic location, we are taught that this omnipotent machine, in all of its wondrous forms, is the
answer to our prayers. Why wouldn’t this be true during a zombie outbreak? Wouldn’t it make sense to
just race across hostile ground? Travel time would be reduced from days to mere hours. Equipment
storage would no longer be a problem. And what danger would zombies present when you could simply
run them over? These are powerful advantages, to be sure, but with them come a host of equally
powerful problems.
Consider fuel consumption. Gas stations may be few and far between. Chances are those you do find will
have been drained long ago. Determining the exact mileage of your vehicle, packing it with extra fuel,
even planning the exact route may get you only so far.
How will you know which path will lead to safety? Post-infestation studies, particularly in North America,
have shown that most roads quickly become blocked by abandoned vehicles. Additional obstacles may
include destroyed bridges, piles of debris, and barricades abandoned by last-ditch defenders.
Off-roading presents an equal if not greater challenge. (See “Terrain Types”) Driving through the
countryside, searching for an open path to freedom, is the best way to run out of gas. More than one
vehicle has been found alone in the wilderness, tank dry, blood-smeared cabin empty.
Imagine a breakdown. Most Westerners transporting their vehicles to Third World countries usually pack
a full set of replacement parts. The reasoning behind this is simple: The automobile is one of the most
complicated machines on earth. On bad roads, without the convenient auto garage, this machine can
quickly become a pile of useless junk.
And then there is noise. Roaring through an infestation may seem attractive when things are going well.
But any powered engine, no matter how good the muffler, generates more noise than the loudest human
footstep. If you find yourself in a vehicle that for whatever reason cannot go another foot, grab your gear
and run! Until this moment, you have been announcing your presence to every ghoul in the area. Now,
with your mechanized mobility gone, good luck in avoiding them.
Despite these warnings, the lure of motorized transport can seem irresistible. The following is a short list
of typical vehicles and their advantages and disadvantages.
1. THE SEDAN
What is otherwise known as your basic “car” has thousands of variations. This makes it difficult to

generalize about their advantages and disadvantages. When choosing, look for gas mileage, equipment
storage space, and durability. If sedans have one major drawback, it is their lack of all-terrain capability.
As stated before, most roads will be blocked, jammed, or destroyed. If you own a sedan, imagine how it
would perform crossing a field. Now add snow, mud, rocks, tree stumps, ditches, streambeds, and a
variety of rusting, forgotten junk. Chances are that your sedan would not get very far. Too often, the land
around an infested area has been littered with broken-down and/or stuck sedans.
2. THE SUV
With a booming economy coupled with an abundance of cheap gasoline, the 1990s saw an explosion of
these types of vehicles—road monsters harkening back to the automotive golden age of the 1950s, when
bigger was always better. At first glance, they appear to be the ideal means of escape. With the off-road
capability of a military vehicle and the comfort and reliability of a sedan, what could be better for fleeing
the undead? The answer is: a lot. Despite their appearance, not all SUVs are equipped for all-terrain
driving. Many were produced for a consumer who never even contemplated taking his SUV beyond his
own neighborhood. But what about safety? Shouldn’t the sheer mass of such large vehicles offer more
protection? The answer is, again, no. Repeated consumer studies have shown that many SUVs possess
safety standards well below that of many mid-sized sedans. That said, some of these vehicles are truly
what they appear to be: rugged, dependable workhorses that can handle unforgiving conditions.
Research your options carefully so you can tell these genuine models from the gas-guzzling, aesthetically
engineered, irresponsibly marketed vanity pieces.
3. THE TRUCK
This class refers to any mid-sized cargo vehicles, from vans to delivery trucks to recreational vehicles.
With poor gas mileage, limited off-road capability (depending on the model), and massive, ungainly bulk,
these vehicles could be considered the worst choice in transportation. In many cases, trucks have
become stuck in both urban and wilderness settings, transforming their occupants into canned food.
4. THE BUS
As with the previous class, these large road monsters can present as much a danger to their drivers as to
the living dead. Forget speed, forget maneuverability, forget fuel efficiency, off-road capability, stealth, or
any other feature you will need to escape an infested area. A bus has none of these. Ironically, if a bus
has any “advantage,” it is as a means not of escape but of defense. Twice, hunting groups have driven
police buses into infested areas and used their vehicles as mobile fortresses. Unless you plan to use a bus
in this way, steer clear of them.
5. THE ARMORED CAR
These civilian tanks are rare, to say the least. Unless you work for a private security company or have a
vast personal fortune, it is unlikely you will have access to one. Despite their poor mileage and lack of
all-terrain capability, armored cars present a number of advantages for people on the run. Their massive
armor gives the driver virtual invulnerability. Even in a breakdown, those inside could survive as long as
their provisions held out. A zombie horde of any size and strength would be incapable of penetrating the
reinforced steel.
6. THE MOTORCYCLE
Definitely the best choice for fleeing an infested area. The motorcycle—specifically the dirt bike—can

reach places inaccessible to four-wheeled vehicles. Their speed and maneuverability allows them to be
ridden right through a crowd of zombies. Their light weight allows them to be pushed for miles. Of
course, there are drawbacks. Motorcycles have small gas tanks, and offer no protection whatsoever.
The statistics show, however, that these are small disadvantages. When compared to other motorists
attempting to escape a zombie outbreak, dirt-bike riders have a 23-to-1 survival rate. Sadly, 31 percent
of motorcycle fatalities come from ordinary accidents. Reckless and/or arrogant riders could find
themselves killed just as easily by a crash as by the jaws of walking dead.

8. ALTERNATE ROAD TRANSPORTATION
A. The Horse
No one can dispute the obvious advantage of an escape on horseback. Fueling from a gas station
becomes irrelevant. Extra supplies are reduced to feed, blanket, and some additional medicine. Terrain
options increase, as four hooves don’t need a road. Before the luxury of automobiles, people traveled
quite efficiently on these fast, sturdy animals. Before saddling up and hitting the trail, however, keep in
mind these simple warnings. As anyone who’s even ridden a pony as a child will agree, horseback riding
requires skill. Forget how easy it looks in Westerns. The skills needed to ride and care for horses are
difficult to master. Unless you already know how, don’t think you can learn on the go. Another
drawback, specific to dealing with zombies, is that horses are notoriously spooked by the undead. Even
the scent of a zombie, carried by the wind and maybe miles from the source, will be enough to send most
horses into hysterics. This could be an advantageous early-warning system to an extremely experienced
rider, one who knows how to control his animal. For most, however, the end result could be a catapult

toss to the ground, injuries and all. The horse, at that moment, would not only leave its hapless rider
stranded, but its frantic neighing would also serve to alert nearby zombies.
B. The Bicycle
In a class by itself, this vehicle offers the best of both worlds. The common bicycle is fast, quiet,
muscle-powered, and easy to maintain. Add to this the additional advantage that it is the only vehicle you
can pick up and carry if the terrain gets too rough. People using bicycles to escape from infested areas
have almost always fared better than those on foot. For optimum performance, use a mountain bike, as
opposed to the racing or recreational model. Don’t let your speed and mobility go to your head,
however. Wear standard safety gear, and choose caution over speed. The last thing you want is to end
up in a ditch, legs broken, bike trashed, with the shuffling of undead feet growing louder with each step.
TERRAIN TYPES
Much of our species’ evolution has been a struggle to master our environment. Some would say we’ve
gone too far. This may or may not be true. What cannot be argued, especially in the case of
industrialized, First World countries, is that it is possible to assert complete control over the forces of
nature. In the comforts of your own home, you control the elements. You decide when it should be hot or
cold, wet or dry. You decide to erase the day by pulling the shades, or purge the night by simply turning
on a lamp. Even the smells and, in some cases, the sounds of the outside world can be expunged by the
walls and closed windows of the artificial bubble you call home. In that bubble, the environment takes
orders from you; out in the world, on the run from a mob of ferocious zombies, the exact opposite is true.
You will be at nature’s mercy, unable to change even the slightest aspect of the environment that you
previously took for granted. Here, adaptation will be the key to survival, and the first step to that
adaptation is to know your terrain. Every environment you encounter will have its own set of rules. These
rules must be studied and respected at all times. This respect will determine whether that terrain becomes
your ally or enemy.
1. FOREST (TEMPERATE/TROPICAL)
The density of many high trees enhances concealment. Animal noises, or lack thereof, can provide
warning of approaching danger. Soft earth will serve to muffle your footsteps. Occasional sources of
natural food (nuts, berries, fish, game, etc.) will supplement and extend your packed rations. Sleeping in
the branches of a large tree may permit you a safe night’s rest. One irritating disadvantage comes from
the canopy above. If you hear a helicopter overhead, you will not be able to signal it quickly. Even if the
crew does spot you, they’d need a large clearing to land. This may be frustrating as you hear but are
unable to see possible salvation flying right above your head.
2. PLAINS
Wide open spaces allow zombies to spot you at great distances. If possible, avoid them. If not, keep a
sharp lookout for the undead. Make sure you see them before they see you. Drop to the ground
immediately. Wait for them to pass. If motion is necessary, crawl. Stay down until you’ve cleared the
danger zone.
3. FIELDS
For concealment, nothing works better than tall crops. The question is: Will this work to your advantage
or to a lurking ghoul’s? Noise will be a critical factor. Traipsing through dry crops will create enough din

to attract zombies from far and wide. Even at their wettest, travel through fields slowly, listen carefully,
and be ready for close combat at any time.
4. HILLS
Traveling through rolling terrain will limit your visibility. If possible, avoid high ground. Stick to valleys.
Keep an eye on the surrounding hilltops in case the unexpected zombie should spot you. High ground can
be useful for getting your bearings, confirming your route, and confirming zombie locations within the
area. Approach high ground with extreme caution. Travel low, on your stomach, with eyes primed for a
slouching figure and ears alert for that distinctive moan.
5. SWAMP
If possible, avoid wetlands altogether. The noise of splashing through water prevents any chance of
stealth. Poisonous and predatory wildlife are as much a threat as the undead. Soft mud will impede your
advance, especially with a heavy pack. Always stick to firm, dry ground. If necessary, wade through only
the shallowest water. Watch for ripples or any subsurface motion. A zombie might have sunk through the
soft mud and be trapped just below the waterline. Look for tracks and animal carcasses. As in forests,
listen to the wildlife. Their physical presence will also act as an early-warning mechanism. Hundreds of
different animal and bird species live in this ecosystem. Only the threat of large predators would be
enough to silence them. If you find yourself in the middle of a swamp and suddenly hear absolutely
nothing, you will know the undead are close.
6. TUNDRA
This sub-arctic environment is the most human-friendly on earth. Long winter nights are safe for travel, as
the extremely low temperatures freeze zombies in their tracks. The long summer days put
sight-dependent humans on equal parity with their omnisensed, undead pursuers. This allows for more
time spent on the go. Ironically, this sub-arctic twilight has also proven to aid in deeper, more relaxed
sleep. Escapees bedding down for the “night” have consistently reported the ability to truly rest without
the fear of a putrid mob rushing at them from out of the darkness.
7. DESERT
Apart from urban areas, hot, arid zones can be the most dangerous environments on earth. Even without
the threat of zombies, dehydration and/or heatstroke can kill a healthy human in several hours. The best
way to avoid these lethal conditions is, obviously, to travel by night. Unfortunately, this will be impossible,
as night movement is highly discouraged during an outbreak. Traveling should take place for three hours
after dawn and three hours before dusk. The brightest, hottest part of the day should be spent immobile
and shaded. Use hours of total darkness for rest. This will slow your journey but greatly reduce the risks
of attack. More than in any other terrain, make sure you either have enough water for the trek or know
exactly where to obtain it. If possible, avoid deserts altogether. Never forget that this environment can kill
you just as easily as any walking dead.
8. URBAN
As stated before, areas of high population density should be avoided at all costs when on the run. Within
their boundaries will be a maelstrom of unspeakable chaos. Imagine a large number of people—say, half
a million—left to their own devices in a city without running water, electricity, phones, food delivery,
medical attention, garbage collection, fire control, or law enforcement? Now add thousands of

carnivorous humanoid creatures prowling the bloodstained streets. Imagine half a million human
beings—frightened, frantic, frustrated, fighting for their lives. No conventional battlefield, no riot, no
“normal” breakdown in social order can possibly prepare you for the nightmare that is a city besieged by
the living dead. If you must ignore all common sense and travel through an urban area, the following rules
will improve (if by no means guarantee) your chances of survival:
A. Know the Area!
This rule begs repeating, because nowhere is it more vital than in urban areas. How large is the city you
are entering? How wide are its roads? Where are the choke points, such as bridges or tunnels? Where
are the blind alleys or dead-end streets? Are there factories, chemical plants, or other places that store
hazardous materials? Where are the construction sites that might present obstacles? Are there flat, open
areas such as playing fields and parks that would cut your travel time? Where are the hospitals, police
stations, churches, and any other buildings where zombies might be attracted to hiding humans? One city
map would be essential, an additional guidebook even better, but firsthand knowledge is the best.
B. Never Use Four-Wheeled Vehicles
The chances of finding a continuously open street from one end of a city to the other are practically nil.
Unless you have a constant stream of up-to-the-second information about such a route, don’t even think
of attempting to find one with your car, truck, or SUV. A motorbike will allow you to skirt blocked
roads. Its noise, however, cancels this advantage. By traveling on foot or bicycle, you have the advantage
of speed, stealth, and versatility in this concrete maze.
C. Use Freeways
If the outbreak has moved from active battle to full infestation, the safest route will be by freeway. Since
the 1950s, freeways have been built through every large and medium-sized city in the United States.
Their layouts are generally straight, decreasing travel time. Long sections are lined with tall fences or are
suspended above ground, which makes it almost impossible for ghouls to reach you. If they do find an
on-ramp or breach the fences, you will still have the speed to either ride away (on your bike or
motorcycle) or simply run. Four-wheeled vehicles are, again, not an option, as every freeway will
undoubtedly be jammed by static vehicles. Many will contain zombies—bitten humans who attempted to
flee the city, succumbed to their wounds, and reanimated while still belted into their seats. Examine each
vehicle before approaching, and watch for those with open or broken windows. Keep your machete
handy for the sudden grasping hand. Be extremely cautious when using firearms, silenced or otherwise.
Remember you are walking among a minefield of full or partially filled fuel tanks. One stray bullet or a
single spark, and the living dead will be the least of your problems.
D. Remain Above Ground
Storm drains, subways, sewers, and other types of underground structures can shield you from the
hordes above. However, as on freeways, you run the risk of being cornered by zombies already lurking
in the area. Unlike freeways, you do not have the luxury of hopping over a wall or jumping from an
overpass. If confronted, there may be no place to run. Traveling below ground also ensures permanent
darkness, already one strike against you. The acoustics of most tunnels are far better than what you find
above ground. While this may not allow zombies to get a fix on your position, it will set off a chain
reaction throughout your subterranean passage. Unless you have expert knowledge of the
system—unless you helped design, build, or maintain it—don’t go anywhere near it.
E. Watch for Friendly Fire

Even if a city or section of it has been declared “overrun” (completely taken by zombies), there may still
be pockets of humanity. These survivors will undoubtedly shoot first and identify their attackers later. To
avoid friendly fire, be on the lookout for gatherings of zombies. This could indicate a still-raging battle.
Also, look for piles of dead bodies. They could mark the kill zone of a sniper from a nearby stronghold.
Listen for gunfire, try to determine its location, and give it a wide berth. Look and listen for other signs
such as smoke, lights in windows, human voices, or the sound of machinery. Again, watch for the bodies.
Mounds of corpses, especially those facing one direction, denote a concerted attempt by the undead to
reach an objective. The fact that they fell in the same place could mean that a well-trained sniper picked
them off from a fixed range. If you feel yourself close to humans, do not attempt to contact them. Making
recognizable noises or shouting, “Don’t shoot!” along the way will only attract the undead.
F. Enter by Dawn, Leave by Dusk
Unless the city is too large to traverse by daylight, never stop and rest within its limits. As has been said
before, the perils suffered by rural nocturnal travel multiply a hundredfold in an urban setting. If you find
yourself entering a city with only several hours of daylight remaining, retreat back into the countryside for
the night. If you find yourself near a city’s limits with only minutes to sundown, keep going until you are
well clear before stopping to make camp. This is the one time when traveling by night is acceptable. The
countryside in darkness is always safer (relatively) than the city in broad daylight.
G. Sleep with an Escape
Some cities may be logistically impossible to cross in one day. Especially now, with urban sprawl and
“in-fill” (the development of land between two urban centers), it is becoming more difficult to define a
city’s limits. In these cases, it will be necessary to find a suitable place to sleep or, at least, rest for the
following day. Look for buildings, preferably no more than four stories, situated close to (but not
touching) each other. A building with a flat roof and only one entrance is your best temporary shelter.
First, ensure that you can jump safely from one roof to another. Second, seal the door to your roof. If
that proves impossible, barricade it with items that will make the greatest possible noise if broken. Third,
always have a long-term escape plan as well as a short-term one. If zombies do stumble onto the roof,
waking you in time to jump to the next roof, possibly the next one, and finally making it to the street, what
then? Without a long-term escape plan, all you will have done is jumped into the proverbial fire.
ALTERNATE MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION
1. BY AIR
Statistics have shown that flying is the safest way to travel. When escaping an infested area, this could not
be more true. Time en route compresses to minutes. Terrain and other physical barriers become
insignificant. The need for food, supplies, practically every lesson of this chapter, fades as you soar well
above the heads of teeming ghouls. However, traveling by air does have its disadvantages. Depending on
the type of aircraft and the conditions in question, these disadvantages could cancel any perk of taking to
the air.
A. Fixed-Wing Aircraft
For speed and availability, nothing beats the standard airplane, assuming at least one person in your
group knows how to fly one. Fuel will literally be a matter of life and death. If your journey requires a
refueling stop, make sure you know its exact location and can be assured of a safe arrival. In the first
stages of outbreaks, many private citizens have taken off in their private planes with no knowledge of
their destination. Many crashed, while others tried to refuel at infested areas. In one case, a former stunt
pilot flew his plane out of the danger zone, ran out of fuel, and attempted to parachute to safety. By the

time he touched down, every zombie within a ten-mile radius had seen his plane crash and were slowly
approaching his position. (The result was reported by another pilot.) Pontoon aircraft negates this
potential hazard (provided you remain over water). However, ditching in the middle of a lake or ocean
may leave you safe from ghouls but not from nature. Read accounts of World War II pilots who spent
weeks in life rafts after being shot down, and you may want to think twice before climbing into your
amphibious bird.
B. Helicopter
The ability to land on any structure, at any time, presents a giant leap above fixed-wing aviation. Running
out of fuel is not a death sentence, as you do not need an airstrip to land. But what if you come down in a
hostile environment? The noise alone will announce your presence. Apply the same rules of fixed-wing
aircraft concerning refueling.
C. Balloon
One of the most primitive flying machines is actually one of the most efficient. A balloon, either hot-air or
helium, can remain aloft for weeks. The disadvantage, however, is a lack of propulsion. Balloons depend
largely on wind and thermal currents to carry them. Unless you have extensive experience, heading off in
a balloon may do little more than leave you hanging helplessly above hostile ground.
D. Airship
They may look ridiculous, they may be almost impossible to find, but if you’re looking to travel by air,
nothing is better than a helium-filled dirigible. These blimps, perfected during World War I and well on
their way to replacing airplanes, were almost abandoned after the Hindenburg disaster of 1937. Today
they exist as little more than floating billboards or airborne cameras for sporting events. During an
infestation, however, they combine the longevity of a balloon with the mobility and all-terrain landing
ability of a helicopter. Airships have been used four times during zombie outbreaks—once for escape,
once for study, and twice for search-and-destroy missions. All were resounding successes.
2. BY WATER
Boats, in almost any form, have been found to be the safest form of transport during an attack. As stated
previously, although zombies do not use their lungs and can travel underwater, they lack the coordination
to swim. For this reason, traveling by boat has many of the same advantages as flying. Many times,
people escaping across some body of water have looked down to see ghouls looking up at them from
the bottom. Even if the keel of their boat is less than an inch out of the zombie’s reach, the humans inside
have nothing to fear. Studies have shown that over-water escapes have a survival ratio five times that of
land. Because most of the United States is riddled with rivers and canals, transport is theoretically
possible for hundreds of miles. In some cases, humans using boats as artificial islands on lakes or ponds
have existed for weeks while the shores swarmed with living dead.
A. Types of Propulsion
1. Motor: Fossil fuel allows not only greater speed but unmatched control in any type of waterway. The
obvious drawback, however, is its finite supply. Again, either make sure you have enough fuel for the
entire voyage or know exactly where safe, plentiful stocks are kept. Another problem is, as can be
expected, noise. Traveling at slower speeds will conserve fuel but also alert every zombie within earshot
of the bank (a slow engine makes as much noise as a fast one). Fossil-fueled engines do have their place.
In a pinch, they can provide an extra burst of power. Use them only when necessary, and always be

careful.
2. Sail: Wind is a consistent source of energy. Harnessing it will allow you to travel without the worry of
rationing fuel. Other than the flapping of loose sails, wind-powered craft have the noise signature of
floating kelp—almost zero. Unfortunately, wind is also highly unpredictable. A calm day could leave you
stranded; a strong gale could cause you to capsize. Nine times out of ten, the wind will not be blowing in
the right direction. Even if it is, slowing or stopping won’t be as easy as turning off the engine. Any novice
can pilot a motorboat like a Boston whaler, but sailing requires skill, patience, intelligence, and years of
practice. Remember this before you run to the nearest day sailor, hoist the jib, and find the wind blowing
directly toward the living dead.
3. Muscle: What could be simpler than rowing? With a little practice, anyone can propel, and maneuver,
his own craft. Here the greatest disadvantage is as simple as humanity: We tire. This should be taken into
account when planning your seaborne journey. How far do you have to go? How many people are
traveling with you? Even with taking turns at the oars, can you reach your destination before everyone is
exhausted? Unless you have a backup motor or sail, be careful when planning journeys that are entirely
dependent on human muscle. Remember, humans require rest; zombies do not. Why put yourself in a
situation that pits our greatest weakness against their greatest strength?
GENERAL RULES:
The worst thing you can do when stepping into a boat is believe that the danger is over. This false sense
of security has caused the death of hundreds of people, victims who could have easily been survivors if
they had kept their guard up and their minds working. Escaping by water is no different than by air or
land. Warnings must be heeded, rules must be followed, and lessons must be learned inside and out for a
safe and successful voyage.

ON THE ATTACK
In July 1887, the South Island of New Zealand was the scene of a small outbreak at a farmhouse near
Omarama. Although the initial stages of the attack are unknown, reports state that by dusk, a group of
fourteen armed men dispatched three zombies in the surrounding countryside, then converged on the
house for what was to be an easy mop-up. One man was sent to reconnoiter the house. He entered;
screams, moans, and shots were heard; then nothing. Another man was sent in. At first all was quiet. He
was seen leaning out of an upstairs window, shouting that he had found a half-eaten body but nothing
else. Suddenly a decomposing arm appeared behind him, grabbed his hair, and pulled him inside. The
others raced in to help him. No sooner had they entered the house when five zombies attacked from all
directions. Long hand weapons such as axes and scythes were useless in tight quarters. The same was
true of long-barreled rifles. Wild pistol shots accidentally killed three men outright and wounded another
two. At the height of the melee, one of the survivors panicked, raced from the house, grabbed a lantern,
and threw it through a window. A subsequent search found only charred skeletons.
This chapter is designed to help plan a civilian search-and-destroy mission. As has been stated before,
various government agencies will have their own equipment and doctrine (hopefully) for dealing with such
unconventional warfare. If they show up, great. Sit back, relax, and watch your tax dollars hard at work.
But as has also been stated before, what if those we pay and expect to protect us are nowhere to be
found? In this case, responsibility for eradicating the undead menace is up to you and those you can
convince to join you. Every rule, every tactic, every tool and weapon in this section have been carefully
tailored for just such a contingency. All have been taken from actual combat. All have been tested and
proven battle-ready for that moment when retreat has ended and the time has come to hunt the hunters.

TRANSPORTATION
Unlike the scenario described in “On the Run,” the goal of this section is to help you not escape an area
but sweep it. The undead are not to be avoided but attracted. Also, unlike the previous chapter, you will
not be alone, and the support area should make fueling and servicing a vehicle much easier. With this in
mind, using the noise from a car’s engine will act like a lure. (See “Strategies.”) In this instance, removing
the rubber from a bicycle’s tires can accomplish the same result. Do not become too dependent on your
vehicles. Unless applied to a specific strategy (see below), use them more as a means of getting to and
from a battle site. Once in the target area, dismount and search on foot. This will allow for greater
flexibility, particularly in urban areas.
TERRAIN TYPES

At first, this section might seem redundant. However, unlike “On the Run,” which teaches how to use
terrain to escape, this will teach you how to use it to hunt. This time you are not simply passing through
your environment as quickly, quietly, and easily as possible. As a hunter, you are here to reclaim this
land—hold it, sweep it, cleanse it until every trace of the undead is gone. This section includes only
information necessary to do just that.
1. FOREST
When hunting, watch for freshly eaten carcasses. Try to determine if the predator was an animal or a
zombie. Also, use the trees to extend your visibility: Each one can serve as a lookout post or sniper
platform. Set fires only as a last-ditch effort.
2. PLAINS
Vast, open areas provide great visibility, allowing full use of long-range sharpshooting weapons. One
team of five with adequately sighted rifles and plenty of ammunition can clear several square miles in the
course of a single day. Of course, great visibility allows the undead to see you as readily as you see them.
Hunter groups operating on plains or prairie have reported being sighted and stalked by ghouls from as
far as ten miles away. Another slight but still potential danger is posed by the odd zombie who may be
lying in the tall grass. Undead who have lost their legs or had their spinal columns severed can remain
undetected until it is too late. If your team is traveling through tall grass, travel slowly, watch the ground,
and listen for any rustling or moans.
3. FIELDS
Unsuspecting hunters have chased zombies through a field only to be grabbed by another one lurking
inches away! Unless you are ordered to protect the harvest, or the food itself is of vital importance, this is
one case in which fire should be used first. Although almost every other word in this book stresses the
control of incendiary warfare, common sense dictates that no human life is worth an acre or two of maize.
4. TUNDRA
One potential danger, not experienced in other environments, is that of a multigenerational outbreak.
Because of cold weather’s preservative ability, zombies may remain frozen for decades. When thawed,
they will join the ranks of the recently reanimated and, in some cases, can re-infect an entire area. Frozen
tundra, more than any other environment, requires not only a tireless search but a heightened alert status
during the next year’s spring thaw.
5. HILLS
Rolling terrain can be as treacherous and pose as great a threat from zombies as it can from any human
enemy. If possible, always take the high ground and hold it. This allows greater visibility for you. As crazy
as this sounds, remember that ghouls have limited dexterity. Apply this fact to their climbing skills, and
what you have is a mass of zombies struggling unsuccessfully to get up the slope while you pick them off
one by one.
6. DESERT

The problems discussed in “On the Run” are doubled when operating in a desert. Unlike the escapee,
your team of hunters will be out during the brightest, hottest, most excruciating part of the day. Make
sure each hunter is well supplied with water and anti-sunstroke accessories. Combat, unlike travel, will
require more energy and therefore increase the risk of dehydration. Do not ignore the signs. One
incapacitated member can cripple an entire team, allowing the undead to quickly turn the tables on you.
Losing touch with your supply base, becoming isolated even for a day, takes on a whole new meaning in
this life-threatening environment.
7. URBAN
If the goal were only to kill zombies, an urban area could simply be bombed or burned to the ground.
That would “secure” it, but where would the survivors live with their homes a pile of rubble? Urban
combat is the most difficult for a variety of reasons. For starters, it takes the longest amount of time
because every building, every room, every subway tunnel, every car, every sewer pipe, every nook and
cranny of this massive maze must be searched. Chances are, given a city’s importance, your civilian
group will be working side by side with government forces. If this is not the case, however, be extremely
cautious. Always think conservatively when it comes to team members, time, and resources (food, water,
ammo). Cities have a way of swallowing them all up.
8. JUNGLE
This is a close-combat nightmare. Sniper rifles and other long-range weapons such as crossbows will be
next to useless. Equip your team with carbines and/or shotguns. Machetes must be carried by each
hunter, both for clearing foliage and for hand-to-hand combat. Use of fire will not be an option because
the intense moisture will dampen most attempts to start one. Keep your team together at all times, be
hyperalert, and listen carefully to the sounds of nearby wildlife. As with forests and swamps, they will be
your only warning system.
9. SWAMP
Many of the aspects of jungle warfare can apply to marshes as well. They may not always be as hot or as
dense, but this does not mean they are any safer. Pay close attention to the water. All equipment and
tactics applied to subaquatic warfare and discussed later will most likely be employed in this scenario as
well.
STRATEGIES
1. LURE AND DESTROY
Use one or more vehicles, large pickup trucks, or SUVs to enter an infested area. Once inside, make as
much noise as possible to draw the undead to you. Exit the area slowly, matching the speed of your
pursuers. Like the Pied Piper, you will soon acquire a tail of zombies, a grisly parade slouching after you.
At this point, sharpshooters posted at the back of the vehicles can proceed to take them down. The
pursuing ghouls will not realize what is happening, as their primitive brains will not notice that their
comrades are falling all around them. Continue to lead them from the area, thinning their ranks until none
are left. Use this tactic in urban zones (when the roads are clear) or where natural environments allow
long vehicular journeys.
2. THE BARRICADE

This tactic works similarly to “Lure and Destroy,” only instead of leading the undead on for miles, your
bait will draw them to a fixed position. This position could be constructed of debris, hastily erected
barbed wire, wrecked cars, or your own vehicles. From the fixed position, your team will stand its
ground, killing the zombies before they can overrun the barricade. In this instance, incendiary devices are
ideal. Chances are, that the approaching zombies will be tightly packed by the time they reach your
position. Molotovs or (and only in this one case) a flamethrower would utterly destroy their ranks.
Barbed wire or other similar obstacles should be used to slow an advance and further concentrate
targets. If incineration is not an option, simple marksmanship will accomplish the same task. Make sure
your distances are measured and your rounds are expended wisely. Always watch your flanks. If
possible, make sure the zone of approach is narrow and contained. Always have your escape route
ready, but keep control of the team to avoid a premature retreat. Use the Barricade tactic in urban areas
or those that provide great visibility. Specifically exclude jungles, swamps, or thick forests.
3. THE TOWER
Find an area high above ground (a tree, building, water tower, etc.). Stock this position with enough
ammunition and basic supplies for a protracted battle (longer than one full day). Once all these tasks have
been accomplished, do everything you can to attract the dead. As they gather around your position,
begin the slaughter. Be careful when using incendiaries, as fire may spread to the tower or smoke may
become a health risk.
4. MOBILE TOWER
Drive a garbage truck, semi, or other tall vehicle into the heart of an infested area. Establish a kill zone
with good visibility, park, and commence the attack. The advantages of this tactic include never being
shackled to an existing tower, already luring the dead with your vehicle’s engine, and (provided your
cabin is always clear) a guaranteed means of escape.
5. THE CAGE
If you don’t believe in cruelty to animals, don’t try this on a sweep. It basically involves placing an animal
in a cage, positioning your team within weapons range of that cage, then picking off the zombies that
come to devour said animal. Of course, several factors need to be considered for this tactic to work. The
live bait must be loud enough to attract any nearby ghouls. The cage must be strong enough to resist an
attack and anchored well enough to resist being pushed. Your team needs to be hidden so as not to
attract zombies to its position. They must also take care not to hit and kill the caged animal. Silent, dead
bait will quickly foil the cage strategy. Environments least suited to a cage approach are those with little
or no cover for your team. Avoid its use in plains, tundra, or open desert.
6. THE TANK
Obviously, any civilian group will not have access to a real tank or armored personnel carrier. What
might be available is an armored car, the type used to transport valuable commodities. In this case, the
commodity will be your team. Using a “tank” is very similar to the cage tactic in that your goal is to attract
the zombies to a specific location, then dispose of them with rifle fire. But unlike the cage, your team
members within the tank’s cabin are not simply live bait. Firing slits enable them to add another level of
firepower to those of the external snipers. Be aware, however, of the possibility that undead may tip your
armored car on its side.
7. THE STAMPEDE

Of all hunting methods used against the dead, this is perhaps the most theatrical. Basically, the “process”
involves dividing your party into teams, boarding a number of motor vehicles, driving through the infested
area, and running over every zombie they find. Despite the image of a modern-day stampede, from which
this tactic gets its name, it has been all but abandoned by knowledgeable hunting groups. Hitting a ghoul
with a vehicle rarely results in a kill. More likely, the animated corpse is left crippled, crawling around
with a shattered spinal column and useless legs. Always plan to follow up your “high-speed chase” with
hours of mopping up by a team of dismounted hunters. If you do decide on the stampede tactic, use it in
plains, desert, tundra, and other wide-open areas. Urban zones present too many obstacles, such as
wrecked cars or abandoned barricades. Too often, stampeding hunters have found their paths blocked
and their situation radically reversed. Avoid swamps or wetlands entirely.
8. MOTORIZED SWEEP
Almost the polar opposite of a Stampede, the Motorized Sweep is a slow, calm, methodical approach.
Your hunters, traveling in large, powerful, well-protected vehicles, at speeds no greater than ten miles an
hour, patrol the infested area. Sharpshooters pick off the undead, one shot at a time, until none are left
standing. Trucks work best because they offer snipers an easier, safer vantage point from the roof.
Although this tactic reduces the mop-up time of a Stampede, each body will still have to be inspected
and disposed of. Open areas are ideal for the Motorized Sweep, although the slower speed involved
allows limited use of this tactic in urban areas. As with all motorized vehicles, avoid dense and/or tropical
areas. Once again, as with the Stampede, you will still need to plan for an extensive mopping-up period.
Taking potshots from the roof of your Chevrolet Suburban will not get that last zombie at the bottom of
the pond, locked in a closet, wandering the sewers, or lurking in a basement.
9. AIRBORNE SWEEP
What could be safer than attacking your enemy from the air? With several helicopters, couldn’t your
team cover more ground in less time with no risk at all? In theory, yes; in practice, no. Any student of
conventional warfare will acknowledge the need for ground troops, no matter how superior an air force
is. This applies tenfold for hunting the undead. Forget using air attacks in urban, forest, jungle, swamp, or
any other canopied terrain. Chances are your kill rate will drop to under 10 percent. Forget also the idea
of a clean, painless sweep, even in a high-visibility zone. Your team will still have to mop up no matter
how secure it appears. Air support does have its uses, especially in forward spotting and transport.
Planes or helicopters, scouting in open areas, can provide zombie location data for multiple hunter teams
simultaneously. Blimps have the advantage of lingering over the infested area all day, providing a constant
stream of information and warning against possible ambushes. Helicopters can provide immediate
assistance to those in trouble, lifting one team to the aid of another. Be cautious, however, about using
your “eye in the sky,” so far ahead of the group. Mechanical failures could cause a forced landing in
highly infested areas. Not only would the chopper crew be endangered—so would any team member
attempting to rescue them.
What about parachuting hunters into an infested zone? This theory has been suggested many times
although never put into practice. It is daring, it is courageous, it is heroic, and it is utterly insipid! Forget
being injured on impact, tangled in trees, blown off course, lost on landing—forget all the possibilities
associated with normal parachute jumps in regular peacetime conditions. If you want to know the true
danger of an airborne attack against zombies, try dropping a square centimeter of meat on a swarming
anthill. Chances are, that meat will never touch the ground. In short, air support is just that: “support.”
People who believe it to be a war-winner have no business planning, orchestrating, or participating in any
conflict with the living dead.

10. THE FIRESTORM
Provided the blaze can be controlled, the area in question is suitably flammable, and property protection
is not an issue, nothing works better than an artificial blaze. Zone boundaries must be clearly delineated.
Set a simultaneous fire to the entire perimeter so that the flames march steadily inward. Do not allow for
an escape route, no matter how narrow. Keep watch for zombies that may have wandered through the
flames. In theory, the storm will herd the dead into a tight perimeter, incinerating them in minutes.
Mopping up will still be required, however, especially in urban areas, where basements and other rooms
may have shielded zombies from the flames. As always, use caution, and be ready to deal with fire as a
secondary enemy.
11. UNDERWATER BATTLES
Never forget the possibility of ghouls stumbling into nearby water before you declare an area secure. Too
often humans have repopulated “cleared” zones only to be attacked days, weeks, even months later by
zombies who have just recently found their way back to dry land. Because the undead can exist, operate,
even kill in a liquid environment, hunting them may require occasional underwater warfare. This can be
extremely hazardous, as water is not the natural environment for humans. The obvious problems of
breathing and lack of communication, mobility, and visibility make an underwater zone the most difficult
for hunting the undead. Unlike escaping by water, in which you have the advantage over them, searching
and sweeping this alien environment will tip the balance firmly in a zombie’s favor. This does not mean
that an underwater hunt is impossible. Far from it. Ironically, its difficulty has been known to keep hunters
more alert and focused than in more familiar environments. The following general rules apply to any
successful subaquatic hunt.
A. Know Your Zone
How deep is the body of water in question? How wide? Is it landlocked (pond, lake, reservoir)? If not,
where are the exits to larger bodies of water? How is underwater visibility? Are there any sunken
obstacles? Answer all these questions before proceeding with the hunt.
B. Scan from the Surface
Hooking on scuba gear and blindly diving into zombie-infested water is a wonderful way to mix the two
childhood terrors of being eaten and drowning. Never submerge before thoroughly searching the area
from shore, dock, or boat. If murky conditions or extreme depth prevent the use of naked eyesight,
artificial means can always be employed. Sonar devices, common echo rangers found in civilian fishing
boats, can easily detect something as large as a human body. Surface scans do not always confirm
whether a zone is infested or clear. Underwater obstacles such as trees, rock formations, or sunken
debris can obscure a zombie’s shape. If even a single one turns up, however, the next rule should be
observed.
C. Consider Drainage
Why place your team in a hostile environment if that environment can be removed? Ask yourself the
question: Is it possible to just empty the body of water? If so, even if it costs more time and effort than a
submarine hunt, by all means proceed. Most of the time, however, this is not a viable option. To eliminate
the menace below, your team will have to follow it down.
D. Find an Expert

Are any of your team licensed scuba divers? Have any of them ever worn scuba gear? How about simply
snorkeling while on vacation? Sending inexperienced men and women underwater could kill them all even
before they make contact with zombies. Drowning, asphyxiation, nitrogen narcosis, and hypothermia are
only a few of the numerous ways that air-breathing animals such as ourselves can meet their fate beneath
the waves. If time permits—for instance, if zombies are cornered in a landlocked body of water—find
someone to either train and lead your team, or even to undertake the mission on his own. But if you
believe that zombies have fallen into a river and could wind up near another town soon, waiting for the
experts is not an option. Be ready to take the plunge, but be ready for the consequences.
E. Prepare Your Gear
As with land warfare, the right equipment and weapons will be crucial to your survival. The most
common respiratory aid is scuba (Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus). If none is available,
jury-rigged compressors and rubber hoses provide a workable if not perfect substitute. Handheld
searchlights are a necessity. Even in the clearest water, zombies could be lurking in sheltered, darkened
nooks. Spear guns should always be thought of as a primary weapon. Their ability for skull penetration
from a safe distance is shared by no other aquatic weapon. Another powerful device is the diver’s “bang
stick,” essentially a twelve-gauge shotgun shell at the end of a metal pole. Both these weapons are rare,
however, in all but coastal areas. In their absence, look for nets, hooks, or homemade harpoons.
F. Integrated Attack
Nothing is more frightening than surfacing from an underwater sweep to find zombies waiting on your
boat! Always work in concert with surface units. If your team consists of ten people, take five
underwater and leave the rest “on the roof.” This will allow for a quick rescue if the tide of battle turns. A
surface group can also aid in scouting, killing, and calling in reinforcements from land. As a general rule of
all combat strategies, the more dangerous the environment, the more support is necessary.
G. Observe Wildlife
We have already established that birds and animals can signal the approach of zombies. The same is true
for fish. It has been proven that aquatic wildlife can detect even minute traces of Solanum-infected flesh
as it floats off a zombie’s body. Once they do they consistently and immediately flee the area.
Underwater hunters have always reported zones completely devoid of fish right before encountering an
underwater zombie.
H. Killing Methods
Do not discount any of these tactics as fantastic or unreliable. As ludicrous as some of them may sound,
all have been repeatedly tested in antizombie, underwater combat. All have shown remarkable success.
1. Sniping: Substitute a speargun for a rifle and water for air, and it is basically the same tactic. As a
speargun requires less range than a rifle, the diver will find himself in greater danger. If the first shot
misses, never reload on the spot! Swim to a safe distance, lock in another spear, then re-engage your
target.

2. Spearfishing: This is used if a head shot proves too difficult. Attach a metal line to the end of the
spear, and aim for the ribcage. Once the zombie is skewered, your surface team can haul it up for
disposal. Keep in mind that these zombies still have the ability to attack. If possible, try for a head shot
from a rifle the second they break the surface. This will require great coordination between a diver and
the surface team. One past foul-up resulted in an unwary team hauling what they believed was a
destroyed zombie to the surface. Their screams were not heard by the incompetent diver below.
3. Hook and Line: Attach a harpoon to a section of rope. Use it to spear the targeted zombie, then have
your surface team haul it up. Boat or meathooks, fastened to the end of the harpoon, decrease the
chances of losing your target during the ascent. If the water is clear and shallow enough, the process of
harpooning could be conducted entirely from aboard a boat. Again, as with the spearfishing, the
“reeled-in” ghoul must be disposed of before it comes close enough to strike.
4. Netting: Surface teams will be your primary source of attack, with divers acting only as scouts. Fish
or cargo nets should be dropped on the targeted ghoul, then used to bring them to the surface. One
major advantage of netting is that the zombies you haul aboard should be too tangled in the net to strike
out at you. Of course, “should” is a very dangerous word. Many a hunter was fatally wounded by
zombies that “should” have been easy kills.
I. Specific Rules
Think of bodies of water as different types of terrain. Each will have its own set of conditions and can be
as different from one another as a desert is from a swamp. About the only thing some bodies of water
have in common is the H2O that covers them. You already have one deadly enemy to contend with.
Don’t make another one.
1. Rivers: Constant currents can be both a blessing and a curse. Depending on the strength of its currents
a river can wash any and all zombies well away from the initial infested area. Ghouls that fall into the
Mississippi near Winona, Minnesota, could easily wash ashore a week later in downtown New Orleans.
This creates a sense of urgency not found with landlocked pools. If possible, set up nets at the narrowest
points. Monitor them carefully, and exercise extreme caution when sending divers in to investigate. A
strong current can carry them right into the waiting arms and open mouths of their “targets.”
2. Lakes and Ponds: Because they are landlocked (generally), there is little chance for zombies to
escape from a lake or a pond. Any undead wandering back to shore could be sighted and killed. Those
remaining submerged will be eventually fished out and destroyed. The lack of any current makes them an
ideal location for divers. Lakes and ponds that freeze over present a multigenerational problem. If they
freeze solid, the submerged will become entombed for the winter, making them almost impossible to find.
If only the surface freezes, zombies could still prowl the water’s dark depths.

3. Swamps: These are easily the most frustrating places for an underwater hunt. Their murky waters
make diving next to impossible. Their root-riddled bottoms confound echo sounders. In most cases, their
shallow bottoms make it easy for a zombie to simply reach up and either grab a hunter or capsize his
boat. Hunting in large numbers with extensive use of searchlights and probing poles is the only proven
method for sweeping this environment. After one of these arduous campaigns, you will know why so
many tales of terror have their origin in the swamp.
4. Oceans: Unless the area in question is a harbor or other semi-enclosed area, forget about any
successful hunts in the open seas. There is simply too much space for a real sweep, with depths beyond
the reach of all but the rarest and most expensive submersibles. As problematic as this is for aggressive
hunting, the threat posed by these undersea undead will probably be negligible. Most will simply wander
the ocean floor, never seeing dry land again, until they eventually decay to nothing. This does not mean,
however, that the threat should be ignored. Once it has been confirmed that zombies have been washed
out to sea, determine the deep-water currents in that area and if—and where—they might take the
undead close to land. All coastal inhabitants should be warned and a system of surveillance maintained
for some time after that. Unlikely as it sounds, zombies have been known to slouch out of the surf months
after an outbreak and on beaches thousands of miles away.
So let’s assume that you have followed all these instructions correctly. The battle is over, the area is
secure, the victims have been mourned, the zombies have been burned. Hopefully, this will be the last
time you will ever have to raise your hand to undead flesh. But what if it isn’t? What if your struggle was
merely one small theater of a greater, all-out war between the living and the dead? What if, heaven
forbid, it is a war humanity loses?
LIVING IN AN UNDEAD WORLD
What if the unthinkable happened? If zombie hordes grew large enough to dominate the entire planet?
This would be a Class 4 or doomsday outbreak, in which humanity is driven to the brink of extinction.
Improbable? Yes. Impossible? No. Governments of any type are nothing more than a collection of
human beings—human beings as fearful, shortsighted, arrogant, closed-minded, and generally
incompetent as the rest of us. Why would they be willing to recognize and deal with an attack of walking,
bloodthirsty corpses when most of humanity isn’t? Of course, one could argue that logic such as this
might stand up in the face of a Class 1 or even Class 2 outbreak, but the threat posed by even a few
hundred zombies would surely be enough to galvanize our leaders into action. How could they not? How
could those in power, especially in such a modern, enlightened age as ours, ignore the spread of a deadly
disease until it reached plague proportions? Just look at the world governments’ response to the AIDS
epidemic, and you will have your answer. But what if the “authorities” did recognize the threat for what it
is—and were unable to control it? Massive economic recession, world war, civil unrest, or natural
disasters could easily distract government resources from a rapidly growing outbreak. Even in perfect
conditions, containing anything larger than a Class 2 outbreak is extremely difficult. Imagine trying to
quarantine a large city like Chicago or Los Angeles. Of the millions attempting to escape, how many of
those would already be bitten, spreading the infection far beyond the quarantined area?
But wouldn’t the vast oceans that make up the majority of our planet save us? Wouldn’t those in Europe,
Africa, Asia, and Australia be safe from a festering outbreak in North America? Perhaps. This is

assuming all borders are sealed, all air traffic has ceased, and every world government is aware of and
working to stop the outbreak. Even so, with the undead ranks already in the tens of millions, is it possible
to stop every aircraft with an infected passenger, every ship with an infected crewman? Is it possible to
patrol every inch of coastline to watch for a waterborne ghoul? At this point, sadly, the answer is no.
Time is on the side of the undead. With each day, their ranks will swell, making containment and
extermination more and more difficult. Unlike its human counterparts, an army of zombies is completely
independent of support. It will not require food, ammunition, or medical attention. It will not suffer from
low morale, battle fatigue, or poor leadership. It will not succumb to panic, desertion, or out-and-out
mutiny. Like the virus that gave it life, this undead force will continue to grow, spreading across the body
of this planet until there is nothing left to devour. Where would you go? What would you do?
THE UNDEAD WORLD
When the living dead triumph, the world degenerates into utter chaos. All social order evaporates. Those
in power, along with their families and associates, hole up in bunkers and secure areas around the
country. Secure in these shelters, originally built for the Cold War, they survive. Perhaps they continue
the façade of a government command structure. Perhaps the technology is available to communicate with
other agencies or even other protected world leaders. For all practical purposes, however, they are
nothing more than a government-in-exile. With the total collapse of law and order, small bands of
individuals emerge to assert their authority. Looters, bandits, and common thugs prey on the survivors,
taking what they want and indulging in whatever pleasure they can find. It is common at the end of any
civilization to have one last massive party. As perverse as it sounds, orgies of people believing that this
day is their last spring up all around the nation.
What police and military forces are left serve as protection for the government in hiding, desert in an
attempt to save their families, or degenerate into bandits themselves. A total collapse in communication
and transportation sweeps the globe. Isolated cities become open battlegrounds, with scattered groups of
citizens fighting to defend barricaded areas from both ghouls and human renegades. Neglected machines
eventually break down or, in some cases, blow up. Reactor meltdowns and other industrial accidents are
common, polluting the landscape with toxic chemical by-products. The countryside flourishes with
zombies. With cities picked clean of humans, the undead fan out in search of prey. Country homes and
suburban neighborhoods are torn to shreds as citizens flee, attempt to stand and fight, or wait helplessly
for the slouching multitudes to engulf them. The carnage is not limited to humans: The air is thick with the
shrieks of farm animals trapped in pens, or even family pets trying bravely to protect their masters.
As time passes, the fires die, the explosions cease, the screams fade. Fortified areas begin to run low on
supplies, forcing the occupants to face their undead attackers during foraging missions, evacuations, or
battles driven by desperate insanity. Casualties will continue to mount as many well-protected and
well-supplied but weak-willed humans take their own lives out of sheer despair.
The looters previously mentioned fare no better than any other human. These modern-day barbarians
became such because of their disrespect for law, their hatred of organization, their choice of destruction
over creation. Their nihilistic, parasitic existence feeds off the riches of others instead of producing their
own. This mentality prevents them from settling down and building a new life. They are always on the run,
fighting off the undead no matter where they stop. Even if they succeed in fending off this external threat,
their need for anarchy eventually leads them to turn on each other. Many of these societies will be held
together by the strong personality of a chieftain. Once he or she is gone, there will be nothing to hold the
group together. A disbanded gang of thugs, wandering aimlessly through hostile ground, cannot survive
forever. After several years, little will be left of these ruthless human predators.
It is difficult to say what will happen to the remnants of government. This will depend greatly on which
country we are talking about, what resources it had before the crisis, and what type of government it

was. A society living for ideals such as democracy or religious fundamentalism stands a greater chance of
survival. These survivors will not need to depend on the personal magnetism (or intimidation) of a single
individual. Some Third World dictator might hold his minions together only as long as he survives. As
with the barbarian gangs, his demise, or even a simple display of weakness, could spell the end for the
entire “government.”
But no matter what happens to the surviving humans, there will always be the walking dead. With glazed
eyes and gawking mouths, their putrid forms will cover the earth, hunting all living things within their
grasp. Some species of animals will undoubtedly face extinction. Others who are able to escape this fate
may find ways to adapt and even thrive in a radically changed ecosystem.
This post-apocalyptic world will appear as a devastated landscape: burned-out cities, silent roads,
crumbling homes, abandoned ships rusting offshore, gnawed and bleached bones scattered over a world
now ruled by machines of walking dead flesh. Fortunately, you will not see this, because before it
happens, you will be nowhere near!
STARTING OVER
In “On the Defense,” you learned how to prepare a space for what could be a long siege until rescue. In
“On the Run,” you learned how to travel for what could be great distances until reaching safety. Now it is
time to imagine and prepare for a worst-case scenario. In this scenario, you and your closest friends and
family must be able to escape all civilization, find a remote, uninhabited corner of our planet (there are
more than you think), and rebuild your life from scratch. Imagine a group of shipwrecked survivors on an
island, or a human colony on a new planet. This must be your mind-set to survive. No one is coming for
you, no rescue planned. There are no friendly forces to run to, no battle lines to hide behind. The old life
is gone forever! The new one, in terms of both quality and duration, will be entirely up to you. As
horrifying as this prospect sounds, remember that humans have been adapting and rebuilding since the
beginning of our history. Even today, when society appears to have softened us beyond redemption, the
will to survive is deep within our genes. Ironically, in a worst-case scenario, your greatest challenge will
be dealing with day-to-day life and not the living dead. In fact, if your survival strategy works perfectly,
you may never even see a zombie. Your goal is to create a safe little microcosm of the world, equipped
with everything you will need to not only survive but maintain a modicum of civilization.
And when is the best time to start? Immediately! An all-out war might never happen. It might be years
away. But what if it’s soon? What if a Class 1 outbreak has already begun and is going unchecked?
What if a Class 2 or even Class 3 outbreak has begun in a totalitarian country where the press is highly
censored? If so, an all-out war could be months away. In all probability, this is not the case. But is it any
reason not to be prepared? Unlike stocking up for a siege, preparing to re-create a tiny corner of
civilization takes a tremendous amount of time. The more you have, the better off you will be. Does this
mean you should give up your entire life and do nothing but prepare for the end of the world? Of course
not. This text was prepared to coincide with the average citizen’s conventional lifestyle. Minimum
preparation, however, should take no less than 1,500 hours. Even if spread over the course of several
years, this is a formidable amount of time. If you believe you can accomplish everything by “cramming” at
the eleventh hour, by all means, don’t lift a finger now. But you may think twice about beginning to build
your ark once it has already started raining.

TERRAIN TYPES
Examine a map of the world and find the best land and mildest climate. Overlay it with the densest
population, and you will see a perfect match-up. Early humans knew what to look for when they began
to build communities: moderate weather, fertile soil, plentiful fresh water, and a bounty of natural
resources. These prime spots became the first centers of humanity, expanding outward into the modern
population centers we know today. It is this way of thinking, this perfectly logical thought process, that
you will have to completely abandon when choosing your new home. Back to the map. Say you find a
place that looks immediately attractive. Chances are that several million people will be thinking the same
thing when their time comes to flee. Combat this thinking with the slogan “harsher is safer,” and to be as
safe as possible, you will have to find the harshest, most extreme places on Earth. You will have to find
an area that looks so unattractive, so inhospitable, that the last thing you would ever want to do is call it
home. The following list of environments is provided to aid you in making an informed choice.
Supplementary texts will give you more detailed information concerning their exact weather patterns,
available food, water, natural resources, and so on. What this section demonstrates is how they relate to
all the factors associated with an undead world.
1. DESERT
Second only to the polar regions, this is one of the harshest and, therefore, safest environments in the
world. Despite what we see in movies, deserts are rarely oceans of sand. Rocks can easily be broken
and shaped for building comfortable homes and, more important, defensive walls. The more remote your
camp is, the greater chance it will have of avoiding raiders. These renegade scavengers will not be
interested in riding across any deep desert where they know no major outposts exist. What would be the
point? Even if some tried, the intense heat and lack of water would probably kill them off before they
even reached your camp. Zombies, on the other hand, would not suffer from this problem. Heat and
thirst are not part of the equation. The dry air would retard their already-slowed decomposition. If the
chosen desert is situated between populated areas, such as those in the American Southwest, there will
be a very real chance of some discovering your compound. Unless you build your fortification on top of a
hill or large rock formation, the flat terrain will increase the need for artificial defenses.
2. MOUNTAINS
Depending on their location and elevation, this environment offers excellent defense against the living
dead. The steeper the slope, the harder it will be for them to climb. If the mountain in question has no
roads or wide paths, human bandits might also be deterred. Although high elevation allows a better view
of the surrounding countryside, it also makes camouflage more difficult. Visual-concealment measures
must be a top priority, especially where lights and smoke are concerned. Another drawback of the
strategic high ground is its distance from usable resources. Commuting to level ground for food, water,
and building materials will compromise your security. Consequently, the mountaintop you choose may not
be the highest or easily defended but must contain all you need to survive.
3. JUNGLE
The opposite of deserts, jungles or tropical rainforests will provide all the water, food, and building
materials you need as well as a host of medicinal vegetation, burning fuel, and instant camouflage. The
thick foliage acts as a noise buffer, insulating sounds that would travel miles in the open. Unlike what we
saw in “On the Attack,” where the terrain will work against a team of hunters, the absence of visibility
and muddy earth are perfectly suited for a defensive posture. Bandit groups can be easily ambushed and
destroyed. Individual zombies can be dispatched without alerting others. There are, of course, negatives

associated with this equatorial ecosystem. Moisture breeds life, which includes millions of species of
bio-organisms. Disease will be a constant threat. Any cuts or scrapes could turn rapidly gangrenous.
Food will decompose much more quickly than in drier climates. Metal gear must be watched for rust.
Any clothing not rubberized or otherwise treated will rot, literally, off your back. Mold will be
everywhere. The local insect population will be your most constant enemy. Some will be mere nuisances;
some may have painful, even fatally venomous stings. Some will carry horrible diseases such as yellow
fever, malaria, or dengue fever. One positive natural aspect of jungle survival is that the intense moisture,
coupled with the multitude of microscopic organic life, accelerates undead decomposition. Field tests
have shown at least a 10 percent higher decay rate in jungle-bound zombies. In certain cases, the
percentage has been as high as 25! What all these factors equal out to is an environment with many
natural hardships but one extremely well-suited to worst-case survival.
4. TEMPERATE FORESTS
This worldwide zone is easily the most comfortable for long-term survival. However, with such attractive
land will come a host of problems. The wilds of Northern Canada are sure to be crowded with refugees.
Caught unprepared, these panicked mobs will surely flee north. For at least the first year, they will roam
the wilderness, stripping the land of food, turning to violence to obtain equipment, perhaps even turning to
cannibalism in the cold winter months. Brigands will no doubt be among them or will follow in the later
years when some decide to attempt a safe settlement. And of course, there is always the zombie threat.
Temperate forests are still relatively close to civilization, as well as being dotted with outposts of
humanity. Ghoul encounters would be ten times as likely as under normal circumstances. With an influx of
refugees, the chances of the undead simply following them north is almost a given. Remember also, the
problem of zombies freezing in the winter and thawing in the summer. Choose an area only if it is isolated
by natural boundaries: mountains, rivers, and so on. Anything less—even if it seems far from
humanity—will be too much of a risk. Do not believe that the vast expanse of Siberia will be any safer
than Northern Canada. Remember, to the south of this thinly peopled wilderness are both India and
China, the two most populous nations on Earth.
5. TUNDRA
Refugees will not consider these seemingly barren lands capable of supporting life. Those who try will
perish without large stores of supplies, elaborate equipment, or extensive knowledge of the environment.
Bandits will also be hard-pressed to survive. In all probability, none will venture this far north. The living
dead may reach your camp, however. Those that have migrated north following fleeing refugees, or
former refugees now reanimated as zombies, may detect your presence and signal others. Their numbers
will not be great and can be handled by those in your group. All the same, build your defenses strong and
keep constant vigilance. As with temperate forests, be prepared for zombie activity to follow the seasons.
6. POLAR
This environment is, without a doubt, the harshest on the planet. Extremely low temperatures with a high
wind chill can kill an exposed human in seconds. Building materials will consist mainly of ice and snow.
Fuel will be scarce. Medicinal or any other type of plants are unheard of. Food is plentiful but takes skill
and experience to obtain. Even in summer, hypothermia will be a constant danger. Every day will be
spent on the fringe of existence. One mistake regarding food, clothing, shelter, even hygiene could mean
certain death. Many people have heard of Allariallak, the Inuit whose life in the frozen Hudson Bay
region was documented in the film Nanook of the North. Few know that “Nanook” starved to death a
year after that documentary was shot. This is not to say that life in the polar regions is an impossibility.
People have been doing it successfully for thousands of years. What it will take is ten times the
knowledge and determination to even attempt a life at the top or bottom of the world. If you are not
ready to spend at least one winter practicing under these conditions, do not try it when the time to flee

comes. So why go? Why risk death from such a hostile environment when the goal is to stay alive? The
truth is that the environment should be your only worry. Refugees and bandits will never make it that far.
The chance of zombies randomly wandering that far north are one in 35 million (a proven calculated
statistic). As with temperate forests and tundra, you do run the risk of an odd ghoul freezing and thawing
in its travels. If you are camped near a coastline, watch for one possibly brought ashore by the current or
a derelict-infested ship. Coastlines also leave you vulnerable, in the beginning, to pirates. (More on this
concerning islands.) Maintain some means of static defense and always keep alert, although the need for
both is relatively less than for any other environment.
7. ISLANDS
What could be safer than land surrounded on all sides by water? Zombies can’t swim. Doesn’t that mean
living on an island is the obvious choice for a worst-case scenario? To some degree, yes. Its geographical
isolation does negate the possibility of mass zombie migration, something that must be taken into account
when billions will be prowling every continent on the globe. Even islands a few miles offshore will save
you from the writhing, clamoring hordes. For this reason alone, islands are always a preferable choice.
However, just because you decide to live on a rock surrounded by water does not guarantee your
survival. Offshore islands will be the obvious choices for refugees. Anyone with a boat or raft will make
for them. Ruffians will use them as bases from which to conduct raids on the mainland. Offshore islands
may also be destroyed by industrial accidents, some well inland that dump pollution into nearby rivers. To
avoid these immediate dangers, choose an island accessible only by a sturdy craft and expert navigation.
Look for one without a good natural harbor or too many accessible beaches. This will make it less
attractive to other seaborne refugees attempting the same strategy as you. (Remember, purchasing an
island will keep people away only before the crisis! No starving, frantic refugee ship is going to obey a
“keep out” sign.) Look for islands with high cliffs and, if possible, wide, dangerous reefs.
Even with these natural boundaries, construct defenses and maintain concealment. Dangers are still out
there! Pirates, in the beginning phases of the crisis, may cruise from island to island, hoping to scavenge
what they can from survivors. Always keep a lookout for their ships on the horizon. Zombies, too, may
come in many forms. With the world completely infested, many will certainly find themselves roaming the
floors of our oceans. There is the possibility, slight though it may be, of one lumbering up the underwater
slope that leads to your little coastline. Others still wearing lifejackets from mortal life may be carried to
your island by the current. Then there is the chance of a zombie-infested ship, and in a worst-case
scenario, there could be one wrecking on your shore and spilling its deadly cargo. No matter what, do
not destroy your means of escape. Drag your boat onto the beach or keep it camouflaged offshore.
Losing it will mean turning your fortress into a prison.
8. LIVING BY SEA
It has been suggested that, with the right vessel and crew, a group could survive a worst-case scenario
entirely at sea. Theoretically, this is possible, but the odds of its success are astronomical. In the short
run, many people will take to water in everything from two-person sailboats to 80,000-ton freighters.
They will survive on what they have brought aboard, scavenging the world’s infested ports, catching fish,
and distilling fresh water if possible. Pirates in fast, armed private boats will roam the seas. These
modern-day buccaneers already exist today, robbing freighters and yachts along many Third World
coastlines and even strategic choke points. In a worst-case scenario, their numbers will swell to several
thousand, and their targets will not be exclusive. As military ports become overrun, warships not
supporting ground operations will set sail for safer anchorage. In these remote atoll bases, the world’s
navies will wait for the crisis to pass, and wait, and wait.
After several years, time and the elements will take their toll on these ad-hoc seaborne populations. Ships
relying on fossil fuel will eventually run dry, doomed to drift helplessly. Some attempting to scavenge from

abandoned ports and fuel depots may meet their end as zombie food. As medicines and vitamins run out,
diseases such as scurvy will begin to take their toll. Rough seas will destroy many vessels. Pirates will
eventually burn themselves out through infighting, clashes with victims who choose not to be victimized,
and encounters with the occasional living dead. This last contingency will also lead to raider infection,
increasing the danger of seaborne undead. Derelict, zombie ghost ships will float aimlessly across the
world’s oceans, their moans carrying on salty wind. This wind will eventually erode delicate machinery,
including those that purify water and generate power. Within several years, only a few dedicated sailing
ships will ride the waves. All others will be sunk, wrecked, reanimated, or will have simply dropped
anchor in some remote beach, determined to make a go of it on land.
Anyone even entertaining the idea of a seaborne existence must have the following assets:

With all these in place, it might be easier to simply compromise your living conditions. Use your boat as a
movable home as you forage from small island to island, or coastline to coastline. This will be a more
comfortable, safer existence than on the open sea. Even so, keep a watch for zombies in shallow water,
and always, always, watch your anchor line! Theoretically, this type of life is possible, but it is not
recommended.
DURATION
How long will you have to endure this primitive existence? How long before the walking dead simply
crumble to dust? How long before life can return to even a semblance of normality? Sadly, there is no
exact figure. The first zombie to rise will, unless it is frozen, embalmed, or otherwise preserved,
completely decompose after five years. However, by the time the undead have world domination, ten
years might have already passed. (Remember, you will be fleeing when the war begins, not at its end.)
When zombies truly dominate the planet, and there are no more fresh humans to infect, it will truly take
five years for the majority of them to rot away. Dry climate and freezing will preserve many, keeping
them functional for, potentially, decades. Bandits, refugees, and other survivors like yourself may become
further prey, adding a newer but smaller generation to the older, decaying horde. By the time these turn
to dust, the only undead left will be those preserved artificially or constantly refrozen with each winter.
These you will have to watch for decades to come. Your children and even your children’s children will
have to be wary of them. But when will it be safe to come out?
Year 1: A state of emergency is declared. You flee. Your defenses are built; your compound is
established. Labor is divided. A new life begins. All this time, you monitor radio and television
broadcasts, keeping a close watch on the unfolding conflict.
Year 5–10: Somewhere within this time period, the war ends. The dead have won. The signals stop. You
assume that the entire world is overrun. You continue your life, keeping a close eye on defense as bandits
and refugees might begin to enter your zone.
Year 20: After two decades of isolation, you consider sending a scouting party. Doing so will risk
discovery. If the party does not return by a fixed date, you assume they have been lost, perhaps even
divulged your location. You stay hidden. Donot send out another search party, and prepare for battle.
Another party will not be sent out for at least five years. If the scouts do return, their findings will
determine your next course of action.
Your scouts will discover a new world in which one of three scenarios prevails:

No matter what the human (or undead) situation, the animal kingdom will go through its own
metamorphosis. Any creatures unable to escape will be devoured by the living dead. This will lead to the
near-extinction of many species of grazing animals, the chief diet of large predators. Birds of prey will
also face starvation, as will carrion birds (remember that even after a zombie is killed, the flesh remains
poisonous). Even insects, depending upon their size and speed, may find themselves the target of roving
zombies. It is difficult to say what forms of wildlife will inherit the earth. What can be said is that an
undead world will have as much, if not a greater, impact on the global ecosystem as the last ice age.
THEN WHAT?
Post-apocalyptic fiction usually shows the survivors of a new age reclaiming their world in dramatic steps,
such as retaking an entire city. While this makes for exciting imagery, especially in moving pictures, it
does not represent a safe or efficient means of re-colonization. Instead of marching across the George
Washington Bridge to repopulate Manhattan, a safer, smarter, more conservative stance will be to either
expand your existing living space or migrate to a better, if still relatively isolated area. For example, if you
have made your home on a small island, the best choice would be to land on a larger, previously
inhabited island, clean out what zombies are left, and reclaim the abandoned structures as your new
home. On land, the equivalent would be to migrate from, for example, the deep desert or frozen tundra to
the nearest abandoned town. Worst-case survival manuals, as well as many historical texts, will be your
best guide to a complete rebuilding. What they may not instruct you to do, and what you must do, is
make sure that your new, more civilized home is secure! Remember: Yours is the only government, the
only police force, the only army around. Safety will be your responsibility, and although the immediate
danger may have passed, it must never be taken for granted. No matter what you will find, and no matter
what challenges you will face, take heart in the knowledge that you have survived a catastrophe not seen
since the extinction of the dinosaurs, a world ruled by the living dead.
RECORDED ATTACKS
This is not a list of all zombie attacks throughout history. This simply chronicles all attacks for which the
information has been recorded, survived, and been released to the author of this book. Accounts from
societies with an oral history have been more difficult to acquire. Too often these stories have been lost
when their societies have fragmented as a result of war, slavery, natural disasters, or simply the
corruption of international modernization. Who knows how many stories, how much vital
information—perhaps even a cure—has been lost through the centuries. Even in a society as
information-savvy as our own, only a fraction of total outbreaks is reported. This is due, in some part, to
various political and religious organizations that have sworn to keep all knowledge of the living dead
secret. It is also due to ignorance of a zombie outbreak. Those who suspect the truth but fear for their
credibility will, in most cases, withhold the information. This leaves a short but well-documented list.
Note: These events are listed in the chronological order of their occurrence, not discovery.
60,000 B.C., KATANDA, CENTRAL AFRICA
Recent archaeological expeditions discovered a cave on the banks of the Upper Semliki River that
contained thirteen skulls. All had been crushed. Near them was a large pile of fossilized ash. Laboratory
analysis determined the ash to be the remains of thirteen Homo sapiens. On the wall of the cave is a
painting of a human figure, hands raised in a threatening posture, eyes fixed in an evil gaze. Inside its

gaping mouth is the body of another human. This find has not been accepted as a genuine zombie
incident. One school of thought argues that the crushed skulls and burned bodies were a means of ghoul
disposal, while the cave drawing serves as a warning. Other academics demand some type of physical
evidence, such as a trace of fossilized Solanum. Results are still pending. If Katanda’s authenticity is
confirmed, it raises the question of why there was such a large gap between this first outbreak and the
one that followed.
3000 B.C., HIERACONPOLIS, EGYPT
A British dig in 1892 unearthed a nondescript tomb. No clues could be found to reveal who the person
who occupied it was or anything about his place in society. The body was found outside the open crypt,
curled up in a corner and only partially decomposed. Thousands of scratch marks adorned every surface
inside of the tomb, as if the corpse had tried to claw its way out. Forensic experts have revealed that the
scratches were made over a period of several years! The body itself had several bite marks on the right
radius. The teeth match those of a human. A full autopsy revealed that the dried, partially decomposed
brain not only matched those infected by Solanum (the frontal lobe was completely melted away) but also
contained trace elements of the virus itself. Debate now rages as to whether or not this case prompted
late Egyptian specialists to remove the brains from their mummies.
500 B.C., AFRICA
During his voyage to explore and colonize the continent’s western coast, Hanno of Carthage, one of
Western civilization’s most famous ancient mariners, wrote in his sea log:
On the shores of a great jungle, where green hills hide their crowns above the clouds, I dispatched an
expedition inland in search of sweet water. . . . Our soothsayers warned against this action. In their eyes
was a cursed land, a place of demons abandoned by the gods. I ignored their warnings and paid the
highest price. . . . Of the thirty and five men sent, seven returned. . . . The survivors sobbed a tale of
monsters from the jungles. Men with fangs of snakes, claws of leopards, and eyes burning with the fires
of hell. Bronze blades cut their flesh but drew no blood. They feasted upon our sailors, their wails carried
on the wind . . . our soothsayers warned of the wounded survivors, claiming they would bring sorrow on
all they touched. . . . We hastened to our ships, abandoning those poor souls to this land of man-beasts.
May the Gods forgive me.
As most readers know, much of Hanno’s work is controversial and debated among academic historians.
Given that Hanno also describes a confrontation with large, ape-like creatures he dubbed “Gorillas”
(actual gorillas have never inhabited that part of the continent), it can be inferred that both these incidents
were a product either of his imagination or those of later historians. Even with this in mind, and
disregarding the obvious exaggerations of snake’s fangs, leopard’s claws, and burning eyes, Hanno’s
basic description does closely resemble the walking dead.
329 B.C., AFGHANISTAN
An unnamed Macedonian column built by the legendary conqueror Alexander the Great was visited
many times by Soviet Special Forces during their own war of occupation. Five miles from the monument,
one unit discovered the ancient remains of what is believed to be Hellenic Army barracks. Among other
artifacts, there was a small bronze vase. Its inlaid pictures show: (1) one man biting another; (2) the victim
lying on his deathbed; (3) the victim rising up again; and back to (1) biting another man. The circular

nature of this vase, as well as the pictures themselves, could be evidence of an undead outbreak either
witnessed by Alexander or related to him by one of the local tribes.
212 B.C., CHINA
During the Qin Dynasty, all books not relating to practical concerns such as agriculture or construction
were ordered burned by the emperor to guard against “dangerous thought.” Whether accounts of zombie
attacks perished in the flames will never be known. This obscure section of a medical manuscript,
preserved in the wall of an executed Chinese scholar, might be proof of such attacks:
The only treatment for victims of the Eternal Waking Nightmare is complete dismemberment followed by
fire. The patient must be bodily restrained, his mouth filled with straw then bound securely. All limbs and
organs must be removed, avoiding contact with any bodily fluids. All must be burned to ash then
scattered at least twelve li in all directions. No other remedy will suffice as the sickness has no cure . . .
the desire for human meat, unquenchable. . . . If victims are encountered in numbers, with no hopes of
restraining them, immediate decapitation must be used . . . the Shaolin spade being the swiftest weapon
for this task.
There is no mention of the “Eternal Waking Nightmare” victims as actually being dead. Only the section
about craving the flesh of the healthy, and the actual “treatment,” suggest a presence of zombies in ancient
China.
121 A.D., FANUM COCIDI, CALEDONIA (SCOTLAND)
Although the source of the outbreak is unknown, its events are well-documented. The local barbarian
chieftains, believing the undead to be simply insane, sent more than 3,000 warriors to “end this mad
uprising.” The result: More than 600 warriors were devoured, the rest wounded and eventually
transformed into walking dead. A Roman merchant named Sextus Sempronios Tubero, who was
traveling through this province at the time, witnessed the battle. Although not realizing that the walking
dead were just that, Tubero was observant enough to notice that only the decapitated zombies ceased to
be a threat. Barely escaping with his life, Tubero reported his findings to Marcus Lucius Terentius,
commander of the nearest military garrison in Roman Britannia. Less than a day away were well over
9,000 zombies. Following the stream of refugees, these ghouls continued to migrate south, moving
steadily toward Roman territory. Terentius had only one cohort (480 men) at his disposal.
Reinforcements were three weeks away. Terentius first ordered the digging of two seven-foot-deep,
inwardly narrowing ditches that eventually straightened to form a straight, mile-long corridor. The result
looked similar to a funnel opening into the north. The bottoms of both trenches were then filled with
bitumen liquidum (crude oil: common for heating lamps in this part of Britannia). As the zombies
approached, the oil was ignited. All ghouls falling into the trench were trapped in its deep confines and
incinerated. The remainder were forced into the funnel, where no more than 300 could stand abreast.
Terentius ordered his men to draw swords, raise shields, and advance on the enemy. After a nine-hour
battle, every zombie had been decapitated, the still-snapping heads rolled into the ditches for cremation.
Roman casualties numbered 150 dead, no wounded (the legionnaires killed any bitten comrade).
Ramifications from this outbreak were both immediately and historically important. Emperor Hadrian
ordered all information regarding the outbreak to be compiled in one comprehensive work. This manual

not only detailed a zombie’s behavioral pattern and instructions on efficient methods of disposal, it
recommended overwhelming numerical force “to deal with the inevitable panic of the general populace.”
A copy of this document, known simply as “Army Order XXXVII,” was distributed to every legion
throughout the empire. For this reason, outbreaks in areas under Roman rule never reached critical
numbers again and were therefore never reported in detail. It is also believed that this first outbreak
prompted the building of “Hadrian’s Wall,” a structure that effectively isolated Northern Caledonia from
the rest of the island. This is a textbook Class 3 outbreak, and easily the largest on record.
140–41 A.D., THAMUGADI, NUMIDIA (ALGERIA)
Six small outbreaks among desert nomads were recorded by Lucius Valerius Strabo, Roman governor of
the province. All outbreaks were crushed by two cohorts from the III Augusta Legionary base. Total
zombies dispatched: 134. Roman casualties: 5. Other than the official report, a private journal entry by an
army engineer records a significant discovery:
A local family remained imprisoned in their home for at least twelve days while the savage creatures
scratched and clawed fruitlessly at their bolted doors and windows. After we dispatched the filth and
rescued the family, their manner looked near to insane. From what we could gather, the wails of the
beasts, day after day, night after night, proved to be a merciless form of torture.
This is the first known recognition of psychological damage caused by a zombie attack. All six incidents,
given their chronological proximity, make a credible case for one or more ghouls from earlier attacks
“surviving” long enough to re-infect a population.
156 A.D., CASTRA REGINA, GERMANIA (SOUTHERN GERMANY)
An attack by seventeen zombies left a prominent cleric infected. The Roman commander, recognizing the
signs of a newly turned zombie, ordered his troops to destroy the former holy man. Local citizens
became enraged, and a riot ensued. Total zombies dispatched: 10, including the holy man. Roman
casualties: 17, all from the riot. Civilians killed by Roman crackdown: 198.
177 A.D., NAMELESS SETTLEMENT NEAR TOLOSA, AQUITANIA (SW FRANCE)
A personal letter, written by a traveling merchant to his brother in Capua, describes the assailant:
He came from the wood, a man stinking of rot. His gray skin bore many wounds, from which flowed no
blood. Upon seeing the screaming child, his body seemed to shake with excitement. His head turned in
her direction; his mouth opened in a howling moan. . . . Darius, the old legionary veteran, approached . . .
pushing the terrified mother aside, he grabbed the child with one arm, and brought his gladius around with
the other. The creature’s head fell to its feet, and rolled downhill before the rest of his body followed. . . .
Darius insisted they wear leather coverings as they pitched the body into the fire . . . the head, still moving
in a disgusting bite, was fed to the flames.
This passage should be taken as the typical Roman attitude toward the living dead: no fear, no
superstition, just another problem requiring a practical solution. This was the last record of an attack

during the Roman Empire. Subsequent outbreaks were neither combated with such efficiency nor
recorded with such clarity.
 
Although this event appears to have taken place on or about 700 A.D., physical evidence comes in the
form of a painting recently discovered in the vaults of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Analyses of the
materials themselves fix the date listed above. The picture itself shows a collection of knights in full armor,
attacking a mob of ragged men with gray flesh, arrows and other wounds covering their bodies, and
blood dripping from their mouths. As the two forces clash in the center of the frame, the knights bring
their swords down to decapitate their enemies. Three “zombies” are seen in the lower right-hand corner,
crouching over the body of a fallen knight. Some of his armor has been pulled off, one limb ripped from
his body. The zombies feed on the exposed flesh. As the painting itself is unsigned, no one has yet to
determine where this work came from or how it ended up in the museum.
850 A.D., UNKNOWN PROVINCE IN SAXONY (NORTHERN GERMANY)
Bearnt Kuntzel, a friar on his pilgrimage to Rome, recorded this incident in his personal diary. One
zombie wandered out of the Black Forest to bite and infect a local farmer. The victim reanimated several
hours after his demise and turned on his own family. From there, the outbreak spread to the entire village.
Those who survived fled into the lord’s castle, not realizing that some among them had been bitten. As
the outbreak spread even farther, neighboring villagers descended in a mob toward the infested zone.
Local clergy believed that the undead had been infected by the spirit of the devil and that holy water and
incantations would banish the evil spirits. This “holy quest” ended in a massacre, with the entire
congregation either devoured or turned to living dead themselves.
In desperation, neighboring lords and knights united to “purify the devil’s spawn with fire.” This
ramshackle force burned every village and every zombie within a fifty-mile radius. Not even uninfected
humans survived the slaughter. The original lord’s castle, inhabited by people who had shut themselves in
with the undead, had by then been transformed into a prison of more than 200 ghouls. Because the
inhabitants had barred the gates and raised the drawbridge before succumbing, the knights could not
enter the castle to purify it. As a result, the fortress was declared “haunted.” For over a decade
afterward, peasants passing nearby could hear the moans of the zombies still within. According to
Kuntzel’s figures, 573 zombies were counted and more than 900 humans were devoured. In his writings,
Kuntzel also tells of massive reprisals against a nearby Jewish village, their lack of “faith” blamed for the
outbreak. Kuntzel’s work survived in the Vatican archives until its accidental discovery in 1973.
1073 A.D., JERUSALEM
The story of Dr. Ibrahim Obeidallah, one of the most important pioneers in the field of zombie
physiology, typifies the great strides forward and tragic steps back in science’s attempt to understand the
undead. An unknown source caused an outbreak of fifteen zombies in Jaffa, a city on the coast of
Palestine. Local militia, using a translated copy of Roman Army Order XXXVII, successfully
exterminated the threat with a minimum of human casualties. One newly bitten woman was taken under
the care of Obeidallah, a prominent physician and biologist. Although Army Order XXXVII called for
the immediate decapitation and burning of all bitten humans, Obeidallah convinced (or perhaps bribed)
the militia to allow him to study the dying woman. A compromise was reached in which he was permitted
to move the body, and all his equipment, to the city jail. There, in a cell, under the law’s watchful eye, he
observed the restrained victim until she expired—and continued to study the corpse while it reanimated.
He performed numerous experiments on the restrained ghoul. Discovering that all bodily functions
necessary to sustain life were no longer functioning, Obeidallah scientifically proved that his subject was
physically dead yet functioning. He traveled throughout the Middle East, gathering information on other

possible outbreaks.
Obeidallah’s research documented the entire physiology of the living dead. His notes included reports on
the nervous system, digestion, even the rate of decomposition in relation to the environment. This work
also included a complete study of the behavioral patterns of living dead, a remarkable achievement if
actually true. Ironically, when Christian knights stormed Jerusalem in 1099, this amazing man was
beheaded as a worshiper of Satan, and almost all of his work was destroyed. Sections of it survived in
Baghdad for the next several hundred years, with only a fraction of the original text rumored to survive.
Obeidallah’s life story, however, minus the details of his experiments, survived the crusaders’ slaughter,
along with his biographer (a Jewish historian and former colleague). The man escaped to Persia, where
the work was copied, published, and gained modest success in various Middle Eastern courts. A copy
remains in the National Archives in Tel Aviv.
1253 A.D., FISKURHOFN, GREENLAND
Following the great tradition of Nordic exploration, Gunnbjorn Lundergaart, an Icelandic chieftain,
established a colony at the mouth of an isolated fjord. There were reported to be 153 colonists in the
party. Lundergaart sailed back to Iceland after one winter, presumably to procure supplies and additional
colonists. After five years, Lundergaart returned to find the island compound in ruins. Of the colonists, he
found just three dozen skeletons, the flesh picked clean from the bones. It is also reported that he
encountered three beings, two women and one child. Their skin was a mottled gray, and bones stuck
through the flesh in places. Wounds were evident, but no traces of blood could be observed. Once
sighted, the figures turned and approached Lundergaart’s party. Without responding to any verbal
communication, they attacked the Vikings and were immediately chopped to pieces. The Norseman,
believing the entire expedition was cursed, ordered the burning of all bodies and artificial structures. As
his own family were among the skeletons, Lundergaart ordered his men to kill him as well, dismember his
body, and add it to the flames. The “Tale of Fiskurhofn,” told by Lundergaart’s party to traveling Irish
monks, survives in the national archives in Reykjavik, Iceland. Not only is this the most accurate account
of a zombie attack within ancient Nordic civilization, it may also explain why all Viking settlements within
Greenland mysteriously vanished during the early fourteenth century.
1281 A.D., CHINA
The Venetian explorer Marco Polo wrote in his journal that during one visit to the emperor’s summer
palace of Xanadu, Kublai Khan displayed a severed zombie head preserved in a jar of clear alcoholic
fluid (Polo described the fluid as “with the essence of wine but clear and biting to the nose”). This head,
the Khan stated, had been taken by his grandfather, Genghis, when he returned from his conquests in the
West. Polo wrote that the head was aware of their presence. It even watched them with nearly
decomposed eyes. When he reached out to touch it, the head snapped at his fingers. The Khan chastised
him for this foolish act, recounting the tale of a low-ranking court official who had tried the same thing and
had been bitten by the severed head. This official later “seemed to die within days but rose again to
attack his servants.” Polo states that the head remained “alive” throughout his stay in China. No one
knows the fate of this relic. When Polo returned from Asia, his story was suppressed by the Catholic
Church and therefore does not appear in the official publication of his adventures. Historians have
theorized that, since the Mongols reached as far as Baghdad, the head may be one of the original
subjects of Ibrahim Obeidallah, which would entitle the head to the record of the best-preserved, oldest
“living” relic of a zombie specimen.
1523 A.D., OAXACA, MEXICO
The natives tell of a sickness that darkens the soul, causing a thirst for the blood of their brothers. They

tell of men, women, even children whose flesh have become gray with rot and possess an unholy smell.
Once darkened, there is no method of healing, save death, and that can only be achieved through fire,
since the body becomes resistant to all arms of man. I believe this to be a tragedy of the heathen, for,
without their knowledge of Our Lord Jesus Christ, there was indeed no cure for this illness. Now that we
have blessed their masses with the light and truth of His love, we must strive to seek these darkened
souls, and cleanse them with all the force of Heaven.
This text was, supposedly, taken from the accounts of Father Esteban Negron, a Spanish priest and
student of Bartolome de las Casas, previously edited from the original works and recently discovered in
Santo Domingo. Opinions vary on the authenticity of this manuscript. Some believe it to be a part of a
Vatican order to suppress all information on the subject. Others believe it to be an elaborate hoax along
the lines of the “Hitler diaries.”
1554 A.D., SOUTH AMERICA
A Spanish expedition under the command of Don Rafael Cordoza penetrated the Amazon jungle in
search of the fabled El Dorado, the City of Gold. Tupi guides warned him not to enter an area known as
“The Valley of Endless Sleep.” In it, they cautioned, he would find a race of creatures who moaned like
wind and thirsted for blood. Many men had entered this valley, said the Tupi. None ever returned. Most
of the conquistadors were terrified by this warning and begged to return to the coast. Cordoza, believing
that the Tupi had fabricated this story in order to hide the golden city, pushed his expedition forward.
After dark, the camp was attacked by dozens of walking dead. What transpired that night is still a
mystery. The passenger manifest from theSan Varonica, the ship that carried Cordoza from South
America to Santo Domingo, has shown that he was the only survivor to reach the coast. Whether he
fought to the end or simply abandoned his men, no one knows. A year later, Cordoza reached Spain,
where he provided a full account of this attack to both the Royal Court in Madrid and the Holy Office in
Rome. Accused of squandering crown resources by the Royal Court, and of speaking blasphemous acts
by the Vatican, the conquistador was stripped of his title and died in obscure poverty. His story is a
compilation of fragments from many texts concerning this period in Spain’s history. No original work has
been discovered.
1579 A.D., THE CENTRAL PACIFIC
During his circumnavigation of the globe, Francis Drake, the pirate who later became a national hero,
stopped at an unnamed island to restock his supplies of food and fresh water. The natives warned him
not to visit a small, nearby cay that was inhabited by “the Gods of the Dead.” According to custom, the
deceased and terminally ill were placed on this island, where the gods would take them, body and soul,
to live on forever. Drake, fascinated by their story, decided to investigate. Observing from aboard ship,
he watched as a native shore party placed the body of a dying man on the island’s beach. After blowing
several calls from a conch shell, the natives retreated to the sea. Moments later, several figures staggered
slowly out of the jungle. Drake watched them feed on the corpse before slouching out of sight. To his
amazement, the half-eaten body rose to its feet and hobbled after them. Drake never spoke of this
incident during his life. The facts were discovered in a secret journal he kept hidden until his death. This
journal, passing from one personal collector to another, eventually found its way into the library of
Admiral Jackie Fischer, the father of the modern Royal Navy. In 1907 Fischer had it copied and gave it
to several of his friends as a Christmas gift. Along with exact coordinates, Drake proclaimed this
landmass “the Isle of the Damned.”
1583 A.D., SIBERIA

A scouting party for the infamous Cossack Yermak, lost and starving in the frozen wild, was sheltered by
an indigenous, Asiatic tribe. Once they had recovered their strength, the Europeans repaid the kindness
by declaring themselves the rulers of the village, and settled down for the winter until Yermak’s main
force arrived. After feasting for several weeks on the village’s stored food, the Cossacks now turned
their hunger upon the villagers themselves. In a savage act of cannibalism, thirteen people were eaten,
while the others fled into the wilderness. The Cossacks went through this new source of food within days.
In desperation, they turned to the village burial ground, where, it was believed, the freezing temperatures
had preserved any fresh corpses. The first body exhumed was a woman in her early twenties, who had
been buried with her hands and legs bound and her mouth gagged. Once defrosted, the dead woman
revived. The Cossacks were astounded. Hoping to learn how she had achieved such a feat, they
removed her gag. The woman bit one Cossack on the hand. With continued shortsightedness, ignorance,
and brutality, the Cossacks dismembered, roasted, and ate her flesh. Only two abstained: the wounded
warrior (it was believed by his comrades that food should not be wasted on the dying) and a deeply
superstitious man who believed the meat to be cursed. In a manner of speaking, he was right. All who ate
the zombie’s flesh died that night. The wounded man expired the next morning.
The one survivor attempted to burn the bodies. As he was preparing a funeral pyre, the bitten corpse
revived. With the new zombie in hot pursuit, the lone survivor took off across the steppe. Barely an hour
into the chase, the exposed zombie froze solid. The Cossack wandered for several days until he was
rescued by another scouting party from Yermak. His account was documented by a Russian historian,
Father Pietro Georgiavich Vatutin. The work remained obscure for several generations, housed in the
remote monastery on Valam Island on Lake Ladoga. It is only now being translated into English. Nothing
is known of the fate of the Asiatic villagers or even what their true identity is. The subsequent genocide
against these people by Yermak left few survivors. From a scientific point of view, this account
represents the first known occurrence of a zombie freezing solid.
1587 A.D., ROANOKE ISLAND, NORTH CAROLINA
English colonists, isolated from any support from Europe, sent regular hunting parties to the mainland in
search of food. One of these parties disappeared for three weeks. When a lone survivor returned, he
described an attack by “a band of savages . . . their putrid, worm-ridden skin impervious to powder and
shot!” Although only one of the eleven-man party was killed, four of the others were savagely mauled.
These men died the following day, were buried, then rose from their shallow graves within hours. The
survivor swore that the remainder of his party was eaten alive by his former comrades, and that he alone
escaped. The colony magistrate declared the man both a liar and a murderer. He was hanged the next
morning.
A second expedition was sent to recover the bodies “lest their remains be desecrated by heathens.” The
five-man party returned in a state of near collapse, bite and scratch marks covering their bodies. They
had been attacked on the mainland, both by the “savages” described by the now-vindicated, deceased
survivor, and also by members of the first hunting party. These new survivors, after a period of medical
examination, passed away within hours of each other. Burial was set for the following dawn. That night,
they reanimated. Details are sketchy as to the rest of the story. One version describes the eventual
infection and destruction of the entire town. Another has the Croatan Nation, recognizing the danger for
what it was, rounding up and burning every colonist on the island. In a third account, these same Native
Americans rescued the surviving townspeople and dispatched the undead and wounded. All three stories
have appeared in fictional accounts and historical texts for the last two centuries. None presents an
airtight explanation as to why the first English settlement in North America literally vanished without a
trace.
1611 A.D., EDO, JAPAN

Enrique Desilva, a Portuguese merchant doing business in the islands, wrote this passage in a letter to his
brother:
Father Mendoza, reacquainting himself with Castillian wine, spoke of a man who has recently converted
to our faith. This Savage was a member of one of the most secretive orders in this exotic, barbaric land,
“The Brotherhood of Life.” According to the old clergyman, this secret society trains assassins for, and I
speak in all sincerity, the purpose of executing demons. . . . These creatures, from his explanation, were
once human beings. After their death, some unseen evil caused them to arise . . . feasting upon the flesh
of the living. To combat this terror, “The Brotherhood of Life” has been formed, according to Mendoza,
by the Shogun himself. . . . They are taken from an early age . . . trained in the art of destruction. . . .
Their strange manner of unarmed battle devotes much time to avoiding manhandling by the demons,
wriggling as does a snake to avoid being seized. . . . Their weapons, oddly shaped Oriental scimitars, are
designed for the severing of heads. . . . Their temple, although its location remains the utmost secret, is
said to possess a room where the live and still-wailing heads of destroyed monsters adorn the walls.
Senior recruits, primed for their ascension into the brotherhood, must spend an entire night in this room,
with nothing but the unholy objects for company. . . . If Father Mendoza’s story is true, this land is, as we
have always suspected, one of godless evil. . . . Were it not for the lure of silk and spice, we would do
well to avoid it at all costs. . . . I asked the old priest where this new convert was, in order to hear the
words of this tale from his own lips. Mendoza informed me that he had been found murdered almost a
fortnight ago. “The Brotherhood” do not allow their secrets to be spilled, nor their members to renounce
their allegiance.
Many secret societies existed in feudal Japan. “The Brotherhood of Life” does not appear in any text,
past or present. Desilva does make some historical inaccuracies in his letter, such as referring to a
Japanese sword as a “scimitar.” (Most Europeans did not bother with learning any aspects of Japanese
culture.) His description of the wailing heads is also an inaccuracy as a severed zombie head could not
produce any noise without a diaphragm, lungs, and vocal cords. If his story is true, however, it would
explain why there have been few reported outbreaks in Japan as opposed to the rest of the world. Either
Japanese culture has produced an effective wall of silence surrounding its outbreaks or the Brotherhood
of Life accomplished its mission. Either way, there were no reports of outbreaks in connection with Japan
until the mid-twentieth century.
1690 A.D., THE SOUTHERN ATLANTIC
The Portuguese merchantman Marialva left Bissau, West Africa, with a cargo of slaves bound for Brazil.
It never reached its destination. Three years later, in the middle of the South Atlantic, the Danish vessel 
Zeebrug spotted the drifting Marialva. A boarding party was dispatched for the purpose of salvage.
They found, instead, a cargo hold of undead Africans still chained to their bunks, writhing and moaning.
There was no sign of the crew, and each of the zombies had at least one bite taken from its body. The
Danes, believing this ship to be cursed, rowed hastily back to their vessel and reported their findings to
the captain. He immediately sank the Marialva with cannon fire. Because there is no way of knowing
exactly how the infestation came aboard, all that is left to us is speculation. No lifeboats were found
aboard. Only the captain’s body was found, locked in his cabin, with a self-inflicted pistol wound to the
head. Many believe that, since the Africans were all chained, the initial infected person must have been a
member of the Portuguese crew. If this is true, the unfortunate slaves would have to have endured
watching their captors devour or infect one another after their slow transformation into living dead, the
virus having worked its way through their systems. Even worse is the awful likelihood that one of these

crewmembers attacked and infected a chained slave. This new ghoul, in turn, bit the chained, screaming
person next to him. On and on down the line, until the screams were eventually quiet and the entire hold
was filled with zombies. Imagining those at the end of the line, seeing their future creeping steadily closer,
was enough to conjure the worst nightmares.
1762 A.D., CASTRIES, ST. LUCIA, THE CARIBBEAN
The story of this outbreak is still told today, both by Caribbean islanders and Caribbean immigrants in the
United Kingdom. It serves as a powerful warning, not just of the power of the living dead but of
humanity’s frustrating inability to unite against them. An outbreak of indeterminate source began in the
poor white area of the small, overcrowded city of Castries on the island of St. Lucia. Several free black
and mulatto residents realized the source of the “illness” and attempted to warn the authorities. They were
ignored. The outbreak was diagnosed as a form of rabies. The first group of infected people were locked
in the town jail. Those who suffered bites while trying to restrain them were sent home without treatment.
Within forty-eight hours, all of Castries was in chaos. The local militia, not knowing how to stem the
onslaught, was overrun and consumed. The remaining whites fled the city to the outlying plantations.
Because many of them had already been bitten, they eventually spread the infection throughout the entire
island. By the tenth day, 50 percent of the white population was dead. Forty percent, more than several
hundred individuals, were prowling the island as reanimated zombies. The remainder had either escaped
by whatever seacraft they could find or remained holed up in the two fortresses at Vieux Fort and
Rodney Bay. This left a sizable force of black slaves who now found themselves “free” but at the mercy
of the undead.
Unlike the white inhabitants, the former slaves possessed a deep cultural understanding of their enemy, an
asset that replaced panic with determination. Slaves on every plantation organized themselves into tightly
disciplined hunting teams. Armed with torches and machetes (all firearms had been taken by the fleeing
whites) and allied with the remaining free blacks and mulattoes (St. Lucia contained small but prominent
communities of both), they swept the island from north to south. Communicating by drum, the teams
shared intelligence and coordinated battle tactics. In a slow, deliberate wave, they cleared St. Lucia in
seven days. Those whites still within the forts refused to join the struggle, as their racial bigotry matched
their cowardice. Ten days after the last zombie was dispatched, British and French colonial troops
arrived. Instantly, all former slaves were placed back in chains. Any resisters were hanged. As the
incident was recorded as a slave uprising, all free blacks and mulattoes were either enslaved or hanged
for aiding in the supposed rebellion. Although no written records were kept, an oral account was passed
down to the present day. A monument is rumored to exist somewhere on the island. No resident will
testify to its location. If one can take a positive lesson from Castries, it is that a group of civilians,
motivated and disciplined, with only the most primitive arms and basic communication, is a formidable
match for any zombie attack.
1807 A.D., PARIS, FRANCE
A man was admitted to Château Robinet, a “hospital” for the criminally insane. The official report filed by
Dr. Reynard Boise, chief administrator, states: “The patient appears incoherent, almost feral, with a
insatiable lust for violence. . . . With jaws that snap like a rabid dog, he successfully wounded one of the
other patients before being restrained.” The story that followed consists of the “wounded” inmate
receiving minor treatment (bandaging his wounds and a dose of rum), then being placed back in a
communal cell with more than fifty other men and women. What followed days later was an orgy of
violence. Guards and doctors, too frightened by the screams emanating from the cell, refused to enter
until a week had passed. By this time, all that remained were five infected, partially devoured zombies,
and the scattered parts of several dozen corpses. Boise promptly resigned his position and retired to
private life. Little is known of what happened to the walking dead, or the original zombie that was

brought to the institution. Napoleon Bonaparte himself ordered the hospital to be closed, “purified,” and
turned into a convalescent home for army veterans. Also, nothing is known of where the first zombie
came from, how he contracted the disease, or, in fact, if he had infected anyone else before being sent to
Château Robinet.
1824 A.D., SOUTHERN AFRICA
This excerpt was taken from the diary of H. F. Fynn, a member of the original British expedition to meet,
travel, and negotiate with the great Zulu king Shaka.
The kraal was abuzz with life. . . . The young nobleman stepped forward into the center of the cattle pen.
. . . Four of the king’s greatest warriors brought forth a figure, carried and restrained by the hands and
feet . . . a bag fashioned of royal cowhide covered his head. This same hide covered the hands and
forearms of his guards, so their flesh never touched that of the condemned. . . . The young nobleman
grabbed his assegai [four-foot stabbing spear] and leapt into the pen. . . . The King shouted his order,
commanding his warriors to hurl their charge into the kraal. The condemned struck the hard earth, flailing
about like a drunken man. The leather bag slipped from his head . . . his face, to my horror, was
frighteningly disfigured. A large knob of flesh had been gouged from his neck as if torn by some ungodly
beast. His eyes had been plucked out, the remaining chasms staring into hell. From neither wound flowed
the smallest drop of blood. The King raised his hand, silencing the frenzied multitude. A stillness hung
over the kraal; a stillness so complete, the birds themselves appeared to obey the mighty King’s order. . .
. The young nobleman raised his assegai to his chest and uttered a word. His voice was too meek, too
soft to reach my ears. The man, the poor devil, however, must have heard the solitary voice. His head
turned slowly, his mouth widened. From his bruised and torn lips came a howl so terrifying, it shook me
to my very bones. The monster, for now I was convinced it was a monster, slouched slowly towards the
nobleman. The young Zulu brandished his assegai. He stabbed forward, embedding the dark blade in the
monster’s chest. The demon did not fall, did not expire, did not hint that its heart had been pierced. It
simply continued its steady, unrelenting approach. The nobleman retreated, shaking like a leaf in the wind.
He stumbled and fell, earth sticking to his perspiration-covered body. The crowd kept their silence, a
thousand ebony statues staring down at the tragic scene. . . . And so Shaka leapt into the pen and
bellowed “Sondela! Sondela!” The monster immediately turned from the prone nobleman to the King.
With the speed of a musket ball, Shaka grabbed the assegai from the monster’s chest and drove it
through one of the vacant eye pouches. He then twirled the weapon like a fencing champion, spinning the
blade tip within the monster’s skull. The abomination dropped to its knees, then toppled forward, burying
its abhorrent face in the red soil of Africa.
The narrative abruptly ends here. Fynn never explained what happened to the doomed nobleman or the
slain zombie. Naturally, this rite of passage ceremony presents several burning questions: What is the
origin of the use of zombies in this way? Did the Zulus have more than one ghoul on hand for this
purpose? If so, by what means did they come by them?
1839 A.D., EAST AFRICA
The travel diary of Sir James Ashton-Hayes, one of the many incompetent Europeans seeking the source
of the Nile, reveals the probability of a zombie attack, and an organized, culturally accepted response to
it.

He came to the village early that morning, a young Negro with a wound in his arm. Obviously the little
savage had missed his spear shot and the intended dinner had kissed him goodbye. As humorous as this
was to behold, the events that followed struck me as utterly barbaric. . . . Both the village witch doctor
and the tribal chief examined the wound, heard the young man’s story, and nodded some unspoken
decision. The injured man, through tears, said goodbye to his wife and family . . . obviously in their
custom, physical contact is not permitted, then knelt at the feet of the chief. . . . The old man took hold of
a large, iron-tipped cudgel then brought it crashing down upon the doomed man’s head, stoving it in like
a giant black egg. Almost immediately, ten of the tribe’s warriors flung down their spears, unsheathed
their primitive cutlasses, and uttered a bizarre chant, “Nagamba ekwaga nah eereeah enge.” That said,
they simply headed out across the Savanna. The body of the unfortunate savage was then, to my horror,
dismembered and burned while the women of the tribe wailed to the pillar of smoke. When I asked our
guide for some sort of explanation, he merely shrugged his diminutive frame and responded, “Do you
want him to rise again, this night?” Queer sort of folk, these savages.
Hayes neglects to say exactly what tribe this was, and further study has revealed all his geographical data
to be woefully inaccurate. (Small wonder he never found the Nile.) Fortunately, the battle cry was later
identified as“Njamba egoaga na era enge,” a Gikuyu phrase meaning, “Together we fight, and
together we win or die.” This gives historians a clue that he was at least in what is today modern Kenya.
1848 A.D., OWL CREEK MOUNTAINS, WYOMING
Although this is probably not the first U.S. zombie attack, it is the first to be recorded. A group of
fifty-six pioneers, known as the Knudhansen Party, disappeared in the Central Rockies on their way to
California. One year later, a second expedition discovered the remains of a base camp believed to be
their last resting place.
Signs of a battle were obvious. All manner of broken gear lay strewn among charred wagons. We also
discovered the remains of at least five and forty souls. Among their many wounds, each shared a
common breakage of the skull. Some of these holes appeared to have been caused by bullets, others by
blunt instruments such as hammers or even rocks. . . . Our guide, an experienced man with many years in
these wilds, believed this not to be the work of wild Indians. After all, he argued, why would they have
murdered our people without taking both horse and oxen? We counted skeletons of all animals and
found him to be correct. . . . One other fact we found most distressing was the number of bite wounds
found on each of the deceased. As no animals, from the howling snow wolf to the tiny ant, touched the
carcasses, we ruled out their complicity in this matter. Stories of cannibalism were ever present on the
frontier, but we were horrified to believe such tales of godless savagery could be true, especially after
such horrific tales of the Donner Party. . . . What we could not fathom, however, was why they would
turn on each other so quickly when supplies of food had still not run out.
This passage came from Arne Svenson, a schoolteacher turned pioneer and farmer, of the second
expedition. This story in itself does not necessarily prove there was a Solanum outbreak. Solid evidence
would surface, but not for another forty years.
1852 A.D., CHIAPAS, MEXICO
A group of American treasure hunters from Boston, James Miller, Luke MacNamara, and Willard
Douglass, traveled to this remote jungle province for the purpose of pillaging rumored Mayan ruins.

While staying in the town of Tzinteel, they witnessed the burial of a man claimed to be “a drinker of
Satan’s blood.” They saw that the man was bound, gagged, and still alive. Believing this to be some sort
of barbaric execution, the North Americans succeeded in rescuing the condemned man. Once the chains
and gag were removed, the prisoner immediately attacked his liberators. Gunfire had no effect.
MacNamara was killed; the other two were lightly wounded. One month later, their families received a
letter dated the day after the attack. Within its pages, the two men related the details of their adventure,
including a sworn statement that their murdered friend had “come back to life” following the attack. They
also wrote that their superficial bite wounds were festering and that a horrible fever had set in. They
promised to rest for a few weeks in Mexico City for medical treatment, then return to the United States
as soon as possible. They were never heard from again.
1867 A.D., THE INDIAN OCEAN
An English mail steamer,RMS Rona, transporting 137 convicts to Australia, anchored off Bijourtier Island
to aid an unidentified ship that appeared stranded on a sandbar. The shore party discovered a zombie
whose back had been broken, dragging itself across the ship’s deserted decks. When they tried to offer
help, the zombie lurched forward and bit off one of the sailor’s fingers. While another seaman sliced the
zombie’s head off with his cutlass, the others took their injured comrade back to the ship. That night, the
wounded sailor was placed in his bunk and given a draught of rum and a promise by the ship’s surgeon
to check on him at dawn. That night, the fresh zombie reanimated and attacked his shipmates. The
captain, in a panic, ordered the cargo hold boarded up, sealing the convicts in with the ghoul, and
continued on course for Australia. For the rest of the voyage, the hold echoed with screams that melted
into moans. Several of the crew swore they could hear the agonizing squeaks of rats as they were eaten
alive.
After six weeks at sea, the ship anchored at Perth. The officers and crew rowed ashore to inform the
magistrate what had happened. Apparently, no one believed the stories of these sailors. A contingent of
regular troops were sent for, if for no other reason than to escort the prisoners off. RMS Rona remained
at anchor for five days, waiting for these troops to arrive. On the sixth day, a storm broke the ship’s
anchor chain, carried it several miles up the coastline, and smashed it against a reef. Townspeople, and
the ship’s former crew, found no evidence of the undead. All that remained were human bones and
tracks leading inland. The story of the Rona was common among sailors in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries. Admiralty records list the ship as lost at sea.
1882 A.D., PIEDMONT, OREGON
Evidence of the attack comes from a relief party, sent to investigate the small silver-mining town after two
months of isolation. This group found Piedmont in shambles. Many houses had been burned. Those still
standing were riddled with bullet holes. Strangely, these holes showed that all shots had been fired from
inside the houses, as if the battles had all taken place within their walls. Even more shocking was the
discovery of twenty-seven mangled and half-eaten skeletons. An early theory regarding cannibalism was
discarded when the town’s warehouses were found to contain enough food supplies for an entire winter.
When investigating the mine itself, the relief party made its final and most terrifying discovery. The entry
shaft had been blasted shut from the inside. Fifty-eight men, women, and children were found, all dead
from starvation. The rescuers determined that enough food to last several weeks had been stored and
eaten, suggesting that these people had been entombed for much longer than that. Once a thorough count
of all corpses, mangled and starved, had been made, at least thirty-two townsfolk could not be
accounted for.
The most widely accepted theory is that, for some reason, a ghoul or group of ghouls emerged from the
wilderness and attacked Piedmont. After a short, violent battle, the survivors carried what food they
could to the mine. After sealing themselves in, these people presumably waited for a rescue that never

came. It is suspected that, before the decision was made to retreat to the mine, one or more survivors
attempted to trek through the wilderness to the closest outpost for help. Since no record of this exists and
no bodies have ever been found, it is logical to assume that these proposed messengers either perished in
the wild or were consumed by the undead. If zombies did exist, their remains have never been recovered.
No official cover-up followed the Piedmont incident. Rumors ranged from plague, to avalanche, to
infighting, to attacks by “wild Indians” (no Native Americans lived in or anywhere near Piedmont). The
mine itself was never reopened. The Patterson Mining Company (owner of the mine and the town) paid
compensation of $20 to each relative of the residents of Piedmont in exchange for their silence. Evidence
of this transaction appeared in the company’s accounting logs. These were discovered when the
corporation declared bankruptcy in 1931. No subsequent investigation followed.
1888 A.D., HAYWARD, WASHINGTON
This passage describes the appearance of North America’s first professional zombie hunter. The incident
began when a fur trapper named Gabriel Allens stumbled into town with a deep gash on his arm. “Allens
spoke of a soul who wandered like a man possessed, his skin as gray as stone, his eyes fixed in a lifeless
stare. When Allens approached the wretch, he let out a hideous moan and bit the trapper on his right
forearm.” This passage comes from the journal of Jonathan Wilkes, the town doctor who treated Allens
after his attack. Little is known about how the infestation spread from this first victim to the other
members of the town. Fragments of data suggest the next victim was Dr. Wilkes, followed by three men
who attempted to restrain him. Six days after the initial attack, Hayward was a town under siege. Many
hid themselves in private homes or the town church while the zombies relentlessly attacked their
barricades. Although firearms were plentiful, no one recognized the need for a head shot. Food, water,
and ammunition were rapidly consumed. No one expected to hold longer than another six days.
At dawn on the seventh day, a Lakota man named Elija Black arrived. On horseback, with a U.S. Army
cavalry saber, he decapitated twelve ghouls within the first twenty minutes. Black then used a charred
stick to draw a circle around the town’s water tower before climbing to the top. Between yells, an old
army bugle, and his tethered horse for bait, he managed to attract every walking dead in town toward his
position. Each one that entered the circle received a head shot from his Winchester repeater. In this
careful, disciplined manner, Black eliminated the entire horde, fifty-nine zombies, in six hours. By the time
the survivors realized what had happened, their savior was gone. Later accounts have pieced together the
background of Elija Black. As a fifteen-year-old boy, he and his grandfather had been hunting when they
came upon the Knudhansen Party massacre. At least one member had been infected earlier and, once
turned, had attacked the rest of the group. Black and his grandfather destroyed the other zombies with
tomahawk strikes to the head, decapitation, and fire. One of the “survivors,” a thirty-year-old woman,
explained how the infestation spread and how over half of the now-reanimated party had wandered into
the wilderness. She then confessed that her wounds and those of the others were an incurable curse.
Unanimously, they begged for death.
After this mass mercy killing, the old Lakota revealed to his grandson that he had hidden a bite wound
suffered during the battle. Elija Black’s last kill of the day would be his own grandfather. From then on,
he devoted his life to hunting down the remaining zombies of the Knudhansen Party. With each
encounter, he grew in knowledge and experience. Although never reaching Piedmont, he had dispatched
nine of the town’s zombies that had wandered into the wilderness. By the time of Hayward, Black had
become, in all probability, the world’s leading field scholar, tracker, and executioner of the undead. Little
is known of the remainder of his life or how it eventually ended. In 1939, his biography was published
both in book form and a series of articles that appeared in English newspapers. As neither version has
survived, it is impossible to know exactly how many battles Black fought. A dedicated search is under
way to track down lost copies of his book.

1893 A.D., FORT LOUIS PHILIPPE, FRENCH NORTH AFRICA
The diary of a junior officer in the French Foreign Legion relates one of the most serious outbreaks in
history:
Three hours after dawn he came, a lone Arab on foot, on the brink of death from sun and thirst. . . . After
a day’s rest, with treatment and water, he related the story of a plague which turned its victims into
cannibalistic horrors. . . . Before our expedition to the village could be mounted, lookouts on the south
wall spotted what appeared to be a herd of animals on the horizon. . . . Through my glasses, I could see
they were not beasts but men, their flesh absent of color, their clothes worn and tattered. As the wind
shifted, it brought to us, first a withering groan, then not long afterward, the stench of human decay. . . .
We guessed these poor wretches to be on the heels of our survivor. How they managed to traverse such
a distance without food nor water, we could not say. . . . Calls and warnings produced no response. . . .
Bursts from our cannon did nothing to scatter them. . . . Long-range rifle shots seemed to have no effect!
. . . Corporal Strom was immediately dispatched on horseback to Bir-El-Ksaib while we shut the gates
and prepared for an attack.
The attack turned into the longest recorded undead siege. The legionnaires were unable to grasp the fact
their attackers were dead, wasting their ammunition on shots to the torso. Accidental head shots were
not enough to convince them of this successful tactic. Corporal Strom, the man sent for help, was never
heard from again. It is assumed that he met his fate from hostile Arabs or the desert itself. His comrades
inside the fort remained besieged for three years! Fortunately, a supply caravan had just arrived. Water
was already available from the well that prompted the building of the fort. Pack animals and horses were
eventually slaughtered and rationed as a last-ditch effort. All this time, the undead army, well over five
hundred, continued to surround the walls. The diary reports that, over time, many were brought down by
homemade explosives, improvised Molotov cocktails, and even large stones hurled over the parapet. It
was not enough, however, to break the siege. Incessant moaning drove several men insane and led two
of them to commit suicide. Several attempts were made to leap over the wall and run for safety. All who
tried were surrounded and mauled. An attempted mutiny further thinned their ranks, bringing the total
number of survivors to only twenty-seven. At this time, the unit’s commanding officer decided to try one
more desperate plan:
All men were equipped with a full supply of water and what little food remained. All ladders and
staircases leading up to the parapets were destroyed. . . . We assembled on the south wall and began to
call to our tormentors, gathering almost all right at our gates. Colonel Drax, with the courage of a man
possessed, was lowered into the parade ground, where he lifted the bolt himself. Suddenly, the stinking
multitude swarmed into our fortress. The colonel made sure he provided them with enough bait, leading
the wretches across the parade ground, through the barracks and mess hall, across the infirmary . . . he
was hoisted to safety just in time, a severed, rotting hand clasped tightly to his boot. We continued to call
to the creatures, booing and hissing, jumping about like wild monkeys, only now we were calling to those
creatures within our own fort! . . . Dorset and O’Toole were lowered to the north wall . . . they sprinted
to the gate and pulled it shut! . . . The creatures inside, in their mindless rage, did not think to simply pull
them open again! Pushing as they did against the inward opening gates, they only succeeded in trapping
themselves further!

The legionnaires then dropped to the desert floor, dispatched the few zombies outside the walls in vicious
hand-to-hand combat, then marched over 240 miles to the nearest oasis, at Bir Ounane. Army records
do not tell of this siege. No explanation is given why, when regular dispatches stopped arriving from Fort
Louis Philippe, no investigative forces were sent. The only official nod to anyone involved in the incident
is the court-martial and imprisonment of Colonel Drax. Transcripts of his trial, including the charges,
remain sealed. Rumors of the outbreak continued to populate the Legion, the Army, and French society
for decades. Many fictional accounts were written about “the Devil’s Siege.” Despite their denial of the
incident, the French Foreign Legion never sent another expedition to Fort Louis Philippe.
1901 A.D., LU SHAN, FORMOSA
According to Bill Wakowski, an American sailor serving with the Asiatic fleet, several peasants from Lu
Shan rose from their beds and proceeded to attack the village. Because of Lu Shan’s remoteness and
lack of wire communication (telephone/telegraph), word did not reach Taipei until seven days later.
These American missionaries, Pastor Alfred’s flock, they thought that it was God’s punishment on the
Chinamen for not taking in His word. They knew faith, and the Holy Father would chase the devil out of
them. Our skipper, he ordered them to stay put until he could muster an armed escort. Pastor Alfred
wouldn’t hear of it. While the old man wired for help, they headed up the river. . . . Our shore party and
a platoon of Nationalist Troops reached the village just about midday . . . bodies, or pieces of them,
were everywhere. The ground was all sticky. And the smell, God almighty, that smell! . . . When those
things came out of the mist, disgusting creatures, human devils. We plugged them at less than a hundred
yards. Nothing worked. Not our Krags, not our Gattling . . . Riley just kind of lost his marbles, I guess.
Fixed his bayonet and tried to skewer one of the beasties. About a dozen others swarmed around him.
Quick like lightning they tore my buddy limb from limb. They gnawed his flesh right down to the bone! It
was a grisly sight! . . . And here he comes, little bald witch doctor or monk, or whatever you call him . . .
swinging what looked like a flat shovel with a quarter moon blade on the back . . . must have been ten,
twenty corpses at his feet . . . he runs over, chattering all crazy, pointing to his head then theirs. The Old
Man, Lord knows how he reckoned what the Chinaman was babbling about, ordered us to aim for the
beasties’ heads. . . . We drilled them point blank. . . . Picking through the bodies, we discovered among
the Chinamen were a few white men, our missionaries. One of our guys found a monster whose spine
had been snapped by a round. It was still alive, flapping its arms, snapping its bloody teeth, letting out
that God Awful moan! The Old Man recognized it as Pastor Alfred. He said the Lord’s Prayer, then shot
the padre in the temple.
Wakowski sold his full account to the pulp magazine Tales of the Macabre, an act that resulted in his
immediate discharge and imprisonment. Upon release, Wakowski refused any further interviews. To this
day, the U.S. Navy denies the story.
1905 A.D., TABORA, TANGANYIKA, GERMAN EAST AFRICA
Trial transcripts state that a native guide referred to only as “Simon” was arrested and charged with the
decapitation of a famous white hunter, Karl Seekt. Simon’s defense counsel, a Dutch planter named Guy
Voorster, explained that his client believed he had actually committed a heroic act. According to
Voorster:
Simon’s people believe that a malady exists that robs the life force from a man. In its place is left the

body, dead yet still living, without sense of self or surroundings and with only cannibalism as its drive. . . .
Furthermore, the victims of this undead monster will rise from their own graves to devour even more
victims. This cycle will be repeated, again and again, until none is left upon our Earth but these horrible
flesh-eating monstrosities. . . . My client tells that the victim in question returned to his base camp two
days behind schedule, his mind delirious and an unexplained wound on his arm. Later that day he
expired. . . . My client then describes Herr Seekt rising from his deathbed to set his teeth upon the rest of
his party. My client used his native blade to decapitate Herr Seekt and incinerate his head in the
campfire.
Mr. Voorster quickly added that he was not in agreement with Simon’s testimony and submitted it only
to prove that the man was insane and should not be executed. As an insanity defense applied only to
white men and not Africans, Simon was sentenced to death by hanging. All records of the trial still exist,
albeit in terrible condition, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
1911 A.D., VITRE, LOUISIANA
This common American legend, told in bars and high school locker rooms throughout the Deep South,
has its roots in documented historical fact. On Halloween night, several Cajun youths took part in a
“dare” to stay in the bayou from midnight till dawn. Local custom told of zombies originally descended
from a plantation family that prowled the swamp, consuming or reanimating any humans who crossed
their path. By noon the next day, none of the teenagers had returned from their dare. A search party was
formed to comb the swamp. They were attacked by at least thirty ghouls, their ranks including the youths.
The searchers retreated, unwittingly leading the undead back to Vitre. While townsfolk barricaded
themselves in their homes, one citizen, Henri De La Croix, believed that dousing the undead with
molasses would bring millions of insects to devour their flesh. The scheme failed, and De La Croix barely
escaped with his life. The undead were doused again, this time with kerosene, and set ablaze. Without
realizing the full consequences of their actions, Vitre residents watched in horror as the burning ghouls set
fire to everything they touched. Several victims, trapped in barricaded buildings, burned to death while
the others fled into the swamp. Several days later, rescue volunteers counted a total of fifty-eight
survivors (the town’s previous population being 114). Vitre itself had completely burned to the ground.
Figures vary as to the number of undead versus human casualties. When Vitre casualties were added to
the amount of zombie corpses found, at least fifteen bodies are unaccounted for. Official government
records in Baton Rouge explain the attack as “riotous behavior from the Negro population,” a curious
explanation as the town of Vitre was entirely white. Any proof of a zombie outbreak comes from private
letters and diaries that exist among the survivors’ descendants.
1913 A.D., PARAMARIBO, SURINAM
While Dr. Ibrahim Obeidallah might have been the first to expand humanity’s scientific knowledge of the
undead, he was (thankfully) not the last. Dr. Jan Vanderhaven, already respected in Europe for his study
of leprosy, arrived in the South American colony to study a bizarre outbreak of this familiar disease.
The infected souls show symptoms similar to those around the globe: festering sores, mottled skin, flesh
decomposing in its appearance. However, all similarities with the conventional affliction end here. These
poor souls appear to have gone completely mad. . . . They display no signs of rational thought nor even
recognition of anything familiar. . . . They neither sleep nor take water. They reject all food except that
which is alive. . . . Yesterday a hospital orderly, for sheer sport, and against my orders, flung an injured
rat into the patients’ holding cell. One of them promptly grabbed the vermin and swallowed it whole. . . .

The infected display almost rabid hostility. . . . They snap at all who approach, teeth bared like animals. .

dubbed “Solanum.”
(“Contagious living fluid” was a common term before the later adoption of the Latin word virus. ) These
excerpts come from a 200-page, yearlong study done by Dr. Vanderhaven on this new discovery. In this
study, he documents a zombie’s tolerance to pain, apparent lack of respiration, slow rate of
decomposition, lack of speed, limited agility, and absence of healing. Because of the violent nature of his
subjects and the apparent fear of the hospital orderlies, Vanderhaven was never able to get close enough
to do a full autopsy. For this reason, he was unable to discover that the living dead were just that. In
1914, he returned to Holland and published his work. Ironically, it earned him neither praise nor ridicule
in the scientific community. His story, like many others of the day, was eclipsed by the outbreak of the
First World War. Copies of the work lay forgotten in Amsterdam. Vanderhaven returned to practicing
conventional medicine in the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), where he subsequently died of malaria.
Vanderhaven’s major breakthrough was the discovery of a virus as the culprit behind a zombie’s creation
and he was, notably, the first person to ascribe the name “Solanum” to the virus. Why he chose this term
is unknown. Although his work was not celebrated by his European contemporaries, it is now widely
read all over the world. Unfortunately, one country put the good doctor’s findings to devastating use.
(See “1942–45 A.D., Harbin.”)
1923 A.D., COLOMBO, CEYLON
This account comes from The Oriental, an expatriate newspaper for Britons living in the Indian Ocean
colony. Christopher Wells, a copilot for British Imperial Airways, was rescued from a life raft after
fourteen days at sea. Before dying of exposure, Wells explained that he had been transporting a corpse
discovered by a British expedition to Mount Everest. The corpse had been a European, his clothing of a
century earlier, with no identifying documents. As he was frozen solid, the expedition leader had decided
to fly him to Colombo for further study. While en route, the corpse thawed, reanimated, and attacked the
airplane’s crew. The three men managed to destroy their assailant by crushing his skull with a fire
extinguisher (as they did not realize what they were dealing with, the attempt may have been to simply
incapacitate the zombie). While safe from this immediate danger, they now had to contend with a
damaged aircraft. The pilot radioed a distress signal but had no time to send a position report. The three
men parachuted into the ocean, the crew-chief not realizing that a bite he sustained would have dire
consequences later. The following day, he expired, reanimated several hours later, and immediately
attacked the other two men. While the pilot wrestled with the undead assailant, Wells, in a panic, kicked
both of them overboard. After relating—some would say confessing—his story to the authorities, Wells
lapsed into unconsciousness and died the next day. His story was reported as the ravings of a sunstroke
maniac. A subsequent investigation produced no evidence of the plane, the crew, or the alleged zombie.
1942 A.D., THE CENTRAL PACIFIC
During Japan’s initial advance, a platoon of Imperial Marines was sent to garrison Atuk, an island in the
Caroline chain. Several days after landing, the platoon was attacked by a swarm of zombies from the
inland jungle. Initial casualties were high. Without any information about the nature of their attackers or

the correct means of destruction, the marines were driven to a fortified mountaintop on the north end of
the island. Ironically, as the wounded were left to die, the surviving marines spared themselves the danger
of taking infected comrades with them. The platoon remained stranded in their mountaintop fortress for
several days, lacking food, low on water, and cut off from the outside world. All this time, the ghouls
were besieging their position, unable to scale the steep cliffs but preventing any chance of escape. After
two weeks of imprisonment, Ashi Nakamura, the platoon sniper, discovered that a head shot was fatal to
a zombie. This knowledge allowed the Japanese to finally combat their attackers. After dispatching the
surrounding ghouls with rifle fire, they advanced into the jungle for a complete sweep of the island.
Eyewitness accounts have the commanding officer, Lieutenant Hiroshi Tomonaga, decapitating eleven
zombies with nothing but his officer’s Katana (an argument for the use of this weapon). A postwar
examination and comparison of records have shown that Atuk is in all probability the same island that Sir
Francis Drake described as “the Isle of the Damned.” Tomonaga’s own testimony, given to American
authorities after the war, states that once radio communication with Tokyo had been reestablished, the
Japanese High Command sent specific instructions to capture, not kill, any remaining zombies. Once this
was accomplished (four ghouls had been successfully bound and gagged), the Imperial Submarine I-58
was dispatched to retrieve the undead prisoners. Tomonaga confessed his lack of knowledge of what
happened to the four zombies. He and his men were ordered not to discuss their experience, under
penalty of death.
1942–45 A.D., HARBIN, JAPANESE PUPPET STATE OF MANCHUKUO (MANCHURIA)
In his 1951 book The Sun Rose on Hell, former U.S. Army Intelligence officer David Shore details a
series of wartime biological experiments conducted by a unit of the Japanese military known as “Black
Dragon.” One experiment, dubbed “Cherry Blossom,” was organized specifically for the breeding and
training of zombies into an army. According to Shore, when Japanese forces invaded the Dutch East
Indies in 1941–42, a copy of Jan Vanderhaven’s work was discovered in a medical library in Surabaya.
The work was sent to Black Dragon headquarters in Harbin for further study. Although a theoretical plan
was ordered, no sample of Solanum could be found (proof that the ancient zombie-killing “Brotherhood
of Life” had done its job too well). All this changed six months later with the incident on Atuk Island. The
four restrained zombies were delivered to Harbin. Experiments were performed on three of them, and
one was used specifically to breed other zombies. Shore states that Japanese “dissidents” (anyone who
disagreed with the military regime) were used as guinea pigs. Once a “platoon” of forty zombies had been
reanimated, Black Dragon operatives attempted to train them like obedient drones. This met with dismal
results: Bites turned ten of the sixteen instructors into zombies. After two years of fruitless attempts, the
decision was made to release the force of the now fifty zombies against the enemy no matter what
condition they were in. Ten ghouls were to be parachuted over British forces in Burma. The plane was hit
by antiaircraft fire before reaching its target, exploding into a fireball that destroyed all traces of its
undead cargo. A second attempt was made to deliver ten zombies by submarine to the American-held
Panama Canal zone (it was hoped that the ensuing chaos would interrupt Atlantic-built, Pacific-bound
American warships). The submarine was sunk en route. A third attempt was made (again by submarine)
to release twenty zombies into the ocean off the West Coast of the United States. Halfway across the
Northern Pacific, the submarine’s captain radioed that the zombies had broken free of their restraints and
were attacking the crew, and that he had no choice but to scuttle the boat. As the war drew to a close, a
fourth and final attempt was made to parachute the remaining zombies onto a nest of Chinese guerrillas in
Yonnan Province. Nine of the parachuted zombies were dispatched by head shots from Chinese snipers.
The sharpshooters did not realize the importance of their shots. Their orders had always been to go for
the head. The final zombie was captured, restrained, and taken to Mao Zedong’s personal headquarters
for further study. When the Soviet Union invaded Manchukuo in 1945, all records and evidence of the
“Cherry Blossom” project disappeared.
Shore states that his book is based on the eyewitness accounts of two Black Dragon operatives, men

whom he personally debriefed after they surrendered to the U.S. Army in South Korea at the end of the
war. At first Shore found a publisher for his book, a small, independent company known as Green
Brothers Press. Before it reached the shelves, the government ordered all copies confiscated. Green
Brothers Press was directly charged by Senator Joseph McCarthy with publishing “obscene and
subversive material.” Under the weight of legal fees, the company filed for bankruptcy. David Shore was
charged with violating national security and sentenced to life imprisonment at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
He was pardoned in 1961 but died of a heart attack two months after his release. His widow, Sara
Shore, retained a secret and illegal copy of his manuscript until her death in 1984. Their daughter,
Hannah, just recently won a lawsuit for the right to republish it.
1943 A.D., FRENCH NORTH AFRICA
This excerpt comes from the debriefing of P.F.C. Anthony Marno, tail-gunner on a U.S. Army B-24
bomber. Returning from a night raid against German troop concentrations in Italy, the aircraft found itself
lost over the Algerian desert. Low on fuel, the pilot saw what looked like a human settlement below and
ordered his crew to bail out. What they found was Fort Louis Philippe.
It looked like something out of a kiddie’s nightmare. . . . We open the gates, there wasn’t no bar on it or
nothing. We walk into the courtyard, and there was all these skeletons. Mountains of them, no kidding!
Just piled up everywhere, like a movie. Our skipper, he just kinda shakes his head and says, “Sorta feel
like there should be buried treasure here, you know?” Good thing none of them bodies was in the well.
We managed to fill up our canteens, grab some supplies. There wasn’t no food, but who’d want it
anyway, you know?
Marno and the rest of his crew were rescued by an Arab caravan fifty miles from the fort. When
questioned about the place, the Arabs would not respond. At the time, the U.S. Army had neither the
resources nor the interest in investigating some abandoned ruin in the middle of the desert. No later
expedition was ever mounted.
1947 A.D., JARVIE, BRITISH COLUMBIA
A series of articles in five separate newspapers recount the bloody events and individual heroism
associated with this small Canadian hamlet. Little is known of the source of the outbreak. Historians
suspect the carrier was Mathew Morgan, a local hunter who returned to town one night with a
mysterious bite on his shoulder. By dawn of the next morning, twenty-one zombies were prowling the
streets of Jarvie. Nine individuals were completely consumed. The remaining fifteen humans barricaded
themselves in the sheriff’s office. A lucky shot by an embattled citizen had proved what a bullet to the
brain could do. By this point, however, most of the windows were boarded up, so no one was able to
aim their weapons. A plan was hatched to crawl out to the roof, make it to the telephone-telegraph
office, and signal the authorities in Victoria. The survivors made it halfway across the street when the
nearby ghouls noticed them and gave chase. One member of the group, Regina Clark, told the others to
continue while she held off the undead. Clark, armed only with a U.S. M1 carbine, led the zombies into a
blind alley. Eyewitnesses insist that Clark did this on purpose, herding the undead into a confined space
to allow her no more than four targets at one time. With cool aim and an astounding reload time, Clark
dispatched the entire mob. Several eyewitnesses observed her emptying one fifteen-round clip in twelve
seconds without missing a single shot. Even more astounding is that the first zombie she dispatched was
her own husband. Official sources label the event “an unexplainable display of public violence.” All
newspaper articles are based on Jarvie’s citizens. Regina Clark declined to be interviewed. Her memoirs

remain a guarded secret of her family.
1954 A.D., THAN HOA, FRENCH INDOCHINA
This passage is taken from a letter written by Jean Beart Lacoutour, a French businessman living in the
former colony.
The game is called “Devil Dance.” A living human is placed in a cage with one of these creatures. Our
human has with him only a small blade, perhaps eight centimeters at most. . . . Will he survive his waltz
with the living corpse? If not, how long will it last? Bets are taken for these and all other variables. . . .
We keep a stable of them, these fetid gladiators. Most are turned from the victims of a failed match.
Some we take from the street . . . we pay their families well. . . . God have mercy on me for this
unimaginable sin.
This letter, along with a sizable fortune, arrived in La Rochelle, France, three months after the fall of
French Indochina to Ho Chi Minh’s Communist guerrillas. The fate of Lacoutour’s “Devil Dance” is
unknown. No further information has been uncovered. One year later, Lacoutour’s body arrived in
France, badly decomposed, with a bullet in the brain. The North Vietnamese coroner’s explanation was
suicide.
1957 A.D., MOMBASA, KENYA
This excerpt was taken from an interrogation by a British Army officer of a captured Gikuyu rebel during
the Mau Mau uprising (all answers come secondhand through a translator):
Q: How many did you see?
A: Five.
Q: Describe them.
A: White men, their skin gray and cracked. Some had wounds, bite marks on parts of their bodies. All
had bullet holes in their chests. They stumbled, they groaned. Their eyes had no sight. Their teeth were
stained with blood. The smell of carrion announced them. The animals fled.
An argument erupts between the prisoner and the Mosai interpreter. The prisoner grows silent.
Q: What happened?
A: They came for us. We drew our lalems (Mosai weapon, similar to a machete) and sliced off their
heads, then buried them.
Q: You buried the heads?
A: Yes.

Q: Why?
A: Because a fire would have given us away.
Q: You were not wounded?
A:I would not be here.
Q: You were not afraid?
A:We only fear the living.
Q: So these were evil spirits?
The prisoner chuckles.
Q: Why are you laughing?
A: Evil spirits are invented to frighten children. These men were walking death.
The prisoner gave little information for the rest of his interrogation. When asked if there were more
zombies out there, he remained silent. The entire transcript appeared in a British tabloid later that year.
Nothing was made of it.
1960 A.D., BYELGORANSK, SOVIET UNION
It had been suspected, since the end of the Second World War, that the Soviet troops who invaded
Manchuria captured most of the Japanese scientists, data, and test subjects (zombies) involved in Black
Dragon’s special project. Recent revelations have confirmed these rumors to be true. The purpose of this
new Soviet project was to create a secret army of walking dead to be used in the inevitable Third World
War. “Cherry Blossom,” rechristened “Sturgeon,” was conducted near a small town in Eastern Siberia
whose only other structure was a large prison for political dissidents. The location ensured not only total
secrecy but also a ready supply of test subjects. Based on recent findings, we are able to determine that,
for some reason, the experiments went awry, causing an outbreak of several hundred zombies. What few
scientists were left managed to escape to the prison. Safe behind its walls, they settled down for what
was believed to be a short siege until help arrived. None did. Some historians believe that the town’s
remote nature (no roads existed, and supplies had to be airlifted) prevented an immediate response.
Others believed that, since the project had been started by Josef Stalin, the KGB was reluctant to inform
Pre-mier Nikita Khrushchev of its existence. A third theory holds that the Soviet leadership was aware of
the disaster, had ringed the area with troops to prevent a breakout, and was watching and waiting to see
the result of the siege. Inside the prison walls, a coalition of scientists, military personnel, and prisoners
was surviving quite comfortably. Greenhouses were constructed; wells were dug; power was improvised
both by windmills and human dynamos. Radio contact was even maintained on a daily basis. The
survivors reported that, given their position, they could hold out until winter, when, hopefully, the undead
would freeze solid. Three days before the first autumn frost, a Soviet aircraft dropped a crude
thermonuclear device on Byelgoransk. The one-megaton blast obliterated the town, the prison, and the
surrounding area.

For decades, the disaster was explained by the Soviet government as a routine nuclear test. The truth
was not revealed until 1992, when information began leaking to the West. Rumors of the outbreak also
surfaced among older Siberians, interviewed for the first time by Russia’s newly free press. Memoirs of
senior Soviet officials hinted at the true nature of the devastation. Many acknowledge that the town of
Byelgoransk did exist. Others confirm that it was both a political prison and biowarfare center. Some
even go so far as to admit some kind of “outbreak,” although none describe exactly what broke out. The
most damaging evidence came when Artiom Zenoviev, a Russian mobster and former KGB archivist,
released all copies of the government’s official report to an anonymous Western source (an act for which
he was paid handsomely). The report contains radio transcripts, aerial photographs (both before and
after), and depositions of both ground troops and the bomber’s air crew, along with the signed
confessions of those in command of project Sturgeon. Included with this report are 643 pages of
laboratory data concerning the physiology and behavioral patterns of undead test subjects. The Russians
discount the entire disclosure as a hoax. If this is true, and Zenoviev is nothing more than a brilliantly
creative opportunist, then why does his list of those held responsible match official records of top
scientists, military commanders, and Politburo members who were executed by the KGB one month to
the day after Byelgoransk was incinerated?
1962 A.D., UNIDENTIFIED TOWN, NEVADA
Details of this outbreak are surprisingly sketchy, given that it occurred within a relatively settled part of
the planet within the latter half of the twentieth century. According to fragments of secondhand
eyewitness accounts, scraps of yellowed newsprint, and a suspiciously vague police report, a small
outbreak of zombies attacked and besieged Hank Davis, a local farmer, and three hired hands in a barn
for five days and nights. When state police dispatched the ghouls and entered the barn, they found all the
occupants dead. A subsequent investigation determined that the four men killed one another. More
specifically, three men were slain, while the fourth took his own life. No concrete reason is given for this
occurrence. The barn was more than safe from attack, and a small stock of food and water was only half
depleted. The present theory is that the zombie’s incessant moaning, coupled with feelings of total
isolation and helplessness, led to a complete psychological breakdown. No official explanation was given
for the outbreak. The case is “still under investigation.”
1968 A.D., EASTERN LAOS
This story was related by Peter Stavros, a substance-abuse patient and former Special Forces sniper. In
1989, while under psychological evaluation at a V.A. hospital in Los Angeles, he related this story to the
attending psychiatrist. Stavros stated that his team was on a routine search-and-destroy mission along the
Vietnamese border. Their intended target was a village suspected of being a staging area of the Pathet
Lao (Communist guerrillas). Upon entering the village, they discovered the inhabitants were in the midst
of their own siege against several dozen walking dead. For unknown reasons, the team leader ordered
his team to withdraw, then called in an air strike. Sky raiders armed with napalm plastered the area,
destroying both the living dead and the human survivors. No documented evidence exists to corroborate
Stavros’ story. The other members of his team are either dead, missing in action, missing within the
United States, or simply declined to be interviewed.
1971 A.D., NONG’ONA VALLEY, RWANDA
Jane Massey, wildlife journalist for The Living Earth, was sent by her magazine to document the lives of
endangered silverback gorillas. This excerpt ran as a small anecdote among the larger and more popular
story of rare and exotic primates:

As we passed a steep valley, I saw the movement of something in the foliage below. Our guide saw it too
and encouraged us to pick up the pace. At that moment I heard something pretty rare for that part of the
world: complete silence. No birds, no animals, not even insects, and we’re talking some pretty loud
insects. I asked Kengeri, and he just told me to keep it down. From down in the valley, I could hear this
creepy moan. Kevin [the expedition’s photographer] turned even whiter than usual and kept saying it
must be the wind. Now, I’ve heard wind in Sarawak, Sri Lanka, the Amazon, and even Nepal, and that
was NOT the wind! Kengeri put a hand on his machete and encouraged us to shut up. I told him I
wanted to go down into the valley to check it out. He refused. When I pushed, he said, “The dead walk
there” and took off.
Massey never explored the valley or discovered the source of the moan. The guide’s story could have
been local superstition. The moan could have simply been the wind. However, maps of the valley reveal it
to be surrounded by sheer cliffs in all directions, making it impossible for ghouls to escape. Theoretically,
this valley could serve as a receptacle for tribes wishing to trap but not destroy the walking dead.
1975 A.D., AL-MARQ, EGYPT
Information concerning this outbreak comes from a variety of sources: eyewitness interviews of the
town’s inhabitants, nine depositions from low-ranking Egyptian military personnel, and the accounts of
Gassim Farouk (a former Egyptian Air Force intelligence officer who recently emigrated to the United
States), and several international journalists who have requested that their identities be kept secret. All
these sources corroborate the story that an outbreak of unknown origin attacked and overran this small
Egyptian village. Calls for help went unanswered, both from police from other towns and the base
commander of Egypt’s Second Armored Division at Gabal Garib only thirty-five miles away. In a bizarre
twist of fate, the telephone operator at Gabal Garib was also an Israeli Mossad agent who passed the
information along to IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv. The information was discounted as a hoax by both the
Mossad and the Israeli General Staff and would have been forgotten had it not been for Colonel Jacob
Korsunsky, an aide to Prime Minister Golda Meir. An American Jew and former colleague of the late
David Shore, Korsunsky was well aware of the existence of zombies and what threat they posed if left
unchecked. Amazingly, Korsunsky convinced Meir to assemble a reconnaissance mission to investigate
Al-Marq. By now the infestation was in its fourteenth day. Nine survivors had barricaded themselves in
the town mosque with little water and no food. A platoon of paratroopers, led by Korsunsky, dropped
into the center of Al-Marq and, after a twelve-hour battle, eliminated all zombies. Wild speculation
surrounds the ending of this story. Some believe that the Egyptian Army surrounded Al-Marq, captured
the Israelis, and prepared to execute them on the spot. Only after pleading from the survivors, who
showed the soldiers the zombie corpses, did the Egyptians allow the Israelis safe passage home. Others
take this possibility further, believing it to be one of the reasons for the Egyptian-Israeli détente. No hard
evidence exists to substantiate this story. Korsunsky died in 1991. His memoirs, personal accounts, army
communiqués, subsequent newspaper articles, and even film of the battle purportedly shot by a Mossad
cameraman, have been sealed by the Israeli government. If the story is true, it does present one
interesting and possibly disturbing question. Why would the Egyptian Army be convinced of the living
dead’s existence simply by eyewitness accounts and seemingly human corpses? Would not an intact,
still-functioning specimen (or specimens) have to exist to prove such an incredible story? If so, where are
those specimens now?
1979 A.D., SPERRY, ALABAMA
While on his daily rounds, Chuck Bernard, the local postal delivery man, stopped at the Henrichs farm to
find that the previous day’s mail had not been collected. As this had never happened before, Bernard

decided to carry the mail himself up to the house. Fifty feet from the front door, he heard what sounded
like gunshots, cries of pain, and calls for help. Bernard fled the scene, drove ten miles to the nearest pay
phone, and called the police. When two sheriff’s deputies and a paramedic team arrived, they found the
Henrichs family brutally slaughtered. The only survivor, Freda Henrichs, was obviously experiencing the
symptoms of advanced infection. She bit both paramedics before the deputies could restrain her. A third
deputy, last to arrive and new to the force, panicked and shot her in the head. The two bitten men were
brought to the county hospital for treatment and died soon afterward. Three hours later, they rose during
their autopsy, attacked the coroner and his assistant, and moved out to the street. By midnight the entire
town was in a panic. At least twenty-two zombies were now at large and had completely devoured
fifteen people. Many survivors sought refuge in their homes. Others tried to flee the city. Three
schoolchildren managed to climb to the top of a water tower. Although surrounded (several ghouls tried
to scale the tower but were kicked back to the ground), these children remained safe until they were
rescued. One man, Harland Lee, left his home armed with a modified Uzi submachine gun, a sawed-off,
double-barreled shotgun, and two .44 magnum pistols (one a revolver, the other an automatic).
Witnesses reported seeing Lee attack a group of twelve zombies, firing first his Uzi then the other
weapons in turn. Each time, Lee aimed for the zombie’s torso, causing extreme damage but no kills. Low
on ammo, and backed against a mass of wrecked cars, Lee attempted head shots with a pistol in each
hand. Because his hands were shaking too violently, Lee produced no hits whatsoever. The
self-appointed town savior was quickly devoured. By morning, deputies from neighboring towns, along
with state police and hastily assembled vigilante groups, had converged on Sperry. Armed with sighted
hunting rifles and new knowledge of the fatal head shot (a local hunter had learned this defending his
home), they quickly dispatched the threat. The official explanation (provided by the Department of
Agriculture) was “mass hysteria from pesticide release in local water table.” All bodies were removed by
the Centers for Disease Control before civilian autopsies could be performed. The majority of radio
recordings, news footage, and private photographs was immediately confiscated. One hundred and
seventy-five lawsuits were filed by various survivors. Ninety-two of these cases have been settled out of
court, forty-eight are still pending, and the remainder have been mysteriously dropped. One lawsuit was
recently filed for access to the confiscated media footage. A court decision is said to be years away.
OCT. 1980 A.D., MARICELA, BRAZIL
News of this outbreak initially came from Green Mother, an environmental group seeking to draw
attention to the plight of local Indians suffering the seizure and destruction of their land. Cattle ranchers,
seeking to achieve their aims through violence, armed themselves and set out for the Indian village. While
deep in the rainforest, they were attacked by another, more terrifying enemy: a horde of more than thirty
zombies. All ranchers were either devoured or reanimated as walking dead. Two survivors managed to
make it to the nearby town of Santerem. Their warnings were ignored, and official reports explained the
battle as an uprising by the Indian population. Three army brigades advanced on Maricela. After finding
no trace of the undead, they moved into the Indian village. The incident that followed has been officially
denied by the Brazilian government, as has any knowledge of an attack by walking dead. Eyewitness
accounts have described the massacre as exactly that, with government troops destroying every walking
being, zombie and human. Ironically, members of Green Mother deny the story as well, stating that it
actually was the Brazilian government that fabricated a zombie hoax as justification for massacring the
Indians. One piece of interesting evidence comes from a retired major in the Brazilian Army’s Bureau of
Ordnance. He recounts that, in the days leading up to the battle, nearly every flamethrower in the country
was requisitioned. After the operation, the weapons were returned empty.
DEC. 1980 A.D., JURUTI, BRAZIL
This outpost, more than 300 miles downriver from Maricela, became the scene of several attacks five
weeks later. Zombies rising from the water attacked fishermen in their boats or clambered ashore at

several points along the bank. The result of these attacks—numbers, response, casualties—is still
unknown.
1984 A.D., CABRIO, ARIZONA
This outbreak, extremely minor considering the space and people involved, barely qualifies as a Class 1.
However, the ramifications represent one of the most significant events in the study of Solanum. A fire at
an elementary school caused the deaths of forty-seven children, all by smoke inhalation. The only
survivor, Ellen Aims, nine years old, escaped by jumping out of a broken window but suffered deep
lacerations and loss of blood. Only a hurried transfusion from stored blood saved her life. Within half an
hour, Ellen began to suffer the symptoms of a Solanum infection. This was not understood by the medical
staff, who suspected the blood to be contaminated by other diseases. While tests were under way, the
child died. In full view of the staff, witnesses, and parents, she reanimated and bit the attending nurse.
Ellen was restrained, the nurse was put in quarantine, and the doctor on call relayed the details of his case
to a colleague in Phoenix. Two hours later, doctors from the Centers for Disease Control arrived,
escorted by local law enforcement and “nondescript federal agents.” Ellen and the infected nurse were
airlifted to an undisclosed location for “further treatment.” All hospital records as well as the entire blood
supply were confiscated. The Aims family was not allowed to accompany their child. After an entire
week without news, they were informed that their daughter had “passed away” and the body had been
cremated for “health reasons.” This case is the first on record to prove that Solanum is transferable from
stored blood. This begs the questions: Who was the donor of the infected blood, how was it taken
without the subject knowing he was infected, and why was the infected donor never heard from again?
Furthermore, how did the CDC hear of the Aims case so quickly (the physician in Phoenix declined to be
interviewed), and why did the agency respond so quickly? Needless to say, conspiracy theories continue
to orbit this case. Ellen’s parents have filed a lawsuit against the CDC, for the sole purpose of having the
truth revealed. Their statements were instrumental in the author’s research of this case.
1987 A.D., KHOTAN, CHINA
In March 1987, Chinese dissident groups informed the West of a near disaster at the nuclear power plant
in Xinjiang. After several months of denying the story, the Chinese government officially announced that
there had been a “malfunction” at the facility. Within a month, the story had been changed to “attempted
acts of sabotage . . . by counter-revolutionary terrorists.” In August, Tycka!, a Swedish newspaper,
published a story that a U.S. spy satellite over Khotan had photographed tanks and other armored
vehicles firing point-blank into what appeared to be disorganized mobs of civilians who were attempting
to enter the power plant. More photographs revealed that some of the “civilians” surrounding certain
individuals were tearing them to pieces and feeding on their corpses. The U.S. government denies that its
satellite produced such images, andTycka! has retracted the story. If Khotan were a zombie outbreak,
then more questions exist than answers. How did the outbreak start? What was the duration? How was it
eventually contained? How many zombies were involved? Did they actually enter the plant? How much
damage was done? Why was there not a meltdown on the scale of Chernobyl? Did any zombies escape?
Have there been attacks since then? One piece of information that gives credence to the story of the
outbreak comes from Professor Kwang Zhou, a Chinese dissident who has since defected to the United
States. Kwang knew one soldier involved in the incident. Before being sent to a reeducation camp with
all other witnesses, the young man stated that the code name for the operation was “Eternal Waking
Nightmare.” One question still remains, how did this initial outbreak start? After reading David Shore’s
book, specifically the section on how a Black Dragon zombie was captured by Chinese Communist
troops, it is logical to theorize that the Chinese government had, or still has, its own version of “Cherry
Blossom” and “Sturgeon,” its own project to create an army of undead.
DEC. 1992 A.D., JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL MONUMENT, CALIFORNIA

Several hikers and day-trippers to this desert park reported an abandoned tent and gear just off the main
road. Park rangers investigating the reports discovered a gruesome scene a mile and a half from the
abandoned camp sight. A woman in her mid-twenties was found dead, her head caved in by a large rock
and her body covered with human bite marks. A further investigation by the local and state police
identified the victim as Sharon Parsons from Oxnard, California. She and her boyfriend, Patrick
MacDonald, had been camping in the park the previous week. An all points bulletin was immediately put
out on MacDonald. A full autopsy of Parsons revealed a fact that startled the attending coroner. Her
body’s rate of decomposition did not match that of her brain tissue. Furthermore, her esophagus
contained traces of human flesh that matched MacDonald’s recorded blood type. However, skin
samples from under her nails matched a third party, Devin Martin, a loner and wildlife photographer who
had bicycled through the park a month earlier. As he had few friends, no family, and worked freelance,
Martin’s disappearance was never filed. A full search of the park revealed nothing. A surveillance video
from a gas station in Diamond Bar revealed that MacDonald had stopped there briefly. The clerk on duty
described MacDonald as haggard, frenzied, and holding a bloody cloth over his shoulder. MacDonald
was last seen heading west, toward Los Angeles.
 
An investigation is still underway regarding the earliest phase of this outbreak, including how it initially
spread to the immediate area. The outbreak was first detected by a group of youths, members of a street
gang known as the V.B.R., or Venice Boardwalk Reds. Their reason for entering this area of the city
was to avenge the death of one of their members, murdered by a rival gang known as Los Peros Negros.
Around one A.M., they entered a post-industrial, nearly abandoned area where the Peros had their
hangout. The first thing they noticed was the lack of homeless people. That area was known for its large
shantytown in a local vacant lot. The cardboard boxes, shopping carts, and other various paraphernalia
that belonged to these vagrants lay strewn around the street, but there was no sign of the people. Paying
little attention to the road, the driver of the Reds’ vehicle accidentally ran over a slow-moving pedestrian.
The driver lost control of his El Camino and spun into the side of a building. Before the Reds could repair
their damaged vehicle or fully berate their companion for his lack of driving skill, they saw the injured
pedestrian move. Despite a broken back, the victim began crawling toward the street gang. One of the
Reds raised his 9mm pistol and shot the man through the chest. Not only did this act fail to stop the
crawling man, but it sent a soundwave echoing across a several-block radius. The Red fired several more
shots, all striking his target, all producing zero results. His last shot entered the figure’s skull, ending its
life. The Reds never had time to discover exactly what they had killed. Suddenly they heard a moan that
seemed to come from all directions. What they had taken for shadows in streetlights was a crowd of
more than forty zombies approaching from all directions.
With their car wrecked, the Reds took off down the street, literally running through the thinnest line of
living dead. After several blocks they encountered, ironically, the remaining members of Los Peros
Negros, also on foot after their hangout and vehicles had been overrun by the living dead. Forsaking
rivalry for survival, the two gangs called a truce and set out in search of either a means of escape or a
safe refuge. Although most of the buildings—well-built, windowless warehouses—would have made
excellent fortresses, they were either locked or (in the case of the abandoned ones) boarded up and
could not be entered. As they knew the turf better, the Peros took the lead and suggested De Soto
Junior High, a small school easily within running distance. With the living dead barely minutes away, the
two gangs made it to the school and broke in through a second-story window. This set off a burglar
alarm which, in turn, alerted every zombie in the immediate area, swelling their ranks to more than a
hundred. The alarm, however, was the only negative aspect of this formidable redoubt. In terms of a
fortress, De Soto was an excellent choice. Solid concrete construction, barred and mesh-covered
windows and steel-covered, solid wood doors made the two-story building easily defensible. Once
inside, the group acted with commendable forethought, establishing a secondary fallback, checking all

doors and windows for security, filling any receptacles they could with water, and taking stock of their
own personal weapons and ammunition. As they believed the police to be a worse enemy than the living
dead, both gangs used the phone to call allied street gangs instead of the authorities. None of those
contacted believed what they were hearing, but promised to arrive as soon as possible anyway.
This last act was, in another ironic twist, one of the few cases of overkill ever recorded in an undead
uprising. Well-protected, well-armed, well-led, well-organized, and extremely well-motivated, the gang
members were able to dispatch the living dead from the upstairs windows without losing any of their own.
Reinforcements (allied street gangs promising their support) did show up, unfortunately at the same time
as the L.A.P.D. The result was the arrest of all those involved.
The incident was officially explained as “a shoot-out between local street gangs.” Both Reds and Peros
tried to relay the truth to anyone who would listen. Their story was explained as a delusion brought on by
“Ice,” a narcotic popular at that time. As the police and reinforcement gang members had only seen shot
corpses and no walking zombies, none could be counted on as actual eyewitnesses. The bodies of the
undead were removed and cremated. As almost all of them had been homeless people, none could be
identified and none were missed. The original gang members involved were each found guilty of
first-degree murder and sentenced to life at one of several of California’s state prisons. All were
murdered within a year of their incarceration, supposedly by rival gang members. This story would have
ended there had it not been for an L.A.P.D. detective who has asked to remain nameless. He/she had
read about the Parsons-MacDonald case several days before and was intrigued by its bizarre details.
This allowed him/her to partially believe the gang members’ stories. The coroner’s report gave the most
compelling argument. It perfectly matched Parsons’ autopsy. The final nail in the coffin was a wallet found
on one of the undead, a man in his early thirties who appeared to be better dressed and groomed than
the average street vagrant. The wallet belonged to Patrick MacDonald. As the owner had been shot in
the face with a twelve-gauge solid slug, there was no way to positively identify him. The anonymous
detective knew better than to bring the matter to his/her superiors for fear of disciplinary action. Instead,
he/she copied the entire case file and presented it to the author of this book.
FEB. 1993 A.D., EAST LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA
At one forty-five A.M. Octavio and Rosa Melgar, the owners of a local carnecería, were awoken by
frantic cries beneath their second-story bedroom window. Fearing that their store was being looted,
Octavio grabbed his pistol and raced downstairs while Rosa telephoned the police. Crumpled near an
open manhole was a quivering, sobbing man, covered in mud, dressed in tattered Department of
Sanitation coveralls and bleeding profusely from the mangled stump where his right foot had once been.
The man, who never identified himself, shouted repeatedly for Octavio to cover the manhole. Not
knowing what else do, Octavio obliged. Before the metal cover slid into position, Octavio thought he
heard a sound like distant moaning. As Rosa tied off the wounded man’s leg, he half-whimpered,
half-yelled that he and five other sanitation workers were inspecting a storm drain junction when they
were attacked by a large group of “crazies.” He described his assailants as being covered in a variety of
rags and wounds, groaning rather than speaking, and approaching at a methodical limp. The man’s words
trailed off into an unintelligible string of phrases, grunts, and sobs before he slipped into unconsciousness.
The police and paramedics arrived ninety minutes later. By this time, the wounded man was pronounced
dead. As his body was driven away, the L.A.P.D. officers took statements from the Melgars. Octavio
mentioned that he had heard the moaning. The officers noted this but said nothing. Six hours later, the
Melgars heard on the morning news that the ambulance carrying the dead man had crashed and exploded
on its way to the county hospital. The radio call from the paramedics (how the news station was able to
obtain it is still a mystery) consisted mainly of panicked screams about the deceased subject tearing out
of his body bag. Forty minutes after the broadcast, four police trucks, an ambulance, and a national
guard truck pulled up in front of the Melgar’s carnicería. Octavio and Rosa watched as the area was

sealed off by the L.A.P.D. and a large, olive drab green tent was erected over the manhole with an
identical passage running from it to the truck. The Melgars, along with a small crowd of onlookers, heard
the unmistakable echo of gunfire from the manhole. Within the hour, the tent was struck, the barricade
was lifted, and the vehicles quickly departed. There is little doubt that this incident was an aftershock of
the downtown Los Angeles attack. Details of the government response, exactly what transpired in that
underground labyrinth, may never be known. The Melgars, citing “personal legal reasons,” have not
made any further inquiries. The L.A.P.D. has explained the incident as a “routine health and maintenance
inspection.” The Los Angeles Department of Sanitation has denied the loss of any of its employees.
MAR. 1994 A.D., SAN PEDRO, CALIFORNIA
If not for Allie Goodwin, a crane operator at this Southern California shipyard, and her
twenty-four-frame disposable camera, the world might have never known the true story of this zombie
outbreak. An unmarked container was offloaded from the S.S.Mare Caribe, a Panamanian-flagged
freighter out of Davao City, the Philippines. For several days it remained in the dockyard, awaiting
pickup. One night, a watchman heard sounds emanating from the container. He and several security
guards, suspecting it to be crowded with illegal immigrants, immediately opened the container. Forty-six
zombies streamed out. Those in close proximity were devoured. Others sought shelter in warehouses,
office buildings, and other facilities. Some of these structures provided adequate shelter; others became
deathtraps. Four intrepid crane workers, Goodwin among them, climbed into their machines and used
them to create an ad-hoc fortress of containers. This prefabricated shelter kept thirteen workers
protected for the remainder of the night. The crane operators then used their machines as weapons,
dropping containers on any zombie within range. By the time the police arrived (entry to the facility was
barred by several locked gates), only eleven zombies remained at large. These were put down by a
barrage of gunfire (including some lucky head shots). Total human casualties have been estimated at
twenty. Zombie dead numbered thirty-nine. The seven unaccounted for are believed to have fallen into
the water and been taken out to sea by the current.
All news stories filed claimed the incident was an attempted break-in. No government statements, on any
level, were made. Dockyard management, the San Pedro Police—even the private security company that
lost eight of its guards—have remained silent. TheMare Caribe ’s crew, her captain, and even the
company itself deny any knowledge of the original container, which has also mysteriously vanished. The
port itself coincidentally caught fire the day after the attack. What makes this cover-up so incredible is
that San Pedro is a large, busy port situated in one of the most heavily populated areas in the United
States. How the government was able to suppress almost all sources of information is truly astounding.
Goodwin’s photos and statement have been branded a hoax by all parties involved. She was dismissed
from her job on the grounds of psychological incompetence.
APR. 1994 A.D., SANTA MONICA BAY, CALIFORNIA
Three Palos Verdes residents, Jim Hwang, Anthony Cho, and Michael Kim, reported to police that they
were attacked while fishing in the bay. The three men swore that Hwang had been bottom fishing when
his line hooked a large, extremely heavy catch. What broke the surface was a man, naked, partially
burned, partially decomposed, and still alive. The man attacked the three fishermen, grabbing Hwang and
attempting to bite him on the neck. Cho pulled his friend back and Kim smashed the creature in the face
with an oar. The attacker sank beneath the surface while the three fishermen headed for shore. All three
were immediately subject to drug and alcohol tests by the Palos Verdes Police Department (tests that
revealed no traces of either), held overnight for questioning, and released the next morning. The case is
still officially “under investigation.” Given the time and place of the attack, it is logical to assume that the
creature was one of the original San Pedro outbreak zombies.
1996 A.D., THE LINE OF CONTROL, SRINAGAR, INDIA

This excerpt was taken from a post action report by Lieutenant Tagore of the Border Security Force:
The subject approached at a slow stagger, as if ill or intoxicated. [Through binoculars] I could observe
that he wore the full uniform of the Pakistan Rangers, odd since none were reported to be operating in
this zone. At three hundred meters we ordered the subject to halt and identify himself. He would not
comply. A second warning was given. Still no reply. He seemed to be moaning incoherently. At the
sound of our calls his pace increased slightly. At two hundred meters he tripped the first mine, an
American “Bouncing Betty.” We observed the subject receiving shrapnel wounds to his upper and lower
torso. He stumbled, fell on his face, then regained his footing and continued forward. . . . I deduced he
wore some type of body armor. . . . This action occurred again at one hundred and fifty meters. This time
the shrapnel tore the subject’s jaw from his face. . . . At this range I could observe that the wound did
not bleed. . . . The wind shifted in our direction. . . . We detected a putrid odor from the subject similar
to decomposing meat. At one hundred meters I ordered Private Tilak [platoon sniper] to dispatch the
subject. Tilak placed a direct shot through the subject’s forehead. The subject dropped immediately. He
did not rise, nor make any further movement.
Subsequent reports document the recovery and initial autopsy of the body at the military hospital in
Srinagar. Shortly thereafter the body was removed by the National Security Guard. No subsequent
information has been released regarding their findings.
1998 A.D., ZABROVST, SIBERIA
Jacob Tailor, an acclaimed documentary filmmaker for the Canadian Broadcast Company, arrived in the
small Siberian town of Zabrovst with the intention of photographing an intact, and potentially cloneable,
saber-toothed tiger carcass. The body of a man in his late twenties, whose clothing matched that of a
sixteenth-century cossack, had also been found. The shoot was due to take place in July, but Tailor
arrived with an advance team in February to familiarize himself with the area and his subjects. Tailor
believed the human corpse would not be the subject of more than a few seconds in his film, but asked
that it be stored with the tiger’s until his return. Tailor and his crew then returned to Toronto for a much
needed rest. On June 14 a few members of Tailor’s crew returned to Zabrovst to prepare their frozen
subjects and the dig site for filming. That was the last time they were heard from.
When Tailor arrived by helicopter with the rest of his film crew on July 1 he found all twelve buildings at
the site deserted. There were signs of violence and forced entry, including broken windows, overturned
furniture, and blood and pieces of flesh on the walls and floor. A scream brought Tailor back to the
helicopter, where he found a group of thirty-six ghouls, including local villagers and the missing members
of his advance team, feasting on the pilots. Tailor did not understand what he was seeing, but knew
enough to run for his life.
The situation seemed grim. Tailor and his cameraman, soundman, and field researcher had no weapons,
no supplies, and, being in the middle of the Siberian wasteland, nowhere to turn for help. The filmmakers
sought refuge in a two-story farmhouse in the village. Instead of boarding up the doors and windows,
Tailor decided to destroy the two staircases. They stocked the second story with whatever food they
could find and buckets of water filled from the well. An ax, a sledgehammer, and several smaller tools
were used to destroy the first staircase. The arrival of the zombies prevented the destruction of the
second one. Tailor acted quickly, taking doors from the second-story bedrooms and nailing them onto
the second stairway. This created a ramp that prevented the approaching zombies from gaining any

traction. One by one they attempted to crawl their way up the ramp and were pushed back down by
Tailor’s team. This low-intensity battle went on for two days; half the group kept their attackers at bay
while the other half slept (with cotton stuffed into their ears to deaden the sound of the moans).
On the third day, a freak accident gave Tailor the idea for their eventual salvation. For fear the ghouls
would grab their legs if they attempted to kick them back down the ramp, the filmmakers had resorted to
shoving the zombies down with a long-handled wooden broom. The broom handle, already weak from
so much use, finally snapped as it was grabbed by one of the attacking fiends. Tailor managed to kick the
zombie back down, and watched in amazement as the sharp, broken tip of the handle, still clutched in the
falling monster’s hand, went right through the eye socket of a fellow ghoul. Not only had Tailor
unwittingly killed his first zombie, but for the first time he realized the proper way to dispose of them.
Now, instead of trying to force their attackers back down the ramp, the film crew aggressively
encouraged them. Each one that came close enough to attack was given a devastating blow to the head
with the team’s ax. When this weapon was lost (stuck in the skull of a dead zombie), they switched to
their sledgehammer. When its handle broke, they resorted to a crowbar. The battle took seven hours, but
by the end the exhausted Canadian filmmakers had dispatched every one of their attackers.
To this day, the Russian government has no official explanation of what occurred at Zabrovst. Any official
asked about the incident will explain that it is being “looked into.” However, in a country with as many
social, economic, political, environmental, and military problems as the new Russian Federation, there is
little interest in the deaths of a few foreigners and backwoods Siberians.
Tailor, amazingly, kept his two cameras rolling throughout the entire incident. The result is forty-two
hours of the most exciting footage ever recorded, digital video that the Lawson Film cannot hold a candle
to. Tailor has tried, for the last few years, to have at least a portion of this footage released to the general
public. All international “experts” who have viewed the video have labeled it as an expert hoax. Tailor
has lost all credibility in an industry that once hailed him as one of its finest. He is now in the process of
settling a divorce and several lawsuits.
2001 A.D., SIDI-MOUSSA, MOROCCO
The only evidence of an attack comes from a small article on the back page of a French newspaper:
Outbreak of Mass Hysteria in Moroccan Fishing Village—Sources confirm that a previously unknown
neurological condition has affected five residents, causing them to attack their relatives and friends in an
attempt to eat their flesh. Acting on local custom, the afflicted were bound with rope and weights, taken
out to sea, then dumped into the ocean. A government investigation is pending. Charges range from
murder to negligent manslaughter.
No government trial materialized, and no further reports appeared.
2002 A.D., ST. THOMAS, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS
A zombie—bloated, waterlogged, with skin completely dissolved—washed ashore on the northeast
coast of the island. Local inhabitants were unsure of what to make of it, keeping their distance and calling
for the authorities. The zombie, stumbling up on the beach, began to pursue its onlookers. Although
curiosity kept them close, the crowd continued to retreat from the approaching ghoul. Two members of
the St. Thomas police arrived and ordered the “suspect” to halt. When no reply came, they fired a
warning shot. The zombie did not respond. One of the officers fired two rounds into its chest, producing

no effect. Before another volley could be delivered, a six-year-old boy, excited by the events and not
realizing the danger, ran up to the zombie and began to poke it with a stick. The walking dead
immediately grabbed the child and tried to raise it to its mouth. The two officers rushed forward and
attempted to wrestle the child from the zombie’s grip. At that moment, Jeremiah Dewitt, a recent
immigrant from the island of Dominica, stepped out of the crowd, grabbed one of the officer’s sidearms
and fired a round through the zombie’s head. Amazingly, no human was infected by the ghoul. A criminal
trial acquitted Dewitt of all charges, claiming the act was in self-defense. Photographs of the zombie
corpse show it, even though decomposed horribly, to be of Middle Eastern or North African descent.
The tatters of clothing and rope make a convincing case that the creature was one of those dumped into
the ocean off the coast of Morocco. Theoretically, it would be possible for an undead specimen to travel
with the currents across the Atlantic, although it would be the only case on record. In one of the strangest
twists of outbreak cover-ups and suppression, this case has taken on celebrity status. Like Bigfoot in the
Pacific Northwest or the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland, tourists can buy “St. Thomas Zombie”
photographs, T-shirts, sculptures, clocks, watches, and even children’s picture books at many of the
shops in downtown Charlotte Amalie (the island capital). Dozens of bus drivers compete (sometimes
fiercely) every day for the chance to drive newly arrived tourists from Cyril E. King Airport to the site
where the famous zombie came ashore. After the trial, Dewitt left for a new life in the United States. His
friends in St. Thomas and his family in Dominica have not heard from him since.
HISTORICAL ANALYSIS
Until the late twentieth century, those who studied the living dead were convinced that the frequency of
outbreaks remained constant throughout time. Societies that suffered more attacks than others appeared
so only because they kept the best records. The most commonly held example was ancient Rome
compared to the early Middle Ages. This theory was also used to calm “alarmists” by stating that, as
humanity as a whole relied more and more on the written word, it would appear as if outbreaks were
becoming more and more common. This way of thinking, although still common, has been falling into
disfavor for some time. The world’s population is growing. Its center has shifted from rural to urban
zones. Transportation has linked the planet with increasing speed. All these factors have led to a
renaissance of infectious diseases, most of which were thought to be eradicated centuries ago. Logic
dictates that Solanum can flourish in such a ripe environment. Even though information is being recorded,
shared, and stored as never before, it cannot hide the fact that zombie attacks are on the rise, their
frequency mirroring the “development” of this planet. At this rate, attacks will only increase, culminating in
one of two possibilities. The first is that world governments will have to acknowledge, both privately and
publicly, the existence of the living dead, creating special organizations to deal with the threat. In this
scenario, zombies will become an accepted part of daily life—marginalized, easily contained, perhaps
even vaccinated against. A second, more ominous scenario would result in an all-out war between the
living and the dead: a war you are now ready for.

This space is reserved for a journal of suspicious events that could indicate a possible outbreak. (See
“Detection,” for possible signs.) Remember: Early detection and advance preparation will ensure your
best chance for survival. A sample journal entry follows.
DATE:05/07/14

TIME:3:51A.M.
LOCATION:Anysmalltown, U.S.A.
DISTANCE FROM ME:Approx. 290 miles
SPECIFICS:The morning news (local, Channel 5) reported that a family was butchered and partially
eaten by some kind of “maniac” or “maniacs.” The bodies all looked like they’d been in a hardcore
brawl: bruises, cuts, broken bones. All had big bites in their flesh. All died from gunshots to the head.
They say it’s a cult killing. Why? What cult? From where? And who are “they”? All the reporter said was
that the explanation came from an “official source.” There’s a manhunt on now. I noticed that it’s only
police (no deputized citizens) and half of the cops were sharp-shooters. The press isn’t allowed on the
search because the police “can’t guarantee their safety.” The reporter said that the bodies were taken
back to Largecity, and not the local morgue because they needed to do a “full autopsy.” The hospital
they are taking them to is ONLY 50 MILES AWAY!
ACTION TAKEN:Got out the checklists. Called Tom, Gregg, Henry. Meeting tonight, Gregg’s place,
7:30P.M. Sharpened the machete. Cleaned and oiled the carbine and signed up for practice at the range
tomorrow before work. Filled the bike’s tires with air. Called the park service just to make sure the river
is at normal level. If incidents occur at the autopsy hospital, we’ll take more serious steps.
