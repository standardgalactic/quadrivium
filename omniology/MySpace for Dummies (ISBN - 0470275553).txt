About the Authors
Ryan Hupfer, a self-proclaimed “computer nerd,” has been consuming, pro-
ducing, and learning all things Web since his first introduction to dial-up. 
With a rare mix of being both a social butterfly and a tech geek, he has 
always strived to find ways to utilize technology in a way that connects peo-
ple and calls them to action. He is a strong believer in the ability to fulfill and 
extend the human need to connect with others online and is always looking at 
ways to leverage emerging technologies to benefit people’s lives. By the time he 
hit his college years, Ryan was deep into the world of computer programming; all 
while being a bartender at one of Indianapolis’ most popular dance clubs. In 
early 2004, Ryan’s odd mix of being both a technology expert and socialite 
came together when he created his first online social community, www.
HupsHoopty.com, which was based on his recent purchase of a brown 1992 
GMC full-size custom van. This online community became an unlikely stepping 
stone and a door for opportunity in Ryan’s life and eventually led him to land-
ing a job at Indianapolis-based new media/communications company, 
MediaSauce (www.mediasauce.com). He then moved back into the social com-
munity world once again when he launched the locally-based www.IndyMojo.
com in Indianapolis. He currently is sitting at Starbucks wondering where he 
will end up next.
In December of 2005 Ryan and Mitch Maxson, both MediaSauce employees, 
along with Ryan’s roommate, a film crew and two bus drivers traveled across 
the United States in a 50-foot tour bus for two weeks in search of their Top 8 
MySpace friends — whom they’d never met. The tour, called “Hup ‘n Dub’s 
Top 8 Tour” was created in an effort to better understand why millions of 
people were so attracted to the new online social phenomenon. Since the 
tour, Ryan has been constantly keeping up with all things Web 2.0 and he is 
extremely inspired and intrigued by the ways that the online world is now 
flipping the media world upside down. Speaking of media, Ryan was also 
“discovered” by a local NBC Indianapolis news station, WTHR (www.wthr.
com), when they watched a video podcast that MediaSauce created around 
the 2006 Final Four, called IndyPods (indypods.mediasauce.com). With his 
hands in both the traditional and new media world, there’s no telling where 
Ryan will end up next. You can keep up with him on his MySpace page at 
www.MySpace.com/hupdaddy or on his blog at www.hupandsteph.com.
Mitch Maxson co-created his first interactive development firm (Transgres) 
just two years after graduating from Purdue University. After two years of 
sustained growth, Transgres joined MediaSauce to pursue a shared vision of 
broadband-based integrated communications. Today, as a partner and Senior 
Creative Director, Mitch has helped grow MediaSauce from 8 employees to 
more than 50 in just two years. As a constant proponent of “what comes 
next” and the emergence of audience-centric messaging and broadband 

connectivity, Mitch’s focus is on understanding individuals and inspiring new 
ways for them to interact with the people they care about and the world that 
surrounds them. With MediaSauce, Mitch can be found preaching the vision 
of the ongoing integration of communication, entertainment, and media while 
helping clients better understand their audiences and how to connect with them.
Ryan Williams is a multimedia designer, author, and bassist based in Indianapolis, 
Indiana. In addition to this book, he has written for titles including Teach Yourself 
VISUALLY Bass Guitar, Expert Podcast Practices For Dummies, and Windows XP 
Digital Music For Dummies (all by Wiley Publishing, Inc.). He also acted as techni-
cal editor for Second Life For Dummies and Composing Digital Music For Dummies 
(both by Wiley Publishing, Inc.). His work also includes several digital multimedia 
projects, including podcasts for the Indiana University School of Dentistry and 
garage band tutorials for grooveboxmusic.com. As a bassist, he’s appeared 
with and recorded for everybody from Grammy-award-winning hip-hop art-
ists to a stage full of bagpipers. His playing can be heard on several albums, 
educational exhibits, and monster truck commercials.

Dedications
I dedicate this, my first book-writing adventure, to my “super rad” parents, 
Clarence and Alice Hupfer, who have always supported me no matter what 
crazy thing I was doing. 
—Ryan Hupfer
To Pixie, for always supporting me, believing in me, encouraging my ridicu-
lousness, and being the most amazing person I’ll ever know. To my family for 
teaching me how to live, trusting me enough to do it my way, and being there 
for every question that falls in between. To friends — while technology will 
continue to impact the ways in which we connect with the world around us, 
true friends are the ones who come over for dinner or come out to play.
—Mitch Maxson
For Jennifer — here’s to more adventures.
—Ryan Williams


Authors’ Acknowledgments
I would like to thank the Wiley dynamic duo, Steve Hayes and Blair Pottenger, 
for making their best effort in keeping me on schedule with this book. I would 
also like to give a hi-five to Mr. Ryan Williams who made Mitch and I look bad 
because he wrote so dang fast. 
Thanks to my partner in crime, the always insightful Mitch Maxson, for mak-
ing this book such a fun read and for being the greatest writer, ever. Holla!
A HUGE thanks goes to my boss at the time when I started this writing, my 
mentor, and my friend, Mr. Bryan Gray, CEO of MediaSauce, for giving me the 
flexibility to finish this project and for teaching me more about myself than I 
ever knew. 
Thanks to Stephanie for being awesome, for beating me badly at checkers, 
and for listening. Squeeze times three.
—Ryan Hupfer
Thanks to Ryan Hupfer for being crazy, but not insane (no matter what they 
say), and for appreciating my weird brain as much as I do yours. Thanks to 
everyone at MediaSauce for sharing a vision and enjoying the passionate pur-
suit therein.
—Mitch Maxson
Many thanks to Steve Hayes and Blair Pottenger for their tireless efforts on 
this project, as well as my fellow authors Ryan and Mitch.  Thanks also to the 
folks on MySpace that make it worth returning to.
—Ryan Williams

Introduction
G
 reetings, and welcome to MySpace For Dummies, 2nd Edition. With 
more than 100 million unique visitors each month (spending an average 
of more than 30 minutes on the site each time they visit), MySpace is more 
than an Internet phenomenon. To many, it’s a central portion of their life-
style and the central hub for connecting and communicating. In fact, if you’re 
taking the time to read this Introduction, you probably know at least one, if 
not several, of these individuals.
Like so many technological tools and services these days, MySpace doesn’t 
come with a user manual or guidebook to help you figure out how the site 
works. If you’re like a lot of people out there in the online world, you enjoy 
using the Internet to keep in touch with your friends — but you don’t have 
the time, energy, or interest to spend forever figuring out how things work. 
You just want to have fun and not stress out about the details of using your 
computer. We understand that feeling — and we’re here to help.
Think of us as the friendliest computer nerds you’ll ever know. We actually 
do keep up with all the geeky computer stuff that makes the guys with the 
pocket protectors and lab coats giddy — but we also know how to filter out 
the stuff you don’t care about and highlight the stuff you need to know. I 
guess our moms were right — we are quite a catch. And we’ve packaged it 
all together in chunks so when you need to know something about MySpace, 
you can read what you need and move on. Nothing dumb about that, huh?
About This Book
We’ll be honest with you — we’re shocked that you’re reading this introduc-
tion. Reading from start to finish isn’t what this book, or any For Dummies 
book, is about. In fact, if all you do is pick up the book when you need to 
know something about MySpace, find your topic in the Table of Contents or 
Index, read the page or two that covers that topic, and put your book back 
down to gather dust until the next time you need it, we have done our job. 
Yay us!!!
We don’t expect you to become an instant MySpace guru with a half-million 
friends and the most tricked-out profile page on the site after using this book 
a couple times. We don’t expect you to be able to spout off lectures on the 
minutiae of MySpace’s programming code. We’ve kept this book simple so 
you can get the info you need without a computer science degree.

MySpace For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
We take a pretty straightforward approach to how we cover MySpace. We 
know MySpace has a lot of tools you can use — and that you only want to 
figure out how to use them (and maybe not all of them or all the time). So 
we’ve covered what you want to know, including
 
 Signing up for an account and setting up your profile
 
 Turning on MySpace’s safety and security tools
 
 Finding friends and keeping in touch with them
 
 Upgrading your profile with photos, music, and a whole new look
 
 Showing off your talents on MySpace
 
 Selling, buying, and marketing on MySpace
Conventions Used in This Book
When we started telling our friends that we were writing a For Dummies book 
about MySpace, a few of them looked at us like we were crazy. The typical 
question was “How are you going to write a 300-page book about MySpace? 
All you have to do is play around with it and you can figure out anything!” 
But it’s like we said — we’re card-carrying computer nerds, and most of 
our friends are kind of geeky as well. Besides, we know that you may not be 
interested in spending hours upon hours “playing around” with your profile 
when you can just figure out how to do it right, stay safe, and get the most of 
it right here. So, we told them to put their propeller hats back on and go back 
to their labs.
For the rest of us, this book is ideal when you get stuck trying to get some-
thing done on MySpace or when you think of something you want to do on 
MySpace and don’t want to waste your time guessing how to do it. Check out 
the Table of Contents or the Index to find what it is you want to do. After you 
find it, read it, complete your task, and carry on. You won’t even be tested on 
it later.
Along the way, we also share some insight into MySpace that we’ve gathered 
during our time logged on to the site. We signed up on the site pretty early 
on and showed signs of addiction right away. A couple of us, Ryan Hupfer 
and Mitch Maxson, even commandeered a bus to go around the country and 
meet our Top 8 friends live and in person, getting a taste of how MySpace is 
changing the culture along the way. We even stopped in the MySpace offices 
in Santa Monica to meet a few of the people who really make MySpace work. 
No one has seen everything when it comes to MySpace, but we come pretty 
close, and we share that knowledge with you as we go.

 Introduction
The good folks at Wiley Publishing, the people who actually make the For 
Dummies books, have devised a good system for letting us get our point 
across when we’re explaining how MySpace works.
 
 Bulleted lists: When you come across a bulleted list like this one, we’re 
usually breaking down a list of MySpace options into smaller chunks for 
quicker reading. For example, when we cover setting up your profile in 
Chapter 2, we go over all your options in bulleted lists. You don’t have 
to follow the list in order, point by point — just jump to what you want 
to know and follow the guidance you get there.
 
 Numbered step lists: When you see a list broken down into numbered 
steps, we’re walking you through a specific process toward reaching a 
set goal. For instance, we offer a numbered how-to list when we tell you 
how to upload photos to your MySpace page in Chapter 10. Follow the 
steps and you should get the results you want.
 
 Web addresses: Here and there throughout the book, we instruct you 
to type a specific Web site address into your browser. Those refer-
ences look like this — www.myspace.com. If you’re still not sure how 
things like Web browsers work, you might take a look at The Internet 
For Dummies, 11th Edition, by John Levine, Margaret Levine Young, and 
Carol Baroudi, to get some help with the basics of the Internet.
Foolish Assumptions
We’re a bit bold and make a few assumptions about you because you picked 
up MySpace For Dummies, 2nd Edition. We’re guessing you’ve heard about 
MySpace, want to try it out for yourself, and have access to a computer that 
lets you get on the Internet and access MySpace. It doesn’t matter if the com-
puter is a PC or Mac or something else — MySpace works the same on all 
flavors of computer.
What we’re not sure about is why you want to get on MySpace — yeah, okay, 
the details are none of our beeswax — but our guess is that you’ve heard 
it’s a great way to keep up with friends and meet new people with similar 
interests. Or maybe someone in your family — likely a teenager — is either 
on MySpace or wants to join MySpace, and you want to know more about it 
before they sign on. Or maybe you’re already signed up on MySpace and just 
want to use more of its tools. Whatever your purposes, we have you covered.
One thing we do assume about all our readers is that you’re interested in 
keeping safe and secure while you’re using MySpace. Okay, MySpace has 
gotten a lot of attention because of some Internet bad guys who have used 
MySpace to contact other users — especially teenage users — with illicit 

4
MySpace For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
and illegal proposals. Unfortunately, those people are a reality in both the 
real world and the online world, and to help you stay as safe as possible, we 
concentrated a lot of information about MySpace safety in Chapter 3. We also 
littered safety info throughout the book. We want your MySpace experience 
to be safe and fun — and we share a lot of pointers to make sure you get that 
experience.
How This Book Is Organized
We keep promising that this book is set up so you can use only the pieces 
you need to get the results you want. Well, the first step in this process is 
dividing all the info into parts that cover the big topics on MySpace. Where 
you choose to start reading depends on whether you’re a complete MySpace 
newbie (in which case, welcome!), a current member who wants to pump up 
your page, or a professional looking to use MySpace as a way to get the word 
about your business or talent out to a lot of people. Here’s how we’ve orga-
nized the parts of our book.
Part I: MySpace Overview and Basics
This is the part you need to turn to if you’re just getting started with 
MySpace. We cover the basics of what you can do on the MySpace site, how 
to get signed up with an account, how to set up your profile with the informa-
tion you want to share with other MySpace users, and how to stay safe and 
secure when using MySpace.
Part II: The MySpace Community
The main goal of MySpace is pretty simple: putting users in contact with 
each other. This part covers the main tools for making those contacts. We 
take a look at how to find friends, add friends to your MySpace profile, and 
stay in touch with those friends via e-mail messages, bulletins, and profile 
comments. We also cover keeping a Web log — that’s what a blog is if you’re 
visiting from another planet and haven’t heard of ’em — on your MySpace 
page. This part shares guidance on using MySpace’s calendar, event invita-
tions, and forums, and on creating or joining groups. We also show how you 
can keep up with your MySpace account on a mobile phone.

 Introduction
Part III: Customizing MySpace
MySpace allows users to decorate profile pages with photos, video, and 
music tracks posted by the musical artists who have also made a home on 
MySpace (which makes perfect sense — after all, musicians started it). Truly 
bold users can even dig into the programming code that runs MySpace to 
change the colors, layout, and background image they use for their pages. 
This part walks you through the steps needed to change your MySpace page 
into something unique.
Part IV: Capturing Your Audience
With millions of users logging on to MySpace every day, the site’s become 
a great way for musicians, filmmakers, comedians, and authors to share 
their works. Also, with millions of eyes on the site, marketers have turned to 
MySpace to get the word out about movie releases, television premieres, club 
events, product availability, and just about every other type of sellable stuff 
you can think of. This part shows how to use the tools to show off your own 
talents on MySpace — as well as some ideas on how to get more eyes on your 
stuff.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In the great tradition of the For Dummies series, we close MySpace For 
Dummies, 2nd Edition, with the Part of Tens. Here you find a few chapters 
that break down some key points about MySpace into short, easy-to-read sec-
tions. We also share some insight that didn’t quite fit anywhere else in the 
book. Flip to this section to read about other Web sites similar to MySpace, 
a few places you can go for help with your MySpace page, or quick tips on 
MySpace safety.
Icons Used in This Book
Occasionally you’ll encounter a little figure to the left of the text. Those are 
icons. These figures are sort of like road signs; they point out notes that give 
you a heads-up when a piece of information is a bit techy or provides a valu-
able tip. Be on the lookout for the following icons:
 
We’ve been bumping around MySpace for a while and have some ideas about 
how to improve your MySpace experience. The Tip icon points you to these 
suggestions.

6
MySpace For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
We don’t ask you to commit many things to memory, but every once in a while 
we add something that’s worth keeping in mind while you’re using MySpace. 
Just remember to look for this icon (we haven’t come up with an icon for 
that yet).
 
Our goal is to steer you clear of the tripwires and pitfalls you might encounter 
while using MySpace. This icon shows you the detours around the things that 
might cause problems down the road.
 
Although we’ve tried our best to keep all the geeky information out of your 
way, sometimes we do have to throw in a few bits here and there that explain 
the technology that makes MySpace work. Don’t worry, this icon lets you 
know when we’re about to get nerdy on you. (If you read what’s there anyway, 
we won’t tell a soul.)
Where to Go from Here
We’re sure you’re tired of reading about MySpace and are ready to start 
exploring the popular Web site. Go ahead and sit down at your computer and 
log on to www.myspace.com. But be sure to keep this book by your side and 
flip to the page you need whenever you hit a rough spot.

you have is a good look at who’s on MySpace, what tools 
are on MySpace, and how you get signed up and create a

I
n the brief history of the Internet and the World Wide Web, no Web site 
has made as sudden and as large an impact as MySpace. In the short 
couple of years since it first went online, MySpace has grown from a place 
for bands and musical artists to share their work to a popular online hangout 
for teenagers and college students to a social and cultural phenomenon that 
boasts over 200 million profiles and is valued at more than $15 billion.
That growth pushed MySpace into the media spotlight for both good and bad 
reasons. Technology watchers marveled at how quickly the site grew and 
celebrated how it gave people a place where they could share their thoughts, 
photos, and things that made them unique individuals. Users connected with 
old friends and made new ones across the globe. On the dark side, the site gave 
stalkers and other Internet bad guys one-to-one access to potential victims.
We hope this book clears up all the mysteries of MySpace for you — and 
shows how you can use the site to share as much (or as little) information 
as you want with either a worldwide audience or a small circle of friends. 
In this chapter, we give you a view of MySpace from 30,000 feet. We go over 
what the site allows users to do, what tools are available to share your story 
or find others with similar interest, and we try to get to the bottom of what 
makes MySpace so popular with both kids and adults.
Whose Space? MySpace!
At its most basic definition, MySpace is a social networking Web site located on 
the World Wide Web dial at www.myspace.com. A social networking Web site 
is a site that allows users to create individual profiles (as shown in Figure 1-1) 
in hopes of making contact with other site users that share similar interests or 
goals.

The age of user-generated Web content
If you follow technology trends, you may have 
heard people who spend a lot of time thinking 
about the future of the Internet using the term 
Web 2.0. That term refers to the recent growth 
of Web sites that provide a platform for regular 
users to post content and participate in their 
own Web experience.
MySpace is the perfect example of a Web 2.0 
site. Rather than developing a ton of content on 
its own, MySpace provides the technology for 
users to post their own words, photos, videos, 
music, and other items on their profiles. Some 
of the Web’s most popular sites — including 
online auctioneer eBay, online encyclopedia 
Wikipedia, video-hosting site YouTube, and the 
many blogs of the “blogosphere” — fit under 
the Web 2.0 umbrella.
If user-generated content is part of the defini-
tion of Web 2.0, we figure Web 1.0 was back 
when designers built pages, filled them with 
content, and you went online just to see what 
was on the site. Web 1.5 probably came along 
when you could actually do something with a 
Web site — such as order a product from a 
company’s Web site. So what’s Web 3.0? Those 
guys who spend all that time thinking about the 
Internet continue to argue that point.

11
 Chapter 1: Diving into the MySpace Pool
Think of social networking sites as big parties that live online. You walk into 
a room full of people and see some close friends, some familiar faces, and a 
lot of complete strangers. You naturally gravitate toward your close friends. 
Those close friends acquaint you with the familiar faces they know based 
on your mutual friendship. Those new acquaintances then introduce you 
to the complete strangers they know based on your mutual interests. The 
same thing happens on MySpace, except there are on the order of 200 mil-
lion people at the party, so grab your breath spray and lace up your dancing 
shoes!
The people in your MySpace neighborhood
The MySpace site contains over 200 million profiles. Although that stat is 
true, it doesn’t mean that over 200 million individuals are actually using 
MySpace. A profile is a unique MySpace page that shares information about a 
user. Along with all the personal MySpace pages, there are profiles for bands, 
artists, businesses, films, television shows, clubs, cities, and about any other 
entity you can dream of. Some users even create multiple profiles to address 
different interests. As you begin to make your way through MySpace, you’ll 
encounter many different profiles, such as
 
 Individual users: The most common profile type is the individual user. 
These are the people who sign up to share insight into their own lives or 
personalities on MySpace. Mixed in with the regular folks on MySpace 
are a number of celebrities (and celebrity wannabes and celebrity imper-
sonators) who use the site to promote their work or just keep in touch 
with their fans, but in the end, they’re really just people like you and me 
(they just have better hair).
 
 Bands and musicians: MySpace’s musician-friendly tools allow musical 
artists to share their work on the site and connect with fans, as shown in 
Figure 1-2. This service is what helped spur the site’s fast growth. Every 
level of act, from the biggest-name bands in the world to the kids making 
a racket in the garage across the street, can build MySpace pages to 
share their music and build a fan base. See Chapter 14 for more informa-
tion on adding and finding bands on MySpace.
 
 Businesses and marketers: Any time you collect millions of people 
together on a single site, marketers will naturally try to find a way to get 
their messages out to the masses. You can’t blame them, it’s just their 
way. MySpace is no exception. Businesses create profiles for their prod-
ucts and product launches in hopes of generating grass-roots buzz. See 
Chapter 13 for more on how marketing works on MySpace.

 Films and filmmakers: Hollywood knows a good thing when they see it. 
Movie studios have used MySpace to release previews of their films and 
generate excitement for a feature’s opening weekend. You can usually 
find a MySpace profile for almost any film ranging from big budget block-
busters to art house indies.
 
 MySpace has also added special features for filmmakers who want to use 
the site to promote their works. Filmmaker profiles include a special clip 
player where they can show off their clips to would-be fans. Check out 
Chapter 15 to find more info on MySpace’s Filmmaker profiles.
 
 Comedians: MySpace knows that everybody loves to laugh. Comedians 
are the most recent artist community to get their own profiles on 
MySpace. A Comedy profile, shown in Figure 1-3, features a calendar 
of appearances and a player where the comedian can share clips of his 
or her act. For more on Comedy profiles, see Chapter 15.
 
 Clubs and organizations: Groups ranging from community booster 
clubs to school organizations to church groups register MySpace pro-
files to keep in touch with their current members as well as to attract 
new members. MySpace includes tools to build groups where you can 
collect other members into smaller communities. We cover how to set 
up and join these groups in Chapter 9.

13
 Chapter 1: Diving into the MySpace Pool
 
Figure 1-3:

 Politicians: Just as the music community quickly realized that the 
MySpace community is a powerful way to get the word out about their 
latest CD, the political world is quickly realizing the value of the millions 
of potential voters as well. From local mayors to presidential candidates, 
MySpace is quickly becoming a hotbed for the nation’s hottest topics. 
Take a look at Chapter 15 for some more insight on the political side of 
MySpace and what it means to you.
That list just scratches the surface of the variety of profiles you’ll see on 
MySpace. We’ve also seen profiles set up for television shows, individual con-
certs, pets, dance clubs, restaurants, recording studios, cities, music venues, 
promotional companies, and other Web sites. We’ve even seen a profile regis-
tered for the jukebox at one of our favorite pubs. In short, anytime someone 
has information they want to share with a big audience, be it individual per-
sonality traits or promotion for a product or event, MySpace is becoming the 
first stop for getting the word out.
The allure of MySpace
MySpace was certainly not the first social networking Web site. You can argue 
that the idea of social networking on the Internet goes back to when people 
started putting together mailing lists from their e-mail accounts so they could 
send mass messages to friends and family — like those tear-jerking stories or 

14
Part I: MySpace Overview and Basics 
adorable pictures of kittens that came with instructions demanding the mes-
sage be passed on or true love would not be within reach. Because MySpace 
wasn’t the first social-networking tool on the Internet, it makes us wonder why 
it’s become the most popular networking site. We have a few theories:
 
 Artist-friendly tools: The biggest thing MySpace offered to users that 
other social-networking sites didn’t was the ability for musicians to 
store music tracks on the site and share them with fans. As musicians 
signed up to take advantage of the service, they publicized their new 
resource to their fans. These fans, looking to stay connected to their 
favorite groups or to a cool music scene, followed the artists to MySpace 
and began inviting their friends. The site took off from there.
 
 Search tools and categories: MySpace includes the opportunity to include 
your personal interests and hobbies on your profile. The site also lets you 
add any schools you’ve attended, businesses you’ve worked for, or indus-
tries you follow onto your page. All these points of contact make it easier 
for people to filter through to find current friends, old contacts, or other 
users with shared interests to add to their own Friend Lists. See Chapter 4 
for more info about finding friends on MySpace.
 
 The dating scene: The second wave of MySpace users was dominated 
by young adults, many of which were single and looking for a way to 
meet other singles. MySpace offers the opportunity to set up a profile 
that lets the world know you’re on the dating scene and open to contact 
from interested individuals. (Of course, later waves of users were filled 
with people who were in relationships and not interested in proposi-
tions from strangers.) MySpace also offers means to filter out those 
contacts. See Chapter 2 for more information on setting up a profile that 
meets your goals on MySpace.
 
 Many services collected in one site: Before MySpace, there were sites 
for social networking, sharing photos, posting music files, showing 
video, starting a Web diary, sending out event invitations, keeping an 
appointment calendar, and sending and receiving messages. MySpace 
collected all those services under one site. MySpace has become a one-
stop shop for the things most people like to do on the Web.
 
 Customizable pages: Although you could load tons of information about 
yourself on other social-networking sites, you couldn’t do much to change 
the way your personal page looked. You were stuck with the same white/
silver/blue look that everyone used. MySpace opened up their pages to 
modification so people could customize the look, and now those pages are 
designed with help from editing tools or good old-fashioned HTML (short 
for HyperText Markup Language, the language used to design Web pages). 
A MySpace user can change his or her page from the boring white/silver/
blue to one with a cool background photo, individualized text fonts, and a 
customized pointer — all without needing any programming experience — 
as shown in Figure 1-4. After all, this is your “Space,” and if you’ll be having 
company over, it had best resemble your personality and your style. Skip to 
Chapter 12 if you want to know more about tricking out your MySpace page.

15
 Chapter 1: Diving into the MySpace Pool
 
 Sharing with a huge audience: Marketers want to get the word out 
about their products to as many people as they can. Filmmakers, come-
dians, and even politicians know their success hinges on getting as many 
eyes and ears on their work as possible. Individuals who have a message 
they want to share with the masses know it’s better to share it once 
with a lot of people than many times with small groups. With millions 
of users, MySpace has built the audience for any of these user types. 
As the MySpace audience grows, so will the number of people who use 
MySpace to express themselves and build an audience.
 
 Hanging out and keeping up with your friends: Although it’s last on 
our list, the notion of just having a place where you can keep in touch 
and keep up with your friends shouldn’t be discounted as a small part 
of MySpace’s popularity. Humans are social animals. In an age where we 
all find ourselves strapped for time, MySpace provides a forum where 
we can contact and stay in touch with our friends or make new friends 
from any computer hooked to the Internet at any time of day. Being on 
MySpace is being part of an in-crowd.
 
For all the reasons people join MySpace, there are as many reasons that 
MySpace haters don’t join. The popular ones we’ve heard are they don’t have 
the time to spend on the site or the site is just for kids. We’d argue the latter 
reason is incorrect, and recent research shows that an increasing number 
of MySpacers (almost a majority, in fact) are over the age of 25. Admittedly, 
we haven’t found any medical professional who has listed having a MySpace 
profile as a basic life necessity alongside food, water, and shelter. So if all our 
reasons for joining aren’t enough to entice you, you should be able to live a 
full life without MySpace.

The Nuts and Bolts of MySpace
MySpace is a one-stop shop for a lot of services offered on other Web sites. 
When you begin to peel off the layers of the MySpace site, you quickly dis-
cover there’s a lot going on at www.myspace.com. After you get signed up at 
MySpace, you have access to many tools — such as these:
 
 Web building: At its foundation, the MySpace service is a basic Web-
building tool that lets you create your own site and customize it to your 
liking. Rather than having to start from scratch with HTML or Web-
building software, you just fill in the blanks at MySpace to create your 
page. See Chapter 2 for more info about building your MySpace page 
from the ground up.
 
 Online photo album: Along with your profile picture that appears on your 
MySpace profile page, you can upload other photos that are viewable 
by other MySpace members (or, if you choose, by your friends only), as 
shown in Figure 1-5. Similar to a worldwide yearbook, this photo album is 
the first place someone will go to see what you look like. Jump to Chapter 
10 for more guidance on using the MySpace photo tools.
 
 Blog: MySpace provides a built-in tool for starting your own Web diary, 
better known online as a blog. Blogs, short for Web logs, are online jour-
nals where users record thoughts or report on events. MySpace allows 
you to make your blog publicly viewable or viewable only to a select 
audience. You can even mark individual entries as private if you wish. 
We cover blogging in-depth in Chapter 6.
 
 Video hosting: MySpace added a tool for hosting and sharing short video 
clips. You can find more information on how to add and view videos in 
Chapter 11.

 Chapter 1: Diving into the MySpace Pool
 
 Calendar: Tired of carrying around your old calendar book? MySpace 
provides a fully customizable calendar tool that allows you to enter 
plans and appointments. You can then choose to share your calendar 
with friends or keep it private. We cover calendar functions in detail in 
Chapter 8.
 
 Address book: Need a place to store the e-mail addresses and MySpace 
usernames of your closest friends? MySpace’s Address Book tool 
keeps track of that important information. For more information on the 
Address Book, see Chapter 5.
 
 Send and receive messages: Your MySpace account comes with a 
mailbox similar to an e-mailbox where other MySpace users can send 
you messages or get replies from you. We cover MySpace messaging in 
Chapter 5.
 
 Post a bulletin: You share a Bulletin Space (as shown in Figure 1-6) 
with all your MySpace friends that you add to your profile. The bulletin 
option is a good way to get a message to all your friends at once. We 
cover bulletins in Chapter 5.
 
 Post an event and invite your friends: Although you can share your 
personal calendar with your friends, you can share information about 
a happening with the entire MySpace population by entering it as an 
event. You can filter the events page by location or time frame to find 
just the events going on in a certain area during a certain time. After you 
post an event, you can follow up by inviting your MySpace friends or 
other contacts that don’t use MySpace to the event. We cover the details 
of the event calendar and invites in Chapter 8.

18
Part I: MySpace Overview and Basics 
 
 Chat with other users: MySpace provides a forum for posting comments 
on specific topics to a bulletin board or taking part in live chat in an online 
chat room. Chapter 9 covers both these features in detail.
 
 Leave comments: MySpace offers the chance for your friends to com-
ment on your profile, blog entries, or photos. You can do the same for 
your friends. We like to think of these comments as the online equiva-
lent of yearbook autographs. They’re usually brief notes offering kudos 
or a greeting. There’s more info about comments in Chapter 5.
 
 Update your mood and status: Just when you thought that doing daily 
updates on what you’re up to was enough, now you can literally update 
your mood and your current status at any given point of time. You want 
instant gratification, you got it — check out Chapter 5 for more details 
on how to keep your MySpace friends in the loop at all times.
 
 Post a classified ad: MySpace offers a classified ads forum where you 
can search for a job, a service, an item, or a date, as shown in Figure 1-7. 
You can also offer something for sale. The classifieds pages are divided 
by geographic region centered around the big cities in the MySpace 
world. Check out Chapter 9 for more info on the Classifieds section.

Is MySpace Safe?
MySpace has garnered more than its fair share of public and media attention — 
partially for it’s amazing rise in popularity and use, and partially because some 
online bad guys have used the site to perpetrate crimes. The most common 

19
 Chapter 1: Diving into the MySpace Pool
stories have revolved around adults that use MySpace to contact underage 
users with propositions of sex. Such stories have been rampant enough that 
some parents and schools have labeled MySpace as a source of problems and 
worked to keep young users away from the service.
It’d be unfair for us to not address these problems in this book. In fact, 
throughout the book we offer examples of how the various MySpace tools 
can potentially leave a profile open to unwanted contact. We also explain 
how you can set up your profile to prevent unwanted contact. There’s a lot 
of information in Chapter 3 specifically on how to secure your MySpace site 
from the online bad guys out there. If MySpace security is an immediate con-
cern of yours, we recommend you jump to that chapter.
 
Our answer to the question “Is MySpace safe?” is a reserved “yes.” We think 
MySpace is safe the same way an automobile is safe if you use your seat 
belt, drive in good conditions, and follow the rules of the road. If you don’t 
buckle your safety belt, drive on bald tires, and push your speed over the 
legal limit, you’re asking for trouble. The same thing happens on MySpace if 
you build a profile that potentially attracts unsavory individuals. Remember, 
think of MySpace as an online party — although most partygoers are just out 
for a good time with their friends, there are others who show up looking for 
trouble. Use common sense and commit to being safe. We cover how to tweak 
your profile to prevent attention from unwanted guests in Chapter 2 and how 
to stay safe on MySpace in Chapter 3.
As you work your way through this book and gather tips and techniques for 
keeping a MySpace profile secure, keep a few general comments in mind:
 
 MySpace is a reflection of the real world. In one of our favorite articles 
about MySpace, the journalist likened the site to a shopping mall. A 
shopping mall attracts visitors of all ages and all walks of life. Teens 
gather for social reasons. Adults handling specific errands are mixed 
in. People working in the mall are trying to get you to buy things. Also 
sprinkled in this crowd, however, are a small number of people up to no 
good, like shoplifting or making illicit contact with teenagers.
 
 MySpace is a reflection of what’s going on in our figurative shopping mall. 
The main difference between the real world and the MySpace world is 
that the Internet offers an anonymity that you can’t achieve in the real 
world. Adults can pose as teenagers online to make initial contact.
 
 Just as a parent wouldn’t send a teenager to a shopping mall alone 
without preparing them to handle any bad situation they encounter, a 
parent shouldn’t let a teenager navigate MySpace without similar advice. 
MySpace maintains a good set of tips for users and parents of teenage 
users on how to address safety concerns. Go to www1.myspace.com/
misc/safetyTips.html for insight on managing your profile or a 
teenager’s profile for maximum security.

 Think before you post. If you have a public profile, remember that what 
you put on your MySpace site is viewable not only by your friends, but 
also by those MySpace outlaws, your colleagues, classmates, potential 
employers, and other people you might not want to share certain infor-
mation with.
 
 Before you post that photo of yourself at the beach in your supersmall 
bikini or your blog rant about your co-workers, think about who might 
see it and how they might react. If the outcome might be negative, it’s 
best that you don’t add the content to your MySpace page. Always 
remember, not only can your friends see those pictures, so can your 
family members, current co-workers, and future employers.
 
 Change your profile to change your results. Be sure to get a good grasp 
on all the safety tools available to you and realize that almost everything 
you put on your own MySpace page can be changed or erased at any time. 
You can limit the people who can view your site to your Friend List by set-
ting your profile to Private, as shown in Figure 1-8. You can also block cer-
tain users from accessing your page. In short, you can completely change 
your MySpace page at any time if you feel that it’s attracting the wrong 
element. Chapter 3 covers the main techniques for limiting your audience, 
whereas Chapter 2 explains how to edit your profile.
 
 Ignoring is an option. Your MySpace Mail is the only way MySpace 
users who are not your friends can contact you. As with your standard 
e-mail, the most effective way to resist unwanted contact is to simply 
ignore it. Deleting unwanted messages without responding usually sends 
the message that you don’t want to talk to the user. If unwanted con-
tact keeps coming from the same source, you can then block the user 
and report him or her to MySpace customer service. Chapter 3 has the 
details on handling those steps.

 Chapter 1: Diving into the MySpace Pool
The MySpace Developer Platform
MySpace first became extremely popular due to many different circum-
stances — one of the major ones being complete customization. In the early 
days of MySpace your profile was basically a blank canvas, and what you 
added to it was only limited by your knowledge paired with your amount of 
available free time. Back when MySpace first started, there were many users 
who even developed certain applications that made MySpace more useful, 
more efficient, or just plain more fun to use, and MySpace became an even 
better place to hang out online. But, as time moved on, more and more users 
hopped onto the MySpace bandwagon. With legitimate users and a huge new 
audience came those who began to take advantage of MySpace’s openness 
with spam and other types of intentionally harmful exploits. This eventually 
led to MySpace’s decision to block most of the ability to create the types of 
applications that many were enjoying legitimately.
Up until lately this was still MySpace’s stance on the community having the 
power to create and distribute their own applications across the MySpace 
network — but, that’s now all about to change with the creation of the 
MySpace Developer Platform (MDP). The MDP will once again put some 
of the power back into the hands of the MySpace community by allowing 
them to once again develop, integrate, and distribute applications that 
could potentially connect directly to MySpace’s millions of members. 
Keeping an eye on your kids’ MySpace pages
Although MySpace offers plenty of tools 
and advice on keeping kids safe while using 
MySpace, you can’t rely on the site to handle 
all possible problem users. If your child uses 
MySpace, we recommend you get your kid’s 
MySpace URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and 
regularly check the profile. You can even sign 
on to get your own MySpace ID so you can 
check the photo album. If your child has a pri-
vate profile, send a Friend Request — and insist 
that you be added to the Friend List so you can 
view the page; otherwise (if it comes to a power 
struggle), no MySpace. Keep an eye on who’s 
leaving comments, what your kids are putting in 
their blogs, and what messages they’re send-
ing with their pages. You can even check out 
the pages of some of their “friends.” You might 
even find your kid has a second profile that you 
didn’t know about. MySpace is a very public 
forum. Remember the old online rule that e-mail 
is about as “private” as a postcard? MySpace is 
even less private. Although we certainly believe 
your son or daughter has a right to keep his or 
her private thoughts private, MySpace isn’t an 
effective venue for storing any information one 
wants to keep private.

22
Part I: MySpace Overview and Basics 
For MySpace, this is a prefect way to get back some of the creativity and 
community involvement that was present in the earlier days, while still being 
able to control and protect the MySpace network from potentially harmful 
applications.

In This Chapter
 Signing up
 Choosing a good username
 Adding personal info
 Making changes to your account
T
he first step to getting your own shiny, new page on MySpace is to sign 
up on the site. If you’ve ever opened a member account on a Web site, 
such as Yahoo!, or registered to use an Internet message board, the process 
of getting a MySpace account is similar. You give your name, e-mail address, 
and information about what town you live in, and abracadabra, you’re a 
member.
The big difference between signing up on MySpace and signing up on other 
sites is that the information you enter when you create your MySpace profile 
will be immediately shared with anyone who takes a look at your MySpace 
page. If you’re concerned about online privacy or want to keep a low online 
profile, the information you enter when you sign up on MySpace might be 
vastly different from someone signing up on MySpace to make contact with 
new friends.
In this chapter, we walk you through the process of signing up to become a 
MySpace user. We show you what information you provide becomes part of 
your public MySpace profile and what information stays private. We also dis-
cuss setting up your profile and tweaking your information to get the results 
you want out of MySpace. Also, this is a good time to note that at the time 
of this writing there are two choices for your MySpace profile’s home page 
look and layout, Classic View and the New Home Skin. The New Home Skin is 
the default layout for any new profile and it incorporates many of MySpace’s 
latest tools, so for the purpose of this book will use it as well.

Becoming MySpace Member 
#236,485,972
While we’re writing this book, MySpace is nearing 215 million registered pro-
files. By the time the book hits the shelves, our guess is profile #236,485,972 
will actually have been claimed by an accountant whose home is in the sub-
urbs of Truth Or Consequences, New Mexico, whose favorite movies are A 
League of Their Own and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, whose favorite 
music includes Elvis Presley and U2, and who joined MySpace for friends and 
networking. So your number might be higher than that.
No matter how many people signed up before or after you, you’ll go through 
the same enrollment process as the individual users, celebrity users, bands, 
filmmakers, and everyone else who has staked a claim in the MySpace world.
To begin your own adventures on MySpace, you need to have a few things:
 
 A computer connected to the Internet. It doesn’t matter if it’s a PC or a 
Mac, or if it’s in your home or office or someplace else. You need to be 
connected to the place where MySpace lives — the World Wide Web.
 
 If you haven’t made your first visit to the Internet and you’re already 
feeling a bit intimidated by the notion of trying out the online world, you 
might want to put this book down and go find a copy of The Internet For 
Dummies, 11th Edition. It’s another fine book from Wiley Publishing that 
covers how to get your PC or Mac ready to go online and how to get con-
nected to the Internet.
 
 An e-mail address. MySpace requires you to have an active e-mail 
address before you can get signed up. The address you provide will be 
the initial destination for communications MySpace sends you, includ-
ing notices when you get new Friend Requests or when someone posts 
a comment on your page. If you don’t have an e-mail account, see the 
sidebar “Getting a free e-mailbox,” later in this chapter, for information 
on getting an e-mailbox.
 
 At least 14 years of life under your belt. MySpace requires you to be at 
least 14 years old to sign up and use the service. Although we admit it’s 
pretty simple to just lie about your age to get an account if you’re under 
14, we also know that MySpace shuts down thousands of pages per day 
for users under 14. Our advice is simple — don’t sign up until you’re old 
enough. And if you find someone using MySpace who’s under 14, report 
them to the site administrators. You can find more about MySpace 
safety and security in Chapter 3.

Name, Rank, Serial Number, 
E-mail Address . . .
Signing up for a MySpace account is a short, painless process requiring very 
basic contact information. Follow these steps to get your MySpace account 
started:
 
1. Go to www.myspace.com.
 
 Type the address in your Web browser’s address box and press Enter 
on your keyboard. You should be sent directly to the MySpace home 
page.
Get ting a free e-mailbox
In this modern, wired world, it seems having an 
e-mail account is about as common as having 
a nose. It’s more rare to find someone without 
one than it is to find someone with one. Still, the 
latest stats indicate that only about 15–20 per-
cent of the total population of the world uses 
the Internet, so there are still plenty of people 
getting online for the first time.
If you’re in that world majority that’s jumping on 
the Internet for the first time, you’re in luck when 
it comes to setting up an e-mail account. Free 
e-mail services are plentiful on the Internet. 
Some of the biggest names in the technology 
world operate free e-mail services, including 
Microsoft, Yahoo!, and Google. These services 
are housed on the Web and are free to use. 
You don’t have to add any special software to 
your computer to get your messages. You can 
even access your account from any computer 
hooked to the Internet anywhere in the world.
When you’re ready to grab an e-mail account, 
check out one of these services:
  Yahoo! Mail: Sign up for a Yahoo! member-
ship and you automatically get an e-mail 
account at the popular Web search and 
services site. Your account can hold 1.0 
gigabyte of information (without getting 
too techy, we’ll just say a gigabyte is more 
space than most average folks need). Your 
account also includes tools for keeping 
junk mail out of your inbox. Visit http://
mail.yahoo.com to sign up.
  Gmail: If you expect to get a lot of e-mail 
that you’ll need to sort through regularly, 
Gmail might be the solution for you. Web 
giant Google operates this service, and they 
offer over 2.0 gigabytes of space per user 
(and are adding to the total constantly). The 
service also provides a unique organiza-
tion system for your messages. Rather than 
simply listing messages in order of receipt 
(the way most e-mail services do), Gmail 
sorts by topic or sender so you can see 
similar messages bunched together.

2. Click the button that reads SIGN UP! in the Member Login box.
 
 You’ll find the SIGN UP! button on the right side of the screen.
 
3. In the JOIN MYSPACE HERE! box, enter the requested information in 
the text boxes.
 
 MySpace requires certain information to start an account, as shown in 
Figure 2-1. Your initial sign-up screen asks for the following:
 
• E-mail Address: Enter the address you’ll use to receive all mes-
sages from MySpace. The e-mail address you enter can’t already be 
in use by another MySpace account.
 
• First Name: This will be the default Display Name for your account. 
The Display Name is the name other users see when they visit your 
profile page. You can change your Display Name at any time, so 
don’t worry about your real first name causing any privacy issues. 
For more on changing your display name, see the section “Name,” 
later in this chapter.
What’s wrong with lying about 
my age on MySpace?
When we covered signing up for a MySpace 
profile, we mentioned it’s okay to enter a false 
date for your birthday. That point is actually only 
partially true.
People lie about their ages for a lot of reasons. 
People over 30 might claim they’re still in their 
20s so they come off as college-aged hipsters. 
We have one friend in her 50s who claims she’s 
39 on MySpace because her business is domi-
nated by younger folks. In cases such as these 
two, telling little white lies about your age on 
MySpace is okay. You’re still a liar, but if you’re 
okay with it, so are we.
There are a couple of specific cases when lying 
about your age on MySpace is not a good thing. 
If you’re under 14 years old and sign up as being 
old enough to use MySpace, you’re in violation of 
MySpace’s terms of agreement and your profile 
will be subject to deletion. Perhaps more note-
worthy, if you’re an adult over 18 and you claim 
you’re under 18 in order to make closer contact 
with users under 18, you’re not only in violation of 
MySpace’s terms of agreement, you might also 
be subject to arrest and prosecution depending 
on the nature of your communication.
If you discover any other users who are violat-
ing MySpace’s terms of agreements by lying 
about their age, contact MySpace’s customer 
service to report those users. (You can find 
more information on how to file such a report 
in Chapter 3.) If you discover one or two folks 
telling a little white lie about their age just to 
fight the effects of Father Time, do them a favor 
and keep their little lie a secret (it might come in 
handy as blackmail later on down the road).

27
 Chapter 2: Enlisting in the MySpace Army
 
• Last Name: Similar to your first name, this doesn’t have to be your 
actual name.
 
• Password: This is the password you’ll use to keep other people 
from accessing your MySpace account. MySpace requires you to 
use at least one nonletter character in your password.
 
 The best passwords are words or codes that aren’t easily guessed 
by others. One good way to create a password that’s not simple 
to figure out is to use a word or words that are easy for you to 
remember, but replace certain letters with numbers. In this plan, 
OpenSesame could easily become 0p3nSe5ame and keep anyone 
trying to guess your password confused. (Of course, now that 
we’ve already put that sample password in front of every reader of 
this book, it wouldn’t be a good one to use. But you knew that.)
 
• Confirm Password: Retype the password you just typed in the pre-
vious box to confirm there are no typos in the initial entry.
 
• Country: This drop-down list lets you select the nation from which 
you’ll be accessing MySpace most of the time. It’s like your choices 
with the names — if you prefer to stay anonymous, you can select 
a country other than the place of your residence.
 
 Do note, however, that whatever country you select will appear in 
your profile. Choosing a country other than your own might result 
in visits from users looking for other users residing in your country 
of choice, so choose wisely.

Part I: MySpace Overview and Basics 
 
• Postal Code: Type in the postal code associated with your home 
address. In the United States, the postal code is more commonly 
known as the ZIP code. Again, if you want to remain somewhat anon-
ymous on MySpace, the sign-up page will accept “00001” as a postal 
code even though the number isn’t associated with a real place.
 
• Date of Birth: Enter the month, day, and year of your birth. As 
with most of the other fields, MySpace can’t verify your birth date, 
so you’re free to enter a false date if you want to keep your actual 
date of birth private. For some reason, you can’t be older than 
100 years old when signing in. We’re not sure what MySpace has 
against centenarians, but thus far there hasn’t been a big enough 
groundswell to warrant changing it.
 
• Gender: You have a choice of two: male or female. Do us all a favor 
and don’t be a creep. Click Female if you’re a female and Male if 
you’re a male. If you’re uncertain, please figure it out prior to creat-
ing a profile.
 
• Allow Others to See When It’s My Birthday check box: You can 
keep this option checked if you want your friends to be able to see 
when your birthday is. This is checked by default.
 
 If you want to share your birthday with your friends after you’ve 
added a few to your profile page, keep the Allow Others to See 
When It’s My Birthday check box checked. If you want to keep your 
birthday a secret, be sure to uncheck that box.
 
• Preferred Site & Language: With the popularity of MySpace 
among the English-speaking citizens of the U.S., MySpace has 
begun to expand into other markets and languages. The default 
option is U.S.A., but there are over 20 other language options avail-
able for you to choose from if needed.
 
• Agree to terms and conditions: To complete your sign up, check 
this box that verifies you’ve read MySpace’s Terms of Service and 
Privacy Policy. You can click the links below the box to read either.
 
 If you’re like us, you’ve probably signed up for many Web sites 
and loaded many pieces of software on a computer that required 
you to verify the terms of service before finalizing the process. 
And (also if you’re us) you probably just clicked the button or box 
assuring that you’ve read the terms without actually ever looking 
at a word.
 
 In the case of MySpace, we highly recommend you actually read 
the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy before setting up a profile. 
Both documents are clearly worded without a lot of legal mumbo 
jumbo that usually makes these documents read like a foreign 

29
 Chapter 2: Enlisting in the MySpace Army
language. They also define what you can and can’t do on MySpace, 
as well as what MySpace does with the info they collect from you. 
If you see any part of the Terms or Service or Privacy Policy that 
makes you uncomfortable, we recommend you stop your sign up 
and don’t join MySpace. For a quick rundown of the highlights of 
both, see the sidebar “MySpace rules that make MySpace rule,” 
later in this chapter.
 
4. Click the Sign Up button and verify your account.
 
 MySpace then takes you to a screen where you need to verify your 
account by proving that you’re not a spammer/computer trying to 
create an account. Simply type what you see in the Verification box 
into the text box beneath it. This step verifies that bots, or automated 
programs designed to sign up multiple profiles, can’t do their job on 
MySpace.
 
 The verification code is case-sensitive, so make sure all the capital let-
ters are capitalized and the lowercase letters are lowercase.
After you properly verify your account, you can start uploading photos to 
your profile. We go into detail on how to upload photos to your MySpace pro-
file in Chapter 10. Click the Skip for Now link. You then travel to a page where 
you can invite friends to join. Click the Skip for Now link on that page as well 
to travel to your MySpace home page, as shown in Figure 2-2.

30
Part I: MySpace Overview and Basics 
Showing Off Your Profile
Perhaps even more important than the actual sign up is the process of setting 
your profile preferences, which we cover in this section. Your profile refers to 
all the information about yourself that you make viewable on MySpace. You 
can change or completely erase most of the information in your profile at any 
time. Also, keep in mind that all references, figures, and any other tidbits of 
informational goodness that are talked about in this section are based upon 
the assumption that you are using the New Home Skin for your home page 
layout. Read more about your different home page customization options in 
Chapter 12.
Setting your name and Web address
The best way to start turning your barren new MySpace page into a place 
that best fits your personality is by setting your MySpace Name and URL. 
Your MySpace Name is the name permanently linked to your profile, though 
MySpace rules that make MySpace rule
As with any community, MySpace needs a good 
set of rules to make sure everyone plays nice. 
Without rules, there’s chaos. Considering that 
MySpace is a community with over 200 mil-
lion user profiles ranging from 14-year-olds to 
adults to bands, filmmakers, comedians, and 
politicians, you begin to understand why they 
need a clearly stated set of rules to make sure 
everything operates smoothly.
Verifying that you’ve read MySpace’s Terms of 
Service is part of the sign-up process. Before 
you get started on MySpace, we highly recom-
mend you actually read through the Terms of 
Service to make sure you understand what you 
can and can’t do with your MySpace profile. 
Among the things prohibited by MySpace are
  Content posted to your profile that you own 
or hold copyright on
  Commercial use of MySpace profiles, 
including collecting users’ names or e-mail 
addresses for the purposes of sending 
unsolicited business messages
  Content deemed offensive, racist, harass-
ing, or exploitative
  Content showing nudity or linking to an 
adult-themed Web site
  Content listing individuals’ telephone 
numbers, e-mail addresses, or street 
addresses
  Content deemed false or libelous
  Impersonating another person
Protecting members from people sending 
unwanted business solicitation and junk mail 
is serious to MySpace. In fact, their Terms of 
Service even outline a means by which they can 
fine users $50 per incident when those users are 
in violation of the site’s anti-junk-mail rules.

31
 Chapter 2: Enlisting in the MySpace Army
it doesn’t have to match your Display Name (see the next section). You can 
change your Display Name any time you want, but not your MySpace Name. 
The First Name you entered in the sign-up process (see the previous section) 
is your default MySpace Name until you change it.
 
A URL, short for Uniform Resource Locator, is a fancy name for the Web 
address of your MySpace page. All pages are assigned a temporary URL that 
includes MySpace’s URL followed by your profile number. Your MySpace 
Name replaces your profile number in your URL and it becomes permanent as 
well. Follow these steps to change your name and URL:
 
1. Click the Click Here link in the Pick Your MySpace Name/URL! box on 
your home page.
 
 The box is located in the upper-left part of your page.
 
2. Type your MySpace Name/URL in the boxes under the Pick Your 
MySpace Name/URL section.
 
 You have to type the Name/URL twice to confirm you didn’t make any 
typos.
 
3. Click the Submit button.
 
 A confirmation screen pops up confirming the Name/URL you selected 
and reminds you that you can’t change it. Click OK if you’re satisfied 
with your selection. Click Cancel if you want to make any changes.
 
 Clicking OK will actually take you to another confirmation screen to 
make sure you’re completely satisfied with your name, as shown in 
Figure 2-3. Yes, these MySpace people are quite serious about this “you 
can never change it” business.

Part I: MySpace Overview and Basics 
Who is Tom and why does he think he’s my friend?
The first time you see your new MySpace pro-
file, you notice that you already have a friend 
you probably didn’t know you ever had. His 
name is Tom, and he has a big job. He’s every-
body’s first MySpace friend.
When you join MySpace, you walk into a room 
that’s already filled with over 200 million other 
users. Would you want to walk into a room 
packed like that in real life without a buddy by 
your side? In the MySpace world, think of Tom 
as that buddy. Always smiling, giving you a per-
petual thumbs up, Tom is the kind of guy that 
looks like he’ll stick by you in the wild world of 
MySpace. Of course, you’re new to MySpace 
and are probably wondering “Who is this Tom 
guy, anyway?”
Tom is actually Tom Anderson, one of the co-
founders of the site and the current President of 
MySpace. Legend has it that Tom was in a band 
when he began thinking of ways to spin the 
budding world of online social networking in a 
direction that could help musicians. MySpace’s 
musician-friendly roots sprang from that idea, 
and the site took off.
Nowadays, Tom is the spokesperson for 
MySpace and is also probably one of the 
most recognizable people in today’s pop cul-
ture. Whenever an unfounded rumor about 
MySpace begins to spread, Tom sends out a 
message to squelch it. When MySpace’s tech-
nology starts going haywire, Tom shows up to 
calm fears. He’s your good buddy who wants to 
make sure everything works okay for you while 
you’re making your way through MySpace. 
Tom Anderson’s MySpace profile (shown in 
the figure below) at www.myspace.com/
tom provides a good source of updated info 
about the site.

 Chapter 2: Enlisting in the MySpace Army
 
Your next stop is a confirmation screen noting your MySpace Name/URL. At 
this point, you have the option to re-enter your real first name and last name 
if you want them associated with your profile. Though your real first and last 
names are never displayed on your profile page unless you use them in your 
profile name, entering them will bring up your profile if another MySpace user 
does a search on your real name. If you’d prefer to not associate your real 
name with your profile, you can simply skip this step by clicking the Skip link.
Answering the question “Who does 
this person think he is?”
Everyone has a different goal in mind when they sign up for MySpace. If 
you’re interested in expanding your social network and meeting new people, 
you probably want to include a lot of information about yourself to better 
link up with like-minded users. If you’re primarily interested in keeping in 
contact with a small circle of friends you already know, it’s not as important 
to include a lot of personal info.
MySpace makes it very easy to add, erase, or change your profile information 
whenever you want. Simply go to your home page and click the Edit Profile 
link in the top-left corner of your home page, as shown in Figure 2-4. The link 
takes you to the Profile Edit page. The Personal Info tab on the Profile Edit 
page is divided into eight separate screens you can select to edit different 
parts of your profile. We discuss these eight screens in the sections below.

Interests & Personality
The Interests & Personality section, shown in Figure 2-5, allows you to enter 
information about your personal interests as well as the reasons why you’re 
using MySpace. All the information you enter on this page appears on your 
main MySpace page.
 
Figure 2-5: 
The Profile 
Edit page 
includes 
links to all 
the pages 
where you 
can make 
changes to 
your profile 
settings.
 
The categories in the Interests & Personality section include
 
 Headline: The Headline is a brief sentence meant to sum up you or your 
profile. Think of it as the hook that pulls viewers deeper into your pro-
file. Our recommendation is to keep your headline brief and general. Let 
the rest of your profile do the talking about your personality.
 
 About Me: Your About Me space allows you to tell the world anything 
you want about yourself. We’ve seen MySpace profiles use this space 
to add more detail to the basic profile information — say, a laundry list 
of likes and dislikes — or as a place to put a favorite quote from a phi-
losopher or as a mini-diary to update what’s going on in their immediate 
lives. What you put in the About Me box is limited only by your own 
creativity.
 
 I’d Like To Meet: This box lets you define specifically who you want con-
tacting you on MySpace. This space is a great opportunity to really define 
your reasons for being on MySpace. If you want to expand your profes-
sional network, list your specific occupation. If you’re looking to meet 
people who share a specific hobby or interest in a certain geographical 
area, you can put in a specific request, such as “New Yorkers addicted to 
the TV show Lost.” The more specific you are, the more likely you are to 
be contacted by the type of people you want to meet on MySpace.

 Chapter 2: Enlisting in the MySpace Army
 
 Interests: This box is a great place to list your hobbies, academic pur-
suits, sports you play, or other pastimes that define your life.
 
 Music: What is the soundtrack of your life? Let other MySpacers know 
what tunes get you through the day. Feel free to list band names, album 
titles, song titles, or genres of music you like or don’t like.
 
 Movies: Do you have a favorite movie you can quote line for line? List it 
in this box so other fans of the film know you’re on MySpace.
 
 Television: When you get finished with a hard day at school or at the 
office, do you like to kick back and watch reruns of The Simpsons (the 
way we do)? Share your favorite shows in this space and let the world 
know what your viewing habits are.
 
 Books: Other than MySpace For Dummies, have you read any good books 
lately? Let your friends know what they should be reading by listing 
your favorites here.
 
 Heroes: Who do you look up to as a personal hero? A politician? A pro-
fessional athlete? Your parents? Let the MySpace universe know what 
you aspire to be by sharing the names of the people who inspire you.
All the items you entered in these fields are automatically displayed as click-
able links on your MySpace profile page. Clicking the entries on a profile page 
takes you to a MySpace search page associated with the words you clicked. 
For example, if you list MySpace For Dummies as one of your favorite books, 
the words “MySpace For Dummies” will generate a link in your profile. When 
you or someone else clicks that link, your browser goes to a MySpace search 
page that shows other user profiles that include mentions of MySpace For 
Dummies along with advertising links. If you want to turn these links off in 
your profile, type <Z> anywhere in the text box of the particular category in 
which you want to disable links and the links will be instantly turned off.
 
When you’ve entered all the information you wish to share, click the Save 
All Changes button at the bottom of the page to place your interests on your 
profile page. If you want to see what the page will look like before you save it, 
click the Preview Profile button found throughout the page. You can also click 
the Preview Selection button under any of the text boxes to get a look at that 
specific section.
 
Unfortunately, telling people a little about yourself can also pull in attention 
from unwanted would-be friends or general annoyances. Using certain buzz 
words like sexy and single can attract attention from users looking for dates or 
adult chat. Listing political party affiliations or even certain sports teams can 
pull in people looking for an argument. Always consider all the reactions you 
might get from what you add to your profile before you post it. Remember, 
if you have a public profile, what you put on MySpace can be seen by family 
members, colleagues, and complete strangers. Make sure you’re sharing only 
information you’re comfortable with all these people knowing.

36
Part I: MySpace Overview and Basics 
 
The good thing is all parts of your profile can be changed at any time. Simply 
return to the Edit Profile link on your home page and you can change what 
you choose to share. Don’t be afraid to tinker with the information on your 
MySpace page as often as you want to make sure you hear from the people 
you want to hear from and keep the jerks out.
Name
Click the Name link at the top of the Profile Edit page to make two major 
changes to your profile.
 
 Display Name: This is the name that appears at the top of your MySpace 
page. It’s also the name that other users see when they encounter your 
profile link when you appear in other users’ friend spaces, when you 
send messages, or when you post bulletins. Display names range from 
the simple to the silly. Most users prefer to keep it to the name or nick-
name they’re typically known by.
 
 We’ve noticed a lot of younger users mixing up capital and small letters 
with other elements for their display name. After all, they figure, why be 
Ashley when you can be aSh7Ey!!!? We personally don’t recommend 
that approach if you’re over 18 because, well, it’s pretty silly and comes 
across as kid stuff . . . which is fine . . . for the kids.
 
 First Name/Last Name: Back when you established your permanent and 
unique MySpace Name/URL, you had the option to include your real first 
name and last name so you could be found in MySpace searches. This 
option allows you to add your first name and last name if you skipped 
the step when setting up your URL, or to change or erase your name if 
you prefer.
Basic Info
Click the Basic Info link to fill in specifics about your occupation, ethnicity, 
body type, height, and the reason you use MySpace. On your first visit to this 
page, you’ll notice that MySpace included your gender, birth date, country, 
and postal code information you entered when you signed up. They even 
turned your postal code into the actual city and state or region the code is 
associated with. Feel free to change or erase these automatically filled fields 
if you wish.
 
How you fill out the I Am Here For field can be an important decision that 
determines what type of user contacts you. If you choose only the Friends and 
Networking check box, you’re less likely to get people cruising MySpace for 
some adult action than if you also check Dating and Serious Relationships. Our 
completely unscientific research has indicated that users who do not check 
Dating and Serious Relationship are less likely to get unwanted propositions 
than those who choose to check those boxes.

37
 Chapter 2: Enlisting in the MySpace Army
Background & Lifestyle
This set of choices allows you to share your marital status, sexual orientation, 
hometown, religion, education level, and income with other MySpacers. You can 
also include if you smoke, drink, or want to have children someday. You can fill 
in each of the fields with the answers they recommend, choose to leave the field 
blank, or select No Answer.
 
How you choose to fill in the Marital Status field can help determine the type 
of user that contacts you on MySpace. Once again, our completely unscientific 
research based on chatting with hundreds of MySpace users has revealed 
that users who select the Swinger or Single option are more likely to get 
unwanted propositions than those who select Married or In a Relationship. In 
fact, we know single people who have switched their status to Married or In a 
Relationship to curtail unwanted advances.
Schools
Adding the names of the schools you attended to your profile is an easy way 
to find and make contact with other MySpace users who attended the same 
schools as you. Clicking the Schools link at the top of the Profile Edit page 
takes you to a search screen where you can find a high school, college or uni-
versity, or trade school you attended, as shown in Figure 2-6.
 
Figure 2-6:

38
Part I: MySpace Overview and Basics 
To add a school to your profile:
 
1. Enter the name of the school you want to search for along with the 
country and state or province in which it’s located and click Search.
 
 MySpace automatically generates a list of all the schools in the system 
that match the name of your school.
 
2. Click the link on the name of the school you attended.
 
 If you can’t find the name of your school on the list, scroll to the bottom 
of the page and select the city where your school was located from the 
scrolling menu next to the word City and click Select again.
 
 If your school doesn’t appear after the second search, click the Submit 
Your School link at the bottom of the page to send information about 
your alma mater to MySpace for consideration to add to the list of 
schools.
 
3. Enter the information in the text boxes and click Submit to add to 
your profile.
 
 MySpace gives you room to enter the school name, location, status (cur-
rent student or alumni), dates attended, year graduated, degree type, 
major/concentration, minor, and if you were affiliated with any Greek 
letter organizations or other clubs. The more info you enter, the more 
likely your fellow students or alumni can track you down on MySpace.
Companies
You can add the companies you work for currently or worked for in the past 
to your profile. Click the Companies link at the top of the Profile Edit page. 
You can enter the company’s name, city, state/region, and country, as well as 
your title, the division you worked in, and the dates you were employed.
Networking
MySpace provides an online venue for networking with people either in your 
profession or in a field you’re interested in. Click the Networking profile at 
the top of the Profile Edit page to add networking information to your profile. 
MySpace provides drop-down lists where you can select the field, subfield, 
and role that you want to network in. You can also add a description of what 
specific field, business, or position you’re looking for.
 
The selection in the Field category is pretty limited. When we were finishing 
this chapter, there were only 14 fields to choose from. All the fields were in 
either the arts, media, or technology world. Until MySpace expands on these 
offerings, you’re out of luck if you’re a doctor, lawyer, or teacher looking to 
network with others in your field.

 Chapter 2: Enlisting in the MySpace Army
Song & Video
MySpace is probably the most music friendly of all the social-networking 
sites. Bands can load their music on their sites for fans to listen to or down-
load. Users can even include single songs on their profiles. If you hear a song 
on MySpace you want to add to your profile, simply click the Add link associ-
ated with the song. Also, there’s no need to worry about breaking any music 
copyright laws that we’re sure you’ve heard about on the news — adding 
songs to your profile is about as legitimate as it gets. You can find more infor-
mation on finding friends in Chapter 4 and information about setting up band 
profiles and uploading your own songs in Chapter 14.
Although music is probably the most popular form of media on MySpace, 
video is definitely second and getting closer by the day, well that is if 
MySpace has anything to do with it. With just a click of your mouse, you 
can add one of your videos or any other video that a fellow MySpacer has 
uploaded onto your My Video Space of your profile. You can also add a pro-
file video slider that showcases your uploaded videos to those who stop by 
your profile. Sound cool? Check out Chapter 11 to find out more information 
on all things MySpace video.
After you feel comfortable with all the information that you’ve entered into 
your profile, click the View My Profile link in the upper-right corner of your 
Profile Edit page to take a look at what everyone will see when they stop by. 
Your profile page, as shown in Figure 2-7, is now filled with all the information 
you entered. It was totally worth the time, right?

Making Account Changes
Change is inevitable in life. Okay, some people seem to make MySpace their 
life — and we suppose change is inevitable on a MySpace account as well. 
Fortunately, MySpace makes it easy to get under the hood of your account 
and make changes that effect how it operates for you, as well as for the users 
who encounter your page.
 
You make changes to how your MySpace page operates on the Settings: 
Account page. You can reach this page off your MySpace home page. Click the 
Settings button in the Control Panel box on the left side of the screen, under 
your profile picture, and you’re whisked to the Settings: Account page (as 
shown in Figure 2-8) where you can tinker with your page.
 
Figure 2-8: 
The 
Settings: 
Account 
page.
 
Here are a number of the links for settings you can change from this page:
 
 Account: You can alter the e-mail account associated with your page. 
Simply enter the name of the account you want to use and click the Save 
Changes button in that section. You can change your Account Settings 
(your Preferred Site & Language, the Time Zone) and even cancel your 
account in the Account Cancellation section.
 
 Password: Click the Password link to access the Settings: Password 
screen and change your password. You’re required to enter your cur-
rent password and new password, as well as a verification code pre-
sented in the same format as the one you entered when you initially 
signed up.

41
 Chapter 2: Enlisting in the MySpace Army
 
 Privacy: In order to protect MySpace users who wish to keep their pro-
files limited to friends only, MySpace has added a number of privacy 
controls designed to limit who can see or comment on your site. Click 
the Privacy link to reach controls that allow you to
 
• Hide your online status
 
• Block your birthday from friends
 
• Only allow friends to view your full profile
 
• Block picture forwarding from your account
 
• Block users under the age of 18 from contacting you
 
 Spam: As MySpace has gotten bigger and bigger, the amount of spam-
mers that it attracts has grown as well. To help you keep your MySpace 
experience as spam-free as possible, there are some tools built specifi-
cally for keeping the unwanted away from your profile. You can manage 
your spam settings with these options:
 
• Spam presets of Low, Medium, High, and Custom (the Communication 
Settings change based on the Spam Preset Level).
 
• Decide whether you want non-friends to be able to send you mes-
sages (they can by default). You can also require non-friends to 
fill out a visual CAPTCHA as an additional way to know that they 
aren’t a spammer.
 
• Require other MySpace users to know either your last name or 
e-mail before they can send you a Friend Request. You can also 
require a visual CAPTCHA, which verifies that they aren’t a spam-
mer bot.
 
• Block all bands, comedians, and filmmakers from sending you 
Friend Requests.
 
• Request approval for all comments left on your profile or request 
a visual CAPTCHA before they can post. You can also decide if 
you only want your friends to have the ability to comment on your 
blogs.
 
• Block Group Invitations from Groups.
 
• Block Event Invitations from non-friends, bands, comedians, and 
filmmakers.
 
• Block IM Requests from non-friends (non-friends can request by 
default).
 
 Privacy and Spam settings are covered in more detail in Chapter 3.

42
Part I: MySpace Overview and Basics 
 
 Notifications: Decide whether you want newsletters and e-mail notifica-
tions sent to you from MySpace when different actions occur, such as 
receiving a message or comment from another MySpacer.
 
 Skip to Chapter 3 to find more information about safety strategies and 
the available privacy settings on MySpace.
 
 Mobile: In a nod to the wireless world, MySpace will now send text mes-
sages to your mobile phone when you get a new Friend Request, mes-
sage, or event invite, or when you get a comment on your profile, blog, 
or image. There are also mobile content subscriptions available via your 
cell phone. Check out Chapter 7 for more on how MySpace works with 
your wireless device.
 
 Calendar: Click the Calendar link to alter the default view of your cal-
endar, set sharing filters, set the day the week begins on, change time 
intervals, set working hours, and establish reminder settings. For a more 
detailed discussion of the calendar, jump to Chapter 8.
 
 Miscellaneous: There are various other settings that you might want to 
take a look at as well. These settings include
 
• Profile: This control allows you to display the MySpace Groups 
you belong to as well as disable the use of HTML in profile, image, 
and blog comments. The HTML controls are handy if you want to 
keep other users from dropping audio, video, or image files onto 
your MySpace page. You can get more info on dealing with com-
ments in Chapter 5. Clicking the Reset link next to Profile Views 
sets your counter displaying the number of times your profile has 
been viewed back to zero.
 
• Music Players: Adding music to your MySpace page is a nice 
touch. Unfortunately, not everyone is a fan of a song suddenly blar-
ing at them as they bop around the Web. This control allows you 
to keep songs on both your profile and other users’ profiles from 
automatically starting when you pay their pages a visit.
 
• Away Message: This control allows you to set a message that will 
automatically be sent to other users who send you messages while 
you’re away from MySpace for an extended period.
After you march your way through this list of decisions and options, you’re 
officially a part of the MySpace universe. As you might expect, this initial cre-
ation is only the beginning of the fun.

Chapter 3
Staying Safe on MySpace
In This Chapter
 Understanding what being safe on MySpace really means
 Knowing the potential dangers of MySpace
 Setting up a private profile
 Using MySpace tools to safely control your space
 Blocking the unwanted members of MySpace
 Alerting MySpace about safety and abuse issues
L
et’s be honest — we share this world with a lot of dangerous individu-
als who eat, work, drive cars, go to the mall, and use computers just like 
us. Although it’d be great if we didn’t have to worry about sinister strangers, 
the truth is that by paying attention and being educated and aware, it’s much 
easier to stay safe.
Many people are afraid of things they don’t understand — so if you’re read-
ing this book for yourself (or if you’re hoping to figure out enough to catch 
up to your kids), you deserve a pat on the back for taking the initiative. After 
all, we’re careful to teach our kids not to take candy from strangers and how 
to cross the street; keeping them safe in today’s constantly connected online 
environment is every bit as important. For millions of people, MySpace has 
moved from being just another technology to an integral part of their day-to-
day lifestyle.
In this chapter, you read about many tips that will help keep you safe in 
MySpace. More important than any technical specifics, however, are the big 
ideas — use common sense and remember what MySpace is and what it is 
not. As with any social gathering spot, there are people who aren’t in your 
best interest to befriend — keep an eye out and be careful. You wouldn’t 
hand out your phone number, address, or daily schedule to everyone you 
meet on the street (or even at the library), so don’t do it here.
Enjoy all that MySpace has to offer. Hang out with friends. Make some new 
ones. Just be safe while you’re doing it!

Part I: MySpace Overview and Basics 
Having a Private Profile on MySpace
As the name MySpace states, this is your space. This means you can, within 
reason, essentially add anything you want to your profile page. You have a 
great deal of freedom when you’re creating your profile, which is one of the 
main reasons why MySpace is so popular. But with freedom comes respon-
sibility, and at some point the line needs to be drawn when you’re deciding 
what type of information (particularly personal information) you openly pub-
lish for the masses.
Determining who can see what — that’s actually a big deal when you under-
stand that there are potentially millions of people who can read your profile. 
MySpace realized this, and for this reason, you can have a private profile. A 
private profile allows you to limit who can view your profile information; you 
can narrow it down to only the individuals listed in your Friend List. Then 
anybody you haven’t added as a friend has no way to view your info — it’s 
just that simple.
When you make your page private, any non-friends who come to your page 
can only see your profile picture, basic information (age, location, and so on), 
and your Contact box. Also, in the place of your other personal info, a mes-
sage appears: This profile is set to private. This user must 
add you as a friend to see his/her profile. Figure 3-1 shows 
what this looks like.
 
Figure 3-1: 
A private 
profile 
restricts any 
non-friend 
from seeing 
most of your 
personal 
MySpace 
information.
 
So, why would you want a private profile — and what happens if you decide 
to go private? Here’s a list of points that help answer these questions; it also 
tells you what you need to know about private profiles in general:

45
 Chapter 3: Staying Safe on MySpace
 
 A profile is publicly viewable by default: When you first register on 
MySpace, a majority of your profile can potentially be viewed by anyone 
with Internet access, not just registered MySpacers. While adding your 
information to your profile page, keep in mind that what you post can 
be viewed by friends, family, co-workers, and anyone else who might 
stumble upon your MySpace page while surfing the Web.
 
 A private profile offers automatic protection for young MySpacers: 
One of the things that MySpace takes very seriously is protecting 
younger users. To begin with, no one under the age of 14 is technically 
allowed to register on MySpace, but there’s no real way to enforce 
this rule. And, by default, any MySpace user who is older than 14 but 
younger than 18 is given a private profile.
 
 Granting full profile access to only your friends is a smart idea: 
Although MySpace gives you the ability to meet all kinds of new people 
from around the world, you might decide that you only want to interact 
with people whom you already know and are friends with outside the 
MySpace realm. By creating a private profile, you can allow only those 
you’re already friends with to see the information that you add to your 
space. If you become friends with someone new and want to let them 
see your full profile, simply add them to your MySpace Friend List.
 
 Flexibility of profile settings gives you control: Nothing that you 
change in your settings, such as making your profile private, is perma-
nent. If for some reason you want to open back up to anyone and every-
one on the Internet, you’re just a few clicks away. And if you try it and 
don’t like being open to everyone on the Internet, you always have the 
ability to change back.
If you decide that you want to make your MySpace profile private, follow 
these steps:
 
1. After you log in, click the Edit Profile link that can be found directly 
under the welcome message.
 
 This takes you to the main Profile Edit window where you can click the 
Account Settings link on the top-right side of the page. You’re now at 
the Settings: Account window, as shown in Figure 3-2, where you can 
manage all things related to your profile’s general info, security settings, 
and privacy options.
 
2. Click the Privacy link.
 
 This opens the Settings: Privacy window, which has several controls 
that allow you to change the various privacy settings.
 
3. In the Settings: Privacy window, scroll down until you see the Profile 
Viewable By options.

46

Figure 3-2: 
The 
Settings:

window is 
the place 
to go for all 
settings that 
deal with 
safety and 
privacy.
 
 
4. In the Profile Viewable By options, select the My Friends Only radio 
button (as shown in Figure 3-3).
 
 By default, MySpace will have your profile viewable to the public if 
you’re 18 years old or above. This means that anyone, not just other 
MySpacers, can view most of your profile information at any given time. 
To set your profile to private mode, change the selection from Everyone 
to the My Friends Only option.

 Select this option

47
 Chapter 3: Staying Safe on MySpace
 
5. Click the Save All Changes button.
 
 After you select the My Friends Only option, there’s only one thing left 
to do — save your new privacy settings. This is done by (you guessed 
it) clicking the Save All Changes button at the bottom of the Settings: 
Privacy window. After you click the Save All Changes button, a message 
appears above the Privacy Settings box, letting you know that your pri-
vacy settings have been updated. (I bet you feel safer already.)
With your profile set to private, non-MySpacers can’t view your profile at all, 
and you’ll have to add any registered MySpacers to your Friend List before 
they can view your full MySpace profile.
 
Although you may feel a little safer now that your profile is set to private, 
remember that some of the fun and power of MySpace is allowing people from 
anywhere and everywhere to view what you have to offer. Having a private 
profile makes a curious visitor jump through some hoops to check out your 
information, which might make some impatient people give up. If you’re using 
your MySpace profile to promote and expose your professional self (or your 
organization) for marketing purposes, you might want to think twice before 
making the switch to a private profile.
In addition to the option of setting your profile to Private (the Profile 
Viewable By option), the Settings: Privacy window allows you to make these 
additional privacy settings:
 
 Online Now: If you don’t want others to know when you’re logged in and 
when you’re not, select this check box and the Online Now image won’t 
show up next time you log in. This option is unchecked by default.
 
 Birthday: When you first register on MySpace, you’re asked for your 
date of birth. If you select this check box, your friends will be alerted 
when your birthday is getting close. As a user, you may find this a very 
handy way to keep up with your friends’ birthdays, which aren’t always 
easy to remember. This option is unchecked by default.
 
 Photos: When selected, this option restricts other users on MySpace 
from using the Email to a Friend links under each of your pictures to 
forward your pictures to other individuals. This option is unchecked by 
default.
 
 Block Users by Age: If you want to allow MySpace members under the 
age of 18 to be able to contact you, then you can keep this check box 
selected, which it is by default. If this box is deselected, only those 
MySpacers who are 18 or older can message you.

Part I: MySpace Overview and Basics 
Additional Privacy Settings
As you read in the previous section, there’s a big difference between a public 
profile and a private profile on MySpace. Whether you decide to make your 
own profile private is up to you, but before you make the decision, you 
should know that there are a few other ways that MySpace allows you to con-
trol your account’s privacy settings. By knowing what each of these options 
are, you can make sure you feel safe and comfortable in the sometimes-over-
whelming world of MySpace.
 
The privacy options discussed in the following sections are found in your 
Settings: Account window, which can be accessed by clicking the Settings link 
located in the Control Panel box of your profile’s home page.
The Settings: Spam window
The Settings: Spam window is opened by clicking the Spam link when you’re 
on the main Settings: Account window. When you arrive at the Settings: Spam 
window, you see a list of check boxes (as shown in Figure 3-4); these turn cer-
tain MySpace spam options on and off.
 
Figure 3-4: 
The 
Settings: 
Spam 
window 
has several 
options 
that can be 
managed 
depending 
on your 
needs.
 

49
 Chapter 3: Staying Safe on MySpace
Here’s a breakdown of what actually happens when you change some of 
these options:
 
 Spam Presets slider: This is a sliding scale of predetermined spam set-
tings that can go from Low to High to Custom, depending on how tight 
you want your profile’s spam protection to be. This is a quick and easy 
way to tighten up your profile’s security and it will show you what 
options are turned on and off with each slide of the scale, as you slide it. 
This makes it easy to see what you’re shutting off and what’s still open 
game as far as your profile goes.
 
 Messages: The Allow Non-Friends to Send Me Messages option can be 
turned on or off depending on whether you want complete MySpace 
strangers (non-friends) to be able to message you. Making it so that only 
friends can message you is definitely safer, but it’ll also make it harder 
for those who may want to send you a random message to get in touch 
with you via your MySpace profile. There’s also a CAPTCHA option, 
which requires non-friends to enter a random code before they can 
message you. This option tries to make sure that the message isn’t from 
a spammer, but once again it could make it more difficult for the new 
people who are legitimately trying to contact you.
 
 Friend Requests: These options add an additional layer of security as 
far as friending is concerned. Whoever wants to send you a Friend 
Request will be prompted to fill in either your last name or your e-mail 
address — which basically means you won’t be receiving Friend Requests 
from complete strangers. This option is unchecked by default. There’s 
also an option to require all friend requesters to enter a CAPTCHA code 
before requesting your MySpace friendship. Getting bombarded with 
Friend Requests by comedians, filmmakers, and bands? Well, there’s also 
a way to block them from friend-requesting you.
 
 Comments: In the MySpace world, the content displayed on your page 
isn’t always posted by you. A very popular example of this is the Profile 
Comment, used regularly to communicate with fellow MySpacers. You 
can require all comments to be approved by you before they’re posted 
to your profile. The CAPTCHA option is available on this setting as well, 
just in case you want to tighten up your security even more. Also, if you 
want to limit your potential blog comments to friends only, that option 
is available to you.
 
 Even though someone must be your official friend before posting a pro-
file comment on your page, that doesn’t mean you’ll always like what 
that person ends up posting. This option adds another layer of privacy 
and security by allowing you to approve comments before they show up 
on your profile page. This option is unchecked by default.

Part I: MySpace Overview and Basics 
 
 Group Invitations: MySpace groups are being created every single day — 
hordes of them — all looking for potential members. By default, the mod-
erators of these groups can invite any other MySpace user to join their 
groups; all they need is your e-mail address. If you want only your friends 
to be able to use this option to invite you to groups, check the Allow Only 
My Friends option (this option is unchecked by default). You can also 
block all group invitations or any group invitations from bands, comedi-
ans, and filmmakers just in case they start to get on your nerves.
 
 Event Invitations: Many, many MySpacers post events on MySpace as a 
way to let others around them know what’s happening on a day-to-day 
basis. Although it’s great to stay in the loop on some of these events, 
you may find that you’re getting overwhelmed with invite after invite 
to events that you could care less about. If you feel like you need to 
manage your incoming invitations, this is where you can do it. You have 
the option of limiting your incoming invitations to only those that are 
coming from your friends, comedians, bands, regular MySpace users, 
and Filmmakers so you’re only getting the invitations that you want to 
know about. Don’t feel like getting any invitations? There’s an option for 
that too, and don’t be afraid to use it.
 
 IM Invitations: If you want non-friends to be able to invite you to an IM 
(Instant Messaging) conversation, you can keep this option checked, 
which is the case by default.
As you just read, the Settings: Spam window allows you to really tighten 
down your MySpace account options. You may or may not have noticed that 
most of these options are left unchecked by default. That means MySpace 
doesn’t put very many automatic restrictions on your account. If you want 
more control than you already have, you have to be proactive about it and 
change it yourself.
Blocking the unwanted 
members of MySpace
You know that creepy guy who keeps trying to talk to you, even after you’ve 
made it blaringly clear that you have absolutely no interest in his job, his car, 
his hobbies, his medical condition, or anything else that he might have to 
say? Well, not only does he have a profile on MySpace, but so do all his simi-
larly creepy friends. And so does the guy who leaves fliers on your car in the 
parking lot.
The point is, just as in real life, there are people on MySpace who will stop at 
nothing to annoy and irritate you. Thankfully, this is one of those instances 
where the online world may well provide better solutions than real life. 

51
 Chapter 3: Staying Safe on MySpace
Although there’s no way to reach through your monitor to slap, punch, or 
scream at someone (no matter how much they might deserve it), there are 
ways to keep them at bay — blocking them.
Blocking a user means that person can no longer contact you at all through 
MySpace. That means he or she can’t comment your page — or send you any 
message that you actually receive. If you block users who are in your Friend 
List, they’re removed. If they send out a bulletin, it won’t show up in your 
Bulletin Space. Blocked means blocked out — they’ll be cut off completely 
from communicating with you via MySpace. And don’t worry — other users 
don’t know when you block them; they have no idea what blocked lists they 
are on. All they might notice (if they get a clue) is that you aren’t answering. 
So by all means, block away!
 
If you block someone, that person can still view your profile unless you have 
it set to private (see the section “Having a Private Profile on MySpace,” earlier 
in this chapter). If the blocked person creates a different account on MySpace, 
he or she can use the new account to contact you — and if that happens, just 
block the new account as well.
So why would you want to block a fellow MySpacer? Here are a few reasons 
that might potentially land someone in your Blocked Users list:
 
 Annoying: Let’s face it, some people are just annoying. There are lots 
of reasons why they’re annoying — and if someone gets on your nerves 
just one time too many, blocking them might be a valid option.
 
 Did they really just say/show that?: People say and do some “interest-
ing” things on MySpace, and one day someone might cross the line from 
funny to just downright disgusting. If you aren’t amused with that once-
entertaining user anymore and wouldn’t mind if you never heard a thing 
from that direction again, get your block on. You won’t hurt their feel-
ings, we promise.
 
 Blind date gone badly: You go on a date with a potential significant 
other and now you have someone messaging you 50 times a day to tell 
you how awesome you are. Creep potential aside, a person can only take 
so many compliments in one day . . . block!
 
 Attack of the MySpace spammer: Every now and then you might get a 
few messages from users telling you to check out their Webcams or from 
a band from across the nation telling you how awesome its new CD is 
and why you should buy it. These types of MySpace spammers would 
look great hanging out together in your Blocked Users list.
Adding a user to your Blocked Users list
Feel like you’ve come to the point where you need to make room for someone 
on your almighty Blocked Users list? Follow these steps to make sure you 
don’t have to deal with that not-so-special someone on MySpace ever again:

52
Part I: MySpace Overview and Basics 
 
1. Go to the MySpace profile of the person you want to block.
 
 The only place to block a user is directly from their profile.
 
 You can block a user even if they have their profile set to private.
 
2. Locate the Block User link in the user’s Contact box.
 
 After you find the profile of the user you want to block, locate her Block 
User link. It’s located in the user’s Contact box on her profile page, as 
shown in Figure 3-5.
 
Figure 3-5: 
The Block 
User link is 
located in 
the Contact 
box on 
any user’s 
profile page.
 
The Block User link
 
3. Click the Block User link.
 
4. Confirm that you want to block the user.
 
 MySpace usually likes to make sure that you want to do certain things 
before it does them; blocking another user is a typical example. After 
you click the Block User link, MySpace will ask you, Are you sure 
you want to block this user? If you do, click OK.
 
5. Confirm the blocked user . . . again.
 
 Even after you click OK for the prompt in the previous step, you’re taken 
to one more confirmation page, as shown in Figure 3-6. MySpace will ask 
you once more, Are you sure? If you still want to go through with it, 
click the OK button, and the user will be officially blocked. Refreshing 
and oh-so-powerful at the same time, huh?

you to make

to block the 
user. 
Managing and unblocking your blocked users
After you finish blocking someone (see the previous section), he shows up in 
your Blocked Users list. Just like the other settings covered in the previous 
sections, the Blocked Users list is found in the Settings: Account window. 
Your Blocked Users list is where you can see the users you’ve blocked, and 
it’s also where you can unblock them if you ever feel the need to do so. 
Follow these steps to check out your Blocked Users list:
 
1. After you log in, click the Edit Profile link below the greeting on your 
profile’s home page.
 
 This takes you to the Profile Edit window where you can then click the 
Account Settings link in the upper-right corner of the page.
 
2. In the Settings: Account window, click the Privacy link.
 
 This takes you to the Settings: Privacy window, where the Blocked Users 
list can be accessed.
 
3. Click the View List link in the Blocked Users section.
 
 When you click the View List link, you’re taken to the Blocked Users 
window, as shown in Figure 3-7, where all blocked users are listed.
 
4. To unblock a user, click the Unblock User link.
 
 All the user profiles you’ve blocked appear in the Blocked Users 
window. Feeling nice (or has somebody decided to behave)? You can 
unblock a user by clicking the Unblock User link to the right of the user’s 
profile picture; that user is instantly able to contact you again. Almost 
too easy, isn’t it?

Alerting MySpace for Safety’s Sake
Odds are, if you’re getting messages from MySpace users that you think are 
inappropriate, unsafe, or questionable as far as content goes, other users 
are thinking the same thing. Whether it’s a message that you think is spam 
or a profile that has crossed the line between appropriate and inappropriate 
content, you should feel confident that if you let MySpace know what’s going 
on, they’ll do something about it. MySpace is very dedicated to making your 
experience as safe and secure as possible, and they have many different ways 
for you to report things that make you feel uncomfortable or uneasy — and 
don’t worry, you can stay anonymous.
Here’s a list of a few ways MySpace makes your MySpace experience as safe 
and enjoyable as possible:
 
 Flagging spam/abuse: Received one message too many from that 
MySpace spammer? Let MySpace know that you’re sick of it by flagging 
the message as spam/abuse. You can do this by clicking the Flag as 
Spam or Report Abuse link that’s included on every received message. 
The link is located to the right of the date on each received message, as 
shown in Figure 3-8. After you click the link, the message will be deleted 
from your Inbox; it’ll be sent to MySpace for review.
 
 Reporting inappropriate content and abuse: The great thing about 
MySpace is anyone with a profile can post basically anything on the pro-
file page. Sometimes, the bad thing about MySpace is the same thing — 
people can post basically anything, and that anything might be something 

55
 Chapter 3: Staying Safe on MySpace
that you feel is inappropriate. There are a couple of ways to let MySpace 
know about a MySpacer whose content or actions give you a not-so-great 
feeling.
 
• If you want to report a MySpace profile, click the Report Abuse link 
in the footer of any MySpace profile page, as shown in Figure 3-9. 
You’re taken to a report form where you can let MySpace know 
what’s up.
 
Figure 3-8: 
The Flag 
as Spam 
or Report 
Abuse link 
is included 
on every 
received 
message.
 
 
Figure 3-9: 
The Report 
Abuse link 
can be 
found in the 
footer links 
of every 
MySpace 
profile page.
 

56
Part I: MySpace Overview and Basics 
 
• If you have general questions or comments or want to report 
other MySpace abuse, click the Contact MySpace link that’s 
included in the footer links at the bottom of every MySpace page. 
This link takes you to the more detailed Contact Request form 
shown in Figure 3-10, where you can select Reporting Abuse as 
your subject and select one of many subtopics (such as Spammers 
or Underage User).
 
 Privacy questions and concerns: If direct e-mail is more your style and 
you have something that you want to send MySpace regarding safety, 
privacy, abuse, or anything else, they’ve set up an e-mail address just for 
you. Send your e-mail to privacy@myspace.com to let them know what 
you’re thinking.
 
 Safety tips: Before contacting MySpace, you should always check out 
the resources they’ve posted online for users. There are some great 
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) posted; you can access them by 
clicking the FAQ link located in the footer links at the bottom of every 
MySpace page (refer to Figure 3-9). From general information to safety 
tips for parents, this is a great resource that you should check out when 
you have questions.
 
MySpace can be an intimidating place. Just like the first time you set foot in 
a new school, college campus, workplace, or party, there are lessons to be 
learned about how to act and how to protect yourself. Not everyone you meet 
along the way deserves suspicion, but it’s often much better to be safe rather 
than sorry. Be patient. Be smart. Be safe.

ake a virtual walk around our MySpace neighborhood 
with us. There’s our buddy, Mike the DJ — who tools 
around town on his vintage scooter. And over there’s Ben. 
He just got married last weekend. (We read about it in his 
blog.) It looks like Kristen has a new picture up; she just 
posted a bulletin telling us she opened her own realty 
offi ce. Of course there’s Tom. Everybody knows Tom.
Those are just a few of the friends we’ve linked up with on 
MySpace. We’ve had invites come in from a lot of others, 
too — and have spent time searching the site for our real-
life neighbors, co-workers, old classmates, and people 
with the same interests as ours. We’ve also used the site 
to send them messages and keep up with what they’re 
doing. This part shows you how to do the same.

B
uilding connections and making friends has been a central part of the 
human condition since we first lumbered out of the cave and figured 
out that banging two rocks together was only fun when it would attract a 
crowd and get some attention. Whether you’re deathly shy or an uncom-
promising social butterfly, making and maintaining friendships is one of the 
most valuable experiences of our lives. We make friends at school, work, and 
pretty much anywhere we have the opportunity to share common ground 
with other individuals. Today, MySpace is that common ground for millions 
of people, and friending on MySpace is an easy alternative to striking up a 
conversation with that girl who happens to be choosing your favorite movie 
at the rental shop. It also makes it easier to stay in touch with many more 
people with whom you may have lost touch otherwise.
So, whether you secretly desire the celebrity status of having millions of 
MySpace friends or just want to communicate more efficiently with your clos-
est handful of “real-world” friends, friending on MySpace may be the solution.
Getting Your Friending On
A friend in everyday life is normally defined as someone you know, like, and 
trust. You can make a new friend anywhere you go, and depending on what 
type of person you are, you may have just a few friends or a lot of friends. 
Regardless of the number of friends you have, someone else can only become 
your friend if it’s mutual; nobody gets to be your friend unless you want them 
to be. This same rule also holds true in MySpace, and the result — known as 
friending — is the underlying foundation of MySpace.

60
Part II: The MySpace Community 
As you make the leap into the MySpace world, friending will be one of the 
main things that you’ll be exposed to. There are many ways to interact 
with the millions of members who are on MySpace, and the ways that you 
can interact with them differ greatly depending on whether you’re friends. 
Friending can be a great way to connect with people and groups you already 
know, and maybe some that you don’t. But before you jump on the friending 
bandwagon, you should know some more details on how to add, find, accept, 
and reject all the potential friends who are out in the wide world of MySpace. 
MySpace, here we come — get ready to get your friending on!
The Almighty Friend Request
To understand MySpace, you must first understand the single most fundamen-
tal thing that makes it what it is — the Friend Request. The Friend Request is 
probably one of the simplest and most utilized aspects of MySpace, and it’s 
used as a way to create a mutual friendship within the MySpace world. It takes 
two to tango, and if you don’t want to be someone’s friend (or vice versa), 
it won’t happen. If the Friend Request is officially accepted, the two parties 
involved are considered friends and the world is a better place.
Whether you’re friends with someone on MySpace can make a big difference 
in how you can interact and communicate with that person. In the following 
sections, we take a detailed look at what it really means to be a MySpace 
friend — as well as the ins and outs of friending.
Breaking Down the Friend Request
Congratulations! You’ve found some people you consider, for one reason or 
another, worthy of friending. Or, maybe you haven’t found them . . . but you 
know they’re out there. This section gives you a better understanding of how 
to search the millions of MySpacers so you can find that needle in a haystack, 
send out a Friend Request, and know what happens when you receive one.
Finding some friends
So many potential friends, so little time. When you make the big move into 
the MySpace world, your first goal may be to find yourself some potential 
friends. Millions of users are active in the MySpace community and are just 
waiting to be friended, so let’s go find them.

61
 Chapter 4: Friending the MySpace Way
Here are a few potential ways that you could find a prospective friend on 
MySpace:
 
 Locate a user with a direct MySpace URL.
 
 Browse for a user.
 
 Search for a user.
Locating a user with a direct MySpace URL
Using a direct MySpace URL to locate an individual is becoming easier to 
do. More and more bands, people, companies, and other MySpace users are 
broadcasting their MySpace URLs though fliers, e-mails, stickers, billboards, 
TV commercials, and any other method of advertising and promotion. If one 
of these URLs catches your eye and you can remember it, plug it into your 
browser and you’ll be taken directly to that MySpacer’s profile page.
Browsing MySpace for a user
Browsing for a user on MySpace is another method you can use to find a 
friend. With more than 100 millions users, there’s bound to be a few people 
out there that you can relate to — it’s just a matter of finding them. Browsing 
for users is MySpace’s way for you to sift, sort, and filter through the masses, 
making it easy to find the types of MySpacers that you’re looking for.
To browse MySpace for users, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Browse link at the top of your MySpace profile page.
 
 The Browse link is the second link from the far left side, located just to 
the right of the Home link. This opens the Browse Users window.
 
2. Choose a Basic or Advanced browse.
 
 When the Browse Users window opens, there are two options for brows-
ing, Basic and Advanced:
 
• Basic: The Basic option limits the number of browse options that 
MySpace lets you use to narrow your results. These options are 
limited to sex, age, relationship status (such as single and mar-
ried), reasons for using MySpace (such as dating and friends), and 
whether or not to return those who haven’t posted a profile photo.
 
• Advanced: The Advanced option allows you to better pinpoint 
your search results by offering you many more search options. 
From body type to education level, this option is definitely for the 
users who know exactly who they’re looking for.
 
 You can switch between the two by clicking the tabs on the upper-right 
corner of the Browse Users window, as shown in Figure 4-1.

3. Select your browse criteria.
 
 After you select Basic or Advanced, you then need to select all your 
browse criteria. There are many different criteria that you can filter your 
results by, such as gender, age, interests, and many, many more.
 
4. Select a sort method.
 
 The Browse Users window also allows you to sort your results. The Sort 
Results By options are Recently Updated, Last Login, New to MySpace, 
and Distance (refer to Figure 4-1). By default, the results are sorted by 
Distance.
 
5. Click the Update button to view your browse results.
 
 After you click the Update button (refer to Figure 4-1), your browse 
results are shown beneath the Set Browse Criteria box. A maximum of 
3,000 users will be returned.
 
 After your browse results are shown, you can click any other users’ 
names to view their profile pages. When you’re on a user’s profile page, 
you’re ready to send the Friend Request on over. To find out how to 
send a Friend Request, see the section “Sending a Friend Request,” later 
in this chapter.

63
 Chapter 4: Friending the MySpace Way
Searching MySpace for a user
Searching for a user on MySpace is yet another way for you to find a friend. 
Whereas browsing for a user is a very broad way to filter through the users 
upon users of MySpace, searching allows you to locate who you’re looking for 
in more of a precise and specific way. You can search for users by display 
name, e-mail address, or school, to name a few. Usually searching is used to 
find a very specific person or group of people based on fairly strict search 
criteria.
You can search for a user on MySpace by following these steps:
 
1. Click the Search link at the top of your MySpace profile page.
 
 The Search link is located just to the right of the Browse link. This opens 
the MySpace Search window.
 
2. Choose your method of search.
 
 As shown in Figure 4-2, there are four methods for searching MySpace:
 
Figure 4-2: 
The 
MySpace 
Search 
window is 
split into 
four search 
methods.
 
 
• Find a Friend: This method allows you to find someone you’re 
specifically searching for. This could be a friend, family member, 
or someone else you already know. You can search by Name, 
Display Name, or E-mail Address.
 
• Classmate Finder: This method searches MySpace by School 
Name, Country, and State/Province. This is a quick and easy way 
to find users you know from your high school or college years.

64
Part II: The MySpace Community 
 
 Searching is the only way for you to search for your long, lost 
classmates. Browsing allows you to find MySpacers who have 
attended high school or college, but it doesn’t let you browse a 
specific high school or college.
 
• Search Profiles for People with Similar Personal Interests: This 
method allows you to search for other MySpace users by typing a 
keyword and selecting an area of interest to search, such as General 
Interest, Music, Movies, or Books. Looking for someone else who 
also thinks that Will Ferrell is the funniest actor of all time? This 
would be the place to do it, so search away our comedy-loving 
friend.
 
• Search Profiles for People with Similar Career Interests: This 
method allows you to dig up other users who may have the same 
career affiliations as you do. It’s human nature to find others who 
are into the same things you are, and this method makes it a little 
bit easier for everyone. Whether you’re into film, nightlife, or 
television, someone with the same interests is just a click away. 
Almost too easy, isn’t it?
 
3. Click the Find button and search to your heart’s content.
 
 After you narrow down who you’re looking for, click the applicable 
search button to see your results. Depending on your method of search, 
you may even be able to drill down even deeper into your results.
 
 For instance, if you search for your alma mater, you’ll eventually be able 
to filter your search results even more by graduation year, male/female, 
age, and more. MySpace lets you really pinpoint the people you’re trying 
to find — which is good, considering there are millions and millions of 
MySpacers out there.
After you find your needle in the haystack, simply click that person’s profile 
link or profile picture — and you go directly to that user’s profile. Whether 
you send the user a Friend Request is completely up to you, but if you want 
to go through with it, check out the section “Sending a Friend Request,” later 
in this chapter.
To send or to receive, that is the question
After you become a member of the MySpace community, individuals, bands, 
companies, groups, comedians, and filmmakers are just a few of the types 
of MySpacers you might run into while going about your business. Whether 
you find them or they find you, sooner or later you’ll be making some friends. 
When it comes to friending, here are the two ways that you can officially 
become someone’s friend:

65
 Chapter 4: Friending the MySpace Way
 
 You send a fellow MySpacer a Friend Request. There they are, star-
ing at you through the screen. It might be someone you searched for 
as a graduate of your high school class. It might be an old friend you 
lost touch with. Perhaps it’s a friend of a friend who seems to always 
have something funny to say, or someone you’ve never met who just 
so happens to share your love for pickled beets. Who knows, it might 
even be someone you saw on television or read about in the newspaper. 
Whatever the specifics, you’ve found someone you admire enough to 
link yourself to via the social network of MySpace.
 
 A fellow MySpacer sends you a Friend Request. Every piece of informa-
tion you make available on MySpace is a possible reason why people will 
be drawn to your profile. Someone out there is interested in the fact that 
you’re both into bowling and fine wine. They may find you because you 
know someone they know or because you went to the same school they 
did. They may be new to your area and are hoping to find others who 
share common interests. Whatever the reason, you’re a likeable person 
and people want to get to know you better. It’s up to you to decide if the 
requester is someone worthy of being your friend.
Sending a Friend Request
Sending a Friend Request is the most important step in the overall friending pro-
cess on MySpace. MySpace, as the tagline says, is “a place for friends,” so what 
are you waiting for? Stop talking and go make some friends! Although there are 
many different ways to search out and find users on MySpace, there’s only one 
place where you can initiate the sending of a Friend Request. That one place is 
the Add to Friends link in any user’s Contact box, as shown in Figure 4-3.
 
Figure 4-3:

Friends link

provided 
way to

a Friend

The Add to Friends link

66
Part II: The MySpace Community 
 
Even though the Add to Friends link is the only place that MySpace pro-
vides for sending another MySpacer a Friend Request, you can use the Web 
address of the link in other places as you please. You can usually copy this 
link by right-clicking the Add to Friends link and selecting the Copy Shortcut 
option. For instance, you can send another user a message with your Add 
to Friends link address so they could add you directly from that message, 
instead of them having to click the link in your Contact box. The actual 
link looks something like this: http://collect.myspace.com/index.
cfm?fuseaction=invite.addfriend_verify&friendID=99804220.
Examples of received Friend Requests
Think of MySpace as a giant cocktail party. 
You show up, and at first you spend some time 
looking around and finding the people you 
already know. That guy from work. The girl you 
sat next to in 8th-grade biology. Your bowl-
ing team members. Eventually, you start talk-
ing to those folks, who then introduce you to 
the other people they know. The more people 
arrive at the party, the bigger your circle of 
friends grows.
The same goes with MySpace. You never know 
who you’ll meet. You may have made a big 
impression on someone you met only once in 
passing. You may have thought (or hoped) you’d 
never see or hear from certain people again. 
You just never know who is out there looking 
for (or coincidentally finding) you, such as:
 1. My R.A. from my freshman year of college
 
 I hadn’t heard from Jim, my resident assis-
tant in the dorms my freshman year, for 
over 6 years until his face popped up in 
my Friend Request window. Of course I 
accepted — and in the process, I found out 
that he now lives in Savannah, Georgia, and 
he is married and has a daughter. Oh yeah, 
he’s also a helicopter pilot for the Navy! I 
would have never talked to him again if it 
hadn’t been for MySpace.
 2. My cousin from Maryland
 
 I normally only catch up with my family from 
Baltimore once a year during our tradi-
tional summer vacation. That’s all changed 
thanks to MySpace. One day I received a 
Friend Request from my cousin, who lives 
in Maryland, and we now are updated on 
things all year long. Don’t worry, we still 
go on vacation — Grandma still needs the 
updates; I have yet to get her up and run-
ning on MySpace.
 3. Darth Vader on the Top 8 Tour
 
 While I was on the road during my Top 8 
Tour, I ran into a very interesting charac-
ter when driving through Phoenix, Arizona. 
When we got off the bus, there was a man 
dressed head-to-toe in a Darth Vader outfit. 
He was out cruising the country as Darth 
Vader, and we happened to run into him. 
Awesome, huh? Well, after we hung out for 
a while (and after I tried on his Darth Vader 
helmet), we had to part ways. I never thought 
I’d hear from him again until I checked my 
MySpace account — and there he was 
in all his Darth Vader glory, just hanging 
out in my Friend Request window. He had 
signed up and sent us a request as soon as 
he made it to an Internet connection. Once 
again, MySpace was the connector.

 Chapter 4: Friending the MySpace Way
The steps to sending a Friend Request are as follows:
 
1. Locate the user’s Contact box on his or her profile page.
 
 Normally, the user’s Contact box is located directly under the user’s 
profile photo on the profile page.
 
2. Click the Add to Friends link in the Contact box (refer to Figure 4-3).
 
 The Add to Friends link is located on the left side of the Contact box, 
second link from the top. After you click the link, the Add to Friends con-
firmation screen appears, as shown in Figure 4-4. This is MySpace’s way of 
asking you, “Are you sure you want to send a Friend Request to this user?”
 
 There are also two additional options when sending your Friend 
Requests. The first is the ability to send a short message along with the 
Friend Request that can help your potential friend with the decision of 
accepting your request or not. The second is the option of including 
your full name with the request, which helps your potential friend know 
who you are beyond your MySpace username.

requesting 
them.
 
 
3. Click the Add to Friends button on the confirmation screen to send 
the Friend Request.
 
 After you click the Add to Friends button, the Friend Request is sent. A 
message then comes up letting you know that a request has been sent to 
the user.

68
Part II: The MySpace Community 
 
Wondering whether your Friend Request ever went through? Having second 
thoughts about that last Friend Request that you sent? By clicking the Friend 
Requests button in your Control Panel, you’re taken to the Mail Center Friend 
Request Manager window, where you can select the Sent Requests link to see 
the status of every Friend Request that’s still pending. From this window, you 
can click the Send Message button to send a reminder to the pending friend to 
ask what the hold up is. Or, if you want to cancel the pending Friend Request, 
simply click the Cancel Request button.
Accepting a Friend Request
Just as you’ll be searching and finding users to become friends with, other 
MySpacers will be doing the same. This means that you might be the user 
that shows up in someone’s search, which could also mean that you might be 
getting a Friend Request sent your way. It always takes two to tango, and you 
might be surprised by who ends up requesting to be your friend.
Accepting a Friend Request is a quick and easy process, but before you 
can start adding friends, you first need to know that you have Friend 
Requests waiting for your approval. As with many of the other updates 
within MySpace, the fact that you have pending Friend Requests is commu-
nicated loud and clear after you log in. As shown in Figure 4-5, a New Friend 
Requests! update is shown in your Updates section whenever you have 
Friend Requests that you haven’t viewed.

69
 Chapter 4: Friending the MySpace Way
To begin accepting those friends that are anxiously awaiting your approval, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the New Friend Requests! update or the Friend Requests button 
in your Control Panel.
 
 This takes you directly to the Friend Request Manager window, which is 
where the fate of these pending friendships are in your hands.
 
2. In the Friend Request Manager window, you have three choices (as 
shown in Figure 4-6) — choose one and go with it.
 
• Approve: You can make the user’s day and accept his as your 
friend by clicking the Approve button. After you click the Approve 
button, the user will be removed from the Friend Request Manager 
window and will appear in your Friend List.
 
• Deny: Don’t think that the pending friend deserves to be in your 
short list of who’s who in MySpace friends? Click the Deny button, 
and the user will be removed from the Friend Request Manager 
window without being added to your Friend List.
 
• Spam: Does the person friending you seem a little fishy or do you 
think that the profile is a fake? If this is the case, MySpace has 
made it really easy to let them know who’s real and who’s not 
by allowing you to instantly flag a potential friend as spam. If it 
doesn’t feel right, click the Spam button, confirm that you think it’s 
spam, and move on with your MySpace business.
 
 Under these three options are two other options to help you figure out 
exactly who is trying to request your MySpace friendship. The first 
option is to send them a message by clicking the Send Message link. 
This is MySpace’s way of letting you find out a little more info on this 
so-called pending friend. Not real sure you want to add that particular 
user? Just send off a message — maybe the response will make you feel 
a little better about approving or denying them. The second option is to 
click the View Mutual Friends link so that you can see the friends that 
you and your potential MySpace acquaintance have in common. After 
seeing the friends that you both have in common, it’ll hopefully help you 
decide whether you click the Accept or Deny button, but either way it’s 
your choice, so choose wisely.
 
 In a hurry? You can Approve/Deny multiple users at once by checking 
the boxes next to the user’s profiles pictures or by checking the Check/
Uncheck All box and clicking the Approve All/Deny All button at the 
bottom of the Friend Request Manager window. Warning: Be careful, 
though, when using this feature — there’s no confirmation screen, so 
make sure that your decision is final.

What Being a Friend Really Means
You’ve started sending and accepting the truckload of Friend Requests that 
you’ve received. Now all you need to know is what it actually means when 
you hit the Approve button and become friends. We’ll go through what you 
and your newfound MySpacers can do now that you’re officially friends.
As you can see in the following list, becoming friends with another user 
allows you to interact and communicate with each other much more openly 
and freely. By friending another user, you’re telling yourself that you trust 
him enough to not abuse the benefits of being MySpace friends. Here’s a 
quick breakdown of things that you or any of your newfound friends can do 
now that you’re officially MySpace friends:
 
 Profile comments: Profile comments (discussed in further detail in 
Chapter 5) are one of the most commonly used communication methods 
on MySpace. When a friend leaves a comment on your profile page, it’s 
out there for the entire world to see, so make sure that you keep up with 
what people are saying.
 
 Photo comments and tagging: When you create your MySpace profile, 
you’ll most likely fill it up with photos of you, your friends, and other 
things that let people know a little bit more about you. Even if another 
registered user isn’t your friend, they can still view your photos, but 
they must be your friend to leave a comment about them or tag them. 
Want to read more about photo comments? Check out Chapter 10.
 
 Video comments: As with photos, any registered user can view any 
video that you post on MySpace, but they must be your friend to com-
ment them. Comments are a great way to get feedback from your friends 
on all the things you post, so if you want more opinions, you might want 
to add some more friends. More details on MySpace videos can be found 
in Chapter 11.

71
 Chapter 4: Friending the MySpace Way
 
 Instant Messaging: By default, only friends can Instant Message you 
through MySpace — and most users keep it this way. To find out more 
about Instant Messaging, turn to Chapter 5.
 
 Bulletin views: Bulletins, which are discussed further in Chapter 5, are 
messages that are sent to the Bulletin Space of every one of your friends. 
This means that the more friends you have, the better the chance that 
someone reacts to the bulletin that you just sent out. Bulletins are a 
great way to keep up with all your friends, but you won’t be seeing any-
thing in your Bulletin Space unless it’s been sent by someone who has 
earned a spot on your Friend List.
 
 Friend Status and Subscriptions: Want to know what your friends are 
up to at this very moment? Well, you’re in luck because after you’re 
officially friends, you can see each of your friend’s Friend Status and 
Friend Subscriptions, which keep you in the loop on what’s going on 
in her world at all times. For more information on Friend Status and 
Subscriptions, turn to Chapter 5.
 
 Private profiles: For privacy reasons, MySpace allows you to make your 
profile private so that only your friends can view the majority of what 
you’ve added to your MySpace page. If you run into someone who has a 
private profile and you want to interact with that person, you’d better send 
a Friend Request and cross your fingers in hopes that your new prospective 
friend will friend you back. If that doesn’t happen, you’ll never get to see the 
full profile. More privacy and safety information can be found in Chapter 3.
Managing the Masses
After you start making and adding friends, you’ll need to be able to manage 
them. Whether it’s keeping up with your Friend Requests, dealing with 
unwanted friends, or making sure your growing Friend List is in check, this 
section has you covered.
Using the Address Book
Before you know it, you’ll have more friends than you know what to do with. 
Some will be people you see every day at work, and others you may never see 
face-to-face. With all these different people, personalities, and preferences, it 
can be easy to confuse Angela from Miami with Mia from Los Angeles.
A quick and easy way to keep track of your ever-growing Friend List is to use 
the Address Book. It works much like the address book of your favorite e-mail 
program; MySpace allows you to add contact names and information so it can 
group them into more manageable pieces. You can take all the guesswork out 
of how you met the contact by jotting down a few things in the Contact Notes 

72
Part II: The MySpace Community 
section. This comes in especially handy when you begin to meet “friends of 
friends” or people even further removed from your current everyday circle of 
co-workers and former classmates.
Adding a Contact
You can add someone to your Address Book by following these steps:
 
1. Click the Address Book button in your Control Panel.
 
 After clicking the Address Book button, you’re taken to the main 
Address Book window, as shown in Figure 4-7.
 
Figure 4-7: 
The Address 
Book 
window.
 
 
2. Click the Add Contact button located on the left side of the screen.
 
 This will take you to a form where you can input all your contact’s 
information.
 
3. Fill out all known contact information.
 
 You can get as detailed as you want as far as your contact’s information 
is concerned. The only information that’s required is the contact’s e-mail 
address, but the more information that you can add the better. You 
can store multiple e-mail addresses, phone numbers, messenger screen 
names, and notes for each contact that you enter into the Address Book.
 
4. Click the Save & Add Another button.
 
 This will save your contact and clear the form so you can enter another 
contact.
 
 The quickest way to add a contact is to use the Quick Add Contact feature 
at the bottom of the Address Book window. This method is much faster, 
but it doesn’t allow you to enter additional contact information that you 
may want to store. But if you’re in a hurry, this is definitely the way to go.
 
 After you add your contacts to the Address Book, you can sort them, 
search them, view their profiles, and message them all from one location.

73
 Chapter 4: Friending the MySpace Way
To Friend or not to Friend?
As you begin your friending spree, you’ll receive Friend Requests from some 
users who you know right off the bat and some who may be a little more, how 
do we say this, unfamiliar. Being able to decide whether the user is friend-
worthy is very important, as you don’t want to let just anybody into your 
online circle of friends.
 
If you keep these points in mind as you wander through the seemingly never-
ending world of MySpace, you should be just fine:
 
 Unusual or misspelled display names: Make sure to take a good look at 
the display name of the user who’s trying to friend you. If he’s a spam-
mer or someone that you might not want to associate with, this could be 
one of your first clues.
 
 No profile picture: If a user doesn’t have a profile picture on the 
account, it’s likely you’re looking at a spam account. Anyone who would 
legitimately want to become your friend would at least take the time to 
add one picture to his or her profile.
 
 Profile research: If you still aren’t sure about the Friend Request you 
receive, simply click the link to their profile and do a little research on 
the user. Pay attention to the comments that other people have left 
on the page, check for links or images that take you to a third-party 
Web site, and take a look at their picture gallery to see if they look
legitimate. Within a couple minutes, you can tell if she’s potential 
friend material.
 
 Send a message: If all else fails and you think it’s worth the time, click 
the Send Message button on the Friend Request and ask the person 
directly why he or she chose to send you a Friend Request. If the answer 
sounds good to you, you can accept; if not, you can deny. It’s your 
world; he or she is just trying to become part of it.
The Top Friends Phenomenon
The Top Friends section in MySpace is the new social thermometer in the 
Internet world. Deciding how many Top Friends you want to have, who 
makes it to your list, and the implications of each are all details that you 
can’t overlook.
If MySpace is the world’s school cafeteria, your Top Friends are those that 
you’ve specifically chosen to sit at your table for lunch. Just as in junior high, 
the decision as to who to include in this very public group will be noticed, and 
much joy and drama can come as a result of who is and who is not included in 

74
Part II: The MySpace Community 
this list. Each time a person visits your profile page, he’s greeted not only by 
the information you publish about yourself, but also by the smiling faces (or 
other, less welcoming photos) of your “Top Friends.”
Choose your Top Friends wisely — they’ll be “vouching” for you each time 
someone visits your MySpace page.
Getting your Top Friends in order
Your Top Friends are front and center when someone stops by your profile 
page, so knowing how to manage them is a must if you’re going to become 
part of the social MySpace landscape. To some, it’s a big deal to be in some-
one’s Top Friends, and as crazy as it seems, that means it’s not to be taken 
lightly. But not to worry, to get up to speed on all this Top Friends business, 
all you need to do is read this section.
Your Friend Space
The first thing that you need to understand when talking about Top Friends 
is your Friend Space. Your Friend Space, as shown in Figure 4-8, is found at 
the bottom of your MySpace profile page. This area doesn’t show all your 
friends, but it’s where you can view, edit, and interact with those who are 
lucky enough to make it into your sacred Top Friends list. Who is included in 
your Top Friends, why they are there, and when they’ll move on and off the 
list will change more than you will like to admit. Keeping your Top Friends  
updated is something that will become a habit after a while, but first you 
need to know how to manage it.

 Chapter 4: Friending the MySpace Way
Managing your Top Friends
Getting your Top Friends in order is a piece of cake because MySpace makes 
it easy to manage. To get your Top Friends up and running, all you need to do 
is follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Change My “Top Friends” link in your Friend Space.
 
 When you click the Change My “Top Friends” link, which is in the lower-
right corner of your Friend Space, you’re taken to the Edit Your Top 
Friends! window, as shown in Figure 4-9.

2. Using the drop-down list, select the number of Top Friends you want 
displayed (see Figure 4-9).
 
 MySpace gives you the option of displaying 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 
or 40 Top Friends. How many friends you have — and how many of those 
you want displayed as Top Friends — will help you determine how many 
you choose. Note that if you have five Top Friends and you want them 
all displayed on your page, you need to select a number higher than the 
number of Top Friends you have (in this case, 8). Also, the lower the 
number of Top Friends, the more important the people you choose for 
the spots will feel. Depending on how many you select, the same number 
of red spaces for friends will be added in your list of friends.
 
3. Find the friends you want displayed as your Top Friends.
 
 Now comes the tough part — deciding who you want to be in your Top 
Friends list. Don’t be too hard on yourself, the choices that you make 
here are by no means permanent, and they can be changed quickly.

76
Part II: The MySpace Community 
 
4. Drag the selected friends into the red Top Friend spots.
 
 Your friends will be displayed in front of you so you can easily drag 
friends in and out of the red Top Friend spots as needed. Depending on 
how many friends you’ve collected, this could be several pages long and 
it might be fairly difficult to find the friends you’re looking for. You can 
freely drag any of your friends into any of your Top Friend spaces, which 
means that you not only need to decide who’s in your Top Friends, but 
you also need to decide who goes where. Who will get the coveted first 
spot in the upper-left corner? That’s for you to decide.
 
 Having trouble finding that certain someone in your long list of friends? 
As long as you know the person’s First Name, Display Name, E-mail, or 
MySpace URL, the easiest way to find a friend who’s in your list is by 
using the Search Friend List section in the upper-right corner of the 
Edit Your Top Friends! window (refer to Figure 4-9). After entering your 
friend’s information, click the Find in Friends button, and if something 
matches, the needle in the haystack will appear at the bottom of the red 
Top Friend spaces. If that’s who you’re looking for, click and drag your 
new Top Friend into the red space that it deserves . . . for now.
 
5. Save your new Top Friends.
 
 This is the moment you’ve been waiting for. It’s now time to make this 
thing official by clicking the almighty Save Top Friends! button. After you 
save your new Top Friends, your Friend Space on your home page and 
your Top Friends on your public profile will display your changes.
 
 It’s only a matter of time before people begin to notice that they’ve 
been added, removed, or moved to a new spot in your Top Friends list. 
You might be surprised with some of the reactions you get — your Top 
Friend spots are a big deal, whether you want to admit it.
Deleting a Friend
Believe it or not, you may find yourself in a situation where you need to 
delete a friend from your Friend List — de-friend if you will. This could be due 
to many different reasons, but regardless of why you want to delete a friend, 
if you know that it’s time, you definitely need to know how. Follow these 
steps to delete the unwanted friend from your Friend List forever:
 
1. Click the number of friends link in your Friend Space.
 
 Clicking the number of friends link (the number of friends you have 
inside parentheses) in the upper-left corner of your Friend Space section 
of your profile page takes you to the View Friends window.
 
2. Click the Edit Friends button.
 
 This takes you to the View All Friends window, as shown in Figure 4-10, 
where all your current friends are displayed.

3. Find the friend you want to delete.
 
 Here comes the hard part, finding the friend you want to delete from 
your Friend List. Unfortunately, MySpace doesn’t make this too easy on 
you, so if deleting this friend isn’t urgent, you may want to just forget 
about it.
 
 But if you’re dead set on deleting the friend, you need to first find that 
person by flipping through your friends that are listed in the Friends 
window. The friends aren’t listed in any particular order, so finding the 
one friend might take a little while depending on how many friends you 
have.
 
4. Select the box under your friend’s picture and click the Delete 
Selected Friends button (refer to Figure 4-10). Good riddance.
 
 This completely deletes the friend from your Friend List forever (or at 
least until you decide to add him back). Also, there isn’t any delete-con-
firmation alert, so there’s no room for second thoughts; be 100 percent 
sure that you want to delete him.
 
 If you want to delete all your friends with one click of a button, you can 
select the Select All box and click the Delete Selected Friends button. Or, 
if you want to delete multiple friends at once, select the Select All box, 
go back and deselect the friends you want to keep, and then click the 
Delete Selected Friends button. Use this option only if you want to delete 
an entire page (or multiple friends) at once.

In This Chapter
 Getting to know your MySpace Mail Center
 Keeping track of your MySpace contacts
 Exploring the methods of MySpace communication
F
inding friends on MySpace is only half the battle — the second half is 
working out the best way to communicate with them. MySpace is cen-
tered around communication, and your method of communication may vary 
depending on who you’re sending a message to, what that message is, and 
how you want it answered. Whether you’re messaging a long-time friend or 
trying to get the word out about your next big get-together, MySpace pro-
vides you with a wealth of tools to get the job done. This chapter examines 
the tools you have at your disposal to get the information it takes to find the 
perfect mix and get the results you want.
Getting to Know the Tools
MySpace has created a wide array of tools that allow you to contact individu-
als in many different ways. The more familiar you can become with the tools, 
the better. These tools include
 
 Mail Center: The one-stop shop for all things communication. The look 
of the Inbox will remind you of your Web e-mail or Outlook Inbox, with 
the addition of a few new features. Messaging is the term used for the 
e-mail functionality within MySpace.
 
 Comments: A quick and efficient way to keep in contact with your social 
circle, comments allow your MySpace friends to leave you a quick note 
on your page for all to see. These are the virtual equivalent of stopping 
by your friend’s house and leaving a note on his front door.
 
 Bulletins: This is MySpace’s version of mass communication — the one 
way to hit all your MySpace friends with one message. Bulletins are a 
great way to get the word out quickly to a lot of people.

80
Part II: The MySpace Community 
 
 Friend Status: This is a quick and instant way to update your MySpace 
friends on your mood or any other precious piece of random information 
that you want to let your friends know about. Making a peanut butter and 
jelly sandwich at 2 a.m. and feel like letting the world know? Well, it’s your 
lucky day because this is a quick and easy way to do just that.
 
 Friend Subscriptions: One of the main reasons for joining the MySpace 
fun is the fact that it makes keeping up with your friends a piece of cake. 
By viewing their latest blog, picture, video, and other posted items, 
you can get a glimpse into what they’re up to in a matter of seconds. 
MySpace realizes this and has made it as easy as ever to keep up with 
these various changes from your friends’ profiles by having a constant 
stream of what’s going on in your Friend List at all times. This feature 
is Friend Subscriptions, and it’s an easy and simple glance at what your 
friends have been up to lately on MySpace.
 
 Instant Message (IM): Don’t want to wait for a message response? IMing 
on MySpace is for you. IM is a real-time chat session between any two 
MySpace friends at any time.
 
 This type of IM, which is accessed using the Contact box on an indi-
vidual’s profile, isn’t to be confused with MySpaceIM. MySpaceIM is a 
downloaded application installed on your PC outside the MySpace Web 
site. MySpaceIM is discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.
In the sections that follow, we take a more in-depth look at each of these 
communication tools.
 
For information on blogging with MySpace, check out Chapter 6.
Message Management 
with the Mail Center
When you simply want to send someone a one-to-one message through 
MySpace, messaging is the way to go. When looking at all the various ways 
to communicate through MySpace, messaging will most likely seem the most 
familiar. It’s similar to normal, everyday e-mail operations on a Web-based 
e-mail service, such as Hotmail, or on e-mail clients, such as Outlook.
 
Messaging, as opposed to Instant Messaging (discussed in the “Instant Access 
with Instant Messaging” section, later in this chapter), isn’t a simultane-
ous, real-time chat with another user. It’s best to think of messaging as your 
MySpace e-mail — one message sent to one user’s MySpace Inbox for reading 
the next time that user logs in.

81
 Chapter 5: Staying in Touch via MySpace
 
Unless you specifically disallow it in your Spam settings (see Chapter 3 for 
Spam options), messaging is available between users even if the users aren’t 
technically “friends,” meaning that you can send a message to any and every 
MySpace user you choose (though that doesn’t mean she’ll respond). A 
friend — in MySpace-speak — is a mutually accepted addition to two users’ 
Friend Lists on MySpace. A MySpacer sends a friend request to another; if the 
request is accepted, the two users are officially friends (for more information 
on friends, see Chapter 4). This makes messaging a great way to meet new 
people, ask questions, and find out more about other users before actually 
accepting them as official friends. You can also use the messaging feature as a 
way to communicate with users who are requesting to be your friend — espe-
cially if you aren’t familiar with who they are. Often messaging is the first com-
munication you have with a person on MySpace.
Your Mail Center (as shown in Figure 5-1) is your one-stop shop for nearly 
all things MySpace. Whether you’re sending, receiving, or deleting messages, 
this is a place to get used to. It’s also the place you’ll find yourself excitedly 
checking in hopes of finding the latest correspondence.

You can access your Inbox in the Mail Center by following these steps:
 
1. Log in to your MySpace account.
 
2. On your profile page, locate the Control Panel on the left side of the 
screen, as shown in Figure 5-2.
 
 In the Control Panel, you see buttons for Inbox, Friend Requests, and 
Sent messages, among others.
 
3. Click the Inbox button in the Control Panel and you’re there.

The Control Panel
The Mail Center may remind you of other e-mail clients you’ve seen, but with 
a few additions — such as a Bulletin link (discussed later in this chapter in 
the section “Creating and sending a bulletin”), an Address Book link (dis-
cussed in Chapter 4), friending links, and a link that takes a user directly to 
your Confirm Add Friend confirmation page (also discussed in Chapter 4).
The following list walks you through the Mail Center’s parts and pieces that 
deal directly with messaging:
 
 Inbox: Links to your received messages, sorted with newest messages 
at the top — Mail Center doesn’t allow for any other type of sorting. The 
messages are tagged with the date and time received, profile link and 
picture of the sender, message status (read/unread/replied), and message 
subject. The check box in the left column is used when moving messages 
to the Trash folder.
 
 Sent: This is where you can not only see what messages you’ve sent, but 
you can also see whether a message has been read yet. The same status 
options used in the Inbox are used for sent messages (read/unread/
replied). If you want to hold on to a sent message, be sure to save it (see 
the next bullet on how to do that); all sent messages in the Sent folder 
are automatically deleted after 14 days.
 
 Saved: If you want to make sure that you don’t delete a message from 
that special someone, the Saved folder is where you want to put it. To 
save a message, simply open it and click the Save button below the mes-
sage. Doing so moves that message from your Inbox to the Saved folder.

83
 Chapter 5: Staying in Touch via MySpace
 
 Trash: Whenever you delete a message, you aren’t really getting rid of 
it forever — at least not yet. What you’re really doing is sending your 
deleted message to the Trash folder. This helps with those “Whoops, I 
didn’t mean to delete that!” moments. All messages are held in the Trash 
folder for 30 days before they’re automatically deleted. Even though you 
can still view all messages in the Trash folder, there isn’t a way to bring 
the message back to your Inbox. This is why MySpace double-checks 
with a confirmation screen before sending messages to the Trash. If you 
want to make sure that the message is never seen again and you don’t 
want to wait 30 days before the automatic deletion, click the Empty 
Trash link when you’re in the Trash folder and the Trash will be emptied 
right then and there.
As stated previously, the other links (Bulletin, Address Book, and so on) found 
in the Mail Center don’t deal directly with messaging, but don’t worry — we 
cover them in Chapter 4.
Creating and sending a message
When surfing MySpace, you’re never far from creating and sending your next 
message. The first step is to find the user you want to contact. When you 
find a user, the most common way to send a message is by using the Send 
Message link on another user’s profile. This is especially important when 
introducing yourself to someone new.
After you land on a profile that you think looks message-worthy, follow these 
steps to contact the individual:
 
1. Locate the MySpace user you want to contact. You can find users in a 
couple different ways:
 
• A known contact: You can type the specific MySpace link for a 
known contact (www.myspace.com/xxx) or, if the known contact 
is in your Address Book, you can contact the person from there as 
well. For more on the Address Book, see Chapter 4.
 
• Browse: Browsing is a great way to find other users by using cer-
tain designated criteria. Click the Browse link at the top of your 
MySpace profile page. It’s located between the Home and Search 
links. This will bring up several browsing options such as gender, 
age, and location so you can narrow your results. When the results 
are displayed, click any of the profile pictures to be taken directly 
to that user’s profile page.
 
• Search: Searching is a keyword-based method of finding other 
MySpace users that gives more of a snapshot view of a user’s info 
when searched. Click the Search link at the top of your MySpace 

84
Part II: The MySpace Community 
profile page, which is directly to the right of the Browse link. This 
takes you to the main search page, where you can search users by 
keywords, display name, real name, e-mail address, school/univer-
sity, or networking affiliations. After you’ve entered your search 
criteria and are given results, click the profile picture (or click the 
View Profile link) of any user to be taken to the profile page.
 
2. When you’ve found the user you want to contact, locate the Contact 
box on the user’s profile page.
 
 The Contact box is usually located directly beneath the profile picture 
on each MySpace page. The Contact box, as shown in Figure 5-3, has sev-
eral options available. The link to send a message is always in the upper-
left corner of the Contact box.
 
Figure 5-3: 
Most 
communi-
cation 
begins by 
clicking an 
option in the 
MySpace 
Contact box.
 The Contact box
 
3. Click the Send Message link in the Contact box.
 
 This takes you to the Send a Message window in the Mail Center, which 
will automatically be in the correct mode so a new message can be 
composed, as shown in Figure 5-4. The To: information is already set 
based on the user that you’re contacting. You’ll notice that composing a 
MySpace message is similar to composing an everyday e-mail.
 
 One thing many people like about MySpace is that it gives all users 
the flexibility to customize almost anything on their profile pages. 
Customizing, which is covered in Chapter 12, is a great way to give your 
profile page some personality, but it can also make it look completely dif-
ferent from the standard MySpace profile; the Send Message link (as well 
as the entire Contact box) could look and read differently. Instead of Send 

85
 Chapter 5: Staying in Touch via MySpace
Message, it could say Give me a shout or Message Me. Although 
the look of the Contact box can change, the position of the different links 
won’t. The Send Message link will always be in the upper-left corner.
 
Figure 5-4: 
The Send 
a Message 
window is 
where new 
messages 
are 
composed.
 
 
4. Fill in the Subject and Body fields for the message in the Send a 
Message window.
 
 When composing your message, you don’t need to include a Subject, but 
to send it, you must enter some content into the body of the message. 
Messages can include HTML, which means that links, images, and so on 
can be used in the body.
 
5. Click the Send button at the bottom of the Send a Message window.
 
 After you type everything that you want, press the Send button and off 
it goes. After your message is sent, a confirmation message box (see 
Figure 5-5) appears to let you know the message was sent successfully. 
Pat yourself on the back: You’ve now officially sent your message.
 
Figure 5-5: 
A confirma-
tion appears 
after your 
message 
has been 
sent.
 

86
Part II: The MySpace Community 
 
 After sending your message, you can check its status by heading to your 
Sent folder in your Mail Center. Depending on what action the recipient 
has taken, the status can be Read, Replied, or Unread. This takes the 
guesswork out of figuring out whether your message has been opened. 
It also enables you to know if someone is too busy, or just plain uninter-
ested, in communicating with you.
Replying to a received message
As mentioned earlier, any user on MySpace can send a message to any other 
user any time they feel like it; sometimes you won’t be initiating the contact, 
but you’ll be replying to it. As your list of friends grows, so will the number 
of messages you’ll be responding to. Follow these steps to reply to a received 
message:
 
1. Click the New Messages! link in the red Updates box.
 
 Before you can reply to a message, you need to somehow know that 
you’ve received one. MySpace lets you know that a message is waiting in 
your Mail Center Inbox through updates displayed on your profile page 
after login. The New Messages! update, as shown in Figure 5-6, will be 
clearly displayed in the Updates box when a new message is waiting for 
you. By clicking the New Messages! link, you’ll be taken directly to the 
Inbox window of the Mail Center.
 
Figure 5-6: 
The New 
Messages! 
update 
enables you 
to know that 
a message 
is waiting 
for you in 
your Inbox.

2. Click the Subject link to open the Message.
 
 The most recently received messages will be listed at the top of your 
Inbox. Any new message will have a status of Unread in the Status 
column. Click the Subject link to open the message for reading.

87
 Chapter 5: Staying in Touch via MySpace
 
3. Click the Reply button.
 
 By clicking the Reply button at the bottom of the message, the Reply 
Message window in the Mail Center will open so a reply message can be 
composed. As shown in Figure 5-7, the subject line will add an RE:, and 
the original message will be quoted in the body of the reply message as 
reference for the recipient. This is similar to how e-mail treats replies.
 
Figure 5-7:

cally adds 
an RE: to the 
message’s

line, and

message 
will be 
quoted in 
the Body 
section.
 
 
4. Compose a reply message.
 
 Fill out a reply message in the Body section of the Reply Message 
window above the original message text.
 
5. Click the Send button.
 
 Click the Send button at the bottom of the Reply Message window to 
send your reply. After the reply is sent, a confirmation message box 
enables you to know that it was a successful reply.
Forwarding, saving, and deleting 
received messages
Of course, replying isn’t the only option you have after receiving a message. 
There are times when the message you’ve received doesn’t require immedi-
ate action. In fact, there are times when a message doesn’t deserve your 
attention at all. As shown in Figure 5-8, you can also Forward, Save, or Delete 
any message that may find it’s way to your Inbox.

88
Part II: The MySpace Community 
 
Figure 5-8: 
You can 
Reply, 
Forward, 
Save, or 
Delete any 
received 
message.
 
Here’s a breakdown of how to do each:
 
 Forwarding a message: If you’d rather pass along the received message 
to someone other than the message sender, forwarding is for you. Click 
the Forward button and you’re taken to the Forward Message window 
of the Mail Center. This window looks similar to the Send a Message and 
Reply Message windows, except for one main difference — the empty 
To: box. The To: box, as shown in Figure 5-9, allows you to type a name 
(real name or MySpace username) so you can choose to whom you want 
to forward the message. Pick a friend, compose your message, and click 
the Send button to forward it.
 
 You can only forward messages to individuals in your Friend List, which 
is sometimes handy but also limiting.
 
 Saving a message: Worried that you might lose a message that you’ve 
received? If you click the Save button at the bottom of the Reply 
Message window of the Mail Center, you won’t need to worry anymore. 
This sends the message to the Saved folder for safekeeping. When the 
message is sitting in the Saved folder, you can still reply, forward, or 
delete it just as you could when you first received it.
 
Figure 5-9: 
Forwarding 
a message 
to a friend.
 

89
 Chapter 5: Staying in Touch via MySpace
 
 Deleting a message: If you feel like deleting the received message from 
your Inbox, click the Delete button at the bottom of the Reply Message 
window of the Mail Center. After the Delete button is clicked, the mes-
sage will be permanently moved to the Trash folder. When sent to the 
Trash folder, there’s no way to get it out. MySpace will automatically 
empty messages in your Trash folder that have been there for 30 days, 
but if you want them completely deleted, immediately, click the Empty 
link to the right of the Trash link when you’re in the Trash Mail Center 
window (see Figure 5-10).
 
 Not all messages are what you want to receive. Whether it’s spam that’s 
trying to sell you things you don’t need or something unquestionably 
inappropriate, MySpace has ways to deal with unwanted messages. Flip 
to Chapter 3 for more information on ways to deal with the messages 
that you aren’t too fond of.

Communicating with Comments
When looking at all the different ways to communicate with your fellow 
MySpace friends, Profile Comments are the most popular and the most public 
way to stay in touch. A Profile Comment can be left to say happy birthday, 
to post an upcoming event reminder, or to rehash last night’s concert. No 
matter the reason, Profile Comments are a fun and effective way to keep up 
with everyone else’s world. Leaving a voicemail is like so five years ago.

Part II: The MySpace Community 
Ten popular reasons for leaving a Profile Comment
There are many different reasons for leaving a 
comment on another MySpacer’s profile page. 
Here are ten of the more popular reasons for 
reaching out and commenting someone:
 1. Looks like I have a new friend.
 
 Did that special someone finally add you to 
that coveted Friend List? Show them your 
appreciation by giving them an obligatory 
“Thanks for the Add” comment.
 2. Your show last night ROCKED!
 
 What better way to let your favorite band 
know that their show was incredible than 
by leaving them a comment? It will let them, 
and everyone else who browses their page, 
know how much of a fan you really are.
 3. Do you still exist?
 
 If you haven’t seen one of your friends, 
co-workers, or family members in a while, 
leave them a comment to see if they are 
still somewhere on planet Earth. A simple 
“Hello, is anyone home?” comment would 
work nicely.
 4. Dude, you’re awesome.
 
 If you happen to like what you see on some-
one else’s page, comments are a great 
way to let them know. Whether it’s a sweet 
profile design, a hilarious video, or a new 
or goofy profile pic, tell her your thoughts 
through a quick comment.
 5. Looks like we had a good time last night.
 
 The only thing better than having a good time 
is letting others know how much of a good 
time you actually had. Whether it’s posting a 
few pics, videos, or just recapping the night in 
a few sentences, leaving something to show 
everyone how much fun you had is always a 
great reason to leave a comment.
 6. I don’t feel like working right now.
 
 Say you’re at your job, staring at your com-
puter screen, and not really motivated to 
work at the moment. What better way to 
spend your time than posting a few com-
ments to catch up with your friends?
 7. Give and you shall receive.
 
 It’s always fun getting a new comment, and 
most users will not give a comment unless 
they’ve received one. It’s a give and take 
comment world out there, so go post a few 
comments and wait for the responses to be 
posted back on your page. To increase your 
chances of getting a reply, ask a question or 
add some personalization to the comment.
 8. I love what you’ve done with the place.
 
 Most MySpacers like to keep their profiles 
fresh and new; many people update the look 
of their profile pages on a regular basis. If you 
like, dislike, or have noticed updates to your 
friends’ profiles, let them know with a com-
ment. Everyone loves feedback (especially 
positive!), so feel free to let the comments fly.
 9. I know a lot of people will see this.
 
 If you’re looking for ways to get noticed on 
MySpace, a comment on a popular user’s 
profile page might do the trick. Be careful with 
this though, an irrelevant comment could get 
you some bad feedback or it could be deleted 
from the user’s profile page all together.
 10. Look at what I found!
 
 Find a hilarious pic, an interesting video, or 
a crazy blog on the Internet? Let everyone 
else know about it by leaving a comment 
with links to the newfound goodies so they 
can check it out as well. Other users who 
browse the user’s page can see it too if it 
catches their attention.

91
 Chapter 5: Staying in Touch via MySpace
One of the most powerful things about MySpace is the ability to dig deeper and 
find out more information about any particular user. When browsing a user’s 
profile page, the Profile Comments section can give a great snapshot of what 
the user’s friends are like, what he’s been up to lately, and who he hangs out 
with regularly. Another thing to remember is that you must be friends with 
someone to leave him a Profile Comment; users can’t comment randomly with-
out first being added to your Friend List. This reduces the amount of Comment 
Spam and allows only those users you’ve given the green light to a chance to 
add something public to your profile page for all to see.
If you comment me, I’ll comment you
As you begin to comment your friends and they begin to comment you, there 
are a few things that you should keep in mind. Comments are a big part in 
the success of MySpace, and they open the door to a fairly public and open 
method of communication between millions of people. The following are a 
few items related to Profile Comments that you should be aware of while 
MySpacing:
 
 Anyone can view Profile Comments: Just because you must be some-
one’s MySpace friend to post a Profile Comment doesn’t mean you have 
to be a friend to read it. When posted, a Profile Comment is ready for 
the entire Internet to see, so make sure that whatever has been posted 
is something that you don’t mind others, such as co-workers, bosses, 
family, friends, and anyone else with an Internet connection and a curi-
ous mind, reading.
 
 Proper Profile Comment etiquette: MySpace is all about give and take, 
meaning that if someone has taken the time to comment you, you should 
take the time to comment them back. Use generic Profile Comments 
sparingly and try to personalize what you say as much as possible. This 
also works the other way as well; if you want someone to comment your 
page, take the initiative to leave them a Profile Comment first.
 
 HTML is okay, just don’t overdo it: As long as you allow it in your 
settings, users can incorporate HTML code when posting a Profile 
Comment on your page. HTML code can be used effectively when post-
ing pictures, videos, and links. But be careful not to overdo it — if you 
want someone to view something that’s a little more lengthy, add a link 
for them to check it out instead of posting a lengthy Profile Comment.
 
 You can disable HTML in your Profile Comments by clicking the Account 
Settings link on your profile page and then clicking the Change Settings 
link in the Profile Settings section. If you don’t want users to post HTML, 
check the Disable HTML Profile Comments box and click the Change 
Settings button. More information regarding profile management and 
control is covered in Chapter 3.

92
Part II: The MySpace Community 
 
 Managing your Profile Comments: If you want to approve all com-
ments before they’re displayed on your Profile page, click the Change 
Account Settings link on your profile page and click the Change Settings 
link next to the Privacy Settings section. Check the box next to Approve 
Comments before Posting and click the Change Settings button.
 
 I am like so popular: The amount of Profile Comments on a user’s page 
is directly related to the public perception of how popular the user is 
with his/her Friend List. When someone takes the time to leave a legiti-
mate Profile Comment on another user’s page, it shows that they are 
interested in what that user is up to. The more Profile Comments, the 
busier the profile is, which shows the amount of interest in that particu-
lar user. By persuading other users to add Profile Comments to your 
page, you’re creating a profile that shows how much people care about 
you and what you’re doing. For a band looking to get booked for shows, 
this could mean the difference between looking like you have a great fol-
lowing and looking like you don’t have fans.
Posting a Profile Comment
Posting a Profile Comment is one of the easiest and most effective ways to 
communicate with the members of your Friend List. Creating and posting a 
Profile Comment can be done by following these steps:
 
1. On your friend’s profile page, scroll down to the Friends Comments 
section.
 
 The Friends Comments section is usually shown directly following the 
Friends Space on your friend’s profile page, as shown in Figure 5-11.
 
2. Click the Add Comment link at the top of the Friends Comments section.
 
 This takes you to the Post a Comment entry form.
 
3. Fill out the Body of the Comment entry form and click the Submit 
button.
 
 Enter the Profile Comment you want to leave for your friend. Include 
any HTML code that you want to include as well. If the user doesn’t 
allow HTML in the Profile Comments, that too is displayed on this form 
so you’re aware of the setting.
 
4. Confirm the Profile Comment and post the comment or edit it.
 
 A Confirm Comment screen appears and gives you a preview of how 
your Profile Comment will appear when posted. If the preview looks the 
way you want it to, click the Post Comment button to post. If you need 
to make changes, click the Back button on your browser to edit.

Deleting a Profile Comment
In case you have second thoughts about that Profile Comment that you 
just posted about you-know-who doing you-know-what, fear not, Profile 
Comments are as easy to delete as they are to post. Follow these steps to 
delete a Profile Comment that you’ve posted:
 
1. On your Friend’s profile page, scroll down to the Friends Comments 
section.
 
 You just posted the Profile Comment here, so you should be able to find 
this section pretty easily.
 
2. Click the View All link at the top of the Friends Comments section.
 
 This link will take you to a page with all your friend’s comments listed, 
as shown in Figure 5-12.
 
3. Find the Profile Comment you want to delete.
 
4. Click the Delete My Comment link at the bottom of the Profile 
Comment you posted.
 
 The Delete My Comment link will only show up at the bottom of the 
Profile Comments that you’ve posted. When you click the link, a confir-
mation message will ask whether you’re sure that you want to delete the 
Profile Comment. If you’re sure, click OK, and the Profile Comment will 
officially be deleted.

Messaging the Masses with Bulletins
MySpace was built in a way that allows any one person the ability to send 
messages to other users in a quick and easy way. Whether you want to send 
a personal message to a friend or broadcast a message to anyone who will 
listen about your upcoming garage sale, MySpace has a way to do it. The 
number of people you can contact is limited only by the size of your Friend 
List. This variety is a big part of what makes MySpace a useful way to quickly 
get the word out to the masses about anything and everything.
A bulletin is MySpace’s way of giving the millions of users a way to broadcast 
a message to every one of their friends via Bulletin Space. The more friends 
you have, the more likely the bulletin will get noticed and (hopefully) viewed. 
There are many reasons why you may want to send out a bulletin, such as:
 
 Don’t Forget: Bulletins are an easy, non-intrusive way to give friendly 
reminders to all your friends. If you’re having a big party, getting mar-
ried, or having your ten-year class reunion, sending out a bulletin can 
help remind people what’s happening.
 
 My Thoughts: Although it might not be the most relevant information, 
sometimes you just want to let your friends know what you’re thinking 
during random moments of your life. Just remember, the thoughts that 
you type into a bulletin will also be available to every single one of your 
friends. Filling out surveys and sending them in a bulletin is also a popu-
lar way to tell others a little about yourself in a fun and interesting way.

95
 Chapter 5: Staying in Touch via MySpace
 
 Your Thoughts: It’s always good to know what other people think about 
things, and a bulletin is a quick way to get feedback and opinions on dif-
ferent subjects. Sometimes the truth hurts, so be careful what you ask for.
 
 Updates: Just posted some new pictures or a new blog? Maybe you just 
updated your profile layout? Send a bulletin to let your friends know 
what’s up. It’s always good to keep your friends in the loop.
 
 Awareness: Let your friends know about the music tour that you’re leav-
ing for, about the purchase options for that cool new T-shirt that’s now 
for sale on your Web site, or that you’re looking for a new house. No 
matter what you want them to be aware of, you can let them know by 
sending a bulletin.
 
 Getting Viral: By forwarding a bulletin that you think is worth seeing, 
you’ve increased the audience for that particular message. Instead of 
just being sent to the original sender’s Friend List, you have now sent it 
to your own Friend List as well. A forwarded bulletin can become viral 
and reach hundreds, thousands, and potentially even millions of users 
quickly.
Locating the Bulletin Space
If you want to take a look at the bulletins that you or your friends have 
recently sent, sign into your account and browse on over to the third section 
in the middle of your profile page. There you should see a box with the head-
ing Bulletin Space, as shown in Figure 5-13.
 
Figure 5-13: 
The Bulletin 
Space 
is where 
the most 
recently 
posted 
bulletins 
can be 
viewed.
 
The Bulletin Space

96
Part II: The MySpace Community 
If one of the bulletins looks interesting enough to deserve your undivided 
attention, click the subject under the Bulletin heading to open it. After it has 
been opened, you can read, interact with, or just plain ignore the bulletin. 
The bulletin is pretty straightforward and has only two options when opened, 
as shown in Figure 5-14:
 
 Reply To Poster: Press this button if you want to send a message, com-
ment on, or give feedback to the original sender of the message. If you 
aren’t familiar with the sender, simply click the sender’s profile picture 
to view that person’s profile. The reply you send will be sent to the 
Inbox of the user as a MySpace message.
 
 Delete From Friends: If you have had one too many bulletins sent to you 
from a particular user, click this button to delete that person from your 
Friend List permanently. With two simple clicks, the user vanishes from 
your Friend List.

Creating and sending a bulletin
So now it’s time to send that oh-so-important message to your friends to let 
them know that you’ve decided to run for president. Okay, maybe it’s not that 
important, but you still want to get a message out to your fellow MySpacers. 
Whether your friends are ready or not, you’re going to create and send a bul-
letin to the masses.

97
 Chapter 5: Staying in Touch via MySpace
When creating a bulletin, you basically have a blank template to work with, 
as shown in Figure 5-15. Before you start typing away to your heart’s con-
tent, it’s always good to think about why you’re sending the bulletin and 
what message you really want to get across. Considering that bulletins are 
the only way to message several people at one time, many people abuse this 
feature by sending them out all the time for no particular reason. If you send 
out a large number of bulletins, you risk a chance of not getting your friends’ 
attention when you really need to — not to mention that your friends could 
become annoyed and delete you from their Friend Lists permanently — con-
sider it the “Boy Who Cried Wolf” of the new millennium.
 
Figure 5-15: 
A bulletin is 
a great way 
to send a 
message to 
your entire 
Friend List.
 
To create and send a bulletin, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Post Bulletin link on your profile page.
 
 The Post Bulletin link is in the bottom-right corner of the Bulletin Space 
section on your MySpace profile page, as shown in Figure 5-16.
 
2. Fill out the Subject and Body areas of your bulletin message.
 
 MySpace requires both a Subject and Body to be entered before a bul-
letin is sent. If you aren’t sure if your message looks the way that you 
want, don’t worry because there’s a confirmation page that enables you 
to preview your message before you send it. Also, there’s an option to 
allow for your bulletin to be commented on by your friends, so go ahead 
and check it if you feel like it. Figure 5-17 shows the bulletin text before 
posting to the preview/confirmation screen.

You can add some more interactive elements to your bulletins by inserting 
some simple HTML code. Bulletins are flexible and will allow you to add most 
HTML tags for images, videos, and links. By adding the HTML code into your 
message, you make it that much easier for your friends to interact with it. The 
easier and more engaging that you can make your bulletin, the better.
Be heard
So, you’ve decided to create a bulletin. It’s a big 
moment. All eyes will be on you, but I suppose 
that’s the whole point. So, how do you get the 
attention of your audience? It helps if you have 
a reputation for sending out pertinent informa-
tion, but even if this is your first message, you’ll 
have plenty of folks eager to hear what you 
have to say. The first step is perhaps the most 
important — filling out the subject line. Above 
all, it’s best to be clear and direct about what-
ever it is you’re planning on talking about. Sure, 
you have an obscure movie quote or a funny bit 
of wordplay that would be perfect, but save it 
for the main text — it’s been proven that the 
more direct the subject line, the more likely your 
message will be opened. If you’re extending a 
special offer or prize, you might want to include 
that, as well. Allow the recipient the ability to 
quickly decide if the topic is something interest-
ing to him. Although you can’t provide a mes-
sage (or a bulletin) that’s perfect for everyone, 
you can find one that’s right for the right indi-
viduals. When they’ve decided the message is 
worthwhile, it’s up to them to decide whether 
the offer you’ve extended is worth the cost 
(even if the price is just time and energy)!

100
Part II: The MySpace Community 
If you aren’t too familiar with HTML code, an easy way to figure out how 
to add these elements is by finding an interesting bulletin that gets sent to 
you, hitting the Reply to Poster button, and looking at the HTML code and 
text that makes up the bulletin’s message. When you reply to the bulletin, 
the HTML code for the bulletin will be included in the reply message. All 
you need to do is copy and paste the message into a new bulletin, make any 
needed changes, and test your new HTML. Use the preview/confirmation 
screen to test your code before you send the message.
Whoops! Deleting a bulletin
 
If for some reason you think that you might not want people to see the bulletin 
that you just posted, there’s an easy way to delete it from MySpace quickly. 
Follow these steps to get rid of it:
 
1. Go to the Bulletin Space on your profile page and click the View All 
link.
 
 This takes you to the Bulletin Board window.
 
2. Click the Show Bulletins I’ve Posted link on the top-right side of the 
window.
 
 When you click the Show Bulletins I’ve Posted link (as shown in 
Figure 5-19), you are taken to a list of the bulletins you’ve posted. 
Remember, any bulletins you post expire in ten days and won’t be 
available for viewing.

3. Select the check box to the left of the bulletin that you want to delete 
and then click the Delete Selected button located below the list of 
bulletins.
 
 By checking the box to the left of the bulletin and clicking the Delete 
Selected button (as shown in Figure 5-20), you deleted the bulletin from 
MySpace completely, and it’ll be removed from all your friends’ My 
Bulletin Space as well. Also, there’s no confirmation prompt when you 
delete one of your bulletins, so make sure that you definitely want it 
removed before you delete it.

Instant Access with Instant Messaging
It may seem hard to believe, but increasingly, even messaging or an e-mailing 
takes too long to get the information that you need. Sometimes, you need to 
know right now, this instant, pronto. Instant Messaging, or IMing, is your answer. 
It’s much like the rise in popularity of text messaging on mobile phones; Instant 
Messaging on your computer gives you all the immediacy of a phone call without 
any of that pesky effort of having to actually speak to someone.
The first thing you need to know is that you can only IM with your friends on 
MySpace, so IMing with complete strangers is out of the question. When you 
find that oh-so-special friend who deserves the grace of your IM invitation, 
follow these steps to get your conversation started:
 
1. Find the Contact box on the profile page of the user you want to IM.
 
 The Contact box is normally directly under the user’s profile picture. 
Although each Contact box can look different, the Instant Message link 
will always be located in the left row, third from the top, as shown in 
Figure 5-21.

 When you click the Instant Message link, a new chat window pops up. A 
Connecting animation flashes while MySpace attempts to connect you to 
your friend.
 
3. Wait for the chat window to load and then chat away to your heart’s 
content.
 
 When you connect with your friend, you see a full chat window (as 
shown in Figure 5-22), and you can start chatting with your friend in 
real-time. A discussion thread is created to help you keep track of the 
conversation.

Tying It All Together
After looking at all the different ways to communicate with other users on 
MySpace, we want to point out that these tools are even more powerful when 
used together than they are individually. When you’re truly trying to get a 
message out to your friends, be aware of each type of communication, how 
they’re used, and whom they can reach. Always remember your audience; 
consider how you might reach them best with your intended message. As 
you move forward with your MySpace adventures, keep the following tips in 
mind to communicate effectively with your MySpace audience:
 
 Keep it personal: People hate being bothered or spammed, regardless 
of whether they’re your MySpace friends. When sending any type of 
message through MySpace, try to make it as personalized as possible. 
The reactions you get from a more personalized approach will be worth 
the extra time it takes to do it.
 
 Mix and match: Look at ways to mix all the different communication 
methods together. Looking to attract attention to something on your 
MySpace page? Send a bulletin that announces it — and send a few 
select messages to your friends, letting them know about it. Encourage 
comments and feedback by asking for focused opinions.
 
 Make it easy to interact: When sending a bulletin, message, or posting 
a Profile Comment, add links, shortcuts, and anything else that makes 
it easier for the viewer to interact. If you want a friend to post a Profile 
Comment on your page, send a bulletin with a link that takes your 
friends directly to where they can post one quickly. Take out as many 
steps as possible.
 
 Don’t reinvent the wheel: As you discover more about MySpace, you’ll 
pick up on ways other users code their messages to create effective 
ways to communicate. If you come across a bulletin that you think 
rocks, simply hit the Reply to Poster button to view the code used to 
create it. Take that code and apply it to what you’re doing. In a commu-
nity like MySpace, there’s no need to start from scratch.
Figuring out how to effectively communicate with your fellow MySpacers will 
become easier and easier as time goes on, but it’ll always be something that 
you must stay on top of. Just as with everything else in life, the more you 
give, the more you receive. Knowing what message to send to whom — and 
at what time — is one of the most important things you’ll need to master as 
you move forward. Also, if you ever get stuck or have questions about some-
thing, remember that MySpace is a community — ask the other users ques-
tions. You’ll be surprised how willing other users will be to help you out.

Blogging on MySpace
In This Chapter
 Writing your blog
 Making your blog look distinctive
 Inserting visuals and audio into your blog
 Letting others know about your blog
 Discussing your blog with others
You’ve probably heard the word “blog” before, even if you’ve never writ-
ten or read one. Everyone from your local newscaster to those wordy 
folks who put together dictionaries have acknowledged the existence of these 
online writings. Politicians and pundits rant about the “blogosphere,” won-
dering what these words mean for upcoming campaigns and opinion polls. 
Musicians and fans count on blogs for grassroots promotion of their songs. It 
seems everybody has a blog these days.
So what is a blog? The short answer is that it’s short for Weblog, but that 
really doesn’t say much. The full story is that a blog is a collection of writings 
about whatever you want to write about. Think of a blog as an online note-
book or journal where you can write down what you’re thinking and feeling 
about any subject you want. You’re the only writer and editor involved.
This chapter takes a look at creating your blog and what you can do to 
change its visual appearance on-screen. When you’re done, you’ll have a 
place all your own to let the world know how you feel.
What Should I Blog?
The short answer to this question is simple — whatever you want! That’s 
probably not all that helpful, though, and it certainly makes for a short chap-
ter. The whole thing is up to you, but it’s good to keep some things in mind 
as you set out on your blogging career.

106
Part II: The MySpace Community 
Knowing your audience
It’s always a good idea to keep in mind who you’re talking to while you write 
your blog. That way, you’ll have an idea of what will interest your readers 
and how you’ll talk to them. Even if it’s just a quick update of your daily activ-
ities, you’ll want to phrase it to be read by your friends or family. You’ll also 
want to keep in mind what information you want to be public — does your 
grandmother (assuming she knows how to use MySpace) really need to know 
about that road trip to Las Vegas?
 
You don’t have to have a MySpace account to be able to read the blogs of 
MySpacers — keep this in mind when you begin blogging through MySpace.
Writing about what you know
You’ll be more likely to contribute to a long and productive blog if the sub-
ject matter interests you. If you really want to discuss existential literature 
online, feel free to add to that canon of knowledge. There’s no shame in using 
your blog to keep your friends and family up to date on your life, either. Base 
your blog on your interests and don’t feel pressured to write about some-
thing you don’t know.
If you want a jump start, MySpace lists several categories you can file your 
blog under. To see the categories MySpace has made available to you, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Blog button located in the Control Panel box (as shown in 
Figure 6-1) on your MySpace profile page.
 
2. Click the Post New Blog link in the My Controls box to access the Post 
a New Blog Entry window.

107
 Chapter 6: Blogging on MySpace
 
3. Click the Category drop-down list, as shown in Figure 6-2, to see the 
list of some of the categories you could blog about.
 
 Pick a category, or you can decide not to categorize your blog entry by 
selecting None. You can also use the categories to get ideas for other 
topics you could write about. Ultimately, it’s up to you.
 
Figure 6-2: 
Viewing the 
Category 
options 
MySpace 
has made 
available 
to you.
 
If you know a lot of information about something, that knowledge is some-
thing you can share through your blog. For example, you can help people 
know more about car maintenance if you want to share your expertise as 
a mechanic. Blogging about something you’re good at will help people and 
keep them coming back to read your work.
 
You can also look at other MySpacer profiles and see what subjects people are 
blogging about. It’s not a good idea to just say “Me, too!” and copy the writing 
style and subject of somebody else’s blog, but looking at what’s out there can 
give you an idea of what’s available and what holes need to be filled.
Creating and Posting Your Blog
When you have a pretty good idea of what you want to blog about, it’s time to 
make your first post. Follow the first two steps in the previous section to get 
things underway. It’s quite easy to get going.
It’s all subjective
At the top of the Post a New Blog Entry window are fields to choose the date 
and time you’re posting (MySpace enters them for you by default), along with 

108
Part II: The MySpace Community 
a subject line and the Category drop-down list. The Subject field is the title 
of the blog post you’re writing, and you can select an applicable category for 
your post if you want. Again, you don’t have to enter anything in the Subject 
field, but this information will give the reader some advance notice as to 
what they’ll read.
 
MySpace defaults to Pacific Standard Time, or PST. Take that into account 
when you’re not posting on the West Coast, and change the time to your cor-
rect zone when you make a blog post.
Your subject line is the teaser for your entire blog post, and it should sum-
marize what’s going to be talked about inside your writings. Something like 
“Crappy Day” or “Hi” probably won’t get a huge amount of attention, but some-
thing with a little flair or craziness might do the trick. This is especially true 
if you’re trying to market something, such as a small home business, through 
MySpace, but it applies to all forms of writing. You need to entice the reader 
and make them want to read your blog. Don’t just write “New Shirt,” but try 
something more like “Her Majesty Is RESPLENDANT In Her New Garments.”
Your body of work
The large text field is where you actually write your blog entry. If you’re an 
experienced writer, you already know what to do — go on and write your 
entry. If you haven’t written much before, don’t be afraid. There are plenty of 
other people taking their first steps into blogging right along with you. Just 
imagine yourself talking to someone about what your blog subject is and then 
type what you would say. Blogs aren’t formal papers — you can throw all the 
anxiety about that bungled book report in 4th grade out the window. Make it 
informal and conversational. You’ll reach a lot of readers with that style.
You can also include links to Web pages, photos, songs, videos, and other 
items in your blog. To add links to items within your blog, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Post a New Blog Entry window, the Advanced Editor toolbar 
should appear by default. It is located above the Body section of your 
blog, as shown in Figure 6-3.
 
 If you don’t see the Advanced Editor toolbar, click the Go to Advanced 
Editor link in the Body section, as shown in Figure 6-4.
 
2. To insert an item into your blog, select the appropriate button from 
the Advanced Editor toolbar. Your options include
 
• Insert Link: The button featuring the globe and a chain link below it.
 
• Add Image: The button featuring an image of a picture.
 
• Insert Symbol: The button featuring a key from a keyboard.
 
• Insert Emoticon: The button featuring . . . well, an emoticon.

3. When you’ve clicked a button to insert an item, fill out the informa-
tion in the window that pops up and click OK (if you’re inserting a 
link or image), or make a selection from the options that appear (if 
you’re inserting a symbol or smiley).
 
 The link or image will be inserted automatically into your blog entry.
 
Some browsers might not handle the Advanced Editor correctly. In that case, 
use the Simple Editor (refer to Figure 6-4). You can still enter the link, but you 
have to enter it manually. For example, when you click the Link button, it asks 
for the URL and the text. You then have to cut and paste the result it gives you 

110
Part II: The MySpace Community 
into the body of your blog. For example, a link to the main page of MySpace 
would look like this:
<a href=”http://myspace.com”>MySpace!</a>
To insert an image, the link would look like this:
<img src=”http://sampleimage.com/sampleimage.jpg”>
You can also embed any videos that you or somebody else has put on 
MySpace. Go to the Video section under your (or somebody else’s) profile, 
and MySpace will provide the code for you to copy and paste into your blog 
text. The video will appear in place of that text when the blog is posted.
It might eventually be faster for you to type these links by hand instead of 
using the buttons. In any case, you can use the automatic or manual entry to 
insert links, pictures, symbols, and emoticons into your blog.
Attention to detail
The final section of the Post a New Blog Entry window, as shown in Figure 6-5, 
lets you determine who gets to read your blog and what you want them to 
know about yourself. The first drop-down list lets you insert a link to what 
music you’ve been listening to, what you’ve been reading, what DVDs or videos 
you’ve been watching, and what video games you’ve been playing. You don’t 
have to include all (or any) of this, but MySpace gives you an optional list of 
CDs, books, DVDs, and games to choose from. Click the Search button to look 
for your current pastime and let the world know how much that new album 
impressed you.
You can also let the reader know your overall mood by selecting a mood 
from the drop-down list or typing in your own. The drop-down list will attach 
an emoticon to your mood as a visual clue. Again, you don’t have to include 
this if you don’t want to.

 Chapter 6: Blogging on MySpace
By default, readers can leave comments or kudos (a kind of virtual high-
five) on your blog entries. If you don’t want to let them do this, click the 
Comments check box to disable that ability.
The Privacy radio buttons below the Comments check box determine who 
gets to read your blog. Your options are
 
 Public: This is the default setting, and it means your writings are free 
and open to whomever stumbles on your profile.
 
 Diary: This setting means that only you can read the entry. Everybody 
else is blocked from accessing it.
 
 Friends: This setting means that only those on your Friend List can view 
your blogs. This keeps your information confidential. For more about 
your Friend List, see Chapter 4.
 
 Preferred List: If you select this setting, only those on your Preferred 
List can view the entries. To set up your Preferred List, click the My 
Preferred List link on the left side of your blog entry page and search out 
your friends. This way, you can select exactly who reads your blog.
 
Each blog entry can have its own privacy setting. For example, you can make 
one entry a diary, and the rest can be public. This helps you control exactly 
what you tell the world and what the truth actually is.
There’s also an option for Podcast Enclosure at the end of the section, but you 
won’t use that unless you actually have a podcast. Feel free to ignore it. If you 
do have a podcast, though, you can put the link to your podcast file there. For 
more information on podcasting, check out Podcasting For Dummies by Tee 
Morris, Evo Terra, Dawn Miceli, and Drew Domkus (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
When you’re finished with your blog entry, click the Preview & Post button 
at the bottom of the page. MySpace will show you what your blog entry cur-
rently looks like. You can then choose to post that blog, edit it, or cancel out 
and dump the blog entry entirely, as shown in Figure 6-6.

Part II: The MySpace Community 
Customizing Your Blog
What your blog looks like is an important part of presenting your writings 
to the public. You not only want to concentrate on what you’re writing, but 
how the reader is going to see it. Although the overall look of your blog will 
have the same characteristics of your overall profile (for more on custom-
izing your MySpace page, see Chapter 12), there are still some color and text 
changes you can alter to make your blog stand out.
Making general page settings
Click the Blog link at the top of your MySpace account to get to the Blog 
Control Center, as shown in Figure 6-7. You have several options available to 
you on this screen.
Look at the My Controls section, located in the bottom-left corner of the 
screen. There are links to post a new blog, view your previous writings, cus-
tomize your blog, and access the blog safe mode. Click the Customize Blog 
link to access the Customize My Blog window, as shown in Figure 6-8.
 
Figure 6-7: 
The Blog 
Control 
Center.
 

113
 Chapter 6: Blogging on MySpace
 
Figure 6-8: 
Customizing 
your blog.
 
This view should look familiar to you if you’ve customized your main 
MySpace page (for more on customizing your MySpace page, see Chapter 12), 
but let’s take a look at the controls anyway. The first section of the window 
includes the General Page Settings. These settings include the background 
color of the page, the font, and where your blog will appear in the readers’ 
Web browsers. By default, the blog will appear in the middle of the browser 
with the Verdana font, but feel free to change it to whatever you want.
Technically, the letters and numbers appearing in the color choice fields 
describe the color in hexadecimal terms, so the browser can choose the right 
color to display. Luckily, you don’t have to keep track of your conversion 
tables and hexadecimal equivalents to get just the right shade of lavender for 
your blog. Just click the palette button located to the right of the fields to see 
the available color choices. Click your color choice, and MySpace will set up 
the code for you.
 
The palettes give you basic color choices, but you can try adding and varying 
shades by changing the letters and numbers in the code. Try choosing a basic 
color and varying it manually. Without getting too technical, you can use the 
numbers 0 through 9 and the letters A through F (from low to high) to change 
the colors. The first two parts of the code following the number sign represent 
the amount of red, the second two represent the amount of green, and the last 
two represent the amount of blue. Mix and match to your heart’s content.
With the Width Length window, you can set the width of the blog within the 
MySpace page, either in exact pixels or by the percentage of the page. Feel free 
to experiment and see which setting you like best. You can always change it 
back later. Any links you put in your blog will stand out from the normal text, 
and the Normal Link, Visited Link, and Active Link controls let you determine 
how they appear. You can choose a color (either through code or with the 
palette button next to the control) and whether the link will be underlined. The 
Normal link is just what it implies, whereas the Visited Link is what the Normal 
Link changes to after it’s been clicked. The Active Link changes the color of 

114
Part II: The MySpace Community 
the link being used at that exact moment in time. Finally, the Blogs Per Page 
control lets you determine how many entries are displayed on each page of the 
blog. The default number is 10, but it can range from 1 to 15.
Heads up: Modifying your page header
The header gives your readers a heads up (appropriate, isn’t it?) as to what 
they should expect from your blog. In the Page Header section (shown in Figure 
6-9), you can give your blog a title and a little explanatory text, along with some 
custom color choices. Consider the header your calling card to your potential 
readers. It should give them a brief but catchy introduction to your writings.
 
Figure 6-9: 
Modifying 
your header.
 
By default, the Custom Header is turned off so the readers will see nothing 
if you don’t want them to. To turn on the header, click the Custom Header 
radio button and fill in your options.
The Site Name field sets up the main page title, whereas the Tagline field cre-
ates the descriptive text for the right side of the header. You can also change 
the colors of the background, the font, and the border by clicking the palette 
button and choosing a color. The choices shown in Figure 6-9 create the 
header shown in Figure 6-10.
 
Figure 6-10: 
Just one 
of many 
possible 
custom 
headers.
 

115
 Chapter 6: Blogging on MySpace
 
If you’re familiar with HTML, you can add your own header information in the 
last field of this section. This could include putting pictures or banners in the 
header for an extra touch.
 
Inserting incorrect HTML can cause problems displaying the page. Unless 
you’re sure what you’re doing, you might want to leave this section alone.
Customizing . . . on the side
Whereas the header introduces the blog itself, the Side Module (shown in 
Figure 6-11) gives the reader some background on you, the writer. You can 
include as much of the information as you want, or you can leave it all out. 
It’s your choice.
 
Figure 6-11: 
Customizing 
your Side 
Module.
 
The top of the Side Module section lets you choose which side of the page to 
put the Side Module on and what colors you want to use for the border, text, 
and body. You can make it look the same as the rest of the blog or you can 
give it its own identity.
The radio buttons in the second part of the Side Module section allow you 
to choose what parts of your profile you let the reader see. For example, if 
you want the reader to see your gender but not your astrological sign, select 
Yes for the Show Gender option and No for the Show Sign option. Make your 
choices, and you’re ready to go.
The main event: Blog Post Settings
The Blog Post Settings section, shown in Figure 6-12, controls the meat and 
potatoes of your blog: the actual writing. This section controls how the writ-
ing appears to the users — and your writing is where they’ll be spending 
most of their time with your blog. Therefore, it’s probably a good idea to 

116
Part II: The MySpace Community 
make it easy on their eyes. Red text on a black background may seem like a 
good idea at first, but you’ll notice some eye strain as you go on. Don’t hurt 
the reader you’re trying to inform or entertain. Dark text on a lighter back-
ground is probably the best way to go.
 
Figure 6-12: 
Setting the 
look for your 
blog posts.
 
The commands in this section are similar to the rest of the controls in the 
Customize My Blog window, so the controls should look familiar. Choose the 
colors and font you want to use for the main section of the blog. Each blog 
post will also get a specific time and date stamp, and you can choose where 
on the page you want those to appear. This section also includes color set-
tings for the comments others leave on your blog.

The next section of the Customize My Blog window is Background Settings 
(refer to Figure 6-12). This section gives you the option to put a picture or 
song behind your blog. To use a picture, make sure you have the picture you 
want to use already loaded on a Web server. This can include any picture 
you’ve uploaded to your MySpace account (look at Chapter 10 for more infor-
mation). When your picture is uploaded, put the address for that picture in 
the Background Image field. From there, you can adjust the picture to either 
stay in place (fixed) or move as the reader scrolls through your writings. If 
it’s a smaller image, you can choose to have it repeat (like tiles) vertically, 
horizontally, or in all directions.
 
Use the background picture choices wisely. Don’t let an especially eye-catch-
ing image distract the reader from actually taking in what you write.

 Chapter 6: Blogging on MySpace
Using a Custom Style Sheet
At the bottom of the Customize My Blog window is the Your Own Additional 
Style Sheet section. This space allows you to add your own style information. 
To do this, you have to format it as a Custom Style Sheet. That mouthful is also 
known as a Cascading Style Sheet, or CSS for short, and it’s how the look of many 
Web pages is defined. Think of it as a list of instructions that your browser gets 
ahead of the actual Web page that tells it how to display that page.
 
There are plenty of resources for you that show you how to build your own 
CSS. Although it’ll allow you to highly customize the look of your MySpace 
page, CSS can be a little complicated. You don’t have to put anything in the 
field if you don’t want to, and in fact it’s better to avoid it until you know what 
you’re doing. There are also services you can use that will build the CSS for 
you. Look at Chapter 12 for more information on custom profile editors and 
what they can do for you.
 
It’s sometimes hard to predict how different Internet browsers (such as Internet 
Explorer or Firefox) will interpret CSS information. Try testing your blog on dif-
ferent browsers to see how it works before deciding on a final layout.
Safe Blogging
The Blog Safe Mode link is found in the My Controls box on the left side of your 
blog page. Selecting the Blog Safe Mode link (as shown in Figure 6-13) allows you 
to look at your blog without any additional HTML or commands. This means you 
can go in and fix any problems in your blog that might cause it to display incor-
rectly. Use this view if you’re having problems seeing your blog and you need to 
remove problem code. Otherwise, you can leave this view alone.

Blog Safe 
Mode link

Controls box.
 
The Blog Safe Mode link
More than likely, you won’t have to use this view too often. Unlike your com-
ments section, where others can leave HTML-based comments that might 
screw up your profile, you’re the only one in control here. Still, it’s a valuable 
tool to have in case something does go wrong. There’s nothing wrong with 
having a backup plan when it comes to putting something on the Internet.

Your Subscription
MySpace gives you a way to keep up to date with certain blogs. When you 
find one you want to keep tabs on, click the Subscribe link on the main blog 
page of that profile, as shown in Figure 6-14. Confirm that subscription, and 
you’ll automatically receive a notice in the Inbox section of your profile when 
a new blog entry is posted. Just follow that notice to see the new entry.
 
Figure 6-14:

The Suscribe link
You can also use subscriptions to let people know what you’re reading and 
who’s reading your writings. Click the My Subscriptions link in the MySpace 
Blog box on the Blog Control Center page to see who you’re subscribed to (as 
shown in Figure 6-15). Clicking the My Readers link lets you know who has 
subscribed to your blog. You won’t see all your readers — just the ones who 
have subscribed.

loaded by week and in total, along with how many comments have been left 
and who gave you kudos.

 Chapter 6: Blogging on MySpace
Spreading the Word
When you have a blog, it’s time to let your potential readers know — assum-
ing you want other people to read it. There are several ways you can do this, 
and most of them are provided by MySpace for simplicity’s sake. You can 
make people aware of your blog in the following ways:
 
 Bulletins: Use the Bulletins feature detailed in Chapter 5 to let all your 
friends know you’re keeping a blog. It’s a quick and easy way to get the 
word out, and by using the Bulletin feature, you know that your readers 
already have access to the Internet and can read what you write. Invite 
them to subscribe to your bulletin so they can always stay in touch.
 
 Comments and messages: If you have someone specific you want to tell 
about your blog, drop them a message or leave a comment on their pro-
file page. They’ll get the message.
 
 E-mail: Tell the folks for whom you have e-mail addresses about your 
blog — drop them a quick note. You don’t have to have a MySpace 
account to read blogs, so this is a good opportunity to let those outside 
the site know about your blog.
 
 RSS feed: One of the most popular ways to read and distribute blog 
entries is the RSS feed. RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication, but it 
does get into some more complicated coding from there. All you need to 
know is that readers can use this information to link your blog entries to 
their RSS readers, where they’ve likely linked to other blog feeds as well. 
Those feeds send all the text and pictures from their subscriptions into 
one central place, making it extremely easy to get a great deal of infor-
mation at once. Your readers can access this feature by clicking the RSS 
link in the top-right corner of the blog’s page, as shown in Figure 6-17.
 
 Blog groups: Create a blog group by clicking the Create a Blog Group 
link in the Blog Groups box in the bottom-left corner of the Blog Control 
Center page. You’ll be asked to name your group, describe it in a few 
words, and select a category that defines what your group is all about, 
as shown in Figure 6-18. That group will be entered in the main direc-
tory of blogs on MySpace, allowing readers interested in your particular 
subject to search you out and read what you’ve written. You can also 
browse blog groups in this section and make connections with other 
like-minded individuals.

Comments, Please?
Every blog entry includes an Add Comment button at the bottom of the page. 
People will click that link when they want to leave you a small message. You 
can also leave one or two kudos here. Just type your comment and click Post, 
and your comment is added to the blog (if that function has been enabled by 
the owner of the blog — see the section “Attention to detail,” earlier in this 
chapter).
Both the blog writer and readers can post comments; you can have an ongo-
ing discussion with your readers using this feature. This is a great way to talk 
about your blog and the subjects you write about. These entries will appear 
in sequential order, making it seem like you’re having an online conversation. 
Blogging doesn’t have to be only one-way!
 
Leaving comments on other blogs is a good way to encourage conversation on 
your own writings. Be more active in discussing blogs, and you’ll have others 
do the same for you.
 
Set up a consistent schedule for posting your blogs. People are more likely to 
come back again and again if you put up fresh entries on a regular basis.
 
If you’re already publishing a blog somewhere else, such as a WordPress or 
a MovableType blog, you can always cut and paste your entries (or at least a 
link back to your original post’s URL) into your MySpace blog. Some tools (like 
the one found at http://noumenon.roderickrussell.com/myspace-
crossposter-v2-released) even allow automatic cross-posting from your 
WordPress blog to MySpace. It may not look like your original blog, but the 
information gets into your MySpace site with minimum effort.

In This Chapter

 Using MySpace on mobile communication devices
 Using the Instant Messaging client on MySpace
T
here’s so much to keep up with on MySpace that it’s nice to have some 
help tracking it all. After all, don’t you want to know every time some-
body tries to send you a message, a bulletin, or a picture that neither of you 
can believe somebody would actually want to share with the public?
MySpace can track these events for you, even if you’re not logged in to the 
site. There are e-mail reminders, visual clues, and even text messages to your 
cell phone. If you can’t stand to be out of contact with MySpace for too long, 
consider getting some fresh air — and read this chapter.
Update! Update! Update!
MySpace automatically notifies you when you receive a new message, event 
invitation, comment (either on your profile or your blog), or Friend Request. In 
addition, you can also get a notification when somebody makes a new post to 
a blog you subscribe to. You’ll even get notified when somebody you know has 
a birthday. These updates show up in the Updates box located just above the 
Control Panel section on the main page of your profile, as shown in Figure 7-1.
These update notifications occur each and every time something happens to 
your profile. The only problem is that you have to be logged in to your profile 
to see them. It’s obviously impossible to see them if you’re away from the 
computer or not logged in. Rather than going through withdrawal, though, 
you have two ways to receive a virtual shout when something new happens.

Receiving e-mail notifications
Because you had to get an e-mail account to use MySpace anyway (for more 
on setting up an account, see Chapter 2), you might as well put it to work! 
This simple process will set up MySpace to use the e-mail address you 
entered when creating your MySpace account to e-mail you whenever you 
receive one of the following:
 
 A new message
 
 A new comment
 
 A new blog comment
 
 A new friend request
To set up e-mail notification of new alerts, follow these steps:
 
1. On the main page of your profile, click the Settings button in the 
Control Panel.
 
 The Control Panel is on the left side of the screen under your picture, as 
shown in Figure 7-2.
 
2. When you get to the Settings: Account window, click the Notifications 
link, as shown in Figure 7-3.
 
3. In the Settings: Notifications window, check the boxes if you wish to 
be notified about monthly MySpace events and/or receive e-mail noti-
fications, as shown in Figure 7-4.

123
 Chapter 7: Keeping Up with MySpace
 
 When things start moving on your profile, you’ll get all kinds of e-mails 
telling you what other people are saying to (and about) you.
 
Remember the location of this check box in case you start getting too many 
e-mails. MySpace can move quickly, and you could find that you’re getting 
more e-mail than you want. Remove the check from the box, and it all goes 
away. It’s up to you. Also, if you change your e-mail address, be sure to update 
your MySpace account with the new address. For more on changing your 
e-mail address, see Chapter 2.

Getting notifications on your cell phone
My father has a cell phone, which is a sure indicator that the rest of the 
nation probably beat him to it. Given that it’s such a widespread presence, 
it’s no surprise that MySpace alerts are happily compatible with whatever 
phone and service provider you have. Through the magic of text message, 
you can keep up to date with everything that happens on your account.
To get notifications and updates on your cell phone, follow these steps:
 
1. On the main page of your profile, click the Mobile link under the 
MySpace Links section, as shown in Figure 7-5.
 
 The MySpace Links section is located toward the bottom of the box 
underneath the Control Panel.
 
Figure 7-5: 
The Mobile 
link.
 
The MySpace Mobile link
 
2. Click the Sign-Up button in the Get MySpace Mobile Alerts section, as 
shown in Figure 7-6.
 
  There are separate links to find out more about MySpace Mobile for 
AT&T and Helio phones as well. These links let you know how you can 
use AT&T and Helio to access and use your MySpace account,   not just 
receive mobile notifications. We address these options in the next section.
 
3. Enter your mobile phone number, country, and carrier, as shown in 
Figure 7-7.
 
 If you look closely at the Mobile section of your MySpace account, you’ll 
notice several tabs — each one features things like ringtones, pictures, 
videos, and games. This is a separate subscription service from your 
normal MySpace account, and there are several options for purchasing 
these items. This doesn’t really relate to your MySpace account, but feel 
free to shop if you desire.
 
4. In the My Mobile Notification Settings box (as shown in Figure 7-8), 
select the check boxes for the events you want to be notified about.
 
 All the choices here are checked by default, but you can uncheck any 
choice you want. Your choices are
 
• Friend Request

125
 Chapter 7: Keeping Up with MySpace
 
• Profile Comment
 
• New Message
 
• Blog Comment
 
• Image Comment
 
• Event Invite
 
5. Click the Apply Settings button to begin the process.
 
 Notice the fine print at the bottom of this page! MySpace won’t charge 
you for this notification service, and that’s mighty kind of them. Your 
service provider, however, probably won’t be so generous. You’ll get 
charged for these text messages, just as you would for any others. 
Check your plan (and your wallet) before you sign up for these alerts.
 
6. Enter your phone number and your wireless carrier and then verify 
your number through a text message.

If you want to stop or reduce the text messages, go back to the My Mobile 
Notification Settings box and deselect all the check boxes. When all the 
options are deselected, click the Apply Settings button and the text messages 
will stop. You can also stop the messages from your cell phone by sending the 
message STOP to short code MYSPC.

Gotta Go! — Using Mobile Communication
Devices to Access MySpace
So far, all the mobile interaction you’ve seen with MySpace in this chap-
ter has been through simple e-mails or messages. However, there are 
other devices you can use away from your main computer to get you onto 
MySpace. Some use standard wireless Internet, and some are even built spe-
cifically for MySpace functions.
Connecting to MySpace with PDAs
Smart phones, also known as PDAs, are capable of working on the Internet, free 
from large computer towers and wired connections (and, in the case of some 
phones, even wireless hot spots). If your device can access the Internet 
remotely, chances are you can get MySpace on it. Be aware, though, that 
different browsers handle Web sites (including MySpace) differently. It might 
not look the same on your mobile device as it does on your desktop, and 
some of the functions might not work. Give it a shot, though — you should 
get good results on most devices.
MySpace has also developed a mobile version of their site tailored to the 
handheld crowd. It may not look the same as the full version, but you’ll find 
it easier to navigate and use, given the cramped quarters on your portable 

127
 Chapter 7: Keeping Up with MySpace
device. Using your Internet-enabled phone or PDA, navigate to http://m.
myspace.com and see what’s available. It may look a little bare, but you’ll 
still get the updates and information you’re looking for on the go, such as 
friend updates, important alerts, and similar information.
I IM, DO U?
The Instant Message (IM) is a second voice for many today, and it’s available 
nearly everywhere — which of course includes MySpace. MySpace took that 
a step further, though, and paired their IM service with popular Internet 
phone service Skype, allowing you to use either typed messages or full-one 
voice communication. The IM service Tom and company provide is limited 
to those who already have MySpace accounts, but that’s easy enough to set 
up (for a refresher, head to Chapter 2). Let’s take a look at how to IM your 
friends with MySpaceIM.
 
There’s a difference between using the IM/Call function in the Contact box of 
a friend and using the MySpaceIM download. For more information on the IM/
Call function, look at Chapter 5.
 
MySpaceIM only works on Windows machines using Microsoft’s Internet 
Explorer. If you don’t use this, you’re out of luck. Anybody you IM must also 
use MySpaceIM. Finally, you’ll need a microphone and speakers hooked up to 
your computer to use the Skype feature.
Get it in your system
This program stands alone from the MySpace site, although it does work 
with profiles from MySpace. To use it, download the program from http://
myspace.com/myspaceim and follow the instructions to set it up. It 
requires the following information:
 
 The e-mail address you used to sign up for MySpace.
 
 Your MySpace password.
 
 Your MySpace username. If you already have one, it’ll be entered auto-
matically. If not, you’ll be prompted to create one.
 
If you create a username at this point, your profile URL will change to
http://myspace.com/yourusernameappearshere
Remember that before you make a change.

128
Part II: The MySpace Community 
If you’ve used Instant Messaging before, this won’t seem much different from 
other programs. You can type messages in real-time between two people 
using the program, and all the friends you have available for chat will be 
listed on the screen.
Adding Friends
Part of what makes MySpaceIM so convenient is that your Friend List is 
already created for you by MySpace. You just have to pick which ones you 
want to IM from your MySpace profile. The easiest way to make this happen 
is to drag your friends’ names from their profile pages to MySpaceIM. Just 
click and drag your friend’s name (or main profile picture) from your browser 
to MySpaceIM. It’ll be added automatically. You can also use the Add Friends 
Wizard already installed in MySpaceIM.
To add friends in MySpaceIM, follow these steps:
 
1. Start MySpaceIM by clicking the IM/Call link in the Contact box on the 
profile page of the person you want to add as a friend.
 
2. Click File and then Add Friends.
 
3. Choose which friends you want to add.
 
 If you know which friends you want to add, you can pick them individu-
ally. Click which ones you want in the separate window MySpaceIM 
brings up. You can also choose to add all your friends or just the ones in 
your Top Friends list.
 
4. Now, click your friend’s name to send him a message.
 
 You both have to be logged in to chat.
Making a voice connection
Signing in and using the MySpaceIM service means you’re going to sign 
up for the Skype service as well. They may be working together here, but 
they’re two separate services. Skype works free when you’re communicating 
between two PCs using the MySpaceIM or Skype service. Click the Call button 
next to your MySpaceIM friend when you’re both online, and you’ll be on 
your way. You can also change from IM to voice by clicking the Call button in 
your chat window.
Skype provides other services, such as calling outside phones, voicemail, and 
more. Realize that these aren’t automatically part of the MySpaceIM package, 
and they don’t come free. You’ll have to buy additional credits to your new 
Skype account to take care of this.

129
 Chapter 7: Keeping Up with MySpace
Always changing
In addition to Instant Messaging, the current version of MySpace IM allows 
you to
 
 Block unwanted messages and users
 
 Save your conversations
 
 Change the look of the MySpaceIM window
 
 Send pictures to those you’re chatting with
 
 Create emoticons or zaps (a combination of a picture and a small 
sound file)
Most of these functions are accessible under File➪Preferences, so go there 
after you download the program to see what’s available. These are liable to 
change and expand as MySpaceIM evolves, so check MySpace often to see 
what’s developing. This service has expanded so dramatically in the past 
couple years that it’s hard to keep up with!
Doesn’t play nice with others
You’ll notice that MySpaceIM doesn’t interact with Instant Messaging ser-
vices such as AIM, Google, or MSN. It also doesn’t work with client programs 
like Trillian and meebo (which group the functions of other IM services 
together). The two selling points for MySpaceIM, in this case, are ease of use 
and interaction with the main MySpace site. The best use of this program 
is to keep in touch with your main MySpace friends or to communicate via 
voice to other MySpaceIM and Skype users.

 Creating events
 Inviting people to your events and managing RSVPs
 Managing your MySpace calendar
G
o ahead and admit it — you’re far too busy to manage your calendar 
without a little help. There’s no shame in getting assistance from 
MySpace. Some of the tools available to you make it easier to work with than 
a paper calendar, and you never have to worry about accidentally losing your 
MySpace account the way you misplaced your PDA last month. Plus, because 
most of your friends have MySpace accounts too, you can set up invitations 
that help you keep all your planning organized. See if your old datebook can 
keep up with that.
By the time you’re finished with this chapter, you’ll have an online reference 
that will manage your entire schedule. All your important events and invita-
tions will interact seamlessly, and you’ll be able to access them from any 
computer in the world with Internet access. Pretty handy, eh?
Organizing Your Events
MySpace makes it easy to organize events outside the digital realm, and your 
Address Book’s already loaded with your friends on MySpace. It also helps you 
manage invitations you receive from others, you social butterfly. This section 
shows you how to create your own events and add events sent to you by others. 
These all go to one common calendar, which you can manage for yourself.

132
Part II: The MySpace Community 
Getting the party started
Click the Events link at the top of your MySpace profile page, as shown in 
Figure 8-1, to get started.
 
Figure 8-1: 
The Events 
link is the 
first place to 
go to create 
an event.
 
The Events link
In the MySpace Events window, you see the Events Links box in the upper-left 
corner of the screen. The Events Links box gives you four options:
 
 Event Invites
 
 Events I’ve Posted
 
 Events I’m Attending
 
 Create New Event
If you’re relatively new to MySpace, you won’t have anything in the first three 
options. Don’t worry — these will fill up as more of your MySpace friends 
start sending invitations. And there’s no better way to let people know you’re 
around than by throwing your own bash. Click the Create New Event link to 
have some folks over to your place.
Setting the stage
Clicking the Create New Event link takes you to the Create an Event screen, 
as shown in Figure 8-2. This screen contains several fields you’ll use to 
describe your bash. Think of filling in this screen as just like writing a paper 
invitation to somebody — minus the paper. You’ll use the same information, 
but you have no cards or postage to buy. (Technology. Gotta love it.)
Give your event a snappy and enticing title (“Free Pizza!” is always a favorite), 
and make sure your name and contact e-mail are correct. You’ll have to decide 

133
 Chapter 8: Staying on Schedule with MySpace
now whether you want to make the event public or private. If you only want 
the friends you invite to see the invitation, click Private for the Event Type. If 
you want the world to know, leave it marked Public. Just remember — even 
those folks who don’t get specific invitations could run across the invitation 
and decide to make their way to your event. Because you made the event invi-
tation public, this wouldn’t be considered rude or party-crashing. Manage your 
event invitations carefully.
 
Figure 8-2: 
Creating 
your first 
MySpace 
party.
 
You also have to pick a category for your event. The Category field gives 
those viewing your invitation a quick hint as to what the whole thing is about. 
Click the drop-down list and pick the term that best describes your happen-
ing. There’s a blank category entry in case none of the entries apply, or you 
could always just go with Miscellaneous. Be as specific as possible, though. 
Details are always helpful.
 
Picking a category is a required action — and you also have to specify the event 
name and event organizer. You can’t send an invitation without filling out these 
fields, but we figure you’ll certainly want to add these and more. (Otherwise, 
how do folks know what it’s about and who’s throwing this shindig?)
Now give your event a short description. This should just be a few words 
that give a general idea of what your event entails. “Come watch movies at 
my place this Saturday!” is a good example — short, sweet, and to the point. 
You’ll have the opportunity to get more long-winded in the Long Description 
field, and you can also include pictures and links there. For instance, you 
could link a photo of (say) the park where you’re throwing the picnic, or an 

134
Part II: The MySpace Community 
online map to the event’s location. You could also get more creative — say, 
whip up an image of an invitation and insert it there.
 
If you’re putting out a public invitation, be careful of the details you choose to 
include. It’s probably not a good idea to give everybody with a computer and 
an Internet connection your address, phone number, or other information.
 
The HTML code for inserting an image is
<img src=”(Insert Image URL Here)”>
The HTML code for inserting a link is
<a href=”(Insert Link URL Here)”>Any descriptive text you 
want</a>
Now go to the top-right side of the screen and use the drop-down lists to set 
the Start Date and Start Time for your event.
 
Check to make sure your AM/PM choice is set correctly. You’d hate to have 
folks arrive half a day early or late.
Fill in the location of the event in the fields under the Where section. Give the 
location a name such as “My House” or “Joe’s Place,” and fill out the actual 
street address from there. Now click the Save Event button and you’re ready 
to go. You’ll have to enter another CAPTCHA to assure MySpace you’re not 
spreading spam before you send it, though. Your invitation should look simi-
lar to Figure 8-3 when you’re done. Click the Save Event button when your 
invitation is ready.

135
 Chapter 8: Staying on Schedule with MySpace
Your invitation’s in the mail
After you’ve created and saved your event, you’ll be asked to invite people. 
It wouldn’t be a party without guests, would it? The Invite Friends screen, as 
shown in Figure 8-4, allows you not only to invite your MySpace folks, but those 
who aren’t part of the site yet as well. It doesn’t get much more convenient.
 
Figure 8-4: 
Inviting your 
friends.
 
The Invite Friends screen first gives you the option to show your guest list 
to everyone (helpful if you want people to know who’s coming, but it’s your 
choice) and to request RSVPs on the event page. These options are up to 
you — select them if you want to use them or leave them blank if you don’t. 
By default, these options are selected and enabled, so you’ll have to turn 
them off if you don’t want them. You can also add some additional text in the 
Invitation Message field to have it included as part of (you guessed it) your 
invitation’s message. Something like “Check out my invitation — hope you can 
make it!” will work fine. You can also let people comment on your event on the 
event page if you want. An additional “Can’t wait!” or “This will be fun!” can 
help entice folks to flock to your event. If, however, you don’t need comments 
from everybody out there (or just want comments from those who have been 
invited), select the appropriate button for the Allow Comments By option.
To invite MySpace friends, scroll through the list in the Invite MySpace Users 
section at the bottom-right of your screen and then click Add Friends to send an 
invite to that person. If you click the wrong friend (“The Foreign Cinema Club” 
might not appreciate your Terminator movie marathon), click Remove Friend 
to take the name off your list. This doesn’t remove the person or group as your 
friend; it just means they won’t get an invitation to this particular event.

136
Part II: The MySpace Community 
You should also check out two options just above your Friend List. The Find 
a MySpace User to Invite link will let you search for someone on MySpace who 
isn’t already your friend and send that person an invitation. You can also group 
your friends by where they’re located by clicking the Select Friends by Location 
link to access the Select Friends by Location box, as shown in Figure 8-5. After 
all, someone who lives out of state might not be able to drop by that night — and 
this approach saves you from having to search through all the out-of-state folks.
Just put in the city and state or ZIP code you’re based in, and MySpace will 
sort out local folks from your Friend List for you when you click Find Friends. 
Pretty slick.

Changing your plans
Things change, and you may have to make some adjustments to your event as 
you go. If you have to alter your event plans, it’s easy enough. From anywhere 
in MySpace, click the Events link at the top of your browser window (refer to 
Figure 8-1) to get to the main Events screen. From there, click the Events I’ve 
Posted link to see your events. It should look something like Figure 8-6.
 
Figure 8-6: 
Upcoming 
MySpace 
events.
 
Select an event from the list on the Upcoming Events tab and you’re taken to 
the main page for your event, as shown in Figure 8-7.
From the main page for the event, click the Edit Event link to change the event 
information. The fields will look just the same as when you created the event. 
You can also upload or change the image associated with your event, cancel the 
event, or invite more attendees by selecting the appropriate link on the event’s 
main page. Choosing to cancel the event will mark the event as cancelled and, if 
you wish, send out an e-mail to those invited notifying them that the plans are 

137
 Chapter 8: Staying on Schedule with MySpace
cancelled. Choosing to invite more people takes you back to the Invite Friends 
screen (refer to Figure 8-4), where you can add more friends or e-mail addresses. 
You can also click the Blog This link or the Bulletin This link in the Spread The 
Word . . . box to add your event invitation to your blog or bulletins, respectively.
 
Figure 8-7: 
Event page.
 
 
Adding your events to blogs and bulletins is a great way to make sure every-
one knows what you’re planning. Well, okay, it’s probably best to avoid doing 
that if your event is marked private and/or you’re planning to take over the 
world. A little judgment here.
Are you going to make it?
If you requested that somebody RSVP to your event, you can check 
responses on the main page for the event. At the bottom of the page is a list 
of event attendees. You can sort them by clicking the links for Attending, 
Maybe, Can’t Make It, and Not Responded. This allows you to plan for who’s 
coming — and gently remind those who haven’t gotten back to you yet that 
you’re waiting to hear from them.
 
This information will always be available to the event organizer (in this case, 
that’s you). You can also choose to make it visible to others, as mentioned 
previously in the section “Getting the party started.”
You’re invited!
More than likely, you’ll start getting invitations to events as soon as you pick 
up a few friends on MySpace. You’ll have a bunch of your own friends on the 
site anyway, and you’ll make new friends as you go on. You’ll know when you 
get a new invitation when you see the red Updates box (as shown in Figure 8-8) 
appear above the Control Panel section of your home page.

that the link takes you directly to your Mail Center and your Event Invites 
box, which lists the invitations you’ve received, as shown in Figure 8-9.

If the sender has requested an RSVP, you can use the RSVP section to make 
your selection — and send along a short message as well. Whatever you feel 
is appropriate will work here. For the most part, MySpace invitations are 
casual and informal.
When you’re done viewing an invitation, it’ll be marked as read and the New 
Event Invitation! update will be removed from your My Mail section on your 
profile page. You can always see the invitation again by going back to your 
Mail Center and selecting the Event Invites link.

Part II: The MySpace Community 
Using Your MySpace Calendar
If you’ll be sending and/or receiving a lot of event invitations, you’ll need 
some kind of calendar to keep track of your busy schedule. Even if you 
don’t choose to use MySpace’s Event feature, there are times when an extra 
reminder can help. The point is, you’ll need a calendar to keep track of every-
thing — hey, just like the real world — and that’s built into MySpace as well.
Making your calendar your own
To access the calendar, click the Calendar button in the Control Panel sec-
tion of your profile page, as shown in Figure 8-12. Your calendar will pop up 
in the My Calendar window and it will show the current day, as illustrated in 
Figure 8-13. The default view is Day, but you can also choose a Week, Month,  
or Year view by using the tabs at the top of the calendar.
 
Figure 8-12: 
The 
Calendar 
button. 
The Calendar button
  
Click the Options link (see Figure 8-13) to see how to modify your calendar. As 
you can see in the My Calendar Options box, as shown in Figure 8-14, you can
 
 Choose to change your default view
 
 Specify whether your calendar is private, shared only with friends, or 
open to the world
 
 Declare which day the week should begin on (sorry, Monday still has to 
come anyway)
 
 Set your workday hours

141
 Chapter 8: Staying on Schedule with MySpace
 
Figure 8-13: 
Viewing 
your 
calendar.
 
If your social calendar is just so crammed that you tend to lose track, you can 
also choose to have reminders of calendar events sent to you. These can be 
sent to you via MySpace messages or external e-mail — at any time from one 
to seven days before an event.
 
Figure 8-14: 
The My 
Calendar 
Options 
window.
 
I’ll pencil you in
When you’re ready to add an event to your calendar, select the date on the 
main calendar to the left of the My Calendar page (take a quick look back at 
Figure 8-13) and click the Add button next to the time closest to your planned 
entry. The window shown in Figure 8-15 will come up, and you’ll be ready to 
enter your information.

142
Part II: The MySpace Community 
 
Figure 8-15: 
Creating a 
new event.
 
Filling in the info is practically a no-brainer:
 
1. Give your calendar entry a title.
 
 It could be anything from “Take the dog for a walk” to “Show up for your 
job interview, fool!” You can also assign a category from the drop-down 
list just below the Title field. Your choices range from “MySpace Event” 
to “Bill Payment.” (They think of everything, don’t they?)
 
2. Use the drop-down lists to set up the time and duration of the appointment.
 
 If this will be a recurring event, you can also set the event to happen 
automatically over a period of time — set it to occur every other day, 
every week, the first Tuesday of every month, every thousand years 
(just kidding), whatever works for you. Just use the drop-down lists to 
make it happen.
 
3. If you don’t have reminders set by default, ask for one here.
 
 Again, you get the needed notification via either your MySpace e-mail or 
your external e-mail, or both. This calendar does whatever it takes to 
get you wherever you need to go (that information can be included in 
the calendar as well).
 
4. Decide whether you want to share this information with others.
 
 You have several options here:
 
• If you make it public, people viewing your page can see what 
you’re doing.
 
• If you’re not absolutely sure you want people to know what you’re 
up to (“Hey, Steve, I didn’t know you were a fan of Disney on Ice!”), 
mark it private.

143
 Chapter 8: Staying on Schedule with MySpace
 
• You can also choose to mark the time as busy or not. That way 
people will know, when they’re scheduling their own events, 
whether you’re available.
 
 Click the Save button at the bottom of the page, and your event is 
entered, ready to rock.
 
When your calendar is made public, everybody can see it. If you’re a minor, 
it’s a good idea to keep your calendar private and just tell your friends where 
you’ll be. If you’re a parent, make sure the details of your child’s calendar are 
private. MySpace keeps profiles for minors private by default, but this is an 
important step to follow as well.
But wait, there’s more!
Any events you schedule or accept can be added to your calendar automati-
cally. MySpace does a good job of integrating the various functions of these 
tools, so you don’t have to worry about missing an appointment. There’s a link 
to your Events page in the top-right corner of the My Calendar screen (refer to 
Figure 8-13), and there’s a My Calendar link in the top-right corner of the My 
Events screen (refer to Figure 8-2). Furthermore, when you RSVP for an event, 
look for the Add to My Calendar button (refer to Figure 8-11) to instantly add 
the event. No messy cut-and-paste jobs here — it’s all taken care of!

Chapter 9
Getting In with the In-Crowd
In This Chapter
 Joining and creating MySpace groups
 Posting and replying to classified ads
 Participating in online forums
 Joining communities based around your school or work
 Letting others know what you think about your professors
Joining MySpace is a great way to meet different people with interests 
similar to yours. Just because they’re in Hawaii doesn’t mean you can’t 
talk about your favorite albums or movies or books. You can search for other 
folks on the basis of their hobbies and favorite things individually, but you 
can also look for groups of people who enjoy what you do. In fact, you can do 
more with these groups than you can alone. There’s strength in numbers!
Understanding MySpace Groups
MySpace users can form groups that link people with common interests 
together. Take a look at the groups already available on MySpace (as shown 
in Figure 9-1) by clicking the Groups link at the top of your MySpace page.
Quite a huge list, isn’t it? There are literally hundreds of thousands of groups 
for you to look at and possibly join. These groups are based around everything 
from neighborhood locations to schools to religions to the occasional supper 
club. You should be able to find something in here that will appeal to you.
It’s time to narrow down this overwhelming mass to something a little more 
manageable. Say you’re interested in music (pretty safe bet if you’re like most 
of us). You can either click the Music link on the Groups page to sort out all the 
music groups available or you can enter the type of music you’re interested in 
(oh, I do hope it’s polka!) in the Keyword field at the bottom of the screen.

146
Part II: The MySpace Community 
 
Figure 9-1: 
The master 
list of all 
MySpace 
groups, by 
category.
 
Just see what comes up when you click the Music link. You’ll get a screen 
that looks like Figure 9-2.
 
Figure 9-2: 
A sample 
viewing of 
MySpace 
music 
groups.
 
In this case, MySpace brings up the top ten most popular MySpace music 
groups, and there are over 36,700 more pages to go. You can sort through 
these groups by clicking the number of the page you want to move to at the 
top of the list or by clicking Next to get to the next page in line. You can also 
sort groups by newest formed or alphabetically, by clicking Newest or Group 
Name, respectively.
Joining up
Go ahead, join a group and see what it’s all about (not exactly the official 
MySpace motto, but close enough). Click the Join Group link next to a group 

147
 Chapter 9: Getting In with the In-Crowd
you’re interested in. After confirming that you do want to join this group, 
you’re admitted as a member and taken to the group’s main page, as shown 
in Figure 9-3.
 
Figure 9-3: 
The main 
page for 
your new 
group.
 
From here, you can look at profiles for all those who are part of your group. 
Contact them, chat, communicate — it’s what MySpace is all about! You can 
also see a forum where you can discuss issues (we discuss forums in the sec-
tion — you guessed it — “Taking a Look at Forums,” later in this chapter) and 
a bulletins section. By clicking the View All Group Bulletins link, you can see 
the messages that the group members have sent to everyone on the member-
ship list. You can also send your own bulletin from here by clicking the Post 
Group Bulletin link.
 
You’re all in a group because you have common interests. It’s better to keep 
group bulletins related to the reason the group exists. You don’t want to 
annoy your new friends with messages they’re not interested in.
Starting your own
Out of all those groups, you can find something you’re interested in. Still, there’s 
the remote possibility that your interests aren’t represented on MySpace, or 
maybe you just want to set up a private group for you and some friends. The list 
of groups on MySpace is always growing, and there is no reason you shouldn’t 
start your own — which you can do by following these steps:
 
1. On the main Groups page (refer to Figure 9-1), click the Create Group 
link in the top-left corner of the screen.
 
 You see the Create a Group on MySpace window, as shown in Figure 9-4.

148
Part II: The MySpace Community 
 
Figure 9-4: 
Creating 
your own 
group.
 
 
2. Give your group a descriptive name.
 
 You want the name to sum up the group you’re starting in a few words. 
MySpace also requires you to pick a category for your group to fall into. 
Although you may have several interests represented within the group, 
there should be a single category it best fits into. For example, half your 
group’s members may swear the other half’s cars couldn’t stand up to 
their cars in a race, but they can all agree that they love automobiles — 
so that’s the category for your group: automobiles.
 
3. Specify who gets to join your group.
 
 From here on out, you get to exercise a little control:
 
• Decide whether you’ll let just anybody join by clicking Yes or No 
for the Open Join field. Yes means the door is open — anybody 
wanting to join is automatically accepted. This can be a great way 
to bring in people you might never hear from otherwise, but you 
never know exactly who will show up. This can make for uncertain 
group interactions, especially if someone is just looking to cause 
problems. No means that you invite each and every member to the 
group. You’ll only get those you want in the group, but that can be 
a limited number if you don’t meet a lot of people. It also means 
you’ll have to manually approve everybody who wants to join, 
which can take some time. (Think about this carefully before you 
make a decision.)
 
• You can choose to hide the group from uninvited eyes. Not only 
will people not be able to join without your approval, but they 
won’t even be able to see that the group exists. This works best 
if you just want to have a few friends in your group and not have 
your discussions made public. (It’s great for conspiracy theorists 
or incurable gossips, but. . . .)

149
 Chapter 9: Getting In with the In-Crowd
 
 Even though your group may be hidden or private, things you post 
on MySpace (and the Internet in general) don’t always stay private 
or confidential. Somebody in your group could show somebody 
else, or your screen could be seen by someone else if you’re post-
ing in a public place such as a library or coffee shop. Always be 
careful with the information you put anywhere on the Internet.
 
4. Specify what you want to let the members do while they’re in your group.
 
 Here’s where you get to decide
 
• Whether members can invite others in (otherwise, those decisions 
are all up to you)
 
• Whether your forum is made public
 
• Whether members can post bulletins or images
 
• Whether the material in your group is acceptable to show to those 
under 18
 
5. When MySpace asks, provide a general location for the group (includ-
ing city and country) and a description of the group.
 
 Keep in mind what the long and short descriptions are used for:
 
• The short description is shown to anybody who happens to be 
looking at the public listing for the group.
 
• The long description is reserved for those who are actually looking 
at the group’s main page.
 
• You can only post pictures, links, and other HTML-related informa-
tion in the long description.
 
6. Enter the URL for your group. It should follow this format:
http://groups.myspace.com/(yourgroupnamehere)
 
 Using this address, you can get directly to your group’s page — as can 
anybody else.
 
7. Answer the security question.
 
 You’re asked to enter a series of letters or numbers at this point. The 
test is known as a CAPTCHA, and it helps keep out spammers and other 
automated nuisances that can ruin the MySpace experience.
 
8. Click the Create Group button.
 
 Your new club is officially formed!

150
Part II: The MySpace Community 
Managing your group
So now what? You have a club and maybe a few members. It’s time to see 
how you can get your club started and get others participating.
Posting pictures
There’s a section for posting images if you think your group might want to 
see them. You may even be asked to start uploading photos right after you 
create the group. If you’re in a car group, post some pictures of your latest 
trip to the dealership. A music group might appreciate seeing your snapshots 
from a concert. Let your imagination run wild. Post images here the same 
way you do in your personal profile (for more information, see Chapter 10), 
and your group can also have a default image the same way your profile 
does. If you’re interested in posting pictures to your group, click the Upload 
Image link on your group’s main page.
Inviting others to join
Click the Groups link at the top of your profile page, select My Groups 
from the menu on the upper-left side of the page, and click the name of 
your group. You should notice a Moderator image just below your picture. 
Congratulations on your new title!
In the top-right of your page, click the Invite Others button, as shown in 
Figure 9-5. You can select people off your Friend List to invite, or you can 
search for other MySpace users to bring in. After they accept (hey, why not 
be optimistic here?), they can see your group and participate in the bulletins, 
forums, and pictures your group hosts (provided you’ve activated those 
options).
 
Figure 9-5:
 Use the 
Invite 
Others

The Invite Others button
Posting a bulletin
People in your computing group might want to hear about the sale they’re 
having at an online site, or your Italian movie group would probably like to 
know about the film festival going on right now just down the road from you. 

151
 Chapter 9: Getting In with the In-Crowd
Send out periodic updates about your group and the members, too. This 
keeps everybody in the loop and aids discussion about the topic your group 
formed around. To post a bulletin for your group, click the Post Bulletin link 
on your group’s main page. For more on bulletins, see Chapter 5.
Posting a topic
If you have the urge to post a topic for your group, click the Post Topic link 
on your group’s main page. This command sets up a discussion topic in your 
forum. Group members can post about that topic, and you can get a dialogue 
going from there. We talk more about this in the section “Taking a Look at 
Forums,” later in this chapter.
Keeping your group focused
If your group is just a bunch of friends trading stories, jokes, and pictures, 
you’ve already found your focus. Enjoy! If it’s something a little different — 
say, a group of book fans — try to keep the discussion focused on those mat-
ters. If there seems to be not much purpose or focus within the group, people 
tend to lose interest — and then they stop checking back in. The title of 
Moderator means it’s your responsibility to guide the discussion and activi-
ties along. You don’t have to be heavy-handed about it, but a little effort to 
keep things coherent doesn’t hurt. Just make sure the group gets the gentle 
direction it needs — and you can let the members take it from there.
 
You can also go back and change the settings of your group at any time 
by clicking the Edit Group link on the group’s main page. Only you, the 
Moderator, can make these changes.
Utilizing the Classified Ads
MySpace can be a resource in connecting people with jobs, apartments, and 
the odd comic book you’d never thought would show up in your lifetime. These 
classified ads work just like the ones in the back of your local newspaper, with a 
few key exceptions:
 
 They’re free to post.
 
 Anybody in the world can read them.
 
 You can get an instant response from anybody regarding your item or 
service.
In this section, you find out how to post your own ad and get it out to the 
hundreds of thousands of MySpace users. You also discover how to answer 
these ads safely and effectively, so that both sides are happy with the trans-
actions. Best of all, there’s no newspaper to recycle when you’re done. 
Advertise away!

152
Part II: The MySpace Community 
Browsing the ads
Click the Classifieds link at the top of your MySpace profile page to get 
started. There’s a huge list of available categories, as well as links for posting 
your own ads, as shown in Figure 9-6.
 
Figure 9-6: 
The 
MySpace 
Classifieds 
window.
 
 You’ll notice that not only are items for sale listed,   but also services,   jobs,   real 
estate, personal ads, and more. The Classifieds window provides a place for 
people to connect for a wide variety of goods and services. It’s a huge virtual 
bazaar, minus that weird guy in the tent who sports a fez and tries to sell you 
a monkey’s paw.
The ads shown will automatically default to your hometown (based on the 
info you provided when you signed up for the account) for your convenience, 
but you can click the Change City link to see other available listings. This 
can be helpful if you’re moving to a new city and need to see some available 
apartments.
Again, the Classifieds window allows you to sort ads in much the same way 
you did with Groups — either by entering a keyword or selecting a category. 
Clicking a top-level category like Cars For Sale from the drop-down list will 
show you all the entries in that category; clicking Motorcycles will only 
reveal those bikes that appeal to the daredevil in you. You could also type 
Harley in the keyword field, use the drop-down list below that field to select 
Cars for Sale, and click the Search button to narrow down your search even 
further. After you click the Search button, your results will be displayed in a 
screen similar to that shown in Figure 9-7.

153
 Chapter 9: Getting In with the In-Crowd
 
Okay, we know a Harley isn’t a “car” — but sometimes you just have to play 
along with the categories as they are. Take a look at those drop-down lists to 
get a feel for what usually shows up in the category you’re searching. It’s also 
possible somebody will put the item you’re looking for in the wrong category. 
Checking around may help you find it.
 
Figure 9-7: 
A list of 
MySpace 
classified 
ads.
 
Click the ad you want to see and go from there. The ads should include a 
firm or negotiable price, a description of the item, and contact information 
from  the seller. If it’s something you’re interested in,   go ahead and contact the 
seller. MySpace hosts the ad, but it’s not an auction service along the lines of 
eBay — it’s up to you to make it work.
 
Be careful when contacting sellers; take precautions that enable you to see 
or receive the item in question before you send money. More often than not, 
you’re dealing with strangers — and although MySpace is a pretty friendly 
place, you don’t want to be ripped off!
Posting an ad
Time to get rid of some old clothes or that ugly coffee table? You can post 
a free classified ad on MySpace! Just click the Post Ad link in the top-right 
corner of the main Classified page and then fill in the information on the 
screen, as shown in Figure 9-8.

154
Part II: The MySpace Community 
 
Figure 9-8: 
Posting an 
ad in the 
MySpace 
classifieds.
 
Take note that there are a few guidelines MySpace requires ads to follow. Pay 
attention to these, and your ad will stay up for all to see. Disobey the rules, and 
it’ll be deleted. These guidelines are designed to prevent people from posting 
the same ad in multiple categories or posting the same thing several times 
in a row and cluttering the screen. It also prevents people from posting adult 
content or scams. Use the drop-down lists to select the correct category and 
subcategory for your item (that coffee table, for example, would fall under For 
Sale and Furniture), and enter the price range you’re looking for and the neigh-
borhood or city you’re located in.
Now, enter a descriptive subject (“TAKE MY COFFEE TABLE!”) and type a 
description of the item. You can also upload a picture of the item for buyers 
to check out. Click the Preview link to see what your ad will look like and 
then either click Edit to change it or click Post to see your ad made public.
 
People looking at your ad can contact you through your MySpace profile. You 
can add other contact information to your ad if you want, but keep anything 
you don’t want people to know about you out of the ad.
Managing your ads
By clicking the My Ads link in the top-right corner of the Classifieds page, 
you’ll see a list of all the ads you’ve posted. From here, you can click each ad 
to modify or delete it. It’s best to take ads down after the sale’s been conducted 
to avoid clutter and confusion down the line. It’s also a good idea to occasionally 

155
 Chapter 9: Getting In with the In-Crowd
change ads that have been up for a while to attract new interest. If you’re 
selling a service, reword the ad to attract new attention through different 
keywords. You may also lower or raise the price of an item as you go. In any 
case, make sure the information in your ad is always current. It will benefit 
both you and the buyer immensely.
Replying to ads
Each ad is linked to a MySpace profile, so the easiest way to respond to an 
ad is to click the seller’s profile from the ad and send that person a message. 
If he’s included other contact information in the ad, you can also try that. 
Include a brief mention of the ad and your interest and then wait for a reply. 
Don’t be obnoxious by sending several messages or demanding a reduction 
in price. If the seller is open to negotiation, he or she will usually say so in 
the ad — and if the seller says the price is firm, don’t be a pain by trying to 
dicker anyway.
Taking a Look at Forums
Without getting deep into Roman history and a bunch of politicians arguing 
over democracy and toga styles, a forum is basically a place for holding a dis-
cussion and debate over the issues of the day. In this case, though, you don’t 
have to go to some stone ruins and understand Latin. An electronic forum 
lets you post your messages online and allows others to talk about them from 
there. It can be a great way to discover and discuss things important to you 
in a public place — without actually having to drive or fly or organize a big 
meeting (so it can also be a great way to save gas). Okay, it’s not a real-time 
discussion, but it does make possible some conversations that might not get 
the chance to happen otherwise.
Explaining forums
If you’ve seen what forums look like at the bottom of the Group pages — and 
that clicking the Post Topic link on your Group page will make an entry on 
those forums — you have the gist of it. That’s basically how forums work. 
They contain a series of discussion topics, and group members can post 
replies to those topics (and other replies, and replies to those replies). 
Eventually, discussion topics can go on for several posts and pages.
 
It’s always a good idea to click the View All Topics link and run a search on 
a topic in these forums before posting your topic. You don’t want to annoy

Note, however, that forums aren’t limited to groups. Click the Forum link 
at the top of your profile page to see other topics that are available to all 
MySpace users, as shown in Figure 9-9. The forum controls will work similarly 
in both the Group page and your profile page — but in this case, we focus on 
the main forums found when you use the link on your profile page.
 
Figure 9-9: 
The 
MySpace 
Forums 
page.
 
Let the discussion begin! Pick a forum topic that interests you and check out 
the discussions going on. For example, look at the Computers & Technology 
forum, as shown in Figure 9-10.
 
It just makes good sense to read a few posts on a particular forum before you 
toss your two cents in. If you can get a handle on the discussion beforehand, 
you’re a lot more likely to say something relevant when you do post. But you 
knew that.

 Chapter 9: Getting In with the In-Crowd
There are four different folders for this forum. Keep it straightforward and 
choose the main Computers forum, which takes you to the screen shown in 
Figure 9-11.
 
Figure 9-11: 
The 
Computers 
forum.
 
Here’s where you actually see the topics being discussed. You’ll see the topic 
that’s received the most recent reply at the top — and you can scroll through 
the topics in one of two ways:
 
 Choosing page numbers from the top of the list
 
 Clicking Next at the top of the page
When you see something interesting, click the topic’s name and you’re taken 
right to that topic, as shown in Figure 9-12.
From here, you can engage in a discussion with the poster or anybody else 
who’s replied to the original topic. Just think of it as reading a bunch of notes 
and leaving a note of your own that furthers the discussion. It’s not the easi-
est way to hold a conversation, but it can go further than normal conversa-
tions because it doesn’t have to happen in real time or within the confines of 
a building or a phone call. You can have time to think, research, and respond.
If you want to post a reply to a message, click the Post a Reply link on the 
left side of the page or the Reply button in the message itself. Type your 
message, click Post Reply at the bottom of the page, and you’re ready to go. 

158
Part II: The MySpace Community 
If you want to back out, click Cancel. Also note that you can click the Quote 
link, which includes the original text you were replying to in your post. This 
can help keep the discussion clear and focused. If you don’t quote the text, 
there’s no guarantee that your reply will show up near the post you were 
commenting on, and things can get confusing.
 
Figure 9-12: 
A sample 
topic.
 
If you want to start your own topic, click the Post Topic link on the forum’s 
page and enter the title and text of your topic. It’s as simple as posting a 
reply, but you’re the one starting the discussion.
 
Check around the forum for topics that are similar to the one you want to 
discuss — before you post a new topic. This little bit of discreet prep work 
will help keep things organized and helpful.
 
It’s easy to get angry and say harmful things when you’re not actually face to 
face with the person on the other side of the argument. Discussions can some-
times get heated, but it’s best to remain polite and remember that it’s just an 
online conversation and MySpace is supposed to be fun. Don’t get too heavy 
with it — or take it too seriously.
Why should we use the forums?
You’ve already seen how to post topics and replies on these discussion 
forums. But why would you want to? There are several reasons these online 
discussions can be helpful. Take a look at a few:

159
 Chapter 9: Getting In with the In-Crowd
 
 Opinions: Forums are a great chance to express opinions and viewpoints 
on topics that are important to you. No matter what your inter  ests,  from 
politics to knitting,   you have a viewpoint. Express it! Just be sure to do so 
in a polite and respectful manner and be prepared to discuss it. After all, 
 you’re telling your opinions to people around the nation — possibly around 
the world — and there will always be people who want to agree or disagree 
with you. That’s the great thing about online discussions. You might never 
know what these people think — and they might not get a look at what you 
think — without these forums.
 
 Like interests: Someone will always know as much or more than you 
about certain topics online. Imagine getting to pick that person’s brain 
about things you like but might have never heard about before. You 
could discover things you never knew before or pick up tips about cre-
ating that perfect song or painting or hot rod. Hanging around forums 
with people interested in the same things means you’ll discover and 
share more. You’ll also make contacts with people who could help you 
with activities related to MySpace. Just because you’re making contact 
electronically doesn’t mean the contact has to disappear suddenly; it’s 
entirely possible to share friendships with these people.
Chat versus forums
 On the main page of the forums,  you’ll see a Chat Room link next to each main 
category. Whereas the forums are a series of topics and replies meant to be 
viewed days and weeks from now,   the Chat function is real-time conversation, 
 as shown in Figure 9-13. These discussions won’t be saved,   but then,   you’ll be 
talking to people live — it’s a lot more immediate than leaving a note.
 
Figure 9-13: 
A chat 
room.
 

160
Part II: The MySpace Community 
There’s a main Waiting Room and different “rooms” for specific discussions. 
Just click the room you want to go to and select Join. Anything you type in 
the bottom field will be sent to everyone in the room, but you can click some-
one’s name to send a message to just that person. Feel free to introduce yourself 
and talk about whatever’s appropriate to the room. This conversation moves 
fast, so be prepared to stick around. If you just want to say something and come 
back to a discussion later, it’s probably best to stick with a forum.
 
Make sure your message goes only to the person it was intended for. Sending 
private information to everybody in a chat room is a classic newbie mistake — 
it can be seriously embarrassing.
School and Work Communities
Depending on where you work or go to school, there may already be a com-
munity for you on MySpace. When you first created your profile, you were 
asked to enter your occupation and any schools you attended. Those groups 
will appear at the bottom left of your profile (just below the Entertainment 
and Mobile sections in the left column — MySpace certainly has its priorities 
in line), and you can click them to see any community available to you. Take 
a look at a school profile, such as the one shown in Figure 9-14.
 
Figure 9-14: 
An example 
of a school 
community 
— just one 
of many.
 

161
 Chapter 9: Getting In with the In-Crowd
This community is just like any other group on MySpace, except it’s centered 
on your current or former school. Here you’ll find a list of people who also 
attended or are currently going to your school, and there’s a forum of topics 
related to that institution. You can link up with old classmates or discuss 
how things are going at your school. There are also sections for people look-
ing for roommates, apartments, and textbooks. This is a great place to link up 
with current students or alumni.
Rate Your Professor
You may be salivating at the thought to bash a former or current teacher right 
now, but it’s important to remember why this function is here. Students have 
always given other students going into classes a little advice about how to deal 
with their teachers — and general evaluations on classes in general have been 
around for a long time. This is just a place to do it electronically. It’s important to 
be truthful and fair here — you’d want the same information, honestly offered 
and (hopefully) reliable, if you were asking about a professor, wouldn’t you? 
It’s also good to remember that professors and teachers are people too (what a 
concept!) — and they could be reading your comments.
In your school profile, look at the top left of the page for the Grade My 
Professor section and click the Start Grading Now! link. You’ll see an alpha-
betical list of the professors at your school, as shown in Figure 9-15.
 
Figure 9-15:
 The 
alphabetical 
list of 
professors.
 

162
Part II: The MySpace Community 
You have several options from here:
 
 To search by the last name of the professor, click the letter at the top of 
the list.
 
 To search by department, click the drop-down list marked Search by 
Department.
 
 If you don’t see your professor listed, click Add a Professor at the top-
left of the screen.
 
 If you’re in the wrong school, click Find Another School.
Each professor has an average grade next to his or her name, as well as 
the prof’s department, the number of grades, and the date the last grade 
was issued. Read what other students have to say and click the Grade This 
Professor link to add your own grade. You’re asked for the class you took from 
the prof, overall comments, and a grade for each of the following categories:
 
 Lectures
 
 Homework
 
 Tests
 
 Fairness
 
 Grading
 
 Accessibility
These grades are averaged with those from other people reviewing the 
professor and compiled for an overall profile on this teacher.
 
Be respectful and truthful. This can be as good of a resource as you make it.

t’s not called MySpace for just any old reason. It is 
indeed your space. This white-and-blue-and-silver color 
scheme is certainly pleasant, but it’s kind of boring and it 
has to go. First thing you need to do is put up a cool pic-
ture of yourself. Maybe get that one your friend snapped 
while you were laughing — the one your friends say looks 
most like you. Then grab a song to add to your page. Just 
one click and you can add that Green Day song you like. 
Or one from your cousin’s band.
That’s a good start. Now let’s add your favorite football 
team’s logo as a background, change the font to some-
thing cool, and rearrange things so your Friends List is at 
the top of the page. There — now, that’s a MySpace page 
to show off.
Directions for doing all these things — or turning your 
own ideas into MySpace reality — follow. Read on and 
happy customizing.

ySpace is a great place to show off your favorite photos. From simple 
self-portraits to vacation photos to what happened at the party last 
night (okay, some of what happened at the party), you can put just about 
everything you want on MySpace for public display. You can also use your 
page as a place to host your images for use on other sites as well. Let’s get 
you ready for your close-up!
 
MySpace does require users to register before they can see photos on your 
profile page.
Getting Your Pictures 
Ready for MySpace
Any picture you have on your computer, digital camera, cell phone, or other 
device (and any content within reason, which we’ll get to in a minute) can 
probably be shared on MySpace. There are just a few considerations to take 
into account before you start putting your images on the site. When you clear 
all these hurdles, you’re ready to go.

166
Part III: Customizing MySpace 
Using the correct file format
MySpace recognizes the most common photo file formats. That means that 
no matter what little letters trail off the names of your photos, MySpace can 
more than likely handle it. The allowed file formats include
 
 JPEG (.jpg)
 
 GIF (.gif)
 
 Bitmap (.bmp)
 
 TIFF (.tiff or .tif)
 
 PNG (.png)
No matter what file format you choose, though, remember that the file size 
has to be less than 5MB. Larger files have to be reduced in size before they 
can be uploaded. As big as the Internet seems to be, there’s still only so 
much space it can give to that picture of you falling off that mechanical bull 
from your vacation.
 
MySpace recommends using the IrfanView program, available at www.
download.com. This program helps resize and reformat your pictures into
a usable picture on MySpace. You can also use commercial programs like 
Adobe Photoshop, Macromedia Fireworks, or GIMP (http://gimp.org) 
to change your images. Finally, most digital cameras come with software that 
allows you to manipulate your pictures. Use whatever feels easiest to you.
To convert your picture into a nice, compact .gif or .jpg with IrfanView, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Open IrfanView.
 
2. Choose File➪Open and then navigate to your image.
 
3. Click Open to open the file.
 
4. Choose File➪Save As. The Save Picture As dialog box appears, as 
shown in Figure 10-1.
 
 You can keep the filename the same or change it, but you must select 
either .gif or .jpg in the Save as Type drop-down list.
 
5. Click Save.

167
 Chapter 10: Your MySpace Photo Album
 
Figure 10-1: 
Converting 
your picture 
to the 
correct file 
format.
 
Making sure you have the right file size
MySpace requires that your pictures be less than 5MB in size. Size, in this 
case, refers to the overall file size — how much storage space it takes up on 
a computer — not the actual length and width of the picture. The basic 5MB 
should provide plenty of room for your snapshots. If your pictures exceed 
5MB, use photo-manipulation software or IrfanView to get them down to an 
acceptable file size. You can also try setting the dpi (dots per inch) of the 
photo to 72. That should make a huge difference in your photo’s file size.
To get your picture into the correct file size with IrfanView, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Open IrfanView.
 
2. Choose File➪Open in the top menu and navigate to your image.
 
3. Click Open to open the file.
 
4. Choose Image➪Resize/Resample in the top menu bar.
 
5. Set the DPI at 72, and change the length and width of the picture to 
smaller values, as shown in Figure 10-2.
 
 Make sure the Preserve Aspect Ratio check box is selected, as this will 
keep your pictures from looking stretched out or unnatural.

168
Part III: Customizing MySpace 
 
Figure 10-2:

picture the

size.
 
 
6. Choose File➪Save As.
 
 You can keep the filename the same or change it, but you must select 
either .gif or .jpg in the Save as Type drop-down list.
 
7. Click Save.
Naming your photo file
Keep the filename simple — it’s okay to run the words together. Something 
like Dayatthebeach.jpg works just fine. MySpace has problems if you try 
to use spaces — or, for that matter, symbols such as dashes or dollar signs. 
Change the name if you have to before uploading the picture.
Adhering to the content policy
The Internet is home to all manners of strange, beautiful, shocking, and downright 
disturbing images. MySpace will have none of that, thank you. The site bans adult 
content on its servers, and you can lose your account if you violate the policy. 
Before you post your picture, determine first whether it falls in the PG or R 
category. More than likely, an R rating will cause problems. MySpace will also 

169
 Chapter 10: Your MySpace Photo Album
delete any pictures that include contact information (such as a phone number, 
address, or Web site URL); think about that for a minute and you’ll see the 
wisdom of it.
 
You can’t use a home computer to host pictures you intend to be viewed 
on the Internet. To be seen by others, the pics have to be on MySpace or on 
another Web site.
Finding Places to Host Your Images
There are other places to host your pictures on the Internet beyond 
MySpace. Hosting sites exist solely to give your digital images a home on 
the Internet so you can hotlink to them on other Web sites, like MySpace or 
other forums, and send links to friends and relatives (“Oh, those wedding 
photos are so BEAUTIFUL! When are you giving me grandkids?”). You upload 
photos from your computer to these sites (usually after registering for an 
account) and use their links to send out your photos. Please read each site’s 
agreements and policies carefully — most of these accounts will have dif-
ferences between free and paid hosting solutions; some limit the amount of 
data they’ll let you transmit (the capacity that geeks call the bandwidth) on a 
monthly basis, depending on the option you’ve chosen.
Two of the most popular sites are Flickr (http://flickr.com) and 
Photobucket (http://photobucket.com), although other sites are out 
there. Take the time to investigate these services and find one that works for 
you. These are great alternatives to MySpace — especially if you’ll be posting 
large quantities of photos or sending them to people (there must be a few) 
who don’t use MySpace.
What to add and what not to add
MySpace profiles are associated directly with 
you, and what you put on the site is a direct 
reflection on yourself. You’re the only one in 
control, after all. Therefore it’s important to 
remember that what pictures you put up on 
your site can come back to haunt you if you’re 
not careful. It’s great to post pictures of your 
friends and the fun times you have with them, 
but posting pictures of illegal activities can get 
you in trouble — not only with MySpace, but 
with the law. Keep in mind that anybody brows-
ing MySpace can see your profile. Anybody. 
Think about what potential employers or rela-
tives can see, and you have a decent test as to 
what picture you should put up. Just because 
it’s on the ’Net doesn’t mean it doesn’t affect 
you IRL (in real life).

Beam Me Up! — Loading Your 
Photos on MySpace
When you’re sure your photos are ready to be pushed forth on the unsus-
pecting world, it’s time to upload them. This is a simple process that trans-
fers a copy of the picture from your computer to MySpace. A few clicks, and 
you’re on your way.
To load your photos on MySpace, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Photos button in the Control Panel of your profile page, as 
shown in Figure 10-3.
 
2. Click the Upload Photos button.
 
 You’ll see this button at the top of page, near your profile photo in the 
left corner.
 
3. Click the Browse button found next to the text field in the Photo 
Upload box (as shown in Figure 10-4) and find the picture you want to 
upload from your computer.
 
 You have the option to upload several photos at one time. Just repeat 
this step until you’ve added all the pictures you want to put on 
MySpace. You’ll see the names of the files in the right field. All of those 
will be uploaded when you’re finished.

4. Click the Next button and choose what album you want to place the 
new photos in, as shown in Figure 10-5.
 
 You already have a generic photo album on your page labeled My 
Photos. In case you want to get a little more specific, you can always 
create a new photo album. This allows you to group like photos together 
in one album with a descriptive name so you or other people can find 
the photos you’re looking for without searching through every single 
photo you’ve uploaded.
 
5. Click the Upload button and upload your photos.
 
 MySpace will show the progress of each of your uploads and show you 
the album after you’re done. You’ll also have the option to add tags to 
each photo at this point, and you can always add more tags later (see 
the section “Tag, You’re It!,” later in this chapter).

Managing Your Photo Page
Great! Your photos are uploaded — now what do you do? You have a few 
options from here, and you can do them all using the control buttons in each 
photo album, as shown in Figure 10-6. Click the album you want to modify, 
and you’ll see the controls just above the individual photos in the album.
 
Note that the selections you make with these buttons apply to all the photos 
in your album. Choose wisely.
 
Figure 10-6: 
The controls

Click the Options button to bring up the fields you need to change the 
album’s properties. You can assign a new name to the album, give the album 
a location, and set whether the album can be viewed by only you, your 
friends, or the world at large, as shown in Figure 10-7.
 
Figure 10-7:

All your photos will appear under the controls in each photo album. Click a 
photo to see the actions you can perform on that image:
 
 Set as Default: Only one picture can be the default photo at a time. This 
photo is the one that shows up in the upper-left corner of your profile 
when anybody views it. This is usually a picture of you, but you can feel 
free to use others if you choose.

173
 Chapter 10: Your MySpace Photo Album
 
 Use as Album Cover: Click this button to make the photo the one that 
appears on the album’s icon. You can choose any photo in the album, 
and you can also select any section of that photo.
 
 Move Photo: If you want to change the location of a photo from one 
album to another, click this button. Just as when you uploaded the 
photo, you’re asked to put it in a new album or create a new one.
 
 Delete Photo: If a picture has outlived its usefulness, click the Delete 
button, and it’ll be gone. You’ll be prompted to confirm your decision. 
Use this if you just want to clear a little space, too.
 
 Tag Photo: This button (or the link above the photo) allows you to tag 
the photo with a note or the name of one of your friends. You can also 
e-mail this photo to someone you know. See the section “Tag, You’re It!,” 
later in this chapter.
 
 Edit Caption: Click the Edit link below the photo to add or change a 
caption for the photo. This is your chance to add a brief description 
or comment to the image.
You can do some other things with your MySpace photos as well, such as 
viewing and editing comments from other MySpacers or creating a slide show:
 
 Comments: People will have the option to leave comments on your 
photos if you’ve made them public. You can view these comments by 
clicking the View My Pics link in the top-left corner of your profile page 
and then clicking a photo. You’ll see a full-size version of your photo 
and any comments that have been left, along with the profile name and 
default profile of the user that left the comment. If you like the com-
ment, do nothing. If you don’t like it, there’s a small Delete link next to 
the comment, as shown in Figure 10-8. Click it, confirm that you want to 
delete, and the comment is gone forever.
 
 Slide Show!: No, don’t run in fear or dread the thought of Aunt Mildred’s 
vacation photos. This slide show just puts together a constantly moving 
presentation of all your uploaded photos. Why have just one static photo 
when you can exhibit all your work in full color and motion? Click the 
Create Slideshow link on the My Albums page you use to upload photos, 
as shown in Figure 10-9.

 You’ll be presented with a series of options to create your slide show 
(as shown in Figure 10-10), starting with the album you want to include 
(or whether you want to include all your photos). You can also modify 
the style of the slide show, the dimensions of the show, the color and 
speed of the show, and whether you want to include captions. After you 
make all your choices, copy and paste the code into your main profile. 
(MySpace recommends that you put it in your About Me section, but 
you can put it anywhere that allows HTML.) Your pictures will show up 
there in living color.

You may have to modify the attributes of a slide show slightly just to make it 
fit your profile correctly. After you create it, look at where you’ve placed it on 
your profile and decide what, if anything, you need to change.
Tag, You’re It!
MySpace is all about making connections, and tagging a photo is just another 
way of bringing everything together. Tagging a photo means you’re connecting 
the person in that photo to another MySpace user and providing a link to her 
profile.
To add a tag to a photo, navigate to the photo you want to add a tag to and 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Tag Photo link above the photo.
 
 This appears either as a button at the top of the page or as a link just 
above the photo.
 
2. Using the window that appears over the photo, select the person’s 
face, as shown in Figure 10-11.
 
 Resize the window as necessary to include the person’s entire face.
 
3. Select the person from your Friend List and click Save.
 
 You can tag as many faces in the photo as you wish.
 
Figure 10-11: 
Tagging 
your photo.
 

176
Part III: Customizing MySpace 
People viewing that photo will now get a link to the profile you tagged when 
they roll their mouse over that person’s face. There’s also a list of tags above 
the photo now. You’ve set up another network that links you and your friends!
 
Make sure that the person you’re tagging wants to be linked to you and be 
sure he or she is okay with having a photo on your page. It’ll avoid a lot of 
problems down the road, and it lets you be respectful of the wishes of others.
What hath MySpace pictures wrought?
Since the birth of MySpace, people have been 
posting their own images on the site. However, a 
few types of images have taken hold, becoming 
unique fixtures of MySpace. Their very appear-
ance signals a MySpace origin — giving it a 
context beyond the actual content of the photo. 
Take a look at a couple of examples.
By far, the most common MySpace shot is the 
“Point the camera at the mirror” self-portrait. 
You have a digital camera and a MySpace 
account, but apparently nobody else is around 
to take a picture of you. Just stand in front of 
the mirror, point, and shoot. Voilà! Not only do 
you have a new default picture, but everybody 
knows you’re on MySpace!
For some strange reason, men seem to just 
throw their shirts off as soon as they know a 
MySpace picture is being taken. Bare-chested 
males are a common feature, apparently want-
ing to show off their amazing muscle definition 
(or not caring if it isn’t there). This tactic seems 
to have backfired, though; most women I know 
find the pictures either cheesy or disgusting. 
But good job on the workouts, guys! Now put 
a shirt on!
Some MySpace profiles don’t even feature an 
actual photo. You can pretty much guarantee 
that once an animated GIF achieves some pop-
ularity or recognition on the Internet, it’ll pop up 
as the default picture on many, many profiles. 
They’ll go away eventually, but for now, you’re 
witnessing a mini-trend.
Finally, there’s the far-too-posed shot. Whether 
it’s the glamour shot from the mall or the 
PERFECT black-and-white photo you took at the 
cemetery, most of these themes have already 
been explored. If you’re looking for a good 
default photo, just be yourself and look natural. 
Or, what the heck, go ahead and put on the lion 
suit. Whatever works for you. Just keep your 
shirt on. Seriously.

O
ne of the quickest — and easiest — ways to add some sparkle and flash 
to your MySpace page is to include some audio and video. Whether the 
files start automatically when you pull up the page for the first time or are 
stored in a separate section of your profile, MySpace has several places for 
you to store your favorite song or that hilarious video of your little cousin 
singing “Tequila” with pantyhose on his head.
This chapter shows you how to place audio and video directly inside your 
main profile page so that they’re readily available to anybody who comes 
across your profile. You can also rate and comment on others’ videos and let 
them do the same to yours. Think of it as the world’s largest private screening.

Tons of bands put songs on MySpace, primarily to help spread the word 
about the music they’re bringing to the world. You won’t want to spend more 
than a few seconds listening to some of the bands, but other artists might 
capture your attention. Or you may run across the perfect song for your 
mood that day and want to share it. This section shows you how to add that 
music to your profile.
Planning your setlist
First, you have to find the song you want to use. Most of your favorite bands 
already have a MySpace page with music on them, so it’s just a matter of find-
ing the right address. The band’s MySpace address could be posted on their 

178
Par t III: Customizing MySpace 
main Web site, or you could search for the name of the band using either the 
MySpace search engine or one like Google.
You can also start exploring your friends and the friends of those friends 
(their MySpace sites, anyway) for bands that just sound right. Part of using a 
social network like MySpace is finding new and different people and groups, 
and this is a great example. By exploring different profiles, you could find a 
song or band you’ve never heard on the radio — and it could turn out to be 
the best thing you’ve heard all year. Take a risk!
Putting on the hits
When you find the perfect musical accompaniment to your profile page, look 
for the Add link next to that song on the site’s jukebox, as shown in Figure 11-1.
 
You do have to be logged in to your MySpace account at this point to add or 
change your song.
 
Figure 11-1: 
Adding a 
song from 
a band’s 
jukebox.
 
The Add link
When you click the Add link and confirm your entry, the song is added to your 
profile page just like that — and it’ll be played every time someone views your 
page. No mess, no muss, no fuss. The song appears as a small player (as shown 
in Figure 11-2), just below your profile picture and Contact box. And you’re not 
stuck with the song forever, either. If you run across another song you want to 
put on your profile, click the Add link next to it. You can only have one song 
linked to your profile (unless you’re in a band and you have your own MySpace 
Music Player — to find out more about creating a MySpace Music Player, see 
Chapter 14), but you can change it as many times as you want. The one button 
on the player allows you to pause or continue playback of the song. Have fun!

179
 Chapter 11: Sound and Movies

appears on 
your profile 
page.
 
 
The Internet is changing all the time (but you knew that). MySpace is no 
exception. So check the song occasionally to make sure the link is still active. 
When a band removes a song from their page, your link will die — and you’ll 
be left with an empty player. When that happens, it’s time to go looking for 
some new tunes.
Adding Video to Your Profile
There are a few ways to add video to your profile, and depending on the way 
you choose, your video can show up in several places within your profile. It’s 
now just as easy as adding a song, and you actually have more control over 
the process. Also, anyone can upload video to their MySpace account, which 
means you can upload your own video and not have to worry about linking to 
somebody else’s profile.
Finding video
Welcome to MySpaceTV, where all the videos on MySpace gather for view-
ing. It’s a huge amount of video, but it also means that your clips are rubbing 
shoulders with original programming from some of television and film’s best!
Finding video is basically the same as finding songs for your profile (see the 
section “Planning your setlist,” earlier in this chapter). Go out and look for it! 
Some users have video uploaded to their profiles, or they have links on their 
pages. Go and see what’s available.
Click the MySpaceTV link in the top-right of your profile page. The next thing 
you see is the main video page with a field for searching out videos by key-
word, as shown in Figure 11-3. Type a few words that pertain to what you’re 
looking for, set the search category to Videos, and then click the Search 
button. You’ll get a list of videos matching your terms, and you can pick and 
choose from there.

180
Par t III: Customizing MySpace 
 
Figure 11-3: 
Searching 
for 
videos on 
MySpace.
 
Search for videos here.
There’s also a tab for the Video Charts, which are videos MySpace users 
have viewed the most, rated the highest, or talked about the most. Check out 
the side of this tab, where you can look for videos based around a general 
subject. Need sports videos? Click that category. Feeling adventurous? Click 
Weird Stuff. It’s up to you. Those categories are also listed on the left of the 
screen, as are links for videos in a multitude of foreign languages. MySpaceTV 
is worldwide! You can always search for keywords using the Search field in 
the upper-right corner of the MySpaceTV section.
Unlike audio, you don’t have to restrict yourself to MySpace videos when 
you’re looking to trick out your profile. Look at any video-hosting service, 
such as YouTube (www.youtube.com), and you should be able to find some-
thing you can use. These services will also include search fields, so look up 
the keywords for your videos there as well. The key is finding the code you 
can embed into your profile. If you find a video on MySpace, the code will be 
located beneath the video, as shown in Figure 11-4. You’ll also get a URL to 
send to your friends in case they want a direct link to the video.
If you find a video on YouTube, the code will be located to the right of the 
video, as shown in Figure 11-5.
This code is important, as it represents the link from that video to your pro-
file. Look at the section “Putting on a show,” later in this chapter, to see how 
to put this video in your profile.

Par t III: Customizing MySpace 
Using your homemade movies
If you have video of your own to put up, MySpace provides space for that. 
You must have the video on your computer, and plenty of digital camcorders, 
cameras, and even cell phones have the ability to put digital video on your 
hard drive. From there, you’re just a few clicks from sharing it with the world.
In MySpaceTV, click the My Videos tab found in the top-right of the page. 
Click the Upload Video link in the top-right of the page (this link is on every 
MySpaceTV page, but this tab helps you see all of your videos, so it’s good to 
start uploading from here) and you’ll see the page shown in Figure 11-6.
 
Figure 11-6: 
The first 
page in 
the video 
upload 
process.
 
Give your video a title and a brief description. Select any categories that apply 
to your video, and type in as many tags as you can to describe your clip. Start 
with the basics, such as “dog”, and work your way up to things like “Pug”, 
“playing”, and “laundry”. The more descriptive your terms, the more likely 
it is that searches will turn up your clip. Also choose whether to make your video 
public or private and whether you agree to the MySpace terms and conditions. 
Public means the video will be indexed and appear in search results and category 
lists. Private means that your video will only be available from your profile, and it 
won’t show up in searches. Click the link to Terms and Conditions to read them, 
and realize that you can’t post video unless you agree to them.
 
It’s written in bright red on every page, so it must be important. Posting 
pornography will get your account deleted without warning, notice, or even
a wave. (Okay, you’ve been made aware. ’Nuff said.)
 
If you marked your video private, categorizing your video won’t apply as 
you’ve already pulled it from any searches.

183
 Chapter 11: Sound and Movies
The final step of the process looks like a cat got loose on your keyboard and 
played for awhile, hitting keys with whimsical randomness. In actuality, these 
jumbled-up messes of letters, as shown in Figure 11-7, are the types of video 
files that will be accepted. Loosely translated, it means MySpace accepts 
most digital video formats — including those associated with Microsoft, 
Apple, and most mobile devices. The only restriction is that the file sizes 
can’t be larger than 100MB.
 
Figure 11-7: 
The last 
step — 
uploading 
your video.
 
Click the Choose File button to find your video file on your computer, and 
after you find it, click the Upload button to transfer the file. Depending on the 
size of your file and the speed of your connection, this can take anywhere 
from a few seconds to several minutes.
Putting on a show
If you’ve uploaded your own video (see the previous section), it’s already part of 
your profile — you can find it by clicking the Videos button in the Control Panel 
on your profile page. This means anybody clicking the Videos link on your 
profile page can view the videos you’ve chosen.
Although people looking at your MySpace profile can find the videos by 
selecting your Videos link, they might not always take the time. If it’s some-
thing you want them to see immediately upon loading your page, you can 
embed the video in various sections of your profile.
Start by cutting and pasting the embedding code from your video, whether 
you’ve uploaded it or snagged it from somewhere else (usually another 
MySpace location or a video-hosting site). Click the Edit Profile link above 
your picture on your profile page and you’ll see text fields for several of the 
sections on your profile, as shown in Figure 11-8. Basically, any of these sec-
tions are fair game for your embedded videos.
If you’ve run across a video of a hero of yours (say, a rock star or Pittsburgh 
Steelers RB Willie Parker making the longest run in Super Bowl history), you 
could include it under the Heroes section of your profile. For Interests, you 

184
Par t III: Customizing MySpace 
might include video of your kids playing. There are many options, and you’re 
only limited by which fields accept HTML coding (see Chapter 12 for more 
information about HTML and customizing profiles).
 
Figure 11-8: 
Choosing 
where to 
embed your 
video.
 
 
Video can stretch out sections of your profile, depending on how wide or long 
it is when it shows up on-screen. To make sure everything still looks okay 
before you post the video, click the Preview Section button under the field 
where you’ve added the video.
 
If even just one letter or number is missing from the embedded code, it won’t 
work. Be sure you highlight the entire section of code when you cut and paste 
it into your profile.
Reviewing and commenting on videos
In addition to viewing the videos on other users’ profile pages, you also get 
the chance to give some feedback about what you’re seeing — and to link 
those videos to other locations. Just use the options available under the 
video, as shown in Figure 11-9.
You can click the MySpace icons below the video to show approval (Booyah!) 
or disapproval (No Way!). You can also click links on the right to perform the 
following actions:
 
 Bulletin This: Allows you to bulletin the video, which sends out a 
bulletin with links to the video.

185
 Chapter 11: Sound and Movies
 
Figure 11-9: 
Commenting 
and rating

Options for commenting
Rating the video
 
 E-mail This: This command sends your friends a link to the video. Just 
add their e-mail addresses and a personal message.
 
 Save to Favorites: This saves the video to your My Favorites section on 
your Videos page.
 
 Blog This: This option works just like the bulletin option — it allows you 
to blog the video, which creates a blog entry on your profile and links it 
to the video.
 
 Add to Profile: This command can sometimes be unreliable. It might be 
better to manually embed the video (see the previous section, “Putting 
on a show”).
 
 Flag as Inappropriate: If you think a video violates the MySpace rules, 
this notifies the authorities to take action. If there really is a problem, 
the video will be pulled and the account may be deleted.
 
Unless you actually host the video yourself, it’s always subject to the whims 
of the person who’s giving it virtual real estate, and it could disappear at any 
time. More than likely, it’ll be available for awhile, and you can safely blog 
about it or put it in your favorites. Check back every so often to make sure the 
video is live, though, and delete any dead links. It’s less frustrating for you and 
your readers that way.
Tuning in to MySpaceTV
Channels and TV stars aren’t just reserved for the airwaves or cable anymore. 
MySpace has gotten so popular that more and more producers are taking their 
original programming to this site instead of to your TV. Click the Channels tab 
at the top of the MySpaceTV section to see everything that’s available. You’ll 
get shows ranging from teen drama to outrageous humor, from celebrity news 
to just about everything in between. There’s no TV Guide to tell you when 
you have to watch these shows. These programs are all available on demand, 
whenever you want to see them.

186
Par t III: Customizing MySpace 
Videos on your profile — made easy
In their never-ending quest to make things 
easier, MySpace also lets you add video to 
your profile the same way you add songs. Under 
each and every video MySpace has on their 
site, you’ll see an Add to My Profile link. Click 
that link, and it’s added automatically to your 
home page. You can also remove it by logging 
in to your profile and clicking the Remove from 
My Profile link under that video. Simple, isn’t 
it? Now everybody can pass along the video 
of your brother injuring himself on the screen 
door. Bob Saget never had it so good.
This function differs from embedded video in 
two very important ways. Although you can 
embed video in any text area in your profile, 
video added by this Add to My Profile link will 
appear only in the creatively-named Video Place 
just above your Comments section. Second, you 
can embed as many videos as you can tolerate 
in your profile. Your Video Space can only fea-
ture one video at a time. Choose wisely.

ecause your MySpace page is basically your own little piece of the 
Internet, you should think of it as your own place — yours to change or 
customize to match your own personal style and personality, like an apart-
ment. You obviously can’t paint the virtual walls or lay down some sassy 
virtual throw rugs, but you can change the way your page looks to those who 
stop by to have a look. Your changes can range from tasteful enhancements 
to radical modifications, depending on your mood and skill. Ultimately, the 
look should reflect a little bit of what you like and what you’re about.
If your MySpace page is your virtual apartment, consider this to be the Do-It-
Yourself chapter. We don’t touch on replacing plumbing or refinishing hard-
wood floors, but we do cover all the basics to quickly and painlessly get your 
space ship-shape so you’ll be comfortably hosting guests before you know it.
Customization Restrictions on MySpace
Just about everything you see on your MySpace page can be changed or 
altered in some way. With just a little extra work, you can change the appear-
ance and sound of your
 
 Background
 
 Text
 
 Different fields in your profile
 
 Audio

188
Par t III: Customizing MySpace 
There are some things MySpace won’t let you change, though. The same 
basic information (About Me, Comments, and so on) has to appear in every 
profile. You can reorder those fields in limited ways by using templates or 
your own CSS (cascading style sheets, explained in the “Doing It Yourself” sec-
tion, later in this chapter), but they’ll always be there.
Furthermore, MySpace checks your profile for inappropriate or pornographic 
images and other disruptive content. Finally, MySpace doesn’t want you 
using code to cover their advertisements or inserts on your page. They have 
to pay the bills somehow, and they’re throwing the party. If you don’t want 
your account to be deleted or changed, it’s best to follow house rules and 
keep it in line.
MySpace has given you the power to add some rooms to your apartment, 
though, using a new open developer’s platform. It’s still in the testing phase 
at the time of this writing, but soon you can add additional applications and 
share information with others in new and different ways, whether you write 
your own code or leave it to the pros. Check out the “See What Develops” 
section later in this chapter for more information.
First Things First
Take a look at where all the customizing takes place before you jump into actual 
coding and start making changes. If you’ve already created your MySpace profile, 
you’ve seen the Profile Edit screen (as shown in Figure 12-1) before. You can reach 
it again by clicking the Edit Profile link next to your picture in the top-left corner of 
your MySpace profile page. It’s the same series of text fields you use to enter your 
personal information. While you were typing in all that text, you probably didn’t 
know it contained so much power, did you?
Whenever you make a change to a section, you can click either the Preview 
Section or Preview Profile button to see what your page will look like before 
any changes are saved:
 
 Use the Preview Section button if you just want to see exactly what was 
changed.
 
 Use the Preview Profile button to see how your change fits in with the 
entire profile.
Notice the message near the top of the page that mentions using CSS, HTML, 
 and DHTML in any text field. Those are acronyms for the commands that 
change the look of your MySpace page. You can see an example of these kinds 
of commands in the About Me section shown in Figure 12-1. It may seem like 
gibberish right now — and yeah, okay, it’ll look like gibberish even when 

189
 Chapter 12: Customizing Your MySpace Page
you’re done — but that gibberish is your way of telling MySpace what you 
want your page to look like. There are two ways of going about customizing 
your profile:
 
 You can do it yourself if you’re already pretty handy with techno-gibberish.
 
 You can use an automatic profile editor to do the lion’s share of the 
techie work for you.
The following sections cover both methods for customizing your profile.
 
Figure 12-1: 
The Profile 
Edit screen.
 
Doing It Yourself
Putting in your own code means you have complete control over what goes 
into your profile, and you can tweak every aspect of it to your liking. HTML, 
or HyperText Mark-up Language, and CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, are the 
languages that form the basis of the vast majority of the Web pages you see 
on the Internet. As you can imagine, getting them under your belt (even a 
little) gives you a lot of power. Just look at those Web pages and you can see 
what’s possible.
How long did that take you?
As you might expect, then, it can take quite a while to figure out how to create 
your own HTML and CSS coding. It’s one thing to understand that HTML out-
lines the form and content of each Web page and that CSS provides that page 

190
Par t III: Customizing MySpace 
with a series of directions on how to lay itself out. But it’s a different matter 
to actually understand the commands that make all that stuff happen. It’s a 
subject that goes far beyond the scope of this book — especially because 
several books have already been dedicated to it. For in-depth looks at HTML 
and CSS, get hold of HTML 4 For Dummies by Ed Tittle and Mary Burmeister 
and CSS Web Design For Dummies by Richard Mansfield (both by Wiley 
Publishing, Inc.).
Well, hello HTML! Tag — you’re it!
Even though HTML and CSS coding are topics that extend beyond this book 
(and into territory known only to geeks), fear not — we won’t leave you high 
and dry without at least a little background. HTML is basically a series of 
commands called tags that tell Web browsers how the data should look when 
people load it and it shows up on their computer screens. Most of these tags 
have already been provided for you by MySpace, but there are additions you 
can make.
For example, here’s how to change the color of the font in a text field to red 
instead of plain old black. Type the following command at the beginning of 
any text field on the page:
<font color=”red”>
 
Here’s what you’re telling the browser to do:
 
 The angle brackets < > around the command tell the browser to treat 
this as a command and not to show the actual text to anybody looking at 
the page.
 
 The font command tells the browser what’s being changed, and color 
defines the exact attribute being changed.
 
 The quotes and the color name define the exact change being made.
After this command runs, only the text in that particular field will be colored 
red, making it stand out from the rest of the page.
If you want to change more, you can add some tables to your text fields. 
Tables are ways to organize your text into columns and rows. Everything in 
the table goes between these two tags:
<table>
</table>
Each row goes between these tags:
<tr>
</tr>

191
 Chapter 12: Customizing Your MySpace Page
And each cell of table data (which can be text or a picture) goes between 
these tags:
<td>
</td>
The first tag tells the browser where something begins; the second tag tells 
the browser where it ends. A table with two rows and two columns might 
look something like this:
<table bgcolor=”red”>
<tr>
<td>hi</td>
<td>there</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>what’s</td>
<td>up</td>
</tr>
</table>
If this table was entered into the I’d Like to Meet field of the Profile Edit screen, 
it would look something like Figure 12-2 on your MySpace profile page.
 
Figure 12-2: 
A basic 
table in a 
MySpace 
section.
 
Notice how there are two rows and two columns, as defined by each set of 
tags. Notice also how this really basic example doesn’t look too great. HTML 
is highly customizable, but it takes some effort to get it looking right. You can 
change the background color (notice the bgcolor tag in the above example), 
the width of the table lines, the space in between the lines and the data, and 
much more. But there’s no such thing as a free lunch; you’ll have to do your 
research to get all this cool stuff to happen.
 
Each tag must have a closing tag (basically the same tag with a / in front of 
it), or the browser won’t read it properly. The lack of a closing tag can cause 
problems when users try to view your page or cause your page to have some 
unexpected results. Check carefully before you publish your page to MySpace! 
Refer to the section “First Things First,” earlier in this chapter, for more on 
previewing your changes before you save them.

192
Par t III: Customizing MySpace 
Two other helpful tags you can use allow you to insert images from and 
hyperlinks to other locations on the Internet. To insert an image, use the fol-
lowing code:
<img src=”http://URLofyourimagehere.jpg”>
As implied, you’d put the address for your image in the appropriate section, 
but everything else should remain the same. There’s no closing tag here, but 
what the heck — computers and languages wouldn’t be the same if there 
wasn’t a little confusion.
To add hyperlinks to other locations on the Internet, use the following tag:
<a href=”http://www.yourfriendssite.com”>Your Friend’s 
Site</a>
The first part actually defines the link, whereas the text in the middle is what 
actually shows up. This will give anybody who looks at your MySpace page a 
direct, clickable link to what you want them to see.
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) get their name because they come at the beginning 
of the document and their commands cascade down through the entire page. The 
style part applies to the sheet, telling the browser how to interpret each element it 
comes across. For example, you can tell it to change the width or length of certain 
tables and define different types of text to change in the ways you specify. Okay, 
it’s beyond the scope of this book to address these elements (we’re more about 
the fun than the work of MySpace anyway), but at least you’ll be familiar with the 
concept when we look at it in the “Taking the Easy Way Out” section, later in this 
chapter.
Adding HTML
You can add your own HTML anywhere there’s a text field. Furthermore, 
the HTML added in that text field applies only to that text field, so you can 
change the attributes in each field to look different, or you can use the same 
code over and over again to make things look the same. Cutting and pasting 
text in this instance can be your friend. Here’s a quick review:
 
 On a PC, highlight the text you want to copy by clicking and holding the 
mouse button, dragging the cursor over the text you want to copy, and 
pressing Ctrl+C on your keyboard. Then move the cursor to where you 
want the text to appear and press Ctrl+V to paste the text there.
 
 On a Mac, do the same thing but use Ô+C to copy the text. Move the 
cursor to where you want the text to appear and press Ô+V to make it 
appear there.

193
 Chapter 12: Customizing Your MySpace Page
If you’re using CSS, that information is posted in the About Me field of your 
page. Your specifications are applied to all fields on the Profile Edit screen — 
which is why that info needs to go at the beginning of the page.
 
Copying and pasting HTML in and out of your profile is a common practice. 
If somebody has already written it and you want a similar view, go ahead 
and copy it into your text fields (just don’t try to take credit for somebody 
else’s work — that’s an Internet no-no). However, make sure you know exactly 
what’s going into your profile. If you don’t know what you’re doing, it’s pos-
sible to cause a lot of problems by copying and dropping in some malicious 
code you didn’t know was in there.
Can we ask you a question?
The Internet Quiz is a very common feature on MySpace profiles — in part 
because it gives you an entertaining way to tell people about yourself and also 
because the sillier and nonsensical the survey is (“What kind of foreign sports 
car are you?”), the more fun it is. These surveys usually include code at the 
bottom that lets you share the results of the survey with the world. If you read 
Chapter 11, you might realize that it’s similar to the embedded code we used to 
put videos on your page. Cut and paste the code into a MySpace text field (such 
as the About Me field) to show the results, as shown in Figure 12-3. In this figure, 
the code tells the rest of the world that the user is Fall Out Boy and is cool, evi-
dently — just as if the world truly needs this news.
 
Copy each and every character in the code, or the quiz won’t show up correctly.

An 
example of 
embedded 
quiz code.
 
Taking the Easy Way Out
So did everybody who has a cool, customized MySpace page devote the time 
and energy necessary to become familiar with HTML and CSS in order to 

194
Par t III: Customizing MySpace 
perfect their online profile? Hardly. The truth of the matter is that a few people 
took the time to figure out not only HTML and CSS, but also some program-
ming that allows them to put together MySpace page generators. You click a few 
options, copy and paste the code into your profile, and before you can say, “What 
does this thing do?” you, too, have a customized MySpace page. It’s not magic — 
it only seems that way.
If you were to type MySpace Page Generator (or some variation thereof) into 
Google and get the results, you’d see a huge variety of sites that offer you the 
option to customize your profile. Most of them are based on a series of text 
fields and check boxes that apply to different parts of your profile. Let’s take 
a look at one example — the popular Thomas’ Myspace Editor (as shown in 
Figure 12-4) found at www.strikefile.com/myspace.
On the first page of the editor, you’re given the instructions for using the site. 
After you read ’em, click the Background button where you’re asked to choose 
what you want to do with the background of your page, as shown in Figure 12-5.
You can choose either a solid color or a background image. When you start 
telling the image what to do, you can also choose what position the image 
should occupy, whether it should scroll with your MySpace page as it moves 
(or remain in place), and whether it should tile (repeat) across or down the 
page. That’s already a huge amount of control you have — and we’ve only 
taken a look at one part of the editor!

Any pictures you want to use for your background have to already be loaded 
to a hosting service. You can upload them to MySpace and then use them as a 
background from there after you have the direct link.
Online resources
Okay, we’ve probably emphasized that HTML and 
CSS coding are big projects to take on for new-
comers — but don’t let that dissuade you from 
looking at what’s possible. The Internet is one 
big repository of knowledge (and stupid pictures) 
so that makes it a logical place to look for infor-
mation on how to figure out these languages.
Many Web sites set out directions and helpful 
tutorials on how to use these tools. One of our 
personal favorites is Webmonkey, located at 
www.webmonkey.com. In addition to a library 
of projects divided among categories such as 
Design, Authoring, and Multimedia (as well as 
quick references to HTML and style sheets), you 
can find front-page articles that keep you updated 
on tips and trends in working with the Web.
Remember that you’re not the only one just start-
ing out; don’t feel bad about looking for help. 
Webmonkey even has sections for beginners and 
advanced users, so you can find something that 
matches your skill level. Starting at the beginning 
is the only way you’ll learn. If you have more spe-
cific questions, Google them and see what pops 
up. You might find the answer — and you might 
also find something that takes you in a totally 
different direction.
If you want more interaction, feel free to look 
up some online forums that deal with HTML 
and CSS. These operate a lot like the forums on 
MySpace, so you should be on familiar ground 
there. Remember to look around the forums 
first and see whether anybody has asked your 
question already before you jump in and try to 
reinvent the wheel.

After you’ve made your background edits, click the Text button at the top of 
the page. This screen allows you to alter page attributes like text, links, and 
headings, as shown in Figure 12-6. There’s a huge amount of control here as 
well — as you choose what you want to modify, more options become avail-
able. Some of the options are grayed out, but they’ll become active when you 
choose to modify them.

Clicking the Tables button at the top of the page takes you to the screen in 
which you can work on the tables and borders in your MySpace page, as 
shown in Figure 12-7. This affects mostly the text and colors inside each sec-
tion of your page.
Click the Scrollbars button to go to the screen where you can modify your 
scroll bars and how they appear, as shown in Figure 12-8. Again, you have 
several options available to you, so don’t be afraid to experiment and change 
what you see here.
After you make all your choices, click the Code button and a window opens 
with your browser, as shown in Figure 12-9. Copy this code into your About 
Me field on MySpace’s Profile Edit screen and save it. You’re ready to go with 
your custom profile!
 
You can also preview what you’ve put together before you copy it into your 
page, just to be sure you’re getting what you want. To do so, click the Preview 
This Code button to check your changes, as shown in Figure 12-10.

Hopefully the page you put together doesn’t look too bad, although you may 
find you want to go back and change some of your choices. That’s the great 
thing about profile editors — and about changing the code on a MySpace 
page in general. Nothing is ever permanent.
 
You’ll notice that most of these generators include some sort of tag they use 
to publicize themselves, along with a link to their site so you can see what 
generators the other MySpace profiles come from. There’s always going to be 
something new and different out there, so keep looking.
MySpace is even getting into the game by offering its own profile editor, 
found by clicking the Profile Editor link in the top-right corner of the Profile

 Chapter 12: Customizing Your MySpace Page
See What Develops
When social networks get started, they’re usually closed systems. That 
means they provide the tools to create your page, but you have to use their 
tools. You can only use what they give you to make your account, and there 
are no other options. Another social-networking site, Facebook, made it 
possible for others to write different features for their users by opening a 
common developer platform. In plain speak, others could create new parts 
and tools for Facebook accounts and share them with everybody.
MySpace decided this would be a good idea to include on their service as 
well, so they opened their own platform called the MySpace Developer 
Platform (MDP), found at http://developer.myspace.com. This site 
gives those interested in coding their own MySpace modules (like a virtual 
bookshelf or interactive quizzes) — a place to share information and test 
their projects. The elements that are on your MySpace page could change 
dramatically as more and more people create more and more elements.
Finding the right profile editor
There’s no easy ranking service for MySpace 
profile editors, and there are more and more 
coming along every time you look. So how do 
you choose which one you want to use on your 
profile editor?
The first thing to do is to look for examples of 
the types of profiles you want to use. Referrals 
are a great source of information, so don’t be 
afraid to ask other users what works for them. 
Again, custom editors will more than likely 
include their name and location in every profile 
they edit.
You’ll also have to decide whether you want to 
use a complete premade layout or customize your 
own. After you’ve seen what other people can do 
with their profiles, you might feel more comfort-
able making your own. Nothing you put in the 
code (except for the tags the profiles might leave 
on your page as their way of signing their art) will 
affect the text you put in describing yourself. And 
it could always be removed or changed.
From here, you’re free to explore the possi-
bilities. Here are a few things to keep in mind, 
though:
  Red text on a black background might seem 
like a good idea, but it hurts the eyes. Ow. 
Stop that.
  Busy backgrounds also hurt the eyes. 
Consider something a little more user-
friendly.
  Flashing text or pictures are annoying. If 
you like people, don’t do it.
  Whole songs are okay, but repetitious loops 
can be annoying. Especially if they belong 
to a crazy frog or a ringtone or something. 
Stop that as well.

Par t III: Customizing MySpace 
The drawback? Well, if you’re challenged by HTML and CSS, you won’t find 
developing your own applications any easier. You’ll have to understand some 
basic programming and coding skills to make these things happen yourself. 
If you have those skills, head on over to the site and enjoy your typing and 
testing. If not, you might want to wait to see what becomes available for these 
efforts. The good thing is that MySpace is using the OpenSocial network to 
create these modules, which means that they might be usable across several 
different platforms and social networks. You can use these applications many 
times, saving you some effort.
Adding More Building Blocks
Even if you’re not a developer, it doesn’t mean you can’t take advantage of all 
of their efforts. After all, the developers are building their applications to be 
used by the MySpace public at large, and you don’t have to build it to use it 
on your page.
Get all you can
To check out what’s available, check out the Applications section in the left 
column of your home page, just below your Control Panel. You’ll notice two 
choices — Get Apps and Manage Apps. Since you probably haven’t added 
anything yet, click Get Apps to get started.
Figure 12-11 shows you what’s available at the time it was taken, and it’s only 
going to get bigger from here. The choice is yours — you can add as many 
applications to your MySpace page as you want, limited only by your desire 
and good taste.

 Chapter 12: Customizing Your MySpace Page
In addition to the top choices shown on the screen, you can navigate the 
available applications by Category. Click on Music to see what’s going on 
there, as shown in Figure 12-12.
 
Figure 12-12: 
Music 
applica-

Each application shows a name, a brief description, when it was added, how 
many times it’s been added, and the language it uses. Based on the descrip-
tion, choose what you want to add by clicking its name. You’ll get the screen 
shown in Figure 12-13, which includes more information on the application 
and an Add This App button for when you’re ready to pull the trigger.
 
Figure 12-13:

information

202
Par t III: Customizing MySpace 
When you click the Add This App button, you get the confirmation message 
shown in Figure 12-14. It goes beyond just making sure you want to add this 
program, though. Applications can share your personal information and link 
you with other MySpace users, so it’s important that you realize what you’re 
doing. Select the check boxes for the functions you’re comfortable with, dese-
lect the ones you don’t want to activate, and go from there.
 
Some applications may not work when you’ve disabled certain functions. 
You’ll just have to choose what’s more important to you at this point (or write 
your own application).
 
Figure 12-14: 
Deciding 
what your 
application 
can do.
 
Each application is its own little program, so it’s impossible to generalize 
about them here. You’re just going to have to dive in and explore what’s 
available. Each one has its own way of displaying on your home page and 
functioning with your profile.
Manage your stable
Clicking Manage Apps in your Applications window shows you what you’ve 
installed. As you can see in Figure 12-15, each application has About, Settings, 
and Remove links, depending on what you want to do with it. These options 
change depending on each application, but the basics look the same.
You’re also able to block information from other applications and exercise a 
very basic control over how it uses your data. It’s basically an on/off switch, 
but at least you have that option.

Capturing Your 
Audience

In this part . . .
W
ow, there are a lot of people out there in MySpace-
land. We know there are over 100 million profi les. 
How many real people do you think are behind all those 
profi les? 25 million? 50 million? Geez, even if it’s only one 
million, that’s a lot of people. If you can sing or tell a joke, 
this would be a great place to show your stuff.
In fact, MySpace does let you take the online stage in front 
of all those people by using the site. With special tools for 
musicians, fi lmmakers, and comedians to share their tal-
ents, it’s an ideal launchpad for the next superstar career.
Of course, with so many people using MySpace, it’s also 
a perfect way for marketers to get the word out about a 
cool new product, a movie release, or a concert announce-
ment to a lot of people at once. This part explores some 
ways talented artists and marketers are using MySpace.

arketing is all about finding your audience and ways to connect to 
them so they know what you have to offer. In theory, its goal is to 
present information that allows consumers to decide what products and 
services they need as they go about their daily lives — at work, at home, and 
everywhere in between. Recent research suggests that you’re exposed to an 
average of 5,000 marketing messages each day. Well, it’s an expected part of 
the evolution of media that marketers will find ways to use any new outlet — 
especially one as popular as MySpace — to reach, connect with, and cultivate 
their audiences.
As the MySpace population escalates into the hundreds of millions, it 
shouldn’t come as a surprise that businesses and brands are finding ways to 
access these people. Beware — this world is different from the forms of mass 
media (television, newspaper, magazines, and so on) that have become the 
delivery systems for most of those 5,000 daily messages. People now expect 
to be reached in many different ways — and on MySpace in particular, there’s 
a direct connection that goes both ways. If you don’t want to hear what other 
community members have to say about you, it’s really best not to ask. But if 
you’re prepared to take that risk and make contact, the rewards can be great.
It’s no longer about mass media. It’s me media. It’s about personal connections — 
and the people you want to talk to get to decide whether they want to hear what 
you have to say. It’d better be relevant because you only get one chance to 
make a “friend.”
Whether you’re hoping to market yourself or your business, or even just bracing 
yourself to be marketed to on MySpace, this chapter gets you prepared.

208
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
The Ultimate Online Social Community
It’s only natural to be drawn to other people with whom you find a connection. 
You had a lot in common with the group of kids you ran with in school — the 
clothes you wore, the way you spoke, the music you liked, and the city you 
grew up in. As you grow older, that continues. You join a church, participate 
in recreational activities, and get involved with civic organizations that allow 
you the opportunity to surround yourself with others with whom you feel an 
allegiance. Ultimately, we all seek to feel understood — and who understands 
us better (or is more fun to be with) than the people who have similar interests 
and passions?
The beauty of MySpace is that it tears down the geographic and societal bar-
riers that were previous hindrances to finding these people. A decade ago, 
you might have been able to find only one other person within your circle 
of friends and acquaintances who shared your secret passion for carving 
pelicans out of soap, or swing dancing, or even eating your favorite brand 
of candy bar. Today there’s an ever-expanding resource for connecting and 
communicating with an entire community of chocolate-chomping, swing-
dancing soap carvers (or whatever it is you love in this world).
True, from a concept level, the idea of an online social community is fairly 
straightforward. Such virtual gatherings basically give you the opportunity — 
and the capability — to find that needle in the haystack with a click of your 
mouse. Bottom line: Creating connections and communicating to the masses 
has become easier than ever before.
The idea of an online social community, such as MySpace, isn’t a new one. 
There have always been small groups of people scattered across the Internet 
who use online forums, message boards, and other online-community tools 
to interact with people with similar interests. However, these types of com-
munities were usually very niche-oriented (musicians, artists, pet lovers, and 
so on) and their members were much more Web-savvy than your average 
day-to-day Web user. What MySpace has done, in a very short time, is create 
an online community that’s gained acceptance by all types of users, from all 
types of backgrounds and interests — the musicians can find a huge number 
of other music lovers, pet-owners can find scads of other folks who are into 
the same breeds they are, you name it.
Regardless of who you’re looking for, MySpace brings it all together under 
one roof. This is what makes it extremely attractive as a marketing tool. Some 
of the reasons for the incredible growth of MySpace are hard to pinpoint. Being 
at the right place at the right time comes into play, as does the cumulative power 
of the people. MySpace has grown because the people who love it draw other 
people to it — it’s a prime example of self-perpetuating “viral” growth. There’s 
longevity in what’s been created, but the explosive growth follows the path of 
some of the most significant fads or pop-culture reference points of all time 

209
 Chapter 13: Marketing the MySpace Way
(well, recent all time anyway). The following list contains a few of the more 
obvious reasons for MySpace’s unbelievable success:
 
 Founded on bands and celebrities: When MySpace first hit the Internet 
scene, the majority of the members were bands and celebrities who were 
intrigued by how MySpace could potentially create a new way for them to 
connect and interact with the people most important to them — their fans. 
The more these bands and celebrities promoted their MySpace pages, the 
bigger their fan base and the MySpace community grew. MySpace was a 
perfect tool for creating a grassroots-level channel directly to those fans that 
wanted a way to connect. The rest, as they say, is history.
 
 Ability to customize: MySpace may not have been the absolute first in 
the market among online social communities, but it’s definitely become 
the biggest and most widely recognized. Another major contributor to 
this success has been the way MySpace engages its users’ creativity: 
They can customize nearly every part and piece of their own personal 
spot in the MySpace world. MySpace users number in the millions, but 
every single one can turn his or her profile into a personal statement 
that truly reflects a distinct identity.
 
 MySpace has always given users the ability to add videos, photos, text, 
background images, and any color of the rainbow to their profiles, which 
makes MySpace truly feel like a reflection of who you are. Many Web sites 
have been created with content created specifically for use on MySpace 
pages, which is a testament to the fact that users are constantly looking 
for the latest and greatest stuff to add to their profile pages.
 
 You can read all about how to customize the many different parts of 
your MySpace profile in Part III.
 
 Easy-to-use interface: Whether you’re a major computer geek or a 
mother of three without enough time to sit still at a computer, MySpace 
has created an interface that’s intuitive and easy to use. This allows 
anyone and everyone the opportunity to access and use MySpace.
 
 Communication options: MySpace gives you several ways to connect 
with people using tools such as e-mail-like messaging, Instant Messaging, 
blogs, bulletins, event invitations, audio and video players, and much, 
much more. These different tools make it easy for newbies to hit the 
ground running when they first register, while still giving the more Web-
savvy users the freedom and flexibility to mix, match, and customize the 
tools at the same time. So whether you’re on MySpace for fun or you’re 
there strictly for business, you can tailor it to your own needs.
 
 It’s free: Two of the things that have drawn users to MySpace are that it 
costs the user absolutely nothing to use it (yep, you heard right — it’s 
free) and that it’s packed full of tools — also free — that you can use right 
away to communicate with the masses. Those features make MySpace a 

210
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
very attractive alternative to forking over the cash to create a Web site 
of your own. Even major bands and movie studios have realized that 
they have direct access to their target audience through MySpace — 
compare that to trying to create yet another Web site outside the social 
hotspot. If you’ve gone to a movie lately, it’s likely that you’ve seen the 
domain MySpace.com pop up somewhere on the big screen during some 
of the previews. No accident, that.
 
 It’s where the people are: MySpace has been growing exponentially 
lately — and that means if you don’t have a MySpace profile, you are, 
like, totally out of the social loop. The more people who sign up, the more 
people hear about it and the faster the community grows. It’s cyclical, 
baby. MySpace is like a runaway train that’s gaining speed and momentum 
every second, with no slowing down in sight anytime soon. This means 
you need to not only get into the MySpace mix socially, but (for many 
companies and organizations) professionally as well. After MySpace hit a 
few million members, there was no turning back — which means you can 
no longer expect the users to come to you (unless of course, you’re on 
MySpace). Now the sheer numbers of users are having an effect: Even the 
people who had initially vehemently opposed being on MySpace have 
grudgingly made profiles. After awhile, they’re starting to find they like 
it. And when everyone you know is connecting in a certain way, maybe 
there’s something to it. If you want to find out what that potential advantage 
is, you have little choice but to join the fray.
As you can see, MySpace created the right community for the right audience 
at the right time with the right tools — which has made it the 800-pound 
gorilla in the world of online social communities. So, does this whole MySpace 
community offer enough market potential that you should get involved in it? 
That depends. In the next few sections, we lay the groundwork for a good, 
hands-on sense of who should jump into the MySpace marketing world, the 
pros and cons of marketing to MySpacers, and some strategic advice if you 
decide that this is the way to go. Are you ready for a little bit of MySpace 
Marketing 101? We think you are.
Deciding Whether MySpace 
Is the Right Place
Unlike more traditional marketing and advertising venues — and, to a lesser 
degree, even your stand-alone Web site — MySpace is a living and breathing 
environment. Well, not literally, but you get what we’re saying: It changes and 
responds and can’t be taken for granted. So, in order to get the most out of 
marketing on MySpace, you have to make a continuing commitment. Tossing 
up a profile page, walking away, and leaving it out of sight and out of mind can 
cause significant damage to your brand or business among the MySpace crowd.

211
 Chapter 13: Marketing the MySpace Way
 
MySpace is about connection and communication, and that means it’s a two-
way dialogue. Your audience will have questions. They’ll have comments. They’ll 
be boisterously supportive, but they might also be outraged. It’s your responsibil-
ity to treat your marketing efforts on MySpace with great care. That said, consider 
your audience. If they’re on MySpace, maybe you should be, too. But check first. 
If you’re selling life insurance, MySpace may not be as immediately profitable as it 
would be if you were selling designer T-shirts.
Evaluating the MySpace audience
When deciding to involve yourself or your organization in the sometimes 
wacky world of MySpace, you should first ask yourself if the MySpace audi-
ence is the audience that you want to connect with. The MySpace community 
currently skews towards the younger, Web-savvy demographic, but with over 
100 million registered users — and its popularity constantly growing — it 
becomes more and more traditional. No wonder older people are joining 
as well. But no matter who the target demographic is, when people join the 
MySpace community, they tend to make it one of their most-visited stops on 
the information superhighway.
The ability to build an audience
Whether you’re a poet trying to get feedback on your latest haiku or a multi-
million-dollar company intent on pitching a new product, you’ll always have 
the same end goal in mind — building an audience. Well, building the audience 
is really just one piece of the puzzle. While you’re building your audience, you 
also need to be interacting with them, engaging them, keeping them interested 
with what you have to offer, and motivating them to act. It’s basically a double-
edged sword — just as you now have the capability to communicate easily to 
an audience in MySpace, your audience can just as easily choose not to listen. 
This is a major shift from the traditional mass-media methods of disruptive 
advertising and marketing that we’re all so used to seeing.
The concept of picking a billboard next to a busy highway or running your com-
mercial during that new, popular sitcom, just hoping that people will see it, isn’t 
going to fly for the new MySpace generation. You’re dealing with a very fickle 
audience and a consumer-driven medium where the members have more control 
than an impatient guy with a remote — and you’re attempting to work your way 
into their world, so be careful. Through MySpace, the audience decides whether 
they want to hear from you at all — thus the ones who do choose to listen to 
what you have to say are much more receptive to what you’re telling them — 
and incredibly valuable because they also tell their friends.

212
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
The MySpace corporate invasion
When MySpace first started, most of the more 
well-known corporations were very hesitant 
to make the jump to MySpace. After all, it rep-
resented an enormous shift in the way they 
communicate. If they were to reach out on 
MySpace, they’d be forced to “let go” of quite 
a bit of control and realize that people could 
say whatever they wanted — and millions of 
others could read it. However, as the commu-
nity grew and grew, many have changed their 
minds not because they wanted to, but because 
they had to. MySpace is like a virtual shopping 
mall that’s packed with millions of people — 
younger people with money, the ones these 
companies need to get in front of if they want to 
be successful. So, for starters, here’s a list of a 
few corporations who have officially made the 
move to MySpace — and a look at how they’re 
utilizing this new marketing medium:
  H&R Block (http://www.myspace.
com/trumangreene), Friends: 4,000.
 
 H&R Block might not be one of the first 
companies to come to mind when you think 
about which companies would be get-
ting involved with MySpace, but believe 
it or not, it is. It has created a character 
called Truman Greene (for H&R’s trade-
mark color green) and he is supposedly 
H&R Block’s #1 fan in the entire universe. 
The goal of the page is to basically pretend 
like Truman is a real MySpace user, which 
will hopefully translate into thousands of 
normal MySpacers befriending him. So far 
it doesn’t look like a runaway hit, but at the 
time of this printing, Truman was still fairly 
new on the MySpace scene.
  Dell (www.myspace.com/dell), 
Friends: 12,265
 
 Dell has created a profile on MySpace that 
feels just like it came out of a Dell brochure. 
Besides a few cool-looking graphics, Dell 
hasn’t really implemented the medium of 
MySpace to its full potential. There is also 
a Tell Us To: piece you can use to tell a Dell 
worker to set his hair on fire, arm-wrestle a 
dinosaur (virtually), or build you a Dell (vir-
tually or for real). It’s a great start, but Dell 
could do much, much more.
  Honda (www.myspace.com/honda
element), Friends: 25,810
 
 Honda has really pushed its Element SUV 
on MySpace — no surprise there because 
a younger demographic usually buys this 
particular vehicle. Honda’s profile has run 
a MySpace background contest called 
the “Embrace MySpace Contest,” where 
MySpace users could create and submit 
a background image to be featured on the 
Honda Element’s profile page. Honda has 
also created a profile page specifically for 
Gil, the “I pinch” crab featured on a few of 
its commercials at www.myspace.com/
crab. The newly famous crustacean cur-
rently has over 70,000 friends — and some-
one just commented “gil... will you please 
pinch me!!! I NEED TO BE PINCHED!!” It 
seems the MySpace community likes him. 
(You go, Gil. Ow.)
  Wendy’s (www.myspace.com/wendy
square), Friends: 43,568.
 
 Wendy’s has used its MySpace profile 
specifically to promote its cartoon mascot, 
the Wendy’s Square (named Smart). You 
can find out all about Smart on his profile 
page and you can also download a set of 
Beadicons, which are small images of 
Smart that show him with different emo-
tions, such as Shocked, Bored, and Foot in 
Mouth. This attempt by Wendy’s is a very 
noncorporate way to work its brand into the 
MySpace world — and so far it seems to be 
working.

213
 Chapter 13: Marketing the MySpace Way
This idea of building yourself an audience isn’t a new one, but the methods 
and best practices for doing so have changed. It’s definitely not something 
to fear — just like anything else that’s new and dynamic, it’ll take time to get 
used to. And don’t worry — no one really has all the answers yet, so don’t 
 be discouraged if your first online marketing campaign doesn’t work right out 
of the gate. One of the main keys to success in building up an audience is 
consistency — and this environment not only rewards trying new things, but 
keeping at it. You’ll figure out what works best for you with some committed 
effort and experimentation.
New rules, new expectations
With the growth and acceptance of high-speed Internet connections, the Web 
has quickly become a major player in the world of marketing. Major advances 
in online communication and multimedia technologies have made things 
possible on the Internet today that were just crazy ideas a few years ago. The 
very nature of the medium allows for personal, one-to-one connections that 
are unlike any previous interaction with the forms of mass media that have 
dominated advertising so far. This type of connected environment is what 
turned a once-small (and relatively unknown) online community into the MySpace 
that we know today — not only a community, but an audience and a potentially 
demanding market in its own right.
But with innovation comes greater expectations — and today’s users expect 
more from the Web than any other group of users the Internet has ever seen. 
Marketing has become highly interactive, and the ability to give the masses 
the content they’re looking for and wanting has become easier — now you 
just need to make sure that you’re giving them what they want, when they 
want it, and how they want it. The Internet’s become a gigantic consumer-
driven playground — and if you want to get involved, you better be ready to 
let them play. There are a few things that will be very different when looking 
at marketing in the world of MySpace compared to marketing in the tradi-
tional sense. You should definitely be aware of and prepared for these dif-
ferences, but by no means should you be scared of them. Even so, here’s a 
practical list of things that you should be ready for as you start marketing the 
MySpace way:
 
 Don’t just sit there: So, you finally decided to carve out your own little space 
in the MySpace world, and you’re officially ready to get this marketing party 
started. You’ll quickly realize that by just having your own space doesn’t 
mean that you now have a presence. Whether it’s running a TV commercial, 
posting a billboard, or placing an ad in your local newspaper, traditional 
advertising and marketing have always been set-it-and-forget-it processes. 
But the new online spaces like MySpace demand participation — you 
must be prepared not only to market to the community, but also to 
become a living, breathing member of it. MySpace rewards those who 
are proactive — and will easily ignore those who are not — so get to it!

214
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
 
 It’s a two-way street: MySpace is all about give and take. If you want 
people to communicate with you and become more aware of your talents, 
products, or services, you better start getting in touch with them. It also 
never hurts to give the members of MySpace stuff to “play” with. Use your 
space in a way that encourages interaction and engagement — after all, that’s 
what MySpace was created for. Also, don’t treat MySpace as just another 
Web site. Utilize and take advantage of the tools that the masses are already 
used to responding to and make it as easy as possible to interact.
 
 Take the good with the bad: Someone once said, “Be careful what you 
wish for because you just might get it.” Well, MySpace has given mar-
keters that direct, open channel to their end users — the one they’ve 
always dreamed about — and now that it’s open, they should be prepared 
to hear the voice of the people . . . which isn’t always complimentary. If you 
run a TV commercial, you might get some feedback from a few people 
in passing who have seen it on the air — and (depending who they 
are) they might even tell you the truth about their reactions. Now, on 
the other hand, if you run an online video via MySpace, anyone with a 
MySpace account could give their opinions — instantly. Those may be 
good, bad, glowing, ticked off, or incoherent — but you’ll be getting true 
opinions of the masses (at least the MySpace masses). Just make sure 
you’re ready to hear it.
 
 Policing your space: One of the things that marketers have feared the 
most when it comes to MySpace and other online social communities is 
the fact that the members have so much more control than ever before. 
What do you do if one of them posts a terrible comment or a pornographic pic-
ture on your profile page? The fact that the user now has an open conversation 
with your brand has to be taken very seriously. Knowing how to set up your 
profile in a way that allows you the control you’re comfortable with — while 
still allowing enough interaction from the members of MySpace so that they 
feel involved — is the key to effective online marketing. This idea of controlling 
users’ interaction with your space — for the sake of your image and that of 
your brand — is policing. Users’ expectations — when it comes to interacting 
with your brand — will only become greater as online communities continue to 
make our world smaller and nearly everything more accessible. Just make sure 
you’re up to speed on how to deal with it.
If you keep all of this in mind when you’re stepping foot into the MySpace scene, 
you should be prepared for some of the things that might otherwise catch you 
off guard. Also, remember that MySpace is still fairly uncharted marketing ter-
ritory — and the whole concept of marketing to online social communities is 
something many people still have to figure out as they go along. Just make sure 
you don’t get too frustrated when you begin your journey — this is just the 
beginning of a phenomenon that will most likely be around for a long, long time — 
and even the pros are uncertain of what to expect.

 Chapter 13: Marketing the MySpace Way
Real-World Marketing versus 
MySpace Marketing
MySpace has basically rewritten the rules on how a marketer can reach 
his or her audience. And it’s about time; the traditional methods that most 
marketers use are showing less impact and fewer results than ever. Part of 
this ferment is due to the sheer number of messages we receive on a daily 
basis — and part of it is because we don’t spend our time in the same ways 
we did just a few years ago. Television provides so many options that even 
the popular shows gather much smaller ratings than they did a decade ago. 
Newspaper circulation is dropping at an alarming rate. And magazines are 
becoming attuned to niche audiences — read: markets — in order to survive. 
Although many marketers are hanging on to these time-tested advertising 
methods, others are focusing on new and innovative ways to connect. Take a 
look at how MySpace is contributing to the changes.
The first part of each bullet item summarizes the way marketers have always 
done it — and the second part is MySpace’s version of how it can be translated 
into the online world. (Now, pay attention — there might be a quiz after this.)
 
 Passing out flyers: Behold the almighty flyer — it’s pure and simple 
promotion. As the ultimate grassroots way to communicate your message, 
the flyer is about as up-close and personal as you can get with your 
audience. No wonder yard sales, concerts, sporting events, and clothing 
sales use this time-tested method as a way to get people up to speed on 
what’s going on. Okay, online doesn’t entirely replace hard copy — there 
will most likely never be a day when flyers aren’t used — but certain 
MySpace tools can give you the same result with a lot bigger audience, a 
lot less effort, and no printing costs.
 
 MySpace’s version: You comment as many of your friends’ pages as you 
can, displaying an eye-catching image along with the when-where-and-
how-much info about your next must-see performance with your punk-
rock band, The Preppy Misfits. That simple comment links back to your 
profile — where they can hear your music and check out pictures from 
your last few shows. You also decide to create a snazzy-looking bulletin 
that you send out to your Friend List, where it will definitely catch their 
attention. Then you sit back and wait for the flood of feedback — which 
is, according to the comments you’re getting, looking great. Rock and 
roll lives on — and you saved a few bucks’ worth of printing and a few 
trees’ worth of paper. All is well with the world.
 
 Running a TV commercial: TV commercials have long been a way to get 
a marketer’s message out to the masses. The problem is that traditional 
commercials are definitely not the cheapest way to tell your story — and 
they’re strictly a one-way marketing technique; it’s hard to target the 
message accurately, and even harder to get feedback on it. There’s no 
guarantee that the people you want to talk to are even tuned in — but if 

216
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
your goal is to reach the masses, television is the established way to go. 
If you have thousands of dollars on hand — and a whole lot of hope that 
you can guess when your audience is watching what shows — maybe TV 
is the channel (sorry about that) for you.
 
 MySpace’s version: You know in your heart that you own the greatest 
restaurant in your town. The people who have eaten there love it and 
can’t get enough of it. The only problem is that everyone else in your 
town doesn’t know this, and you need to get the message out. You grab a 
camera and start creating your own videos about why anyone would have 
to be nuts not to stop in for a bite to eat. You get your cooks on camera, 
you get your satisfied customers on camera, you even interview your mom 
about why your restaurant is great and you put that on camera. Before 
you know it, you have a couple great videos posted on your MySpace page 
that you start spreading the word about. You send the clips to the custom-
ers you interviewed — you send them to people who have never heard of 
you before — and you send them to (of course) your mom. Those people 
enjoy the videos almost as much as they enjoy your restaurant, so they 
pass them along to their friends, co-workers, and members of their soft-
ball team. The whole thing snowballs like compound interest ’til the word 
is out on your restaurant — and the only problem you have now is where 
to seat all your newfound (and hungry) friends.
 
 Developing a street team: From a marketing perspective, it always helps 
to locate and assemble a loyal group of people who are dedicated to your 
brand and to what you’re doing. That’s especially valuable when they’re 
so loyal that they become a powerful marketing channel in their own 
right. These groups, usually known as street teams, utilize word-of-mouth 
marketing to communicate their messages. You’ve seen these people 
handing out free samples, trying to get you to sign up for contests, and 
posting flyers on college campuses. Well, word of mouth has always 
been one of the most powerful forms of real-world marketing — and with 
MySpace, word of mouth can be extended to a whole new level.
 
 MySpace’s version: Say you really want to let people know about your 
company’s new MP3 player, the mePod. You’ve begun to notice that several 
people have already bought it — and can’t say enough great stuff about 
it in the comments and messages they’ve sent to you. Okay, stay with us 
here — you live in California and only one out of about 15 of these extreme 
mePod fans are from California too, but that doesn’t matter with MySpace. 
You begin to message them all, wherever they are, telling them about how 
you want them to start a virtual mePod street team that would help preach 
the mePod gospel from one end of MySpace to the other. You entice them by 
putting them in your Top 8 friends, adding their pictures to your profile, and 
hooking them up with tickets to the mePod-sponsored national tour of that 
can’t-miss band they all love so much. You also mail them all a version of the 
new itsy-bitsy mePod that doesn’t hit stores for another six months. They 
become rock stars (more or less) in their world, and they’re doing some 
effective promoting that’s really working. Before you know it, your Friend 
List has doubled in a month and sales for the mePod have never been better. 
Mission accomplished. Pat yourself on the back.

217
 Chapter 13: Marketing the MySpace Way
 
 Creating a T-shirt: Wearing a T-shirt with a company logo or message on 
it is a very personal and powerful way for people to communicate their 
brand loyalty. This type of “real” marketing is priceless for your brand 
because it shows that the person wearing the shirt is proud to tell the 
world that they think of you or your organization. It’s very honest — the 
person wearing the shirt has the ultimate decision on whether to wear 
it, and other people realize and respect that. In fact, people will line up 
and work themselves into a tizzy just to earn a free T-shirt, even if they 
never wear it. This very personal and loyal type of marketing can be 
easily translated into the MySpace world as well. Just make sure that if 
your audience wants to show their loyalty to your brand, they can do it 
digitally — and that you’ve given them the means to do so.
 
 MySpace’s version: You can’t believe that your movie is actually getting 
ready to hit theaters soon — and now you need to get the word out about 
your video creation because you know it has blockbuster potential. You 
create a profile on MySpace that allows the millions of MySpace users to 
add different versions of your movie trailer to their own profile and down-
load new movie-themed backgrounds for their profiles, and you encourage 
them all you add your movie’s profile to one of their coveted Top Friends 
spots. You also decide to let members of the community download raw 
video clips of the movie so that they can make their own versions of your 
movie trailer: Let the mash-ups begin. Soon MySpace is overflowing with 
digital odes to your movie, and you decide to showcase your favorite five 
user-generated movie trailers on your profile page — heck, you might even 
show them at your premiere screening. The MySpace masses are engaged 
completely in your movie — and it eventually gets them up and moving to 
fill up the theaters. A blockbuster . . . how sweet it is.
Measuring Your MySpace Success
To most of its millions of registered users, MySpace is a place that’s enter-
taining, amusing, and a great way to burn some time while bored at work. But, to a 
marketer it could mean creating potential opportunities to grab the attention 
of a demographic that isn’t really known for sitting still. MySpace, however, 
with it’s marketing potential and possibilities, isn’t an easy place for a marketer 
to fit in. Just like any other marketing initiative, to be successful you must plan to 
budget certain resources when marketing in the MySpace world and, when this type 
of planning and resources are used, there must also be a way to gauge success.
Being able to state what would mean marketing success for you or your 
organization on MySpace — clearly defining the goal — is the first order of 
business. Do you want to create more awareness of your product or service? 
Maybe you want to drive users to a Web site outside MySpace where they can 
make online purchases? Do you want the members of MySpace to buy tickets 
to your next event? Maybe you just want feedback on the last song you posted? 

218
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
These are all things that you could potentially accomplish by utilizing MySpace. 
Giving some thought to what would spell “success” for your MySpace market-
ing efforts is an essential first step to take before anything else. From there, it’s 
pretty straightforward. . . .
Find your people. Get their attention. Listen to what they have to say. Keep 
them happy. And have fun doing it, for goodness’ sake.
X-Men: The Last Stand — 
A MySpace success story
Already a litany of success stories surrounds 
the bands, brands, comics, and movies that have 
had phenomenal market success through their 
efforts on MySpace. Even before Fox’s parent 
company, News Corp., purchased MySpace 
for $580 million, it had been experimenting with 
MySpace as a lucrative marketing option. Two 
weeks before the opening of X-Men: The Last 
Stand, Fox posted a MySpace profile specific 
to the site. Within hours, it had 50,000 friends. 
By the time the film opened (as the #5 biggest 
opening ever, with more than $102 million in 
domestic ticket sales), there were 2.3 million 
friends on the profile, making it the most popu-
lar profile on MySpace. Today, the profile still 
boasts 1.9 million friends.
Successful marketing takes a meaningful mes-
sage to the right audience. The MySpace audi-
ence may not be right for every business, but for 
those who find their target market on MySpace, 
be prepared for an experience like no other. 
You can create more loyal fans than you’ve 
ever imagined, but you’ll have to earn — and 
keep — their trust and their support. After all, 
any great relationship is based on quality com-
munication and mutual understanding.
The figure included here shows you part of the 
X-Men 3 MySpace profile. As you can see, it 
uses the medium very well — and at the time of 
this writing people were still interacting with it.

W
e’ve all heard the discovery stories of our favorite musicians. The 
idea that anytime, anyplace, you just might get noticed for your tal-
ents by someone who actually has the power to take you to the next level is 
an alluring dream. Although that still happens, in these days of fragmented 
markets, record labels love to look for new acts that are as close to a sure thing 
as they can find. They want talented musicians, but they also want them to have 
an existing audience of rabidly passionate fans. No wonder the industry is catch-
ing on to MySpace — a destination like no other for bands who are trying to 
build an audience, maintain their fan base, and share their sound with the world. 
Geographic boundaries are fading — and the audience is listening. Now, more 
than ever, you have the capability to gain exposure, book gigs, promote a new 
album, and talk to your fans — regardless of whether they listen to you in your 
own garage, at their cousins’ weddings, or in a sold-out stadium.
Music — the Foundation of MySpace
How does an online community go from an idea to what has become the MySpace 
phenomenon in just a few years? One word — music. When MySpace got its 
start in the sunny state of California, it was initially pitched to musicians as a way 
to gather fans and expose their music as never before. Before anyone quite 
knew what was happening, word spread about this new online tool. Many 
musicians were swearing by it, and as more and more musicians moved to 
MySpace, their fans, of course, followed. MySpace created a whole new way 
for musicians and fans to connect. After just a couple short years, MySpace 
has become the most popular online hangout for millions of people, and at 
its core, it’s all thanks to the one thing that everyone loves in one form or 
another — music.

220
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
When you buy a guitar, it doesn’t come with a publicist. Drum kits don’t have 
managers or booking agents living inside them. If you signed something when 
you bought a microphone, chances are pretty good that it was an extended 
warranty, not a lucrative recording contract. The talent and the tools are just 
the start. The years of musical training or generations of musically inclined 
genes (or those that favor creative and poetic wordplay) are the reason 
you’ll create beautiful music — but none of that guarantees you an audience. 
There’s a whole other series of commitments and responsibilities that come 
with being a musician. For many bands, MySpace easily opens doors, orga-
nizes information, and introduces them to an entire world of potential fans. 
That can be a solid start.
Want to hear some music from that band your daughter is talking about? 
Click. Want to share with your friends the most amazing song you’ve ever 
heard (this week)? Click. Want to tell a musician that his or her lyrics feel as 
if they were written for you? Click. Want to add that song you’ve been hum-
ming all week to your own profile page? Click. It’s all at your fingertips, and 
it’s all just a click away.
Basically, MySpace owes its popularity to the musicians who wanted to get 
their music out to the public using some easy tools. Some of the things that 
drew the musical masses to MySpace are relative no-brainers:
 
 It’s FREE: The only thing better than awesome online tools for an 
up-and-coming band are free and awesome online tools. Anyone can 
jump on MySpace and create an online presence for their music free of 
charge, which has made MySpace a very attractive way for musicians 
to promote their tunes. If MySpace had charged bands to register an 
account from the beginning, MySpace might have never extended out of 
its California roots. But, luckily, it’s 100 percent free to use, which has 
made millions of bands very happy.
 
 Easy to use: With its easy-to-use and straightforward interface, MySpace 
has made even the least Web-savvy musicians into powerful online-
promotion powerhouses. Adding show dates, music, pictures, and band 
information is a piece of cake, and it shows. It’s one reason that (increas-
ingly) you’re hard put to find a band that hasn’t staked a claim in the 
MySpace world.
 
 MySpace Music Player: The MySpace Music Player is by far one of the 
greatest standard features on any MySpace music profile. After registering 
as a musician, you can upload a limited number of full-length songs in MP3 
format onto MySpace. After the songs are uploaded, any user who stumbles 
upon a musician’s page can easily listen to all that exciting new music — it’s 
instantly streamed through the MySpace Music Player. Before MySpace hit 
the scene, a musician needed a little bit of cash and know-how in order to 
stream music on the Web, but now, thanks to the MySpace Music Player, 
it’s never been easier.

221
 Chapter 14: Rockin’ in the MySpace World
 
 Fans are there: Prior to MySpace, musicians had to drive potential fans 
to their specific Web sites — which is never an easy task, especially when 
you’re just starting out and not many people know your music yet. But 
now, considering that there are 100+ million users on MySpace, it’s much 
easier to get them to visit your Web space. More and more musicians are 
getting asked the question, “Are you on MySpace?” by those who dig 
their music.
 
 Also, musicians who book out-of-town gigs in that not-so-well-known 
venue can now let the locals know they’re coming. With a few searches 
and Friend Requests, an audience could potentially be created in no 
time. Heck, they might even be able to find a sofa here and there for the 
band members to sleep on.
 
 An online musical standard: For musicians with pro aspirations, it’s 
quickly becoming less of a convenience and more of a necessity to have 
a music profile on MySpace. If a band has high hopes of getting its music 
out there, they’d better have a few songs uploaded on the MySpace Music 
Player. Why? Because the MySpace music profile has quickly become the 
online musical standard for Web users. MySpace users have become very 
familiar with how music is played on the music profiles, which gives a great 
opportunity to any musician who utilizes all that MySpace has to offer.
 
 Equal opportunity: Not only has the MySpace music profile become a 
powerful promotions tool for up-and-coming musicians, but it’s also made 
its way into the worlds of the most mainstream musicians as well. A local 
bluegrass band in Kentucky uses the same exact MySpace platform and 
tools to promote their music as Coldplay and U2 do. Even though MySpace 
is still considered the new kid on the block when it comes to music, it’s 
probably become the largest equal-opportunity musical 
clearinghouse in the world.
As you can see, there are many reasons why MySpace is a perfect fit for all types 
of musicians. By developing a new channel between musicians and their fans, 
MySpace has not only created a way for the masses to listen to music — they’ve 
provided an opportunity for the creation of the meaningful conversations and 
feedback that surround it. MySpace has created the ultimate online fan experience.
Getting Your Music onto MySpace
The Battle of the Bands is approaching. This year, your band has what it 
takes to win the whole thing. Great songs, an impressive stage show, pyro-
technics, and more. You’ve designed some flyers and you’ve asked all your 
friends to show up, support your dream, and vote for their favorite (as long 
as it’s you). There must be a better way to help get the word out: a better 

222
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
way to connect to the new fans you’ve earned once you’re there. You’re 
prepared to do what it takes to get the adoring masses the information they 
need — quickly and easily.
So you think that it’s time to give MySpace a taste of your musical talents, 
eh? Fortunately, getting your MySpace music profile up and running isn’t 
too tough. The first thing that you need to do is register a music profile on 
MySpace. This process is very similar to creating a personal MySpace page, 
but with a few small differences. Tune that guitar of yours, turn up your amp, 
and follow these steps to take your first step toward MySpace music star-
dom:
 
1. Go to the MySpace.com home page and click the Music link, as shown 
in Figure 14-1.
 
 Registering on MySpace as a musician is different from registering a per-
sonal MySpace page. By clicking the Music link in the main MySpace navi-
gation, you’re taken to the main MySpace Music page. Don’t be surprised 
if this area becomes very familiar as you make increasing use of your 
MySpace music profile. It’s where most of your musical MySpacing begins.
 
 Most musicians register a personal MySpace page as well as a music 
profile. This allows them to manage their personal friends with one and 
utilize the other as mainly a promotional tool for their music. As many 
people say, it’s a great way to separate business from pleasure.

 The Artist Signup link is at the top of the page on the far-right side of 
the MySpace Music navigation links. This link takes you to the Musician 
Signup window.
 
3. Fill out all required information and click the Sign Up button.
 
 Fill out all the required information on the Musician Signup window, 
as shown in Figure 14-2. Make sure to select the check box that lets 
MySpace know that you agree with their Terms of Service and Privacy 
Statement.

4. Complete your registration and click the Sign Up button.
 
 After filling out your initial registration information and clicking the Sign 
Up button, you’re taken to the Registration Completion window. In this 
window, finalize the following:
 
• Your MySpace URL: This is where you enter the MySpace URL that you 
intend to promote to anyone you want to attract to your MySpace 
page. Make sure that this site reflects you, your music, and your 
musical interests that your fans can relate to. You can edit this later 
if needed, so it’s not set in stone. (That’s okay. Music isn’t, either.)
 
 Keep this bit of online wisdom in mind: The shorter the address, 
the better.

224
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
 
• Genre(s): Three drop-down lists let you select what genre(s) your 
band falls under. Whatever you select here will be what you’re 
listed under on MySpace. It’ll be displayed on your music profile — 
and it’ll be searchable by the millions of MySpacers after you set it.
 
• Web Site: If you already have a Web site established outside of 
MySpace, you can add that here.
 
• Current Record Label: If you’re one of the lucky few who are 
already signed to a label, add it proudly here — and make all the 
unsigned bands jealous. This information will be displayed on your 
music profile as well.
 
• Label Type: Three choices are in this drop-down list: Unsigned, 
Major, and Indie. If you aren’t sure which one you are, you’re probably 
unsigned. This is a great first step in doing something about that.
 
5. Add a profile picture, invite friends, and upload songs.
 
 Your MySpace music profile is now created. MySpace now gives you the 
options of adding a profile picture, inviting friends, and uploading songs. 
You can either fill out some of these options or skip them for now. At the 
very least, you should add a profile picture. This can be done by clicking 
the Browse button, locating a picture on your hard drive, and clicking the 
Upload button.
At this point, your music profile is very similar to a personal account — with 
a few important differences. The following section helps you get your music 
profile playing music to the masses in no time.
MySpace Music Profile Options
So, your MySpace music profile is now officially registered and you’re ready 
to get your music up for the world to see, um, hear. The following list of options 
helps you make the most out of your music profile — in almost no time — so 
you can start spreading the word about your music as soon as possible.
 
As stated earlier, many of the options on a MySpace music profile are the same 
as the options on a personal profile. If what you’re looking for isn’t covered in 
this section, be sure to check out Part III for detailed information on customizing 
other non-music-related profile options. Either way, it’s good practice.
The main difference between a MySpace music profile and a personal profile 
is the Edit Profile window. When you edit a personal profile, you have options 
for entering and managing all kinds of personal information such as your 
favorite television shows, movies, what town you grew up in, what high 
school/college you attended, and others. In a music profile, you’re asked 

225
 Chapter 14: Rockin’ in the MySpace World
to enter information that is specific to you as a musician. This information 
includes Upcoming Shows, Band Details, Basic Band Info, Song Uploading & 
Management, and Band Listing Info.
To get to your music profile’s Profile Edit window, click the Edit Profile link 
located in the top-left corner of your MySpace home page. The Edit Profile 
link is the very first link to the right of your MySpace direct URL, as shown in 
Figure 14-3. The following sections discuss the various aspects of your music 
profile so you can get the most out of your MySpace page.

Upcoming Shows
No matter how much of a fan base you build online, it won’t do you much 
good if you don’t give them a chance to see you live and in all your harmonic 
glory. Book a gig. Then, book another. Sell out a venue. Keep your fans in the 
loop and aware of every one of your dates via MySpace. It’s the perfect way 
to put your info up and send it out. If you’re going to make it big, you must 
expand awareness of every show you play. You are your biggest promoter.
The first tab in the Edit Profile window is Upcoming Shows. This is the place 
where you add, delete, and edit the details of any shows you’ll be playing in 
the near future. To enter your act’s upcoming show, follow these steps:
 
1. Enter a show date and time.
 
 Fill out the date and time of the upcoming musical masterpiece that 
you’ll be playing. You can click the calendar icon to make your date 
selection a little easier.

226

2. Enter a venue and cost.
 
 If you actually want some people to come to your show, it’s probably a 
good idea to let them know where you’re actually playing and how much 
it’ll cost them to get in the door.
 
3. Enter the show location information.
 
 Enter all the show location information that you can. This location info 
can be searched by other MySpacers who might be looking for a show to

 Will you be solo? Should people wear orange tube socks? Is there a great 
place to park that only you know about? Things like these are great 
to add to the description so the people who come to your show know 
everything they need to know for maximum enjoyment. The better time 
they have, the more likely they are to love your band and come to the 
next show, and the next, and the next. . . .

Band Details
The Band Details tab is where you can enter all the wonderful information 
that you feel the general public should know about you or your band. This 
section is split into specific segments that are designed to give people a 
better feel for what type of band you are and what type of music you play. 
After it’s entered, all this information will be displayed on your public music 
profile for the world to see. It’s a good idea to fill out as much of this as pos-
sible — that way, if someone who’s never heard of you before stumbles upon 
your piece of the MySpace world, your new visitor will get a good under-
standing of what you’re all about.
As shown in Figure 14-7, there are several sections that make up the Edit Band 
Bio window. Each section has an Edit button so you can go in and modify any 
information that you entered, whenever you feel the need to do so.
 
Figure 14-7: 
The Edit 
Band Bio 
window is 
made up 
of eight 
sections.
 
The sections that you can change are as follows:
 
 Headline: The Headline is the quoted text that appears next to your 
profile picture on your public profile. This is something that most people 
will read when they find your MySpace page, so the more clever, the better.
 
 Bio: Every band or musician has a story. This section lets you tell it. 
Where did you come from? Where do you want to go? Why music? These 
are all questions that you can answer in the Bio section. Feel free to add 
pictures and links to give it even more depth.

229
 Chapter 14: Rockin’ in the MySpace World
 
 Members: Who makes up the band — what are their names, what do 
they play, who are their favorite performers? Let everyone in on this 
information — and more — in this section.
 
 Influences: Many musicians started playing in the first place because 
other musicians inspired them at some time in their lives. Did someone 
ever inspire you — how about two or three musical heroes of yours? If 
so, feel free to add them here. This is a great place to add links for addi-
tional information on your influences; don’t expect the general public to 
know musicians as well as you do.
 
 Sounds Like: “If you like blank, you’ll definitely dig our music.” If you’ve 
ever said this, fill in this section, putting whomever you’re using as a role 
model in the blank. It’s always good to relate your music to a more well-
known band so people can get a better feel for what type of music you play.
 
 Web Site: If you have another site that’s outside the MySpace world, 
type it here so your fans can check it out. MySpace is a great tool for 
driving online traffic to other Web sites — so don’t be afraid to use it 
that way.
 
 Record Label: Every musician wants a record label, but few actually 
have one. If you’re one of the lucky few, fill out this section with a big 
smile on your face.
 
 Label Type: There are three choices for this section: Unsigned, Major, 
and Indie. Pick whichever one fits and go with it.
 
Just as with a personal profile, HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) can be 
used in these sections. This can help you add a more branded and engaging 
look to your music profile page, which could help draw more attention to your 
music. See Chapter 12 for more of the nuts and bolts of changing the look of 
your profile page to match your image.
Basic Info
The Basic Info tab is pretty straightforward. It’s where you can edit your 
band’s name and location information. It’s no secret that bands often go through 
many changes as they move along — even the most successful ones — and if 
you just happen to feel the urge to give your band a different name, this is the 
place to make that change.
Manage Songs
Allowing those who come to your music page the ability to instantly listen to 
your songs through the MySpace Music Player is one of the major benefits 
of setting up a MySpace music profile. When you’re ready to upload a few of 

230
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
your tunes so all the world can hear all that hard work you put in behind the 
recording mic, the Manage Songs tab is where you need to be. The steps to 
add a new song are as follows:
 
1. Click the Add link in the Manage Songs window.
 
 When you first click the Manage Songs tab, you’re taken to the Manage 
Songs window. Here are two links that get you on your way to uploading 
your first song to MySpace. You can click the Add link in the Add Your 
First Song text box or you can click the Add a Song link in the Current 
Songs heading in the upper-right corner of the Manage Songs window, as 
shown in Figure 14-8.
 
Figure 14-8:

2. Enter all song details and click the Update button.
 
 After you click the Add link, you’re taken to the Edit Song Details window, 
where you can add all the information about the song you’re about to 
upload. Enter the Song Name, Album Name, Album Year, Record Label, 
and Lyrics. If you’re in a hurry, you can skip most of this stuff for now — 
the only required field that you must fill in is the Song Name.
 
 Pay attention to the two check boxes at the bottom of the Edit Song 
Details window. These two check boxes are options for how users can 
interact with the songs that you upload to the MySpace Music Player. 
The two options are
 
• Allow Users to Rank This Song: By selecting this option, your 
fellow MySpacers can not only listen to your songs, but they can 
also rank them on a scale from 1 to 10 and comment on the song 
too. This gives your fans a chance to let you know exactly how 
they feel about your tunes.

231
 Chapter 14: Rockin’ in the MySpace World
 
 Selecting this box can open a great channel for feedback from 
listeners — just be sure that you’re ready to hear it.
 
• Allow Users to Download This Song: If you want to give your lis-
teners the option to download your song from the MySpace Music 
Player, select this option. Most bands that are signed to a label 
don’t use this option because they obviously want their listeners 
to buy their music. But, if your main goal is to just get your music 
out there for as many people to hear as possible, why not let your 
listeners download it?
 
 One of the great things about this option is that your songs are 
hosted by MySpace — so theoretically a song of yours could be 
downloaded a million times and you wouldn’t have to pay for one 
cent of bandwidth costs. MySpace is there to take care of all that. 
Pretty nice of them, eh? (Of course, whether you make any money 
from all that downloading is a whole other issue.)
 
3. Upload the MP3 file of your song.
 
 After you enter all your song information and click the Update button, 
you’re taken to the MP3 upload window, as shown in Figure 14-9. This 
is where you upload the MP3 file of the song you wish to add to your 
MySpace Music Player. It’s a simple process:
 
a. Click the Browse button and locate the MP3 on your local hard drive.
 
b. After you find the MP3 you’re looking for, select it and click the 
Upload button.
 
 This uploads your MP3 to MySpace so it can be streamed from the 
Music Player on your MySpace music profile.
 
Figure 14-9:

window is

232
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
 
 An MP3 file (short for MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3) has quickly become the 
standard for digital music over the past few years. It is by far the most 
popular and widely used audio format on the Internet today. Although 
there are many different types of audio file formats, MySpace only allows 
MP3s to be uploaded to their Music Player. If you want to know more 
about digital music and MP3s, check out Windows XP Digital Music For 
Dummies by Ryan Williams (Wiley Publishing, Inc.). It covers how to 
create, manage, and distribute audio in a digital world. For MySpace, 
stick with MP3s.
 
4. Upload an image for your song.
 
 After you upload the MP3 file for your song, you then have the option of 
adding an image for the song as well. This is all done through the Upload 
Song Photo window that you’re taken to after your MP3’s upload is com-
pleted. You can add a different image to each song that you upload, and 
don’t worry, if you want to change these images later, you can. You can 
add an image now if you like — or you can click the Skip for Now link 
and add it later. To add an image, you have two (probably very familiar) 
things to do:
 
a. Click the Browse button to select an image from your local hard 
drive.
 
b. After you’ve selected the image, click the Upload button to add it 
to your song.
 
 If you see a pattern emerging here, you’re on to something.
 
5. Upload additional songs.
 
 After you upload the MP3 file for your song, you then have the option 
of adding an image for the song as well. After you finish with the Upload 
Song Photo window, you wind up back at the main Manage Songs 
window. At this point, you can add another song if you like. There are 
just a few things to remember at this point:
 
• MySpace allows you to upload four songs to your MySpace Music 
Player, so feel free to add more if you want.
 
• After you add a song, MySpace will process the MP3 so it can be 
streamed via your Music Player.
 
• The amount of time for this whole process to finish its business 
depends on the amount of MySpace traffic during your upload and 
the size of your MP3 file.
 
• While MySpace is processing your newly uploaded musical master-
pieces, there’s a red Processing message under the image of those 
particular songs, as shown in Figure 14-10. This lets you know that 
MySpace is working on getting those particular files up and run-
ning on your Music Player.
 
 After the Processing message is gone, your music is streaming on your 
public MySpace profile.

6. Choose your Page Settings.
 
 Now that you’ve uploaded your songs to MySpace, they’ll be added to 
your MySpace Music Player, so anyone who comes to your music profile 
can listen to your tunes. With this addition of music to your profile, you 
now have a few more options that you can choose to modify regarding 
the songs you’ve posted. These three options are shown as check boxes 
on the main Manage Songs window under the Page Settings heading. 
Here’s what these options do:
 
• Allow Users to Add Songs to Their Profile: Any MySpacer has the 
option to add any song that’s posted to MySpace to his or her per-
sonal profile — but only if the artist explicitly allows it by selecting 
this check box.
 
 By clicking the Add link under a song that’s listed on a musician’s 
MySpace Music Player, as shown in Figure 14-11, any user can add 
your song to their MySpace profile.
 
 By allowing other MySpacers to add your song to their profiles, 
you’re giving your fans (and other people who like your music 
but may not want to rip your shirt off) the chance to promote your 
tunes to whomever happens to visit their personal MySpace pages. 
Note that this option is deselected by default; if you want it, select it.
 
• Auto-Play First Song When Someone Views My Profile: If this option 
is selected, your MySpace Music Player begins to play your songs 
as soon as someone opens your music profile. Many musicians like 
this option; the idea is that when a potential fan lands on your space, 
those new ears get to hear at least a few seconds of your music before 
they can leave. These few seconds could be enough of a listen to keep 

234
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
them around a little longer and could potentially result in your gaining 
a newfound fan — which is never a bad thing. No wonder this option 
is selected by default.
 
• Check This Box to Randomize Song Play. If the Box is Left 
Unchecked, Your First Song Will Play: This option is basically the 
MySpace Music Player’s version of a shuffle. If you want one song 
in particular to play every time someone visits your profile, leave 
this unchecked. Many bands like to randomize their songs because 
they don’t want a frequent visitor to hear the same thing over 
and over with every visit (that’s thinking like a visitor — pretty 
savvy). But if you want to make sure everyone hears the song you 
think is destined to be the next huge hit single, leave this option 
unchecked — and let your future blockbuster play on. This option 
is unchecked by default.

Listing Info
If you’re reading this and you’re a musician, you know how quickly a band 
can break up, change members, switch genres, and modify its name. If you or 
your band decides that you should now play jazz instead of rockabilly — or 
you’ve added some hip-hop to your act — you can make sure that your MySpace 
music profile reflects it. Your Listing Info window allows you to change/add 
genres to your music as well as change your MySpace music URL. If you’re start-
ing to suspect that the URL MySpace.com/CrazyDinosaurUncles doesn’t 
quite fit your folk-music groove, no problem: You can change that URL with a 
click of a button on the Listing Info tab. Keep that folk music rocking!

MySpace — a Music Fan’s Paradise
Thousands of bands are putting music into the MySpace world, and millions 
of people are eagerly consuming it, creating an unparalleled distribution 
environment. With so many choices about the music you can hear and where 
and how you consume it, it’s truly an amazing time to be a music fan. Certain 
music-related elements have been around since the beginning of MySpace, 
but when it comes to music, there’s always something fresh and new lurking 
up MySpace’s digital sleeve. It’s part of what continues to fuel the phenom-
enal growth and success of this online community.
In the following sections, you discover some of the ways that the millions of 
MySpacers can currently interact with music on a day-to-day basis as well as 
some things that are coming up just around the corner. It’s safe to say that 
everyone likes to involve music in their lives in one way or another — and 
with MySpace, getting your musical fix has never been easier.
The almighty MySpace Music Player
If you want to pinpoint one of the things that drove musicians to MySpace by 
the truckload, look no further than the MySpace Music Player. The MySpace 
Music Player — as shown in Figure 14-12 — has been a feature of MySpace 
from the beginning. By now, it’s become the most popular way to listen to 
music online. The MySpace Music Player gave musicians an outlet to the 
masses — offering an even playing field for any band that used it, no matter 
how obscure. Who needs radio play when you could (potentially, anyway) 
have millions of people listen to your song on MySpace? With MySpace, any 
band has a shot at building an astronomical audience of listeners — and it all 
started with this somewhat simple streaming music player. Brilliant.
 
Figure 14-12:
 The 
MySpace 
Music 
Player is 
one feature 
that benefits 
musicians 
as well as 
their fans. 

236
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
Though the bands and musicians love the MySpace Music Player, the fans on 
MySpace love it even more. A band’s MySpace Music Player gives any poten-
tial fan an instant taste of what the musician has to offer. No downloads, no 
payment, and no hassles. Giving power to the people has never been so hip.
So what makes up this seemingly simple Music Player? Check out the 
following list:
 
 Instant access: You want to hear the music now? You got it. The MySpace 
Music Player gives anyone the opportunity to listen to that potential-next-
breakthrough band instantly. The proof is right there — and you so totally 
knew them before they went mainstream and sold out.
 
 Interaction and feedback: So you really like that song, huh? Or maybe 
you really can’t stand that song. Either way, you now have a platform for 
voicing your opinion to the rest of the MySpace community. The MySpace 
Music Player has a rating and comment system that lets you voice what-
ever opinion you want to, when you want to. The musicians also have 
the option of allowing song downloads through the MySpace Music 
Player — making you potentially only one click away from having your 
own copy of their must-have MP3s.
 
 Also — have you always wondered what that band was actually singing 
in that one song you can’t seem to get out of your head? The MySpace 
Music Player has a Lyrics option too, so wonder no more — it’s all 
spelled out in black and white.
 
 Easy to distribute: No longer do you have to send songs via e-mail or 
instant message so your friends can listen to that new song you just dis-
covered by that band no one’s heard of yet (but you figure everybody 
will know about real soon now). Just send them the band’s MySpace 
URL, and they’ll be listening in no time.
 
 Standalone Player option: If you just can’t seem to get enough of that 
new band, but you can’t hang out on MySpace at work all day (even if 
you want to), click the Standalone Player button that’s on each MySpace 
Music Player. You then have your own personal jukebox full of your 
band’s goodies that can float over even the harshest of Excel spread-
sheets during your workday.
 
 Ability to add songs to personal profile: Any song that you can listen to 
on a musician’s MySpace Music Player can potentially be added to your 
personal MySpace page as well. You can do this handy bit of magic by 
clicking the Add button below each song — it’s just that easy. And it’s 
a great way to show your friends your new favorite song — while also 
adding a little bit of personality to your page.

Top Artist listings
Everyone enjoys music — but let’s face it, we don’t have the time or the 
energy to constantly keep up with which bands are hot at any given moment. 
MySpace realizes this and has created something that might just help you 
keep up with the who’s who of the MySpace music world. This simple yet 
powerful MySpace music feature is the MySpace Top Artists listings. These 
listings are a quick and easy way to find out who’s making some serious noise 
on MySpace. Think of it as the MySpace version of the Billboard Top Ten.
You can check out the Top Artists listings by first clicking the Music link in 
the main MySpace navigation and then by clicking the Top Artists link in the 
main music navigation links.
After you have the Top Artists window on-screen, as shown in Figure 14-13, 
you can then sort the Top Artists by several different criteria such as 
Country, State, and Genre. Want to see who the hot, local rock musicians are 
in Indiana? Just select United States, Indiana, and Rock, click Update, and 
then see who comes up. The Top Artists are also separated into columns 
depending on whether is the band is unsigned, indie (independent), or signed 
to a major record label.
The Top Artists are ranked depending on the play that their MySpace Music 
Player is getting, so it is a true view of what the millions of MySpacers are 
currently listening to. This is different than the Featured Artists on MySpace, 
which are dictated by the MySpace powers that be.

Music Videos
As numbers and airtime for music videos on television continue to drop, the 
popularity of music videos on sites like MySpace is quickly picking up the 
slack. Music videos on MySpace Music are getting more views every single 
day, and they’ve become the easiest way to see your favorite mainstream 
musician doing their thing. Unlike television viewers, MySpacers no longer 
need to tune in at certain times to catch a glimpse of the latest and greatest 
music videos (and hope the good ones are on the air). They can now get the 
videos they want, when they want them, in a place where they’re already 
spending their time.
If you want to watch a few videos, click the Music link in the main MySpace 
navigation and then click the Music Videos link in the main music navigation. 
This takes you to the MySpace Music Videos window, as shown in Figure 14-14, 
where you can watch the most popular videos or search for a particular artist, 
song, or genre. All your favorite music videos are now at your fingertips — it’s 
a beautiful thing.
 
Figure 14-14:

Finding live shows
With MySpace, it’s never been easier to find new music you love, catch the 
details about local shows in your area, and even get in touch with others 
who have similar musical tastes. So, if you live on a farm in Iowa but can’t get 
enough Cajun Zydeco music, you can still keep your finger on the pulse.

 Chapter 14: Rockin’ in the MySpace World
With the incredible number of bands that are constantly writing updates, posting 
their tour schedules, and relying on MySpace to promote and distribute their 
music, you’ll have a hard time finding a better resource for getting information 
on live music on the Net. You want to find the next reggae show within 20 
miles of the town you live in? No problem. Looking for a local hardcore rock 
show for some stress relief during your business trip? Piece of cake. With 
the shows search feature that’s included in the MySpace Music section, your 
next live music show is just a few clicks away.
Want to give the shows search a shot? Click the Music link in the main MySpace 
navigation and then click the Shows link in the main music navigation. When 
you get to the main shows search window, as shown in Figure 14-15, you simply 
add a ZIP code, a maximum distance for the search to cover, and the genre of 
music you want to find. Click the Sort button, and every live show within your 
requested area is shown. The shows are sorted by date, and you can click the 
band or venue for more show information.

The future of music on MySpace
Music serves as the poster child for digital convergence. As media has found 
its way to digital format, and shortly thereafter, the Internet, the way in 
which we enjoy our favorite tunes has forever changed. MySpace is continu-
ing this evolution and helping millions of fans experience music they love.
Although MySpace has been very innovative up to this point when it comes 
to giving the public new and fresh ways to interact with music, without 
constantly adding new features and tools, MySpace could lose its very valu-
able audience of musicians. So how does MySpace keep the millions of people 
constantly coming back for more? Don’t worry, it has a few things up its sleeve 
that could potentially begin to redefine how you listen to, distribute, and buy 
your favorite tunes. MySpace has gathered the audience, and now it’s time to 

240
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
give this audience what they want, when they want it, and how they want 
it. Here are a few new and innovative things that have either just hit the 
MySpace world or that are coming soon:
 
 AT&T’s Mobile Music Studio: If you haven’t noticed, ringtones are 
everywhere. You hear them at work, at the mall, and (unfortunately) 
sometimes in a movie theatre. At the moment, most of these ringtones 
are produced by big-time music labels — and (no surprise here) are songs 
played by mainstream artists. Well, MySpace has decided to shake up this 
model a bit — behold the AT&T Mobile Music Studio. Now any musician 
who has a few songs and a MySpace account can do the ringtone thing — 
not only create ringtones, but also sell them through MySpace. It’s a new 
type of ringtone democracy — and it’s happening now.
 
 Paid music downloads: At the time of the writing of this book, MySpace 
has been in talks with PayPal, an online payment gateway, about creat-
ing an all-new paid music portal on MySpace that would rival the current 
800-pound gorilla of music downloads, iTunes. With 100+ million mem-
bers and climbing, who says that this can’t work? It’s just the next big 
thing for MySpace. We’re sure there’s more where this came from.
 
 Third-party tools: Some of the latest tools for MySpace aren’t necessar-
ily created by MySpace. Many third-party software developers are cre-
ating online widgets that can be used within the MySpace world. Some 
of these things include video platforms, news feeds, and various online 
payment systems. The popularity of MySpace looks like it won’t be 
slowing down anytime soon — so don’t be surprised if these third-party 
developers continue to jump on the MySpace bandwagon.
 
 So, whether you’re a musician or just someone who wants to find some 
great tunes on the ’Net, MySpace definitely rocks as the place to get 
your fix for all things music. As the popularity of MySpace has grown, 
the tools and services that the community provides only get better and 
better. What will MySpace come up with next? All you have to do is log 
on to find out.

A
t some point over the course of human civilization, we realized that 
there’s power in numbers. Because of that, we’ve spent thousands of 
years gathering together in a variety of ways. We gather as families, friends, 
and fans. We participate in churches, clubs, and companies. Although the 
various members of any such group may have differing levels of involvement 
and different responsibilities therein (janitor, accountant, sales manager, and 
so on), they all come together for a common interest or for the pursuit of a 
common goal. Life on the Internet has followed suit with the emergence of 
online social networking.
Though many people gather on MySpace, they come for a multitude of reasons. 
Not only is this a place for musicians, their fans, their fans’ friends, and so on, it’s 
increasingly the destination for a multitude of other groups who are seeking an 
audience. In this chapter, you find out more about how MySpace is creating tools 
and forums to help its millions of users not only show what they have but also 
find just the kind of fan involvement they need.
Build It, and They Will Come
As membership at MySpace continues to grow, so does its ability to create 
and connect more specific groups of people with each other. The more 
people, the bigger the audience becomes — and the more specific the niches 
can become. Because of the huge numbers of diverse people, MySpace can 
now separate profiles and create specific tools and services to provide an 
even better user experience.

242
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
The quick appeal and adoption of music profiles definitely jumpstarted the 
MySpace community — and proved that it was a model for online interconnec-
tion that would resonate with people. But now, with its mainstream acceptance, 
there’s a huge opportunity and a growing demand for places other than music-
dominated sites; millions of MySpacers want to carve out their digital niches and 
score their daily doses of information on all sorts of creative interests. MySpace 
has responded to this new demand by creating new specialty-profile options — 
as well as some online services that are starting to make MySpace the one-stop 
shop for all things Web. The bigger the audience, the more new and innovative 
things MySpace can develop for its users. With the incredible growth MySpace is 
now seeing, who knows what will come next? A look at some of its more creative 
niches may offer a clue. . . .
MySpace Filmmakers
MySpace entered into the online world at a time when video creation, distri-
bution, and consumption was becoming easier than ever for the population 
at large. The world’s video-distribution channels are no longer restricted to 
that big box in your living room and that monster-sized Cineplex that’s down 
the street from you. With a little bit of knowledge, cash, and an Internet con-
nection, anyone can now create videos — and potentially get them viewed by 
millions of people within minutes. It’s the democratization of media — and 
MySpace has staked its claim in the middle of the revolution. If you have 
something to say, get it out there — the best work gets noticed, as do the 
people who create it.
It’s a whole new age of consumer-driven video and prosumers — folks who use 
semipro equipment to fill the roles of both media producers and consumers. No 
wonder a need has sprung up for new ways to organize and make sense of this 
massive influx of online video to Web sites such as MySpace. Well, we can safely 
advise our video-producing friends not to fret. MySpace has not only noticed the 
need, it’s actually done something about it: MySpace has created a specialty pro-
file specifically for filmmakers. To all the future Quentin Tarantinos and Steven 
Spielbergs out there, welcome — MySpace has been waiting for you.
Opportunity awaits
For as long as you can remember, the bright lights of Hollywood have been 
calling your name. Since you were 8 years old, you’ve found ways to work 
phrases into your everyday conversation such as, “Let’s do lunch,” “I’ll be 
in my trailer,” and “Don’t even think of getting a scratch on my Maserati.” 
There’s already a vacant spot on your mantle — just between the Mr. T bobble-
head and the aromatherapy candle — waiting for your first Academy Award.

 Chapter 15: Finding Your Place on MySpace
Thanks to affordable technology, it’s never been easier to get started making 
films. For a few hundred dollars, you can pick up a digital video camera and 
all the software you need to pull together that amazing story you’ve been aching 
to tell. With the further emergence of broadband Internet as a delivery system — 
and online video as content — technology has also made it significantly easier 
to get your film seen by the masses. The playing field is more even than ever 
before — it’s all a matter of how you choose to take advantage of it. MySpace is 
ready to help get you on your way to the red carpet.
Perks of a MySpace Filmmaker profile
Ready to make your mark in the world of film? Well, first things first, and a 
great place to start your soon-to-be-incredibly-rich-and-famous film career is 
on MySpace. Just as with music, MySpace has a specialty profile that can be 
created specifically for filmmakers. Choosing to create a MySpace Filmmaker 
profile gives you access to tools and services that are designed to get your 
filmmaking off to a flying start. A few of these include
 
 Filmmaker Info: Along with the normal information that you’d include 
on a personal MySpace profile, a Filmmaker profile goes a few steps 
further — giving you places to add information specific to filmmaking 
and to your videos as you bring them to (at first) the small screen. You 
can list your role in filmmaking, awards you’ve won, festivals you’ve 
attended, and more.
 
 The Filmmaker profile is built for those who are in the industry, so it’s impor-
tant that the information you add reflects that level of professionalism.
 
 Screenings Calendar: Musicians have to book live shows, and film-
makers have an equivalent: booking movie screenings. Even though 
MySpace gives you a way to reach and gather up an audience for your 
films, its true power and value show up best when you can get your 
fans to leave their computers and head over to a theater to check out 
your work. Posting your screenings — and getting them in front of your 
MySpace fanatics — is the first step in making your next screening 
standing-room-only.
 
 Video Management: The MySpace Filmmaker profile makes it really 
easy for you to manage all the video you’re producing. With film-specific 
information for each film — and the capability to upload films to a video 
player that appears on-screen on your profile — showcasing your films 
has never been easier.

Creating your Filmmaker profile
Creating a Filmmaker profile is very similar to creating a personal MySpace 
profile — discussed in Chapter 2 — except you’ll find a few differences that 
make this type of profile an easy-to-use platform to show off your video mas-
terpieces. So when you’re ready — take a breath, focus, and imagine yourself 
taking that one big step toward creating the blockbuster that’s playing in the 
back of your mind. Then follow these steps to create your Filmmaker profile:
 
1. Click the Film link at the top of the MySpace.com home page.
 
 This takes you to the MySpace Film portal — the home for all things film.
 
2. Click the Filmmaker Signup link in the main MySpace Film naviga-
tional links.
 
 The Filmmaker Signup link, as shown in Figure 15-1, is the very last link 
on the right side of the MySpace Film navigational links. After clicking 
this link, you’re taken to the Filmmaker registration window.
 
Figure 15-1: 
The 
Filmmaker 
Signup link 
is located 
on the far-
right side 
of the main

3. Enter your basic account information.
 
 Enter your e-mail address, username, location, and date of birth and 
then select the I Accept the Terms of Service/Privacy Policy check box 
and click the Sign Up button to get your registration rolling. After you 
submit your basic account information, you may have to enter a verifica-
tion code before continuing. This is to prevent automated spam profiles, 
and it only takes a few seconds to complete.

245
 Chapter 15: Finding Your Place on MySpace
 
4. Enter your specific film information.
 
 The next Additional Info window, shown in Figure 15-2, allows you to enter 
your specific filmmaking information — such as your role in the process, 
your current filmmaker status, and any awards you’ve won. When you’re 
done entering this information, it’s displayed on your public profile. (Think 
of it as an instant online résumé.) Click the Continue button to keep your 
registration moving along.
 
 If you’re in a hurry, you only need to select one Role and your Status. 
You can add the rest of the info later if needed by editing your profile 
information.

information

window.
 
 
5. Upload your profile photo.
 
 You know that having a great video isn’t the only thing that makes you a 
successful filmmaker. You have to act the part — and convincingly — to 
let people know who you are and what your work is all about. You can 
help other MySpacers paint the picture of who you really are by adding 
some photos of yourself to your profile — to demonstrate that you’re so 
much more than just another warm body behind the lens. At the very least, 
adding a photo as your profile picture lets the other users on MySpace 
know that your profile is legit. To upload a photo, click the Browse button 
on the Upload Photo form, find a photo or image on your local hard drive, 
select it, and click the Upload button. Piece of cake, right?
 
 If, for some reason, you’re superimpatient, you can click the Skip for 
Now link at the bottom of the photo-upload form to move on to the next 
step without adding a photo. But make sure that you add one sometime 
soon, you don’t want to be that person without any photos, especially if 
you’re offering work in a visual medium.

6. Invite some of your friends to MySpace.
 
 Ah, publicity — the filmmaker’s friend. Starting modestly by generating a 
little buzz may be the ticket — so why not increase your MySpace audi-
ence directly? If you happen to have some friends you think would enjoy 
becoming part of the MySpace world — but they haven’t made the move 
yet — feel free to invite them with the MySpace invitation form. If you don’t 
feel the need to send anything out, click the Skip for Now link in the bottom-
right corner of the invitation form and you’re one step closer to creating 
your profile. (Don’t worry, you’re almost done — you should be able to 
see the light at the end of the tunnel.)
 
7. Upload your first film.
 
 At this point, your Filmmaker profile is actually created — congratula-
tions. You’re now taken to the Upload Videos window on the myspacetv.
com video portal, as shown in Figure 15-3. MySpace created this portal 
as a way for all things MySpace video to be in one central location. 
As you continue to manage your Filmmaking profile, this will be your 
main window for adding, deleting, and editing your film’s information. If 
you’re feeling a little frisky about keeping this MySpace train rolling and 
you happen to have your first film ready to upload, go ahead! You can 
find the details about how to complete the upload in the next section, 
“Managing your Filmmaker profile.” You can always come back later to 
use the Manage Films window, so it’s no big deal if you want to add a few 
films after you take a quick nap.

 Chapter 15: Finding Your Place on MySpace
You’ve staked your filmmaking claim in the land of MySpace by creating an 
official Filmmaker profile, so now what? Well, the next step is getting your 
videos online — and to cultivate your understanding of how to make your 
profile start working for you. The following sections help you figure out all 
this — so keep on reading. You don’t want to keep Hollywood waiting.
Managing your Filmmaker profile
Creating the profile and adding the films are the start, but by no means do they 
guarantee that anyone will take notice. MySpace delivers the audience — and 
it provides all sorts of tools to help you reach out to all those people — but if 
you fail to initiate at least some communication, you’ll have to struggle to reap 
any rewards. Commit to taking advantage of the contacts MySpace makes avail-
able — and reach out through consistent, regular correspondence with the 
people who have an interest in your work. For tips on how to do that, check 
out Chapter 5.
After you create your Filmmaker profile, all your film-specific options can be 
found by clicking the Edit Profile link. As shown in Figure 15-4, the Edit Profile 
link is located on your MySpace home page, just to the right of your direct 
MySpace URL. These options are the main differences between a Filmmaker 
profile and a personal profile on MySpace — and they’ve been created spe-
cifically to help you manage and distribute your films to your heart’s content.
Three main tabbed sections are found in your Edit Profile window. By editing 
the information within each section, you can flesh out your Filmmaker profile 
in its most productive direction. We give you a closer look at each section.

Film Maker Details
The Film Maker Details tab, shown in Figure 15-5, lets you manage a majority 
of the text and information that will be displayed on your public Filmmaker 
profile. Eight fields are listed under this tab that you can enter information 
into. To edit any of the fields, simply click the Edit link that’s located under 
each one. The fields are as follows:
 
Figure 15-5: 
The Film 
Maker 
Details tab 
is where 
you can add 
information 
that will 
show up on 
your public 
Filmmaker 
profile. 
 
 Roles: This is where you can list what your role is in relation to the films 
being showcased on your profile page. Are you a jack-of-all-trades — 
multiple personalities, all talented? Three options are available, so you 
should be taken care of.
 
 Status: Are you a full-out pro or are you still figuring out the tricks of 
the trade at that superhip film school out in California? Let people know 
your film status by announcing yourself as a Student, a Professional, or 
an Amateur.
 
 Web Site: Here’s where you list any other sites you might have that con-
tribute to your filmmaking. MySpace can be a great tool for sending people 
to already-established Web sites outside (but related to) the MySpace 
world. Remember, an entire Web’s out there — take advantage of it.
 
 Influences: In this field, you can enter names of the people who have 
inspired you to become the remarkable filmmaker that you are today. This, 
of course, is a digital shout-out to those you admire. Give ’em a holler!
 
 Directors: You can list any directors that you admire here. Or if you’re a 
director, feel free to list yourself — after all, you’ve earned it. Nothing’s 
wrong with a little self-promotion, right?

249
 Chapter 15: Finding Your Place on MySpace
 
 Awards: Let the world know just how awesome you really are by adding 
a few of your awards to your profile. No awards to speak of? Make up a 
few (Sasquatch Documentarian of the Decade, Hopscotch Grand Master, 
Prom Video Editing Co-Chair, and so on) and see if anyone notices. As 
long as your imagination is rampant and obvious, what could it hurt?
 
 Festivals: For many filmmakers, going to festivals can make or break 
their careers. If you’re going to any festivals — or are making serious 
plans to go — add them in this field.
 
 Professional Affiliations: Show people just how connected you are by 
listing the professional organizations you belong to, and who you’ve 
worked with — or who you’re currently working for — in the industry. 
Maybe you’ll find some fellow members you’ve never met.
 
For most of these fields, MySpace allows you to add text to your heart’s content —
’til the sun comes up, the cows come home, or (okay) you get it all said. You can also 
use HTML in many of these fields as well, so feel free to add any videos, images, and 
links that can help tell your story with maximum panache. Need some HTML tips? 
Check out the Cheat Sheet included with this book for a jumpstart.
Film Maker Screenings
Even with the nearly overwhelming amounts of video available online these 
days, lots of folks still have the desire to move away from the computers now 
and then — and into an actual movie theatre. (And why not? The screens are 
way bigger.) When you finally finish your next big film, you’ll want people 
to come check out your screenings. MySpace knows this and has created a 
great way to help you get your audience in the know about your upcoming 
events.
The Screenings tab, as shown in Figure 15-6, is where you can start adding 
the events that you want people to know about. To add an event, fill out all 
the information in the Screenings form — which includes the screening date 
and time, the location, the cost, and a description of the event. After you 
have it all filled out, click the Update button to save the event information.
After you add an event here, it’s listed at the bottom of the Screenings 
window for review and editing if needed. The event information is also 
displayed at the top of your public Filmmaker profile in the Upcoming 
Screenings section, as shown in Figure 15-7. This section won’t appear unless 
you’ve entered at least one upcoming event.
 
Just because the box is labeled Upcoming Screenings, don’t feel like those 
are the only events you can list here. Any other parties, events, or casual get-
togethers that you want your fellow MySpacers to know about can also be 
added here. Of course, if they’re film related, so much the better.

Manage Films
Considering that you’ve just set up your MySpace Filmmaker profile, you’re 
probably ready to get to the part where you know how to upload your films 
and other videos so you can start building your army of fans. Well, my friend, 
the Manage Films tab — shown in Figure 15-8 — is the section you’ve been 
waiting for. This is where the movie magic (the organizational part of it, 
anyway) happens.

So you’re finally ready for some video-uploading action, eh? To post your 
initial piece of motion-picture art (or that intriguing clip that showcases your 
potential) to your profile, follow these steps:
 
1. Fill out the Title, Description, and other relevant fields.
 
 Enter any and all the film information you can. Always fill in a title that’s 
short and to the point, a description that goes into a little more detail, 
and some info that allows others to find your film.
 
2. Choose your film’s genre and category.
 
 After you enter the basic information for your film, decide what genre 
you want it entered under. Is it an action flick? Maybe you made a trip to 
the Alamo and shot a Western? Whatever genre you decide to go with, 
be sure to select it before uploading; you only get one choice, so be sure 
to choose wisely. After you choose the genre, also choose up to three 
categories that your film falls under. These selections make your film 
easier to find after it’s uploaded to MySpace — your audience awaits!
 
3. Choose your film’s language and visibility and then agree to the 
MySpace video policy.
 
 The final bits of information that you need to submit before you can 
upload your video file are the film’s language (default is English), 
whether you want the video to be public or private, and whether you 
accept the MySpace video policy. These are a few of the finer details 
that you shouldn’t just skip over, so make sure that you take a moment 
when finishing up these last couple steps.

252
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
 
 After you fill these in, click the Continue button to go to the second 
phase: uploading your video file.
 
4. Upload your video file.
 
 You see the video-upload form — the vehicle that gets your video files to 
MySpace. Do the upload in two stages:
 
a. Click the Browse button and find your video file on your com-
puter’s local hard drive.
 
b. After you find the video file you want, select it and click the 
Upload button to begin the upload.
 
 Depending on your Internet connection and the size of your video file, 
the time that it takes to upload your file will vary. While you’re upload-
ing your file, there’s a status bar that displays the progress, as shown in 
Figure 15-9.
 
 MySpace allows for many different file formats to be uploaded to your 
profile. These allowed file types are RealMedia, or QuickTime format, 
Windows Media, AVI, MPEG, MPG, MP4, and FLV. Also, the maximum 
size for any single video upload is 100MB.
 
5. Wait for your video to process.
 
 After your video file is uploaded successfully, you’re taken directly to 
your My Uploads window, where you can view all the video files that 
you’ve uploaded to MySpace. Depending on the size of the video file that 
you uploaded, it could take several minutes for your video file to pro-
cess so that it is viewable. When you see a thumbnail for your upload in 
this window, your video upload is ready for viewing.
 
Figure 15-9: 
The status 
bar lets you 
know the 
progress of 
your video 
file upload.
 

253
 Chapter 15: Finding Your Place on MySpace
After your film is successfully uploaded, feel free to add another film at this 
point if you have one ready. Also, more importantly, after your video files are 
uploaded and processed, they’re loaded into the MySpace video player (as 
shown in Figure 15-10), which appears on your public Filmmaker profile page 
after you upload at least one video file. When your player is up and running, 
it’s a pretty safe bet that you now have over 100 million potential fans — so 
the next order of business is to go find them.

The MySpace Film portal
If you decide to create a MySpace Filmmaker profile, you automatically become 
part of the filmmaking community on MySpace. This means you’ve just joined 
a fast-growing group of MySpacers — any of whom could potentially become 
your filmmaking friends, fans, and teachers. But this also means that the more 
filmmakers that sign up, the more competition you have as you cultivate your 
future audience. It’s a tough world out there, but with enough work and a little 
bit of luck, you can make your way through the clutter.
The MySpace Film portal, shown in Figure 15-11, is MySpace’s way of creating 
order and organization for its massive community of filmmakers. (Coherence. 
What a concept.)
You can make your way over to the MySpace Film portal by clicking the Film 
link in the main MySpace navigation links. When you land on the portal, you 
find a few tools and services that you — whether as filmmaker or fan — 
should be aware of. These features can help keep you up to date on what’s 
new in the world of film — an obvious benefit to your work. Each of these 

254
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
tools and services can be found by clicking the links in the main MySpace 
Film navigation links:
 
 Filmmaker Search: You can search MySpace for a specific filmmaker 
by her Role, Affiliations, and Location. This makes finding your next 
Screenwriter in Alabama just a few MySpace clicks away.
 
 Top Filmmakers: MySpace filmmakers are ranked in two different ways — 
video views and video rankings. If you want to see who’s attracting all the 
eyeball attention on MySpace in your home state of Indiana, feel free.
 
Figure 15-11: 
The 
MySpace 
Film portal 
is where 
you can find 
out about 
all things 
filmmaking.
 
 
 Screenings: Each filmmaker can enter his or her upcoming screenings 
and events so they’re displayed on the Filmmaker profile. But there’s 
another benefit to posting these events: They’re also listed in this over-
all Screenings listing on MySpace. The search results can be narrowed 
by location too — which makes it a great tool for getting a line on who’s 
doing the most dynamic things in your local film scene.
 
 Filmmaker Forums: Whether you need advice on a location to shoot (say, 
a scene in downtown Indianapolis) or you just want to find other people 
who love creating circus animations — or your interest is music video but 
you’d prefer holding a camera instead of a guitar — the filmmaker forums 
can help you reach out and connect with what you’re looking for.
 
 Filmmaker Classifieds: Just when you thought that camera you’ve had 
for the last five years was going to last another five, it dies on you during 
a critical shoot. Let the rest of the MySpace filmmakers know you’re in the 
market for a new one by posting something in the filmmaker classifieds 
section. You’ll be back up and running in no time.

MySpace Comedians
For some people, making milk shoot out their friends’ noses is a noble goal 
and a never-ending personal challenge. Think of the guy who’s the life of 
the party — or that woman who’s the one you want to hang out with when 
you need a bit of cheering up. Any time is ripe for uproarious laughter from 
friends and polite smiles from strangers. More than likely, this personality 
started early in life, and only grew as time went on. Monikers, such as class 
clown, seem to be thrown around freely, but some of those wacky folks truly 
have a gift. The world may be a stage — but now MySpace can deliver the 
audience.
Joining the MySpace Comedy community
Fortunately, if you’re serious about not being serious, the world of MySpace 
Comedy is a great place to get exposure and continue to hone your craft. 
Whether your goal is to book some shows that are a little more prestigious 
than your cousin’s fifth birthday party, promote your new comedy club, or 
earn your own late-night talk show, the key is all in getting the right exposure 
and building an audience (oh, yeah . . . it’ll also help if you’re actually funny).
In order to get your MySpace Comedy career started, first create a Comedy pro-
file, which MySpace developed just for people like you. Getting a Comedy profile 
up and running is as quick and easy as creating a personal MySpace profile — 
and it has a few cool things that were created specifically to help you showcase 
your humor to the masses. Here’s a quick list:
 
 Gig Management: Keep track of your gigs and let everyone know that you 
host an open mic on Mondays down on Pico, or that you’re headlining at 
the hottest new comedy club in town.
 
 Comedy Focused Information: All the information for your MySpace 
Comedy profile is based on your comedy experiences and influences — 
so anyone who lands on your space can get a good idea of what your 
humor is all about.
 
 Video Clip Management: It’s one thing to tell people that you’re 
funny — and it’s another thing to actually be able to show them. Your 
MySpace Comedy profile lets you show your funniest video clips to the 
world. You’re not camera-shy, are you?
Also, by creating your MySpace Comedy profile, you group yourself automati-
cally with the rest of the comedians who have snagged a spot on the online 
community. This allows for easy connections between you and other comedians, 
as well as the millions of comedy fans who are out there waiting for you to make 
them laugh. The MySpace Comedy portal has quickly become the one-stop shop 
for all things funny on MySpace — and if you’re a MySpace comedian, you’re 

256
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
right in the middle of it. Who knows, if that next clip that you post gets 
enough views, you could find yourself moving up on the Top Comedians list. 
That will get some people’s attention.
Creating your Comedy profile
Your family thinks you’re funny. Your friends think you’re funny. Your co-
workers even think you’re funny. Well, it doesn’t take a genius to figure out 
that if all these people seem to think you have a knack for keeping people in 
stitches, there’s a good chance that a majority of the MySpacers will think so 
too. There’s only one way to find out. . . .
Knock, knock. Who’s there? MySpace. MySpace who? MySpace wants to 
laugh — so what are you waiting for? (Okay, okay. So maybe everybody isn’t 
a comedian.)
Lame playground humor aside, remember: You’re the comedian here. Hurry 
up and follow these steps so you can get your MySpace Comedy profile up 
and running before you have to hear another one of our jokes:
 
1. Click the Comedy link on the MySpace.com home page.
 
 This takes you to the MySpace Comedy portal — be careful, it’s awfully 
funny over there.
 
2. Click the Comedian Signup link in the main MySpace Comedy naviga-
tional links.
 
 The Comedian Signup link — as shown in Figure 15-12 — is the very last 
link on the right side of the MySpace Comedy navigational links. After 
clicking this link, you’re taken to the Comedian Registration window.

3. Enter your basic account information.
 
 Enter your e-mail address, username, location, and date of birth and 
then select the I Accept the Terms of Service/Privacy Policy check 
box and click the Sign Up button to keep your future MySpace comedy 
career moving along. You’ll be all set up before you know it. After you 
submit your basic account information, you may have to enter a verifica-
tion code before continuing. This is to prevent automated spam profiles, 
and it only takes a few seconds to complete.
 
4. Choose your style of comedy.
 
 So, what kind of comedian are you? Improv? Do you have some great 
impersonations of the president? After you figure it all out, select 
at least one genre that you feel fits your style — and then click the 
Continue button.
 
5. Upload some photos to your profile.
 
 You know you want to let people see that new sequined costume that 
you now wear on stage, and you just happen to have a picture. Let the 
world be dazzled — add a few of your latest and greatest photos of your-
self here.
 
 At the very least, upload one photo so you have one for your profile pic-
ture. Uploading a photo is pretty painless:
 
a. Click the Browse button on the Upload Photo form.
 
b. Find a photo or image on your local hard drive.
 
c. Select the photo you want to display and click the Upload button.
 
 Feel free to embrace your inner goofball, just remember what Mom always 
said, “If you hold your face that way for too long, it’ll stick that way.”
After you upload your photos, your Comedy profile is officially created. At 
this point, you can pick your MySpace home page so you can start playing 
with all the cool things that your new space in the MySpace world has to offer.
Although the Comedy profile has some features that are specific to the 
comedy world, most of the communication tools — and how you use them — 
are the same for all MySpace users. Ready to start making a digital name for 
yourself? Start with the basics: Check out Part II for more information on get-
ting connected to your fellow MySpacers.
Managing your MySpace Comedy profile
Getting your Comedy profile set up is a great first step toward phenomenal 
MySpace comedic stardom, but don’t think that it stops there. Now that you 

258
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
have a place for your potential fans to go, keep ’em around awhile — create 
some things for them to interact with when they get there. The last thing you 
want is for someone to lose interest after taking the time to stop by your page — 
if there’s nothing engaging or interesting to play with, he may be outta there. If 
this happens, it’s likely he won’t become your MySpace friend — and may never 
stop by again. I guess that if this happened, it’d be the MySpace equivalent of 
hearing crickets chirping in the background during one of your gigs, when what 
you want is a room full of raucous laughter. Maybe not as bad as getting hit by 
rotten fruit but still not good.
That said, spice the place up a bit. When you’re looking to edit your MySpace 
Comedy profile, the place you always start from is the Edit Profile link on 
your MySpace home page. By clicking the Edit Profile link, as shown in Figure 
15-13, you get wafted away to the main Edit Profile window, where you can 
add, edit, and delete the things on your public profile.
After you find your way to the Edit Profile window, six tabs allow you to 
manage all your MySpace information easily.
 
Figure 15-13: 
The Edit

the right of

Upcoming Gigs
This tab is where you can enter all your upcoming gigs and events that you 
want all your fans to know about. Enter all the information that you can, such 
as Location, Cost, Date, Time, and Description. As shown in Figure 15-14, 
after you enter a new gig, it appears on your public profile for all to see.
Career Details
Feel free to use this tab to lay it all out there about your career and how it 
fits into your life. The more people know about you (up to a certain point, of 

259
 Chapter 15: Finding Your Place on MySpace
course), the more they can relate to you beyond the fact that you’re some-
body funny (we mean that in a good way) on the Internet.

The Upcoming Gigs section
Eight editable fields are listed under this tab that you can enter information 
into. To edit any of the fields, simply click the Edit link that’s located under 
each one. The fields are as follows:
 
 Headline: This is the quote that shows up right next to your profile picture 
on your public profile page. If you’ve always wanted permission to be a 
wiseacre, you have it here: Be a little witty. We dare you.
 
 Bio: I bet no one has any idea that you were raised by a herd of ele-
phants on a tropical South Pacific island. Tell your visitors the story — 
even show them a few pictures if you happen to have some. That should 
keep them coming back for more.
 
 Members: If you have others who join you during your comedic esca-
pades, list them here. There’s no I in TEAM, you know (though there is a 
ME if you rearrange the letters a little bit).
 
 Influences: So many great comedians, so little time to list them. Tell the 
world who’s to blame for making you the crazy, zany person you are 
today.
 
 TV Appearances: Jay Leno. Check. David Letterman. Check. Public 
access cable. Check. COPS. Check. (Wait a minute. Was that one funny?) 
Have you ever graced the world of mass media with your comedy? Go 
ahead and tell everyone how you made Conan O’Brien spit water out of 
his nose during your routine.

260
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
 
 Film Appearances: Many comedians dream about being seen on the big 
screen. If you’ve actually been there, you’d better tell everyone so they 
can be superjealous. Oh, yeah, and see your movie.
 
 Albums: Comedians don’t necessarily need to be seen — most just need 
to be heard. If you have a CD waiting to be bought out there somewhere, 
let your fans know what it is — and how/where they can go buy it.
 
 Website: If you want to get your fans moving to another Web site 
besides your MySpace page, enter it here so they know about it.
Basic Info
Your Basic Info is, well, basic. This is where you can update your MySpace 
display name and location information. To change any of the information, 
click the Edit button at the bottom of the form.
Manage Clips
When you have your own Comedy profile on MySpace, there’s never been a 
better reason (or maybe a perfect excuse) to go out and buy a video camera. 
The Manage Clips tab allows you to upload video clips of basically anything 
that you feel shows the world just how funny you really are. After you upload 
your first few clips, they appear on your profile in an easy-to-use MySpace 
video viewer, as shown in Figure 15-15. Letting your fans watch your shtick, 
getting feedback on new material, and giving your audience behind-the-
scenes access have never been easier.
Listing Info
This information lets people know another Web site that they can find you 
on as well as an option to choose what type of comedy styles you fall under. 
These styles, or genres, are what will categorize you on MySpace searches 
and listings, so make sure it’s up to date and accurate.
After you add all the info, videos, and what-not to your Comedy profile, 
you’re now ready to entertain that future fan of yours who just happens to 
come across your profile. With all the great stuff you’ve added, there’s no 
doubt in your mind that your visitors will be coming back for more — you 
even have the Friend Requests to prove it.
Basic Info (Again)
This is the second Basic Info tab, and it allows you to enter more of your 
personal information that isn’t necessarily related to comedy. These are the 
options that are available on a normal personal MySpace profile, such as the 
schools that you’ve attended, any networking affiliations that you have, what 
companies you have worked for, and other personal background information.

The Beginning of MySpace Services
In the beginning, MySpace was about people connecting with people and find-
ing out about bands they liked. Over time, the large numbers of MySpacers 
have made it an attractive portal for marketers, which has allowed an ever-
expanding roster of services to be created. The sections that follow discuss a 
few of these first such opportunities, but there are many more to come!
MySpace Movies
It’s safe to say that everyone likes movies — even if they don’t all like 
the same ones. Now, you might like comedies whereas the next guys digs 
some drama, but the bottom line is that movies rule. If you haven’t noticed 
lately, movies aren’t too cheap to produce. And for the movie to be a super-
successful hit — maybe even cover its production costs (ya think?) — one 
thing must happen: People must go to the theater to see it. Even today, DVD 
sales just can’t cover the whole expense of making a movie. Well, friend, this 
means the huge movie-production companies need to get the word out about 
their next potential blockbuster — and the channel that gets the message 
communicated most effectively is, more and more, the online world — more 
specifically, MySpace.
This hankering to get the word out to a potential audience is a perfect fit 
with the MySpace Movies section. You want to go see cool movies, the movi-
emakers want you to watch their cool movies, and MySpace has a way to get 
people into the theater to see ’em. Beautiful, isn’t it? The MySpace Movies 
portal, as shown in Figure 15-16, has now become the end-all-and-be-all place 
to find information about all things movie.

out the

portal.
 
Some of the MySpace Movies portal’s features include these:
 
 Show Times and Tickets: With MySpace Movies, you don’t have to leave 
MySpace to go dig up the show times for that next awesome film you want 
to see. And if you don’t feel like waiting in line, there’s an alternative: For 
most of the theatres listed, you can also buy tickets through MySpace.
 
 Movie News: Did you hear about that guy who did that one weird thing 
on the set of that movie in L.A.? (Boy, talk about your generic headline.) 
Well, if you want to know all about it, check out the Movie News section 
for all the latest movie-related news and, of course, gossip.
 
 New Movies: You’ll never feel out of the movie loop with the New Movies 
section. You can read about the movie, find show times, and watch the 
official movie trailers right from MySpace. So if, after all this research, you 
happen to catch a bad movie, it’s no one’s fault but your own.
 
 Top Box Office: MySpace makes it easy to see which movie has been 
bringing in all the cash the past week by posting the top ten movies in 
the Top Box Office section.
MySpace Books
MySpace is fun. Reading is fundamental. What a perfect fit, eh? The MySpace 
Books portal, as shown in Figure 15-17, is a place where you can go to search 

263
 Chapter 15: Finding Your Place on MySpace
for author information, check out the top-sellers list, and even buy a few liter-
ary works if you feel like it. Some of the other things you can do while hanging 
out at the MySpace Books portal include these:
 
 Feature Blogs: Feeling like staying strictly digital when it comes to your 
reading habits? Blogs have quickly become very hot with many Internet 
readers, and MySpace fuels the fire by always showcasing a featured 
MySpace blogger’s work right on the main portal page. With a little help 
from MySpace, it’s never been easier to get your thoughts and ideas out 
to the masses.
 
 Buy Books from Amazon: Thanks to a partnership with Amazon.com, 
MySpace lists several books for sale on its portal page. If you feel like 
you’re ready to make a purchase, you’re only a few clicks away from 
completing an order.
 
 Reader Search: Want to find another MySpacer who’s into the same 
type of books you are? With the Reader Search feature, it’s never been 
easier to pinpoint someone with interests like yours. Search away my 
friend, search away.
 
 Book Groups: The only thing better than reading a great book is talking 
about a great book with other people. The MySpace Book Groups allow 
you to easily find, connect, and interact with those who have your same 
taste in books.

MySpace Jobs
Whether you’re spending it because you have to or you’re spending it 
because you need to, you’re most likely spending cash all the time. But every 
dollar you spend has to come from somewhere — and unless you’re a rich oil 

264
Par t IV: Capturing Your Audience 
tycoon’s kid or have recently hit the lottery, it usually comes in the form of a 
paycheck . . . from your job (or jobs). Ah, yes, that place so many of us spend 
a whole lot of waking hours — the always-fun J-O-B. Basically, everyone 
needs one — and we’re guessing that you may know a few people who are 
currently looking for one. Bottom line: If you don’t have one, you need one — 
and if you have one, you wouldn’t be the only person who wants a different 
one. MySpace can help with that too.
You’ve probably heard of a million different online job-search companies that 
claim that they can get you into that perfect job that you’ve always wanted. 
Well, for these online job-search companies to survive, they need people. Lots 
of people. MySpace currently has over 110+ million registered accounts — they 
must be doing something right — so who better to team up with? People need 
to find jobs, job-search companies have job listings available, and MySpace has 
plenty of people who need jobs — or who may like to find new ones. MySpace 
Jobs to the rescue! The MySpace Jobs portal, shown in Figure 15-18, can help 
the MySpacers of the world search for internships, part-time jobs, and full-time 
jobs. Any MySpace user can also use this portal to search by location as well. 
We’re sure that dream job in California is only a few clicks away.

MySpace News
With many people spending more time online, many people are now relying 
on the Web to get their daily intake of news, both locally and from around 
the world. Well, MySpace noticed this and has not only created a way to con-
sume your daily news, but also a way to let everyone else on MySpace know 
what you find interesting.

265
 Chapter 15: Finding Your Place on MySpace
MySpace News, as shown in Figure 15-19, is a new service that allows any MySpace 
user the ability to vote up or down each news item that they come across 
each day. The top voted (and probably the most interesting) topics rise to 
the top of the news, whereas the ones voted down don’t see the light of day. 
It’s a true user-generated news system that MySpace has created, and it’s out 
there waiting for you to participate, so get going!

ith all MySpace’s highly publicized problems, such as adult users making 
illegal advances toward teenagers and stalkers using the site to find their 
victims, the old advice about an ounce of prevention being worth a pound of 
cure has never been more applicable. Taking the time to change a few settings 
on your MySpace profile can add a level of protection to your MySpace account 
that goes a long way toward keeping it free of problems. This chapter focuses on 
the tools MySpace built into the site to help you keep all the Internet bad guys 
away from your page. In addition to the tools you find in this chapter — by the 
way, we’re giving you 12 of them, not 10 (consider the extra 2 freebies) — we 
have some more helpful safety advice in Chapter 17.
 
For even more in-depth coverage on anything and everything related to safety 
on MySpace, check out Chapter 3.
Set Your Profile to Private
MySpace’s privacy settings allow you to block your full profile from users 
other than the people on your Friend List. Would-be viewers who aren’t on 
your Friend List see your profile name, default photo, gender, age, city/state 
or region, country, last login date, and MySpace URL — but that’s all they 
see. All other info you choose to include about yourself — your personal 
favorites, blog entries, and comments, whatever — won’t show up.

270
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
 
You can change privacy settings by clicking the Settings button in the Control 
Panel and then selecting the Privacy link.
Require E-mail or Last Name 
to Add as a Friend
If you want to limit your Friend Requests to only the people you know in the 
real world, select the Require Last Name or Email Address check box in the 
Communications Settings section of the Settings: Spam window. MySpace 
requires would-be friends to enter either the e-mail address or the last name 
you entered when signing up for the site before it’ll send through a Friend 
Request from any user. This option is helpful if you want to keep your Friend 
List limited to people you already know — but don’t want to take the time to 
review every single Friend Request you receive. This option still allows non-
friends (or yet-to-be-friends) to view your basic profile.
 
For more information on tweaking various friend-related settings to your 
liking, see Chapter 4.
Approve Comments
Sometimes, despite your best efforts to keep a low profile on MySpace, your 
friends can blow your cover. They might leave a comment saying “WE’RE 
THE BEST SENIOR CLASS NORTHEAST HIGH SCHOOL HAS EVER SEEN” or 
“sorry to hear about your breakup, but you should have fun now that you’re 
single again” (yikes) — and tell the world more about you than you want the 
world to know.
The Communications Settings section of the Settings: Spam window allows 
you to approve any comment your friend leaves for your profile page before 
it’s posted. Rather than shooting the comment directly onto your page, this 
setting sends you a message asking you to approve or deny the comment 
before it posts for all to see.
 
The Settings: Spam window also includes an option that limits comments on 
your blog entries to friends only. For more on blogging, see Chapter 6.

271
 Chapter 16: Ten MySpace Tools for Staying Safe
Limit Access to Your Blogs
Diaries have come a long way from the paper journals protected by a tiny 
lock and key that past generations hid under the bed. Blogs have made the 
art of journal writing a public exercise. Of course, you could usually break into 
those old diaries with a paper clip and read your sister’s entries any time you 
wanted — but even then, they weren’t viewable by millions of people at once. 
An online diary is as out-there and visible as it gets. Keep that in mind when 
you decide to blog about your co-workers.
You can reclaim some privacy on your MySpace blog by choosing the privacy 
level of each individual post. You have four choices:
 
 Public: Public blog entries are readable by all MySpace users — friends, 
strangers, visiting Martians, everybody.
 
 Diary: These entries are a throwback to when you kept your writings 
under lock and key. They’re viewable only by you — and you alone. 
Everybody else gets left out because digital locks are impervious to even 
the shiniest of paper clips.
 
 Friends: Friends’ entries are viewable only by the people on your Friend 
List. This is a good setting to use whenever your blog includes personal 
information.
 
 Preferred List: The Preferred List setting carves your audience down to a 
select few people. For example, if you want to share specific family informa-
tion in your blog, you could set a Preferred List to include only your family 
members. That way, your kinfolk are the only ones viewing your entry.
Select your preferred level of privacy on the screen where you make your 
blog entry.
 
Whether you’re interested in more privacy or more accessibility, you can find 
more information on blog settings in Chapter 6.
Keep Your Name Out of Search
The Name option on the Profile Edit screen allows you to remove your real 
first and last names so they aren’t associated with your profile. This change 
keeps other users from finding you if they search your name with MySpace’s 
search tool. You can also change your profile name to something besides 
your real name in the same screen.

272
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Hide Your Photos
In much the same way your MySpace blog can be changed to a private diary, 
you can also turn the photos you upload to MySpace into a private album 
that’s viewable only by you. On the Upload Your Photo page, select the Only 
You option under the Allow Your Photos to Be Viewable By section. The change 
makes your photo page accessible only through your MySpace account. The 
option also removes your default photo from your MySpace profile page.
 
Chapter 10 offers more information on specifying who gets to see your photos — 
and who doesn’t.
Limit Your Instant Message Access
MySpace’s Instant Messaging (IM) tools can be a handy way to drop quick 
notes to your friends. They can also be a pain if you find yourself getting mes-
sages from users you don’t know and don’t care to know. Here are a couple 
ways to limit your IM availability:
 
  Hide your online status: MySpace lets other users know when you’re on 
the site,   presumably available to receive instant messages. Deselecting the 
Online Now option in the Settings: Privacy window blocks MySpace from 
reporting your online status.
 
 Change your instant message privacy settings: The Settings: Spam 
window allows you to let MySpace know whether you do or don’t want 
to get IM invitations from any other MySpacer out there. If you select the 
check box, only your friends can send you an IM invitation.
 
For more information about customizing your instant message settings, see 
Chapter 5.
Block Messages from Non-Friends
MySpace is a great way to connect with other people from all over the world, 
but you always need to make sure that the people you’re connecting with are 
those that you feel comfortable communicating with. Just because you can 
potentially have a chat with millions of people through MySpace, it doesn’t 
necessarily mean that you want to.

273
 Chapter 16: Ten MySpace Tools for Staying Safe
Obviously you’re always in control of who you contact while online, but if 
you want to control who can directly contact you on MySpace, you need to 
pay attention to the Allow Non-Friends to Send Me Messages check box in the 
Communications Settings section of the Settings: Spam window. If you select 
this check box, only your official MySpace friends can send you a message on 
MySpace. This protects you from getting random messages from spammers, 
bands, and other MySpacers, but it could also limit someone’s ability to legit-
imately contact you.
 
Everyone wants to have a great social experience on MySpace, but you also 
need to feel safe and comfortable while doing it. For more info on MySpace’s 
spam settings, see Chapter 3.
Filter Group Invites
A famous comedian once quipped, “I wouldn’t join any club that would have 
me as a member.” Some MySpace groups take the opposite tack — and try 
to add anyone they possibly can. Usually they do that through group invites. 
If you want to avoid the possible guilt-by-association that might come from 
joining just any group, select the Allow Only My Friends And: option in the 
Communications Settings section of the Settings: Spam window. This option 
makes sure only your friends can recommend group membership to you.
 
MySpace is all about groups, but it’s also all about making your own social 
choices. For more on groups and settings, see Chapter 9.
Blocking Users
Sometimes people just can’t take a hint. You ignore their messages, delete 
 their comments,   and set your profile to private,   but they still keep bugging you. 
In cases like this one,   it might be time to block the user. Go to the annoying 
user’s profile page and click the Block User link,  located in the user’s Contact 
box. After verifying the block, add the user to a list that prevents them from 
communicating with you via MySpace. It’s kind of like forwarding all your 
junk mail and telemarketer calls to an empty house far away from where you 
have to deal with them.
 
If the polite equivalent of “Back off!” or “In your dreams!” isn’t getting the 
message across, Chapter 3 provides more information about blocking other 
MySpace users.

274
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
The Delete Key Is Your Friend
It’s your space, after all. If you see something that someone has added to 
your page and you don’t like it, kick it off your page. For example:
 
 Blog comments can be removed.
 
 Photo comments can be deleted.
 
 Friend Requests from creepy-looking strangers can be denied.
 
 Mail messages from people you don’t know can be marked for deletion.
 
 You can resign from groups you’ve joined.
One click gets rid of profile comments you don’t want on your page. Persistently 
pesky friends can vanish from your Friend List so you won’t have to deal with 
their comments, bulletins, or other attempts at contact (on MySpace, anyway). 
And everything you put on your own page — from your photos to your blogs to 
your personality descriptions — can be edited or erased at any given moment. 
Don’t think of your MySpace page as set in stone. It’s a work in progress — you 
can make any changes necessary to get the page you want, no matter what mood 
you’re in on any given day.
Contacting MySpace
We’ve been told since we were kids that nobody likes a tattletale. But MySpace 
wants to hear from you when something on the site just isn’t appropriate or in 
good taste. As much fun as MySpace is, it isn’t a playground and there aren’t 
bullies who will be waiting for you at the curly slide.
Okay, you do have some countermeasures available — and MySpace encour-
ages users to try all the tools we mention in this chapter before letting them 
know that somebody is in violation of their policies. But when someone is 
in obvious violation of its terms of service, MySpace asks that you waste no 
time in contacting them with that user’s URL and an explanation of your com-
plaint. They have no patience for identity theft, spam, violations of the age 
policy, online harassment, libel, false identities, or copyright violation, and 
will certainly be thankful for your helping them avoid trouble (after all, a bad 
apple can ruin the whole bunch). You can get links to MySpace’s customer-
service contact page by clicking the Help link at the top of your profile page.
 
We do want to echo one point that MySpace makes to would-be customer ser-
vice users: If a MySpace user threatens you in any way, not only should you 
let MySpace know, but you should also contact your local law-enforcement 
officials. Just because a threat isn’t made in a physical or face-to-face confron-
tation certainly doesn’t make it any less serious.

W
e mention — way back in the first chapter — that MySpace is a reflec-
tion of the real world. As such, when you use MySpace, you need to 
apply a lot of the same rules for getting by that you use in your everyday life. 
This chapter serves as a reminder of all those little life lessons that also work 
on MySpace.
Okay, we probably sound very parental here, warning you to look both ways 
before you cross the street. We may even sound like one of those hokey 
public-service commercials. No biggie. We figure MySpace can be a fun place 
or a dangerous place — and applying a little common sense can make all the 
difference. Consider this chapter your jump-start on MySpace street smarts.
Don’t Take MySpace to the Real World
MySpace was established to let bands reach their audiences and expand 
their fan bases. Since then, it’s evolved into a place that’s not just for bands 
and their screaming throngs (hey, daydreams are free) — it’s the place for 
everyone: “The place for friends,” as they say. Through MySpace, people make 
contact not only with their current friends but also with new people who share 
similar interests. We enjoy using the site for that purpose — and we’ve made 
some good friendships online that way, with people we would’ve never even 
met if it weren’t for MySpace.

276
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
But MySpace — like the whole Internet — grew out of the real world. It has all 
the human potentials, both good and bad. So we think three overall security tips 
are worth a quick review, even if they seem a little obvious at first. (Some people 
just haven’t figured them out yet. Do them a favor: Show them this page.)
 
Here are our MySpace For Dummies Big Three All-Star Don’ts:
 
 Don’t set up private meetings to meet people you just happen to encounter 
on MySpace.
 
 Don’t share any information that might allow people you meet on MySpace 
to track you down via other means. (Translation: Don’t give out personal 
access information like your phone number or home address.)
 
 Don’t ever post any sort of personal financial or identification information 
on MySpace — for instance, the Social Security, credit card, or bank account 
numbers that scam artists and identity thieves are always looking for.
Our goal with all these security tips isn’t to turn you paranoid (not too para-
noid, anyway). It’s just to make sure you don’t share anything on MySpace 
that might hurt or endanger you in the real world. The more you keep the 
real world separate from MySpace, the less chance you have of running afoul 
of safety issues.
 
Getting messages from people you don’t know is almost inevitable on 
MySpace. Remember that ignoring these messages is always an option. Most 
of the time, users who don’t hear back from you simply go away. Persistent 
message senders can be blocked or reported to MySpace — and you have 
every right to do that at the mere tinge of “creepy” or “crazy.”
Don’t Talk to Strangers
Sometimes the old advice is the best advice. When you get a mail message or 
IM from a MySpace user you don’t know, follow up — discreetly — by click-
ing the sender’s profile and poking around that page a bit. If it doesn’t look 
like anyone you know, ignore the message and delete it. If it’s really one of 
your friends hiding behind an anonymous profile, that person will eventually 
write you back to reveal his or her true identity. Otherwise, keep your con-
tact to your friends.
Don’t Use Your Real Name
You can set your profile name to be anything you want. If privacy is a concern 
of yours, avoid using your real name or a known nickname in your profile. Opt 

277
 Chapter 17: Ten Ways to Keep Away from MySpace Bad Guys
for something that reflects one of your interests, like the name of your favorite 
sports team or a character from a movie, or something a little cryptic and 
mysterious. Anything that makes it difficult to track you down in the real 
world will work.
Don’t Post Contact Information
Because contact information is so easy for the wrong people to abuse, 
MySpace’s Terms of Service actually prohibit posting contact information on 
your profile page. So spare yourself some spam and creep-out contacts; don’t 
go putting up your address, telephone number, or home e-mail address. You 
can even go a step further and remove your city location (via the Edit Profile 
link on your home page) or take down any current school information you’ve 
linked to your account.
Don’t Leave Unwanted Clues
You can take lots of precautions to keep your real name off MySpace, your 
contact information unshared, and your profile blocked from everyone 
except your friends. But you can also undermine every one of these safety 
steps by leaving unwanted clues on your profile. You might name your 
school in a blog entry or mention the name of your favorite dance club in a 
caption on your photo page. Take a look at any content you want to post to 
your MySpace page for clues like these that could sabotage your efforts to 
keep your profile private.
 
On the same note, don’t say or do anything on MySpace to reveal the identity 
of — or personal information about — any of your friends if they haven’t already 
said it there themselves. If they want the world to know, they can say it first, and 
probably should (if anybody’s going to say it). After all, you don’t want them 
revealing your secrets, so don’t reveal theirs. Mutual confidentiality is a great 
way to stay friends.
Don’t Post Anything You Don’t 
Want Your Mother to See
The information you put on your profile page could mean the difference 
between getting a lot of messages from strangers and getting none. Choosing 
a profile picture of yourself in your bikini or your muscle-baring workout 

278
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
clothes and adding a headline that reads “SEXY, SINGLE, AND LOOKING” will 
attract more users trolling for dates (or something else) than a profile with a 
subtler photo and headline.
Of course, if you’re of legal age and you are indeed looking for someone to 
start a relationship with, by all means send out such a message on MySpace. 
Just be sure not to add in any personal information that would reveal more 
about how to contact you outside MySpace. The idea is to avoid any offline 
encounters you don’t plan yourself.
 
Also keep in mind that MySpace is a public forum where co-workers, would-be 
employers, teachers, professors, and others can (and will) see what you post. 
It’s always a good idea to keep these audiences — and Murphy’s Law — in 
mind. That way, if they stumble across something you wrote, you’ve already 
done your best to make sure you’re not sending signals that could mess up 
your offline life.
Play Nice with Others
The world of anonymous posting on Internet forums and message boards has 
led to a recently discovered condition called Internet muscles. It’s a familiar 
malady: Talk is cheap; anonymous talk is big and cheap — sometimes a lot 
bigger than who’s doing the talking. To certain individuals, the anonymity 
that the online world affords is like an invitation to develop aggressive and 
threatening attitudes they wouldn’t get away with in the real world without 
the brawn to back up their behavior.
You can see bouts of Internet muscles flare up on MySpace from time to time, 
as some people treat the site as an opportunity to start arguments and leave 
nasty comments for other users. Trust us, nothing good ever came out of 
Internet fighting (unless you really enjoy bouts of high blood pressure). Go 
for the Delete key or the Block User option when someone gets under your 
skin. Firing back might lead to offline issues that aren’t worth dealing with. 
After you’ve taken care of business, log off MySpace, count to 100, and talk to 
your real friends — either in the real world or when you’re back online. Why 
not step aside for awhile and go grab a cup of coffee?
Don’t Share Your Account
If you have a personal account, keep it personal. Here are three ways to do that:
 
 Don’t let others jump on and send messages or leave comments under 
your account that you might have to explain later.

279
 Chapter 17: Ten Ways to Keep Away from MySpace Bad Guys
 
 Don’t share your password with someone else. It’s supposed to be a 
secret — your secret.
 
 If someone figures out your password and logs on to your account, use 
your Settings: Password screen to change the password to something 
new or just cancel the account and create a new one.
Always Sign Out
Whenever you finish using MySpace, your last step should always be to click 
the SignOut link at the top of the page to end your session. If you don’t and 
your computer stays on, you’re still signed on. Staying signed on could give 
the next person to sit down at the computer full access to your MySpace 
account.
 
Be especially careful not to forget this step if you use a public terminal to 
access MySpace.
Use a Separate E-mail Address
Although it’s nearly impossible for anyone to get access to the e-mail address 
associated with your MySpace account, you can give it a little extra protec-
tion — as a good final line of security — by using a separate e-mail account 
for all your MySpace activity. This option is especially useful if you have a 
school or business e-mail address you want to use, but which might reveal 
info you don’t want to share about yourself if it’s discovered as your link to 
MySpace. There are a lot of options for getting free e-mail accounts on the 
Internet these days. See Chapter 2 for details on a few free e-mail options.

Ten MySpace Resources
In This Chapter
 Spiffing up your MySpace page
 Making pictures MySpace-ready
 Fixing up your video
 Sharing your music
Your new MySpace page is like a new house. Chances are, when you move 
into a new house, the rooms are empty and the walls are white and bare. 
It’s up to you to add the color and decorations to make it your own.
Though MySpace is highly customizable, most of the tools for dressing up a 
MySpace page are actually not provided by MySpace. A whole new class of 
online tools has popped up to help MySpace users make their pages unique. 
(Gee — ya think this thing is catching on?) This chapter points you toward a 
few of the top sites for getting your MySpace page above board and winning 
you positive comments from hordes of admiring visitors.
Thomas’ Myspace Editor
This popular MySpace editorial tool generates a unique page of programming 
code you can drop into your MySpace page to give it your own look. Simple 
drop-down menus let you set the color and image of your background, the size 
and color of your text fonts, the borders of your page tables, and the color of 
your scroll bars. After you have your code, copy and drop it into the About Me 
section of your profile or into the bio on your band site to create a one-of-a-kind 
look for your MySpace page. Generate your code — and your look — at www.
strikefile.com/myspace.

282
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
MySpace Toolbox
MySpace Toolbox, found at http://myspacetoolbox.com, provides a 
profile editor that’s similar to Thomas’ Myspace Editor, except it takes the 
tools a step further — into the realm of predesigned layouts and ready-to-
load goodies such as backgrounds, images, and videos by popular musical 
artists. You can also customize your favorite music, movie, and book lists 
with images to replace the text. Do watch out for the advertising links on this 
site, though. Sometimes they lean toward the adult side, though there aren’t 
any related images lurking around to worry about.
Glitter Graphics
Leaving a sparkling, pastel message in your friends’ comments columns 
seems to be the current rage on MySpace. Glitter Graphics, located at http://
www.glitter-graphics.com, provides a generator you can use to create 
your own glittery messages that are sure to catch any visitor’s eye. The site 
also features tools for creating blog and profile surveys, as well as eye candy 
(scrolling images and graphics).
Tools For MySpace
Tools For MySpace features a page-layout editor. (Yeah, we know — every 
site we’ve mentioned up to this point has a page-layout editor and we’ve 
probably only touched 0.1 percent of the Web sites out there that feature 
a one of those. Embarrassment of riches, okay?) This site, online at www.
toolsformyspace.com, offers a few other fun tools — including code for 
adding games to your page, a customizer for your Contact Table, and a page 
translator that alters your page to another language or into slang. Our favor-
ite tool, though, is the customized box that lets visitors know when you’re in 
their extended network.
GIMP
GIMP (also known as the GIMP) is the shortened name for the GNU Image 
Manipulation Program. With a name like that, we prefer it simply to be called 
GIMP as well. In simpler terms, GIMP is image-editing software you can use to 
get your photos ready for MySpace. The software is on a par with professional 
image editors, such as Adobe Photoshop — and is completely free. The software 

283
 Chapter 18: Ten MySpace Resources
is available for the Windows, Mac, and Unix (so you know it’ll work on Linux) 
computing platforms. You can get your own copy of GIMP at www.gimp.org.
Windows Movie Maker
MySpace provides a place for you to upload your personal videos to share with 
other MySpace users. Before you upload your video, though, you might want to 
edit it down to the best parts or add titles and credits. Windows Movie Maker is 
a free application that comes with Windows XP; it includes tools for editing clips, 
adding sound and text to video, and saving your finished piece as a Web-ready 
file. Get more info on using Windows Movie Maker at http://www.microsoft.
com/windowsxp/downloads/updates/moviemaker2.mspx.
iMovie
Windows Movie Maker is a Microsoft-created product, so it shouldn’t be too 
surprising that the software only works on a Windows PC. If you have a Mac, 
look for the latest release of iMovie to accomplish the same tasks. It’s not a 
free product, but it’s part of Apple’s iLife suite of products — and that includes 
tools for photo editing and creating music, Web sites, and DVDs. Go to www.
apple.com/ilife for details.
Audacity
Between all the music files being passed around and all the podcasts being 
created and posted to the Internet, the online world has become the top 
platform for sharing sound. Audacity puts the power of a sound recorder 
and editor on your computer. This free software, downloadable at http://
audacity.sourceforge.net/, provides the software for turning your PC 
or Mac (or Linux machine if you’re really geeky and proud of it) into a record-
ing studio. If you’re in a band, you can use the software to convert your song 
files into formats ready for upload to MySpace. Wannabe podcasters can also 
record their shows with Audacity.
It’s worth noting that Audacity is only the software piece of turning your com-
puter into a recording studio. If you want to start recording on your computer, 
you’ll need a few other tools. If you’re ready to take that step, we recommend you 
take a look at PC Recording Studios For Dummies by Jeff Strong (Wiley Publishing, 
Inc.). If you want to launch a podcast, grab a copy of Podcasting For Dummies 
by Tee Morris, Evo Terra, Dawn Miceli, and Drew Domkus (also by Wiley 
Publishing, Inc.).

Quizilla
What better way to explain who you are to the MySpace universe than by shar-
ing the results of an off-the-wall quiz created by a bored Web wanderer? (Works 
for us.) Okay, that might be a cynical way of looking at Quizilla, the site where 
people can create quizzes designed to give you insight into your personality. 
After you get your quiz results, you can generate some code that you can paste 
into MySpace so you can share the new insight with your MySpace friends. (Hey, 
we just found out the obsolete technology our personality most resembles is 
Gregg shorthand!) Get in on the fun at http://quizilla.com. This site has 
become so popular that is was recently purchased by MTV Networks — look 
for changes on the horizon!
Spell Check
Okay, you don’t have to go ransacking the Internet for this one. But seriously, 
would it kill you to run all the stuff you type into MySpace through spell check 
just once before you put it online for the world to see? Maybe proofread it 
really quickly?
Sorry, it’s just a pet peeve of ours . . . we are authors, you know.

Ten Other Social-
Net working Sites

 Showing off your profile at Facebook
 Meeting up with old classmates
 Posting photos and video
 Networking your pets
A
lthough it’s one of the best known, MySpace wasn’t actually the first 
social-networking Web site. Of course, given its popularity — and the 
race among Web sites to become the “next MySpace” — you can bet MySpace 
won’t be the last of its kind, either. In fact, the species seems to be multiplying 
as more and more go online to stay connected with friends, family, co-workers, 
and anyone else who might share some common interests. Whether they came 
before or after the launch of MySpace, other social-networking sites offer their 
own spins on the idea of linking up online. How many different networks’ users 
actually want to participate in more than one social-networking site at the same 
time is yet to be seen, but there will certainly be a lot of options for those 
willing to commit to more than one. There are even social-networking sites 
for your pets!
Facebook
Facebooks are the printed books traditionally given to incoming college freshmen, 
showing photos of other students and members of the campus faculty and staff. In 
2004, a Harvard student applied the idea to a Web site, and www.facebook.com 
was born. Initially, the site was primarily known as a social network for college 
students to connect with other students on their campuses. Facebook has 100 
percent penetration in U.S. colleges, and one survey reported that 85 percent of 
the students who attend colleges covered by Facebook have a profile on the site.

286
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
The site added profiles for users in high schools, the military, and certain 
corporations as it grew. In 2006, Facebook finally opened itself to members 
who weren’t affiliated with schools or member businesses — but its origins 
are still its greatest strength. With this site’s strong ties to the tech-savvy 
college-student community, its clean, consistent usability, and its wide array 
of Web-based applications, Facebook is now seen as a peer of MySpace at the 
top of the social-networking phenomenon.
Classmates.com
With over a decade online, Classmates.com is the old man of the online social-
networking world. Classmates.com is built on the idea of extending existing 
offline social networks into the online world by creating a site to keep people in 
touch with their high school and college classmates. Like most networking sites, 
individuals can sign up and create a profile sharing basic personal information. 
Classmates.com groups user profiles by school or work affiliations.
Classmates.com differs from some networks by offering a fee-based mem-
bership level that allows users to see other members’ full profiles, initiate 
contact with other members, or form groups for event planning. Basic mem-
bership at the site is free, however — and Classmates.com claims over 40 
million active members. If you wonder how many of those might have gone to 
your old school, you can check ’em out at www.classmates.com.
Ning
If you simply can’t decide which existing social network best suits you, or 
even if your own real-life social network necessitates it, Ning (www.ning.
com) provides anyone the opportunity to build and maintain their very own 
private or public online social community. It allows for much of the same 
general functionality of the major sites (profiles, blogs, images, videos, and 
so on), but you can have full administrative control to determine who is allowed 
to join or access the site and what the community and its conversation really 
revolve around.
Ning sites are a great option for internal or informal communication for organiza-
tions (especially those where members are in different geographical locations), 
fans and enthusiasts, and even just groups of friends or family members who 
want to stay connected more easily.

287
 Chapter 19: Ten Other Social-Networking Sites
Bebo
Found at www.bebo.com, Bebo is one of the fastest-growing online social-
networking options. Along with the usual photo, blog, profile, video, and 
comment-posting options, Bebo also adds self-created polls and quizzes to 
your Bebo pages.
One of the more interesting tools Bebo calls their own is the whiteboard — a 
feature that lets other users draw a picture to be posted on your page. The 
site is especially popular in Ireland, where it ranked as the country’s second 
most popular Web site.
Xanga
The blog is the star at www.xanga.com. Xanga pages put the users’ blogs 
front and center. Fee-based premium memberships expand the storage space 
on your account and open your page to customizing via predesigned layouts — 
but even nonpaying members can update their blogs the do-it-yourself way by 
using HTML code.
Networking on the site happens as users join blogrings — yep, the blogs come 
linked as rings (no, you can’t put your car keys on them) — leave comments 
about particular blog entries, or subscribe to other users’ blogs to stay up to 
date on their entries.
Orkut
The vast growth of Google has landed the tech powerhouse in almost every 
field. So it’s no shock that Google has its own social-networking site. Orkut, 
found at www.orkut.com, launched with little fanfare in early 2004 — but 
these days, it’s grown to over 70 million users.
Orkut takes a unique approach in its growth: Membership is by invitation only. 
The Orkut sign-up page claims the approach assures that “we won’t grow too 
large too quickly, and everyone will have at least one person to vouch for them.” 
(Of course, maybe this invitation-only thing carries enough “exclusive” cachet to 
make everybody want in. Pretty clever, those marketing departments.)
Orkut is especially popular in India and Brazil. The South American nation 
accounts for over half of Orkut’s users.

288

Flickr
Photo-sharing site Flickr, which is owned by search giant Yahoo!, makes the 
cut as a social-networking site as well, thanks to its approach that provides 
public viewing for photos posted on the site. Flickr users create photo albums 
on their accounts, and that’s where they store and share personal photos with 
other users (or with the public at large). The site gets a leg up on other photo-
storage sites by allowing users to tag their photos with keywords — which 
makes the images a lot easier to search. Users can also set albums as private 
if they wish. Flip through some Flickr albums at www.flickr.com.
YouTube
This isn’t your grandparents’ — or even your parents’ — TV. Here — through 
the magic of the Internet — the viewers get to provide the content. YouTube 
(found at www.youtube.com), which was acquired by Google for $1.65 billion 
in October of 2006, jumped out the gate and quickly established itself as the 
premiere community for sharing video clips online and quickly became a part 
of the pop culture. On YouTube, millions share, view, and comment about 
video clips ranging from the absurd and obscure to mainstream clips from 
important news stories. It has become such a force in such a short time that 
in 2007, in just its second year, it co-hosted major presidential debates with 
CNN, allowing literally anyone in the world the opportunity to submit a ques-
tion that might be asked to the candidates.
Although it faces ongoing concerns and at times skirmishes about copyright 
protection issues, YouTube has become the preeminent destination for those 
searching for a specific video clip (or their 15 minutes of fame).
Webkinz and Club Penguin
There are even a variety of options for social communities strictly for the ele-
mentary school set that encourage kids to meet and play with others (virtually) 
and challenge them to both learn and explore their creativity. They also take 
special measures to keep their young members exceptionally safe at all times.
A kid can join Webkinz after purchasing a Webkinz stuffed animal and entering 
the “secret code” that accompanies it. This gives them access to care for the 
virtual version of their new “pet” and play a variety of games that allow them 
to earn points.

289
 Chapter 19: Ten Other Social-Networking Sites
Club Penguin is a social community owned and operated by Disney. It 
requires a monthly fee to participate, but this funding allows them to keep 
the site advertisement-free.
Dogster and Catster
People who adore their pets want them in every aspect of their lives. Our 
canine and feline companions can now join the online social-networking 
revolution via their owners — who have those handy opposable thumbs for 
using the computer — at Dogster (www.dogster.com) and Catster (www.
catster.com).
Owners establish profiles for their pets that include photos, bios, nicknames, 
pet peeves (sorry about that), favorite toys, and favorite tricks for dogs (never 
a species known for tricks, cats just share their favorite napping spots). Of course, 
the dogs and cats can sign on friends to their pages and share messages with 
their fellow four-legged companions. And — naturally — both sites have space 
where pets can blog the details of their day.
