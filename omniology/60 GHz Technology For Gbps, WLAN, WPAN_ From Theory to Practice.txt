Preface
Since the ﬁrst wireless transatlantic radio wave transmission (based on long wave)
by Marconi from Cornwall, England, to Newfoundland, Canada, in 1901, wireless
communications have undergone tremendous growth. Today, wireless communica-
tions systems have become an integral part of our daily life and continue to evolve
in providing better quality and user experience.
One of the most important emerging wireless technologies in recent years is
millimeter-wave (mm-wave) technology. Although it has been known for many
decades, it is only over the past ﬁve or six years that advances in silicon process
technologies and low-cost integration solutions have made mm-wave a relevant
technology from a commercial perspective. As a result, this technology has attracted
signiﬁcant interest from academia, industry and standardization bodies. In this book,
we speciﬁcally focus on 60 GHz wireless systems that enable several new applica-
tions that are not feasible at lower carrier frequencies.
60 GHz technology offers various advantages over current or existing commu-
nications systems. One of the most important is the availability of at least 5 GHz
of continuous bandwidth worldwide. While this is comparable to the unlicensed
bandwidth allocated for ultra-wideband (UWB) purposes, the 60 GHz bandwidth is
continuous and less restricted in terms of power limits. In fact, the large bandwidth at
60 GHz band is one of the largest unlicensed bandwidths being allocated in history.
This huge bandwidth represents great potential in terms of capacity and ﬂexibility,
making 60 GHz technology particularly attractive for gigabit wireless applications.
The compact size of the 60 GHz radio also permits multiple-antenna solutions at
the user terminal that are otherwise difﬁcult if not impossible at lower frequencies.
Compared to 5 GHz system, the form factor of mm-wave systems is approxi-
mately 140 times smaller and thus can be conveniently integrated into consumer
electronic products.
Despite the various advantages offered, mm-wave based communications face
a number of important challenges that must be solved. This book outlines the
challenges, opportunities and current solutions at every layer of a 60 GHz system
implementation. The outline of the book is as follows.
Chapter 1 presents an introduction to 60 GHz technology. It starts with direct com-
parisons between 60 GHz technology and other high data rate counterparts such as

xiv
Preface
UWB and IEEE 802.11n technologies in terms of their transmit power, bandwidth
and spectrum efﬁciency in delivering high data rate solutions. Several key applica-
tions that have proved challenging in the past become feasible with the Gbps data
rate of 60 GHz. The worldwide regulatory and frequency allocation of the 60 GHz
band is then introduced. Finally, intensive standardization efforts are discussed and
a comparison of their physical layer features is provided.
Chapter 2 presents an overview of 60 GHz channel modeling, which forms the
basis for reliable 60 GHz wireless communications system design. This chapter
begins by highlighting the different modeling approaches available and setting
out their advantages and disadvantages in generating a realistic 60 GHz channel
model. Next, generic modeling frameworks for both large- and small-scale channel
characterizations are thoroughly discussed. An extensive list of references with
summary and comprehensive discussions on the reported results is provided.
This chapter also discusses 60 GHz polarization modeling methodology for
multi-polarized multiple-antenna systems. Finally, channel parameterizations for
the proposed generic channel models are provided. In particular, the channel
models used in IEEE 802.15.3c and IEEE 802.11.ad are discussed and their
limitations also highlighted.
Chapter 3 describes radio frequency (RF) nonlinearities and their behavioral
models which should be considered in the design of 60 GHz wireless communication
systems. It starts with an overview of conventional RF analog front-end architectures
and their applicability to 60 GHz systems. RF nonlinearities possibly given by these
architectures are also presented, with emphasis on power ampliﬁer nonlinearities. A
brief review of power ampliﬁer models is given, and their effect on system perfor-
mance presented. Then, phase noises arising from a local oscillator are investigated,
with primary emphasis on their modeling procedures. This chapter ends with a brief
introduction to other RF nonlinearities that may also affect system performance.
Chapter 4 discusses antenna array beamforming as a technology enabling Gbps
throughput over general 60 GHz non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channels. The 60 GHz
channel is brieﬂy analyzed, and transmit/receive beamforming is shown to be a
necessary technique for the 60 GHz channel. For transmit/receive beamforming, an
antenna training/tracking algorithm is crucial such that the NLOS blocking issue
can be solved. Two different antenna training/tracking methods are presented. One
is the iterative antenna training and tracking method for adaptive antenna arrays,
and the other is the divide-and-conquer training and tracking method for switched
antenna arrays.
Chapter 5 discusses baseband modulation in achieving Gbps throughput at
60 GHz. We focus particularly on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) and single carrier (SC) block transmission (SCBT) as two major can-
didates in enabling high spectral efﬁciency transmissions. In the ﬁrst part, a brief
introduction to OFDM communications is given, followed by general OFDM design

considerations. The challenges of designing OFDM systems for 60 GHz systems
are also emphasized. The ﬁrst part then uses IEEE 802.15.3c audio video (AV)
OFDM as a case study and discusses various issues in baseband designs, including
uncompressed video communications, physical layer equal and unequal error
protection schemes, bit interleaving and multiplexing schemes, and AV OFDM mod-
ulation. The second part is devoted to SCBT with frequency-domain equalization
(SC-FDE), which provides very low to very high bit rates with excellent robustness.
The second part starts with a rationale for using a SC at 60 GHz and then describes
how this is speciﬁed in the IEEE802.15.3c standard. The chapter continues with
system aspects such as transceiver design, effect of non-idealities and equalizer
design. Then, a large section is devoted to describe the signal processing functions
of the SC receiver, covering acquisition, joint estimation of channel, ﬁne carrier
frequency offset and I/Q imbalance parameters, equalization, tracking and decoding.
Chapter 6 presents the current solutions, techniques and tradeoffs involved in the
implementation of a high data rate 60 GHz radio in silicon from the RF front-end
to the mixed-signal (analog–digital) interface with a digital baseband integrated
circuit. The discussion starts with an overview of the different silicon technologies
available for the implementation of 60 GHz systems, analyzing their limitations and
capabilities. Given that the link margin of a wireless system is strongly dependent
on the receiver’s noise ﬁgure and the transmitter’s P1 dB, the performance of
currently existing 60 GHz low-noise ampliﬁer and power ampliﬁer solutions is
reviewed in detail. Radio architectures for single- and multiple-antenna (phased
array) systems are presented. Radio architectures are reviewed with emphasis
on their feasibility and limitations for an integrated implementation. The current
state of the art in high-speed digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters
and modulators as important system components is analyzed in the context of
their application to Gbps systems. The tradeoffs involved in a radio design for
SC and OFDM modulations are discussed and implementation guidelines are
provided. Finally, an outlook of the remaining challenges for the implementation
of commercial 60 GHz radios is presented.
Chapter 7 covers SC hardware implementation. It starts with early-phase SC
implementation examples with digital baseband, one with non-coherent detection
and the other with differentially coherent detection. Then, we discuss how to imple-
ment more advanced SC systems that can comply with a certain standard, such as
IEEE 802.15.3c. Readers will quickly realize that an appropriate 60 GHz system
demonstration requires more than just implementation work for a given standard,
and algorithm-level research, in particular the receiver side, is playing a critical role
in achieving robust end-to-end 60 GHz systems.
Chapter 8 presents design consideration and implementation issues for 60 GHz
OFDM hardware demonstrators. After introducing the designed OFDM physical
layer and frame architecture, we present baseband processor architectures and their

xvi
Preface
implementation details for both OFDM transmitters and receivers. 60 GHz wireless
link demonstrations with the developed OFDM demonstrator are also highlighted.
Finally, the next-generation OFDM demonstrator we have designed for wireless
LAN applications and its performance evaluation are brieﬂy introduced.
Chapter 9 discusses MAC layer design for 60 GHz communications systems. The
MAC layer plays a critical role in moderating access right to the shared wireless
channel. In 60 GHz wireless networks, issues related to carrier sensing, deafness and
device discovery which form the major medium access control challenges in the
presence of directional transmission are ﬁrst discussed. Then a number of techniques
to improve the MAC layer performance such as a large packet size of the order of
hundreds of kilobytes, data aggregation, block-ACK and automatic repeat request
(ARQ), are presented. Then the chapter delves into 60 GHz MAC design considera-
tions to support short-range uncompressed video streaming. Finally, a performance
study is presented.
Chapter 10 presents further challenges and future direction for 60 GHz commu-
nication systems.

1.1
What is 60 GHz?
Since the ﬁrst wireless transatlantic radio wave transmission demonstration by Mar-
coni from Cornwall, England, to Newfoundland, Canada, in 1901 (based on long
wave), wireless communications have undergone tremendous growth. They were
ﬁrst used mainly by military and shipping companies and later quickly expanded
into commercial use such as commercial broadcasting services (such as shortwave,
AM and FM radio, terrestrial TV), cellular telephony, and global positioning service
(GPS), wireless local area network (WLAN), and wireless personal area network
(WPAN) technologies. Today, these wireless communications systems have become
an integral part of daily life and continue to evolve in providing better quality and
user experience. One of the recent emerging wireless technologies is millimeter-
wave (mm-wave) technology. It is important to note that mm-wave technology has
been known for many decades, but has mainly been deployed for military appli-
cations. Over the past 5–6 years, advances in process technologies and low cost
integration solutions have made mm-wave a technology to watch and begun to
attract a great deal of interest from academia, industry and standardization bodies.
In very broad terms, mm-wave technology is concerned with that part of the elec-
tromagnetic spectrum between 30 and 300 GHz, corresponding to wavelengths from
10 mm to 1 mm [1], as shown in Figure 1.1. In this book, however, we will focus

Section 1.3.

Comparison with other Unlicensed Systems
60 GHz technology offers various advantages over current or existing communica-
tions systems [2]. One major reason for the recent interest in 60 GHz technology is
the huge unlicensed bandwidth. As shown in Figure 1.2, at least 5 GHz of continu-
ous bandwidth is available in many countries worldwide. While this is comparable
to the unlicensed bandwidth allocated for ultra-wideband (UWB) purposes [3], the
60 GHz bandwidth is continuous and less restricted in terms of power limits. This is
due to the fact that UWB system is an overlay system and thus subject to very strict

book.

and different regulations [4]. The large bandwidth at 60 GHz is one of the largest
unlicensed bandwidths ever to be allocated. This huge bandwidth represents great
potential in terms of capacity and ﬂexibility, making 60 GHz technology particularly
attractive for gigabit wireless applications (see Section 1.3).
Furthermore, 60 GHz regulation allows much higher transmit power – equivalent
isotropic radiated power (EIRP) – compared to other existing WLAN and WPAN
systems. Table 1.1 shows examples of typical 60 GHz, UWB and IEEE 802.11
systems that operate near the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reg-
ulatory limit.
The output power of a power ampliﬁer for 60 GHz is typically limited to 10 dBm
because the implementation of efﬁcient power ampliﬁers at this frequency is very

4
60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
challenging (see Chapter 3 for more discussion) though FCC regulations allow up
to 27 dBm. However, the huge antenna gain up to 40 dBi has signiﬁcantly boosted
the allowable EIRP limits. On the other hand, UWB systems which are required to
meet the strict power spectrum mask of −41.3 dBm/MHz based on FCC regulations,
thus offer only very limited EIRP of the order of −10 dBm. This makes the UWB
system a very short-range and low-power device. In contrast, the design of power
ampliﬁers for 2.4/5.0 GHz is simpler and can deliver much higher power than the
60 GHz system. However, the EIRP limit is typically conﬁned to 30 dBm due to
the crowded Industrial, Scientiﬁc and Medical band. It can be seen from Table 1.1
that the EIRP of the 60 GHz system is approximately 10 times larger than the IEEE
802.11n and 30 000 times larger than the UWB system.
The higher transmit power is necessary to overcome the higher path loss at
60 GHz. While the high path loss seems to be a disadvantage at 60 GHz, it con-
ﬁnes the 60 GHz operation to within a room in an indoor environment. Hence, the
effective interference levels for 60 GHz are less severe than those systems located
in the congested 2.0–2.5 GHz and 5.0–5.8 GHz regions.
The huge bandwidth available for 60 GHz and UWB systems also simpliﬁes the
system design of these technologies. A system with much lower spectral efﬁciency
can be designed to deliver a Gbps transmission to provide low cost and simple
implementation. Table 1.2 shows the spectral efﬁciency required by the 60 GHz,
UWB and IEEE 802.11 systems to achieve 1 Gbps transmission as well as spec-
tral efﬁciency of the actual deployment of such systems. A typical 60 GHz system
requires only 0.4 bps/Hz to achieve 1 Gbps, making it an ideal candidate to sup-
port very high data rate applications using simple modulation. Though the UWB
system only requires 2 bps/Hz to achieve 1 Gbps, its actual deployment is lim-
ited to 400 Mbps at 1 m operating range. IEEE 802.11n-alike systems will require
25 bps/Hz in order to achieve 1 Gbps, making the extension of such system to
beyond 1 Gbps unappealing in terms of cost and implementation. A more detailed
discussion on the modulation choice for 60 GHz is presented in Chapter 4.

Introduction to 60 GHz

In addition, the huge path loss at 60 GHz enables higher-frequency reuse in each
indoor environment, thus allowing a very high-throughput network. The compact
size of 60 GHz radio also permits multiple-antenna solutions at the user terminal that
are otherwise difﬁcult if not impossible at lower frequencies. Compared to 5 GHz
systems, the form factor of 60 GHz systems is approximately 140 times smaller and
thus can be conveniently integrated into consumer electronic products.
Despite of the various advantages offered, 60 GHz based communications suffer
a number of critical problems that must be solved. Figure 1.3 shows the data rates
and range requirements for a number of WLAN and WPAN systems.
Since there is a need to distinguish between different standards for broader mar-
ket exploitation, the 60 GHz related standards are positioned to provide gigabit
rates and longer operating range than the UWB systems but shorter than that of
IEEE 802.11n systems. Typically, 60 GHz systems are designed to provide multi-
gigabit data rates with operating range below 20 m to support various applications
as described in Section 1.3. At such rate and range, it will be a non-trivial task for
60 GHz systems to provide sufﬁcient power margin to ensure a reliable commu-
nication link. Furthermore, the delay spread of the channel under study is another
limiting factor for high-speed transmissions. Large delay spread values can easily
increase the complexity of the system beyond the practical limit for equalization
(see Chapter 2 for more discussion on the impact of channel on the 60 GHz design
as well as choice of modulation in Chapter 5).

Potential Applications
With the allocated bandwidth of 7 GHz in most countries, 60 GHz radio has
become the technology enabler for many gigabit transmission applications that are
technically constrained at lower frequency. A number of indoor applications are
envisioned, such as:
(i) cable replacement or uncompressed high deﬁnition (HD) video streaming that
enables users to wirelessly display content to a remote screen with wired
equivalent quality/experience;
(ii) ‘synch and go’ ﬁle transfer that enables gigabytes of ﬁle transfer in a few
seconds;
(iii) wireless docking stations that allow multiple peripherals (including an exter-
nal monitor) to be connected without the need for frequent plugging and
unplugging;
(iv) wireless gigabit Ethernet that permits bidirectional multi-gigabit Ethernet
trafﬁc;
(v) wireless gaming that ensures high-quality performance and low latency for
exceptional user experience.
All these applications have been discussed in various standards and industry
alliances [5–9]. Uncompressed video streaming is emerging as one of the most
attractive applications and related products based on the WirelessHD speciﬁcation
are currently available on the market from companies such as Panasonic, LG Elec-
tronics and Toshiba [5, 10]. In the following, we will brieﬂy describe the technical
requirements for proper uncompressed video streaming operation.
Depending on the progressive scan resolution and number of pixels per line, the
data rate required varies from several hundred Mbps to a few Gbps. The latest com-
mercially available high-deﬁnition television (HDTV) resolution is 1920 × 1080,
with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. Considering RGB video formats with 8 bits per chan-
nel per pixel, the required data rate turns out to be approximately 3 Gbps, which is
currently supported by the HDMI 1.1 speciﬁcation. In the future, higher numbers
of bits per channel (10 and 12 bits per color) as well as higher refresh rates (90 Hz,
120 Hz) are expected to improve the quality of next-generation HDTV. This easily
scales the data rate to well beyond 5 Gbps. Table 1.3 summarizes data rate require-
ments for some current and future HDTV speciﬁcations. Furthermore, uncompressed
HD streaming is an asymmetric transmission with signiﬁcantly different data ﬂow
in both uplink and downlink directions. This application also requires very low
latency of tens of microseconds and very low bit error probability (down to 10−12)
to ensure high-quality video.

Worldwide Regulation and Frequency Allocation
This section discusses the current status of worldwide regulation and standardization
efforts for the 60 GHz band. The regulatory bodies in the United States, Japan,
Canada and Australia have already set frequency bands and regulations for 60 GHz
operation, while in Korea and Europe intense efforts are currently under way. A
summary of the issued and proposed frequency allocations and main speciﬁcations
for radio regulation in a number of countries is given in Table 1.4. It is important
to note that even though a maximum transmit power of 27 dBm is allowed in the
USA, the actual transmit power may be limited by the capability of power ampliﬁers
(PAs), especially in the case of single antennas. Typically, the maximum output of
the 60 GHz PA is limited to around 10 dBm.
1.4.1
North America
In 2001, the FCC allocated 7 GHz in the 54–66 GHz band for unlicensed use [11].
In terms of the power limits, FCC rules allow emission with average power density
of 9 µW/cm2 at 3 meters and maximum power density of 18 µW/cm2 at 3 meters,
from the radiating source. These values translate to average EIRP and maximum
EIRP of 40 dBm and 43 dBm, respectively. The FCC also speciﬁed the total maxi-
mum transmit power of 500 mW for an emission bandwidth greater than 100 MHz.

⋄Recommendation by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute; minimum bandwidth

Devices must also comply with the radio frequency (RF) radiation exposure require-
ments speciﬁed in §1.307(b), §2.1091 and §2.1093 of [11]. After taking RF safety
issues into account, the maximum transmit power is limited to 10 dBm. Further-
more, each transmitter must transmit transmitter identiﬁcation at least once, within
1 second interval of the signal transmission. It is important to note that 60 GHz
regulations in Canada, enforced by Industry Canada Spectrum Management and
Telecommunications (IC-SMT) [12], are harmonized with those of the USA.
1.4.2
Japan
In 2000, the Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecom-
munications (MPHPT) of Japan issued 60 GHz radio regulations for unlicensed
utilization in the 59–66 GHz band [13]. The 54.25–59 GHz band is allocated for
licensed use. The maximum transmit power for unlicensed use is limited to 10 dBm
[14] with maximum allowable antenna gain of 47 dBi [15]. Unlike in North America,

Introduction to 60 GHz
9
Japanese regulations specify that the maximum transmission bandwidth must not
exceed 2.5 GHz. There is no speciﬁcation for RF radiation exposure and transmitter
identiﬁcation requirements. For further information and latest regulation updates in
Japan, interested readers are referred to [16].
1.4.3
Australia
Following the released of regulations in Japan and North America, the Australian
Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) took similar steps to regulate the
60 GHz band in 2005 [17]. However, only 3.5 GHz bandwidth (59.4–62.9 GHz) is
allocated for unlicensed use. The maximum transmit power and maximum EIRP are
limited to 10 dBm and 51.7 dBm, respectively. The data communication transmitters
that operate in this frequency band are limited to land and maritime deployments.
For further information and latest regulation updates in Australia, interested readers
are referred to [18].
1.4.4
Korea
In June 2005, the Millimeter-wave Frequency Study Group (MFSG) was formed
under the auspices of the Korean Radio Promotion Association [19]. The MFSG
has recommended a 7 GHz unlicensed spectrum (57–64 GHz) without limitations on
the types of application to be used. For indoor applications, the maximum transmit
power is 10 dBm, the same as in Japan and Australia, while the maximum allowable
antenna gain is 17 dBi. For outdoor applications, the transmitted power is limited
to −20 dBm and 10 dBm for frequency bands 57–58 GHz and 58–64 GHz, respec-
tively, while the maximum antenna gain is 47 dBi [20]. In addition, any device using
frequencies in the 57–64 GHz band shall transmit the transmitter identiﬁcation code
per se, to enable other devices to fully detect and protect against malfunctions from
occurring, with the exception of any ﬁxed point-to-point system. For further infor-
mation and latest regulation updates in Korea, interested readers are referred to [21].
1.4.5
Europe
The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and European
Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) have been
working closely to establish a legal framework for the deployment of unlicensed
60 GHz devices. In general, the 59–66 GHz band has been allocated for mobile
services without speciﬁc decisions having been made as to the regulations. The
CEPT Recommendation T/R 22-03 provisionally allocated (and later withdrew)
the 54.25–66 GHz band for terrestrial and ﬁxed mobile systems [22].

10
60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
In 2004, the European Radiocommunications Committee (ERC) considered the
used of the 57–59 GHz band for ﬁxed services without requiring frequency plan-
ning [23]. Later, the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) within CEPT
recommended the use of point-to-point ﬁxed services in the 64–66 GHz band [24].
Later, ETSI proposed 60 GHz regulations to be considered by the ECC for WPAN
applications [25]. Under this proposal, 9 GHz of unlicensed spectrum is allocated for
60 GHz operation. This band represents the union of the bands currently approved
and proposed among the major countries as shown in Figure 1.2. In addition, a
minimum spectrum of 500 MHz is required for the transmitted signal with maxi-
mum EIRP of 57 dBm. No speciﬁcation is given for the maximum transmit power
and maximum antenna gain.
In October 2009, the CEPT recommended a maximum EIRP of 25 dBm with a
maximum spectral power density of −2 dBm/MHz for outdoor applications, though
a ﬁxed outdoor installation is not allowed [26]. For indoor applications a maxi-
mum EIRP of 40 dBm with a maximum spectral power density of 13 dBm/MHz
is speciﬁed [26]. It is unclear when the ﬁnal regulation will be in place, but the
current trend seems encouraging for the deployment of 60 GHz technology. For
further information and latest regulation updates in the Europe, interested readers
are referred to [27].
1.5
Industry Standardization Effort
The ﬁrst international industry standard that covers the 60 GHz band is the IEEE
802.16 standard for local and metropolitan area networks [28]. However, this is a
licensed band and is used for line-of-sight (LOS) outdoor communications for last
mile connectivity. In Japan, two standards related to the 60 GHz band were issued by
Association of Radio Industries and Business (ARIB): the ARIB-STD T69 [29] and
ARIB-STD T74 [30]. The former is the standard for mm-wave video transmission
equipment for speciﬁed low-power radio stations (point-to-point systems), while the
latter is the standard for mm-wave ultra high-speed WLANs for speciﬁed low power
radio stations (point-to-multipoint systems). Both standards cover the 59–66 GHz
band deﬁned in Japan.
Interest in 60 GHz radio continued to grow with the formation of multiple interna-
tional mm-wave standards groups and industry alliances. In March 2005, the IEEE
802.15.3c Task Group (TG3c) was formed to develop a mm-wave based alternative
physical layer (PHY) for the existing IEEE 802.15.3 WPAN standard 802.15.3-2003
[31]. In August 2006, ECMA TC-48 (formerly known as TC32-TG20) began an
effort to standardize medium access control (MAC) and PHY for high-speed,
short-range communications using the 60 GHz unlicensed frequency band for bulk
data applications and for multimedia streaming applications [7]. In October 2006,
the formation of the WirelessHD consortium was announced with a number of

Introduction to 60 GHz
11
key consumer electronics companies to deliver a speciﬁcation for high-speed,
high-quality uncompressed audio/video (A/V) streaming using 60 GHz technology
[5]. In the latest development, the Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig) was formed
in May 2009 to establish a uniﬁed speciﬁcation for 60 GHz wireless technology
in order to create a truly global ecosystem of interoperable products for a
diverse range of applications [9]. In this section we brieﬂy describe a number of
standardization efforts.
1.5.1
IEEE 802.15.3c
The alternative PHY of IEEE 802.15.3c is aimed at supporting a minimum data
rate of 2 Gbps over a few meters with optional data rates in excess of 3 Gbps. This
is the ﬁrst standard that addresses multi-gigabit short-range wireless systems. The
IEEE 802.15.3c standard was ratiﬁed in September 2009 [31]. Three PHYs are
deﬁned in the speciﬁcation, namely single carrier (SC) PHY, high speed interface
(HSI) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) PHY and audio video
(AV) OFDM PHY. The need for three PHYs is due to the inherent advantages
of each PHY in supporting speciﬁc applications. SC PHY is designed to support
low-cost and low-power mobile devices; HSI PHY is used for low-latency, high-
speed bidirectional data transmission, while AV PHY is optimized for AV speciﬁc
applications. The key PHY features of IEEE 802.15.3c are summarized in Table 1.5.
In order to promote coexistence among these PHY modes, common mode sig-
naling (CMS) is deﬁned which is an SC-based π/2 binary phase shift key (BPSK)

with low data rate (25 Mbps). CMS is used in piconet coordinator capable devices
to send/receive a CMS synch frame in order to avoid interference between two or
more operating piconets. Beamforming is supported by all the three PHY modes
for heterogeneous antenna types. The beamfoming employs a two-level mechanism
to ﬁnd the optimum transmit and received beams that enable high data rate trans-
mission. In addition, 15.3c speciﬁes an unequal error protection (UEP) support for
uncompressed video transmission. UEP can be achieved in both PHY and MAC
layers. UEP at PHY protects the most signiﬁcant bit (MSB) and least signiﬁcant bit
(LSB) in a subframe unequally by applying different coding and/or constellation
mapping. On the other hand, UEP at MAC protects an aggregated frame which
consists of MSB subframes, LSB subframes, or both MSB and LSB subframes, by
using either different forward error corrections or different modulation and coding
schemes. We will revisit the UEP PHY and MAC in more detail in Chapters 5 and
9, respectively.
1.5.2
ECMA 387
ECMA TC48 developed the ECMA 387 speciﬁcation for high-rate 60 GHz PHY,
MAC and HDMI PAL for short-range unlicensed communications. The ﬁrst edition
of the ECMA 387 was ratiﬁed in December 2008 and subsequently submitted to
ISO/IEC JTC 1’s fast-track procedure to turn ECMA-387 into ISO/IEC 13156
by the end of 2009 [32]. Three types of devices (i.e. Type A, Type B and Type
C) are speciﬁed in ECMA 387 based on the complexity and power consumption.
Type A represents the most complex and power-hungry device types, intended to
deliver video/data even without LOS by employing beamforming. Type B represents
devices of moderate complexity and power consumption and is designed to deliver
video/data in LOS without using beamforming. Finally, Type C devices are the
least complex and have lowest power consumption, and are used for data delivery
over very short range (less than 1 meter). In addition, three mandatory PHYs are
also deﬁned in the speciﬁcation, namely SC block transmission (SCBT), SC with
differential binary phase shift keying (DBPSK) and SC with binary amplitude shift
keying (BASK, also known as OOK). These mandatory PHYs are mapped into
Type A, B and C devices as shown in Table 1.6.
In order to promote coexistence among these device types, during device discov-
ery, which takes place in the discovery channel, Type A devices need to support
SCBT, DBPSK and OOK modes while Type B devices need to support both DBPSK
and OOK. While ECMA 378 speciﬁes interoperability and coexistence among these
three device types, the overall protocol and implementation complexity have dra-
matically increased, especially for Type A devices, as compared to IEEE 802.15.3c.
Beamforming is mandatory for Type A devices while Type B devices may support
beamforming training of Type A devices by feeding back the best adaptive weight

PHY and MAC layers.
1.5.3
WirelessHD
The WirelessHD consortium developed the WirelessHD 1.0 speciﬁcation released
in January 2008 [5]. An overview of the WirelessHD speciﬁcation 1.0 can be found
in [33]. Unlike 15.3c and ECMA-378, WirelessHD only uses OFDM modulation
with a smaller number of modes. A close comparison between the WirelessHD 1.0
speciﬁcation [33] and AV OFDM PHY in 15.3c [31] reveals a lot of similarities.
Both consist of OFDM based high-rate PHY (HRP) and low-rate PHY (LRP) that
share the same frequency band plan, baseband and general parameters. Two types of
beamforming are speciﬁed, namely, explicit beamforming and implicit beamform-
ing. Explicit beamforming is mandatory and involves a beam search phase, which is
used to estimate the AWV at both the transmitter and receiver, and a beam tracking
phase, which is used to track the changes of the existing AWVs over time as a result

14
60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
of slow variation of the channel. On the other hand, implicit beamforming employs
a beambook approach whereby a set of common beam vectors are maintained at
both the transmitter and receiver. WirelessHD 1.0 also supports UEP for uncom-
pressed video streaming applications. WirelessHD has gained some support from
the consumer electronics industry. Companies such as LG Electronics, Panasonic,
Toshiba and Gefen have already brought WirelessHD products to the market [10,
34], which represents a major milestone in commercializing 60 GHz technology.
Recently, WirelessHD announced a next-generation WirelessHD speciﬁcation that
can support data rates up to 28 Gbps for 3D TV and 4K resolution support [35]. In
addition, the next generation will also support data for low-power portable devices
at a data rate of 1 Gbps.
1.5.4
IEEE 802.11.ad
IEEE 802.11ad was formed in January 2009 as an amendment to the existing IEEE
802.11-2007. This amendment deﬁnes standardized modiﬁcations to both the 802.11
PHY and the 802.11 MAC to enable very high-throughput operation in the 60 GHz
frequency band [36]. This amendment speciﬁes a maximum MAC service access
point throughput of at least 1 Gbps while maintaining the network architecture of
the 802.11 system as well as backward compatibility with the 802.11 management
plane. In addition, IEEE 802.11ad is intended to deﬁne a mechanism for fast session
transfer between 2.4/5 GHz and 60 GHz operation bands, while coexisting with
other systems in the 60 GHz band such as IEEE 802.15.3c and ECMA-378. IEEE
802.11ad is expected to be completed by 2012.
1.5.5
Wireless Gigabit Alliance
The Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig) was formed in May 2009 with broad sup-
port from the personal computer, consumer electronics, semiconductor and mobile
handheld industries. The key objective of WGA is to establish a uniﬁed speciﬁ-
cation for 60 GHz wireless technologies that can support diverse applications as
speciﬁed in Section 1.3. The WGA speciﬁcation was released in May 2010.
1.6
Summary
The combination of high EIRP limit, huge bandwidth, and harmonized regulation
and frequency allocation globally has positioned 60 GHz in the forefront of Gbps
wireless communications. This can be demonstrated by the immense standardization
effort and industry alliance formation to promote 60 GHz technology. Despite the
tremendous progress made in 60 GHz technology in the past decade, the challenges
of full-scale commercialization still remain, particularly in providing low-cost,

low-power and robust 60 GHz products. It is the aim of this book to highlight
and address some of the key issues related to 60 GHz technology from propagation,
to PHY and MAC design as well as integrated circuit implementation of 60 GHz.

Introduction to Wireless Channel Modeling
A reliable wireless system design and system performance evaluation requires a
realistic channel model, which closely resembles real propagation environments.
Accurate propagation channel modeling is the ﬁrst major step to be carried out
before any system design, as evident as part of the many new technologies and
wireless standards development such as IEEE 802.11n [1], IEEE 802.15.3c [2],
IEEE 802.11ad [3] and ITU-R IMT Advanced [4].
A good radio channel model can provide detailed insight into the complex
radio wave propagation mechanisms as well as allowing study of the achievable
performance from both theoretical and simulation standpoints. When implemented
as channel simulators, the performance of different transmission technologies
and signal processing algorithms can be compared without the need to perform
expensive ﬁeld trials or tests for every scenario under investigation. Unfortunately,
the mechanisms that govern radio propagation in a wireless communication
channel are very complex and diverse, which makes channel modeling interesting
as a research subject. While it is important to keep the channel models as accurate

as possible in order to sufﬁciently capture the key channel effects, the models
developed must also be simple enough to be implemented. This is particularly
important in system simulation that involves multiple-antenna systems such as
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) in order to reduce the overall simulation
time. Hence, a good channel modeling approach involves a tradeoff between
accuracy and simplicity of the system under investigation.
Typically, the type of channel model that is desired depends critically on carrier
frequency, bandwidth, the type of environment and system under consideration. In
the context of 60 GHz, for example, indoor environments with wideband systems
are usually considered. In addition, due to the directional nature of 60 GHz com-
munications systems, the channel models developed also include the effect of the
antenna under study, referred to as the radio channel model. Removing the effect of
the antenna from the channel model results in a propagation channel [5], whereby
the model is valid for any antenna types used in the channel model. However,
this requires a double directional channel modeling approach, which is difﬁcult to
implement, especially in the 60 GHz band. To the best of our knowledge, all the
60 GHz channel models to date are radio channels and can be modeled using various
approaches as described in Section 2.2
2.2
Modeling Approach and Classiﬁcation of Channel Model
The requirements for modeling various types of wireless propagation channels have
resulted in a large number of different modeling approaches reported in the literature
[6–8]. The complex phenomenon whereby a transmitted signal propagates through
the wireless channel and arrives at the receiver, typically via many different paths,
is known as multipath. During this process, the signal undergoes various propaga-
tion mechanisms such as reﬂection off the wall, scattering around furniture and/or
diffraction around the corners of buildings. Therefore, many different types of sim-
pliﬁcations and approximations can be used to model the wireless communications
channels, depending on their usage.
In general, propagation channel models can be broadly divided into two main
categories, namely deterministic and stochastic (see Figure 2.1). These categories
differ in terms of their usage and the underlying data type used in deriving them.
2.2.1
Deterministic Modeling
Deterministic model approaches can be further divided into three subgroups: the
closed-form approach, empirical (based on measurement) approach and ray trac-
ing approach. A good example of the closed-form approach is the two-path signal
model [9], a very simple model that allows theoretical and analytical analysis for

different transmission schemes. However, this approach is too conservative to rep-
resent the realistic scenario of the environment under study. On the other hand, the
empirical approach extracts channel parameters from the data collected in chan-
nel measurements conducted in a speciﬁc environment under study. Hence, the
empirical approach is very accurate, despite its mathematical simplicity. But such
accuracy comes at the expense of high complexity due to the large amount of
measurement data needed. Furthermore, the validity of the empirical model is very
site-speciﬁc and difﬁcult to relate to the physical processes of the propagation. A
number of empirical models for 60 GHz has been developed and reported in the
literature [10–14]. In the ray tracing approach, advanced electromagnetic theory
and simulation tools (such as the uniform theory of diffraction and ﬁnite difference
time domain) are used in developing the desired channel model. A good example
of this approach is the use of the ray launching method. This method ﬁrst deﬁnes a
site-speciﬁc environment based on a detailed map. The location, size and orienta-
tion of the access point (AP), station (STA) and various objects (such as furniture
and humans) are placed in the environment according to the actual setup. A more
complete solution characterizing the properties of the object (such as permittivity
and attenuation) can also be applied to the simulation tool in order to obtain more
accurate propagation characteristics for the speciﬁed geometry setup. Then, a known
signal is transmitted and the received signal computed in order to characterize the
propagation mechanism. Ray tracing is highly environment-speciﬁc and its accuracy
is heavily dependent on the availability of the materials and topographical database
to be utilized in the modeling [15]. As such, ray tracing is usually considered as
the most complex and computationally expensive of the deterministic modeling
approaches. Some ray tracing models for 60 GHz systems have been reported in the
literature; see [16–19] and the references therein.

2.2.2
Stochastic Modeling
Stochastic modeling is the most popular approach in the channel modeling
community since it offers good a tradeoff between complexity and accuracy.
Compared to deterministic modeling, stochastic modeling has lower complexity
and yet can provide sufﬁciently accurate channel information. Stochastic models
are derived based on the measurement data collected in a large array of locations
within the environment under study in order to provide a good statistical
representation of the channel; general guidelines on measurement techniques
and procedures can be found in [20]. This subsequently enables derivation of
the probability density function (pdf) of the channel and thus the key channel
parameters. The pdf and its associated channel parameters will be used to generate
the channel impulse response (CIR) needed for simulation purposes. One of the
key features of stochastic modeling is that it can be tuned to replicate various other
different scenarios such as non-line-of-sight (NLOS) or other environments that
share the same pdf by setting the channel parameters to the appropriate values.
The stochastic approach can also be divided into two subgroups: the geometry
based stochastic model (GBSM) and the correlation based model. In the literature,
the GBSM is sometimes referred to as the ray-based model. In GBSM, scatterers
are distributed in a speciﬁc manner on a certain predeﬁned geometrical shape such
as an ellipse [21] or circle [22] between the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX)
in order to imitate the effect of wave propagation. Typically, a single bounce is
assumed for simplicity [23], and a double bounce can sometimes be used for more
advanced modeling [24]. The channel amplitude, phase, angle and time information
for each path can be derived based on the superposition of the paths that arrive at
the RX as they propagate from the TX and are reﬂected off the scatterers.
On the other hand, the correlation-based modeling approach, which has been
widely used to model multiple antenna systems, employs the channel second-order
statistics. In this approach, the transfer functions of each TX and RX antenna
element pair, as well as their signal correlations, are characterized. The generic full
correlation model describes the spatial behavior of a MIMO channel using a full
correlation matrix given by
R = E{vec(H)vec(H)H},
(2.1)
where H is a channel matrix of size NRX × NTX, where NRX is the number of
RX antennas and NTX the number of TX antennas. The model requires a total of
(NTXNRX)2 real-valued parameters, which makes it too complex when the number
of antennas is large, especially in the context of 60 GHz technology. Furthermore,
the relationship between the elements of the correlation matrix and the physical

60 GHz Channel Characterizations and Modeling
21
interpretation of the channel is difﬁcult to establish under the full correlation model
[25]. A simpliﬁed version of the correlation based model is the Kronecker based
model [26], which is used in IEEE 802.11n model. The Kronecker model is compu-
tationally simpler than the full correlation based model, especially when the number
of antennas is large since the directional properties of the channel at the TX and
RX are assumed to be independent.
The pros and cons of the GBSM and correlation based stochastic channel mod-
els are mainly related to the implementation complexity, accuracy and whether the
spatial-temporal correlation is explicitly available or implicitly inferred from the
channel model. The latter can provide a good platform for theoretical framework
development. For instance, the GBSM channel model is not very useful for theoret-
ical analysis since the channel coefﬁcients generated do not explicitly present the
correlation properties. This makes it very difﬁcult to relate the simulation results
to the theoretical analysis. On the other hand, the correlation model, which only
describes the second-order statistics, provides no physical intuition for the propa-
gation. In addition, the simplicity of the correlation based approach is down to the
smaller number of input parameters as compared to the GBSM model. However,
such simplicity is traded off by the applicability of the model to only the average
correlation behavior of the channel, which is antenna array dependent.
2.3
Channel Characterization
For all the modeling approaches discussed in Section 2.2, two important chan-
nel properties can be characterized, namely large-scale and small-scale channel
characterizations, which will be discussed in Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2, respectively.
2.3.1
Large-Scale Channel Characterization
Large-scale channel characterization consists of path loss (PL) and shadowing
effects, as illustrated in Figure 2.2.
2.3.1.1
Path Loss
The PL is deﬁned as the ratio of the received signal power to the transmit signal
power, which describes the attenuation of the mean power as a function of distance
traveled. PL is very important for link budget analysis and network planning in order
to ensure that the actual deployment can meet the target coverage. The PL at 60 GHz
is much more severe than at lower frequencies since the free space PL at 60 GHz
alone increases by approximately 22 dB compared to 5 GHz band. Furthermore, the

Figure 2.2
Illustration of the effect of large-scale and small-scale fading.
PL at 60 GHz is subject to additional losses due to oxygen absorption and rain
attenuation. As shown in Figure 2.3, the oxygen absorption peaks at 60 GHz with
15 dB attenuation per kilometer (with 10 dB/km around the 8 GHz band centered
around 60 GHz), while rain attenuation adds losses of a few decibels, depending
on the rain intensity. This poses a severe challenge in delivering a gigabit wireless
transmission with reliable link margin and makes 60 GHz a promising candidate for
indoor rather than outdoor applications.3
Furthermore, the difference in PL for a wideband system such as ultra-wideband
(UWB) [27, 28], and 60 GHz, as compared to the narrowband system (e.g. IEEE
802.11a/b/g/n), is that the PL at UWB and 60 GHz is both distance and frequency
dependent. For example, [28] reported a frequency dependent PL model for the
UWB channel. Unfortunately, 60 GHz PL modeling with frequency dependence
has not yet been reported in the literature. In order to simplify the models, it is
assumed that the mid-band frequency point is used and only distance dependence
PL is modeled in this book (i.e. ignoring the frequency dependence PL). The PL
as a function of distance, d, is thus given by
PL(d)[dB] = PL(d)[dB] + Xσ[dB],
(2.2)
3Outdoor application for 60 GHz is mainly backhaul which employs highly directional antennas that
point to each other in a clear line-of-sight (LOS) scenario.

Equations (2.2)–(2.3). Prior to that, the data is segmented into LOS and NLOS
scenarios, respectively. Typically, a value of d0 = 1m is used as the reference even
though different values are also commonly used in many measurements.

60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
The PL exponent, n, for 60 GHz based measurements ranges from 0.40 to 2.10
and from 1.97 to 5.40 for LOS and NLOS, respectively, in various different indoor
environments. Speciﬁcally, in a typical ofﬁce environment, the value of n for LOS
and NLOS ranges from 1.16 to 2.17 and 2.83 to 4.00, respectively, while in a
laboratory environment, n takes values in the ranges 0.20–2.10 and 2.00–5.10 in
LOS and NLOS, respectively. Furthermore, in a corridor environment, n varies
from 0.87 to 2.29 for LOS. In general, a more reﬂective environment such as a
laboratory yields higher n values in NLOS since the reﬂected paths arriving at
the receiver are attenuated more compared to an ofﬁce scenario where diffraction
usually occurs. The small values of n(< 2) observed in LOS scenarios can be
justiﬁed by the presence of waveguiding and reverberation effects, which cause an
increase in power levels by multipath aggregation.
Several observations can be made on the basis of Table 2.1. Firstly, it can be
observed that even in the same type of environment, the derived value of n can
vary greatly from one instance to another. This is due to factors such as the type of
antenna used, the type of objects present, the layout of the environment, measure-
ment system capabilities and/or uncertainties, and the height of the TX and RX, all
of which could lead to different parameter values.
Secondly, in general, it can be seen that n increases as the directivity of the
antenna decreases at either end or at both ends of the link. This is justiﬁed since
the multipath effects become more prominent as the antenna directivity decreases.
Similarly, n increases as the size of the room increases. Larger room size tends to
lengthen delay spread. A general relationship can also be observed between n and
PL(d0) in which higher n is accompanied by lower PL(d0). In addition, the small
value of n in some LOS cases is compensated by a large PL(d0) value. The wide
range of PL(d0) might be due to antenna misalignment or inaccurate antenna gain
calibration.
Thirdly, [41] shows that antenna height has a strong inﬂuence on the value of n.
As the antenna height increases, n decreases rather dramatically due to the estab-
lishment of a clear LOS path between the TX and RX.
Finally, [33] shows that under a similar measurement setup, the PL increases very
rapidly in the case of cross-polar signal transmission as compared to the co-polar
signal case. The PL of co-polar signal transmission can be well approximated by
free space PL.
2.3.1.2
Shadowing
Shadowing signiﬁes the average signal power received over a large area (a few
tens of wavelengths) due to the dynamic evolution of propagation paths, whereby

60 GHz Channel Characterizations and Modeling
29
new paths arise and old paths disappear. Due to the variation in the surrounding
environment, the received power will be different from the mean value for a given
distance, which causes the PL variation about the mean value given in Equation
(2.2) or (2.3).
Many
measurement
results
reported
in
the
60 GHz
range
have
shown
that the shadowing fading is log-normally distributed [30, 42–44], that is,
Xσ[dB] = N(0, σS), where Xσ denotes a zero-mean Gaussian random variable
measured in decibels with standard deviation σS. The value of σS is site-speciﬁc,
as listed in Table 2.1 for different environments. The value of σS is higher at
60 GHz compared to lower frequencies since the transmission loss at 60 GHz is
much higher than at lower frequencies.
The shadowing parameters derived here assume that the channel is static and
there is no human movement. In the presence of human movement, measurement
results show that the obstruction by humans can be signiﬁcant and range from 18
to 36 dB [45]. Furthermore, the shadowing effect duration is relatively long, up
to several hundred milliseconds, and increases with the number of persons in the
environment [45].
2.3.2
Small-Scale Channel Characterization
Small-scale fading (i.e. fast fading) is caused by the multipath signals that arrive at
the receiver with random phases that add constructively or destructively. It causes
rapid changes in signal amplitude over a small distance (less than 10 wavelengths).
Over this small local area, the small-scale fading is approximately superimposed
on the constant large-scale fading. Before studying the various small-scale channel
effects, we look at the generic channel model representation for the 60 GHz channel.
2.3.2.1
Generic Channel Model
Based on the clustering phenomenon observed in both the temporal and spatial
domains from measurement data available in the literature such as [2, 29, 46, 47]
and the references therein, a generic 60 GHz channel model that takes clustering
into account is reasonable choice since it can always be reduced to the conventional
single cluster channel model as observed in [35, 48, 49]. The proposed cluster model
is based on the extension of the Saleh–Valenzuela (SV) model [50] to the angular
domain by Spencer et al. [51]. The complex baseband directional CIR is given by
h(t, φ, θ) =
L

l=0
Kl

k=0
αk,lδ(t −Tl −τk,l)δ(φ −l −ωk,l)δ(θ −
l −ψk,l),
(2.4)

30
60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
where δ(·) is the Dirac delta function, L is the total number of clusters and Kl is
the total number of rays in the lth cluster. The scalars αk,l, τk,l, ωk,l and ψk,l denote
the complex amplitude, time of arrival (ToA), angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of
departure (AoD) of the kth ray of the lth cluster, respectively. Note that the AoA
and AoD can consist either of azimuth domain, elevation domain, or both domains.
Similarly, the scalars Tl, l and 
l represent the mean ToA, mean AoA and mean
AoD of the of the lth cluster. The key assumption used in deriving Equation (2.4)
is that the spatial and temporal domains are independent and thus uncorrelated.
However, measurement results in [52] have shown a correlation between these two
domains, which can be modeled by two joint pdfs. It is also important to note that
each multipath in Equation (2.4) will experience distortions due to the frequency
dependence of the scatterers [52]. Both the frequency dependence and correlation
of spatial and temporal domains are so far not taking into consideration in any
60 GHz channel model due to lack of measurement results. For very high-speed
transmission, the channel described in Equation (2.4) can be assumed to remain
approximately static over tens to thousands of symbols. This is also called block
fading channel. This is mainly due to the low speed (up to 1.5 m/s) movement in
indoor environment which yields a maximum Doppler frequency, fD, of 300 Hz.
Invoking the relationship between coherence time, Tcoh, and fD, Tcoh = 9/16 πfD
[8], yields a coherence time of approximately 0.6 ms. The coherence time calculation
for this model is based on the assumption that the spectral broadening is due to
uniform multipath arrival over [0, 2π], which is usually valid for cellular systems
but might be doubtful at 60 GHz due to vastly different antenna and propagation
characteristics in both systems. Measurement results reported in [13] show that the
coherence time where the correlation starts to fall below 0.5 is no greater than 50 ms
for all the measurements scenarios in which people walked along a clear LOS path
at a speed of 1.7 m/s. Such a coherence time is signiﬁcantly larger than the symbol
time and corresponds to at least a few super-frames per beacon interval in IEEE
802.15.3 and IEEE 802.11.
2.3.2.2
Number of Clusters
The number of clusters is an important parameter for the channel models considered
here. Different deﬁnitions of clustering appear in the literature. Clustering is deﬁned
in this book as a group of rays arriving at approximately the same time and angle.
Various methods have been derived for cluster identiﬁcation, ranging from simple
visual inspection [50, 51] to advanced signal processing such as kernel density
estimation [52]. Different results have been obtained to describe the numbers of
clusters for wideband systems. In [27] it was reported that the number of clusters
is Poisson distributed and can be fully characterized by a mean number of clusters,
L. On the other hand, the available literature on 60 GHz reports diverse ﬁndings

60 GHz Channel Characterizations and Modeling
31
for this parameter. Analysis of the measurement results in [35, 36, 48, 49] indicates
that only a single cluster can be observed. Furthermore, analysis of IEEE 802.15.3c
measurement data for various environments and scenarios shows that L does not
follow a speciﬁc distribution. However, the observed mean number of clusters can
be calculated by visual inspection. Values range typically from 3 to 14. These
different ﬁndings could be due to several factors such as measurement bandwidth
and richness of scatterers (i.e. number of objects) in the environment. In cases
where the environment under consideration has more furniture, a larger number of
clusters would be expected as a result of superstructure (such as walls, furniture,
computers and doors) [53]. Higher bandwidth provides higher resolution that can
resolve more multipath components, which can cluster more easily as they propagate
in the channel.
2.3.2.3
Arrival Times
Under the assumption that the delay and angular domains can be modeled inde-
pendently, the ToA of the generic channel model described in Equation (2.4) relies
on two sets of parameters, namely, inter-cluster parameters, {Tl, L}, that charac-
terize the cluster and intra-cluster parameters, {Kl, αk,l, tk,l}, that characterize the
multipath components.
The cluster arrival and ray arrival time distributions are described by two Poisson
processes. According to this model, cluster inter-arrival times and ray intra-arrival
times are given by two independent exponential pdfs. In particular, the cluster arrival
time for each cluster is an exponentially distributed random variable conditioned
on the cluster arrival time of the previous cluster, which can be expressed as
p(Tl|Tl−1) = [− exp(Tl −Tl−1)],
for l > 0,
(2.5)
where  is the cluster arrival rate. Similarly, the ray arrival time for each ray is
an exponentially distributed random variable conditioned on the ray arrival time of
the previous ray given by
p(τk,l|τk−1,l) = λ[−λ exp(τk,l|τk−1,l)],
for k > 0,
(2.6)
where λ is the ray arrival rate. In the classical SV model, T0 and τ0,l are assumed to
be zero and all arrival times are relative with respect to the delay of the ﬁrst path.
2.3.2.4
Arrival Angles
By invoking the assumption that the delay and angular domains, as well as AoA
and AoD, are independent, the AoA and AoD of the generic channel model
described in Equation (2.4) rely on two sets of parameters, namely, inter-cluster

32
60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
parameters {l, 
l, L}, that characterize the cluster and intra-cluster parameters
{Kl, αk,l, ωk,l, ψk,l}, that characterize the multipath components.
Based on the 60 GHz measurement results reported in [54–56], the distribution
of the cluster mean AoA, l, conditioned on the ﬁrst cluster mean AoA, 0, can
be described by a uniform distribution over [0, 2π], that is,
p(l|0) = 1
2π ,
for l > 0.
(2.7)
Note that the cluster AoA represents the mean of all AoAs within the cluster.
On the other hand, the ray AoAs within each cluster can be modeled either by
zero-mean Gaussian [56] or zero-mean Laplacian distributions [54, 55] as given
respectively by
p(ωk,l) =

(2.9)
where σφ is the standard deviation. UWB measurements and spatial modeling
reported in [57] also proposed that Laplacian distribution can be used to model
the AoA information in a wideband channel. Similarly, the AoD can also be mod-
eled using the appropriate pdf but unfortunately no such 60 GHz measurement and
modeling are available to date to characterize the AoD.
2.3.2.5
Power Spectrum
The power delay angular spectrum (PDAS) of a directional channel is given by
P(t, φ, θ) = E


h(t, φ, θ)


2
,
(2.10)
where E[·] and | · | denote the expectation and absolute value, respectively. In
general, this can be simpliﬁed by assuming the delay, AoA and AoD are independent
of each other, which leads to
P(t, φ, θ) = P(t)P(φ)P(θ),
(2.11)
where P(t), P(φ) and P(θ) are the power delay spectrum (PDS), power AoA spec-
trum (PAAS), and power AoD spectrum (PADS), respectively. The PADS remains
unavailable in the literature due the difﬁculty of obtaining it by measurement. Thus,
the focus here is on the PDS and PAAS.

60 GHz Channel Characterizations and Modeling
33
Power Delay Spectrum
The PDS of a channel, more commonly called the power delay proﬁle (PDP), is
the average power of the channel as a function of the excess delay with respect
to the ﬁrst arrival path. A number of important parameters can be derived by
analyzing the PDP. In particular, the mean excess delay, root mean squared (rms)
delay spread, timing jitter and standard deviation [29] can be obtained from the PDP
of the channel. While these parameters are useful for speciﬁc system design, the
most commonly used parameter is the rms delay spread, which is a second moment
of the PDP that statistically measures the time dispersion of a channel. The rms
delay spread, denoted τc, is inversely proportional to the coherence bandwidth of a
channel, Bc, which determines whether a system is narrowband or wideband with
respect to its channel. A narrowband system occurs when τc is less than the symbol
period, Ts (or when Bc is larger than the signal bandwidth) of the system. This results
in a ﬂat fading channel. The reverse is true for a wideband system when τc > Ts (or
when Bc is less than the signal bandwidth), which results in a frequency selective
channel. A ﬂat fading channel reduces the received signal-to-noise ratio due to
deep fading, while a frequency selective channel causes inter-symbol interference
that leads to irreducible bit error rate (BER) performance. Hence, τc determines
the maximum transmission data rate in the channel without equalization and serves
as a key design parameter for both single carrier (SC) and orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing systems, as described in Chapter 5. A list of the rms delay
values reported in the literature is given in Table 2.2.
The rms delay spread strongly depends on several factors. Firstly, the rms delay
spread increases as the size of the room and the density of objects present in the
room increase. This can be explained by the fact that for larger rooms with more
objects, it takes longer for the multipath to reach the RX, prolonging the rms delay
spread. Furthermore, the type of objects present in the environment can signiﬁcantly
affect the rms delay spread value. For instance, the increment in rms delay spread
becomes more pronounced in the presence of more reﬂective objects such as metal
than absorptive objects such as wood.
Secondly, the rms delay spread decreases as the directivity of the TX and/or RX
antennas increases. Note, however, that such reduction in rms delay spread is only
noticeable when the TX and RX antenna patterns are aligned to the most signiﬁcant
AoD and AoA, respectively. This can be explained by the spatial ﬁltering introduced
by the directive antennas which can “remove” undesired paths by focusing on the
direction with the main path. However, as the misalignment increases, the rms delay
spread will start to increase even if directive antennas are used at TX and RX. Ray
tracing results in [68] show that in the case of perfect alignment, rms delay spread
decreased by more than 50% from 27 ns (for omnidirectional antennas at both TX
and RX) to 12.5 ns (for 60◦HPBW antennas at both TX and RX). Conversely,
in case of misalignment at TX with HPBW of 30◦and omni RX, the rms delay

spread for 60% of the locations increased marginally (from 9 ns to 10 ns) when the
misalignment is 10◦, and dramatically (from 9 ns to 21 ns) when the misalignment
was above 30◦. Measurement results reported in [44] also show a similar conclusion
in terms of rms delay spread decreasing as the antenna directivity increases in the
case of perfect alignment up to 35◦of misalignment.
Power Angular Spectrum
The power angular spectrum of a channel is the average power of the channel as a
function of angular information. A MIMO channel measurement is reported in [69],
but no modeling work has been done as we go to press. However, several 60 GHz
measurement results on single-input multiple-output (SIMO) conﬁgurations were
reported in [29, 35, 36, 44, 46, 54, 55, 70] but only limited AoA modeling has been
carried out to characterize the AoA information. The AoA information – such as
mean AoA, AoA associated with maximum power and rms AoA spread – provides
important design parameters for multiple antenna systems. For instance, the mean
AoA and maximum power AoA provide a preferred beamformed direction. On
the other hand, the rms AoA spread provides a statistical measure of the angular
dispersion of a channel, which determines the amount of diversity and multiplexing
gain that can be achieved from the channel. A list of the AoA measurements reported
in the literature with the corresponding PAAS shape and AoA spread is given in
Table 2.3.

It is important that we distinguish the ToA statistics and the PDS as well as AoA
statistics and PAAS. For example, the ToA represents the frequency of paths that
arrive within a certain time window (bin) without considering its power as long as
the paths are within the dynamic range of the system. The PDS, on the other hand,
represents the arrival of paths with a certain power. It is important to note that a
larger number of paths arriving within the same time bin would not necessarily
contribute to more received power as observed in the PDS, especially in the LOS
scenario due to the presence of a dominant component.
2.3.2.6
Small-Scale Fading Statistics
Different from conventional narrowband systems, which consist of vector sum-
mation of many irresolvable paths as a result of limited capability of the system
measurement bandwidth, the amplitude fading distributions are typically Rayleigh
and Rician for NLOS and LOS scenarios, respectively. In indoor wideband systems,
such as 60 GHz and UWB, small-scale amplitude fading can follow different dis-
tributions depending on type of environment, measurement bandwidth and scenario
under consideration. For example, the Rayleigh distribution is used to model LOS
for library environments using a 1 GHz bandwidth measurement system [46]. The
Rayleigh distribution is also used to model LOS for ofﬁce, home and library envi-
ronments using a measurement system with 5 GHz bandwidth [48]. Measurement
results with 100 MHz bandwidth in the laboratory [71] show that in the LOS case,
the amplitude is Rician distributed for all channel taps, while in NLOS case only
the ﬁrst tap follows Rician distribution and the rest of the taps can be modeled by
a Rayleigh distribution. Measurement in different corridors using 1 GHz bandwidth
shows the amplitude is Rician with different K-factor values [49]. Elsewhere in the
literature, the Weibull distribution is used to model LOS/NLOS for residential envi-
ronments using a 7 GHz bandwidth [53], and the log-normal distribution is used to
model LOS/NLOS for ofﬁce environments using a 2 GHz bandwidth [71]. The Nak-
agami distribution is used to model ofﬁce LOS using a 500 MHz bandwidth [72].
As the bandwidth of the measurement system increases sufﬁciently, more multipath
components can be resolved and thus the effect of small-scale fading is expected
to become less extreme.
2.3.3
Polarization
The use of polarization in wireless communications has recently gained a lot
of attention, especially at lower frequencies due to limited mobile terminal size.
Despite 60 GHz being less constrained in terms of antenna spacing, polarization
does offer advantages in multipath environments. Measurement results in [62] show
that the use of circular polarization can effectively reduce the rms delay spread by

60 GHz Channel Characterizations and Modeling
41
about 50% over vertical and horizontal polarization. This can be explained by the
fact that circular polarization suppresses odd-order (1st, 3rd, . . .) reﬂection. Further-
more, second-order reﬂection paths typically undergo higher attenuation at 60 GHz
and become insigniﬁcant when they arrive at the RX. Thus, circular polarization
can be a good candidate for LOS operation. It is shown in [73] that polarization
can be exploited to increase the capacity in LOS for dual-polarized MIMO systems,
while introducing negligible capacity degradation in NLOS.
The modeling of polarization in a MIMO setup has been studied in [74]. In
particular, the spatial-polarized channel matrix for an NTX × NRX dual-polarized
sub-array [74] is given by
Hsp = Hspatial ⊗Xp,
(2.12)
where Hspatial is an NTX/2 × NRX/2 matrix that characterizes the spatial information
of the sub-arrays and Xp is the 2 × 2 dual polarized matrix given by [74],

(2.14)
where the ϕk (k = 1, 2, 3 and 4) are uniformly distributed on [0, 2π]. While these
results can be extended to the 60 GHz context, no 60 GHz measurement results are
available to verify the applicability of such model at 60 GHz. It has been shown
that the 60 GHz polarization characteristics differ signiﬁcantly compared to lower
frequencies (e.g. XPD value [71]).
A slightly different modeling approach was taken in [75], whereby both
the polarization characteristics of antennas and propagation are taken into
consideration. Using the proposed modeling approach in [75], the CIR of Equation
(2.4) is modiﬁed as

characteristics differ between clusters but remain the same for rays within the same
cluster. The modeling approach of [75] is complex and thus a lot of assumptions
need to be made in order to simplify the model implementation, which is outside
the scope of this chapter. Interested readers are referred to [75].

Industry Standard Channel Models
In this section, two industry standard channel models, IEEE 802.15.3c and IEEE
802.11ad, will be discussed since they are the key models used for evaluation of
60 GHz communications system.
2.4.1
IEEE 802.15.3c
IEEE 802.15.3c channel models are mainly derived based on wideband measure-
ment results conducted in ofﬁce, residential, library and desktop environments. For
each environment, LOS and NLOS scenarios are deﬁned. Some NLOS scenarios
are generated from their LOS counterparts by appropriately removing the LOS
component from the model [2].
2.4.1.1
Large-Scale Characterization
The IEEE 802.15.3c PL model adopted the conventional way to model the average
PL without specifying a loss incurred by a speciﬁc object as given in Equation
(2.3). The simple PL model is given by

(2.18)
IEEE 802.15.3c deﬁnes PL models for residential and ofﬁce in both LOS and NLOS
scenarios. The parameters of these PL models are given in Table 2.4. Note that these
parameters were derived from measurements using different values of transmitter
antenna gain, GTX, and receiver antenna gain, GRX. In order to remove the effects
of both antenna gains, one can compensate or adjust the proposed value of the
parameter PL(d0) by a factor of GTX + GRX as suggested in [76]. For example, the
parameters of the PL model in residential and ofﬁce environment summarized here
were derived by eliminating the effects of both the TX and RX gains.
Under such approximation, assuming 0 dBi for the TX and RX antennas allows
users to use their own antenna gain for link budget analysis. However, the proposed
approximation becomes inaccurate when highly directive antennas are employed
since only a limited number of multipaths could have reached the antenna, and thus
the value of the parameters n and σS will be different [76]. The shadowing effect
is log-normally distributed as described in Section 2.3.1.2.

Small-Scale Characterization
IEEE 802.15.3c adopted the concept of generic channel modeling as described
in Equation (2.4). However, some measurement results show that when directive
antennas are used in the measurement, especially in the LOS scenario, there appears
a distinct and strong LOS path on top of the clustering phenomena. This LOS path
can be included by adding a LOS component to (2.4) as given by
h(t, φ, θ) = βδ(τ, φ, θ)

αk,lδ(t −Tl −τk,l)δ(φ −l −ωk,l)δ(θ −

(2.19)
where the ﬁrst term, βδ(τ, φ, θ), accounts for the gain of the strict LOS component
(i.e. the multipath gain of the ﬁrst arrival path) which can be found deterministically
using ray tracing or a simple geometry based method or statistically. The second
term on the right-hand side of Equation (2.19) is exactly described as in the case
of extended directional SV model.
For example, in a desktop LOS scenario, a two-path response was observed for
the LOS component due to reﬂection off the table. In this case, βδ(τ, φ, θ) can be
modeled statistically as
β[dB] = 20 log10

respectively. Gt1, Gt2, Gr1, Gr2 are the gain of the TX antenna for path 1 and path
2, and gain of the RX antenna for path 1 and path 2, respectively. Equation (2.20)
becomes deterministic for all the channels considered when 0 is set to zero, and
becomes stochastic when 0 is non-zero for the LOS desktop scenario.
The mean number of clusters, L, as observed in IEEE 802.15.3c channel model
ranges from 3 to 14 depending on the environment and scenario (i.e. LOS or NLOS)
under consideration. The number of clusters is obtained from uniform distribution
using the value L for each channel realization.
Even in the presence of strong LOS, as when using a directive antenna as
described in Equation (2.19), the directional SV model remains valid except that
T0 and τ0,l are no longer zero since the reference zero point has been moved. With
proper normalization with respect to strong LOS, the modiﬁed model behaves in a
similar way to the conventional SV model.
The IEEE 802.15.3c channel model is a SIMO model which only characterizes
the AoA. The 15.3c Task Group (TG3c) adopted a uniform distribution over [0,2π]
for the cluster mean AoA, l, conditioned on the ﬁrst cluster mean AoA, 0, as
described in Equation (2.7). On the other hand, the ray AoAs within each cluster
can be modeled either by zero-mean Gaussian or zero-mean Laplacian distributions
given by Equations (2.8) and (2.9), respectively. Note that due to the presence of
a strong LOS component as indicated in (2.19), the values of 0 and ω0,l are no
longer zero since the reference zero point has been moved to the direction arrival
of the LOS component. With proper normalization with respect to the strong LOS,
the modiﬁed model behaves in a similar way to the directional SV model.
Despite various amplitude distributions reported in the literature, the analysis of
the TG3c measurement results for different measurement system bandwidths and
environments found that the both cluster and ray amplitudes can be modeled by
log-normal distribution given by

IEEE 802.11ad
The IEEE 802.11ad channel model is currently under development. Two types of
model are being developed under the 11ad Task Group (TGad) framework depend-
ing on the modeling approach used. The ﬁrst uses ray tracing to derive statistical
models [3]. While this uncommon modeling approach is used to reduce the mea-
surement effort but its accuracy is debatable. The second type of model relies
on channel measurement [77] to derive a statistical channel model. Hence, IEEE
802.11ad is a mixture of ray tracing and statistical modeling approaches. As we go
to press, some models are still work in progress and we focus on the models for
conference room and living room environments.
2.4.2.1
Large-Scale Characterization
The PL models in IEEE 802.11ad for conference rooms are derived based on
averaging over large instantaneous PL values (channel realizations) generated from
the statistical channel model at different TX–RX separation. Furthermore, the PL
models are developed by using the basic directional antenna model with HPBW
from 10◦to 60◦or a beamforming algorithm that adjusts the transmit and receive
beams along the cluster with maximum power. The general representation of the
PL model is given by
PL(d)[dB] = Ac + 20 log10(f ) + 10n log10( d),
(2.23)
where Ac is constant value. The ﬁrst two terms of Equation (2.23) can be treated
as PL(d0) as in Equation (2.3), though the two PL modeling approaches are
different. A summary of values for Ac, n and PL(d0) at f = 60 GHz is given
in Table 2.9 for different environments and scenarios obtained in IEEE 802.11ad
based on analysis of ray tracing.

The IEEE 802.11ad model adopts the generic CIR introduced in IEEE 802.15.3c.
However, TGad uses a simpler approach to model the LOS component described in
Equation (2.19), whereby a Friis model is used to derive the amplitude of the LOS
path. The LOS path is a cluster with a single ray path that can be computed as

On the other hand, the gain of a cluster, βi, is given by
βi[dB] = 20 log10

giλ
4π(d + R)

,
(2.25)
where gi is a reﬂection loss, d is distance between TX and RX (along LOS path),
R is a total distance along the cluster path decreased by d which is a product
of ToA of the LOS and the speed of light. Note that gi is modeled by a log-
normal distribution with mean value −10 dB and rms value 4 dB in the case of
ﬁrst-order reﬂection, and with mean value −16 dB and rms value 5 dB in the case
of second-order reﬂection.
Furthermore, the model also accounts for cluster blockage due to objects present
in the conference room such as humans and laptops. For simplicity, each type of
cluster is modeled using cluster blockage probability. The probability of blockage
in the STA-STA scenario is given in Table 2.10.
The IEEE 802.11ad model assumes several types of clusters, with a ﬁxed number
of clusters for each cluster type. Four types of cluster can be identiﬁed, originating
from the ﬁrst-order reﬂection from walls, ﬁrst-order reﬂection from ceiling, second-
order reﬂection from walls and second-order reﬂection from ceiling, respectively.
Depending on the scenario and environment, some clusters might be present or
absent from the model. The numbers of clusters for LOS and NLOS in the confer-
ence room and living room scenarios are shown in Table 2.11. The results obtained
in IEEE 802.11ad model are derived from ray tracing simulation by placing the AP
and STA in predeﬁned locations [3]. For each channel realization, the ﬁxed number
of clusters is used to generate the directional CIR.
The IEEE 802.11ad model obtains the empirical distribution of the ToA of the
different cluster types through ray tracing simulation. In the conference room envi-
ronment with the STA-STA scenario, the ToAs of the cluster arising due to the
ﬁrst- and second-order reﬂection from wall and ceiling, respectively, are modeled
by four inter-cluster ToA pdfs shown in Table 2.12.

On the other hand, for the intra-cluster case, three types of rays are speciﬁed,
namely, a central ray, pre-cursor rays and post-cursor rays. A central ray, αi,0, is
a single ray with ﬁxed amplitude, while pre-cursor rays, and post-cursor rays are
a group of rays with total number of rays given by Npre and Npost, respectively.
Both pre-cursor and post-cursor ray types are modeled using the Poisson process
given by Equation (2.6) with arrival rate, λpre and λpost, respectively. Furthermore,
the average amplitudes at delay τ of pre-cursor rays, Apre(τ), and post-cursor rays,
Apost(τ), are exponentially decaying at rate γpre and γpost, respectively.

parameters in conference room and living room environments.
Unlike the IEEE 802.15.3c model, the IEEE 802.11ad model is a MIMO model.
In the IEEE 802.11ad model, four types of angular information are characterized
corresponding to the ﬁrst-order reﬂection from the wall, ﬁrst-order reﬂection from
the ceiling, second-order reﬂection from the wall and second-order reﬂection from
the ceiling. The generation of the cluster AoA and AoD for the given type of angular
information follows speciﬁc properties as described in [3]. The AoA, AoD and
elevation-angle of arrival (EoA) distributions for STA-STA and STA-AP scenario
are given in Table 2.14
In the IEEE 802.11ad model, the pre-cursor and post-curser rays have uniformly
distributed phases over [0,2π] and Rayleigh distributed amplitudes with mean val-
ues as described in [3]. The amplitudes of the ﬁrst pre-cursor and post-curser ray
are relative to the central ray by a factor given by 5 dB and 10 dB, respectively.

Summary
In this chapter, we have presented a review of 60 GHz channel modeling, in which
the small-scale and large-scale channel characterizations are thoroughly discussed.
In particular, the PL and shadowing effects impose huge losses to the communica-
tion link. For example, at distance of 10 m, a total of 110.4 dB loss is incurred by the
path loss in NLOS in the residential environment in IEEE 802.15.3c channel model
(see Table 2.4). These losses need to be compensated in order to deliver the promise
of multi-gigabit wireless transmission. By using beamforming technology, one can
easily provide steerable 15 dB gain over the space of interest at one end of the link.
Beamforming is very critical to 60 GHz communications (see Chapter 5). Despite
the availability of the diverse channel models in the literature, a true 60 GHz MIMO
channel model based on measurement results is still lacking. More such measure-
ments and modeling work should be conducted to further characterize the MIMO
propagation mechanisms in the 60 GHz band. Furthermore, previous results have
demonstrated the applicability of circularly polarized signals for 60 GHz transmis-
sion; however, a generic channel model for different polarization signals is still
unavailable and certainly deserves more in-depth investigation.

Non-Ideal Radio Frequency
Front-End Models in 60 GHz
Systems
Chang-Soon Choi, Maxim Piz and Eckhard Grass
As described in Chapter 1, 60 GHz wireless systems are now seeing various kinds
of consumer applications from short-range ﬁle transfer to indoor Gbps home net-
works.1 One of the key technical challenges for the widespread commercial use
of 60 GHz based wireless end-user products is their cost-effective implementa-
tion. This has provided the motivation for a great deal of work on silicon-based
millimeter-wave technologies capable of providing higher integration and lower
power consumption than the III-V compound semiconductor technologies used in
60 GHz bands even a few years ago.
Nevertheless, there is still much to do if we are to make silicon-based 60 GHz
front-ends competitive with microwave front-ends below 5 GHz. The challenging
60 GHz radio frequency (RF) front-ends induce several critical RF non-idealities
that must be addressed in 60 GHz system design. This problem becomes even more
critical in mobile or handheld device related applications in which an aggressive
RF circuit design for low power consumption and small form factors is a must.
The aim of this chapter is to address RF non-idealities that should be considered
in the 60 GHz system design and to establish their behavioral models, providing

simple and efﬁcient methods to predict system performance without computation-
ally complex circuit level simulations. Section 3.1 gives an overview of main RF
analog front-end architectures and discusses their applicability for 60 GHz systems.
RF non-idealities in these architectures are also brieﬂy introduced. Section 3.2
discusses the nonlinearity of power ampliﬁers. A brief review of power ampliﬁer
models is ﬁrst given, and then their inﬂuences on system performance are presented.
Section 3.3 deals with phase noise arising from local oscillators (LOs) and the
behavioral models we use to characterize it. The chapter ends with a discussion of
other RF impairments that may also affect system performance.
3.1
RF Front-End Architecture
3.1.1
Super-Heterodyne Architecture
The super-heterodyne architecture has long been a standard choice for wireless
receivers due to its capability to provide high selectivity and sensitivity. Basically,
it converts received RF signal energy into baseband through several steps, which
makes it possible to optimize system parameters at each step. Figure 3.1(a) shows
a block diagram of a two-step super-heterodyne receiver. An RF bandpass ﬁlter
ﬁrst rejects out-of-band signals among the RF signals collected by the antenna. The
ﬁltered in-band signals are then ampliﬁed by a low-noise ampliﬁer (LNA) while
keeping the system noise ﬂoor as low as possible. The next ﬁlter suppresses image
signals which could be overlapped with original signals after mixing. The frequency
down-conversion with the ﬁrst LO moves RF signals down to the intermediate
frequency (IF) band. Channel selection is done at the IF stage with the help of highly
selective ﬁlters, which lessen the dynamic range requirement in the following stages.
An automatic gain control (AGC) ampliﬁer adjusts signal levels for optimum I/Q
demodulator operation. After splitting into two signals, the IF signals are down-
converted into baseband with two mixers and the second quadrature LOs. After
additional gain-control and anti-aliasing ﬁltering, the baseband signals are converted
to digital.
In addition to high channel selectivity, this results in much less LO self-mixing
which deteriorates receiver dynamic range, because the ﬁrst LO is different from RF.
There might still be some LO leakage of the second LO to the IF I/Q mixer, but we
can expect good isolation in the low-IF region and there is no high gain component
in IF stages. Another beneﬁt would be the possibility of a ﬁxed frequency LO at the
ﬁrst LO stage (not all super-heterodyne). It does not require a voltage-controlled
oscillator (VCO) with a wide tuning range and its phase-locked loop (PLL) can
be optimized to suppress the phase-noise contribution from the VCO, which gives
improved phase-noise characteristics than a tunable frequency synthesizer covering
all the RF channels.

RF analog front-end: (a) super-heterodyne; (b) direct conversion; and
(c) low-IF receiver architecture.
Due to its superior performance, most 60 GHz transceivers developed so far are
based on the super-heterodyne architecture. Image rejection problems can be alle-
viated by incorporating high IF of more than a few gigahertz with the frequency
selective responses of an LNA or power ampliﬁer (PA) without integrating an
external image rejection ﬁlter. For example, there has been work reporting 5, 9 and
12 GHz IF for 60 GHz transceivers [1–3]. The use of 5 GHz has proved the most
popular of these since the IF building blocks could be directly used for 5 GHz wire-
less LAN applications. Alternatively, this IF can be generated from the ﬁrst LO by
frequency division – the sliding IF architecture. This potentially eliminates the use

66
60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
of an additional crystal oscillator and PLL for “still high” IF down-conversion. This
results in smaller form factor and lower power consumption without sacriﬁcing the
advantages of super-heterodyne architecture.
3.1.2
Direct-Conversion Architecture
In contrast to the super-heterodyne architecture, the direct-conversion architecture
converts received RF signals into baseband without any intermediate stage.
Figure 3.1(b) shows a block diagram of a direct-conversion receiver. After ﬁltering
and low-noise ampliﬁcation, signal levels are adjusted by AGC for optimum
quadrature demodulation. After splitting into two signals, the IF signals are
directly down-converted into baseband with two RF mixers and the quadrature
LO. The following baseband low-pass ﬁlter (LPF) provides not only anti-aliasing
for sampling but also channel selection by rejecting adjacent channels.
This architecture is apparently simpler and requires fewer components than
the super-heterodyne architecture. In addition, it does not suffer from the image
problems that always exist in multi-step frequency conversion architectures. Thus
it is easier to have monolithic one-chip integration without the necessity for image
reject and intermediate IF ﬁlters. This is particularly attractive in mobile applica-
tions where low power consumption is the most critical ﬁgure-of-merit. The major
drawback of direct-conversion receivers is higher dynamic range requirements
in RF components including ampliﬁers and mixers since RF signals are directly
converted into baseband and channel selection is done in baseband. LO self-mixing
is more serious, which results in DC offset and degraded receiver dynamic range.
I/Q mismatch is another issue that has to be taken into account in direct-conversion
receivers. It mainly comes from the existing layout tolerance of active and passive
elements used in RF components, and becomes larger as designated frequency
increases.
In the design of 60 GHz wireless systems, the immature 60 GHz circuit tech-
nologies have made it more challenging to use the direct-conversion architecture.
Nevertheless, several results have been reported especially for short-range
ﬁle transfer applications that require low-cost transceivers with low power
consumption [4–5].
3.1.3
Low-IF Architecture
The low-IF architecture is also called “digital IF” since down-converted IF signals
are digitally processed after analog-to-digital conversion. A block diagram is shown
in Figure 3.1(c). RF signals are not directly converted into baseband but moved to
the low-IF band where the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) sampling rate can
support the conversion into digital signals. Then, these low-IF signals are sampled

Non-Ideal RF Front-End Models in 60 GHz Systems
67
with ADC and I/Q quadrature demodulation is done in the digital domain. This was
originally proposed to overcome the problems of the direct-conversion architecture
while keeping the simple RF architecture. However, this increases the burden of
ADC which requires both higher sampling rate and higher dynamic range.
The ADC sampling rate has already been a bottleneck for Gbps 60 GHz wire-
less systems. For example, the IEEE 802.15.3c standard requires a sampling rate
in excess of 2.6 GHz [6]. However, there are few ADCs available for this sam-
pling rate which satisfy the required number of bits. Low IF would need more than
5 GHz sampling with more than 8 bits, which is hardly realizable with current tech-
nologies. Thus, low-IF architectures are currently not in the mainstream of 60 GHz
system design.
3.2
Nonlinear Power Ampliﬁer
3.2.1
Tradeoff Between Linearity and Efﬁciency
Most active RF components in transmitters and receivers exhibit nonlinear transfer
characteristics. Among them, the power ampliﬁer is known as the most dominant
nonlinear source in a wireless transmitter. This problem is more serious in the
60 GHz wireless systems of interest in this book since silicon-based integrated
power ampliﬁers which are desirable for low-cost solutions cannot provide enough
radiation power transmission while keeping high linearity.
Figure 3.2 shows one example of a 60 GHz power ampliﬁer fabricated by the
SiGe process, which plots output power and power added efﬁciency (PAE) as a

function of input power [7]. The PAE, denoted by η, is deﬁned as the ratio of
ampliﬁed output signal power to DC power applied to the power ampliﬁer, which
can be expressed as
η = Pout −Pin
Pdc
,
(3.1)
where Pin is the input power, Pout is the desired output power of a power
ampliﬁer in the band of interest, and Pdc is the DC input power supplied to the
power ampliﬁer.
In modern wireless communication systems, the power ampliﬁer accounts for the
largest portion of system power consumption, thus it is highly favorable to drive
a power ampliﬁer close to output saturation point in order to get maximum power
efﬁciency, shown on the right-hand axis of Figure 3.2. However, this increases the
nonlinearity of the power ampliﬁer, resulting in increased distortion and degraded
signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR). Apparently, there is a tradeoff between
power efﬁciency and nonlinearity imposed on the power ampliﬁer. This is particu-
larly important for a system designer to take into account in deciding the optimum
driving level of a power ampliﬁer that fulﬁlls system requirements.
This tradeoff also depends on the class of the power ampliﬁer. Classes A, B, AB
and C are the most widely used power ampliﬁers. The classiﬁcation is determined
by input signal level and the operation point of an ampliﬁer. Simpliﬁed illustrations
of the operation conditions of these power ampliﬁers are given in Figure 3.3.
In class A power ampliﬁers, as shown in Figure 3.3(a), the core transistor is biased
to be in active mode all the time. This results in an input signal fully ampliﬁed
through its entire cycle, and a 360◦conduction angle at the output stage. Nonlinear
distortion is minimized at the expense of large current and voltage bias, implying
high linearity but low power efﬁciency. Moreover, the biasing current is always
applied regardless of the input signal status, leading to low power efﬁciency. The
maximum efﬁciency for class A is 50% if ideal inductive load is used.
In order to get higher efﬁciency, the core transistor in a power ampliﬁer is
designed to be in active mode only in half duty cycle (180◦) of input signals.
As seen in Figure 3.3(b), it is inevitable for class B to exhibit a higher level of
distortion than class A. However, this approach increases the ideal power efﬁciency
to 78.5% and the average efﬁciency is several times higher than that of class A
when high dynamic range input signals are applied.
A compromise between class A and class B is the class AB mode shown in
Figure 3.3(c). The conduction angle is between 180◦and 360◦, which gives better
efﬁciency than class A but exhibits larger nonlinear distortions. However, the level
of nonlinear distortion can be neglected or compensated in some applications, parti-
cularly in systems employing a single carrier (SC) modulation scheme. The bias

level is just above the threshold level and can be adjusted according to linearity
requirements.
Class C is a more power-efﬁcient solution than class B. The transistor is biased
below the threshold voltage (in cutoff mode) so that it becomes active only for less
than half the cycle of input signals as illustrated in Figure 3.3(d). Theoretically, the
power efﬁciency can be up to 100% by simply decreasing the conduction angle to 0◦.
However, this signiﬁcantly decreases the output power level. Generally, class C
modes can achieve a power efﬁciency of 90% by using a 90◦conduction angle.

Nonlinearity Modeling
In order to quantify the inﬂuence of PA nonlinearity on system performance, a
behavioral model for PA characteristics is required. In an RF front-end speciﬁcation,
gain compression and inter-modulation distortion levels are normally described to
express the level of nonlinearity. These system parameters can be derived by simple

analytical models. Assuming a power ampliﬁer is a time-invariant system modeled
with third-order polynomials, the output signal, y(t), is expressed as
y(t) = a1x(t) + a2x2(t) + a3x3(t),
(3.2)
where x(t) is the input signal and a1, a2, a3 are polynomial coefﬁcients: a1 indicates
small signal linear gain, while a2 and a3 are nonlinear coefﬁcients attributed to the
second- and third-order harmonics, respectively. Suppose that the input signal is a
single sinusoidal signal, x(t) = A cos(ωf t), with amplitude A and frequency ωf ;
then the amplitudes of the output signal components can be listed as:
DC,
1
2a2A2;
Fundamental (ωf ),
a1A + 3
4a3A3;
2nd harmonic (2ωf ),
1
2a2A2;
(3.3)
3rd harmonic (3ωf ),
1
4a3A2.
The implication is that nonlinearity generates new frequency components that appear
as spectral regrowth inducing adjacent channel interference.
The gain for fundamental output (ωf ) has small signal linear gain (a1) and
third-order nonlinear coefﬁcients (a3). This means that the gain decreases when
a3 becomes negative. The input level where the gain decreases by 1 dB from small
signal linear gain is called the input 1 dB compression point (IP1 dB) and the cor-
responding output is called the output 1 dB compression point (OP1 dB). The IP1 dB
is given by
IP1 dB =

(3.4)
This nonlinearity becomes more critical when multi-tone input signals are applied
since it gives rise to frequency mixing components between multi-tone signals,
typically called inter-modulation distortion (IMD). Assuming two-tone signals are
applied, i.e. x(t) = A cos(ω1t) + A cos(ω2t), the amplitudes of fundamental and
inter-modulation components can be expressed as follows: fundamental (ω1),
(a1A + (9a3/4)A3) cos(ω1t), (a1A + (9a3/4)A3) cos(ω2t);
second-order inter-modulation,
a2A2 cos((ω1 + ω2)t) + a2A2 cos((ω1 −ω2)t);
third-order inter-modulation,
(3a3/4)A3 cos((2ω1 + ω2)t) + (3a3/4)A3 cos((2ω1 −ω2)t)
+ (3a3/4)A3 cos((ω1 + 2ω2)t) + (3a3/4)A3 cos((ω1 −2ω2)t)

Non-Ideal RF Front-End Models in 60 GHz Systems
71
Here, the second-order inter-modulation can be removed simply by employing a
fully differential design of circuits or bandpass ﬁlter because it is far from the
band of interest. On the other hand, the third-order inter-modulation components
at (2ω1 −ω2) and (2ω2 −ω1) lie in the band of interest and cannot be eliminated
by applying a ﬁlter. These components degrade the quality of signals like a noise.
The spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) is commonly used to specify an input
power level which is only dominated by thermal noise level, free of such distortion.
It also introduces the third-order intercept point (IP3), where the third-order inter-
modulation components have the same power as the fundamental components. Note
that this does not exist in practice because a power ampliﬁer becomes saturated
before reaching that point. The IP3 is obtained by linear interpolation of small signal
outputs for fundamental and third-order inter-modulation components. A graphical
view of these parameters is shown in Figure 3.4.

output phase of a power ampliﬁer also changes as a function of input signal level.
Figure 3.5 shows the output power and phase of a 60 GHz SiGe power ampliﬁer as
a function of input power [7]. It is clear that both output power and phase depend
on input signal level and these characteristics can be described by amplitude to
amplitude (AM/AM) and amplitude to phase (AM/PM) effects.
If these AM/AM and AM/PM effects are connected not only with the current input
signal but also with the previous one, the nonlinear distortion of a power ampliﬁer
is also affected by memory effects. These are attributed to high temperature, rapid
thermal variation and biasing ﬂuctuation, mainly occurring in high-power (several-
watt-level) ampliﬁers used in satellite communications and in base stations for
cellular communications.
In 60 GHz wireless systems of interest in this book, memory effects can be
neglected since transmitter emission power is limited typically to 10 dBm in most
countries as described in Section 1.4 to support indoor wireless LAN and wireless
PAN applications. Therefore, a power ampliﬁer can be modeled as a memoryless
system in indoor 60 GHz wireless systems. Assuming that the input signal to a
power ampliﬁer is x(t) = A(t) cos[ωf t + θ(t)], the output signals characterized by
AM/AM and AM/PM effects can be expressed as
y(t) = G[A(t)] cos

ωf t + θ(t) + φ[A(t)]

,
(3.5)
where G[A(t)] and ϕ[A(t)] are the AM/AM and AM/PM effects of a power ampli-
ﬁer, respectively.

Several behavioral models have been reported in the literature to describe the
nonlinearity of power ampliﬁers. The Saleh model was originally proposed for
traveling-wave tube (TWT) ampliﬁers commonly used in satellite communications
[8]. It is composed of two equations describing AM/AM and AM/PM effects,
expressed respectively as
G[A(t)] =
αG|A(t)|
1 + βG|A(t)|2
(3.6)
and
ϕ[A(t)] =
αϕ|A(t)|2
1 + βϕ|A(t)|2 ,
(3.7)
where αG, βG, αϕ, and βϕ are real number coefﬁcients. The Saleh model has been
widely used in the design of power ampliﬁer linearization techniques and reference
models for proposal evaluation in IEEE standards societies. However, it does not ﬁt
well with solid-state power ampliﬁers such as GaAs FET and SiGe HBT ampliﬁers
of interest in 60 GHz wireless systems because this model becomes inaccurate in the
saturation regions of such ampliﬁers. Figure 3.6 shows the comparison between
the measurement data and the ﬁtted Saleh model for 60 GHz SiGe ampliﬁers. While
the Saleh model ﬁts very well at low input voltages, the deviation becomes signif-
icant at higher input voltages that are close to the saturation of the ampliﬁer.

Another model, the Rapp model, is better suited to solid-state power ampliﬁers
[9]. It gives a simple and intuitive equation made up of ampliﬁer small signal gain,
G, saturation voltage, Vsat and a smoothing factor, p, which is given by
G[A(t)] =
G|A(t)|
(1 + (G|A(t)|/Vsat)2p)1/2p
(3.8)
for the AM/AM effect. The Rapp model only considers the AM/AM effect and
assumes that the AM/PM effect is negligible in solid-state power ampliﬁers.
However, in some cases, the AM/PM effect cannot be completely neglected and
should be included to accurately evaluate system performance. In order to take the
AM/PM effect into account, a modiﬁed Rapp model was developed in [10]. The
AM/AM effect of the modiﬁed Rapp model is the same as in Equation (3.8) while
the AM/PM effect is given by
φ[A(t)] =
α|A(t)|q
1 + (|A(t)|/β)q ,
(3.9)
where α, β and q are ﬁtting parameters. Figure 3.7 shows the measurement results
and the ﬁtted modiﬁed Rapp model for a 60 GHz SiGe power ampliﬁer. It can
clearly be seen that the modiﬁed Rapp model ﬁts the measured data well and thus
accurately characterizes the nonlinear behaviors of 60 GHz power ampliﬁers.

3.2.4
Output Backoff Versus Peak-to-Average Power Ratio
As seen in Figure 3.5, nonlinear distortion strongly depends on the operation point
of a power ampliﬁer. By decreasing the output power of a given power ampli-
ﬁer, the power ampliﬁer can deliver more linear output at the expense of less
power efﬁciency. Within the range of operation points where linearity given by
a power ampliﬁer meets the requirements, it is maximized for higher power efﬁ-
ciency directly, resulting in low power consumption. To characterize this, output
backoff (OBO) from the output saturation point is usually introduced, which can
be expressed as
OBO = 10 log10(Pout/Psat)
(3.10)
where Pout is the average output power emitted from a power ampliﬁer and Psat is
the saturation output power. The OBO is used to quantify how much output power
a power ampliﬁer provides in comparison to maximum achievable power.
The requirements for OBO are mainly determined by input signals that pass
through an ampliﬁer. The peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which is deﬁned as
the power ratio of peak power to average power in the time domain, is commonly
used to characterize the dynamic range of input signals. Figure 3.8(a) gives one

example of the PAPR for Gbps orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
signals in 60 GHz wireless systems. It can be seen that the PAPR signiﬁcantly
varies with input signal samples. Figure 3.8(b) shows the complementary cumulative
distribution function (CCDF) of an OFDM signal PAPR. The CCDF of the PAPR is
deﬁned as the probability that a given PAPR is larger than a threshold PAPR value
in the time domain.
Larger OBO is indispensable for higher PAPR input signals. However, this
imposes lower power efﬁciency and increases implementation costs. In addition,
larger OBO also increases the requirements of data converters, so that large peak
signals can be precisely interpreted between analog and digital domains.
3.2.5
Impact of Nonlinear Power Ampliﬁer
For a given input signal with a speciﬁc PAPR value, the OBO of a power ampli-
ﬁer is adjusted to meet the RF spectral mask and error vector magnitude (EVM)
typically deﬁned in many wireless communication standards. The third-order and
higher odd-order inter-modulation induces not only nonlinear distortions in the
band of interest but also causes spectral regrowth in adjacent channels. This out-of-
band nonlinear distortion may seriously interfere with other signals in the adjacent
channels, Therefore, wireless communication standards need to restrict the adja-
cent channel interference (ACI) by deﬁning RF spectral masks. Figure 3.9 shows
the spectral regrowth phenomenon originating in nonlinear power ampliﬁers under
different OBOs. The input signal used in the simulation is based on SC 16-QAM

modulation and the power ampliﬁer used is a 60 GHz SiGe power ampliﬁer as shown
in Figure 3.7. The spectrum of the input signal and the spectral mask deﬁned in
the IEEE 802.15.3c standard are included in the same ﬁgures for comparison [6].
It can clearly be seen that the spectral regrowth in out-of-band regions is below
the spectrum mask when the OBO is 3 dB. However, an OBO of 1 dB does not
fulﬁll the spectral mask requirement deﬁned in IEEE 802.15.3c and thus has to
be increased.
Furthermore, the nonlinear distortion in the band of interest also results in input
signal degradation. The constellations of 16-QAM signals before and after nonlinear
ampliﬁcation under 3 dB and 1 dB OBO are show in Figure 3.10. Higher distortion
is observed in output constellation when less OBO is applied in Figure 3.10(b). It
can also be seen that the outer points appear more or less in a large ring shape,
which arises from the gain saturation effects of a power ampliﬁer. In addition, the
constellations are slightly rotated in the clockwise direction, particularly under the
condition of low OBO (1 dB) as a result of the AM/PM effect observed in Figure 3.5.
The accuracy of the modulated signal after passing through a nonlinear power
ampliﬁer can be characterized by EVM measurement, widely used in IEEE 802.11
and IEEE 802.15. The EVM is deﬁned as the magnitude of the error vector with
respect to the input signal vector,
EV M =

and N is the number of symbols. EVM is strongly connected to the input signal
SNDR, and the inverse EVM is almost equivalent to SNDR, particularly in condi-
tions of moderate or high SNDR. The standards have different EVM requirements
for different modulation levels.
3.3
Phase Noise from Oscillators
3.3.1
Modeling of Phase Noise in Phase-Locked Loops
Phase noise generated by LOs has been regarded as another inevitable source of RF
impairment. In 60 GHz wireless systems, such RF impairment is more serious since
the phase noise of an oscillator increases as oscillation frequency increases. More-
over, silicon-based integration of 60 GHz transceivers makes it more challenging
to design low phase-noise oscillators due to the lack of high quality-factor passive
components mainly due to lossy silicon substrate. For these reasons, much of the
work on 60 GHz has focused on the design methodology of 60 GHz PLLs as well
as optimization of baseband schemes to make the system less susceptible to phase
noise. In order to take into account phase noise in PLLs, the analysis and modeling
of a generic PLL are presented in this section.
A simpliﬁed diagram of a PLL is shown in Figure 3.11. It consists of a reference
crystal oscillator, a phase/frequency detector (PFD), a charge pump (CP), a low-pass
ﬁlter (LPF), a VCO and a programmable divider. In a PLL, the VCO output phase
is divided by N and compared with a reference phase in the PFD. A charge pump
provides current proportional to the phase error. It is then ﬁltered by an LPF and
applied to the control port of a VCO. Suppose that the output voltage of a PLL is
Vout(t) = V0 cos[ω0t + φout(t)],
(3.12)
where V0 is the amplitude, f0 = ω0/2π is the oscillation frequency, and φout(t)
is the excess phase. All components in a PLL basically contribute to the overall

system phase noise [12]; however, a reference clock (with buffer) and a VCO are
the most dominant sources of PLL phase noise. The transfer characteristics of these
phase-noise sources to output phase noise are investigated with the following system
models [12, 13].
Figure 3.12 shows the linearized model of a PLL, where the ICP/2π [A/rad] is
the PFD/CP gain with charge pump current ICP, F(s) is the loop ﬁlter transfer
function, KVCO/s is the VCO gain with the frequency factor of s, and N is the
divider ratio of a PLL. The value KVCO = dω/dVctrl refers to the angular frequency
in rad/s/V. With this PLL model, the closed-loop transfer function of a PLL can be
described as

The ﬁrst dominant noise source is a reference oscillator. The reference oscillator
phase noise as a function of frequency offset (f ) can be modeled as
Sref (f ) = Sref (f )(f )2
f 2
+ Sref,f loor,
(3.18)
where Sref (f ) is the phase noise at a certain frequency offset, f , in the
−20 dB/decade region of the spectrum and Sref,f loor is the noise ﬂoor of the
reference. Assuming no noise contribution from VCO in Figure 3.12, the transfer
function from a reference phase to a PLL output phase is given by
φout
ref
φref
=
H0
1 + H0/N ,
(3.19)
where φout
ref is the PLL output phase from reference phase φref , H0 is the for-
ward transfer function described in (14) and N is the divider ratio. Equation (3.19)
indicates a low-pass ﬁlter function given by a PLL, therefore the reference noise
spectrum at PLL output is given by
Sout
ref = Sref N2|HLPF|2,
(3.20)
in which
HLPF =
H0/N
1 + H0/N .
(3.21)
Analogous to Equation (3.18), the phase noise of a free-running VCO, which is
the other dominant noise source in PLL, is given by
Svco(f ) = Svco(f )(f )2
f 2
+ Svco,f loor,
(3.22)
where Svco(f ) is the phase noise at a certain frequency offset, f , in the
−20 dB/decade region of the spectrum (typically 1 MHz for VCO) and Svco,f loor is

the noise ﬂoor of the reference. Note that ﬂicker noise is disregarded in Equation
(3.22) because we only focus on applications in which the loop bandwidth is larger
than the 1/f 3 corner frequency of the VCO. Moreover, this ﬂicker noise in the
VCO is effectively suppressed by the PLL. The phase-noise contribution from the
VCO to PLL output is clearly different from that of a reference clock. The transfer
function from VCO output phase is given by
φout
vco
φvco
=
1
1 + H0/N .
(3.23)
Thus, the VCO noise spectrum at the PLL output is given by
Sout
vco = Svco|1 −HLPF|2,
(3.24)
where HLPF is the low-pass ﬁlter function as described in Equation (3.21). In con-
trast to a reference clock noise, a VCO noise is high-pass ﬁltered by a PLL.
The total phase-noise spectrum of a PLL is the summation of noise spectra from
individual components since they are totally uncorrelated. Figure 3.14 shows the
simulated phase-noise contributions from two major sources, reference oscillator
and VCO, at a PLL output using the aforementioned analysis. The total phase noise
at PLL output is also included for comparison purpose. It is clear that the reference
oscillator is the dominant noise source at low-frequency offsets. As the frequency
offset increases, the contribution from VCO becomes more dominant.

Note that this phase-noise spectral density can be minimized by optimum design
of a PLL loop ﬁlter as shown in Equations (3.12)–(3.24). The optimum PLL band-
width is a result of a tradeoff between the low-pass ﬁltered reference noise and the
VCO noise which is high-pass ﬁltered by a PLL operation.
3.3.2
Behavioral Modeling for Phase Noise in Phase-Locked Loops
Given the phase-noise spectrum in Figure 3.14, the reference noise contribution at
low frequency offset can be reasonably neglected for 60 GHz system simulation.
The main reason for this is that the reference noise dominates low-frequency phase
noise that does not affect system performance of high-rate SC systems, and even
OFDM systems supported by common phase-error correction. In addition, the phase
noise of reference is typically much lower than that of the VCO by many orders of
magnitude. Consequently, the PLL output phase noise can be simply modeled as
the high-pass ﬁltered VCO phase noise [10], which yields a simple one-pole and
one-zero behavioral model given by
PSD(f ) = K · [1 + (f/fz)2]
[1 + (f/fp)2],
(3.25)
where K is the low frequency phase noise below the loop-ﬁlter bandwidth of the
PLL, fp is the pole frequency (i.e. the cutoff frequency of the high-pass ﬁlter
given by the PLL) and fz is the zero frequency determined by the noise ﬂoor
of the VCO. With the phase-noise power spectral density model as described in

Quantization Noise in Data Converters
In modern digital communication systems, received analog baseband signals are
not directly used to get information but converted to the digital domain and then
processed digitally because digital signal processing confers economic as well as
performance advantages. The conversion is performed by an ADC. However, ADC
operation also leads to additional noise and distortion due to the ﬁnite number of
bits and clipping in an ADC. The design of an ADC with both a larger number of
bits (more than 8) and high sampling rate (in excess of 3 Gsps) remains a challenge.
This is one of the serious bottlenecks for commercial use of multi-gigabit 60 GHz

ADCs is provided.
Suppose that N is the number of bits in the ADC and Vref is the maximum
reference voltage swing limited by ADC clipping. Figure 3.17 shows quantized

(3.31)
If the input signal is ideal sinusoidal, giving a PAPR of 2, this equation becomes
6.02N + 1.76[dB], which is known as the maximum SQNR of an ideal ADC.
Higher PAPR results in lower SQNR, therefore it is necessary to have a larger
number of bits in the case of a higher PAPR input signal in order to avoid SQNR
degradation. This analysis also implies that 6 dB SNQR improvement is obtained
by an additional bit of resolution in an ADC. The ADC requirements in terms of
number of bits and clipping level are determined by SNR requirements given by the
input signals. Figure 3.18 shows the output SNR after ADCs with different number
of bits. The simulation was done with SC 16-QAM transmission through 60 GHz
line-of-sight (LOS) ofﬁce channel, CM3 (See Chapter 2). At low input SNR, the
total output noise is largely dominated by channel noise and almost independent
of the number of bits in an ADC. On the other hand, in the case of high input
SNR, the output SNR is severely limited by quantization noise and improves with

needed to support SC 16-QAM.
3.4.2
I/Q Mismatch
I/Q mismatch is deﬁned as the imbalances and offsets between the I and Q branches
in quadrature modulators/demodulators as shown in Figure 3.1. I/Q mismatch orig-
inates mainly in the limited layout tolerance of active and passive elements in RF
transceivers. This problem is particularly serious in a direct-conversion transceiver
because its quadrature modulation/demodulation frequency is much higher than
that of a super-heterodyne transceiver. In designing mobile 60 GHz devices where
a direct-conversion transceiver is most likely used, it is important to include I/Q
mismatch in any system simulation for precise performance evaluation.
The I/Q mismatch can be divided into two parameters: gain mismatch (ε) and
phase mismatch (ϕ). The complex baseband output signals, y(t), suffering from
such I/Q mismatch can be expressed as
y(t) = (cos(φ) + jε · sin(φ)) · x(t) + (ε · cos(φ) −jsin(φ)) · x∗(t),
where x(t) is input signal and x∗is the complex conjugate of x.

Introduction
In early 2000, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allocated the
57–64 GHz millimeter wave (mm-wave) band (also known as the 60 GHz
frequency band) for unlicensed use, the largest contiguous radio spectrum ever
allocated.1 An equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) as large as 10 watts
is allowed within the band. The availability of this large frequency band with
relatively loose power limitations, combined with recent advances in 60 GHz
CMOS technologies, makes it attractive to support gigabit per second (Gbps)
wireless applications, such as uncompressed high-deﬁnition video streaming, large
ﬁle transfers, wireless gigabit Ethernet, and wireless monitors [4].
Standardization in 60 GHz wireless is under active development. The completed
WirelessHD 1.0 speciﬁcation is an early effort in standardizing the wireless HDMI
interface, especially for consumer electronics. The IEEE 802.15.3c task group com-
pleted its speciﬁcations on 60GHz for a personal area network. In the meantime,
the newly formed IEEE 802.11ad task group has also started its development of
60 GHz wireless. When completed, the IEEE 802.11ad speciﬁcations should be

able to support multi-Gbps throughput while at the same time being well integrated
within the IEEE 802.11 family. 60 GHz wireless communications have also been
actively studied for vehicular applications [5, 6].
4.2
60 GHz Channel Characteristics
To ﬁnd good solutions for Gbps communications over 60 GHz, it is necessary to
have a clear understanding of the underlying channel. In this section we summarize
several key characteristics of the 60 GHz channel. It is also understood that the major
use cases are indoor applications for consumer electronics, such as uncompressed
high-deﬁnition video streaming, and large ﬁle transfer to/from a kiosk.
Channel measurements in 60 GHz show severe signal attenuation for common
building materials. For example, a signal attenuation of over 20 dB is observed for a
painted board, which means that signal penetration through walls would be difﬁcult.
It is thus expected that 60 GHz wireless communication for consumer electronics
devices would be limited to in-room applications. Multi-room radio coverage is a
problem for 60 GHz wireless that is yet to be solved. However, this brings enhanced
security and decreased interference from undesirable sources.
4.2.1
Path Loss and Oxygen Absorption
In the following, we focus on 60 GHz channels within a room. One of the major
challenges for mm-wave Gbps communications is the poor link budget, as radio
signal propagation in the mm-wave frequency band experiences signiﬁcant path loss
and other degradation.
To see this, we ﬁrst look at the Friis free space propagation formula,
PR = PT GT GR
λ2
16π2R2 ,
(4.1)
where λ is the carrier wavelength, R is the distance between transmitter and receiver,
GT , GR are the transmitter and receiver antenna gains respectively, and PT , PR
are the transmitted and received power respectively. Clearly, the larger the carrier
frequency, the smaller the carrier wavelength, and the lesser the received power.
Compared with signal propagation in 2.4 GHz, the path loss in 60 GHz is thus at
least 20–30 dB worse.
The 60 GHz mm-wave frequency band happens to be in an oxygen absorption
band, which means that transmitted electromagnetic energy is quickly absorbed by
oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. For 60 GHz wireless with a wavelength of
5 mm, a clear peak in attenuation can be observed due to the presence of oxygen.
On top of the already severe path loss, oxygen absorption would further reduce the
received signal power in 60 GHz wireless.

4.2.2
Multipath Fading
Most current commercial wireless communications operate with a carrier frequency
smaller than 60 GHz. For example, Wi-Fi uses 2.4/5 GHz unlicensed band, the cel-
lular system uses the 850/950 MHz and 1.8/1.9/2.1 GHz bands, and WiMAX uses
the 2.3/2.5/3.5 GHz band, with carrier wavelength ranging from 8.5 to 35 cm. For
those frequency bands, it is well known that the wireless channel undergoes mul-
tipath fading largely because of the scattering effect, which is the electromagnetic
wave dispersion by smaller objects relative to the wavelength. Normally scattering
arises due to roughness of the surface, or foliage for example.
Things change in 60 GHz, with its a much smaller wavelength of 5 mm. Radio
reﬂection, which happens from objects that are smooth, planar and larger compared
to the wavelength, instead becomes the dominant effect. This has been veriﬁed
in [7], where preliminary experiments in conference room and cubicle environ-
ments show that the main propagation mechanisms for 60 GHz indoor wireless are
line-of-sight (LOS), ﬁrst- and second-order reﬂections. For indoor applications, the
multipath delay spread is still signiﬁcant due to relatively short reﬂection paths.
On the other hand, with the carrier wavelength as short as 5 mm, it becomes
possible to integrate a large number of antenna elements on the whole package
for both transmitter and receiver. A linear or planar antenna array may be used.
An example of 36-element planar antenna array is shown in Figure 4.1, where the
antenna elements are arranged uniformly on a rectangular grid.
With the availability of multiple antennas at both transmitter and receiver, multi-
input multi-output (MIMO) transceivers (e.g. spatial multiplexing and/or space-time
codes and/or beamforming) may be used to boost the overall channel capacity [8]. It
has been reported in [9] that for 60 GHz indoor communications, a medium angular
spread from 0.3 to 0.8 (with 0 being the smallest possible spread and 1 being
the largest possible spread) can be observed, suggesting that space-time MIMO
processing could be useful.

a large number of antenna elements can be placed in a reasonably sized area.

60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
It is thus expected that 60 GHz wireless may not be able to take advantage of
very high-order MIMO. Instead, lower-order MIMO techniques with one or two
layers would be more appropriate for 60 GHz wireless.
Typical 60 GHz usage scenarios, such as wireless video streaming, are indoor
and have little or null user mobility. In this case, the wireless channel can be
assumed to be quasi-static. For this reason, closed-loop MIMO techniques such as
beamforming would be preferable over the open-loop alternatives such as spatial
multiplexing and/or transmit diversity.
Digital closed-loop beamforming has been used in wireless local area networks
such as IEEE 802.11n, where the beamforming coefﬁcients are applied in the digital
domain (before the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) at the transmitter and after
the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) at the receiver). Multiple radio frequency(RF)
chains are needed though, increasing the overall cost. This is especially severe for
60 GHz wireless, where the RF cost is notoriously high. For this reason, most current
60 GHz practice uses one-dimensional (single-stream) transmit/receive beamform-
ing. When one-dimensional beamforming is used, the receive combining operation
may be implemented either in the digital domain after the ADC or in the analog
domain before the ADC (see Figure 4.2). Since only one ADC is required for ana-
log beamforming compared with multiple ADCs required for digital beamforming,
analog receive beamforming is usually the choice for 60 GHz wireless.
An important beneﬁt of using antenna array beamforming on the transmitter side
is that requirements on 60 GHz power ampliﬁers (PAs) can be relaxed. It is reported

[10] that a gain less than 12 dB is achievable for 60 GHz CMOS PAs, which is very
limited. With transmitter-side antenna array beamforming, it is possible to conﬁgure
the array such that each phase shifter branch is supplied by a separate PA. The total
transmit power can thus be boosted by usage of multiple (relatively) low-gain PAs.
This simpliﬁes PA design, which is very challenging at 60 GHz, and thus allows the
more efﬁcient use of PAs in the linear region without the need to exercise power
backoff. Additional information on output power backoff and issues related to PAs
can be found in Chapter 3 (see also Figure 4.3), and Section 6.3.2 discusses 60GHz
PA implementation in silicon.
An additional beneﬁt of antenna array beamforming is that the multipath delay
spread can be signiﬁcantly reduced thanks to directional transmission. Transceiver
baseband design can thus be simpliﬁed considerably, allowing simpler equalization
and lower resolution ADCs to be employed.
4.3
Antenna Array Beamforming
As veriﬁed in [7] through experiments in conference room and cubicle environ-
ments, the main propagation mechanisms for 60 GHz indoor wireless are LOS,
ﬁrst- and second-order reﬂections. Hence, for 60 GHz wireless, the non-line-of-
sight (NLOS) paths mainly refer to the reﬂection paths. Since power loss generally
occurs when the reﬂection happens and LOS is the shortest path, the LOS path is
generally the path of choice. However, this is no longer true when the LOS path is
obstructed, for example by human bodies or moving objects.

94
60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
One may choose to use multiple antenna arrays that are separate and far apart
from each other, but physically connected to the same digital baseband chip. For
example, for the 60 GHz wireless receiver inside a large TV set, it is possible to
place two receive antenna arrays, one on the far left and the other on the far right.
If the signal to one antenna array is blocked, the signal to the other antenna array
may still be well received. Such a scheme is possible only for large devices such
as LCD TVs, but would not be feasible for small portable devices. It is important
to note that such implementation incurs additional connection losses due to long
wiring between the antenna connector and the chip.
Another possible solution to the LOS obstruction problem is to use a relay device.
For example, a relay device may be put in the center of the ceiling where the chance
of signal blockage from/to the relay is small. When the LOS between the information
source and sink is blocked, the reﬂective path through the relay device may be used
instead. A relay device may also be used to extend the communication coverage
from within a room to across rooms. For example, a relay device may be placed
in the corridor such that it is “visible” in 60 GHz to two adjacent rooms sharing a
wall. 60 GHz communications between the two rooms are then possible via the relay
device, which would otherwise be impossible due to severe path loss through the
wall. The problem with a relay device is that it may need to be installed manually.
In addition, the relay increases system latency, complexity, and cost, which is not
desirable for uncompressed streaming applications and others.
To solve the NLOS problem in 60 GHz, we need to provide a mechanism that
automatically ﬁnds the best path between the information source and sink, be it the
LOS path or the reﬂective path. We also need to be able to switch to the next best
path if the current best path is lost. A large antenna gain is needed for the selected
path to meet the tight link budget. An antenna array is generally favored due to its
ability to automatically ﬁnd the best path in the changing environments. Normally
two types of antenna arrays can be used: one is the fully adaptive antenna array,
and the other is the switched antenna array.
A fully adaptive antenna array is the most versatile antenna array and, at least in
theory, is able to form an unlimited number of beam patterns. This is achievable by
conﬁguring the phase shifters on all antenna branches with appropriate beamforming
weights (see Figure 4.3). If the channel has changed (LOS being blocked, for
example), a new set of beamforming weights may be conﬁgured to select the current
best path. An iterative antenna training/tracking algorithm is described in Section
4.3.1 for fully adaptive antenna arrays.
A switched antenna array on the other hand assumes a structured codebook. For
example a ﬁnite number of ﬁxed, predeﬁned beam patterns or combining strategies.
By conﬁguring the beam selection, the switched antenna array (equipped with a
proper antenna training/tracking algorithm, of course) is able to automatically ﬁnd
the best path between the information source and sink. If the channel has changed

(LOS being blocked, for example), a new beam pattern may be selected. By taking
advantage of a two-level structured codebook for switched antenna arrays, a tree-
search antenna training algorithm is described in Section 4.3.2.
4.3.1
Training for Adaptive Antenna Arrays
4.3.1.1
System Description
Figure 4.4 illustrates a two-dimensional beamforming and combining system, where
the beamforming and combining operation take place in the analog domain [1]. The
one-dimensional transmit and receive beamforming studied in [2], where only one
RF chain is used with a single transmit beamforming vector and a single receive
combining vector, is simply a special case of Figure 4.4. As it turns out, the antenna
training algorithm therein would also be a degenerate version of the more general
algorithm to be described here. Another motivation for considering a more general
two-dimensional system here is that, as shown in [7, 9], rank-2 transmission is
indeed a viable solution for 60 GHz indoor applications.
In particular, transmit beamforming is achieved via the two independent
beamforming vectors {v1,i}Nt
i=1, {v2,i}Nt
i=1, where v1,i and v2,i represent the ith beam-
forming coefﬁcients on the ith antenna for the ﬁrst and second stream respectively.
On the other hand, receive combining is achieved via the two independent beam-
forming vectors {u1,j}Nr
j=1, {u2,j}Nr
j=1 where u1,j and u2,j represent the jth receive
combining coefﬁcients on the jth antenna for the ﬁrst and second stream respec-
tively. Here Nt and Nr are the number of transmit and receive antennas respectively.

The input–output relationship in Figure 4.4 can be expressed in matrix form as
y = Hx + n,
(4.2)
where H is the Nr × Nt channel matrix between the transmitter and the receiver,
and y, x, n are the Nr × 1, Nt × 1, Nr × 1 received signal vector, transmitted signal
vector and the additive Gaussian noise vector, respectively [1].
For simplicity, we consider a ﬂat fading channel model here.
4.3.1.2
Optimal Solution: Eigenbeamforming
We are interested in acquiring the optimal beamforming coefﬁcients on both the
transmitter and receiver side. Let us now assume that knowledge of H is avail-
able at both transmitter and receiver thanks to slow channel variation. The optimal
transmitter and receiver can then be obtained through singular value decomposition
(SVD) of the channel [11]. In particular, let H = UV′ where U is the Nr × Nr
left singular matrix, V is the Nt × Nt right singular matrix of H, and  is the
Nr × Nt diagonal matrix containing all the singular values associated with H in a
non-increasing order, σ1 > σ2 > · · · > σmin(Nt,Nr). Notice that both U, V are unitary
matrices. In fact,
HH′ = U2U′,
H′H = V2V′,
(4.3)
that is, U is simply the eigenmatrix of HH′, and V is simply the eigenmatrix of
H′H. Let N be the number of RF chains, where N = 1 leads to one-dimensional
beamforming and N = 2 is illustrated in Figure 4.4. It sufﬁces to precode at the
transmitter using
˜V = [v1, · · · , vN],
(4.4)
which is the ﬁrst N columns of V, and combine at the receiver using
˜U = [u1, · · · , uN],
(4.5)
which is the ﬁrst N columns of U.
With linear beamforming operation of ˜V at the transmitter and linear combining
operation of ˜U′ at the receiver side, the MIMO channel H can be diagonalized.
In particular,
z = ˜U′y = ˜U′(Hx + n)
= ˜U′ !
UV′ · ˜Vs + n
"
= ˜s + ˜U′n,
(4.6)

Antenna Array Beamforming in 60 GHz
97
where x = ˜Vs indicates that the original information signal vector s of size N × 1 is
precoded by ˜V, and ˜ is the ﬁrst N × N submatrix of  on the upper-left corner and
is itself a diagonal matrix. Along with the channel diagonalization comes equalizer
simplicity, that is, the multiple streams are not interfering with each other at the
receiver side, thus leading to simple per-stream equalization. Notice that the additive
channel noise is not enhanced thanks to the unitary nature of ˜U [1].
Conventionally, the channel matrix H needs to be estimated to compute the
SVD at the receiver side and furthermore the beamformer (a beamformer is simply
a beamforming vector) coefﬁcients ˜V need to be fed back. This task of direct
estimation and feedback is manageable when the number of antennas is small – for
example, Nt, Nr ≤4 as in IEEE 802.11n systems. However, the computation
complexity and training overhead quickly get out of control when the number
of antennas Nt, Nr grows large. For wireless communications over the 60 GHz
frequency band, we are mostly interested in N ≪Nt, N ≪Nr. In such cases,
the conventional direct-estimate-and-feedback approach has a computational
complexity and training overhead of the order of min2(Nt, Nr) × max(Nt, Nr),
and is neither bandwidth-efﬁcient nor computation-efﬁcient.
4.3.1.3
Power Iteration Principle
Having discussed the inefﬁciency of the conventional direct-estimate-and-feedback
approach, we now introduce the so-called principle of power iteration, which holds
for general matrix H [12] and is useful for our mm-wave beamforming protocol
development. Consider the SVD decomposition of H, which can be rewritten as
H = σ1u1v′
1 + σ2u2v′

(4.7)
where P = min(Nt, Nr). Furthermore, we have

power of H as

An important observation is that, as m increases, σ 2m

The good news is that the convergence in Equations (4.12) and (4.15) is usually

We next present a multi-stage iterative antenna training protocol for acquiring the
antenna beamforming coefﬁcients at both transmitter and receiver, where the number
of stages depends on the number of transmit beamforming (receive combining)
vectors that need to be trained. Without loss of generality, we present a case with
two training stages; the analysis can be extended to an arbitrary number of stages.
In this chapter, we focus on time division duplexing transmissions where the
uplink and downlink channels are mutually reciprocal, that is, the downlink channel
is the Hermitian transpose of the uplink channel:
Hdownlink = H′

Iterative Antenna Training–Stage 1
The purpose of the ﬁrst stage is to acquire the ﬁrst beamforming vectors for transmit-
ter and receiver, i.e. the ﬁrst column in Equations (4.4) and (4.5). In the following,

for notational simplicity, that the convergence in Equation (4.12) has already been
achieved. An arbitrary vector t when multiplied by an even power of H generates
the source beamforming vector v1, if m is large enough and the projection of t on
v1 is not zero, which is true with probability 1. Similarly,

arbitrary vector t when multiplied by an odd power of H generates the destination
beamforming vector u1, if m is large enough.
Given the above results, an efﬁcient way of estimating u1, v1 is via Algorithm 1,
where estimation of u1 and v1 is carried out in an iterative manner until convergence.
In the algorithm description, by using a certain matrix as the receive beamforming
matrix, we mean that the ﬁrst column of this beamforming matrix is used as the
receive beamforming vector in the ﬁrst time slot, the second column in the second
time slot, and so on and so forth. Also, the sign ←indicates the operation of
assigning values.

desired singular vector v1. An illustration of the algorithm is shown in Figure 4.6.
As we can see, the purpose of using INr as the receive beamforming matrix in step
1.1 is to form Equation (4.19) in a straightforward manner. Similarly, the purpose
of using INt as the transmit beamforming matrix in step 2.1 is to form Equation
(4.20) in a straightforward manner.

Iterative Antenna Training–Stage 2
In stage 2, we are interested in acquiring the second beamforming vector for trans-
mitter and receiver, i.e. the second column in Equations (4.4) and (4.5). If we
compare the antenna training process to onion peeling, the iterative method in
stage 1 (2) is like peeling the ﬁrst (second) layer of an onion.

t∅, the projection of arbitrary non-zero vector t onto the null space of v1, generates
the nth source beamforming vector v2 when multiplied by H2m, and generates the
nth destination beamforming vector u2 when multiplied by H2m+1, if m is large
enough.
Given the above results, an efﬁcient way of estimating u2, v2 is via Algorithm 2,
where estimation of u2 and v2 is carried out in an iterative manner until convergence
is achieved. In particular, the iterative method works by repeating step (1) and (2) of
the algorithm. By Equation (4.28), t∅converges to the desired source beamforming
vector v2 while r∅converges to the desired destination beamforming vector u2. An
illustration of the algorithm is given in Figure 4.7.
Unique to the inner stages are the steps of Equations (4.24) and (4.26) in carrying
out the null space projection. We would like to emphasize here the critical role
that the projection operation plays. Suppose we work in stage 2 but the projection
operations Equations (4.24) and (4.26) are skipped. Instead, the vector r in Equation
(4.23) and vector t in Equation (4.25) are directly used in later iterations as in stage
1. It is easy to realize that Equation (4.23) is identical to Equations (4.19) and
(4.25) is identical to Equation (4.20). We conclude that the resultant vectors would
converge again to u1 and v1 which are already obtained in stage 1, but not the
desired output u2, v2 in stage 2. In other words, the interim source beamforming
vector H2mt∅and the interim destination beamforming vector H2m+1t∅shall fall
onto the null space of v1 and null space of u1 respectively.

60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
Despite many indoor channel measurements and modeling efforts for the 5 GHz
WLAN band and 3–10 GHz UWB band, there are very limited channel measure-
ments and modeling available for the 60 GHz frequency band. IEEE 802.15.3c
proposed a generic 60 GHz channel model based on the angular-domain-extended
Saleh–Valenzuela model [13]. We further employ the generic MIMO model with
clustering information [14] to generate the correlated MIMO channel. Particularly
in the simulations, we assume the existence of two clusters, with mean angle of
departure of 30◦and 50◦respectively from the transmitter side, mean angle of
arrival of 30◦and 80◦respectively at the receiver side, angle spread of 30◦for
both clusters, and even power distribution between the two clusters. With these and
input parameters from [13], we are able to generate the correlated channel matrix
for simulation purposes. We further limit ourselves to two-dimensional transmit
precoding and receive combining in a MIMO setup of Nt = 12, Nr = 11 antennas.
Figures 4.8 and 4.9 illustrate the convergence behavior for stage n = 1, 2
respectively. The dashed curve represents respectively the achievable channel gain

against number of iterations for different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios
(corresponding to different noise variances). For comparison purposes, the same
channel realization and noise realization are used for all different SNRs. Although
only one channel/noise realization is used, the same behavior occurs for other
realizations in general.
An important observation is that, for high working SNR, the iterations converge
very quickly to or near the upper bound in a few iterations. Typically, three or four
iterations are enough to capture most of the available gains. However, when the
operating SNR is low, the iteration either converges slowly to far below the upper
bound, or does not converge at all. It is thus important to have the iterative training
method work in a relatively medium to high SNR scenario. Typically pseudo-
random sequence spreading can be used to improve the working SNR.

antenna training method.

4.3.1.6
Tracking for Adaptive Antenna Arrays
In practical systems featuring adaptive antenna arrays, the actual communication
is usually divided into two phases, the antenna training phase where beamforming
weighting coefﬁcients are calculated for both transmitter and receiver to achieve as
large a beamforming gain as possible, and the payload transmission phase where
actual data is communicated using the beamformed high-gain link. It is generally
desirable that the antenna training phase be as short as possible. This is because
short antenna training means lower overhead and thus larger effective throughput,
and long antenna training may violate the underlying assumption that the wireless
channel does not change much from the antenna training phase to the payload
transmission phase.

Antenna Array Beamforming in 60 GHz
107
The above antenna training algorithm can be used to acquire proper beamforming
coefﬁcients to establish a high-gain beamformed link between transmitter and
receiver, without any prior channel/direction information at all. On the other
hand, since the wireless channel is slowly changing, it is thus necessary for the
transmitter and receiver to track the channel changes by changing their beamform-
ing coefﬁcients accordingly. Nevertheless the complete training algorithm would
be an overkill for the tracking purpose. Instead, it is enough to use only one
iteration of the training algorithm for each stage for antenna tracking purposes.
Tracking is typically performed once in a certain number of super-frames.
4.3.2
Training for Switched Antenna Arrays
Section 4.3.1 describes an iterative antenna training/tracking algorithm for fully
adaptive antenna arrays. However, such an iterative algorithm could not applied
if a switched antenna array were used. Nevertheless, by taking advantage of the
codebook structure for switched antenna arrays, a simpler antenna training algorithm
may be developed as follows.
It is assumed that each transmitter/receiver maintains a two-level codebook
structure, which can best be explained through the example in Figure 4.11.
Speciﬁcally, the transmitter (and receiver) maintains two codebooks – a sector
codebook and a beamformer codebook. Remember that for switched antenna
arrays, a codebook is simply a collection of ﬁxed, predeﬁned beamforming vectors
(or combining strategies).
A sector codebook is a collection of coarse sectors, with each sector covering
a broad direction in the space, and all sectors together covering the entire space
of interest. Here the space may represent the space of azimuth angles, elevation
angles or both. As illustrated in Figure 4.11(a), the transmitter-side sector code-
book simply consists of two sectors that jointly cover the entire space of elevation
angles. Similarly, a sector codebook may be maintained at the receiver side as well
(Figure 4.11(b)). Notice that the size of transmitter-side sector codebook is not
necessarily the same as that of receiver-side sector codebook.
A beamformer codebook is a collection of ﬁne beams with each beam covering
a ﬁne direction in the space, and all beams together covering the entire space
of elevation angles. As illustrated in Figure 4.11(c), the transmitter-side beam
codebook consists of six beams that jointly cover the entire space (all possible
elevation angles). Similarly, a beam codebook may be maintained at the receiver
side as well (Figure 4.11(d)).
Without loss of generality, each sector in the sector codebook corresponds to
several beams in the beam codebook. For example, sector 1 corresponds to beams
1–3, meaning that beams 1–3 jointly have similar coverage to sector 1 in the space

Illustration of the two-level codebook structure. In this example, the coarse
sector codebook contains two sectors covering the whole space while the ﬁne beam
codebook contains six beams covering the same space. Furthermore, sector 1 has roughly
the same coverage as beams 1–3 together, while sector 2 has roughly the same coverage
as beams 4–6 together.

Antenna Array Beamforming in 60 GHz

considered. Similarly, beams 4–6 jointly have roughly similar coverage to sector 2.
Notice that here the “coverage” focuses more on which direction covered, rather
than how far it is covered.2 It is implied here that the transmitter switched antenna
array is able to physically form each candidate sector pattern in the transmit sector
codebook, as well as each candidate beam pattern in the transmit beam codebook.
It is also implied that the receiver switched antenna array is able to physically
form each candidate sector pattern in the receive sector codebook, as well as each
candidate beam pattern in the receive beam codebook.
With the two-level codebooks maintained as such for the transmitter and receiver
switched antenna arrays, a tree search antenna training method can be carried out
as in Algorithm 3. In the initialization stage, the transmitter and receiver need to
exchange control signaling so that the two-level transmitter-side codebook informa-
tion (such as number of transmit sectors and number of transmit beams) is known by
the receiver, and similarly the two-level receiver-side codebook information (such
as number of receive sectors and number of receive beams) is known by the trans-
mitter. Notice that this information exchange needs to be carried out reliably and
in every direction. This usually can be done via a relative low-rate physical layer
mode which has almost omnidirectional transmissions.

that the corresponding SNR is the largest.
1.3. Receiver feeds back the transmitter-side sector index i∗.
2In general, a ﬁne beam covers farther than a broad sector with the same given power.

110
60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
2. Fine beam training
2.1. For each possible pair of transmit beam p within the coverage of sector i∗
and receive beam q within the coverage of sector j∗, transmit a training sequence
with beam p and receive with beam q, and record the SNR as ρ(i∗, j ∗, p, q).
2.2. Receiver selects the best pair of transmit beam p∗and receive beam q∗such
that the corresponding SNR is the largest.
2.3. Receiver feeds back the transmitter-side beam index p∗.
3. Transmit beam p∗and receive beam q∗are to be used for data transmissions.
The overall idea is divide and conquer, and is clearly illustrated in Figure 4.12. In
principle, one may perform a brute force search over all possible pairs of transmit
and receive sectors, while the best pair is selected after the ﬁrst-round brute force
search. In the example in Figure 4.12, transmit sector 1 and receive sector 1 are
determined as the best pair of sectors. Brute force search can be terminated if
the required performance such as SNR/SINR between two RX/TX sector pairs
is reached.
The search is then brought to the beam level. Within the coverage of the selected
pair of transmit/receive sectors earlier, a constrained search over all possible pairs
of transmit and receive beams is performed and the best pair is selected after the
second-round constrained search. In the example in Figure 4.12, transmit beam 2
(within the coverage of transmit sector 1) and receive beam 3 (within the coverage
of receive sector 1) are found to be the best pair of beams. Transmit beam 2 and
receive beam 3 are then used to form the high-gain link, over which the beamformed
transmission takes place.
Notice that the tree search algorithm can be easily extended to multiple levels,
if a multilevel codebook structure is assumed by transmitter and receiver. In some
cases, multiple best candidates may be preferred. For example, if the best candidate
(of transmit and receive beam) is blocked, the second best candidate can be used
right off the shelf without a new complete tree search from the bottom. Algorithm 3
can also be easily adapted to ﬁnd a short list of best candidates for such usage.

Channel Access in 60GHz Wireless Networks
High-speed data packets in 60 GHz networks may access the wireless medium in a
conventional time division manner. This can be done either following a reservation
based time division multiple access (TDMA) protocol, or a carrier sensing multiple
access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol, or a hybrid of the two. Notice
that high-speed data transmissions in 60 GHz would typically be directional as a
natural result of transmit beamforming. For this reason, it would be very beneﬁcial

to do spatial division multiple access (SDMA) for data packets, so as to extend
communication range and network coverage, to reduce interference from adjacent
users, to mitigate multipath interference and to reduce network-wide RF pollution.
It is realized that the TDMA protocol may not be the best multiple access protocol
for highly directional transmissions, as pointed out by Cooper and Goldburg [15].
A general rule of thumb is that, the larger the desired beamforming gain, the higher
the directionality. Typically, a total beamforming gain of the order of 20–30 dB is
required to achieve Gbps throughput in the 60 GHz band. Hence, the transmissions
would be highly directional and it is better to use SDMA. In this section, we are
more interested in a multiple access system where STA1 and STA2 access a common
AP at the same time using SDMA, as illustrated in Figure 4.13. In particular, STA1
is equipped with an N-element antenna array, STA2 is equipped with an M-element
antenna array, while the AP is equipped with a K-element antenna array. Each STA
has a single RF chain, while the AP has two RF chains to support simultaneous
transmissions to/from the two STAs. The uplink input–output relationship can be
written as
y1 = u′
1H1v · s1 + n1,
y2 = u′
2H2w · s2 + n2,
(4.29)
where H1 is K × N channel between STA1 and AP, H2 is the K × M channel
between STA2 and AP, u1 = [u11, · · · , uK1]T is the receive beamforming vector
for STA1, u2 = [u12, · · · , uK2]T is the receive beamforming vector for STA2,
v, w are transmit beamforming vectors for STA1 and STA2 respectively, s1, s2 are

information symbols originated from STA1 and STA2 respectively, y1, y2 are
received symbols at the output of the two ADCs respectively, and n1, n2 are
independent additive white Gaussian random variables respectively for each STA.
In determining the beamforming vectors u1, u2, v, w, we face a similar situation
as in the point-to-point systems, that is, the number of available antenna elements
(N, M or K) would be signiﬁcantly larger than the number of RF chains. The
conventional estimate-and-feedback approach would thus be very inefﬁcient, as the
training overhead and complexity are proportional to the number of antenna ele-
ments. We are thus motivated to follow the similar power iteration principle in
acquiring the beamforming coefﬁcients for STAs and the AP. Notice that spread-
ing sequences need to be used in boosting the estimation SNR. Different from the
point-to-point scenario, though, is that there is more than one STA going to transmit
training sequences at the same time. It would thus be beneﬁcial to allocate orthog-
onal (or nearly orthogonal) spreading sequences for each STA during each antenna
training step.
In Algorithm 4, we illustrate the iterative antenna training protocol for a time
division duplexing system, where the uplink and downlink channels are recipro-
cal thanks to calibrated RF. For simplicity, we assume that N ≥M. The iterative
method works by repeating steps (1) and (2) a number of times, where the outcomes
v, w from (4.30), after normalization, are used in the next step (2) and the outcomes
u1, u2 from (4.31), after normalization, are used in the next step (1) [16].

0.1. We start by picking a random pair of orthogonal, non-zero vectors u1⊥u2.
1. STA side antenna training
1.1 Keep sending the same vector u1 for N consecutive time slots from the ﬁrst
RF chain of the AP, while each time slot is spread by a pseudo-random spreading
sequence p1.
1.2 Keep sending the same vector u2 over N time slots from the second RF
chain of the AP, while each time slot is spread by a pseudo-random spreading
sequence p2, that is (near) orthogonal to p1.
1.3 At STA1, use IN as the receive beamforming matrix over N time slots, while
despreading using p1 is performed.
1.4 In the meantime, at STA2, use IM as the receive beamforming matrix over
M time slots, while despreading using p2 is performed. Collecting the received

samples, we arrive at
v ←H′

w ←H′
2(u1 ⊕u2) + noise
(4.30)
where ⊕indicates that u1 is spread by sequence p1 and u2 is spread by sequence
p2 before they are added up in the air, and that corresponding despreading is
employed at each STA. As a result of (4.30), we arrive at interim beamforming
vectors v, w, which will be used immediately in the next step.
2. AP side antenna training
2.1 Keep sending v, after normalization, over K time slots from STA1 while
each time slot is spread by a pseudo-random sequence q1.
2.2 Keep sending w, after normalization, over K time slots from STA2 while each
time slot is spread by a pseudo-random sequence q2, that is (near) orthogonal to
q1.
2.3 For the ﬁrst RF chain of the AP, use IK as the receive beamforming matrix
over K time slots while despreading using q1 is performed.
2.4 For the second RF chain of the AP, use JK as the receive beamforming
matrix over K time slots while despreading using q2 is performed. Here JK is
chosen as an orthogonal matrix such that each column of JK is orthogonal to the
corresponding column of IK.
2.5 Rearranging the collected samples, we arrive at
u1 ←H1v + interference + noise
u2 ←H2w + interference + noise
(4.31)
The interim beamforming vectors u1, u2 are to be used in the step 1 of the next
iteration.
In this section, we have focused on antenna training for high-rate data links where
directional transmission/reception is desired. On the other hand, for control signaling
and/or low-rate data packets, omnidirectional transmission is still required. Omnidi-
rectional transmissions can be achieved in different ways. One possible solution is to
use omnidirectional transmissions for control messages. For example, the 2.4/5 GHz
unlicensed band may be used as an out-of-band control channel in delivering the
control messages for 60 GHz wireless networks. Another possible solution is to use
multiple directional transmissions of the same signal to mimic an omnidirectional
transmission. This is best illustrated in the example of Figure 4.11(c), where the six
directional transmissions together are equivalent to an omnidirectional transmission
with the same range. Notice that the same signals need to be transmitted in the six

different directions to form the omnidirectional equivalent. In such a case, all control
packets that are broadcasting messages in nature need to be transmitted in six repli-
cas over the six different directions. Such packets include request-to-send (RTS),
clear-to-send (CTS) and acknowledged/not acknowledged (ACK/NAK). More dis-
cussion on medium access control design directive transmission can be found in
Chapter 8.

Summary
We have brieﬂy introduced the wireless (indoor) channel characteristics in 60 GHz,
where we face signiﬁcant link budget challenges due to severe path loss, oxygen
absorption and penetration loss. Practical channel measurements found that the main
propagation mechanisms are line-of-sight, ﬁrst- and second-order reﬂection paths,
and that lower-order MIMO techniques would be more appropriate than higher-order
MIMO techniques. Antenna array beamforming is preferred for 60 GHz wireless due
to its large antenna gain, small size and fast electronic steerability, while the latter
is especially meaningful in solving the notorious NLOS obstruction problem in
real time.
To solve the NLOS obstruction problem in real time, the transmit/receive antenna
arrays need to be equipped with a smart logic that automatically detects loss of LOS
path, automatically ﬁnds the best current path (possibly one of the reﬂective paths),
and automatically routes the high-speed data packets via the newly selected path.
For this reason, a fast, efﬁcient antenna array training method becomes one of the
cornerstones in enabling Gbps wireless in 60 GHz.
For fully adaptive antenna arrays, we introduce an iterative antenna training
method in which the transmitter beamforming coefﬁcients and receiver beamform-
ing coefﬁcients are alternatively updated to make the achievable beamforming gain
as large as possible. For switched antenna arrays at both transmitter and receiver,
we introduce a tree search antenna training method where we have taken advantage
of the two-level beamforming codebooks assumed at both transmitter and receiver.
High-speed data links in 60 GHz would typically be directional. Spatial division
multiple access can then be used to allow the wireless spectrum to be utilized more
efﬁciently and is expected to be used in future 60 GHz wireless networks.

Baseband Modulation

Introduction
The choice of baseband modulation scheme for 60 GHz wireless depends on many
factors such as the channel characteristics, deployment scenarios, antenna conﬁgu-
rations, applications, spectrum efﬁciency and circuit limitations.1 In general, three
types of modulations are suitable candidates for 60 GHz communications, namely
minimum shift keying (MSK), single carrier (SC) block transmissions and multi-
carrier (MC) transmissions. A SC would be used to carry the MSK modulated
information symbols as well. In this sense, MSK is itself a SC modulation scheme.
We note that the term “single carrier” modulation in this chapter mainly refers
to the SC block transmissions with general non-constant-envelope constellations,
for example M-QAM. For MC transmissions, we focus on orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) in this book.
MSK is a promising modulation scheme within the family of constant-envelope
modulation. Its constant modulus with no peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)
enables high-efﬁciency operation of transmit power ampliﬁers (PAs) as described
in Section 3.2. This makes MSK a very appealing modulation choice for 60 GHz.
MSK also enjoys a high receive power efﬁciency in terms of power used to receive
each bit. However, MSK suffers from relatively low throughput, especially in high
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regions, which limits its usage to the lower data rate
range of multi-gigabit transmissions.

60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
For high-throughput systems, SC block transmissions (SCBTs) and OFDM mod-
ulations are the preferred choices due to the higher bandwidth efﬁciency, though at
the cost of higher implementation complexity. Conceptually, OFDM transmits mul-
tiple carriers in parallel, with each occupying a narrow band, while SC modulation
transmits a SC modulated at a high symbol rate.
The primary advantage of OFDM modulation relative to its SC counterpart is
its reduced channel equalization complexity in the frequency domain, thanks to
the sub-carrier orthogonality. On the other hand, for SCBT, a tap-delay line (time
domain) equalizer is generally needed to equalize the channel, leading to a much
more complicated receiver than that for OFDM transmissions [1]. The complexity
of the time-domain equalizer becomes more critical in the case of Gbps high-speed
transmission. In order to overcome this problem, SCBT with frequency-domain
equalization (SC-FDE) has been proposed in [2–4] and the references therein.
Figure 5.1 shows system diagrams for OFDM and SC-FDE, which share highly
similar system operations. For OFDM, fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse
FFT operations reside in the receiver and transmitter, respectively, and the linear
MMSE channel equalization is applied after FFT operation. On the other hand,
for SC-FDE, both inverse FFT and FFT operations are carried out at the receiver
side and the linear MMSE channel equalization is applied after FFT. Hence, the
SC-FDE receiver has approximately double the complexity of the OFDM receiver
but a simpler SC-FDE transmitter.
For the same constellation points, SC modulation has lower PAPR value than
OFDM modulation. This places a more stringent requirement on PAs for OFDM
transmission and thus lowers the overall power efﬁciency of the system. Never-
theless, it is realized that for SC to achieve high spectral efﬁciency, the use of
high-order constellations (e.g. 16/64-QAM) is almost inevitable, which leads to a
PAPR increase for SC as well. In such cases, the PAPR difference between OFDM
and SC becomes insigniﬁcant.
OFDM suffers a severe problem with PAPR that decreases the efﬁciency of
the PA. This problem is more critical in 60 GHz than for implementations below
6 GHz. Table 5.1 shows typical parameters for PA implementations below 6 GHz
and at 60 GHz [5]. Additional information on 60GHz PA performance is presented
in Table 6.5.
For operation below <6 GHz, the values for P1 dB and Psat are very close, indi-
cating that the PA operates near the maximum power limit within the linear region.
Hence, no or minimal PA output backoff is required. In contrast, the 60 GHz PA
operates in a power-limited regime in order to maintain linearity. This requires large
output backoff in case of OFDM modulation with high constellation points.
The performance of a modulation scheme also depends on the error control
schemes such as error correction code itself and interleaving depth. In particular,
uncoded OFDM modulation over wireless multi-path channels would suffer from

diversity loss. Thus OFDM modulation has to be accompanied by strong error
control coding in most cases. In general, an SC system is marginally preferable
when the code rate is high (weak error correction capability) while the OFDM
system is marginally preferable when the code rate is low (strong error correction
capability) [6].
Deployment scenarios and channel characteristics have strong inﬂuence on the
choice of modulation. If a system is to be deployed mainly in line-of-sight (LOS)
scenarios with small delay spread, SC is a more cost-effective solution. In contrast,
in non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios, OFDM offers a better solution in mitigating the
longer delay spread of the channel.
In summary, both OFDM and SC-FDE are strong candidates for 60 GHz commu-
nications targeting multiple-Gbps throughput. The choice between the two requires
a careful tradeoff among various factors that include but are not limited to size of
the constellation, strength of the error control coding, and equalization scheme. On
the other hand, MSK is an economic modulation scheme for portable devices, and
is a good choice for “point-and-shoot” applications. Table 5.2 summarizes the key
comparisons among those schemes.
As both OFDM and SC are strong candidates for 60 GHz baseband modulation,
we present both baseband technologies in this book. Sections 5.2 and 5.3 are ded-
icated to OFDM modulation (written by Pengfei Xia), while Sections 5.4 and 5.5
are dedicated to SC modulation (written by Andr´e Bourdoux).

two-dimensional constellation, for example M-QAM or M-PSK. Let fn be the car-
rier frequency for the nth carrier. The transmitted time-domain waveform can then
be written as
x(t) =
N−1

n=0
Xnej2πfnt.
(5.1)
A digital sampled version of the time-domain waveform is nothing more than
x(mTs) =
N−1

n=0
Xnej2πfnmTs,
(5.2)
where t = mTs are the sampling points and Ts is the sampling period. Suppose
that the N carriers are equally spaced in the frequency domain and that fn = nfo,
n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1. In this case, the time-domain samplings become
x(mTs) =
N−1

n=0
Xnej2πnfomTs.
(5.3)
Furthermore, let fo = 1/NTs be the minimum frequency separation to maintain
sub-carrier orthogonality. The time-domain samples can be written as
x(mTs) =
N−1

n=0
Xnej2πmn/N.
(5.4)
Clearly, the time-domain samples {x(0), x(Ts), . . . , x((N −1)Ts)} are nothing
more than the inverse discrete Fourier transform of the N
data symbols
{X0, X1, . . . , XN−1}, which can be implemented via FFT in a very efﬁcient
manner. Thus, inverse FFT is usually used at the OFDM transmitter. To recover
the N data symbols from the time-domain samples received, it is natural to use
FFT at the OFDM receiver.
For general MC transmissions over frequency selective multi-path fading chan-
nels, inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) arise. To
keep the OFDM system from ISI and ICI, a cyclic preﬁx is usually inserted at the
transmitter and then removed at the receiver. It can be shown that as long as the
cyclic preﬁx length is longer than the channel delay spread, the linear convolution
operation (thanks to the multi-tap channel response) is equivalent to a circular con-
volution operation [1]. A circular convolution of the transmitted waveform and the
multi-tap channel in the time domain translates simply to a direct multiplication
of the transmitted symbols and the channel frequency responses in the frequency
domain. Henceforth, a low-complexity one-tap equalizer is sufﬁcient. This is the
most prominent beneﬁt of OFDM communication systems.

60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
The PAPR is deﬁned as the ratio of the transmitted peak power versus the trans-
mitted average power,
max |x(t)|2
E[|x(t)|2] .
(5.5)
From Equation (5.1), the time-domain waveform x(t) is essentially a summation of
multiple independently modulated sub-carriers. Thus, there are some cases when all
the sub-carriers are added up coherently, which leads to a PAPR as high as N. The
high PAPR is problematic as it degrades the transmit power efﬁciency. To see this,
we look at a generic PA input–output relationship in Figure 5.2 based on the well
known Rapp model [8]. The Rapp model takes only the AM/AM effect into account.
Also illustrated is the maximum input power PI,MAX, the average input power
PI,AVG, the maximum output power PO,MAX and the average output power PO,AVG.
It is noticed that the output power fully saturates at PO,MAX if the input power
exceeds PI,MAX. Thus to avoid saturation, the input power of the power ampliﬁer
has to be set at PI,AVG when a large PAPR signal is experienced. This leads to
power backoff 10 log10(PO,MAX/PO,AVG), which is excessive and undesirable. High
PAPR is one major drawback of OFDM as compared with SC modulation schemes.
Another major drawback of OFDM is its sensitivity to carrier frequency offset
(CFO) and phase noise. Note that the phase noise issue is more pronounced at
60 GHz than at lower frequencies such as 5 GHz.

Although the high PAPR and the CFO sensitivity issues appear to deter the appli-
cation of OFDM, we have seen OFDM technology accepted and used in more and
more standards and applications, such as digital audio broadcasting (DAB), digital
video broadcasting (DVB), wireless LAN IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) and
3GPP LTE. Thus it would be reasonable to argue that those issues are problematic
but not catastrophic, if proper care is taken to address them.
5.2.2
OFDM Design Considerations
Figure 5.3 roughly illustrates the typical time-domain waveforms of an OFDM
system and an SC system, where the symbol period of the former is generally
much larger than that of the latter. Conceptually speaking, timing synchronization
for SC systems is more important because timing synchronization is more critical
to handling ISI when the symbol period is small.
Figure 5.4 roughly illustrates the typical frequency content of an OFDM system
and am SC system, where multiple orthogonal sub-carriers are seen in the former
and only a single sub-carrier is seen in the latter. Differently, we expect more
stringent requirements on frequency synchronization for OFDM systems because
frequency synchronization is critical to maintaining sub-carrier orthogonality and
handling CFO. In particular, bit error rate (BER) sensitivity to the CFO is analyzed
for both OFDM and SC systems in [9], where we may approximate the degradation

where f is the carrier frequency offset, Tsc is the symbol period for SC and Tmc is
the symbol period for OFDM, Es is the average symbol energy and N0 is the noise
variance. Notice that in general Tmc is much larger than Tsc. Thus, OFDM systems
are much (several orders) more sensitive to CFO than SC systems. It is observed
that the performance degradation depends on the SNR ratio in OFDM systems but
not for SC systems.
Also as shown in [9], the performance degradation due to phase noise can be
written approximately as

where β is the oscillator linewidth. Again, OFDM is more sensitive to phase noise
than SC systems.
As we have different requirements and sensitivity for SC and OFDM systems,
the design criteria for OFDM systems are different from those of SC systems. In
the following, we discuss several key design considerations for OFDM systems.

Baseband Modulation
125
• Number of sub-carriers (Ns)
– Increasing Ns lengthens the OFDM symbol, reduces ISI and thus simpliﬁes
equalizer designs.
– However, increasing Ns also increases (frequency) synchronization require-
ments and increases PAPR.
• OFDM symbol period (Ts)
– In general, it is desirable to have Ts ≪Tcoh. This condition ensures that
the entire OFDM symbol period is less than the channel’s coherence time
Tcoh, which is necessary to maintain sub-carrier orthogonality within the
OFDM symbol.
– The OFDM symbol period cannot be too small. As indicated below, OFDM
cyclic preﬁx length needs to be taken into account to keep the transmit power
efﬁciency from being too low.
• OFDM cyclic preﬁx (CP) length Lcp
– CP Length needs to be larger than the channel delay spread to guarantee
ISI-free reception.
– Usually the channel delay spread is described in terms of its root-mean-square
channel delay spread σh. A rule of thumb is to maintain Lcp > 5σh. It is noted
that the transmit/receive ﬁlter responses should be taken into account when
calculating the overall channel delay spread. Furthermore, a part of the guard
interval needs to be reserved for synchronization margins due to imperfect
acquisition time, and clock offset between transmitter and receiver.
– Note that the transmit power is wasted during the CP period. In general, it is
desirable to have the transmit power efﬁciency (Ns + Lcp)/Ns ≤1 dB.
• Sub-carrier bandwidth
– Sub-carrier bandwidth should be small enough such that within each sub-
carrier, the channel can be deemed to be frequency ﬂat.
– On the other hand, the sub-carrier bandwidth should be kept much larger
than the channel Doppler spread fd so that frequency synchronization task
is doable.
As we can see, choice of OFDM system parameters is a tradeoff among various
conﬂicting requirements. Outlined in the following is a simple design routine that
works for most OFDM systems [1].
1. Set cyclic preﬁx length Lcp to be 2–4 times the delay spread.
2. Set OFDM symbol period Ts to be 5–6 times the cyclic preﬁx length.
3. Obtain the OFDM sub-carrier spacing as 1/(Ts −Lcp).
4. Compute the number of sub-carriers required by dividing the system bandwidth
by sub-carrier spacing. Alternatively, compute the number of sub-carriers by
dividing the required data rate by the data rate per sub-carrier. The data rate

Table 5.3 lists design parameters for some popular OFDM systems, including
digital audio broadcasting (DAB), IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.16 WiMAX and
3GPP LTE.
The above design considerations are for general OFDM systems. For 60 GHz
wireless systems based on OFDM, we do face some unique challenges. For example,
phase noise in 60 GHz is excessive and could be as high as −85 dBc/Hz [11],
compared with −110 to −120 dBc/Hz phase noise for general OFDM systems with
carrier frequency below 6 GHz. Thus even more care should be exercised in dealing
with frequency synchronization and tracking.

Case Study: IEEE 802.15.3c Audio Video OFDM
We next use the IEEE 802.15.3c audio video (AV) OFDM physical layer (PHY)
mode [12] as a case study of OFDM modulation in 60 GHz. To support both high-
rate and low-rate AV communications, two sub-modes are implemented. One is
the so-called high-rate PHY (HRP) and the other is the so-called low-rate PHY.
We here discuss the HRP mode only with a reference implementation of the HRP
baseband illustrated in Figure 5.5.
5.3.1
Uncompressed Video Communications
A salient feature of the AV OFDM PHY mode in IEEE 802.15.3c is its capability to
efﬁciently support uncompressed high-deﬁnition AV communications. Essentially,

it is designed to be the wireless high-deﬁnition multimedia interface (HDMI) which
has become a standard interface in modern consumer communications.
A unique characteristic with uncompressed AV communications is that different
bits are not created equal from the user’s point of view. For example, a white pixel
can be represented by an RGB 3-tuple (R : 255, G : 255, B : 255) or in binary
format (R : 111111112, G : 111111112, B : 111111112). Apparently for each color
from a recipient’s point of view, the ﬁrst ‘1’ bit carries the most weight, the bits in
the middle carry decreasing weights, while the last ‘1’ carries the least weight. In
other words, bit error with the ﬁrst bit is most easily noticeable by a viewer, while
bit error with the last bit is least easily noticeable. It is thus reasonable to apply
stronger error protection to the more important bits.
For this reason, the incoming bit streams are split in AV OFDM into two classes
at the very beginning (Figure 5.6). In particular, the incoming bit streams consist of
bit streams 1–8 with bit streams 1–4 known as most signiﬁcant bits (MSBs) and bit
streams 5–8 known as least signiﬁcant bits (LSBs). With bit streams differentiated
as such, different error protection may be applied later. Random bit scrambling is
then performed to avoid long runs of 0 s and 1 s.
5.3.2
Equal and Unequal Error Protection
As mentioned earlier, error control coding is indispensable for OFDM modulated
systems. For MSBs/LSBs in AV OFDM, a concatenated code is used, with the

outer code chosen to be the Reed–Solomon (RS) code, the inner code chosen to
to be the standard convolutional code, and with an outer interleaver in the middle.
Such a code concatenation has seen many applications, for example deep space
communications.
In particular, a (224, 216, t = 4) RS code is used as the outer code, which may
be obtained by shortening a standard (255, 247, t = 4) RS code. The code is able
to correct t = 4 error symbols, with each symbol being an 8-bit element in the
GF(28) Galois ﬁeld whose ﬁeld generator polynomial is given by
gf ield(x) = x8 + x4 + x3 + x2 + 1.
(5.8)
The RS code generator polynomial can be written as
gRS(x) = (x + λ)(x + λ2)(x + λ3)(x + λ4)(x + λ5)(x + λ6)(x + λ7)(x + λ8)
(5.9)
with λ = 0x02.
The rate 1/3 convolutional code is used as the inner code, with constraint length
K = 7, and generator polynomial gX = 1338, gY = 1718, gZ = 1658. A reference
implementation of the encoder is illustrated in Figure 5.7.
At the receiver, the Viterbi decoder needs to decode the bit streams at a through-
put of the order of several Gbps, which is quite a challenge using a single decoder
with the current technology. For this reason, code parallelization is used so that the
total bit streams are encoded separately by a bank of eight convolutional encoders.
At the receiver, the received signal may be decoded separately by a bank of
eight (hard/soft) Viterbi decoders. In the following, the eight parallel convolutional
encoders are labeled A–H, with A–D for MSBs and E–H for LSBs.

As discussed earlier, it is beneﬁcial to apply unequal error protection (UEP) to
video transmissions by applying different error protection to the MSBs and LSBs.
One way of implementing UEP in AV OFDM is by using different coding rates
for MSBs and LSBs. This is made possible by convolutional code puncturing. In
Table 5.4, puncturing pattern ‘1’ means transmitting the bit while puncturing pattern
‘0’ means skipping the corresponding bit. Code rates 1/3, 1/2, 2/3 may be used for
bit streams in the equal error protection (EEP) mode, rates 4/7, 4/5 may be used
for MSBs and LSBs respectively in the UEP mode. In general, MSBs should be
protected by a lower rate code (stronger code) than LSBs.
It is noted that other options remain to implement UEP for MSBs and LSBs in
the physical layer. For example, in an OFDM modulated system, MSBs and LSBs
may be allocated to different sub-carriers and MSB-sub-carriers may be allocated
more power than LSB sub-carriers so that stronger error protection is achieved for
MSBs. Another possibility would be to distribute MSBs and LSBs respectively to
the I branch and Q branch of the signal constellation and have larger constellation
distance over the I branch than the Q branch. Stronger error protection is thus
achieved for MSBs as well.
Overall, the UEP via modulation approach is very ﬂexible to allow different level
of UEP since the I/Q distance ratio can be ﬁnely adjusted. The UEP via power
loading approach (for OFDM/MC modulation systems only) is also ﬂexible since
the power loading across different sub-carriers can be ﬁnely adjusted as well. These

two approaches lead to potentially larger PAPR because of the power imbalance.
On the other hand, the UEP via coding approach has no impact on the system PAPR
and is thus desirable from this perspective.
5.3.3
Bit Interleaving and Multiplexing
The encoded bits from the eight parallel encoders need be multiplexed together
to be mapped onto complex constellations. In AV OFDM, QPSK and 16-QAM
constellations are used. For 16-QAM, every four bits are mapped to a constellation
point – two bits to the I branch and the other two bits to the Q branch. It is noted
that for the two bits allocated to the I branch, one bit is better protected and will
be labeled as the better protected bit (BPB) in the following, while the other bit
will be labeled as the worse protected bit (WPB). The same situation occurs for the
Q branch.
The aim of bit interleaving, after multiplexing, is that the encoded bits from each
of the eight convolutional encoders get a more or less equal chance of being BPBs
and WPBs. If the encoded bits from one particular convolutional encoder all ended
up in the WPB positions, the performance degradation would be non-negligible.
In particular, it would be desirable to have encoded bits from each encoder to

Baseband Modulation
131
alternate in being BPBs and WPBs. In other words, if the current bit from encoder
A is mapped to be a BPB, it would be desirable to have the previous/next bit
from encoder A mapped to be a WPB. In this way, the interleaved bits would be
well distributed to take advantage of the error correction capability provided by the
convolutional codes. Note that the convolutional codes and the Viterbi decoder are
known to handle random errors well, but not bursty errors.
Furthermore, when the encoded and interleaved bits are mapped onto the con-
stellation symbols, it is desirable to have the bits from one encoder mapped onto
multiple different constellation symbols. This would take advantage of the underly-
ing channel diversity when different constellation symbols experience different, and
independent, fading channels. In summary, we have the following design criteria
for designing bit interleavers.
1. Alternate the encoded bits from each encoder (e.g. A1–A7 for encoder A) to be
BPBs and WPBs.
2. Avoid mapping the encoded bits from the same encoder onto the same constel-
lation symbol.
Bit interleaving in AV OFDM is achieved by a block interleaver of size 48. In the
EEP mode (convolutional code rate 2/3 for each of the eight encoders), it accepts
six encoded bits from each convolutional encoder. In the following we use A1–A6
to represent the six bits from encoder A, and similarly for encoders B–H. The bit
interleaving is done such that the bits are ordered as illustrated in Figure 5.8. In
particular, the bits are ordered from left to right and from top to bottom. For each
column, the four bits are mapped to be BPB in the I branch, WPB in the I branch,
BPB in the Q branch and WPB in the Q branch. It can be veriﬁed that the encoded
bits from each encoder alternate in being BPBs and WPBs.

In the UEP mode (convolutional code rate 4/7 for encoders A–D and 4/5 for
encoders E–H), it accepts seven encoded MSB bits from encoders A–D and ﬁve
encoded LSB bits from encoders E–H. In the following we use A1–A7 to represent
the seven bits from encoder A, and similarly for encoders B–D; E1–E5 to represent
the ﬁve bits from encoder E, and similarly for encoders F–H. The bit interleaving
is done such that the bits are ordered as illustrated in Figure 5.8. In particular, the
bits are ordered from left to right and from top to bottom. For each column,
the four bits are mapped to be BPB in the I branch, WPB in the I branch, BPB in
the Q branch and WPB in the Q branch.
It is noted that for encoder A in the EEP mode, the encoded bits A1–A6 alternate
as BPB, WPB, BPB, WPB, BPB, WPB; in the UEP mode, the encoded bits A1–A7
alternate as BPB, WPB, BPB, WPB, BPB, WPB and BPB. Thus design criterion 1
is met. Furthermore, for encoder A in the EEP mode, the encoded bits A1–A6 are
mapped onto the 1st, 11th, 10th, 9th, 8th, and 6th 16-QAM symbols;2 in the UEP
mode, the encoded bits A1–A7 are mapped onto the 1st, 11th, 10th, 9th, 8th, 6th
and 2nd 16-QAM symbols. Thus design criterion 2 is met.
It is noted that although the bit orderings appear different for the EEP and UEP
modes, they share the same digital logic in implementation. To see this, we enumer-
ate the encoded bits from the eight encoders in the natural order. In particular, for
the EEP mode, bits 0–47 represents the encoded bits A1–A6, B1–B6, . . . , H1–H6
in order. For the UEP mode, bits 0–47 represent the encoded bits A1–A7, . . . ,
D1–D7, E1–E5, . . . , H1–H5 in order. Let x = 0, . . . , 47 be the bit index at the
input of the bit interleaver and y = 0, . . . , 47 be the bit index at the output of the
bit interleaver. It can be shown that for both EEP and UEP mode, the following
relationship between x and y holds for Figures 5.8 and 5.9:

complex data symbols, pilot sub-carriers carry pilot symbols, and DC and null
sub-carriers carry null symbols. The complex symbols are interleaved once again
before the inverse FFT (IFFT) operation by a bit-reversal tone interleaver. The tone
interleaver is intended to scramble the positions of the originally adjacent symbols

134
60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
that regular IFFT operation consists of a bit reversal operation followed by an
FFT butterﬂy operator. Thus, the bit-reversal tone interleaver is able to shufﬂe the
adjacent complex symbols while at the same time reducing the IFFT complexity.
Among the remaining sub-carriers, 16 of them are used as pilot sub-carriers to
facilitate channel estimation. Normally the pilot sub-carriers are equally spaced in
the frequency domain to allow for simple channel estimation and interpolation. It is
noted that the distance between two adjacent pilot sub-carriers needs to be smaller
than the channel coherence bandwidth to allow for accurate channel estimation. A
traveling pilot is used such that positions of the pilot sub-carriers change slowly
and steadily with time. Thanks to the traveling pilot, time-domain and frequency-
domain interpolation may be used to improve the channel estimate quality at the
receiver side.
Null sub-carriers are placed at the two boundaries {−256 : 1 : −178} and {178 :
1 : 255} to prevent signiﬁcant signal leakage into adjacent frequency bands. The
collection of all these sub-carriers is also known as the guard band. Reservation
of this guard band helps reduce the out-of-band emissions and relieves the front-
end ﬁlter requirements in the RF domain. The direct current (DC) sub-carriers
{−1, 0, 1} are also reserved as null sub-carriers to simplify digital-to-analog and
analog-to-digital conversions.
A list of modulation and coding modes is given in Table 5.6 for AV OFDM.
Among them, modes 2 and 4 provide a nominal data throughput of 3.807 Gbps

SC with Frequency-Domain Equalization
This section is concerned with SC transmissions with frequency-domain equaliza-
tion at 60 GHz. As a case study, it describes the SC air interface selected by the
IEEE 802.15.3c standard for wireless communications in the 60 GHz frequency
band. It also provides a detailed description of the signal processing functionality
required to support SC transmission for both time-domain and frequency-domain
processing.
5.4.1
Introduction
SC modulation has been selected as one of the prominent PHY modes for IEEE
802.15.3c because it beneﬁts from several very interesting properties, as shown in
the following.
Low PAPR. The sensitivity of a signal to PA nonlinearity is closely linked to the
characteristics of the signal envelope. Constant-envelope signals such as CPM
and unﬁltered M-PSK signals are the least sensitive. OFDM and pulse-shaped SC
signals are not, however, constant-envelope and may suffer from PA nonlinearity.
Figure 5.10 shows the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF)
of the PAPR for OFDM and SC transmissions [13] and demonstrates that the
PAPR of OFDM transmissions is quite high and is not dependent on the transmit
ﬁlter nor on the constellation size. In contrast, the PAPR of SC transmissions is
lower and does depend on the excess bandwidth of the pulse shaping ﬁlter and
on the constellation. The lower the excess bandwidth, the higher the PAPR is.
Hence, for SC-FDE, the PAPR can be traded off against spectral efﬁciency in a
different manner for each constellation.
Low-complexity equalization. For SC transmissions over multi-path channels, time-
domain equalizers are very complex to implement. The equalizer length depends
on the channel length, which is not known in advance. In the SC case it is possible
to go to the frequency domain in the receiver, perform the low-complexity single-
tap equalization in the frequency domain just as for OFDM and then go back to
the time domain. This implies the use of an FFT and an IFFT at the receiver but
no IFFT is needed at the transmitter. The transmitter just needs to insert a cyclic
preﬁx (see Section 5.5.2).
Possible tradeoffs on equalization complexity and transmission overhead. With SC
transmission, the combinations of TX and RX processing indicated in Table 5.7

are possible. This provides a certain ﬂexibility that can be exploited at run-time
to minimize the power consumption and optimize the throughput according to
the channel conditions.
Easy combination with spreading. When the link budget is not sufﬁcient to ensure
reliable communication, SC modulation can be easily combined with spreading
to improve the SNR at the receiver. In this case, if the physical bandwidth has
to be kept constant, the bit rate must be scaled by the inverse of the spreading
factor.
Range of device classes and common mode. SC modulation can be used with
different kinds of constellations such as BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK and 16-QAM.
Special – though simple – techniques such as π/2-BPSK or GMSK can also be
used to reduce the sensitivity to PA nonlinearity. Different coding schemes can
be used, with varying level of error protection. By designing transceivers for only
a subset of the possible modulation and coding schemes (MCS), it is possible
to deﬁne device classes with different complexity and power consumption. Fur-
thermore, a simple, robust MCS – with very low complexity – can be deﬁned to
ensure compatibility with other devices that use a modulation other than SC.

Case Study: IEEE 802.15.3c SC PHY
The IEEE802.15.3c standard deﬁnes the PHY and MAC for short-range unlicensed
communications, providing high-rate wireless personal area network (PAN) trans-
port for bulk data transfer and multimedia streaming. It deﬁnes three different
PHYs: one SC PHY and two OFDM PHYs. We give a brief summary of the SC
PHY speciﬁcation.3
The available bandwidth at 60 GHz varies over different areas of the world.
The overlap of all frequency allocations covers the range 57–66 GHz. In order
to be compatible with the frequency allocations in most areas, the IEEE802.15.3c
standard has deﬁned its operation in four different bands, as described in Table 5.8.

This channelization is common to the SC and OFDM PHYs, and is also identical to
the channelization in ECMA-387. It should be noted that the start and stop values
in Table 5.8 are nominal values only. The occupied bandwidth in one channel is
restricted by the transmit power spectral density (PSD) mask, which is as illustrated
in Figure 5.11.

Frame Format and Preamble
The PHY frame consists of three parts: the PHY preamble, the frame header and
the payload, as illustrated in Figure 5.12.
The PHY preamble is intended to support receiver processing related to AGC
setting, antenna diversity selection, timing acquisition, frequency offset estimation,
frame synchronization and channel estimation. The synchronization (SYNC) ﬁeld
is used for frame detection and uses a repetition of codes for higher robustness. The
SYNC ﬁeld consists of 14 repetitions of the Golay sequence a128 (see [12]). The start
frame delimiter (SFD) ﬁeld is used to establish frame timing as well as the header
rate, either medium rate (MR) or high rate (HR). The MR header uses an SFD with

[+1 −1 +1 −1] spread by a128 and the HR header uses an SFD with [+1 +1 −1
−1] spread by a128. The channel estimation (CES) ﬁeld, used for channel estimation,
consists of the sequence [b128 b256 a256 b256 a256] where the rightmost sequence,
a256, is ﬁrst in time. The sequences a128, a256 and b256 are speciﬁed in [12].
The frame header is added after the PHY preamble. It conveys information in the
PHY and MAC headers necessary for successfully decoding the frame. The frame
header consists of a base frame header (containing the PHY header and the MAC
header) followed by an optional frame header (containing the MAC sub-header).
Note that the PHY header conveys the information about the MCS used the payload
following the header. So it is essential that the header be received correctly.
The payload ﬁeld is the last component of the frame. It contains the encoded
and modulated information bits and is constructed as shown in Figure 5.13.
The MAC frame body (i.e. the bits from the MAC) are ﬁrst scrambled with bit
sequence generated by means of a 16-stage linear feedback shift register (LFSR)
as described in [12].
The scrambled bits are then encoded by one of the encoders in Table 5.9. Let
K be the number of information bits and N be the length of the codeword. The
forward error correction (FEC) code rate is then r = N/K. Stuff bits are then added
to the end of the encoded MAC frame body if the number of encoded data bits is
not an integer multiple of the length of the data portion in the sub-block. The stuff
bits are set to zero and appended to the MAC frame body before scrambling. At
the receiver, after decoding, the stuff bits are discarded. If spreading is applied, the
encoded bits are spread with a spreading factor (SF) of 2, 4 or 64. For SFs 2 and 4,
two or four consecutive output bits of the length-16 LFSR are used to spread the

Modulation Schemes
The encoded and spread bits are fed to the constellation mapper. Exact locations
of the constellation points are illustrated in Figure 5.14, together with the mapping
rules. Note that the 16-QAM constellation must be scaled by a factor 1/
√
10 to
yield the same average symbol energy as the other constellations.
The modulated symbols from the constellation mapper are split into blocks and
the blocks are split into sub-blocks (Figure 5.15). A block contains 64 sub-blocks
with the exception of the last block. A sub-block has length 512 and is formed by
appending a pilot word to the data. The possible pilot word lengths are 0 and 64.
For pilot word lengths 0 and 64, the length of the data is 512 and 448, respectively.
Even-number blocks use pilot word sequences of type a64. Odd number blocks use
pilot word sequences of type b64.
Furthermore, the output (denoted by ci in Figure 5.15) of an LFSR shall be used
to change the polarity of pilot word from one block to another. The LFSR used
is the same as the length-16 LFSR, but is run at the appropriate rate: one LFSR

well, to ensure that the cyclic extension is also correct at the sub-block boundaries.
The pilot word will be modulated with π/2-BPSK irrespective of the constellation
used for the data. An optional pilot word of length 9 × 128 symbols can be inserted
between blocks to allow the channel to be reacquired.

60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
Each symbol is rotated by a counter-clockwise π/2 sequence according to the
formula:
xn = j nsn,
n = 0, . . . , N −1,
where sn and xn are the symbol value before and after π/2 rotation respectively.
The MCSs supported by the IEEE802.15.3c standard are listed in Table 5.9. The
following key features can be observed:
• The ﬁrst MCS is intended for common mode signaling (CMS), which allows
interoperability with non-SC devices. It is the most robust MCS with lowest rate,
and is not intended for high-rate data transmissions. Rather, it is designed for
control signaling and interoperability among all devices (OFDM/SC PHYs).
• The fourth MCS is called the mandatory PHY rate (MPR) and is deﬁned to meet
the PAR of IEEE802.15.3c, which is required to achieve a bit rate of at least
1 Gbps.
• The CMS and the MPR are the only mandatory MCSs. All other MCSs are
optional.
• π/2 rotation between consecutive symbols is introduced to reduce the PAPR for
BPSK. To simplify the hardware, it is also used with the other constellations.
• π/2 rotation also enables Gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK) modulation
by differentially encoding the bit streams. GMSK is known to have a PAPR of
unity and be insensitive to PA nonlinearity. An analog modulator implementation
is presented in Chapter 6.
• Spreading is foreseen for BPSK modes only because it provides an SNR increase
(at the despreader output) at the cost of a bit-rate decrease. Hence, spreading with
higher rate modulations (QPSK, etc.) would provide modes with similar rates to
other BPSK modes. For example, QPSK with an SF of 4 has the same rate as
BPSK with an SF of 2.
• For all MCSs – except for the ﬁrst one – a pilot word of length 64 can be added.
This enables the frequency-domain equalization (see Section 5.5.2). For MCS 0
(i.e. the CMS), which uses a very high SF of 64, the despreader can partially
compensate for the channel multipath. Hence, this very robust and simple mode
does not require very sophisticated processing. This is important since the CMS
also has to be supported by devices using other PHYs.

SC Transceiver Design and System Aspects
5.5.1
Transmit and Receive Architecture
Several transceiver architectures can be used to transmit and receive complex mod-
ulations. We will concentrate on the receiver architecture, since the dual properties
mostly also apply to the transmitter. As far as the receiver is concerned, the major

Baseband Modulation
143
functions are those of frequency down-conversion, quadrature demodulation, vari-
able gain and sampling.
A ﬁrst classiﬁcation of receivers is super-heterodyne versus direct conversion:
• Super-heterodyne receivers make use of a down-conversion to baseband in at
least two conversions (in other words, they make use of an intermediate frequency
(IF) that is not centered on frequency 0). This usually comes with a tunable local
oscillator that translates the desired RF frequency to a ﬁxed IF frequency, where
a highly selective ﬁlter rejects close-by interfering signals and selects only the
desired channel. Variations of this receiver are the low-IF and sliding IF receiver.
Chapter 6 describes the frequency planning for a sliding-IF 60 GHz system.
• Direct conversion receivers (also called zero-IF or homodyne receivers) use a
local oscillator (LO) frequency centered exactly on the channel of interest. Hence,
the desired channel is translated directly to baseband where the highly selective
ﬁltering can be implemented by means of sharp low-pass ﬁlters.
For this section, we will use the direct conversion architecture as the reference
architecture for our analysis of the baseband processing. This is motivated by the
following:
• It is the simplest architecture and facilitates implementation of 60 GHz
transceivers.
• No highly selective bandpass, wideband IF ﬁlters are necessary.
• Because the bandwidth of the baseband I and Q signals is the half of the RF
bandwidth, the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) can be run at a lower sampling
rate.
• The direct conversion receiver uses analog quadrature generation. Hence, the non-
idealities such as IQ imbalance and DC offset must be tackled. This makes our
analysis also mostly valid for super-heterodyne receivers with analog quadrature
demodulation.
A

receivers
is
analog

demodulation:
• In analog quadrature demodulation, the last down-conversion stage (which is also
the unique down-conversion in direct conversion receivers) translates the channel
spectrum to baseband by means of two analog LO signals in quadrature, yielding
the in-phase and quadrature (I and Q) components of the complex baseband
signal. Two ADCs are then used to digitize the signals, with a sample rate equal
to or greater than the channel bandwidth. This architecture is known to suffer
from IQ imbalance and DC offset.

144
60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
• In digital quadrature demodulation, the desired spectrum is centered on a (usually
low) IF and a single ADC is used to sample the real signal with a sample rate
equal to or greater than twice the channel bandwidth. This is sometimes also
referred to as bandpass sampling or IF sampling. Subsampling is possible in this
case with some restrictions on the value of the sampling rate [14].
Analog quadrature generation is mostly used because it has the lesser ADC
requirements in terms of sampling rate. The digital quadrature generation is dif-
ﬁcult to use for 60 GHz transceivers because it requires a signiﬁcant oversampling
factor (3 or 4). Since analog quadrature generation is generally used in 60 GHz
transceivers, IQ imbalance is usually a problem and ways to estimate and compen-
sate for it are needed.
Figure 5.16 is a block diagram of the direct conversion architecture. In the receive
path, bandpass ﬁlters are used at RF to pre-select a frequency range of interest
(typically a few channels). An LNA provides gain and ﬁxes the noise ﬂoor of

the system. An AGC ampliﬁer brings the signal to a desired level for optimum
analog-to-digital conversion at baseband. After the AGC ampliﬁer, the signal is
split into two equal components and directly down-converted to baseband with two
LO signals in quadrature. The baseband signals are then low-pass ﬁltered for two
purposes: to avoid any aliasing and to reject adjacent channels. The next operation
is analog-to-digital conversion. To meet the Nyquist sampling constraint, the sample
rate FS must be at least twice as high as half the signal bandwidth FBW: FS > FBW.
The operation of the transmit part is the dual of that of the receiver.
Figure 5.17 illustrates the main non-idealities present in direct-conversion
transceivers. When the impact of these non-idealities is too high, they need to
be estimated and compensated by the receiver signal processing. On the transmit
side, we recognize the clipping and quantization of the digital-to-analog converter
(DAC), the transmit IQ imbalance (TX IQ) and phase noise due to the transmit
quadrature mixers and the nonlinear behavior of the transmit PA. On the receive

side, we recognize the receive IQ imbalance (RX IQ), CFO and phase noise due
to the receive quadrature mixers, the clipping, quantization and sample clock
offset (SCO) of the ADC. Without loss of generality, we assume that the CFO
and SCO are due to the receiver, whereby the transmitter clock and LO are taken
as references.

SC with Frequency-Domain Equalization
5.5.2.1
System Model
SC-FDE can be seen as a special case of linearly pre-coded OFDM [16, 17]: if, in
an OFDM system, an FFT matrix is used to linearly pre-code the OFDM transmitted
symbol blocks, it cancels the effect of the IFFT at the transmitter. An IFFT must
then be inserted at the output of the equalizer in the receiver to compensate for
the linear pre-coding with an FFT matrix at the transmitter. The resulting system is
an SC-FDE system. Figure 5.18 shows block diagrams of the OFDM and SC-FDE
systems.

SC-FDE is an interesting alternative approach to OFDM. Both beneﬁt from the
same low-complexity multi-path channel equalization in the frequency domain.
However, they feature different properties when they are implemented in actual
wireless systems. SC-FDE beneﬁts from a lower PAPR than OFDM because no
signal pre-coding with an IFFT is performed at the transmitter. Another difference
is the computational complexity required at the transmitter and receiver. In the case
of OFDM, one FFT or IFFT operator is performed on both sides of the link. In
the case of SC-FDE, no FFT/IFFT operator is performed on the transmit side while
two FFT/IFFT operators are performed on the receive side of the link.
The simpliﬁed block input–output of SC-FDE in discrete time can be expressed
as follows [15]:
ˆd[n] = FHEFRCP(HtTCPd[n] + w[n])
= FHEHf Fd[n] + FHEFRCPw[n]
(5.13)
where d[n] is the Q-vector of time-domain symbols in the nth block, F and FH are
the direct and inverse Q × Q Fourier transform matrices, TCP and RCP are matrices
that, respectively, add and remove the cyclic preﬁx, E is the frequency-domain
equalizer matrix, which is diagonal, Ht is the time-domain channel convolution
matrix, which is a Toeplitz matrix, and Hf is the diagonal frequency-domain channel
matrix equal to FRCPHtTCPFH. The second equality in Equation (5.13) clearly
shows that the SC-FDE system is equivalent to an OFDM system with a linear
FFT pre-coding. It should be noted that the frequency-domain channel matrix Hf
is diagonal because of the insertion and removal of the cyclic preﬁx. Indeed, the
product RCPHtTCP results in a circulant matrix, hence it is diagonalized by Fourier
matrices in the product FRCPHtTCPFH. It is this property that enables the channel
in the frequency domain to be equalized by means of a diagonal matrix E (one
coefﬁcient per sub-carrier).
The Q × Q equalizer matrix E is diagonal with its diagonal elements equal to

since σ 2
w then tends to zero.

5.5.2.2
Cyclic Preﬁx Versus Training Sequence for SC-FDE
Interestingly, it is possible to make a cyclic extension of the block transmission by
inserting a known training sequence (TS) instead of a cyclic preﬁx. Both methods
are illustrated in Figure 5.19. There are some differences between the two methods:
• In the case of the cyclic preﬁx, the CP must be discarded on the receiver side;
an FFT of size N is computed on the remainder of the received block. In the
case of the training sequence, however, the FFT, equalization and IFFT must
be computed on the received block (thus including the TS) and the TS must be
discarded afterwards in the time domain.
• There is a slight throughput advantage for CP because the throughput is propor-
tional to N/(N + NCP) for CP-SC-FDE while it is proportional to (N −NTS)/N
for TS-SC-FDE, which is lower for NCP = NTS. However, this advantage is off-
set by the fact that the TS can be used as pilots whereas, in CP-SC-FDE, pilots
must be inserted in the data part of the block for tracking.
• If pilot symbols are inserted in CP-SC-FDE, it is most advantageous to insert
them in the part of the block that is copied in the CP. In that case, each pilot
symbol is repeated “for free” in the CP.
• The power consumption of the FFT/IFFT is higher for TS than for CP because,
for TS, the FFT/IFFT must run 100% of the time while for CP it must run
100N/(N + NCP) percent of the time.

Digital Baseband Processing
Based on the description of the IEEE 802.15.3c SC PHY layer in Section 5.4.2, a
block diagram of the signal processing in the transmitter is shown in Figure 5.20.
This block diagram assumes that the digital symbol stream is up-sampled by a factor
of 2 and digitally pulse shaped before the DAC. An alternative implementation is to
feed the DAC at the symbol rate and to do the pulse shaping with the analog ﬁlter
following the DAC. This requires a tighter design of the analog ﬁlter but results in
a more economical implementation in terms of hardware and power consumption.
A possible signal processing ﬂow to receive the IEEE802.15.3c PHY bursts trans-
mitted over a multi-path channel is shown in Figure 5.21. Note that this processing
ﬂow can be simpliﬁed in (nearly) LOS channels by opting for time-domain equal-
ization. In this case, the channel estimation is simpler (only one complex coefﬁcient
must be estimated) and the FFT and IFFT may be bypassed.

Burst Detection and Rough Timing/CFO Acquisition
The ﬁrst operation needed to process a burst is to detect the burst and acquire the
timing and CFO information. In fact, the detection process must run continuously,
and must therefore be implemented with a simple algorithm and at low power. The

(PDF) of the detector output when noise only is present is needed and the false
alarm rate must be speciﬁed, so that a threshold can be computed for the detector
[18]. The detection probability can then be computed by means of the PDF of the
detector output when noise and signal are present [15].
The properties of these detection mechanisms vary widely:
• The energy detector is the simplest to implement and is insensitive to CFO.
However, since it does not exploit any knowledge of the received preamble,
it will react to any energy entering the baseband, including interference, and
create false alarms. For this reason, it is not often used alone for burst detection.

60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
Furthermore, the energy detector can only detect timing information (in addition
to the burst detection). Timing information may be provided by searching for the
maximum of the integrated power over a moving window (MW) of length Nd as:
EDMW(n) =
Nd

m=0
ED(n + m),
ˆnED,opt = arg max
n (|EDMW(n)|).
• The autocorrelation-based detector (Equation (5.17)) is moderately simple to
implement. With respect to the energy detector (Equation (5.16)), it requires
an additional delay line of length NS and some circuitry to add the contribution
of sample n and subtract the contribution of sample n −Nd. It is relatively insen-
sitive to (not yet compensated) CFO errors: thanks to the complex conjugation
in the second term, the accumulated values all have the same phase and add
up coherently (except for the noise contributions). Note that the autocorrelation-
based detector relies on the repetition of a sequence in the preamble to work.
At the end of the received preamble, the magnitude of AC(n) stops increasing.
This is used to detect the end of the preamble, hence the timing information is
known. Several detectors have been proposed to locate this peak, but we will use
a max function since Fort et al. [19] suggest it is a good approximation of the
maximum likelihood solution. Thus, the timing offset is estimated as follows:
ˆnAC,opt = arg max
n (|AC(n)|).
Interestingly, the AC provides a simple means to estimate of the CFO as follows:
ˆf =
1
2πNST ∠[AC(ˆnAC,opt)],
where T is the inverse of the symbol rate. This estimator measures the phase
rotation of the received signal over a duration NST . Note that the unambiguous
estimation range of this estimator is equal to the inverse of the period of the
sequence. Speciﬁcally, the unambiguous range is in the interval
 −1
2NST ;
+1
2NST

=
−6.75 MHz; +6.75 MHz.
Practical systems often have to compensate for a 40 ppm CFO, to account for
20 ppm crystal inaccuracy on both the TX and RX sides. At 60 GHz, this 40 ppm
CFO amounts to 2.4 MHz, which is well within the acquisition range.

• The cross-correlation-based detector (Equation (5.18)) is more complex to imple-
ment because it requires Nd complex multiply – sum operations for each incom-
ing sample. The optimum timing is found by looking for the highest peak in the
correlator output:
ˆnXC,opt = arg max
n (|XC(n)|).
Note that, as opposed to the AC output, the XC output is affected by the multi-
path channel. In the ideal case, assuming zero-correlation side-lobes, zero carrier
frequency offset and no noise, the cross-correlator output is equal to the channel
impulse response (in practice, none of these assumptions is correct and only
a distorted channel impulse response is available). Hence, multiple peaks may
be present at the cross-correlator output and some ad-hoc method is needed to
cope with multi-path channels. See [15, 19] for a detailed treatment of this. If a
repetition is present in the preamble, a good strategy is to search for the periodic
peaks in the magnitude of XC(n) and ﬁnd the time index that maximizes the
sum of these peaks. Just as for the autocorrelation, the phase rotation between
the cross-correlation peaks can be used to derive the CFO ˆf .
For both the AC and the XC methods, it is common to normalize the correlator
output by the value of the signal energy to ease the thresholding operation. The
actual threshold must be calculated based on the statistics of the signal under the
“noise only” condition and the “signal + noise” condition. It is important to note that
the auto- and cross-correlation methods each have their own advantages in terms of
performance: the autocorrelator uses a shifted replica of itself as a reference, hence it
is rather insensitive to channel effects but is more sensitive to noise because noise
is also present in the reference. The cross-correlator uses the known transmitted
sequence as a reference, hence is more sensitive to channel distortion but has a
reference waveform free of noise. Figure 5.23 shows the detection performance
of the auto- and cross-correlation in CM15 channels [20]. The ﬁgure shows the
percentage of successful burst detections for different values of Eb/N0 applied on
the SYNC sequence. It can be seen that the cross-correlation performs better for
low values of Eb/N0. With autocorrelation, noise terms are multiplied. Although
the multiplied noise terms are uncorrelated, the variance of their product is equal to
σ 4
n, where σ 2
n is the noise variance of the individual noise terms. For small values of
Eb/N0 the term in σ 4
n starts to dominate, rendering an effective detection impossible
with autocorrelation.
Performance of the CFO estimation based on the cross-correlation is shown in
Figure 5.24. The ﬁgure shows the normalized MSE of the estimated relative CFO
(i.e. the MSE divided by the square of the true relative CFO). The simulation was
done with 1000 realizations and a relative CFO of 40 ppm.

Joint Fine CFO and Channel Estimation Without I/Q Imbalance
Having acquired timing and rough CFO estimation, the next step is to estimate the
channel. If no I/Q imbalance is present in the receiver, the residual CFO must be
estimated together with the channel response based on the received CES sequence.
The CES ﬁeld, used for channel estimation, consists of the sequence [b128 b256
a256 b256 a256], where the leftmost sequence, a256, is ﬁrst in time and where the
ﬁrst transmitted bit is the rightmost bit. For the sake of clarity and to follow a
more conventional notation, in this section we will express this as follows: the CES
consists of the sequence [a256 b256 a256 b256 b128] where the ﬁrst transmitted bit is
the leftmost bit of a256. Since a256 = [b128 a128] and b256 = [−b128 a128], we have
the following properties:
CES = [a256 b256 a256 b256 b128]
= [b128 a128 −b128 a128 b128 a128 −b128 a128 b128]
= [b128 a512 a512]
Hence, the CES sequence consists of the sequence a512 = [a256 b256] = [a128 −b128
a128 b128] repeated twice and preceded by the cyclic preﬁx b128. This is a cyclic
extension of only 128 samples, which is supposed to be long enough for most
60 GHz channels. For notational purposes, we will denote the components of the
received CES sequence by p and q, where p stands for a received a sequence and
q for a received b sequence. Note that the received p and q sequences are equal to
the transmitted a and b sequences after convolution with the channel and addition
of the receiver noise:
p(n) = a(n) ⊗h(n) + na(n)
q(n) = b(n) ⊗h(n) + nb(n)
The correlation of the transmitted CES with a∗
512 shows two length-128 zero-
correlation zones after the main peak (marked in Figure 5.25). Hence, after
convolution with the channel, the channel impulse response can be directly
extracted from both zero-correlation zones and averaged to reduce the impact of
the additive noise by 3 dB. The impact of residual CFO and possible I/Q imbalance
must be compensated before estimating the channel.
A good strategy for carrying out this joint channel and CFO estimation is the
following process on the received CES sequence:
• Discard the cyclic preﬁx q128.
• Compute the autocorrelation of the ﬁrst part of the received CES with the second
part and estimate the residual CFO as follows:
ˆf =
1
2π512T ∠[p512 ⊗p∗
512].

• Correct the second part of the received CES by means of the estimated CFO, i.e.
multiply by exp(−j2π) ˆf kT , where k spans the range from 1 to the length of
the sequence to be compensated.
• For time-domain channel estimation, extract the impulse response by element-
wise averaging of the impulse responses measured in the two zero-correlation
zones.
• For frequency-domain channel estimation, compute the length-512 DFT of the
two element-wise averaged p512 sequences. A length-512 DFT is needed because
the block length used for FDE is 512. In the frequency domain, divide element-
wise the resulting vector by the DFT of the a512 sequence.

Joint Estimation of Fine CFO, Channel and I/Q Imbalance
5.6.3.1
Impact of I/Q Imbalance
When I/Q imbalance is present, the complex received signal at baseband, includ-
ing the received preamble, is distorted. If the receiver I and Q branches do not
have equal gain or are not exactly in quadrature, signal distortion results. These

differences can be represented by different gains (1 + εR and 1 −εR) and different
phases (+φR and −φR), as illustrated in Figure 5.26. The distorted represen-
tation of the signal is then, using εR and φR for the gain and phase imbalances
and assuming no CFO and no noise:
y(t) = αx(t) + βx∗(t),
(5.19)
in which
α = cos(φR) −jεR sin(φR),
(5.20)
β = εR cos(φR) + j sin(φR).
(5.21)
Equation (5.19) reveals that the resulting low-pass signal y(t) consists of the ideal
signal x(t) plus a scaled version of its complex conjugate x∗(t). Because of the
complex conjugation, the positive part of the spectrum of X(f ) interferes with the
negative part of its spectrum and vice versa. Note that for reasonable values of
εR and φR, the magnitude of α is close to one and the magnitude of β is close
to zero.
5.6.3.2
Compensation of I/Q Imbalance
It is easy to show that the knowledge of β/α∗is sufﬁcient to compensate for the
I/Q imbalance. Indeed, we can compensate the received signal y(t) as follows:
ycomp(t) = y(t) −β
α∗y∗(t)
= αx(t) + βx∗(t) −β
α∗(α∗x∗(t) + β∗x(t))
= |α|2 −|β|2
α∗
x(t)
(5.22)

158
60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
We observe that the component with x∗(t) has been completely removed in Equation
(5.22). So, if we estimate β/α∗and compensate for it before the channel estima-
tion, the image interference due to I/Q imbalance is completely removed and the
remaining scaling will be compensated for by the channel estimation/equalization.
Note that the magnitude of this scaling is close to one, so it has insigniﬁcant impact
on the SNR.
5.6.3.3
Estimation of the I/Q Imbalance Parameters
The periodic structure of the preamble can be used to make the estimate of the
CFO and I/Q parameters independent of the channel knowledge. The method intro-
duced here is described in detail in [21]. Although the mathematical treatment of
this method is quite involved, its implementation is fairly straightforward. We will
highlight the main idea of the method here and refer the reader to [21] for the
details. The parameters to estimate are the phase rotation φ between the ﬁrst and
second part of the received preamble and the ratio ¯β = β/α∗.
First, exploiting the repetition in the preamble, the second part y2 of the received
preamble is expressed as a function of the ﬁrst received part y1, affected by CFO
and I/Q imbalance:
y2 = λ(φ, ¯β) y1 + µ(φ, ¯β) y∗
1 + n,
(5.23)
in which the parameters λ(φ, ¯β) and µ(φ, ¯β) are given by
λ(φ, ¯β) := cos φ −j sin φ 1 + | ¯β|2
1 −| ¯β|2 ,
(5.24)
µ(φ, ¯β) := 2 j sin φ
¯β
1 −| ¯β|2 .
(5.25)
Second, the maximum likelihood (ML) function for the parameters to estimate
(CFO, I/Q) is derived:
(φ, ¯β) := log p

where the noise vector n is given by

The variance of the noise vector can be shown to be equal to

(5.29)
which shows that the variance of the noise samples depends on the CFO and I/Q
imbalance.
Third, because solving for the ML estimate by means of this function is not
tractable, a simpliﬁcation is needed. Because the I/Q mismatch parameter ¯β is small
for actual analog front-ends ( ¯β ≪1), we can approximate the likelihood function
by making a second-order approximation. The Equations (5.24), (5.25) and (5.29)
are approximately equal to
λ(φ, ¯β) ≈e−j φ −2 j sin φ | ¯β|2,
(5.30)
µ(φ, ¯β) ≈2 j sin φ ¯β,

σ 2
n(φ, ¯β) ≈2 σ 2

1 + ( 1
2 −4 (sin φ)2) | ¯β|2 .
(5.32)
These expressions are inserted into the likelihood function ((φ, ¯β)), which is
further simpliﬁed by neglecting the terms of order higher than 2.
Fourth, in order to solve for the two parameters to be estimated (φ and β), the
expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate iteratively the CFO
and I/Q imbalance one after each other. The iterative EM algorithm is known to
converge to the joint ML estimate of the parameters [22]. The EM algorithm is
typically used to estimate a set of parameters based on a given observation when
unknown random processes perturb the observation. In our case, the phase φ due
to the CFO is estimated based on the two received vectors (⃗y1 and ⃗y2). The I/Q
imbalance ¯β alters the estimation of φ. The algorithm is initialized by a ﬁrst estimate
of the CFO (φ) identical to the autocorrelation method described earlier. Then the
algorithm iterates between individual estimations of the I/Q parameters ( ¯β) and
CFO (φ) until it converges.
When the I/Q imbalance parameters are very large (εR > 5% and φR > 5◦),
the estimation starts to degrade. A good solution in this case consists of doing
a ﬁrst EM estimation and then compensating the received CES for the estimated
CFO and I/Q. Then, simple independent ML estimates of the CFO and I/Q based

on the received and compensated CES are sufﬁcient. Figure 5.27 shows the per-
formance of the described EM-based I/Q estimation algorithm, averaged over 500
channel realizations. The I/Q parameters were εR = 5% and φR = 5◦. Once the
frequency-domain coefﬁcients H(k) and the noise variance are known, the equal-
izer coefﬁcients can be readily calculated. For the ZF and the MMSE equalizer, the
equalizer coefﬁcients are given by Equations (5.14) and (5.15), respectively.
5.6.3.4
Tracking of CFO and Phase Noise
Because the CFO estimation is not perfect, especially at low SNR, and because
of the presence of phase noise, it is necessary to track the residual CFO and the
phase noise during the reception of a burst. The TS used to cyclically extend the
transmitted blocks can be used for this purpose (Figure 5.28). The operation is
as follows:
• Each block (of length 512 with the TS) is converted to the frequency domain
and equalized.
• The equalized frequency-domain blocks are converted back to the time domain.

• The TS, which occupies the ﬁrst 64 samples of the blocks, is compared against
the ideal TS to derive the phase error.
• The phase error compensation is applied to the data part of the burst (512 −64 =
448 samples).
Figure 5.29 illustrates the behavior of the tracking for 16-QAM at 20 dB SNR,
when the residual CFO is 2 ppm before the tracking loop. The value of residual CFO
for the simulated SNR is rather high and should be much smaller after coarse and
ﬁne CFO estimation. It can be observed that the constellation points after tracking
are perfectly centered on the locations of an ideal 16-QAM constellation.
5.6.4
Time-Domain Equalization, Despreading and Tracking
In LOS and near-LOS channels, it may not be necessary to perform frequency-
domain equalization. Indeed, in such channels, the main tap of the channel impulse
response (obtained by means of the procedure with the matched ﬁlter outlined in
Section 5.6.2) can be used to perform a single-tap time-domain equalization. To
decide between time- and frequency-domain equalization, a criterion based on the

(5.33)
can be used (nmax is the index of the strongest tap).
In time-domain equalization, the processing must be done in a different order to
accommodate the possible despreading. Since the spread chips have been affected
by the π/2 rotation, the π/2 derotation must be applied before the despreading. It
is more economical to perform the time-domain equalizer on the despread chips.
Finally, if no TS was added to the blocks, a decision-directed CFO/phase noise
tracking loop must be used, whereby the outputs of the hard decision are used as
reference to the phase comparator. This whole process is illustrated in Figure 5.30.
In order to assess the impact of PA nonlinearity, we use a modiﬁed Rapp model
taking into account AM-AM and AM-PM conversion as discussed in Chapter 4,
since this is more realistic for microwave and millimeter-wave PAs. The backoff
is expressed relative to the 1 dB compression point, which is the point where the
gain drops by 1 dB with respect to the gain at low power. Coded and uncoded
BER performance for QPSK and 16-QAM are shown in Figures 5.31 and 5.32,
respectively. In both cases, the coded BER were simulated in nearly LOS channels

and with the LDPC(672,504), that is, with a code rate of 3/4. It can be observed
that the effect of nonlinearities is logically more pronounced on 16-QAM. It is
worth noting that QPSK is quite robust and can operate with little or no backoff.
For 16-QAM, a higher backoff of the order of 2–3 dB is necessary.
In order to give an idea of the complexity of the baseband processing for a
SC, we show in Table 5.10 the number of raw operations (i.e. without signiﬁcant
optimization) that must be executed by the digital baseband. The following opera-
tions were taken into account: real multiplications, real additions, 2’s complement,
look-up-table access, comparisons, real divisions, square root. The values are cal-
culated for the case of 16-QAM with TS length 64, frequency-domain equalization.
Some values appear in bold in the table: these are the values exceeding 10 giga-
operation/s, to highlight where the implementer must focus its efforts to reduce
the power consumption of the digital baseband. Clearly, for the acquisition part,
the correlations must be optimized (which is possible for Golay type sequences),
whereas for the payload part, the digital ﬁlter and the FFT/IFFT will require a sig-
niﬁcant optimization effort. Note that the decoder complexity is not shown because
raw numbers are meaningless for decoders that can be heavily optimized (e.g. by
means of approximations, parallelization and stop criteria in the iterations).

60 GHz Radio Implementation
in Silicon
Alberto Valdes-Garcia
6.1
Introduction
In recent years, the design of active and passive mm-wave components in
general – and in the 60 GHz band in particular – has become a center of gravity
for academic and industrial research. Within a period of six years, from the ﬁrst
60 GHz building blocks integrated in silicon introduced in 2004 [1] to today, this
ﬁeld of research has quickly expanded, resulting in multiple examples of fully
integrated radios and phased arrays.
Even though research and engineering activities involving mm-wave frequencies
span almost a century, the recent availability of silicon processes that allow radio
implementation at 60 GHz (90 nm CMOS and 0.13 µm SiGe BiCMOS) is arguably
the single most important factor in fueling 60 GHz standardization and investment
activities. The economic and technical advantages that only silicon integration can
offer are expected to take 60 GHz technology to usage and business volumes com-
parable to those currently enjoyed by Bluetooth and Wi-Fi technologies.
It is therefore relevant to the design of 60 GHz systems to understand the capa-
bilities and limitations that a silicon implementation of the physical layer (PHY)
entails. Rather than discussing 60 GHz circuit design techniques in detail (which
would require several chapters to cover material presented in depth elsewhere [2]),
this chapter presents an overview of the current solutions, techniques and tradeoffs

involved in the implementation of a high-data-rate 60 GHz radio in silicon from the
radio frequency (RF) front-end to the mixed-signal (analog/digital) interface with a
digital baseband chip. The objective of this chapter is to provide system architects,
PHY designers, application development engineers, and other non-circuit-design
experts with the appropriate knowledge and background on the crucial non-digital
section of the PHY to make the right system-level assessments and tradeoffs when
taking a 60 GHz system from theory to practice.
In the sections that follow, the discussion starts with an overview and analysis
of the different silicon technologies available for the implementation of 60 GHz
systems. Given that the link margin of a wireless system is strongly dependent
on the receiver’s noise ﬁgure (NF) and the transmitter’s OP1dB, the performance
of currently existing 60 GHz low-noise ampliﬁer (LNA) and power ampliﬁer (PA)
solutions is next reviewed in detail. Radio architectures are then reviewed, con-
sidering frequency planning as well as implementation tradeoffs for single carrier
(SC) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The current
state of the art in high-speed digital-to-analog converters (DACs), analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs) and modulators as important system components is analyzed
in the context of their application to Gbps systems. Finally, the challenges for the
implementation of commercial mm-wave radios are outlined.
6.2
Overview of Semiconductor Technologies for 60 GHz Radios
In the early 1990s, the cutoff frequencies for silicon transistors (CMOS FETs and
SiGe HBTs) were below 100 GHz and about an order of magnitude smaller than
those achieved by the III-V semiconductor devices which dominated the RF and
mm-wave regime. By 2005, however, both SiGe and CMOS transistors had cut-
off frequencies exceeding 200 GHz. During this period the foundations for RF
integrated circuit design were laid, multiple new design techniques and circuit
topologies were constantly introduced, and the manufacturing of integrated pas-
sive components (RF inductors, capacitors and transmission lines) matured. All of
these factors resulted in a quasi-exponential improvement of RF integrated circuit
performance over time.
In turn, the steep upward slope of this performance trend has created high perfor-
mance expectations for 60 GHz systems. During the course of 60 GHz technology
development, predictions were made regarding potential improvements in circuit
performance with technology scaling. For instance, some postulated that 45 nm tech-
nology could signiﬁcantly enhance output power and power efﬁciency in 60 GHz
PAs as compared to early results achieved in 90 nm technology. Without under-
estimating the innovation capabilities of the wireless engineering community, it is
worth carrying out a “reality-check” on the silicon roadmap to know what to expect
from future developments in silicon technology and the resulting implications for

60 GHz radio implementations. As will be clearly shown by the end of this chapter,
much like projected improvements in modern multi-core microprocessors, a con-
tinuous increase in 60 GHz radio performance will be the result of careful system
engineering rather than the automatic result of technology scaling.
For more than a decade, the International Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS)
[3] has served as the main reference for tracking and projecting the evolution of
the semiconductor industry. The biannual ITRS report and annual ITRS updates
are written by experts from all major semiconductor companies as well as research
institutions and universities. The ITRS outlook for the future considers both known
production plans sustained by present research and development results and perfor-
mance targets driven by the requirements of future applications. Before discussing
the outlook for SiGe and CMOS, it is worth reviewing the deﬁnitions of the metrics
employed to benchmark the RF performance of a given technology node:
Physical Lgate. This refers to the actual minimum gate length that a FET can have in
a given CMOS process. Note that this parameter is different from the technology
node name which is also given in nanometers or micrometers. In the early stages
of RF CMOS, Lgate used to be half of the quoted technology dimension, but this
is no longer the case for modern technologies. For example, Lgate in the 0.35 µm
CMOS node was 0.2 µm, while in a typical 65 nm CMOS node, Lgate is 50 nm.
Supply voltage. For CMOS, this value is speciﬁed to ensure reliability of digital
circuits. It must be considered carefully in the design of CMOS PAs, as will be
discussed in Section 6.3.
BV ceo. In a SiGe process, the maximum collector-emitter voltage is quoted for
HBTs instead of a supply voltage.
Peak f T . The frequency at which the current gain of a transistor (with an AC short
circuit as a load) reaches unity is known as the current-gain cutoff frequency or
fT . This value is relatively independent of the speciﬁc device layout conﬁguration
but depends on the device bias and device size. The peak fT is the highest fT
in a given technology node for an optimum device size and bias conditions.
Peak f MAX. The frequency at which the power gain of a transistor (for power-
matched source and load impedances) reaches unity is known as the power-gain
cutoff frequency. It is strongly dependent on layout conﬁguration.
NF min at 60GHz. The minimum 60 GHz noise ﬁgure that can be obtained for
a device under optimum impedance matching and bias conditions. In practice,
the LNA noise ﬁgure will be at least 1 dB higher than this value since (a) it is
not always possible to implement the optimum source impedance match and (b)
the passive components employed for impedance matching introduce loss which
directly translates into an additional noise ﬁgure.
One of the key advantages of using CMOS technology for a 60 GHz radio is that
it makes a single-chip implementation possible, which is desirable from at least

two perspectives. First, it would reduce the form factor of the complete 60 GHz
solution. Second, the performance of the digital baseband would beneﬁt from the
use of the latest technology node. The implications of future technology scaling
for the radio section are, however, not as straightforward. Table 6.1 presents the
roadmap of CMOS development for the next ﬁve years in terms of RF performance.
By 2014, the minimum gate-length for a CMOS FET is expected to scale down by
about 30% and so the current gain and power cutoff frequencies are expected to
improve by the same amount. This inverse proportional relationship between Lgate
and fT /fMAX has been approximately constant over the last decade. Neverthe-
less, note that according to ITRS, manufacturable solutions to sustain this trend in
transistor speed are not known for Lgate below 27 nm. The main reason for this con-
cern is that at these deeply scaled dimensions and for the extremely high expected
cutoff frequencies (entering the sub-millimeter wave regime starting at 300 GHz),
second-order scaling effects and speciﬁc device layout properties become relevant.
To overcome these limitations through layout and device engineering techniques is
an active topic of research [4].
What are the implications of these scaling trends for circuits operating at 60 GHz?
In general, the availability of devices with higher cutoff frequencies implies that
compared to previous generations, a similar level of performance can be obtained
at a relatively lower bias current. Nevertheless, given the strong dependency of
cutoff frequencies on device geometry, and further that the nominal operating power
supply voltage will remain essentially constant, the expected reduction in power
consumption will be (without signiﬁcant circuit design and/or device innovations)
less than 20%.
It has been demonstrated experimentally that the current density at which the
NF min occurs for deep sub-micrometer CMOS remains essentially constant from
node to node [5]. In addition, as improvements in NF min in the next 5 years are
expected to be marginal, 60 GHz LNA circuits are not expected to experience a
signiﬁcant power reduction with technology scaling. In the realm of PAs, an increas-
ing fMAX results in higher power added efﬁciency (PAE); however, a constant

(slightly decreasing, in fact) maximum supply voltage means that higher output
power levels from 60 GHz CMOS transmitters will come from innovations in
on-chip power combining techniques rather than technology scaling. Section 6.3
discusses the performance trends of LNAs and PAs in more detail.
Table 6.2 presents a similar roadmap for SiGe HBTs. In general, SiGe bipolar
transistors are expected to maintain an advantage of about 1.5 dB in NF min and
0.5 V in allowable voltage swing with respect to CMOS FETs over the next ﬁve
years with a comparable increase in cutoff frequencies.
One of the special characteristics of III-V semiconductors (which dominated mm-
wave applications until recently) is that their complex structure and low-volume
business model allow for the development of different device variants in a given
technology node. For example, a device can be engineered to achieve excellent
noise performance (suitable for a receiver RF front-end) or high output power (for
a transmitter front-end). Table 6.3 shows the performance outlook for two well-
established III-IV semiconductor technologies (GaAs and InP) in comparison to the
silicon-based technologies reviewed above. It can be observed that despite of the
fact that SiGe and CMOS have – and will continue to have – cutoff frequencies
comparable to GaAs and InP, devices built in the latter technologies will continue
to outperform silicon devices in terms of noise and output power performance.
Note further that in the case of III-V based devices, which have been used for
mm-wave applications for several years, manufacturable solutions are known for
the performance expected in 2014.
6.3
60 GHz Front-End Components
As will become evident in Section 6.4, 60 GHz radios can be highly complex
integrated systems, and their overall performance depends on a careful balance of
different component speciﬁcations. Nevertheless, for initial system design and link
budget analysis, the front-end components have the most inﬂuence and hence it is
valuable to examine their expected performance in detail.

6.3.1
60GHz LNAs in SiGe and CMOS
Table 6.4 presents an overview of recently reported mm-wave LNAs in different
silicon technologies. The quoted performance metrics usually correspond to
measurements performed at ambient temperature and 60 GHz frequency. It can
be observed that the transition from 0.13 µm CMOS to 90 nm CMOS offered a
performance advantage, but that the reported results from 65 nm and 90 nm CMOS
are in general comparable, which is in agreement with the trend predicted by
Table 6.1. Another observation that follows from these results is that while the noise
performance of LNAs in 65 nm and 90 nm CMOS approaches that of 13 µm SiGe
BiCMOS, this is frequently achieved at the expense of higher power consumption.
Note that the reported NF performance for different designs is at best 1.5 dB
higher than the NF min ﬁgure in Tables 6.1 and 6.2. Moreover, the presented data
are drawn from on-wafer measured results that do not take into account additional
package losses.
When evaluating a 60 GHz LNA design for a standard-compliant system, it
is important to take into consideration its performance over a wide frequency
range. In general, for both LNAs and PAs, a tradeoff exists between operating
bandwidth and power consumption. By using high-impedance inter-stage matching
techniques, a higher gain (and potentially lower NF) can be obtained with a lower
bias current. A good example of this design approach is the LNA presented in
[11], which achieves a very low power consumption of only 4 mW with a 3 dB
bandwidth of approximately 4 GHz. In contrast, to achieve wide-band operation
often involves the use of relatively low-impedance match techniques or the use of

several cascaded stages (each optimized at a slightly different frequency). Both of
these techniques increase power consumption.
Figure 6.1 shows an example of measured LNA performance; the data
corresponds to the SiGe-based design presented in [1]. A measured NF of 5 dB
with about ±1 dB variation across frequency and temperature was obtained. As
mentioned above, while the absolute noise performance of silicon-based LNAs
is not expected to improve signiﬁcantly beyond currently reported results, the
availability of higher cutoff frequencies in both SiGe and CMOS is expected to
improve the stability of such designs over frequency and temperature.

60GHz PAs in SiGe and CMOS
A summary of recently developed PAs for the 60 GHz band is presented in Table 6.5.
All of the reported results were measured at ambient temperature. Due to the
availability of both a higher supply voltage as well as typically higher achiev-
able voltage gain for a given ampliﬁcation stage, PAs in SiGe exhibit, in general,
higher efﬁciency and output power than their CMOS counterparts. The differences
in performance among reported PA designs in SiGe [16–19] reﬂect the fact that
PAs have a wide design space and face multiple tradeoffs. The PA reported in [18]
is a nonlinear design aimed at achieving a high PAE. Non-linear PAs can reduce
power consumption in systems where constant-envelope modulations are employed.
On the other hand, the PA in [16] was speciﬁcally designed to attain a high linearity
and achieve an OP1dB as close as possible to the saturated output power, which
would be beneﬁcial for modulations with a relatively high PAPR. Moreover, the
design in [19] achieves a high saturated output power by using a cascade conﬁgu-
ration that enables relatively large output voltage swings from a 4 V supply, at the
expense of lower efﬁciency.
All of the 60 GHz PAs in CMOS reported to date operate in linear mode (class A)
or with moderate nonlinearity (class AB). Taking into account that different designs
have used different supply voltages (in some cases [10, 24, 13, 26] exceeding the
nominal value employed for digital circuits on the same technology), it can be
observed that 60 GHz CMOS PAs are capable of delivering 7–10 dBm maximum
output power when using a single device at the output and 10–13 dBm when
employing two devices at the last ampliﬁcation stage (with their outputs combined
through an on-chip passive component or connected to a differential output). As
in the case of LNAs, these numbers should be treated with caution when used for
link budget analysis since they do not account for degradation due to temperature
variations and package-related losses. It is also worthwhile to note that, from these
available 60 GHz PA reports, there is no clear technological advantage between the
90 nm, 65 nm, and 45 nm nodes.
While future advances in silicon technologies are expected to moderately increase
60 GHz PA efﬁciency (mainly due to improvements in fMAX), signiﬁcant advances
in output power depend on further innovations in mm-wave PA architecture and
implementation. To understand this trend better, it is necessary to look at the impact
of technology scaling in more detail. Tables 6.1 and 6.2 provide evidence of a well-
known tradeoff in RF device engineering. The continuous down-scaling of transistor
dimensions that is required to increase the cutoff frequencies implies higher electric
ﬁelds across materials and, in turn, lowers the maximum operating voltages for
reliable operation. Note that during normal operation, the devices in the ﬁnal stage
of the PA will experience voltage swings that exceed the supply voltage. The long-
term degradation mechanisms in CMOS PAs operating at mm-wave frequencies
are yet to be understood, and for this reason some CMOS PAs have been reported

1In these designs, the ﬁnal PA stage employs a single SiGe HBT or CMOS FET device and the
output power is measured single-ended.
2In these designs, the ﬁnal PA stage consists of two separate devices. Transmission lines or a
transformer are used on chip to combine their output power to a single-ended terminal.
3In these designs, the ﬁnal PA stage consists of two separate devices connected to differential
outputs. The reported output power is either the result of off-chip power combining or assumes
that the output signals are combined at a differential antenna.

with measurements under reduced voltage supply conditions [21] to assess their
performance under long-term reliability constraints.
The reduction of maximum operating voltage does not necessarily imply a propor-
tional reduction in the amount of power that can be obtained from a semiconductor
device in a 60 GHz PA. In principle, a given amount of delivered output power
can be maintained with decreased voltage swing as long as the amount of deliv-
ered current is increased in the same proportion by using impedance transformation
techniques. In a real design the practical extent of this impedance transformation
is limited by multiple factors such as the ﬁnal load impedance presented by the
package and antenna, as well as the area and power loss introduced by the pas-
sive impedance-transformation network. For these reasons, the development of PA
architectures that maintain or increase the available output power at 60 GHz with
relatively low supply voltage is an active topic of research.

60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
Since the amount of RF power that can be obtained from a single device is
essentially limited by technology, increased output power must instead come from
the aggregation of the mm-wave energy originating from different devices. This is
achieved through the use of power combining techniques. Table 6.5 shows that it is
common – and relatively straightforward – to combine the output from two differ-
ent devices and increase the PA output power by about 3 dB. However, to combine
the output of more than two devices requires the implementation of customized com-
plex passive networks. At mm-wave frequencies, these power combiners must be
carefully designed leveraging EM simulation and their area overhead may become
an important drawback. Figure 6.2 illustrates this area and the tradeoff between
complexity and output power with two extreme examples.
The PA illustrated on the left in Figure 6.2 was implemented in SiGe 0.13 µm
technology, combines a total of four differential outputs (8 HBT devices in total),
and delivers a maximum output power of 23 dBm at 60 GHz using a 4 V supply [27].
A different power combiner design in 90 nm CMOS [28] combines four separate
single-ended CMOS ampliﬁers and attains a maximum 60 GHz output power of 14.2
dBm from a 1 V supply. Both designs achieve a higher saturated output compared

than 1 mm2 of silicon (which is comparable to a digital baseband IC or some of its
portions) and achieve a maximum PAE of only 6%.
6.3.3
Process Variability in Silicon Millimeter-Wave Designs
A separate but nonetheless important consideration for both PAs and LNAs is the
process variability. For analog and mixed-signal circuits with moderate to high
complexity (such as ADCs, op-amp based signal processing units, or complex sup-
ply regulators) the increased device variability introduced by device scaling is a
growing concern. The development of techniques to address this variability is an
active topic of investigation. Millimeter-wave front-end circuits are different in that
their complexity lies in the precise (in terms of layout, and EM modeling) inte-
gration of active components with custom-designed passive elements rather than in
the large-scale interaction of multiple transistors. Given the relatively low device
count, and because the RF properties (power gain, noise, and parasitics) for a given
bias current are very stable across process [5], mm-wave ampliﬁers can show a
remarkable performance uniformity against process variations even when realized
using simple constant-current biasing techniques. As an example, Figure 6.3 shows

Frequency Synthesis and Radio Architectures
The overall architecture of a 60 GHz radio is closely related to its frequency planning
and frequency synthesis strategy; both architecture and frequency planning will be
discussed in this section. Figure 6.4 presents a generic super-heterodyne architecture
for a 60 GHz transceiver chipset. A two-step conversion architecture for 60 GHz
applications has two main advantages from a local oscillator (LO) signal generation
viewpoint:
1. The VCO can operate at frequencies below 30 GHz where wider frequency tun-
ing range and phase noise can be obtained, especially considering process and
temperature variations. This is particularly important for applications that target
use of all of the frequency channels and at least some of the complex modulation
schemes of standards such as IEEE 802.15.3c.
2. The quadrature of the up-conversion and down-conversion signals is introduced
at the ﬁrst up/down-conversion step at a frequency below 15 GHz and through
the use of a divider. SC and OFDM signaling schemes at Gbps data rates require
very precise quadrature balance; this is very challenging to achieve over process
and temperature variations as the frequency increases. While accurate 90◦phase
generation over a frequency range of 9–14 GHz is by no means a trivial task, it
can be handled with known on-chip calibration techniques.
In principle, different combinations of frequency division and multiplication fac-
tors can be employed in a super-heterodyne architecture. In our analysis, we focus on
the use of a division factor of 2 since it is one of the best-known ways of obtaining
quadrature signals. Furthermore, design techniques for implementing a divide-by-
2 circuit are mature enough to allow different performance optimization tradeoffs
among power consumption, phase noise, robustness, and other factors. Frequency
multipliers, on the other hand, are based on the inherent nonlinear properties of
semiconductor devices. Fundamentally it is possible to implement frequency mul-
tiplication factors of 2, 3, 4 or more at mm-wave frequencies in both SiGe and
CMOS. Nevertheless, the practical choices are limited since conversion efﬁciency
and output power are critical for the use of a frequency multiplier in a 60 GHz
radio. In particular, the conversion gain of the front-end down-conversion and up-
conversion mixers are strongly dependent on their input LO power. In this sense, an
efﬁcient frequency multiplier solution relies on the use of the frequency harmonic
that is natural to the voltage-to-current conversion characteristics of a given semi-
conductor device. This consideration leads to the conclusion that, in general, the

use of a frequency tripler is more power efﬁcient in SiGe and a frequency doubler
more power efﬁcient in CMOS. An example of the implementation of a 60 GHz
transmitter and receiver in SiGe that uses a frequency tripler is presented in [7].
Having outlined the design considerations in favor of the use of a divide-by-2
circuit and a multiplication factor of either 2 or 3, Tables 6.6 and 6.7 outline the full
frequency planning of a super-heterodyne radio to comply with the channel plan of
the IEEE 802.15.13c standard, as described in Chapter 1. The use of multiplication
by 2 results in higher VCO and IF frequencies but makes the image frequency
easier to ﬁlter.
Table 6.8 presents a summary of reported frequency synthesis solutions for
60 GHz radios. Although a frequency multiplier degrades the LO phase noise with
respect to that of the source VCO, solutions that employ a multiplication factor

or 60 GHz LO carrier. It is also important to observe that two-step conversion
solutions naturally enable coverage of a wider range of frequencies as compared
to direct alternatives.

Radio–Baseband Interface
6.5.1
ADCs and DACs for Wide Bandwidth Signals
With respect to previous wireless technologies, such as 802.11a/b/g/n, 60 GHz sys-
tems augment the employed channel bandwidth by a factor of 10 or more. This
increase, which is the principal factor in enabling data rates in excess of 1 Gb/s,
demands a proportional increase in the sampling rate of analog-to-digital and digital-
to-analog interfaces in the system. To process the channel bandwidth of signaling
schemes in the 802.15.3c standard (approx. 850 MHz at baseband), a sampling
rate of at least 1.7 Gsps is necessary. Nevertheless, proper symbol synchronization
requires some degree of oversampling, and sampling rates in excess of 2.5 Gsps
will be required in most practical 60 GHz systems.

To understand the challenge involved in attaining these conversion speeds
and – once again the impact of technology scaling on the expected performance,
we examine the recent trends in silicon integrated ADCs and DACs. Table 6.9
presents a summary of ADCs reported in the last 5 years which feature sample
frequencies greater than 400 MHz [34–53]. The designs are grouped by technology
node to support analysis of performance trends. Due to the high speed switching
nature of data conversion operations (similar to those in digital circuits), CMOS
is the clear technology of choice for data converters within this range of
sampling frequencies.
In addition to the designed number of bits and maximum sampling frequency,
Table 6.9 includes the effective number of bits (ENOB) and effective resolution
bandwidth (ERBW). The ENOB is calculated from the measured signal-to-noise-
and-distortion ratio (SNDR) that corresponds to an input signal with a frequency
equal to the ERBW (usually the Nyquist frequency). In other words, the ADC has at
least x ENOB over the signal bandwidth ERBW. To compare ADC conversion efﬁ-
ciencies, the following ﬁgure of merit (FOM) is generally employed in the literature:
FOM = Power consumption
(2 · ERBW) · (2ENOB)[pJ/conv].
(6.1)
ADCs with high sampling rates have an ENOB performance that tends to decrease
with input frequency due to multiple design impairments such as clock jitter,
mismatch between components, and nonlinearities. Robust ADCs maintain an

ENOB closer to the designed number of bits over an ERBW closer to the Nyquist
frequency; this is in general the desired ADC performance for wide bandwidth
wireless applications.
It is important to note that in most ADC publications the reported power con-
sumption corresponds exclusively to the ADC core; the unit that actually performs
the conversion. In practice, high-speed ADCs require additional components such
as clock buffers, drivers for analog and digital signals connected externally through
50  interfaces, and voltage regulators. The performance of this additional circuitry
is vital not only to ADC operation but also to maintain the required ENOB over

voltage, process and temperature variations. The power and silicon area associated
with these components is often comparable to that of the ADC core itself.
In order to give a better understanding of the trends in ADC efﬁciency for
different technology nodes, Figures 6.5 and 6.6 present the ADC FOM as a function
of ENOB and ERBW for the designs in Table 6.9. Additional ADCs in a 0.13 µm
CMOS process are also plotted in these graphs to provide a technology-scaling per-
spective. At low to moderate ENOB (less than 5.5 bits) and ERBW less than 1 GHz,
there are several examples of ADCs achieving an FOM<1 pJ/conv. Nevertheless,
as both speed and resolution increase, efﬁciency decreases exponentially.
The transition from a 0.13 µm to a 90 nm process combined with innovations
in ADC architecture and calibration algorithms, resulted in improved conversion
efﬁciency versus ERBW, as can be observed in Figure 6.5. The availability of a
65 nm technology enabled ADCs with higher sampling frequencies [50, 51], but
so far has not demonstrated an increased efﬁciency for a given ERBW. When
comparing conversion efﬁciency with respect to ENOB (Figure 6.6) it can be
observed that both 90 nm and 65 nm technologies offer an advantage with respect
to 0.13 µm for ADCs with relatively low resolution but not for ENOB greater
than 5.5 dB. These observations indicate that as technology scaling progresses,
it is easier to achieve faster conversion speeds (due to higher fT and fMAX);

nevertheless the associated reduction in voltage supply and increased device
mismatch (detrimental to comparators and other ADC circuits) make it difﬁcult to
sustain the ENOB performance and/or to increase the overall conversion efﬁciency.
In this context, it is clear that continuous innovation in ADC design is a key to
making power consumption acceptable in 60 GHz systems. For example, the ADC
reported in [44] (2.5 mW for about 600 MHz ERBW and 4 ENOB) has the best
conversion efﬁciency (0.16 pJ/conv) among the published ADCs at these speeds
and is a major advance in the state of the art. For a 2 Gbps QPSK OFDM system,
the ADC requirements are approximately 5 ENOB and 1 GHz of ERBW. So far,
only two of the reported ADCs meet these speciﬁcations [47, 52] and they do
so at an FOM of 0.5 pJ/conv. It is interesting to observe that these ADCs were
implemented in signiﬁcantly different technologies (90 nm and 45 nm) but achieve
almost identical performance by applying different calibration and architecture
concepts. Further design innovations and possibly the use of a 32 nm process will
be required to maintain this performance with the required robustness to process
and temperature variations required for a commercial 60 GHz system. For 3 Gbps
or higher using 16-QAM OFDM over the same 1 GHz bandwidth, the required
resolution would be about 8 bits (based on extrapolation from 802.11a designs).

If an efﬁciency of 0.8 pJ/conv is achieved at future levels of performance, the
corresponding ADC would consume approximately 400 mW.
A smaller number of examples are found in the literature for high speed DACs
[54–57]. Some of the relevant designs are listed in Table 6.10. The required char-
acteristics for a Gbps OFDM design in a 60 GHz system would be approximately
50 dB of spurious-free-dynamic range (SFDR, analogous performance metric to
SNDR in ADCs) and a sample frequency greater than 2 GHz. The DAC reported
in [57] meets these speciﬁcations with a power consumption of 180 mW. The
performance trends previously discussed for ADCs are expected to be similar in
the case of DACs.
6.5.2
Modulators, Demodulators and Analog Signal Processors
for Gbps Applications
As can be understood from the previous subsection, the resources (design complex-
ity, power, area) demanded by a high-speed digital modulation engine along with
an ADC/DAC operating at GHz clock sampling rates may become an important
bottleneck for the incorporation of these high-speed radios into portable devices.
This has motivated the development of integrated modulators and demodulators for
relatively simple modulation schemes, trading off spectral efﬁciency for reduced
system complexity.
Before the availability of silicon-integrated mm-wave integrated circuits, 60 GHz
communication systems based on monolithic microwave integrated circuits were
already employing modulators and demodulators for OOK [58] and BSK [59].
This trend continues in the most recent examples of CMOS 60 GHz transceivers
which employ SC modulation schemes and incorporate several signal-processing
functions in the analog and/or mixed-signal domains. Two 60 GHz transceivers in
90 nm CMOS integrate OOK modulator and demodulator [60, 61], while a reported
transceiver in 65 nm CMOS supports BPSK [62]. Furthermore, the transceiver in
[63] includes a QAM modulator in the transmitter and an equalizer in the receiver
path. MSK signaling offers the advantages of being a constant-envelope modulation

with higher spectral efﬁciency than QPSK, BPSK and OOK. Moreover, as discussed
in Chapter 1, it is employed as common-mode modulation in the IEEE 802.15.3c
standard. A mixed-signal baseband integrated circuit (intended for integration in a
60 GHz receiver) for the coherent detection of MSK modulation is presented in [64]
and achieves up to 1 Gbps with only 55 mW.
As an example of an integrated modulator for Gbps data rates, an MSK modulator
that has been integration with a sliding-IF super-heterodyne 60 GHz transmitter
[65] is now described. Figure 6.7 is a conceptual block diagram of this modulator.
Transconductors (gm) convert quadrature baseband sinusoidal signals into current.
The digital data enters the modulator in two branches (I and Q) and controls the
polarity of the current. Both current signals are multiplied by an LO signal and then
combined. This operation completes the modulation procedure and up-converts the
resultant signal to a desired RF frequency which, in a super-heterodyne radio, can
be the sliding-IF frequency.
MSK modulation is achieved by applying quadrature sinusoids to the baseband
I and Q inputs, along with appropriately coded and synchronized binary polarity
control signals on the Data I and Data Q lines. The polarities of the cosine and sine
pulses change at their crossover points to encode a bit stream onto the frequency of
the output signal. In this example encoding, an information data bit of 1 generates a
positive frequency and a data bit of 0 generates a negative frequency. The frequency
changes polarity at I/Q quadrant boundaries as shown in Figure 6.7. The resulting
MSK modulated signal has the attractive properties of constant envelope and good
spectral efﬁciency. As a speciﬁc example, to generate a 2 Gbps MSK data stream,
quadrature I/Q tones with a frequency of 500 MHz are input to the MSK modulator
baseband I/Q ports while a 2 Gbps data stream is split and encoded into two 1 Gbps

data streams to control the polarity of the sinusoids. Since, as described above,
the MSK encoding produces a positive frequency shift when transmitting a ‘1’ bit
and a negative shift when transmitting a ‘0’ bit, this signal can be demodulated
by a conventional FM discriminator. Circuit implementation details for both the
modulator and demodulator are provided in [66], including a demonstration of their
operation up to 2 Gbps.

Introduction
Although various wireless standards deﬁne speciﬁcations for the air interface
rather than from the transmitter side of the link, the overall system performance
is often determined by the receiver-side design.1 In 60 GHz systems, this situation
is becoming even more apparent due to various implementation challenges. Both
carrier frequency and data transmission rates are an order of magnitude higher than
in conventional wireless systems such as 5 GHz wireless local area networks. As a
result, while major challenges in conventional wireless systems exist in recovering
the channel disturbances, those in 60 GHz involve radio frequency (RF) as well as
some baseband-related circuits (data converters, etc.) that could behave signiﬁcantly
different from ideal models in popular simulation environments such as MATLAB.
In this chapter we will discuss single carrier (SC) system implementation
examples, starting with two proof-of-concept implementations equipped with full
digital baseband, one with non-coherent detection and the other with differentially
coherent detection. These systems were designed as early-phase prototyping;
nevertheless, they provide signiﬁcant technical insight for the design of multi-Gbps
wireless systems with digital baseband techniques. The modulation formats used
in the non-coherent demonstration system described here have been adopted as

designed
to
compensate for non-idealities from early RF prototypes. Then, after presenting the
test and evaluation results, we will discuss how to implement more advanced SC
systems that can comply with a given standard such as IEEE 802.15.3c.
We assume that, with SC modulation schemes, a low-power and low-cost 60 GHz
system implementation is feasible under line-of-sight (LOS) channel environments,
when non-coherent detection is used, and that high-performance implementation
is also an option with additional signal processing, when coherent detection is
exploited.
All the implementation examples discussed here were conducted with real-time
ﬁeld-programmable gate array (FPGA) based platforms. Compared with non-real-
time software baseband implementations, more realistic designs can be tested and
veriﬁed with various real-time feedback loops. Compared with application-speciﬁc
integrated circuit (ASIC) designs, the FPGA-based approaches help to reduce design
risks given unknown channel and RF characteristics and rapidly changing standards.
The design can be easily converted to ASIC for ﬁnal products, resulting in efﬁcient
design in terms of cost and power consumption. Further details on non-coherent and
differentially coherent system implementations can be found in [1, 2] while further
details on advanced SC systems with coherent detection can be found in [3–5].
This chapter is organized as follows. Section 7.2 brieﬂy describes the advantages
and challenges of SC system, in particular highlighting implementation aspects.
Sections 7.3 and 7.4 present system design with non-coherent detection and differ-
entially coherent detection, respectively. After test and evaluation results of these
systems in Section 7.5, we will discuss an advanced SC system with per-packet
coherent detection that can comply with the IEEE 802.15.3c SC standard in Section
7.6. Our conclusions are presented in Section 7.7.
7.2
Advantages and Challenges of SC Systems
Assuming more than 1 GHz bandwidth allocation per channel in 60 GHz bands, a
SC modulation scheme is a natural choice. Indeed, SC systems have various advan-
tages over their multi-carrier counterparts in implementing 60 GHz systems. First of
all, they require less stringent radio design. This is because SC systems are in gen-
eral less sensitive to power ampliﬁer nonlinearity and RF phase noise as described
in Chapter 5 (see Section 5.4). Secondly, SC systems require a smaller effective
number of bits (ENOB) in data converter designs. Data converters sometimes can
be skipped for systems with non-coherent detection. Thirdly, since the design point
of SC systems, in terms of performance and complexity, can be chosen, it can
cover a wider range of applications. Given that it is still challenging to implement

an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) mode in battery-powered
devices, SC modes should be supported by every 60 GHz device, including those
with OFDM modes, in order to communicate across different devices. As described
in detail in Chapter 6, future technology scaling is naturally expected to improve
digital integration and performance but not analog/RF performance in general. For
this reason, the relative challenges of implementing 60 GHz OFDM and SC sys-
tems with respect to RF non-idealities are not expected to change signiﬁcantly in
the future.
On the other hand, in 60 GHz SC systems, both carrier recovery and symbol tim-
ing recovery have to be carefully considered. Even if the carrier phase and frequency
recovery can be adequately dealt with in the RF front-end, or can be neglected
since non-coherent detection is used, the baseband needs to deal with symbol tim-
ing recovery at more than a gigasymbol per second as is shown in Figure 7.1. The
sampling points may shift due to clock offset and jitter in the transmitter (TX)
and receiver (RX). Analog timing recovery, using clock data recovery (CDR) for
example, does not always work, in particular for packet transmission systems. On
the other hand, digital timing recovery with extensive oversampling will increase

the data converter cost and power consumption. In addition, the received signal is
shaped by spectral mask requirements as well as radio inherent characteristics, and
appropriate equalization schemes to remove the inter-symbol interference (ISI) will
become important as the modulation index increases. Furthermore, though it can
be reduced with well-controlled beamforming antenna techniques, channel multi-
path effects result in additional ISI. Since SC systems need to transmit multi-Gbps
data streams without splitting them into multiple sub-carriers, a typical channel
delay spread tends to be larger than the symbol period. Still, as long as multi-path
effects can be controlled and thus coherent bandwidth is high (i.e. the channel is
highly frequency selective) and the nulls in the channel frequency response are
not in severe deep fade, SC systems can actually behave quite nicely by spreading
frequency-dependent effects across multiple symbols. It is important to note that
this argument is often independent of whether the channel is LOS or NLOS.
7.3
System Design with Non-Coherent Detection2
In non-coherent detection, the receiver makes no assumption about the carrier
phase. In the literature there are three known non-coherent techniques: amplitude
shift keying (ASK) with envelope detection, differential binary shift keying
(DBPSK) with differential detection, and /frequency shift keying minimum shift
keying (FSK/MSK) with frequency discriminator detection [6]. Even though
simple implementation techniques without using an analog-to-digital (ADC) or
digital-to-analog converter (DAC) are well known for ASK and FSK, they often
result in much worse spectral efﬁciency. For example, since binary FSK is a
modulation scheme with an efﬁciency of 0.5 b/Hz, multi-Gbps transmission could
be wasteful. Therefore, we decided to use π/2 BPSK as well as MSK with some
built-in analog ﬁlter functions in the radio.
We consider two approaches. One is to design both a TX radio and a baseband
with MSK-speciﬁc modulation functions. MSK is a constant-envelope modulation
technique and has an acceptable spectral efﬁciency [7]. The unﬁltered spectra using
MSK are more compact than those using ASK or BPSK. Half-sinusoidal pulses at
faster than Gbps data rates are required in order to generate MSK waveforms using
a standard I/Q interface, which usually requires high-speed DACs. This problem
has been solved by partitioning the modulation function into the radio chip and
the baseband FPGA with two additional clock outputs from the baseband to the
radio through the standard I/Q interface. The radio desgin details can be found in
Chapter 6 as well as in [8].
The other approach is to use a standard I/Q interface TX radio, but design the
baseband such that the nearest-neighbor transition between the quadrature phase

shift keying (QPSK) constellation points can encode MSK-like signals. This
approach can be considered as a simple way of generating π/2 BPSK signals,
since, if one is rotated by π/4 with respect to the other, they are identical. In
RX, the I/Q phase is rotated anyway. This approach does not require tristate I/Q
signaling or a π/2 chip-level rotator. It is known that the π/2 BPSK modulation
formats with an appropriate ﬁltering can generate MSK-compatible signals; see [9].
The prototype demonstration system shown in Figure 7.2 is designed to conﬁrm
both approaches. It takes HDTV streaming video from a camera or other device
in DVI format and transmits it from the SiGe RF TX module to the RX module
with appropriate baseband signal processing in each FPGA, and ﬁnally outputs the
video to an HDTV monitor with DVI input. It functions as a wireless DVI-to-DVI
cable. Figure 7.3 shows more detailed block diagrams for the TX/RX baseband. The
baseband in each side consists of a single FPGA (Xilinx Vertex-II Pro XC2VP50)
as well as the external DVI interface chip and the video buffer memory located on
the demonstration board.
Baseband input and output formats are shown in Figure 7.4. In the TX, video
sources generate uncompressed HDTV streaming output in DVI format. The stream-
ing image is converted to a 1080i signal (30 Hz frame rate, YCbCr = 4:2:2, 10-bit

The packetizer processes the stream with a 20-bit width at 100 MHz and splits it
into a pair of 300-bit packets.

Detailed block diagram for non-coherent baseband for DVI video
input/output: (a) transmitter baseband; (b) receiver baseband.
Parity symbols are added in the error control code (ECC) encoding block. We
designed an experimental codeword conﬁguration that can recover random errors
as well as packet losses, since we had some uncertainty in error patterns caused by
both impairments and disturbances in the RF section and the channel. The scheme
is used for both non-coherent and differentially coherent systems. For random error
correction we use a BCH (350, 300) code that can correct up to ﬁve random bit
errors, and for burst errors and packet losses we use symbol-based partially over-
lapped block (POB) code (POB (150; 149; 3)) [10]. Both codes are built on GF(210)
and combined as a concatenated code. The data is transmitted, after appropriate pre-
coding and scrambling (with x9 + x4 + 1), to the TX RF module through FPGA’s
high-speed I/O ports. We avoid using convolutional codes, since the code rate is
low and burst error correction capability is limited unless deeply interleaved. Our
block-code-based approach enables good error correction performance for both ran-
dom and burst/packet errors at high code rate. The detailed conﬁguration for BCH
(350, 300) and POB (150; 149; 3) is shown in Figure 7.5. For the present POB
code, an n = 150 symbol frame is divided into s = 3 subframes (each containing

respectively) and a set of three (150, 149) Reed–Solomon (RS) codes (the parity
check conditions are generated by 1, α, and α2, respectively) are used to recover
lost packets.
The RX baseband also consists of a single FPGA as shown in Figure 7.3. No ADC
board is used and the digital signal of the FM discriminator output is transferred to
a CDR of the FPGA. After the clock and data are separated, the signal remapping
and descrambling are done. The BCH inner decoder corrects random errors and
detects corrupted packets and passes the signal to the outer decoder. The outer
decoder recovers packets based on the uncorrectable packet signals from the inner
decoder. After random error correction and packet recovery, packets are reformatted
as video lines after the parity symbols are stripped off in the depacketizer. The signal
is passed through asynchronous FIFO to adjust the clock frequency differences,
similar to the transmitter baseband. If the cyclic redundancy checksum does not
match, that particular line is discarded, and the video retraces the last correctly
received line. The video output section converts the video stream to DVI format
and outputs it to the HDTV monitor.

A block diagram of the decoder is shown in Figure 7.5. The BCH inner decoder
corrects random errors, detects corrupted packets and passes the signal to the outer
decoder. The BCH decoder circuit consists of units for syndrome calculation, error
locator polynomial generation, and Chien search. The outer decoder recovers pack-
ets depending on the uncorrectable packet signals from the inner decoder.
Although the non-coherent detection system can make use of CDR to recover bit
timing for streaming applications for low-cost and low-power implementations in
relatively clean channel environments, the maximum data rate for a given band-
width is often reduced by half. This is because we cannot separate the information
transmitted in the in-phase (I) and (quadrature) Q channels effectively. In addition,
the lack of data converters does not allow us to consider potential extensions for
more advanced and robust baseband signal processing techniques for non-negligible
multi-path effects, etc. Furthermore, even though per-packet carrier phase recovery
is not required, per-packet symbol timing recovery will be needed for packet trans-
mission systems, and the symbol timing acquisition will need to be improved with
digital techniques.

System Design with Differentially Coherent Detection3
With these aspects in mind, an alternative system implementation can be considered.
Figure 7.6 shows the block digram of our differentially coherent demonstration
system. DQPSK modulation is a 2-bit/symbol phase modulation scheme mapping
differentially encoded binary information in the two packet streams into the I and
Q channels. These signals are delivered to the TX RF module at a data rate of
1 Gbps. Even though our radio can support other modulation methods such as ASK
and BPSK, it is difﬁcult to pass the data in I and Q separately in those cases.
Similar to our non-coherent demonstration, the system takes an HDTV image
from a camera and transmits it through SiGe RF modules with appropriate baseband
signal processing, and outputs it to an HDTV monitor.Although the use of a digital
sampling approach with high-speed ADC will allow us to adopt more advanced
signal processing techniques, the receiver-side timing recovery will become more
difﬁcult, causing more frequent sync/burst errors. We therefore added preamble and
distributed synchronization patterns to help recover timing information as shown in
Figure 7.7, when the data is passed to the DQPSK modulation block. Exploiting
the FEC design described in the previous section can help in these aspects. In other
respects the transmitter design is straightforward DQPSK baseband.

Figure 7.7
TX baseband input/output format. The input high-deﬁnition serial digital
interface stream shown above is packetized into two streams of packets and then preamble,
sync, and parity data for both inner and outer codes are added.
The receiver baseband consists of two boards. One is a Neptune board (Qinetiq
VXS1) with dual 2 Gsps 10-bit high-speed ADC chips and a Xilinx Vertex-II Pro
XC2VP50 FPGA. The FPGA contains circuits for DQPSK demodulation and syn-
chronization. The other is another input–output module (IOM) board, containing
the ECC decoder for both random error correction and packet recovery, depacke-
tizer, and video output modules. The two boards are connected through an 8b/10b
coded 2.5 Gbps serial line.
We now give the details for the demodulator circuit. After an appropriate gain
adjustment, the digital data is recovered from the receiver-side I and Q signals by
ﬁrst sampling the data at 2 Gbps (2× oversampling) and then the original data can be
recovered from the sampled signals after adjusting for the I/Q plane phase rotation.
The appropriate sampling position is determined by calculating preamble and sync
pattern correlation values with shifting sampling points. An effective interpolation
scheme is used, as is shown in Figure 7.8. The correlation values are calculated at
the two oversampling points (A and C). If these correction values are too close,
we can tell that it is more appropriate for the sampling point to be close to B.
Therefore, the output data was generated by interpolating the data at A and C. This

scheme avoids calculating correlation values at four different points (two sampled,
two interpolated), so the circuit size and power can be reduced.
Then the demodulation output is passed to another baseband board (output
IOM board), where we perform error correction to recover for random errors and
packet losses.

Test and Evaluation4
Figure 7.9 shows a setup of our demonstration system for uncompressed video
streaming. In order to achieve a successful demonstration efﬁciently, we split the
demo construction and testing into three steps: ﬁrst the baseband designs were tested
with wired connections; then the radio modules were added for wireless testing, and
ﬁnally, end-to-end testing and measurements were performed with video I/O.
The baseband testing was performed by connecting the output of the transmitter I
and Q signals into the input of the receiver I and Q after passing through appropriate

attenuators for the differentially coherent system. For the non-coherent system, the
transmitter-side interface was changed for wired testing. Since the present demon-
stration systems are built in such a way that the RF and baseband are physically
separated, they are sensitive to the cable length of the I and Q channels. They need
to match perfectly, or otherwise the signal constellation becomes severely affected.
This step also helped us to ﬁnd various bugs in the digital baseband design, such as
packet framing and coding, prior to connecting to the RF modules. It is often difﬁ-
cult to separate hidden logic bugs from inherent bit errors in wireless environments,
and wired transmission under controlled channel environment is mandatory to speed
up the debugging phase without running logic simulations for a long period of time.
After conﬁrming the baseband operations in wired conﬁguration, the RF modules
were added, and testing with the RF modules was performed with some testing
patterns. Again, the cable lengths were carefully adjusted. We veriﬁed the signal
transmission by monitoring the signals in the FPGA with an appropriate software
tool. The data was collected by using the data capture capability of the ADC board.
Finally, the source was switched to the camera, and end-to-end system veriﬁcation
was performed. Throughout our demonstration design experience, we found that
the FPGA platform really helps to adjust the design to compensate for unavoidable
disturbances in the RF front-end and channels.

Random error dominant (Phase II)
Figure 7.10
Wireless transmission results for error pattern measurements in the non-
coherent system. Note that measurement is performed by disabling FEC.
We found that the present video streaming demonstration systems are attractive
not only for “proof-of-concept” demonstration but also as a powerful measurement
tool. This is mainly because error patterns are visible in real time. For example, for
a non-coherent system under an multi-path suppressed environment, random errors
(white dots) are dominant as shown in Figure 7.10. Random error correction is quite
effective in such a case. Although a non-coherent system with no data converter
implementation excludes enhanced options such as RAKE and equalization in the
digital domain, it can still be the basis of a practical system, in particular when the
multi-path effect is small (e.g. the distance is short or the antenna gain is large).
Figure 7.11 shows how video robustness is affected for demodulator and FEC
design for the differentially coherent system. When both ECC and interpolated sync
are turned off, the image quality is reduced by many burst errors which we think
mainly arise from synchronization errors (Figure 7.11(a)). When either interpolated
sync or error correction is added (Figure 7.11 (b) or (c)), the burst errors are reduced,
though not completely. When both functions are turned on (Figure 7.11(d)), clear
and crisp images are obtained. Since random errors are not very noticeable, the
coding overhead in the present design is expected to be reduced by using a simpler
BCH code. We also note that we were successful in some NLOS transmissions by
blocking the LOS path and using a specular reﬂection signal instead.

Advanced SC System with Per-Packet Coherent Detection
In this section we will show how to implement an advanced SC system that is
compliant with a given standard such as IEEE 802.15.3c. Though detailed discussion
of various design options is beyond the scope of this chapter, there are several
important considerations.

(b) Interpolated sync only

(d) With ECC and interpolated sync
Figure 7.11
Wireless transmission results for differentially coherent system: (a) no ECC
and simple sync; (b) interpolated sync only; (c) ECC only; (d) both ECC and interpolated
sync turned on.
First of all, the coherence needs to be maintained between transmitter and receiver
on a per-packet basis, since no idle patterns can be sent between packets in multiple-
access conﬁgurations. As a result, carrier phase and frequency recovery as well as
symbol timing recovery need to be performed on a per-packet basis. Analog carrier
recovery techniques such as the Costas loop [11] are well known, but frequency
acquisition takes time. For faster acquisition, digital-domain techniques are more
preferable [12]. But it is still a challenge to maintain the phase coherence per packet
in 60 GHz, since everything is an order of magnitude faster. It should be noted that
the signal processing latency can be a major limitation in system loop bandwidth.
The preamble detection circuitry has to quickly extract necessary information relat-
ing to carrier phase and frequency offset, symbol sampling phase offset, channel
condition, etc. Efﬁcient implementations are known in Golay correlators [13], and
the design may need additional enhancements for higher data rates.
Secondly, equalizer design is critical in designing robust systems. The use of
frequency-domain equalization has been discussed in detail in Chapter 5 as well as in
[14], but the complexity will become comparable to or even exceed that of OFDM.
The lack of pilot tones in SC systems may result in additional difﬁculties in singnal
recovery. Alternatively, time-domain equalizers are an interesting option with high-
gain antennas, considering the relationship between delay spread and antenna gain as

noted in Chapter 2. In other words, as antenna gain becomes higher, the delay spread
is expected to be reduced since fewer multi-path components are involved. If the
delay spread is shorter, the number of time-domain equalizer taps can be reduced. As
a result, the time-domain equalizer can be a more efﬁcient choice than the frequency-
domain equalizer.
When implementing a time-domain equalization, we need to further consider
which time-domain equalization method to chose, and we need to carefully compare
the performance – complexity tradeoffs in different methods. Figure 7.12 compares
various time-domain equalizer implementations using MATLAB [15]. A static-ﬁlter-
only solution is not appropriate in real applications, since it is known to be sensitive
to sample timing offset. On the other hand, maximum smoothed likelihood esti-
mator ﬁlters result in high complexity. We consider that adaptive ﬁlters such as
least mean-square ﬁlters are appropriate. The advantage for 16-QAM is shown in
Figure 7.13 where an adaptive digital ﬁlter is designed to recover a SC 16-QAM
constellation [15].
Thirdly, decoding latency requires more attention in FEC designs, since, for
example, headers are protected with RS(33, 17) code and the decoding needs to
be ﬁnished before starting the signal processing in the payload part. Low-latency

FEC design techniques [16] can be of help. Low-density parity check decoders
also require high performance and low latency design. Lower latency circuit design
and implementation will also critical to improve the system tracking by increasing
loop bandwidth.
Finally, for advanced SC system demonstration, an FPGA platform equipped with
high-speed DAC/ADC such as shown in Figure 7.14 will play an important role.
Although digital designs can be veriﬁed by means of simulation, analog impair-
ments and disturbances in radio, antenna, channels are hard to model exactly and
measurement feedbacks are critical in ﬁnalizing various design options. Also, it can
help to ﬂexibly adopt moving standards.

Conclusion
We have discussed SC system implementation examples, starting with two proof-
of-concept implementations, one with non-coherent detection and the other with
differentially coherent detection, and then discussing more advanced system design
that achieved per-packet coherent detection. A comparison summary is given in
Table 7.1.
Since one of the biggest advantages of SC schemes is wide application coverage
for both AC-powered and battery-operated devices, it is quite important to show
that the scheme constitutes a roadmap for higher data rates. Our approach with
advanced SC baseband design looks promising because it can manage per-packet
coherence for higher data rate modulation schemes such as 16-QAM.
As discussed, the advantage of the SC modulation scheme will be augmented
with phased array antenna techniques, since multi-path can be actively controlled
to focus on the strongest beam path available, whether it is LOS or NLOS, to reduce
the channel delay spread.

Gbps OFDM Baseband Design
and Implementation for 60 GHz
Wireless LAN Applications
Chang-Soon Choi, Maxim Piz, Marcus Ehrig
and Eckhard Grass
For high data-rate wireless transmission over non-line-of-sight (NLOS) 60 GHz
channels, the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme has been
preferred to single carrier (SC) schemes due to its stronger immunity to highly
frequency-selective fading [1].1 This would make baseband receiver implementation
easier since costly equalizers required in SC schemes can be signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed.
However, an OFDM is more sensitive to synchronization errors compared to a SC
scheme. As an additional challenge, 60 GHz phase-locked loops (PLLs) exhibit
worse frequency instability and phase noise characteristics than microwave-band
ones. Therefore, it is necessary to design synchronization architecture more carefully
in a 60 GHz OFDM baseband receiver.
This chapter describes design consideration and implementation issues for the
60 GHz OFDM baseband processor which we developed for the WIGWAM [2] and
EASY-A projects [3]. An FPGA platform has been utilized for baseband implemen-
tation since it allows simpler modiﬁcation as well as higher ﬂexibility/scalability
in system-level hardware. Moreover, it promises simple transitions to structured
application-speciﬁc integrated circuit (ASIC) chips.

60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
However, an FPGA implementation for multi-gigabit data rate is not a straight-
forward task due to limited clock speed. The most critical blocks are fast Fourier
transform (FFT) and Viterbi decoding which require a high clock rate not avail-
able in FPGA. For example, the ﬁrst demonstrator targeted more than 1 Gbps data
throughput and this would lead to Viterbi decoder hardware operating at 1 GHz.
However, this is not available in any FPGA platform and even in ASICs with a stan-
dard design approach. Therefore, a highly parallelized architecture is indispensable
for higher data throughput than Gbps with FPGA platform.
This chapter is organized as follows. Section 8.1 describes the designed OFDM
physical layer and frame architecture. In Sections 8.2 and 8.3 the baseband processor
architectures and their implementation details for OFDM receivers and transmitters
are presented. Section 8.4 is dedicated to an indoor wireless link demonstration
with the developed 60 GHz radio front-ends. Finally, the next-generation OFDM
demonstrator and its performance evaluation are presented.

The key OFDM timing parameters used in the baseband developed are summa-
rized in Table 8.1. We assumed a channel bandwidth of 500 MHz for one channel,
therefore parameters were adapted to a bandwidth of 330 MHz with the sampling
frequency of 400 MHz. Cyclic preﬁx length and sub-carrier spacing were chosen to
yield a good compromise between tolerated delay spread in 60 GHz channels and

There have been several reports that 60 GHz wireless channels exhibit root-mean-
squared (rms) delay spreads ranging from a few nanoseconds to several tens of
nanoseconds in a typical indoor environment [6–9]. In general, an OFDM system
is designed to have a cyclic preﬁx length greater than twice the rms delay spread
in a wireless channel. Moreover, ﬁlters would add up channel responses, causing
the effective guard interval to be reduced. Consequently, a guard time of more than
150 ns would be required to support 64-QAM modulation. To avoid substantial loss
of data rate, the guard time should be only a small fraction of the OFDM symbol
time (e.g. 20% in IEEE 802.11a). To lower the impact of the guard time on efﬁ-
ciency, we could have increased the symbol duration using a larger FFT. However,
this approach would lead to higher susceptibility to phase noise because of smaller
sub-carrier spacing. As a result, a cyclic preﬁx of 160 ns together with a FFT period
of 640 ns (256 sub-carriers in 400 MHz bandwidth) resulting in a symbol time of
800 ns were chosen. Unused guard sub-carriers near the channel edge facilitate
channel ﬁltering with low complexity. The convolutional coding (171, 133) was
utilized for forward error correction. With deﬁned puncturing patterns and modula-
tion from binary shift keying (BPSK) to 64-QAM, eight data modes with different
data rates are supported as shown in Table 8.2. Bit interleaving was performed over
data blocks equal to one OFDM symbol.
To increase immunity to 60 GHz channel and phase noise impairments, we devel-
oped a novel synchronization and channel estimation scheme. Detailed information
on this scheme, including a performance evaluation, is available in [10]. With the
preamble structure shown in Figure 8.1, it allows sufﬁciently precise time and fre-
quency synchronization performance without a costly cross-correlator. The preamble
has a length of 11 OFDM symbols and it enables robust initial synchronization and
channel estimation despite high phase noise arising from 60 GHz PLLs. To achieve
high efﬁciency, the data frame length should be chosen sufﬁciently large using
medium access control (MAC) frame aggregation.

Performance Evaluation in the Presence of Clock Deviation
and Phase Noise
Figure 8.2 shows the simulated performance for 16-QAM modulation with 1/2
convolutional coding rate, providing 480 Mbps data rate. A frame error rate (FER)
curve is plotted for a frame length of 2048 bytes. We accounted for all overhead
losses including preamble, signal ﬁeld, pilot signals and cyclic preﬁx. The channel
model used in this simulation was developed for 60 GHz LOS channels realized
with an omnidirectional antenna at a transmitter and a Vivaldi antenna having 30◦
half-power beamwidth (HPBW) at a receiver. This performance is compared with
an ideal case where no phase noise and sampling timing drift is applied [11]. For
the practical case scenario, we have assumed 30 ppm clock frequency deviation
and a Wiener model for the phase noise. Both transmitter and receiver PLLs were
assumed to have a single sideband phase noise value of LSSB = −93 dbc/Hz at
1 MHz offset. It is observed that a frame error rate of 10% is achieved at an energy
per bit to noise power spectral density ratio (Eb/N0) of 12.3 dB. The performance
loss due to phase noise and sampling timing drift is about 0.7 dB.

OFDM Baseband Receiver Architecture
An OFDM baseband processor was implemented with FPGA platform using Virtex-
II pro devices [11]. Prior to hardware implementation, as exempliﬁed in Figure 8.2,
we performed extensive simulations of the designed OFDM baseband under differ-
ent channels and hardware impairments. Afterward, the complete transceiver was

synthesized and mapped to FPGA. The synthesis results indicated that the com-
plexity of the OFDM receiver architecture is more than twice higher than that
of the transmitter due to the high complexity of the Viterbi decoder as well as
the additional blocks required for receiver operation. Therefore, we describe the
implementation of an OFDM receiver ﬁrst in this section.
In Figure 8.3, a block diagram for the developed OFDM receiver is shown.
The OFDM receiver can be functionally divided into an inner receiver (or digital
front-end) and an outer receiver (or data-path processor). The main function of a
digital front-end is to process the incoming I/Q-baseband signal waveform and to
retrieve constellation symbols which are mapped on sub-carriers. This digital front-
end also includes the receiver functions required for OFDM signal processing,
such as synchronization, FFT operation, channel estimation, channel equalization,
common phase correction and phase tracking. The data-path processor performs
symbol demapping/weighting, deinterleaving and channel decoding. As mentioned
earlier, there was the hardware limitation that the typical clock speed achievable
for complex designs mapped on the Virtex-II pro family was around 100 MHz.

sub-carrier symbols were multiplexed and processed in parallel in most of the
digital front-end stage. Full pipelining was also employed to achieve the required
total throughput. The processing in the blocks after and including the FFT process
is burst-oriented. To process gigabit throughput with available Viterbi decoders, the
OFDM transmitter de-multiplexes the source stream into 12 sub-streams, which are
encoded separately. The receiver decoding block contains a bank of 12 parallel
decoding blocks. Each block consists of a deinterleaver and a Viterbi decoder with
maximum processing up to 100 Mbps. The number of blocks involved during a
frame reception depends on the data mode.
8.2.1
Receiver Front-End
8.2.1.1
Input Stage and Synchronization
The complex-valued I/Q signals from the 60 GHz analog front-end are ﬁrst oversam-
pled with an 8-bit analog-to-digital (ADC) converter at a sampling rate of 800 Msps.
A ﬁnite impulse response half-band ﬁlter then performs decimation by a factor of 2.
A digital automatic gain control (AGC) ampliﬁer ensures a deﬁned input level for
subsequent stages. The designed synchronizer performs frame detection, coarse
timing estimation and carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation with the deﬁned
preamble architecture [10]. The AGC gain level is kept ﬁxed after frame detection
to prevent further amplitude variations. Due to processing latency, frequency offset
information is only available after the second preamble part has already started.
Therefore, a buffer stage is included in parallel to the synchronizer. As soon as
the frequency of a numerical controlled oscillator (NCO) has been set, the system
starts to continuously read out the ﬁrst FIFO buffer, corrects a frequency shift by
complex multiplication with a rotating phasor and writes the result in a second
FIFO buffer. When setting the frequency offset, the synchronizer also announces a
new successfully detected frame and provides the start index for the ﬁrst FFT.
8.2.1.2
Fast Fourier Transform
Due to the limited clock speed, the radix-4 algorithm was used to realize a four-port
256-point FFT block with four 64-point FFTs working in parallel; see the block
diagram in Figure 8.4. This enables us to process samples with 400 Msps with a
100 MHz FFT processor at the expense of area. In accordance with the algorithm, the
output results of these sub-FFTs are fed into a multiplier stage, followed by a radix-
4 butterﬂy and a reordering unit. The multiplier stage performs multiplication with
the complex twiddle factors. The pipelined architecture offers maximum throughput
without any waiting cycles.

8.2.1.3
Front-End Controller
The front-end controller manages to control global ﬂows in the digital front-end. It
features a state machine for sequencing and initiation of FFT operations at deﬁned
times. Transfers of data bursts from the input buffer 2 into the FFT are managed by
a sub-controller. Such a data burst read can be initiated as soon as the ﬁrst sample
is available in buffer 2. The front-end controller selects whether FFT output data is
delivered to the preamble processing or the data processing branch.
8.2.1.4
Scheduling
The front-end controller needs to wait until the ﬁne timing position is estimated
by the phase unwrapper. With readjusted FFT positioning, the receiver starts the
processing of accumulated waveform data. The ﬁrst data symbol in the frame con-
stitutes the signal ﬁeld which deﬁnes transmission mode parameters. They become
available when the signal ﬁeld has passed through the complete receiver chains
including the data processing branch in the front-end and the demapper, deinter-
leaver, decoder and signal ﬁeld interpreter. Given a transmission without immediate
acknowledgment, some inter-frame guard time is necessary for a receiver to be able
to process the next transmitted frame. Two provisions keep this guard time short.
Firstly, instead of waiting for a reply from the interpreter, the receiver immediately
starts to process the subsequent accumulated data symbols regardless of the actual
frame length. A buffer stage right before the front-end output acts as a gate for
data ﬂow. It lets the signal ﬁeld go through but keeps the next OFDM symbols in
the queue until frame length information is available. For short frames or in the
event of an erroneous signal ﬁeld, some stored symbols will be discarded. Sec-
ondly, the receiver is able to handle two consecutive frames simultaneously. As
soon as the last OFDM symbol is sent to the data processing branch, the front-end

Gbps OFDM Baseband Design and Implementation

controller reactivates the AGC and synchronizer. While the rest of the receiver may
still process the older frame, synchronization and channel estimation can already be
performed for the next frame. Every OFDM symbol carries a frame label, which is
used to allocate the dedicated channel data.
8.2.1.5
Channel Estimation and Fine Timing Synchronization
After the synchronization process, four long preamble symbols are transformed
into the frequency domain by FFT and delivered to the channel estimator. These
four symbols promise 6 dB channel estimation gain. In general, OFDM provides
an easier way to cope with multi-path propagation than SC schemes. Provided that
guard time is longer than the channel impulse response and time synchronization
is properly established, channel convolution in the time domain transforms into
complex multiplication in the frequency domain. Each sub-carrier symbol appears
multiplied with the channel transfer function taken at the frequency of the sub-
carrier. Like IEEE 802.11a, the long preamble symbols are generated from some
pseudo-random BPSK reference sequence b(k) ∈{−1, 1} in the frequency domain.
To estimate the channel coefﬁcients, the receiver ﬂips the sign of those sub-carrier
symbols where b(k) = −1. Since the receiver employs a simple feed-forward
scheme without channel re-estimation, it is required to have the estimated channel
coefﬁcient ˆHi and not channel coefﬁcients themselves. The receiver calculates polar
representations ˆAi exp(j ˆφi) = ˆHi of the coefﬁcients and stores the inverse channel
coefﬁcients as (1/ ˆAi) exp(−j ˆφi) = 1/ ˆHi at this point. For this purpose, a pipelined
four-port Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) stage and a divider
stage were used. In addition, sub-carrier power gain values, estimated as ˆPi ≈ˆA2
i ,
required in the following demapper/weighting and phase estimation blocks.
Fine frame synchronization is accomplished with the subsequent phase unwrap-
per. Using the time shifting property of the FFT [11], the current FFT window
location with respect to the maximum power point is proportional to the average
phase increase in frequency domain, which can be estimated by
n ≈

where α = NFFT /2Np is a constant. The summation is carried out over the set M of
those used data sub-carriers (Np = 206), with index i denoting sub-carrier number.
The OFDM receiver corrects frame timing by choosing a ﬁxed offset in advance
of the channel power maximum. This results in some sample offset m from the
new to the old FFT window position. Due to the shifting property, this means that
we require not the inverse of the original channel estimates
ˆHi, but the inverse
of corrected channel estimates ˆHi exp(2πjm · i/NFFT), for channel equalization.

Having the channel coefﬁcients stored in polar representation, the transformation to
the new set of channel coefﬁcients is trivial and easily done in the equalizer. The
receiver only needs to store the time offset as m a global parameter.
Hardware implementation was realized as shown in Figure 8.5. A 1-bit circular
shift register of length 256 is used to identify used sub-carriers. This approach offers
low complexity with four multiplexers, some subtractors/adders, registers and some
ﬁnal multiplication. Typically, a cross-correlator used for ﬁne synchronization with
a pattern length of N requires N additions per input sample. On the other hand,
this scheme requires only one subtraction and two additions per input sample.
8.2.1.6
Phase Correction and Equalization
The OFDM demonstrator presented here was designed for a static 60 GHz chan-
nel environment implying a time-invariant channel impulse response during frame
transmission. On the other hand, the rapidly changing carrier phase due to PLL
phase noise and residual carrier frequency offset induces inter-carrier interference
(ICI) and a common phase error (CPE) for all sub-carriers for the nth OFDM sym-
bol. In addition, the symbol clock deviation between transmitter and receiver causes
a drift τ(n) of the FFT window position with respect to the transmitted symbols.

Gbps OFDM Baseband Design and Implementation
221
Due to the FFT time shifting property the sub-carrier dependent phase error θ(n, k)
for OFDM symbol n and sub-carrier k, k = −128, . . . , 127 (offset representation),
is equal to
θ(n, k) = CPE(n) + τ(n)(2π/(T · NFFT)) · k
(8.2)
where T = 1/fT and fT denotes the sampling rate. Therefore, estimation of phase
error for some OFDM symbol (n) can be done with a line ﬁtting procedure in
the phase domain, where the phase error CPE (n) at DC and the phase slope
θ(n) = τ(n)(2π/(T · NFFT)) are estimated. We make use of transmitted pilot
sub-carriers modulated with BPSK for this purpose. These pilot sub-carriers lie
on a regular grid with distance p = 14 between adjacent pilot sub-carriers. To
begin with, the pilots are corrected in amplitude and phase by a dedicated pilot
equalizer. The BPSK symbols are also demodulated. Pilot equalizer and consecutive
pilot processing blocks are reduced in complexity, because only one pilot needs to
be processed within a cycle at most. For estimation of the phase parameters, we
incorporate reliability information in form of pilot power levels to account for the
different sub-carrier signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) due to the channel. The equalized
and unmodulated (sign-ﬂipped) pilot symbols for OFDM symbol n are denoted by
Zi(n), i = 1, . . . , 16, the pilot power values Pi by. Following a heuristic scheme,
which can be implemented with low complexity, the phase slope can be estimated
by the equation
θ(n) =

∠


i=1,...,15
¯Zi(n)Zi+1(n) · min(Pi, Pi+1)



/p.
(8.3)
This equation can be regarded as a phase unwrapping scheme with power weighting.
Simulation showed that link performance was very sensitive to estimation precision
of the phase slope and the variance of the estimator was too high. As a result,
link quality would strongly degrade from inner sub-carriers to outer sub-carriers
located at higher frequencies. Therefore, it was averaged over all OFDM symbols.
We assumed a ﬁxed frequency deviation between transmitter and receiver clock and
make use of a simple adaptive scheme to estimate (or predict) an averaged phase
slope  ¯θ(n) from the instantaneous estimate θ(n):
 ¯θ(n) = [1 −γ ] · [ ¯θ(n −1) +  ¯θ(n −1)] + γ · θ(n),
(8.4)
 ¯θ(n) = [1 −β] ·  ¯θ(n −1) + β · [θ(n) −θ(n −1)].
(8.5)
After the phase slope is estimated, the receiver is able to correct the phase of pilot
symbols. As described in Equation (8.2), these corrected pilot symbols are in the
direction of CPE. The receiver performs a power-weighted sum of the pilots to

attain the CPE. After both phase parameters are estimated for OFDM symbols, data
sub-carriers are processed. Before this, they are stored in FIFO buffer 3. The data
equalizer, which is made up of a multiplier stage and a CORDIC stage, corrects
the channel and estimated phase errors at the same time. The output of the receiver
front-end becomes the phase-corrected and equalized constellation symbols on data
sub-carriers. Depending on the data mode, they can be BPSK or any of the spec-
iﬁed M-ary QAM constellations. Gray encoding is employed to minimize the bit
error rate.
8.2.2
Receiver Back-End
Figure 8.6 is a block diagram of the receiver back-end which performs demapping/
weighting, deinterleaving, decoding and descrambling functions on the received
constellation symbols from the receiver front-end. The initial soft-demapper is fol-
lowed by a deinterleaver stage with 12 deinterleavers and a bank of 12 Viterbi
decoders. After the signal ﬁeld has been decoded, the contained data is analyzed in
the signal ﬁeld interpreter to calculate the current frame structure using our stream-
ing algorithm. This algorithm is used to ﬁnd the positions of the reference and
termination symbols. The calculated data is then stored in symbol scheme buffers
required for control of the receiver operation. All data transferred from decoders
is stored in a data collector block. The purpose of this block is to unstream data
and to perform descrambling. Finally, the processed data is delivered to the MAC
through the output interface.

8.2.2.1
Soft-Demapper
The implemented soft-demapper calculates bit metrics from received BPSK, QPSK,
16-QAM or 64-QAM symbols. These bit metrics are simpliﬁed log-likelihood ratios
based on the derivations presented in [12], assuming Gaussian noise. A block dia-
gram of this demapper is given in Figure 8.7. This processing block contains a
symbol buffer to overcome possible processing delays caused by subsequent dein-
terleavers and Viterbi decoders. Four parallel demappers were needed to tackle four
incoming parallel data streams coming from the channel estimator. The demap-
ping process produces bit metrics, which are then weighted with the estimated
power levels of the corresponding sub-carriers. This weighting is part of the bit
metric calculation to account for different noise power contributions in different sub-
carriers after equalization and therefore reﬂects the varying reliability of different
sub-carriers received with higher and lower signal strength. After power weight-
ing, it is necessary to scale the metrics with a constant factor for each modulation
scheme. With this correction we are able to have quantization SNR degradation
lower than 0.5 dB. Finally, data is quantized with 5-bit soft values.
8.2.2.2
Deinterleaver
An interleaver/deinterleaver works with address tables where the patterns for all
transmission modes are stored. This approach facilitates rapid change of interleaving
patterns corresponding data modes. Data shows up burstwise with soft bits from
four sub-carriers in parallel. Since 64-QAM is the highest modulation scheme, up to
24 bits are stored per cycle in memory. The deinterleaver also performs depuncturing
of the code stream by stufﬁng zeros. Therefore, a much more ﬂexible puncturing
scheme can be implemented, which is not limited to simple repetitive patterns.

224
60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
8.2.2.3
Viterbi Decoder
In order to process 1 Gbps throughput, we used 12 Viterbi decoders, each of which
can process data at a maximum rate of 100 Mbps or one output bit per cycle. A
block diagram of the Viterbi decoder implementation is shown in Figure 8.8. The
main area consumption results from the ﬁrst block which gets the two metrics of
one source bit per cycle as input data, performs the path metric calculations, and
decides which 32 paths out of 64 are survivor paths. The path decisions are stored
simultaneously in two dual port block RAMs which are called trellis memory. On
the opposite side, two logical blocks perform the tracebacks. In the normal case, a
traceback is accomplished over 96 steps to deliver 48 output bits. The design does
not require any waiting cycles. Hence the throughput is half a source bit per cycle
per traceback unit and the total throughput is one bit per cycle.
A signiﬁcant reduction in complexity comes from the fact that no maximum path
metric has to be calculated and tracebacks can always be performed starting from
the zero state. This can be achieved when sufﬁciently long traceback length is used.
In this case the path from any initial state will converge with very high probability

to the correct path. On the other hand, termination bits at the end of the stream
ensure that the zero state is the ﬁnal state, and with this a priori knowledge the
last traceback can correctly start from this state.
The output bits during one traceback are assembled in reversed order. Therefore,
they are stored in one shift register and copied to another shift register when all bits
are read. Afterwards, they are read out by an output arbiter with 8 bits per cycle.
The output arbiter reads the output of the buffers one after each other. It operates
burstwise in that all bits belonging to a particular traceback have to be read out all
together before moving on to the next unit.
In general, termination of the code stream for the purpose of decision feedback
channel re-estimation can appear anywhere in the frame and the data stream may
be continued afterwards. Therefore the traceback length will vary depending on
the termination. The master block generates commands with complete information
needed for a traceback. These commands are stored in a FIFO memory and read out
by a traceback arbiter which serves the traceback units one after each other. The
combined logic of the master and the traceback and output arbiters ensures that
termination within the stream is properly handled. One traceback unit can never
deliver output data before the other unit is ﬁnished with older data. The output bus
must be at least two bits wide to ensure the correct operation.

OFDM Baseband Transmitter Architecture
The OFDM baseband transmitter is shown in Figure 8.9. Several blocks – the
inverse FFT block, interleaver, and cyclic preﬁx insertion blocks – have almost
identical architectures to those in the OFDM receiver, therefore detailed explana-
tions of each block are not given here. The transmitter occupies 18 K ﬂip-ﬂops,
12 K slices, 41 multipliers and 111 block RAMs including demonstrator interface
logic [13]. Data from a PC is acquired over the input control block. This block
also calculates the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for the signal ﬁeld and initi-
ates the calculation of the number of symbols. Input bit data is distributed to the
32-bit scrambler and then delivered to the symbol mapping block. This modulation

mapping block distributes incoming data bytes with respect to modulation symbols.
It also deﬁnes several related system parameters. If there is a termination, it will
insert a dummy zero byte at the end of the symbol.
From this point, data ﬂow is symbol oriented. Depending on the number of
streams, data from this block is directed to between 1 and 12 convolutional encoders.
Six interleavers running at 100 MHz was used to achieve the transfer data through-
put of 1 Gsps. Therefore, we made an interface that redistributes data coming
from 1–12 encoders into the ﬁxed structure of six interleavers. Interleaved data
is then mapped to the appropriate sub-carriers and pilot symbols are then inserted
to pilot sub-carriers. To achieve 400 Msps effective throughput for OFDM modu-
lation, we parallelized operation of the FFT with four individual 64-FFT blocks as
described in Section 8.2. In the OFDM baseband hardware, each FFT also runs at
the system frequency of 100 MHz. The tail part of data from FFT is duplicated and
inserted as a cyclic preﬁx. Finally, the time-domain OFDM signals are multiplexed
with stored preamble symbols and then transmitted to RF front-ends after digital-
to-analog conversion.

The MAC block is made up of a processor for packet management and an FPGA

baseband part via a low-voltage differential signaling cable. The OFDM baseband
parts were implemented with four Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGAs. Two FPGAs, which
gives larger numbers of logics, were used for OFDM transmitter and receiver.
The OFDM transmitter occupies 30% of one FPGA resource whereas the OFDM
receiver uses 125%. The other smaller FPGA boards were utilized for baseband
ﬁltering, digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital of OFDM baseband signals. The
outputs of two data-converters are connected to 60 GHz RF modules, speciﬁcally
IF I/Q modulator and demodulator, with coaxial cables.
The 60 GHz RF front-end is based on a super-heterodyne transceiver architec-
ture. An IF of 5 GHz is chosen because we used around 500 MHz bandwidth for
one channel and this 5 GHz band is compatible with IEEE 802.11a wireless LAN
standards. It is made up of four silicon chipsets which are a 60 GHz transmitter, a
60 GHz receiver, a 5 GHz I/Q modulator and a 5 GHz I/Q demodulator. They were
fabricated in IHP in-house 0.25 µm SiGe BiCMOS technologies with an fT of
200 GHz. To facilitate the ﬁeld testing of fabricated chips, 60 GHz transmitter and
receiver boards were designed with Rogers 3003 material 5 mm thick. A 60 GHz
Vivaldi antenna was designed and integrated into these boards. It provides more
than 8 dBi gain with the HPBW of 30◦and 3 dB bandwidth larger than 7 GHz. All
fabricated chips and boards are based on differential design. Figure 8.11 shows a
60 GHz transmitter board. The block diagrams for complete 60 GHz RF front-ends
are shown in Figure 8.12. Detailed information on these chipsets and assembly
boards can be found in [14].

throughput was measured at external PCs and a data rate greater than 500 Mbps
was obtained when only Ethernet links were applied. Bit error rate (BER) and FER
were measured with a counter unit embedded on baseband components in order to
characterize full-link performance. No frame error was observed when they were
tested with direct connection links.
Afterward, the implemented basebands were connected to the developed 60 GHz
analog front-ends and tested for 60 GHz link transmission in practical indoor envi-
ronments. Figure 8.13(a) shows the test setup in an indoor ofﬁce environment. As
can be observed, the test environment did not exclude previously installed objects
such as furniture, desks and cubicle walls, which introduce multi-path fading. Nev-
ertheless, no frame error was observed over a 15 m 60 GHz link when the OFDM
baseband operated at the mode of BPSK with 1/2 coding rate giving a 120 Mbps
data rate [11]. The result conﬁrmed that the developed OFDM baseband worked
well and the included receiver functions are effective in the 60 GHz links inﬂuenced

by practical multi-path fading and RF impairments. For transmission of the QPSK
with 1/2 coding rate over 15 m distance, less than 10% FER was obtained, which is
usually required in most of wireless LAN standards. Higher-order modulation such
as 16-QAM was also possible while retaining less than 10% FER, but the maxi-
mum transmission distance was limited below 2 m. Previous simulations indicated
that 16-QAM transmission with 1/2 coding would be possible over more than 3 m
distance as long as an LOS link was maintained. The discrepancy is attributed to
additional impairments arising from channels and RF non-idealities.
To demonstrate real-time video transmission, it is necessary to have bidirectional
links for control signaling. Full duplex 60 GHz bidirectional links were realized
by using two pairs of 60 GHz analog front-ends with frequency division. This was
demonstrated at the International Conference on Communications 2009 (ICC 09)
in Dresden, Germany.

Next-Generation OFDM Demonstrators for 60 GHz Wireless
LAN Applications
The OFDM baseband processor developed within the WIGWAM project was
designed to support a maximum of 1 Gbps with a channel bandwidth of 400 MHz

230
60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
for point-to-point applications. Nowadays, 60 GHz systems require far higher data
throughput and wider coverage for various wireless applications. For example,
uncompressed high-deﬁnition video transmission in 60 GHz requires a data rate of
approximately 4 Gbps with 10 m transmission distance [15]. The IEEE 802.11ad
task group is currently developing a standard for 60 GHz wireless LAN applications
which speciﬁes 1 Gbps throughput with extended coverage, supporting wireless
LAN usage cases [16]. To meet such requirements imposed on 60 GHz systems,
next-generation OFDM baseband is being developed with newly designed physical
layers within the EASY-A project. The target application is multi-gigabit 60 GHz
wireless LAN systems being addressed by the IEEE 802.11ad task group. This
section brieﬂy introduces the system and physical layer design of a next-generation
OFDM demonstrator.
8.5.1
Channel Plan and RF Transceiver
New OFDM physical layers and RF transceivers have been designed to support
wideband and narrowband channel plans [14]. To ensure good coexistence with
legacy 60 GHz devices (e.g. IEEE 802.15.3c), the wideband channel plan is kept
as deﬁned in the 60 GHz standards. It is illustrated in Figure 8.14 as labeled W1
to W4. Between 57 and 66 GHz, four independent channels are deﬁned, centred
on 58.32, 60.48, 62.64 and 64.80 GHz (see Chapter 6). Each channel allows the
maximum 2160 MHz channel bandwidth. To support the channel plan, we designed
a PLL with a crystal oscillator of 19.2 MHz [17].
As illustrated in Figure 8.14, one wideband channel can be divided into three
or four independent narrowband channels as long as centre frequencies can be
generated from the same PLL. This narrowband channel plan is particularly suited
for wireless LAN systems where one access point needs to accommodate a larger
number of simultaneous user devices. The division into four narrowband channels
makes it possible to use 12 channels over a 7 GHz bandwidth, which is almost
comparable to IEEE 802.11a standards supporting 12 channels in the 5 GHz band.

Figure 8.15 shows a block diagram for the next-generation 60 GHz transceiver
architecture. It is based on a sliding IF architecture where a 12 GHz IF band is
generated from 48 GHz LO by frequency division. Because it eliminates the use of
an additional crystal oscillator and PLL for IF conversion, lower power consumption
and easier integration can be expected while maintaining the merits of a super-
heterodyne scheme. We also leave out an image rejection ﬁlter by incorporating
higher IF (12 GHz) with the frequency-selective response of 60 GHz components.
8.5.2
Next-Generation Multi-Gbps OFDM Physical Layers
Two OFDM physical layers are designed for wideband and narrowband channel
plans and will be implemented on FPGA platform [18]. The sampling frequencies
for wideband and narrowband OFDM modes are 2160 and 540 MHz, respectively.
Both frequencies can easily be generated from the PLL architecture used for the gen-
eration of RF center frequencies. For quick hardware implementation, we decided
the sampling frequency for the wideband scheme considering commercially avail-
able ADCs supporting higher than 6-bit resolution. Table 8.3 summarizes timing
parameters for both wideband and narrowband OFDM modes.

In the both OFDM modes, sub-carrier spacing, cyclic preﬁx, FFT period and
OFDM symbol time are kept the same so as to have full compatibility with each
other. To minimize SNR loss less than 1 dB, we have a guard interval of a quarter of
the FFT symbol time, which is TG = 118.5 ns. Compared to the OFDM parameters
previously developed, the new OFDM physical layer is less susceptible to phase
noise but a little more sensitive to channel delay spread. Each mode supports dif-
ferent transmission rates with the modulations from BPSK to 64-QAM with various
coding rates.
To obtain higher coding gain than the previous one utilizing convolutional
code, two different channel coding approaches are considered. One is to apply
Reed–Solomon channel coding as the outer code since it improves the coding
gain of the convolutional inner code without sacriﬁcing hardware complexity and
code rate signiﬁcantly. The Reed–Solomon (255, 253) code speciﬁed in the IEEE
802.15.3c standard is used for this purpose [1]. The other approach is to employ
a low-density parity check (LDPC) code due to its its higher coding gain. We
use the (768, 384) LDPC code speciﬁed in IEEE 802.16e standard because of its
block length ﬁtted to the number of OFDM data sub-carriers and its feasibility to
implement on small chip size [19].

Performance Evaluation with 60GHz NLOS Channel and 60GHz
Phase Noise Models

channel and 60 GHz phase noise models which were believed to be the most dom-
inant sources of impairments. There are several 60 GHz channel models available
in the IEEE 802.15.3c task group. Among them, we used the NLOS residential
channel model (corresponding to CM2.3) because it was the mandatory channel
model used in the proposal evaluation [20]. The 30◦HPBW antenna was used for
spatial ﬁltering in both transmitter and receiver.
For simulation, hundreds of 2048-byte frames were transmitted and the mean
90% BER link success probability was computed as described [20]. The energy in
guard intervals, pilot carriers and preambles was taken into account for practical
FER simulation. We used all receiver functions, including frame synchronization,
channel estimation/equalization and common phase-error corrections using deﬁned
preambles and pilot carriers [A]. The performance of a wideband OFDM physical
layer for 60 GHz residential NLOS model is presented in Figure 8.16. No error
ﬂoor is observed in the required 10% FER. We also compared it with practical case
where phase noise is applied. The single sideband phase noise value of LSSB =
−93 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset was applied for simulation. We found that a frame error
rate of 10% was achieved at an Eb/N0 of 13.2 dB. Less than 0.5 dB degradation
was observed for QPSK and 16-QAM modulations.

60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
From the previous demonstrator, it was also noticed that interleaving schemes
improve performance under NLOS channel environments. For convolutional codes,
tone interleaving is required to spread adjacent coded bits over the whole spectrum.
In addition, adjacent coded bits should have alternating bit reliability when they are
mapped on M-ary QAM symbols. The standard permutation deﬁned in the IEEE
802.11a standard meets both requirements. The permutation rule is given below in
slightly different notation:
Nblock = ND · m, Nround = ND/SC,
bit = m · SC,
s = max(m/2, 1),
p(k) = bit · (kmodNround) + ⌊k/Nround⌋,
q(p) = s · ⌊p/s⌋+ ((p + Nblock −⌊Nround · p/Nblock⌋) mod s).
The ﬁrst permutation rule completely ﬁlls Nround sub-carriers which lie on a grid
with the step size of SC before the next of such a cycle group is processed in
the same way. The only free parameter of this interleaver is the step size of SC.
We therefore write the permutation as a function of the input index and step size
of SC:
y = q(p(x)) ≡f (x, SC),
Choosing a very short step size results in small distances between adjacent coded
bits, which might be lower than the coherence bandwidth of the channel. Very large
step sizes result in small groups. Both cases lead to violation of the assumption
of statistically independent bit errors, which degrades interleaving performance. An
optimum step size can be found with maximizing code performance. We added the
third permutation to this standard interleaver, which enables longer groups without
the penalty of a small step size. It is called a folded interleaver. An additional
free parameter, the folding factor Nf old, provides a wider range of permutation
schemes [21]:
y = f (x, SC/Nf old),
Nblock = ND · m/Nf old,
N1 = m · SC/Nf old,
N2 = m · SC,
z = y mod N1 + ⌊(y mod Nblock)/N1)⌋· N2 + N1 · ⌊y/Nblock⌋.
Convolutional coding performance is investigated for the IEEE 802.11a stan-
dard interleaver and the folded interleaver with various interleaving parameters.
Figure 8.17 shows the performance comparison for different interleaving parame-
ters. It is observed that the two folded interleaving schemes slightly outperform the
standard interleaver with the best parameters. The performance gain is approx-
imately 0.5 dB at a BER of 10−5 and it should be noted that it comes at no
additional expense.

To achieve higher throughput, the preamble length is shortened from 11 OFDM
symbols in the previous case to 6.6 symbols. This was possible with the help of the
improved channel estimation scheme which makes it possible to reduce the length
of preamble from 4 symbols to 2. In 60 GHz channels, the channel impulse response
length is usually much shorter than the FFT length. The proposed scheme is to ﬁlter
out the estimated channel impulse responses far away from actual channel impulse
responses, which are likely to be just noise in channel estimation. This potentially
gives channel smoothing functions in the frequency domain. The initial estimates for
the channel coefﬁcients Hn are obtained by averaging two long preamble symbols.
From these estimates, the mean phase φ increase from one sub-carrier to next
is estimated with a phase unwrapping scheme [21]. Then channel coefﬁcients are
rotated to attain zero phase progression. In this way, the corresponding impulse
response is shifted in the time domain, so that the main energy impulse response
can be located at zero time:
Gn = Hn · exp(−jφ · n).
After this rotation, a ﬁlter convolution in the frequency domain is applied, which
provides low-pass ﬁlter function in the time domain. The effect of this ﬁlter Bn is to
attenuate the aforementioned noise components far away from the channel impulse
response:
Kn = Gn ⊗Bn.

Medium Access Control Design
Harkirat Singh
The medium access control (MAC) protocols control the access rights of the shared
medium. In a half-duplex wireless channel, a node cannot sense the channel while
transmitting a frame. Therefore, an efﬁcient MAC protocol becomes necessary.
Since collisions cannot be detected by the transmitter, a typical MAC scheme
attempts to decrease the probability of a collision using collision avoidance prin-
ciples. For instance, in IEEE 802.11, a device wishing to access the channel ﬁrst
senses the medium to determine if it is idle. If so, the device waits an additional,
randomly selected, period of time and then transmits if the medium is still free.
However, if it is determined that the channel is busy, the device may enter into
a random backoff period and wait until transmission stops. This prevents multiple
devices seizing the medium immediately after completion of preceding transmis-
sion. Such carrier sensing based MAC schemes rely on an omnidirectional antenna
that receives and transmits radio frequency (RF) energy equally in all directions.
While omnidirectional antenna patterns assist an efﬁcient medium access, they cre-
ate undesired interference at some of the other devices.
The 60 GHz band provides an extremely short wavelength of 5 millimeters that
reduces the antenna size signiﬁcantly. Now it becomes feasible to mount a large
array of antenna elements (or directional antennas) on a node. Directional antennas
provide some advantages over omnidirectional antennas. For example, directional
antennas radiate more energy in smaller zones, giving some beneﬁts in terms of
reducing unwanted interference provided that the intended power is directed towards
the desired users. This also helps in improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the
intended receiver. In addition, directional antennas increase network throughput via
spatial reuse, thus allowing more simultaneous transmissions when compared with

omnidirectional antennas. Figure 9.1 illustrates a scenario of the increased spatial
reuse capability provided by directional antennas. Nodes a and c have packets for
nodes b and d, respectively. If a and c transmit simultaneously using omnidirec-
tional antennas then the frames will collide, and both the nodes will perform a
random backoff and try to retransmit independently in the future. However, using
directional antennas, a and c can successfully transmit data packets simultaneously.
Nevertheless, directional antennas brings new challenges for the MAC design. For
example, nodes with directional antennas may not be able to receive in all directions,
and therefore, may miss control and/or data frames from some other directions.
In this chapter, the challenges of MAC layer design in the presence of directional
antennas are discussed. In order to support multi-gigabit data rate at the MAC
service access point, MAC efﬁciency should be targeted at 80% and beyond. A
number of techniques to improve the MAC service access point efﬁciency such as
a large packet size (of the order of hundreds of kilobytes), data aggregation, block-
ACK and automatic repeat request (ARQ), are addressed. Finally, MAC design
considerations for supporting uncompressed video are detailed.
9.1
Design Issues in the Use of Directional Antennas
In this section we enumerate issues that arise at the MAC layer due to the use of
directional antennas. One of the prominent artifacts that directional antennas creates
is deafness, whereby neighboring nodes are hidden from each other not only due to
distance separation, but also because of differences in the orientation of directional
antenna beams. Therefore, device discovery becomes challenging in the presence of

directional (or beamformed) transmissions. Identifying the neighbors is necessary
before two devices can communicate with each other.
Figure 9.2 illustrates some of the hidden terminal and deafness problems that may
occur in the presence of directional antennas. Here, node e is a one-hop neighbor
of node a, and nodes c and d are one-hop neighbors of node b. Assume that node
a is sending data to node b. Consider the following cases:
• c wants to transmit to b. In this case, c will send a request to send (RTS) frame (as
in IEEE 802.11) to b since c senses no activity on the channel. Given that b has
a linear antenna array, the beam pattern at b is oriented towards a and prohibits
b receiving from c. Assuming that a is sending a large amount of data to b, c
may make multiple retransmission attempts that cause a large backoff window
at c. Suppose that the transmission from a to b ﬁnishes at a certain point. Node
c would have started transmitting to b immediately, had it known that b would
be free to receive new packets. However, because c does not know this by the
current network protocol, c has to wait and decrement the backoff unnecessarily.
Thus, directional transmissions not only create unwanted interference at b from
c, but also waste channel resources in some cases. These problems do not arise
when the nodes use omnidirectional antennas.
• d wants to transmit to b. This case is similar to when c wants to transmit to b.
• Nodes c and d are hidden from a due to directional transmissions and e is hidden
from b due to distance separation.
Ko et al. [2] solve the deafness problem by using a combination of omnidirectional
and directional RTS and clear to send (CTS). They assume that the gain of the
directional antenna equals that of the omnidirectional antenna. The antenna model
is assumed to be a sectored antenna which can transmit in 90◦sectors only. Hence,
such an antenna system requires four antenna elements to cover all directions. Two
different schemes are evaluated.

242
60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
The ﬁrst scheme consists of a sequence of directional RTS (DRTS), omnidirec-
tional CTS (OCTS), directional data (DDTA) and directional ACK (DACK). The
control packets (RTS/CTS) contain the physical location information of the sender
and the receiver. The physical location information may be obtained by the global
positioning system (GPS). Assume that node x has a packet for node y, and node
a is the previous-hop neighbor of x. Since a cannot hear DRTSs from x, hence, it
is free to send its own DRTS to x. A DRTS from a to x may interfere with the
reception of OCTS or ACK control packets sent by y to x. Therefore, this scheme
has a high probability of control packet collisions in some cases.
The second scheme alleviates the problem of a higher number of collisions by
transmitting a combination of DRTS and omnidirectional RTS (ORTS). A node
keeps track of its blocked directional antennas, which remain blocked for the dura-
tion of the packet received on that particular antenna sector – the duration of transfer
is included in each control packet such as RTS and CTS (as in IEEE 802.11). Hence,
x will send an ORTS if none of its directional antennas at x are blocked; otherwise,
x will send a DRTS provided that the desired directional antenna is not blocked. The
ﬁrst scheme allows multiple simultaneous transmissions at the cost of higher prob-
ability of collisions of control packets; the second scheme reduces the possibility
of such collisions at the cost of reduced spatial reuse of the channel.
Nasipuri et al. [3] propose an MAC protocol that uses directional antennas where
mobile nodes do not have any location information. Each node is equipped with M
directional antenna elements. Each of the antenna elements has a conical pattern,
spanning an angle of 2π/M radians. The M antennas at each node are ﬁxed with
non-overlapping beam directions so as to collectively span the entire plane. The
MAC protocol is assumed to be capable of switching any one or all the antennas
to active or passive modes. In this work the authors assume that all the antennas
have the same gain. The protocol uses omnidirectional transmission of the RTS/CTS
control packets. The receiver uses selection diversity – that is, the receiver uses the
signal from the antenna that is receiving maximum signal strength. The receiver
records the antenna that received the maximum signal power, and thus the receiver
also identiﬁes the direction of the maximum signal power. The sender uses this infor-
mation to directionally transmit the data packet followed by directional exchange of
the acknowledgement (ACK). The proposed solution alleviates the deafness problem
at the cost of poor spatial reuse.
In order to efﬁciently perform collision avoidance, the IEEE 802.11 (2007) pro-
tocol [4] does both virtual and physical carrier sensing before transmitting a packet.
Each transmitted packet has a duration ﬁeld that indicates how long the remaining
transmission will be. So, the overhearing nodes can remain silent for this duration.
The overhearing node records this value in a variable called the network allocation
vector (NAV). When a node has data to send, it ﬁrst looks at the NAV. If its value

Medium Access Control Design
243
is not zero, the node determines that the medium is busy. This is called virtual
carrier sensing. Takai et al. [5] extend the NAV usage to the environment where
nodes are equipped with directional antennas. The new protocol is called directional
virtual carrier sensing (DVCS). A node caches direction of arrival (DOA) informa-
tion based on signals received, and nodes remain in promiscuous mode to cache
signals. In DVCS a node transmits four directional RTSs and the remaining three as
omnidirectional RTSs if there is no response to the directional RTSs. The proposed
scheme achieves good spatial reuse. Choudhury et al. [6] propose directional MAC
(DMAC), which also aims to maximize the spatial reuse, and suggest that all MAC
layer operations should be performed directionally. However, these protocols do
not solve the deafness problem.
ElBatt et al. [7] introduce the interesting idea of blocked and unblocked beams.
They propose to modify RTS/CTS packets by including the beam index on which
the ensuing data packet will be sent. The RTS/CTS packets are transmitted on all
unblocked beams. A node lying in the coverage of a blocked beam would be left
unaware of the attempted reservation. This leads to a deafness problem. To solve
this problem they send another set of RTS/CTS packets on blocked beams on a
different frequency than the one used for sensing reservation frames on unblocked
channels. Thus each node needs to be equipped with two radios to overcome with
deafness problem. Directional hidden terminals still remain a problem in [7].
Korakis et al. [8] solve the deafness problem by emulating an omnidirectional
RTS by transmitting it sequentially multiple times using directional beams. If a
node requires M beams to cover 360◦then the node will transmit the RTS control
frame M times. The destination node replies with a single directional CTS frame.
Note that in a scenario where the chances of spatial reuse are limited (e.g. linear
network), such a scheme will not be of much help. Moreover, in such scenarios
increasing the number of antenna elements will reduce the beamwidth and will
negatively affect the throughput performance.
Choudhury and Vaidya [9] address the deafness problem by transmitting an out-of-
band tone omnidirectionally following the completion of data transmission between
two nodes. Out-of-band tones act as a corrective method for nodes that suffer from
deafness by terminating the backoff if the address of the tone originator matches
with the intended receiver that caused the node to invoke repeated backoffs. The
proposed scheme does not solve the directional hidden terminal problem in the
presence of missed RTS/CTS.
In summary, directional transmissions help in boosting the overall system
throughput, but result in deafness and directional hidden terminal problems that, if
not corrected, can easily offset the beneﬁts of directional transmissions. In the next
section, we present changes to the IEEE 802.15.3 MAC to deal with directional
60 GHz transmissions.

IEEE 802.15.3c MAC for 60 GHz
IEEE 802.15.3 (2005) [10] provides a time division multiple access (TDMA) based
MAC protocol for a wireless personal area network (WPAN) that operates in rel-
atively short distances, about 10 meters. In IEEE 802.15.3, a piconet coordinator
(PNC) periodically sends beacons that disseminate various details about the super-
frame such as beacon interval, contention access period (CAP), and contention free
period, i.e. channel time allocation (CTA). The beacon also helps in maintaining
time synchronization in the WPAN. In contrast to contention based MAC proto-
cols, TDMA based protocols are well suited for 60 GHz directional transmission to
overcome the deafness and neighbor discover issues presented in Section 9.1. In
this section we investigate the changes made by IEEE 802.15.3c (2009) [11] to the
IEEE 802.15.3 MAC in order to deal with 60 GHz directional transmission.
9.2.1
Neighbor Discovery
IEEE 802.15.3c (2009) [11] provides a simple neighbor discovery for PNC based
WPANs. Suppose that a PNC has PT X transmit antennas and PRX receive antennas
such that it can transmit and receive in PT X and PRX directions, respectively.
Similarly, a device1 has DT X transmit antennas and DRX receive antennas. The PNC
transmits quasi-omni (Q-omni) beacons PT X times, sending each repetition with
one of the PT X antennas to enable devices located in different angular directions
to join the same piconet, as shown in Figure 9.3. The device listens to the Q-omni
beacons in all DRX directions to ﬁnd the best and the second best direction pair
based on the link quality indicator, for example SNR. The device compares at least
PT X × DRX pairs before deciding the best and second best pair. Afterwards, the
device informs the PNC about its best transmit direction in the association command
transmitted during the association sub-CAP (S-CAP). Notice that in IEEE 802.15.3
a single CAP is used for omnidirectional transmissions and receptions, but IEEE
802.15.3c divides the single CAP into multiple S-CAPs, each aligned with PRX
receive directions at the PNC. Therefore, at least PRX S-CAPs are required for the
PNC to discover all possible neighbors. For the symmetric antenna system (SAS)
case the transmit direction at the PNC (or at a device) is used for signal reception
as well. In such scenarios PT X = PRX and DT X = DRX. A device, upon receiving
the best Q-omni beacon from the PNC in the DRX direction, replies with a response
during an S-CAP with the same index as the PNC’s optimal transmit beam PT X for
the Q-omni beacon. However, in the asymmetric antenna system (AAS) case, where
transmit directions are different from receive directions (PT X ̸= PRX), a device does
not know the optimum receive direction at the PNC even after ﬁnding the optimal

changeably in this chapter.

Q-omni beacon (i.e. PT X ). Therefore, a device needs to transmit the association
request command at different DT X antennas during the association S-CAP until the
PNC replies with the association response command.
The amount of time required to complete one round of neighbor discovery scales
with the number of antennas at the PNC as well as the maximum number of
antennas for the devices. A two-stage neighbor discovery could be used to optimize
the neighbor discovery period [11] that is discussed in Section 4.2. The ﬁrst stage
includes coarse-level neighbor discovery and the second stage performs a ﬁne-
level discovery within the discovered coarse-level direction. Since the coarse-level
discovery process uses a wider beamwidth antenna pattern (or a wider directional
sector), the amount of time required to cover 360◦space is far less than when a
narrower beamwidth is used.
9.2.2
Aggregation and Block-ACK
IEEE 802.11n provides two kinds of aggregation schemes. In the aggregate MAC
service data unit (A-MSDU) scheme, multiple MSDUs are aggregated in one MAC
frame, typically at the top of the MAC layer. In the aggregate MAC protocol data
unit (A-MPDU) scheme, multiple MPDUs are aggregated in one MAC frame at the
bottom of the MAC layer. The aggregated frame is forwarded to the physical layer
(PHY) for transmission. One potential drawback of these aggregation schemes is
that individual MSDUs cannot be retransmitted since the minimum retransmission

unit is a single MPDU. Another signiﬁcant limitation is that MSDUs in the aggre-
gated frame cannot be coded differently using a different modulation and coding
sequence (MCS).
The aggregation scheme in IEEE 802.15.3c overcomes the aforementioned draw-
backs by allowing retransmissions of individual MSDUs and allowing different
coding rates for aggregated MSDUs. IEEE 802.15.3c provides three aggregation
modes, namely, standard aggregation, low-latency aggregation, and audio video
(AV) aggregation presented next.
9.2.2.1
Standard Aggregation
This may be used for aggregating high speed data and AV. Figure 9.4 illustrates the
standard aggregation at the source. An MSDU may be mapped to one or more sub-
frame payloads. A subframe header (SH) is created for each valid subframe payload.
The SH contains the necessary information for the destination device to accurately
retrieve the original data by deaggregating the received MPDU. The MSDU number
of the ﬁrst subframe is placed in the MSDU number ﬁeld of the MAC header. The

MSDU number for a subsequent subframe is represented by its offset relative to
the ﬁrst subframe. Besides MCS, the SH ﬁeld also includes the subframe length,
MSDU fragmentation indication, retransmission indication, and frame checksum
(FCS) ﬂag. Since at most eight subframes can be aggregated in one MPDU, the
eight SHs are combined together and placed in the MAC subheader as shown in
Figure 9.4. For an MPDU containing less than eight subframes, the subframe length
in the corresponding SH is set to zero to indicate that the subframe payload is not
present. Standard aggregation supports both unidirectional and bidirectional data
transmission by aggregating ACK information with data. For unidirectional trans-
mission, the destination device upon receiving an aggregated MPDU replies with
the block-ACK appropriately set in the MAC subheader (Figure 9.5) to indicate
the status of each subframe. Since no data is included in the aggregated frame
for unidirectional transmission, the subframe length ﬁeld in all eight SHs is set to
zero to indicate that no data is aggregated. For bidirectional data transmission, the
destination device aggregates the block-ACK with data in subframe payloads, if any.

248
60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
A destination device performs deaggregation process to correctly extract received
MSDUs. After receiving a physical layer convergence procedure (PLCP) protocol
data unit, the destination device checks the aggregation type indicated in the PHY
header as shown in Figure 9.5. Later, the HCS ﬁelds are validated to verify the
correctness of MAC header and subheader. The MAC header and subheader ﬁelds
are coded using the most robust MCS to minimize the likelihood of errors in these
ﬁelds since an incorrect HCS would need to discard the whole MAC frame. Based on
the information in the eight SHs, the destination device validates each subframe by
the corresponding FCS. The MSDU number is generated by adding up the offset to
the MSDU number in the MAC header. The fragmentation ﬁeld in the SH facilitates
in properly defragmenting the subframe payload(s) to re-create the original MSDU.
9.2.2.2
Low-Latency Aggregation
This aggregation mode is suitable for applications requiring low-latency bidirec-
tional communication such as USB, PCI Express, and wireless docking. The PHY
header at the source device is set to indicate the low-latency aggregation mode.
The source and destination stations negotiate the desired bidirectional CTA relin-
quish duration by exchanging the CTA relinquish duration information element. The
source station may aggregate zero-length data in case no MSDU (data) is available
at the source station from the end of the current CTA relinquished period to the
start of the next CTA. The source station may also aggregate zero-length data when
no periodic MSDU is available in a bidirectional CTA.
As shown in Figure 9.6, the source MAC layer attaches an MSDU SH to each
MSDU received from the higher layer. The MSDU SH ﬁeld contains a MSDU
number that uniquely identiﬁes a MSDU in the series of MSDUs delivered to the
destination device. The subframe length ﬁeld contains the length of a subframe. If
periodic data is not present then a zero subframe length idle data is aggregated. The
zero-length MSDU sequence number is assigned to the most recent acknowledged
sequence number at the source. The MSDU response number ﬁeld in the MAC SH
indicates the ﬁrst MSDU sequence number of the transmitted block-ACK bitmap
ﬁeld. The MSDU response number ﬁeld is used to generate the offset for the block-
ACK bitmap ﬁeld. The MSDU request number ﬁeld indicates the most recent MSDU
sequence number acknowledged at the transmitter.
A destination device validates the MSDU SH HCS ﬁeld for each MSDU SH.
If the HCS is not valid, the destination device then searches for a valid MSDU
SH HCS until one is found by matching a valid MSDU HCS. Once a match is
found, the destination device then checks the validity of the FCS ﬁeld computed
over the expected subframe length payload. If the MSDU is incorrectly received
then the corresponding bit is set to zero in the next transmitted block-ACK bitmap
ﬁeld according to its order offset from the MSDU response number ﬁeld as shown in

Figure 9.6. The source and destination devices interchange roles of data transmission
and reception during the CTA every bidirectional CTA relinquish duration or less
by using the IEEE 802.15.3 CTA relinquish method [10] that allows another device
to transmit data in a given CTA. In the low-latency mode at most 256 subframes
may be aggregated in one aggregated frame.
9.2.2.3
AV Aggregation
The AV aggregation for the high-rate PHY (HRP) in the AV OFDM is optimized
to carry uncompressed audio and video in an efﬁcient manner. At most seven
subframes may be aggregated in one aggregated frame. As shown in Figure 9.7, the
extended MAC header includes the MAC extension header, security header, and
video header. The MAC extension header ﬁeld includes the type and ACK group
ﬁelds. The type ﬁeld indicates the type of data in the subframe. The valid values
for the type ﬁeld are: MAC command, Data, Audio, and Video. The ACK group
is used to map seven subframes to ﬁve ACK bits. Therefore, at most ﬁve FCS
ﬁelds are added to seven subframes. A new ACK group is started when the bit
in the ACK group corresponding to the subframe is set to zero. However, the bit
for the subframe is set to one if the subframe is part of the previous ACK group.
Thus, the ﬁrst bit in the ACK group ﬁeld, corresponding to the ﬁrst subframe, is
always set to zero. Also, the total number of bits set to zero can be at most ﬁve.

Figure 9.7 presents a case where subframes 1–3 are mapped to the ﬁrst ACK group.
The remaining four subframes (4–7) are each uniquely mapped to each of the four
ACK groups, respectively. In this example, the ACK group ﬁeld is set to “0110000”.
A checksum is computed for each ACK group and stored in the FCS ﬁeld.
In AV aggregation, video subframes are neither aggregated nor fragmented; it
is therefore possible to have one-to-one mapping between video MSDUs and the
corresponding subframes. For each video MSDU, the video header contains video
related information. At most four video subframes may be aggregated in one aggre-
gated MAC frame since the total number of video control ﬁelds in the video header

is ﬁxed and set to four as shown in Figure 9.7. The H-position and V-position ﬁelds
contain the horizontal and vertical positions (in the video frame) of the ﬁrst pixel
in the subframe, respectively. The video frame number ﬁeld contains a counter that
keeps track of the video frame to which the pixels in the subframe belong. For pro-
gressive video, the video frame number is incremented sequentially. For interlaced
video, the video frame number is incremented in steps of two. Therefore, each video
frame has two frame numbers such that the video frames belonging to the ﬁrst ﬁeld
have even frame numbers and the video frames belonging to the second ﬁeld have
odd frame numbers. Since the MAC header is coded using the most robust MCS,
the error rate for the video header, which is included in the MAC header, is lower
than the video subframe payload.
The PHY header always contains seven subframe headers irrespective of the
availability of the corresponding subframe payloads. The length ﬁeld indicates the
length of the corresponding subframe payload. If a subframe payload is not present
then the length ﬁeld is set to zero. The HRP mode index ﬁeld represents the MCS
used for the subframe. The possible values available for the HRP mode index are
shown in Table 5.5 in Section 5.3.4. The PHY control ﬁeld contains an unequal
error protection (UEP) ﬁeld that together with the HRP mode index can be used to
differentiate between UEP-by-mapping and UEP-by-coding modes. We will discuss
UEP in more detail later.
The standard, low-latency and AV aggregation schemes are summarized in
Table 9.1.

subframes in the previously received MAC frame by sending a block-ACK bitmap.
For the two-checksum case, the nth MSB ﬁeld indicates the status of the MSB
portion of the nth subframe and the nth LSB ﬁeld indicates the status of the LSB
portion of the nth subframe. However, in the one-checksum case, one bit in the
block-ACK represents the status of both MSB and LSB portions of a subframe.
9.3
Design Considerations for Supporting Uncompressed Video
In data communications, all bits are equally important; hence, they should be equally
protected.2 In contrast, in uncompressed video streams, some bits are more impor-
tant than others. For instance, compared to the LSB, the MSB of a color pixel has
the maximum impact on the video quality [13]. Therefore, bits can be treated dif-
ferently and it is not always necessary to deliver all bits with the same error control
scheme. UEP provides a way to protect bits in the order of their importance. The
bit error rate (BER) for high-importance bits is much lower. Numerous studies in
the past have shown the beneﬁts of using UEP at the PHY in the context of com-
pressed video [14]. In addition, uncompressed video streams contain rich spatial
redundancy, which can be used to overcome some pixel errors.
We have developed a system using the IEEE 802.15.3c AV OFDM mode for sup-
porting uncompressed video streaming over 60 GHz wireless networks, as shown
in Figure 9.8 [1]. The application layer at the video source implements pixel parti-
tioning such that pixels with minimal spatial distance (i.e. neighboring pixels) are
placed in different video packets. If a video packet retransmission is corrupted,
then the receiver recovers the error using pixel information in other received pack-
ets containing neighboring pixels. As a result, further retransmission of corrupted
pixels is not required. The MAC layer uses the AV aggregation mode to aggregate
multiple video packets into one MAC frame. For each video packet, the MAC layer
supports two CRC ﬁelds: MSB and LSB CRCs.
At the physical layer, information bits are ﬁrst scrambled to randomize the input
sequence. Then the four MSBs are parsed into the ﬁrst data path, and the second
four LSBs are parsed into the second data path. On each data path, Reed–Solomon
(RS) and convolutional codes are concatenated to protect the information bits. We
consider RS code (224, 216, t = 4) with Hamming distance dmin = 2t + 1 [15].
We assume a color depth (i.e. the number of bits per color component) of 8 bits.
However, the proposed system can be easily extended to other video streams using
a deeper color depth (i.e. 12- or 16-bit color).

The two bitstreams are of different importance; the MSB bitstream carries more
critical information in maintaining the high deﬁnition (HD) video quality, while the
LSB bitstream carries less critical information in maintaining the HD video quality.
Therefore, in comparison to the LSB data path, the MSB data path is strongly
protected, which allows better error protection for the MSB portion of video pixels.
At the receiver, an RS code based error concealment scheme (RSS) is used to
overcome pixel errors. Finally, the PHY layer is equipped with array antennas
which allows beamforming towards a desired angular direction to maximize the
signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio. The following subsections present a detailed
description of the modules developed for supporting uncompressed video streaming.
9.3.1
Pixel Partitioning
In a typical uncompressed video stream, geographically neighboring (spatially cor-
related) pixels usually have very similar – or even the same – values. This kind of
spatial redundancy is exploited such that pixels with minimal spatial distance are
partitioned into different video packets. Figure 9.9 shows a diagrammatical example

of pixel partitioning and packetizing scheme in which four neighboring pixels are
partitioned into four video packets. If one video packet is corrupted, then one or
more other packets that contain pixels that are spatially related to the corrupted
pixel(s) can be used to recover or compensate for the corrupted pixel information.
9.3.2
Uncompressed Video ARQ
Wireless systems designed for data communication send a packet with a checksum
appended. The receiver recomputes the checksum. If an error is detected by failed
checksum, the receiver requests the retransmission of the whole packet. It is possible
that a chunk of bits are correctly received; however, the sender retransmits another
copy of the whole packet.
The uncompressed video ARQ (UV-ARQ) protocol improves upon this by using
two bits per video packet in the ACK to indicate the status of both MSB and LSB
portions. If the MSB portion is received correctly, then the retransmission is not
solicited. Otherwise, a robust modulation and coding mode (MSB only, as shown in
Table 5.5) is used to reliably retransmit the MSB portion only. Figure 9.10 illustrates
the functioning of the UV-ARQ, which can be summarized as follows:
• The sender appends multiple CRCs per video packet, and transmits the packet to
the receiver.
• The receiver recomputes checksum for the MSB and LSB portions. The receiver
signals to the sender concerning the status of the MSB and LSB portions.

• If the MSB portion is correctly received then the sender skips the retransmission
of the LSB portion as shown in Figure 9.10 (LSB error case). Otherwise, the
sender retransmits the MSB portion only using the MSB only (MSB error case).
• Since the same time is granted to retransmit the MSB portion as for the original
video packet, a reduced rate modulation index can strongly protect the retrans-
mitted MSB portion against channel errors by proving a higher SNR.
9.3.3
Unequal Error Protection
UEP provides an efﬁcient method to protect bits with different weighting.
Figure 9.11 shows a generalized UEP structure [13]. UEP assumes multiple use of
error control coding blocks, and applies different coding rates ri to multiple input
bitstreams. In fact, multi-Gbps transmission systems inevitably employ parallel
signal processing blocks due to the limit of processing speed, and parallel or
multiple error control coding blocks are natural in the PHY design.
• UEP by coding. A lower coding rate is allocated to more important bits (i.e.
MSBs) and a higher coding rate to less important bits (i.e. LSBs) – for example,
the MSBs (bits 7, 6, 5 and 4) with a lower coding rate than the LSBs (bits 3, 2,
1 and 0). UEP can also be provided by mapping in which some bits are strongly
protected in comparison to other bits in the constellation diagram (see Section 5.3
for more discussion).
• UEP by mapping. Bits mapped onto the I-branch get stronger (unequal) protection
than the bits on the Q-branch. Therefore, the constellation diagram looks like
a rectangle; however, the average energy per symbol remains unaffected (see
Section 5.3 for more discussion).

In both UEP modes, the BER performance of MSBs is boosted at the expense
of poor BER for LSBs since the MSB portions are strongly protected. The two
separate CRCs for MSB and LSB portions help in limiting the error concealment to
the erroneous portion of the video packet only. A correctly received portion of the
video packet is forwarded to the higher layers as it is. Figure 9.12 presents the BER
performance of UEP (by mapping) and equal error protection (EEP) modes of AV
OFDM PHY. Notice that there is generally a difference of about 1.5–2 dB between
the MSB performance and the EEP performance, and about 1–2 dB difference
between the EEP performance and LSB performance.
9.3.4
Error Concealment
Uncompressed video requires huge bandwidth for retransmission, therefore an
unlimited number of retries may not be desirable because of additional latency
and buffer requirements at the receiver (i.e. display such as HDTV). We consider
one-time retransmission of MSB portions. If the retransmitted packet is also
corrupted, the receiver invokes an error concealment as presented in [12].

9.3.4.1
RS Code Swap (RSS) Error Concealment Scheme
We use RS codes to conceal some pixel errors. We combine good (i.e., uncorrupted)
RS codes from a corrupted video packet and adjacent partitions to reconstruct the
original video packet. While developing the RSS error concealment scheme, we
consider a cross-layer feedback from the PHY to the MAC.
In the AV OFDM, each video packet consists of 100 RS codes to achieve a
high channel efﬁciency, thus meeting the delay constraints of uncompressed video.
Therefore, the length of each video packet is 21,600 bytes, and one 1920 × 1080p
(HD) frame is evenly divided into 288 video packets. The RS code (224, 216, t = 4)
considered in the 60 GHz system can correct errors of up to 4 symbols (bytes). If
more than 4 symbols are in error, it ﬂags up an uncorrectable codeword. We use this
kind of feedback from the PHY. We consider a cross-layer feedback from the PHY
to MAC such that for each video packet, the PHY (i.e. RS decoder) signals to the
MAC layer those RS codewords received correctly and those in error. Afterwards,
the MAC layer (or the application layer) conceals the effect of failed RS codes
on the video quality. Identiﬁed failed RS codes are replaced with good RS codes
having pixels with minimum spatial variations. For a video packet, if the receiver
detects an error, it takes the following steps:
• Erroneous RS codewords are identiﬁed at the PHY and signaled to the MAC
layer.
• RS codes at the same position in other video packets from the same partition are
used to replace the erroneous RS code. As shown in Figure 9.13, RS code j in
video packet 1 is received in error. One of the RS codes at the same position j,
which carry neighboring pixels, from video packet 2, 3 or 4 is used to replace
the faulty codeword.
• If the previous step could not be successfully completed because none of the
three adjacent partitions had the same indexed RS code correctly received, one
of the adjacent good RS codes within the corrupted packet (e.g. RS code j + 1
or RS code j −1 in video packet 1) is used to replace the erroneous codeword.
In the next step, adjacent RS codes from different partitions are used.
• Finally, if some of the codewords could not be concealed, then display them as
they are.

Performance Study
In this section, the performance of the AV system developed in Section 9.3 is pre-
sented. The ns2-based IEEE 802.15.3 MAC simulator is enhanced by implementing
the new features described in Section 9.3. The PHY layer supports both the UEP
(by mapping) and EEP modes. We consider the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)

video frame. The average PSNR is deﬁned as

(i.e. RGB components of 8 bits each), and the frame rate is 60 Hz. Thus, the
application rate is 3.0 Gbps.
The system uses concatenated RS code with convolutional codes. Since the errors
at the Viterbi decoder are bursty, they tend to present to the RS decoder correlated
symbol errors. From [15] we get the following relation between codeword error
probability (Pw) and bit error probability (Pb):
Pb ≈dmin
n Pw,
(9.3)
where dmin = 9 and n = 224 given the RS code (224, 216, t = 4). In the event of
error, dmin bytes in a codeword are randomly ﬂipped. We evaluate the performance
of the 60 GHz system, presented in the previous section, under random uniform
errors. In the simulation study, video data are coded either UEP or EEP. In both
cases, we consider no retransmissions and resort to the RSS scheme to conceal
pixel errors. While performing the simulation study, we made realistic assumptions
such that given the application rate of 3 Gbps and transmission rate of 3.807 Gbps
(MCS-2 and MCS-4 shown in Table 5.5), approximately 20% extra bandwidth is
available. We assume MAC and other processing overhead of 10%, and therefore
the remaining extra bandwidth is used to retransmit only 10% of the total transmitted
packets without exceeding the timing requirements of video signals. One-time lim-
ited retransmissions can further improve the quality of video signals at the expense
of additional buffer and processing overhead.
9.4.1
Effect of UEP and EEP
The EEP mode treats the MSB and LSB portions of a video packet equally. The
MSB portions, which contribute more to the PSNR, are strongly protected in the

UEP mode; however, the LSB portions are weakly protected. This is because in the
low BER range (BER < 9 × 10−6), the average PSNR of the EEP mode outperforms
UEP (see Figure 9.15). However, in the high BER range (BER > 9 × 10−6), UEP
achieves better average PSNR because MSB portions are strongly protected thereby
maintaining a high PSNR (see Figure 9.15). For the BER values we simulated in
this study, the UEP mode always maintains PSNR values greater than 40 dB which
is generally accepted as good picture quality. An adaptive EEP/UEP scheme, with
EEP at low BER and UEP at high BER, is also feasible, but UEP alone can maintain
a good picture quality over the entire BER range.

and UEP modes. The corresponding average PSNR values are shown in Figure 9.15.
Table 9.2 summarizes the variance of PSNR values shown in Figure 9.15. Notice
that the variances of PSNR values for the UEP mode are much smaller than the
corresponding results for the EEP mode. This suggests that UEP results in less

a higher mean PSNR value, the stability effect of the UEP mode provides much
better visual quality than the EEP mode because, for most human observers, wide
ﬂuctuations in the picture quality result in more severe visual degradation.

VQM Scores
The video quality metric (VQM) [16] is an objective metric that computes the
magnitude of the visible difference between the transmitted and received video
sequences, and larger visible degradations result in larger VQM values. For instance,
a zero value represents no impairment between the original and processed video
sequence. VQM scores for UEP are lower than for EEP in the high BER range as
shown in Figure 9.17. In Figure 9.15 we observed similar behavior with the PSNR

Conclusions and Future Directions
With the availability of low-cost 60 GHz CMOS circuits, there is no doubt that
a large number of new devices will soon be available that can support emerging
applications such as high-quality uncompressed video streaming and fast large ﬁle
transfers (such as photos, high-deﬁnition images, audio/video content) over short
distances. However, 60 GHz directional transmission creates many difﬁculties at the
MAC layer. In the recent past, researchers have proposed many MAC solutions in
the context of IEEE 802.11 that rely on a combination of directional and omnidi-
rectional transmissions. However, in 60 GHz it is difﬁcult to realize omnidirectional
transmissions. Therefore, a TDMA-like protocol is more suitable at 60 GHz.
Compared to low-frequency signals (2.4 or 5 GHz), 60 GHz signals incur sig-
niﬁcantly higher path losses. However, at shorter distances (less than 10 meters),
60 GHz can support multi-gigabit data rates. Therefore, the two wireless bands

264
60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
provide widely different, yet complementary, characteristics in terms of range and
throughput. For these reasons, the viability of multi-band WLAN devices that are
capable of operating in both the lower-frequency band (e.g. 2.4 and/or 5 GHz) and
higher-frequency band (60 GHz) becomes very attractive. In this way, multi-band
stations achieve the best of both worlds by combining the coverage of the lower
band and multi-Gbps transmission rate of the higher band. However, there is a
greater need for an efﬁcient multi-band operation that enables fast session transfer
from 60 GHz to 2.4/5 GHz, and vice versa [17], such that the optimum interface
is used based on the communicating stations’ physical proximity and multi-band
channel conditions.
Another challenge is to increase the range of 60 GHz transmissions. Advanced
beamforming technologies, as discussed in Chapter 4, can surely help. MAC
layer solutions such as multi-band mesh networks can also enhance the coverage
of 60 GHz transmissions by exploiting spatial reuse and coordination from the
2.4/5 GHz band. Yang and Park [18] have presented some initial results on
the beneﬁts multi-band mesh networks. However, more research is required on
this topic.

Remaining Challenges
and Future Directions

This book has presented a thorough overview of fundamental elements of 60 GHz
technology, covering key layers of the communication protocol stack, from channel
modeling to medium access control. Current research and development results
have also been presented to illustrate the evolving nature of this technology. With
two completed standards, multiple industry consortia and the ﬁrst products to
enter the market, 60 GHz has ﬁrmly established itself as the next major trend in
gigabit wireless technology. Nevertheless, as is apparent from the contents of this
book, new challenges have arisen at every layer of the communication protocol,
which require a signiﬁcant degree of innovation to be overcome. Moreover, beyond
technical advancements at particular layers, a successful 60 GHz solution (tech-
nically and economically) will need to address all aspects of the system design
simultaneously.
Some of the most important challenges remaining and anticipated developments
are as follows.
Full system evaluation in end-user scenarios. As seen in Chapters 7 and 8, the
implementation of a full 60 GHz demonstrator from radio to baseband is a
challenging task from many perspectives. Despite the availability of such
prototypes, to perform full system-level evaluations and measurements over
different circumstances (channel conditions, reﬂections, interferences, etc.) is
also a difﬁcult task. As a result, experimental data on the performance of 60 GHz

60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
systems under realistic usage scenarios is still limited. For this reason, some
fundamental questions related to system design might not have a deﬁnitive
answer and are subject to endless debate based on simulation results, limited
experiments and extrapolation of results available from other technologies. The
upcoming commercial deployment of beam-steered, Gbps, wireless solutions
is expected to provide means to evaluate different beamforming algorithms,
modulation formats, MAC strategies, etc. The relative performance of different
solutions in real-life situations (in terms of their cost, form factor, latency and
throughput) may have to await large-scale commercial deployment.
Compensation and robust design for PHY non-idealities. The attainment of data
throughputs in the Gbps range comes at the price not only of bandwidth but also
high precision in the processing of the carrier modulated signal, namely very
low phase noise, high IQ phase and amplitude balance, high ampliﬁer linearity,
ADC and DAC accuracy. Some of these challenges were described quantita-
tively in Chapter 3, and they will become harder to overcome as the demand for
greater data rate increases. In this context, digital compensation and calibration
techniques for RF non-idealities will become more crucial as technology nodes
proceed deeper down in the nanometer regime. Modulation and coding techniques
that are inherently robust to these physical layer limitations will also provide a
competitive advantage.
System-in-package integration and testing. The cost of packaging and testing is
expected to dominate over the cost of IC fabrication for high-volume 60 GHz
applications. Therefore, the development of design-for-testability techniques,
built-in-self-test, and known-good die techniques at millimeter-wave frequencies
will become an important part of product development. Recent results show
that the package-level integration of individual silicon beamforming modules
with small numbers of elements may be feasible for modular and low-cost
60 GHz beam-steered solutions [1]. Planning for system partition into one or
several integrated circuits will go hand-in-hand with packaging concepts (SoC,
SiP) and testing strategies at each level of production and integration. The
most cost-effective solutions will come from the right balance among these
three aspects for a particular application and volume. A separate and equally
important issue is the need of methodologies for standard-compliance testing
methods. These exist for wireless technologies at lower carrier frequencies and
helped to create a testing and manufacturing environment that reduced costs and
accelerated product development.
MAC design for higher throughput and power efﬁciency. The MAC layer has several
challenges in supporting application data rates greater than 10 Gbps. A multi-
channel directional MAC would be a natural choice in these scenarios. Efﬁcient
control of directional multiple channels in terms of device discovery and resource
allocation would then become necessary. Such scenarios would also demand the

development of more intelligent hybrid ARQs than exist today. Moreover, to
facilitate the use of 60 GHz technology in portable devices, the MAC layer needs
to help extend the battery life. This can be achieved not only by developing
smart power management but also by reducing overhead in device discovery,
beamforming, association and data transmission. The next generation 60 GHz
MAC should consider these open issues.
Higher network throughput. Most of the current research and design efforts at
60 GHz focus on individual point-to-point links. As 60 GHz devices gain wider
adoption, the 60 GHz frequency band may become congested. The support of
multiple transmissions at the same time (e.g. how to improve the overall network
throughput) must be addressed. Fortunately, we can take advantage of the fact
that most 60 GHz transmissions are highly directional by using spatial division
multiple access (SDMA) [2]. Multiple directional 60 GHz point-to-point links
could potentially coexist with each other, if the interference between links could
be kept under control. This calls for a signiﬁcant research effort in the area
of multi-user MIMO, interference suppression, interference alignment, and the
developments will go hand-in-hand with those in the MAC layer as discussed in
the previous paragraph.
Challenges in MIMO channel modeling. A 60 GHz MIMO solution is critical to our
ability to deliver the promise of multi-gigabit wireless solutions. Hence, realistic
60 GHz MIMO channel models based on virtual antennas and/or multiple-antenna
systems measurement are required for all the typical environments in which
60 GHz technology is to be deployed. This allows communications designers
to estimate the achievable data rates and diversity gain in the 60 GHz MIMO
channels and produce a robust system design. For example, the characteriza-
tion of transmit and receive antenna correlations, which serve as key MIMO
design parameters, is lacking at 60 GHz. This information gap persists despite
the fact that large antenna arrays are expected to be used in this band. Similarly, a
multiple dual-polarized MIMO channel model is also lacking and deserve more
investigation. While these models are needed for future 60 GHz systems, the
complexity and cost involved in performing such measurement are high if not
prohibitive.
The already existing 60 GHz technical approaches described in this book, as
well as others that will emerge to surmount the above-mentioned challenges,
will create a rich knowledge base from which other millimeter-wave Gbps tech-
nologies (not necessarily limited to 60 GHz frequency bands) and systems will
emerge. Here are some examples of future directions.
Higher-data-rate 60GHz systems. The natural trend for the evolution of current
systems is to achieve even higher data rates. One of the main drivers for this trend
is the ever increasing data rate requirements of high-deﬁnition video. According
to the WiHD Next Generation speciﬁcation announced recently [3], up to 28 Gbps

270
60 GHz Technology for Gbps WLAN and WPAN
may be required to support applications of this kind. If the current channelization
is to be kept unchanged, data rates higher than 10 Gbps may only be possible by
channel bonding, or the use of simultaneous parallel links.
Long-range point-to-point links. In the frequency range of 65–115 GHz (approx-
imately) the long-range oxygen absorption of millimeter-wave energy is
signiﬁcantly smaller (∼10 dB) than at 60 GHz. This has motivated the use
of frequency bands at 71–76 and 81–86 GHz (E-band) and even 100 GHz
for kilometer-range Gbps point-to-point links [4, 5]. Commercial systems
in these bands formally existed before 60 GHz commercial products, not as
integrated solutions but rather based on monolithic microwave integrated circuit
modules with III-V semiconductors. Although the market volume and channel
characteristics for these systems will remain signiﬁcantly different from those at
60 GHz, they will be affected by the current developments on silicon integration
of millimeter-wave radios and Gbps digial modem modules. One application
for E-band systems currently under consideration is de-congesting backhaul
connections in cellular networks [6, 7].
Wireless networking in data centers and digital systems. Data centers are the back-
bone of information technology infrastructure worldwide. In recent years, a large
increase in the demand for their data-processing capacity, and the requirement to
moderate the energy consumption, among other important factors, have exerted
pressure to rethink their architecture. Efﬁcient networking is critical to the per-
formance of these massive clusters of servers and, until recently, increasing the
bandwidth of existing optical and electrical connections was the only option.
However, the availability of Gbps wireless links has motivated the consideration
of other interesting alternatives in the way data centers of the future may be real-
ized [8, 9]. Highly dense digital systems of smaller footprint than data centers
(i.e. systems in package) face networking challenges that are equally daunting. In
these cases millimeter-wave propagation is also being explored as an alternative
to hard-wired connections at distances of a few millimeters [10].
In years to come, what is now regarded as an emerging technology will be
remembered as just the starting point of a series of major innovations in the way
we design, produce and utilize wireless communications.
