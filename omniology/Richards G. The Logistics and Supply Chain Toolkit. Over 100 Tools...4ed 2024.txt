PRAISE FOR THE LOGISTICS 
AND SUPPLY CHAIN TOOLKIT 
THIRD EDITION
‘A book that summarizes and explains many of the key techniques that make 
logistics the profession that it is. Certainly one that will not gather dust on a 
bookshelf, but will gather insight and understanding in the workplace.’
Professor Neil H Ashworth, Non-executive Chairman and adviser, former 
senior retailer and logistician, United Kingdom
‘A great resource that not only provides the tools but also gives you a plan. 
Sufficiently succinct to give comprehensive coverage of the subject, but in 
enough depth to work as a stand-alone reference. I thoroughly recommend it.’
Nigel Price, Director, CRP, United Kingdom
‘An invaluable source of practical information on all aspects of the supply chain, 
which will be useful to both practitioners and those studying the subject at any 
academic level. The toolkit provides an excellent resource to help in this task. 
Enhanced by many illustrations and tables, with inputs from a range of 
companies and practitioners and references to useful websites and literature, 
this book is a must-buy for anyone interested in learning more about this 
fascinating industry.’
Sharon Cullinane, Professor of Sustainable Logistics, Gothenburg Business 
School, Sweden
‘The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit, third edition, is a well-researched, 
substantial reference book. Packed full of clear examples and with a very 
structured approach, this is an excellent practical guide into the understanding 
of logistics tools and how to apply them in the real world. It’s a must-read for 
anyone who is involved in logistics and supply chain management.’
Carole Verry, Consultant, France

Introduction
Today’s logisticians are working in a fast-moving, ever-changing environ­
ment. The supply chain has become centre stage, providing competitive 
­advantage to those who can master procurement, supplier management, in­
ventory, warehouses and distribution. Getting the right product in the cor­
rect quantity to the right customer at the prescribed time in good condition 
at an acceptable cost is paramount to not only retaining but increasing sales 
and profitability. Supply chain and logistics managers are not only expected 
to be experts in their own field but also in human resource management, 
finance, customer service, supplier management and, at times, production. 
This book, written by supply chain and logistics practitioners, sets out to 
provide users with a handbook to enable them to keep pace with what’s 
happening in this sector.
According to the Collins English Dictionary, a tool is ‘anything that can 
be used as a means of performing an operation or achieving an end’. In this 
book we will introduce guides, frameworks, models, quick calculations and 
practical ideas, describing to the reader how to use the tools and under what 
circumstances. These guides and tools have been chosen to enable the reader 
to identify issues, produce solutions and thus improve operational efficiency 
and effectiveness. Some of these tools and spreadsheets can be downloaded 
from our website: http://howtologistics.com.
Have you ever wondered how you go about efficiently locating stock in 
your warehouse utilizing an ABC analysis, what is meant by the term ‘slot­
ting’, or what your trucks’ CO2 emissions are? To answer these questions 
and more, we thought it was time to bring these tools and calculations to­
gether in an easy-to-understand format with specific examples that relate to 
the supply chain and logistics sector.
The aim of this book is to provide today’s managers with a toolbox of 
practical guides, ideas and information to help them in their day-to-day 
work. It explains a number of the major management tools and suggests 
areas within supply chain and logistics where they can be applied. We don’t 
expect you to use all the tools and data but hope that you will find a number 
of them useful in your work.

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
2
The introduction of advanced technologies into today’s warehouses and 
fulfilment centres has gone a long way to assisting managers to become more 
efficient and cost effective. However, not all companies are able to afford 
sophisticated warehouse management systems, automation and robotics.
As a result of recent feedback from the third edition, we now compare 
some of these new technologies. However, the essence of the book remains – 
the provision of workable tools to assist managers in their day-to-day op­
erations.
The tools have been put into chapters, including supply chain, warehous­
ing, transport and inventory. The supply chain is a demanding and challeng­
ing area and managers require all the assistance they can get to satisfy both 
internal and external customers. Where we believe that the reader’s experi­
ence will be enhanced by further information on the tools discussed, we 
have identified and provided details of websites, software packages and 
companies that can further assist. These are included at the end of each tool. 
Each chapter provides guides and tools that enable the reader to tackle most 
of the problems faced in the above areas and thus improve efficiency and 
effectiveness. The chapters provide guidelines and suggestions as to how 
each tool can be used and show logistics-related examples where needed, to 
explain the tools further.
The book is split into eight chapters:
1	 Warehouse management tools and guides
2	 Transport management tools
3	 Inventory management tools
4	 Supply chain management tools
5	 Outsourcing tools
6	 Performance management tools
7	 Financial management tools and ratios
8	 Problem-solving tools
The chapter on warehousing includes descriptions of the various types of 
item-pick methods, a comprehensive warehouse audit, how to use ABC 
analysis to lay out the warehouse and the factors that need to be taken into 
account when deciding on a new location for a distribution centre. We have 
also included a comparison of goods-to-person systems and a tool on how 
to produce a contingency plan for the warehouse.

Introduction
3
The transport management chapter looks at areas such as carbon foot­
print measurement, fuel surcharge calculation and transport costs. We have 
also included a comparison of last mile delivery systems.
Within the inventory management chapter we discuss the various tools 
used in determining the optimum stock quantity, demand forecasting, how 
to calculate stock turn and carry out perpetual inventory counting.
The chapter on supply chain management looks at current tools such as 
SCOR®, factory gate pricing and supplier relationships. With the advance­
ment in technology we have also included tools and information on 
Blockchain, Logistics 4.0 and Digital Twinning.
Chapter 5 provides a step-by-step guide to logistics outsourcing, while 
the performance management section provides a number of relevant logis­
tics measures and details on how to measure performance.
The tools set out in the finance and problem-solving chapters can be used 
across the different logistics sectors.
Appendix 1 provides a list of useful websites while Appendix 2 provides 
useful measurements and conversions.
A glossary of terms and a list of useful acronyms can also be found, along 
with many of the tools in this book, on our website: http://howtologistics.com. 
A number of the examples and templates are free while others have been heav­
ily discounted for purchasers of this book. The code to enable you to receive 
the discount is lsct2024.
As website addresses might change over time we have archived the infor­
mation in a separate location. If you are provided with a company website 
address in the text, we also provide an alternative address should that loca­
tion no longer be available.
This book is a quick reference guide for supply chain and logistics profes­
sionals who want immediate access to relevant tools and data to assist with 
their day-to-day work. We hope you enjoy it. This is the fourth edition of the 
book as we are constantly updating the tools. If you have any ideas for other 
logistics-related tools please let us know and we will endeavour to include 
them in the next edition and on our website.
Previous editions have been translated into Chinese and Russian.

1.1  Warehouse audit
Introduction
An internal audit is designed to monitor and improve an organization’s 
business practices.
These are five reasons why internal auditing is important and should be 
carried out on a regular basis.
Audits:
●
●Provide objective insight
●
●Improve efficiency of operations
●
●Evaluate risks and protect assets
●
●Assess organizational controls
●
●Ensure legal compliance
­This section provides an audit checklist for a warehouse and its operations. 
The list of questions is not exhaustive and can be added to by users to mir­
ror their own operations.

Audits should be undertaken by an independent person from within the 
company or by an external consultant. The purpose of the audit should be 
explained to staff in advance. Results need to be shared with all the staff, 
and they need to take ownership of any improvements necessary.
The audits are based on what we see as best practice in a warehouse. A 
full set of audit forms in Excel format with over 100 questions can be pur­
chased from http://howtologistics.com, discount code: lsct2024; an extract 
of the audit is shown in Table 1.1.

1.2  5S or 5C, also known as Gemba Kanri
Introduction
5S, also known as 5C, has its origins in Japan. 5S focuses on organizing the 
workplace effectively and standardizing work procedures (see Figure 1.1). 
5S simplifies processes and reduces waste and non-value-adding activities 
while improving quality, efficiency and productivity. Safety is sometimes in­
cluded as a sixth S.
The tool is also effective in getting employees involved in the improve­
ment process and ‘owning’ their area of work, taking pride in how it looks 
and performs.

When to use
When a company is looking to improve efficiency within the warehouse and 
instil a culture of continuous improvement.
How to use
5S needs to be carried out in the correct order. You need to give individuals 
responsibility for each task and for their respective work areas within the 
warehouse:
a	 The first S (Sort or Seiri or Clear out) concentrates on removing any 
unnecessary items from the work area. This can include obsolete and 
damaged stock, over-stocks, defective equipment, broken pallets, waste 
packaging, etc. It can also refer to unnecessary movement within the 
warehouse. For example, the introduction of a cross-aisle within the 
picking area will reduce the amount of travel undertaken by the operators. 
Items marked for disposal can be put into a holding area until a consensus 
is reached as to what should be done with them.

Warehouse management tools and guides
9
b	 The second S (Straighten or Seiton or Configure) focuses on efficient and 
effective placement of items, for example, location labelling and putting 
frequently used items in easy-to-access locations. Shadow boards can be 
used to ensure equipment is returned to its correct locations (see 
Figure 1.2). Directional signs in the warehouse are also part of this, as 
they should reduce the amount of time taken to find items. Items such as 
tools, empty pallets and packaging should be placed in easily accessible 
areas close to the point of need. Finally, parking areas for handling 
equipment need to be set up, with reminders to staff to put the equipment 
on charge if required.
c	 The third S (Shine or Seiso or Clean) comes after you have cleared the 
area of any unnecessary items. Thoroughly clean the area and produce a

timetable for cleaning. This can be done at the end of each shift, with 
defects to equipment reported immediately. Staff take pride in a clean 
work area, they work better and from experience, clean warehouses tend 
to be more efficient! Suggestions include putting bins at the front of each 
aisle to capture waste paper, packaging and broken pallets and making 
brooms and dust pans easily accessible.
d	 The fourth S (Standardize or Seiketsu or Conform) is all about creating 
standards for each work area. Walk through each process with the 
relevant staff and then produce, document and display best practice 
procedures within the warehouse. Make them simple to read and 
understand. A photograph displaying the process with minimal text 
works well in this situation.
e	 The fifth S (Sustain or Shitsuke or Continually improve) ensures 
continuous improvement. Staff are encouraged not to return to ­previous 
work practices but to accept change and take things to a new level. 
Regular checks and audits need to be carried out, with the potential for 
bonus payments on achieving high performance scores.
More recently, companies have introduced a sixth S, which covers safety. It 
can be argued that safety is at the heart of the operation and therefore is a 
valuable addition to the 5S mentality.
An example of how to use the 5S tool is shown in Table 1.2. Companies 
that have instigated 5S have improved quality, increased efficiency, improved 
safety, reduced waste and given employees a sense of ownership.
Table 1.3 below shows an audit tool, which can be carried out in a work 
area, including offices. It can be adapted to work in most areas. An interac­
tive version of this audit tool can be found at https://www.adaptivebms.
com/tools (archived at https://perma.cc/7ABV-R6UG).
Allied to 5S are the 7 Muda (types of waste). These are as follows:
1	 Inventory – waste of space, equipment, facilities, energy, administration 
and IT resources. It needs to be evaluated and adjusted as necessary.
2	 Motion – any motion of a person or machine that does not add value 
needs to be removed.
3	 Over-production – ‘just in case’ mentality. ‘More than’, ‘faster than’ or 
‘sooner than needed’ have to stop.
4	 Waiting – waiting is idle time, created by imbalances of machinery or 
people. This needs to be reduced or eradicated.

5	 Re-work – reject, repair, re-work causes a great waste of resources: 
materials, manpower and machinery. Although capturing value in the 
warehouse it shouldn’t occur in the first place.
6	 Processing – non-logical flow in the wrong sequence that adds no value – 
needs to be regularly evaluated – walk through the process regularly.
7	 ­Conveyance – essential but adds no value. Every time you move something 
it adds cost. Reduce these movements.

1.2i  Gemba Walk
Introduction
A Gemba Walk is performed by management and is a tool that allows man­
agers to witness first hand what is happening on the warehouse floor. It 
underpins initiatives such as Lean and TPM. It eliminates second-hand in­
formation; you are on the warehouse floor.
It is simply the C in the Plan Do Check Act (Tool 1.29) problem-solving 
model for sustainable improvement. It allows managers to go to the place of 
work, look at the processes and talk with the staff. It provides the opportu­
nity to talk with the process owners and see the work done daily, understand 
the challenges faced, in order to improve efficiency through effective resolu­
tion of the problems and guide corrective actions.
In effect it gives management a close-up view of the operation.
It is important to note that the walk is not there to check up on people, 
more to have a presence and ask questions to understand what they need to 
do their job; ask guiding questions and let them identify their own prob­
lems. Use questions such as What, Why, What if and Why Not – pretty much 
in this order.
The key to a successful Gemba Walk is always to focus on process. When 
you get the process right, the results take care of themselves.
Performed correctly, the Gemba Walk is a much more powerful manage­
ment approach than sitting at a desk looking at data. It requires some effort 
to get these walks right, but when you do it helps improve your ­organization.
Observations during Gemba Walk:
●
●Is the facility clean?
●
●Are employees engaged?
●
●Is the health and safety code followed?

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
16
●
●Are metrics updated?
●
●Is the operations status up to date e.g. picks per hour?
●
●Are documents updated?
●
●Are aisles clearly marked?
●
●Have MHE checklists and inspection sheets been completed?
●
●Are priority issues recorded and understood?
●
●Are the process flows clear?

What is your biggest quality issue currently?
What is your quick Kaizen/CI (Continuous Improvement) for your area?
What are the things you feel are improving?
What would you change if you were given the opportunity?
How do you know if you are having a good or bad day?
What can I do to help you?
Safety
What’s the number one hazard in your job?
What can we do to improve safety?
How do you report safety concerns?
Do you have a ‘near miss’ recording facility?
What recent safety improvements worked well?
Are our safety procedures easy to follow?
How are employees recognized for their safety contributions?
What else can we do to improve manual handling?

1.3  Pareto analysis, 80/20 rule, ABC 
analysis or the vital few analysis
Introduction
Vilfredo Pareto was an Italian economist who calculated that 80 per cent of 
the land in Italy was owned by 20 per cent of the population and that 20 per 
cent of his pea plants produced 80 per cent of the crop. This idea was taken 
further by Joseph Juran, a US consultant in the 1940s, who demonstrated 
that 80 per cent of product defects were caused by 20 per cent of the prob­
lems in production methods. It is now used by companies to identify and 
separate best-selling products and profitable customers from slow-moving 
products and less-profitable customers.
The tool is used heavily within the warehouse environment. Examples are 
as follows:
20 per cent of the stock lines account for 80 per cent of sales;
20 per cent of the stock lines produce 80 per cent of the profit;
20 per cent of stock lines appear most frequently on orders;
20 per cent of the stock keeping units (SKU) account for 80 per cent of the 
stock value;
20 per cent of suppliers provide 80 per cent of the stock lines;
20 per cent of customers produce 80 per cent of turnover;
20 per cent of customers cause 80 per cent of the problems;
20 per cent of customers produce 80 per cent of the profit;
20 per cent of the staff produce 80 per cent of the output;
20 per cent of staff cause 80 per cent of problems.
These are all common rules of thumb used in business today. They may not 
be exact for every company, but most companies can relate to at least some 
of them. It is the 20 per cent figure (or the vital few) that we need to concen­
trate our efforts on; that is, our top 20 per cent of customers, suppliers, 
product lines and staff.
When to use
One of the most time-consuming operations within a warehouse is the pick­
ing of orders. It can take up to 55 per cent of overall labour activity within 

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit

the warehouse and, of that, half can be accounted for by travel to, between 
and from the pick locations. Thus, to reduce travel in the warehouse we 
need to place our most popular items in terms of order frequency (not sales 
volume) as close to the dispatch area as possible. To do this, we need to 
analyse our data.
How to use
If we take a company’s order profile, we can use Excel as a tool to list all of 
the products by sales frequency and use the ‘Data Sort’ function to list them 
from highest to lowest, as can be seen in Table 1.4. Once this analysis has 
been undertaken, you can revise the warehouse layout by having the top 20 
per cent of popular stock lines (SKU), i.e. those that appear most often on 
orders, at the front of the warehouse closest to dispatch. Many companies 
use the total unit sales; however, this can provide a false picture in terms of 
warehouse layout as some items may sell in large quantities but only once a 
year, whereas others sell less but on a continuous basis.
As shown in Table 1.4, the first four items have by far the most appear­
ances on orders during the period. These are classified as fast movers, the 
next six as medium movers, and the following eight as class ‘C’ or slow mov­
ers. They are also referred to as runners, repeaters and strangers. As a rule 
of thumb, 80 per cent of order frequency appearance tends to come from 20 
per cent of the product lines (A items), 15 per cent from 35 per cent of the 
product lines (B items) and 5 per cent from 45 per cent of the product lines. 
The last two items have not sold at all during the period, and need to be as­
sessed by sales, marketing, procurement and finance to determine whether 
they are likely to be sold in the future (note they could be new items), need 
to be put on special offer, returned to the suppliers or written off. In this 
example we have denoted them with an ‘X’ for further analysis.
This tool can also be used for perpetual inventory or cycle counting (see 
tool 3.5) and with activity-based costing (see tool 7.1) to determine which 
customers should be retained in terms of profitability and also how much 
sales time should be allocated to each customer. It is usually the case that the 
smaller customers demand more management time!
Provided that you have accurate information for each of these parame­
ters, the 80/20 analysis can be a valuable tool in any company’s armoury.

1.4  Choosing an order-picking strategy
Introduction
Many warehouses continue to pick orders individually; however, in today’s 
e-commerce environment, there is a requirement to speed up the picking 
process. We also find that there is confusion between the different pick strat­
egies in terms of how they are described. Below is our interpretation.
Pick by individual order
Line items are collected from all locations by an individual for a specific 
customer order. Once picked, the operator returns for the next order:
●
●Instructions can be via paper-based systems, scanners, voice or vision 
technology.
●
●It is normally a single-stage process unless every order is checked on 
dispatch.
●
●Handling equipment can range from a trolley to a forklift truck.
●
●It can be prone to error if using a paper-based system.
●
●It can be time-consuming.
●
●Training can be time-consuming for scanning and paper pick.
Cluster picking
Operators take several individual orders out into the warehouse at the same 
time:
●
●Operation is as per individual order pick, although multiple orders are 
picked at the same time.

22
●
●Order sizes are lower than for individual order picks.
●
●Orders are clustered in a particular area.
●
●Normally a single-stage process unless every order is packed and checked 
on dispatch.
●
●Handling equipment can range from a trolley to a forklift truck but 
requires segregated sections in order to separate the orders.
●
●Reliant on operator being accurate in sorting.
●
●­System assistance required to ensure orders are clustered efficiently and 
items are placed in the correct location. A put to light system or a vision-
based system is ideal.
●
●Training can be very time-consuming.
Pick by batch
Large quantities of items are collected for a large number of orders that have 
the same product lines. All orders are consolidated onto one pick request:
●
●Typical use in e-commerce applications.
●
●One to five lines per order maximum.
●
●Can pick exact amount from reserve storage and allocate to zero (pick to 
zero) or pick full cartons/pallets and return remainder to stock (pick by 
line) once allocation is completed.
●
●Handling equipment is mainly reach or forklift trucks for pallet quantities.
●
●Two/three-stage process – pick then sort and label. Possible return of 
unused stock.
●
●Requires additional space to sort and label.
●
●The use of a put wall with a put to light system is ideal for sortation.
●
●Reliant on system to consolidate orders.
Pick by zone
Products are categorized into specific groups and located in defined areas 
within the warehouse:
●
●Reduces walking distance as operator looks after a small area.
●
●Picking can be simultaneous or sequential.
●
●Simultaneous orders require consolidation.
●
●Requires conveyors or automated mobile robots, sometimes referred to 
as cobots, to transport orders around the warehouse.

Warehouse management tools and guides
23
●
●Essential to ensure each zone has near-equal activity.
●
●Used with pick and put to light systems.
●
●High accuracy if combined with scanning or vision systems.
●
●Items are not individually identified unless using a more sophisticated 
system.
●
●­Reliant on accurate put-away operation.
Pick by waves
Large numbers of orders are picked during defined time periods:
●
●Any of the above pick methods can be used.
●
●Pick is associated with vehicle departures, shift changes, order deadlines, 
etc.
Goods to picker
Large number of orders can be picked at the same time:
●
●Initial orders are batched together.
●
●Picker remains in one position.
●
●Products are brought to the picker by conveyor, robot or automated 
system.
●
●Operator uses put to light system, or a vision system, to allocate items to 
individual orders.
●
●Little training required.
When to use
When looking to improve both productivity and accuracy within the ware­
house.

1.5  Choosing pick technology
Introduction
The picking function in a warehouse can be up to 55 per cent of the operat­
ing cost, with travel to, between and from locations being up to 50 per cent 
of that labour involvement. It is therefore crucial to choose the most appro­
priate method of picking.
Many warehouses continue to use system-created paper pick lists to pick 
orders within the warehouse. There are a number of alternatives, the major­
ity requiring some form of technology. Table 1.6 shows the advantages and 
disadvantages of each method. One thing to point out here is that many 
warehouses will use a combination of pick methods, depending on require­
ments such as velocity of movement, lead times, product identification, 
product size and accuracy requirements.
When to use
When looking to improve both productivity and accuracy within the ware­
house.
How to use
Table 1.6 compares the different picking systems. A new picking method 
called ‘vision pick’ utilizing technology similar to Google glasses has been 
introduced by a number of companies recently.

­product by consolidating items during the inbound process and taking them 
directly to the shipping or dispatch area.
Items are likely to remain on site for a maximum of 48 hours, with most 
leaving in a much shorter time. These can be dispatched separately or can be 
consolidated with product picked from stock. The costs of holding and han­
dling inventory are significantly reduced. Walmart puts some of its success 
down to cross-docking as much as 85 per cent of its products through work­
ing closely with its suppliers and having sophisticated IT systems.

Warehouse management tools and guides
33
When to use
The pressure on companies to reduce order lead times requires products to 
move through the supply chain much faster. Cross-docking enables this to 
happen.
A variant of this is a sequencing centre where parts destined for a produc­
tion line are consolidated and sorted so that they arrive at the production 
line only when they are required.
How to use
To operate an efficient cross-dock requires a good information technology 
system. Advanced shipping notifications (ASNs) are essential and goods 
need to be identified easily at the inbound stage to enable staff to move them 
directly to the dispatch or shipping area as opposed to the storage area. To 
enable this, barcodes or radio frequency identification (RFID) tags have to 
be aligned across suppliers and customers.
Suppliers can be requested to label the items with information that ena­
bles the goods-in team to identify the items quickly. Alternatively, the in­
bound team are alerted to the fact that a transfer of goods is required by an 
instruction on the paperwork, a voice message or a message on the barcode 
scanner. If the company is using scan technology, a message appears on 
screen as soon as the goods for cross-docking have been identified. 
Instructions as to where to move the product should also be given at this 
time.
Ideally a vehicle is already waiting on the loading dock for the items in 
question. This requires excellent coordination and planning. Alternatively, 
the pallets or cartons are placed in a section of the dispatch area that is 
marked out for outbound loads. If space is at a premium in the dispatch 
area, drive-in racking can be used to hold the products until the outbound 
vehicle arrives (see Figure 1.3).
The coordination of inbound and outbound movements is key to the 
system working effectively. An example of this is the hub operation for a 
parcel or pallet distribution operation where items arrive in time to meet a 
departing vehicle returning to its geographic area. A vehicle cannot depart 
until the last vehicle carrying goods destined for its area has arrived.
Finally, warehouse design plays its part in terms of where the inbound 
and outbound doors are located. If they are situated next to each other as in 
Figure  1.3, there is a need to ensure that congestion is not an issue.

1.7  Slotting or item profiling
Introduction
Inventory slotting or profiling is the process of identifying the most efficient 
placement for each stock item in a warehouse or distribution centre, taking 
into account item popularity, characteristics and safety aspects. Strategically 
placing the item in the optimum location allows workers to pick items effi­
ciently, quickly and accurately, and reduces the risk of injuries.
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

Warehouse management tools and guides
35
When to use
To enable you to improve the efficiency of your picking operation within the 
warehouse.
How to use
Slotting can be done manually using standard spreadsheets, database pro­
grams or specifically designed slotting software. Slotting is a recent addition 
to many warehouse management systems (WMS).
There are several ways to increase picking productivity with slotting. 
Placing fast-moving items close to the dispatch area, conveyors and aisle 
ends minimizes picker travel time. Using easier-to-pick locations for high-
activity items, such as the middle levels of shelving and carton flow racks, 
also facilitates quicker and more ergonomic picking.
Items that are often sold together should be stored together to reduce 
travel. This can also help distinguish between similar parts. For example, 
placing the same size nut and bolt together not only reduces travel but also 
separates one bolt size from another. Other potential pairings include dry 
pasta and pasta sauces. This is sometimes called product affinity.
From a safety point of view, frequently picked and moderate-weight 
items should be placed at a height between an average person’s waist and 
shoulders to minimize the chance of injury to pickers and replenishment 
staff. In warehouses where there is a mix of heavy and fragile items, the 
heaviest items should be placed at the beginning of the pick path so that they 
are loaded at the bottom of a pallet, carton or tote.
Where items appear frequently on orders, these should not only be put 
close to dispatch but also into multiple locations in this area of the ware­
house in order to balance the workload and avoid bottlenecks.
Note that if using zone picking, the most frequently ordered items should 
not be held in the same zone. They should be separated across all the zones 
to ensure that activity is equal across all zones.
Items can also be grouped within the warehouse based on vendor or 
product similarities. Vendor groupings can simplify merchandise put-away. 
Family groups can also be established to cluster items that are often sold 
together or items with specific storage or handling requirements. Retailers 
may use family groups to organize the warehouse logically so that the pick 
mirrors the layout in the stores.

36
Careful slotting can also ensure that items are placed in properly sized 
locations. The full cubic capacity of the location should be used, allowing 
for clearance height requirements. The location should hold a sufficient 
quantity of inventory to meet the restocking goals for the warehouse, for 
example a full shift’s pick.
How to start
The first step in any inventory slotting project is gathering the necessary in­
formation about the items, locations in the warehouse and product sales. 
Data may already be stored in the WMS or ERP (enterprise resource plan­
ning) system. Otherwise, items and cases need to be physically measured. 
The following information is typically needed for each SKU:
●
●item length, width, height and weight;
●
●case quantity and dimensions (length, width, height and weight) for items 
stored by the case;
●
●pallet quantity (or cases per tier and tiers per pallet – TiHi) for items 
stored by the pallet;
●
●vendor, if items are to be stored in vendor groupings;
●
●family group if items are to be stored by product groupings;
●
●special storage conditions, if applicable (flammable, refrigeration, high 
value, etc);
●
●maximum stacking height or crushability factor, if applicable;
●
●items that often appear together on an order;
●
●items that are very similar resulting in mis-picks or that can cause a 
chemical reaction should not be stored next to each other.
Each pick location in the warehouse needs to be defined. Information typi­
cally required for each slot is:
●
●location number;
●
●usable size (length, width, height);
●
●weight capacity;
●
●proximity to material handling equipment (MHE) and shipping;
●
●position within the pick path;
●
●types of items eligible to be stored here (hazard code, vendor or family 
group, batch code or lot number).

Item movement can be captured in terms of the number of times each item 
was sold (hits), the quantity sold, sales forecast (stocking level) and the on-
hand quantity. Hits and quantity sold are most typically used because high-
hit items should be placed in the most efficient locations and the optimal size 
location can be established using the quantity sold and the dimensions. 
Having two adjacent pallet locations (bays) is not an issue with fast-moving 
goods – this reduces the number of times the locations are replenished and 
can avoid replenishing during a pick cycle.
If items change frequently and do not have any historical movement fig­
ures, sales forecasts may be used instead of history. On-hand quantity data 
are important for warehouses that choose to size locations in slow pick 
areas to a typical on-hand inventory level, rather than a sales level.
Slotting rules
Once the necessary data have been collected, slotting rules must be estab­
lished by setting up constraints (rules that cannot be broken) and objectives 
(goals). Constraints include weight limits, hazardous material areas and 
vendor/family group areas. Objectives define factors such as the desired 
stock level, where faster-moving items are placed and how activity will be 
balanced. Examples of some typical rules include:
●
●Put the fast-moving items close to the shipping dock and on the lower 
pallet rack levels. Store slower-moving items on higher levels and further 
away from the dock.
●
●In the case pick area, locate taller cases and heavier cases at the beginning 
of the pick path. Put faster-moving cases on floor/lower levels.
●
●If using carousels, balance the activity among carousels in pods. Spread 
faster-moving items among the carousels and put them on the centre 
shelves.
●
●Place fast-moving items into carton flow racks, with the very fastest on 
the centre levels. Balance the workload among the flow rack units.
●
●Put slower-moving items into shelving.
●
●Put the faster-moving items closer to the take-away conveyor or end of 
aisle.
●
●Locate heavier items on the centre levels of shelving.
Proper slotting takes time to establish, and regular maintenance is required 
to keep items positioned efficiently; however, slotting software can ease the

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
38
burden of keeping items in proper locations. Slotting items properly in­
creases picking productivity and makes order selection easier, safer and 
more accurate.
Trial re-slotting runs should be made to test the rules and refine them so 
that they will yield the desired results. You can opt to make the profile 
changes gradually during normal operations, rather than interrupting fulfil­
ment activities to move hundreds of items. You can review item placement 
on a weekly basis and move items each night to relocate the most badly 
placed SKUs. Although it will take several months to achieve the optimal 
profile, picking productivity will increase with each set of moves.

1.8  Resource planning
Introduction
Labour is a significant cost within a warehouse operation. Warehouse man­
agers are constantly required to optimize the number of staff employed and 
reduce overall headcount by increasing productivity. Planning work is there­
fore crucial to the running of a cost-effective warehouse.
Labour management enables warehouse managers to compare produc­
tivities between staff and engineered standards, and as a result identify op­
portunities for further training or possible redeployment. The system can 
also be used to introduce incentive schemes and be part of an appraisal 
system.
There are a number of labour management systems (LMSs) available on 
the market, some of which are listed at the end of this tool. Some WMSs 
also have a labour management module. However, it is possible to plan the 
­resources required within a warehouse manually through the use of 
­spreadsheets.

When to use
It is our contention that all warehouses should operate with some form of 
resource plan to ensure that the correct number of staff are deployed each 
day and therefore it should be part of daily operations. Resource planning 
enables the warehouse manager to reasonably calculate the number of staff 
required each day for each section of the warehouse and, when busy, to 
calculate how many additional staff may be required.
How to use
Table 1.7 details a number of warehouse tasks together with the volume of 
activity, productivity standards and the expected time to undertake these 
tasks. Forms such as this can be completed each day based on the activities 
planned for the coming days and weeks. It requires advanced information in 
terms of receipts and orders, whether forecast or actual. It also requires staff 
to undertake time-and-motion studies to calculate the time required to un­
dertake each activity.
The data can be updated with actual figures once the task has been com­
pleted: this provides a more accurate picture for future similar work. 
Table 1.7 details an in-handling operation over the course of one day. Each 
activity is listed together with the expected volume and this, together with 
the engineered standards previously estimated, enables the warehouse man­
ager to calculate the number of staff required and the equipment needed. By 
completing this form, the warehouse manager is able to calculate the num­
ber of people and equipment required for that particular day’s operation.
Utilizing an electronic LMS enables you to evaluate the productivity of 
individuals as well as the team as a whole. It measures the performance of 
each individual for completed tasks against existing labour standards to de­
termine how the time spent performing each task compares with the ex­
pected task completion time. The system, if interfacing with voice or radio 
frequency, can more accurately measure the task in hand, taking into account 
idle time, delays and bottlenecks. The system is able to assign the operator an 
overall score. This enables the warehouse manager to compare performance 
against engineered standards and the operator’s peers. The system is a great 
deal more sophisticated than a spreadsheet and will produce the data much 
faster. A number of steps are required to set up the system (see Figure 1.4).
The more sophisticated LMSs can also create a list of tasks for an opera­
tor and coordinate tasks. As Obal (2011) says: ‘When you start interleaving 
and measuring people, you are driving out a lot of inefficiencies. You’re 
maximizing your labour that is already there in the warehouse.’

Although many WMSs have LMS as an option or even inbuilt, there are a 
large number of stand-alone systems that can be interfaced with both ware­
house and transport management systems. A list of suppliers of LMS can be

1.9  Task interleaving
Introduction
Minimal movement within a warehouse is key to efficiency and productiv­
ity. There are a number of ways of reducing the amount of travel undertaken 
in a warehouse.
As we have seen in the ABC/Pareto tool (tool 1.3), the notion of placing 
the most popular items as close to the dispatch area as possible reduces the 
amount of travel in the warehouse. Another method of movement reduction 
is task interleaving or dual cycling. Task interleaving is controlled by a WMS 
that allocates tasks to ensure an operator travels fully loaded, both ways. 
For example, an operator unloading a trailer on inbound and taking the 
pallet to reserve storage will be tasked with collecting a pallet for replenish­
ment or possibly dispatch depending on the amount of travel required be­
tween locations. This can reduce equipment use by up to 30 per cent. The 
system works well with full pallet movements both inbound and outbound.
When to use
When looking to increase efficiency and reduce travel within the warehouse.
How to use
The idea is to combine work for a forklift truck or powered pallet truck. 
According to Tompkins (2003), task interleaving is especially good for tasks 
with the following characteristics:
●
●The same materials handling equipment can be used to undertake both 
types of moves.
●
●The end location for one type of move is relatively close to the collection 
point for the other move. This means that the operator and truck are utilized 
both ways rather than two separate single trips, which often happens. This 
is similar to the back-loading concept used in freight transport.
●
●The moves are pretty much equal both ways. Ensuring that the tasks are 
well matched needs an accurate set-up in the WMS.
Although put-away and replenishment may seem a good match, it is likely 
that interleaving these tasks can cause increased travel and delays for both 
processes. For task interleaving to be successful, it needs the support of an 
information technology system. Most modern WMSs have this capability.

This also works better when the doors are on the same side of the building 
and can be used for both inbound and shipping activities. It can also work 
reasonably well with doors on adjacent sides. It needs operations to be more 
flexible and not have dedicated inbound and outbound teams. The opera­
tors need to be free to undertake both put-away and dispatch activities. As 
a result, staff need to be able to multitask and move between operations.
Task interleaving will not be successful if inbound activities are under­
taken in the morning, dispatch in the afternoon and replenishment over­
night, for example. Task interleaving works best at larger facilities where 
more tasks can be queued up and staff will have continuous work.
The key is to manage the task allocation and not to disrupt urgent opera­
tions. The tasks have to be controlled sufficiently well and planned to coin­
cide with other tasks. Releasing tasks too early or too late can have a devas­
tating effect on productivity and on equipment and manpower usage.

1.10  Selecting warehouse storage equipment
Introduction
The selection of warehouse storage equipment is best carried out in conjunc­
tion with the equipment manufacturers. They are the experts and have ex­
perience of different types of warehouse operations. Ensure that you get a 
number of opinions and, if necessary, use a consultant to sense-check the 
options.
In this guide we look specifically at storage media. There are a number of 
different options when it comes to choosing the method of storage. The 
choice of how to store product will very much depend on the product size, 
its speed of throughput, the number of pallets per line item and the stock 
rotation policy (see Table 1.8).
There are, of course, many variables that will impact on the price. The 
main one is pallet size and type; for example, with drive-in racking there are 
different design options and alternative support rails available. On double-
deep racking it would normally be the use of adjustable pallet racking 
(APR), but some trucks require a low-level beam to accommodate reach

1.11  Warehouse location numbering
Introduction
When you enter the majority of warehouses you are faced with row upon 
row of storage racks. An interesting aspect from a consultancy viewpoint is 
how each row or aisle of racking is identified. This section suggests how to 
number rows of racking or shelving within a warehouse facility.
When to use
If a company is looking to introduce greater efficiency into its picking op­
eration and reduce travel time, it needs to consider carefully how it numbers 
its pick locations.
How to do it
In Figure 1.6 we see that each row of racking is given a letter: A, B, C, etc. 
This results in one-sided picking as denoted by the arrows. The numbers 
denoted in the boxes are the pallet locations. The shaded area is an order 
pick location.
In this example the first pick location will have a location identification 
(ID) of A (row) 06 (bay) 01 (ground floor) – A0601, while the second loca­
tion will be B0401. The pick list produced for the operator will automati­
cally send him or her to the location in Row A. This can result in large 
walking distances as the order picker first visits the location on one side of 
the aisle and then returns to visit the locations on the other side. This method 
of identification can be utilized in very wide aisles; however, for narrow 
aisles and shelving it is more efficient to number the aisles as can be seen in 
Figure 1.7. However, note that there are warehouse management systems 
that can adapt to row numbers and configure the pick operation to follow 
the most efficient path.
In Figure 1.7 the aisles are given letters, as opposed to each row, which 
results in the picker traversing the aisle and thus picking from both sides at 
one pass. This will reduce the amount of travel significantly. In Figure 1.7 
the first pick location is A0801 and the second becomes A1101. As a result, 
the pick travel has reduced significantly. This is referred to as snake path or 
S-shape picking.
It can also be noted in Figure 1.7 that the location numbers begin at the 
other end of the aisle for aisle B thus allowing the picker to travel less and

Table 1.9 compares different truck types working in a racked storage envi­
ronment. We have taken a warehouse with the following storage area di­
mensions – 48 metres × 120 metres × 10 metres – to bring out the differences 
between the trucks. Note the lift height capability of the trucks together 
with the aisle space required. Also note that the VNA truck requires another 
truck to transport the product to and from the racked area.

tions. These are shown below.

Figure 1.9  Aisle width calculation, counterbalance truck
How to use
In order to calculate the aisle width required for particular forklift trucks we 
need to use a formula that takes into account the size of load, the truck’s 
outer turning radius and the truck’s lost load centre, which is the horizontal 
distance from the centreline of the front axle to the front face of the forks. 
The formula should also include a margin for ‘operator clearance’.
The official formula for working out the minimum 90-degree stacking 
aisleway dimension (known as Ast4 or Ast3) is shown as:
WA + LLC + L
where
WA = The forklift truck’s outer turning radius
LLC = Forklift truck’s lost load centre
L = Length of load
Tony Sellick from Forklift Training suggests adding a further 300 mm for 
operator clearance.
With regard to the reach truck the following formula applies:
WA + LLC + L − R plus 200 mm (operator clearance)
where
WA = The forklift truck’s outer turning radius
­LLC = Reach truck’s lost load centre
R = The reach distance
L = Length of load

1.14  Goods-to-person solutions – 
omnichannel operations
Introduction
As mentioned in tool 1.5, the picking function in a warehouse can be up to 
55 per cent of the warehouse operating cost, with travel to, between and 
from locations being up to 50 per cent of that labour involvement. It is 
therefore crucial to choose the most appropriate method of picking.
The shortage of labour coupled with increased labour costs, requirement 
for more flexible work hours and shorter order lead times has seen an in­
crease in goods-to-person (G2P) systems.
In this section we examine the various types of G2P systems currently 
available.
There are four main types of systems: those which utilize mobile robots 
to convey items to static pickers at pick stations; those which are permanent 
fixtures, utilizing shuttles on rails; hybrid versions of the latter; and carou­
sels/vertical lift modules.
The mobile robot systems convey shelving to a pick station where a 
picker will pick the required item and the mobile robot and shelving will 
return the shelves to the storage area.
These include AGVs (autonomous guided vehicles) and AMR shuttles 
(autonomous mobile robots).
AGVs/AMRs tend to convey shelving up to 1.8 metres in height while 
AMR shuttles can convey taller fixtures, up to 8 metres.
These robots move around a warehouse independently and take instruc­
tions from warehouse control/execution software (WCS/WES). The robots 
are fitted with sensors, scanners and 3D cameras. They navigate through

54
buildings using digital maps routing from point A to B. The robots can avoid 
obstacles and interact safely with humans. Robots can also navigate using 
2D bar code labels positioned in strategic positions on the floors and in the 
racks.
Dynamic slotting takes place as orders are analysed. The WCS will mon­
itor the movement rates of SKUs and units and will slot based on these rates.
Although floor space is utilized efficiently the cubic space is not, unless 
multiple floors are introduced. This is a significant downside of this system.
Major suppliers include Geek+, Mushiny, HIKRobot, GreyOrange, 
Quicktron, Swisslog.
Amazon, which has its own AMRs, states that fulfilment centres (FCs) 
with robots are three times more efficient and 20 per cent faster than tradi­
tional, less high-tech FCs.
Companies utilizing this system will tend to use put to and pick to light 
systems for put-away and picking.
In terms of static versions we have the cube AS/RS (Automated Storage 
and Retrieval Systems) provided by companies such as Autostore and 
utilized by Ocado and its clients. In this system, plastic totes are stacked 
one on top of the other in a grid system. An ABC analysis (see tool 1.3) 
is used to ensure the most popular items are as close to the surface as 
possible.
A similar system is provided by Cimcorp, but without the requirement of 
the superstructure. Each tote is stacked on top of another, and they are re­
trieved utilizing a gantry crane.
Static AS/RS systems provided by companies including Knapp, TGW, 
Dematic, SSI Schaefer, Opex, Honeywell etc. utilize a structure where 
shuttles move on rails to access the plastic totes. These totes can be lo­
cated one or two deep in the ‘racks’. Weight capacity tends to be in the 
region of <50 kg.
However, there are pallet AS/RS systems with a much greater capacity.
We can also include mini-load systems in this section. Shuttles retrieve 
items and bring them to the front of the structure where the required item is 
picked, and the remainder of the items returned to their location.
The hybrid version operates with a permanent fixture but utilizes mobile 
robots to access the totes in the racks and convey items to a picker. Each of 
these systems provides very dense storage. An example of this system is pro­
vided by Exotec and Hai Pick.
Although utilizing the cubic space of the warehouse, this system has its 
disadvantages – namely the permanency of the structure and the high capital

outlay. The cube AS/RS also requires the robots to ‘dig’ out the totes to ac­
cess those items which are not located on top of the grid.
Another type of permanent structure includes carousels and vertical lift 
modules which have either shelves which rotate within the structure, called 
carousels – these can be vertical or horizontal – or a lift system at the back 
of the structure called a vertical lift module (VLM).
Another system is the pocket sorter which is very similar to a hanging 
garment system whereby pouches convey items to a pick station. This will 
usually require a separate storage location for storing items and a section for 
decanting into the pouches.
Another system, recently introduced to the market, is the Hive system 
where robots climb existing racking to retrieve items. This is still very much 
in its early development stage.
Selecting a G2P solution very much depends on the type of operation. 
You need to know what the inventory is in terms of size, stability of size, 
stock turnover, number and size of orders and order lead time, to name a 
few parameters.
As mentioned in the recent Stiq G2P report, ‘the higher the level of auto­
mation the higher the predictability must be for the future’.
When to use
If you are a potential or existing user of G2P solutions, in the process of 
evaluating G2P solutions, constructing a new warehouse, having significant 
labour issues, looking to increase productivity and accuracy or just starting 
to think about the possibility of automating your warehouse.
How to use
Table 1.10 shows the advantages and disadvantages of each type of automa­
tion. One thing to point out here is that many warehouses will use a combi­
nation of pick methods, depending on requirements such as velocity of 
movement, lead times, product identification, product size and accuracy re­
quirements. This can be a combination of automation and manual processes.
The following table compares the different types of G2P systems.
The more stars the better the system for that parameter.
As can be seen from Table 1.10, there are advantages and disadvantages to 
each of the systems.

With regard to the AMRs and the cobots, these can be acquired via rental or 
pay-as-you-use contracts, whereas the AS/RS systems will require a signifi­
cant capital investment unless acquired through leasing.
Conclusion
The type of system chosen has to be based on the following:
●
●size and type of products;
●
●speed of throughput required – based on the order types;
●
●number of SKUs;
●
●temperature storage requirements – ambient, chill or frozen?
●
●storage required and available space;
●
●capital available;
●
●labour availability;
●
●suitability of facility, e.g. floor loading and condition;
●
●failure/breakdown and how to get the system operational;
●
●insurance

1.15  Warehouse space calculations
Introduction
For those companies that do not have access to warehouse design software 
there are a number of simple ways to calculate the space required for specific 
operations. In this tool we have included a calculation for dock space and 
racked pallet storage.

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
58
How to do it
1. Calculation of dock space requirements
The formula for this is relatively simple, as follows:
Dock space = {Roundup ((Number of loads received × hours per load) / 
hours per shift)} × (Size of load × pallet dimensions)
Data
Receiving 20 loads per day
Each load is 26 pallets
Each pallet is 1 m × 1.2 m
45 minutes per load to unload vehicle
30 minutes per load to stage prior to put-away
8 hours per day work shift
Calculation
Roundup ((20 × 1.25)/8) × (26 × (1.2 × 1.0))
= roundup (3.125) × 31.2
= 4 × 31.2
= 124.8 square metres
Dock space = 124.80 square metres
Add double the space for working and travel area = 249.60 square metres
Total space required = 374.40 square metres
2. Pallet storage calculation
This tool enables operators to calculate the number of pallets that can be 
stored within a particular cubic area. It works on the basis of calculating 
width, length and height modules within the warehouse.
A module width is calculated as follows:
Module width = Width of aisle + 2 Pallet lengths (short side) + 100 mm
For example, given the following data:
Aisle = 2,500 mm (variable with type of MHE used)
Pallet size = 1,200 mm × 1,000 mm
­Two pallets short side = 2 × 1,000 mm = 2,000 mm

Warehouse management tools and guides
59
Clearance = 100 mm between back-to-back pallets
Therefore:
Width of module = 4,600 mm (the sequence is pallet–aisle–pallet–clearance)
A module length is calculated as follows:
Module length = Width of upright + Clearance + 2 Pallets (long side)
Rack upright plus clearance = 420 mm (120 mm × 3 × 100 mm)
Two pallets (long side) = 2 × 1,200 mm = 2,400 mm
Therefore:
Length of module = 2,820 mm (the sequence is upright–clearance–pallet–
clearance–pallet–clearance) (see Figure 1.11).
Module height = Height of pallet = 150 mm
Pallet height = 1,350 mm
Clearance above pallet = 150 mm
APR beam width of 140 mm
Therefore:
Height of module = 1,640 mm (sequence is pallet and goods–clearance–
beam height) (see Figure 1.12).
Total pallets stored within cubic capacity of a warehouse section, excluding 
receiving and dispatch areas, gangways and other areas:
(No of width modules × pallets in module width) × (No of length modules 
× pallets in module length) × (No of height modules) = No of pallets into 
cube volume of warehouse.

So, for a warehouse section with a width of 48 metres, a length of 120 
metres and a height of 10 metres:
Width calculation = 48 m ÷ 4.6 m = 10 modules
Length calculation = 120 m ÷ 2.82 m = 42 modules
Height calculation = 10 m ÷ 1.64 m = 6 pallets
Therefore:
Total number of pallets = (10 × 2) × (42 × 2) × (6) = 10,080 pallet locations 
in this warehouse storage area.

An alternative calculation to calculate space requirements is as follows:
S = (A/2 + W + 0.1 metres) × (L + 0.2 metres) × N/(h × d)
where:
S = surface area required
A = aisle width, depends on building height
W = width of pallet
L = length of pallet
N = total number of pallets
h = stacking height in number of pallets high
d = stacking depth in number of pallets deep, d = 1 for traditional storage
Note that these calculations are ‘rule of thumb’ calculations and may not fit 
all operations.
Further information
There are a number of free resources that can calculate the number of pal­
lets that can be stored within a specific area or volume. These are supplied, 
in the main, by the material handling and storage equipment companies, for 
example http://webtools.cisco-eagle.com/rack/ (archived at https://perma.

1.16  Warehouse location
Introduction
Locating a warehouse strategically and in the most cost-effective geographic 
location is one of the most important decisions a company will make. The 
decision as to whether to operate the warehouse in-house or outsource is 
covered elsewhere in this book (see tool 5.1).
The selection of a warehouse location requires multiple criteria to be as­
sessed, including both quantitative and qualitative data. Many companies 
will look at the location and size of customers which, although relevant, are

not as important as they would be when locating a retail outlet. Factors to 
take into account include the following:
●
●cost of land, rent, rates and local taxation;
●
●access to transport networks;
●
●availability of trained labour;
●
●transport links for staff;
●
●availability of funding, grants, etc;
●
●availability of existing buildings;
●
●availability and cost of utilities, including telecoms;
●
●availability of finance and resources;
●
●goods traffic flows;
●
●proximity to ports, including inland ports and airports;
●
●proximity to multi-modal facilities
●
●location of suppliers and manufacturing points;
●
●the potential neighbours, e.g. opportunities for co-loading or, negatively, 
hazardous storage facilities.
When to use
When the company is looking to locate or relocate a warehouse operation.
How to use
Figure 1.13 provides a list of criteria companies need to take into account 
when deciding on a new location for their warehouse. Fortunately, this does 
not have to be a totally manual decision as there are a number of software 
programs available that will take the majority of these criteria into account 
and produce a number of viable alternatives.
Route planning and optimization software will produce a viable location; 
however, supply chain optimization tools will further enhance this decision.

1.17  Justifying a warehouse management 
system (WMS)
Introduction
A WMS has become essential to the smooth and efficient operation of com­
plex warehousing and distribution environments around the world. 
Recognizing the need for a WMS is a reasonably straightforward exercise 
for many warehouse managers. Inaccurate inventories and pressure to 
­continually reduce costs and improve service levels make the investment 
decision almost intuitive. Investments, however, are rarely made based on 
intuition. Fortunately, the benefits of a WMS can be identified and, to a great 
extent, quantified, to provide an accurate basis for justification.
When to use
When contemplating the acquisition of a WMS.

Warehouse management tools and guides
65
How to use
Red Prairie (now JDA) suggests a five-step plan to justify the introduction of 
a WMS.
Step 1: Define the problem areas
Four principal benefits can be expected to arise from the implementation of 
a WMS. These benefits lie in the four areas that cause the majority of effi­
ciency problems in warehouses: inventory accuracy, resource management, 
customer service and visibility. The first step is to identify the main problems 
currently experienced. Begin by creating a matrix using these four benefits 
as the primary categories. Next, list the facility’s problems under each cate­
gory.
Common problems occurring under inventory accuracy include excess 
inventory, lost product, incorrectly located items and mis-picks. Under re­
source management, problems may include wasting time looking for mate­
rial, inefficient pick paths and no means of measuring performance. 
Customer service problems include ship errors and delayed shipments. 
Finally, information management problems may include stock-outs, false 
stock-outs, transaction update delays of hours and days, and data entry 
­errors.
Step 2: Estimate the costs
Once any warehousing problems have been documented, the next step is to 
estimate the costs associated with each. This step is critical to understanding 
the severity of any problems. A variety of equations and industry standards 
can be used to quickly estimate the costs. Four examples of typical costs are 
listed in Table 1.11. Having completed a quick estimate of the costs, it be­
comes easy to identify the most urgent problems – those problems that rep­
resent your biggest cost factors. The first example indicates the impact of 
ship errors. Two calculations are made: one assuming a ship accuracy of 
98.5 per cent and one assuming 96 per cent. Ship accuracy above 95 per 
cent is often thought of as excellent, yet the cost of errors in these two cases 
is significant – $44,250 and $118,000 respectively. These figures are based 
on a survey by Honeywell, which estimated the cost of a picking error to 
be $59.

$58,275
Step 3: Identify the savings
The savings associated with the reduction of inventory levels may them­
selves justify investment in a WMS. Many companies have reported reduc­
ing inventory levels by as much as 30 per cent. This level of reduction greatly 
affects carrying costs, which typically equate to 25 to 35 per cent of the cost 
of inventory (see Table 1.12).
Realistically, during the few months of implementation, cost savings will 
not be maximized because of ‘learning curve’ issues such as training and a 
re-engineered warehouse culture. However, over time, users should expect 
near perfection in those areas that were once major problems. Estimated 
cost savings should take into consideration the fact that year two will return 
greater savings than year one. Minimizing the learning curve can be 
­accomplished through training (commencing long before implementation) 
combined with good internal communication (change management).
Step 4: Determine the cost of a WMS
At this point in the process, it will be reasonably clear how much money and 
time a good WMS product will be able to save. The next step is to determine 
how much will have to be spent to integrate the system. Although vendors

use various pricing models, the components of their pricing proposals usu­
ally fall into five categories:
1	 licence fees;
2	 custom development (if applicable);
3	 computer hardware;
4	 radio frequency (RF) hardware; and
5	 services such as design, implementation, training, testing and travel.
Your internal costs to implement the system should also be included when 
defining the total cost of the implementation, as well as the cost of mainte­
nance over the time period for which you are calculating the ROI.
An alternative pricing and implementation model may also be consid­
ered. WMS systems are now available on a SaaS (Software as a Service) 
basis. In this model you typically pay a modest upfront implementation fee 
and then have a single monthly payment (including system and hardware 
costs and maintenance fees) for a specified period such as three or five years. 
Note some WMS suppliers charge on a transactional basis. Add the sum of 
the payments for the life of the contract and the implementation fee to de­
termine total system costs.

1.18  Selecting a warehouse management 
system (WMS)
Introduction
If I had to choose one tool to operate within a warehouse it would have to 
be a WMS, closely followed by ABC analysis (see tool 1.3). This tool de­
scribes how you should go about choosing a WMS.
A WMS can process data quicker and can coordinate movements within 
the warehouse. It can produce reports and handle large volumes of transac­
tions, as seen in e-commerce operations. The potential benefits of having a 
WMS in place include the following:
●
●efficient and effective labour management;
●
●improvements in productivity and accuracy;
●
●stock visibility and traceability;
●
●accurate stock-takes;
●
●reduction in picking errors;
●
●reduction in returns;
●
●accurate reporting;
●
●improved responsiveness;
●
●remote data visibility;
●
●automatic replenishments;
●
●improved customer service; and
●
●minimized paperwork.

Warehouse management tools and guides
69
To embark on a WMS project you need to be certain that you are going to 
achieve significant business benefits. Such systems need capital investment, 
unless purchasing a SaaS system, plus there are some running costs involved; 
however, the main ‘cost’ is the drive, enthusiasm and commitment needed 
from the entire warehousing team and senior management to ensure that the 
system is set up correctly, used properly and regularly optimized. A WMS is 
not a ‘quick fix’ option. A WMS is more than a stock control and data col­
lection tool. It is a system that helps you ‘automate’ your warehousing op­
erations as much as possible.
IT projects arguably should be justified on the same basis as any other 
business investment. A WMS is very much a tactical ‘execution’ system and 
is therefore a lot easier to justify than many IT projects. It forms an impor­
tant component for strategic business improvement but nevertheless is still 
tactical.
When to use
When you have decided on the purchase or rental of a WMS.
How to use
Step 1: Undertake a return on investment (ROI) calculation
The justification process (see tool 1.17) is important because it helps you to 
set a budget for your project and also focus on the functional ‘must haves’ 
rather than the ‘nice to haves’ when selecting suppliers. The key areas to 
consider are:
●
●the potential for a WMS to give you improved stock accuracy – by 
reducing errors, providing real-time information and enabling perpetual 
inventory counting;
●
●the potential for increased productivity and cost savings – through 
improved labour, equipment and space utilization;
●
●the need for improved traceability – a WMS can give you two-way 
traceability, almost as a by-product of being in place;
●
●improved customer and client service – through overall improved 
warehouse control, improved pick and dispatch accuracy.
The more transactions per day (e.g. pallet moves, picks) and locations in 
the warehouse, the greater the potential for payback and the greater the

justification. In addition, warehouses use expensive equipment where opti­
mization can bring significant savings – sometimes to such an extent that 
less equipment needs to be purchased and fewer staff employed.
Understand the cost methods used by WMS vendors. These can be bro­
ken down into four main components:
1	 Licences – the software licence needed to run the system. Typically, this is 
charged by ‘user’, i.e. PC user or radio data terminal user, although 
different models are now being offered, including paying by transaction 
and/or paying monthly rather than outright purchase of the system.
2	 Professional services – the costs for project management, training and 
go-live support.
3	 Development costs for requirements not catered for in the package, 
including interfaces to third-party systems.
4	 Support costs – typically an annual cost based on licence costs and often 
development costs; the scope of service and cost varies significantly from 
supplier to supplier.
Ensure that the suppliers you approach give you costs for all of the above. 
Ask them to indicate which prices are fixed and which are variable. Watch 
out for hidden costs such as travel costs, travel time and project manage­
ment time. Summarize all the costs in a spreadsheet, showing the initial cost 
and then costs for years one to five with accumulated totals. You may be 
surprised by the results!
In addition, there are the hardware and infrastructure costs. These costs 
have to be considered in terms of project budget and ROI, of course, but in 
many cases can be managed as a separate project with interdependencies 
with the main project.
Step 2: Decide on the process
Modern WMSs are highly configurable, normally by the end user, and 
should be capable of working in virtually any type of warehousing environ­
ment. In the past, the production of a large, detailed invitation to tender 
(ITT) was an important part of the WMS selection process. This reflected 
the limited functionality of most systems at that time. A major disadvantage 
of ITTs is that they cannot hope to take account of a company’s future re­
quirements and are often over-prescriptive. The other disadvantage is that 
many WMS providers will often not respond to ITTs. They consume a vast 
amount of time, which the vendor might prefer to spend in other directions 
under its own control.

Warehouse management tools and guides
71
There are spreadsheet templates that are downloadable from the internet; 
however, many of these are, or were originally, prepared by WMS vendors 
and are slanted towards their products. Most WMS vendors therefore view 
such documents with suspicion.
Step 3: Understand and analyse your existing systems
If your ERP/business system already has a WMS module, then you should 
examine and analyse this in the first place. The same due diligence applies to 
this selection as to any other system, but normally any small shortfalls in 
functionality are outweighed by reducing any risks of systems not interfac­
ing with each other reliably and accurately.
Similarly, if your warehouse is highly automated, with cranes, conveyors 
or sortation systems, you may wish to focus on the WMS provided by the 
automation systems company. This will typically be known as a warehouse 
control system or WCS. Again, shortfalls in functionality are often out­
weighed by the avoidance of an interface to an external WMS. There are 
many papers available on this subject and some of these are mentioned 
below.
Step 4: Is there an in-house development capability?
Owing to the ‘packaged’ nature of the WMS market nowadays, in-house 
development is very rarely viable as a typical WMS vendor will have per­
haps 100+ clients over which it amortizes the continuous development costs; 
these same 100+ clients serve as a very valuable and thorough proving 
ground for the product in question. In-house development is sometimes vi­
able if the overall requirements are particularly specialized or require spe­
cialized integration with existing in-house systems.
Step 5: Request for information
Prepare a short RFI document (request for information); this should typi­
cally be no more than a few pages long. In this document you describe your 
business, your future business direction, your warehouse and your plans for 
the warehouse. Then talk in broad terms about what you want to achieve 
from the WMS.
By this stage you will have completed an operational specification for the 
warehouse to gain capital approval. The key elements from this specification 
are an ideal base for the RFI, for example number of loading bays, number 
and type of reserve locations, number of pick face locations, and pick-and-
pack station details. Of particular relevance is the number of users, i.e. 
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
72
­administrative users, forklift truck drivers, pickers, packers and so on. 
Provide a guide to the number of transactions per day (receipts, put-aways, 
picks, dispatches) and indicate if there are any significant peaks across the 
day, week or month.
Do not try to describe how the system should work – in fact it can be 
dangerous to be too specific at this point, as there may be faster, better, 
cheaper ways of doing things and part of the selection process is to see how 
potential suppliers can guide you in this regard. You could use the services 
of a specialist consultant to help you.
Within the RFI, ask the vendor for budget costs and implementation 
timescales. You should ask for supplier information, including:
●
●company history;
●
●financial history and status;
●
●number of sites using its current WMS product;
●
●who owns the IP (intellectual property – source code) for the WMS;
●
●client list, especially those companies operating in your marketplace;
●
●daily rates and support charges;
●
●support cover;
●
●development plans;
●
●track record.
We suggest that you send this RFI to 6 to 10 suppliers initially. Focus on 
suppliers that have experience in your market – this is particularly the case 
if you are a third-party logistics provider; WMS vendors with no experience 
in this sector are unlikely to have the functionality and importantly the ex­
pertise to help you. Focus on suppliers that have a track record linking to 
any business or ERP system you are operating.
At this stage you will need to decide whether to purchase the software 
and hardware outright or to rent the software and operate it on a third-
party server platform. A SaaS (Software as a Service) WMS is an internet-
based application that is developed, hosted and maintained by a third-party 
software provider on secure servers. The vendor rents out the system to a 
number of different clients. These clients, in turn, will choose the various 
modules within the software they require and pay for them as they use them. 
The advantages are:
●
●lower cost of entry;
●
●reduced start-up costs;

73
●
●instant upgrades;
●
●user-driven innovation;
●
●ability to turn on and off as required, e.g. to run a temporary warehouse 
operation.
­Such a system will be attractive to start-up companies and small and me­
dium-sized enterprises (SMEs), although it could benefit larger companies 
that are looking for a temporary fix. Potential disadvantages include the 
possibility of poor internet links between the companies and worries over 
data security.
Step 6: Short list
Produce a short list of three to five suppliers. Price, of course, is not the main 
criterion at this stage but can be used to rule out suppliers that will exceed 
your budget. Get the suppliers to visit you for an informal meeting. This will 
help you get a feel for their company – how professional they are, how care­
fully they listen and respond to your needs, how well they answer your 
­questions.
Before you get into the detailed demonstration stage, do a little more 
checking on each of the suppliers; this will help you to reject unsuitable sup­
pliers at an early stage. A good way of doing this is to telephone-interview 
at least six reference sites, preferably sites you choose from a longer list. 
These calls should all be made with the knowledge of the supplier – unless 
you have contacts with their clients already.
Get the short-listed suppliers to provide you with a tailored demonstra­
tion. Get them to focus on what you believe is especially important for your 
operation – for instance, pick face replenishment, or kitting and assembly. 
At some time during the selection process you should also get them to 
give you an overview of their company, products and people and of their 
strategy – in terms of both company and product.
Visit their head office to get a better understanding of their culture, man­
agement style and team working. It is very important to get a good ‘people’ 
fit with any organization you select. It is always worth asking the suppliers 
why they think they should be selected for your project.
The reference site visit/s is often the crux of supplier selection. Make sure 
you are given a choice of sites, not just ‘the one’, and make sure it is similar 
in terms of size and processes to yours – or preferably slightly larger and 
slightly more complex.

If you have identified any gaps in functionality, now is the time to get 
these specified and costed. The supplier should be asked to provide an ac­
curate project cost, clearly identifying any variable costs. This is where the 
contacts you have developed with the suppliers’ reference sites will pay off, 
as you can talk to them about how well the supplier worked to budget 
and time.
Step 7: Final choice
Choose the most appropriate supplier. Utilize a decision matrix, taking into 
account the criteria mentioned above (see tool 5.8).
Summary
Here are 20 tips for choosing a WMS:
1	 Have a clear long-term vision of what your warehouse could look like in 
the future – this will help you ensure that you choose a solution that is 
sufficiently scalable, flexible and functional.
2	 Ensure complete ‘buy-in’ from senior management.
3	 Keep an open mind about how your WMS will operate – let the WMS 
vendors listen to your needs and show you different ways of using their 
solution.
4	 Ensure that your processes are working efficiently before introducing a 
WMS.
5	 Look for a supplier that is warehouse and logistics focused; more 
generalist companies will often change strategy and reduce their focus 
on warehousing as their fortunes change.
6	 Look for a supplier with a strong team of warehousing specialists, 
otherwise you will be training the supplier in warehousing or at best will 
be reliant on one or two individuals.
7	 Choose a WMS vendor that you get along with – it is about partnership.
8	 Make sure that help desk and support cover is available during your 
working hours – 24/7 if necessary.
9	 Look for a WMS that has been specified by warehouse and logistics 
professionals, rather than by programmers and analysts.
10	 Make sure that the product is relatively new but with a sound track 
record, and uses the latest software technology.

11	 Make sure that the product is being developed on an ongoing basis to 
meet future warehousing and supply chain needs. Historically, WMS 
vendors have made their money by charging their customers significant 
amounts of money for development work. This has several major 
disadvantages: it invariably costs more than functionality provided as a 
package, it extends the project time, and it introduces risk (bespoke 
software often fails to perform due to both technical issues and 
differences in interpretation of the specification). A further disadvantage 
is that custom software often makes software upgrades cumbersome, 
risky and expensive.
12	 Choose a WMS vendor that can demonstrate a significant track record 
in your type of warehousing operation; get them to take you to customer 
sites to see the WMS in action, and make sure that you talk to the users 
and the management team at each site.
13	 Look for a WMS that is an end-user-configurable package. Nowadays it 
is impossible to predict future WMS needs, particularly in a third-party 
environment, so flexibility is the name of the game.
14	 Where small but important changes are needed to make the system meet 
your very specific needs, ensure that these changes do not compromise 
the package upgrade route.
15	 Look for relevant reference sites. Look for a vendor with a good, active 
user group, and ensure that this group has real influence on the product 
strategy and support services.
16	 Ensure that the vendor is of the right size – not so small that it has 
insufficient resource and not so large that you have no influence on 
product development and service levels.
17	 Ensure that the vendor will help and support you in commercial and 
technical discussions with suppliers, customers and clients.
18	 Have an in-depth demonstration of the WMS. Make sure that potential 
users of the system go along. Ensure that the WMS is easy to use and 
related closely to your operation.
19	 Make sure that you involve your IT team in ensuring that the WMS 
vendor can work with you to provide solid interfaces with your other 
business systems. Do not let them dominate the project – a WMS is a 
tactical, operational solution and, as such, in most cases the project 
should be managed and run by logistics people.

20	 Make sure that you identify a project champion in your organization, 
build a team around him or her and get the champion to own the WMS 
implementation.

1.19  Choosing between a best-of-breed 
warehouse management system (WMS) 
and an enterprise resource planning 
(ERP) WMS module
Introduction
For omnichannel retailers and those with complex operations, up until very 
recently, choosing a best-of-breed warehouse management system (WMS) 
over an enterprise resource planning (ERP) WMS module was quite com­
mon. However, according to enVista, ‘the functionality of ERP WMS sys­
tems has continued to evolve, leaving companies with a tough choice – 
which WMS is best for our company and our needs?’
Many businesses are already using an enterprise resource planning (ERP) 
system of some sort such as Infor, Oracle, SAP, Sage and Microsoft – and 
these solutions also offer warehouse management capabilities. Some are ru­
dimentary and very basic, whereas others are more feature rich. Depending 
on the type of business and complexity of your warehouse processes, you 
may find the functionality offered as standard within your ERP is perfectly

adequate – this may well be the case for SMEs. ERP vendors have been 
slowly replicating best-of-breed functionality.
Best-of-breed systems have interfaces to integrate with the host ERP; 
however, companies can remove any integration concerns by going with an 
ERP WMS. In the past companies found that the value they received in a 
best-of-breed WMS and its complementary products far outweighed inte­
gration and increased licence costs.
A significant increase in order volumes, together with a competitive la­
bour market where salaries have increased significantly and labour short­
ages are commonplace, has heralded an increase in the use of automation 
and robotics. As a result we are now also seeing the introduction of more 
sophisticated and comprehensive warehouse execution systems and ware­
house control systems.
With the evolution of warehouse control and warehouse execution sys­
tems and their ability to interface with ERP systems, companies are finding 
that they are less dependent on best-of-breed WMS and more likely to uti­
lize the WMS module in their ERP solution.
When to use
When deciding to purchase a new WMS, replace an existing WMS, or when 
purchasing a new ERP system.
How to use
One of the main issues in determining which system to go with is that com­
panies are made up of departments and people that often have differing, or 
even conflicting priorities.
The operations team will be looking for a comprehensive suite of func­
tionalities, while finance will be concerned with cost, and the IT team with 
having to deal with multiple systems.
The WMS you select must ultimately align with your company’s short- 
and long-term performance goals while providing a competitive advantage. 
This is a decision for the long term, so it should be treated as such! There are 
some essential questions to ask when deciding whether to implement a ded­
icated WMS solution or choose a module from your ERP vendor. These are 
as follows:
●
●How will improved warehouse efficiency from buying a separate WMS 
contribute towards your business goals – both now and longer term?
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
78
●
●To what extent can the ERP’s WMS record and manage KPIs in the 
warehouse?
●
●How easily can the following key metrics be tracked?
●
●
time required to complete routine stock movements;
●
●
goods receiving and put-away processing times;
●
●
stock replenishment time frames;
●
●
‘On Time In Full’ order-picking trends, pick accuracy levels and 
operator productivity;
●
●
stock accuracy and stock audit discrepancies.
●
●How easily can the ERP solution be adapted to reflect changing warehouse 
operations? Can these be implemented without incurring extra costs?
●
●Does the ERP vendor have the real-world warehouse management 
expertise to help refine existing processes during the implementation 
programme?
●
●How well does the ERP’s functionality fit your current business processes 
and are compromises required? Can custom functionality be easily 
added?
●
●Does the ERP module support wave picking for e-commerce, perpetual 
inventory counting, value add packing, allergen management, customs 
and excise reporting, compliance procedures or track and trace?
●
●Can the WMS vendor support you with in-house integration capabilities, 
to ensure all systems can communicate in real time?
While ERP WMS systems are fully integrated with the ERP suite, the lack of 
autonomy between the two systems can cause unforeseen enhancements to 
obtain comparable functionality.
Many of the best-of-breed WMS software providers have complementary 
software solutions for complete fulfilment execution that span several chan­
nels including retail, wholesale, e-commerce and marketplaces such as 
Amazon.
Example
An example of the benefits of a dedicated WMS is provided by Indigo 
­software.

A best-of-breed WMS integrated with their existing ERP system delivered 
their client the following benefits:
●
●more efficient raw materials delivery to production and improved 
replenishments in the manufacturing area;
●
●real-time inventory accuracy at every location – no searching for available 
put-away spaces;
●
●optimized picking with pre-allocated travel paths to minimize time 
between locations;
●
●no time delays between inventory transactions and system updates;
●
●accurate cycle counting and improved stock auditing.
‘Overall, the client’s WMS investment generated significant cost savings and 
they quickly recouped their initial capital expenditure in reduced labour 
hours required.’
Conclusion
The WMS you select must ultimately align with your short- and long-term 
performance goals while providing a competitive advantage. This is a deci­
sion for the long term, so it should be treated as such!
Invest in the WMS that creates a competitive advantage for your supply 
chain by enabling impactful service and cost benefits.

1.20  How to implement a WMS
Introduction
Once you have decided you really need a WMS, and you have selected a 
WMS vendor, the hard work begins. There is no substitute for good and 
robust project management, alongside the selection of a good team. The 
WMS project must be owned from the top of the organization to the bot­
tom. A project sponsor is an invaluable member of the project team – some­
one who ensures that the focus is maintained on delivering business benefits 
with minimal disruption.
A project champion needs to be appointed to effectively take charge of 
the project and this person will often come from a warehousing rather than 
an IT background. Crucial to this is having project management experience. 
IT staff should also be represented on the team, but increasingly IT is seen 
as a business support function as opposed to the main ‘drivers’ of a WMS 
project. Too many projects have failed when the project manager has not 
been experienced or has not been able to concentrate fully on the project 
itself.
Use the guidance and support of your WMS vendor as much as possible; 
a major part of your selection process should have been to identify a vendor 
that adds value during the implementation process. This guidance needs to 
be paid for, of course, so make sure that you have budgeted for it.
Methodology before technology is the key reminder for virtually all IT 
projects, particularly WMS projects. Ensure that your warehouse is running 
in an optimal manner with tried-and-tested processes before trying to imple­
ment a WMS: otherwise expect failure! That is not to say you cannot intro­
duce new and better processes while implementing a WMS – this is often the 
case – but if your warehouse is disorganized, tackle that problem before 
doing anything else. Do not automate a bad process: you just get to the 
wrong result faster.
In the case of a greenfield operation, methodology before technology is 
not normally possible as timescales are tight. Here it is vital to have a strong 
and experienced management team with a logistics background. In addition, 
you may want to use the services of a specialist consultant or an interim 
manager. Interim management can be a very cost-effective way of providing 
the extra resource needed in this change management process.
The scope of the project should be documented. The scope is just building 
on the WMS description you wrote for your RFI, i.e. what you want the

­system to do for your business. This need not be an arduous or tedious task, 
but it is important to focus on top-level business requirements and ware­
house processes rather than being prescriptive as to how the WMS should 
function in detail at this stage. This top-level approach is particularly rele­
vant where a well-established packaged solution has been purchased – in the 
final analysis, such a solution should be highly flexible and configurable.
Interfaces to external systems, including ERP systems, transport manage­
ment systems, warehouse control and automation systems and parcel carri­
ers all have to be thought about and specified. This is a specialist area and 
can be one of the riskiest areas of a WMS project if not managed properly.
A project plan should be drawn up – often the WMS vendor will have a 
template available (see Table  1.13). The plan will detail all the tasks re­
quired, responsibilities and timescales. Regular review meetings will moni­
tor progress against the plan and make corrective actions as required. Make 
sure that there is no project creep: learn to say no! Start as simply as possible 
and get some quick wins.
The contract
A contract should be drawn up between you and the vendor. This should be 
done before you commit any major finances, but far enough into the initial 
stages of the project that you can have it scoped, planned and costed.
Your RFI and scope document form a key part of this contract, as does 
all documentation received from the vendor. An outline plan should have 
been produced by this stage, showing key milestones and deliverables. This 
plan also forms part of the contract.
The contract should as far as possible be in plain English. It does not 
necessarily need to be produced by a lawyer, but you should get appropriate 
legal advice. The contract needs to be produced by someone with knowledge 
of the principles of contract law.
Infrastructures
The IT infrastructure needs to be planned around the WMS. Your internal 
IT department can help with this, assuming they have the skills and re­
sources. Alternatively, you can contract it out or in certain cases the WMS 
vendor will take on complete responsibility.
The IT infrastructure will consist of servers to run the applications, PC 
workstations, network infrastructure and printers. In some cases you will 
also use radio data terminals (RDTs) or a voice- or vision-enabled technol­
ogy for the system. Both are mini-projects in their own right that need to be

planned and specified. Often the WMS vendor can provide the subsystem, or 
you may prefer your IT supplier to provide the wireless network backbone 
and then the WMS vendor or hardware vendor provides the necessary 
equipment. Note that if you are considering a SaaS, the software will be run 
on the vendor’s server to which you will have remote access.
Pilot project
Set up a pilot project, either as a conference room pilot or ideally in the 
warehouse itself. Focus on one customer, one product group or one func­
tion, such as receiving. Create a test plan and continue to test to ensure that 
the system is operating as required and that operatives understand the sys­
tem and are working optimally.
Start working out how you are going to do a ‘data take-on’, i.e. all the 
data you need to start and run the system, including locations, location 
maps, product codes, product details, pallet sizes and configurations. A lot 
of these data can come from your ERP system if present. You can construct 
spreadsheet templates to compile them. You also need to start planning the 
‘rules’ within the warehouse, for example put-away rules, replenishment 
rules, FIFO, LIFO, etc. If you are moving into a warehouse with existing 
stock, consider how you are going to label and record this stock.
Remember that you are testing for failure as well as testing for success. 
This is an ideal opportunity to test the interfaces to external systems; inter­
face testing invariably takes longer than planned.

Ensure that you train the trainers or super users and then cascade the 
training down to the users; this way, you will build your own in-house ex­
pertise.
Going live
The go-live stage needs to be planned carefully. Go live can be a ‘big bang’ 
or can be phased, according to the nature of your operation. You are likely 
to need extra personnel during this period. Budget very carefully for the on-
site support you may need from the WMS vendor; costs can escalate in this 
area, particularly for out-of-hours, evening and weekend support. It is likely 
that your performance levels will be low to start with until the operation has 
moved up the learning curve; for this reason it is best to go live during a 
quiet period if possible, although ensure that your key personnel are not on 
holiday at this time.
In summary
As with all system projects, and indeed projects in general, the more you 
plan and prepare, the better your results will be. The old adage is ‘Fail to 
plan, plan to fail’. Supplier selection is the crux of a successful project, along 
with good project management and good project ownership. Obal (2007) 
says that during implementation the following have to be avoided:
●
●establishing an unrealistic implementation schedule;
●
●buying a low-end system and expecting high-end results;
●
●failing to track vendor progress;
●
●failing to develop a contingency plan;
●
●overselling the system to users;
●
●lack of system integration training;
●
●providing the software vendor with faulty, incomplete or out-of-date 
data;
●
●thinking a newly integrated WMS will eliminate all inefficiencies within 
the operation;
●
●blaming the WMS provider for glitches that occur during the software’s 
initial launch;
●
●failing to audit the results to see if the system is working as efficiently as 
possible.

1.21  Warehouse maturity scan, by Jeroen 
van den Berg
Introduction
This tool enables companies to assess the maturity of their warehouse op­
erations (an introduction to maturity models is given in tool 4.7). The model 
comes from Highly Competitive Warehouse Management by Jeroen van den 
Berg (2012). In his book he makes a distinction between four phases of 
warehouse maturity:
●
●Phase 1 – Reactive. The warehouse is not well structured.
●
●Phase 2 – Effective. Processes are streamlined with more transparency in 
the operation.
●
●Phase 3 – Responsive. Processes are better planned and controlled by the 
use of intelligent IT.
●
●Phase 4 – Collaborative. The warehouse is an equal partner in the supply 
chain and generates more added value.
When to use
The scan can be used to assess the maturity of a distribution centre.

89
How to use
The assessment requires answers to 18 specific questions about your current 
warehouse operation. The four answers to each question represent an in­
creasing level of sophistication. If you believe that your operation ranks in 
between two answers, you should select the lowest answer; for example, if 
your distribution centre almost meets the requirements of answer c but not 
completely, then choose answer b.
Example question
Are the processes in the distribution centre formally specified?
a	 No, we do not have standard operating procedures.
b	 Somewhat, we have specified our processes, but they are somewhere in a 
drawer and/or outdated.
c	 Yes, we do have up-to-date standard operating procedures, which are 
being actively followed by operators.
d	 Yes, we do have up-to-date standard operating procedures, which we 
use for process analysis and for the instruction and operational manage­
ment of operators. A comprehensive maturity model can be completed

1.22  Warehouse risk assessments
Introduction
Warehouses, like any industrial facility, can be dangerous places to work in, 
especially with the movement of forklift trucks, the risk of slips and trips, and 
people working at height. So, to ensure a safe and secure environment,

­companies need to undertake risk assessments regularly. (A full description of 
risk assessment is included in tool 4.12.) Note that:
●
●a hazard can be anything – whether work materials, equipment, work 
methods or practices – that has the potential to cause harm;
●
●­a risk is the chance, high or low, that somebody may be harmed by the 
hazard.
The following are potential risk areas:
●
●falls from height;
●
●slips, trips and falls;
●
●manual handling;
●
●falling objects;
●
●operation of MHE;
●
●operation of other machinery;
●
●traffic movements;
●
●portable electrical equipment;
●
●lighting;
●
●hazardous substances; and
●
●fire.
When to use
To ensure the safety of all visitors to, and staff working in, a warehouse.
How to use
The guiding principles that should be considered throughout the risk assess­
ment process can be broken down into a series of steps:
●
●Step 1: Identifying hazards and those at risk.
●
●Step 2: Evaluating and prioritizing risks.
●
●Step 3: Deciding on preventive action.
●
●Step 4: Taking action.
●
●Step 5: Monitoring and reviewing.
As can be seen in the risk assessment form in Table 1.14, it is essential that 
there is a suitable person responsible for the action to be taken, and that a

1.23  Contingency planning for the 
warehouse
The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for a contingency plan or busi­
ness continuity plan.
Many companies will have plans in place for certain eventualities; how­
ever, you cannot cover everything. The Covid pandemic was an example of 
this.
Natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods etc together with 
labour issues, system failures and supplier problems can all have a signifi­
cant impact on your warehouse operation.
Contingency planning assists companies to minimize the impact of these 
disruptions in order to maintain operational continuity and recover more 
quickly.
An explosion close to an ASOS warehouse resulted in the company being 
out of action for six weeks. A fire at another of their warehouses a few years 
later resulted in a quicker recovery, having instigated a robust contingency 
plan.
According to Kyle Krug from Legacy Supply Chain there are three steps 
to creating a robust warehouse contingency plan. I have added a fourth – 
Test.

When to use
Contingency plans should be in place for an existing warehouse operation 
and need to be reviewed regularly. New warehouses should also be risk as­
sessed and a contingency plan drawn up.
How to use
Step 1 - Assess
The first step to create an effective contingency plan is to perform a risk as­
sessment within your warehouse (see tool 1.22).
Start by mapping out business-critical processes, procedures, technolo­
gies and personnel to create a foundation for the plan. Next imagine various 
worst-case scenarios and formulate a response for each.
Ensure you have an up-to-date contact list for emergency services and 
other stakeholders.
Step 2 – Plan
Once the risk assessments have been completed the contingency plan can be 
formed. Irrespective of the likely disruption, every warehouse contingency 
plan should outline the following:
●
●Specific triggers. These dictate what will set your plan in motion.
●
●Response strategy. Your plan should include a brief overview of how 
your warehouse staff should respond to the situation at hand.
●
●Key roles and responsibilities. Clearly define who is responsible for 
enacting different parts of the plan and what is expected of them. Include 
a substitute to cover for absence.
●
●Leadership depth and training. Continuous training and cross-training 
efforts within the warehouse will prove an invaluable time investment 
should disaster strike.

●
●Technology. One of the most critical elements of any warehouse 
contingency plan is a thorough schematic of all technology systems such 
as warehouse management systems, warehouse control systems, labour 
management and timekeeping systems, enterprise resource planning 
systems and transportation management systems – as well as the systems 
they connect to.
●
●Labour. Another critical element of a warehouse contingency plan is 
to have labour providers and staffing agencies able to react quickly to 
your call.
●
●Timeline. Explain to your employees when each step of your contingency 
plan should take place – for example, whether an action needs to occur 
within the first hour of the plan being implemented or the first day.
*NOTE You will need access to those customers and suppliers who will be affected in the immediate 
future

●
●Alternative work schedules. Certain emergency scenarios, such as 
Covid-19, will require you to drastically reduce the number of on-site 
employees. Build alternative work schedules into your warehouse 
contingency plan to ensure that all of your business-critical operations 
are completed, even with a reduced workforce.
●
●Remote work arrangements. If there’s anything the Covid pandemic has 
taught us, it’s that every business – even warehousing – needs to have a 
plan in place for remote work arrangements. Your warehouse contingency 
plan should detail which workers are considered essential and which 
ones can work from home; be sure to provide the necessary resources and 
equipment to help remote workers get set up.
●
●Attendance requirements. When creating your warehouse contingency 
plan, be sure to include information about attendance requirements and 
expectations, and policies to address these concerns.
●
●Payment and benefits information. Similar to attendance, depending on 
the nature of the emergency, your employees may have concerns about 
payment and benefits. Take care to include specific information about 
both in your warehouse contingency plan.
●
●Corporate responsibility. For more high-risk scenarios, it’s important 
that you demonstrate to your staff that your organization is taking the 
necessary precautions to ensure their safety. Provide detailed explanations 
of workplace safety protocol, as well as offering a point of contact who 
can field employee questions or concerns.
●
●Evacuation plans. In some situations – say, a flood or a fire – it may be 
necessary to evacuate your staff from the warehouse. To accommodate 
for this possibility, your contingency plan should include specific 
instructions on how to proceed, as well as clearly outline an evacuation 
route.
●
●Communication models. It’s important that your contingency plan maps 
out a structured flow of communication, and that you have prepared 
message templates. This is imperative not only for internal communications, 
but also for potential external communication should the situation attract 
media attention. Having someone who has had media training is also a 
good idea.

­Step 3 – Communication
You need to clearly communicate your plan to all levels of your business.
The best way to do this is to start by determining the different groups 
within your warehouse. For example, your site leadership team might con­
sist of a facility manager, an HR manager, an operations manager and vari­
ous supervisors. This group should be separate from your senior leadership 
team, which might consist of VPs and C-suite executives and your ware­
house staff.
The next step is to create a tiered chain of communication so that indi­
viduals in leadership positions have a clear understanding of whom they’re 
responsible for delivering information to.
There needs to be documentation that your employees can easily access 
and can refer to for guidance. An employee FAQ that your staff can refer to 
if they have additional questions about your contingency plan is a good 
idea.
Ensure that all new employees are aware of the plans.
Copies of the plan should be stored in various places including off-site.
Ideally, your warehouse contingency plan communication effort should 
be multi-faceted so that messaging is consistently reinforced. This can also 
include face-to-face meetings and videoconferencing.
An important note: these should be considered living documents and 
regularly updated with new information to ensure accuracy, e.g. changes in 
contact details etc.
Having an established business continuity committee that meets at least 
annually to review and update plans and responsibilities is advised.
You should communicate your organization’s contingency plan to ware­
house staff well in advance of an actual emergency. There’s really no way to 
accurately predict when disaster might strike, so it’s important that your 
employees are prepared, no matter what.
Step 4 – Test
Contingency planning and business continuity are all about preparation and 
diligence. Creating mock scenarios in which key staff are required to acti­
vate certain elements of your contingency plan can prove invaluable should 
you ever have to actually enact it. From practising technology fails, to being 
able to pick and process orders manually, to moving large groups of people 
to a safe area, there are any number of ways to practise your warehouse 
contingency plan ahead of time in a controlled environment.
Finally, having a qualified third party to evaluate your plan is also ­advised.

1.24  How to ‘green’ your warehouse 
and save energy
Introduction
In recent years environmental issues have come to the fore, both at home 
and at work, with corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives concen­
trating on the environment, waste, health and safety, and the local commu­
nity. The introduction of these initiatives does not have to cost the earth. In 
the majority of cases there are grants and significant opportunities for cost 
saving as well as the resulting reduction of the company’s impact on the 
environment.
The following list provides warehouse managers with ideas on how to 
reduce their impact on the environment and thus help companies achieve 
their CSR targets and save energy:
●
●Lighting in a non-automated warehouse can be up to 70 per cent of the 
total energy costs. Ways to reduce lighting costs are as follows:
●
●
introduce energy-efficient lighting;
●
●
switch off all non-essential lighting out of business hours;
●
●
install movement sensors and timers;
●
●
introduce and regularly clean skylights and clerestory windows to 
increase the use of natural light;
●
●
switch off lights when daylight is sufficient;
●
●
­turn off external lights when daylight is sufficient;
●
●
switch off office lights on exit or introduce motion sensors.
●
●Use of alternative energy production methods:
●
●
solar panels;
●
●
wind turbines;
●
●
biomass boilers.

●
●Heating/air conditioning can make up 15 per cent of a warehouse’s 
energy costs:
●
●
use zoned and time-controlled thermostats that are set accurately 
(a 1 per cent reduction in temperature on the thermostat can reduce 
heating bills by 8 per cent);
●
●
experiment with switch-on times for heating and air conditioning and 
switch off well before close of business;
●
●
ensure hot water supply is sized in relation to site occupancy.
●
●Install time controls on equipment that is not required after close of 
business, such as vending machines.
●
●Use of natural ventilation systems:
●
●
use ventilation stacks;
●
●
use atria and automatic window openings combined with automatic 
control systems;
●
●
use passive cooling such as breathable walls;
●
●
use the effective thermal mass of buildings to reduce cooling and 
ventilation energy.
●
●Cooling the warehouse can also increase energy costs:
●
●
introduce sunlight reflectors;
●
●
use mobile air handling units;
●
●
switch off equipment when not in use;
●
●
ensure all doors have sufficient seals to prevent air and water entry.
●
●Make better use of resources:
●
●
rainwater collection for reuse in vehicle washing, flushing toilets, etc;
●
●
low water use in sanitary appliances;
●
●
check insulation levels and increase where practical and cost-effective;
●
●
reuse or recycle where feasible and cost-effective;
●
●
move to utilizing plastic totes/bins in place of cardboard;
●
●
utilize plastic or aluminium pallets;
●
●
use of gas, electric or hybrid forklift trucks;
●
●
in-rack charging for narrow aisle trucks and shuttle systems.
●
●Movement reduction within the warehouse to reduce energy consumption:
●
●
use of ABC analysis (see tool 1.3) to ensure that popular items are 
placed close to the dispatch area.

●
●Kinetic-energy plates positioned on the access road to produce power 
from vehicles entering and leaving the site.
●
●Introduce car-sharing schemes for staff.
●
●Encourage staff to walk or cycle to work or take public transport.
●
●Introduce training in green initiatives such as fuel-efficient driving.
●
●Source materials locally, such as packaging, paper, MHE, etc.
●
●Continually assess the situation by walking around the warehouse at 
various times during operating hours.
●
●Plant trees and shrubs to assist with the removal of emissions.
●
●Finally, ensure that your warehouse is operating effectively – no 
unnecessary movements, accurate picking and dispatch and effective 
utilization of space and packaging materials.

1.25  Hazardous packaging and labelling
The consignor/supplier is responsible for ensuring that packaging of hazard­
ous items conforms to the regulations for the product. The packaging can

Warehouse management tools and guides
101
vary from a cardboard box or paper bag for low-risk powders in small 
quantities to very sophisticated double-skinned stainless-steel packages for 
more complex high-risk products.
To promote the safe storage and transportation of dangerous goods, an 
international system of classification has been introduced (the UN 
Classification System). Examples are:
●
●UN1263: Paint or paint-related materials
●
●UN1498: Sodium nitrate
●
●UN1500: Sodium nitrite
An up-to-date list can be found at https:bit.ly/3K3KMXu
The system divides the different types of dangerous goods into classified 
groups, each group identified by a code marking. There are nine classes, 
some with divisions, as shown in Table 1.16.
In general, the package needs to be UN approved and compatible with 
the product. For every UN number there is a list of packaging options avail­
able to the packer.
All over the world there are different laws on how to identify the hazard­
ous properties of chemicals (called ‘classification’) and how information 
about these hazards is then passed to users (through labels and safety data 
sheets for workers). This can be confusing because the same chemical can 
have different hazard descriptions in different countries; for example, a 
chemical could be labelled as ‘toxic’ in one country but not in another. This 
also acts as a barrier to international trade.
Given the expanding international market in chemical substances and 
mixtures, to help protect people and the environment and to facilitate trade, 
the United Nations has developed a Globally Harmonized System (GHS) on 
classification and labelling. The GHS is a single worldwide system for clas­
sifying and communicating the hazardous properties of industrial and con­
sumer chemicals. GHS sits alongside the UN Transport of Dangerous Goods 
system. The GHS is not a law – it’s an international agreement. To make the 
GHS legally apply, each country or bloc of countries must adopt the GHS 
through legislation. EU Member States agreed to adopt the GHS across the 
EU through a direct-acting Regulation, the European Regulation (EC) No 
1272/2008 on Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and 
mixtures. This is also known as the CLP Regulation or just CLP. This will 
finally lead to a reduction in the regulatory burden on manufacturers, which 
currently have to struggle with many different systems of classification de­
pending on the countries they manufacture in and export to. Figure 1.16 
shows the new pictograms.

1.26  Automatic identification (autoID)
Introduction
Automatic identification methods have made a great difference to accurate 
visibility of inventory in the supply chain. The most common methods in use 
in supply chains are 1D (one-dimensional) and 2D (two-dimensional) bar­
codes, and radio frequency identification (RFID).
Clearly, it is much quicker to read a barcode or RFID tag than to enter a 
10- to 20-digit product identity on a keyboard. However, it is the accuracy 
of such an operation that makes the big difference. Studies indicate that a 
trained keyboard operator will make an average of one mistake per 300 
keystrokes. In contrast, the worst accuracy rate for barcode reading is 
­approximately one error per 300,000 readings, but may be as low as one 
error per 10 million operations for certain types of barcode.
Since barcode labels are easily affixed or can be directly printed onto 
virtually any material (mailing tubes, envelopes, boxes, cans, bottles, pack­
ages, books and more), they are the most cost-effective and accurate solu­
tion for capturing data.
When to use
Barcodes and RFID systems are used to allocate identities to materials and 
products with a unique identity per SKU. Anybody can implement a 
­barcoding or RFID system in their own operation for items in the ­warehouse 
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

105
or to track production orders through the factory, for example. Note, how­
ever, that if you want these identities to be recognized outside your business, 
they must be registered with a national body, thus ensuring that the identity 
is unique in the world.
How to use
The first stage of an autoID project is to be clear about why you want to 
implement barcodes, and what benefits you are expecting. Different barcod­
ing and RFID systems exist. In this section we will concentrate on 1D and 
2D barcodes.
When barcodes are used on a widespread public basis, such as printed on 
an internationally sold item, it is important to register the symbology to 
protect the data, especially from product/code copiers. However, if the bar­
code is for in-house use, it does not need to be registered. Registering a 
barcode is a simple process that can be performed through third-party on­
line sites or through barcode global organizations such as GS1.
All symbologies have some limitations on the number (size) and type of 
characters that can be encoded (set). Barcodes can encode numeric only, al­
phabetical only or alphanumeric character sets. The values of these digits 
are determined by standards managed by GS1, Global Standards One, for­
merly known as the Uniform Code Council (UCC) in the United States and 
EAN International in the rest of the world. GS1 is now the single worldwide 
origination point for UPC and EAN numbers. Table 1.17 lists the different 
types of barcodes and their typical applications.
Two-dimensional (2D) barcode symbologies contain information in 
both the X and Y axes of the symbol. In other words, there are different 
data encoded in the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the code. To 
properly decode the data, a scanner must read the entire symbol, in both 
dimensions simultaneously. This can be done by sweeping the scan line (in 
the case of a laser or linear imaging scanner) over the symbol, or by using 
a 2D-array-equipped scanner, which acts as a camera. Since the data can be 
stored in two dimensions, 2D barcode symbologies allow vast amounts of 
data to be stored.
There are two kinds of 2D barcode symbologies: stacked codes and ma­
trix codes. Stacked codes consist of multiple layers of linear barcodes and 
matrix codes encode data using cells within a matrix. Examples of stacked 
codes are shown in Table 1.18 and matrix codes in Table 1.19.

1.27  Setting up ‘Go / No Go’ decision 
criteria in logistics projects
Introduction
Confusingly, some of the most common reasons for failure in logistics 
change projects are a lack of clarity among stakeholders about what consti­
tutes success, but also a failure to agree which elements of the project are 
critical to a successful outcome, and an understanding of what must happen 
if key milestones are not achieved.
In any major project, there may be many steps where a planned comple­
tion date is built into the overall project plan, but no key performance indi­
cator (KPI) agreed for delivery of the action to be considered a success, and 
no agreement on what happens if that step is not successfully delivered in 
full and on time.
This is risky for the project team. Expectations will be high for a success­
ful implementation of the project and any delay is unwelcome and difficult 
to explain internally unless the potential for, and implications of delay are 
discussed in advance. Most importantly, in many projects, there will be clear 
steps towards ramping up operations, often connected with changes else­
where in the organization, such as transfer of suppliers to a new location, 
allocation of orders to the new location, starting a new delivery schedule.
All these changes (and many other examples depending upon the com­
plexity of the project) impact on other areas of the organization and may 
have wider implications for those areas. An unexpected delay to a previ­
ously agreed plan may be met with anger and hostility, perhaps even with 
demands to continue with the plan irrespective of the issues that may cause

for the project. The ‘Go / No Go’ decision criteria is a tool to build under­
standing and consensus when critical elements do not go according to plan.
Not every line in a project plan requires a KPI to be agreed – the focus of 
this tool is primarily based upon a few ‘operational’ steps that are most im­
portant, or even critical, to the success of the project (although some other 
key areas are also listed below, under ‘Typical examples’).
This tool helps to identify and define those few steps in the project where 
‘success’ criteria must be clearly delineated, fully understood and communi­
cated widely. Equally importantly, if success criteria are not achieved, the 
implications for the next steps in the project are also clear and agreed in 
advance.
Let us take a specific operational example: ‘January 1st 20xx = First in­
bound receipt’. Assuming there is agreement in the project team that this is 
a critical milestone (see ‘How to use’ below), what constitutes success? Is it 
the actual arrival of a vehicle at the new facility? Is it the successful unload­
ing of the cargo, or the completion of the process to check the received 
items, or the successful placing of stock into storage locations or the avail­
ability of the stock in the Warehouse Management system . . . clearly, there 
are many options.
The project team must consider which outcome is required to enable the 
project to move forward by understanding the impact of the milestone on 
the succeeding steps of the project. In our example, the target may not be 
achieved for a variety of reasons: the checking process for the received stock 
takes much longer than expected due to unfamiliarity; the storage locations 
for the received stock allocated by the system are not available; scanning of 
labels does not work; the system is not updated by the receipt process; com­
munication between the WMS and the host system does not work; and so 
on – but the critical issue is that the milestone is not achieved and this has 
already been agreed as a requirement for further investigation and a poten­
tial delay in the plan.
Therefore, for each milestone to be considered a complete ‘Go / No Go’ 
indicator, the target for the milestone must be fully defined – so success of 
‘First inbound receipt’ could be defined as the stock delivered on an inbound 
vehicle is successfully unloaded, put into storage and is available on the 
warehouse management system (WMS) within four hours of arrival.
For this example, a ‘Green’ outcome would be that the target is achieved 
as the stock received from an arriving vehicle is all available on the WMS 
within four hours of arrival.

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
110
An ‘Orange’ outcome is that the target is mostly achieved (for example, 
there is an issue with one item on a multi-item load, or the target is achieved 
after six hours rather than four) and the indications are that the issue can be 
fixed or there is an agreed ‘workaround’ for the problem (Note: ‘worka­
rounds’ are a temporary fix to an issue – a full solution must be in prepara­
tion).
On the other hand, a ‘Red’ outcome identifies that the process is not 
working – and, crucially, that the project cannot continue until a ‘fix’ for the 
problem is found and tested. In this example, a ‘Red’ outcome could be that 
none of the stock was available on the WMS within four hours of arrival 
because the scanners did not function or there was stock in locations that 
were expected to be empty.
With either an ‘Orange’ or a ‘Red’ outcome, the project team needs to 
investigate the root cause and assess next steps and a realistic time scale for 
rectification – and achievement of the ‘Green’ outcome. No further critical 
steps should be activated until this investigation is complete and key stake­
holders briefed.
When to use
The ‘Go / No Go’ tool should be used at four stages of a project:
1	 After completing the overall project plan, select key points where the 
‘Green / Orange / Red’ traffic light system can be used to define 
achievement of acceptable performance. Agree those key decision points 
at this early stage with the project Steering Committee.
2	 Before operational activities start, define ‘Green / Orange / Red’ 
performance for each of the selected decision points and reach agreement 
on the implications of a ‘red’ or ‘orange’ outcome on the next project 
steps.
3	 Shortly before each decision point is reached, review the criteria and 
revisit the implications of ‘Red’ and ‘Orange’ performance with the 
Steering Committee and key internal stakeholders.
4	 After each decision point, update the Steering Committee and key 
stakeholders with news of the outcome and the agreed next steps. For an 
‘Orange’ or ‘Red’ outcome, further communication will need to be 
planned.

How to use
1	 Select key criteria for project (the template lists some common criteria, 
but these will need to be customized for every project – see next section 
for more examples).
2	 Agree key criteria with Steering Committee and key stakeholders.
3	 Create ‘Green / Orange / Red’ performance levels for each criterion.
4	 Agree performance levels and outcomes with Steering Committee.
5	 Re-brief before each decision point is reached.
6	 Communicate the outcome of each decision point – including remediation 
activities and timescales if necessary.
Typical examples of key criteria in different parts 
of a project
●
●Building / construction (may be significant implications on overall 
timeline if building stages are not delivered on time).
●
●Approvals and permits; construction stage completions, building 
handover by developer; arrival of key materials for building fit out (e.g. 
steel for racking).
●
●Equipment (if lead times for equipment supply are not met, this may 
cause delay to overall project timeline).
●
●Arrival on site of equipment (mechanical handling, automation, robotics, 
IT hardware).
●
●Operational / functional testing of all new equipment on site.
●
●IT systems (there may be a complex ecosystem of interconnected systems 
that need to be tested in isolation but also in combination and from end 
to end):
●
●
Delivery and testing of hardware, including wireless network and 
servers.
●
●
Testing of external system connections (examples include connections 
from on-site servers with host ERP (enterprise resource planning) 
systems).
●
●
Testing of internal IT connections (such as middleware, servers, and 
warehouse execution systems (WES) for specific pieces of automation 
such as robots or shuttles.

●
●Health and safety:
●
●
Confirm that all safety processes are in place, tested and trained before 
new equipment or activity starts in any given area. Examples include 
‘Working at Height’ training, training on use of forklift trucks, use of 
lorry / container immobilization tools before loading or unloading.
●
●Human resources (having insufficient or improperly trained staff may 
cause subsequent steps to be delayed):
●
●
Recruitment plan written identifying what people are needed at each 
project stage.
●
●
Training matrix written by roles and delivered according to agreed 
timetable.
●
●
Process mapping and ‘One Point Lessons’ available for all key tasks.
●
●Operational issues and delays (the most common area for critical failures 
at a late stage in any project – require clear agreement on what constitutes 
Green, Orange and Red performance levels).
­Each physical process step from goods receipt, through put-away, to stor­
age, to stock management, to order assembly, despatch and returns manage­
ment (in the case of traditional warehouse activity), needs to be tested 
against the expected performance levels.
For example, if the operation is designed to receive orders by 17.00 for 
next day delivery (but orders are actually received by 19.00), or to assemble 
orders within an average of 5 minutes per item (but is actually taking 12 
minutes), or is expected to retrieve 15 units per forklift per hour (but is actu­
ally retrieving 7 units per hour), it is not acceptable to proceed according to 
plan if the difference between achieved and expected parameters is neither 
understood nor fixable within a short time frame.
Conclusion
A key benefit of this tool is for key stakeholders to acknowledge that, poten­
tially, not everything in a project plan will go smoothly. Many operational 
elements in a project plan cannot be tested fully before they are deployed 
and a single line in a project plan (such as ‘receive first orders into WMS’ or 
‘start storage automation’ or ‘commence inbound receipts’) hides a complex 
and not-fully tested interrelationship of systems, equipment and individuals. 
The key purpose of this tool is to enable achievement of agreed performance 
levels to drive project progress and for the implications of failure to achieve

a critical performance level to be understood and agreed by stakeholders in 
advance.
A failure to prepare for things to go wrong or to take longer than planned, 
followed by an expansion of activities according to the previously agreed 
plan, is a significant root cause of poor outcomes in logistics projects. Having 
an agreed ‘fall back’ position can provide breathing space for the project 
team to get things back on track by reducing pressure to keep to the original 
timeline.
Remember that there is no ‘list’ of the project steps to be chosen as ‘Go / 
No Go’ indicators. The list will vary from project to project. Some examples 
are given in the previous section. The focus should be on construction, pro­
curement, operational and process steps that lead to a step change in the 
activities performed at the new site.
Equally, it is vital that the ‘Go / No Go’ indicators are chosen and agreed 
with the relevant stakeholders well before the relevant activities are about to 
take place. It is critical that the ‘Red’ and ‘Orange’ outcomes are communi­
cated to, and understood by, stakeholders well in advance – when the discus­
sion is theoretical – and not in the middle of a ‘real life’ issue.

1.28  Flow charts
Introduction
Flow charting is a method of recording work or business processes, or for 
explaining how to navigate through a series of decisions. There are many 
other methods for doing this, including techniques from method study, in­
formation systems analysis and business process re-engineering, to name a 
few. However, standard flow charting can be powerful and useful for im­
proving work or business processes.

The basic flow-charting method uses symbols for operation or activity, 
decisions, the start and end points, and links to the next stage, either follow­
ing immediately or elsewhere on the chart (see Table 1.21).
When to use
Flow charts are a good means of recording a current business process or ‘as-
is’ situation that you want to analyse and streamline. When the new process 
is designed, the ‘to-be’ process, it can also be communicated as a flow chart. 
A flow chart can therefore be used as a communication tool for discussion 
leading to redesign, or for presenting or formalizing a work procedure.
How to use
The most common method of creating a flow chart of a business process is 
for the person creating the chart to interview the person carrying out the 
business process. The interviewer makes notes or may sketch the activities as 
they are described. Later, the interviewer constructs the flow chart. Actually 
drawing out the flow chart can give rise to questions about the logic of the 
procedure or the sequence of activities, and it is often necessary to go back 
to the person carrying out the process to check the details. The process of 
constructing the final flow chart often offers ideas for improvement. The

process chart can be shown to all involved and used as the basis for a discus­
sion about potential improvements. Eventually, a ‘to-be’ process can be de­
veloped, tested and implemented. The flow chart thus becomes the reference 
document of ‘what should happen’ and for future checking of ‘conformance 
to process’.
Example

1.29  The PDCA tool
Introduction
The PDCA tool (Plan, Do, Check, Act) or Deming Cycle, named after W 
Edwards Deming, a business improvement and quality guru, is an approach 
to change and problem solving. The four phases in the cycle involve:
Plan: identifying and analysing the problem.
Do: producing and trying a potential solution.
Check: measuring how successful the test solution is and analysing whether 
it can be improved in any way.
Act: implementing the improved solution fully.
When to use
The Deming Cycle or PDCA is an excellent, well-ordered, precise method 
for problem solving. It can be utilized in a number of areas such as:
●
●assisting in the implementation of Kaizen or continuous improvement 
practices, enabling the cycle to be repeated over and over as new areas for 
improvement are discovered and resolved;
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

Warehouse management tools and guides
119
●
●pinpointing new resolutions and improvements to processes and practices 
that are repetitive;
●
●investigating a range of possible new solutions to problems, evaluating 
and improving them before selecting the most appropriate for full 
implementation;
●
●avoiding the waste of resources that accompanies full-scale implementation 
of an average or deficient solution.
PDCA is a proven method for removing waste or inefficient cost in an op­
eration, resulting in increased value. In our example below, Nissan Motor 
Parts (NMPC) uses PDCA as part of its continuous improvement process. It 
is in a competitive environment and needs to have high performance levels.
Nissan uses PDCA when examining larger change events that require 
more time and perhaps investment but are critical for the business 
­performance. These are not in the gift of any one team, so require senior 
managers’ support through active participation. They rely on data for objec­
tive root-cause analysis and for testing possible solutions before implemen­
tation. Projects tend to be more data intensive.
According to Nissan, the use of PDCA supports the development of lead­
ers and team members by providing a place for people to work together and 
grow their skills for continuous improvement. It not only increases confi­
dence in individuals but also develops a good spirit in the workplace. It be­
comes a place to apply individual expertise and a place to learn about the 
expertise of others by working cross-functionally in the supply chain.
Nissan uses it as a training opportunity and it becomes a place of owner­
ship, i.e. when a group of people make a change for the better in their part 
of the business, they will implement the change and follow the standard 
operating procedure, which is the written record of the changed procedure.
A mutual respect grows among colleagues: ‘If your colleague made the 
change you support that change when you are deployed in that task because 
you need your colleague to reciprocate.’
How to use it
The following is a case study example from Nissan Motor Parts UK. 
Figure 1.18 shows the model that Nissan uses.
Project title: Physical Picking Claims Improvement Project

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit

Problem: NMPC receives dealer orders and then processes them in a manual 
picking process. When carrying out this task there is the risk of a team 
member in the supply process making a physical error resulting in a 
dealer claim and loss of value for the part. This is at a cost of £563,869 
per year.
Target: A reduction of physical errors by 10 per cent equating to a reduction 
in claims value of £56,386 in total. This is equal to 1,007 physical error 
claims.
Approach: Use of PDCA and DMAIC (see tool 6.8).
Step 1. Plan (Define, Measure, Analyse)
Define the opportunity and set up a project team.
Undertake a stakeholder analysis (see Table 1.22).
Produce a communication plan (see Table 1.23).

The stakeholder analysis and the communication plan together form the 
engagement plan.
The group discussed the best methods to engage the stakeholders effec­
tively and maintained this approach throughout the project. It was decided 
that the critical group of ‘pickers’ would be communicated to via a ‘road-
show’ type of presentation. The use of the same presenting team and the 
opportunity to ask questions provide consistency and transparency.
This technique was employed from start to finish for both this project 
and the sub-projects that came from it:
●
●Produce process maps to assess the current situation.
●
●Measure and validate the data for the current situation.
●
●Determine the influencing factors of below-par performance and chart 
them (see Figure 1.19).
At the next stage, which is the Analysis stage in DMAIC, the team looked to 
identify the root cause or causes of the problem or opportunity. Using the 
data produced, the problem is analysed and ‘drilled down’ to gain a better 
understanding of what and where the root causes are.
Step 2. Do (Improve)
A ‘quick win’ was identified that saw Nissan provide its pickers with the 
opportunity of a free eye test. Out of 77 who took the test, 33 required 
glasses. A number of people were not aware they needed them. Everyone 
was given the option to have free glasses up to a cost of £50 and everyone 
was able to choose from a variety of styles.
Other solutions were identified, scored and ranked by effectiveness, fea­
sibility, cost and duration. The top five ideas were evaluated and a risk anal­
ysis carried out. The ideas were later either implemented or a separate pro­
ject team was set up to look at return on investment and feasibility.
Step 3. Check
The group identified a loophole in the way that the existing claims tracker 
calculated overall claims scores for operatives. The existing tracker allowed 
operatives to score points towards merit-based pay reviews even when they 
were performing poorly in key areas. This was due to the way that the 
tracker took a percentage of the overall score for each area and enabled one 
good performance to guarantee a minimum score.

A new tracker with a new calculation was developed to remove this loop­
hole and enable like-for-like comparison between operatives. This ensures 
that the operatives who need the most assistance get the most coaching and 
in good time.
Step 4. Act (Control)
Many of the new processes have been introduced and others are currently 
being fully evaluated in terms of feasibility and cost, with the project teams 
due to report back on the results.
Result
The 10 per cent reduction was equivalent to a drop of 1,007 claims over the 
year. Nissan achieved a reduction of 582 claims in four months. If this is 
maintained it is forecasting an annual saving of 1,746 physical error claims. 
This equates to a 23 per cent reduction in physical errors.
At an average of £55.97 a claim, it has so far saved £32,574 in four 
months. If this continues, the projected saving over a 12-month period will 
be £97,723. Implementation resource costs were approximately circa 300 
hours at £15.15 per hour = £4,650 = net saving in first year of £93,073.
The introduction of tools such as PDCA and DMAIC has resulted in staff 
working together in teams to ensure continuous improvement and in many 
instances exceed the targets initially set.

2.1  Transport audit checklists
This section provides audit checklists for a road freight transport operation; 
an extract is shown in Table 2.1. The questions are not exhaustive and can 
be added to by users to mirror their own operations.
Audits should be undertaken by an independent person, either an out­
side consultant or someone from another department within the company. 
The purpose of the audit should be explained to the staff. Results should 
be shared with all staff, who should take ownership of the results and the 
improvements necessary. A timescale should be agreed to undertake the 
improvements.

2.2  Calculating emissions in freight 
transport
Introduction
Companies worldwide are being encouraged to lessen their impact on the 
environment and many governments are likely to introduce taxation based 
on greenhouse gas emissions so as to meet their own targets. This section 
provides information on how to measure these emissions in a freight trans­
port environment.
Another reason for transport operators to calculate their emissions is to 
provide information to their customers. For most transport operators, this 
will mean calculating their total emissions, and then using an appropriate 
method to fairly ‘allocate’ an appropriate share of those emissions to each 
of their customers.
Greenhouse gases (GHGs) can be measured by recording emissions at 
source by continuous emissions monitoring or by estimating the amount

emitted by multiplying activity data by relevant emissions conversion 
­factors. These conversion factors allow activity data (e.g. litres of fuel used, 
number of miles/kilometres driven, tonnes of freight carried, tonnes of waste 
sent to landfill) to be converted into kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent 
(CO2e). CO2e is a universal unit of measurement that allows the global 
warming potential of different GHGs to be compared. There are seven main 
GHGs that contribute to climate change, as covered by the Kyoto Protocol: 
carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluoro­
carbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and 
nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). Different activities emit different gases and com­
panies need to report on the Kyoto Protocol GHG gases produced by their 
particular activities.
Values for methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are presented as 
carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) using global warming potential (GWP) 
factors, consistent with reporting under the Kyoto Protocol and the sec­
ond assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC).
This tool provides calculations for each mode of freight transport.
How to use it
The following examples illustrate how to calculate kgCO2e for diesel with 
an average biofuel blend:
Total fuel used by company road freight vehicles per annum = 150,000 litres
UK emission factor for diesel is 2.51 kgCO2e/litre
Therefore total kgCO2e = 376,500 kgCO2e.
If the company does not have details of fuel consumed it is possible to use 
the following formula based on DEFRA emission factors.
This is based on an average for all HGVs between 3.5 tonnes and 44 
tonnes gross vehicle weight:
Total emissions = distance × emission factor
= 377,015 × 0.64258
= 242,262 kgCO2e
Table 2.2 provides the calculation for the different gases based on distance 
travelled in miles and kilometres and by tonne kilometre. It is based on aver­
age loaded vehicles.

The website shown at the end of this tool provides spreadsheets to enable 
the user to calculate these figures automatically. For those working in miles 
as opposed to kilometres the following formula provided by the UK Road 
Haulage Association (RHA) can suffice. The calculation is as follows:
To convert miles per gallon to kilometres per litre, multiply by 0.354.
To obtain litres per kilometre, divide 1 by the kilometre/litre figure above.
To convert miles per US gallon to kilometres per litre multiply by 0.425144.
To obtain CO2 in kilograms per kilometre, multiply by 2.51.
To obtain CO2 in grams per kilometre (the accepted measure), multiply by 
1,000.
Example: carbon footprint calculation:
Assume a 44-tonne articulated vehicle returning 8 miles per gallon:
8.0 multiplied by 0.354 gives 2.832 kilometres/litre;
1 divided by 2.832 gives 0.3531 litres/kilometre;
0.3531 multiplied by 2.51 gives 0.886281 kilograms of CO2/kilometre;
That figure multiplied by 1,000 gives 886.281 g of CO2/kilometre.
Other modes
Freight flights
Short haul to/from UK = 1.668155 kgCO2e per tonne kilometre
Long haul to/from UK = 1.099032 kgCO2e per tonne kilometre
Railfreight
Railfreight (UK) = 0.02779 kgCO2e per tonne kilometre
­Sea freight
Crude tanker (≥ 200,000 + dwt) = 0.00294 kgCO2e per tonne kilometre
Container ship (≥ 8,000 + TEU) = 0.01266 kgCO2e per tonne kilometre
Bulk carrier (≥ 200,000 + dwt) = 0.00253

2.3  Fuel adjustment factor formula
Introduction
Fluctuations in the price of fuel have a significant impact on the rates paid 
for the transportation of goods. To enable companies to pass on the increase 
(or decrease) in the cost of fuel to their customers, a mathematical formula 
can be used to calculate the percentage increase/decrease. Not only does the 
transport supplier need to understand the mechanism but so does the cus­
tomer in terms of how it has been calculated.
Over recent years the cost of fuel as a percentage of total transport costs 
for UK hauliers has been in the region of 30 per cent. The 2022 RHA cost 
tables show a figure of 28.95 per cent.
How to use
At the beginning of the contract a base price for the fuel needs to be agreed 
between both parties. This needs to be written into the contract. The con­
tract should also state the review frequency. If the haulier is undertaking a 
large number of jobs for the customer and the price of fuel is continually 
rising or falling, then maybe a weekly adjustment is required. Other con­
tracts can be set up on a quarterly or six-monthly basis.
A further calculation is the cost of fuel as a percentage of the total cost or 
revenue for the transport company at the time of the fuel increase. Any fuel 
taxation such as value added tax needs to be excluded from the price of fuel.
Once these figures have been calculated, the formula shown in the exam­
ple below can be used to calculate the overall increase/decrease in price for 
the work undertaken. The figure is illustrative only. Figure 2.1 covers a situ­
ation where fuel has increased in price. Note there will be situations where 
fuel has gone down in price and the haulier will need to adjust the cost ac­
cordingly.
In terms of container shipping there is a fuel adjustment factor called 
BAF or bunker adjustment factor.

The BAF tariff is designed to recover fuel-related costs and it is charged 
separately from basic ocean freight as the fuel cost is a very significant and 
volatile part of shipping costs. The BAF consists of a trade factor and the 
fuel price.
The fuel price is calculated as the average fuel price in key bunkering 
ports around the world, while the trade factor reflects the average fuel con­
sumption on a given trade route as a result of variables such as transit time, 
fuel efficiency and trade imbalance. Currently there is no standardization 
across the shipping companies.
Depending on volumes shipped, BAF can be fixed, locked in or floating 
(variable).
2.4  How to improve fuel efficiency
Introduction
Fuel represents approximately 28.95 per cent of transport costs within a 
distribution operation in the UK today, based on September 2022 fuel prices. 
It is therefore vital that companies look to reduce the amount of fuel con­
sumed and improve metrics such as miles per gallon or kilometres per 100 
litres.
The following is a list produced by Goodyear Dunlop on how to improve 
fuel efficiency. It has been supplemented by further advice from Freight Best 
Practice.
Driver training
Driver behaviour is the biggest factor affecting fuel consumption. Investing 
in driver training will therefore quickly pay off and cut costs.
Work with equipment manufacturers
A key aspect of driver training will often be working with the vehicle manu­
facturers, which can offer advice on how to get the most from their vehicles. 
This relationship should be extended across all equipment manufacturers. 
Tyre, trailer and aerodynamics suppliers can advise you on how best to use 
their equipment and provide ongoing maintenance to ensure fuel consump­
tion stays as low as possible.

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
134
Make fuel efficiency a key consideration for vehicle 
procurement
Truck manufacturers are increasingly offering vehicles with improved fuel 
efficiency. The upfront cost of investing in these vehicles will be more than 
outweighed by the future savings from reduced fuel consumption.
Invest in cost-effective tyres
The cheapest tyres are not always the most cost-effective. Tyres should be 
selected on the basis of what offers best value – this means selecting a tyre 
that offers optimal safety, longevity and fuel efficiency, even if it may be 
more expensive upfront. Tyre pressure monitoring systems (TPMS) can also 
help maximize the cost-effectiveness of tyres in the long term.
Aerodynamic improvement
Investing in aerodynamic improvements to vehicles can pay big dividends. 
Aerodynamic drag is a major factor in fuel consumption and retro-fitted 
improvements such as side skirts can offer a quick return on investment 
(ROI).
Perform regular and thorough maintenance
There is little point in spending money on fuel-efficient trucks, tyres and 
aerodynamic improvements if this equipment is not well maintained. It is 
necessary to keep all of this equipment in good condition if it is to deliver 
the desired savings in fuel consumption.
Improve your logistics
Better route planning and journey organization can cut journey times, avoid 
congestion and reduce empty running, saving fuel.
Work with your customers
Customers are increasingly asking for more environmentally friendly freight 
services. Cooperating with them can help reduce fuel consumption by mak­
ing deliveries easier and journeys shorter. Customers can be encouraged to 
place depots out of urban centres to avoid congestion, to reorganize deliver­
ies to reduce empty running and to organize distribution to ensure trucks 
run full rather than half loads, improving fuel efficiency.

Transport management tools
135
Use telematics to track fuel consumption
Using telematics software can allow fleets to track their fuel consumption. It 
can be used to identify drivers who are wasting fuel and routes plagued by 
congestion, allowing fleets to act on these issues.
All of the above
Improving fuel efficiency requires a holistic approach – improving in only 
one area is not enough and the investment may not be recouped if other 
areas are neglected. Fleets need to identify a reduction target, devise a fuel 
management plan that covers all areas and then measure how successful it 
is. This kind of thorough plan may be more expensive, but it will also save 
much more money in the long run.
Best-practice advice to drivers
1	 Always drive the truck with as low an engine speed as is practicable. This 
means using as high a gear as possible and monitoring the speedometer 
to ensure that the needle is always in the green band. Remember, the 
higher the gear, the lower the engine revs.
2	 Make full use of the engine exhaust brake or engine brake, if fitted.
3	 Avoid double-declutching on a synchromesh gearbox.
4	 Do not use every single gear in the gearbox when shifting up or down. 
Make use of block changing/forward shift techniques where it is safe to 
do so, for example: 2–4–6–8. Where a splitter gearbox is fitted, use this 
facility to your best advantage. Again, do not use it automatically on each 
gear, but rather in the top range only as a 1/2 gear step. It helps to keep 
optimum speed up and engine revs down.
5	 ­Safety checks and prompt defect reporting should be carried out before, 
during and at the end of every shift.
6	 Let the engine work for you and ‘lug’ (i.e. work within the green band) 
on gradients. Remember, use maximum engine torque and thus pulling 
power. Use the engine’s ‘sweet spot’.
7	 Make sure tyre pressures are correct. Incorrect pressure accelerates tyre 
wear, may jeopardize safety and affects fuel consumption. Fill tyres with 
nitrogen as opposed to air.
8	 Use cruise control, whenever safe and practicable.
9	 When filling fuel tanks, take care not to fill to the brim. Never leave a fuel 
nozzle unattended.

2.5  Incoterms® 2020
Introduction
Incoterms® are a set of uniform rules produced by the International 
Chambers of Commerce for the interpretation of international commercial 
terms. They define and set out the obligations of both consignors and con­
signees of goods in relation to the risks and costs that relate to each party 
during the movement of the goods between the seller’s premises and those of 
the buyer.
Incoterms® are internationally accepted definitions and rules of interpre­
tation for most common commercial terms. Incoterms® rules are recognized 
by UNCITRAL as the global standard for the interpretation of the most 
common terms in foreign trade.
A major consideration when selecting the correct Incoterms® rule is that 
sellers and buyers should not use a term that imposes risks and obligations

beyond their control. One point to note here is that under an ex-works 
agreement it is the responsibility of the buyer to load the vehicle, yet in the 
majority of cases it is the seller’s staff who tend to load the vehicle on depar­
ture. The question is: ‘Who is responsible if the goods are damaged while 
being loaded?’
Technically the seller should make the goods available but not load the 
goods on collecting vehicles and the seller is not responsible for clearing 
them for export. If the seller does load the goods, it does so at the buyer’s 
risk and cost. If the parties want the seller to be responsible for the loading 
of the goods on departure and to bear the costs and risk of such loading, this 
must be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract 
of sale and any other specific documentation.
It is imperative that precise delivery points are identified, especially 
with regard to port or terminal areas. The typical functions and responsi­
bilities identified by Incoterms® 2020 are listed below. It notes who is re­
sponsible for:
●
●packing and marking of the goods (packing in cases, etc for contract and 
mode of transport – not loading items in, or on containers);
●
●providing and paying for the goods;
●
●preparing documentation, whether in hard copy or electronically;
●
●arranging dispatch of the goods to specific delivery points;
●
●sorting out (and paying for) export and import clearances;
●
●ensuring import and export licensing is in order;
●
●­ensuring security requirements are met;
●
●loading and unloading of cargo at the agreed delivery points;
●
●pre-shipment inspection (always the buyer for UK exports);
●
●obtaining documents or their equivalent electronic messages (online 
documentary considerations);
●
●insuring the goods – this is for additional cargo insurance, not carriers’ 
liability insurance;
●
●paying duties and taxes, usually at the point of import.
According to 512 Sheffield, a UK-based freight forwarder, the way to avoid 
problems is to do the following:
●
●ALWAYS quote the specific three-letter abbreviation.
●
●ALWAYS mention a PRECISE place of delivery.
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
138
●
●ALWAYS add the phrase ‘as per Incoterms® 2020’ – in the contract, the 
quotation, order, order confirmation – and on the invoice.
●
●ALWAYS ensure that all parties understand that they are working to the 
terms qualified in Incoterms® 2020 and not a perception of what they 
think a term means.
●
●ALWAYS ensure that any contractual issues that may cause deviation 
from Incoterms® 2020 are clarified and resolved before the contract is 
agreed and signed.
The following is a list of the 11 Incoterms® used.
When transporting goods by any mode of transport, be it air, sea, inland 
waterways, rail or road:
EXW – Ex Works – (named place of delivery)
FCA – Free Carrier – (named place of delivery)
CPT – Carriage Paid To – (named place of destination)
CIP – Carriage and Insurance Paid to (named place of destination)
DPU – Delivered at Place Unloaded (insert place of destination)
DAP – Delivered at Place – (named place of destination)
DDP – Delivered Duty Paid – (named place of destination)
When transporting by sea and inland waterways only:
­FAS – Free Alongside Ship (named port of loading/shipment)
FOB – Free on Board (named port of loading/shipment)
CFR – Cost and Freight (named port of destination)
CIF – Cost, Insurance and Freight (named port of destination)
As can be seen from Table  2.3, the majority of terms specifically show 
whether it is the buyer or supplier who is responsible for the cost and risk 
involved. However, there are situations where risk and cost will be deter­
mined by the named place of destination; these are denoted by B/S on the 
chart. Table 2.3 details the responsible party based on the Incoterms® agreed.

2.6  Load and pallet configuration
Introduction
The efficient loading of containers and trailers is crucial in today’s environ­
ment of rising transport costs. Unused space is inefficient and can cost a 
company a great deal of money.
Efficient loading of vehicles and containers begins with the initial packag­
ing of the products. Companies need to ensure that the outer packaging of 
their products is designed to fit perfectly onto the pallets used for both trans­
portation and storage. The ideal is to ensure no overhang whatsoever, with 
a reduction in unused space.
Pallet loads need to be configured to ensure that product damage is min­
imized, cubic capacity is fully utilized, load stability is ensured and the 
­configuration is acceptable to the receiving location. Fortunately, there is 
software available to assist not only with pallet loading but also container 
and trailer loading. The software can also optimize packing within an indi­
vidual carton.
The pallet configuration software works on the basis of TiHi (tier × high), 
which determines how many cartons should be placed on a layer or tier, in 
which configuration and how many layers in total (see Figure 2.2).
In the figure on the left there are 12 cartons per layer and four layers, 
giving a carton total of 48. Utilizing pallet configuration software, Able 
Plastics was able to increase the number of cartons to 52 by changing the 
layout of the cartons. This can lead to significant savings in transport costs.
Many retailers insist on products being delivered in a certain way so that 
they conform to their storage mediums. For example, a retailer could ask for 
the goods delivered to its distribution centre (DC) to conform to the list 
shown in Table 2.4. The same can be achieved in terms of efficient container 
and trailer loading.
Sophisticated software optimization can not only take into account the 
cube of the products but also their weight, load-bearing strength and loca­
tion within the container. This ensures ease of offloading at the receiver, with

all the cartons from the same product line being located together. The soft­
ware also ensures that lighter items are packed on top of the heavier ones.
Many websites provide software to enable operators to calculate the 
most efficient way of loading containers and trailers, and also configuring 
boxes on different pallet sizes and items within cartons.

2.7  ISO containers, weight volume 
ratios and pallets
Introduction
ISO containers enable companies to ship product via a number of different 
transport modes, including deep sea, short sea, inland waterways, road and 
rail. There are several basic types of ISO containers, including flat racks, 
open-top, dry freight, insulated, refrigerated and tank containers.
ISO 6346 requires a visual identification system for every container, in­
cluding a unique 11-character serial code used for container tracking that 
defines the owner (three letters), container category (one letter), a unique 
owner identifier (six numbers) and a check digit (one number), e.g. MSCU 
123456 7. There are four possible category identifiers:
●
●U for all freight containers;
●
●J for detachable freight container-related equipment;
Type of pallet
Chep/White/Red
Pallet exchange
Yes/No
Special instructions
Product label on all four corners
Ability to block stack
Yes/No
If yes, how high

●
●Z for trailers and chassis;
●
●R for refrigerated containers.
A further four characters denote the size and type of container:
●
●character 1 denotes the length;
●
●character 2 denotes the width and height;
●
●characters 3 and 4 denote the type.
­Table 2.5 provides data regarding the dimensions and capacities of ISO con­
tainers in use worldwide. The dimensions will vary between different ship­
ping companies and therefore it is wise to check with them or your freight 
forwarder before ordering a particular container for collection.
Other points to note are as follows:
●
●The floor of a container should be able to carry a forklift truck with a 
maximum axle load of 5,460 kg providing that the contact area per 
wheel is at least 142 cm2.
●
●The figures quoted are based on ISO 668 and ISO 1496-1, which provide 
the standard dimensions for ISO containers. Some 10 ft and 30 ft 
containers remain in use and in the United States containers can also be 
operated at 48 ft and 53 ft lengths.
●
●Container capacity tends to be expressed in 20-foot equivalent units 
(TEU). An equivalent unit is a measure of containerized cargo capacity 
equal to one standard 20-foot (length) × 8-foot (width) container.

Effective 1 July 2016, any container leaving from any port in the world must 
be accompanied by a shipping document signed either electronically or in 
hard copy by the shipper on the bill of lading listing the verified gross mass 
of a container in order to be loaded onto a ship. The mandate from the 
International Maritime Organization under the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) 
convention comes after mis-declared weights contributed to a number of 
maritime casualties.
Weight/volume ratios
In terms of freight costs shipped by different modes of transport, there are 
conventions that need to be understood. One of the main conventions is the 
weight to volume ratio.
The following provides a guide to charging for air, sea and road freight. 
Weight versus volume charges are based on weight but calculations switch 
to volume over a certain threshold:
6 m3 / 1000 kg = Air freight
1 m3 / 1000 kg = Sea freight
3 m3 / 1000 kg = Road Trailer freight
Pallets
The use of pallets or skids to move and store product is familiar the world 
over. The only problem is that there is very little uniformity in terms of the 
sizes and types of pallets. Table 2.6 is a guide to the sizes of pallets used in 
different countries. Other specialist pallet sizes for the storage and move­
ment of paper, drums, etc also exist.

2.8  Calculating road freight transport 
charges and rates
Introduction
As a haulier or trucker, one of the most difficult aspects of running a busi­
ness, alongside keeping costs as low as possible and attracting clients, is 
calculating charges for freight deliveries. To do this accurately you need to 
understand the total costs within your business, both fixed and variable.
For each particular delivery or collection, you need to fully assess both 
the time required to complete a job and the number of miles/km covered. 
You must then apply to the time element the cost per day, including over­
heads, add any specific bonuses, extra hours, subsistence and sundries (tolls) 
and miles/km at the appropriate cost.
This will give you a fair cost for the job for which you are quoting. To this 
you must add a percentage for profit. In today’s market this is extremely 
difficult because, on many occasions, you will find the costs as properly de­
termined from the cost categories below are greater than the revenue likely 
to be derived from the rates being charged by your competitors.
Notwithstanding this, you must aim for a reasonable profit margin. In 
the case of fuel you should always attempt to negotiate a clause into all rate 
schedules and contracts allowing fuel price increases to be passed on to the 
customer as they occur (see tool 2.3).
You must then decide whether you can accept a job at less than the rate 
calculated and, even more crucially, whether you can accept it at less than 
the true cost of undertaking it. In anything but the shortest run you cannot 
afford to do the latter, except perhaps for casual or special jobs that fit into 
the pattern of your overall work.
How to use
The following template (Table 2.8) allows you to calculate the costs in­
volved and the rates required. Example costs for a 44-tonne gross (6 × 2 + 
tri-axle trailer) combination are shown in Table 2.7. Note that bonuses, ex­
cess hours, subsistence and similar are not included. These should be added 
to costs as they are incurred, by job (Table 2.8).
NB The chargeable rate = time cost + mileage cost + job-specific cost + 
profit.

Rates and charges – example
You are asked to give a quotation for loading a 26-pallet load weighing 24 
tonnes at a shipper’s factory, delivering to a nominated address and return­
ing to base with a full load of empty pallets. You are using a 44-tonne gross 
vehicle weight (gvw) articulated unit and tri-axle trailer.
You decide from your experience that this task will occupy two full work­
ing days, and you ascertain that the total distance to be covered will be 480 
miles. Referring to the cost tables below, you derive the standard costs and 
estimate other items as shown in Table 2.9. Substitute your own figures for 
those shown.
NOTES:
(a) You will often find that a job will be completed with some hours in the day ‘left over’. These hours 
will be costing you. You will need to decide whether you can use them for something else. If not, can 
those hours be charged to the job without making you uncompetitive?
(b) Where a return load is involved, it is important that you cost the whole round trip, allowing for the 
revenue you are likely to earn for the return and deciding how much to allow against the outward job 
for which you are quoting.
(c) When you are allocating costs in lines 7, 8, 15, 16, don’t forget when using the appropriate figures 
from Table 2.7, if possible, to substitute YOUR costs where they are different.
(d) Rate = time cost + mileage cost + job cost + profit.

If possible, and before submitting this quotation, try to determine what the 
‘going rate’ or market rate for these movements is. Decide whether, or to 
what extent, the gap between approximately £1,650 and the market rate 
can be bridged. Negotiate as strongly as possible to ‘educate’ the customer 
about realistic figures.

2.9  Transport management system (TMS) 
selection process
Introduction
Many companies continue to utilize whiteboards and spreadsheets and rely 
on transport planner experience to manage the routing and allocation of 
their vehicle fleets. This is fine, but there are systems on the market that can 
optimize transport movements and introduce greater efficiency. This can 
lead to an improvement in vehicle utilization and a reduction in total cost.
If you are operating your own vehicles there are two routes to imple­
menting a TMS – license the TMS from a software provider and manage the 
software in-house or get the TMS provider to host the system for you. Own-
account operators and third-party logistics companies will have different

requirements. The model from Capgemini (see ‘References and further read­
ing’) outlines the potential features of a TMS.
When to use
When you are looking to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of 
your transport fleet through introducing a TMS.
How to use
First, you have to fully understand your needs and the key business require­
ments, not only today but some time into the future so that you select the 
solution that best matches your business objectives. You also need to calcu­
late the ROI on the purchase and ongoing support of the TMS (see tool 7.2).
The choice of a TMS roughly follows the same lines as that of any soft­
ware acquisition and implementation. To ensure that the system you choose 
is the right one for your operation, here are some best-practice guidelines 
courtesy of BASDA and Sage:
1	 Ensure full commitment from the board of directors and the IT 
department.
2	 Form a project team:
–– Assemble a team of people capable of logical thinking who will decide 
what your company needs from a TMS, what functionalities it must 
have and those it will be nice to have. Members of the team should 
include a member from finance, sales, operations/production (if 
applicable), IT and of course the transport department.
–– Ensure the availability of all key staff throughout the project.
3	 Define, record, review and improve current processes:
–– Ensure that your processes are working properly before introducing a 
TMS. Do not make the error of automating poor processes.
–– Understand how the transport department communicates both 
internally with other departments and externally with customers and 
suppliers.
4	 Create a list of key functions required of the new system:
–– Each project team member needs to compile a list of the key functions 
required of a system and rank them by importance, for example 1, 2 
or 3, or essential, greatly desired or nice to have.
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

Transport management tools
153
–– There are a number of templates that can be downloaded from the 
internet to help you. A website for these can be found at the end of 
this section.
5	 Produce a current base cost for the operation.
6	 Incorporate any future growth plans in your specification:
–– Although difficult to forecast, you need to take into account likely 
future events when specifying a TMS.
7	 List the benefits of a TMS to your company:
–– The right TMS can maximize the efficiency of your fleet, the 
productivity of your labour and aid with network design. All of these 
need to be quantified and presented alongside the ROI report.
8	 Research and approach a select number of vendors and produce a list of 
companies with experience of providing solutions in your market sector.
9	 ­Visit reference sites to look at operational effectiveness and discuss the 
benefits the TMS has brought about since implementation:
–– This is very important. Try to visit a cross-section of companies and 
speak to the operators, not just the managers who chose the software 
in the first place.
10	 Produce a ROI report:
–– This is vital if you want to convince the board to spend some money 
(see tool 8.3).
This is not the type of purchase you make through an e-auction. As with 
many large service offerings such as outsourcing, the likely success of the 
project will ultimately come down to your relationship with the people at 
the software vendor. As a previous manager of mine told me, ‘people buy 
people’, therefore it is very important to meet the vendors, not only the sales 
staff but also the operations and support staff.
The main aspects to look for in a partner include the following:
●
●Look for providers that employ staff with significant operational experi­
ence as well as staff with the ability to produce a best-in-class TMS.
●
●Not only will the operational staff have had input into the TMS but they 
will also be able to understand your own requirements better. Choose a 
vendor that listens effectively and understands your organization fully.
●
●Check how long the company has been in business and what its credit­
worthiness is like – it will certainly check yours!

154
●
●Choose a vendor that emphasizes the benefits of the software, not just the 
features.
●
●Choose a provider that has already installed TMS with clients in your 
industry.
●
●Ensure that the vendor can supply not only the system but also the 
installation, training, maintenance and help desk service.
●
●Verify that your prospective TMS provider is reinvesting significant 
capital into research and development, and future product enhancements.
●
●Choose a vendor you are comfortable working with. Try to find a vendor 
that is culturally similar to yourselves, is professional and well respected 
in the industry.
●
●Ask for a large list of customers and visit the customer sites of your 
choice.
●
●Choose a partner that has reasonable modification rates and is willing to 
set up a realistic budget, based on your needs assessment, prior to 
formalizing the relationship. Alternatively, look to set up an agreement 
where your own IT staff are able to introduce certain modifications.
●
●Make sure that the TMS provider can fully support you during the imple­
mentation phase.
●
●Select a partner that has an adequately staffed help desk and that the help 
desk is available during your company’s hours of operation. Time zones 
can cause innumerable problems if they are not taken into account at the 
outset.
●
●Select a partner that has established partnerships with hardware providers.
●
●A final decision is whether to purchase the software and hardware out­
right or to rent the software and operate it on a third-party server plat­
form (see tool 1.18 on selecting a WMS).

2.10  Vendor assurance of transport 
logistics service providers
Introduction
When outsourcing logistics and supply chain services, it is vital that compa­
nies understand the risk profile of the suppliers they are using if they are to 
protect their brand and reputation as well as their service levels. A company 
outsourcing its logistics may congratulate itself that it is no longer responsi­
ble for the headache of safety and compliance management; however, if 
there is a serious accident or breach of health and safety legislation, public­
ity will normally focus more on any connection with a branded goods man­
ufacturer or retailer than on the typically less well-known logistics service 
provider. Similarly, any interruption in service associated with the loss of a 
facility, bankruptcy or loss of key personnel will have a dramatic and serious 
impact on the outsourcing company, particularly when the service includes 
warehousing or e-commerce activities.
When to use
Outsourcing companies need to include an audit of vendor risk profiles. 
Ideally this is done during the tender process and repeated at appropriate 
intervals throughout the life of the contract. The frequency and depth of 
such audits will depend on the criticality of the service being outsourced.
Where more than one company is audited, or a company is audited more 
than once over a period of time, it is best to use a standard list of questions 
that reflect the risks that are relevant for that contract, with standardized 
scoring for the responses. Scores may then be compared to see relative risk 
and to assess progress over time. However, the main value of the audit tool 
is to identify and track actions to reduce or mitigate risk.

How to use
The questions shown in Table 2.10 should be asked and the answers re­
corded and analysed.
Table 2.10  Vendor assurance questionnaire
Area
Typical questions
Health and safety Is the supplier aware of their general safety responsibilities 
in line with current legislation?
What is the supplier’s approach to the safety of operations 
and transport on site?
What processes does the supplier have in place?
Compliance (with 
legal operating 
requirements)
Can the supplier demonstrate compliance with Operator 
Licence legislation?
Financial
What is the credit rating of the supplier?
Have the supplier’s latest published accounts been 
examined by a financial expert?
Performance
Does the supplier issue a regular performance report to the 
client and to other clients?
Contractual
Is there a record of the agreement between the client and 
the supplier?
Who has the controlling interest in the supplier and how 
does this affect the contract (are there parent company 
guarantees in place)?
Dependency
Is the supplier performance dependent upon one or two key 
individuals?
How dependent is the supplier upon their largest other 
customer? Could loss of this contract threaten the supplier’s 
viability?
Systems
Does the supplier measure and report on their systems 
performance, and what is the performance?
What steps has the supplier taken to protect against 
systems failure? Is there a disaster recovery plan in place?
How widely used is the main software package?
Food safety or 
dangerous goods
Is the supplier meeting the specific safety or quality 
requirements related to the products carried for this contract?

157
Who should audit?
Auditors should have an operational logistics background and have been 
trained in national health and safety and professional competency standards 
for road transport and logistics operations. They should also have received 
training in quality auditing skills and techniques.
Where is the audit carried out?
Typically, an audit will be carried out at the premises where the contract is 
operated from or at a similar site for such services. Health and safety, train­
ing and monitoring records should be available to the auditor on request.
Output and follow-up
At the end of the visit the supplier is given a score out of 10 for each area 
(see Figure 2.3 for an example of a graphical representation of the results), 
with any significant risks being highlighted. A report is written for each 
audit, with details of all the areas audited and suggested actions to improve 
performance. The outsourcing company should then put in place checks to 
ensure that the actions are carried out by the next audit at the latest, prefer­
ably earlier, depending on the risk attached to non-compliance.

2.11  Transportation of hazardous products
In terms of the movement of hazardous goods the carrier’s duties are far less 
complicated than the consignor’s duties in that there is far less need for in­
terpretation. The following is expected of the carrier:
●
●The carrier must decide, from the information provided by the consignor’s 
dangerous goods note, as to whether it has a dangerous goods load under 
the carriage of dangerous goods by road regulations.
●
●The carrier’s obligations have thresholds at which the regulations become 
relevant and these thresholds are based on the packing group of the goods 
to be carried.
●
●The carrier must appoint a DGSA (dangerous goods safety adviser).
●
●The carrier must ensure the vehicle is roadworthy and not overloaded.
●
●Drivers must hold vocational training certificates and be trained in 
emergency action procedures.
●
●Drivers must carry a photographic identification card.
●
●Drivers must not carry matches or lighters, or smoke in close vicinity of 
the load.
Additional requirements include the completion of a security plan that all 
participants are made aware of. Note that different regulations apply to the 
different modes of transport utilized. Note also that there are certain haz­
ardous items that cannot be transported together. Each mode of transport 
will have a dangerous goods segregation chart detailing what can and can­
not be transported together.
The carriage of dangerous goods by sea is governed by the International 
Maritime Dangerous Goods Regulations (IMDG) (https://www.imo.org/en/
OurWork/Safety/Pages/DangerousGoods-default.aspx (archived at https://
perma.cc/HUR7-EE9C)).
Transporting goods around the globe, by air, is governed by two sets of 
Regulations: International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and 
International Air Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulations 
(http://www.iata.org/publications/dgr/Pages/index.aspx (archived at https://
perma.cc/LKG2-PBSK)).
In the UK, the Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable 
Pressure Equipment Regulations (CDG) and the European agreement ‘Accord 
européen relatif au transport international des marchandises dangereuses par

159
route’ (ADR) together regulate the carriage of dangerous goods by road 
(http://www.hse.gov.uk/cdg/index.htm (archived at https://perma.cc/CG2G-
WD5F)).
Other countries will have their own specific regulations. For example, in 
the United States it is covered by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration (FMCSA) (http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety-security/hazmat/
complyhmregs.htm (archived at https://perma.cc/3RA7-BJF3)).
Separate pictograms are to be used for labelling hazardous goods in 
transport. As these are colour coded, we have not included them here but 
they can be accessed at http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/danger.html 
­(archived at https://perma.cc/C59G-9V9B) where there is also further 
­information.
2.12  Calculating customs duties
Introduction
To be able to calculate the customs duties to be paid when trading goods, 
three factors have to be taken into consideration:
1	 the value of the goods;
2	 the customs tariff to be applied;
3	 the origin of the goods.
Customs valuation is the determination of the economic value of goods de­
clared for importation. Having a standard set of rules for establishing these 
goods’ value is of great importance for several reasons. Customs duties and 
value added tax (VAT) are calculated as a percentage of the goods’ value. 
Economic operators and customs authorities need to have clear rules on 
how to perform this task.
Having a commonly agreed and accurate measuring standard is vital for 
the purposes of:
●
●economic and commercial policy analysis;
●
●application of commercial policy measures;
●
●proper collection of import duties and taxes; and
●
●import and export statistics.
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
160
The value of imported goods is also one of the three ‘elements of taxation’ 
that provides the basis for assessment of the customs debt, which is the tech­
nical term for the amount of duty that has to be paid, the other ones being 
the origin of the goods and the customs tariff.
Once the value of the goods is determined, customs duties can be 
­calculated.
When to use
When importing or exporting goods.
How to use
The importer or exporter needs to understand all the criteria involved in 
calculating customs duty and taxes. The three main elements are as follows.
1.  The value of the goods is normally calculated 
from the commercial invoice
The price actually paid or payable shall be the total payment made or to be 
made by the buyer to the seller or by the buyer to a third party for the ben­
efit of the seller for the imported goods and include all payments made or to 
be made as a condition of sale of the imported goods.
These payments include such things as loading, handling, transportation 
(not within customs territory of the European Union), packing, insurance, 
brokerage, royalties and licences plus many others if relevant.
2.  Customs tariff
All imports or exports must be declared to customs authorities using a com­
modity code.
Each commodity code is made up of a number of different elements such 
as the type of product, the material used to make it, and even the production 
method. You must be able to accurately describe your item to search the 
tool. Utilizing the Trade Tariff tool (https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/ 
(archived at https://perma.cc/FT69-YKWZ)) sections, the following steps 
will help you find the right code:
●
●Enter the search term you want to use – remember an item may not be 
listed by name; it may be shown under what it’s used for or made from.
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

Transport management tools
161
●
●The tool will suggest a section/number of sections, divided into chapters.
●
●The headings in each chapter describe a particular product; only select a 
sub-heading if your item is accurately described.
●
●If your item is not accurately described, check further down the list – if 
none of the sub-headings match your item use the ‘other’ heading.
●
●When you find the correct item type you will be shown the import and 
export codes, and any important information connected to the code – 
such as whether you need a licence to import or export items under this 
code.
NB You’re legally responsible for the correct tariff classification of your 
goods.
Use the following tool to calculate the duty and tax payable in the EU: 
https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/taric/taric_consultation.jsp?
Lang=en&Expand=true&SimDate=20190724 (archived at https://perma.
cc/UB8A-JEQY)
3.  Origin of the goods
‘Rules of origin’ are the criteria used to define where a product was made. 
They are an essential part of trade rules because a number of policies dis­
criminate between exporting countries: quotas, preferential tariffs, anti-
dumping actions, countervailing duty (charged to counter export subsidies), 
and more. Rules of origin are also used to compile trade statistics, and for 
‘made in . . .’ labels that are attached to products. This is complicated by 
globalization and the way a product can be processed in several countries 
before it is ready for the market.
Goods, the production of which involves more than one country or terri­
tory, shall be deemed to originate in the country or territory where they 
underwent their last, substantial, economically justified processing or work­
ing, in an undertaking equipped for that purpose, resulting in the manufac­
ture of a new product or representing an important stage of manufacture.

2.13  How to become an Authorized 
Economic Operator (AEO)
Introduction
Authorized Economic Operator status is an internationally recognized qual­
ity mark that shows the holder’s role in international supply chains is secure 
and that they operate customs control procedures that meet AEO standards 
and criteria according to the UK government.
There are two types of status:
­AEOC – Authorized Economic Operator Customs Simplification
AEOS – Authorized Economic Operator Security and Safety
Companies can apply for either or both.
Authorized Economic Operator Customs Simplification
If you hold this status and are based in Great Britain (England, Scotland and 
Wales), you could benefit from:
●
●a faster application process for customs simplifications and authorizations;
●
●a lower risk score which may reduce the number of checks customs carry 
out on your documents and goods;
●
●a guarantee waiver up to the level of your deferment account.
If you hold this status and are a Northern Ireland trader, you could benefit 
from:
●
●a faster application process for customs simplifications and authorizations;
●
●your consignments receiving priority treatment for customs controls;
●
●a lower risk score which may reduce the number of checks customs carry 
out on your documents and goods;
●
●a reduction or waiver of comprehensive guarantees;
●
●a 70 per cent reduction in a business’s deferment account guarantee;

Transport management tools
163
●
●a notification waiver when making entries into a declarant’s records;
●
●moving goods in temporary storage between different member states.
Authorized Economic Operator Security and Safety
If you hold this status, you could benefit from:
●
●a lower risk score which may reduce the number of checks customs carry 
out on your documents and goods;
●
●your consignments receiving priority treatment for customs controls;
●
●reduced declaration requirements for entry summary declarations and 
exit summary declarations;
●
●reciprocal arrangements and mutual recognition.
­If you have Authorized Economic Operator Security and Safety status, you 
can benefit from Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRAs). The UK nego­
tiates MRAs with other customs authorities.
The UK has negotiated arrangements with:
the European Union
Japan
the People’s Republic of China
the United States of America
Switzerland
New Zealand
Republic of Singapore
The AEO programme is open to all operators, including small and medium-
sized enterprises and regardless of their role in the international supply 
chain. There is no legal obligation for operators to become an AEO; it is a 
matter of the operator’s own choice based on their specific situation. Nor is 
there any legal obligation for AEOs to require their business partners to 
obtain the AEO status.
AEOs can be manufacturers, exporters, importers, freight forwarders, 
customs brokers, warehouse keepers, importers, port operators, airline load­
ers, secure freight parking operatives or carriers.
The AEO concept is based on the Customs-to-Business partnership intro­
duced by the World Customs Organization (WCO). Traders who voluntar­
ily meet a wide range of criteria work in close cooperation with customs 
authorities to assure the common objective of supply chain security.

When to use
When companies would like to benefit from the various simplifications spe­
cifically provided for under the customs legislation.
How to apply
A responsible person, for example a Director, within the business should 
apply for the status. You’ll need to give up-to-date evidence of the person’s 
role, responsibilities and competences.
To meet the criteria, you must have evidence of your business procedure 
and processes.
Approval for Authorized Economic Operator status involves audit visits 
from HMRC staff.
For a close cooperation between customs and the applicant/AEO it is 
recommended to get in contact with the Issuing Customs Authority (ICA) at 
an early stage and to keep that contact even beyond the application process. 
This can help to avoid misunderstandings on both sides and gives support if 
any questions arise.
The company should have in place appropriate organizational measures 
in the fields related to the AEO criteria, aiming at ensuring that risks linked 
to their customs activities may be identified and avoided and/or minimized.
You’ll need to show evidence that you have:
●
●procedures that identify and report any customs irregularities or errors;
●
●taken appropriate action to deal with any irregularities;
●
●procedures that report any customs business changes;
●
●clear procedures for handling controlled goods;
●
●customs record keeping.
When applying for the status you’ll need to provide evidence that you have:
●
●a well-maintained logistics system with a full audit trail;
●
●methods to allow HMRC to access your customs records;
●
●a logical administrative system;
●
●documented procedures to manage the flow of goods;
●
●internal controls that detect illegal or irregular transactions;
●
●procedures to handle licences and authorizations;
●
●archive and retrieval procedures in place;

Transport management tools
165
●
●trained staff to tell HMRC of any system errors;
●
●procedures for checking customs declarations submitted by third parties 
on your behalf;
●
●information technology security measures in place.
If you make declarations on behalf of others, you’ll need to provide evidence 
that you have:
●
●understood your contractual responsibilities and obtained written 
instructions from business partners;
●
●understood your legal responsibilities if acting in the capacity of an 
indirect or direct representative;
●
●processes for choosing business partners;
●
●documented procedures to validate the valuation, classification and 
origin of goods;
●
●procedures to manage or review relationships with clients who are non-
compliant.
A comprehensive list of requirements can be found at the website shown 
below.
The status can take up to 120 days to approve.

2.14  Last mile and micro delivery options
Introduction
‘Last Mile’ is typically a delivery from the last staging post, such as a local 
delivery depot, distribution or sorting centre to the customer or to a customer 
collection point.
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
166
As technology advances and even more customers’ preferences shift in 
this direction, the last leg of delivery is one of the most challenging and im­
portant parts of supply chain management.
The goal of a last mile carrier is to deliver the item as quickly and cost-
effectively as possible.
According to the latest research from Style Intelligence, the market for 
autonomous delivery vehicles and the wider use of autonomous vehicles in 
last mile situations is still emerging.
Business models continue to evolve as vendors seek commercial partners 
and different routes to scale. Trials are frequently approved, but rarely lead 
to scaled-up solutions with significant commercial objectives and service 
improvements.
There are, also, issues with the regulatory environment, congestion in cit­
ies, infrastructure problems (condition of pavements/sidewalks and delivery 
points (space for drone landing) among others).
Parcels make up the bulk of deliveries, but online grocery orders have 
increased recently together with fast-food deliveries.
According to ShipBob, last mile delivery is one of the most expensive as­
pects of retail logistics. They believe that 28 per cent of an online brand’s 
bottom line comes from last mile delivery costs and on average, businesses 
spend approximately $10.10 per order on last mile delivery. Given that most 
retailers offer free delivery and returns this may prove to be unsustainable in 
the future.
Last mile deliveries include the following:
●
●Couriers – vans, cars, motorbikes, bicycles, pedestrian.
●
●Pavement robots such as Starship.
●
●Lockers – static and dynamic (in terms of space); ambient and temperature 
controlled.
●
●Autonomous delivery vehicles.
●
●Drones.
●
●Legged robots.
When to use
If you are considering the various options for last mile delivery of your 
products.

How to use
Table 2.11 shows the advantages and disadvantages of each type of last mile 
delivery. One thing to point out here is that many companies will use a 
­combination of delivery methods, depending on size of products to be deliv­
ered, delivery lead time, location of customers.
Where there are stars (*) in the table, the more stars, the better the 
option.

Conclusion
As can be seen from Table 2.11, there are advantages and disadvantages to 
each of the systems.
However, many of the technologies shown above are still in their early 
stages and therefore it is difficult to compare on a like-for-like basis.
There remains significant competition from courier companies operating 
traditional deliveries direct to homes or via lockers located at high-fre­
quency, convenient, strategic locations.
The novelty of pavement robots, drones, legged robots and ARRs has 
seen growth in these areas; however, it is difficult to see how these technolo­
gies will evolve sufficiently to take the place of courier deliveries in the near 
future.

tools
3.1  Inventory management audit
Introduction
This audit aims to measure the extent to which the inventory is managed 
against known best practices. It is not an exhaustive list of questions and 
should be tailored to individual companies, sectors or environments. 
Nevertheless it will give you a good start in understanding where improve­
ment could be made and will enable you to compare operations at different 
sites.
When to use
This is a good tool to use when you want to improve inventory management 
in your business, start a supply chain implementation project or when tak­
ing up a new job to understand how well inventory is managed in your new 
company.
How to use
Table 3.1 shows the first five sections of the audit. The full audit can be 
purchased from http://howtologistics.com; discount code: lsct2024.
The full audit contains over 50 questions arranged into nine sections 
(inventory analysis, inventory reporting, inventory management parame­
ters, inventory accuracy, data management, demand management, supply 
management, operating efficiency and process management).

3.2  ABC Pareto analysis for inventory 
management
Introduction
ABC analysis or Pareto analysis has been described as a general tool for 
distinguishing ‘the important few from the insignificant many’. This is espe­
cially useful in inventory management. Because of the high cost of holding 
inventory, it is critical to know which items are capable of generating the 
greatest holding cost so that we can focus our effort on managing these 
most important items carefully. ABC analysis for inventory management 
and procurement depends on item ‘usage value’, where usage value is the 
product of usage over a period of time and some indicative item value. By 
ranking usage value from highest to lowest, the few most important items 
can be identified. This calculation is essential because there may be a small 
number of very expensive items that must still be managed carefully, or 
there could be very high usage of low-value items, e.g. fasteners, to which 
it may not be worth dedicating a lot of our precious management effort (see 
VMI, tool 3.17).
We tend to calculate ‘usage value’ over a year but it could be calculated 
over other time periods, e.g. a week or a month. Usage value has several 
other applications in inventory management, including setting the limits of 
the ABC classes, in order to find an appropriate balance between adminis­
trative effort (to raise orders and plan replenishment) and replenishment 
quantity (which influences the average level of cycle stock and hence the 
average level of inventory and inventory holding costs).
When to use
Item values and quantities consumed change over time and so it is useful to 
repeat the ABC analysis periodically to ensure that the class allocations are 
still appropriate, for example every 6 or 12 months.
The Pareto class of an item is used in inventory management to allocate 
the most appropriate inventory replenishment method, e.g. Kanban, MRP 
or classical inventory management methods for dependent items, or to un­
derstand the strategic importance of the item when applying the Kraljic ma­
trix in procurement (see tool 4.6).

How to use
Most inventory management systems have an ABC analysis function. If this 
is not the case, the data can be downloaded into Excel and manipulated 
using the data ‘sort’ function. There are five main steps:
1	 Calculate the annual usage value for each item under consideration 
(formula 1), using some indicative item value (e.g. most recent price, or 
average item value):
	
Annual usage value = annual quantity sold or used × 
indicative item value
(1)
2	 Rank the annual usage values from highest to lowest.
3	 Starting with the highest usage value, calculate the cumulative usage 
value.
4	 Express the cumulative usage value as a percentage of the total annual 
usage value.
5	 Identify the ABC class of each item.
Note that according to the data, it may be more appropriate to change the 
class limits, or even have more than three classes. Typical limits for a three-
class system are:
A	 Up to and including 80% of total annual usage value (x ≤ 80.0)
B	 Greater than 80% and up to and including 95% (80.0 < x ≤ 95.0)
C	 Greater than 95% of total annual usage value (95.0 < x ≤ 100.0)
Where there are a very large number of B or C items, some companies have 
identified four or five classes, by splitting B items into B1 and B2, C items 
into C1 and C2, or introducing a D class to have more precise control.
Example
This example uses just 10 items to demonstrate the method. Clearly, there 
will be thousands of items in practice! Table 3.2 shows the starting data of 
average annual usage and indicative unit cost.
The items are then ranked in order of annual usage value (AUV), starting 
with the highest AUV. Cumulative AUV is then found and this is expressed 
as a percentage of the total (see Table 3.3). The class of each item can then 
be identified, using the limits stated earlier.

3.3  Ballou’s inventory-throughput curve
Introduction
Ronald Ballou is one of the early writers who integrated inventory, ware­
housing, transport and location into a coherent and modern concept of cus­
tomer service-oriented logistics management. His research has contributed 
greatly to the development of the field over the years. One of the many tools 
that he developed from empirical research is a method for using current and 
historical data to understand the relationship between the level of business

carried out by a warehouse and the overall level of inventory required to 
support that level of business.
Ballou makes the point that warehouses are often planned to have a 
certain number of stock turns per year. Although this may be the target, it 
is worth analysing data on existing activities to find out the actual rela­
tionship.
When to use
Periodically, owing to changes in law such as the drivers’ hours regulations 
or changes in markets and demand, it is necessary to review the structure 
of the distribution network. This review includes the location and size of 
warehouses and distribution centres relative to the customers and markets 
they are serving. Alternatively, a new warehouse may be planned to serve a 
new market. Ballou’s inventory-throughput curve gives a first approxima­
tion of the total amount of inventory required to support a certain level of 
business.
How to use
The aim is to plot a graph of the value of the average inventory level against 
the value of annual throughput or sales. Most warehouses produce a weekly 
or monthly report of value of inventory and value of shipments made. The 
average value of inventory can be found by averaging the month-end inven­
tory values from a number of reports. The annual value of shipments can be 
found by summing shipments across the last 12 months or extrapolating 
values from the last three or six months.
If this data is plotted for each warehouse in the network, a graph can be 
built up (see Figure 3.1). The best fit curve is found. If it is proposed to reor­
ganize the network or to open a warehouse in a new market with an esti­
mated volume of business, the total amount of inventory required for a 
given level of business can be found (Figure 3.1).
Example
A distribution network expanded from four to six warehouses between 
20xx and 20xy. Throughput and inventory data are shown in Table 3.4. All 
of these points can be used and are plotted on a graph (see Figure 3.1). The 
best curve has been fitted. This can be done in Excel by selecting scatter plot,

and then adding the best fit logarithmic curve. A new warehouse is being 
planned, which is expected to have a throughput of around £30 million. It 
can be seen from the graph that following previous practice it can be ex­
pected that inventory with a value of approximately £3.6 million will be 
required to support this level of business.
Note that the method assumes that systems and working practices in the 
new warehouse will be the same as in the other warehouses, but this may 
not necessarily be the case. (This example can be downloaded for free from 
http://howtologistics.com)

3.4  Consignment stock
Introduction
The term comes from the old phrase ‘on consignment’, where something is 
supplied to a customer before payment on the basis that the customer will 
only pay for what has been sold on or used and can return any unsold stock. 
Consignment stock therefore refers to inventory that has been delivered 
to your warehouse, but for which you have not yet paid or even issued a

purchase order. When that material is taken out of stock for use, a purchase 
order is sent to the supplier and payment is made. Ownership of the, as yet, 
unused material still in the warehouse rests with the supplier and is trans­
ferred to the customer at the moment of withdrawal for use. The ­consignment 
agreement should specify:
●
●responsibility for any damage before use;
●
●the grounds under which either the customer can return the product, or 
the supplier can reclaim the product;
●
●who pays for the return transport; and
●
●whose insurance covers its presence in the warehouse.
It is common for a period of time to be specified, after which the goods are 
returned to the supplier.
There is a particular application of consignment stock in the retail sector 
where the supplier may use a consignment agreement to propose new prod­
ucts to a retailer, or high-end products the retailer would not normally stock. 
By this means the associated financial risk is shared between both parties 
and sales are equally beneficial to both.
Consignment stock can be part of an ongoing VMI/CMI arrangement 
where ownership of the stock rests with the supplier, and the customer pays 
only for what has been used (see tool 3.17). The advantages and disadvan­
tages for each party are summarized in Table 3.5.

When to use
Although consignment stock looks financially attractive to the customer, it 
must be remembered that the customer is holding this stock until the time of 
use. If this time is not imminent, the stock is simply adding to the inventory 
that must be managed (allocated space, counted, looked after, etc). In gen­
eral, supply chain thinking states that we do not want extra inventory at any 
point in the chain, and that any stock on consignment, rather than delivered 
against a production or supply schedule, is causing a delay in the flow 
through the chain.
Consignment stock as part of a VMI agreement is more acceptable since 
the VMI agreement will have taken into account the stock profile of the dif­
ferent items and set up maximum and minimum stock levels using historical 
data and a plan of future requirements.
In summary, consignment stock without VMI should only be used for 
fast-moving items likely to be used in the very short term. In this instance, 
the flow is hardly limited, the financial effect is primarily a delay to pay­
ment, and the customer has received what they were going to order anyway.

methods/timing of supply, payment terms, maximum stock levels, returns at

the request of the supplier or customer, return transport cost, insurance and 
damage. Specify the liabilities and responsibilities of each party.
Check the VAT rules. The application of VAT to consignment stocks 
­depends as much on ‘control’ (who has the right to withdraw stock) as own­
ership and it is therefore worth checking liabilities with the accounting func­
tion before setting up any agreement, particularly if material is being 
supplied across borders.
Example
A manufacturer is developing a new product and is refining the specification 
through trialling various thicknesses of polymer sheeting. Market research 
has been very positive and the supplier has been engaged to supply material 
as required on consignment, essentially sharing some of the financial risk of 
the development process, on condition that its product(s) will be specified 
for a minimum of the first 100,000 units of production, or one year, which­
ever event occurs first.

3.5  Cycle counting or perpetual inventory 
counting
Introduction
In order to have usable inventory data, it is vital to maintain the integrity of 
the stock records. This requires user discipline but also a good counting 
discipline. The primary purpose of stock checking is to count the items and 
check the quantities found against the quantities recorded in the inventory 
management system. Sometimes it is useful to take advantage of the stock-
checking process to check the location of each item, that it is labelled cor­
rectly and is still in usable condition. The traditional approach to stock 
checking is to set up an annual stock count, usually at the beginning of 
January, or near the end of the company’s tax year. This requires hiring

­temporary personnel or using existing personnel, which may halt activities 
or prevent sales while the count takes place.
Another approach is to count a proportion of items regularly throughout 
the year using normal stores or warehouse personnel. This is known as cycle 
counting or, sometimes, perpetual inventory counting. There are two ap­
proaches to cycle counting: 1) count each item at least once during each re­
plenishment cycle (where the replenishment cycle time is the average time 
between replenishments); and 2) use ABC analysis to set up a counting plan 
(sometimes called a periodic counting plan).
When to use
Cycle counting or perpetual inventory counting is used as an efficient alter­
native to the annual stock count by spreading the counting effort through 
the year, counting higher-value items and fast movers more often than lower-
value or slower-moving items.
How to use
1.  Counting each item at least once during the replenishment 
cycle
The most efficient way to do this is to count the number of items just as the 
replenishment arrives, i.e. count the amount remaining just before the new 
stock is added. At this point, one might expect there to be the least stock to 
count. Since Pareto class A items should be replenished more frequently 
than B items, this will result in counting A items more frequently. However, 
some weeks may see more deliveries than others, so the counting workload 
could see peaks and troughs.
2.  Setting up a periodic counting plan
An alternative to counting just before replenishment is to count a certain 
number of items every week and thus spread the counting workload evenly 
across the year (although there may be more stock to count at times since 
the count will not necessarily take place when the stock level is lowest). For 
example, if the business works 52 weeks of the year and there are 1,560 dif­
ferent items in inventory, we would plan to count 1,560/52 = 30 different 
items each week. Clearly we could count more than 1/52 of all items each

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
184
week if we wanted to count the stock more than once per year. For example, 
we could count 60 items each week if we thought it necessary to count all 
items twice per year.
Let us say that we are planning to count all the items once per year and 
this means counting 30 items each week. How should we choose what to 
count each week? One method is to choose these 30 items at random from 
the stock list, and allocate them to week 1, remove those items from the list 
of items waiting to be allocated, choose another 30 items at random and 
allocate them to week 2, and so on. This ensures that the person(s) counting 
will visit the whole of the stores area and may spot any other problems as 
they carry out the count. Another method is to choose 30 items that are co-
located since there is more chance of finding any misplaced items in this 
way, and the area can be left well organized after counting.
Data about the 30 chosen items are then transferred to a list, either on 
paper or on a handheld terminal. The data required are:
●
●item code;
●
●item description;
●
●item location.
The person carrying out the stock count would normally be somebody fa­
miliar with the stock, for example a person who usually works in the stores. 
It is important to estimate how long counting takes each week so that 
enough stores people are employed and that this task is not forgotten in the 
daily list of tasks and other priorities. In some large warehouses, automo­
tive spare parts for example, some people are employed full-time as stock 
checkers.
Example
A good approach is to use ABC analysis to determine the frequency of 
counting. First, decide the frequency at which you wish to count each cate­
gory of item; for example, to count A items four times per year, B items twice 
per year, and C items once per year. Table 3.6 shows how to determine what 
proportion of the total items will appear on the weekly list. Using the fre­
quencies proposed, a weekly list of 1/13 of all A items, 1/26 of all B items 
and 1/52 of all C items would be created.

3.6  Strategic positioning of inventory
Introduction
For centuries, holding stock has been used to offer reduced lead times to 
customers. Finished goods stock has time value since it is available immedi­
ately. Work in progress can be finished quickly. Raw materials stock means 
that we do not have to wait for the procurement lead times to elapse before 
we can start to manufacture. Downstream activities are thus decoupled from

upstream activities. Since the 1970s, however, we regard inventory as a liabil­
ity and not as an asset. There is, therefore, a balance between the level of 
stock and its ­associated stockholding cost (see tool 4.19) and risk of obsoles­
cence and the financial opportunity it potentially represents in terms of 
avoiding lost sales.
Strategic positioning decisions aim to optimize the location of the inven­
tory in order to increase sales without unnecessarily increasing the stockhold­
ing cost and associated risk. These stocks are often called decoupling buffers. 
They can be used to reduce the lead times in a bill of materials and thus 
­compress the overall planning time in the material requirements planning 
(MRP) calculations.
When to use
Stock levels are reviewed as part of an inventory reduction programme or as 
part of a regular reassessment of investment in inventory. Positioning of 
decoupling buffers is reviewed as part of a demand-driven material require­
ments planning implementation (see tool 4.17 on DDMRP).
How to use
For finished goods stock, the questions are:
●
●What lead time will our customers tolerate? If we cannot achieve this 
lead time, will we lose business?
●
●If we can reduce this lead time by holding stock, will we gain more 
business?
●
●How much demand variation do we want to be able to absorb?
For work in progress, the questions are:
●
●Where are the bottlenecks? Can we protect continuity of production by 
placing strategic stock before the bottleneck (it must never be starved)?
●
●Where are the long lead times? Can we reduce the lead time to deliver the 
product to finished inventory by placing a strategic stock of part-finished 
items to decouple the finishing processes from the supply processes 
(procurement and initial production)?
●
●How much demand variation do we want to be able to absorb?
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

Inventory management tools
187
For stocks of raw materials, components and purchased sub-assemblies, the 
questions are:
●
●Which are the longest lead time items? Would holding stock to decouple 
the procurement lead time from the production lead time enable a more 
rapid response to customer orders?
●
●Which are the riskiest items in terms of supplier reliability? Would raw 
materials stock ensure continuity of supply to production?
●
●How much demand variation do we want to be able to absorb?
Example
Sometimes offering a reduced lead time can win the order. Other times, there 
are industry-accepted lead times at certain points in the supply chain which 
schedulers plan into their build programmes or lead times are already very 
short. In this case, there is no advantage in offering reduced lead times to 
these customers unless you want to respond to the rare urgent demand when 
the planner gets it wrong.
A company based in the United Kingdom supplying laminated flat glass 
products to the building industry was reviewing levels of its finished goods 
stocks. The industry-accepted lead time for simple laminates to common 
specifications was next day delivery, thus requiring finished goods stock. 
Failure to deliver one stock item risked losing the customer to a competitor 
who could deliver all the required stock items. The question here is to de­
termine which are the common specifications and ensure finished goods 
stocks of those specifications. Finished goods stock could be replenished 
within 24–48 hours from production, but raw materials were subject to 
occasional delays of 48–72 hours, when glass was not allowed onto the 
cross-channel ferries from mainland Europe due to bad weather. Clearly, it 
is cheaper to hold a stock of raw materials than finished goods. Further, 
those raw materials can be made into several different products offering 
better reactivity and flexibility to changing demand. It was decided to hold 
enough raw material inventory of common glass sheets to cover production 
for 96 hours as a decoupling buffer from the unreliability of supply as well 
as allowing reactivity to demand variation.

3.7  Measuring demand variation
Introduction
Coping with variation in supply and demand is one of the inventory man­
ager’s biggest challenges. As deliveries from suppliers become gradually 
more reliable due to improvements in on-time delivery performance, the 
spotlight is shifting to the demand side. While we try to obtain better fore­
casts from customers and better demand data (such as point of sale data), 
many companies are still forced to manage finished goods inventory using 
historical data only.
It is therefore important to be able to measure variation in historical de­
mand so as to set safety stock levels (see tool 3.14) to meet future demand 
with a certain level of confidence. We shall consider two methods of measur­
ing variation in demand: mean absolute deviation and standard deviation.
When to use
A measure of demand variation is necessary to be able to set safety stock 
levels for a given level of availability of finished goods stock (see tool 3.14).
How to use
Method 1: Mean absolute deviation (MAD)
The MAD is defined as:
MAD = (∑ | x – x′ |) / n         
(1)
where x’ is the mean demand, x is the demand in a particular time period 
and n is the number of time periods being taken into account.
Method 2: Standard deviation (SD)
The standard deviation is found from:

where x’ is the mean demand, x is the demand in a particular time period, 
n is the number of time periods being taken into account, and ∑ means 
‘sum of’.
Example
Let us consider the demand data for just one item as shown in Table 3.7. The 
final column shows that total demand is 500 units over the 10-week period. 
Hence, we can say that the average weekly demand is 50 units per week 
(500/10 = 50). In preparation for calculating both MAD and SD, data are 
entered into Table 3.8.

Method 1: MAD
Column 3 in Table 3.8 shows the absolute differences between the weekly 
demand and the average weekly demand (which we know is 50 per week). 
For example, the demand in week 20 is 48. The difference between 48 and 
the mean demand of 50 is 2. Thus we see the value 2 in column 3. The two 
vertical lines either side of x – x’ mean ‘magnitude’. This means that it does 
not matter if the actual demand is two units higher or two units lower than 
the average. We are simply interested in how far apart the two figures are. 
The sum (symbol ∑) of all these differences over the 10 weeks is found to be 
30, shown at the bottom of column 3.
The final stage of the calculation is to divide 30 by the number of weeks 
being considered, which is 10. We conclude that MAD for blocks of soap 
from weeks 20 to 29 is 30/10 = 3.
The bigger the variability in demand, the bigger the MAD. We therefore 
now have a means of measuring and expressing variability in demand.
Method 2: SD
Standard deviation of demand is a more accurate measure but is a bit more 
difficult to calculate. In column 4 in Table 3.8, we can see that the absolute 
difference between demand and mean demand found in the MAD calcula­
tion has been squared. To find the standard deviation, we sum all the figures 
in column 4, divide by n – 1 (10 – 1 = 9) and then find the square root. The 
bigger the value found for SD, the bigger the variation in demand.

.
It is worthwhile mentioning that there is a rough relationship between MAD 
and SD where SD is approximately 1.25 times the MAD value. For example, 
for blocks of soap, we found that SD is 3.8 and MAD is 3.0, so here SD is 
1.27 times the value of MAD. Although SD is more complicated to calculate, 
it is a more accurate measure of spread than MAD and should be used if 
possible.

3.8  Periodic review inventory management 
system
Introduction
The specific characteristic of a periodic review system is that the level of 
inventory is checked at regular intervals and it is decided at the moment of 
review whether to place a replenishment order or not. This is in contrast to 
the reorder point system where the time between successive orders can vary.
Figure 3.2 shows the idea. A target stock level (TSL) has been set, made 
up of safety stock plus cycle stock. The cycle stock is the amount of stock 
that is used and replenished under normal circumstances; that is, the amount 
of stock between the level of safety stock and the TSL. The stock level is 
reviewed at regular intervals (indicated by small arrows on the horizontal 
axis in Figure 3.2). At each review, a quantity is ordered that takes the actual 
stock level back up to the TSL (dotted line). An order is placed and the re­
plenishment quantity arrives in due course (indicated by the solid vertical 
lines). The horizontal distance between the vertical dotted line and the verti­
cal solid line is the delivery lead time (reliable in this example). During this 
lead time the stock is still available for use and so the stock level will fall 
during the delivery lead time.

Clearly, this type of method suits computerized inventory management sys­
tems, where the computer program checks the stock level of every item in 
the system against its TSL and generates a group of orders, grouping items 
together on the same purchase order where they come from the same sup­
plier. A computer system can thus review the inventory status for thousands 
of items very quickly. This is rather difficult to handle in a manual system. 
Where inventory is managed using a manual system, it is possible to get the 
same benefits from grouping together items from the same supplier, by re­
viewing all the items from the same supplier at the same time, and spreading 
the suppliers over different days of the week, for example all items from 
supplier P on Monday, all items from supplier Q on Tuesday, and so on.
When to use
This is a method for managing inventory of items subject to independent 
demand, that is, items that are sold from finished goods inventory. It may 
also be used for C items, subject to dependent demand, that are used regu­
larly. This method also forms the basis of a family of related inventory man­
agement systems.
In a typical supermarket, the computerized inventory management sys­
tem reviews the stock levels at the end of each afternoon and sends an order 
to the distribution centre for delivery during the night or early morning.
How to use
This type of system is characterized by regular review intervals and a vari­
able order quantity. The key parameters required to set up the system are the 
review period (R), i.e. time between successive reviews, and the TSL.
The time between successive reviews can be any convenient period de­
pending on the location of the supplier and the ease of delivering regularly. 
Although we saw above that a supermarket typically receives deliveries 
every 24 hours, the delivery frequency can vary enormously in a manufac­
turing company. Usually A items are delivered more frequently and so the 
review period for these items may be daily or weekly. Vendor-managed in­
ventories also use this system (see tool 3.17). A TSL is agreed between the 
customer and the supplier and the vendor makes deliveries at a convenient 
time to ‘top up’ the stock. This might be weekly when delivering fasteners to 
a manufacturing company or every two hours when delivering freshly made 
sandwiches to the shop at a petrol station.

The review period is taken into account when calculating the TSL. 
Longer time intervals between reviews means that a higher TSL will be 
required. The TSL must allow for enough stock to support the users until 
the next review period and until the following delivery arrives. Consider 
the case where the review period is one week and the lead time is two days. 
A replenishment order will be placed to take the inventory back up to the 
TSL and this will arrive in two days’ time. This stock must be capable of 
supplying demand until the next review period (one week from now) and 
until the order placed then arrives (two days after that). Hence, we need to 
take into account the average demand (Dav) over this extended time pe­
riod (formula 1):
TSL = (Dav × [review period + lead time])           
  (1)
+ safety stock level = (Dav × [R +L]) + Sb
If the delivery lead time L is reliable, then the level of the safety stock Sb is 
calculated in exactly the same way as for the reorder point system. Note that 
it is critical to ensure that all elements use the same unit of time, e.g. average 
weekly demand with review period and lead time expressed in weeks.
The quantity to be ordered (Oq) is calculated from the TSL (formula 2). 
Let Sc represent current stock level and Qopen be the quantity of items on 
any outstanding orders (orders already placed for this item but which have 
not arrived yet):
Oq = TSL – current stock level – any open orders 
(2)
= TSL – Sc – Qopen           
Example
Example 1: Find the TSL
Item Z has the following characteristics:
Lead time = 2 weeks
Review period = 1 week
Average demand = 60 per week
Safety stock = 20 units
The TSL is found by applying formula 1:
TSL = (Dav × [R + L]) + Sb = (60 × [1 + 2]) + 20 = 200

Example 2: Find the order quantity
The TSL for item V is 120. At the time of the periodic review, it is found that 
the current stock level is 42. There are no open orders.
Applying formula 2:
Oq = TSL – current stock level – any open orders
= TSL – Sc – Qopen = 120 – 42 – 0 = 78
An order should be placed for 78 units of item V.

3.9  Reorder point inventory management 
system
Introduction
The reorder point system is based on the idea that when the inventory level 
falls to or below a certain level, the reorder point, we place an order for 
more, for a predetermined quantity. Figure 3.3 shows what happens under 
ideal conditions. The reorder point (sometimes called the reorder level), 
shown as a dotted line in Figure 3.3, is one of the defining parameters of this 
type of system and is set in advance. The reorder quantity (Oq) is also set in 
advance.
It can be seen from Figure 3.3 that the reorder point has two components. 
The first is the quantity between the level of safety stock and the reorder 
point. The reorder point must be set high enough to meet the expected aver­
age demand during the delivery lead time (L), i.e. while waiting for the re­
plenishment quantity to arrive. If there is a safety stock, the reorder point 
must also take into account that we do not expect to use the safety stock 
under average conditions. The emphasis has been placed on ‘average’ here 
because we only expect to use the safety stock under conditions that are not 
average, e.g. lateness in delivery or higher than average demand.
So the reorder point is the sum of the quantity of safety stock, Sb, and the 
quantity that is expected to be used during the delivery lead time, L. The

195
quantity that is expected to be used during the delivery lead time is easily 
found by multiplying the average rate of demand, Dav, by the lead time, L 
(see formula 1):
ROP = (L × Dav) + Sb        
(1)
After each transaction, the residual inventory level is checked against the 
safety stock. If the inventory level is at or below the reorder point (taking 
into account any existing open orders), a replenishment order is created. 
This is therefore a continuous review method, with fixed order quantity. 
According to the rate of demand, replenishment orders are raised as and 
when required, and the time between raising successive replenishment or­
ders can vary. This means that a number of different orders could be raised 
on the same supplier during the day, where a vendor supplies a number of 
different items. This may not be the most efficient method for minimizing 
transport costs.
Note that it is critical to express all data in the same time units, usually 
days or weeks.
When to use
This is a method that is suitable for items subject to independent demand, 
that is, sales from finished product stock. It can also be used for regularly 
used C items subject to dependent demand (i.e. materials and components

required for a production schedule). There are many different inventory 
management systems for managing inventory subject to independent demand 
and this method is one of the building blocks for many other methods.
Historically, when inventory was managed using manual records, it was 
an advantage to raise orders continuously so as to spread the administrative 
load. Today, using computer systems, and trying to group as many items as 
possible to as few suppliers as possible, periodic review systems are more 
prevalent, particularly in retail distribution.
How to use
To set up a system like this, the following steps must be taken for each item:
1	 Analyse demand to obtain an average level of demand per time unit, Dav, 
say average demand per week.
2	 Obtain an indicative lead time, L, for each item and express this in terms 
of the same time unit, say weeks.
3	 Set the inventory parameters – Oq and Sb. For guidance, see the sections 
on replenishment quantities (tool 3.10) and setting safety stock levels 
(tool 3.14).
4	 Determine the reorder point, ROP, from the data above.
5	 Monitor the average demand and lead times. If they differ significantly 
from the quantities used previously to calculate the reorder point, the 
reorder point should be updated.
Example
Example 1: Setting the reorder point
A new item has been added to the inventory management system of a ware­
house and so the reorder point must be calculated. It is expected that about 
20 boxes of this item will be sold per week and it has been decided that there 
should be a safety stock of 10 boxes. Using a delivery lead time of three 
weeks, we now have all the data required to set the reorder point:
Dav = 20 units per week
L = 3 weeks
Sb = 10
ROP = (L × Dav) + Sb = (3 × 20) + 10 = 70

After each transaction, the residual inventory level is checked against the 
reorder point, taking into account any open orders (formula 2):
If (stock balance + quantity on outstanding orders) 
(2)
≤ ROP, then place an order.
Example 2: Raising a replenishment order
An order has just been received in a warehouse for 10 boxes of plastic gloves. 
The inventory record shows that there are 69 boxes in stock. The reorder 
point is 60. The reorder quantity is 200. There are no open orders. Should a 
replenishment order be raised? Remember that this system is a continuous 
review system and we review the stock level after each transaction.
New stock balance = opening stock – quantity issued = 69 – 1 = 59.
Then we apply formula 2:
Stock balance + quantity on outstanding orders = 59 + 0 = 59 
If (stock balance + quantity on outstanding orders) 
≤ ROP, then place an order
We can see that 59 is less than the reorder point of 60, so an order is raised.
Let us say that later the same day another order for boxes of plastic 
gloves is received. This time the order is for two boxes. We make the issue as 
before and the new stock balance reduces to 57. Should we order more? We 
apply formula 2 again, but this time we have an open order:
Stock balance + quantity on outstanding orders = 57 + 200 = 257
The stock balance plus quantity on open orders is greater than the reorder 
point, so another order will not be placed.

3.10  Replenishment order quantities
Introduction
A replenishment order is raised to trigger purchase or production of more 
units of an existing inventory item to replace what has been used or sold. If 
the replenishment order is to be produced (rather than purchased), the order 
quantity will have a major impact on the level of work in progress, the num­
ber of setups and the overall lead time. The size of the reorder quantity also 
has a major impact on the average level of finished goods stock that is held. 
We can see this from the traditional ‘saw tooth’ inventory model shown in 
Figure 3.4.
The model shows that the average inventory level is given by the safety 
stock level plus the average level of cycle stock (formula 1). In this simple 
model, the average level of cycle stock is half the total amount of cycle 
stock:
	
Average level of inventory = safety stock +1/2 (cycle stock)
(1)
We know that if we place a lot of small orders (where Oq, the order quan­
tity, is small), the cost of administration and delivery for those small or­
ders will be high. Similarly, if we order in large quantities, the cost of 
administration and delivery will be low but the average level of stock 
(formula 1) will be high. Many years ago, these two conflicting factors 
were encapsulated into another theoretical model, called the economic 
order quantity (EOQ) (tool 3.11), and it was used in some industries for 
a number of years. These days, however, we prefer to use this model to

understand where improvement should be sought but use other methods 
to calculate the actual quantity to be ordered. In short, we need to find the 
smallest order quantity that is practicable. There are many more reasons 
for ordering the smallest quantity possible:
●
●less safety stock required;
●
●more frequent deliveries, which leads to greater reactivity to changing 
demand;
●
●lower stock levels, which requires less storage space;
●
●less chance of obsolescence, damage and other shrinkage;
●
●easier to count;
●
●easier to introduce new items.
It can be seen that it is the ‘soft’ costs, or hidden costs associated with inven­
tory, that are reduced by ordering in smaller quantities and so it often takes 
more effort to justify this method financially. Methods for reducing the ad­
ministration and delivery costs associated with small orders include:
●
●using local vendors where possible;
●
●using milk rounds to collect supplies from vendors;
●
●purchasing as many items as possible from the same vendor to render 
frequent deliveries of small amounts of each item economic;
●
●raising a blanket order and calling off deliveries against it;
●
●using ‘soft’ forms or ordering by internet;
●
●using VMI;
●
●using Kanbans.
In production, it is necessary to continue to keep reducing set-up times in 
order to minimize the penalty for switching production from one product to 
another, and thus enable smaller and smaller production quantities to be 
economic.
When to use
Sometimes we have little control over the size of the replenishment quantity. 
The supplier insists on a minimum order quantity (or value) or supplies only 
in multiples, e.g. boxes of 100. The factory insists on a certain run time or a 
production tank holds only a certain volume. However, when you can buy 
or make exactly what you want, how much should you buy or make?

How to use
If you are in the fortunate position of being able to set any replenishment 
quantity you wish, a good starting point is to consider what delivery fre­
quency is ideal and then try to figure out how this can be sensibly achieved. 
A useful guide for doing this is, once again, ABC analysis. The delivery fre­
quency will differ according to the sector. Some examples are given below.
Example
An ABC delivery schedule for replenishment quantities will be developed for 
three different sectors (see Table 3.9).
Automotive assembly lines work at a certain speed or rhythm, and to a 
sequenced schedule made up of customer and stock orders. The consump­
tion rate of parts and assemblies, and the sequence in which they should be 
delivered, is therefore known. Ideally, parts should be delivered at the last 
possible moment (to minimize storage space required) and, ideally, to the 
lineside without any unreturnable packaging.
Typical engineering companies do not consume the same volume of parts 
and assemblies as automotive assembly lines and are also usually subject to 
greater variation in demand. Although this means that safety stocks are likely 
to be higher, it also means that deliveries will be necessarily less frequent.
In the retail sector, supermarkets are supplied with fresh goods and 
fast movers every 24 hours, while dry goods and household items may be 
replenished every two to three days.

3.11  Economic order quantity (EOQ), 
by Geoff Relph
Introduction
Ford W Harris, while working for Ford Motors in Michigan in 1913, de­
rived a method of establishing an economic order value. It is based on the 
principle that there is a balance between the cost of ordering and the cost of 
holding stock. Figure 3.5 shows this relationship graphically.
The essence of the formula is that the cost of holding inventory is 
­expressed as the cost of:
●
●owning/renting the warehouse;
●
●staff to secure and run the warehouse;
●
●losses of stock through waste, obsolescence and shrinkage;
●
●lost opportunity of the money tied up in the stock.
It is expressed as the formula Quantity ordered × Unit cost × (Cost of 
holding/2).

This is then balanced against the cost of ordering inventory, which is ex­
pressed as the cost of:
●
●placing order with supplier;
●
●transport to warehouse;
●
●receiving and putting to stock.
It is expressed as the formula (Demand × Cost of ordering)/Quantity 
ordered.
Figure 3.5 shows that the two costs reach a balance point – this is the 
economic order quantity (QOPT). It can be expressed as a formula, whose 
derivation is shown in Figure 3.6. Figure 3.7 shows how the formula works 
and the data needed to calculate the value.
There has always been a lively debate as to the effectiveness and suitabil­
ity of the EOQ, the key being the difficulty in determining the true values of 
the cost of ordering and the cost of holding inventory. However, it highlights 
the essential relationship that needs to be considered when determining the 
most effective order size, which balances these two costs. The issues of not 
being able to evaluate these costs are addressed in the next section.

When to use
All too often when suppliers are asked to give a suggested minimum order 
quantity (MOQ), their motivation is to minimize their production cost and 
thus maximize their profit. Often a supplier may incentivize larger batches 
by offering discounts for the larger quantities. The buyers typically have 
‘cost down objectives’ so will find this attractive; however, the planners/op­
erations team will suffer as a result of higher inventories.
How to use
EOQ is useful when testing to see if the discount is really worthwhile, given 
that you have a reasonable estimate of the cost of ordering and cost of hold­
ing stock. It is easy to test the offer made by the supplier by calculating the 
EOQ for the two costs offered by the supplier and then seeing how close to 
the calculated EOQ the MOQ requirements are.
Example
Let’s say that our supplier for item 9 in Table 3.2 (tool 3.2) is offering a 
discount of 5 per cent if we increase the MOQ to 150 units. We had asked 
for an MOQ of 75 based on our calculations.
Table 3.10 shows the EOQ calculated for a range of different costs/dis­
count percentages from 5 to 75 per cent. It is clear from this analysis that the 
5 per cent discount does not justify the increase to a MOQ of 150 as the 
equivalent EOQ for 5 per cent discount or unit cost of 12.59 is only 79.72. 
To achieve an equivalent EOQ to the offered 150, the discount would need 
to be just below 75 per cent, which would give an EOQ of 155.41.

Table 3.10 shows that if only the cost of managing inventory is considered, 
then the MOQ of 75 is cheaper, even with the 5 per cent discount on the unit 
cost. However, when the cost of purchase is also taken into account, giving 
the total inventory cost, the larger MOQ is cheaper. This is because, based 
on the same annual demand, the savings from the cost of purchase more 
than offset the higher cost of holding.
This simple financial analysis would therefore suggest that a higher MOQ 
was acceptable. However, in this case additional considerations will need to 
be taken into account. For example, the MOQ will be buying 12 months’ 
stock; is there a risk that the demand may change in the 12 months, or the 
stock may deteriorate or become obsolete? Overall the benefit is only 
2 per cent rather than the 5 per cent offered by the supplier, with any in­
creased costs and risks moved from the supplier to the business.

Page, London; Relph, G J and Newton, M (2014) Both Pareto and EOQ have

3.12  Combining Pareto with EOQ to enhance 
group analysis, by Geoff Relph
In tool 3.2 we looked at Pareto and tool 3.11 looked at EOQ as two tech­
niques for the management of inventory groupings and determining the 
­optimum batch size. In tool 3.10, Table 3.9 gives suggested order periods 
based on industry types. If our business does not exactly fit one of the three 
categories described, the answer may be to use the EOQ.
When to use
If we are unsure of where we are in relation to the industries shown in 
Table 3.9, we may want to compare the EOQ with the recommended deliv­
ery intervals. The EOQ is a quantity and the values in Table 3.9 are time 
intervals. We can convert the EOQ to a time interval, known as the eco­
nomic order period (EOP). We can calculate the EOP for each item and list 
them against the recommended Pareto class calculated in Table 3.3.
How to use
If we use the formula from tool 3.2 and the items in Table 3.2, we can calculate 
EOQs for the 10 items, as shown in Table 3.12. What is clear is that there is no 
specific relationship between the annual usage, unit cost or annual usage value 
of the product to the recommended EOQ. However, items 3, 4 and 5 have 
similar EOQ in spite of having entirely different Pareto positions. The typically 
used order periods shown in Table 3.9 may not necessarily be the best ones.
However, we can easily convert EOQ to economic order period (EOP), 
which would allow us to evaluate the days of cover. Figure 3.8 shows how 
to extend EOQ to EOP – or the optimum period represented as number of 
days of stock rather than the absolute quantity.

We now add the EOP calculation to and create Table 3.13. Looking at the 
annual usage values, we can see the higher the annual usage value, the lower 
the EOP days. What is obvious in Table 3.13 is that there is a direct relation­
ship between EOP and the position of a part in the Pareto list, with item 4 
being the top-ranked part having the lowest EOP of 24 days, item 5 a B-class 
part with an EOP of 81 days, and item 3 a C-class part with 290 days. We 
can compare the average EOP for each class and compare to the industry 
types shown in Table 3.9.
Example
In Table 3.13 we can see that for the items in class A an appropriate fre­
quency might be monthly, for the B-class quarterly and the C class would be 
annually.

3.13  Material Requirements Planning (MRP)
Introduction
Materials requirements planning (MRP) first became known in the 1960s 
when computers were used to calculate the timing of manufacturing and 
purchase orders for dependent items, i.e. raw materials and components to 
be used in production where the quantities required depended upon the 
quantity of finished product to be made. Later, MRP was a module in MRP2 
systems and subsequently ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems.
MRP calculations require information from the bill of materials (BOM), 
the delivery schedule or demand forecast and the inventory management 
system. Due to the amount of computing power required, it was common 
to use MRP for A- and B-class items only and to use classical inventory 
management methods (such as periodic review or reorder point, tools 3.8 
and 3.9) for C-class items.
When to use
When planning delivery of raw materials, components and sub-assemblies 
for production to meet a delivery forecast of a product.
How to use
There are two processes in MRP, ‘netting’ and ‘offsetting’:
1	 Net requirements = Gross requirements minus inventory
2	 Time to launch the order = time when delivery is required minus lead time
Starting from product level, we work through the bill of materials, netting 
out existing inventory and taking account of already scheduled arrivals into 
stock, in order to determine the net requirements. Taking into account pro­
duction and procurement lead times, manufacturing and procurement or­
ders are planned and launched at the appropriate times to ensure the de­
mand forecast is met.
Example
We will use the example of an office chair. The full example can be down­
loaded for free as an Excel spreadsheet from http://howtologistics.com.

Table 3.14 shows an extract from the indented bill of materials. One office 
chair needs 1 rolling base in the final assembly. The rolling base is made up 
of 5 spokes, 1 hub (not shown) and 5 wheels. Spokes are cut from tube. 
Fasteners are not shown.
Order quantities may be fixed (or multiples thereof), a minimum quantity 
or ‘lot for lot’ (LFL) meaning that you can order exactly the quantity 
­required.
We start at product level, so level 0, the office chair (Table 3.15). The 
forecast delivery schedule is shown as gross requirements (GR). Scheduled 
receipts (SR) and on-hand inventory (OH) are netted out, leaving a net re­
quirement (NR) of 120 units for day 21, 180 on day 22 and 140 on day 23. 
Since the order quantity for office chairs is lot for lot (LFL) we plan manu­
facturing orders (MOP) for these quantities. Offsetting by a lead time of one 
day releases these orders (MOR) on days 20, 21 and 22 respectively.

Release of an order for office chairs generates a demand for rolling bases at 
level 1, 1 base for 1 office chair (Table 3.16). There is no on-hand inventory, 
but a previously planned manufacturing order is expected to arrive on day 20, 
enough to cover the demand on day 20 and part of the demand on day 21. 
The net requirement for 140 units on day 22 generates an order quantity of 
200 because the order quantity is fixed at 100 or multiples thereof.
Demand on day 20 for 100 rolling bases generates a demand for 500 
spokes (Table 3.17). There are no scheduled receipts but a projected availa­
ble inventory of 800. Thus, demand on day 20 is covered but more are re­
quired to cover demand on day 21. Spokes are ordered in lots of 1,000. A 
lot is therefore planned to arrive on day 21, for which the order is launched 
on day 20.

Spokes are cut from tube B. Tube B is delivered in 5 metre lengths. Hence, 
each length of tube B can make 500/35 spokes = 14.28 or 14 spokes. For 
1,000 spokes, 72 lengths are required, or 360 metres (Table 3.18). The pro­
curement lead time is three days. The minimum order quantity is 150 metres 
so this requirement is met.

3.14  Safety stock calculation
Introduction
Safety stock is sometimes also called buffer stock or security stock. If we 
examine the consumption patterns over the same 10-week period of the two 
items A and B in Table 3.19, we can see that they both have an average de­
mand of 50 units per week. Now look for the maximum and minimum

values in each column. It can be seen that item B has much greater variabil­
ity in demand, ranging from 12 to 89.
Let’s say that we replenish the stock of both items once per week. Since 
item B has a very high variability in demand, a lot of extra stock, or safety 
stock, will be required to ensure that we can supply during the weeks of high 
demand. This is stock that is held over and above the amount of stock re­
quired to meet average demand. A key question to examine is just how im­
portant a stockout is to you. If a stockout means losing a contract or a 
customer, a life-or-death situation (hospital, aircraft, pharmaceuticals, for 
example), you will be prepared to invest more in safety stock. If the items 
are easily substitutable (different colour, make, package size), you may not 
be prepared to finance a significant amount of safety stock.
So we need to be able to measure this variability to determine how much 
safety stock is required for a given level of customer service or ‘protection 
level’ (protection against stockouts). If you are familiar with statistics, you 
will know that standard deviation is used to measure variability in data. The 
standard deviation of demand for item A is 3.8 and for B is 25.7, reflecting 
the greater variability in demand for item B.

Standard deviation is the preferred method for setting safety stock levels 
but there are other methods for those who are not familiar with statistical 
methods. Two easier methods are ‘time buffer’ and using historical data. In 
the time buffer method, we add safety stock to cover average demand for a 
certain period of time, for example two days or a week, according to how 
safe you want to be. Using the historical data method, we look back at de­
mand over previous periods and identify the few times when demand was 
very much higher than average. A common-sense decision must then be 
made about whether to cover these occasional high demands and therefore 
how much safety stock to keep.
The ‘How to use’ section will present all three methods. We will focus 
mainly on covering variability in demand rather than variability in lead 
time.
When to use
Safety stock is required whenever you want to meet demand that is greater 
than average and/or if the replenishment lead time is highly variable. Longer 
than average lead times can result in failure to meet demand and so safety 
stock can be used to compensate for this.
How to use
Method 1
Formula 1 shows how to calculate standard deviation:
SD = √(∑(x – x′)2 / (n – 1))        
  (1)
Where: n = number of weeks (10 in Table 3.19)
x′ = mean demand (50 in Table 3.19)
x = data item (actual demand in Table 3.19)
The normal distribution is used to determine the ‘protection level’ required, 
i.e. the proportion of time that demand can be met. In our example, adding 
safety stock equivalent to one standard deviation of demand would yield a 
protection level of 84.1 per cent (50 per cent + 34.1 per cent), since this is 
the proportion of the population under the normal distribution curve 
(Figure 3.9) from minus infinity up to the mean plus 1 standard deviation 
of demand.

214
Method 2
In the time buffer method, we add enough safety stock to cover demand for 
a certain time period. For example, a particular supplier is often one week 
late in delivering but rarely more, and so we may decide to add safety stock 
equivalent to one week of demand for that item.
Method 3
In the historical demand method, we look at historical data. Consider the 
demand for item B in Table 3.19 once again. If these 10 weeks are indica­
tive of demand over the year, we can see that in 10 per cent of the weeks, 
demand is over 80; and in 30 per cent of the weeks, demand is over 70. 
Using 50 weeks per year for simplicity, we might decide that it is accepta­
ble to have stockouts in five weeks of the year (10 per cent), but unaccep­
table to be out of stock during 15 weeks of the year (30 per cent). We 
would then keep a safety stock of 30 units (remembering that 50 is the rate 
of average demand and safety stock is used to cover demand that is greater 
than average). Data for more weeks will give a more accurate picture of 
demand variation and result in a more accurate estimate of the safety 
stock ­required.

Example
Let us say that we are looking for a 90 per cent protection level for item B 
in Table 3.19, i.e. we want to meet demand for 90 per cent of the time:
●
●Using method 1, normal distribution tables show us that 90 per cent 
protection level requires safety stock equivalent to 1.28 standard 
deviations of average weekly demand, so 1.28 × 25.7 = 33 units.
●
●Using method 2, we may estimate that we need about three days of safety 
stock, or half a week’s demand, so a proportion of 3/5 or 2.5/5 of average 
weekly demand (assuming five trading days per week), which would be 
25 or 30 units of stock.
●
●Using method 3, and assuming that these 10 weeks are indicative of the 
year’s weekly demand pattern, it was shown earlier that 30 units of safety 
stock would give a protection level of approximately 90 per cent.

Further information
For those who are unfamiliar with statistical methods, it is highly recom­
mended that logistics managers get some training in this area. Many 
books and general training courses are available.
Those who are familiar with statistics may be interested in looking at Stock 
and Lambert (2001), which gives a formula for safety stock that takes the 
standard deviation of lead time into account in setting safety stock levels 
as well as the standard deviation of demand: Stock, J and Lambert, D

New York. Further information can be found in: Relph, G J and Milner,

3.15  Stock counting
Introduction
To have confidence in the inventory management system it is vital to count 
stock regularly and ensure that the quantities shown in the inventory man­
agement system are actually present in stock. In this section, we consider the 
nitty-gritty of looking for explanations of any differences.
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
216
When to use
All companies should count their stock at least once per year for the purpose 
of preparing the annual accounts. In the section on cycle counting (tool 3.5), 
it is explained that it is often beneficial to count fast movers and higher-
value items more than once per year in order to maintain close control and 
high availability.
How to use
If there is a significant amount of stock to check it may be necessary to close 
the business while counting takes place. It may be carried out by the com­
pany’s employees only, over a weekend or during a shutdown, and tempo­
rary staff may be hired to supplement existing staff and speed up the ­process.
1.  General process
●
●Plan the stock count well in advance and train the staff who will be 
carrying it out.
●
●Specify the area to be checked and ensure that each zone and location is 
clearly identified (to prevent omissions and duplications in counting).
●
●Produce a list of what is expected to be found in each zone or sub-area, 
including identity, description and location, listed in the order in which it 
is expected that the items will be found. Do not include the actual 
quantity. This list may be either in hard copy or accessed electronically by 
a handheld device.
●
●The stock checker moves systematically along each zone, up and down 
each rack or shelf, according to the layout and height of the storage area, 
identifying and counting items found.
●
●Note that two staff will more than likely be required to count stock at 
height.
●
●It is important that there is ready and adequate means of recording any 
anomalies or deviations from the list. For example, an item may be found 
earlier or later than its stated location (and the new location must be 
recorded), an item may be found damaged or missing an identity label, 
etc, and all this must be carefully recorded.
Great care should be taken over the unit of measure for each item. For 
­example, should a box of 50 items be recorded as 50 items or as one box? 
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

Inventory management tools
217
Normally the list of items should show the unit quantity of each item clearly 
or the stock checker should make clear what has been counted.
Some special equipment may be required, e.g. weigh scales for loose 
items, dipsticks for fluids, measuring tapes, gauges, reel measuring devices, 
cages for lifting personnel, etc. Sometimes it is necessary to open a box or c 
rate. Materials must be provided for closing and resealing. Sometimes open­
ing such packages may damage the contents, e.g. for some aircraft parts, and 
therefore information on the external labelling will have to suffice.
2.  Resolving differences
A procedure must be followed to identify the source of each difference, be 
that quantity, location or condition. If the difference cannot be found, the 
data in the system must be adjusted.
First, we look at differences in quantity. Before making any adjustments 
to the system data, consider the following questions:
●
●Were any issues or receipts of the item in question made while the stock 
check was being carried out?
●
●If a manual system is being operated, have any arithmetic errors been 
made in the receipts and issues calculations since the last stock check?
●
●Was it difficult to count these items? If so, go back and recount them.
●
●If using a paper-based system, are the figures recorded by the staff legible? 
Could a 1 look like a 7, for example?
●
●Is it possible that the items are stored in more than one place? If so, 
consult the stores person or the inventory management system to find 
other locations.
●
●Is it possible that the count itself is not very accurate (for example, 
weighing a bottle of a chemical fluid to estimate how much remains, or 
measuring a length of tubing to estimate how much remains)? If the 
difference is less than x per cent, then make no adjustment. The value of x 
depends on the accuracy of the measuring system and the desired accuracy 
of the stock count.
●
●If more was found than expected, does this difference tally with a recent 
loss of stock at the last count? For example, the material could have been 
put in the wrong place and then somebody found it and restored it to the 
right place.
●
●Are there any unfulfilled orders in the warehouse or could there have 
been a short shipment recently?

●
●If there is less than expected, have any unauthorized personnel been in 
the storage area since the last count? Has somebody removed the item 
without recording the issue?
●
●If there is less than expected, is this item of use outside the business? 
Might somebody have an interest in stealing it? (In general, look for sys­
tem errors first before thinking about theft. There are so many opportuni­
ties for system errors and they are the cause of the difference in most 
cases.)
Next, we consider differences in location. We have already seen that items 
may be stored in more than one location. The fifth point above indicates that 
we did not find enough stock at a certain location and that we should look 
for more locations of stock for this item. Secondly, we may find stock of an 
item in an unexpected location. It is important that the location data are cor­
rect so that the stores people can find a required item quickly and efficiently. 
Any differences in location should be discussed with the stores personnel so 
that a decision can be made about which are the ‘correct locations’ and then 
the data records can be updated accordingly.
Finally, the stock checker may notice that some items are damaged or 
dirty or otherwise not in good condition. Each case should be examined and 
a decision made on the future of the stock, for example whether the stock is 
usable or must be removed and replaced. This can also be a good time to 
identify stock that has been in the warehouse for an excessive time period 
and is unlikely to be used in future.
3.  How to improve future accuracy
Stock data accuracy must become part of company culture, requiring a high 
level of operator discipline:
●
●New employees should be well trained in company procedures and be 
told exactly what is expected of them, including use of computer systems, 
counting practices, etc.
●
●All stock should be protected by access control measures such as card 
readers, or closed-circuit television cameras.
●
●All items and locations should be clearly identified. Procedures should be 
accessible to all personnel, maybe via a shared area on the company 
network, or printed in a folder in a common area.
●
●There should be easy feedback mechanisms for any comments, 
observations, etc, with a clear point of contact. A responsible ‘help’ point 
should be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Example
A new set of materials-recording processes had been implemented by con­
sultants into a medium-sized manufacturing company. It appeared that the 
set of processes was either incomplete or erroneous since the company was 
obliged to count stock every quarter and effectively write off around 
25 per cent of material that was believed to be on site! In view of the nature 
and size of the materials involved, theft was not the source of the problem.
All raw materials issues, production records, semi-finished product pro­
cessing records, finished product inspection records and finished product 
stock records were examined for a period of eight weeks in order to under­
stand the flow of material through the factory from suppliers to customers, 
and many system and discipline errors were found. To correct the problems, 
it was necessary to:
●
●explain to personnel the importance of system discipline and ensure that 
each person was familiar with the recording processes and was properly 
trained;
●
●create procedures for special products that had been ignored in the 
original system;
●
●clarify the production routes and recording points for each product type, 
including in particular handling of withdrawals from finished stock for 
further processing;
●
●clarify how to record problems, e.g. rejection at inspection, re-work.
In consequence, the stock check became an annual event, carried out by 
personnel over a weekend, saving 10–12 production days per year. Inventory 
accuracy increased to over 95 per cent in the first year after implementation 
of the changes.

3.16  Stock turn
Introduction
One of the easiest measures of inventory performance to implement and to 
understand is ‘stock turn’. Crudely, this means how often the stock turns 
over during the year. In other words, how many times on average does the 
material flow in and out of the storage area? For the same level of availa­
bility, a higher number of stock turns indicates better management of 
­inventory.
In practice, of course, we know that different items will have very differ­
ent levels of stock turn. Some items may not be issued at all (non-movers or 
stock turn of zero). Some may be used and replenished every week. Hence it 
is useful to consider the overall stock turn for the whole inventory (­formula 1) 
and also stock turn for each individual item (formula 2); stock turn for one 
item can also be calculated using values instead of quantities.

Sometimes it is not possible to obtain the cost of total annual issues and it is 
easier to obtain the monthly value of stock purchases. This will work just as 
well so long as the data are consistent for the year.
When to use
Warehouses and distribution centres measure overall stock turn as part of a 
daily, weekly or monthly inventory performance report. In manufacturing, 
monthly or even six-monthly measures suffice.
When stock turn is calculated for individual items, we can identify the 
‘fast movers’ (those with the highest stock turn) and the slow movers (those 
with the lowest stock turn). Non-movers in a period will have a stock turn 
of zero.

How to use
The average inventory level can be found from the inventory management 
system or by averaging the end-of-month inventory level figures over a period 
of time. As mentioned above, either total monthly issues or total monthly 
purchases can be used to indicate throughput, so long as only one type of data 
is used for the whole period under review.
Examples
Example of stock turn calculation for one item. We are going to calculate the 
number of stock turns for safety boots over the year. Table 3.20 shows the 
issues and end-of-month stock by month for one year. Note that a delivery of 
50 pairs of boots was received in June.

First, we need to find the average stock level. To do this we find that the 
average of all the month-end figures is 37.2 (take the sum of all the end-of-
month stock levels and divide by 12).
Secondly, we find the total number of pairs of boots issued over the year. 
From Table 3.20, we see that 68 pairs of safety boots were issued over the year.
Using formula 1, we can now calculate the overall stock turn for the year:
	
Stock turn for safety boots
Quantity of item i issued
during the year
Average stock level of item i 
(1)
Using formula 2, we can now calculate the stock turn for the year:
	
Overall stock turn =
Cost of total sales(£)
Average cost of goods stored(£)
(2)
We conclude that stock turn for safety boots for the year was just under 2.
Example of overall inventory stock turn. Over the last 12 months, the cost 
of total sales from a warehouse amounted to £5,000,000 and the average 
cost of goods stored in the warehouse was £500,000.

3.17  Vendor-managed inventory 
(and co-managed inventory)
Introduction
VMI brings efficiency through grouping more items to each supplier order, 
having fewer suppliers and combining these with a regular ‘milk round’ 
delivery by the vendor.
On perhaps a daily or weekly basis, the vendor visits the customer’s 
premises, checks the level of physical stock and adds sufficient replenish­
ment items to take the stock level back up to the desired target stock level 
(TSL), keeping a record of what has been supplied. The customer is then 
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

Inventory management tools
223
invoiced, perhaps weekly or monthly. In some cases, the vendor has remote 
access to the inventory management system to identify the quantities issued 
of each item and is thus able to prepare the replenishment stock in advance 
of the visit. Clearly, the ability to operate VMI correctly depends on the level 
of stock issue discipline being operated by the customer.
Lack of discipline in some cases has given vendors considerable problems 
and this is an area that must be addressed before setting up VMI. If the cus­
tomer is not disciplined, there will be unexpected stockouts that have noth­
ing to do with the vendor’s activity or efficiency. On the other side, some 
customers have been concerned that the vendors have been keeping too 
much stock on site (thus taking up too much space in their warehouse) or 
they have experienced too many stockouts due to poor estimates of inven­
tory parameters by the vendors. Thus VMI in many cases has been super­
seded by co-managed inventory (CMI) to reflect the fact that it is often 
better to set the inventory management parameters jointly. Maximum and 
minimum stock levels are agreed together, as are replenishment criteria and 
performance measures. If the customer anticipates extra demand, the ven­
dor should be warned in advance. If the vendor foresees any supply prob­
lems, the customer should be notified, and so on.
The main advantages of VMI/CMI are that the administrative costs of the 
client company are much reduced, including the costs of setting up purchase 
contracts, placing purchase orders, receiving replenishment quantities, man­
aging the stock, keeping inventory records, making issues and paying sup­
plier invoices. This can take up a disproportionate amount of time compared 
to the value of the items concerned. For example, if 500 different types of 
fastener can be supplied from one source, with one invoice per month, there 
could be considerable cost savings compared with the cost of carrying out 
purchase and delivery arrangements with perhaps over 20 suppliers, each on 
different ordering and delivery cycles.
When to use
In the retail sector, VMI/CMI is used increasingly in shops of various sizes. 
For example, a battery manufacturer directly replenishes batteries in super­
markets. A sandwich maker delivers more sandwiches to augment the stock 
in petrol stations every two hours, thus ensuring that the product is fresh 
and that the most popular fillings do not run out.
PepsiCo delivers a whole range of products directly to many small city-
centre stores in the United States, puts the stock on the shelves and invoices

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
224
the customer for the quantities delivered. This saves stockroom space and 
staff shelf-filling time but also has been found to prevent stockouts and in­
crease sales for both the retailer and PepsiCo.
In industry, VMI/CMI is being used more and more for C-class items 
(low-value and/or low-usage quantities), typically fasteners, connectors and 
other non-critical items such as production consumables, office supplies, 
safety equipment and lubricants. In recent years, higher-value items such as 
spare parts have been under vendor management, stored at the hub of an 
express parcel company where it then becomes relatively economic for the 
express delivery company to deliver parts over a wide area very quickly.
How to use
First, the group of items to be supplied by a particular vendor is agreed with 
that vendor. It is in the interests of the customer to obtain as many items 
from the vendor as is possible to minimize transport and administrative 
costs. Sometimes the vendor is willing to add items to its stock list for a 
particular customer.
It is important to give the vendor appropriate historical data about item 
usage and the best possible forecast for future usage. If these cannot be sup­
plied or are considered to be unreliable, larger safety stocks must be used 
(i.e. higher minimum stock levels).
The general conditions of setting up an operation will be discussed and 
agreed, including:
●
●frequency of visits, for example to fit in with the vendor’s other clients in 
the area so that transport is economic;
●
●maximum and minimum limits for the stock of each item, calculated by 
the vendor (VMI) or agreed together (CMI);
●
●frequency of invoicing;
●
●taking inventory of existing stock and any outstanding orders, so that the 
vendor can take over management of replenishment.
Example
A customer and vendor are setting parameters for the stock of high-visibility 
jackets in a factory. Issues over the last three years appear to be reasonably 
stable (see Table 3.21). However, further analysis shows that the monthly 
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

225
issue quantity can vary enormously (Table 3.22). Further questioning re­
veals that a party of visitors made one large withdrawal in April (which was 
not returned) and on induction a group of apprentices required another 
batch of jackets to be issued (and these jackets were then kept by the ap­
prentices).
Although the annual rate of usage is quite small, issue quantities can be 
highly variable and so it was decided to have a large safety stock since a 
stockout could have safety implications. It was agreed to hold a safety 
stock of 15 jackets. Apart from the visitors and apprentices, average 
monthly consumption is approximately two. The minimum level was there­
fore set at 17 to be safe, and a maximum level of 20. Fortunately, this ven­
dor supplies a wide range of other items, so the jackets were added to the 
list of stock item levels to be checked on the weekly visit. In practice, this 
means that the vendor checks the stock level weekly and adds enough jack­
ets to take the stock level back up to 20 jackets. Since this is a new item for 
VMI, and a safety requirement, both sides agree to monitor the situation 
carefully. Electronic access to the company’s inventory management system 
is being discussed.

3.18  Identification and disposal 
of surplus stock
Introduction
Inventory must be managed actively or it will just grow. Whether you have 
taken over an inventory that has not been managed properly for a while, or 
you are already actively managing your inventory, you need to identify stock 
that is in excess, obsolete or time-expired and you need an agreed policy for 
disposing of it. It is not always easy to set up a disposal policy since some 
accountants are reluctant to dispose of stock at less than book value. Some 
kind of discount is usually necessary for disposal. Nevertheless, it is impor­
tant to identify and dispose of surplus stock, otherwise it just ties up operat­
ing capital and storage space, both of which can be used for more profitable 
activities.
When to use
Some businesses review their raw materials stock or finished goods stock at 
regular intervals, perhaps once or twice per year. Other companies use 
events to trigger a stock review; for example, reviewing spare parts inven­
tory for a machine that has just been sold or scrapped, or the need to create 
space for a new range of products.
How to use
Two separate elements are required: 1) identification of surplus stock, i.e. 
excess, obsolete or time-expired; 2) creation and application of a disposal 
policy.
1.  Identify surplus stock
‘Excess’ means that you have more stock of an item than is necessary and 
can usually be identified using stock cover, calculated as:
Stock cover (days) = Current stock level / average daily rate of usage
If the stock cover seems excessive, this may be a candidate for disposal. 
Investigate why the stock cover is so high. Was the demand forecast too 
optimistic? Is it a slow mover? Can this item only be made or obtained in

Inventory management tools
227
large quantities? Is there a minimum production or purchase quantity? Did 
somebody buy too much so as to qualify for a quantity discount?
‘Obsolete’ means that there is no further demand for this item. These 
items can be identified by looking for non-movers over a time period. ‘Non-
mover’ means that no stock of this item was issued during that period (see 
Figure 3.10). The time period depends on the nature of the stock and the 
industry. For example, fast-moving consumer goods companies are inter­
ested in stock movements over recent weeks. Managers of spare parts inven­
tories look at non-movers over the last few years. Again, each suspected 
obsolete item must be investigated before being identified as a candidate for 
disposal. If they have not been flagged up by the inventory management 
system already, time-expired items are identified by searching inventory re­
cords for their time of arrival and date of expiration.
2.  Disposal policy
The disposal policy must be created and agreed by a group of representa­
tives from the departments responsible for inventory management, ware­
housing, accounting and purchasing (for their experience of searching 
supply markets). It covers the identification of items that are considered 
to be redundant, deciding how to dispose of them, their removal from the 
inventory management system and final disposal. Before creating the pro­
cedure, it is useful to brainstorm all possible disposal methods. These may 
include:

●
●Destruction, or adding to normal company waste.
●
●Adding pages to a company website indicating the items that are available 
for sale, with or without a suggested price, and details of who to contact 
for more information.
●
●Approaching the original vendor in case these items may be of interest. 
This can work well for spare parts, as the vendor may know of other 
companies still using the same type of equipment that may be interested 
in purchasing a job lot of spare parts.
●
●Advertising in specialist magazines or websites indicating the type of 
items available and who to contact for more information.
●
●Placing the items for sale through internet sales portals, either general 
sales sites or specialized sites for the sector.
●
●Sub-contracting the advertising and sales process to a company 
specializing in surplus inventory disposal, usually for a percentage of the 
sales value realized.
●
●Inviting a company specializing in surplus inventory to come and remove 
the items for some nominal value, or for a fee.
●
●Charitable donation, which can be tax-efficient.
The main elements of the policy are as follows:
1	 Identify potential stock for disposal. For example, annually create a list 
of surplus stock, non-movers and expired items. Apply the methods 
described above.
2	 Inform the users. Circulate this list to their main users (e.g. production, 
maintenance, projects, engineering, transport, warehouse) for comments 
to be returned before a certain date. Do the users envisage any future use 
for these items?
3	 Agree the final list for disposal. Each user department discusses the list of 
proposed items for disposal and either agrees to disposal of the item or 
makes a brief justification for retaining the stock. A list of items signed 
off for disposal is returned to the inventory manager.
4	 The items for disposal are physically removed from the main stock to a 
separate area ‘awaiting disposal’. Their location in the inventory 
management system is changed to this new location and their status is 
also changed to ‘awaiting disposal’. The user departments are informed 
that this has been done.
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

Inventory management tools
229
5	 The ‘book price’ of each item is given by the accounting department and 
the disposal group agrees the best method of disposal for each item.
6	 When disposal occurs, the items are issued from the ‘awaiting disposal’ 
area. The items are deducted from the inventory management system and 
the item record is closed when all stock has been disposed of.
7	 Finally, the accounting department writes off any difference between the 
book value and the realized value.
Example
Many companies manage production materials very well (raw materials, 
work in progress, finished product) but some do not apply the same level of 
inventory control to stocks of spare parts. A new manager to a company in 
the oil and gas sector in India identified a stock of obsolete parts worth 
several millions of dollars that he thought could still be useful to oil and gas 
companies in other parts of the world. The company set up a website that 
listed the items available, their prices and conditions of sale. Over a period 
of 12 months it managed to dispose of about three-quarters of the stock 
value to North Africa, South America and other exploration and produc­
tion areas.
Further information
An internet search using the term ‘inventory disposal’ will bring up a myriad 
of example procedures from specific organizations as well as companies that 
specialize in this sector.
3.19  Managing spare parts inventory
Introduction
Inventory is generally managed using forecasts and historical data (for items 
subject to unknown demand) and by stocking items for planned future 
needs (expected demand). This is also true of spare parts inventory where 
some spare parts are stocked for regular maintenance or projects (expected 
demand) and others for breakdowns (unknown demand).
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
230
There are now many options for managing spare parts inventory including:
●
●Using suppliers that have placed stocks of strategic items at carrier hubs 
for rapid delivery.
●
●Holding spare parts on consignment (see tool 3.4) or ‘use or return’ 
agreements (e.g. for planned maintenance interventions).
●
●Using 3D printing for certain parts.
●
●Sharing visibility of stocks with a sister or neighbouring company.
●
●Accessing a network of users of similar equipment.
●
●Joint planning of major maintenance activities in a group of companies 
to take place at different times so that ‘might be required’ inventory can 
be moved to the next site that may need it.
●
●Centralizing inventory as much as possible so as to minimize safety stock.
●
●Increasing the proportion of planned maintenance so as to reduce the 
number of spares to be stocked for breakdowns.
●
●Using more sophisticated software and modelling for analysing 
breakdowns and anticipating future failures.
●
●Outsourcing some maintenance.
●
●Using asset condition monitoring to anticipate failures.
When to use
It is worth reviewing the total value of the spare parts inventory against the 
level of service on an annual basis taking into account the events that have 
occurred over the year, e.g. new equipment to maintain, equipment that has 
been sold, new tools, materials, supplier agreements, particular problems 
that occurred as well as projects for the next year, e.g. refurbishment, new 
equipment, modifications or higher/lower reliability requirements.
In industries with continuous production, e.g. oil and gas, any downtime 
means loss of revenue. A downtime cost per minute can be calculated.
At this point, consider whether the spare parts inventory strategy should 
be revised.
A non-mover analysis (see tool 3.18) should be carried out annually. A 
large number of non-movers could also trigger a review.

Inventory management tools
231
How to use
Spare parts inventory management must be linked to the management of the 
maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) activity for which the spare parts 
are being used. For planned maintenance, a list of parts required and the 
time of requirement must be supplied from the maintenance planning sys­
tem to the inventory manager to enable existing stock to be checked (e.g. for 
items left over from the previous requirement) and allow new stock to be 
purchased in time.
Whether items are stocked for expected or unexpected demand, it is crit­
ical to carry out ABC analysis and identify each item’s class, in terms of 
usage value (see tool 3.2), and also usage rate (see tool 1.3). To distinguish 
usage rate classes from usage value classes, we shall call them XYZ, where 
X represents fast movers and Z the slowest movers.
Items that are stocked in case of breakdowns are far more difficult to 
manage and the stock will depend on a number of key questions:
●
●How likely is it that the item will be required in the next year (1–10)? 
(1 = unlikely, 10 = certain).
●
●How critical is a stock-out of each item? Can we substitute another size/
material, etc? Give each item a criticality rating from 1 to 10 (1 = 
unimportant, 10 = absolutely critical).
●
●How rapidly can each item be obtained in time of crisis? Give each item 
a rapidity rating from 1 to 10 (1= fast, 10 = long lead time).
●
●What is the minimum quantity that must be bought?
●
●Is there a ‘use or return’ (consignment stock) agreement with the supplier?
●
●What was the average annual requirement for this item over the last five 
years?
●
●What maximum annual requirement was seen in the last five years?
●
●What minimum annual requirement was seen in the last five years?
The last three questions aim to understand the level of demand (1 per year? 
100 per year?) and the variation in demand (e.g. 0 some years, 10 or 15 oth­
ers?). Clearly, these questions are most critical for the A items. It is much 
cheaper to hold a bigger safety stock of a C item than an A item. More im­
aginative solutions, such as some of those in the introduction to this tool, 
will have to be employed for some of the A and B items.
Ultimately, the total number of different items and their stock levels will 
depend on the total budget available for inventory and the desired level of

service to the MRO operation. The ‘best guess’ of future needs will come 
from an analysis of past needs for the same or similar equipment, obtained 
from your company’s own records, the manufacturer or other users of this 
type of equipment. Sometimes there are user groups that are willing to share 
this information.
When managing spare parts inventory, it is particularly important to 
­record:
●
●all failures to supply an item immediately (to determine level of service) 
and reason for non-immediate supply (e.g. stock-out due to late delivery, 
unusually large demand, dearth in supply market);
●
●the time required to supply items that were not supplied immediately, 
from time of demand to time of issue;
●
●all returns to stores and reasons for non-use;
●
●cost of any movement from one site to another (for the ‘move or buy’ 
decision).
Finally, it is important that the users of the inventory take a disciplined ap­
proach. In the heat of the moment, when responding to a breakdown, it is 
easy for the issue to go unrecorded. If, as in many cases, the spare parts 
stores are unmanned, security cameras or access control records must be 
used regularly to check that all issues have been recorded.
Example
Table 3.23 shows a selection of items from a spare parts stock and the data 
used to decide how each item should be managed.

4.1  Supply chain management audit
Introduction
Many companies have still not integrated their logistics functions (customer 
order processing, transport, warehousing and storage, inventory manage­
ment, planning and scheduling, distribution) into a seamless supply chain 
operation capable of interacting smoothly with their suppliers, customers 
and service providers. This audit aims to highlight some of the elements of a 
seamless operation in order to give companies that wish to implement sup­
ply chain management some idea of what has been achieved already and 
what, if anything, remains to be done.
The questions are organized in seven sections: logistic customer service, 
strategic procurement, supplier management, inbound transport, 3PLs, sales 
and operations planning, and production planning and scheduling.
The fact that we talk about a supply chain indicates the linkage necessary 
between the different stages of movement of a product and the different par­
ties involved to achieve this, rather than a simple series of transactions, 
which is logistics management. Table 4.1 shows an extract from the full 
supply chain management audit. The complete audit can be downloaded for 
a small charge from http://howtologistics.com; the discount code for readers 
is lsct2024.

demand, the less inventory we need in the chain to maintain stock availabil­
ity to the final consumer and in the chain in total. In the mid-1990s, the 
Voluntary Inter-industry Commerce Standards (VICS) Association agreed to 
support an initiative to enable manufacturers and retailers to forecast de­
mand jointly and subsequently plan together the supply of certain items 
traded between them. This involved not only delivery planning but also ex­
changing information about forthcoming promotions and other commercial 
activities, usually regarded as confidential. Since this required communica­
tion between information systems, some major software houses were in­
volved as well. The overall results reduced the number of stockouts, reduced 
inventory levels, increased stock turns and increased sales, by ensuring that 
the pattern of supply met the pattern of demand more closely. Protocols and 
other operating methods were established.
Owing to advances in computer systems, and in the exchange of data 
between companies in particular, more and more companies are undertak­
ing some kind of joint planning and forecasting with key suppliers and 
­customers to achieve these benefits, even though it may not be through 
membership of GS1 US (which merged with VICS in 2012).
When to use
A lot of attention has been paid to improving on-time delivery in the last few 
years and this has enabled incoming inventories to be reduced. Further re­
ductions to overall inventory levels can only be made by improving informa­
tion about demand and this is proving more difficult to achieve. Any 
­company that wishes to improve information flow regarding demand would 
benefit from closer communication with key customers and by exchanging 
information about their respective commercial actions (e.g. promotions, 
new products) for the forthcoming months. Some companies simply have 
too many products to track in this manner and so the items generating 80 
per cent of sales would be an obvious focus to start with. Although the 
manufacturer–retailer relationship has been most publicized, the supplier–
manufacturer link can also benefit.
How to use
Although CPFR® represented a specific agreement between companies under 
the aegis of VICS, many companies can carry out some form of joint plan­
ning and replenishment in other ways. Many companies do this by simply

exchanging Excel spreadsheets. Many of these simple business tools are sent 
via the internet, are undocumented and are clearly open to abuse or prob­
lems if one of the parties suffers illness or worse. If a supplier and customer 
find that this kind of exchange is beneficial to them, it should be worth in­
vesting in a more formal process to increase security and ensure business 
continuity.
A visit to a major supplier or customer to discuss how this could operate 
and the benefits that it could bring is a good way to start. It is critical that both 
parties are in agreement about the objectives and methods of data exchange. 
It is useful to set up a workshop for the main personnel from each party to 
discuss their business processes, planning tools and decision timing. It may 
require two or three days to agree the most efficient way to work together. 
Process maps or flow charts (see tool 1.28) are a useful tool for this.
The main process steps are:
1	 Supplier first creates a top-level forecast from historical records.
2	 Customer updates this forecast to include any extra information it has, 
e.g. more/fewer shops, expanding/contracting business, and adds 
information regarding commercial actions.
3	 Supplier adds information regarding promotions, product launches, etc.
4	 Supplier proposes replenishment plan.
5	 Customer agrees or modifies and sets up replenishment orders.
Example
One CPFR® case study that really grabs the attention was the cooperation 
between Henkel and Eroski. Henkel is a large multinational manufacturer 
of over 10,000 items with headquarters in Germany. Eroski is a retail chain 
of supermarkets and hypermarkets mainly based in Spain. A CPFR® pilot 
study was introduced for nearly 2,000 items supplied by Henkel to Eroski. 
Overall results included an increase in customer service level while also re­
ducing inventory in the Eroski warehouse, significantly improving the reli­
ability of forecasting, increasing truck and pallet fill and reducing the num­
ber of urgent orders.
Another example concerns a supplier to the automotive aftermarket and 
a major customer who wanted to carry out joint planning and replenish­
ment, rather than formal CPFR®. A team of three or four people from each 
organization spent several days together in a Kaizen workshop to discuss 
their processes for replenishment planning and how they could work

­together in the most efficient way. The overall objective was to reduce the 
‘soft’ costs associated with replenishment planning and ordering while min­
imizing the level of stock and maximizing availability of product. The out­
comes of the workshop included harmonized timing of decision making, an 
agreed format of data in an Excel worksheet, and clear processes and re­
sponsibilities.
Further information
URLs for the Henkel–Eroski case study keep changing but it is well worth 
the effort to look for it. The search terms ‘Henkel Eroski CPFR case 
study’ will usually find a document or slide show summary pretty quickly.
Simply using the search terms ‘CPFR case study’ will find many more cases 
of interest. See http://www.gs1us.org/ for a wealth of information on 
supply chain data standards.
4.3  Demand forecasting
Introduction
Many companies do not produce good forecasts, if any. This can be under­
stood to a certain extent since the mathematics can rapidly become compli­
cated. This tool will not enable you to make forecasts, but it is hoped that 
you will be inspired to think about how better forecasting can help your 
business, and then take steps to implement an improved forecasting process.
In essence, forecasting uses historical data to identify patterns that are 
likely to continue, enabling us to predict what may happen in future. The 
safest way to handle forecasts is to remember that ‘All forecasts are wrong!’ 
but some are better than others. It is worth making the effort to improve 
forecasting. Companies that have a better idea of what the future may bring 
are usually better prepared for that future.
Demand forecasting is particularly critical in supply chain management. 
The more information we can get about future demand, the less likely we 
are to suffer from excess inventory or shortages.
When to use
Forecasts are important for planning and decision making. We use sales 
forecasts to ensure that we have enough capacity for production and enough

orders placed with suppliers for goods and services. The sales forecast is the 
basis for the procurement budget, which in turn must be financed. Similarly, 
the sales forecast will determine the capacity plan, which must be resourced 
in terms of space, equipment and labour.
Depending on the purpose of the forecast and the sector, the frequency of 
forecasting can vary from a rolling 20-year plan for equipment investment 
in the heavy engineering sector to a daily sales forecast for fast-moving con­
sumer products in the retail sector.
How to use
It is beyond the scope of this short introduction to describe forecasting 
methods in any detail but we can consider the major elements of forecasting 
to see what is involved. The overall process has three steps:
1	 Collect data on historical demand, by product family or individual items.
2	 Use a mathematical method to create the forecast.
3	 Use market-specific knowledge to add any other factors that may have a 
bearing on the situation and determine whether the forecast is pessimistic 
or optimistic and whether some ‘tweaking’ is required.
1. Collect data
This information can be extracted from an inventory management system to 
identify sales or usage of an item on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.
2. Use a mathematical method to analyse the data
The first method to look at is ‘time series analysis’ where the historical data 
can be considered to be a ‘time series’, i.e. a data item that is changing over 
time. A time series has four major components that can be separated out:
a	 Overall trend – is the level of sales increasing, decreasing or remaining 
stable over time?
b	 Seasonality – is there an effect of changing demand at different times of 
the year, for example increased sales of chocolate at Christmas and 
Easter?
c	 Cyclic change – are there other factors that increase demand on a regular 
basis, for example increased sales of DIY products at the weekend?
d	 Random variation or ‘noise’ – if the effects of trend, seasonality and cyclic 
change are removed from the time series, some random variation will 
remain.

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
242
Any demand forecast will have to take account of trend, seasonality and 
cyclic change. Our next stage is to consider how to create the forecast. There 
are many methods, ranging from simple moving averages to exponential or 
regression models, and others.
A certain amount can be done by hand but the use of forecasting soft­
ware is highly recommended, either as part of the business management 
software that you are using already, or as a separate package. It is worth­
while identifying somebody in your organization who has an appropriate 
mathematical background or capability and who would be willing to under­
take a short course in forecasting, or learn to use a forecasting package.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that there are several methods for measur­
ing the accuracy of the forecast and this is an essential part of generating 
confidence in the forecasting process. As data quality and forecasting meth­
ods improve, there should be an equivalent improvement in forecasting ac­
curacy, measured and observed.
Example
The Henkel and Eroski case study used to illustrate CPFR® (see tool 4.2) is 
an excellent example of how forecast accuracy can be improved and the 
benefits this can bring. The majority of demand forecasts were more than 50 
per cent wrong at the beginning of the project period but within 12 weeks, 
80 per cent of the product forecasts were less than 20 per cent wrong. This 
was achieved by improving the quality of data being used by both compa­
nies for forecasting.
In summary, it is possible and highly desirable to improve the quality of 
forecasts used in your business but it does take some mathematical effort 
and interest to do so.
Further information
Many standard texts on operations management give a good introduction 
to forecasting. For those who really want to study the subject, Makridakis 
et al (1998) explain the many different approaches clearly: Makridakis,

4.4  Factory gate pricing (FGP)
Introduction
FGP was introduced into the UK in the early 2000s by UK retailers to reduce 
their overall transport costs, reduce inventory holding in their distribution 
centres (DCs) and stores, and increase efficiency by reducing the number of 
vehicles delivering to site and improving throughput through improved co­
ordination and consolidation. The introduction of lean principles into the 
retail supply chain (known as quick response) led to smaller, more frequent 
deliveries, which increased the pressure on the DCs.
Previously this system would have been described as supplier collection 
and – to a certain degree – nominated carrier schemes. The principle is very 
similar to an ex-works situation (see tool 2.5) whereby the consignee col­
lects from the consignor and is liable for all the costs entailed. From a re­
tailer viewpoint, vehicles delivering to stores from the distribution centres 
are able to call back into suppliers on their return journeys and collect prod­
uct destined for the DC. This can be full or part loads or a number of collec­
tions from multiple suppliers. This will ultimately depend on the capacity 
available on the truck and the time available for the driver.
This will result in an increase in on-time delivery at the DCs and greater 
visibility within the supply chain. Studies have shown (Potter et al, 2007; Le 
Blanc et al, 2004) that logistics-related costs can be reduced by between five 
and eight per cent. Potter et al (2007) describe FGP as ‘the use of an ex-
works price for a product plus the organization and optimization of trans­
port by the purchaser to the point of delivery’.
When to use
When companies are looking to reduce costs and improve visibility within 
the supply chain. In reality, any company with a fleet of vehicles making 
deliveries to customers that has suppliers in close proximity can use this 
system. This can include the collection of raw materials, provided that the 
vehicles are suitable for both inward and outward journeys.
If vehicles are continually running back empty to base and have sufficient 
time available to collect goods from local suppliers, then, provided that an 
agreement on cost can be arrived at with the supplier and a regular pattern 
of collections set up, there is no reason why it cannot be instigated. Daily

fixed transport costs are now shared across two deliveries rather than one. 
This also reduces the amount of empty running that takes place on today’s 
roads.
However, there can be issues for the suppliers who may well have opti­
mized their fleet and achieved transport efficiency when including these de­
liveries to the customer. Any reduction in delivery volume will have an effect 
on the cost per delivery and the overall efficiency of that operation. This is 
also the case where suppliers have contracted with a local haulier or 3PL to 
undertake their deliveries, with FGP resulting in less volume being trans­
ported by these companies.
In fact, suppliers need to address the following, according to Alan 
Braithwaite, a leading British expert on logistics and supply chain manage­
ment:
●
●How much discount can they afford to allow the retailers for collecting 
their product?
●
●How do they deal with the different pace of change adopted by the 
various retailers who will introduce FGP at different speeds?
●
●How do they deal with their existing infrastructure and logistics contracts 
as volume is transferred to retail control – making it less cost-effective?
●
●What commercial, pricing and ‘terms of trade’ policies and structures are 
appropriate in this new era?
●
●Finally, how will FGP affect their own fleet operations if volumes are 
going to reduce significantly?
There needs to be a workable agreement between supplier and buyer and if 
the supply chain as a whole is going to gain, the two parties need to work 
together on this initiative. It can be seen as very one-sided.
How to use
The first step is to identify which suppliers can be incorporated into the 
scheme. This will be based on location, volume, frequency of delivery, out­
bound vehicle delivery schedules and current cost of outbound and inbound 
delivery (if this can be extrapolated from the product cost).
Where it is not cost-effective to change from supplier delivery to FGP, the 
situation with those particular suppliers will remain as is. However, there 
are instances where suppliers are now collecting from DCs and delivering to 
stores on their route back to their facility (see Figure 4.1).

245
The buyer will need to invest in an IT system that can manage this whole 
process. There are many transport management and supply chain optimiza­
tion systems on the market; many of these can be found from tool 2.9.
Compatibility of product is a factor in terms of which supplier collections 
can be consolidated. This can include cube, weight, temperature require­
ments, fragility and whether hazardous or not. Scale is also important here, 
as is the availability of a good information technology system to manage the 
movements.
Finally, there needs to be an understanding on behalf of the buyer’s logis­
tics team of the supplier’s warehousing operation. This needs to include 
hours of operation and means of loading vehicles. The increasing use of 
double-deck trailers by retailers for store delivery can cause issues at sup­
plier locations if their loading bays are not capable of receiving such ­vehicles.
Communication between the inventory and logistics team is vital, as is 
the relationship with the suppliers to ensure a smooth and accurate flow of 
information between parties.

4.5  Kanban
Introduction
Kanban is the Japanese word for signboard or card (Japanese Management 
Association, 1986) and is just one element of the Toyota Production System 
that has been generalized into ‘Lean’ production. Here, we are looking at 
how Kanbans are used as a method of replenishment.
There are different types of Kanban signals and Kanban systems, but for 
our purposes we will just consider a simple circuit where Kanbans are used 
to pull parts from a previous stage in the supply chain. These parts could be 
coming from a previous production stage or an external supplier.
When to use
This is particularly useful for supplying to production lines parts of high 
value or parts that are frequently used. It can be used for parts that are sup­
plied nearly all the time (runners), or regularly (repeaters), but is not appro­
priate for parts that are rarely supplied again (strangers). It is an excellent 
method for reducing cycle stock of parts from external suppliers (particu­
larly if they are local) or for minimizing work in progress for parts from 
internal suppliers.
How to use
Figure 4.2 shows the Kanban circuit. It can be seen that a full box of parts 
is sent to the customer, internal or external. Once all the parts are used, the 
empty box is returned to the previous production stage or to the supplier to 
be refilled. If the supplier is external, the supplier collects the empty boxes 
when the next delivery is made, whether that is by the supplier’s own vehicle 
or milk-round vehicle, or other transporter.
There are three essential elements to setting up and running a successful 
Kanban system. The first is the nature of the containers that move the parts 
and the second concerns the number of containers or boxes in the system. 
The third element is system discipline.

Parts are moved in boxes, where a known and fixed number of parts are al­
lowed in the box. Although boxes are used most frequently, the ‘container’ 
may be anything that holds a certain number of parts safely and can be 
moved easily. This could be, for example, a hanging rail, tube, crate or trol­
ley; ‘box’ is used here for simplicity. Normally, ‘inserts’ (formed packaging 
with shaped spaces for the parts) in the box ensure that only that type of 
part can be put into the box, and only a certain quantity of parts. The ideal 
quantity and therefore size for a box is about one hour’s work or a box that 
will hold a weight that can be easily lifted. This varies enormously according 
to the size and weight of the part. Usually a Kanban card is attached to the 
box and the Kanban identifies the part name, part number, quantity to be 
held in the box, source of the part, destination of the part, and the sequence 
number of the box against the total number of boxes for that part type.
The total number of cards for that part type in circulation controls the 
overall level of inventory that is allowed for that part type. The more cards 
that exist, the greater the amount of inventory there will be, with all its as­
sociated holding costs and tied-up operating capital. The number of cards and 
boxes required, however, depends on all the elements that control the flow of 
parts in terms of capability to supply and rate of consumption of boxes.
The number of boxes is calculated from formula 1 below. It can be seen 
that a longer lead time to supply will result in more cards being required. 
Similarly, if there is high hourly demand or if a greater safety stock is 
­required, a greater number of cards are necessary. However, if parts are

(1)
Where: N = number of Kanbans
d = hourly demand
c = capacity of container
t = average time to obtain a replacement box (in hours)
s = safety stock (in hours)
For the system to operate well, the rules must be strictly observed. The box 
must contain only the exact number of parts shown on the Kanban card, no 
more, no less. Only the appropriate box for that part may be used to trans­
port it. The box must contain only good, usable parts. A box must never be 
supplied without a Kanban card. The box must be emptied completely be­
fore being returned to the supplier.
Example
An assembly line makes 100 washing machines per day and the motors are 
supplied by Kanban in containers holding five units. The working day is 
eight hours. A safety stock of two hours is required.
It can be seen immediately that 20 (= 100/5) containers of motors will be 
required each day, but how many boxes should there be in the circuit? 
Empty containers are picked up every hour to be taken back to the goods 
receiving area, awaiting collection when the next delivery arrives from that 
supplier. This supplier delivers every two hours, and the supplier is about 
half an hour away from the washing-machine assembly company. The sup­
plier usually refills the boxes within an hour of their arrival and then they go 
out on the next delivery run. Once at the washing machine company, it may 
take up to an hour before the boxes are delivered to the assembly area. The 
total time in this refill circuit is summarized in Table 4.2.
Let us now substitute this data into formula 1:
d = hourly demand = 100/8 hours = 12.5 units per hour
c = capacity of container = 5 motors per box
t = average time to obtain a replacement box (in hours) = 7 hours
s = safety stock (in hours) = 2 hours

It is concluded that we need 23 containers and cards in the circuit. We can 
see that, at any one time, there could be five full boxes waiting for assembly 
(safety stock of 2 hours = [12.5 × 2]/5), two or three boxes waiting to be 
returned to goods inwards (12.5/5), plus a maximum of five boxes waiting 
to be returned to the supplier ([12.5 × 2]/5), plus five boxes coming back 
from the supplier plus two or three boxes waiting to be delivered to the as­
sembly area, plus some in transit for a short time (5 boxes for half an hour ≈ 
2 or 3 on average). In practice, we would see how this number of Kanbans 
worked and then adjust it accordingly.

4.6  Kraljic matrix
Introduction
The procurement function has changed dramatically since the 1990s, from 
a ‘purchasing’ activity that was regarded as primarily administrative, look­
ing for the ‘best value’ items to buy, to a strategic function (see tool 4.22) 
that is capable of generating profit and competitive advantage for the busi­
ness by sourcing from high-performing suppliers. One of the milestones in 
this transformation was a paper by Peter Kraljic (1983) in which he de­
scribed a way of analysing the portfolio of purchased items and services. 
The purpose was to adapt the method of procurement to the complexity of 
the supply market, and the relative importance of that purchasing decision 
to the business.
The overall complexity of the supply market depends on such factors as 
the number of potential suppliers available, the rate of technological change, 
barriers to entry for potential new suppliers and potential transport com­
plexity, perhaps due to distance or special packaging requirements.
The relative importance of the purchasing decision to the business de­
pends on such factors as the overall value of the decision, the strategic im­
portance of the item to the business and impact of the price of this item on 
profitability.
These two factors form the axes of a 2 × 2 matrix and an approach to the 
procurement task is defined for each quadrant (see Figure 4.3).
When to use
This is not an everyday tool but is useful for periodic re-evaluation of pro­
curement approaches in the business. The relative importance of items or 
families can change over time as new products are introduced and the prod­
uct mix changes. It can also be useful before the introduction of a new 
product in order to review the relative importance of its different compo­
nents, assemblies or raw materials.
The Kraljic matrix is a good communication tool for explaining procure­
ment methods and strategies to different user functions. Communication 
between the procurement function and user departments is vital to making 
the best supplier and product selections.

How to use
It is advisable to carry out a Pareto or ABC analysis (see tool 3.2) first in 
order to understand which purchased items or families have the greatest 
­financial importance. Then the items or families can be placed in the quad­
rants, either by the procurement function or by discussion between procure­
ment and user functions. Finally, the appropriateness of current procurement 
methods for each family can be reviewed against the methods appropriate 
to that quadrant.
Example
A manufacturing company has determined that its outsourced logistics and 
supply chain services fall into six main categories:
1	 full vehicle ambient transport;
2	 market distribution transport to customer;
3	 global sea freight services;
4	 global air freight services;

After some discussion, they position each family into the matrix as shown in 
Figure 4.4. One of the outcomes of the discussion was to try to find alterna­
tive suppliers for some of the specialist transport and market distribution 
services where there was currently only a single supplier identified, and that 
fell in the ‘sourcing management’ quadrant. It was recognized that the secu­
rity and development of the single national distribution centre was key and 
that the current supplier might not be the right partner for the joint develop­
ment of after-care services.
Global air and sea freight services had high spend and criticality in ser­
vice for the company and needed to be tendered regularly.

4.7  Maturity models
Introduction
The general purpose of a maturity model is to enable users to position them­
selves in terms of the level of advancement, or ‘maturity’, of the function or 
activity under consideration and thus to determine what to do next to seek 
improvement towards some kind of ideal or high-performing function or 
activity. Typically maturity is described at four or five levels, from low per­
forming to high, but any number of levels can be included (see Figure 4.5).
There is a good parallel between a maturity model for the logistics and 
supply chain function and the four ‘stages in the evolution of manufactur­
ing’s strategic role’ proposed by Hayes and Wheelwright (1984, 1985). At 
the lowest level of contribution to the business, they describe the manufac­
turing function as being ‘internally neutral’ where it is reactive and requires 
outside assistance to make strategic decisions. Looking outside the business, 
it can move to the next level of performance and become ‘externally neutral’ 
by adopting industry best practices. The next level, ‘internally supportive’, is 
achieved by ensuring that manufacturing strategy is developed from, and 
supports, the business strategy. The highest level, ‘externally supportive’, is 
achieved when manufacturing has a level of innovation in processes and 
technologies such that it is involved in major marketing and engineering 
decisions.

Maturity models have thus been created for many purposes and many dif­
ferent activities. They are particularly useful in logistics and supply chain 
management, as some companies still have a long way to evolve in terms of 
supply chain management while others have developed significantly in the 
last couple of decades. A maturity model enables a company to create a 
‘route map’ for improvement to best performance.
A maturity model can be created for any ‘pillar’ of supply chain manage­
ment, e.g. inventory management, warehouse management (see maturity 
scan for warehouse management in tool 1.21), information systems, trans­
port or procurement, or an integrated model can be created to communicate 
overall direction.
When to use
A maturity model is a tool for determining strategy for the development of 
a function leading to improvement of the business. A functional workshop 
can be used to set up the first maturity model and thereafter it can be the 
basis of an annual review to discuss progress, how the model should be fur­
ther developed to explain the long-term direction and agree on how the 
priorities for the next two to three years will be delivered.
How to use
Two approaches can be taken. The first is to task a manager with searching 
the literature for all existing models, selecting desired characteristics and 
then creating an initial model, perhaps with some alternatives at each stage. 
The second approach is to use the concept to develop a shared vision of how 
supply chain management should develop in your business, by means of a 
facilitated workshop involving all those concerned with the high perfor­
mance of the supply chain. This might include, for example, representatives 
from marketing, the customer service function, accounting and operations. 
The outcome of the workshop should be an agreed, summarized diagram, 
rather like Figure 4.6, plus an action plan for moving to the next level of 
maturity.
Example
Figure 4.6 shows a simplified example of a general maturity model for sup­
ply chain management.

4.8  Postponement
Introduction
‘Postponement’ is the term applied to the customization of a product at the 
latest possible time. One of the earliest well-documented examples was the 
Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer. Instead of making all the different vari­
ants of the LaserJet printer at the factory, it was decided to produce a ge­
neric printer there, and ship the generic printers to the regional warehouses 
across the world. The final customization and packaging for a particular 
market was carried out at the warehouse. Although this finishing operation 
was slightly more expensive to carry out in the warehouse, the savings in 
transport costs and inventory massively outweighed this small ­disadvantage.
Another famous example is provided by Benetton, the Italian clothing 
group, which delays dyeing of knitted products until orders are received 
from the shops. Similar to HP, just one stock reference is held of each knit­
wear design and this stock may be transformed into a range of SKUs. In 
general, the advantages of postponement are:
●
●having common product and associated processes until a very late stage 
encourages economies of scale, reduces the number of set-ups or 
changeovers required and reduces the amount of product to be managed;
●
●adding variety as late as possible reduces the financial risk of holding 
inventory of less popular variants;
●
●ability to meet rapidly increasing demand for those members of a product 
family that are selling well;
●
●reduced number of SKUs to be managed;
●
●early processes can be standardized, usually leading to advantages in 
processing time and cost.
Products subject to postponement are sometimes called ‘T’ products or 
‘mushroom’ products, to indicate graphically that variety is introduced to­
wards the end of the process.
When to use
When designing a product, or the production process, ask yourself if the 
components or processes that give rise to product variety can be delayed to 
the final stages of production, or even to the point of distribution.

Supply chain management tools
257
How to use
First, consider the importance of product or service variety to your custom­
ers. For those products or services where variety is or could be important, 
consider how and when that variety is introduced.
It requires some imagination to review all the different ways in which 
variety can be introduced later in the sequence of processes rather than ear­
lier, so that the product design and production processes are common for as 
long as possible. This may require a cross-functional team or process design 
review project.
Example
Flat laminated glass for architectural purposes is a ‘sandwich’ of glass and 
vinyl layers and is used in a number of security applications. For example, 
shop windows can be fitted with laminated glass to stop would-be thieves 
from entering the shop. Even though the glass will break under attack, the 
vinyl layer will usually prevent the aspiring robber from gaining access. 
Thicker and more complex ‘sandwiches’ enable the glass to become bullet-
proof, such as is used on high-security delivery van windscreens and side 
windows.
Because of the number of layers involved, thick laminated glass can have 
very many different specifications and it was common at one time to make 
up the ‘sandwich’ for a specific order. In order to use the glass economically, 
the different glass layers were cut to size before layering up the ‘sandwich’. 
However, the complexity of the production process meant that the customer 
would usually see a minimum lead time of at least 24–48 hours before the 
finished product was available.
It was recognized that one way of reducing the lead time to the customer 
would be to have stock sheets of thick laminate available, to a commonly 
accepted specification. Customers requesting thick laminate were offered a 
lead time of several days for their own specification or several hours if they 
accepted the standard specification laminate. On receiving an order for 
standard thick laminate, the stock sheet could be sawn to size and the edges 
finished. The total lead time for these operations was three to four hours. 
Customers were generally happy to pay a premium for speedy delivery.
In this example, two elements caused variety: the laminate specification 
and the dimensions of the product. Both causes were addressed. The

­specification variety was eliminated by encouraging customers to choose a 
­standard specification, with the advantage of greatly reduced lead time, and 
the dimension variety was managed by introducing the variety at a much 
later stage in the process – final sawing.
The disadvantage was that stock of expensive product was held. This fi­
nancial risk was minimized by holding a minimum amount of stock of a 
very small number of specifications, but which could nevertheless cover 
more than 50 per cent of applications if the customer was flexible enough to 
accept a slightly different specification.

chain will give rapid results.
4.9  Product Flow Path Design, by Fortna
Introduction
Product Flow Path Design, introduced by Fortna, defines the most cost-effi­
cient and service-effective routes by which to move products from suppliers 
to customers. It provides a strategy, a business case and a prioritized road 
map for moving forward. It is seen as the critical link in the distribution 
network strategy cycle (see Figure 4.7).
To execute the Product Flow Path Design (PFPD), an important question 
often is: ‘How many facilities do you need and where should they be?’ 
Ideally, this is answered through a network optimization analysis. Network

optimization takes an in-depth look into the estimated freight costs associ­
ated with alternative distribution facility locations.
Most often, a commercial software tool is used that has an optimization 
algorithm that essentially functions like a linear programming model to de­
termine the minimum cost of alternative locations and product flows. 
(Examples of companies supplying this software are listed at the end of this 
tool.) It’s a highly data-intensive and theoretical process requiring trained 
analysts. The most important input is identifying the alternative scenarios 
and flow paths to analyse. Rarely do these projects have sufficient time or 
budget to evaluate all the potential flow path scenarios or product segment 
permutations. So, a PFPD avoids sub-optimizing your study by providing a 
prioritized set of alternatives to evaluate.
The resulting network optimization analysis following PFPD is valuable 
input to the broader and more comprehensive requirements of a distribution 
network strategy. A distribution network strategy includes inventory de­
ployment planning, service capability definition across channels, systems 
planning and detailed financial budgeting. It is also based on practical con­
straints and considerations such as the availability of resources and logistics 
partners to execute and maintain the strategy.
Because all businesses change over time, the network strategy needs to be 
periodically re-evaluated. This need creates a loop back to PFPD.
A PFPD aims to answer three strategic questions:
1	 What are the most effective and efficient methods (balancing cost and 
service) to flow unique product groupings from suppliers to customers or 
stores?
2	 What is the impact of the recommended product flow paths on existing 
operations (near and longer term)?
3	 What is the supporting business case and migration plan to support the 
recommended changes?
Recommended tasks and deliverables from this effort are outlined in 
Figure 4.8.
The result can be a myriad of alternative flow paths depending on prod­
uct attributes, source, lead times and destinations. These can include direct 
shipments, global distribution centres, national distribution centres, regional 
centres, cross-docking and consolidation centres, local warehouses or a

combination of the above. It is crucial, therefore, to produce a more man­
ageable set of alternatives to evaluate. A sensible approach is to:
●
●apply deductive reasoning in developing a set of hypotheses for the 
potential future supply chain;
●
●allow business priorities to dictate where to focus your analysis;
●
●create a set of logical product segments by which to assess alternative 
flow paths;
●
●develop and use a financial model to compare the impact and sensitivity 
of each hypothesis versus your current operation, which becomes the 
baseline.
PFPD takes a holistic view of supply chain assets, service levels, cost to serve, 
profits and investments. The idea is to think outside the box, look beyond 
what you’ve done in the past, improve on benchmarked results, define the 
possibilities and evaluate what is practical.

4.10  SCOR®
Introduction
The Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR®) model is a product of the 
Supply Chain Council (SCC), which merged with APICS, now called the 
Association for Supply Chain Management (ASCM). The SCOR® model is 
a framework that links business process, metrics, best practices and technol­
ogy features together into a unified structure to support communication 
between supply chain partners. It assists companies in improving the effec­
tiveness of their supply chain management and related supply chain im­
provement activities.

Supply chain management tools
263
SCOR® identifies five core supply chain performance attributes: reliabil­
ity, responsiveness, agility, costs and asset management. Consideration of 
these attributes makes it possible to compare an organization that strategi­
cally chooses to be the low-cost provider against an organization that 
chooses to compete on reliability and performance.
Membership of ASCM is open to all companies and organizations inter­
ested in applying and advancing state-of-the-art supply chain management 
systems and practices. Member companies pay an annual fee to become in­
volved and have access to:
●
●frameworks, benchmarking, templates and other resources developed 
from ongoing research efforts;
●
●professional development via training and certification programmes;
●
●networking via peer events and online portals.
Members include manufacturers, distributors, retailers and service provid­
ers as well as technology solution providers, business consultants, academic 
institutions and government organizations.
When to use
SCOR® is typically used to identify, measure, reorganize and improve supply 
chain processes.
How to use
SCOR® works through a cyclic process of:
●
●Capturing the configuration of a supply chain, which is driven by:
–– plan: levels of aggregation and information sources;
–– source: locations and products;
–– make: production sites and methods;
–– deliver: channels, inventory deployment and products;
–– return: locations and methods;
–– enable: manage the supply chain.

●
●Measuring the performance of the supply chain and comparing against 
internal and external industry goals. Supply chain performance is 
focused on:
–– reliability: achievement of customer demand fulfilment on time, 
complete, without damage, etc;
–– responsiveness: the time it takes to react to and fulfil customer 
demand;
–– agility: the ability of the supply chain to increase/decrease demand 
within a given planned period;
–– cost: objective assessment of all components of supply chain cost;
–– assets: the assessment of all resources used to fulfil customer demand.
●
●Realigning supply chain processes and best practices to fulfil unachieved, 
or changing, business objectives. This realignment is achieved through a 
combination of:
–– classic process re-engineering from ‘as-is’ to ‘to-be’;
–– lean manufacturing analysis and process change;
–– Six-Sigma analysis of defective processes;
–– theory of constraints analysis of systems or processes to elucidate 
root-cause issues;
–– ISO-9000-style process capture and control;
–– Balanced SCOR® cards and benchmarking;
–– a host of other combined industrial-engineering-based best-practice 
techniques in improvement.
The SCOR® process reference model contains:
●
●Performance metrics: standard metrics to measure process performance. 
There is a suite of key performance indicators but first-line metrics 
include:
–– the perfect order: on time, in full, damage free and complete 
document accuracy;
–– order fulfilment cycle time;
–– supply chain flexibility;
–– supply chain management cost;
–– cash to cash cycle time;
–– total cost to serve.

Supply chain management tools
265
●
●Processes: standard descriptions of management processes and a 
framework of process relationships.
●
●Practices: management practices that produce best-in-class performance; 
they help companies:
–– Standardize processes: what is our standard way of operating this 
part/aspect of supply chains?
–– Identify alternative ways of operating the supply chain: how can we 
organize the process differently to address performance gaps?
–– Formulate a wish list of process configurations/automation.
–– Formulate a blacklist of undesired (move-away-from) process 
configurations.
●
●People: training and skills requirements aligned with processes, best 
practices and metrics.
Example
One of the success stories of SCOR® implementation is the use of this meth­
odology by Siemens Medical Solutions for their ‘computed topography’ de­
vices. These medical devices are made to order in Germany and China for 
customers all over the world. Several hundred employees were organized in 
teams for the project. Although the original aim of the project was to move 
supply chain processes to an e-business environment, there were stunning 
results in the supply chain itself. Delivery time was reduced from 22 to 2 
weeks, costs were reduced by 30 per cent, and inventory reduced by 60 per 
cent.

4.11  Supplier relationships
Introduction
An important component of the inbound side of supply chain manage­
ment – supply management – is the development of an appropriate relation­
ship with each supplier. Kraljic’s matrix (see tool 4.6) gives guidance on an 
overall approach to the procurement of different items according to the 
complexity of the supply market and the strategic importance of the item. In 
recent years, a lot more effort has been focused on identifying different 
kinds of relationships that may exist with suppliers and when each type of 
relationship is appropriate.
At one time the focus was on ‘partnerships’, a word that was much used – 
and abused. One useful classification is given by Lambert et al (1996), where 
they see a progression of relationships from ‘arm’s length’ transactions, 
through three levels of partnership to joint ventures and finally, vertical in­
tegration. Rather than use the word ‘partner’, some companies identify ‘pre­
ferred’ or ‘principal’ suppliers, to indicate a relationship that is closer than 
‘arm’s length’.
When to use
It is worth carrying out an annual review of the supplier base, looking at 
those suppliers that represent the top 80 per cent of spend. These are the key 
suppliers and a closer relationship with them can bring significant advan­
tages. Stock and Lambert (2001) make the point that partnership is not a 
requirement for business success but not having a partnership where one is 
appropriate wastes the opportunity for competitive advantage. It is there­
fore useful to review the nature of the relationship with these key suppliers 
against the list of criteria below and consider whether there is any benefit in 
moving towards a closer relationship with any of them, and what this would 
entail.
How to use
Many companies recognize the advantages of closer links with their key 
suppliers. In purely economic terms, better understanding of how the other 
party works can save a lot of time and energy when placing and monitoring 
orders, or when sorting out problems. However, there can also be significant

advantage in involving the supplier in new product development projects, or 
sharing plans regarding future demand and promotions (see CPFR® for ex­
ample, tool 4.2).
Looking at the Kraljic matrix again, one can allocate a type of supplier 
relationship according to the matrix quadrant (see Figure 4.9). To be more 
specific, the following points indicate some of the dimensions that can con­
stitute the relationship:
●
●Giving information about production schedules to suppliers – the more 
they know about your exact requirements, the more likely they are to 
fulfil them on time and in full.
●
●Number of people in each business interacting with one another – the 
closer the relationship and the longer that it has been in existence, the 
more points of contact there are likely to be.
●
●How problems are resolved – fast resolution by joint discussion and 
investigation (looking after the final customer first) is preferable to 
reading the fine print of the contract to apportion blame.
●
●Date of termination of relationship – the closer the relationship, the less 
likely there is to be an envisaged termination date.
●
●Meetings to discuss how to work better together – members of both 
companies come together in a workshop to discuss how to streamline the 
ordering/delivery processes.

●
●Level of management effort required to maintain an expected level of 
supplier performance – close and healthy relationships are based on high 
levels of performance as well as trust.
●
●Involvement in new product design – suppliers in close relationships are 
consulted and involved in new projects, to engage their experience and 
innovations.
Finally, it is worth remembering that ‘partnerships’ are rarely built on the 
first meeting. It usually takes time and experience of working together for 
two organizations to achieve the level of trust and confidence required to 
make a partnership work.
Example
In 2008, Airbus signed a major contract with Kuehne and Nagel to manage 
and operate Airbus’s logistics hubs in Germany, France, the UK and Spain. 
Although Kuehne and Nagel started by operating the existing warehouse 
facilities, the agreement foresaw Kuehne and Nagel consolidating the storage 
requirements and rationalizing the delivery network across Europe. Kuehne 
and Nagel had been working with Airbus since 2003, so both companies had 
had the opportunity to understand one another’s needs and operations be­
fore Kuehne and Nagel were appointed ‘lead logistics provider’ for a signifi­
cant contract period.

mitigation and contingency planning (tool 4.13) describes the risks to mon­
itor and what to do when things go wrong. This tool brings the other sec­
tions together to create a supply chain risk management framework, based 
on a simplified version of failure mode effect and criticality analysis 
(FMECA), the methodology developed by NASA to eliminate the chance of 
a potential failure or mitigate its impact should it occur.
When to use
The first risk management plan can be set up at any time: the sooner the 
better! After this, it is highly recommended that an annual review takes 
place. An important event, such as a major contract or concern about a 
critical supplier or customer, could trigger a review of the plan before the 
anniversary review.
How to use
The overall approach is as follows:
1	 Brainstorm the potential things that could go wrong at each stage of your 
supply chain, working systematically through the supply side, your 
operations, outbound side, customers and general business environment.
2	 For each potential failure, use the SLD matrix in Figure 4.10 to award 
levels of severity of impact (S), likelihood of occurrence (L) and chance of 
detecting the failure before it occurs (D).
3	 For each potential failure, calculate the criticality number (CN) from the 
product of S, L and D. Thus CN = S × L × D (thus CN will be a minimum 
of 1, maximum of 125).
4	 Rank the potential failures in order of criticality, largest first.
5	 Going down the list of potential failures in turn, starting with the highest 
CN, brainstorm ways of eliminating the risk. For each potential solution, 
estimate the cost of implementation and the practicality of the solution in 
eliminating the potential failure. For each potential solution, reassess the 
SLD values, find their product, and use this as an estimate of ‘residual risk’.
6	 If the risk cannot be eliminated, what mitigating actions can be taken to 
reduce the impact if failure occurs? For each potential solution, estimate 
the cost of implementation and the practicality of the solution in mitigating 
the potential failure. For each potential solution, reassess the SLD values, 
find their product, and use this as an estimate of ‘residual risk’.

7	 From all the solutions proposed for elimination or mitigation, choose the 
solution that gives an acceptable reduction in risk for an acceptable cost 
to implement. Include this in an action plan, showing clear responsibilities 
for implementation and the target completion time.
8	 Record the solution implemented and the residual risk.
9	 Continue to monitor risks and review the plan periodically.
Example
A country in Africa was evaluating the idea of using container-based fuel 
stations for distributing fuel more widely across the country, in particular to 
rural areas. A specially designed 40-foot container would house two pumps, 
a supply of diesel and a supply of petrol. When the fuel supplies were ex­
hausted, the whole container would be replaced by a full one.
Table 4.3 shows the beginning of the risk assessment, with the identifica­
tion of potential problems and their CN ranking. Table 4.4 shows some of 
the potential solutions, and residual risk.

It can be seen that location of the containers was thought to be critical in 
reducing their exposure to bad driving. Once located, however, only some 
kind of mechanical barrier would prevent a vehicle impacting the container, 
and a surrounding fence was believed to be the best solution. Unfortunately, 
this was expensive and needed a higher-level decision.
Meanwhile, it was decided to locate a manned cabin with a telephone to 
address the other potential problems. Placing equipment on site capable of 
handling leaks or fires is a mitigation measure in case the failure occurs.
The overall idea of using containers to deliver and dispense fuel in remote 
areas was believed to be feasible enough for further evaluation.

textbook on total productive maintenance.

4.13  Supply chain risk mitigation 
and contingency planning
Introduction
According to SCOR®:
supply chain risk management is the systematic identification, assessment, and 
mitigation of potential disruptions in logistic networks with the objective of 
reducing their negative impact on the logistic network’s performance. Potential 
disruptions can occur either within the supply chain (e.g. insufficient quality, 
unreliable suppliers, machine breakdown, uncertain demand, etc) or outside the 
supply chain (e.g. flooding, terrorism, labour strikes, natural disasters, etc).

Both are considered in an integral multi-phase approach for supply chain 
risk mitigation and contingency planning. SCOR® best practice suggests un­
dertaking the following:
●
●Establish context: define and document the objective and scope (internal 
and external) for managing risk.
●
●Identify risk: collect and document all potential risk events that may 
impact the organization and prevent it from meeting its goals.
●
●Assess risk: collect and document for each potential risk the causes, 
probability and consequences (understand the value at risk).
●
●Evaluate risk: prioritize risks, determine for each risk whether mitigation 
actions are required or the risk is acceptable.
●
●Mitigate risk: determine the actions required to eliminate, reduce, or 
accept and monitor the risks (risk mitigation plan).
●
●Monitor risk: continuously monitor effectiveness of mitigation plans; 
identify emerging risks and changes in internal and external context.
A 10-step plan to avoid or minimize disruption in the supply chain has been 
put forward by JP Morgan Chase; this is an adaptation:
1	 Undertake regular risk assessments – identify areas of concern:
●
●Political and labour issues.
●
●Physical and geographical risks such as weather.
●
●Market conditions.
●
●Oil prices.
●
●Currency fluctuation.
●
●Inflation.
2	 Create a response team:
●
●Create an empowered group responsible for decision making during 
an emergency and communicate their actions throughout the supply 
chain.
●
●Ensure they have suitable competencies.
●
●Ensure access to communication lines.
●
●Both suppliers and customers have to be informed.
●
●Ensure you have trained staff to deal with the media.
3	 Produce a contingency plan:
●
●Ensure that your suppliers also have a workable and realistic 
contingency plan.

Supply chain management tools
275
●
●List details of emergency services.
●
●List details of providers of agency labour.
4	 Give yourselves options:
●
●Establish and maintain relationships with alternative suppliers and 
logistics networks.
●
●Use multiple shippers, forwarders, ports and transport modes.
●
●Alternative power sources.
5	 Test the contingency plan regularly:
●
●Review and update regularly.
●
●Run potential scenarios.
6	 Keep documentation and information up to date:
●
●Ensure that telephone numbers and email addresses are up to date.
7	 Continue to track and be aware of current events likely to impact your 
supply chain:
●
●Weather patterns.
●
●Political unrest.
●
●Labour unrest.
●
●Labour shortages.
●
●Market conditions.
●
●Raw material shortages.
●
●Natural disasters, earthquakes, floods, volcanic eruptions.
●
●Terror attacks.
●
●Major fires.
8	 Introduce cross-training:
●
●Develop a flexible workforce that can react quickly.
●
●Ensure staff have a cross-section of skills and abilities.
9	 Save time and avoid congestion:
●
●Utilize quieter shipping routes.
●
●Move product away from ports quicker.
10	 Back up and save all documentation:
●
●Ensure that this is done daily and stored off site electronically.

4.14  Sustainable sourcing
Introduction
As natural resources become scarcer and as companies want to extend their 
level of corporate social responsibility (CSR) back up the supply chain, sus­
tainable sourcing is becoming more and more important in procurement.
Companies that are most closely involved are those that use natural ma­
terials directly in their product, for example palm oil, coffee beans or timber. 
Sustainable sourcing aims to ensure that the plantations and farms that pro­
duce these natural materials are managing their land and other natural re­
sources in such a manner as to ensure that production can continue in the 
long term by putting as much back into the environment as is being taken 
out of it. For example, this includes replanting areas that have been har­
vested, managing water use and treating all waste products before releasing 
them back into the environment. Fair pay for the workforce and appropri­
ate training, working conditions and contracts are increasingly part of the 
evaluation.
Beyond the purchase of these natural resources, all companies that buy 
goods and services can still implement sustainable sourcing, focusing on the 
carbon footprint (see tool 2.2) and overall environmental impact of the pro­
cesses of their suppliers: use of energy, use of water, treatment of waste, 
packaging materials, etc. Note that sustainable sourcing will not be credible 
unless your company is also making clear progress to sustainability itself.
When to use
Sustainable sourcing is a policy that must be agreed and supported by top-
level management. Having decided how to approach this, the procurement 
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

Supply chain management tools
277
function will review the existing supply base for sustainable practices and 
will be looking for commitment from all new suppliers.
How to use
Once top-level commitment has been obtained, the procurement function 
will be asked to develop a company policy and then implement it. A good 
approach is to assemble an internal working party made up of interested 
members of different functions, including accounting and finance, market­
ing, operations and supply chain. Even though the focus will be on sustain­
able sourcing, information will be required from different functions. There 
will also be implications for different user functions and a learning process 
for the whole business to improve the sustainability of their own practices.
The first task of the group will be to choose a focus area as a starting 
point. This could be one family of items or services and could be, for 
­example:
●
●transport services;
●
●energy or water supplies;
●
●cleaning services;
●
●raw materials;
●
●components;
●
●equipment – taking a lifecycle viewpoint of the next purchase.
In general, it is a good idea to start with products where there is a clear en­
vironmental link, such as paper or food, or products where there could be 
high potential for cost savings over their lifetime, e.g. high-energy-consum­
ing products. The first family will be used as a learning process, specifically 
to answer questions such as:
●
●What criteria will be used to assess sustainability in this case?
●
●How will sustainability be measured?
●
●What are the associated costs or risks?
●
●To what extent do suppliers meet the new requirements already?
●
●Will there be any kind of consultation process with key suppliers?
●
●How will suppliers be informed, e.g. next invitation to tender, quarterly 
communication?
●
●How will potential or new suppliers be informed about the new company 
policy?
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
278
●
●How can we help or support suppliers in their adoption of sustainable 
practices?
●
●How important are we to these suppliers? To what extent can we influence 
their sustainability programme?
●
●How will the success of our policy be measured?
●
●How will we react if a supplier is not interested or pays only lip service 
to our proposals?
It is always useful on a new project such as this to encourage the group 
members to carry out background research and provide summaries of their 
reading or visits to other members of the working party. This will suit some 
people more than others, but doing the underpinning research is essential 
education for the whole group. The main UK professional institutions are a 
good source of information, as well as a growing body of accessible books 
on the subject (e.g. Emmett and Sood, 2010).
Example
A high-profile sustainability programme was launched by Marks & Spencer 
in 2007. Known as ‘Plan A’ (there was no plan B), the project involved sup­
pliers, customers and employees and covered the use of sustainable raw 
materials, environmental impact of the stores, e.g. energy and water use, 
waste, carbon footprint in distribution, healthy lifestyle and the final desti­
nation of its products. Its commitment has been unwavering and has brought 
many benefits for all concerned. More information, including the annual 
sustainability report which shows the progress that has been made, is avail­
able on the website: https://corporate.marksandspencer.com/sustainability

4.15  Theory of constraints
Introduction
Eli Goldratt developed the ‘theory of constraints’ in the 1980s. Following on 
from his work on factory scheduling by starting scheduling from the bot­
tleneck resource (Goldratt and Cox, 1984), the theory of constraints 
(Goldratt, 1990) was developed as a more general approach to improving 
business performance.
There have been many approaches to business performance improve­
ment, but the theory of constraints is particularly relevant to supply chain 
management because one of its major pillars is reduction of inventory. A 
major outcome of applying the theory of constraints is improved flow 
through a resource or series of resources, which is also an objective of sup­
ply chain management.
Goldratt (1990) argues that there are only three ways to improve busi­
ness performance:
1	 Improve ‘throughput’, that is the rate at which saleable goods are output 
and can therefore generate revenue.
2	 Reduce ‘inventory’ (for the same throughput), where inventory includes 
fixed assets as well as materials.
3	 Reduce ‘operating expense’, which includes overheads and operating 
capital.
Crucially, this improvement process must be continuous (not just a quick 
fix), and also must involve everybody in the organization.
When to use
The theory of constraints can be used as the process for a business or supply 
chain improvement project. It is more suited to an ongoing improvement 
process than radical supply chain redesign.

How to use
The theory of constraints is an approach to business improvement that has 
captured the imagination of some managers. Through training, and often 
the involvement of an external change agent such as a consultant, these 
managers will lead business improvement projects. Advocates claim that it 
is a flexible method that can be used to attack almost any business problem 
effectively.
Goldratt (1990) outlines the main steps in the process of improvement 
using the theory of constraints:
Step 1: Identify the system’s constraints. A constraint is anything that is 
preventing the organization from achieving its business development 
goals. Usually there are just three or four key constraints preventing the 
system from performing better. In general terms, these can be, for example, 
capacity, product quality or lead time.
Step 2: Having identified the system’s constraints, there is no point in the 
non-constraining resources operating independently and at a higher 
performance level than the level at which the constraints will allow the 
whole system to operate. Thus the non-constraint resources should serve 
and supply the constraint resources. The second step is to identify how 
this can be done.
Step 3: Having identified how the non-constraint resources can serve and 
supply the constraint resources, the constraint resources take priority 
from now on, and all decisions regarding non-constraint resources are 
secondary to decisions and actions involving the constraints.
Step 4: Now is the time to consider how to ‘break’ the constraint by doing 
something about it, by making some improvement to the system. In the 
examples in step 1, solutions to a capacity problem might include working 
an extra shift or reducing downtime on a piece of equipment, whereas 
solutions to a product quality problem might include redesigning the 
product, refurbishing a piece of equipment or training operators in 
problem solving to identify and improve process quality themselves. 
Solutions to a lead-time problem might include reducing set-up times and 
batch sizes or increasing capacity.
Step 5: Clearly, if a constraint in one area or activity has been eased, then 
another area or activity becomes a constraint. Thus improvement is an 
ongoing process of identifying the next constraint and tackling it using 
the same steps. Thus we return to step 1.

Example
Case studies of successful implementations are available on the Goldratt 
Institute’s website (see www.goldratt.com). Nike reports improving stock 
turns of socks from 2.3 to 7 within four months, and later to around 10, 
using the theory of constraints. Nike says that it did not change its IT sys­
tems or improve its forecasting but simply focused on the link between man­
ufacturing and distribution. It was also able to reduce warehousing costs by 
$2 million per year and increase sales by 40 per cent during the peak season.
Reports from other companies are equally impressive and include im­
provements in on-time delivery, inventory reductions, increases in sales and 
reduced operating expense. The Goal, written by Goldratt, is certainly one 
of the most informative business books we have read and we recommend it 
as simple to understand and easy to read.

4.16  Value stream mapping
Introduction
The purpose of value stream mapping (VSM) is to understand which parts 
of the existing supply chain add value and which parts do not. Analysis of 
the existing supply chain encourages us to think about how the stages could 
work better and therefore enables us to map how the chain should work – 
the ideal future state. The task is then to create an action plan to move from 
the existing state to the ideal future state. Physical movement of components 
and products is mapped as well as information flow.
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
282
It is important to set the scope of the map. Ideally, it should go from raw 
materials through to the final customer, so it may be useful to involve critical 
suppliers and major customers to ensure cohesion and smooth flow along 
the chain. Areas which appear to block or slow down the flow should be 
investigated in more detail.
When to use
Value stream mapping is a good tool to use with a group of employees from 
one area. Facilitating the group to create the map provides an interesting 
activity in which everybody can participate and think about how the pro­
cesses can be improved.
Value stream mapping is often used as part of a Lean Management intro­
duction.
How to use
Total throughput time is made up of four components: waiting time, change­
over time, cycle time and move time to the next operation. Only cycle time 
is value-adding time. Value-adding time is frequently just a small proportion 
of throughput time. The overall objective is to understand why this is and 
what can be done to increase the proportion of value-adding time. This may 
need radical change to the processes.
There are many variants of supply chain mapping and just one example 
is shown in Figure 4.11 and Figure 4.12 described below.
Example
Figure 4.11 shows the main stages in making a small electrical product. 
Currently, the product is made in batches of 50. The value stream map 
clearly shows that each product must wait for all the other units in the batch 
to be completed before the batch can move to the next operation. However, 
it is often necessary to change the set-up for another product. Thus, it is only 
possible to reduce the batch size if the set-up or changeover time can be re­
duced. Average waiting times between operations are also shown.
The current total value-adding time per unit is 5 + 9 + 2 + 1 minutes = 17 
minutes.

However, in the worst case, where each workstation needs a changeover, the 
total throughput time could be (255 + 5) + (486 + 9) + (108 +2) + (69 + 1) = 
935 minutes. This means over 15 hours of lead time for 17 minutes of value-
adding time!
The value stream map in Figure 4.11 also shows the total imbalance be­
tween the work rate of the different stations. Under Lean, the Takt time 
(time between successive completions, see further information) determines 
the rate of work of each workstation, according to the rate of customer 
­demand.
In order to help define a future state, the Takt time is determined to be 5 
minutes. Unit assembly stage 2 will either need an improved process or two 
workstations to achieve this. The workstations ‘inspect and test’ and ‘pack’ 
could be combined.
The ideal future state would be a batch of 1 but this is not feasible until 
the changeover time can be eliminated. It is decided that a feasible target is 
a batch size of 10 and halved changeover times. Figure 4.12 shows the fu­
ture state based on these criteria. If the line produces to this rhythm, then 
waiting times between stations should be eliminated or negligible.
The new total cycle time is 5 + 5 + 3 minutes = 13 minutes.
The new total throughput time is (50+5) + (58+5) + (27+3) = 148 ­minutes.
The total throughput time is now just under three hours, reducing the 
level of work in progress and increasing reactivity to changing demand.

4.17  Demand-driven MRP (DDMRP)
Introduction
Demand-driven MRP (DDMRP) has been developed from a combination of 
methodologies – MRP, periodic replenishment inventory management, Lean

and Goldratt’s theory of constraints. It aims to overcome the main limita­
tions of MRP and provide a more flexible response to changing demand.
The main purpose is to protect internal operations from variability in the 
external environment such as unreliable suppliers and changing customer 
demand, while buffering against potential difficulties in the internal envi­
ronment such as bottlenecks.
Several sections of this book provide understanding of the basic compo­
nents of DDMRP (tool 3.6 on strategic positioning of inventory, tool 3.8 on 
periodic review inventory management and tool 3.13 on material require­
ments planning).
When to use
DDMRP can be used for planning the supply of manufactured products and 
retail products.
How to use
Software is required, usually as part of an enterprise resource planning 
(ERP) system. Its methodology is best demonstrated by an example. We will 
use the same example as that presented in tool 3.13 on MRP, the office chair.
There are five stages which will be treated in turn in the example:
1	 Determine where inventory should be strategically positioned.
2	 Set buffer profiles and levels.
3	 Make dynamic adjustments to buffer levels.
4	 Carry out demand-driven planning.
5	 Execute the plan in a visible and collaborative manner.
Example
1.  Determine where inventory should be strategically 
positioned (see tool 3.6)
In our example, wheels are considered to be a critical component subject to 
unreliable supply. There is a plate between the seat and the lifting mecha­
nism which is made in-house but this operation is carried out where there is 
a machine bottleneck and so stockholding is required. The finished goods 
stock of office chairs must be protected against variability in demand. The

total cumulative production and procurement lead time is determined by the 
seat lifting mechanism and so a four-day buffer stock of lifting mechanisms 
will be maintained to reduce the total lead time to six days (five days re­
maining procurement + one day for final assembly).
Decoupling stocks will be put in place at each of these positions.
2.  Set buffer profiles and levels
Buffer inventories in DDMRP have three zones called green, yellow and red, 
which enable rapid visual monitoring of their state, where green means all is 
well (no action required), yellow means that an open order should exist (if 
not then raise one) and red means that rapid corrective action is required.
Here is the basic data for the four buffers of our office chair:
We calculate the size of each buffer in turn, starting with yellow. The yellow 
zone represents cycle stock, the inventory that is normally used during the 
delivery lead time of the replenishment.
Yellow zone size = average daily usage rate (ADU) × decoupled lead time (DLT)

Then we calculate the red zone which mitigates two kinds of risk. The lead 
time factor mitigates against the higher risk associated with shorter lead 
times and a variability factor which mitigates against variability in the lead 
time associated with transport or supplier reliability.

The impact of these values is to increase the size of the inventory by adding 
safety stock.
Red zone base = yellow × lead time factor = ADU × DLT × LF
Red zone safety = red zone base × variability factor = ADU × DLT × LF × VF
Finally, we calculate the size of the green buffer.
Green zone = maximum of {min OQ, ADU × DLT × LF, DOC × ADU}

This adds usage until the next replenishment order is raised (whereas the 
yellow zone covers usage during the delivery lead time) where DOC = de­
sired order cycle (review period).
We talk about ‘top of’ each buffer section in order to get a visual image 
of the buffer stocks.
Top of red = red base + red safety
Top of yellow = top of red + yellow buffer

3.  Dynamic adjustments to buffer levels
It is important to review buffer levels frequently as circumstances change – 
for example, seasonal products, increasing or decreasing demand trend, 
short-term shortages or transport difficulties. Thus the values of all the fac­
tors involved in the calculations are reviewed periodically.
4.  Demand-driven planning
Office chairs will now be sold from stock according to actual demand. As 
soon as the stock level falls below 435 into the yellow zone, a replenishment 
order will be generated. The replenishment order will arrive in six days 
­according to the new maximum lead time in the BOM due to the stock of 
lifting mechanisms.
The MRP process is followed as before, except for the lifting mechanism, 
plates and wheels. The stocks of office chairs, lifting mechanisms, plates and 
wheels are monitored daily and action is taken accordingly.
If the stock level is in the green zone, no action is taken.
If the stock level is in the yellow zone, check that a replenishment order has 
been raised.
If the stock level is in the red zone, urgent expediting action is required.
5. Execute the plan in a visible and collaborative manner.
It can be seen from step 4 that the colour-coded inventory levels are very 
helpful for rapid evaluation of any action required.
These visible stock levels can be communicated to suppliers and partners.

4.18  Calculating ordering cost
Introduction
Historically, knowledge of the ordering cost enabled some ‘ideal’ purchase 
quantity to be defined that minimized the total cost of stockholding and 
replenishment (see tool 3.11). Typically, ‘ordering cost’ was the total cost of 
replenishment, i.e. procurement, transport, goods receiving and inspection, 
and costs associated with returns or non-conformance. Today, we separate 
out from general overhead and other catch-all budgets all these supply chain 
costs so that better decisions can be made about movement of product 
through the supply chain. Here, we evaluate the cost of the procurement 
activity only, or average procurement cost per order because it is the most 
complex. The procurement function, like any other function, must look at 
the value it adds to the business against its own operating costs.
The costs of goods receiving and inspection may be taken as the time (e.g. 
hours per week, month or year) spent on these activities multiplied by the 
hourly cost of employment of the person carrying out the task. Reducing the 
need for these activities, for example by making suppliers responsible for 
inspection before shipment, will result in a cost reduction. The costs associ­
ated with returns and non-conformance usually fall to the procurement 
function as they have to resolve the problems.
Procurement cost is also a baseline against which to measure future re­
ductions by means of ‘soft orders’ (electronic), blanket orders, longer con­
tracts, VMI (see tool 3.17), grouping more items to fewer suppliers, etc.
When to use
It is not necessary to calculate procurement cost frequently but it is a useful 
exercise at the beginning of a supply chain management implementation 
project or supply chain cost reduction exercise. Thereafter, it can be re­
viewed every year or two.
Some small and medium-sized businesses outsource procurement to a 
specialist group in order to benefit from greater purchasing power. In this 
case, it is important to understand the internal procurement cost against the 
benefits and costs of external procurement.

How to use
As with any ‘office-based’ activity, the procurement function is embedded in 
the business and the costs of its activities are often divided between an op­
erating budget for direct costs (salaries, expenses) and general overhead for 
indirect costs (telecommunications, IT systems, heating, lighting, etc).
The first stage is to complete Table 4.12 by obtaining as much data as 
possible from the accounting system and then making sensible estimates for

the missing data. For example, heating cost can be estimated by taking the 
floor area occupied by the procurement function as a proportion of the total 
office floor area and using this as the proportion of total office heating cost.
The second stage is to make use of this information by analysing the 
­orders placed:
1	 Calculate average cost per order placed (for use as a future comparator).
2	 Carry out Pareto analysis to understand the spread of order cost and in 
particular the C orders – those 50 per cent of orders that likely account 
for 5 per cent of the total annual value of orders placed.
3	 Carry out Pareto analysis based on number of order lines to find the C 
orders – those 50 per cent that have very few order lines.
4	 Consider how these C orders can be reduced, e.g. by management credit 
cards, VMI, grouping items to fewer suppliers.
5	 Consider the items on the B orders and look at where they are placed on 
the Kraljic matrix (see tool 4.6). Can they be moved to a more regular 
contract or agreement? Can the contract time be extended for some items?
6	 Review the total procurement cost and cost per order.
(Table 4.12 can be downloaded for free as a template from http://howtologistics.
com). In summary, a general expression of ordering cost against quantities 
­delivered will not be obtained (as required for EOQ calculations) but total 
­procurement cost and average cost per order can be useful markers against 
which to measure progress in reducing operational costs during a project to im­
prove supply chain or procurement efficiency.
Further information
Ordering cost is part of acquisition cost. See Burt et al (2003) or any 
comprehensive textbook on procurement or supply management for a 
further discussion: Burt, D N, Dobler, D W and Starling, S L (2003)

4.19  How to calculate stockholding cost
Introduction
Calculating the costs associated with material flow, that is ordering, trans­
port and stockholding costs, is one of the first stages in implementing supply 
chain management. It is essential to know these costs in order to make the

best choice from among the many alternative options for managing procure­
ment, transport, storage and warehousing.
For specialist transport or warehousing operations, it can be easy to ac­
cess these costs. In other cases, they must be carefully separated out from 
overheads or shared facilities’ costs. As a simple example, what is the cost of 
providing hardware, software and support for the computer system in the 
finished goods store of a factory? In this case, perhaps the number of termi­
nals located there as a proportion of all terminals across the site might yield 
a proportion of system cost that could be allocated to the warehouse. This 
is just one element of a multitude of costs that must be added together to 
understand the real cost of holding stock.
When to use
Stockholding cost is part of the first stage of a supply chain management 
project. Recalculation every two to three years should suffice unless there 
are major changes to some of the factors.
How to use
Select a person to do this who is tenacious, capable of searching through 
cost data and making sensible estimates. Complete the template in Table 4.13 
as far as possible and arrive at a total annual cost.

To this must be added the financial investment in the stock and, particularly, 
the loss to the business of having capital tied up in the stock. Some compa­
nies use lost opportunity cost for this; others use the bank interest rate.
Since the loss to the business of the financial value of the stock is usually 
expressed as a percentage of its value, it is common to express total 
­stockholding cost as a percentage of the value of the stock rather than as a 
dollar/pound cost. Both figures are useful. The most important point is that 
a year-on-year reduction is sought, either as a reduction in the stock value 
or the cost of holding stock or both.
Some people say that if you have a warehouse, you might as well fill it! In 
supply chain thinking, we are always trying to reduce the amount of inven­
tory (thus increasing stock turns). If this frees up part of the warehouse, then 
rent out that space to another business and receive some income for it. If 
you are renting the warehouse anyway, move to a smaller one.
Further categories of costs are shown in tool 7.1, activity-based costing. 
(A comprehensive table can be downloaded for free as a template from 
http://howtologistics.com)

A good description of the elements of stockholding cost can be found in 
any good textbook on supply chain management, logistics or 
warehousing, for example: Stock, J R and Lambert, D M (2001)

4.20  Sales and operations planning (S&OP)
Introduction
For many people, S&OP is just a module in the enterprise resource planning 
(ERP) system or a process to balance future demand and supply but research 
into top-performing companies has shown that a good S&OP process is an 
important element of supply chain and business success. On a rolling basis, 
S&OP provides a continuously renewed coherent plan that is created jointly 
and followed by the supply functions (procurement and production) 
and ­demand (sales and distribution) functions. The plan states how much 
will be produced and sold over the coming months. Involving the finance

department gives confidence that the plan is feasible, and that the cash and 
profit implications are understood. The critical success factor is that all 
functions involved take ownership of the plan and contribute to its mainte­
nance and execution. In large companies with multiple sites, product fami­
lies and markets, S&OP may be carried out at site level as well as at regional 
and corporate levels. Achieving a good balance between sales and produc­
tion ensures that customer demands are met with minimum inventory and 
greatest production efficiency.
Using S&OP for demand and supply balancing is beneficial at the opera­
tional level. However, the S&OP can provide an effective cross-functional 
forum for discussion of future business shape and performance. Conducted 
at the most senior levels, this form of S&OP provides an important tactical 
and strategic vehicle for business management. Sometimes the higher-level 
planning is called integrated business planning, to distinguish it.
Although much of the discussion will be in value terms, the easiest com­
mon currency, quantities are usually expressed per product family in broad 
brush terms, in whatever units have common meaning in the business, e.g. 
tonnes, dollars, square metres, millions of units and so on. Depending on the 
sector, the horizon can be one to five years (ideally 18 months or longer).
Having agreed the plan, it then becomes the basis for more detailed ca­
pacity planning, materials forecasting, the procurement budget, recruitment 
(if necessary), and other plans that ensure that the overall plan is executed.
Some companies with sophisticated information systems are now finding 
it possible to automate parts of the S&OP process. At the simplest level, 
digital technology can help compile reports. Greater levels of analytics can 
automate parts of the process and support decision making. However, de­
spite these capabilities, it is important to recognize the human side of the 
process and that great value comes from constructive dialogue between the 
functions and a shared approach.
When to use
S&OP is necessary when the company’s products are sufficiently complex or 
numerous to warrant a higher-level process than a master production sched­
ule (MPS). However, S&OP can still be valuable in smaller organizations in 
developing a shared business plan and a forward-looking view of the 
­company.

How to use
The following steps are carried out in each monthly cycle:
1	 Supply-side progress against the current plan is monitored using a group 
of key performance indicators (KPIs) including supplier performance, 
procurement expenditure, production volumes, stocks, percentage 
achievement of plan, production costs, etc.
2	 Sales progress against the current plan is monitored using a group of KPIs 
including sales volumes, revenue, percentage achievement of plan, 
delivery achievement to customers, service levels achieved, etc.
3	 The sales function updates the demand forecast and makes this available 
to the production and supply chain functions. Note that good forecast 
accuracy is critical for realistic S&OP (see tools 4.2 and 4.3). Product 
launches, promotions, new market entries or other non-routine events 
are flagged up.
4	 Taking into account projected available inventory in future and safety 
stock requirements, the production function updates the production 
forecast. Major changes in capacity (shutdowns, new/closing facilities, 
etc) are flagged up.
5	 The supply chain function reviews the sourcing requirement and flags up 
any potential problems.
6	 The demand (sales) and supply (procurement and production) forecasts 
are then used as the basis for a number of sub-calculations, carried out 
either by the S&OP module in the ERP system or in Excel, including:
●
●revenue forecast;
●
●production cost forecast;
●
●feasibility of obtaining all parts and materials in time by using macro-
bills of material, i.e. the most critical items due to long lead times or 
other market difficulties;
●
●estimation of the labour workload and the capacity required on the 
most heavily loaded machines by using macro-routings, i.e. operations 
on bottleneck and near-bottleneck workstations;
●
●proposing alternative scenarios if production and supply cannot be 
balanced, for example products may need to be allocated to customers 
or markets if capacity is constrained;
●
●procurement budget forecast and cash flow projections.

7	 Supply chain analytics may be used to spot trends, identify cause and 
effect links and hence enhance the information available during S&OP 
decision making.
8	 An S&OP information pack is created and circulated to the managers of 
the key functions involved. Each manager prepares for the monthly 
S&OP meeting, which may require some extra preparation on potential 
solutions if problems are anticipated. A cover sheet using traffic light 
indicators allows focus on areas that need attention.
9	 The team discusses the results of the sub-calculations and adjustments 
are made until final agreement is reached between all parties on a feasible 
and coherent S&OP. The S&OP is then used as the basis for the MPS. 
Once a management team becomes familiar with the S&OP process, it 
has been found that it is more efficient to focus on exceptions and key 
issues rather than going through every detail of the plan each month.
10	 The team executes the plan and monitors its progress. Any serious 
deviations are investigated and logged for future learning. Thus the cycle 
recommences.
Example
Wacker Polymers (see URL below) has made available a slide set that ex­
plains its S&OP process. The plan covers the next 18 months and is updated 
monthly on a rolling basis. It enables the business strategy to be realized and 
resources to be planned. The plan is expressed in dollar terms and also units.
Using 18-month forecasts, first the demand plan is reviewed, then the 
supply plan. The supply plan is then agreed and used as the basis for the 
revenue forecast, procurement planning, production and distribution plans, 
and financial and sales planning.
In consequence of better S&OP, improvements have been seen in four key 
measures: improved forecast accuracy, improved adherence to production 
schedules, reduction in inventory days of supply (stock cover) and improved 
financial forecast accuracy. The process seems to be working so well that 
S&OP meetings have become boring – a sign of success!

4.21  S&OP self-assessment by Supply Chain 
Movement and Involvation
Introduction
Your objective is a supply chain which is optimally aligned with market 
demand. Hence, sales and operations planning (S&OP) is crucial. But what 
does S&OP really contribute to your company’s performance? Is S&OP 
delivering demonstrable results? To help you discover how well your S&OP 
process is actually functioning, Supply Chain Movement and Involvation 
have developed this practical self-assessment model.
When to use
When you wish to review the S&OP activity in your business.

4.22  Strategic procurement
Introduction
Strategic procurement is the result of major changes to the purchasing func­
tion since the 1990s. The name acknowledges the strategic importance of 
good procurement practices. Depending on the sector, the function is in­
volved in 70–90 per cent of company expenditure (i.e. just about anything 
that is not salaries or depreciation) and a business of any size would do well 
to make sure that its expenditure is funnelled through the procurement 
function as far as possible.
A good proportion of this expenditure is supply-chain-related and effec­
tive procurement is an important element of supply chain management. It is 
critical that supply chain management, and hence procurement, has board-
level representation.
When to use
Many companies can improve their procurement practices and this tool is 
intended to give you some insight into how strategic procurement can help 
your business.
How to use
Use this tool to review the procurement activity in your business. If you 
would like to know more about these ideas, shown in Table 4.16, see the 
further information section.
Example
A procurement professional was appointed to a small business to take over 
all the procurement activity that had previously been handled by the manag­
ing director (MD) and his assistant. The MD made the decisions and the 
assistant executed them. While the MD could claim that company expendi­
ture was being carefully controlled, this did not mean that procurement was 
being handled analytically or in the best long-term interests of the company.
The procurement professional immediately started analysing the item 
catalogue, set up families, identified different purchasing approaches for the

Table 4.16  Some of the best practices that form strategic procurement
What
What is involved
Analysis of 
purchased 
items
Set up families of similar items
Use ABC Pareto analysis to identify items and families in each 
class. Set up appropriate procurement strategy for each item/
family according to its importance, i.e. aim to spend more 
time on the most important or valuable items (see tool 4.6)
Category 
management
Divide up the purchased equipment, services and materials 
into logical ‘categories’, which are then allocated to individual 
procurement professionals. These category managers then 
develop specialist knowledge of the supply market. This is 
particularly useful for centralized procurement of A and B items 
(see below). It also prevents duplication, inefficiency or vendor 
proliferation in large organizations with multiple sites/countries
Supplier 
selection
Set up clear procedures for selecting suppliers depending on 
importance and value of item, involving users where 
appropriate, including technical and quality assessments, 
financial stability, transport options, delivery reliability, ability 
to contribute to new product development
Look at the local, national, regional and worldwide supply 
markets as appropriate
Minimum 
number of 
suppliers
Choose suppliers that the business wants to work with rather 
than the ‘best’ supplier for each individual item. The business 
works to ensure good performance from those suppliers is 
achieved across a wider range of items. A number of different 
functions could be involved as well as procurement, 
e.g. quality, production planning, transport
Supplier status 
range
Suppliers may be approved, preferred, lead, sole supplier etc. 
Set up appropriate supplier relationships (tool 4.11)
Supplier 
management
Provide close or real-time links with suppliers through access 
to extranet, a platform or portal, to share forecast demand, 
order history, recorded delivery performance and in some 
cases actual sales information (e.g. EPOS)
Communication 
with suppliers
Visit suppliers periodically (depending on location and 
importance of supplier), and give them regular feedback 
on performance, e.g.through a platform or portal as above. 
Communication could also include participation in 
joint workshops regarding problem solving, new product 
development, closer cooperation on planning and 
forecasting,etc
(continued )

What
What is involved
Total cost of 
acquisition
In addition to the invoiced amount, take into account the cost 
of transport, cost of rejects, administrative effort required to 
work with this supplier, training, commissioning, 
consumables, etc
Lifetime cost of 
equipment
In addition to the invoiced amount for equipment, take into 
account the installation, commissioning, operating and 
maintenance costs, shipping and packaging, spare parts 
requirements, consumables, training, etc
Cooperation 
with key user 
functions
Remember that procurement ‘serves’ internal users and can 
only do this effectively by being involved as early as possible 
in development projects such as new products, new facilities, 
etc. This may require engaging with user departments to 
explain the role of procurement and the value they add to the 
business
Supply market 
monitoring
Keep up to date with the main players and new developments 
in the supply markets for key items and families
Supply chain 
risk analysis
Carry out periodic risk assessments on key suppliers, major 
items, new projects, etc
Information 
management
Use an appropriate module or package, e.g. SAP Ariba
Centralization 
vs 
decentralization
Use ABC analysis to set policy for centralized or decentralized 
procurement of different items or categories, e.g. centralized 
procurement for A and B items/families and C items where 
aggregated demand across all branches or sites or countries 
makes it worthwhile
Table 4.16  (Continued)
different families, formalized a supplier database and reviewed all purchase 
orders (POs) placed over the previous 12 months. The majority of POs were 
individual transactions, many to the same companies. Supply agreements 
were set up with key suppliers with forecasts of aggregated demand.
After a couple of years of reviewing and renewing the supplier base, the 
purchasing budget had reduced by nearly 15 per cent, supplier performance 
had increased and production shortages significantly reduced (thus reducing 
the amount of time spent on expediting).

As a rule of thumb, we can say that a procurement professional can re­
duce the cost of purchases by about 10 per cent over two years if the ex­
penditure has not yet been analysed methodically. Thereafter, year on year 
reductions of 3–5 per cent can be expected depending on the sector. This is 
not about ‘squeezing’ suppliers nor is it about ‘switching and baiting’. It is 
about choosing good and reliable suppliers, especially for key items, setting 
appropriate working relationships with them, securing supplies where the 
supply market is difficult, working closely and cooperatively with internal 
user functions and involving suppliers in future projects.

4.23  Supply chain strategy, by Julian Amey
Introduction
Twenty years ago, companies developed manufacturing strategies or, in 
some cases, operations strategies. It is now recognized that while manufac­
turing can be an important capability, the company really needs an effective 
supply chain strategy. This recognizes the shift that many companies have

made from being pure ‘manufacturers’ to ones with more complex sourcing 
arrangements and that customers, products and markets are what drive 
company performance. Indeed, certain experts would say that companies 
now compete on their supply chains, necessitating a clear, well-formulated 
and executed supply chain strategy.
The supply chain strategy must be created to support the company’s (or 
business unit’s) strategy and commercial ambition. Developing the supply 
chain strategy requires a clear understanding of customer and market re­
quirements, the products and services that need to be delivered and how the 
company competes and delivers value to its customers.
The strategy must be forward looking. Although it may seek to address 
current performance issues, it must consider the future needs of the com­
pany and the supply chain (e.g.what product launches are required, what 
the cost and cash pressures are, in what markets expansion or contraction 
will occur, how the company’s operating or selling model may need to 
change). This is necessary because of the likely time that it will take for some 
facets of the strategy to be implemented. An effective strategy will install the 
necessary capabilities ahead of their requirement in order to create a leading 
organization.
A supply chain strategy can have many dimensions and areas to address. 
These could include:
●
●Supply chain performance in areas such as customer service and inventory.
●
●Sourcing arrangements and supply chain configuration/re-configuration: 
asset strategy, make vs buy, supply base.
●
●Geographical reach: customer base, supply base, logistics services.
●
●Product portfolio: new product introduction, product divestments, 
product lifecycle-driven changes.
●
●Cost and cash pressures.
●
●People: skills and talent development, recruitment, organization 
development.
●
●Operating model changes: global vs regional vs local, value-adding 
service offerings.
●
●Technology: manufacturing capabilities, technology transfer.
●
●Processes and systems: streamlining or harmonizing processes, 
information management capabilities, digitalization.
●
●Infrastructure.

Supply chain management tools
309
There is the temptation to put too much into the strategy. This should be 
avoided. It is important to be realistic and focus on the crucial elements that 
will deliver the most benefit or the changes most critical to future success. 
Typically, a good strategy should be simple and clear with a number of key 
principles or messages. A simple strategy is easier to communicate and to 
gain buy-in for than a complex one. It is also more likely to be ­implementable.
The strategy should not be seen as a document. To add value, the strategy 
needs to be implemented. This will require good project management and 
communication.
An increasing area of focus for many companies developing supply chain 
strategies is the impact of digital technology on their business and supply 
chains. Some are now considering digital transformation as the next signifi­
cant step that they need to take. New digital approaches can have a funda­
mental impact on the business’s operating model; however, there is also still 
a need to focus on the basics of supply chain processes and people while 
using digital as an important enabler.
When to use
A company should always have a valid and up-to-date supply chain strategy. 
Because of the pace of change of business conditions and competitive envi­
ronments, the strategy should be reviewed at least annually and will prob­
ably require revision every three years, the likely time horizon for implemen­
tation of the previous edition.
How to use
The supply chain strategy must be developed in consultation and collabora­
tion with other functions in the company. Key among these will be:
●
●Research and development – to understand the future product/service 
portfolio and plans for new product introduction.
●
●Sales and marketing – to understand the commercial plans, long-term 
forecasts and geographical ambitions.
●
●Finance – to understand the financial imperatives and constraints (e.g. 
cash flow, profitability, tax).
As part of the strategy’s development, a business case needs to be created 
since the strategy is likely to involve change. Resources will be needed to 
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
310
effect the change. Hence the business case should justify the effort and re­
sources required. A strong financial case will also generate commitment 
within the business towards implementation.
Implementation of the strategy will not happen by accident. Effective 
project management with a clear plan and monitoring steps is essential.
Example: AstraZeneca
Following the merger of the pharmaceutical companies Astra and Zeneca in 
1999, an operations strategy was generated that focused on the immediate 
issues of company integration and the imperative of launching major new 
products. In 2001, the strategy was radically revised to become a supply 
chain strategy that addressed issues of poor customer service and high in­
ventories through:
●
●implementation of lean and demand-driven supply to reduce lead time 
and improve efficiencies to provide capacity headroom for new products 
without major capital investments;
●
●lifecycle management of products;
●
●greater emphasis on outsourcing;
●
●shifting the focus of operations from being a manufacturing organization 
to one focused on customer service and supply.
Implementation of the strategy de-bottlenecked supply of certain products, 
leading to increased sales, reduced inventory by circa $500 million and 
raised customer service levels to >99 per cent. In consequence, operations’ 
reputation was enhanced and it was seen as a great place to work.
Following attrition in the company’s new product portfolio leading to 
absence of the expected product launches and confronted by impending pat­
ent expiries of a number of major brands, in 2006 the strategy was ­revised to:
●
●place more aggressive focus on the continued implementation of lean, 
supporting a continued drive to reduce cost of goods;
●
●full end-to-end supply chain management by organization realignment 
and implementation of advanced planning systems to provide full supply 
chain visibility;
●
●inventory optimization to free up cash for investment in licensing 
opportunities;
●
●stronger regional focus to align with the sales organization;

●
●shifting the geographical footprint to align with future growth in emerging 
markets; and
●
●much greater focus on outsourcing to avoid significant capital investments 
and manage risk.

4.24  3D printing or additive manufacturing 
ROI
Introduction
Additive manufacturing is a process in which a machine makes a three-di­
mensional (3D) object from a CAD (computer-aided design) file.
3D printing can print items with thermoplastics, photopolymers, com­
posites and metals.
Some manufacturing-grade printers are expensive; however, you can find 
a 3D printer for manufacturing purposes from $3,500. The ones costing 
over $100,000 are usually large-format plastic or metal printers, which fre­
quently require special facility requirements and safety equipment.
While some say that 3D printing is replacing high-volume manufactur­
ing, the time and cost required to 3D print parts at high volume is often far 
greater than that of traditional manufacturing.
When to use
The primary uses for 3D printed parts for manufacturing are prototyping, 
tooling and fixtures, spare parts and low-volume end-use parts.
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
312
3D printing could potentially revolutionize the maintenance stores and 
spare parts industry. Rather than hold a comprehensive stock of automotive 
parts, for example, a company can manufacture to order.
How to use
When choosing a 3D printer, you need to ask yourself these questions:
1	 What are your biggest manufacturing challenges? 
• Prototyping (number/time of iterations, lead time/cost);
• tooling (time/cost to tool up, custom tooling); 
• spare parts (lead time, batch sizes);
• end-use parts (cost, quality, lead time).
2	 What are your current costs for outsourcing or machining parts in-house?
3	 How important is it to have strong parts?
4	 Do your parts need to be resistant to heat or chemicals?
5	 Do you have specific material restrictions (thermoplastic, composites, 
photopolymers, metal)?
6	 Are you currently missing deadlines because of time spent machining or 
outsourcing parts?
7	 Is the company losing revenue due to reduced production?
8	 Are your engineers relying too heavily on expensive equipment for non-
revenue parts?
9	 Are you holding significant numbers of items for a ‘just in case’ scenario?
Here are a few areas where manufacturers have benefited by utilizing 3D 
printers:
●
●Design flexibility – make parts that were otherwise unable to be fabricated 
traditionally.
●
●Greater agility – 3D printing allows you to create more iterations, fail 
faster, and achieve better end products. Finding and fixing design flaws 
early also helps to avoid costly design revisions and tooling changes in 
production.
●
●Less machine downtime — continuously innovate with minimal 
downtime.

4.25  Supply chain analytics
Introduction
Today most businesses have the opportunity to analyse vast quantities of 
data efficiently and cost-effectively due to the massive increase in data avail­
able in their business and via the internet, together with the affordability of 
ever-increasing processing power and the continuing reduction in the cost of 
data storage. The use of ‘big data’ in business analytics attracted much at­
tention a few years ago. Business analytics employs a range of methods for 
analysing data, including statistical and economic analyses and modelling, 
simulation and optimization, which have all been developed over many dec­
ades. However, it is only in recent years that so much information has be­
come publicly available, and it has become time- and cost-effective to merge 
and sort all this information, to construct larger models than ever before 
and to test out many more future options. Supply chain analytics (SCA) is 
the application of these methods to logistics and supply chain management 
(LSCM).
According to Russom (2011), big data business analytics (BDBA) can 
help businesses make better decisions and improve their strategy, operations 
efficiency and financial performance.
Before getting too enthusiastic about the ability to solve all our problems 
at a stroke, it is wise to remember that we cannot model everything all the 
time. The most successful applications of SCA focus on a particular question 
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
314
or set of related questions in one of the main areas of LSCM. Of interest to 
us here are the sorts of questions that could be asked and an understanding 
of the processes that can be used to address them.
Many business management systems now have SCA modules as an op­
tion and there are also SCA ‘platforms’, which extract and manipulate data 
from your business database. Often, these platforms have a specialized 
focus; for example, SAP Business Network focuses on procurement. 
Alternatively, you can outsource your problem to specialist consultants who 
will interrogate your database for you and may also combine it with data 
from public sources.
There are three general purposes of analytics (Wang et al, 2016):
●
●‘descriptive’, which refers to identifying problems and opportunities 
through summarizing a situation or drilling down, either at regular 
intervals or as and when required;
●
●‘predictive’, which uses algorithms and programming to discover 
explanatory and predictive patterns in the data; and
●
●‘prescriptive’, which uses algorithms to create and evaluate alternative 
scenarios by means of multi-criteria decision making, simulation and 
optimization.
Many websites offering SCA modules or platforms list the many questions 
that can be asked. Here, our examples give a flavour of the processes used 
to answer a question. This is useful since you will get an idea of the wide-
ranging application of the method.
When to use
When you need to make an important decision and you believe that you can 
obtain more and better information on which to base that decision by min­
ing the company database and/or public data sources.
There are two key points to recognize from big data used for business 
analytics. First, many strategic projects would earlier have been argued from 
a largely qualitative point of view using common sense, experience and a 
few numbers created by extrapolating from, or averaging, available data. 
Second, the starting point of the problem given to a business analyst was 
quite often, ‘Here’s my plan, now go and find the data to support it’. In 
BDBA and SCA, the starting point has changed to, ‘Here is the situation, 
now how can we leverage this for best benefit?’

Supply chain management tools
315
How to use
These methods require deep experience of statistical and mathematical 
methods as well as data management and manipulation. If neither you nor 
a colleague have this sort of knowledge then, from our point of view, the 
most important thing is that you know the method is available and roughly 
how it could work for you. A supply chain consultant and analyst will be 
able to assist you.
Example
1.  To support the decision of where to position 
a new warehouse
Current approaches to deciding where to position a new warehouse focus 
primarily on analysing the location of customers and their ordering patterns 
in terms of frequency and volume, labour cost and availability, local legisla­
tion, plus the transport infrastructure for arrival and distribution of product 
by different modes of transport. In the past, we might only have considered 
the 20 per cent of clients that represent 80 per cent of turnover. Big data 
­allows us to consider all transactions in the last 5–10 years. In addition, 
however, the analyst can use public information to enrich the analysis, for 
example to understand the potential local workforce. Using heuristics (rules 
of thumb), such as 75 per cent of people live and work in the same area, or 
that most people do not want to travel more than 45 minutes to work, or 
that more highly skilled people are willing to travel further to work, the la­
bour catchment area can be estimated. Looking at the population, roads and 
trains in the catchment area allows the size of the work pool to be estimated. 
By adding in employment data, the local availability of particular skills can 
be assessed.
2.  To support the decision of where to expand a retail network
After several years of working on different projects, and by combining data 
from many public and commercial sources, including, for example, 
Companies House, the Office of National Statistics, trade figures, business 
databases such as FAME, and Post Office address files, a data analysis con­
sultancy has constituted their own database of all business premises in the 
UK, which number over two million. This required merging, sorting and 
cleaning the data and the application of many heuristics. The result is that 
they understand the nature and financial weight of virtually all economic

activity (e.g. gross value added) in the UK. This has been used successfully in 
such projects as proposing uses for wasteland that would synergize with and 
complement local economic activity rather than compete with it, or for pre­
dicting the growth in local employment in consequence of the establishment 
of a business park, or determining if there is capacity locally for an innova­
tive business in a certain sector.

4.26  Logistics 4.0
Introduction
Logistics 4.0 is the term given to the concept that logistics and supply chain 
management will benefit from the application of similar technologies to 
those which make up Industry 4.0, or the arrival of smart factories, marking

the fourth industrial revolution (the first being the use of steam to power 
machines, the second being the use of assembly lines for mass production 
and the third being the application of information technology to ­automation).
Overall, the application of these new technologies will increase the effi­
ciency (reducing time and cost) and effectiveness (increased customer 
­satisfaction) of the supply chain by better integration of processes thus in­
creasing transparency and visibility of product and data moving through the 
value chain (not just the supply chain). Technologies used to achieve this 
include the internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing, automation and 
robotics, machine learning, big data and artificial intelligence, simulation 
and augmented reality.
The main components of Logistics 4.0 are listed in Table 4.15. The reader 
has probably heard of most of them but it is their combination which pro­
vides the step change in performance.
When to use
Logistics 4.0 is definitely upon us but it requires understanding and vision 
to spot the opportunities for your business.
There is no time to lose! Learn as much as you can about Logistics 4.0 
and how it can benefit you, your partners and your customers. Not all the 
solutions are expensive.
How to use
Potential applications in logistics and supply chain management are shown 
in Table 4.17 for each of the different components. You can start experi­
menting with some off-the-shelf solutions, e.g. IoT, drones or robots, or en­
gage someone with more experience to help you to set objectives and draw 
up a strategy.
Note that increased digitalization and flow of data increases exposure to 
hacking and fraud. Increased cybersecurity is thus a vital additional compo­
nent to any Logistics 4.0 project.

4.27  Digital twinning
Introduction
Digital twinning is one of several components of Industry 4.0 which are use­
ful in logistics and supply chain management. A digital twin is a digital 
replica of a logistics system or component such that the system or compo­
nent can be tested and experimented with, without any impact on the real-
life system or component. However, testing and experimentation can be 
­carried out with confidence that the real-life system or component will react 
in exactly the same way. For example, the digital twin could be of a ware­
house or a distribution network.
This is very useful for testing out how the system or component will react 
under new circumstances such as extreme load, or failure of a sub-system, 
or when using different customer priority rules, for example.
The digital twin is not a model built separately from the real-life installation 
as discrete event simulation models used to be. The twin continuously moni­
tors what is happening in the real-life system and is updated with real-time 
data. The digital twin uses other elements of Industry 4.0 such as machine 
learning to analyse changes in the real-life system and artificial intelligence to 
assess how to integrate them, thus helping future decision making.
When to use
The digital twin is constantly updating itself but becomes particularly useful 
if a decision is required on a new investment or to develop a new strategy.
How to use
Specialist software is required but the underlying approach is the same re­
gardless of which software is used. The main steps are:
●
●Define the scope of the model, its elements and the relationships between 
the elements.
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

Supply chain management tools
321
●
●Collect data on the operating characteristics of the real-world situation 
and decide how this data will be transmitted to the future twin (sensors, 
video etc).
●
●Build the model feeding in real-time data.
●
●Test and validate the model by analysing its responses to changes in the 
real-time data against the ongoing changing real-life situation.
●
●Continue to develop and adjust the model until it images the real-life 
system or components as closely as possible.
●
●Once validated, the model can be subjected to analysis and experimentation 
which may require exporting the data to other tools.
The main software being used at the time of writing are IBM Digital Twin 
Exchange, Microsoft’s Azure platform and Amazon Web Services (AWS) IoT 
TwinMaker.
Example
Reckitt is an international group known for hygiene, health and nutrition 
products. Reckitt collaborated with Risilience, a company which has devel­
oped from research on climate risk carried out by the University of 
Cambridge Judge Business School, to build a digital twin model of its busi­
ness. The model was deployed as part of Reckitt’s strategy to reach net-zero 
emissions across its entire value chain by 2040 and mitigate risk due to cli­
mate change. Sub-targets included reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
(GHG), reducing energy consumption, using 100 per cent renewable ener­
gies and reducing its product carbon footprint.
Business functions and other stakeholders were involved in developing 
the platform, supplying data and testing out future scenarios, in order to 
mitigate climate risk and identify new business opportunities.
See the full story at https://risilience.com/customer-stories/reckitt-2/
Significant benefits have already been achieved. Reckitt’s 2022 TCFD 
(Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) report states that, 
compared with 2015, there has been a 66 per cent reduction in GHG and a 
3 per cent reduction in use of energy per tonne in operations, while 93 per 
cent of the energy used in manufacturing comes from renewable sources.

4.28  Blockchain in supply chain 
management by Frank Findlow
Introduction
The use of blockchain technology offers a huge upgrade to the current sup­
ply chain system, which often relies on tracking physical paperwork be­
tween siloed parts of the multinational network. It is a trusted, decentralized 
network that allows for the transfer of digital values such as currency and 
data.
By allowing digital information to be distributed but not copied, block­
chain technology has created the backbone of a new type of internet.
The world of blockchain technology has undergone a big transformation 
over the past 10 years as the concept evolved from offering a simple means 
of exchange between two parties to a broad ecosystem full of protocols with 
real-world applications, ranging from decentralized finance to one-of-a-
kind digital art. It is fair to say the applications of blockchain are continuing 
to evolve almost daily.
Top of mind for efficient and reliable management of goods, the cargo 
industry will benefit massively from blockchain. Every year trillions of dol­
lars of freight are transported globally, 90 per cent of which is sent via ocean 
freight.
Given that the major freight companies are among the largest businesses 
in the world, it is amazing to discover that many of their supply chain pro­
cesses are still completed with paperwork. The processing of such paper­
work is usually very time-consuming as it must all be completed manually, 
not to mention far riskier.
A lost document could cause huge delays as the handlers would need to 
trace transaction documents by contacting the other party for copies etc.

Supply chain management tools
323
A blockchain database could almost completely automate the entire 
­process, all the way from the factory to the retailer. An initial block could be 
created for the goods as they leave the factory, thereby initiating the 
­blockchain.
This block would detail the time, type and quantity of goods, as well as 
the transport company’s confirmation of goods received, etc. A new block 
could then be added for each step of the journey until the goods finally reach 
their destination.
The main benefits of blockchain within supply chain are listed in Table 
4.18 below.
When to use
Blockchain is not going away and in fact, more and more examples are 
being developed to prove it is not just about cryptocurrency.
There is no time to lose! Learn as much as you can about blockchain in 
supply chain and how it can benefit you, your partners and your customers. 
Not all the solutions are expensive.
How to use
A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated 
and distributed across the entire network of computer systems in the chain. 
Each block in the chain contains several transactions, and every time a new 
transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added 
to every participant’s ledger.
The decentralized database managed by multiple participants is known 
as distributed ledger technology (DLT).
Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with an 
immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.
This means if one block in one chain is changed, it would be immediately 
apparent that it had been tampered with. If hackers wanted to corrupt a 
blockchain system, they would have to change every block in the chain, 
across all the distributed versions of the chain.
To get the best from blockchain, think big, but start small.
Your final goal may be to completely revamp all your businesses’ supply 
chain processes but it is very likely that you will not get buy-in for that.
Start with a project that can go from pilot project to production quickly.

Potential applications
Faster & leaner 
logistics in 
global trade
Invoicing and inventory management, by 
removing friction from multiparty workflows – 
these systems save cost and time.
Documents upload, manage, edit, and share any type of document 
along your supply chain.
The Documents module helps optimize efficiency for information 
management, certify origins, and ensure they are real.
Improving 
transparency & 
traceability
From an initial base of facts, rules and 
experiences, new knowledge and competences 
can be inferred and generated.
Companies that attain top recall accuracy and 
speed by implementing investigation 
improvements can reduce recall costs, losses, 
reputational damage and, in the case of food 
recalls, save lives.
The ability to successfully stop outbreaks of food-borne illnesses 
through food traceability protocols includes the accuracy and speed 
of obtaining tracking information and the inability of third parties to 
manipulate that tracking information.
Unlike traditional supply chains, blockchain-based supply chains will 
automatically update the data transaction records when a change is 
made, enhancing traceability along the overall supply chain network.
Automating 
commercial 
processes
With the use of ‘smart contracts’. Smart 
contracts work by following simple ‘if/when… 
then…’ statements that are written into code on 
a blockchain. A network of computers executes 
the actions when predetermined conditions 
have been met and verified.
Identity – document-less citizenship, promotes portable 
identification. Healthcare – eliminates drug counterfeits, tracks 
patient information.
Banking & finance – better processing of cross-border payments – 
higher level of security & privacy.

Explanation
Potential applications
Trust & single 
version of the 
truth
Business model innovation – this is the next 
level of the sharing economy where there needs 
to be a higher degree of collaboration in real 
time where participants work off a common 
ledger or single version of the truth. Blockchain 
solves a ‘social problem’ – it enables privacy and 
transparency at the same time when sharing 
data.
This is very useful whenever there are ‘issues of 
trust’ between parties.
We will increasingly see blockchain-based systems used to 
demonstrate compliance with regulations regarding data source and 
data handling. Trustworthy data is also key to sustainability 
reporting: a bonus is that many blockchain-based solutions (e.g. 
track-and-trace, or contract compliance in resource extraction) 
already have this data.
A classic example of a shared network is an airport, used by many 
different airlines which are in competition with each other. Imagine 
a world where each airline had to build its own airport – it would be a 
mess and very expensive. But that is the system in which we 
exchange our data today.

Choose one that makes an existing process more efficient and will result in

Outsourcing

5.1  Outsourcing
Introduction
Outsourcing is about recognizing a task or process that isn’t your organiza­
tion’s core competence and getting a third party to operate it more effi­
ciently and hopefully more cost-effectively. There are many models to guide 
companies through the process of determining whether to outsource, how 
to go about outsourcing and how to ensure that the implementation is suc­
cessful.
We have looked at a number of different models and combined the best 
elements of each to ensure a complete end-to-end process. We have also 
simplified the model and taken into account the likely benefits and barriers 
to outsourcing.
When to use
There are many situations when a company needs to evaluate whether out­
sourcing logistics can be a fundamental part of an ongoing strategy. This 
model enables the company to assess its current situation and decide whether 
to outsource or not. Part two of the model (Figure 5.2) provides a methodol­
ogy for outsourcing and implementation.
How to use
Before tackling the main model, there is a simplified version produced by 
Kate Vitasek et al (2013), which can be seen in Figure 5.1.

We aren’t always going to get absolute yes and no answers; however, there is 
likely to be a preference one way or the other. If it is a genuine ‘don’t know’, you 
will need to undertake further work. The term ‘logistics’ can be replaced by any 
other function in the company, such as facilities management, IT, procurement, 
customer service, etc. (A printed version of the questionnaire can be down­
loaded for free from http://howtologistics.com)
Follow the suggestion indicated by the majority of yes and no answers. 
There may be a requirement to undertake a benchmarking exercise to fully 
assess the current logistics operation and examine the feasibility of out­
sourcing. If the majority of the answers point towards outsourcing, we need 
to follow a process to ensure that it runs smoothly (see Figure 5.2).

5.2  To 4PL© or not to 4PL©
Introduction
The decision to outsource your logistics operations is difficult enough, but 
then you have to decide what type of organization to place the contract 
with – third-party logistics providers (3PL), lead logistics providers (LLP) or 
fourth-party logistics providers (4PL©)?
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
332
In terms of definitions, 3PLs will utilize mos their own resources on the 
contract. Lead logistics providers will utilize their own assets and those of 
others to operate the contract, whereas, according to Accenture, which came 
up with the name, ‘A 4PL© is an integrator that assembles the resources, 
capabilities, and technology of its own organization and other organizations 
to design, build and run comprehensive supply chain solutions.’ A true 4PL© 
has the following attributes:
●
●non-asset-owning company – in terms of warehouses and trucks;
●
●sophisticated IT systems;
●
●a strategist that manages all logistics operations on behalf of companies;
●
●is expected to provide the most cost-effective logistics systems to its 
clients;
●
●an intermediary between the shipper and the transport companies;
●
●develops contracts on behalf of the shipper with an optimum number of 
transport and warehousing providers.
Working with 4PLs© offers the following advantages:
●
●the ability to step back from the day-to-day operations to see the big 
picture;
●
●a neutral party looking to optimize your supply chain rather than their 
own assets;
●
●an ability to select the best 3PLs for the task required;
●
●an unbiased service;
●
●ability to instigate shared user transportation for clients;
●
●greater access to resources and greater flexibility;
●
●greater information flow through sophisticated supply chain systems;
●
●single point of contact;
●
●seamless key performance indicators;
●
●shared interest with customer, better view of whole market;
●
●payment-by-results options such as profit-share schemes;
●
●a global reach in many circumstances.
The disadvantages are:
●
●reliant on partners to provide the service;
●
●profit on profit;

●
●reluctance on the part of 3PLs to work for 4PLs©;
●
●a confusing marketplace as to who are the true 4PLs©.
When to use

5.3  A risk-based approach to logistics 
outsourcing
Introduction
There are several types and levels of logistics and supply chain outsourcing 
solutions and the nature of the industry allows for bespoke service offerings, 
with an eagerness among service providers to avoid a one-size-fits-all solu­
tion, although a number of proposals are presented on that basis. A large 
number of customers of logistics service providers (LSPs) remain very pre­
scriptive in their control of their LSPs and have an ongoing role in managing 
the outsourced relationship. It is also not always clear what degree of risk 
each service offering entails for the customer and the service provider.
A risk-based approach
This approach is illustrated in Figure 5.3, which describes a pyramid of 
outsourcing solutions, balancing them with the degree of control and risk 
inherent to the parties involved.
At the base of the pyramid lies ‘buying’ the blind outsourcing decision, 
where customers aspire to a better state of affairs and see outsourcing as a 
route to a better way of working. There are few or no criteria and the solu­
tion is left to the incoming service provider; the balance of risk is high for 
both parties in the absence of agreed success criteria. In this environment the

LSP may encounter a dynamic environment with a high degree of scope drift 
and this poses a significant risk to any long-term commercial arrangement.
The next step on the pyramid is procurement officer outsourcing, which 
is focused on saving money using performance over the previous 12 to 18 
months as a benchmark from which to make logistics procurement deci­
sions. This commoditization of logistics procurement does not rely on a high 
degree of ongoing control from the customer supply chain team, if indeed 
there is one in situ. There is a high risk that this purchase will move to an­
other provider at the end of the contract term, and this is not a basis for the 
long-term success of such an agreement.
Traditional outsourcing is the tried-and-tested formula developed in the 
post-World War II era. The familiarity with the process and pitfalls ranks 
this element a medium risk to the customer and service provider and re­
quires a medium level of supply chain control on behalf of the customer. 
Concepts such as 3PL, LLP, 4PL© and 5PL sit in this element.
The next step on the pyramid is using outsourcing to change an element 
of the supply chain; this is when the activity moves from functional to

­transformational and warrants a higher degree of control from the customer. 
Because this is transformational outsourcing, it may be assumed that it will 
be part of the customer’s overall supply chain management strategy, with 
clearly defined objectives. The service provider becomes a means to an end 
with a specific remit and timescale to follow as it executes part of the cus­
tomer-driven project.
The prescriptive step sees the balance of power in the longer-term rela­
tionship moving from the service provider to the customer. Requiring a 
greater degree of control, the customer typically owns the infrastructure and 
assets, while the service provider supplies labour and intellectual property 
within clearly defined and closely managed boundaries. The customer ben­
efits from having a service provider for short-term flexibility in other parts 
of its supply chain and for speedy supply chain access to new markets as 
well as territories. This step is very much a master-servant relationship and 
because it is prescriptive, the balance of risk to both the customer and ser­
vice provider is low.
The top segment of the pyramid moves the relationship into an equity-
sharing arrangement, where both organizations share assets, cash and risk 
in delivering the supply chain solution. Customer and supplier are locked in 
a mutual arrangement with a common suite of brand delivery objectives. 
The behaviour set exhibited by both may be described as ‘what’s in it for we’ 
(WIIFWe) (Vitasek et al, 2010).
The model links some iterations of outsourced logistics service provision 
with the degree of control expected from the customer and a risk of engage­
ment profile for the logistics service provider.
Summary
The pyramid in Figure 5.3 may be used to define and assess the risk profile 
of a logistics outsourcing strategy. The risk is defined in terms of ‘low to 
high’ for the parties involved; it looks at the process as a whole and is thus 
not blinkered to one point of view. The optimal relationship is balanced 
between both parties and demonstrates a WIIFWe set of behaviours.

5.4  Supply chain and logistics outsourcing
Introduction
The supply chain satellite is a strategy assessment tool developed by a group 
of logistics professionals and academics. They have combined their special­
ist experience to develop a framework for supply chain outsourcing.
When to use
When reviewing your supply chain strategy and when contemplating out­
sourcing all or part of your logistics and supply chain operation.
How to use
The model consists of two axes, x and y, that form the basis of your posi­
tion. You need to decide where you are on each axis.
x. Added value of your supply chain
This axis measures the extent to which your supply chain and specifically 
your logistics process adds value to your product. It determines whether, 
and to what extent, differentiation of your logistics processes can impact 
your competitive position. Indirectly this axis also measures the impact of 
logistics on your bottom line since a differentiated logistics model will jus­
tify higher margins.
y. Complexity of your supply chain
This axis forms the unit of measure for the complexity of your logistics op­
eration. It measures how easy it is to standardize your logistics processes. It 
is a fundamental factor that highly influences the type of relationship you 
will have with a logistics service provider. The four segments shown in 
Figure 5.4 are discussed below.
1. Price buyer
Cost containment in the logistics chain is your main objective. You have 
limited or no need for the highly specialized logistics competences of the 
LSP. This makes it easy for you to select a provider. You make sure you 
know the cost leaders among the LSPs and develop relations with them in 
each geographical market.

Minimizing the logistics cost as part of the final selling price of your product 
represents an important source of competitive advantage. It can lower the 
price for which you can offer your product to the end user, or improve your 
margin. The logistics operation should contribute to these objectives but 
does not, in itself, impact the perceived value of your products.
2. Do it yourself
You do not outsource or hardly outsource any logistics activities and have 
no need to develop relations with LSPs. Because of your highly customized 
handling and shipping requirements you have custom built these capabilities 
yourself. Other reasons for your situation could be that you are locked into 
an insourced logistics operation. Reorganization costs would outweigh the 
potential benefits of outsourcing. Alternatively, you could have had previous 
negative experiences with LSPs or you are sceptical about the true cost of 
outsourcing.
3. Expertise buyer
Your logistics activities are complex and you have a wide portfolio of prod­
ucts, suppliers and customers. Product lifecycles are short and you face ­critical 
time-to-market requirements in a volatile market. Logistics outsourcing in

principle should be a long-term commitment to the LSP as this allows you to 
capitalize on continuous improvement and cost reduction. LSPs are selected 
on specialist expertise, technologies and assets and will be deployed in those 
parts of the supply chain where they bring substantial benefit.
4. Strategic partner
Your logistics activities are complex and of high strategic importance. You 
have a wide portfolio of products, suppliers and customers. Product lifecy­
cles are short and you face critical time-to-market requirements in a volatile 
market. Your contracts with LSPs aim to facilitate long-term commitment. 
Together with your LSPs you work on a programme of continuous improve­
ments in service levels, flexible delivery options, lead times, warehouse effi­
ciency and eventually cost reduction.
Undecided
There is no or almost no conscious strategic approach. You either take con­
flicting approaches to the management of your logistics operations or you 
lack a clear approach. There can be many possible reasons for this lack of 
strategic direction. In a positive scenario you find yourself in a transitional 
period where a strategy is defined but far from implemented. Conflicting 
views within the supply chain function or in your company’s strategic man­
agement can also cause logistics processes and improvement projects to even 
each other out and result in a status quo.
5.5  Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)
Introduction
A non-disclosure agreement is used when sensitive and confidential data is 
shared between two or more parties. In a situation where a company is plan­
ning to outsource its logistics or supply chain operations it needs to provide the 
logistics services provider (LSP) with sufficient data to provide a meaningful 
quotation for the services to be outsourced.
When to use
At the beginning of the outsourcing process.

How to use
The party planning to outsource its operations should send a copy of the 
NDA to each of the participating organizations and ensure that it is signed 
by a senior director and returned before any data is sent to the LSP.

5.7  Logistics services provider (LSP) 
criteria and decision table
Introduction
When outsourcing a logistics operation it is likely that the company will 
have contacted a number of companies to quote for the business. The com­
pany will need to differentiate between the different potential suppliers, and 
a decision table will assist you greatly in deciding on the most suitable LSP.
Having decided on your criteria as listed in Table 5.3, weigh their impor­
tance and score each company against these criteria, which will vary from 
company to company, as will the weighting for each criterion.
When to use
When looking to choose the most suitable supplier for logistics services.
How to use
Form a team of people to first choose the criteria and provide weights to 
them, then ask each member of the team to score each of the LSPs based on 
their requirements.
The team is normally made up of managers/directors from a number of 
departments including logistics, finance, operations, human resources, IT 
and procurement.

Does the supplier have the internal or 
external capability to deliver the IT aspects 
of the services including timely 
implementation of any interfaces and 
changes to systems?
The next tool explains how to use a decision table in this process.
5.8 Decision matrix analysis (DMA)
Introduction
Decision matrix analysis is a quasi-scientific method to aid decision making 
when there are many different factors to take into account and a number of 
alternative options or courses of action. It is particularly useful when a 
group of people must make a joint decision, since it allows the discussion to 
be more objective, giving some distance from individual ‘pet’ projects.
This can be an effective tool when there are a significant number of com­
peting alternatives and myriad factors that need to be taken into account. 
This tool can assist managers in making a choice where there isn’t a clear 
and obvious outright candidate, supplier or product. Being able to use DMA 
means that you can take decisions confidently and rationally, at a time when 
a team is finding it difficult to come to a consensus.
In all cases, a method of this nature improves the quality of discussion, 
moving the arguments away from the subjective and closer to the objective.
When to use
This is a useful technique when you have a difficult choice to make; where 
you have a number of alternatives and many different factors to take into 
account. This could be, for example, the choice of some major piece of 
equipment, location of a new plant or warehouse, or for comparing tenders. 
Note that the method does not make the decision for you – it is not that 
sensitive – but it does enable a more objective and analytical discussion to 
take place among a group of decision makers, or the range of options to be 
narrowed down to the last two or three.

How to use
Identify the key criteria that will be used to compare the different options 
and give them a relative weighting from 1 to 5 (where 5 is most important). 
Each factor is allocated to a row in the decision matrix. Each option is allo­
cated to a column in the decision matrix.
Working across each row, score each option on a scale of 1 to 5 (where 5 
is best) on how well it meets the criterion. Multiply the score awarded by the 
weighting to arrive at a sub-total for that criterion for that option. Add up 
all the subtotals for that option to arrive at a total score. The option with 
the highest score is the most logical choice based on the scores and weight­
ings allocated.
When using this tool, don’t assume that it is totally objective. If the scores 
are very close, further analysis should take place. Utilize a spreadsheet to 
compile the figures as this will enable you to change weights and scores very 
quickly and produce overall totals in a much faster time.
Example
The following is taken from an outsourcing exercise where a company was 
looking to change supplier for its warehousing and pallet load distribution 
operation. It is a comparison based on the tender responses and presenta­
tions made by the 3PLs.
All of the criteria were discussed internally and given weights based on 
the consensus of opinion. Each member of the management team involved 
in the decision-making process scored the contractors based on the criteria. 
The weighting and scoring criteria were:
Weighting
Score
1. Nice to have
1. Very poor
2. Fairly important
2. Poor
3. Important
3. Average
4. Very important
4. Good
5. Most important

5.9  Mind maps
Introduction
The ‘brain’ of a computer operates in a purely linear fashion; our brains do 
not. Brains work by comparing, processing and integrating information; in 
essence, they work associatively. Every single thought that we produce is 
linked to other thoughts, sights, sounds and concepts.
Mind maps were developed by British psychology author Tony Buzan. 
Tony also hosted a BBC TV series called Use Your Head. During this show, 
Tony frequently and enthusiastically used a ‘tree-like’ diagram to visualize 
his thoughts while also using colours to highlight key words and phrases.
The reason we often ‘sketch’ things in this format is down to the fact that 
this ‘map’ takes on the same structure as our memory, i.e. it is associative. It is 
an easier way to see and recognize things and thus recall them. Mind mapping 
is therefore a way of ‘brainstorming’ (see tool 8.1) or making notes but in a 
more visual way.
When to use
When you want to brainstorm a particular problem and then provide a 
visual representation to both yourself and your colleagues.
How to use
The brainstorming potential of a mind map is immense. You start with a 
basic problem and put it at the centre of the ‘map’ and then generate ideas 
from it. As you generate these ideas, other thoughts come to mind that are

then added to the major spurs. By presenting your thoughts in this visual 
way a better overview is frequently gained. Colours and pictures can be used 
to accentuate the data.
The mind map shown in Figure 5.7 has been produced in response to an 
enquiry to outsource a logistics operation. The diagram shows the thought 
processes that the person went through when thinking about the task in 
hand. Figure 5.7 is a simplified version; Figure 5.8 shows how complex a

map can be downloaded from http://howtologistics.com)
Utilizing a mind map enables you to quickly understand, identify and 
absorb the structure of a subject. However, more important and due to the 
fact that a mind map is the ‘same shape’ as your memory, it enables you to 
recall the information.

5.10  RACI matrix by Rod Turner
Introduction
During any project, it is important to identify all the roles and activities that 
are affected to any degree by the changes required to deliver a successful 
outcome in a specific project. These individuals and groups are all stake­
holders in the project and may be either internal stakeholders (working in 
the organization delivering the project) or external stakeholders (external to 
the organization but impacted by the project).
As stakeholders, they can be impacted positively or negatively by the 
project as a whole or by specific steps in the project. Such projects are not 
unique to logistics and supply chain management – indeed the tool is used 
extensively in general project management activities.
In this arena, there are often wider implications to any change project 
and there can be impacts on very diverse groups and individuals both within 
and outside the organization.
The RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix focuses 
on the requirement to communicate with different internal stakeholders at dif­
ferent stages of the project. It identifies the key tasks and/or decisions involved 
in the project and assesses the expectations of stakeholders, but also the needs 
of the project at each of these points if the overall project plan is to be achieved.
The outcome of the correctly completed RACI matrix is to ensure data is 
available when needed, decisions are reached when required, and information 
is shared when necessary.
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit

This matrix supports three important aspects of the change management 
process:
1	 Identification of the steps in the project that impact on key stakeholders 
or require input from key stakeholders.
2	 Identification of the individuals or groups that are affected by the project.
3	 Clarification of the relationship between each stakeholder and each step 
in the project.
When to use
During the process of establishing a project plan for any significant change 
management activity and when creating a list of stakeholders for any project.
How to use
Review the project plan (the list of activities needed to deliver the project 
with timings for each activity). If there is no formal project plan, create a list 
of all the activities needed to deliver the project.
Identify all items that require information, approval or other input from 
any stakeholder and list those items in the first column of the spreadsheet. 
Focus on items that are internal to the organization – the intention is not to 
replicate every item in the project plan in the RACI.
Create a column for each stakeholder. There is no need to list stakehold­
ers in order of importance or seniority. It is possible to combine groups of 
individuals – for example, the project ‘Steering Committee’ or ‘Human 
Resources’ or ‘Demand Planning’ may be a homogenous group.
Identify which of the four categories (see below) best reflects the relation­
ship between each item in the first column and each stakeholder.
The four categories are:
1	 Responsible: Must endorse or approve any decision taken or action 
planned on this item – for example, the ‘Steering Committee’ should 
endorse the selection of a key supplier for a project.
2	 Accountable: Must provide the data or perform the work required to 
deliver a specific item – for example, the HR team are expected to recruit 
10 warehouse workers by the end of Q3 or the Demand Planners provide 
a forecast for stockholding levels by the end of Q4.
本书版权归Kogan Page所有

Outsourcing tools
361
3	 Consulted: Before a decision is taken, the project team will engage with 
this group to include their opinions and feedback – for example, the 
Head of Finance should be consulted on the expected payment terms 
with a chosen supplier or the budgeted annual costs.
4	 Informed: After a decision is taken, there will be formal communication 
with these groups and individuals – for example, heads of departments 
should be informed about the choice of lead supplier.
Place a single value (‘R’, ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘I’) in the cell that intersects the stakeholder 
with the project step.
Review the chart once completed to ensure expectations are realistic and 
achievable – for example, normally only one stakeholder is ‘Accountable’ 
for a task and, normally, only one stakeholder is ‘Responsible’.
If it is not clear who is responsible or accountable for a task to be com­
pleted, the project team should clarify with the project sponsor or the project 
Steering Committee. This is one of the critical benefits of a complete RACI 
matrix – it becomes clear to all involved who is responsible, and accountable, 
for every step of the project. Therefore, ensure that whoever is noted as 
‘Responsible’ or ‘Accountable’ for any task is both aware and in agreement 
with the actions required of them.
Allocating responsibility or accountability for a task without communi­
cating is a recipe for failure! Equally, note that the RACI matrix is not 
‘time-bound’ so the overall project plan must be available in the communi­
cation process.
Once the cell allocation process is complete, and the final chart has been 
reviewed and accepted, the project team should begin to communicate to all 
stakeholders, so they understand the expectations and timing and required 
outputs.
Typical example
In the first column, list all elements of the project plan that require internal 
stakeholder interaction. In the top row, allocate a separate column to each of 
the internal stakeholders and enter the relevant initial at the intersection of 
each column and row. If the matrix looks too big or too complex, sub-divide 
into functional areas such as ‘IT/IS/Systems’ or ‘Planning’.

Performance 
measurement 
and quality 
improvement
6.1  Performance measurement 
and quality improvement
Introduction
‘If you do not measure, you cannot manage’, or so the theory goes. According 
to a survey by Aberdeen Group (2010), best-in-class companies are 1.9 
times more likely to utilize established standards against which employees 
can be measured. They are also 2.7 times as likely to undertake employee-
specific data collection. The companies will use both individual and group 
performance metrics to monitor, motivate and encourage the workforce.
KPIs are introduced into companies to both measure and control 
­performance:
●
●To measure in order to extend vision and strategy to performance, create 
a discipline and communicate the non-negotiables, i.e. those targets that 
are essential.
●
●To control so as to expose gaps between aspirations and actual 
performance and to close those gaps.
●
●To change behaviours and future performance to let people know what a 
good job looks like and create understanding, change attitudes and align 
energies.
KPIs should not primarily be thought of as measures but as drivers and ena­
blers of vision – they should help take you where you want to go by translat­
ing your vision into effective performance.
364

Performance measurement and quality improvement tools
365
When to use
When looking to improve performance within the company.
How to use
You have to translate the board’s vision into bite-sized chunks to let every 
employee know what a good job looks like. To achieve this, you need to:
●
●Structure the plan, i.e. determine the scope of the activities to be measured 
and identify the organization and department-level objectives.
●
●Communicate the plan.
●
●Drive the plan by determining the operating processes and methods 
required and set the goals.
●
●Measure against the plan.
●
●Support employee behaviours through training and mentoring.
●
●Report progress.
●
●Initiate remedial action where required.
●
●Benchmark excellence to create best practice (see tool 6.7).
You need to monitor performance against the criteria that are important to 
your customers (service). You also need to monitor performance against the 
criteria that are important to you (costs).
Do not introduce too many measures, as you will end up spending too 
much time measuring and not enough time managing and controlling. To 
ensure success you need to:
●
●produce accurate data;
●
●validate and ensure completeness of data;
●
●target the correct audience;
●
●put emphasis on user ownership;
●
●react to changes in business activity;
●
●measure against historical data but also benchmark current best practice;
●
●simplify processes and measurements to ensure ease of maintenance;
●
●spend less than the savings gained from improved productivity.
Finally, these KPIs need to be focused on the future, lead to behaviour 
change and help you realize your vision.

Table 6.1 provides examples of eight measurements for four key business 
drivers that are introduced in the Balanced Scorecard tool (tool 6.5).
Taking customer service as an example, Table 6.2 provides details of each 
of the KPIs for customer service together with standards and targets. As 
discussed in tool 6.2, these need to be SMART.
In Table 6.2, ‘critical’ is a situation in which, unless improvement is intro­
duced quickly, the business will fail. A failing score denotes a requirement 
for immediate action to be taken to prevent the operation reaching a critical 
stage where loss of business is inevitable.

A standard is that which must be achieved for the warehouse/team/individ­
ual to be seen as being satisfactory – this is the minimum level of acceptable 
performance. Finally, a target is a level of performance above standard that 
is desirable to achieve in order to impress and stretch the warehouse/team/
individual. It is likely to be best in class in the industry.
Performance results need to be communicated both internally and exter­
nally. This can be achieved through regular operational meetings – weekly, 
monthly and/or quarterly. Results can be posted on noticeboards for all staff 
to see.
As for incentives, these can be individual or team based. In the case of 
outsourcing, a gain share arrangement can be introduced where logistics 
service providers share in the savings and productivity increases they have 
instigated.
To complete the process, ensure that the KPIs are aligned within the com­
pany – a customer’s perception could be totally different from that of indi­
vidual departments. For example:
●
●100 per cent dispatch of what’s available from the warehouse doesn’t 
mean it’s what the customer ordered – the order may have been stock 
adjusted before being sent to the warehouse for picking.
●
●Dispatch within 24 hours of the warehouse receiving the order from sales 
may not have been 24-hour dispatch from receipt of the customer order – 
it could have sat on someone’s desk for a day!

6.2  SMART
Introduction
Many companies operate with far too many key performance indicators 
(KPIs), which leads to problems not only in terms of the time taken to cap­
ture and analyse the data but also the relevance to the staff of some of the 
measures. This tool focuses management attention on a number of aspects 
in relation to KPIs.
When to use
When a company is looking to introduce performance measures, there are a 
number of stages that need to be followed. A company needs to choose the 
KPIs that are right for it and its customers and will lead to improved perfor­
mance.
How to use
The first known uses of the mnemonic SMART appeared in an article by 
George T Doran in the November 1981 issue of Management Review. It 
gives guidance to managers to ensure that the correct measures are chosen. 
When deciding on a KPI, that measure needs to pass five tests:
S – Specific. The measure has to explain exactly what the company is 
measuring and why. This includes the specific area to be measured, how 
it is measured and who is involved in the measurement. It needs to be 
clear and unambiguous to all involved. For example, ‘On-time delivery’ 
relates to the number of orders that were delivered to the client at the 
time requested. This can be expressed as a percentage based on the 
number of on-time deliveries divided by the total number of deliveries 
made within a particular time frame. However, if the delivery is made 24 
hours before the deadline is this on time? This is why the KPI needs to be 
specific. A less specific measure would be customer satisfaction, which is, 
as we will see next, more difficult to measure.
M – Measurable. The performance indicator has to be measurable. You need 
to be able to compare the current figures with past data, or data from 
other sources such as budgets, competitors, peers. The measure needs to

371
be objective rather than subjective, with little room for ambiguity. It 
needs to be quantifiable in terms of numbers, monetary value, time etc.
A – Achievable. There is no point in setting targets that cannot be achieved 
under any circumstances. This leads to demotivation. The performance 
measure also needs to challenge staff and therefore should not be set too 
low either. The target should be achieved ‘with effort’. An on-time delivery 
target of 100 per cent every time is probably not achievable, yet a delivery 
target of 50 per cent on time should be easily achievable and therefore 
not a realistic target.
R – Relevant. The indicator also needs to be relevant to the business. It 
should dovetail with other parts of the business and assist in achieving 
the company’s overall goal and vision. The specific goal needs to take you 
somewhere, i.e. it needs to drive the business forward. This can be seen 
clearly in the Balanced Scorecard tool (see tool 6.5) where different 
departments share the same goals but have their own specific targets in 
order to achieve these goals.
T – Time-based. This covers a number of areas. For example, we need a time 
frame over which to measure so that we can compare year-on-year data, 
and we also need a target date to ensure that everyone knows we are 
working towards a deadline.
Finally, according to Matthews (2013), KPIs need to be future focused:
●
●a clear vision will drive KPIs;
●
●effective KPIs will drive effective behaviours;
●
●effective behaviours will drive effective performance;
●
●effective performance drives sustainable profit.

Table 6.4 shows some examples of KPIs that can be applied in a warehouse. 
It is not suggested that all of these measures are introduced; choose the ones 
that are important to you as a company and to your customers. Note the 
warehouse is not responsible for final delivery, therefore in these KPIs we 
use dispatched on time as opposed to delivered on time.

6.5  Balanced Scorecard
Introduction
Much has been written on the Balanced Scorecard and we cannot do full 
justice to the subject in a few pages; however, we will outline the premise 
and suggest how you can begin the process and decide whether this is a 
performance tool you can use in your own company.
Kaplan and Norton (1992), who developed the Balanced Scorecard, be­
lieve that you cannot judge the performance of a company solely through 
financial measures. They suggested three other areas that required a com­
pany’s attention. The model is now made up of four areas, namely: financial; 
customer satisfaction; internal practices and procedures; and training and 
development. The first two perspectives are relevant to the here and now

(customers and shareholders) and the last two are relevant to the future 
(people and processes), thus forming a balanced approach. Many writers 
have looked to enhance the model by including other aspects within the 
business that require the attention of staff at all levels throughout the 
­organization.
Figure 6.1 shows an adaptation of the Balanced Scorecard model pro­
duced by Performetrix, a producer of software, to enhance the Balanced 
Scorecard. As can be seen, environmental issues have been added to the 
people quadrant. The Balanced Scorecard is no longer just a simple perfor­
mance measurement framework but has evolved into a strategic planning 
tool and management system.
When to use
When the company is looking to establish and formalize a performance 
measurement system and instil a culture of continuous improvement. Note 
that a Balanced Scorecard will take some time to set up.
How to use
The premise is to begin with a vision, determine a strategy or strategies to 
achieve it and then break these down into activities that have their own

measurements. The ideal scenario sees departments within the company all 
working towards the same vision, with relevant and related KPIs.
First, you need to set out the company’s vision and the strategies to 
achieve this. A SWOT analysis (see tool 6.9) is a good tool in this respect. 
The perspectives mentioned above need to be clear and understandable to 
all, both within and outside the business. The top-level scorecard needs to be 
translated into more detailed plans and tasks and each department given 
measures and goals that will play a part in achieving the overall vision of the 
company.
The following steps need to be taken (this can take up to two months to 
complete):
1	 As with the majority of new initiatives, you need to gain board 
commitment.
2	 Find a suitable project owner.
3	 Confirm/review/revise your company vision.
4	 Define your four business perspectives and ensure clarity and 
understanding.
5	 Formulate the overall strategic aims.
6	 Identify the critical success factors and create your initial KPIs with 
unambiguous definitions. Ensure they are SMART (see tool 6.2).
7	 Create the metrics for your KPIs (see tools 6.1, 6.3 and 6.4). Each 
measure has objectives and targets that are measured against actual 
performance.
8	 Analyse the measures and ensure that they provide ‘balance’.
9	 Establish a comprehensive top-level scorecard and filter through the 
organization.
10	 Translate the vision into a strategy and the strategy into day-to-day 
tasks.
11	 Produce both long- and short-term goals.
12	 Develop an action plan to achieve these goals.
13	 Continuously review and be prepared to change.
Figure 6.2 is an example of how a warehouse operation can assist in the 
success of the company’s vision by providing a performance that leads to the 
achievement of the goals set.

6.6  Radar chart
Introduction
This tool can be used to show the gap between actual and targeted perfor­
mance and present it visually. Normally you would include 6–10 organiza­
tional factors. Radar charts can also be used to compare alternative methods 
or equipment and their efficiency against expected results.
When to use
When you wish to present to a customer or show internal colleagues where 
there are gaps in performance. The chart clearly shows which factors require 
the most attention.
How to use
Decide on the performance categories to be measured and compared (KPIs 
can be taken from the lists shown in tools 6.1, 6.3 and 6.4). Ensure that each 
category has consistent measures both for the target and actual perfor­
mance. These can be shown as percentages or scales from 0–10 or 0–5, for 
example. Then, produce the chart:
1	 Draw a diagram with as many sides as there are performance categories. 
In Figure 6.3 we have drawn a heptagon.
2	 Label each of the outside points with the performance category.
3	 Draw lines from the outside points to the centre of the shape.
4	 Beginning from the outside, draw parallel lines from the outside to the 
inside at increments denoting the performance figures. This can be from 
5 (excellent performance) to 0 (poor performance) or you can use 
percentages as shown in Figure 6.3. Ensure that the number of lines 
drawn equates to the number of increments.
5	 Plot the target scores and connect each of the target scores.
6	 Plot the actual results figures and link them.
7	 Once complete, evaluate the figures and look for areas for improvement.
Figure 6.3 looks at seven specific KPIs related to warehouse operations and 
plots the difference between target and actual performance.

6.7  Benchmarking
Introduction
According to Natarjan (2005), benchmarking is:
the practice of being humble enough to admit that someone else is better at 
something and being wise enough to try to learn how to match and even surpass 
them at it. It is a systematic approach to business improvement where best 
practice is sought and implemented to improve a process beyond the benchmark 
performance.
Best practice as it is today is not the best possible practice. ‘As good as’ is not 
‘better than’. It is not a substitute for creativity and innovation.
Benchmarking is a way of comparing your own performance with that of 
your peers, be they internal or external, to find out how efficient and effec­
tive your business or department is compared to others. By identifying high-
performance or best-in-class operations, you can learn what it is they do 
that allows them to achieve competitive advantage. It also provides you 
with targets based on other operations currently achieving these levels of 
performance. Note that, according to Sweeney (2007):
Benchmarking is not about copying other companies’ approaches; rather 
it is about learning and adapting appropriate practices so that they can be 
usefully adopted in an effort to improve efficiency and/or effectiveness (adapt 
before adopting!). Companies do not need to be the world’s best at everything. 
All companies have finite resources and benchmarking can help to identify 
where these resources should be targeted.
When to use
●
●When you need to understand your own business performance.
●
●When you want to identify areas for improvement.
●
●When the competition is stealing a march on you and you need to discover 
what they are doing better.
●
●When you need to manage and accelerate change within the business.
●
●When you are looking to set performance targets that can be proven to 
be achievable.

Table 6.5  Stages of benchmarking
Stage
Explanation
DEFINE
Select the area to be 
studied
Think about what your customers want from the 
business. What are the issues likely to attract and 
retain business today and in the future?
Define the process 
to be benchmarked
Think about those processes that can really make an 
impact on the business. Think about the parts of the 
business that add value for the customer and can 
produce a competitive edge.
Identify potential 
benchmarking partners
Who do you consider the best in the industry? Who is 
regarded as being world class in this area? Are there 
companies in other industries with a reputation for 
excellence?
Identify the data 
required, sources and 
appropriate methods 
of collection
Brainstorm ideas for the types of data that you can 
collect to measure the performance of your own and 
the benchmark company. Alternatives to contacting 
external companies include trade fairs, company 
accounts, journals, magazines, customer surveys, 
etc – these can all provide useful information.
ANALYSE
Collect your data 
and select 
benchmarking partners
From all the ideas created from the Define stage you 
need to evaluate the various options. Take into 
account factors such as the quality of the data, the 
cost and time involved in collecting it and whether 
you are prepared to share the data with other 
companies. An independent consultant or educational 
establishment can provide anonymity and 
independence in this.
Determine the 
performance gap
Make honest comparisons between your 
performance and that of the companies you are 
benchmarking. You need to identify areas where there 
is significant room for improvement and which will 
contribute to business success.
Establish the difference 
in the process
Examine the benchmarked company in more detail. 
Dig beneath the data to understand what they are 
actually doing better than you and, more importantly, 
how they are doing it.

How to use
Step 1
Decide the critical success factors or areas of improvement that you want to 
measure. Don’t choose processes that do not have a significant effect on the 
business or sufficient potential for improvement.
Step 2
Have a detailed knowledge of your own operations and processes. Gather 
sufficient data to be able to compare accurately with other operations.
Stage
Explanation
Target future 
performance
Once you have understood the potential for 
improvement, you need to develop realistic targets 
for internal improvement projects.
IMPLEMENT
Communicate and gain 
commitment
The data collected during the Analysis stage can be 
used to convey the scale of the problem and potential 
for improvement. This can help to create acceptance 
and commitment to the improvement process.
Adjust targets and 
develop improvement 
plan
Individual improvement projects should be 
established to address the areas for improvement. 
Plans and targets for these projects should be 
developed by the people who will be running them, 
not necessarily the benchmarking team.
Implement and monitor
There is no point in benchmarking if you are not going 
to make improvements. You need to implement any 
changes and monitor them to ensure they are 
achieving what you expected.
REVIEW
Review progress and 
recalibrate
Note that the best in the business is always improving 
on current performance, so you need to continue the 
process. If you are fully satisfied with a particular 
area, look for others to improve.

Step 3
Decide whether to benchmark internally or externally. Mondelez (previ­
ously Cadbury) compares the internal performance of its warehouse with 
that of its third-party logistics providers. If you are looking to compare 
performance with your competitors, you need to choose carefully. At the 
end of this section there is a list of specific supply chain and logistics bench­
marking clubs you can join to share data and best practice.
A point to note here is that accurate benchmarking relies on companies 
being open, honest, willing to collaborate and respect confidentiality. 
According to Turner (2002), there is a benchmarking code of conduct that 
states: ‘Never ask for something you would not be prepared to share in re­
turn.’
Example
Table 6.6 shows a benchmark exercise for a leisure clothing producer. As 
can be seen, most companies provided comprehensive information, with a 
few exceptions. The companies were all able to measure their own perfor­
mance against their peers and concentrate on their areas of weakness, be it 
stock turn, items picked per hour or cost as a percentage of sales.
A word of warning: not every competitor or peer for that matter will 
have exactly the same product and order profile, for example, and therefore 
an exact comparison is rarely achievable.

6.8  DMAIC: a process improvement tool
Introduction
The DMAIC tool tends to be synonymous with Six Sigma. The tool is used 
to identify problems, develop ideas on how to improve the process, produce 
a solution and finally ensure that the fix is sustainable. DMAIC is not exclu­
sive to Six Sigma and can be used as a framework for other improvement 
applications.
DMAIC stands for Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve and Control. All 
of these steps are necessary and are undertaken in that order (see Figure 6.4):
1	 Define. Document what is known about the problem, assess and clarify 
the facts, set objectives and put together a project team to work on the 
problem.

2	 Measure. Decide what is to be measured and how to measure it. Ensure 
that the measures are specific, the data easy to collect and monitor. At this 
stage the process needs to be tested to ensure feasibility.
3	 Analyse. The data collected are analysed to determine the root cause of 
the problem. A gap analysis can be undertaken to identify differences 
between current performance and the target performance.
4	 Improve. At this stage, ideas for improvement can be discussed. The most 
feasible ideas can be tested and the most effective idea introduced.
5	 Control. Finally, once introduced, the improvements need to be monitored 
to ensure continued success.
Process documents need to be produced together with a system of continuous 
improvement. At this stage, the new ideas can be shared and, as in the 8-D 
model (see tool 8.4), the project team should be recognized for their efforts.

When to use
This tool is used to identify problems and form ideas on how to solve them 
and ensure that there is no recurrence.
How to use
Let’s take achieving ‘Daily cycle counting for 98–100 per cent inventory re­
cords accuracy’ as the project at hand:
1	 Define what our goal is: 98–100 per cent daily inventory records accuracy.
2	 Measure where we are now: take a sample cycle count of a mixture of A, 
B, C and D items.
3	 Divide the total count into the amount correct: let’s say 10 items were 
counted and six were correct = 60 per cent inventory records accuracy for 
this trial count. This is far from good enough.
4	 Analyse: why were four counts incorrect? Analyse the transaction detail 
in the warehouse management system (WMS) to find the root causes for 
the four variances: warehouse counts to computer counts.
5	 Improve: improve through daily cycle counting of A, B, C and D items 
throughout the warehouse. As you find root-cause errors, do a root-cause 
error frequency distribution and eliminate these root causes by writing 
standard operating procedures (SOPs).
You should be holding steady at 98–100 per cent daily inventory records 
accuracy if you follow this proven system.
The key now is C = Control. You must maintain and control this 98–100 
per cent inventory records accuracy level through daily cycle counting and 
root-cause analysis. This control step is the most critical step. You can reach 
this point, but it has to be maintained and controlled. When you do control 
this level of inventory records accuracy, you can consider eliminating the 
annual wall-to-wall physical inventory count if this is also agreed with your 
auditors.

6.9  SWOT analysis
Introduction
Undertaking a SWOT analysis enables companies to identify their Strengths, 
Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. Strengths and weaknesses tend to 
concentrate on the internal situation, whereas opportunities and threats 
look outside the organization. It is a strategic tool to identify the company’s 
current situation and how it needs to adapt to future challenges.
When to use
When the company is looking to change strategy or make certain strategic 
decisions as a result of a performance issue, an acquisition, governmental 
intervention or in response to a change in the market.
How to use
The first step is to assemble a group of people to identify the strengths and 
weaknesses of the company, and potential and existing opportunities and 
threats. The group should be cross-functional and all points should be con­
sidered and evaluated. This can be done through brainstorming (see tool 8.1).
The next step is to draw out a four-box grid as shown in Table 6.7. This 
grid can be used to record the points discussed. Continue the discussion 
until the list is exhausted for all four areas. As for a number of the other 
tools, honesty and openness are vital for the success of this exercise.
Example
Let us take for example both the US and UK postal services. They are under 
threat from the growth of the internet in terms of a reduction in letters 
posted, but have an opportunity to expand with an increase in e-commerce, 
both business to consumer and consumer to consumer. Table 6.7 shows an 
example of a SWOT analysis for these corporations. As can be seen in the 
table, a threat could potentially be an opportunity, such as the possibility of 
being privatized.

Financial 
management 
tools and ratios
Introduction
These tools can be utilized in all aspects of logistics and supply chain. The 
examples provided are all related to logistics.
7.1  Activity-based costing (ABC) 
and time-driven activity-based 
costing (TDABC)
Introduction
ABC is a financial cost accounting model. It differs from traditional finance 
models as it attempts to allocate all costs, including overheads, directly to 
each product, activity or customer.
Traditional cost accountancy models allocate indirect costs or overheads 
on the basis of volume or as a percentage of total direct cost. In a traditional 
costing model, all products and customers are allocated the same percentage 
overhead, such as management time spent on them, irrespective of activity. 
As a result, low-volume products and smaller customers are not always al­
located the true cost of producing or servicing them. This can result in un­
der-priced products and customers being either under- or overcharged. This 
became very apparent to the author when he became customer services 
manager for a leading 3PL. With over 25 clients, it always seemed to be the 
smallest client that took up a large percentage of time, rather than the large 
corporate clients – yet the same percentage costs were spread across the 
clients, based on their volume of business.

395
As ABC assigns the cost of each activity in an organization to all prod­
ucts, services and customers according to the actual consumption of the re­
source, this becomes more difficult when we look to allocate costs such as 
the human resources, finance, sales and marketing, IT, and health and safety 
departments.
The main drawback to ABC is the time it takes to gather all of the infor­
mation and to accurately allocate the indirect and overhead costs. A further 
drawback is the fact that not all costs can be allocated precisely. With this in 
mind, Kaplan and Anderson (2004) came up with time-driven activity-based 
costing, which will be discussed in the last section of this tool.
When to use
This tool is for companies that want to be more accurate in terms of allocat­
ing costs. It can also be used to identify non-value-adding processes such as 
relabelling or double checking. Time-driven ABC also highlights available 
capacity and areas for productivity improvements.
How to use
To illustrate the tool we have used the example of a shared user third-party 
warehouse. First, we need to gather the overall cost of the business by 
­category:
1	 Identify the major elements of cost within the company:
a	 Labour (direct and indirect)
–– Salary, overtime, NHI, pension, insurance, PPE, holiday pay, sick 
pay, training
–– Agency labour
b	 Equipment
–– Fork-lift truck, lease or rental, depreciation and interest, 
maintenance, energy
–– Automated equipment depreciation and interest
–– Cleaning equipment, stretch-wrap machines
–– Scanners, voice units, pick to light systems depreciation and 
interest
–– Pallets and packaging material

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
396
c	 Storage
–– Facility – lease, rent or depreciation and interest, rates, taxation, 
insurance, maintenance, landscaping, cleaning, security, sprinkler 
depreciation and maintenance, alarms, pest control, waste disposal
–– Equipment – rack and shelving depreciation, maintenance, 
inspection
d	 Utilities
–– Heat, air conditioning, lighting, water
e	 Overheads
–– Management, supervision, administration, office equipment 
depreciation and interest, IT hardware and software rental or 
depreciation and interest, maintenance, training, communication 
costs, legal and professional, taxation and licences, travel 
expenses, insurance and claims, claim losses due to damages, 
shortages, errors
2	 Identify and define the relevant activities carried out in the company:
a	 In-handling
b	 Put-away
c	 Storage
d	 Order picking
e	 Replenishment
f	
Value-adding services
g	 Dispatch
3	 Determine the relationships between activities and costs.
4	 Identify cost drivers to assign costs to activities. These can include number 
of pallets stored, orders processed, pallets received, etc.
5	 Any costs that cannot be attributed to specific activities should be pooled 
together with other one-off costs, such as donations to charity, and 
termed residual costs.
Points to note here are that the cost of collecting, analysing and allocating 
the data should not outweigh the benefits, and that allocation within 5–10 
per cent is acceptable in the initial stages.
Finally, when asked how much time staff spend on activities, they neglect 
to mention the idle time, including breaks, waiting for instructions, delays, etc.

Financial management tools and ratios
397
This needs to be addressed by examining the warehouse management or 
­labour management systems or undertaking time-and-motion studies.
Example
In the standard ABC model the information shown in Table 7.1 applies for 
a warehouse with a total cost of £3,500,000.
In terms of the traditional costing model, it is likely that the IT and tele­
coms cost will have been combined with the support costs and allocated 
equally across all of the activities. As we can see in Table 7.1, the support 
costs are allocated based on the time involved on each activity by the sup­
port staff.
Having calculated the total cost by activity, we can now identify the cost 
drivers. For example, in terms of in-handling we can choose the number of 
pallets and/or cases received, and for order pick we can use the number of 
orders processed or the number of cases picked. In the case of in-handling, 
if both pallets and loose cartons are received the cost will need to be broken 
down further, as shown in Table 7.2.
Time-driven ABC
In time-driven ABC (TDABC), Kaplan and Anderson (2004) have come up 
with a simpler version of ABC. They suggest that managers need to work 
out the resource required to service a transaction, product or customer. We 
therefore need to know the cost in time units (and space if we are discussing 
warehouses) and the time taken per activity.
First, we need to estimate the actual productive time of the staff. This can 
be done by interrogating WMS and LMS systems or initially producing a 
guesstimate. For example, where staff are working a 45-hour week we can 
guesstimate their productive time at 80 per cent of the total available hours. 
This equates to 36 hours per week.
When reporting the time it takes to undertake a task, it is unlikely that 
staff will include such things as delays, preparation time and breaks, either 
scheduled or non-scheduled. We therefore need to check the WMS system 
again or undertake a time-and-motion study for the various tasks. In terms 
of the in-handling example, we end up with Table 7.3, based on the time 
taken to undertake each of the tasks.

If we base our calculations on five staff members, we have a productive time of 
36 hours × 5 staff × 52 weeks × 60 minutes, which gives us a cost per minute of 
£371,200/561,600 = £0.66. In Table 7.3 we see that the cost per unit is lower 
than in the traditional ABC method and we end up with £55,390 of unallocated 
costs and 1,385 spare hours. Based on the above figures, we know that we have 
additional capacity for increased volumes and additional clients. We can also 
determine whether, by further increasing productivity, we can reduce the head­
count by at least one person.
Figure 7.1 shows that a percentage of support costs/overheads and some 
of the unallocated activity costs end up as residual cost, and therefore they 
are not allocated to specific products or customers unfairly, as they would 
be in a traditional overhead allocation system. These costs become indirect 
until they are reduced, removed or allocated to new customers.

7.2  Calculating return on investment 
and payback period
Introduction
Return on investment is a financial measure used widely within companies 
to decide whether investment in an asset such as technology, machinery or 
software is going to be cost-effective and how long the payback period is 
likely to be. The tool can also be used to compare investment in different 
projects, thus enabling the company to decide on the most efficient and cost-
effective investment. The higher the ROI and the shorter the payback period, 
the more attractive the investment.
When to use
When you are contemplating the introduction of new equipment or technol­
ogy to improve processes and/or reduce cost.

Financial management tools and ratios
401
Seeking improvements in a process can require investment in new equip­
ment, technology or software. As a manager you are likely to need to justify 
such an investment. You will therefore need to know the cost of the en­
hancement along with other costs such as training, annual maintenance, loss 
of performance during implementation, etc, together with the potential sav­
ings and, once calculated, the time frame for the return on your investment.
ROI time-frame expectations are reducing and therefore the more accu­
rate the report and the shorter the time frame, the more likely the invest­
ment is going to be considered.
How to use
When deciding to introduce a new solution into the business you need to 
understand the total costs of the project. This not only includes the cost of 
the hardware and software but also the cost of implementation, staff costs, 
training and peripherals. You also need to know what your operation is 
achieving at present (the base case) without the enhancement and what it is 
likely to achieve once the enhancement has been introduced. Having calcu­
lated these figures, you can then work out what your savings are and, as a 
result, your ROI and the timescale over which the new system will pay for 
itself.
Example
During a recent voice picking trial a client calculated that its ROI, by replac­
ing barcode scan picking, was approximately 25.4 per cent in the first year, 
with a payback period of nine and a half months. The method of calculation 
was as follows:
(Gain from investment [or savings made]
cost of investment
−
)
Cost of investment
100
×
A similar calculation was the payback period. This is calculated by dividing 
the net investment by the benefit accrued. This basically measures how long 
an investment takes to pay for itself. It does have drawbacks, however, as it 
does not properly take into account finance costs and opportunity costs,

­opportunity cost being what must be given up (the next best alternative) as 
a result of the decision. The figures were as follows:
Pick productivity savings
£52,800
Increased accuracy savings
£33,600
Total savings (TS)
£86,400
Investment in voice (I)
£68,900
Therefore (£86,400 − £68,900)/68,900 = 25.4%
 
Payback period = £68,900/£86,400 × 12 months = 9.6 months
 
This isn’t a totally accurate picture as no account was taken of the extra 
training costs and the effect on the business during the early stages of imple­
mentation, etc. However, as the voice system is likely to last at least five 
years, this looks like a good investment.
A risk analysis should also be undertaken to confirm that these potential 
savings are accurate and can be achieved with the introduction of voice. 
This gives the company a reasonably accurate picture of the potential ROI 
achieved through the introduction of voice technology.
One drawback of using payback period as a method of choosing which 
investment to go for is that it doesn’t take into account the cash flow outside 
the payback period, as is illustrated in Table 7.4. Project A has the shortest 
payback period; however, projects B and C have the greatest profit/saving.

7.3  An engineered approach to calculate 
equipment ROI, by Aaron Lininger
Introduction
Too many companies buy warehouse equipment and technology on a ‘best 
case’ scenario. Using an ‘engineered’ approach to evaluating the ROI pro­
vides a more accurate picture of cost and productivity benefits. This is an 
alternative to the method discussed in tool 7.2.
Many investments fail to deliver promised gains because vendors’ initial 
estimates of cost and productivity benefits are often based on a ‘best case’ 
scenario. Those estimates often prove to be inaccurate because each facility 
has unique physical, process and data constraints, making it difficult to de­
termine what a new technology or piece of equipment can accomplish in a 
particular environment.
An ‘engineered’ approach is a more effective method for evaluating po­
tential capital investments. It entails studying the current state of opera­
tions at a ‘micro’ level and pinpointing the specific elements affected by 
introducing a new technology. The degree to which each element will be 
affected can be assessed using work-study techniques and/or realistic esti­
mates made by experts. This approach develops a savings estimate 
­reflecting the reality of a particular facility, thereby improving a company’s 
insight into bottom-line impacts of cost-saving initiatives and reducing the 
potential for costly ­mistakes.

When to use
When contemplating the purchase of new technology or equipment.
How to use
Step 1
Identify specific aspects of an operation the company is targeting for im­
provement, and how each will change as a result of introducing new tech­
nology or equipment.
Step 2
Consider how this solution will impact other areas of the operation, both 
upstream and downstream processes, as well as maintenance and support 
functions – if at all.
Step 3
Consider the impact on a facility’s physical layout and traffic patterns. For 
example:
●
●Can the equipment be positioned so as not to impede the traffic flow?
●
●How will the equipment interact with other pieces of equipment in the 
workspace?
●
●Will the pre- and post-trip inspections or preventive maintenance 
programmes need to be modified and/or introduced to ensure the safety 
of those working with it or in its vicinity?
Step 4
Understand the degree of reliability the new solution must have and the 
maintenance needed to support the new solution.
Step 5
Gather a baseline value (often measured in time for labour savings) for each 
step of the task being examined. Each step is broken into smaller steps called 
elements. Elements unaffected by the new technology can be ignored, allow­
ing the buyer to isolate the true differences between the operation before 
and after the new solution has been implemented. Methods of collecting the

times to carry out each element include stopwatch studies and time-and-
motion studies.
Step 6
Project how each element will be affected after implementation. Under 
ideal circumstances, a potential buyer would introduce the equipment or 
technology into a facility, train individuals in how to employ it, and then 
study how it performs and what impact it has in the environment in which 
it will actually be used. Testing the solution at a facility can reveal unfore­
seen pitfalls and shortcomings as well as provide fact-based information 
for subsequent discussions with the vendor. Because many capital invest­
ments are large and complex, it may not be possible to test them like this. 
In such cases, simulation models can be used; however, it is imperative to 
document all assumptions as they will form the framework for any conclu­
sions drawn from the data.
Step 7
Calculate the differences and apply them to the labour model and affected 
processes in order to determine the new solution’s cost and productivity 
implications (see Table 7.5).
Example
The management team of Company A’s distribution centre (DC) attended a 
trade show where a vendor was showcasing a new electric pallet jack that 
automatically advances to its next location without the operator touching 
the controls. Company A’s DC uses pallet jacks during order selection (pick­
ing), which is the largest use of labour in the facility. The vendor claims that 
its automatic pallet jack will improve productivity in order selection by up 
to 30 per cent by eliminating the steps operators take to return to the equip­
ment controls, allowing them to walk directly to their next location.
When scaled to its facility, the 30 per cent productivity improvement 
represented huge financial savings for Company A; even achieving one-third 
of that would be worth serious consideration. Before making a large capital 
expenditure, the company opted to take an engineered approach to evaluat­
ing the technology.

The company already had baseline numbers for the potentially impacted 
areas:
●
●the steps to and from the pallet jack to the pick location;
●
●the steps from the case-placement location back to the equipment 
controls;
●
●grasping of the controls;
●
●the acceleration constant for their fleet of equipment.
The vendor allowed Company A to test one of the automated pallet jacks 
at its facility to help in the decision-making process and hopefully close 
the sale. Company A invested several weeks in training an individual so 
that the pallet jack would be operated as the vendor intended. An engineer 
then studied the equipment under normal operating conditions, focusing 
on generating values for the affected elements of the picking process. In 
studying the new equipment, the engineer discovered an additional factor 
to consider: a system-response delay before the equipment moves forward. 
Table 7.5 shows a summary of the values collected.
The element values indicate that potential savings exist but overall sav­
ings cannot be determined until the appropriate frequency of occurrence for 
each element is applied to each value. In the absence of simulation capabili­
ties in a labour management system, the frequencies can be calculated using 
the following:
●
●total cases selected;
●
●total locations visited;
●
●percentage of cases selected after short travel (from 9 feet to 40 feet (2.77 
to 12.31 metres) between selection bays; manual travel will still be used 
for longer distances);
●
●percentage of locations visited after short travel (from 9 feet to 40 feet 
between selection bays).
Once the company calculated those frequencies and knew the elemental 
times, it simply had to ‘do the maths’: see Table 7.5. Several factors were not 
considered in this calculation, including maintenance-support hours and the 
impact on congestion delays. With these factors excluded, the values shown 
represent a ‘best case’ scenario. Based on the cost of the additional invest­
ment in this technology, the results of the study would need to yield at least 
a 10 per cent saving to justify serious consideration of such an investment.

After calculating a solid value of the projected labour gains, the manage­
ment team decided not to purchase the equipment unless the vendor was 
able to significantly reduce the price or further enhance the equipment to 
provide additional gains at the same price. The vendor’s projected gains of 
30 per cent were actually closer to 20 per cent and new pallet jacks would 
only affect 25 per cent of the total labour component of order picking, thus 
bringing down the overall savings into the neighbourhood of 5 per cent. 
Other factors not included in the trial results include improved health and 
safety of the operators.
This methodology can also be used for increased accuracy in resource 
planning (see tool 1.8).

7.4  Supply chain financial ratios 
and metrics
Introduction
An understanding of finance is essential for the majority of managers in to­
day’s business world. Supply chain and logistics is no exception so we have 
put together a list of financial ratios that can impact supply chain opera­
tions.
Financial ratios are used as a tool to analyse the financial situation of your 
business through its financial statements. The following ratios and metrics 
are used substantially within the supply chain.
Return on assets (ROA)
This ratio determines how efficiently assets are being used to generate in­
come; it is expressed as a percentage. A high return on assets can suggest a 
rapid turnover of assets or a high profit margin, or both.
ROA= Net profit before income tax
Total assets ´ 100

Financial management tools and ratios
409
Return on capital employed (ROCE)
ROCE can be calculated in a number of different ways. Calculations can be 
made with actual figures or averages. It has the advantage of being simple to 
use but it doesn’t take into account the timing of cash flows. ROCE is 
­calculated as follows:
●
●Average profit before interest and tax (PBIT)/Capital employed × 100.
●
●Where PBIT or operating profit is defined as sales minus operating 
expenses before the payment of interest and taxes.
●
●Where capital employed (CE) is defined as share capital plus reserves plus 
long-term loans or fixed assets plus working capital (net current assets).
For a specific investment of, say, $120,000 and average profit returned over 
a period of 5 years of $24,000, we get a ROCE figure of 20 per cent.
Discounted cash flow and net present value/internal 
rate of return
According to Marsh (2013), these are the most widely used methods of in­
vestment appraisal as they take into account the timing of cash flows. As 
money changes value over time, we need a method that takes account of this.
The net present value (NPV) calculation compares the price of the invest­
ment to the level of future savings that it will provide. One simple example 
of an NPV calculation is to consider whether you would rather have $100 
today or $120 a year from today. To arrive at an answer in this example, you 
would have to decide how much interest could be earned in a year on the 
$100. If you could earn more than 20 per cent you would accept the $100 
today, because your earnings after one year would be greater than the $120 
you would otherwise receive.
To calculate the NPV on an investment, several pieces of information are 
needed. First, determine the total cost of the project. Second, calculate the 
annual savings for at least the first four years after implementation. Finally, 
determine the rate of return required by the company on capital investments.
Example
Assume you spend $300,000 today for a WMS that will provide estimated 
savings of $100,000 in the first year and $150,000 in years two to four. 
Note that the present-day value of these savings is less than $100,000 and

410
$150,000, respectively. Your objective in calculating the NPV is to deter­
mine the value of those annual savings today and compare it to present-day 
cost ($300,000).
Assume that your management requires a return of 15 per cent on all 
capital investments. At 15 per cent, the first year’s savings of $100,000 is 
worth $86,960 at the present day. Present-day value of $150,000 savings for 
years two to four are $113,415, $98,625 and $85,770, respectively. Add the 
total savings in today’s dollars and you get $384,770. Because the total sav­
ing in today’s dollars ($384,770) is greater than the total price of the WMS 
($300,000), the investment can be justified.
Operating profit/net profit
PBIT
Sales ×100
Where PBIT = Sales – operating costs. This measures the profit of a company 
before the payment of interest and taxes.
Days payable outstanding
Accounts payable
(Total annual cost of goods sold / 365)
This measures the average number of days a company takes to pay its 
­suppliers.
Days sales outstanding
Accounts receivable
(Annual revenue / 365)
This measures the average number of days it takes a company to collect its 
money from its customers.

411
Inventory turnover ratio
Cost of goods sold
Average inventory value
A low number here may indicate that either your stock is slow moving or 
that there may be problems such as the presence of obsolete stock, low cus­
tomer demand or order quantities are too high for the demand, resulting in 
little or no movement. Low numbers are typical in a spare parts operation 
where stock is held just in case.
Inventory days of supply
Current total inventory value
(Total annual cost of goods sold / 365)
This measures the quantity of inventory on hand in relation to the number 
of days of usage to be covered.
Distribution cost as a percentage of sales
Total distribution costs
Total sales
Total distribution 
×100
costs
Total cost of goods sold ×100
Both these metrics can be used to benchmark against other companies. Total 
distribution costs can include both warehousing and transportation costs. It 
can also be widened to include inbound costs.
Other financial metrics include:
●
●Fixed cost versus variable cost split.
●
●Cost increase versus sales revenue increase.
●
●Inventory value change versus sales value change.
All of these are compared with previous years’ figures.

Problem-solving 
tools
Introduction
These tools can be used in all aspect of logistics and supply chain manage­
ment. All the examples provided relate to logistics.
8.1  Brainstorming
Introduction
Brainstorming is an organized problem-solving discussion. It is when a team 
of people get together to produce ideas for the solution of a problem or for 
a new service or product. A cross-functional team is seen as ideal, as some­
times people are too close to a problem to come up with workable solutions.
When to use
When solutions for a particular problem are hard to come by and it needs a 
team of people to come up with some new ideas or solutions.
How to use
Assemble a group of people together in a room to suggest as many ideas as 
possible in the hope of arriving at a solution to an ongoing problem or for 
a new strategy or service.
Brainstorming is normally seen as a group activity; however, recent re­
search has suggested that individuals should spend time alone, thinking of 
potential solutions before coming together with colleagues to discuss their 
various ideas. This overcomes some of the issues of people being reticent 
about coming forward with ideas in a group environment.

413
All participants  should write down their ideas on Post-it notes and place 
them on a wall or whiteboard. These can be discussed as they’re placed on 
the wall or discussion can take place later (see Figure 8.1).
Method
Turner (2003) proposes the following steps:
1	 Choose a cross-section of people.
2	 Set aside sufficient time with no interruptions.
3	 Clearly state the problem or topic and make sure everyone understands.
4	 Ask each team member to present his or her ideas, one at a time, in 
sequence (team members can pass if they don’t have anything to add).
5	 Record all the ideas exactly as given. No judgements are made until the 
end of the session.
6	 After all the ideas are listed, check for clarification from the team 
members.
7	 When the ideas dry up, it’s time to stop.

8	 The group then examines each idea in turn, expanding on them, 
categorizing them and perhaps combining or eliminating some.
9	 Put time limits on the discussions.
It may be possible to group the ideas and put them under headings that can 
then be used as key areas to take forward (see Figure 8.2).
The rules for brainstorming are:
●
●No criticism of the person, just the idea.
●
●State ideas quickly.
●
●Basic ideas initially.
●
●Don’t worry about stating the obvious.
●
●Don’t worry about repeating ideas.
●
●Link ideas and try to improve on others.
●
●No questions during the session.
●
●Quantity is good.

Once the ideas are exhausted, they are grouped together under specific head­
ings as shown in the affinity diagram example in Figure 8.2. Note that a 
problem can initially be put under multiple headings. By going through a 
process of 5 Whys (see tool 8.3) we can determine exactly where the prob­
lem lies.

8.2  Cause and effect analysis, or fishbone 
or Ishikawa
Introduction
Cause and effect analysis was introduced by Professor Kaoru Ishikawa, a 
quality management guru, in the 1960s. The technique was then published 
in his 1990 book, Introduction to Quality Control. The diagrams created 
with cause and effect analysis are known as Ishikawa diagrams or fishbone 
diagrams (because a completed diagram can look like the skeleton of a fish).
Cause and effect analysis was initially developed for quality control; 
however, it has now been extended into other areas, including problem solv­
ing. For instance, you can use it to:
●
●understand the specific cause of a problem;
●
●uncover holdups in your processes;
●
●discover why and for what reason(s) a specific process isn’t working.
When to use
This tool can be used to think through the causes of a problem that is affect­
ing your operation. It helps you look for the root cause as opposed to the

symptoms. It is based on producing a diagram that gives a visual representa­
tion of the problem. It enables you to consider all the potential factors caus­
ing the problem, not just the more obvious ones. By bringing your team 
­together you are able to brainstorm (see tool 8.1) the problem and produce 
a diagram detailing all the potential factors. We find that being able to visu­
alize a problem is very effective.
How to use
Identify the problem and write it down on the right-hand side of a piece of 
paper or screen (see Figure 8.3). Then decide on the major factors that may 
be contributing to the problem; these can include technology, people, equip­
ment, processes, environment, information, etc. Draw lines at an angle away 
from the horizontal line and record the major factors at the end of each line 
or ‘rib’. Collect the causes within each of the major factors that contribute 
to the effect. Brainstorm by asking each person in the team to provide po­
tential causes and plot them on the ‘ribs’ within each of the major categories.
Use the 5 Whys tool (8.3) to delve deeper into each of the potential causes. 
Discuss how these impact the ultimate problem and concentrate on those

that have the greatest impact. Once the diagram is completed, each area can 
be analysed in detail to find the root cause of the problem.

8.3  The 5 Whys
Introduction
If you are a parent, you will have often heard your children ask why things 
are as they are. They repeat the question until they are satisfied with the 
answer. It’s the same in business. Although called the 5 Whys tool, we need 
to keep asking ‘why’ until we get to the root cause of a problem.
This is a simple problem-solving tool that helps users get to the root 
cause of the problem faster. It can also be used in conjunction with cause 
and effect analysis (tool 8.2). The tool is based on the philosophy that a 
problem provides an opportunity to fully understand the causes and thus 
treat the cause rather than the symptoms.
When to use
The 5 Whys tool attempts to get to the root cause of any particular problem.
How to use
1	 Define the problem, e.g. Customer X is very unhappy.
2	 Put together a cross-functional team of people.
3	 Ask your team why Customer X is very unhappy and capture the 
responses, e.g. we delivered late again.
4	 Ensure that all staff are open and honest with their responses.
5	 Continue to ask why until no more answers can be given, e.g. we didn’t 
finish the pick, we were a person short, we didn’t plan for this volume, we 
were given the wrong volume information.

The Logistics and Supply Chain Toolkit
418
6	 Use the answers to identify the problem and the actions that need to be 
taken, e.g. the sales team got their forecast wrong and we need to discuss 
how this can be improved.
The tool enables you to drill down more than you would normally to find 
the exact cause of the problem. A simple example from Toyota is as follows:
1	 Our forklifts keep breaking down – why?
2	 Shrink wrap gets caught in the drive motors – why?
3	 The warehouse floor gets very messy – why?
4	 The team throw shrink wrap on the floor – why?
5	 They don’t use the bins provided – why?
6	 They are in the wrong locations and constantly full.
7	 Answer: relocate bins and empty more often.
The chart shown in Figure 8.4, adapted from a design by Six Sigma Material, 
is a good way of mapping out the problem and the potential causes. If we 
take the example of the wrong items being sent to a customer, there are a 
number of potential causes. In this diagram we have looked at three poten­
tial areas: people, technology and the environment (in this case the working 
area).
Note that we may need to ask more than five questions to get to the root 
cause of the problem and there could be a number of reasons for the poor 
accuracy. The point is to take this exercise seriously, ask the difficult ques­
tions and get to the bottom of the problem. For example, two of the streams 
in the figure end with the fact that there is no warehouse management sys­
tem, and the reason for this could be a lack of budget. Keep drilling down 
until you can proceed no further. Note that it can also branch off into other 
directions.
To concentrate resources, the following need to take place:
●
●Address each major cause in turn.
●
●Assign one person to the corrective actions of each root cause.
●
●Assign one person to the preventive actions of each root cause.
●
●Agree on a specific completion date for each assignment.
●
●Record all the names of the people involved in the exercise.
●
●Record the date the exercise was completed.

8.4  The 8-D approach
Introduction
8-D is a quality management tool. An 8-D resolution and corrective action 
approach concentrates on resolving problems permanently, with the primary 
objective of preventing any reoccurrence. The premise is to get to the root of 
the problem as soon as possible rather than use a trial-and-error approach to 
problem solving. The 8-D approach provides excellent guidelines, allowing 
us to get to the root of a problem, and provides ways to check that the solu­
tion actually works and that the same problem is unlikely to recur.
When to use
When a potential problem has been identified and it requires a team ap­
proach.
How to use
The 8-D process follows a structured path with an emphasis on document­
ing every stage of the process. It also stresses the need to involve people from 
outside the problem area to get a different perspective.
8-D is especially useful as it results not just in problem solving, through 
utilizing a tried-and-tested process, but also produces an ongoing standard 
and a reporting format that can be utilized in many different circumstances.
It is enhanced as a problem-solving tool by introducing other tools at 
various stages of the process. For example, the 5 Whys tool (tool 8.3) and 
root-cause analysis can be used at stage D4 to discover the root cause of the 
problem. FMEA (failure mode and effects analysis) can be used at stage D5 
to check the effectiveness of the solution.
Figure 8.5 provides a step-by-step guide to the 8-D problem-solving process.

The champion – the owner of the problem who ensures that sufficient resources and
support are provided
The team leader – gets the job done
The writer – ensures the integrity of all the documentation
The time manager – ensures that milestones and tasks are completed on time
The outside expert – possesses vital skills and comes from outside the department
What’s wrong with what?
When did it happen?
Where did it happen?
What is the size and seriousness of the problem?
Buy time until a permanent corrective action is implemented
Protect the customer from the effect(s) of the problem
Contain the problem from a cost, reputation and quality perspective
Verify the root cause – use the 5 Whys approach (see tool 8.3)
Undertake a root cause analysis
Isolate the point in the process where the problem could have been detected and
identified earlier but wasn’t
Identify the best possible PCA so that it doesn’t happen again
Produce a project plan and timetable for implementation
Implement and validate the PCA
Remove the ICA if PCA is working
Monitor the results
Modify the existing systems, policies, practices and processes
Make further recommendations if required
Undertake a before-and-after comparison
Ensure that the documentation is complete
Reward the team members appropriately
Ensure that it is easier to identify the escape point
Produce a timeline for completion

Example
Problem: incorrect delivery to the customer:
D0 – We know we have a problem as the customer has told us so.
D1 – We form a team to investigate the problem:
–– the champion: the owner of the problem who ensures sufficient 
resources and support are provided; in this case the warehouse 
manager;
–– the team leader: gets the job done; in this case the outbound 
supervisor;
–– the writer: ensures the integrity of all the documentation; in this 
case the general manager’s PA;
–– the time manager: ensures milestones and tasks are completed on 
time; in this case the human resources manager;
–– the outside expert: possesses vital skills and comes from outside 
the department; in this case the operations manager.
D2 – Describe the problem. ‘We received a number of calls from clients 
complaining they received the wrong deliveries. This has occurred over 
the last three days. We’re not sure where the issue is but it hasn’t stopped, 
we had another call this morning.’
D3 – Develop an interim containment action. Allocate staff to check every 
order before it leaves the warehouse and record any incorrect orders and 
who picked them.
D4 – Define the root cause and identify the escape point. Use the 5 Whys 
tool (8.3) to discuss the problem and identify possible causes. Could the 
problem have been identified earlier?
D5 – Permanent corrective action (PCA). In this example the error was a 
problem with the use of agency labour and their lack of product 
knowledge. PCA is an induction for all temporary labour, with an 
emphasis on product knowledge and awareness. Key performance 
indicators to be extended to all staff. A time frame of six weeks to 
introduce an abridged version of the company induction programme for 
temporary labour.
D6 – Implement the PCA. Induction scheme for all new and existing 
temporary staff. KPIs set up and monitored for existing and temporary 
staff. Full checks on all orders leaving the warehouse to be removed if 
accuracy levels have improved.

D7 – Prevent reocurrence. Warehouse procedures to include induction for 
all temporary staff prior to deployment.
D8 – Recognizing the effort of the team. Team dinner organized for members 
and partners.
Conclusion: by following through this process, not only is the initial prob­
lem detected but a temporary fix is put in place immediately while a long-
term solution is sought. The final act is to reward all those individuals who 
were involved, both within the team and in the implementation of the final 
solution.
