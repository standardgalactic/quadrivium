About the Author
Danna Korn is also the author of Wheat-Free, Worry-Free: The Art of Happy,
Healthy, Gluten-Free Living and Kids with Celiac Disease: A Family Guide to
Raising Happy, Healthy Gluten-Free Children. Respected as one of the leading
authorities on the gluten-free diet and the medical conditions that benefit
from it, she speaks frequently to health care professionals, celiacs, parents
of celiacs, parents of autistic kids involved in a gluten-free/casein-free dietary
intervention program, and others on or considering a gluten-free diet. She
has been invited twice to be a presenter at the International Symposium on
Celiac Disease.
Danna has been researching celiac disease since her son, Tyler, was diagnosed
with the condition in 1991. That same year, she founded R.O.C.K. (Raising Our
Celiac Kids), a support group for families of children on a gluten-free diet.
Today, Danna leads more than 100 chapters of R.O.C.K. worldwide. She is a
consultant to retailers, manufacturers, testing companies, dietitians, nutrition-
ists, and people newly diagnosed with gluten intolerance and celiac disease.
She also coordinates the International Walk/Run for Celiac Disease each May
in San Diego. 


Dedication
This book is dedicated to the people who have patiently supported my 
sometimes-over-zealous-and-usually-over-the-top efforts as The Glutenator,
singing the praises of a gluten-free lifestyle throughout the land. Most impor-
tantly, to my family and friends, who encourage, inspire, and energize me.
Your support means more to me than you could ever know, and I couldn’t have
written a word without you. And to those of you who embrace or are planning
to embrace the gluten-free lifestyle, I hope I can make a difference, if only a
small one, in your lives by inspiring you to love the gluten-free way of life.
Author’s Acknowledgments
A huge thank-you to the hard-working team at Wiley Publishing. First, thank
you to Mikal Belicove, the acquisitions editor who came up with and promoted
the idea of doing a For Dummies book about the gluten-free lifestyle, and then
held my hand as I learned the ropes of writing in the For Dummies format. To
senior project editor Tim Gallan, thank you for keeping me on track and for
your attention to organization and detail. To both Tim and copy editor Danielle
Voirol, thank you for tolerating my sometimes quirky sense of humor and my
many made-up words. It must have driven your spell-checker crazy. Danielle,
your speedy grasp of the subject, in-depth research, and clever questions were
amazing. Can’t get anything by you, that’s for sure!
I’d like to thank Emily Nolan for testing all of the recipes, and for her tactful
and humorous comments when the dishes I had invented were outrageous
flops (don’t worry, we fixed ‘em!). And thank you to Patty Santelli for nutri-
tional analysis of the recipes.
I’m extremely grateful to my friends and colleagues, Michelle Pietzak, M.D.
and Cynthia Kupper, R.D., for their careful technical review of the book. Both
of you go far and above the “call of duty” in helping the gluten-free commu-
nity each and every day.
A huge thank you to my friend and hero, Alessio Fasano, M.D., who is one of
the biggest fish in the celiac sea. I’m honored that you wrote the foreword for
this book, and am grateful for your phenomenal work in the celiac world.
To the entire gluten-free community, thank you for your steadfast encourage-
ment. You motivate me to be passionate.
And last, but by no means least, I’m incredibly grateful to my family and
friends. After I finished the book before this one, I asked you to slip cyanide
in my coffee if I ever thought about writing another book. Thanks for not
doing that. Seriously, without your patience, encouragement, support, opti-
mism, love and inspiration, I couldn’t have written a word.

Foreword
C
eliac disease is an immune mediated disease characterized by damage of
the small intestinal mucosa caused by the gliadin and glutenin fractions
of wheat gluten and similar proteins of barley and rye in genetically susceptible
subjects. The presence of gluten in these subjects leads to a self-perpetuating
intestinal damage, while the elimination of gluten results in a full mucosal
recovery. 
The clinical manifestations of celiac disease are protean in nature and vary
markedly with the age of the patient, the duration and extent of disease, and
the presence of extra-intestinal pathology. In addition to the classical gastroin-
testinal form, a variety of other clinical manifestations of the disease have been
described, including atypical and asymptomatic forms. 
While in the past celiac disease was typically considered a pediatric condi-
tion, we are now aware that the disease may become clinically manifest after
years of silent intestinal damage following exposure to gluten. Therefore, the
diagnosis of celiac disease can be extremely challenging and currently relies
on a sensitive and specific algorithm that allows the identification of different
manifestations of the disease. Serological tests developed in the last decade
provide a non-invasive tool to screen both individuals at risk for the disease
and the general population. However, the current gold standard for the diag-
nosis of celiac disease remains the histological confirmation of the intestinal
damage in serologically positive individuals.
The keystone treatment of celiac disease patients is a life-long elimination
diet in which food products containing gluten are avoided. While in principle
the treatment appears simple and straightforward, embracing a gluten-free
diet is not an easy enterprise. There are things in life that we do automati-
cally without paying too much attention to them. How many times do we
drive home from work thinking about something else and find ourselves at
the garage door without recalling how we got there? How often do we perform
routine tasks such as tying our shoes, brushing our teeth, or listening to
sounds of nature, and yet, we don’t have any distinct memory of these acts?
For the vast majority of human beings, eating is another automatic activity,
but not for those affected by celiac disease, for which eating is a very engaging
task of their daily routine. A fair amount of mental, physical, and social energy
is devoted to what should be one of the most natural and enjoyable activities.
In the United States, this task has been aggravated in the past by the limited
alternatives to gluten-containing food. All this translates to a monumental
undertaking, particularly for those that have to please the taste of celiac 
children. To make the story even more challenging, the “fast lane” life style

typical of our society, including our food habit (that is, fast food), cannot be
applied to the celiac cuisine.
With this book, Danna is sharing her personal experience as a mother of a
celiac child with her navigated expertise in managing the emotional, social,
personal, and practical aspects of the disease. Her enthusiasm in teaching
how to live with celiac disease in a normal and joyful way makes her the best
“cheerleader” of the celiac community. 
Celiac disease is now becoming a problem of the masses rather than the
uncommon disease of a few. We are experiencing an exponential increase in
the number of people diagnosed with celiac disease. Given the complexity
of the disease and of the proper diet to manage it, we have also witnessed
confusion on what a gluten-free diet consists of. While the professional liter-
ature is abundant on this topic, simple “hands-on” guidelines accessible to
everyone are limited. Danna’s book represents a terrific vehicle to explain in
a simple and practical way how to deal with celiac disease with a smile on
the face. The book is direct, easy to read, and extremely informative for the
newly diagnosed as well as the experienced patient.

Introduction
N
ot so many years ago, the gluten-free lifestyle was reserved for an
obscure cluster of people who were forced to settle for wannabe foods
that resembled sawdust but didn’t taste as good.
Today, the gluten-free lifestyle is sweeping the world with the force of a really
big blowtorch, and the ramifications are enormous. Gluten-free products
abound (and are a far cry from the foods we used to choke down), labels are
far less ambiguous, and people no longer look at you like you have four heads
when you ask for a burger without the bun.
Being gluten-free isn’t about being on a diet. It’s about living a lifestyle.
Whether you’ve been gluten-free for decades or are only considering the idea
of giving up gluten, this book is loaded with information that can impact
every aspect of your life, from the obvious — your health and how you shop,
cook, and eat — to more subtle facets, like finances, socializing, dealing with
friends and family, and managing various emotional ups and downs.
I live a gluten-free lifestyle, and I have for years. I have no ulterior motives,
other than some quirky desire to don a cape, call myself the Glutenator, and
travel far and wide to extol the virtues of a gluten-free diet. Whether you go
gluten-free really doesn’t matter to me. I have no supplements to sell you,
no gluten-free food products that I endorse — I don’t even get paid for run-
ning the world’s largest support organization for gluten-free kids!
What does matter to me is that I do my best to tell you everything you need
to know about living a gluten-free lifestyle so you can make healthy decisions.
This book is the reference guide you need to help you with all those aspects.
It’s your reference for living — and loving — a gluten-free lifestyle.
About This Book
Living Gluten-Free For Dummies, like all For Dummies books, is divided up so
you don’t have to read it all at once, or even front to back, if you don’t want
to. You can skip from B to R to A and even reread B if you want to. You can
read it sideways and standing on your head if you’d like; all you have to do is
find a section you’re interested in and dig in (how’s that for liberating?).

I suggest you peruse the Table of Contents and see whether any particular
chapter or subject really floats your boat, and start there. Or you can flip
through the book and see whether any of the headings catch your interest.
If you’re new to the gluten-free lifestyle and have tons of questions, you’re
probably best off starting at Chapter 1 and working your way through most of
the book in order.
If you’ve been gluten-free for years, do yourself a favor and take a look at
Chapter 4. You may be surprised at some of the foods that are allowed on the
gluten-free diet that used to be considered no-nos. You may find this chapter
opens a lot of cupboard doors that you once thought were closed!
Conventions Used in This Book
To keep things consistent and easy to follow, here are some of the basic
ground rules and conventions this book uses:
 I make words up, but they’re pretty easy to figure out. For instance, 
glutenated means a product’s been contaminated with gluten. Glutenous
means it has gluten in it, glutenivore is something that eats gluten,
Glutenator is one who battles the evils of gluten, and so on. It’s fun!
Before you know it, I’ll bet you’ll be making up your own glutenologisms.
 All Web addresses appear in monofont, which looks like this.
 When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to
break across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that I haven’t
put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So
when using one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see
in this book, pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.
 Feel free to tinker with the recipes. If you don’t have an ingredient a
recipe calls for, don’t worry — make a substitution. You may find your
swap is a huge improvement. And don’t worry if you don’t want to mea-
sure. I estimated the measurements, anyway, because I’m not sure I even
own measuring spoons and cups!
T If you want a vegetarian recipe, just look for the tomato icons.
Here are some conventions for the ingredients themselves:
 If an ingredient appears in a recipe, it’s assumed to be gluten-free. For
instance, I don’t specify “gluten-free vanilla,” because all vanilla is
gluten-free. And soy sauce usually has gluten, but when I call for soy
sauce in a recipe, I’m assuming you’ll use a gluten-free version.

Introduction
 Baking with gluten-free flours works best if you use a mixture of flours.
Chapter 9 goes into detail about how to mix gluten-free flours to get the
best results.
 Milk substitutes can be used in place of milk in most recipes.
 Eggs are large.
 Butter and margarine are interchangeable.
 All temperatures are Fahrenheit.
What You’re Not to Read
You won’t get in trouble if you do read everything, but if you’re a skimmer,
you can skip some stuff and not miss anything important. In other words,
there won’t be a pop quiz on the following:
 Anything that has a Technical Stuff icon: The Technical Stuff icon rep-
resents information that’s interesting (downright fascinating some-
times!) but not crucial to your understanding of the subject matter.
 Sidebars: These are the stories and tidbits of information in shaded
boxes scattered throughout the chapters. Just like the Technical Stuff,
you may find the information interesting, but you won’t be missing criti-
cal information if you skip them.
 Recipes: Unless you’re actually using them to cook or to decide what to
make for dinner, recipes aren’t the best late-night reading material. Feel
free to skip them until you’re ready to whip up some gluten-free goodies.
What I Assume about You
You spent your hard-earned cashola on this book, and that means either you
want to learn more about the gluten-free lifestyle or you’re related to me.
Because my family members already hear way more about this stuff than any
human should have to endure, I’ve written this book with you in mind — and
I’ve taken the liberty of making a few assumptions about you. One or more of
the following should apply:
 You’re considering going gluten-free and will use this book to determine
whether to take the plunge.
 You love someone who’s gluten-free, and you’re so cool that you want to
learn about the lifestyle so you can be supportive.

 You’re new to the diet and are looking for the “manual” that can tell you
how to live a gluten-free lifestyle.
 You’ve been gluten-free for years and want the latest, greatest informa-
tion about dietary guidelines and state-of-the-art research.
 You’re a professional who has gluten-free clients, customers, or patients,
and you want to learn more about the gluten-free lifestyle and the med-
ical conditions that benefit from it.
At the same time, you can make a few assumptions about me and what I tell
you in this book:
 I generally know what I’m talking about. I do live a gluten-free lifestyle
and have been immersed in it since 1991. My experience is worth noting,
because some people who write about gluten-free living aren’t gluten-
free themselves. I assure you, I wasn’t brought on to write this book
because I was bored and looking for a project: I really do live — and 
love — the gluten-free lifestyle (and I have way too many projects, thank
you very much!).
 To the best of my knowledge, the information in this book is correct.
This book has been reviewed by two experts who are extremely knowl-
edgeable in their fields. Michelle Pietzak, M.D., is an expert in celiac dis-
ease and has reviewed this book for medical accuracy. Cynthia Kupper,
R.D., is a dietitian and executive director for the Gluten Intolerance
Group and has reviewed it to make sure I’m in line on the dietary and
lifestyle topics.
 This book is not intended to provide medical advice, so you’re not
allowed to sue me for anything. Please see your physician for further
follow-up if you feel you need it; void where prohibited; all rights
reserved; good only while offer valid; only while supplies last; till death
do us part; and all other legal disclaimers heretofore. There. My hiney is
covered!
How This Book Is Organized
Living Gluten-Free For Dummies is organized so that all the “like” material
goes together. So I don’t repeat too much information, I sometimes include
cross-references to related topics. This book has five parts. Each part has
several chapters, and each chapter is divided into sections. In the following
sections, I explain how the parts are divided up.
4
Living Gluten-Free For Dummies 

Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, 
What, Why, and How
As the name implies, this part dives into the big-picture basics of being
gluten-free. Chapter 1 is an overview. If you read nothing else in this book,
read Chapter 1, because then you’ll at least sound like you know what you’re
talking about. The rest of this part talks about who may want to consider
going gluten-free and why, what you can and can’t eat on the gluten-free diet,
and how to dig a little deeper so you’re sure the foods you’re eating are really
safe for you.
Part II: Planning and Preparing: 
The Preludes to Cooking
Part II takes you to the next level: getting ready to eat. It starts with some
guidance on choosing the most nutritious approach to the gluten-free
lifestyle and then helps you with preparing your kitchen, planning menus,
shopping, and developing the techniques unique to gluten-free cooking that
you’ll want to know before you cook.
Part III: From Menus to Meals: Recipes 
for the Gluten-Free Gastronome
You can find 65 recipes in this part submitted by a not-a-cookbook author:
me. Okay, I admit I made ’em up. And I admit I don’t measure, nor is any one
recipe ever the same the second time around. But my publisher has a real-
live tester on hand to make sure the recipes work, and much to my surprise,
they do! So stop snickering, and start stewing — or baking — or whatever it
is you want to do in the kitchen. Whether you’re a culinary fledgling or a
Martha Stewart protégé, you’ll find these recipes to be simple, delicious,
sometimes impressive, and most definitely gluten-free.
Part IV: Living — and Loving — 
the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7
For some people, the gluten-free lifestyle presents unique social, practical,
and emotional challenges. In this part, I help you figure out ways to handle
some of the practical issues like attending social events; eating at restaurants;

Introduction

traveling; talking with friends and loved ones about your lifestyle; and raising
happy, healthy, gluten-free kids. I also help you deal with some of the emo-
tional challenges that sometimes come up so you can truly learn to love the
gluten-free lifestyle.
Part V: The Part of Tens
What would a For Dummies book be without a Part of Tens? Incomplete,
that’s what, because nearly all For Dummies books have them, and this one’s
no exception. The Part of Tens is a few short chapters, each with (cleverly
enough) ten tips, questions and answers, factoids, and tidbits of information
about the gluten-free lifestyle.
Icons Used in This Book
Some people are more visual than others. That’s why icons are cool. This
book uses several icons, and each has a little tidbit of information associated
with it. Here’s what each icon means:
Cleverly designated as Tips, these are, well, tips that can help you live (and
love!) the gluten-free lifestyle. They include info to help you save time or cut
down on frustration.
Everyone can use a friendly little reminder. The Remember icon is a quick
and easy way to identify some of the more important points that you may
want to make note of throughout the book.
Text flagged with the Warning icon can keep you out of trouble.
Sometimes I get really into the juicy, technical, and scientific stuff. Some of
you will love it; others will be bored to tears. That’s why I put it in its own
area, marked by a Technical Stuff icon, so you can skip it (if you want to)
without missing the gist of what’s going on in that chapter or section.
6
Living Gluten-Free For Dummies 

Where to Go from Here
What I suggest you do at this point is curl up in your comfiest chair and dive
into the book. If you find the section you start with to be boring (puh-lease!)
or for whatever reason it doesn’t pop your cork, then skip it and move on.
If you’re feeling a little down about going gluten-free, I hope my sincere pas-
sion for the gluten-free lifestyle and the healthy benefits that go along with it
touches you by offering comfort, optimism, and inspiration.

Going Gluten-Free:
Who, What, Why,
and How

In this part . . .
I
cover the basics to help get you off and running on the
gluten-free lifestyle. I start by taking a look at the many
medical and psychological conditions that improve on a
gluten-free diet so you can decide whether this lifestyle
can benefit you and can set realistic expectations for how
your health may improve. Then I spell out the basics of
the gluten-free diet and introduce you to foods you may
never have even heard of before, some of which are far
more nutritious than gluten ever wished it could be.
Finally, I tell you how to think outside the ingredients box
so you know what hidden sources of gluten to look for
and how to make sure products are, in fact, gluten-free. So
what are you waiting for? Today may be the first day of
the rest of your new lifestyle.

figured the doctor had made a mistake. “You mean glucose,” I corrected
him with a tinge of exasperation at his clumsy blunder. “You must mean
my son can’t eat glucose.” Geesh. This was going to be tough. No more gummi
bears.
“No, I mean gluten,” he insisted. “And to be honest, I really don’t know much
about the gluten-free diet. You can see our hospital dietitian, but she won’t
have much on the diet, either. You’re going to have to do some homework on
your own.”
All I could muster was a blank stare. What the heck was gluten? Keep in mind
this was 1991, when I knew as much about gluten as I know about piezoelec-
tric polymers. Approximately nothing.
Stranded on some figurative island located somewhere between Terror Bay
and the Dread Sea, I figured I had two options: Tyler could starve to death, or
I could get busy trying to figure out what the heck gluten was all about.
People probably frown on mommies who let kids starve to death.
Al Gore hadn’t invented the Internet yet, and I couldn’t find any books or sup-
port groups; it was time to get resourceful and creative. I was determined to
find out everything I could — and then share it with the world (at least the
other six people on the planet who were gluten-free at the time).

Little did I know that gluten-free-ness would explode into what it is today —
one of the fastest-growing nutritional movements in the world — and this
mission of mine would become all-consuming. This chapter gives you a basic
rundown of what living gluten-free is all about.
What Is Gluten, Anyway?
Gluten has a couple of definitions; one is technically correct but not com-
monly used, and the other is commonly used but not technically correct. I
give you more details on both definitions in Chapter 4, but to get you started
and for the purposes of most of this book, here’s the common definition:
Gluten is a mixture of proteins in wheat, rye, and barley. Oats don’t have
gluten but may be contaminated, so they’re forbidden, too.
Common foods that contain gluten
You can find lots of information about what you can and can’t eat in 
Chapter 4, as well as a detailed listing of safe and forbidden ingredients at
www.celiac.com or other Web sites. But you need to have a general idea of
what kinds of foods have gluten in them so you know what to avoid. Things
with flour in them (white or wheat) are the most common culprits when
you’re avoiding gluten. The following are obvious gluten-glomming foods:
 Bagels
 Beer
 Bread
 Cookies, cakes, and most other baked goods
 Crackers
 Pasta
 Pizza
 Pretzels
But there are not-so-obvious suspects, too, like licorice, cereals, and natural
flavorings. When you’re gluten-free, you get used to reading labels, calling
manufacturers, and digging a little deeper to know for sure what you can and
can’t eat (more on that in Chapter 5).
You have to do without those foods, but you really don’t have to do without.
Food manufacturers make delicious gluten-free versions of just about every
food imaginable these days. I talk more about those and where to buy them
in Chapter 8.
12
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

Wheat-free doesn’t mean gluten-free
You may see lots of labels proudly declaring a product to be wheat-free
(some of which, like spelt and kamut, aren’t really wheat-free at all). That
doesn’t mean the food’s gluten-free.
Gluten is in wheat, but it’s also in rye and barley — and most people don’t eat
oats on the gluten-free diet, either. So something can be wheat-free but still
have other gluten-containing ingredients, like malt, which is usually derived
from barley. In that case, the product’s wheat-free, but it’s not gluten-free.
Discovering the Benefits of 
a Gluten-Free Lifestyle
The gluten-free lifestyle isn’t about your diet. Oh, sure, this book talks about
food, but the diet itself takes up only a few pages. Being gluten-free involves a
lot more than just cutting gluten out of your diet. It affects every aspect of
your life, from how you communicate and with whom, to how you handle
ordering at restaurants, attending social functions, and dealing with emo-
tional challenges.
I believe it’s important to take control of the diet, or if it’s your kids who are
gluten-free, help them gain control. Going gluten-free also gives you an oppor-
tunity to reach out and help others who may be embarking upon the wonder-
ful world of gluten freedom, as well as a chance to discover more about
nutrition and what you’re actually putting in your body on a daily basis. If
that sounds like a lot of work, relax. I guide you through it. And not only can
you feel better, but you can also feel better about yourself!
You have lots of company. The gluten-free movement is sweeping the nation
for lots of reasons, but the one that stands out is that when people give up
gluten, they often feel better. This section tells you what the gluten-free diet
can do for your body — the benefits you can enjoy in addition to all the emo-
tional perks of the lifestyle.
People today live in a quick-fix, panacea-pursuing, pill-popping, make-me-
better-fast society, and if they see promise of a quick way to fix what’s ailin’
them, they’re buyin’ it. Changing both your diet and lifestyle is neither quick
nor easy, but the benefits of going gluten-free can be fantastic — no surgery
or medication required!

Chapter 1: Gluten-Free from A to Z: The Basics of Being Gluten-Free

Eating isn’t supposed to hurt
Food is supposed to give you energy and make you feel good, not make you
hurt. But when you eat things that your body doesn’t like for one reason or
another, it has a sometimes not-so-subtle way of telling you to knock it off.
Food that your body objects to can cause gas, bloating, diarrhea, constipa-
tion, and nausea — and even things that don’t seem to be associated with the
gastrointestinal tract, like headaches, fatigue, depression, joint pain, and res-
piratory distress.
The cool thing about all this is that when you figure out which food or foods
your body doesn’t approve of, you can stop eating them, and then your body
stops being so pouty. In fact, feed it right, and it can make you feel great in
lots of different ways.

Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 
Abstinence makes the gut grow stronger
When gluten is what’s making you sick, what
your symptoms are doesn’t matter; even if your
symptoms don’t seem to be related to your gas-
trointestinal tract, nasty battles are going on
inside your gut.
Hairlike structures called villi are on the lining
of your small intestine. The job of the villi is to
increase the surface area of the small intestine
so it can absorb more nutrients.
For people who have gluten intolerance, the
body sees gluten as a bad guy or toxin and
attacks it. In doing so, it also accidentally
attacks the villi, and those villi get blunted and
shortened, sometimes to the extreme of becom-
ing completely flat.
Flat villi can’t absorb stuff, so those good-for-ya
nutrients just slide right by and you don’t get
enough of the important vitamins, minerals, and
other things that are vital for good physical and
emotional health. You develop what’s called
malabsorption and become poorly nourished.
Don’t worry! This story has a happy ending. Your
villi are tenacious little things, and when you
quit eating gluten, they begin to heal right away.
Before you know it, your villi grow back and
absorb nutrients again, and your health is fully
restored. That’s why I say abstinence makes the
gut grow stronger.
By the way, lactase, which is the enzyme that
breaks down the sugar lactose, is produced in
the tip of the villi. When the villi get blunted,
sometimes your ability to digest lactose
decreases and you become lactose intolerant.
When you quit eating gluten and the villi heal,
you’re usually able to tolerate dairy foods again.

Making nutrition your mission: 
Head-to-toe health benefits
The 12th-century physician Maimonides said, “Man should strive to have his
intestines relaxed all the days of his life.” No doubt! When your intestines
aren’t relaxed — or when they’re downright edgy or uptight — they affect all
your other parts, too. It’s kind of like when you’re in a really good mood and
your best friend is grumpy — the situation can make you grumpy, too; one
cantankerous intestine can be a buzz-kill for the entire body.
In a way, the body’s reaction to gluten doesn’t compute. In some people, eating
gluten can cause headaches, fatigue, joint pain, depression, or infertility; at
first those types of symptoms may seem unrelated to something going on in
your gut, much less something you eat — much less something as common in
your diet as wheat.
But those — and about 250 others — are symptoms of celiac disease and
gluten sensitivity. People with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity do some-
times have gastrointestinal symptoms, but more often the symptoms are
extraintestinal, meaning they take place outside the intestinal tract.
If your body has problems with gluten, the gluten-free diet may help relieve
lots of symptoms, such as
 Fatigue
 Gastrointestinal distress (gas, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting,
heartburn, and acid reflux)
 Headaches (including migraines)
 Inability to concentrate
 Weight gain or weight loss
 Infertility
 Joint, bone, or muscle pain
 Depression
 Respiratory problems
The list’s impressive, isn’t it? The idea that eliminating one thing from your
diet — gluten — could improve so many different conditions is almost hard
to believe. Yet it’s true — and it really makes sense when you realize that if
the food you’re eating is toxic to your body, your body’s going to scream in
lots of different ways.
15
Chapter 1: Gluten-Free from A to Z: The Basics of Being Gluten-Free

In people with gluten intolerance, eating gluten may make the symptoms of
some psychiatric conditions worse. (I talk more about that in Chapter 2, and
you can also find out more at www.gfcfdiet.com or www.autismndi.
com.) Some researchers think removing gluten from the diet can improve the
behaviors of people with
 Autism
 Schizophrenia and other mood disorders
 Attention-deficit (hyperactivity) disorder (ADD/ADHD)
Millions of people have wheat allergies, which are different from gluten sensi-
tivity or celiac disease — and they, too, improve dramatically on a wheat-
free/gluten-free diet.
But beyond the obvious improvement you enjoy if you have an intolerance,
other conditions and symptoms can improve on a wheat-free diet: PMS and
menopausal symptoms, for instance. Eliminating wheat may even slow or
even reverse the signs of aging, reducing wrinkles and improving the tone
and texture of skin.
But I thought wheat was good for me!
Of course you did. Anyone who’s spent more than a day on planet Earth has
been barraged with messages hailing the virtues of wheat — especially in its
whole form! It and other grains hog most of the food pyramid(s), suggesting
you should eat gobs of it, and it’s touted as a good source of fiber and nutri-
ents. Wheat does provide some health benefits, but you can find them in
other food sources, too. So how can wheat be at the root of so many health
problems? Here are some reasons wheat may not be the key to perfect
dietary health.
Wheat was invented yesterday
Wheat wasn’t introduced until the Agricultural Revolution, about 10,000 years
ago — that’s yesterday, evolutionarily speaking. Before that, people ate lean
meats, fish, seafood, nonstarchy vegetables, and fruits.
When wheat came on the scene, it was completely foreign. Human bodies have
to adapt in order to tolerate it, and lots of people don’t tolerate it well at all.
Humans don’t fully digest wheat
Most humans have only one stomach — and one just isn’t enough to digest
wheat. Cows have four stomachs (actually, four chambers within one stom-
ach). That’s why Bessie the Bovine does okay with wheat. It goes from one
stomach to another and another and — well, you get the picture. By the time
it reaches tummy number four, it’s fully digested, and Bessie’s feeling fine.
16
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

Wheat contributes to leaky gut (“Z” is for zonulin)
When people eat wheat, they produce extra amounts of a protein called
zonulin.
The lining of the small intestine is basically a solid wall of cells that most
materials can’t pass through on their own. On the lining of the small intes-
tine, zonulin waits for nutrients to come along. When important vitamins and
minerals are present, zonulin tells the passageways in the intestinal wall to
open so those nutrients can pass into the bloodstream. The blood then car-
ries the nutrients to other parts of the body.
But when some people eat wheat, they produce too much zonulin, and the
gates open too wide. All sorts of stuff gets in the bloodstream, some of which
shouldn’t be there, like toxins. This increased permeability of the lining of
the small intestine, or leaky gut syndrome, can cause lots of different health
issues.
Mastering the Meals
This book is about a lifestyle, not a diet. But no matter where that lifestyle
takes you — eating in, eating out, social events, choosing, planning, shop-
ping, preparing — being gluten-free all comes down to one thing: food.
If you’re a culinary hacker and you’re afraid you’ll have to wake up at 4 a.m.
to bake gluten-free bread and make pasta from scratch, turn off the alarm and
go back to sleep. There are plenty of gluten-free specialty foods available to
take the place of all your old favorites.
Whether you’re a kitchenphobe or a foodie, living a gluten-free lifestyle offers
you an enormous selection of foods and ingredients to choose from.
Planning and preparing
Putting together smart and healthful gluten-free meals is a lot easier if you
plan ahead. Walking through a store, perusing restaurant menus, or (gasp!)
sitting in a bakery with a growling tummy isn’t exactly conducive to making
good food choices.
Give yourself a healthy advantage by planning and even preparing meals in
advance, especially if your busy schedule has you eating away from home fre-
quently. If you know you’re pressed for time at breakfast or lunch, make your
meals the night before, and bring healthful gluten-free snacks in resealable
plastic bags.
17
Chapter 1: Gluten-Free from A to Z: The Basics of Being Gluten-Free

One of the coolest things about adopting a new dietary lifestyle is exploring
new and sometimes unusual or unique foods. You may never have heard of
lots of gluten-free foods and ingredients, many of which not only are gluten-
free and delicious but are also nutritional powerhouses. With the new per-
spective on food that the gluten-free lifestyle can offer you, you may find
yourself inspired to think outside the typical menu plan, exploring unique
and nutritious alternatives.
Shopping shrewdly
The healthiest way to enjoy a gluten-free lifestyle is to eat things you can find
at any grocery store or even a farmer’s market: meat, fish, seafood, fruits, and
nonstarchy vegetables (see Chapter 6). If you want to add canned, processed,
and even junk foods to your shopping list, you can still do most of your shop-
ping at a regular grocery store, and you can even buy generics.
If you hope to enjoy the delicious gluten-free specialty products that are
available these days, you can find them in health food aisles or at health food
stores or specialty shops. Or you can shop in your jammies on one of the
many Internet sites specializing in gluten-free products (if you’re using your
library’s Internet or an Internet café to shop online, I suggest you change out
of your jammies).
Some people worry about the cost of the gluten-free lifestyle, but it doesn’t
have to be more expensive. I talk about eating gluten-free affordably in
Chapter 8.
Kitchen considerations
For the most part, a gluten-free kitchen looks the same as any other kitchen —
without the gluten, of course. You don’t need to go out and buy special gadgets
and tools, and with only a couple of exceptions, which I cover in Chapter 9,
you don’t need two sets of pots, pans, utensils, or storage containers, either.
If you’re sharing a kitchen with gluten, you need to be aware of some contam-
ination issues so you don’t inadvertently glutenate (contaminate with gluten)
a perfectly good gluten-free meal. Keeping your crumbs to yourself isn’t just a
matter of hygiene but can mean the difference between a meal you can eat
and one you can’t.
Some people find having separate areas in the pantry or cupboards for their
gluten-free products helpful. This is an especially good idea if you have gluten-
free kids in the house, because they can see that there are always lots of
things for them to eat and can quickly grab their favorite gluten-free goodies
from their special area.

Cooking outside the recipe box
I believe if you give someone a recipe, you feed ’em for a meal. Show them
how to make anything gluten-free, and you feed ’em for a lifetime. The point
is, you can make anything gluten-free, and you’re not constrained by recipes
or the fact that you can’t use regular flour or breadcrumbs. All you need is a
little creativity and some basic guidelines for using gluten-free substitutions,
which you can find in Chapter 9.
If you’re a die-hard recipe fan, never fear — I give you recipes in Chapters 10
through 15. Most of them are super simple to follow but leave your guests
with the impression that you spent all day in the kitchen (and being thus
indebted, they may volunteer to do the dishes).
Getting Excited about the 
Gluten-Free Lifestyle
Most people who embark on a gluten-free lifestyle are doing so because of
health issues — and that means they have little or no choice in the matter.
When people are forced to make changes in their routine, especially changes
that affect what they can and can’t eat, they’re not always so quick to see the
joy in the adjustments.
If you’re a little gloomy about going from gluten-glommer to gluten-freebie, 
I understand. But prepare yourself to read about the scores of reasons to be
excited about the gluten-free lifestyle (for you impatient types like me, feel
free to skip to Chapters 19 and 20 for a jump-start on the Kumbayah side of
being gluten-free).
“A” is for adapting your 
perspective on food
If you’ve been eating gluten (I believe that would make you a glutenivore) for
a long time — say, for most of your life — then giving up foods as you know
them may seem like a tough transition at first. Besides the obvious practical
challenges of learning to ferret out gluten where it may be hidden, you have
to deal with emotional, physical, social, and even financial challenges.
You have to do only one thing in order to learn to love the gluten-free
lifestyle, and that’s to adjust your perspective on food just a tinge. You really
don’t have to give anything up; you just have to make some modifications.
The foods that used to be your favorites can still be your favorites if you
want them to be, just in a slightly different form.
19
Chapter 1: Gluten-Free from A to Z: The Basics of Being Gluten-Free

Or you may want to consider what may be a new and super-healthful
approach for you: eating lean meats, fresh fruits, and nonstarchy vegetables.
Again, you may have to tweak your perspective a bit before the diet feels nat-
ural to you, but it is, in fact, natural, nutritious, and naturally nutritious. I talk
more about this approach in Chapter 6.
Savoring gluten-free flavors
People who are new to the concept of being gluten-free sometimes comment
that the diet is boring. When I ask what they’re eating, their cuisine routine
usually centers on carrots and rice cakes. Who wouldn’t be bored with that?
That type of a diet is appalling, not appealing.
I love food. I love the flavor, the feeling of being full, the nutritional value it
provides. Most of all, I love to explore foods I’ve never tried before — as long
as they’re gluten-free, of course. I’d never encourage you to endure a diet of
blandiose foods that could double as packing materials.
A healthful, gluten-free diet doesn’t have to be boring or restrictive. You’re
not constrained to eating 32 individual portions of fruits and vegetables each
day, like a rabbit nibbling nervously on carrots. If you enjoy bland foods,
snaps for you. But if you think gluten-free has to be flavor-free, you’re in for a
pleasant surprise.
Getting out and about
You don’t have to let the gluten-free lifestyle hold you back from doing any-
thing you want to do. Well, okay, there are some things you can’t do — like
eat a pizza from the place around the corner or devour a stack of gluten-
laden donuts. But as far as your activities and lifestyle are concerned, you
can — and should — get out and about as you always have.
For the most part, ordering out isn’t as easy as walking into a restaurant and
asking for a gluten-free menu (a girl can dream). But eating at restaurants is
definitely doable; you just need to learn to special order and tune in to conta-
mination concerns. Traveling is a breeze after you master eating at restau-
rants (and get a handle on language considerations if you’re traveling
abroad). Going to social events just requires a little advance planning, and
holidays may barely faze you — after you get the hang of getting out and
about gluten-free style. Chapter 16 gives you more information on this.

Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

Raising kids to love the lifestyle
When we heard that Tyler would have to be gluten-free for the rest of his life,
we were flooded with a bunch of emotions, most of which weren’t very pleas-
ant. At first, we felt burdened and overcome with grief and frustration, and
we longed for the perfectly healthy little baby we thought we were entitled
to. It was easy to focus on what we had lost and all that we’d have to change
in our lives. But making adjustments didn’t take long, and soon we’d learned
not just to live the gluten-free lifestyle — but to love the gluten-free lifestyle.
Most importantly, we wanted Tyler to love the lifestyle. After all, it was his
diet, his life, and his future that would be most impacted. Thankfully, Tyler
does love the gluten-free lifestyle, and your kids can, too.
Lots of ideas are key in raising happy, healthy, gluten-free kids. Some of the
highlights include giving them control of their diet from day one; always
having yummy gluten-free treats on hand; reinforcing the benefits of the
gluten-free lifestyle (if you need some crib notes, see Chapter 19); and always
remembering that they’re learning how to feel about the lifestyle from you.
Promoting an optimistic outlook can instill a positive approach in them.
Chapter 17 deals in detail with raising kids to love the gluten-free lifestyle,
and for even more inspiration and practical advice, see Kids with Celiac
Disease: A Family Guide to Raising Happy, Healthy, Gluten-Free Children, by
yours truly.
Kids are flexible and resilient. Adopting a new lifestyle is usually harder for
the parents than for the child.
Setting realistic expectations
Some people call me PollyDanna because they think I have an unrealistically
optimistic view of the gluten-free lifestyle. It may be optimistic, but it’s not
unrealistic.
Setting reasonable expectations for what things will be like when you adopt a
gluten-free lifestyle is important, because you will encounter challenges, and
you need to prepare to handle them well. Friends, family, and loved ones may
not understand. They may not accommodate your diet when you hope or
expect they will. You may find social events to be overwhelming at first; or
you may get confused or frustrated and feel like giving up on the diet. You
can overcome these trials and come out stronger for them.

Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 
How the gluten-free lifestyle saved my son
I didn’t aspire to do any of this. I was deeply
involved in a successful career, and was a
mommy first and foremost. But today I’m an
accidental author, researcher, and support
group founder who was pushed into the deep
end of the gluten-free pool and realized I
needed to learn to swim. Fast.
Until 1991, my family and I ate a fairly typical
American diet. I tried to keep it nutritious (extra
cheese on the spaghetti to add protein), and I
was aware of the need to limit fat and calories
(scratch the extra cheese), but we didn’t spend
a lot of time worrying about what we ate or the
long-term effects food may have on our bodies.
We pretty much took eating for granted.
All that changed when my first child, Tyler, was
about 9 months old and developed what
seemed to be chronic diarrhea. The pediatrician
chalked it up to the antibiotics Ty was taking for
ear infections and told me to call if it hadn’t
cleared up in a few weeks. Three weeks later, I
was back in the pediatrician’s office. “Yep, he
still has diarrhea,” the doctor declared with
confidence. “Yeah, I know. That’s why I’m here,”
I mumbled with self-restraint worthy of the
Nobel Peace Prize. “Give him foods that will
plug him up like crackers and bread — and call
me if it hasn’t cleared up in a few weeks.”
I waited. Not patiently (patience isn’t my great-
est strength), but I waited. Three weeks later,
after another perfunctory examination of Tyler’s
ears, nose, and throat, the doctor made that
“mmhhhmmm” noise that doctors make when
they figure out the problem. Yay! We were
finally going to get some answers! “Yep. He still
has diarrhea.” All those years of medical school
had really paid off. “Don’t worry about it. He’s
not dehydrated, and he’s in the 75th percentile
for height and weight. It’s nothing to be con-
cerned about.” Gee, could the fact that I practi-
cally infuse him with liquids have anything to do
with the fact that he’s not dehydrated? And does
the fact that he started off in the 99th percentile
and has dropped to the 75th mean anything?
Apparently not. I was instructed not to bring him
back for diarrhea because there was nothing to
be concerned about. If I was going to insist on
bringing him back, I’d be kicked out of that pedi-
atric office. I guess they meant it.
Doctor number two agreed with doctor number
one. After a quick look in the ears, nose, and
throat, he declared that we had a healthy baby
boy. “But what about the diarrhea?” I eeked.
“Really, it’s nothing to worry about. He’s a
healthy height and weight, he’s not dehydrated,
and he looks fine to me,” he chirped as he raced
to his next four-minute appointment. I consid-
ered offering to give Doctor Do-Nothing a close
look at the 22 diarrhea diapers a day that I was
changing but somehow managed to control
myself.
In desperation, we changed doctors again, 
and — long story short — a quick look in the
ears, nose, and throat turned up — you guessed
it — nothing. By this time, Tyler’s belly had
grown hugely distended, his arms and legs had
wasted to skinny little limbs, his hiney had dis-
appeared completely, and his personality had
changed. He had transformed from a lively,
energetic toddler to a listless, irritable, clingy,
and quiet little boy. It had been nearly a year
since the diarrhea first started, and we figured
we were just neurotic first-time parents with a
mellow kid who pooped a lot.
Eventually, we ended up in the hands of doctor
number four. By this time, “realizing” there was
nothing wrong with Tyler, I thought nothing of
dragging a lifeless baby with a Biafra belly into
the pediatrician’s office for a routine visit. After
looking in Tyler’s ears, nose, and throat, he laid
Tyler down on his back and thumped on his belly
like you might thump a honeydew melon to see
whether it’s ripe. “My goodness,” he said with
that I’m-alarmed-but-I’m-a-doctor-and-don’t-
want-to-freak-you-out tone. “What’s going on

This book is the resource you need — wade your way through it, and dog-ear
the pages you want to come back to when you need some practical or emo-
tional reminders for how to deal with difficult issues. If you have an opti-
mistic but realistic approach, you’ll encounter fewer obstacles along the way.
Arming yourself with good information
The good news is that because the gluten-free diet is exploding in popularity,
there’s lots of information about it. The bad news is that not all of it’s accurate.
Be leery of what you hear and read, and check the reliability of the source on
everything. If you find conflicting information — and you will — dig deeper
until you find out which source is right.
I cite a few good sources of information in Chapter 5, and I’m sure you can
find more on your own. Just remember to keep a skeptical eye out for the
good, the bad, and the completely ludicrous.
23
Chapter 1: Gluten-Free from A to Z: The Basics of Being Gluten-Free
with his belly? It’s very distended.” I couldn’t
answer through the tears of relief.
After testing for cystic fibrosis, blood diseases,
and cancer, we finally got the bittersweet diag-
nosis. “Your son has celiac disease.” Huh? Is
that anything like the flu? Surely a few weeks of
antibiotics will wipe it out. “He’ll need to be on
a gluten-free diet for the rest of his life.”
I don’t have room here to give the details of the
rest of the story, but you can read it in my other
books or on my Web sites. Suffice to say that
the words “for the rest of his life” had a huge
impact, and we realized it was time to step up
to the plate and do some research and lifestyle
and attitude adjustments to help ourselves —
and others.
When we heard that Tyler would have to lead a
gluten-free lifestyle, we had come to a fork in
the road. At first, we were devastated, con-
fused, frustrated, and grief-stricken. But 
we knew there was another path we could
choose — a path that would have a more posi-
tive effect on Tyler’s life. As we found out how
to live with the diet and its ramifications, we
worked hard to find a way to turn the adversity
into a positive force in our lives. More than a
decade later, I realize that what we once inter-
preted as misfortune has actually been a huge
blessing in our lives — and most importantly,
Tyler agrees.

S
o you’ve given up — or are considering giving up — gluten. If you’re like
most people, you’re doing so for one of the following reasons:
 A medical professional told you that you have to; your health will
improve if you do.
 You haven’t been to any doctors, but you suspect you’ll feel better on a
gluten-free diet.
 You or your child has behavioral issues, and you believe a gluten-free
diet will help.
 You think it’s chic.
Which group you fall into doesn’t matter — you’re probably right on all
counts. (Except maybe that chic thing, but whatever floats your boat.)
And you’re definitely not alone. Millions of people are going gluten-free for a
variety of reasons, and most of these individuals are seeing dramatic
improvements in their health. The bottom line is that gluten doesn’t sit well
with a lot of people.

That’s because many (some even say most) people have some form of gluten
sensitivity. So you’re thinking, “What exactly does that mean, and can I or
can’t I eat pizza?” Ah, you want to cut to the chase! There’s not always an
easy answer to either one of those questions.
This chapter explains what gluten sensitivity is, how gluten can affect your
body and your behavior, and what tests can help you decide whether you
need to go gluten-free.
Shedding Light on the Gluten-Sensitivity
Spectrum
Gluten sensitivity is a physical sensitivity to gluten — hence the clever name.
It’s not easy to define, because these sensitivities come in a variety of forms.
Think of gluten sensitivities as falling somewhere on a spectrum, ranging
from allergy to disease (see Figure 2-1).
At one end: Allergies
There’s no such a thing as an allergy to gluten, but someone can have aller-
gies to the things that contain gluten: wheat, rye, and barley. In fact, wheat is
one of the most common allergens, affecting millions of people.
These allergies are just like other typical food allergies — the same as an
allergy to strawberries or shellfish, for example. They’re all responses to a
food allergen, and the reaction that someone has to those foods varies from
person to person and from one food to another.

Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

Many food allergies are called IgE-mediated responses to foods. Basically, all
that means is that the immune system is overreacting to a food, treating 
it as a foreign “invader.” IgE just designates a class of immunoglobulin.
Immunoglobulins are proteins that the body makes to help fight against things
it perceives to be threats. IgE’s main evolutionary role has been to protect
the body against parasites, but it also fights other “bad guys,” which is what
it’s doing when you have an allergic reaction to food. The body creates a spe-
cific variation of IgE antibody for each allergen it encounters.
Allergic symptoms can be respiratory, causing coughing, nasal congestion,
sneezing, throat tightness, and even asthma.
Acute allergic reactions to food usually start in the mouth, with tingling, itch-
ing, a metallic taste, and swelling of the tongue and throat. Sometimes symp-
toms are farther down the intestinal tract, causing abdominal pain, muscle
spasms, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Any severe and acute allergic reaction also has the potential to be life threat-
ening, causing anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis — or anaphylactic shock — affects
different organs, and symptoms can include a tingling sensation, swelling in
the mouth or throat, and a metallic taste. Other symptoms can include a feel-
ing of agitation, hives, breathing problems, a drop in blood pressure, and
fainting. Anaphylaxis can sometimes be fatal unless the person having the
allergic reaction receives an epinephrine (adrenaline) injection.
Somewhere in the middle: Gluten 
sensitivity and intolerance
Moving across the spectrum of gluten sensitivity, you go from allergies into
an ambiguous area that a lot of people call sensitivity or intolerance. Often
used interchangeably, the terms sensitivity and intolerance basically mean
that your body doesn’t react well to a particular food and you should avoid
it. Notice I said should, not must.
What is clear is that people who fall in this area have a response to gluten
very similar to a celiac response (which I talk about in the “Identifying
Symptoms of Gluten Sensitivity and Celiac Disease” section in this chapter).
So do they have celiac disease? Maybe. Here’s where things get fuzzy:
 Some people who are diagnosed with gluten sensitivity actually have
celiac disease, but their testing was done improperly or was insufficient
to yield conclusive results.
27
Chapter 2: Going Gluten-Free: Who’s Doing It and Why

 Others may not have celiac disease — yet — but if they continue to eat
gluten, they may develop it (a condition in its early stages like this is
sometimes referred to as subclinical celiac disease).
 And still others may not have celiac disease and may never get it. But
they do have a sensitivity to gluten, and their health improves on a
gluten-free diet.
Symptoms of gluten sensitivity are usually the same as those of celiac dis-
ease, and as with celiac disease, they usually go away on a gluten-free diet.
Testing can help clarify whether you have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.
If you test positive for celiac disease, then that’s what you have. But if you’re
negative for celiac disease, yet your symptoms go away on a gluten-free diet,
you probably have some form of gluten sensitivity. (And to further compli-
cate the issue, you may have celiac disease, with a false negative test result. 
I talk more about this situation in “Getting Tested for Gluten Sensitivity and
Celiac Disease”).
Sadly, because protocol for defining and diagnosing gluten sensitivity isn’t
yet established and there’s very little agreement or awareness of gluten 
sensitivity in the medical community, patients are often told to ignore 
“inconclusive” or confusing test results and to go back to eating their bagels
and pizza. 
Crossing the line: Celiac disease
Somewhere along the way on this gluten-sensitivity spectrum, the ambigu-
ous sensitivity is no longer ambiguous: You have celiac disease. Unlike gluten
sensitivity, celiac disease is well-defined.
Celiac disease is a common (yet often misdiagnosed) genetic intolerance to
gluten. Triggered by eating gluten, the immune system responds by attacking
the gluten molecule, and in so doing, it also attacks your body cells. This is
called an autoimmune response. The disease can develop at any age, in
people of any ethnicity, and it results in damage to the small intestine, which
can cause poor absorption of nutrients. Although the damage occurs in the
gastrointestinal tract, not all symptoms are gastrointestinal in nature. In fact,
symptoms are vast and varied, and they sometimes come and go, which
makes diagnosis difficult.

Identifying Symptoms of Gluten
Sensitivity and Celiac Disease
The symptoms that I describe in this section are accepted as symptoms of
celiac disease, but they’re also symptoms of gluten sensitivity. Notice that
the symptoms affect all different parts of the body. That’s because celiac 
disease is multisystemic; although the actual damage is occurring in the gas-
trointestinal tract — specifically in the small intestine — the symptoms mani-
fest in many different ways.
Gluten sensitivity and celiac disease have hundreds of symptoms, so I can’t
list them all. The following sections give some of the more common ones,
starting with the symptoms that are gastrointestinal in nature.
Going for the gut: Gastrointestinal 
symptoms
Most people think the most common symptoms of celiac disease are gas-
trointestinal in nature — diarrhea, constipation, gas, bloating, reflux, and
even vomiting. These are some of the “classic” — though not the most
common — symptoms of celiac disease:
 Abdominal pain and distension
 Acid reflux
 Bloating
 Constipation
 Diarrhea
 Gas and flatulence
 Greasy, foul-smelling, floating stools
 Nausea
 Vomiting
 Weight loss or weight gain
29
Chapter 2: Going Gluten-Free: Who’s Doing It and Why

Identifying nongastrointestinal symptoms
Interestingly, although gluten sensitivity and celiac disease affect the gut,
most people’s symptoms are not gastrointestinal in nature. People more com-
monly have what are called extraintestinal symptoms, and the list of those is
extensive, topping over 250. This is only a partial listing that includes some
of the more common symptoms:
 Fatigue and weakness (due to iron-deficiency anemia)
 Vitamin and/or mineral deficiencies
 Headaches (including migraines)
 Joint/bone pain
 Depression, irritability, listlessness, and mood disorders
 “Fuzzy brain” or an inability to concentrate
 Infertility
 Abnormal menstrual cycles
 Dental enamel deficiencies and irregularities
 Seizures
 Ataxia (bad balance)
 Nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy)
 Respiratory problems

Flatulence factoids
Farts. Tooties. Butt burps. Trouser coughs.
Flatus. Ask any boy between the ages of 2 and
102, and he’ll tell you that there’s absolutely no
subject on this entire planet that’s funnier than
farts. So what’s the deal with farts, anyway?
Everyone does it (except me), yet some people
deny it (I don’t need to); others, usually those
with a Y chromosome, proudly publicize their
impending arrival (“Fire in the hole!”). The aver-
age person cuts the cheese 14 times a day (I
wonder who counted?), each boasting a distinct
sound effect (or lack thereof) and fragrance.
Farts — all bodily gas emissions, for that 
matter — are caused by the air you swallow
and the fermentation of certain foods by the
bacteria in your digestive system. People gen-
erally make about one to three pints of gas
every day, and less than 1 percent of it smells (I
know some people who are skewing the aver-
age). Speaking of skewing the averages, if
you’re doing more than your fair share of the 14
times per day and suspect you have gluten sen-
sitivity or celiac disease, you may find that the
gluten-free lifestyle significantly diminishes the
flagrant (and not-so-fragrant) farting problem.
So go ahead. Pull my finger.

 Canker sores (apthous ulcers)
 Lactose intolerance
 Eczema/psoriasis (skin conditions; not to be confused with dermatitis
herpetiformis, which I talk about in Chapter 3)
 Rosacea (a skin disorder)
 Acne
 Hashimoto’s disease, Sjögren’s syndrome, lupus erythematosus, and
other autoimmune disorders
 Early onset osteoporosis
 Hair loss (alopecia)
 Bruising easily
 Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)
 Muscle cramping
 Nosebleeds
 Swelling and inflammation
 Night blindness
Celiac disease is related to infertility, spontaneous abortions, menstrual prob-
lems, and intrauterine growth retardation (abnormally slow growth of the
fetus). The incidence of celiac disease in women with unexplained infertility
has been estimated to be as high as 10 percent. In many of those cases, a
gluten-free diet restores fertility. Furthermore, some research shows that
women with fertility issues test positive for celiac disease-related antibodies
at a rate ten times higher than the general population. If you’ve had fertility
problems and you’re pregnant or trying to become pregnant, find out
whether you have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity; if you do, get on a
gluten-free diet right away.

Chapter 2: Going Gluten-Free: Who’s Doing It and Why
When no symptoms are a symptom
Some people have no noticeable symptoms
whatsoever — these people are called asymp-
tomatic. (Truly, though, if they read the list of
250+ symptoms, I’m wondering whether they
could honestly say they have none of them!)
Even though they don’t feel any symptoms,
though, gluten is damaging their small intestine,
which can result in nutritional deficiencies and
associated conditions. These people have it
tough, in terms of both diagnosis and treatment.
They usually get diagnosed because they have
a relative who has celiac disease and they’re
smart enough to know that means they should
be tested, too. As for treatment, they need to be
gluten-free in order to be healthy. But it’s tough
to stay motivated to give up some of your
favorite foods when those foods don’t seem to
make you feel bad!

Spotting symptoms in kids
Kids who have celiac disease tend to have the “classic” gastrointestinal
symptoms of diarrhea or constipation. They may also have some of these
symptoms:
 Inability to concentrate
 Irritability
 ADD/ADHD or autistic-type behaviors (I go into more detail on these
behaviors and their connection to gluten later in this chapter)
 Failure to thrive (in infants and toddlers)
 Short stature or delayed growth
 Delayed onset of puberty
 Weak bones or bone pain
 Abdominal pain and distension
 Nosebleeds
Discovering misdiagnoses and
the missed diagnoses
In Europe, the average time between the onset of symptoms and a diagnosis
of celiac disease is six months. In the U.S., if the diagnosis ever comes, it
takes an average of 11 years after symptoms develop.
A Reader’s Digest article titled “10 Diseases Doctors Miss,” cited celiac dis-
ease as one of the top ten misdiagnosed diseases. For every person diag-
nosed with celiac disease, 140 go undiagnosed. And that doesn’t even
account for the population that has gluten sensitivity (not celiac disease) and
may never know it.
Thankfully, as awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity is increasing,
diagnoses are on the rise, and people are discovering improved health on a
gluten-free diet.

33
Chapter 2: Going Gluten-Free: Who’s Doing It and Why
Why the diagnosis is missed
Gluten sensitivity and celiac disease are
common. They can cause severe problems if
undiagnosed. Yet most people with gluten sen-
sitivity or celiac disease go undiagnosed or mis-
diagnosed. Why are doctors missing the
diagnosis of this common condition? Michelle
Pietzak, M.D., one of the foremost experts on
celiac disease, offers some ideas:
 Physicians aren’t exposed to it enough in
medical school and residency training.
These are critical periods when doctors’
opinions and future practices are molded. If
they don’t hear enough about it during med-
ical school and training, they’re not likely to
look for it after they graduate.
 Some doctors get “continuing medical
information” from drug reps, journal arti-
cles, and conferences. Right now, there
aren’t any drugs for celiac disease, so there
aren’t drug reps strolling into the doctors’
offices and chatting it up. Nor are there
many conferences and journal articles to
bring celiac disease to the forefront, where
it would be more likely to get top-of-mind
awareness during the testing procedures.
 Symptoms are vast and sometimes even
absent. Symptoms of gluten sensitivity and
celiac disease are often quite varied, affect-
ing many different parts of the body, some-
times all at once. Some people don’t seem
to have any symptoms. That makes pin-
pointing a cause difficult.
 Physicians may think the patients are
exaggerating or just plain “crazy.” More
than one person with celiac disease has
been called neurotic or a hypochondriac
because of the many and sometimes dra-
matic symptoms involved. The long laundry
list of symptoms may come across as being
exaggeration or hysteria.
 Physicians may be uncomfortable if they
feel ignorant. Not knowing what’s wrong
with you is difficult for doctors, and if you
come in armed with information about
celiac disease and they don’t know much
about it, they may feel defensive and may
disregard your views and opinions as a
result.
 Routine blood tests don’t pick it up.
Complete blood count (CBC) and chemistry
panels don’t test specifically for celiac dis-
ease or gluten sensitivity. So although a
physician is likely to order CBC and chem-
istry panels for patients with celiac symp-
toms, those panels don’t offer any hints that
a patient may have celiac disease. An
astute physician, though, will see signs in
these panels: Anemia; low potassium,
bicarbonate, and protein levels; and high
liver enzymes are red flags for gluten sen-
sitivity and celiac disease.
 Routine endoscopies and poorly done biop-
sies don’t detect celiac disease. Some
patients think they’ve been tested for celiac
disease because their doctor did an
endoscopy. But an endoscopy without a
biopsy doesn’t detect celiac disease
(although a perceptive physician will see
red-flag warning signs). Even if doctors do a
biopsy, they may miss the diagnosis if they
do the biopsy poorly, or if they don’t take
enough samples, or if the results are read
by someone not knowledgeable about cur-
rent diagnostic procedures.
 Cost-containment in the medical field may
limit testing. Unfortunately, physicians are
limited in some of the testing they can do
because of cost-containment measures in
the health care industry. This limit may
result in insufficient testing or no testing
whatsoever.

But in the meantime, underdiagnosis is still a big problem. Patients are often
misdiagnosed with a variety of maladies before finding out that they really
have celiac disease — easily cured by diet. Common misdiagnoses include
 Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or spastic colon
 Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or fibromyalgia
 Lupus (an autoimmune disease)
 Unexplained anemia
 Migraines or unexplained headaches
 Unexplained infertility
 Psychological issues (hypochondria, depression, anxiety, or neurosis)
 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn’s disease and colitis
 Cancer
 Viral infections (viral gastroenteritis)
 Food allergies or lactose intolerance
 Parasites or other infection
 Gallbladder disease
 Thyroid disease
 Cystic fibrosis (a respiratory disorder)
 Acid reflux
 Diverticulosis (small pouches in the colon where food gets trapped)
 Diabetes
 Eczema or psoriasis (skin conditions)
Blaming the Bread: How 
Gluten Affects Behavior
Rarely considered a culprit in behavioral issues, gluten is sometimes behind
the scenes wreaking havoc on behavior and moods.
“Sorry I haven’t been productive at work lately; I’ve been eating too much
bread,” sounds a bit ridiculous. But really, that’s a valid excuse because
bread — gluten — can affect your behavior in lots of different ways, including
“fuzzy brain” or an inability to concentrate. Some behavioral manifestations
of gluten sensitivity and celiac disease can include
34
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

 Inability to concentrate or focus
 Attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactive disor-
der (ADHD) type behaviors
 Autism
 Depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and mood disorders
 Irritability
 Lack of motivation
Exploring dietary treatment for autism
I think this is one of the most intriguing areas of research concerning the
gluten-free diet. Evidence shows that some people with autism show extraor-
dinary improvement on a gluten-free (and casein-free) diet.
Several well-designed randomized, controlled studies are currently underway
at reputable institutions to offer more-substantive data, but years of anecdo-
tal evidence supports the concept, and I’ve personally met hundreds of
people who have experienced amazing results on the diet.
Although celiac disease and autism may actually be associated, in many
cases, an entirely different mechanism’s at work. Some people with autism
may metabolize gluten and casein (the protein found in milk) into the form of
an opiate — much like heroin. Basically, when they eat gluten and casein,
they’re getting a high off it — and they’re becoming addicted.
35
Chapter 2: Going Gluten-Free: Who’s Doing It and Why
Why food affects mood
Food can affect your mood for lots of reasons,
including the fact that the hormones and neu-
rotransmitters (the chemicals that relay mes-
sages between nerves) in your gut are almost
identical to those in your brain. Some interesting
studies apply specifically to people with gluten
sensitivity or celiac disease, shedding light on
why behavioral disorders may be a symptom of
difficulties with gluten.
People who have problems with absorbing
nutrients (like people with gluten sensitivity 
or celiac disease who are still eating gluten)
often have high levels of adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH) and acetylcholine (Ach). These
are referred to as stress hormones. High levels
of ACTH and Ach interfere with learning and
create anxiety, the desire to escape, a fear of
new or unfamiliar things, and a poor ability to
learn from experiences.
Also, experimental evidence suggests that
people with malabsorption act similarly to
people who have lesions in certain parts of the
brain, like the hypothalamus (which regulates
body processes) and the hippocampus (part 
of the limbic system, which affects mood and
motivation).

This “high” they experience is similar to the high that an opiate user experi-
ences, and it may account for traits typical in autistic kids, such as monoto-
nous body movements (for instance, finger-flicking in front of their eyes,
spinning, and head-banging), as well as being withdrawn and having a fasci-
nation with parts of objects (like fixating on one part of a toy rather than the
toy itself). Also typical of opiate users and autistic kids is the distress they
feel when there are small changes in their environment or routine.
Results on the gluten-free, casein-free diet vary. Some see improvement
within a week — others within a year. Others see no improvement at all. Of
those who report changes in behavior, the changes themselves vary, too.
Some people with autism reflect an ability to sleep through the night; others
become more verbal and interactive; and some are completely “normalized”
on the diet.
There’s definitely some connection between celiac disease and autism,
although exactly what that connection is isn’t clear yet. It’s well-documented
that autistic kids often have gastrointestinal problems, and the frequency of
celiac disease is higher in autistic people than in the general public. Some
researchers have presented alternate hypotheses, including the idea that the
malabsorption that takes place with celiac disease results in a deficiency of
neurotransmitters; with the nerves unable to properly transfer information,
these people may experience autistic behaviors. Several studies are under-
way to determine the relationship between the two conditions.
Autistic kids tend to like a small selection of foods — usually those that are
loaded with gluten and casein. A therapist may be able to help you develop
a plan for introducing new (gluten-free) foods into the diet of an autistic
child. You can search www.autismndi.com to find out more about autism
and diet.
Diminishing depression and 
other mood disorders
Clinical depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and a variety of mood
disorders can sometimes be associated with or exacerbated by gluten sensi-
tivity and celiac disease. Some journal articles even list these mood disorders
as “symptoms” of celiac disease. These conditions sometimes improve on a
gluten-free diet.
Schizophrenia has been associated with celiac disease since the 1960s, when
it was first noted that a gluten- (and dairy-) restricted diet led to improvement
in some institutionalized patients. Interestingly, the same opiate-like chemi-
cals found in the urine of autistic people are often found in schizophrenics.
36
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

Some investigators have noted that the incidence of schizophrenia is higher
in places where wheat is the staple grain than where they normally eat non-
gluten-containing grains. In one study done in the highlands of Papua, New
Guinea, where little or no grain is consumed, only two people out of 65,000
adults could be identified as overtly insane, chronic schizophrenics. In the
coastal area, where wheat is consumed more, the prevalence of schizophre-
nia was about three times higher.
Getting Tested for Gluten Sensitivity 
and Celiac Disease
Testing for gluten sensitivity and celiac disease isn’t an exact science — nor
do “exact scientists” agree on protocol for some of the testing procedures
available today. The most widely accepted testing protocol for celiac disease
includes a blood test followed by an intestinal biopsy.
Blood tests
Blood tests — also called serological tests — look for antibodies that the
body produces when someone with a sensitivity or celiac disease eats gluten.
You have to be eating gluten for an extended length of time before blood test-
ing. If you don’t eat gluten, or haven’t eaten it for long enough, your body
may not produce enough antibodies to show up on the tests, and the results
will seem to show that you’re “normal” — or “negative” for gluten sensitivity
or celiac disease. No one knows for sure exactly how much gluten you need
to be eating, but if you eat the equivalent of about one or two pieces of
gluten-containing bread a day for at least three months, you should have
enough gluten in your system to provide a measurable response. If you have
severe symptoms during that time, consult your physician to see whether
you should continue to eat gluten.
The most comprehensive panel of blood tests that you can get for gluten sen-
sitivity and celiac disease includes five tests for antibodies:
 tTG (anti-tissue transglutaminase)-IgA: This test is very specific to
celiac disease, meaning that if you have a positive tTG, it’s very likely
that you have celiac disease and not another condition.
 EMA (anti-endomysial antibodies)-IgA: This test is also specific to
celiac disease. When it’s positive, especially if tTG is positive too, it’s
extremely likely that you have celiac disease.
37
Chapter 2: Going Gluten-Free: Who’s Doing It and Why

 AGA (antigliadin antibodies)-IgA: The antigliadin tests are less specific
for celiac disease, and these antibodies sometimes show up in other dis-
eases (including gluten sensitivity). AGA-IgA is useful when testing
young symptomatic children, who don’t always produce enough tTG or
EMA for diagnostic purposes.
AGA-IgA is also useful for monitoring compliance on the gluten-free diet
(if it’s still elevated after you’ve been gluten-free for several months,
gluten may be sneaking into your diet). Some people feel that a positive
AGA-IgA indicates gluten sensitivity.
 AGA (antigliadin antibodies)-IgG: This is another antigliadin test (like the
preceding one) and is less specific to celiac disease, but it may be useful
in detecting gluten sensitivity or leaky gut syndrome. Also, if the IgG levels
are highly positive and all the other tests are negative, that may signal
that the patient is IgA-deficient (see the next point for more information
on this), in which case the results of the other tests are erroneous.
 Total serum IgA (total serum, immunoglobulin A): A significant portion
of the population is IgA-deficient, meaning their IgA production is always
lower than normal. Three of the four tests above are IgA-based (the only
one that isn’t IgA-based is antigliadin IgG), so in someone who’s IgA-
deficient, results of those three tests would be falsely low. By measuring
total serum IgA, doctors can determine whether a patient is IgA-deficient
and can compensate when reading the results of the three IgA-based tests.
Any lab can draw the blood, as long as you have an order from a doctor, reg-
istered nurse, chiropractor, or other health care practitioner allowed to order
blood draws.
The lab technicians can get the blood they need for all five of the tests with a
single blood draw. They just have to insert the needle once to fill the vials.
Your results are sent to the doctor who ordered the blood draw, and although
each lab takes a different amount of time to process the results, most take
about two weeks.
Your doctor may order a Reticulin (anti-reticulin antibodies — ARA) test.
This test isn’t nearly as specific as the others mentioned in this section and
isn’t used much anymore for diagnostic purposes.
If one or more of these tests are positive, the results may indicate celiac dis-
ease. Your doctor will probably want to do an intestinal biopsy to confirm the
diagnosis (you can find more information on biopsies in the next section).
38
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

Your doctor may do some other blood tests to evaluate the severity of the
disease and the extent of your malnutrition, malabsorption, and organ
involvement. Doctors may test for
 CBC (complete blood count) to look for anemia and other vitamin/
mineral/enzyme deficiencies
 ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) to evaluate inflammation
 CRP (C-reactive protein) to evaluate inflammation
 CMP (complete metabolic panel) to determine electrolyte, protein, and
calcium levels, as well as to verify the status of the kidney and liver
 Vitamins D, E, and B12 to measure for vitamin deficiencies
 Stool fat levels, to help evaluate malabsorption
Biopsies
In the olden days, the only way to diagnose celiac disease was to do not one,
not two, but three biopsies of the small intestine. Today, biopsies are still
considered the “gold standard” for diagnosing celiac disease, but thanks to
the accuracy of blood tests, the number of biopsies required is far less, and
usually only one is required.
When doctors do a biopsy, they do it by way of an endoscopy: They put a
tube down your throat to the small intestine and then clip samples of the
villi, hairlike structures on the lining of the small intestine. Earlier in this
39
Chapter 2: Going Gluten-Free: Who’s Doing It and Why
Testing for allergies
The RAST test is a blood test that can detect
immunoglobulin E (IgE), which mediates wheat
allergies. But many people have food allergies
that can’t be detected by the RAST test, which
limits its usefulness.
You may have been tested for allergies by
what’s called a “scratch test.” Some people
don’t consider scratch tests reliable in the diag-
nosis of a food allergy. For one thing, some
people who have apparent allergy symptoms in
response to foods they eat don’t react to those
same foods in scratch tests. Another point is
that through the digestion process, your body
changes the food dramatically. Doing the
scratch test with basically “whole” food on your
skin isn’t the same as presenting digested food
to your gut.
You could have the blood test for gluten sensi-
tivity and celiac disease done at the same time
as you have your RAST test done, even though
they’re completely different tests. Ask your
doctor about doing all the tests at once.

chapter, I explain that when people with celiac disease eat gluten, the body
launches an attack and ends up attacking itself, blunting the villi. The biopsy
determines how much blunting, if any, has occurred.
The endoscopy itself and the clipping of the villi aren’t painful. The doctor, a
gastroenterologist, sprays your throat with some numbing medication and
gives you pain-killing medications and a sedative that makes most people
tired enough that they sleep through the procedure. Then he or she inserts a
tube through the mouth into the esophagus, to the stomach, and finally to
the small intestine. Some people have some mild discomfort when the tube is
inserted into their throat, and sometimes people have a mild sore throat after
the procedure.
Like the blood test, you have to be eating gluten for an extended length of
time in order for the biopsies to be accurate.
Here are a few important things to know about a biopsy:
 It’s an invasive procedure, so some risks are involved. Adults are usually
sedated with drugs like Versed (midazolam) and Demerol (meperidine);
children usually require a general anesthetic.
 The doctor should take several biopsy samples. Celiac disease can be
patchy, sometimes affecting one area but not affecting the area right
next to it. Taking several samples maximizes the chance that at least one
will be from an affected area, if there is one.
 Even mild blunting can indicate damage. People used to think that in
order to diagnose celiac disease, there had to be total villous atrophy, or
completely flattened or blunted villi. Today, different degrees of damage
are measured by the Marsh rating system, and even partial blunting indi-
cates damage.
 For the most part, doctors can’t make a diagnosis by doing an
endoscopy alone. Although visual clues can indicate damage due to
celiac disease, biopsies give more definitive answers.
The biopsy samples are sent to a pathologist, who then gives the results to
the gastroenterologist. You should hear back from the gastroenterologist with
the results of your biopsy within three to four days.
Urine tests
The urine peptide test may be valuable in determining whether people with
autism or schizophrenia may benefit from a gluten-free, casein-free diet. The
test looks for peptides in the urine, which are evidence that the body isn’t
properly breaking down proteins like gluten.
40
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

Peptides are chains of amino acids, and proteins are a type of large peptide.
Everyone metabolizes the proteins gluten and casein into peptides called
gliadinomorphin and casomorphin, respectively. In most people, the body fur-
ther breaks down these peptides into amino acids, but in autistic or schizo-
phrenic people, the peptides sometimes remain intact. These peptides, which
can function much like opiate drugs, are usually excreted in the urine.
Doctors look for elevated levels of peptides in the urine peptide test.
The only way these relatively large peptides can get into the bloodstream is if
the gut is extra permeable — as in leaky gut syndrome, a component of celiac
disease that I discuss in Chapter 3. A gluten-free diet discourages the pep-
tides from entering the blood.
Stool tests
At least one lab does home stool-testing for gluten sensitivity, microscopic
colitis, genetic susceptibility, and several other gastrointestinal conditions.
Like the blood test, the stool test looks for the immune system’s reactions to
gluten by detecting the presence of AGA and tTG antibodies.
The lab sends you a convenient container, and then you just do your busi-
ness in it and send it back by overnight mail.
The most established lab doing this testing in the United States is EnteroLab,
and it claims the stool test is more sensitive than the blood test. It asserts
that the immune response to food in gluten-sensitive individuals takes place
in the intestine, and therefore antibodies are easily detectable in the stool,
even before they’re detectable in the blood. Therefore, people with slight sen-
sitivities or people in the early phases of gluten sensitivity would show an
antibody response in stool testing, even if they don’t show a response in
blood tests.
This lab claims these advantages:
 The test is noninvasive.
 You don’t need a doctor’s involvement.
 The test is more sensitive than a blood test.
 You don’t need to have eaten gluten recently for the test to be accurate.
Although stool testing certainly has some exciting and promising implica-
tions and offers some logistical advantages over the other testing methods, it
is not yet considered a standard diagnostic tool for celiac disease.
41
Chapter 2: Going Gluten-Free: Who’s Doing It and Why

Genetic tests
Genetic testing can be done by blood or stool. Doctors look to see whether
someone has the genes associated with celiac disease.
Genetic testing is valuable for ruling out celiac disease, because if your body
doesn’t produce either the protein HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8, there’s a 99 percent
chance you don’t have celiac disease. The test isn’t valuable for predicting
who will get celiac disease, though, because lots of people have these genes
and never develop it. There’s more information about the genetics of celiac
disease in Chapter 3.
Interpreting your test results
Sometimes interpretation of your test results is straightforward — and other
times it’s not even close.
For one thing, there are false negatives and occasionally false positives. False
negatives can be due to several factors:
 Testing is somewhat subjective, and not all labs do it well. Many lab
technicians rarely, if ever, see celiac panels and don’t always do them
properly.
 Different pathologists read biopsies differently. Some, for instance,
believe that mild blunting of the villi indicates celiac disease; others
think celiac disease is a possible diagnosis only if the villi are completely
blunted. Most pathologists today agree that partial villous blunting can
indicate celiac disease.
 Not eating enough gluten prior to testing can affect the amount of anti-
bodies you produce.
 Testing that doesn’t include all five blood tests may leave an antibody
unnoticed.
 IgA deficiency makes the tests come out “normal” or negative, when if
there were no IgA deficiency, they would have been positive.
 About 5 to 10 percent of people don’t produce the antibodies tTG 
and EMA.
 Young children don’t always produce enough antibodies to show a
response. This is especially true for tTG and EMA.
 A compromised immune system may weaken the antibody response.
Although people with celiac disease do not have a compromised
immune system as a result of their condition, illness can weaken their
42
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

immune systems. This can produce lower-than-normal test results on
the IgA-based tests.
 In the very initial stages of sensitivity or disease, you may not have pro-
duced enough antibodies or experienced enough villous blunting — yet.
Celiac disease and gluten sensitivity can be triggered at any age, so just
because you tested negative once doesn’t mean you’re “out of the woods”
forever.
I realize there are endless iterations of the chart I’ve put together for you in
Table 2-1, but I couldn’t possibly include all the various combinations. So for
the most part, tests can be interpreted like this (this chart assumes you’re
not IgA deficient, so IgA-based tests are conclusive):

don’t feel right when they eat gluten. Perhaps you got false negatives — or
maybe gluten just doesn’t sit right with you. Bottom line: If it makes you feel
bad, don’t eat it!
I’ve tested positive! Now what?
If you’ve tested positive, your next step depends on what you tested positive
for. It also depends on whether you had the complete testing panels done.

Chapter 2: Going Gluten-Free: Who’s Doing It and Why

You’re positive for gluten sensitivity
If you actually have gluten sensitivity and not celiac disease, you may be able
to get away with eating gluten from time to time. I can hear you now: Yeah,
I’m thinkin’ I have a gluten sensitivity, not celiac disease. Pass the pizza and
beer, wouldja? You may want to rethink that strategy unless you know for
sure that you’re really negative for celiac disease, because sometimes people
are told they’re gluten sensitive when, in fact, they have celiac disease. If
that’s the case and you do go back to eating gluten, you could be doing some
hefty damage every time you indulge. Ask yourself and your doctor:
 Were all of the tests for celiac disease done? Sometimes doctors don’t
do any of the tests that are specific to celiac disease; they just test for
sensitivity. Other times, they do only one test for celiac disease, which
may not be enough.
 If a child’s being tested, is the child old enough to show an antibody
response? Some of the tests that are specific to celiac disease may not
show accurate results in children 2 and under because their immune
systems aren’t strong enough to produce antibodies. In that case, a child
may appear to be positive for gluten sensitivity but not celiac disease —
when in fact, he or she actually has celiac disease.
 Were the results “iffy” or “inconclusive,” or were they definitive?
Sometimes someone’s celiac-specific antibodies are considered “iffy”
because the results aren’t off-the-charts high. Sometimes these people are
told they don’t have celiac disease, but they do have gluten sensitivity.
If you aren’t sure you can trust your test results, you may want to be tested
again somewhere down the line.
You’re positive for celiac disease
If you’ve been diagnosed with celiac disease, you’re lucky! You know the key
to your better health: A gluten-free lifestyle. Going gluten-free right away is
important. You may make mistakes at first, and that’s okay. Learn from them,
and move on.
Celiac disease is a genetic condition. If you’ve been diagnosed, your family
members need to be tested, too.
You’re positive for wheat allergies
Although the conditions are different, you could have an allergy and a gluten
sensitivity or celiac disease. So if you’re diagnosed with wheat allergies, make
sure you’re also tested for the more global conditions, gluten sensitivity and
celiac disease, to know just what dietary guidelines you need to follow.
44
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

If you’re not positive for those but have only a wheat allergy, then you need
to avoid wheat but can still eat rye and barley. If you suspect you may have
an anaphylactic response, you should consider carrying an EpiPen or other
brand of epinephrine shot that allows you to inject yourself, in case you acci-
dentally eat wheat.
Considering the Risks If You 
Don’t Give Up Gluten
Invariably, at least four groups of people decide they’re going to continue to
eat gluten even if they have problems with it:
 Those who feel like the diet is too restrictive, so they’re not going to
bother trying
 People who don’t feel symptoms or were never properly diagnosed and
figure that cheating from time to time is okay
 People who feel symptoms but figure the discomfort is worth the chance
to enjoy a few beers (or other glutenous favorite) from time to time
 Relatives who refuse to hear anything about gluten
If you fall into one of these categories and refuse to give up gluten even
though you have or suspect you may have gluten sensitivity or celiac dis-
ease, there’s not much anyone can do. But before you finish your donut, at
least read the next two sections, which talk about the conditions that are
associated with celiac disease — and the serious complications that can
arise if you continue to eat gluten.
Looking at associated conditions
Certain conditions are associated with celiac disease, meaning that someone
who has one is more likely to have the other. It’s not always clear which one
developed first (except, for instance, Down syndrome, which people are born
with), but if you don’t give up gluten, your chances of developing some of
these conditions may increase.
Also, if you have one of these conditions but haven’t been tested for gluten
sensitivity or celiac disease, you should be tested, because the two go hand
in hand; the fact that you have one of these diseases is a red flag that you
may also have gluten sensitivity or celiac disease.

Chapter 2: Going Gluten-Free: Who’s Doing It and Why

Autoimmune diseases
Several autoimmune diseases are associated with celiac disease, including
 Addison’s disease (hypoadrenocorticism)
 Autoimmune chronic active hepatitis
 Crohn’s disease
 Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Type 1)
 Myesthenia gravis
 Raynaud’s phenomenon
 Scleroderma
 Sjögren’s syndrome
 Systemic lupus erythematosus
 Thyroid disease (Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s disease)
 Ulcerative colitis
Mood disorders
Some of the mood disorders that are associated with gluten sensitivity and
celiac disease include
 ADD/ADHD
 Autism
 Depression and bipolar disease
Nutritional deficiencies
Because gluten sensitivity and celiac disease affect the small intestine, nutri-
tional deficiencies are associated. In addition to specific vitamin and mineral
deficiencies, people may have
 Anemia
 Osteoporosis, osteopenia, or osteomalacia
Neurological conditions
Some neurological conditions are associated with gluten sensitivity and
celiac disease, including
 Epilepsy and cerebral calcifications
 Brain and spinal cord defects (in newborns born to mothers with celiac
disease who are eating gluten)
 Neurological problems, such as ataxia, neuropathy, tingling, seizures,
and optic myopathy
46
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

Other conditions
Several other conditions are commonly associated with celiac disease,
including
 Cancer (especially intestinal lymphoma)
 Down syndrome
 Internal hemorrhaging
 Organ disorders (of the gallbladder, liver, spleen, or pancreas)
 Tooth enamel defects
 Cystic fibrosis
Type 1 diabetes and celiac disease often go hand in hand. About 6 percent of
people with Type 1 diabetes have celiac disease, but many don’t know it.
People with celiac disease and Type 1 diabetes often find managing blood-
sugar levels is much easier on the gluten-free diet.
The earlier in life you go on a gluten-free diet, the lower your risk of develop-
ing associated conditions. And sometimes symptoms of other autoimmune
diseases, like multiple sclerosis, improve on a gluten-free diet.
Living with compromised health
You may feel perfectly healthy. You may be asymptomatic (have no apparent
symptoms) or have mild symptoms that you barely notice. But if you have
gluten sensitivity or celiac disease and you continue to eat gluten, you’re
doubtlessly compromising your health. Your body is being robbed of impor-
tant nutrients that it needs to function properly and stay strong.
Many people say that they didn’t realize how bad they felt until they went
gluten-free. Then they enjoy such improved and even optimal health that
they realize that eating gluten compromised their health, and they didn’t
even know it.
Healing Begins on Day One
One of the coolest things about going gluten-free when you have gluten 
sensitivity or celiac disease is that you start healing the minute you start
on the diet.
47
Chapter 2: Going Gluten-Free: Who’s Doing It and Why

Most people begin feeling better immediately; some take months to improve;
and some feel better initially but then take a nosedive a few months into the
diet. All these are normal responses to your body’s healing process, and in
the long run, you can look forward to improved health in ways you may not
have even expected.
Although most, if not all, of the intestinal damage caused by gluten is
reversible, some of the prolonged malnutrition and malabsorption issues,
such as short stature and weakened bones, may have long-lasting, if not per-
manent effects. That’s one of the reasons catching gluten sensitivity or celiac
disease early is important — so you can start skipping down the road to
recovery.

luten sensitivity and celiac disease are similar in many ways: symptoms,
treatment, and maybe even some of the testing methods. But because
gluten sensitivity hasn’t been well-defined and celiac disease has, I focus on
celiac disease in this chapter.
Celiac disease has a bunch of names that all mean the same thing, including
sprue, celiac sprue, non-tropical sprue (not to be confused with tropical
sprue), gluten-sensitive enteropathy, Gee-Herter disease, and coeliac disease
(the European spelling).
Three aspects of celiac disease make it uniquely contradictory and intriguing.
These factors interrelate, beckoning a closer look at this complex condition:
 Celiac disease is extremely common but rarely diagnosed.
 If undiagnosed, it can severely compromise your health.
 It’s fully treatable by diet alone.
So just how common is it? Well, since you asked . . .
Exposing One of the Most Common
Genetic Diseases of Mankind
Occurring in nearly 1 percent of the population, celiac disease is one of the
most common genetic diseases of mankind. According to the Center for
Celiac Research, the numbers break down like this:

 As many as 1 in 133 people has celiac disease (most don’t know it).
(Remember, this doesn’t even take into account those who have non-
celiac gluten sensitivity.)
 For people with “classic” symptoms, the incidence is 1 in 40.
 For people with parents or siblings with celiac disease, the incidence is
1 in 20.
 For people who have an aunt, uncle, grandparent, or first cousin with
celiac disease, the incidence is 1 in 40.
To put these numbers in perspective, celiac disease is more common than
Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease,
and cystic fibrosis combined. Check out Table 3-1 to see how celiac disease
measures up.

have it? They do! They just don’t know it yet (and may never know it).

Pinpointing Who Develops 
Celiac Disease and Why
There’s no way to know who will develop celiac disease. What doctors do
know is that you need at least three things in order to develop the condition:
 The genetic predisposition
 A diet that includes gluten
 An environmental trigger
Even if you have all three, you may never develop celiac disease. You can say,
though, that if you’re missing one of these three things, you won’t develop
celiac disease (but you could still have gluten sensitivity).
Celiac disease is a nondiscriminatory condition, found in all races and nation-
alities. It’s commonly thought to be more prevalent in people with Northern
European ancestry, but that distinction is diminishing as people are becom-
ing more diverse and intermingled.
51
Chapter 3: A Closer Look at Celiac Disease
Myths and misconceptions
Some of the things I hear about celiac disease
have about as much truth as the Loch Ness
Monster legend, but without even a grainy pho-
tograph to back it up (no, you don’t “catch it”
from potatoes). Here are some of the more
common myths:
Myth: Celiac disease is rare.
Fact: Celiac disease is one of the world’s most
common genetic diseases, affecting about 1
percent of the population. On top of that, a huge
percentage has gluten sensitivity, which can
produce the same symptoms and possibly have
the same serious repercussions as celiac 
disease.
Myth: Celiac disease is a pediatric condition.
Fact: Actually, celiac disease can be “trig-
gered” at any point in life and more often
appears in the later years.
Myth: Severe gastrointestinal problems, like
diarrhea, are the most common symptoms.
Fact: Most people with celiac disease don’t
have any gastrointestinal symptoms, much less
severe ones — their symptoms are extrain-
testinal, like headaches, fatigue, joint pain,
depression, and feeling overall crummy.

Some people think that civilizations that developed between the Tigris and
Euphrates in the Middle East, where grain was first cultivated, have had
longer to evolve to cope successfully with gluten-containing grains; that’s
why the prevalence of gluten sensitivity among these people is lower. Other
groups, like the Germans, Scandinavians, and Celts of England, Scotland, and
Ireland, began cultivating wheat only in limited amounts in the post-Roman
era. They were mostly hunter-gatherers until the Middle Ages, so those popu-
lations have had less time to adjust to gluten-containing grains.
It’s in the genes
No one knows all the genes that are involved in developing celiac disease, but
researchers do know of two key players: HLA DQ2 and HLA DQ8. You don’t
have to have both — just one will do — and DQ2 is the one seen most often
in people with celiac disease.
But about one-third of the general population has these genes and doesn’t
develop celiac disease — so knowing whether you have these genes is most
valuable if you want to rule out celiac disease. In other words, if you have the
genes, you may or may not develop celiac disease. But if you don’t have
either gene, there’s a 99 percent chance you won’t develop celiac disease
(which has always left me wondering about that 1 percent!). Keep in mind
also that if you don’t have these genes, you can still have non-celiac gluten
sensitivity.
Celiac disease isn’t dominant or recessive — it’s multifactorial or multigenic,
meaning several different types of genes play a part in the development of
the condition.
Triggering celiac disease: What turns it on
People use the word trigger in two ways when they talk about celiac disease.
The first refers to gluten being the “trigger” for initiating a response of the
body’s immune system (you can delve into that more deeply in the next sec-
tion). The type of trigger I’m talking about here is an environmental trigger that
“flips a switch,” so to speak, launching celiac disease into an active mode.
Most people have a pretty clear idea of when their celiac disease got trig-
gered, because in many cases they’re relatively healthy, and then boom! Their
symptoms appear “out of the blue,” and they have no idea why.
52

Common triggers include
 Pregnancy
 Surgery
 Car accident or other physical injury
 Divorce, job loss, a death in the family, or emotional trauma
 Illness
Understanding Celiac Disease and 
What It Does to the Body
Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease (a disease in which the immune
system attacks the body) that gets activated when someone eats gluten. To
help you understand exactly what damage is being done, I review just a tinge
of basic human anatomy, specifically focusing on the gastrointestinal tract. I
keep it brief and easy to understand, and I promise there won’t be a pop quiz.
Some people think that because celiac disease is an autoimmune disease,
someone with celiac disease has a compromised immune system. Not at all!
In fact, the opposite is true — the immune system in people with celiac dis-
ease is working overtime to fight what it perceives to be bad guys — like
gluten.
How your guts are supposed to work
You got guts, but do you know how they work? I can help here. Skipping
approximately dozens of important steps, I start my explanation in the upper
part of the small intestine. The food has already been chewed, swallowed,
passed through the stomach, and broken down by enzymes into nutrients
that the body can use to nourish itself.
The small intestine is lined with hairlike projections called villi. The purpose
of the villi, shown in Figure 3-1, is to increase the surface area of the intestine
so they have more room to absorb important nutrients.
53
Chapter 3: A Closer Look at Celiac Disease

The lining of the small intestine is basically a solid wall. All the cells on the
lining are joined together by tight junctions. When the body is ready to absorb
the nutrients, these tight junctions open the space between cells and let the
good stuff in — but keep the bigger bad stuff, like toxins, out.
How do the tight junctions know how far to open? They have a comrade-in-arms
named zonulin. Zonulin is a protein — its job is to be a gatekeeper, opening the
tight junctions just enough to let the good stuff in but keep the bad stuff out.
How your guts work with celiac disease
When someone with celiac disease eats gluten, everything’s going along just
fine until the gluten reaches the small intestine.
The first thing that goes wrong at this point is that wheat causes the body —
in all humans, not just celiacs — to produce too much of the protein zonulin.
This excess of zonulin causes the junctions between cells in the small intes-
tine to open too much, and next thing you know, there’s a party in the blood-
stream and all sorts of things can get into the bloodstream that shouldn’t be
there — things like toxins and gluten fragments.
When stuff leaks through the intestinal wall that normally shouldn’t be able
to, the condition’s called leaky gut syndrome.
So now, thanks to the excess of zonulin that was released because you ate
gluten, the gluten fragment has made its way into the bloodstream. In people
with celiac disease, the body sees gluten fragments an invaders — toxins that
shouldn’t be there. So it launches an all-out attack against these invaders, 
but — and here’s why celiac disease is called an autoimmune response — the
body also attacks itself.
Figure 3-1:
The villi of
your small
intestine.
54
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

An autoimmune disease is one in which the body’s immune system produces
antibodies that react against normal, healthy tissue (rather than against bac-
teria or viruses), causing inflammation and damage. Celiac disease is unique,
because it’s the only autoimmune disease for which people know the trigger
that sets off the response. A survey from the American Autoimmune Related
Diseases Association found that 45 percent of people eventually diagnosed
with an autoimmune disease were initially labeled as hypochondriacs
because doctors thought they were imagining their symptoms.
Specifically, the body attacks the villi on the lining of the small intestine. As
the villi get chopped down — blunted is the technical term — they can no
longer be as effective in absorbing nutrients. That’s why you see malabsorp-
tion (poor nutrient absorption) and nutritional deficiencies in people with
celiac disease who still eat gluten.
Because the food is just passing through without being absorbed the way it’s
supposed to be, you sometimes see diarrhea. But think about this: The small
intestine is nearly 22 feet long, and damage from celiac disease starts at the
upper part — so there’s lots of small intestine to compensate for the dam-
aged part that’s not able to do its job. That means by the time you have diar-
rhea, you’re usually a very sick puppy.
And now for the pop quiz. Ha! I’m kidding! Really, that little lesson wasn’t so
bad, now, was it? And just think of what a hit you’ll be at cocktail parties now
that you can enrapture your friends with discussions of your villi, zonulin,
and leaky gut syndrome.
55
Chapter 3: A Closer Look at Celiac Disease
Reducing the chance that your 
baby develops celiac disease
New studies show that you may be able to pro-
tect a baby from developing celiac disease later
in life. University of Colorado scientists have
published information indicating that exposing
babies to gluten in the first three months of a
baby’s life increases the risk of celiac disease
fivefold. Their studies indicate that waiting until
the baby is at least six months old decreases
the risk but that waiting beyond seven months
increases the risk again. In other words, the
best time to introduce gluten, according to this
study, is between four and six months old.
Another factor that seems to have an effect on
the development of celiac disease is breast-
feeding. Studies show that breastfeeding longer
than three months may delay the onset of celiac
symptoms and decrease the risk of developing
celiac disease. Gradual introduction of gluten-
containing foods and continuing to breastfeed
while those foods are introduced seem to
reduce the risk of developing celiac disease, as
well.

Scratching the Surface of 
Dermatitis Herpetiformis
Okay, that heading was funny only to me, I’m sure. Dermatitis herpetiformis
(I refer to it as DH from now on) is a severe, itchy, blistering skin condition
often referred to as a “sister” to celiac disease. Everyone with DH has celiac
disease (but not the other way around). Their symptoms are usually just
external — on the skin — but about 20 percent of people with DH also have
intestinal symptoms. A gluten-free diet improves and sometimes completely
clears up the condition.
Usually, the rash starts as groups of red bumps with tiny blisters on top, but
they itch so intensely that people usually scratch them to the point of open-
ing the blisters, which then crust over. They occur commonly on the elbows,
knees, butt, back of the neck, and scalp but can also be on the face, trunk,
and other parts of the arms and legs.
To diagnose DH, doctors take a biopsy of the skin near (but not in) the lesion.
The process isn’t painful, because doctors can use a local anesthetic to numb
the site. They’re looking for an antibody called IgA (I talk more about IgA in
Chapter 2), and if they see it, they make a diagnosis of DH. Blood screenings
can confirm the diagnosis and help doctors monitor progress on a gluten-free
diet, but an intestinal biopsy usually isn’t necessary.
Treatment is a strict gluten-free diet. Sometimes doctors put DH patients on
sulfa-based medications such as dapsone or sulfapyridine, but doctors must
first test for enzymes to avoid toxicity problems from taking the drug. Ideally,
patients can decrease their use of medications as they heal on the gluten-free
diet. If the gluten-free diet isn’t helping, you may need to avoid other foods
and chemicals as well. Iodine can present a problem, and it’s found in shell-
fish and table salt. Kelp (found in some toothpastes and in some oriental
foods) and potassium iodide (used as an expectorant in cough medications)
may present a problem, as may nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents
(NSAIDS), found in over-the-counter pain and fever medications.
The name for DH comes from dermatitis, meaning inflammation of the skin,
and herpetiformis, because it looks similar to herpes, which involves clusters
of lesions. Some people have made the erroneous assumption that DH is
caused by the herpes virus, but there’s actually no relationship to the herpes
virus at all.

W
hether you’re brand new to the wonderful world of gluten-freedom or
an old pro who’s been gluten-free for years, this chapter tells you
things about the gluten-free diet that may surprise you.
The diet seems like it should be so easy: Gluten is in wheat, rye, and barley —
so just avoid those foods, right? If the diet were that simple, I’d be signing off
with “The End” or “Love, Danna” right about now, and the book would be fin-
ished. No, the diet’s not quite that straightforward, thanks to additives, fla-
vorings, derivatives, fillers, binders, and other fancy terms that are really just
euphemisms for “stuff that may have gluten in it.”
The good news is that the list of things you can eat is a lot longer than the list
of things you can’t. Sure, you’re going to have to kiss your pizza goodbye (but
wipe the crumbs off your lips — those crumbs are loaded with gluten), along
with your bagels, bread, cookies, brownies, cakes, and — yep — beer (at
least the kinds of those things that you’re probably used to).
But you’ll realize the amazing world of incredible gluten-free foods that can
take the place of your old favorites — some of which you may never have
heard of before, like quinoa, (if you read the rest of this chapter, you may
even know how to pronounce it). You’ll know that Job’s Tears are not a reli-
gious icon but that they are gluten-free. And if you think ragi is a spaghetti
sauce and sorghum is what you get when you have your teeth cleaned, now’s
the time to learn more about some of the unique grains and starches avail-
able to you on a gluten-free diet.

Don’t be discouraged if you feel like the guidelines are a little overwhelming
at first. For some people, learning what’s allowed and what isn’t on a gluten-
free diet requires an entirely different mindset. For others, it’s less dramatic
of a change. And for still others, it’s a welcome skew from their everyday fare.
Whether you’re a one or a ten on the I’m-overwhelmed-by-this-diet scale, this
chapter is key because it establishes basic gluten-free guidelines. I outline
what is and isn’t gluten-free and why you sometimes have to question a prod-
uct. I introduce you to gluten-free alternatives that you may never have heard
of. I also talk about nonfood items that you may or may not need to be con-
cerned about, such as dental products, alcoholic beverages, medications,
and external products like lotions and shampoos.
When In Doubt, Leave It Out
I can say unequivocally that at some point, you will have occasion to wonder
whether a product is gluten-free; you’re at a restaurant or party and you have
no idea what’s in the food, the labeling isn’t clear, no labels are in sight, or
you don’t know half the words on the label. And if you don’t have your
handy-dandy copy of Living Gluten-Free For Dummies nearby, you may be
tempted to make assumptions that could get you in trouble.
This assumptive process in these situations usually goes something like this:
I don’t know this is gluten-free, but it looks really yummy. It doesn’t look
like it has gluten in it. Therefore, because I don’t know that it’s not okay,
I’ll assume that it’s safe for me to eat. Mmmm. That was delicious. It
didn’t taste like it had gluten in it. . . . Excuse me, where’s your restroom?
Don’t do it. If you need a reminder of what you’re doing to your body when
you eat gluten, take a look at Chapter 2, which talks about associated condi-
tions and serious complications that can develop if you have gluten sensitiv-
ity or celiac disease and eat gluten, even from time to time.
Even if your symptoms are mild or absent, the damage gluten causes — even
small amounts of gluten — can be severe.
You’re a lot better off being safe instead of sorry, so follow this common-
sense commandment: When in doubt, leave it out.

Defining Gluten So You Can Avoid It
You have to know what gluten is — and not just so you can be the life of the
party, sparking tantalizing conversations that begin with audacious lines like,
“So, which do you find harder to avoid? Gliadin, hordein, or secalin?” (Yeah,
that’ll get the party started, Smooth Talker.) No, you need to know about
gluten so you can avoid it (gluten, not the pickup line). The definition of this
term is so convoluted that it’s hard to offer a technically correct definition of
gluten at this point, but I’ll try.
Gluten is what scientists call a storage protein, what bakers call the dough-
forming elastic ingredient in wheat, and what some newbies to the gluten-free
diet pine away for. Gluten is a group of proteins that technically comes from
wheat and only wheat.
At some point in our not-so-distant history, someone made the association
between wheat (specifically gluten) and celiac disease. People widely
accepted that gluten makes celiacs sick, which is true. Soon, physicians real-
ized that barley and rye make celiacs sick, too, and people started saying,
“Celiacs can’t eat gluten. They can’t eat wheat, barley, and rye, either; there-
fore, wheat, barley, and rye all have gluten.” Right? Kind of, but not really.
One of the types of proteins in gluten is also in barley and rye.
Prolamins are a class of proteins present in a variety of grains, and they’re
what cause problems for people who can’t eat “gluten.” Technically, gluten is
made up of the proteins glutenin and gliadin, a specific type of prolamin in
wheat. However, gluten has become a general term for any kind of potentially
harmful prolamin. The prolamins that cause damage to people with gluten
sensitivity and celiac disease include gliadin (in wheat), secalin (in rye), and
hordein (in barley). Other grains have prolamins, too (corn’s prolamin is
called zein, and rice’s prolamin is orzenin), but their prolamins aren’t toxic to
people with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease.
The “wheat, barley, and rye (and maybe oats) all have gluten” idea stuck, and
even though it isn’t technically correct, it is widely accepted today. For the
purposes of this book, I stick with it, too.
Wheat-free doesn’t mean gluten-free. Something can be wheat-free and still
have, for instance, malt (derived from barley), so then it’s not gluten-free.

Chapter 4: Grasping the Ground Rules of the Gluten-Free Diet

Recognizing Gluten-Free 
Foods at a Glance
Keep in mind that you have to become familiar with lots of ingredients when
you’re learning the intricacies of the gluten-free diet.
The reason the gluten-free diet can seem cumbersome at first is that “deriva-
tives” of gluten-containing grains may contain gluten. Then, of course,
processed foods — which contain seasonings, additives, and flavorings —
can contain ingredients that raise questions, too.
But breaking foods down into those that usually have gluten and those that
don’t isn’t too tough. Keep in mind that these lists vary and that they’re only
to get you started. You can find up-to-date lists of foods that are safe, forbid-
den, and questionable at www.celiac.com.
Forbidden grains
I’m not starting with the forbidden grains to be negative — I’m starting with
them because the list is a lot shorter than the list of grains you can eat. Here
are the grains you need to avoid on a gluten-free diet:
 Barley
 Oats (because of contamination issues)
 Triticale (a hybrid of wheat and rye)
 Rye
 Wheat
You need to avoid (or at least question) anything with the word wheat in it.
This includes hydrolyzed wheat protein, wheat starch, wheat germ, and so
on. Wheat grass, however, like all grasses, is gluten-free. (But see the upcom-
ing sidebar “Grasses, sprouted grains, berries, and bran” to make sure you’re
not dealing with contamination from sprouts. Hey, I know it’s confusing; I’m
just the messenger.) Here are a few additional details to keep in mind:
 Wheat starch is actually wheat that’s had the gluten washed out.
In some countries, a special type of wheat starch called Codex
Alimentarius wheat starch is allowed on the gluten-free diet — but it’s
not allowed in North America, because some people question whether
the washing process completely removes all residual gluten.
 Triticale is a made-up grain — a hybrid of wheat and rye. Inventors
developed it to combine the productivity of wheat with the ruggedness
of rye, not just to add another grain to your list of forbidden foods. And
60
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

relatively speaking, it’s fairly nutritious for people who can eat gluten
(but wait till you hear about “alternative grains” in the next section!).
 Wheat has several names and varieties. Beware of aliases like flour,
bulgur, semolina, spelt, frumento, durum (also spelled duram), kamut,
graham, einkorn, farina, couscous, seitan, matzoh, matzah, matzo, and
cake flour. Often marketed as a “wheat alternative,” spelt is as much of a
wheat alternative as I am a human alternative. It’s not even remotely
gluten-free.
 Wheat just isn’t what it used to be. In fact, in an effort to bring down the
cost of commercial baked goods and make wheat slightly more nutri-
tious for the countries the U.S. ships to, ambitious farmers are actually
finding ways to hybridize wheat to make it have more gluten than ever
before.
 Derivatives of gluten-containing grains aren’t allowed on the gluten-free
diet, either. You can find a complete listing at www.celiac.com, but the
most common derivative that you have to avoid is malt, which usually
comes from barley. Avoid malt, malt flavoring, and malt vinegar. If malt is
derived from another source, such as corn, that fact usually appears on
the label. If not specified, though, don’t eat it.

Chapter 4: Grasping the Ground Rules of the Gluten-Free Diet
So you want to sow your oats . . .
I know that people desperately want to include
oats in their gluten-free diet. Know how I know?
Because here’s a typical excerpt from many of
my talks:
Danna: For now, commercially available
oats aren’t usually guaranteed to be pure,
so they’re still on the “forbidden” or “ques-
tionable” list because of contamination
issues.
Hand-raiser No. 1: But what about Irish
oats?
Danna: Yep, those, too, because they’re still
manufactured commercially and can be
contaminated.
Hand-raiser No. 2: Can you talk about rolled
oats?
Danna: Yeah, I could, but I just did. Off limits.
Hand-raiser No. 3: What if you cook ’em?
Danna: Even cooked, most oats are still for-
bidden on the gluten-free diet.
Hand-raiser No. 4: Steel-cut?
Danna: Steel-cut, uncut, shortcut, crinkle-
cut, 
buzz-cut, 
bikini-cut, 
price-cut,
Connecticut. No go.
Hand-raiser No. 5: So are you saying we
can or can’t have oats?
There’s no clear-cut (or steel-cut) answer on
oats — yet. In and of themselves, most people
agree that oats are gluten-free (although at
least one study showed otherwise), but when
processed commercially, they can become con-
taminated during the manufacturing process.
Some people argue that the risk of contamina-
tion is extremely low — but you need to assess
whether you’re willing to take that risk. If you
can find pure, uncontaminated oats, they may
not present a problem.

Grains and starches you can safely eat
You have lots of choices for gluten-free grains and starches. Even if you’re an
old pro who’s been gluten-free for years, I’m guessing some of these may be
new to you:
62
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 
Grasses, sprouted grains, berries, and bran
Grasses like wheat grass and barley grass, fre-
quently sold in health food stores and at juice
bars, are gluten-free. The grass hasn’t yet
formed the gluten-containing proteins that
cause problems in people with gluten sensitiv-
ity and celiac disease. When you can watch
someone cut the grass so you know it’s fresh
and hasn’t sprouted yet, you’re safe. Be careful,
though, of grasses that are an ingredient in a
product. These grasses could be contaminated
with seeds, and since you don’t know for sure,
you could risk getting gluten.
You should avoid sprouted grains because you
don’t know where in the sprouting process the
grain is. Eating the sprouts could be okay, but it
may not be. Berries are the seed kernels and
are definitely not safe. The jury’s still out on
bran, so until nutritionists do more research,
remember the common-sense commandment I
refer to in this chapter: When in doubt, leave 
it out.

Glutinous rice does not contain gluten! Manufacturers make glutinous rice, or
sweet rice or mochi, by grinding high-starch, short-grain rice. Glutinous rice
thickens sauces and desserts in Asian cooking and is often the rice used in
sushi.
You may run across different names or forms of corn that are gluten-free in
addition to plain ol’ corn. They include grits, hominy, masa, masa harina,
harinilla (blue corn), atole, maize, polenta, corn gluten, and of course, corn-
starch, corn flour, corn bran, and cornmeal.
Gums, such as xanthan and guar gum, contain no gluten. People use them fre-
quently in gluten-free baked goods because gums help give the spongy, elas-
tic texture that gluten-containing flours usually provide. For some people,
gums — especially guar gum — may have a laxative effect.
Other foods that are usually gluten-free
In general, these foods are usually gluten-free (these refer to plain, unsea-
soned foods without additives and processed products):

Chapter 4: Grasping the Ground Rules of the Gluten-Free Diet
Corny tales
Maize (Indian corn) dates back thousands of
years, and its cultivation was a remarkable feat.
Native Americans developed as many as 24 dif-
ferent kinds of corn to accommodate the length
of growing season, altitude, rain, sunlight, and
soil type. To ensure a full season’s yield, the
people grew both early and late ripeners, and
all the corn came in a variety of colors.
Corn has played an important role socially, as
well. A Hopi bride-to-be would grind corn for
three days at her future husband’s house to
prove she had “wifely skills.” When a Hopi child
was born, he or she received a special blanket
and a perfect ear of corn as a welcome into 
the world (who needs binkies?). And early
American settlers learned quickly to depend on
corn, which is easy to grow and store and
needs little maintenance. Corn-based dishes
became a backbone of early frontier dining for
rugged settlers who were busy fending off
grumpy Indians (undoubtedly more than a tad
cranky that their cornfields were being taken
over) and cantankerous outlaws.

The foods listed here are naturally gluten-free. You can buy specialty prod-
ucts such as cookies, cakes, brownies, breads, crackers, pretzels, and other
products that have been made with gluten-free ingredients. I talk more about
those products and where to buy them in Chapter 8, which covers shopping.
Foods that usually contain gluten
Companies offer special gluten-free varieties of some foods, and those gluten-
free varieties obviously don’t have gluten in them. But unless you’re buying
specialty products, you can assume the following foods contain gluten:

Exploring Alternative Grains 
and Superfoods
When it comes to grains beyond corn, wheat, and rice, most people don’t
know barley from bulgur. Actually, there’s a great big world of grains out
there to be explored, many of which are gluten-free, delicious, and loaded
with nutritional value.

They’re called “alternative grains,” yet many aren’t grains at all. Instead,
they’re grasses, seeds, or flowers. People also call them superfoods because
they’re foods that are super-nutritious. Take a look at some of these alterna-
tive grains and discover an entirely new world of gluten-free superfoods
(where is that cape?!?).
For years, rumors have spread that some of these alternative grains aren’t
safe for people with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease. These foods are, in
fact, gluten-free. Some people may have had reactions to these grains (as
they would to corn, soy, or other allergens or foods to which they may have a
sensitivity), but it’s not a gluten reaction. But regardless of whether a food
contains gluten, if it makes you sick, don’t eat it!
Amaranth
Loaded with fiber, iron, calcium, and other vitamins and minerals, amaranth
is also high in the amino acids lysine, methionine, and cysteine, and it’s an
excellent source of protein. A small beadlike grain, amaranth is not only nutri-
tious but also delicious, with a pleasant peppery and hearty nutty flavor.
Amaranth isn’t a true cereal grain at all, but it’s a relative of the pigweeds and
ornamental flowers called cockscomb. People grow it not only for its seed but
for its leaves, which you can cook and eat as greens. Amaranth can be milled
or toasted, which gives it extra flavor. You can even pop some varieties like
popcorn, boil and eat them like cereal, or use them in soups and granolas or
as a side dish. You should always cook amaranth before eating it, because
like some other edible seeds, it contains compounds that can inhibit the
proper absorption of certain nutrients.
For centuries, the Aztec culture depended on amaranth and believed it had
mystical powers that could bring strength and power even to the weakest of
men. The name means “not withering,” or more literally, “immortal.” Although
amaranth may not make you immortal, it is extremely nutritious — and
gluten-free.

Chapter 4: Grasping the Ground Rules of the Gluten-Free Diet
Don’t eat the wheat meat
Seitan, pronounced say-tahn, is a chewy food
made from gluten that resembles meat in tex-
ture. Also called wheat meat, people make
seitan by making dough out of wheat flour and
water, kneading it to develop the gluten, and
rinsing away the starch and bran, leaving only
the gluten. They then simmer it in water or 
vegetable broth that’s been seasoned with 
soy sauce, resulting in a chewy, firm, meatlike 
food . . . food that not only is loaded with gluten
but is gluten. Loosely translated, the Japanese
word seitan means “is protein”; it’s called kofu
in China.

Arrowroot
Once revered by the ancient Mayans and other inhabitants of Central
America as an antidote to poison arrows, arrowroot is now used as an herb
thought to soothe the stomach and have antidiarrheal effects. People use it in
cooking as a thickener for soups, sauces, and confections.
An easily digested and nutritious starch, arrowroot is a fine, white powder
with a look and texture similar to that of cornstarch. The translucent paste
has no flavor and sets to an almost clear gel. You can use arrowroot in gluten-
free cooking or as a thickening agent to replace cornstarch, although it thick-
ens at a lower temperature than either cornstarch or wheat and its consistency
doesn’t hold as long after cooking. The superfine grains are easy to digest,
making arrowroot a perfect “invalid” food. In fact, arrowroot biscuits are one
of the first solid foods babies can safely eat (but beware — manufacturers
usually add wheat flour to arrowroot biscuits, so they’re not gluten-free).
Buckwheat (soba)
The fact that buckwheat is gluten-free often confuses people; after all, buck-
wheat has the word “wheat” right in the name. But buckwheat isn’t even
related to wheat; in fact, it’s not even a true cereal grain. It’s a fruit, a distant
cousin of garden-variety rhubarb. The buckwheat seed has a three-cornered
shell that contains a pale kernel known as a groat. In one form or another,
groats have been around since the tenth century B.C.
High in lysine, which is an amino acid lacking in many traditional grains,
buckwheat contains several other amino acids — in fact, this grain has a high
proportion of all eight essential amino acids, which the body doesn’t make
but still needs to keep functioning. In that way, buckwheat is closer to being a
complete protein than many other plant sources. It’s also high in many of the
B vitamins, as well as the minerals phosphorus, magnesium, iron, copper,
manganese, and zinc. And buckwheat’s a good source of linoleic acid, an
essential fatty acid.
Whole white buckwheat is naturally dried and has a delicate flavor that
makes it a good stand-in for rice or pasta. When the hulled buckwheat ker-
nels are roasted, they’re called kasha, which has a deep tan color, nutty
flavor, and a slightly scorched smell. Cooks often use buckwheat in pancakes,
biscuits, and muffins — but be aware that manufacturers often combine
buckwheat with wheat in those products, so you have to read the labels care-
fully before buying buckwheat products. In Japan, people often make buck-
wheat into soba, or noodles, which sometimes — but not always — have
wheat flour as well.

Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

Mesquite (pinole)
Most people know of mesquite as an on-the-grill flavoring that makes foods
taste smoky and sweet. But mesquite has been a staple for Native Americans
for thousands of years. Its sweet, fragrant flowers make a honeylike substance,
and the pod produces a ground meal called pinole. Mesquite flour is a low-
glycemic-index flour (it’s a 25 — see Chapter 6 for what that kind of rating
means), making it helpful in controlling blood sugar levels. Furthermore, 
soluble fibers in the seeds and pods slow the absorption of nutrients, which
also helps in managing blood sugar.
The sweet pods and seeds are a good source of fiber, calcium, manganese,
iron, and zinc. They’re also high in protein, and they contain the amino acid
lysine, which isn’t present in many traditional grains. Not only does mesquite
flour stabilize blood sugar, but it tastes great, with a sweet, slightly nutty
flavor that bears a hint of molasses.
Mixes that combine mesquite with other gluten-free flours are now available,
making creating gluten-free goodies with this unique flour a snap.
Millet
Not a grain at all, millet is actually a grass with small, round, ivory and yellow
kernels that swell when you cook them. Millet supplies more servings per
pound than any other grain.
Millet is packed with vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. High in iron,
magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium, it’s also loaded with fiber and pro-
tein as well as the B-complex vitamins, including niacin, thiamin, and
riboflavin. Millet is more alkaline (it has a higher pH — I talk more about
acidic and alkaline foods in Chapter 6) than many traditional grains, and
digesting it is very easy.
Millet has been a staple food in Africa and India for thousands of years, and
people grew it as early as 2,700 B.C. in China, where it was the prevalent grain
before rice became the dominant staple. Today, millet is still a significant part
of the diet in northern China, Japan, Manchuria, and various areas of the
former Soviet Union, Africa, India, and Egypt. Grown today in Western coun-
tries mostly for cattle and bird feed, millet’s gaining popularity as a nutri-
tious, delicious part of the human diet as well.
67
Chapter 4: Grasping the Ground Rules of the Gluten-Free Diet

Montina (Indian ricegrass)
Montina is actually Amazing Grains’s trademarked name for Indian ricegrass.
Indian ricegrass was a dietary staple of Native American cultures from the
Southwest U.S. to Canada more than 7,000 years ago. Extremely hearty, Indian
ricegrass was a good substitute during years when maize crops failed or
game was in short supply. It has a bold flavor and is loaded with fiber and
protein.
Quinoa (hie)
Quinoa (pronounced keen-wa) — and also called hie (pronounced he-uh) —
is yet another of the grains that isn’t really a grain; it’s actually a fruit and a
relative of the common weed lambsquarter. The National Academy of Science
describes quinoa as “the most nearly perfect source of protein from the veg-
etable kingdom.”
Like other superfoods and alternative grains, quinoa is packed with lysine
and other amino acids that make it a complete protein. It’s also high in phos-
phorus, calcium, iron, vitamin E, and assorted B vitamins, as well as fiber.
Quinoa is usually pale yellow in color, but it also comes in pink, orange, red,
purple, and black.
Because the uncooked grains are coated with saponins — sticky, bitter-
tasting stuff that acts as a natural insect repellent — you should rinse quinoa
thoroughly before cooking. Most quinoa that you buy in the store has already
been rinsed.
Although new to North Americans, people in the South American Andes have
cultivated quinoa since at least 3,000 B.C. Ancient Incas called this annual
plant “the mother grain” because it was self-perpetuating and ever-bearing.
They honored it as a sacred food product, because a steady diet appeared to
ensure a full, long life; and the Inca ruler himself planted the first row of
quinoa each season with a golden spade.
Sorghum (milo, jowar, jowari, cholam)
Sorghum is another of the oldest known grains (that isn’t a true cereal grain),
and it’s been a major source of nutrition in Africa and India for centuries.
Now also grown in the United States, sorghum is generating excitement as a
gluten-free insoluble fiber and is probably best known for the syrup that
comes from one of its varieties.
68
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

Because sorghum’s protein and starch are more slowly digested than that of
other cereals, it may be beneficial to diabetics (and healthful for anyone). It’s
high in iron, calcium, and potassium, and doctors actually used to prescribe
it as a supplement for people low in these nutrients.
Sorghum fans boast of its bland flavor and light color, which don’t alter the
taste or look of foods when you use sorghum in place of wheat flour. Many
cooks suggest combining sorghum with soybean flour. Sorghum is also fer-
mented and used in alcoholic beverages.
Sorghum and millet are both rich in a group of compounds called nitrilosides.
Some people notice a correlation between high nitriloside intake and low
cancer rates, leading some to speculate that nitrilosides may actually help
fight or prevent cancer. For instance, in Africa, where as much as 80 percent
of the diet consists of high-nitriloside-yielding foods, the cancer incidence is
very low.
Teff (tef)
It’s tiny, but teff’s a nutritional powerhouse. Teff is the smallest of the grains
that aren’t true cereal grains, and in fact the name itself means “lost,”
because if you drop it on the ground, you probably won’t find it. A staple
grain in Ethiopia for nearly 5,000 years, teff packs a protein content of nearly
12 percent and is five times richer in calcium, iron, and potassium than any
other grain. Teff, which has a sweet, nutty flavor, grows in many different vari-
eties and colors, but the most common are ivory, brown, and reddish-tan
varieties.
You can cook the whole grain and serve it with sliced fruit or as a breakfast
cereal with butter and brown sugar on top. Or you can add teff flour to baked
goods to add a unique flavor and beef up the nutritional value.
If you’ve heard of teff, it’s probably in reference to injera, a traditional fer-
mented bread with a spongy texture and yeasty taste. Treated as an edible
utensil, injera is used to soak up juices and soups and even to grab meat and
eat it. Beware, though; traditional injera has wheat flour added to it.
Checking Up on Questionable Ingredients
The diet gets a little trickier when you don’t know that a food is almost
always gluten-free or gluten-loaded. In this section, I go over what items you
need to question, and I discuss some of the foods people used to question
but now know are gluten-free.
69
Chapter 4: Grasping the Ground Rules of the Gluten-Free Diet

Knowing which foods to research
Of course, to be safe, you need to question everything. Tea, for instance — 
I never saw a tea with gluten in it until recently, when I happened to read the
label and there it was: barley malt.
Discovering the malt was easy because the label clearly listed what contained
the gluten. But some ingredients aren’t so clear, because sometimes these
ingredients are gluten-free and sometimes they’re not. For these ingredients,
you have to look deeper into the question of “is it or isn’t it?” I talk at length
about how to do that in Chapter 5.
Ingredients you need to question include
 Brown rice syrup
 Fillers
 Flavors and natural flavorings
 Seasonings and spice blends
 Stabilizers
 Starch (in pharmaceuticals)
These ingredients don’t always have gluten. In fact, they rarely do. But
according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Code of Federal
Regulations, they can contain gluten, so to be safe, you need to check.
70
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 
The facts on flavorings 
Flavorings have been considered a question-
able ingredient on the gluten-free diet for years.
But according to Shelley Case, one of the lead-
ing authorities on the gluten-free diet, there’s
little or no need to question flavorings anymore.
She points out that there are only two instances
when gluten can be used in flavorings. One is in
hydrolyzed proteins, but with current labeling
laws, wheat would have to be declared on the
label if it were used. The other is in barley malt
extract or syrup, but Case points out that it’s
almost always listed on the label as “barley
malt,” “barley malt extract,” or “barley malt fla-
voring.” She notes that some companies may
list it as “flavor (contains barley malt)”, but very
rarely is it listed as only “flavor” or “natural
flavor. So why do I still leave it on the “to be
questioned” list? Because “very rarely” leaves
room for the possibility, however slight, that
barley malt may have been used and listed only
as a “flavoring.”

Thanks to new labeling laws, there are far fewer “questionable” ingredients.
Now manufacturers have to clearly indicate if a product has wheat in it. See
Chapter 5 for more details on the new laws.
Putting an end to the controversy 
over certain foods
People used to question certain ingredients, and they were on the have-to-
dig-deeper-to-make-sure-this-is-gluten-free list. These people questioned
ingredients because of rumors, bad information, and misunderstandings.
They questioned because of ambiguous labeling laws. But today, thanks to
new labeling laws and more definitive research, the following ingredients are
no longer in question:
71
Chapter 4: Grasping the Ground Rules of the Gluten-Free Diet
Alcohol (distilled)
Caramel color
Citric acid
Dextrin
Flavoring extracts
Hydrolyzed plant protein (HPP)
Hydrolyzed vegetable protein
(HVP)
Maltodextrin (except in 
pharmaceuticals)
Modified food starch
Mono- and diglycerides
Starch (in food)
Vanilla and vanilla extract
Vinegar (except malt vinegar)
Wheat grass
Yeast (except brewer’s yeast)
The gluten-free status of these ingredients applies to ingredients produced in
the U.S. and Canada. Other countries may have different manufacturing
processes.
The Buzz on Booze: Choosing 
Alcoholic Beverages
At nearly every talk I give, I’m about five minutes into explaining the diet
when someone shoots his hand up Arnold Horseshack–style, with a please-
tell-me-it-ain’t-so look on his face, and I can predict the question: “Beer doesn’t
have gluten in it . . . does it?” Yeah, it does.

But lots of alcoholic beverages are gluten-free — and if you try, you can even
find gluten-free beer. What follows is the buzz on booze.
Booze you can use
The list of gluten-free alcoholic beverages is way longer than the list of bevies
that are off-limits. Other forms of alcoholic beverages may be gluten-free in
addition to these, but this list covers the basics of the booze you can use:
 Bourbon
 Brandy
 Cider (occasionally contains barley, so be careful)
 Cognac
 Gin
 Rum
 Schnapps
 Tequila
 Vodka
 Whiskey (such as Crown Royal and Jack Daniels)
 Wine (and sparkling wine or Champagne)
Knowing what kinds of liquor you can consume can be confusing, because
some alcoholic beverages are distilled from gluten-containing grains.
However, as long as the drinks are distilled and the grains aren’t added back
into the gluten-containing mash, the drinks remain gluten-free.
Step away from the bottle
Just a few types of alcoholic beverages aren’t allowed on the gluten-free diet.
They include (but may not be limited to)
 Beer (with a few exceptions, as listed above)
 Distilled spirits that are added back to the mash
 Malt beverages
The distillation process completely eliminates any traces of gluten, which is
why you can safely eat distilled vinegar, vanilla made with distilled extracts,
and many alcoholic beverages made from distilled alcohol. If you’re not sure
that your favorite bevy is gluten-free, check the gluten-free alcoholic bever-
ages list in this chapter and confirm with the manufacturer.
72
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

Making Sure Your Medications 
and Supplements Are Safe
Remember, anything you ingest can cause problems if it’s not gluten-free —
even a tiny little pill. Be sure to check the label first, because some products
actually say “gluten-free” right on the label.
Starch and modified food starch in pharmaceuticals may come from wheat.
If you see either of these on the label, you need to call the manufacturer and
find out more about where the starch is from.
If you’re wondering about a prescription drug, ask the pharmacist if he or she
knows whether the product is gluten-free. If the pharmacist doesn’t know, ask
for the package insert and use the pharmacy’s Physician’s Desk Reference
(PDR) to look up the name and phone number of the manufacturer. Then you
can just call the manufacturer and find out. (See Chapter 5 for more on calling
manufacturers.)
Here are a few tips to keep in mind:
 Have your pharmacist make a notation in the computer, either under
your personal records or under the record for that drug, indicating
whether the product is gluten-free. That way you’ll know for the future,
as will others who ask.
 If the product is over-the-counter, call the manufacturer to ensure the
drug’s gluten-free status. Usually, the drug company sends you a list of
all the gluten-free products it makes and you can keep the list on hand.
I recommend that you figure out now which of the over-the-counter
products you commonly use are gluten-free. Painkillers, fever-reducers,
cold medications, and anti-inflammatories, for instance, are often 
gluten-free — but you sure don’t want to be wondering about it at 1 a.m.
when your child’s earache is keeping him — and you — up at night.

Three cheers for gluten-free beers!
Most beer has gluten and is off-limits. But a few
gluten-free specialty beers are available,
including Bard’s Tale Beer (www.bards
beer.com), which has several varieties and
distributes widely. Ramapo Valley Brewery
(www.ramapovalleybrewery.com) in
New York offers gluten-free beer at its brewery
in New York and distributes throughout the
United States as well. You can also check out La
Messagere, made by New France Beers of
Quebec; Green’s Discovery in the U.K.; Bi-Aglut
in Italy; and beers from O’Brien Brewery in
Australia. If you like to make your own home
brew, lots of good recipes are available on the
Internet. A quick search should turn up several
options.

 Write “GF” in permanent marker on the medication container. That way
you don’t wonder whether the drug’s safe when you need to take it.
 See www.glutenfreedrugs.com for more information, or take a look
at some of the product guides and downloadable databases commer-
cially available.
Using Nonfood Products: 
What You Need to Know
You may get lots of conflicting information about nonfood products and
whether you need to be concerned. You may hear that you need to beware of
plastic storage containers, pots and pans, lotions, shampoos, envelopes,
stamps, glues . . . what’s a gluten-freebie supposed to do?!?
The biggest question is if you’re not eating it, does it really matter? The
answer is sometimes yes and sometimes no (you expected something more
concrete?).
Play-Doh has gluten in it. I know you’re not supposed to eat Play-Doh, but
really — who can resist a nibble or two? Lots of recipes for gluten-free play-
doughs are available.
You don’t have to worry about plastic storage containers, pots and pans,
envelopes, or stamps. The following sections let you know what to check out
and what you can let slide.
Make-up matters
Well, sometimes it matters. And sometimes it doesn’t. The make-up that 
matters most is make-up you’re likely to get in your mouth (or someone
else’s), like lipstick, lip gloss, lip balm, and anything else that goes on or near
your lips. Foundation, eye make-up, powder, and other make-up products
shouldn’t matter unless you get them close to your mouth and could possibly
ingest them.
Lotions and potions
The experts assert that the gluten molecule is too large to pass through skin,
so lotions, shampoos, conditioners, and other external products shouldn’t be
a problem unless you have open sores, rashes, or dermatitis herpetiformis,
also know as DH. (See Chapter 3 for more information on DH.)

Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

Sometimes lotion from your hands or arms can get on the food you’re eating
or preparing, and that can cause a problem. Be sure to wash your hands well
(along with any other area that may touch food) so you don’t end up eating
your lotion.
In spite of the scientific evidence suggesting external products shouldn’t
pose a problem, I’ve heard from hundreds of people that they do have a reac-
tion to external products that contain gluten. Who am I to argue? If it bothers
you, don’t use it.
Deciding on dental products
You’re really not supposed to swallow your toothpaste, mouthwash, or other
dental products — but you’re undoubtedly going to get a swallow or two
from time to time, and if it contains gluten, that can potentially cause a prob-
lem. I’ve never found a toothpaste or mouthwash that does contain gluten,
but remember to read labels just in case.
Most products used in the dental office such as polish, fluoride, and other
dental agents are gluten-free. But call your dentist in advance and ask him or
her to check for you.

A
product is either gluten-free or it isn’t, right? End of story? Well, no.
Personally, I like things simple and straightforward, so I can understand if
this is-it-gluten-free-and-why-isn’t-there-a-simple-answer issue is driving you
nuts. The good news is that there’s a lot less ambiguity than there used to be,
and clarity is improving all the time. The bad news is that sometimes you still
have to take an extra step (or four) before you know for sure whether a prod-
uct is truly gluten-free.
In this chapter, I show you how to do everything you can to ensure the food
you’re eating is as gluten-free as it can be. I take you through the art of read-
ing labels, explain why 100 percent gluten-free may not really mean 100 per-
cent gluten-free, and offer a crash course in calling manufacturers.

Gluten-Free Ambiguously: Why 
It Isn’t So Straightforward
You: Does your product contain gluten?
Polite Lady on Phone: We don’t add any gluten to our products.
You: (heavy sigh of relief) Oh, terrific. Then it’s gluten-free, right?
Polite Lady on Phone: Oh, no, I didn’t say that. Thank you for calling!
You may feel like you’re being toyed with. Customer service reps seem to
specialize in obfuscation, euphemism, and other forms of double-speak when
you ask the seemingly simple question “Is it gluten-free?”
Truth is, they’re not messing with you to get their jollies. Questions arise for
a variety of reasons. The most common causes involve ambiguous labeling,
uncertainty about the origin of ingredients, and contamination concerns.
Loose labeling terminology
It would be great if you could just read a label and know what ingredients are
in a product. Isn’t that the point of having ingredient listings? But unfortu-
nately, some ingredients aren’t consistent; sometimes they have gluten, and
sometimes they don’t.
A fairly new food labeling law has helped — a lot. The Food Allergen Labeling
and Consumer Protection Act requires clear labeling of all foods that contain
any of the top-eight allergens — wheat, milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts,
peanuts, and soybeans. This means manufacturers must now clearly identify
wheat and all of its derivatives on food labels. For more info on this new law,
see the upcoming sidebar “New labeling law answers some questions but
raises others.”
With the law in place, knowing which foods are definitely off-limits because
they contain wheat is much easier. Reading labels and knowing what’s in a
product is much more definitive, because wheat is really the bulk of what
you’re avoiding on a gluten-free diet.
Although wheat and its derivatives are now called out on all labels, you
still need to watch for other gluten-containing grains (barley, rye, and 
cross-contaminated oats) and their derivatives, and realize that they can
be (but aren’t often) hidden in flavorings and additives.
78
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

Malt is often from barley, and products that use malt as a flavoring don’t nec-
essarily call it out on the label. Natural flavorings, for instance, may contain
barley malt.
79
Chapter 5: Making Sure It’s Gluten-Free: Digging a Little Deeper
New labeling law answers some 
questions but raises others
The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer
Protection Act, which requires manufacturers
to clearly identify wheat and its derivatives on
ingredient labels, is amazing progress for
people avoiding wheat. Getting this labeling law
passed was huge, and the celiac community
was super influential in getting it done. The law
even requires that by the year 2008, the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration has to define
exactly what gluten-free on a label means and
how it’ll be used.
Until some of the kinks get worked out, be pre-
pared for a little confusion among people who
need to know for sure what is and isn’t gluten-
free. The biggest areas of concern include
 How much wheat must be in the product to
be subject to labeling requirements: One
hundred percent gluten-free is not only unre-
alistic but untestable, though you can test for
100 percent wheat-free. The new law calls
for “zero tolerance,” meaning a product
must have absolutely no allergen (in this
case, wheat) in it — so even ingredients
with the offending protein gluten removed
have to be labeled as being allergenic.
 Overlabeling: Sometimes manufacturers
may label food as having wheat in it even if
it doesn’t. That’s because some interpreta-
tions of the new law say that wheat should
be on the label if an ingredient’s original
source was wheat — even if that wheat is
completely gone by the time the product’s
processed.
Some foods from gluten-containing grains —
like citric acid, glucose syrup, and distilled vine-
gar (not malt) — are so highly processed that
what grain they were derived from doesn’t
matter. They are, and always have been, gluten-
free after processing (most of the time these
foods come from gluten-free sources, anyway).
But some interpretations of the new labeling
law may require that companies put wheat on
the label if those products were made from
wheat; this would lead the consumer to believe
the product contains gluten when it actually
doesn’t.
Manufacturers can ask for an exemption if they
can prove that the ingredient doesn’t cause a
harmful allergenic response or if they can pro-
vide scientific evidence that the ingredient
doesn’t contain allergenic proteins. This may be
a challenge, because proving that white bread
causes damage for people with various forms
of gluten sensitivity, autism, autoimmune dis-
eases, and other conditions can be tough
enough. Proving the opposite is even harder.

“Gluten-free” may not mean 100 percent
I unequivocally advocate a strict gluten-free diet. I even go so far as to use the
term 100 percent gluten-free, but in reality, something that’s gluten-free isn’t
necessarily 100 percent gluten-free.
The reality is that food may actually have minute traces of gluten, but as long
as those traces are truly small, the product may sometimes still be called
gluten-free and be safe for everyone — regardless of sensitivities or disease.
For a variety of reasons usually concerning cross-contamination, even foods
that are inherently gluten-free sometimes turn out to contain gluten. Of
course, this does not mean you should cheat, figuring you’re going to get
glutenated anyway. Quite the opposite. You need to be even more diligent to
make sure you’re doing everything you can to be safely gluten-free — as
gluten-free as you can be.
Contamination risks
One of the most common reasons a product that is technically gluten-free
may have trace amounts of gluten is contamination. Even if a product is made
without any gluten-containing ingredients, contamination can occur at sev-
eral points during processing. (Contamination is a risk when you’re preparing
and cooking your own foods, and manufacturers are dealing with food on a
much larger scale. You can see more about how to avoid contamination in the
kitchen in Chapter 7.)
Grain processing
Commercially grown grains can contain trace amounts of other grains,
because preventing cross-contamination is nearly impossible. The cross-
contamination starts at the farm, where crops are often rotated between
fields each year, and volunteer crops from previous years can pop up where
they’re least expected. Contamination can also occur in grain storage, trans-
portation, and during milling.
So if the product you’re eating contains a grain — even a non-gluten-containing
grain — there’s a risk of contamination. Usually, the amount of contamination
is miniscule and doesn’t pose a health threat. The only time you know there’s
no cross-contamination is when the grains are from suppliers who grow, har-
vest, mill, and package only one (gluten-free) grain.
Oats are a good example of a grain that often undergoes cross-contamination.
Frequently rotated with fields where wheat is grown, oats — gluten-free in
and of themselves — can be contaminated in the fields as well as in the trans-
portation and milling processes. Oats are more likely to be contaminated
(and at greater levels) than other grains, which is why oats land on the for-
bidden list but other grains are still considered safe.

Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

Shared equipment or facilities
Many companies produce several different products on one production line.
For instance, a company that produces several types of cereal may run them
all on the same equipment. Although the United States and many other coun-
tries have strict laws about cleaning lines between products, sometimes
traces of gluten remain on the lines — or in the facility — and contaminate
the gluten-free products that are made there. Some people eat only products
made in dedicated gluten-free facilities.
Mysterious ingredient sources
Sometimes the gluten-free status of a product is questionable because track-
ing the source of its ingredients is tough. Most product manufacturers get
their ingredients from a variety of suppliers. Sometimes a supplier can’t guar-
antee the gluten-free status of the ingredients it’s supplying or an ingredient’s
source can’t be traced.
Some suppliers may not really understand what gluten-free is and yet still may
claim that their ingredient is safely gluten-free when, in fact, it may not be.
Defining Safe Amounts of Gluten
At every talk I give, I proselytize about being 100 percent gluten-free — I
admonish you for even thinking about smelling the donuts, lest some crumbs
jump off and pry their way into your mouth. So I realize that by using the
term safe amounts of gluten, I may appear to be contradicting myself.
Yet the truth is that there’s a threshold of gluten that’s safe for everyone,
even on a daily basis. The amount that’s safe is equal to about a fraction of a
crumb. A teensy-weensy fraction of a teensy-weensy crumb.
People measure gluten in parts per million (ppm). There aren’t any consistent
standards for determining what’s gluten-free. Some countries use 20 ppm as
a current limit, meaning anything that has less than 20 ppm of gluten can be
considered gluten-free. But the standards vary from country to country, and
the U.S. doesn’t currently have any limits in place.
How much is a part per million, anyway? For easier math, take bread that
contains 200 ppm of gluten as an example. Cut that slice of bread into
5,000 pieces, and you have 5,000 crumbs. One of those crumbs is equivalent
to 200 out of a million parts — equal to the amount of gluten in that piece
of bread. That fraction of the bread weighs about 0.006 grams, or about
0.0002 ounces.
81
Chapter 5: Making Sure It’s Gluten-Free: Digging a Little Deeper

The Codex Alimentarius Commission is a committee set up to ensure con-
sumer protection as it pertains to food safety and quality by developing inter-
nationally agreed-upon standards and regulations. These standards are based
on scientific principles and fair-trade practices. For gluten content, the
International Codex safe threshold is 200 ppm. But safe thresholds for gluten
content vary around the world (not everyone follows Codex standards, includ-
ing the United States). In Finland, 100 ppm is considered safely gluten-free.
Testing for Gluten in Foods
With so many questions about what does and doesn’t have gluten, there
should be a test you can do to know for sure. And there is!
Several types of gluten tests are available; some are used commercially, and
some are designed for consumer use. Some of the commercial tests are so
sensitive they can detect as little as 5 ppm (parts per million); several manu-
facturers of gluten-free products use them to ensure the purity of their foods.
Gluten home tests usually work a lot like a home pregnancy test: A series of
lines appear on a small wand to give you a reading. To dissolve the gluten,
you mix the food with some fluid in a tube; you then use a small comb to
place the liquid in the wand, which is about the size of a large, flat pen. The
liquid flows through a test “window,” and within about five minutes, lines
appear to indicate whether the food contains gluten.
The home test can detect wheat, triticale, rye, and some amounts of barley.
Sensitivity of the home kit is 75–100 ppm for most samples, and kits of the
future will likely detect even lower levels.

Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 
Certified Gluten-Free: “GF” marks the spot
A new certification program with an easy-to-
recognize logo is making an impressive and
helpful mark on the gluten-free community. The
Certified Gluten-Free logo indicates that a 
food contains less than 10 ppm of gluten. The
Gluten-Free Certification Organization checks
ingredient lists, tests foods, and inspects 
manufacturing plants — giving shoppers the
assurance that a product is gluten-free and the
manufacturing facility is free of contaminants.

Deciphering Label Lingo
The good news — and the bad news — is that you don’t have to look for
“gluten-free” on the label. In other words, there’s a big, bold world of gluten-
free goodness that doesn’t say “gluten-free” on it but is nonetheless gluten-free.
The first step to finding out whether a food is gluten-free is reading labels.
Reading ingredient labels on food products can be informative, enlightening,
question-provoking, emotion-evoking, confusing, frustrating, timesaving, and
time-consuming — all in one. Sometimes seeing what’s in the foods you eat is
downright scary. But for people who are serious about being gluten-free,
label-reading is not optional.
Reading labels is almost an art, beginning with the label flip-scan. If you’ve
been reading labels for a while, you know what I mean — you grab a product,
and with a fancy twist of the wrist, you flip to the list of ingredients and scan
for forbidden items. Spot one, and the product goes back on the shelf. This
becomes such a habit that you may find yourself doing the label flip-scan
with products you don’t even eat.
Reading labels can be intimidating at first, because many processed foods
contain all sorts of multisyllabic ingredients that you’ve probably never heard
of (most of those are chemicals, and many of them are on the safe ingredients
list). But you get used to the many (sometimes scary) ingredients you actually
eat, and before you know it, you’ve mastered the label flip-scan — all while
you make mental calculations of how much you can save with your double
coupons.
Reading Glutenese: Knowing 
what to look for
The key to efficient label-reading is knowing what to look for. Of course, if you
happen to spot the words “gluten-free” on the label, you may find yourself
wanting to do a touchdown dance. Go ahead. Seeing “gluten-free” on a label is
worthy of celebration.
But usually, label-reading is far more complex than that, and you’re relegated
to poring over lengthy lists of ingredients.
For ingredients other than wheat, or to check ingredients you’ve never heard
of, the safe and forbidden ingredients and additives lists at www.celiac.com
are a good guide. (Click on Safe & Forbidden Gluten-Free Foods and
Ingredients to find the lists.) I suggest you print out a copy of the lists and
take it with you when you shop. When you encounter ingredients you’ve
never heard of, you can check your lists and decide whether the product
goes back on the shelf or in the cart.
83
Chapter 5: Making Sure It’s Gluten-Free: Digging a Little Deeper

You need to check labels often. Ingredients change, and a product that may
have been gluten-free at one time may not necessarily still be gluten-free.
Avoiding tempting marketing come-ons
Labels are cluttered with tempting enticements touting tempting benefits like
organic, all-natural, no GMOs, healthy, nutritious, and the forever-to-be-dreaded
new and improved. Few of these claims are substantive, and none of them say
anything about the gluten-free status of a product. In fact, “new and improved”
is actually a euphemism for “now you definitely have to check ingredients —
again — because we’ve changed our formula.”
People sometimes make the erroneous assumption that if a product is health-
ful, it’s more likely to be gluten-free. Not true. In fact, if you see the words
whole grain emblazoned on a label, step away from the product. Chances are
it’s not gluten-free.
Even if a product says wheat-free on the label, that doesn’t mean it’s gluten-free.
You still need to watch for barley, rye, and oats — as well as their derivatives.
Checking with Food Manufacturers
After you’ve read the label and you’ve determined that the product doesn’t
include any obvious sources of gluten, you may want to check with the manu-
facturer to make sure your food doesn’t have any hidden sources.
These days, checking is pretty easy. Most products have a toll-free phone
number listed right on the package. When you call that number, you often get
connected with someone who actually knows what you’re talking about, and
the company usually sends you a whole bunch of coupons for its products. In
fact, the manufacturer will sometimes send you a long list of its gluten-free
items.
Sometimes, though, you get the friendly customer service rep, the coupons,
and the list but confusing answers to your questions.
Take a cell phone into the store with you. That way, when you find a food you
have questions about, you can call right then and there.
For the most part, all you have to say when you call is, “I’d like to find out
whether your product is gluten-free,” and the friendly customer service reps
know exactly what you’re talking about. Occasionally, though, being specific
is helpful and even necessary. Say, “I’m calling to see whether this product is
gluten-free, which means it doesn’t contain wheat, rye, barley, or oats.” You
may educate one more person about gluten.
84
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

Some manufacturers have voluntarily adopted a policy to declare all gluten-
containing ingredients and their derivatives, so if you don’t see anything on
their labels, you don’t have to contact the company. When you contact a com-
pany and find out that this is its policy, make note of it. Before long, you’ll
have a list of companies that declare their gluten-containing ingredients and
you won’t have to spend so much time checking the status of products.
Interpreting company responses
When you call a company to find out whether its product is gluten-free, you
get one of a few responses. Interpreting these responses sometimes requires
a little inference, deduction, and conjecture on your part. If you can’t get a
straight answer, play it safe and leave the product out of the cart. These are
the most common responses you get and the possible interpretations.
“We can’t guarantee our product is gluten-free.”
This doesn’t necessarily mean, “Our product may not be gluten-free.” It usu-
ally translates to, “Yes, our product is gluten-free, but our legal department
asks that we cover our tushies by telling you we can’t guarantee it.”
Aside from legal considerations, the “we can’t guarantee our product is
gluten-free” reply — the most common you’ll hear — may be for other rea-
sons, as well:
 The product has ingredients that may be derived from a gluten-containing
source.
 The company gets ingredients from other suppliers and doesn’t know
for sure that they’re gluten-free.
 The company suspects that other products produced in the facility
could cause contamination.
 The company doesn’t test for gluten, so even though the company’s cer-
tain the products are gluten-free, it doesn’t want to guarantee that.
 The company suspects its products are gluten-free but doesn’t com-
pletely understand the concept, so it defers to this reply.
If you’re told “we can’t guarantee our product is gluten-free,” ask questions and
find out why they won’t vouch for the product’s gluten-free status. With more
information, you can decide for yourself whether the product is safe to eat.
“Our product is not gluten-free.”
Sometimes the “no, our product is not gluten-free” response is really what the
customer service rep means, and gluten that isn’t clearly indicated on the
label is in the product.
85
Chapter 5: Making Sure It’s Gluten-Free: Digging a Little Deeper

But don’t make the mistake of interpreting this one as always being “our
product is not gluten-free.” You need to probe a little deeper. One time, when
I told the customer service rep that I didn’t see anything in the ingredients
that appeared to contain gluten, I was told it was the whey. I pointed out that
whey doesn’t contain gluten. She quickly replied, “Well, then, it must be the
canola oil.” Strike two. I was quickly losing faith in this woman’s credibility.
“Yes, our product is gluten-free.”
You have to judge for yourself whether the person on the other end of the
phone truly understands the concept. Did Sally Jo really understand what
you were talking about? Or did she then say, “Of course we don’t put gluten
in our products. Sugar isn’t good for you, anyway”?
Sometimes the rep follows up the gluten-free claim with, “There are no
sources of wheat, rye, barley, or oats, and there are no questionable addi-
tives. Therefore it’s safe for someone with wheat allergies, gluten intolerance,
or celiac disease.” Feel the love, baby. Feel the love.
Other times when the rep gives this response, she gets a little squirmy if you
push her. For instance, if you reply, “Terrific! Then I can assume the brown
rice syrup is from a non-gluten-containing source, right?” she asks you to
hold. For a really long time. You may want to probe a little more before trust-
ing her final answer.
“We won’t tell.”
Seriously, folks, I’m not trying to steal the special sauce formula (I know it’s
just ketchup and mayo, anyway). I just need to know whether the product is
going to cause severe intestinal trauma.
Company representatives who won’t tell you anything about the ingredients
probably don’t have a good idea of what’s in the product themselves, so
avoiding those foods is a good idea.
“Huh?”
Hey, at least you know where you stand with these people — no fakers or
know-it-alls in this bunch. They don’t have a clue what you’re talking about,
and that’s okay!
Fortunately, this isn’t a common response anymore, but it does happen.
Politely try to explain what types of ingredients may be in the product you’re
calling about, and if it still doesn’t click, ask to speak to a quality control
supervisor or nutrition expert.
86
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

Getting the most out of your 
calls to manufacturers
If you’re going to take the time to contact manufacturers to learn more about
the products you’re eating, you may as well get the most out of the calls.
Here are a few things to keep in mind:
 Tune in. Really listen to the person on the other end of the phone. Does
he get it, or is he faking it? Is he giving you conflicting information or
taking wild guesses? Does he sound confident and knowledgeable? You
need to assess these things before you know for sure that you can trust
what he says.
 Don’t be afraid to take it up a notch. Asking to speak to a supervisor is
not offensive or rude. If you feel the person you’re talking to isn’t giving
you credible answers, ask to speak with a supervisor or the director of
quality control or nutritional services.
 Learn from the answers. If you see an ingredient on a package you’ve
never heard of before, call the manufacturer about it. If the customer
service rep tells you that product is gluten-free, take note. That means
the ingredient is gluten-free, too. Feel free to question the specific ingre-
dient to make sure, and you may find the customer service rep is espe-
cially knowledgeable and can tell you the exact source.
 Acknowledge the rep’s knowledge. You need customer service reps,
and the fact that they’re becoming more knowledgeable about the
gluten-free status of the company’s products is immensely helpful. If
they’re friendly and knowledgeable, let them know how much you appre-
ciate it. Maybe even take the time to write a letter to the company thank-
ing it for supporting the gluten-free community by having knowledgeable
customer service reps and gluten-free products.
 Speak up. Being a squeaky wheel is not only okay but important — you
should call frequently. One reason to call often is that ingredients
change and you need to continually verify that a product is still gluten-
free. But calling is also beneficial for everyone, because it sends a mes-
sage to the company that the gluten-free community is important.
Calling encourages better labeling, and maybe company leaders will
think twice before adding malt flavoring to their products!
 Take note. You may want to keep a folder of the products you use the
most and make note of when you called the manufacturer and what
response you got. You may even want to share your homemade product
list with others.
Mark it up for safety! After you’ve called a manufacturer about a product you
have in your pantry, use a permanent marker to write “GF” all over it, so you
remember that it’s gluten-free.
87
Chapter 5: Making Sure It’s Gluten-Free: Digging a Little Deeper

Getting product listings from a company
Food manufacturers, restaurants, stores, and distributors are usually happy
to send you lists of their gluten-free products, and sometimes they ice the
(gluten-free) cake with a few coupons.
Keep in mind that if a product isn’t on the list, that doesn’t mean it’s not
gluten-free. Recently, someone on a chat site I participate in received a listing
of gluten-free items from a fast-food chain. She quickly posted an announce-
ment that the broiled chicken was not gluten-free, sending shockwaves
through guilt-ridden mommies who had stuffed their kids full of the chicken
patties for weeks. I made a few calls and found out the chicken was, in fact,
gluten-free but hadn’t made the list due to publication deadlines.
Also remember that just because a product is on the list doesn’t mean it’s
always gluten-free. An item could be gluten-free one day, make it onto the list,
and next thing you know, cruel gluten-spiking chefs somewhere take a vote
and decide to add malt flavoring.
If you want to buy product listings, you have a few choices. Product guides
are available from some support groups, and they’re very helpful, but 
realize that they may not include regional brands and that they’re up-to-
date only at the time of printing. Software and databases are more current.
You can purchase Clan Thompson’s Celiac/Gluten-Free SmartLists at www.
clanthompson.com or www.celiac.com in the products and store sections
of those sites.
Searching for Information: The Good, 
The Bad, and the Completely Ludicrous
The good news is that tons of information on gluten, gluten sensitivity, celiac
disease, related disorders, and the gluten-free diet is available. The bad news
is that lots of it is garbage.
No matter what the source, always question the credibility of the authors,
and remember that even seemingly credible sources can perpetuate bad
information.
You may find that a lot of the information is conflicting. One source says vine-
gar is safe, another says it’s forbidden. Here are a few tips to help sort out the
reality from the ridiculous:
88
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

 Check the publication date. Information on the Internet and in books
and magazines can all become outdated the minute it’s published, so
make sure what you’re reading is current.
 Look for credentials. Are the authors knowledgeable, or are they just
sharing personal experiences and opinions? Where do they get their
information? Not all writers are reliable: You don’t need a license to pub-
lish, nor do you have to let the facts get in the way of a good story.
 Compare the information to what you find from other sources. A lot of
the information out there is conflicting, so compare all the sources and
figure out which source stands up to closer scrutiny. The sources of
information that I cite in this chapter are reputable and reliable.
The Internet, for better and for worse
The Internet’s awfully convenient. You can be in your jammies, cup of coffee
in hand, before the sun even rises and find out more about gluten than you
ever knew you didn’t know. The problem is that you can’t always trust what
you read online, and checking credibility is difficult. Furthermore, people
publish information to the Web and sometimes forget about it or don’t take
the time to update it. What you’re looking at could be several years old —
and lots has changed in the past several years.
Some sites are excellent, and at the risk of omitting some good ones that
should be included here, I give you a starter list (Also remember to check 
out the sites I list in the “Magazines and newsletters” and “Support groups”
sections.):

Chapter 5: Making Sure It’s Gluten-Free: Digging a Little Deeper

A nonprofit group called Information Center for Online Resources and
Services, Inc. (ICORS) (www.listname.icors.org) runs a celiac listserv,
which is a list specifically targeted to the celiac community. You subscribe to
the list (make sure you do so from the e-mail you want to use each time), and
then you receive postings from other people — questions, comments, prod-
uct recommendations, recipes, and similar topics. You can post your ques-
tions and comments, too. You receive the posts as e-mail, and they also
appear in a threaded discussion on a Web page.
Keep in mind that this list is open to anyone and that you have to carefully
scrutinize any information for accuracy. To subscribe, send an e-mail to
listserv@listserv.icors.org and write “SUBSCRIBE CELIAC” in the
body, followed by your first and last name.
A quick Internet search should also turn up several chat sites for people
living a gluten-free lifestyle.
Magazines and newsletters
Some outstanding magazines and newsletters are targeted to the gluten-free
community. They’re one of the best places to find current, accurate informa-
tion about gluten-free products, guidelines, and the medical conditions that
benefit from a gluten-free diet. In particular, I recommend

Why is there so much conflicting information?
Good question. (Thanks, I thought of it myself.)
For one thing, a lot has changed in the gluten-
free world in the last few years. Ingredients that
were once questionable because they could
contain gluten were found rarely, if ever, to
actually contain gluten. Modified food starch is
a good example of that. The new labeling laws
that require manufacturers to call out wheat on
the labels mean just about all of the once-ques-
tioned “questionable” ingredients are no longer
questionable at all, yet on many lists you still see
these ingredients listed as iffy.
Another reason for conflicting information is
that old rumors are hard to kill. The best exam-
ple of that is vinegar, which has always been
gluten-free (except malt vinegar), regardless of
its origin. Yet information has been published for
years (and continues to be published) claiming
that vinegar may contain gluten — so the mis-
information lives on.
Canola oil fell victim to rumor a few years ago
when someone said canola oil made him feel bad
and naively concluded that canola oil has gluten
in it (it doesn’t). People began spreading the
“fact” that canola oil has gluten in it (it doesn’t),
and soon enough, canola oil was listed as a
questionable ingredient, even by some very rep-
utable sources. You can still find canola oil on
many “to be questioned” lists.

W
hether you’re a salad-dodger or suffering from orthorexia (an extreme
desire to eat only health foods), eating gluten-free nutritiously is
simple but not plain. You don’t have to balance any food blocks (and turn
them upside down every few years), weigh portions, keep a food log, or
count calories — and you’re not limited to deprivation dining.
I have more than just a passing passion for nutrition, and my interest extends
far beyond whether something is gluten-free or not. I love to eat, and I believe
food is to be respected and revered — partly for the diversity of flavors, tex-
tures, and consistencies; partly for the buzz you get from enjoying a deli-
cious, nutritious meal; partly for the energy it gives you; and most definitely
for the big-picture way it nourishes your body with ramifications that affect
every element of your being.
In this chapter, I hope to share with you my fervor for food as being more than
just something that satisfies your hunger pangs. I explain why gluten-free
doesn’t always mean guilt-free and why paying attention to the glycemic load
is crucial to a healthful lifestyle. And with a few gentle nudges, I hope to help
steer you — oh-so-gently — down the path of eating gluten-free nutritiously.
If the subject of nutrition seems intimidating or overly complex, don’t worry.
I boil it down to the raw ingredients and make this a lesson in nutrition that’s
easy to digest.

Appreciating Your Food
I may be preaching to the choir here, because most of you definitely pay
attention to what you eat, whether you want to or not — faithfully reading
labels and scrutinizing the ingredients, acutely aware of where gluten could
be lurking, and avoiding it like vampires avoiding garlic. But if you want to be
healthy, you should really pay attention, tuning in to your food and what it
offers, way beyond whether it’s gluten-free.
People tend to think that gluten-free means healthful. After all, gluten-free
foods are usually available only at “health food” stores, and they cost four
times what “normal” foods cost. More importantly, they don’t have the evil
villain gluten in them, so they have to be nutritious, right? Nope.
The way most people approach the gluten-free diet really isn’t all that nutri-
tious, but it is gluten-free, so they get points for that.
Another way to approach the diet, though, is ultra-nutritious. It can fuel your
body, help prevent disease, improve your skin’s appearance, help you manage
your weight, reverse the signs of aging, decrease symptoms of PMS and
menopause, and increase longevity. It’s gluten-free — nutritiously! (For a quick
rundown of the health benefits of being gluten-free, check out Chapter 19.)
Food is obviously essential — without it, you’d starve. But the type of food
you eat has powerful effects on preventing disease and on maintaining
proper organ function, energy levels, moods, appearance, athleticism, and
even your longevity and how you age. Almost everything about how you look
and feel is directly related to the food you eat.
Good Carbs, Bad Carbs: Tuning In to the
Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load
Hey! Put down that remote control! I know you’re tempted to skip this section
because this sounds complicated, tedious, boring, or all of the above. Please
don’t! It’s a really important section, and it’s the basis for a lot of what I talk
about in this chapter, so hang in there.
To start, here’s a pop quiz: True or false — a potato is worse for you than a
candy bar. The answer is true, at least if you’re talking about how each food
affects your blood-sugar levels. Now are you interested? Read on.
94
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

Perusing the glycemic index (GI)
All carbs are not created equal. When you eat carbohydrates, the digestive
process breaks them down into the sugar glucose, which is what gives your
body the energy it needs to function. Because glucose is a sugar, it raises
your blood-sugar levels when it enters your bloodstream.
The glycemic index (GI) is just a measurement of how much your blood sugar
increases in the two hours after you eat. Foods high in fat and protein don’t
really affect your blood-sugar levels that much (if anything, they stabilize it),
so the glycemic index really only concerns foods high in carbohydrates.
To measure the glycemic index of food, you need a reference point. To deter-
mine that reference point, someone had to find a food that had a super-high
glycemic index — one of the nastiest foods you can eat in terms of turning to
sugar the minute you eat it. And the winner was . . . white bread! The glycemic
index of white bread was set at 100, and all foods are compared to it.
A food’s glycemic index is how much that food increases your blood sugar
level compared to how much that same amount of white bread would
increase it. (The amount of food is measured in grams of carbohydrates, not
by the weight or volume of the food.)
Some charts use pure glucose as the reference point instead of white bread.
In the white bread index, glucose has a glycemic index of 140, so different
charts have different glycemic indices for a particular food, depending on
whether they use the white bread or the glucose scale. To convert to a white
bread scale, multiply the score on the glucose scale by 1.4.
The lower the glycemic index, the less effect that food has on blood-glucose
levels. Obviously, the higher a food’s glycemic index, the more it causes a
spike in blood sugar.
The glycemic effect of foods depends on a bunch of things, including the type
of starch that’s in it, whether that starch is cooked, how much fat is present,
and the acidity. For example, adding vinegar or lemon juice (acidic) to a food
actually lowers the glycemic index. And fat or dietary fiber can help inhibit
the absorption of the carbohydrates, which also lowers the glycemic index.
That, by the way, is why a candy bar — which has fat in it — has a lower
glycemic index than a potato. Processing affects the glycemic index of a food,
too. The more highly processed a grain such as rice, corn, or wheat is, the
higher its glycemic index and the more quickly your blood sugar rises.
People with diabetes used to think they had to avoid sugar — as in table
sugar. But simple sugar (like table sugar) doesn’t make your blood-glucose
level rise any faster than complex carbohydrates do. That’s why using the
glycemic index is a more valuable tool in controlling blood-sugar levels than
cutting down on sugar is.
95
Chapter 6: Gluten-Free . . . Nutritiously

The glycemic index value tells you how fast a carbohydrate turns into glu-
cose, but it doesn’t tell you how much of that carbohydrate is in a particular
food. That’s where the glycemic load comes in. And as luck would have it,
that’s what I discuss in the next section.
Hauling the glycemic load (GL)
Using the glycemic index alone can be misleading. Watermelon, for example,
has a high glycemic index, but because watermelon’s mostly water, you’d
have to eat a lot of it to raise your blood sugar much. The glycemic load (GL)
measurement is actually a little more valuable. Glycemic load looks at how
many grams of available carbs a food provides. The available carbohydrates
are the ones that provide energy, like starch and sugar but not fiber.
The key is that glycemic load is measured by serving size, which not only stan-
dardizes the numbers so you can compare one food to another but also allows
you to add up your total glycemic load for each meal. Less than 80 glycemic
load units per day is a low-glycemic-load diet; more than 120 is high.
The only hitch with glycemic load and the reason I don’t include a chart of
foods and their glycemic loads is that the portion size is subjective. So a
small portion of white bread, for instance, may end up with a lower glycemic
load than a large portion of buckwheat. Then you’d see a run on white bread,
and the world would never be the same.
96
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 
Comparing the glycemic indices
Take a look at the glycemic indices of some
grains and starches. Remember, lower is
“better,” because a lower score means the food
doesn’t cause a rapid rise in your blood sugar.
You may find variations from one chart to
another. This glycemic index is based on the
glucose scale, where glucose = 100.

Potato (baked)

Food

Glycemic Index

Here’s an example of how serving size affects glycemic load. A baked Russet
Burbank potato has a glycemic index of 85 (that’s high!) and a glycemic load
of 26 for a 150-gram serving. A 120-gram serving of banana has a glycemic
index of 52 and a glycemic load of 12. The banana’s better for you. But if
you’re mainly concerned about blood sugar and your choice is between
eating that baked potato or two large bananas (130 grams each), you can
splurge on the potato — your blood-sugar level rises about the same amount
no matter which you eat.
To calculate the glycemic load, multiply the glycemic index percentage
(glycemic index divided by 100) times the grams of total carbohydrates per
serving. Of course, you also can go online and do a search for glycemic-load
charts that use standard serving sizes.
For each food, glycemic index and glycemic load numbers are ranked this way:
Glycemic Index
Glycemic Load
Low
Below 56
Below 11
Medium
56 to 69
11 to 19
High
70 and up
20 and up
What do blood sugar levels 
have to do with anything?
Lots. Your blood-sugar levels can have profound effects on your health in
many ways: disease cause and prevention, weight loss and weight gain,
moods, energy levels, and even how quickly you age.
The underlying principle is simple: What goes up must come down. When
you eat high-glycemic-load foods — such as bread, pasta, bagels, pizza, cook-
ies, and cakes (gluten-free or not) — your blood sugar spikes. And chasing
that spike in blood sugar is your friend insulin, a hormone produced by the
pancreas. Insulin’s job is to get nutrients from the blood and make them avail-
able to various tissues in the body.
Glucose is the fuel that your body uses. Insulin is in charge of getting the glu-
cose into the cells where they can use it for energy. Think of insulin as the
delivery guy — bringing glucose to the cells, opening the door, and tossing
the glucose inside.
When insulin shuttles the glucose from the bloodstream into the cells, insulin
lowers your blood sugar level (the sugar isn’t in the blood anymore; it’s in the
cells).
97
Chapter 6: Gluten-Free . . . Nutritiously

When your blood sugar level is high, your body makes a bunch of insulin to
try to bring that level down. The problem is that insulin is sometimes a little
too good at its job.
The high cost of high insulin
When you eat a lot of high-glycemic-load foods (see “Hauling the glycemic
load [GL]”), your blood sugar spikes and the pancreas has to work really
hard to pump out a bunch of insulin to bring the blood-sugar level down. And
it works — blood sugar drops fast. You crash. You get fatigued, sometimes a
little dizzy — and hungry.
When high-glycemic-load foods cause your blood sugar levels to spike and
then drop quickly, your hormones are strapped in the front seat on this
roller-coaster ride, wreaking havoc on your energy levels and even moods.
People who eat high-glycemic-load foods for years can develop a condition
called insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is when the body has so much
insulin all the time that it doesn’t respond like it should anymore. Usually,
just a little bit of insulin can bring blood sugar down, but in someone who’s
insulin resistant, this doesn’t happen. So in an effort to lower blood-sugar
levels, the body keeps producing insulin and has elevated levels of it all the
time. This can be very hard on the body.
Syndrome X, or metabolic syndrome, is a cluster of diseases caused by insulin
resistance. These conditions include
 Adult-onset diabetes (Type 2)
 High blood pressure
 Hardening of the arteries and damage to arterial walls
 High ratio of bad cholesterol to good
 Elevated blood uric acid levels (which can cause gout or kidney stones)
 Weight gain and obesity
 An excess of triglycerides (fat in the bloodstream)
Excess insulin is also blamed for nutrient deficiencies, including deficiencies
in calcium, magnesium, zinc, vitamin E, vitamin C, B complex vitamins, and
essential fatty acids.
Insulin also increases the amount of cortisol in the body. Cortisol is a stress
hormone that can accelerate aging and cause other health problems.

Taking a Healthful Approach 
to Gluten-Free Living
Being gluten-free is a great start! Rice, corn, potatoes, and other high-
glycemic-load foods are gluten-free, but they offer relatively little in the way
of nutritional value, and can, as I discuss in the preceding section, cause
some serious problems. Some awesome gluten-free specialty foods are avail-
able today, but loading up on those, as yummy as they are, isn’t doing your
body any favors, either.
Over the last 500 generations or so, individual human bodies have had to
adapt to foods like cereal grains, sugar, and dairy, because they’ve become
dietary staples. But in forcing their bodies to adapt, people have messed with
Mother Nature. The result is disease, discomfort, and overall physical and
emotional infirmity.
A healthier approach to the gluten-free lifestyle — or any lifestyle, for that
matter — is to eat what your body was designed to eat: meats, fish, seafood,
fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, and berries.
Dining with cavemen: The Paleolithic diet
I wasn’t there, but I think I can safely say that rarely, if ever, did cavemen eat
croissants. You know why? It’s because early humans were hunter-gatherers,
eating what they could hunt — and gather.
They ate what their bodies were designed to eat — lean meats, fresh fruits,
and nonstarchy vegetables. There was no agriculture, so there were no farm
animals or crops. That means no gluten.
You may be thinking that with some scary (and hairy) exceptions, today’s
humans don’t really resemble cavemen, so this stuff isn’t relevant — but
you’d be mistaken. DNA evidence shows that genetically, humans have hardly
changed at all in the last 40,000 years.
Because the hunter-gatherers I’m talking about lived in the Paleolithic era,
their diet is cleverly called the Paleolithic diet, which follows these basic
guidelines:
 Lean meat, fish, and seafood: Lean meat is key in the Paleolithic diet.
Back in the day, the slow, plump porkers that people eat today just
weren’t on the hunting grounds. Their animals were lean, mean, fighting
machines — as were the hunters who ate them.
99
Chapter 6: Gluten-Free . . . Nutritiously

I admit that a good wooly mammoth steak is hard to find these days. But
lots of lean meats are available at any store — you may even want to
experiment with lean game meat like alligator, buffalo, ostrich, kangaroo,
and rattlesnake.
 Fruits and nonstarchy vegetables: There are lots of great fruits you can
eat, including apples, figs, kiwis, mangos, cherries, and avocados. Just
about any vegetable is a good bet (except for starchy ones like potatoes,
yams, and sweet potatoes). Artichokes, cucumber, broccoli, cabbage,
spinach, and mushrooms offer lots of nutritional value.
 Nuts and seeds: Not only are these accepted on the Paleolithic diet, but
they’re a great source of monounsaturated fats, which tend to lower cho-
lesterol and decrease the risk of heart disease. Nuts and seeds include
almonds, cashews, Macadamia nuts, pecans, pistachios, pumpkin seeds,
sesame seeds, and sunflower seeds.
 No cereal grains: Grains weren’t part of the diet until about 10,000 years
ago. That’s yesterday, evolutionarily speaking. Interestingly, when grains
were introduced, health problems began to increase. While there’s no
scientific evidence to make a correlation, it’s interesting to note that the
average height of humans decreased, and people had more infectious
diseases than their ancestors, more childhood mortality, and shorter
lifespans. They had more osteoporosis, rickets, and other bone-mineral
disorders, as well as vitamin and mineral deficiencies that caused dis-
eases like scurvy, beriberi, pellagra, and iron-deficiency anemia.
 No legumes: Off-limit legumes include all beans, peas, peanuts, and 
soybeans.
 No dairy: It’s pretty easy to see why cavemen didn’t do milk. First, pic-
ture them catching a wild boar — what then? It begs the question, “How
many cavemen does it take to milk a wild boar?” If you’re worried that
you’re not going to get enough calcium if you cut out dairy, load up on
broccoli, cabbage, and celery. Some of the best sources of calcium come
from greens, like beet greens, kale, and mustard greens.
 No processed foods: (Of course.)
As a general rule, you can probably simplify the Paleolithic approach to: 
If humans made it, don’t eat it.
You have to choose a lifestyle that you’re comfortable with, that satisfies and
nourishes you — and that may be a modified version of this diet. But overall,
this approach offers complete nutrition, it’s comprised of foods that are low
glycemic-load, and best of all, it’s gluten-free.
Find your own balance. Everyone is different — maybe you don’t want or
need that much protein. Maybe you’re a vegetarian and choose to get your
protein from other sources. The approach I outline here is simply a starting
point to give you an idea of a healthful way to be gluten-free. For more infor-
mation, you can discuss the diet with your doctor or dietitian.

You can find lots of detailed information about the Paleolithic diet by doing a
quick Internet search. One of my favorite sites is www.thepaleodiet.com.
Comparing caveman-style 
to low-carb diets
Diet trends come and go faster than celebrity engagements. Within a matter of
weeks, the absolutely-guaranteed-to-make-you-lose-20-pounds-in-20-minutes
diet is replaced with an approach that doesn’t even remotely resemble it. So
how can they all be right? They can’t.
And I want to point out that although the caveman approach I outline in this
chapter can help you with weight management, my objective isn’t to talk
about weight loss; it’s to talk about achieving optimal health through 
nutrition — and that just happens to involve a gluten-free diet.
You’re probably gathering by now (that’s a pun, in case you missed it) that
the hunter-gatherer approach is low-carb. But it’s not like some of the other
no-carb or low-carb diets. Here are the important distinctions:
 This isn’t a low-carb or no-carb lifestyle. It’s a good carb lifestyle.
 Eliminating carbs as some diets recommend cuts out foods like fruits
and vegetables. That means you’re missing out on important vitamins,
minerals, fiber, antioxidants, and other nutrients.
 Some of the low-carb diets suggest eating high-fat foods like cheese,
butter, and bacon. These can cause cholesterol levels to skyrocket.
 Most popular low-carb, high-fat diet plans don’t make a distinction
between good fats and bad fats. Monounsaturated fats are good; satu-
rated fats are mostly bad. Polyunsaturated fats are a little of each,
depending on the ratio in which you eat them.
 Most low-carb, high-fat diets don’t talk about the dangers of salt.
People do need sodium in their diets to help regulate fluid balance, but if
you get too much of it, sodium can cause high blood pressure, which
can lead to heart disease and other health problems. It also messes with
the body’s ability to absorb calcium, which can eventually lead to bone
loss and osteoporosis.
Even if you don’t salt your food, you could be getting way too much salt
in your diet. The sodium that’s found naturally in foods like shellfish and
some cheeses isn’t usually a problem. But processed foods are often
loaded with sodium in the form of flavor enhancers, thickeners, and
preservatives. Even sodas often have sodium to help them maintain 
carbonation.
101
Chapter 6: Gluten-Free . . . Nutritiously

When you’re counting carbs, you can easily see why you get more food for
your carb count when you eat fruits and veggies than when you eat gluten.
The average carbohydrate content of fruits is about 13 percent. For non-
starchy vegetables, it’s about 4 percent; and it’s zero for lean meats, fish, and
seafood. The carbohydrate content of cereal grains like wheat, though, aver-
ages a whopping 72 percent.
Reviewing the more healthful approach
I cover a lot of ground in this chapter — the glycemic index, glycemic load,
the caveman diet, and clarifications on the low-carb/no-carb, good-carb/
bad-carb controversies. If you’re wondering what the heck I’m trying to
get at, you’re probably not alone.
It all boils down to this simple approach for a healthier gluten-free lifestyle:
 Keep it gluten-free, for sure. I don’t want you to get so lost in this
approach that you forget the whole point!
 Watch the carbs, making sure the carbs you’re eating are good carbs like
fruits and vegetables.
 Try to stick to low-glycemic-load foods, which raise your blood sugar
levels gradually.
 Make sure the foods you eat offer nutritional value. Stay away from
foods that are basically empty calories.
 A Paleolithic approach — eating seafood, lean meats, fruits, and non-
starchy vegetables — is extremely healthful. Modify the diet to meet
your personal preferences and needs.
102
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 
Differentiating between gluten-free and low-carb
People get confused because some of the low-
carb diets tend to be gluten-free, or at least
gluten-light, so they think gluten-free automati-
cally means low-carb — but it doesn’t work that
way.
In fact, gluten-free can be very high-carb.
Frequently when people give up gluten, they
choose gluten-free replacements, like gluten-
free breads, bagels, pastas, pizzas, cookies, and
brownies. Not only are those things high-carb,
but they’re basically empty calories, mean-
ing they offer very little nutrition — but lots of
calories.
Warning: The confusion between low-carb
diets and the gluten-free diet can be a danger-
ous misconception. On many low-carb pro-
grams, small amounts of gluten are allowed
back into the diet after the initial phases. For
many people who need to be gluten-free, rein-
troducing gluten to the diet is never okay.

Good food is food that goes bad quickly. That means fresh produce and other
foods without many preservatives.
Being Healthy, Stealthy, and Wise
Writing and reading about nutritious foods is one thing, but actually eating
them is another. What about the person who thinks broccoli is as palatable
as dandelions (don’t try this comparison at home; the dandelions in your
yard may be poisonous)?
Some people want the nutrients that good foods offer, but they (or the people
they’re feeding) don’t like the taste (or texture, consistency, color, density, or
idea) of nutritious foods. Don’t worry. You don’t have to love Brussels
sprouts to eat well. You just have to be creative about how you hide nutrient-
rich foods in your meals. Most of the time, people don’t even notice. Here are
a few ideas for being stealthy, healthy, and wise:
 Hide fruits and even veggies in a smoothie by cutting them into small
pieces and blending them in.
 Sneak broccoli, zucchini, and other veggies into lasagne or pasta sauce.
 Use a few tablespoons (or the amount recommended on the packaging)
of protein powder to pack a punch in a shake or smoothie.
 Use kefir instead of milk, yogurt, or sour cream. Smoothies are the easi-
est way to enjoy kefir — just mix it with berries and blend.
Kefir is a supernutritious, gluten-free fermented drink that tastes like and has
a consistency similar to yogurt. With live, active cultures, kefir is a prebiotic
and probiotic. These are foods that promote the growth of good bacteria in
the intestinal tract. You can find kefir near the milk and yogurt at most health
food stores, and sometimes it’s in the refrigerated health food section of gro-
cery stores.
Kefir is easily digested; it cleans the intestines and provides beneficial yeast,
vitamins and minerals, and complete proteins. Even if you’re lactose intoler-
ant, you can usually tolerate kefir because the yeast and bacteria contain lac-
tase, which “eats up” the lactose that’s left after culturing.
Avoiding nutritional pitfalls 
on the gluten-free diet
People often ask whether nutritional deficiencies arise as a result of being
gluten-free. The answer is maybe yes, and maybe no.
103
Chapter 6: Gluten-Free . . . Nutritiously

If you choose the healthful approach to gluten-free living that I outline in this
chapter, you shouldn’t need to worry about nutritional deficiencies. You’ll be
healthier than most people who eat gluten.
If, however, you eat a gluten-free diet that’s mostly gluten-free “replacement”
foods like breads, pizzas, pastas, cookies, brownies, and cakes — and if your
“vegetables” consist of rice, corn, potatoes, and the tomatoes in the pasta
sauce — then you may have some nutritional concerns.
When adopting a gluten-free lifestyle, people tend to turn to starchy stand-
bys, like rice, corn, and potatoes. You gravitate toward these foods partly
because they’re starchy, sort of like the bread, pasta, and bagels you were
accustomed to eating when you ate gluten. Ironically, the same foods that
you crave because they fill you up and give you that satiated feeling also
make you hungrier. I talk more about this in the “Losing weight on the gluten-
free diet” section.
Unfortunately, rice, corn, potatoes, and other starchy foods don’t offer much
in the way of nutrition — especially when you look at all the calories you get.
Not much nutritional bang for the caloric buck, so to speak.
Other foods offer that fill-me-up satisfaction, many of which provide far more
nutritional value and diversity than rice, corn, potatoes, or wheat. They
include
 Amaranth
 Buckwheat
 Mesquite
 Millet
 Montina (Indian ricegrass)
 Quinoa
 Sorghum
 Teff
These alternative grains offer complete protein, fiber, and lots of vitamins
and minerals. (If you want to read more about the nutritional value of these
wheat alternatives, check out Chapter 4.)
The most common concerns focusing on nutrient deficiencies in the gluten-
free diet revolve around folate or folic acid, iron, fiber, and B vitamins. The
B vitamins specifically lacking in some gluten-free flours include vitamin B1
(thiamin), B2 (riboflavin), and B3 (niacin). Choosing the healthier approach I
discuss is the best way to make up for any nutritional deficiencies. Supplements
may work, too, but make sure they don’t contain any gluten, and consult your
doctor first.
104
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 

Deficiencies in B-complex vitamins and iron may occur because when people
were still a glutenivore, they were eating lots of flour, which is usually
enriched and fortified with iron, riboflavin, niacin, and thiamine. Gluten-free
flours aren’t enriched.
Getting the fiber you need 
on a gluten-free diet
Fiber is important for lots of reasons. The most well-known benefit is that it
helps keep the gastrointestinal plumbing — ya know, poo-poo, doo-doo,
number two, caca — moving smoothly, and that’s good for the whole gas-
trointestinal tract. Fiber can help reduce cholesterol and lower your chance
of heart disease and cancer.
When people give up gluten and their diets consist mostly of gluten-free
flours like rice and potato or tapioca flours, they’re sometimes at risk of
having too little fiber in their diets. If you’re going to use flours, try to incor-
porate flax meal, Montina, chickpea, and amaranth flours into your cooking.
They have much more fiber than white or even brown rice.
The most healthful diet that ensures you an adequate intake of fiber is the
approach that most closely resembles the diet your ancestors ate, which is
high in fruits and nonstarchy vegetables. Some good food choices include
apples, kiwis, bananas, avocados, tomatoes, cabbage, broccoli, spinach, and
Brussels sprouts.
The whole truth (and nothing but) 
about whole grains
If you’re gonna do grains, the goal is whole. A grain has three parts: the germ,
the endosperm, and the bran. Whole-grain foods contain all three parts:
 Germ: This is the part of the grain that a new plant sprouts from, and it’s
where you can find a lot of niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin E, magne-
sium, phosphorus, iron, and zinc. It also has a little protein and some fat.
 Endosperm: The kernel of the grain, the endosperm is the bulk of the
seed. Because the seed stores its energy in the endosperm, it has most of
the protein and carbohydrates, as well as some vitamins and minerals.
 Bran: The outer layer of the seed, the bran contains most of the grain’s
nutrients. It’s a rich source of niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, magnesium,
phosphorus, iron, and zinc. This is where most of the fiber is, too.
105
Chapter 6: Gluten-Free . . . Nutritiously

Refined grains have been stripped of their bran and germ layers during pro-
cessing, so all that’s left is the endosperm. They contain some protein and
fat, and there may be some fiber and nutritional value left, but most of the
good stuff gets tossed out during the refining process — like the proverbial
baby with the bath water.
The individual components of whole grain — vitamins, minerals, fiber, and
other nutrients — work together to help protect against chronic diseases
such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Grain components are
synergistic, meaning that each individual component is important but the
value of the whole grain is greater than the sum of its parts.
Quinoa, buckwheat, and some of the other alternative grains I talk about in
Chapter 4 are whole grains, and they provide all the value that makes whole
grains so nutritious.
Refined grains usually have nutrients added back in, but they’re not as nutri-
tious as a whole-grain product would be, and they lack the fiber that whole
grain provides. (If the food were really nutritious, why would it need to be
fortified?)
Fruits have almost twice as much fiber as whole grains, and nonstarchy veg-
etables have about eight times more fiber. To maximize your fill of fiber, be
sure to eat the peel.
Winning the Weight Wars
The gluten-free diet is paradoxical — if you’re too heavy, it’s likely to help
you lose weight. If you’re too thin, it’s likely to help you gain it. I know, even
the miracle pills on TV don’t claim to swing both ways, helping you lose or
gain weight. But trust me . . . it’s true!
106
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 
Chewing the fat with mega omegas
Saying “fat is bad” is like saying politicians are
honest. Some are — some aren’t — but you
sure can’t label them all the same. Fats are the
same way — some are good, and some are bad.
The saturated kind, like you find in fatty meats
and cheeses, are bad, at least in excess. So are
the trans fats you find in hydrogenated oils.
Most people know these fats increase the bad
cholesterol and can contribute to heart attacks
and strokes.
Some fats are good, though — like mono- and
polyunsaturated fats. Omega-3 fatty acids —
like the ones in fish like wild salmon, whitefish,
tilapia, catfish, flounder, and mahi mahi — 
are super-beneficial. Not only do they keep 
the arteries clear, but they also affect your 
neurotransmitters — the chemical messengers
in your brain — reducing depression and
improving your moods.

Losing weight on the gluten-free diet
If you’re fighting the battle of the bulge, you’re obviously not alone. In 
today’s world of globesity, whether you’re part of the Boomer Generation or
Generation Y doesn’t matter: The majority of the population, regardless of
age, is Generation XL.
The good news is that the gluten-free diet may be the key to losing and main-
taining a healthy weight. Unfortunately, gorging on gluten-free brownies and
cookies isn’t part of this weight-loss plan; the key to weight control is that
you adhere to a high-protein, low-glycemic-load, nutrient-dense diet (see
“Dining with cavemen: The Paleolithic diet” and “Good Carbs, Bad Carbs:
Tuning In to the Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load”).
Battling hunger and cravings
Your blood-sugar levels affect hunger and cravings. Gluten-containing foods
like bread, crackers, and pretzels are enemy number one. Those foods — and
their gluten-free counterparts — cause a rapid rise in blood sugar, which
sends signals to your body to produce insulin.
Insulin does its job and brings down your blood-sugar level, but it brings it so
low that you get hungry and in fact crave more of the same kind of food that
made it go up in the first place. Insulin also tells your body to store fat.
High insulin levels also inhibit the release of serotonin, a neurotransmitter in
the brain that tells the body to stop eating.
On the other hand, when your body absorbs sugars slowly, as when you eat
low-glycemic-load foods and foods high in protein, the rise in blood sugar is
gradual, and so is its descent after insulin begins doing its job. The gentle
decline in blood sugar means your cravings are less.
Making too much insulin causes you to store fat and stimulates the liver to
make more cholesterol, increasing blood cholesterol levels. Excess insulin
also inhibits the breakdown of fat that’s already stored in your body, so even
if you’re working out like a fiend, losing those extra pounds is tough.
The power of protein
Protein is a strong ally in the battle of the bulge. It has a powerful thermogenic
effect, meaning it revs up your metabolism and helps you burn calories. It
also makes you feel fuller than fats or carbs do, so you tend to eat less than
you would if your meal were mostly carbs and fats.
Protein also stimulates your pancreas to produce a hormone called glucagon.
Glucagon’s job is to raise your blood sugar and promote the mobilization of
previously stored fat — so as you burn food reserves between meals, high
levels of glucagon help that energy to be taken from those fat thighs or spare
tire around your waist.
107
Chapter 6: Gluten-Free . . . Nutritiously

On the other hand, high-glycemic-load, carbohydrate-rich meals suppress
glucagon secretion. That means the stuff that mobilizes stored fat —
glucagon — isn’t there, but the hormone that promotes storage — insulin —
is. That’s a one-two punch to the waistline.
If you’ve been boning up on protein, you may have heard that eating too
much protein is bad for the bones. The idea is that extra protein can cause
your body to get rid of calcium instead of absorbing it like your body’s sup-
posed to do (to make strong bones). Although too much protein can cause
the calcium to leach from your bones (carbonated and caffeinated drinks can
cause the same thing), you have to eat a lot of protein to make that happen:
about 140 grams — the equivalent of a pound of chicken, fish, beef, or pork
or two-and-a-half pounds of nuts — all in one day.
Gaining weight on the gluten-free diet
Some people who have suffered malabsorption as a result of being gluten sen-
sitive or having celiac disease are underweight and actually need to pack on
the pounds.
When these people go gluten-free, their gut usually heals quickly, and they
begin to absorb nutrients and calories. Their weight is usually normalized
quickly simply as a result of being gluten-free.
108
Part I: Going Gluten-Free: Who, What, Why, and How 
Gaining unwanted weight on the gluten-free diet
Lots of people gain weight when they go gluten-
free, sometimes causing a weight problem that
wasn’t there before. This usually happens for
two reasons:
 People who have a form of gluten intoler-
ance often aren’t absorbing all their nutri-
ents — nor are they absorbing all their
calories — before they embark on a gluten-
free lifestyle. After they go gluten-free, their
health begins to improve, and they’re able
to absorb nutrients — and calories —
again. But they’re usually still eating the
same number of calories — often too many
to maintain their pre-gluten-free figure.
 Some people gain weight because they’re
eating lots of rice, corn, and potatoes,
which are high-glycemic-load foods that
immediately turn to sugar. They may also be
eating more than their fair share of gluten-
free treats like cookies, brownies, and
cakes in an effort to stave off feelings of
deprivation.
If you’ve packed on a few unwanted pounds
since going gluten-free, stick to a high-protein,
low-glycemic-load approach, and you should
have an easier time controlling your weight.

Sometimes when people go gluten-free, they inadvertently cut calories by
cutting out things like bread and butter. If you’re already underweight, you
may need to supplement the healthful diet I outline in this chapter with high-
calorie foods like nuts, avocados, tuna, and salmon.
Gaining an Athletic Advantage 
by Being Gluten-Free
Some athletes are afraid to go gluten-free because they’re worried they won’t
get enough carbohydrates in their diets to sustain their intense energy needs.
Carbs before, during, and after training or competition are essential to main-
taining energy levels and speeding recovery after the event.
Not only is getting the carbs you need as an athlete possible, but being
gluten-free can actually provide an athletic advantage. After all, you’re not
doing your carb-loading with pizza and spaghetti — those are relatively
worthless nutritionally speaking. These foods also cause blood-sugar peaks
and valleys because they’re high-glycemic-load foods, as I discuss in “Good
Carbs, Bad Carbs: Tuning In to the Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load.”
The gluten-freeness of the diet doesn’t deserve the credit in providing an ath-
letic advantage; it’s more the high-protein, low-glycemic-load approach (that
happens to be gluten-free) that counts. This approach has several advantages
for athletes:
 Enabling the body to gradually learn to use energy more efficiently from
fat stores and to be less dependent on the food in its gut
 Minimizing the hypoglycemic effect that sudden, intense exercise can
cause
 Increasing the free fatty acids in the bloodstream, enabling you to save
muscle glycogen (used for energy) during exercise
 Maintaining stable blood-sugar levels during exercise, which is essential
for the growth of muscle and strength, as well as for the flow of energy

The Preludes
to Cooking

In this part . . .
I
get you ready to cook your gluten-free meals. Hey, even
if your idea of cooking is warming a frozen dinner (yes,
frozen gluten-free meals are available!), you still need to
plan what you’re going to eat, buy it, and well, at least
warm it up. Whether you cook to live or live to cook, meal
planning, shopping, and preparing the food before you
cook it present some unique considerations when you’re
gluten-free.
Here, I offer a nutritious approach to gluten-free eating so
you can plan meals that are gluten-free and good for you.
I help you create and maintain a gluten-free-friendly kitchen
and offer recommendations for safely sharing the kitchen
with gluten. Then it’s off to the store, where I propose sev-
eral options for where and how to buy gluten-free foods
without breaking the bank. As the final prelude to cooking,
I offer tips and techniques that are unique to gluten-free
cooking, and I help you figure out how to make anything
gluten-free, even without a recipe.

Chapter 7
Creating a Gluten-Free-Friendly
Kitchen
In This Chapter
 Encouraging “glutenous” and gluten-free foods to coexist in the kitchen
 Ingredients and products you want to have on hand
Your idea of cooking may involve only a can opener and a microwave. Or
you may have kitchen gadgets no one else knows how to use, tote mys-
tery ingredients home from faraway lands, and subscribe to magazines most
people can’t pronounce. No matter how you feel about cooking, you spend
lots of time in the kitchen.
When you’re gluten-free, the kitchen needs a little extra attention. Keeping
yourself safely gluten-free isn’t hard, but you need to keep some special con-
siderations in mind, especially if your kitchen contains gluten.
Sharing the Kitchen with Gluten
When our kids were little and we’d take long road trips (parental torture
chambers on wheels), my kids would screech, “Mommy, Kelsie’s looking out
my window!” to which Kelsie would quickly retort, gasping for air, “That’s
because Tyler’s breathing my air! He took it all!” And the drama continued for
hours (whose idea was this?).
Sometimes when I think of gluten in the kitchen, I envision the same scenario
(flashbacks?): “Hey, wheat bread! Get outta here. This is gluten-free territory.”
“Just because they pay twice as much for you doesn’t mean they like you
more.” “I think you spit a crumb on me! Now I’m contaminated!” Okay, now
you know way too much about my issues and my fantasy world, so I’ll get to
the point.

Some people think that the only way to be 100 percent gluten-free is to make
the entire household gluten-free (see Chapter 17 for the pros and cons of
this). Not true. Sure, doing so makes things easier — menu planning and
cooking are simpler, and if the whole house is gluten-free, you don’t have to
worry about possible mix-ups or contamination (and no feuding between the
breads). But if you choose to share your kitchen with gluten, you’ll be fine.
Here are some tips for sharing a kitchen with gluten:
 Gluten-free comes first. If you’re making two varieties of a meal —grilled
cheese sandwiches, for example — make the gluten-free one first. That
way, the preparation surface, knives (always plural — see “The gob drop
for spreadables” in this chapter), and pans stay uncontaminated. If you
make the gluten-containing one first, you either have to wash the pan or
griddle thoroughly before making the gluten-free sandwich or use an
entirely separate pan.
 Foil is your friend. Using lots of aluminum foil makes your life easier.
Cover cookie sheets with it, use it to separate different foods, and warm
foods on foil rather than setting them directly on an oven rack. Foil is a
great way to ensure your gluten-free foods aren’t being contaminated.
 Vacuum sealers save time. You may find that you’re making more home-
made foods than you used to, like gluten-free breads, cookies, pizzas,
and so on. Remember, homemade foods don’t have preservatives in
them (a good thing), so they go bad quickly (a bad thing). You can save
time and money by making foods in larger quantities and then vacuum-
sealing them so they stay fresh longer. Doing so is convenient, too,
because you can vacuum seal individual servings and toss them in
lunches or take them on the go.
 Freeze it. Again, homemade foods don’t have preservatives, so they
don’t last as long. Freeze them, and then use them when you need to.
 Use brightly colored labels. Because you’re likely to have some left-
overs that are gluten-free and some that aren’t, consider using brightly
colored stickers or labels to stick on the storage containers so you can
easily tell which leftovers are gluten-free. This is especially helpful if you
have babysitters or other people in the house who may be likely to grab
the wrong one.
Avoiding cross-contamination
When you’re sharing a kitchen with gluten, gluten can contaminate (or 
glutenate, as I like to say) your food in several ways. Crumbs seem to throw
themselves off gluten-containing breads and other foods, turning perfectly
good gluten-free zones into danger zones in the blink of an eye.
114
Part II: Planning and Preparing: The Preludes to Cooking 

Not only do crumbs fly, but preparation surfaces, pots, pans, grills, and uten-
sils can contaminate food, too. You know those neat-freaks who drive every-
one nuts because they’re compulsive about cleaning? Take a hard look in the
mirror and embrace the reality, because that’s you now. Cleanliness isn’t an
option anymore; it’s crucial to maintaining the purity of your gluten-free
lifestyle.
Crumbs: Public enemy number one
If you think ants are your biggest problem in the kitchen, think again. The
ants just go marching one by one (hurrah), and although certainly a nui-
sance, they don’t hurt you even if you eat them. No, enemy number one in
the gluten-free-friendly kitchen is the almighty crumb. Crumbs fly off bread
like sparks in a fireworks display, and they’re everywhere. I’m not pointing all
the crumb-tossing blame at the gluten-containing kind of bread; in fact, quite
the opposite. I won’t name names, but between gluten-containing and gluten-
free breads, everyone knows who the real winner is in the crumb-casting
competition.
So here’s the deal: When you work really hard to prepare a delicious gluten-
free sandwich and then set it on the counter in a pile of gluten-containing
crumbs, you are, literally, eating a gluten-containing sandwich, and your
efforts to find, buy, and compile gluten-free makin’s are all for naught. If you
think a few crumbs don’t matter, you’re assigned to go read Chapters 2 and 5.
Six times.
Even a few crumbs from gluten-containing breads or crackers can turn your
gluten-free food into a toxic treat. Be diligent about cleaning crumbs, and
remember the golden rule: When in doubt, leave it out. If you’re not sure that
your meal is uncontaminated, don’t eat it.
So what about gluten-free crumbs? Do you have to be obsessive about wiping
those up? Yes, if you’re sharing your kitchen with gluten. Not for the sake of
good hygiene as much as because you can’t tell whether they’re gluten-free
by looking at them, so you never know for sure whether you’re setting your
sandwich in gluten or not. (And then you have to consider those annoying
little marching ants.)
New rules for kitchen tools
You don’t need to stock up on new pots, pans, tools, and utensils, but you do
need to pay attention to how you use the ones you have. For the most part, if
you clean your kitchen items well, you get the gluten off them. Nonstick sur-
faces that clean easily and thoroughly are especially safe.
115
Chapter 7: Creating a Gluten-Free-Friendly Kitchen

Keep in mind a couple of exceptions. I recommend having separate colanders
and pasta servers if you’re making both gluten-containing and gluten-free
pastas in your kitchen. Clearly label one as being gluten-free only. Pasta tends
to leave a residue that’s sometimes tricky to get off. You don’t want to drain
gluten-free pasta in a colander that has remnants of the gluten-containing
pasta on it. Same goes for the pasta servers.
I also suggest buying separate pots, pans, or utensils if you have a favorite
item and it just doesn’t clean well — a special crêpe pan, for instance. If you
can see (or sense) that traces of gluten could remain there and you don’t
want to part with the pan to get one that cleans more thoroughly, just don’t
use it for your gluten-free cooking. I encourage you to mark your separate
items well — one saying “gluten-free only” and the other saying “gluten” — so
you don’t get them mixed up.
Using a permanent marker may not be the latest trend in kitchen design, but
it can save you from being unsure and may even spare you health-threatening
mix-ups. A big, bold “GF ONLY” on your gluten-free utensils can reduce the
chance of inadvertently contaminating your gluten-free foods by using the
wrong kitchen items.
The gob drop for spreadables
The gob drop isn’t a new teen fashion trend, dance move, or tasteless refer-
ence to body parts that have succumbed to gravity and an overzealous
appetite. The gob drop is an action (and somewhat of an art), one that you
need to master if you share your kitchen with gluten.
116
Part II: Planning and Preparing: The Preludes to Cooking 
The tale of two toasters
Have you ever looked inside a toaster or toaster
oven? Of course you have. What do you see?
Crumbs. Lots of crumbs. If you’re sharing a
kitchen with gluten, some of those crumbs are
probably of the gluten-containing variety. That
means your gluten-free bread has lost its 
“-free.”
You have a few options in dealing with this
dilemma. First, I recommend using a toaster
oven instead of a toaster. For one thing, it’s more
versatile — you can actually bake things in a
toaster oven, and when you want to heat a small
quantity of something, it’s very handy. But more
importantly, you can remove the racks and
wash them, and you have easy access to the
crumb tray for cleaning. (Although if your
toaster oven has a convection feature, remem-
ber to keep it turned off — otherwise the fan
can blow flour and crumbs all over your gluten-
free foods.)
Another option is to buy a second toaster or
toaster oven if you can afford it. That’s really the
safest way to ensure you’re not getting gluten
crumbs on your gluten-free toast. If you don’t
have a second toaster or toaster oven, at least
try to wipe the grills (while they’re cool and the
machine is unplugged) before toasting your
gluten-free bread.
You can also buy toaster bags that you slide
your toast or sandwich into before putting them
in a toaster, toaster oven, or oven.

But first let me define my highly technical term spreadables. Spreadables are
the foodstuffs you spread onto other foodstuffs. You know — mayonnaise,
butter, margarine, jelly, peanut butter, honey (unless you buy the little
squeezy bear), and other things usually falling into the condiment category.
You can buy most of these condiments in squeeze bottles, but you should
still learn the gob drop — you may want to buy spreadables in jars because
of price or flavor (and squeezable peanut butter is just weird).
Most people dip their knives into containers, scooping out some of the
spreadable, and then spread said spread onto their bread, cracker, tortilla, or
other spreadee. Then they scoop a little more and continue the process. Each
time the knife goes from a gluten-containing spreadee back in the spreadable,
gluten crumbs get a free ride into the container, contaminating the entire tub
or jar. And you know what they say about one bad apple.
That’s why you need to do the gob drop. But first, toss out all the contami-
nated tubs and jars you have. Either keep all future tubs and jars gluten-free
(by practicing the gob drop faithfully), or buy separate tubs, mark them
clearly, and don’t ever mix them up. For more on the damage even a small
amount of gluten can do, see Chapter 2.
Here’s how you do the gob drop to keep your spreads gluten-free:
1. Use a knife to scoop out some of the spreadable.
2. Flick the spreadable onto the spreadee (see Figure 7-1).
3. Use the knife to continue with that process until you have enough of
the spreadable on the spreadee.
4. You may then begin spreading.
Admittedly, the gob drop takes practice. Flick too hard, and you miss the
spreadee altogether. Don’t flick hard enough, and it won’t come off the knife.
In dire situations, you may need a second knife to scrape the spreadable off
knife number one.
Of course, you can use knife number one to spread, but you can’t put a knife
you’ve spread with back into the jar or tub. If you need more of the spread-
able, you have to break out another knife.
People frequently ask, “Can I put the knife back into the spreadables if I used
it to spread something onto gluten-free bread?” No. Because you’ll not only
end up with crumbs in the spreadables, which is gross, but you’ll always
wonder whether those crumbs are the gluten kind or the gluten-free kind.
Resist the temptation.
Another frequently asked question is: “Do we have to do the gob drop if our
entire household is gluten-free?” No (that’s why this section falls under the
“Sharing the Kitchen with Gluten” section), but ending up with tubs and jars
full of crumbs is still really gross.
117
Chapter 7: Creating a Gluten-Free-Friendly Kitchen

Gracious guests can lead to grief
Having too many cooks in the kitchen is bad enough, but when you’re trying
to keep your foods safely gluten-free and your visitors are especially “help-
ful,” maintaining a gluten-free zone can be more than a tinge stressful. Sweet
Aunt Mabel’s gracious offer to help butter the bread can have you diving to
protect your pristine (and well-marked) tub of margarine because you haven’t
yet taught her to properly execute the gob drop. And as you rescue the mar-
garine and quickly try to decide whether teaching her the gob drop (and hov-
ering over her so she doesn’t make a mistake) would be easier than just
buttering the bread yourself, Uncle Bob is getting ready to flip the burgers —
and the buns — with the same spatula!
If your visitors are one-time or occasional guests, give them safe tasks to
keep them busy and let them lend a hand — somewhere that won’t put your
gluten-free foods in peril. Have them pour the iced tea or set the table. But if
they’re frequent visitors, you probably need to invest the time to teach them
the gob drop. Your spreadables are at risk! Your other options are to hide the
tubs and jars and buy squeezables for their visit or to buy separate contain-
ers and clearly mark which ones are gluten-free.

Part II: Planning and Preparing: The Preludes to Cooking 

Storing foods separately for convenience
For the most part, you don’t need to have separate storage spaces for the
gluten-containing and gluten-free foods unless you do so for convenience pur-
poses. After all, simply reaching up to the gluten-free section of your pantry
for a gluten-free flour mixture is easier than sorting through the shelves.
If you have kids on a gluten-free diet and others in the family still eat gluten —
or if some people in the home have behavioral issues or learning disorders —
then having separate storage areas can be a very good idea. For these gluten-
free loved ones, it’s easy to look in a pantry and be overwhelmed with all the
things they can’t eat, even if the things they can eat actually outnumber
the things they can’t.
By separating gluten-containing and gluten-free foods in the pantry, not only
do you make quickly choosing from their safe shelves quite easy, but the
number of things they can eat becomes more obvious to them. This can be a
big psychological boost in what could otherwise be a daunting experience.
Consider marking gluten-free foods with a “GF” right when you get home from
the store so the kids will have an easier time helping you put everything
away in the right place.
Taking Inventory of the
Pantry and Fridge
You want to have some basic ingredients and products specific to the gluten-
free diet on hand. Admittedly, some of these items are a little pricier than
their gluten-containing counterparts, and they’re sometimes a little harder to
find. In Chapter 8, I suggest where to buy them and how to save as much
money as you can. But depending on how you cook (or don’t), many of these
items may become staples in your gluten-free-friendly kitchen.
Specialty ingredients to stock
Don’t let this long list scare you. You don’t need all these things; in fact, if
you’re not going to do any baking, you probably don’t need any of them. If,
however, you’re planning to cook or bake gluten-free, consider having some
of these ingredients on hand:
119
Chapter 7: Creating a Gluten-Free-Friendly Kitchen

 Arrowroot flour: Higher in nutritional value than some other flours,
arrowroot often takes the place of cornstarch.
 Brown rice flour: This flour still contains the bran, which makes it more
nutritious than white rice flour. It has a slightly nutty taste.
 Cornstarch: You can use cornstarch for thickening or with other flours
in baking mixtures.
 Corn flour: You can blend corn flour with other flours for baking, or you
can mix it with cornmeal (ground corn) in cornbreads and other dishes.
 Garbanzo/fava bean flour (or blend): Don’t let the names scare you;
these are some of the best baking flours around today. They offer a great
texture and extra nutritional value, and they don’t taste like beans.
 Gelatin powder (unflavored): A lot of the gluten-free recipes now call
for unflavored gelatin because it adds moisture and protein and it holds
the ingredients together.
 Guar gum: You don’t need both xanthan gum and guar gum, but you can
use one in place of the other. Be aware that some people find guar gum
to have a laxative effect.
 Lecithin: Lecithin is an emulsifier, which just means it helps ingredients
blend together. Made from soy, lecithin improves aeration and the tex-
ture of baked gluten-free foods, and it makes the food a little more resis-
tant to getting stale.
 Potato starch flour: This is not the same thing as potato flour (which
tastes very much like potatoes). Potato starch is very fine, white flour. It
doesn’t have much flavor, so it doesn’t distort the taste of your foods,
but it improves the texture in baking mixes. You can use it as a thickener
or with other flours in baking mixtures.
 Sorghum (milo) flour: This nutritious flour is making more and more of
a mark in the gluten-free cooking world. Its relatively bland flavor makes
it a versatile ingredient in gluten-free baking.
 Soy flour: These days, people use soy flour mostly in combination with
other flours, if at all. It has a strong, distinctive flavor, which some
people love but others definitely don’t.
 Sweet rice flour: Some people get confused because sweet rice flour is
made from glutinous rice, not to be confused with “glutenous” (which
technically isn’t a word, although I use it often). Glutinous just means
sticky. Sweet rice flour cooks differently from white rice flour, and people
use it most often for thickening sauces or soups.
 Tapioca flour (or starch): This is also called cassava flour or manioc. It’s
great because it gives gluten-free foods a little bit of a stretch or chew
that’s lacking in many foods that don’t contain gluten.
120
Part II: Planning and Preparing: The Preludes to Cooking 

 White rice flour: Long considered the basic ingredient in a gluten-free
diet, white rice flour is being overshadowed by more nutritious flours
and flours with better consistencies, like bean, brown rice, arrowroot,
and sorghum. But white rice flour is, nevertheless, a staple in the gluten-
free pantry. Its bland flavor doesn’t distort the taste of baked goods, and
it comes in different textures (fine through regular), which affect the
consistency of foods.
 Xanthan gum: A must if you’re baking gluten-free breads and other
baked goods, xanthan gum helps prevent crumbling.
 Yeast: Dry, active yeast is an important ingredient for gluten-free breads
and other foods that need to rise. Don’t use the rapid-rise yeast unless
the recipe suggests it. Fresh yeast is key.
 Alternative grains: These are the grains (they’re not really all grains,
but people call them that) I talk about — and espouse the virtues of —
in Chapter 4. They’re loaded with nutrients, and they’re great to have on
hand either as baking flours or as whole grains. Use whole grains to add
flavor and texture, cook them as their own dish, or even add them to
foods (see Chapter 9 to find out how to cook with these). Here are some
alternative grains to check out:
• Amaranth
• Buckwheat
• Mesquite
• Millet
• Montina
• Quinoa
• Sorghum
• Teff
Grains — especially whole grains — have a lot of oil in them. Oil can turn
rancid quickly, so when you buy whole grains and whole-grain flours, be sure
to shop at stores where the turnover is high, and buy only what you plan to
use within a few months. Refrigerate the flours and grains if you have the
space, but pay close attention to the smell. Old flours and grains smell stale.
Mixes to have on hand
You should keep several types of gluten-free baking mixes on hand so you’re
always prepared. These mixes are not a compromise, nor are they (in my
opinion) “cheating.” They’re so good that in many cases, I think the gluten-
free variety would win a side-by-side taste comparison. Best of all, with very
little work on your part, your house smells like you’ve been baking all day!
(You can see Chapter 9 for more on baking with mixes.)
121
Chapter 7: Creating a Gluten-Free-Friendly Kitchen

Some people complain about the cost of mixes, and I admit that they’re a tad
pricey. But if you add up the cost of the ingredients to make baked goods
from scratch (have you priced xanthan gum lately?), factor in the batches
that yield only inedible hand weights, and consider that your time is at least
somewhat valuable, I think the price is well worth it.
Here are some of the mixes I suggest you keep handy:
 All-purpose baking mix: Several companies make various types of all-
purpose baking mixes, and most are excellent. Some companies use the
garbanzo/fava bean mixture, and some use mixtures of other gluten-free
flours. Use these mixes for baking or as a coating for fried or baked
foods (and flip to Chapter 9 for other foods that make great coatings).
 Bread mixes: Many different kinds of bread mixes are available today,
most of which you can fix in a bread machine or can mix by hand and
cook in the oven.
 Brownies: The brownie mixes today are absolutely amazing. Some come
with chunks of chocolate, but if they don’t, you can add your own.
 Cakes: Gluten-free cake mixes come in just about any flavor you want,
and these days they’re all incredibly moist, light, and tasty. With slight
modifications that are almost always on the package, you can make your
cakes into cupcakes.
 Chebe: Chebe is so unique that I couldn’t figure out which heading to
put it under — bread, all-purpose baking mix, or pizza — so it’s on its
own, and it’s good enough to stand alone. You can make Chebe, which
comes from manioc (tapioca), into bread rolls or sticks, pizza crust, or a
variety of other foods. Truly, your creativity is the only limiting factor.
New varieties of Chebe have recently appeared in the marketplace.
 Cookies: The gluten-free cookie mixes today are fantastic. They come in
just about any flavor you can dream up, and they turn out better than
anything you can get from a store. Of course you can tailor them to your
tastes by adding chocolate chips or gluten-free candies.
 Muffins: You can make many different varieties of gluten-free muffins,
including vanilla, blueberry, apple, and banana. You can also buy basic
muffin mixes that you can make into any type of muffin you want.
 Pancakes and waffles: One mix makes both; just the proportions of ingre-
dients change (and of course you need a waffle iron to make waffles).
 Pie crusts: In Chapter 9, I give you suggestions for making your own pie
crusts from crushed cereal or cookies. But if you want something closer
to the real deal, the mixes available for pie crusts are what you’re look-
ing for. These crusts are easy to make and delicious, and the mixes turn
out a perfect crust every time.
 Pizza dough: Mixes to help you whip up a quick pizza crust are avail-
able. You just top the crust with your favorite toppings, and the pizza is
as good as or better than anything other people deliver.
122
Part II: Planning and Preparing: The Preludes to Cooking 

Keep in mind that most gluten-free foods, even many of those you buy com-
mercially, don’t have preservatives in them. That means that unlike a store-
bought pastry that has a shelf life of seven millennia, your gluten-free foods
should be refrigerated or even frozen. 
Specialty pre-made products to consider
In addition to purchasing mixes that you can make at home, you can buy pre-
made gluten-free products at natural foods stores, online, or even at some
grocery stores (see Chapter 8 for more on shopping strategies). In fact, some
of the natural foods stores are beginning to make their own gluten-free baked
goods and are marketing them under a private label. I don’t cover those prod-
ucts here because they’re each specific to their own store.
In this section, I recommend pre-made gluten-free foods that you should keep
on hand as staples for your pantry.
 Bagels: Believe it or not, gluten-free bagels are available, and most of them
are great. They even come in different flavors. These bagels usually come
frozen, but if not, stick them in the freezer. They’re not always sliced, so
you have to thaw them a little (remember, too long in a microwave makes
them soggy and tough), cut them in half, and then toast them.
 Bread: It’s true: Some stores are now selling freshly baked gluten-free
breads (and other gluten-free baked goods) in their bakery sections.
Unbelievable! If you’re not lucky enough to live near one of those stores,
you can buy pre-made gluten-free bread online, at natural foods stores,
or in the specialty sections of some grocery stores. If the bread’s not
frozen when you buy it, put it in the freezer when you get home. Flavors
of these breads are all over the board. Some breads are definitely better
than others, so be prepared to experiment with a few varieties before
you find one you like.
All gluten-free bread is best if you toast it first, even if you plan to eat it
later (like in a lunch box).
 Cereals: Not too many big-company commercial cereals sold in “regular”
grocery stores are gluten-free, other than the colored sugar flakes in a
box. But peruse the aisles of a natural foods store or health food aisle of
your grocery store, and you’ll probably find lots of gluten-free cereals to
choose from.
Aside from the obvious no-nos like wheat, the usual glutenizing culprit in
cereal is malt or malt flavoring. Malt can be derived from corn, but it’s
usually from barley.
 Cookies: Gluten-free cookies are taking up more of the shelf space at nat-
ural foods stores and even specialty aisles of grocery stores. Most of
them are excellent.
123
Chapter 7: Creating a Gluten-Free-Friendly Kitchen

 Crackers: Not so long ago, gluten-free crackers were but a dream. Today
they’re not only a reality, but they’re delicious. The type of cracker that’s
easiest to find at natural foods stores or specialty aisles of grocery
stores is a rice cracker, marketed sometimes as a high-end specialty
product and other times as an Asian cracker. Either way, they’re crunchy
and delicious. You can also buy nut crackers, corn crackers, and even
Ritz-type crackers you can order online.
 Donuts: Yep. You can buy gluten-free donuts. They usually come frozen,
and you just defrost them on a very low power for a few seconds until
they’re ready (or better yet, let them sit at room temperature for about
half an hour).
 Frozen dinners and sides: If you’re new to this lifestyle, you may not get
how incredible this is, but those who have been doing this for a very
long time are shocked and awed by the fact that they can actually buy
frozen dinners and side dishes — good ones! — at natural foods stores,
online, or even at some regular grocery stores.
 Pasta: Gluten-free pasta these days comes in all shapes, sizes, and fla-
vors. Made from white rice, brown rice, corn, quinoa, potato, and blends
of all the above, you can find lasagna, penne, spaghetti, angel hair, fet-
tuccini, macaroni, and any other cut of pasta you’re looking for. Best of
all, long gone are the days when pasta turned to mush and you needed a
spoon to eat your spaghetti. Today’s gluten-free pastas have the same
texture as regular pasta and sometimes offer far more nutritional value.
 Pre-made pizza crusts: These pizza crusts usually come frozen (if not,
you want to freeze them when you get home). Just take them out of the
freezer; add your favorite sauce, cheese, and toppings; and bake for 
10 to 15 minutes, and you have the gluten-free population’s number-
one-most-missed food: pizza!
See? With all these specialty products available, you don’t have to miss out
on anything on the gluten-free diet. Except gluten, of course!

A
fter the doctor diagnosed my son Tyler with celiac disease, the first
thing I did was go shopping. No, not the head-for-the-mall-because-I’m-
shattered-and-surely-a-new-outfit-will-make-me-feel-better kind of shopping. I
went grocery shopping. This is a book about food, ya know.
Now keep in mind that this was way back in the 1900s — 1991, to be exact.
There was no Internet, I had no books, no source of information that I knew
of at all. When I told the crotchety hospital dietitian that I needed dietary
guidelines, she thought I meant glucose-free. And when I insisted I meant
gluten-free, she said, “We haven’t had that before,” and dug out a tattered
sheet of 7,456 things Tyler would never be able to eat again.
So off to the store we went, and I asked then-toddler Tyler what he wanted for
a snack. This was, after all, his diet (I’ve since gone gluten-free, too). His eyes
lit up, and he declared, “Crackers,” so we skipped to the cracker aisle
together and began to read labels.
Could it be? No, nope, not here — no “gluten” on the label anywhere!
Yessssss! This was going to be easier than I thought.
First, I have to defend my intelligence, lest you think I have the I.Q. of sand. I
was in shock — we were shopping truly just hours after the diagnosis — and I
wasn’t thinking clearly. Second, it’s true: None of the cracker packages had
“gluten” on the label (okay, that one’s weak). My maybe-if-I-hope-hard-
enough-it’ll-be-true story just goes to show you that you’re not alone if you’ve
been a little — ahem — stymied by the process of shopping for gluten-free
foods.

The good news is that finding gluten-free products really is easier than you
may think, and thanks to new labeling laws and manufacturer awareness, it’s
getting easier all the time.
In this chapter, I start by helping you figure out what you want to buy. 
Then I offer some guidance on where to shop, how to shop, and — this is
important — how to save money on gluten-free foods. You can find important
shopping tips to save you time, money, frustration, and the embarrassment
of having to tell a story like mine.
Knowing What You Want
One of the best things you can do to make shopping easier when you’re
enjoying a gluten-free lifestyle is to plan ahead. If you try to wing it, especially
at first, you end up spending hours in the grocery store walking in circles,
trying to figure out what to eat, what to buy, and then worrying whether the
food’s gluten-free.
Not only do planning meals ahead of time and making shopping lists save you
time and headaches in the store, but these steps give you the peace of mind
that the meals you’re planning are, in fact, gluten-free. Heck, if you’ve read
Chapter 6, they may even be ultranutritious.
Planning your meals
In my other life, when I’m a businesswoman and not an author, I follow the
dictum “plan your work, and work your plan.” Same thing goes for meals,
although “plan your meals and eat ’em” isn’t quite as catchy or clever.
Most people think planning meals sounds like a great idea, and they’re able to
pull it off once or twice. But for the most part, they’re spontaneous and
impulsive. They see something in the store that looks particularly appealing
(and because they’re usually starving while they’re shopping, everything
looks good), and they toss it in the cart. But planning meals helps you strate-
gize before you head to the store.
When you’re planning your meals, try not to think in terms of cutting out
gluten, but instead think of how you can make substitutions. Think about the
things you love to eat — with or without gluten — and build around those
foods, making the substitutions you need to make to convert gluten-containing
meals into gluten-free ones. (In Chapter 9 I explain how to make anything
gluten-free with simple substitutions.)
126
Part II: Planning and Preparing: The Preludes to Cooking 

I know sitting down and making a meal plan is tough, but it pays off in spades
when you’re at the store and you find your busy weekdays speeding by. You
may find some of these tips helpful:
 Have the whole family eat gluten-free. Even if some members of your
family are still gluten-eaters, make your life simpler by planning most, if
not all, of the family meals to be gluten-free. This planning isn’t hard if
you follow the approach of eating meats, fruits, vegetables, and other
natural foods (see Chapter 6 for more on this approach). And even if
your meal includes things like pasta, the gluten-free varieties these days
are so delicious that the entire family will love them — and may not
even know the difference.
 Plan a few days’ menus at once. Look through cookbooks (no, they
don’t have to be gluten-free ones) and at individual recipes for inspira-
tion, keeping in mind the healthy guidelines I talk about in Chapter 6.
Remember, the gluten-free diet is not all about rice, corn, and potatoes.
In fact, the more variety, the better. Variety isn’t just the spice of life; it’s
important from a nutritional standpoint.
 Plan a marathon cooking day. Maybe you designate Sundays to be your
day in the kitchen. With the week’s worth of meals already in mind, you
can prepare several meals at once, saving yourself time cooking and
cleaning up during the week.
 Use foods that can do double-duty. If you’re planning to cook a large
roasting chicken for dinner one night (I just happen to have a tasty
recipe for one in Chapter 13), you can count on leftovers for chicken stir-
fry the next night.
 Plan meals you can cook in a slow cooker. Slow cookers are great for
complete one-course meals. And walking into a house that smells like
you’ve been cooking all day is so nice!
Have the whole family help with menu planning. Nothing is more frustrating
than spending a weekend planning, shopping, and cooking only to hear
moans and groans about how what used to be someone’s favorite food is now
“gross.” For that matter, enlist help with the cooking and cleanup, too.
Making lists
Your spontaneity is exactly what food manufacturers are banking on. They
want you to be impulsive, and that’s why they tempt you with the delicious-
but-oh-so-bad-for-you high-profit-margin foods at the ends of aisles and check-
out stands. (I talk more about store layout in the section titled “Navigating the
Aisles” because you need to know the marketing secrets so you don’t get
sucked in.) How many times have you roamed the grocery store thinking of
yummy, healthy meals to make for the week, only to get home with dozens of
bags of groceries, unable to remember a single meal? Yeah, me, too.
127
Chapter 8: Shopping Is Easier Than You Think

At the risk of sounding a little elementary here, shopping lists are really help-
ful. Not only do they remind you of foods and ingredients you need, but they
help prevent impulse shopping.
Keep a running list of what you’re running low on or what you need to buy
next time you’re at the store. Make sure the list is handy for everyone in the
family so no one whines that you “forgot” a favorite food (when you didn’t
even know that was a favorite food).
As you do your menu planning, add the ingredients you need for your week’s
worth of meals to the list. If you need to call manufacturers to find out
whether some of the ingredients are gluten-free, now’s the best time to do it
(if the product’s not sitting in front of you, you can usually find the manufac-
turer’s phone number online). Don’t wait till you’re in the store, because you
may find the company’s customer service representatives have all gone
home for the day. Oh, and don’t forget to take the list with you (that’s a note
to myself, because I usually forget it)!
If you’re a coupon-clipper, clip your coupons and refer to your grocery list
and the store ads. Can you replace items on your list with ones that are on
sale or that you have coupons for? You may even find that the coupons pro-
vide inspiration for meal-planning.
Don’t forget the snacks! Whether your idea of a snack is ice cream or raisins,
snacks are an important part of your day. When you’re making your shopping
list, encourage your family members to add their favorite snacks — preferably
the healthy kind — so you don’t have to hear, “There’s nothing to eat in this
house!”
Deciding What to Buy
Obviously, the most important considerations for figuring out what to buy
are what do you like, what are you going to make, and is it gluten-free?
Keep in mind the two kinds of gluten-free foods: those that companies make
as specialty items and those that are naturally gluten-free.
Checking out gluten-free specialty products
Gluten-free specialty items come from companies that specifically market some
or all of their products to the wheat-free/gluten-free community. Most of the
time, these products are foods — such as pasta, bread, crackers, cookies, and
brownies — that would normally have gluten in them but have been formu-
lated to be gluten-free. (See Chapter 7 for more on available specialty items.)
128
Part II: Planning and Preparing: The Preludes to Cooking 

The specialty products are almost always labeled “gluten-free,” so you don’t
have to question their safety as far as your dietary restrictions are con-
cerned. The companies that make these products generally make several
product lines and sell their foods by mail, online, or at specialty retailers.
These days, “regular” grocery stores are starting to carry more of these spe-
cialty items.
Don’t forget that wheat-free doesn’t mean gluten-free. If you see a package
labeled “wheat-free,” the contents may still contain barley, rye, oats, or deriv-
atives of those ingredients.
Remembering naturally gluten-free foods
Many people think the gluten-free lifestyle limits them to buying foods that say
“gluten-free” on the label. This is so not true! Limiting yourself to those foods
is ultrarestrictive, and it also means you’re overlooking lots of foods that are
inherently — or naturally — gluten-free, some of which are the most nutritious
of all. These are foods that contain no gluten, although the distributor doesn’t
necessarily market them as such. They include the obvious players — meat,
poultry, fish, seafood, fruits, vegetables, and nuts — but they also include
some products that seem like they may have gluten in them but don’t.
Many foods, including candies, chips, popcorn, deli foods, condiments, and
spices, are inherently gluten-free. Even some commercial cereals are gluten-
free but aren’t labeled as such. (What? A cereal without malt flavoring?!)
Asian foods — like rice wraps, many Thai foods, and most fish or oyster
sauces — are good examples of foods that are often inherently gluten-free
(remember, though, that soy sauce usually has wheat in it). Mexican and
other ethnic cuisines also offer a lot of naturally gluten-free foods.
The best foods are those without a label: meat, seafood, produce, and so on.
But many other foods are gluten-free and don’t say so on the label. Read the
list of ingredients, and if you don’t see anything blatantly off-limits, call the
manufacturer to confirm that the food is gluten-free. You’ll be surprised at
how often you find products that you can safely enjoy.
If you wear reading glasses, bring them to the store. You have to do lots of
label-reading, and you want to have your glasses handy so you can read all
the ingredients.
Asking for opinions
The last thing you want to do is spend gobs of money on specialty items and
expensive foods only to find that they taste more like cardboard than cake.
Because gluten-free foods can be pricey, and because some are great and
129
Chapter 8: Shopping Is Easier Than You Think

some are awful, asking around about gluten-free foods and getting opinions
from others who’ve tried them is more important than ever. Of course, opin-
ions vary, and what one person loves, another may hate, but opinions can be
valuable, especially if you hear several of them. (You know what they say
about opinions: They’re like stomachs — everyone has one.)
If you want to hear opinions on products, you have a lot of options. Try some
of these places:
 Support groups: If you attend support group meetings, ask the members
whether they’ve ever tried a particular product or whether they have
suggestions for, say, brownies. You can get lots of helpful ideas this way.
 Listserv: You can subscribe to e-mail lists (I go into detail about these in
Chapter 5). Posting questions and comments about glucose-free prod-
ucts is a valuable part of belonging to these lists.
 Online rating systems: Some of the online shopping Web sites offer cus-
tomer ratings. See how many stars a product has, and read the com-
ments to help you decide whether you want to buy it.
 Shoppers: If you see people at a store buying a product you haven’t
tried before, ask whether they’ve tried it and what they like or don’t like
about it. At the same time, if you’ve tried a product and see someone
looking at it, speak up. He or she will appreciate the input, I assure you.
 Store staff: Sometimes the store staff members are very knowledgeable
about products. Ask them if they’ve tried a particular product and what
they like or don’t like about it.
130
Part II: Planning and Preparing: The Preludes to Cooking 
Logging on to food blogs
You’ve probably heard of blogs, and maybe
you’ve even tossed in your two cents. A blog is
kind of like a real-time global conversation on
the Internet. Short for weblog, a blog is a Web
site where people can contribute opinions
about a particular subject. The newest com-
ments go on top, so you can have interactive
conversations.
In this case, food blogs are becoming popular,
and it’s just a matter of time before gluten-
free blogs are commonplace. Blogs can allow
consumers to get the word out about stores that
provide huge assortments of gluten-free prod-
ucts, specialty mixes that work and those that
don’t, restaurants that serve great gluten-free
meals, recipe suggestions, and the name of the
baker who takes the time to understand how to
make the perfect gluten-free bread. Exchanging
product information is all about the continuing
evolution of consumer power, and communica-
tion tools like blogs will most likely have a
tremendous influence on how people shop for
gluten-free products in the future.

When you find products that you and your family love and have confirmed to
be gluten-free, save the label or part of the packaging. Keep the labels in a
binder and create divided sections such as “soup,” “candy,” or whatever sec-
tions you like. Then bring the binder with you to the store so you can quickly
spot the items again and rest easy, knowing that you like the product and it
is, in fact, gluten-free.
Deciding Where to Shop
So you know what meals you want to make, you have at least some idea of
what foods you want to buy, and you may even have a list in hand. Where do
you get all this stuff (some of which you’ve never heard of before)? Well, for
most of your shopping needs, you can pick a store — any store — because
you’re not as limited as you may think.
“Regular” grocery stores
You can do most of your shopping at “regular” grocery stores. Yep — the kind
you find on every corner in most cities. If you’re surprised by this, don’t be.
Remember, I encourage you to eat mostly foods that are inherently gluten-
free, and you can find those at your friendly neighborhood grocery store.
Obviously, these stores are more convenient and less expensive than spe-
cialty stores. But from a psychological standpoint, you have a couple of
other, less-tangible reasons for shopping at a regular grocery store.
First, a gluten-free diet can seem restrictive and even daunting to some
people, and some even find it to be somewhat isolating (hopefully not when
they’re finished with this book). Being forced to shop only at specialty stores
or online confirms those feelings of isolation and despair. Being able to shop
at “regular” stores and buy “regular” brands that everyone else is buying is
really liberating for people who feel this way.
If you have kids on the gluten-free diet, considering the psychological impact
of shopping at regular grocery stores is even more important. Kids want to be
like all the other kids and eat brands (and junk foods) that all the other kids
eat. And that’s okay — feeling that way is perfectly normal. For most kids, fit-
ting in ranks right up there with breathing.
131
Chapter 8: Shopping Is Easier Than You Think

Regular brands aside, many major grocery stores are starting to carry more
gluten-free specialty items; some even have entire gluten-free sections. If you
have some favorite specialty products that you want your local store to
carry, don’t hesitate to ask the manager whether the store can carry them.
How often you get a positive response may surprise you, and the manager
may be surprised at how much interest customers have in the gluten-free
products.
You may also be pleased to know that many of the regular grocery chains
have lists of the gluten-free products they carry, both name brand and
generic. Some of the stores post the lists on their Web sites, and others offer
the lists if you call their customer service numbers.
Natural foods stores
Most natural foods stores are well aware of the growing interest in gluten-free
products, and they’re stocking up to meet the increasing demand. You find all
the meats and vegetables (usually organic) that are such a big part of the
gluten-free diet, but you also find lots of gluten-free specialty items. Some nat-
ural foods stores even have dedicated gluten-free sections.
Because natural foods stores have become so popular, they’ve expanded
their offerings and generally provide a huge array of exotic and gourmet
health foods, supplements, and even cosmetics and household goods.
Shopping at some of these places is more like being in a fun zone than a
food zone.
Farmers’ markets
Coming soon to a corner near you! Farmers’ markets are popping up every-
where (not just next to farms), offering fresh produce, eggs, meat, fish, honey,
nuts, and other (inherently gluten-free) items usually at prices far below
those of most retailers. The foods are ripe, organic is the rule rather than the
exception, and the generous samples that sellers pass out are enough to
count as lunch.
You can also feel good knowing you’re supporting local farmers and the envi-
ronment: The food is usually grown without pesticides, and not having to
ship the foods long distances uses less energy and gasoline.
132
Part II: Planning and Preparing: The Preludes to Cooking 

Ethnic markets
You want a thrill? Go to an Asian market — the more authentic, the better —
and check out all the stuff that’s gluten-free. Don’t forget the Thai and Indian
aisles. Truly, the selection is amazing. Sauces, rice wraps, tapioca noodles,
rice candies, things you’ve never heard of, and things that you may wonder
about for years — all gluten-free. Of course, they’re not labeled as such, but
that’s okay. If the label is in English, you can see for yourself that gluten isn’t
in many of the foods. Asians use very little wheat in their products.
Other ethnic cuisines may surprise and delight as well. Mexican is just one of
the many other cultures that use lots of inherently gluten-free ingredients in
their cooking. Explore new cultures without ever leaving your country and
experience a thrill of the gluten-free variety.
Low-carb stores
Don’t misunderstand me — low-carb does not mean gluten-free or even
gluten-light. In fact, sometimes low-carb versions of a food have more gluten
than their higher-carb counterparts. For a more-detailed explanation of why
low-carb doesn’t translate to gluten-free, check out Chapter 6 and see how
they compare.
Low-carb stores are still popular, and they do have some foods that are safe
on the gluten-free diet. You have to read the labels carefully.
Gluten-free retail stores
I’m not making this up. Once only a dream for those who have been gluten-
free for a long time, gluten-free stores are finally a reality. Entire stores filled
with gluten-free foods, books about being gluten-free, cookbooks, and other
important resources are beginning to pop up, and I’m delighted to say they’re
thriving. You’ll be seeing more and more of these, so keep your eyes open for
a store opening near you.
Web sites and catalogs
You can do all your gluten-free shopping from the comfort of your favorite
easy chair, any time day or night — you can even be in your wumfiest jam-
mies, if you want. There are some great Web sites that specialize in selling
133
Chapter 8: Shopping Is Easier Than You Think

gluten-free products, and within just a few minutes you can place your order.
A couple of days later your shipment arrives at your doorstep — and you
may be so excited to rip open that big box of gluten-free goodies, you feel like
a kid at the holidays!
All the gluten-free specialty food manufacturers have Web sites, so if you
know a specific brand you want to buy, you can go to the site and see what
they have to offer (you can find the sites with a quick Google search). But
here are a couple sites you can buy several different brands from:
 www.glutensolutions.com
 www.glutenfreemall.com
Some sites allow you to sort out other allergens, too, so you can narrow
down the products that are, for instance, gluten-free, casein-free, corn-free,
and soy-free. Some sites also provide customer rating systems. They give you
an average customer rating and specific comments about a product. This
type of a customer rating system is invaluable in helping you decide which
products to buy.
If you don’t have a computer, most companies offer a toll-free number, and
some will send you a free catalog so you can order by phone or fax.
Navigating the Aisles
You thought grocery shopping was just a matter of steering the cart up and
down the aisles, didn’t you? And I bet you thought you were in control of your
purchases, right? Actually, for decades now, grocery store psychologists have
been studying ways to get people to spend more, and they’ve come up with
subtle and subliminal ways to turn us all into Stepford Shoppers, falling
victim to strategically placed temptations scattered about the store like land
mines.
Copy a safe and forbidden ingredients list off the Internet (try the “Safe &
Forbidden Gluten-Free Foods & Ingredients” list at www.celiac.com) and
bring it with you to the store. You may need it when you’re reading ingredi-
ents on product labels.
Perusing the perimeter
One of the best ways to avoid some of those glaring gluten temptations at the
store is to shop the perimeter. Store layouts are predictable; produce, dairy,
meat, and other staples are as far from the front door of the store as possible
so that you have to walk past all the more expensive (and usually less nutri-
tious) foods before you get to what you really want.
134
Part II: Planning and Preparing: The Preludes to Cooking 

For the most part, the gluten-free items on your list are along the perimeter of
the store. If your store has a good health food aisle, you may be able to find
gluten-free pastas, mixes, cereals, bars, and other items. Your best bet in gen-
eral, though, is to stick to the fruits, vegetables, meats, and dairy items —
most of which are around the outsides. Just think of how much time you can
save by not having to go through the cracker, cookie, and bread aisles!
Sorting through the health food aisle
At first, the health food aisles may seem to be the best bet for finding gluten-
free foods. Not necessarily.
Health food aisles are full of product labels screaming “whole grain” or
“multigrain.” Lots of “healthy” foods are loaded with whole grains to provide
fiber and nutrients, and although the gluten-free diet sometimes allows whole
grains like brown rice, millet, or quinoa, for instance, most of the whole
grains in those products contain gluten.
Health food sections do offer some benefits. The longer a food’s ingredients
list is, the less likely it is to be gluten-free, and health food aisles are good
places to find items that have short ingredients lists. Read them carefully!
I’m excited to see that the major grocery stores are starting to carry a larger
variety of gluten-free specialty products in their health food aisles. If your
favorite grocery store carries gluten-free products, tell the manager how

Planning impulsive purchases
High-powered grocery store psychologists
have spent billions of retail-funded dollars on
studies that finally concluded with a shocking
revelation: Shoppers are impulsive. So the
stores capitalize on your impulsivity by planning
your impulsive purchases. “Planned impulsiv-
ity” may at first seem to be an oxymoron, but it’s
exactly what stores are creating when they
strategize everything from where to place items
to what music they play in the background.
Don’t tell me you haven’t fallen for the market-
ing. You’re at the store for just a few items (“I’ll
just use a hand basket”), and you walk out with
a cartload of things you didn’t even know you
wanted. You’re captivated by flashing coupon
dispensers, in-aisle displays, free samples, 
and heavily loaded end caps at the end of each
aisle — all of which are there because the psy-
chologists have done their homework. And don’t
forget the fact that your kids are the primary tar-
gets, as they tend to be quite influential when
you make your impulsive purchases.
Rarely are these so-called impulse purchases
directing you toward healthy foods, much less
gluten-free ones. If you’re having a hard time
sticking to the diet, or if you find being tempted
by the gluttonous gluten products out there to
be daunting, be aware of the efforts to snare
you at the stores, and have your guard up
against impulsive gluten-containing purchases.

much you appreciate it and even make suggestions for products the store
could carry that it doesn’t. Chances are, store managers are “testing” the
gluten-free products, and your feedback may be valuable in making sure the
stores continue to carry them.
Living Gluten-Free — Affordably
One of the most common complaints I hear about the gluten-free diet is that
it’s more expensive — but it doesn’t need to be. Yes, I understand that a loaf
of regular bread is less than half the cost of a loaf of gluten-free bread. And
the fact that gluten-free crackers and cookies are often smaller and twice the
price of regular cookies isn’t lost on me, either. And yes, I’ve paid more than
my fair share in shipping expenses, too. But you have ways to save significant
amounts of money when you’re enjoying a gluten-free lifestyle. So before you
take a second mortgage on your house to finance this diet, take note of these
tips that can save you a bunch.
Scaling back on specialties
Most of the “extra expense” of the gluten-free diet is in the high cost of spe-
cialty items. I’m not suggesting you celebrate little Preston’s birthday with
store-bought rice crackers to save the expense of making a gluten-free cake.
You need to have some specialty items on hand, and cakes or special-
occasion treats are definitely among them.
But if you find you’re spending way too much money to accommodate this
diet, take a look at how many and what types of specialty items you buy.
Breads, crackers, cookies, cakes, pizzas, pretzels, donuts — they’re pricey,
for sure. But you don’t need them. You can substitute store-bought chips for
a fraction of the cost of gluten-free pretzels. Even as high-priced as they are,
candies and candy bars that you can get at any grocery store are far cheaper
than specialty treats.
And really, most of the specialty items aren’t good for you, anyway — they’re
high-calorie, high-glycemic-index foods (they raise your blood sugar quickly)
that provide very little nutritional value. If you follow the more nutritious
approach to gluten-free eating that I outline in Chapter 6, you find very little
room for these expensive indulgences.
Some of the specialty items people buy are unnecessary. Gluten-free vanilla is
a good example: All vanilla is gluten-free! You don’t need to buy it as a spe-
cialty item.
136
Part II: Planning and Preparing: The Preludes to Cooking 

Some specialty items may be important to have on hand. Pasta, some special-
occasion treats, and maybe some bread or bagels, for instance. But in gen-
eral, most people buy more specialty items than they need, and it definitely
puts a burden on the budget.
Saving on shipping
If you do buy specialty items, you can find ways to save on shipping. For one,
you can ask your local grocery or natural foods store to carry the product
you want — that way the store pays for the shipping, not you.
If you’re ordering online, order from a company that sells many different
brands of products. That way, you pay one shipping charge for several differ-
ent brands. Buying products onesey-twosey from individual manufacturers
costs you a fortune in shipping.
Going generic
Don’t assume that generics are off-limits on this diet. Most of the time, generic
products are as clearly labeled as major brands, and sometimes a toll-free
number is listed on the package so you can call to confirm whether the item is
gluten-free. Usually generics are labeled as being “distributed by” a large gro-
cery chain or distribution company. Dig a little — call toll-free information or
go on the Internet to get a phone number for the large grocery chain or 
137
Chapter 8: Shopping Is Easier Than You Think
Tax deductions for the gluten-free
Believe it or not, there’s a tax-deduction avail-
able when you buy gluten-free food, but not
everyone can take advantage of the deduction.
You can deduct the difference in price between
gluten-free products and “regular” food prod-
ucts. Here’s an example using a loaf of bread:
Gluten-free bread:
$5.00
“Regular” bread:
$2.00
Difference in price:
$3.00
You can deduct the $3.00 difference. The cost of
items you wouldn’t normally need to buy, like
xanthan gum, are completely deductible.
Shipping costs are deductible, too. But to qual-
ify, your unreimbursed medical expenses must
exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross
income. That’s a pretty tall order for most
people. You also need a letter from your doctor
saying that a gluten-free diet is medically nec-
essary for you. All these expenses are reim-
bursable under a health care spending account
of pretax income. Consult a tax advisor for more
information.

distribution company. Most of the time, you can find a customer service repre-
sentative there who can help you find out more about the ingredients.
If the generics are a store brand, chances are good that you’ll be able to get
lots of information about the products. Some of the large grocery chains have
lists of their gluten-free generics, and sometimes those lists are even avail-
able online. If you want more information about a store’s generic products,
call its toll-free number and ask to talk with the head of quality control or the
nutrition department. I did this once and was pleased to hear from the lead
nutritionist that the modified food starch in all of their generic products was
derived from corn. That little bit of information was immensely helpful in
realizing that even more generics than I’d known were gluten-free.
Eating nutritiously
Some people think that eating nutritious foods is more expensive. Not true.
Fresh produce and meats do seem expensive — they are! But chips and other
processed, blood-sugar-raising foods — which not only are worthless nutri-
tionally speaking but also cause weight gain and make you hungrier — are a
complete waste of money.
138
Part II: Planning and Preparing: The Preludes to Cooking 
Developing good shopping habits
In addition to what I cover in this chapter, you
can do lots of things that save you time and
money when you shop. Here’s a list to get you
started:
 Don’t shop when you’re hungry. If you shop
on an empty stomach, you’re more vulner-
able to falling victim to impulse purchases.
 Bring a list. Planning before you head for
the grocery store keeps you focused on the
healthy and gluten-free foods you need and
makes you less likely to impulsively buy
things you don’t.
 Stock up when you can. Buying food in
larger quantities is almost always cheaper if
you can afford to do so and if you have
somewhere to store the food. Remember
that gluten-free foods often have a short
shelf life, so if you’re going to stock up on
pre-made products, make sure you have
room in your freezer.
 Consider co-ops. Co-ops aren’t in all parts
of the country, but if you have one nearby,
they’re a great way to save money. The idea
is that a group of people form a cooperative,
buy food in bulk, and then offer the food to
others to buy. Usually anyone can become
a member for a small charge (nonmembers
can buy, too, but usually for a surcharge).
The focus is nearly always on healthy foods.
 Join membership clubs. Membership clubs
are usually the big warehouse-type stores.
One of the world’s largest has recently
begun carrying a large selection of gluten-
free products. These stores are especially
good if you want to buy in bulk, because
most of their products are supersized.

Buy nutritious foods, but buy only what you need. Most nutritious foods are
also perishable, and if you don’t use them within a few days, “fresh” produce
isn’t so fresh anymore.
Eating in
Eating out at restaurants or fast-food places eats through a budget in no time.
Eating at home not only ensures that your meal is, in fact, gluten-free, but it
also saves you money.
139
Chapter 8: Shopping Is Easier Than You Think
 Use coupons, flyers, rebates, and frequent-
shopper programs. Using coupons isn’t just
a fun way to annoy the people behind you.
You can save hundreds of dollars a year by
taking advantage of product incentives.
Even if you’re a less-than-enthusiastic
coupon clipper, try to find a few to use each
week, and don’t forget to check the circu-
lars that are at the front of the stores. They
always list weekly specials, and they’re
usually for the meats and produce, which
are gluten-free. If the store is out of an
advertised special, ask for a rain check. You
can get the sale price when the store has
more of the product in stock.
 Dare to compare. Always look at the unit
price of a product, not just the package
price. Stores list unit prices on the price
tags on the grocery shelves. The package
price tells you only the cost of the entire
item, whereas the unit price shows the cost
per pound, ounce, and so on. This way,
when you compare the price of one item to
another, you’re comparing apples-to-
apples.
If you don’t have one already on your pocket
protector, you may want to consider bring-
ing a small (or large, if you’re more 
the analytical type) calculator with you.
Most stores offer cost-per-unit prices, but
sometimes they mix up the units, so one
item — take juice, for instance — will be in
cost per ounce, while its competitor is in
cost per box. If you have your handy-dandy
calculator with you, you can make an accu-
rate comparison and choose the best value.
 Keep your eye on the scanner. So you may
have to forego the magazine that tells which
celeb is giving birth to alien twins or how to
lose all the weight you want in 23 seconds,
but watching to make sure the price the
scanner rings up is what you thought it
would be is important. Stores do make mis-
takes. And a lot of times, believe it or not,
those mistakes are not in your favor.
 If possible, don’t shop with your kids. Yeah,
they’re adorable, but they’re enemy number
one when you’re trying to resist the impul-
sive shopping that grocery stores are
counting on. Kids are their primary targets.
Notice where the sugary cereals are
located — right at eye-level for an irre-
sistible 5-year-old. Grocery stores are
counting on your kids to lure you into impul-
sive purchases of high-profit-margin treats
like cereals and snack foods.
 Buy generics. Lots of generic products are
gluten-free. Some stores have lists of their
gluten-free generics available at the cus-
tomer service desk or on the Internet.

Sure, planning and preparing home-cooked meals takes time (I give some
time-saving tips in Chapter 9), but the money you save and the peace of mind
knowing your meals are nutritious and gluten-free are well worth it.
Using gluten-free mixes
The gluten-free mixes for baked goods like brownies, cakes, cookies, and
breads may seem expensive, and they are. But compare them to the cost of
buying several different types of specialty flours, xanthan gum (a must-have
in gluten-free baking recipes), and other ingredients you need to make those
homemade baked goods — then add on the cost of the failed attempts (you
will have some failures), and suddenly the surefire-taste-delicious-and-always-
turn-out-right mixes seem like a bargain.

Cooking: Tips and Techniques
In This Chapter
 Finding out how to make anything gluten-free
 Exploring gluten-free grains
 Entering the wonderful world of gluten-free baking
I
have some unique cooking tips and techniques that can help in your
gluten-free cooking adventures, and I cover them in this chapter. Those of
you who know me or have watched me cook are smirking right now, because
the truth of the matter is that I have a — ahem — different style of cooking,
and you’re probably wondering what I’m doing giving cooking tips. I don’t
want to point fingers, but my editors made me do it! Somehow, they didn’t
think “open bag of mix, approximate measurements, and improvise” would sit
well with those of you who want to do real cooking.
Basically, I follow a few simple rules of cooking:
 Measuring is for patient people. I don’t qualify.
 If a recipe calls for 1⁄4 teaspoon of something, why bother?
 If a recipe calls for more than 12 ingredients, and if I have to go to a 
foreign country to purchase any of them, I don’t bother.
 What’s a sifter for?
 If you bake it in your oven, it is homemade. Therefore, by definition,
using mixes qualifies as homemade cooking.
Don’t get me wrong. I do cook — a lot. In fact, I love to cook. But I do it my
way, and my measuring terms consist of dollop, gob, and itsy bit, and I use
them interchangeably.
If you like the more technical approach, that’s okay. The tips and techniques
in this chapter apply to you whether you’re my kind of cook or of the more
scrupulous variety.

Creatively Gluten-Free: Improvising 
in the Kitchen
I believe that if you give a person a recipe, you feed him for a meal; teach him
to make recipes gluten-free, and you feed him for a lifetime.
I have an enormous amount of respect and admiration for the Real Cookbook
Authors out there, especially after writing the recipe section of this book.
So if you love recipes, you may be delighted to know that this book includes
65 recipes and that there are dozens of excellent gluten-free cookbooks by
Real Cookbook Authors.
But I also think finding out how to improvise and cook anything gluten-free
has a lot of value. Sometimes that means taking a recipe for something that
normally has gluten in it and modifying it to be gluten-free. Other times, that
means throwing caution to the wind and doing without a recipe altogether.
No single ingredient is more important in gluten-free cooking than creativity.
You may not always have ingredients on hand to make the gluten-free dish
you want to make. You may not have a recipe handy for a meal you have in
mind. You may think you have no way to convert your old favorite standby
into a gluten-free goodie. Don’t let any of those things stop you. Cooking
gluten-free is actually easy if you improvise, explore alternatives, and stretch
the boundaries of your creativity in the kitchen.
Adapting any dish to be gluten-free
Pop quiz: You’re standing in line at the grocery store, mindlessly perusing the
magazines offering valuable, up-to-date, star-struck gossip and surefire ways
to lose all your belly fat in less than ten minutes, when the cover of your
favorite cooking magazine catches your eye. It’s a beautiful photo of (insert
favorite food here), glistening with — agh! — Gluten! You:
A) Leave the store in tears, feeling sorry for yourself as you pathetically
choke down a rice cake.
B) Buy the magazine as a reminder of a past life of gluten-gluttony.
C) Delight in knowing that because you or someone you love bought you
this copy of Living Gluten-Free For Dummies, you can easily and confi-
dently modify that recipe to be deliciously gluten-free.
The right answer is, of course, C. You can modify nearly any dish to be gluten-
free. Some dishes are easier than others — baked goods are the toughest, so I
deal with those last. You can go one of two ways when you’re adapting a dish
to be gluten-free: with a recipe or without.
142
Part II: Planning and Preparing: The Preludes to Cooking 

Starting with a recipe
If you’re following a recipe for something that’s not gluten-free and you want
to convert it, start by reviewing the list of ingredients the recipe calls for.
Make a note of those that usually have gluten in them. Then, using the substi-
tutions I suggest in this chapter or some of your own, substitute gluten-free
ingredients as you need to.
For the most part, when you make substitutions, measurements convert
equally — with the exception of flours, which I discuss in the section
“Substituting gluten-free flours.”
Don’t have the right substitutions? Improvise. For instance, if a recipe calls for
dredging something in flour before sautéing and you don’t have any gluten-
free flours, maybe you have a gluten-free mix that would work. Pancake mix,
even muffin mix, can work quite well as a substitute for a flour coating.
Cooking without a recipe
If you’re not using a recipe, creativity once again prevails. Say you want to
make chicken nuggets. You certainly don’t need a recipe for that; just slice
some chicken and figure out what you want to coat it in before frying or
baking. Put some of your favorite gluten-free barbecue potato chips in a plas-
tic bag, and crunch them up. Now you have a coating!
At the risk of belaboring a point, you have to be creative. The substitution
ideas in this chapter are just that — ideas. Coming up with substitutions that
work for your convenience, preference, and budget is up to you.
Avoiding cross-contamination 
when cooking
After you’ve worked hard to create a delicious, gluten-free meal, you wouldn’t
go dust a bunch of wheat flour all over it, would you? Of course not. Yet some-
times the way you cook food can contaminate it as though you had done just
that, and you may not be aware that your food is being contaminated.
Cooking gluten-containing foods at the same time as gluten-free ones is okay,
but just be aware that cross-contamination during the cooking process is a
very real consideration, and be careful not to glutenate (contaminate with
gluten) your food inadvertently. Here are some things to watch out for:
 Cooking utensils: You can’t flip a gluten-containing hamburger bun with
a spatula and then flip a burger. Well, you can, but that burger is no
longer gluten-free. Same thing goes for tossing the pasta and stirring the
sauce. Use separate utensils while you’re cooking, and keep track of
which one is which.
143
Chapter 9: Cooking: Tips and Techniques

 Double-duty cooking surfaces: If you’re cooking gluten-containing and
gluten-free foods on the same griddle, grills, or cookie sheets or in the
same pans, you should cook the gluten-free version first. If that just
doesn’t work, you can use the same cooking surface for both versions,
but be sure to find a clean spot for your gluten-free foods.
 Frying oil: When you fry breaded products in oil, bits of the breading or
batter stay in the oil when you’re finished frying. So if you fry gluten-
containing foods in oil, don’t use that same oil to fry your gluten-free
foods. Either fry the gluten-free foods first or use completely separate
pans and fresh oil for the gluten-free foods.
If you’re cooking both glutenous and gluten-free foods in your fryer, you’ll
need to be extra diligent when you’re cleaning it to make sure you get all the
gluten out. If your fryer isn’t easy to clean thoroughly, you may want to con-
sider having separate fryers.
Using standby substitutions
To convert a recipe that usually contains gluten into one that’s gluten-free,
you need to make some simple substitutions. For the most part, with the
exception of flours you use when making baked goods, the substitutions are
simple — just swap one for the other. I cover flours for baked goods sepa-
rately, later in this chapter.
 Beer: Some foods, especially deep-fried foods, may call for beer in the
recipe. You can use either the gluten-free beers available online or try
cider instead.
 Binders: A binder is just something that holds foodstuff together.
Because gluten provides elasticity and stretch to baked goods, adding
binders to foods that don’t have gluten-containing flours in them is a
good idea. Binders include xanthan gum, guar gum, gelatin powder 
(this is cool, too, because it adds protein and moisture), and eggs.
 Breadcrumbs: No-brainer here. Anyone who’s ever eaten a piece of
gluten-free bread (especially without toasting it) knows that bread-
crumbs aren’t hard to come by. You can buy gluten-free breadcrumbs
from specialty stores or online, but if you can’t or don’t want to get
those, consider using any gluten-free bread: Put the bread in a plastic
bag and smoosh it into the size of crumbs you want. You can even toast
the crumbs if you want added crunch or need dry breadcrumbs instead
of fresh ones. Crushed cereals work well in place of breadcrumbs, too.
Also consider using mashed potato flakes or quinoa flakes.
144
Part II: Planning and Preparing: The Preludes to Cooking 

 Bun: Consider using a lettuce wrap, corn tortilla, or of course, gluten-
free bread. Some good gluten-free buns are available online and at spe-
cialty shops.
 Coatings: If a recipe calls for some type of coating, you have several
options. You can despair and not make the dish (Ha! Kidding!) or con-
sider using any of the gluten-free flours I list later in this chapter, as well
as any versatile gluten-free mix you have lying around, such as a mix for
bread, muffins, or pancakes. Cornmeal or corn flour (masa) with season-
ings mixed in adds an interesting texture, and crushed barbecue potato
chips (gluten-free, of course) are one of my personal all-time favorites.
You may also want to look into commercial brands of Cajun-style coat-
ings, usually marketed as seafood seasonings (but shhhhhh . . . don’t tell
anyone . . . I use them on chicken!). Many of those are just cornmeal with
some spices added.
 “Cream of” soups: Use chicken broth and sour cream or half-and-half.
Remember to add the food the soup is a cream of — mushroom, celery,
potato, and so on — to complete the soup.
 Croutons: Homemade croutons are actually very easy to make. Most
recipes for croutons suggest you use stale bread, but I don’t suggest you
do that for gluten-free bread, because you’d probably end up with crum-
bled crouton crumbs instead. Cut fresh gluten-free bread into the size
cubes you want and deep-fry them. After you drain and cool them, roll
them in Parmesan cheese, spices, or any other flavoring you like. See
Chapter 12 for a lower-fat version and other crouton substitutions.
 Fillers: Filler is a highly technical culinary term for something that fills
stuff in. Yum. Generally not something you hope to see on a label, fillers
aren’t always a bad thing; they may be in meatloaf, for example, where
the recipe often calls for breadcrumbs, crackers, and other filler-type
materials to add, well, filling. Gluten-free bread or breadcrumbs are obvi-
ous substitutions here, but also consider leftover corn bread, mashed
potato flakes, or even an unsweetened cereal that you’ve crushed up.
 Flour: Many recipes call for flour, usually to serve as a thickener (see the
suggested thickeners in this list). Also consider using gluten-free flours
such as rice flour, sweet rice flour (they’re different), potato starch,
sorghum flour, garbanzo/fava bean flour, and Montina (Indian ricegrass
flour).
 Flour tortillas: The obvious substitution here is corn tortillas. Some new
gluten-free flour tortillas are on the market now, and you can find recipes
for homemade tortillas online or in cookbooks. Other wrap substitutions
include rice wraps (found in Asian markets and featured in a few recipes
in this book) or lettuce.
 Pie crust: One of the easiest ways to make a pie crust is to take your
favorite cereal and smash it into tiny crumbs, add some butter (and
sugar, if the cereal isn’t sweet enough), and then press the mixture into
145
Chapter 9: Cooking: Tips and Techniques

the bottom of a pie pan. Some good gluten-free crackers and cookies
work well the same way. Some pie crusts are supposed to be cooked
before adding the pie filling, and others aren’t. The fact that the crust is
gluten-free doesn’t change whether you need to cook the crust before
filling the pie. Also check out some of the gluten-free pie crust mixes
available on the Internet and at specialty stores.
 “Special” sauce: I’ve got news for ya, Jack. The secret’s out: You can
make their “special” sauce with just mayo and ketchup, both of which
are gluten-free!
 Soy sauce: Most soy sauce has wheat in it (and the label clearly indi-
cates wheat), but you can find brands that are wheat-free. (By the way,
tamari — a thicker, Japanese soy sauce — is not always wheat-free, so
check the label.) Either use a wheat-free soy sauce or try Bragg Liquid
Aminos. You may also want to get adventurous and try an Asian sauce
like fish sauce (careful — it’s really fishy!) or oyster sauce.
 Teriyaki: Because most soy sauce has wheat in it, most teriyaki (which
is made from soy sauce) does, too. A few brands of wheat-free teriyaki
sauces are available, but don’t be afraid to make your own (see my
recipe in the “Making teriyaki sauce” sidebar).
 Thickeners: Many recipes call for flour as a thickener, but lots of alterna-
tives are available. For sweet things, try using a dry pudding mix or
gelatin. ClearJel works well with acidic ingredients (unlike cornstarch),
tolerates high temperatures, and doesn’t cause pie fillings to “weep”
during storage. Arrowroot flour, agar, tapioca starch, and cornstarch are
also excellent thickeners. So is sweet rice flour, which comes from sticky
or glutinous rice (despite the name, it really is gluten-free). And remem-
ber that muffin or cake mix you have lying around. Not only do mixes
thicken the recipe, but the sweet flavor is a pleasant surprise. You can
find more information on using gluten-free thickeners in the section
“Thickening with gluten-free starches and flours.”

Part II: Planning and Preparing: The Preludes to Cooking 
Making teriyaki sauce
Actually, the term teriyaki refers to a method of
cooking, derived from the Japanese words teri,
meaning luster, and yaki, meaning grill or broil
(cleverly combined to form the word teriyaki).
Traditional teriyaki dishes are marinated in the
sauce and then grilled or broiled, creating a
shiny (teri) glaze. Although you can substitute
for it, the key ingredient in teriyaki sauce is
mirin, a sweet Japanese rice wine for cooking.

1⁄2 cup soy sauce

1⁄2 cup mirin (Note: If you don’t have mirin,
use 1⁄2 cup of sake and 1 tablespoon of
sugar.)
 3 tablespoons sugar
In a small saucepan, mix together the soy sauce,
mirin, and sugar. Heat on low heat for about 3
minutes and then let the sauce cool. You can
store teriyaki sauce in a clean bottle in the fridge.

Cooking with Wheat Alternatives
Most gluten-free cooking is pretty straightforward. You just substitute gluten-
free ingredients for the gluten-containing ones, and for the most part, you’re
set. The process is a little different for baked goods, as I explain later in this
chapter. But most gluten-free cooking isn’t much different from “regular”
cooking, especially if you follow the theme of this chapter and let your cre-
ative side take over.
Incorporating alternative 
gluten-free grains
Not only are the gluten-free grains and grain alternatives that I talk about in
Chapter 4 ultranutritious, but they add unique flavors and textures to foods,
too. For the most part, cooking them is just like cooking other grains, as you
can see in Part III of this book and in cookbooks. But you need to know a few
things to perfect the art of using alternative gluten-free grains.
When cooking gluten-free grains as whole grains (as opposed to using them
as a flour in baked goods), you find these alternative grains cook like most
whole grains — just toss them in boiling water, reduce the heat so the water
simmers, and you’re set. The grain-to-water proportion and cooking times are
really the only things that vary. Table 8-1 has some approximations of
amounts of liquids and cooking time; you can modify them to suit your
preferences.

Chapter 9: Cooking: Tips and Techniques

Quinoa, millet, teff, amaranth, buckwheat, and the other alternative grains
are great additions to soups, stuffing, and other foods. Here are some places
you can use alternative grains, whether you precook them or simply toss
them in with the other ingredients:
 Snacks: Using a little oil in a pan, you can pop amaranth grains on the
stove like popcorn and eat them seasoned or plain.
 Soups: Use buckwheat, quinoa, or millet in soups instead of rice or noo-
dles. No need to cook the grains first; just add them to the soup as
you’re cooking it. Remember, they absorb the liquid and double in
volume. Whole amaranth and teff are too small, and they may seem
gritty in soups, although both work well to thicken soups if you use the
flour form of them.
 Stuffing: Use the larger alternative grains such as cooked quinoa, millet,
or buckwheat instead of breadcrumbs or croutons in stuffing. Season
the stuffing to your taste and then stuff vegetables, poultry, or pork 
tenderloins.
Thickening with gluten-free
starches and flours
People usually use starch-based thickeners such as cornstarch, arrowroot,
and tapioca to thicken their sauces and gravies. Starch thickeners give food a
transparent, glistening sheen, which looks great for pie fillings and in glazes,
but the thickeners don’t always look quite right in gravy or sauce, so knowing
which ones to use is important.
To thicken with gluten-free starches, mix the starch with an equal amount of
cold liquid until it forms a paste. Then whisk the paste into the liquid you’re
trying to thicken. After you add the thickener to the liquid, cook it for at least
30 seconds or so to get rid of the starchy flavor. But be careful you don’t
overcook it — liquids that you thicken with these starches may get thin again
if you cook them too long or at too high of a temperature.
Some of these flours have the advantage of working well with foods that are
acidic. Acidic foods include canned or glazed fruits, citrus, tomatoes, and
vinegar. Bananas, figs, avocados, and potatoes are examples of foods that
aren’t acidic (they’re alkaline).
Take a look at your options for thickeners:
 Arrowroot: If you’re looking for that shiny gloss for dessert sauces or
glazes, arrowroot is a good bet. Use arrowroot if you’re thickening an
acidic liquid but not if you’re using dairy products (it makes them
slimy). Arrowroot has the most neutral taste of all the starch thickeners,
148
Part II: Planning and Preparing: The Preludes to Cooking 

so if you’re worried that a thickener may change or mask the flavor of
your dish, use arrowroot. You can freeze the sauces you make with
arrowroot.
 ClearJel: This modified cornstarch works especially well for fruit pie fill-
ings because it blends well with acidic ingredients, tolerates high tem-
peratures, and doesn’t cause pie fillings to “weep” during storage. It also
doesn’t begin thickening until the liquid begins to cool, which allows the
heat to be more evenly distributed within the jar if you’re canning.
 Cornstarch: Cornstarch is the best choice for thickening dairy-based
sauces, but don’t use it for acidic foods. Cornstarch isn’t as shiny as
tapioca or arrowroot. Don’t use cornstarch if you’re freezing the sauce,
or the sauce will get spongy.
 Potato starch: Usually used to thicken soups and gravies, potato starch
doesn’t work well in liquids that you boil. Unlike cornstarch and some
other grain-based foods, potato starch is a permitted ingredient for
Passover.
Potato flour and potato starch flour are different. Potato flour is very
heavy and tastes very much like potatoes. Potato starch flour is very
fine, with a bland taste. It’s great to mix with other flours for baking or to
use as a thickener for soups or gravies.
 Tapioca: You can use pearl tapioca or tapioca granules to thicken pud-
dings and pies, but they don’t completely dissolve when you cook them,
so you end up with tiny gelatinous balls. If you like the balls, you can
also use instant tapioca to thicken soups, gravies, and stews. If you don’t
like them, you can get tapioca starch, which is already finely ground.
Tapioca gives a glossy sheen and can tolerate prolonged cooking and
freezing.
You can use any of the alternative grains to thicken sauces, gravies, stews,
puddings — anything! Depending on what you’re making, you can use whole
grains or flours as a thickener. You probably want to use a flour instead of
whole grain to thicken something like gravy, but whole grains add lots of
nutrition and work well to thicken soups and stews.
When you’re using these flours or starches as thickeners, substitution
amounts are a little different. Instead of 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour, use
 Agar: 1⁄2 tablespoon
 Arrowroot: 2 teaspoons
 Cornstarch: 1⁄2 tablespoon
 Gelatin powder: 1⁄2 tablespoon
 Rice flour (brown or white): 1 tablespoon
 Sweet potato flour: 1 tablespoon

Chapter 9: Cooking: Tips and Techniques

Trying Your Hand at Gluten-Free Baking
I won’t sugarcoat the situation: Baking is the trickiest type of gluten-free cook-
ing you can try. But it’s getting easier. Years ago, gluten-free baking produced
brick-like breads and cakes that crumbled when you exposed them to air.
Gluten is what makes baked goods stretchy, elastic, and doughy. It also forms
a support structure to hold the gases that expand and to help the bread rise
and become fluffy. Without gluten, baked foods tend to either crumble exces-
sively or be dense enough to double as a lethal weapon. Using xanthan gum
and combining gluten-free flours are the keys to creating gluten-free baked
goods that are just as good as the real deal.
Mixing it up with mixes
Swallowing your pride is a lot better than swallowing a dry wad doing its best
to impersonate a cookie, don’t you think? Sure, cooking from scratch is ter-
rific, and these days, especially with the help of the Real Cookbook Authors,
the success rate is high (certainly higher than it was when I started on my
self-taught-gluten-free-baking-from-scratch adventures in the early 1990s).
But consider using some of the incredible gluten-free mixes now available for
pancakes, cookies, cakes, breads, brownies, biscuits, pizza crust, pie crust,
muffins, and just about anything else you can think of. Many of the mixes are
so good these days that they rival even the best homemade gluten-containing
foods. They’re simple to make (have the kids help!) and fill the house with
that June-Cleaver-lives-here smell of freshly baked treats.
Most of the mixes simply require an egg or egg substitute, water or milk, and
oil. Many of the companies are aware of multiple food intolerances and offer
casein-free, corn-free, soy-free, and other allergen-free products. You can keep
it simple or jazz it up, adding your favorite ingredients and accommodating
other allergies and intolerances. See Chapter 7 for a list of what kind of mixes
you may want to have on hand.
The most common complaint I hear about mixes is that they’re expensive —
and they are. But when you consider that they’re pretty much fail-proof, and
when you add up the cost of some of the specialty gluten-free baking ingredi-
ents, like special flours and xanthan gum — and then you add on top of that
the fact that sometimes when you bake gluten-free foods from scratch, you
have some failures that you end up feeding to the dog — you realize that at
$6.50 per cookie that didn’t turn out, the dog food is expensive; the mix is a
good deal.
150
Part II: Planning and Preparing: The Preludes to Cooking 

Introducing xanthan gum: 
The star of the dough
Boasting unique properties that enhance the consistency of foods, xanthan
gum is a key ingredient in successful gluten-free baking. Basically, it holds
particles of foods together, and it’s the component in salad dressings,
gravies, sauces, and ice creams that gives those foods a creamy, rich, smooth
texture. Xanthan gum has proven to work well in gluten-free foods, providing
the stretch and elasticity that gluten usually offers.
Here’s a guide for how much xanthan gum to use for each cup of gluten-free
flour:
 Breads: 1 heaping teaspoon
 Cakes: 1⁄2 teaspoon
 Cookies: 1⁄4 teaspoon
 Muffins: 3⁄4 teaspoons
 Pizza: 2 teaspoons
I warn you, xanthan gum is pricey. Some people use guar gum instead, usually
because it’s cheaper. But be aware that guar gum is high in fiber content and
can have a laxative effect.
When you’re making gluten-free dough, use nonstick loaf pans, baking sheets,
and pie pans; or be prepared to use lots of parchment paper, wax paper, or
aluminum foil. Gluten-free dough is especially sticky.
Substituting gluten-free flours
Several gluten-free flours work well for baking. But they don’t always work
in a one-to-one trade. In other words, you can’t just replace one cup of all-
purpose or wheat flour with one cup of potato starch — at least not for the
best results.
You should play around with these substitutions to find the flavors and con-
sistencies you like best, but this list gives you a starting point for how you
can use gluten-free flours.
151
Chapter 9: Cooking: Tips and Techniques

Remember, each substitution is instead of 1 cup of all-purpose flour (for
those of you who aren’t familiar with the highly technical culinary term scant,
it simply means loosely packed or barely):
 Amaranth flour: 1 scant cup
 Arrowroot flour: 1 scant cup
 Buckwheat flour: 7⁄8 cup
 Corn flour: 1 cup
 Cornmeal: 3⁄4 cup
 Cornstarch: 3⁄4 cup
 Garbanzo bean (chickpea) flour: 3⁄4 cup
 Garbanzo/fava bean blend: 1 scant cup
 Mesquite flour: 1 cup
 Millet flour: 1 cup
 Montina (Indian ricegrass flour): 1 cup
 Potato flour: 1⁄2 cup
 Potato starch: 3⁄4 cup
 Quinoa flour: 1 cup
 Rice flour (white or brown): 1 scant cup
 Sorghum: 1 scant cup
 Soy flour: 3⁄4 cup
 Sweet potato flour: 1 cup
 Sweet rice flour (glutinous or sticky rice flour; mochiko): 7⁄8 cup
 Tapioca flour or starch: 1 cup
 Teff flour: 7⁄8 cup
Making your own gluten-free 
flour mixtures
One of the things the Real Cookbook Authors discovered in the not-so-distant
past is that if you mix a variety of flours together, they produce baked goods
that have a better consistency and taste. Different combinations of gluten-
free flour mixtures abound, and you can experiment to find your favorite.
152
Part II: Planning and Preparing: The Preludes to Cooking 

If you’re going to be doing a lot of baking, I suggest making up a large quan-
tity of gluten-free flour mixture and storing it in a dark, dry place. That way
you have it on hand when you want to bake. You can also buy many of these
gluten-free flour mixtures pre-made.
A quick perusal of most gluten-free cookbooks or a visit to gluten-free recipe
sites on the Internet can give you dozens of variations on these flour mix-
tures, but here are three of the most popular basic mixes. They can be used
as a one-to-one substitution for all-purpose flour.
Bette Hagman’s All-Purpose Gluten-Free Flour Mixture
 2 parts white rice flour
 1⁄3 part potato starch flour
 1⁄3 part tapioca flour
You can use several other types of gluten-free flour mixtures, each with
unique tastes and cooking properties. One of the more popular flour mixtures
today has bean flour, which adds protein and texture. Here’s a bean flour 
mixture:
Gluten-Free Bean Flour Mixture
 1 part bean flour
 1 part brown rice flour (or 1 part white rice flour)
 1 part cornstarch
 1 part tapioca starch
 3⁄4 parts sweet rice flour
Carol Fenster has also developed a gluten-free flour mixture using sorghum
and corn flour (she suggests using a small coffee or spice grinder to make the
corn flour out of white cornmeal).
Carol Fenster’s Corn Flour Blend
 11⁄2 cups sorghum flour
 11⁄2 cups potato starch or cornstarch
 1 cup tapioca flour
 1⁄2 cup corn flour

Baking bread the gluten-free way
Those who have attempted the sometimes taste-defying feat of experimenting
with gluten-free breads know that at times the word bread is a euphemism
for brick and the word edible is an overstatement. But never fear; help is
here — whether you’re a die-hard baker or a newbie in the kitchen, freshly
baked, great-tasting, smell-the-kitchen-up, gluten-free bread is easier than
ever to make.
Although some gluten-free breads do taste great these days, they still taste a
little different from wheat-based breads. And why does that surprise people?
That’s like making an apple pie but using cherries instead of apples and being
surprised that it doesn’t have an apple flavor. Of course gluten-free bread
doesn’t taste exactly like wheat bread — it doesn’t have wheat in it!
Gluten-free breads tend to look a little different, too. In spite of great strides
to make them fluffier and airier, they’re still a little denser and turn out best if
you make them in smaller loaves. They also don’t rise as much, so the tops
are sometimes flat or even concave.
154
Part II: Planning and Preparing: The Preludes to Cooking 
Time-saving tips for the gluten-free cook
I know I tend to have a PollyDanna approach to
the gluten-free lifestyle, but even I admit that
being gluten-free sometimes does take more
time and effort. That’s why I thought you may
appreciate some tips to save you time in your
gluten-free cooking adventures.
 Make your gluten-free baking mixtures in
advance, and double the recipe. Store them
in large canisters in a cool, dry, dark place,
and label them well (for example, “GF bread
mix,” “GF baking mix”). Remember, though,
not to add the yeast until baking day. Fresh
yeast comes in amber-colored, tightly
sealed jars or individual packets to keep it
as fresh as possible, which is best for
baking.
 Make as much of the meal as possible
gluten-free. If you have a blended family,
with some members eating gluten and
others eating gluten-free, making most of
the meal without gluten is easier on you.
This practice also makes the gluten-free
member feel more included.
 Save your gluten-free mistakes or stale
breads, because one bad batch is another
meal. So the bread didn’t rise, the cake
crumbled, and the biscuits fell apart? Save
the crumbs and use them for stuffings,
casseroles, coatings, or breadcrumbs. (By
the way, the easiest way to make fine
crumbs is to put dry crumbs into a food
processor or chopper.)

You always need to toast gluten-free bread. Toasting gives it a better consis-
tency and makes it less likely to crumble. Gluten-free bread is great for grilled
sandwiches because the butter and grilling process gives it a crispy texture
and seals the bread so it doesn’t crumble.
Here are a few general bread-making tips:
 All the ingredients that you use, except water, should be at room 
temperature.
 The water that you mix the yeast with must be lukewarm. Too hot, and
you kill the yeast. Too cold, and you don’t activate it. Also, you should dis-
solve the yeast in the water before adding it to the rest of the ingredients.
 Adding extra protein in the form of eggs, egg substitutes, dry milk solids,
or cottage or ricotta cheese is important for helping the yeast work.
 Vinegar, usually cider vinegar, helps the yeast work and helps the flavor
of the bread emerge. Sometimes recipes call for lemon juice or a dough
enhancer instead. These ingredients also act as preservatives.
 You should use small loaf pans for gluten-free bread.
 Gluten-free bread tends to need to cook a little longer, so cover your loaf
with foil for the last 15 minutes or so to keep it from burning.
 Wait until the bread has cooled to room temperature to slice it.
Given the choice of doing something by hand or using an efficient, easy-to-
clean-made-for-the-job-tried-and-true tool to do it, I’m likely to opt for the
tool. If you want to use a bread machine for your gluten-free breads, keep a
few things in mind:
 Gluten-free bread needs only one kneading and one rising cycle. If you
have a setting that allows you to do only one kneading and one rising,
choose it.
 You really shouldn’t share your bread machine with gluten-containing
recipes. Getting all the residue off the beaters, pan, and other parts is
nearly impossible.
 If you haven’t bought a machine yet, buy one with strong paddles, a
strong motor, and a strong fan.
 If your bread turns out soggy, take it out just a few minutes after baking,
before the machine begins its “keep warm” cycle.
 Keep dry ingredients separate from wet ingredients, and add them in the
order the bread machine manufacturer recommends. Whisk together
wet ingredients before mixing them with the dry ingredients.
 A few minutes after the bread machine has started, use a rubber spatula
to scrape the dough off the sides of the pan back into the dough.
155
Chapter 9: Cooking: Tips and Techniques

If you’re a glutton for punishment and choose to mix your dough by hand,
keep these tips in mind:
 If you’re following a recipe that calls for using a bread machine, 
double the amount of yeast and use a little more liquid (a couple of
tablespoons).
 If you’re following a recipe that calls for a bread machine and specifies
that you use one teaspoon of unflavored gelatin, leave it out.

Getting Your Day Off to 
a Gluten-Free Start
If mornings are a tad chaotic at your house, taking the time to prepare a
healthy, gluten-free breakfast may seem like a luxury you can’t afford. But in
reality, breakfast really is, as your mom probably told you, the most impor-
tant meal of the day. Not only does breakfast help with weight management
by revving up your metabolism first thing in the morning, but breakfast
eaters also have more positive attitudes and perform better at work and
school. Starting your day with a nutritious gluten-free breakfast has a positive
impact on your entire day.
Breakfast is the first meal you eat after you wake up — after you’ve “fasted”
for eight or more hours (hence the clever name for this meal: break fast).
Your body is literally starved for nutrition and restoration to get going for the
day ahead. Yet many people aren’t hungry, or at least they think they aren’t
hungry — and most people are frantically rushing to get themselves or
others out the door. Usually, what’s sacrificed in this whirlwind of chaos is a
healthy breakfast.
Grab ’n go starters
If you’re limited on time, you still have plenty of nutritious gluten-free foods to
choose from. The trick is to stock up on wholesome foods that are easy to eat
and that you can take with you as you’re running out the door. And the foods
don’t have to be traditional breakfast foods. Here are some suggestions:
 Cottage cheese (with or without fruit) in travel packaging
 Fresh or dried fruit or “fruit in a cup” products
 Gluten-free crackers with cheese slices
 Hard-boiled eggs (for extra flair, make them deviled)
 Homemade granola (like the upcoming “Gluten-Free Granola” recipe)
 Leftover gluten-free pizza
 Lowfat or nonfat yogurt

Part III: From Menus to Meals: Recipes for the Gluten-Free Gastronome 

Trail mix is a fancy way to describe a mixture of nuts, dried fruit, and other
bite-sized munchies, and it makes a great portable breakfast. Calling it trail
mix gives the illusion that it’s nutritious, even though some people work to dig
out the chocolate chips! You can buy pre-made mixes, but be careful because
some of the dried fruits (especially dates) are coated in oat flour, and some of
the nuts have seasonings on them that may contain gluten. It’s easy to make
your own using your favorite gluten-free ingredients, which may include
 Nuts (like peanuts, almonds, and cashews)
 Dried fruit (like raisins, apricots, banana chips, and cranberries)
 Shaved coconut
 Chocolate chips or chunks
 Carob
If you know you’ll be rushed in the morning, pack a breakfast-on-the-go meal
the night before. Put trail mix, yogurt, an apple, and a small juice or water
bottle in a brown paper bag and put it in the fridge. If you really want to
embarrass your kids or spouse, decorate the bag with colorful hearts and
doodles. And don’t forget a spoon for the yogurt!

T Gluten-Free Granola
Granola is a great take-it-with-you breakfast food, but oats are still the number-one most
controversial is-it-gluten-free-or-isn’t-it food, and for now they’re still on the forbidden
list. That means commercial granolas are a no-no. The good news is that gluten-free gra-
nola is delicious, nutritious, and a cinch to make the night before. In this recipe, I call
for roasted peanuts, but feel free to substitute any 1-cup combination of soy nuts, sun-
flower seeds, or almonds. Likewise, dried apricots, dates, and bananas work well in
place of the raisins and dried cranberries.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 2 hours
Yield: 12 servings
2 cups puffed rice cereal
2 cups puffed corn cereal
1 cup Perky’s Nutty Rice cereal
1 cup Kashi Cranberry Sunshine cereal
1 cup roasted peanuts
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1⁄2 cup light corn syrup
1⁄2 cup honey
1⁄4 cup vegetable oil
1⁄2 cup raisins
1⁄2 cup dried cranberries
Nonstick spray
1 Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.
2 In a large bowl, combine the puffed rice cereal, puffed corn cereal, Perky’s Nutty Rice
cereal, Kashi Cranberry Sunshine cereal, and peanuts.
3 In a small saucepan, heat the vanilla extract, light corn syrup, honey, and oil over
medium heat (it just needs to get warm so it flows more easily; don’t overheat it). Stir
the mixture occasionally as it heats.
4 Pour the warm honey mixture over the dry ingredients, making sure it all gets mixed up.
5 Place the mixture on large baking sheets that you’ve coated with nonstick spray. Bake
the granola for 2 hours, stirring every 15 minutes to keep the mixture from sticking.
6 Carefully add the raisins and cranberries to the hot granola, folding them into the mix-
ture so they’re well mixed. Let the granola cool to room temperature, and serve.
Tip: Homemade granola tends to go stale quickly. Extend the life of your homemade gra-
nola by using a vacuum-packing system to seal and store several individual-sized servings.
Too late? If your granola has already gone stale, use it to make granola bars (see recipe in
Chapter 15).

Power-start your gluten-free 
day with protein
Protein really does pack a nutritional punch, regulating blood-sugar levels
and providing lots of time-released energy throughout the day. By starting
your day with a meal high in protein, you’re giving yourself a nutritional
boost that can carry you for hours.
Not only does protein provide sustained energy, but it helps you lose weight.
Protein stimulates the secretion of glucagon, a hormone that tells your body
to mobilize fat and begin breaking it down. This reduces fat stores and, ulti-
mately, your waistline.
Fortunately, high-protein foods are plentiful in the gluten-free diet. In fact,
many of the foods found on “traditional” breakfast menus that aren’t gluten-
free, such as bagels and pancakes, actually offer very little in the way of pro-
tein. In contrast, many foods that are inherently gluten-free, such as eggs and
meats, are very high in protein.
From a gluten-free standpoint, whether your protein is from plant or animal
sources really doesn’t matter. Eggs are an obvious source of protein for
breakfast (see the following section for recipe ideas using eggs), but you can
incorporate plenty of other protein sources into your first meal of the day:
 Canadian bacon or ham slices
 Dairy products (lowfat milk, cheese, and yogurt)
 Lean sirloin or steak strips
 Nuts
 Protein shakes and smoothies (you can find recipe ideas under
“Smoothies for Starters”)
 Turkey slices
The Incredible, Edible Egg
Eggs offer more value than many people realize. They’re extremely nutritious,
containing all the essential amino acids and countless vitamins and antioxi-
dants. They’re also convenient, inexpensive, easy to prepare, and easy to
chew. They rarely cause allergic reactions, and they play important roles in a
variety of recipes.
163
Chapter 10: First Things First: Beginning with Breakfast

Have you ever wondered how to tell whether your eggs are raw or hard-
boiled? Simply take ’em for a spin. A hard-boiled one spins freely, and a raw
one doesn’t. This happens because the hard-boiled one is solid, so every-
thing spins in one direction all at once. The raw egg sloshes around and 
doesn’t allow a fast spinning motion.

T Eggs in a Bread Basket
This is a fun way to serve eggs and toast, especially if you have kids in the house.
Because gluten-free breads tend to be smaller than other breads, you may want to put
two slices side by side, cutting shapes in the touching edges to create the cut-out area
that the egg goes into.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 slices gluten-free bread
4 tablespoons margarine
4 eggs
1 Heat a griddle or large nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. While the pan is
heating, butter both sides of each piece of bread.
2 In the center of each bread slice, cut out a circle about the size of an egg. You can use a
knife to cut the circle, or use a cookie cutter to make cute shapes.
3 Make sure the pan or griddle is hot enough that if you put a drop of water on it, the
water sizzles. When the pan or griddle is hot, put all the bread — slices and cutouts —
on the pan or griddle to fry.
4 When the bottom side of the bread is golden brown, after about 2 minutes, flip each
slice and cutout.
5 Crack an egg into the hole in the center of each slice of bread. You may find you have
too much egg and that it covers the bread. That’s okay.
6 When the second side of bread is golden brown, after about 2 minutes, flip it over again
to cook the egg on the other side. Cook the egg until it’s the firmness you enjoy, and
serve the “eggs in a basket” with the cooked cutouts as decorative additions.
Vary It! If you’d like to cut out a lot of the cholesterol, toss the yolks and simply make this
recipe with the whites.

3 cups frozen hash browns, thawed
1⁄3 cup melted butter
Nonstick spray
5 eggs
3⁄4 cup milk
1 cup cooked diced ham
1⁄3 cup diced onion
1 cup grated Swiss cheese
1⁄4 cup grated cheddar cheese
1⁄4 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese
2 teaspoons chopped fresh basil
Salt and pepper to taste

Breakfast Quiche
“Real men” may not eat quiche, but gluten-free people can — with a few modifications,
of course. The beauty of this dish is that with a few tricks, it’s incredibly easy . . . and
with a little creativity, it can be exceptionally nutritious. This dish is great as a vegetar-
ian dish — just leave the meat out and add extra veggies.

Olive oil spray
1⁄2 cup egg whites (from about 4 to 5 eggs)
3 tablespoons sun-dried tomatoes (I prefer
the hydrated kind, not packed in oil)
1⁄4 cup fresh basil leaves, packed in the
measuring cup
4 pitted Kalamata olives
1⁄2 teaspoon minced garlic (about 1 clove)
2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese
2 slices toasted gluten-free bread
1 Spray a 4-inch ramekin (a small casserole dish) or bowl with olive oil spray. Place the
ramekin in a large pot, and then add water to the pot until the water level comes
halfway up the sides of the dish.
2 Place the pot over high heat, and add the egg whites to the ramekin. As soon as the
water boils, turn the heat to low and cover the pot. Set the timer for 15 minutes.
3 While the eggs are cooking, combine the tomatoes, basil, olives, and garlic in a small
food processor. Pulse the ingredients until they’re finely minced. Stir in the feta cheese.
4 When the 15-minute timer goes off, check the eggs. Cook the eggs until the center is no
longer runny. When the eggs are done, carefully remove the ramekin from the hot, sim-
mering water.
5 Toast the bread. Spread two tablespoons of the basil-tomato-cheese mixture on each
piece of toast.
6 Loosen the eggs from the dish with a knife and plop them onto the toast. Each piece of
toast should get half the eggs. Add the remaining basil-tomato-cheese mixture on top of
the eggs and serve.

T “Greece-y” Eggs
If you’re in a Mediterranean-morning mood, try these “Greece-y” eggs, which include
sun-dried tomatoes, olives, and feta cheese. Actually not greasy at all, these are an espe-
cially lowfat version of Greek eggs because they use only the egg whites. To see how to
separate whites from yolks, check out Figure 10-1.

Smoothies for Starters
Smoothies are a great way to start the day. These thick, smooth drinks use a
foundation of fruit or fruit juice, milk, and yogurt or ice cream. No need for
any fancy equipment — any blender, immersion hand-blender, or even a
shaker cup will work. Not only are smoothies delicious and easy to whip up,
but sneaking lots of nutritious things into them without anyone knowing is
easy. Creamy, rich, refreshing, and energizing, smoothies suit any taste and
any mood. The only thing limiting your options is your creativity.
If you have bananas lying around that are a little too brown for your taste, or
strawberries that are getting a tad too mushy, toss them in a smoothie.
Bananas and other fruits, especially when at the tail end of being aestheti-
cally acceptable, sweeten up smoothies and add loads of nutritional value.
Be creative in your attempts at stealth health. Here’s a starter list to give you
some ideas of things you can slip into smoothies to enhance the nutritional
value. You can find all these ingredients at most health food stores:

Chapter 10: First Things First: Beginning with Breakfast

 Protein powder: Literally hundreds of types of protein powders are on
the market— low-carb, low-cal, high-carb, high-cal, and everything in
between. They’re usually derived from whey, egg, soy, and rice, and they
come in both flavored and unflavored varieties.
 Spirulina: For centuries, people across the world have been eating spir-
ulina, a blue-green algae purported to be ultra-rich in vitamins and min-
erals, with claims of nutritional and medicinal benefits.
 “Greens”: Sometimes called superfoods, greens come in the form of a
powder and are specialized plants that provide a full spectrum of natu-
rally occurring, absorbable vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, amino
acids, fatty acids, fiber, and other beneficial nutrients.
 Flaxseed meal or flax seeds: Flax is rich in protein but is most notable
for its addition of essential fatty acids and fiber to the diet. (You may
also want to note that it’s a potent laxative, so beware!)
 Omega-3, -6, and -9 essential fatty acid oils: Although these offer the
same type of essential fatty oil that flax adds, some people prefer the
oils to the meal or seed, especially for smoothies.
 Instant breakfast powders: This is a quick way to add some nutrients
and flavor to a smoothie. Check the flavors to make sure the one you’re
using is gluten-free; some are, but some aren’t.
And of course, the all-time winner for perking up your smoothie with nutri-
tional value, color, and overall goodness goes to ripe fruits and veggies.

T Simple, Stylin’ Smoothie
This is the foundation smoothie from which all other smoothies are born: simple, deli-
cious, and just waiting for you to enhance it with nutritious ingredients and a creative
style all your own. This smoothie combines the sweetness of bananas and honey with
the slight tartness of strawberry yogurt.
Tools: Blender
Preparation time: 4 minutes
Yield: 3 cups
1⁄2 cup milk
1 cup strawberry yogurt
2 ripe bananas
1 teaspoon honey
1⁄4 cup ice cubes
1 Put all the ingredients in a blender.
2 Mix until smooth.

Vary It! Remember, you can make a smoothie countless ways — be creative, and use
ingredients you have on hand, especially those that are a little too ripe to eat plain. Play
with the portion sizes and types of ingredients you use to get the taste and nutritional value
that suits you. The only fruit that doesn’t work well is citrus.

Fruit and berry smoothies are delicious and nutritious, for sure. But if you’re in the
mood for something with a little more substance — and, well, a few more calories — the
chocolate peanut butter smoothie is for you. Go ahead — live a little, and whip it up!

Vary It! I call for chocolate ice cream in this recipe because, well, everything is better with
chocolate. But feel free to switch things up in the ice cream department. Almost any flavor
works, but vanilla is sure to please (and I’d think about staying away from strawberry or
mint).

Wake Up and Smell the Coffee Cake: 
Hot Breakfast Ideas
Ah . . . few things get a morning off to a better start than waking up to the
smell of freshly baked muffins or coffee cake. Think you have to do without
that experience on the gluten-free diet? No, my gluten-free friends. This 

section proves that opportunities abound for the ooey, gooey breakfast foods
that you may have feared were a thing of the past.
Many of the recipes for baked goods and quick breads call for a gluten-free
flour mixture. You can either buy a baking mix or create your own. I’ve put
together a list of recommended baking mixtures and a recipe for how to make
your own in Chapter 9.

T Coffee Cake
I wonder why it’s called coffee cake when there’s no coffee in it. Well anyway, coffee
or no coffee, this cake is sure to get the family out of bed and down to the breakfast
table in a hurry. And no wonder — if they’re like me, they’re probably just after the
cinnamon-sugar streusel topping!
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1⁄4 cup canola oil
2 eggs, beaten
1⁄2 cup milk
11⁄2 cups gluten-free flour
mixture
11⁄2 teaspoons xanthan gum
1 cup sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
Nonstick spray
1⁄2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons gluten-free
flour mixture
2 teaspoons cinnamon
3 tablespoons melted butter
1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2 In a large mixing bowl, combine the oil, eggs, and milk.
3 Sift together the 11⁄2 cups flour mixture, xanthan gum, sugar, and baking powder. Add
these dry ingredients to the egg mixture, and mix well.
4 Spray a 9-inch square pan with nonstick spray, and pour in the batter.
5 In a small bowl, create the streusel topping by mixing together the brown sugar, 2 table-
spoons flour mixture, cinnamon, and butter. Pour the topping mixture over the cake
batter.
6 Bake the cake for 25 minutes. To see whether the cake’s done, insert a toothpick in the
center of the cake. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cake’s ready.

T Pancakes
Whether you call them hotcakes, griddle cakes, flapjacks, flannel cakes, or johnnycakes,
pancakes have been cherished as a favorite breakfast staple for centuries. You can also
use this batter to make waffles — just follow the cooking instructions that came with your
waffle iron. Dress up your waffles and pancakes by adding sliced bananas or chocolate
chips to the batter, or top them with fresh fruit or whipped topping. Personally, I think the
best thing about pancakes and waffles is that they soak up lots and lots of syrup.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes per pancake
Yield: 8 servings
Nonstick spray
1 cup gluten-free flour
mixture
1 teaspoon xanthan gum
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoons vanilla
2 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup milk
1 Heat a griddle or frying pan over medium heat. To see whether the pan is at the right
temperature, let a drop of water fall in the pan — if the water sizzles immediately and
moves around, the pan’s hot enough. Spray the pan lightly with nonstick spray.
2 In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour mixture, xanthan gum, and baking powder.
Add the vanilla, eggs, oil, and milk. Stir the batter until moistened, using a whisk to
remove lumps.
3 Use a large spoon to drop about 1⁄3 cup batter onto the hot griddle or pan (to make
mouse pancakes, drop one large spoonful of batter, and use two smaller ones for ears).
4 Bubbles should begin to form in about 3 minutes. When they do, lift a pancake slightly
with a spatula to see whether the underside is golden brown. If it is, flip the pancake
over. This time you won’t see bubbles to know when the pancake is browning, so you’ll
have to check occasionally. Usually the pancake takes 2 to 3 minutes to become golden
brown on the second side.
Tip: Try using “melted” berries for a healthy syrup option. Put fresh or frozen whole straw-
berries or blueberries in a saucepan with a little sugar, mash the berries slightly, and add a
tiny bit of water. Heat the mixture slowly until the sugar dissolves in the juice.

T Crêpes
The word crêpe is French for pancake and is derived from crêper, meaning “to crisp.”
Basically thin, crisp pancakes, crêpes are most delightful when filled with a variety of
stuffings or smothered in garnishes or syrups. Although creating crêpe batter is simple,
actually cooking crêpes can take a little practice. The technique starts with a good pan.
You can buy pans made specifically for crêpes, but you really don’t need one. Any flat-
bottomed nonstick skillet between seven and eight inches in diameter will do. Make
sure it’s nonstick and shallow and has sloping sides.
Tools: Crêpe pan or flat-bottomed nonstick skillet
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 cup gluten-free flour mixture
1⁄2 teaspoon xanthan gum
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup milk
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons melted butter
Nonstick spray
1 In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour mixture, xanthan gum, and eggs.
Gradually add the milk, stirring to combine.
2 Add the salt and the butter; beat the mixture until it’s smooth. The thickness should be
about that of cream. If it’s too thick or runny, add a bit of flour or milk until you achieve
the desired consistency.
3 Heat a pan over medium-high heat. To see whether the pan is at the right temperature,
sprinkle a drop of water on it. If the water bounces around, the pan is hot enough. Spray
the pan liberally with nonstick spray.
4 Pour just enough batter in the pan to be able to make a thin coating on the bottom of
the pan. For an 8-inch crêpe pan, use 1⁄4 cup batter. Lift the pan off the burner and
quickly tilt the pan so the batter sloshes from side-to-side, thinly covering the entire
bottom.
5 Return the pan to the burner. When the crêpe is light brown on the bottom and the top
of the crêpe is firm, after about 1 minute, gently loosen it with a spatula and flip it. Start
checking the bottom of the crêpe when the sides become crispy and slightly loosen
themselves from the pan. When both sides are light brown (the second side browns
more quickly than the first), your crêpes are ready!

Tip: Figuring out how to make crêpes is a matter of trial and error, and pan temperature is
important. The batter should cook as soon as it touches the pan but shouldn’t sizzle. If your
crêpes are thick or bubbly, turn down the heat or lift the pan off the burner for a while. If
they stick or aren’t browning or setting, turn up the heat or return the pan to the burner.
Vary It! Dress to impress. Without toppings and fillings, crêpes are just — well, just thin,
crispy pancakes. The fun — and the way to really impress your guests — is with the fillings
and toppings. The key is, once again, creativity. You can either spread some filling on a
crêpe and roll it up, or spread the filling and cover it with another crêpe, sandwich-style.
You can make as many layers as you like, and even alternate fillings. Here are some ideas
to get you started that also work well with pancakes and waffles:
 Peaches ’n cream: Combine fresh, sliced peaches with cream cheese, sour cream,
whipped cream, and brown sugar.
 Banana sundae: Not exactly on the Weight Watchers menu, this indulgence calls for
using sliced bananas as a filling and then topping the crêpes with your favorite ice
cream and sauce (caramel, butterscotch, chocolate, hot fudge, and so on). Top it off
with whipped cream or even banana liqueur.
 Strawberry style: In a hurry? Mix a little strawberry jam with ricotta or cream cheese.
You may want to sweeten it up a tad with a dash of sugar or sugar substitute — and if
you’re feeling really wild and crazy, top the crêpe with fresh strawberries.
 Ready-to-spread toppings: Even quicker ideas for toppings include applesauce, 
powdered sugar, whipped cream, and nondairy whipped topping.

Crêpes suzette
The most famous crêpe dish throughout the
world seems to be crêpes suzette, often pre-
pared in restaurants in full view of the guests.
Served hot with a sauce of sugar, orange juice,
and Grand Marnier, crêpes suzette are usually
topped with brandy and ignited for the pyro
pleasure of everyone. In fact, the flames are all
for show, because flaming the brandy doesn’t
change the flavor of the dish in any way. (My
super-cautious editor insists that I warn you
about the dangers of preparing flaming dishes,
as the flame can be difficult to see and still be
present after you think it’s extinguished. Now I
have, and now you know.)

T Versatile Blueberry Muffins
Nothing makes you feel more like June Cleaver than to call your kids to a breakfast of
freshly baked muffins. You have lots of room for creativity here — hence the name ver-
satile muffins.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1 cup gluten-free flour mixture
1⁄4 teaspoon xanthan gum
4 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
2 teaspoons vanilla
2 eggs, beaten
11⁄2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 teaspoons milk
1⁄2 cup blueberries
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 In a large bowl, combine the flour mixture, xanthan gum, sugar, baking powder, and cin-
namon. Add the vanilla, eggs, oil, and milk. Stir until all the batter is moistened (use a
whisk to remove lumps). Fold in the blueberries.
3 Pour the batter into a muffin tin lined with paper muffin cups.
4 Bake the muffins for 20 to 25 minutes. Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick in
the center of a muffin. If the toothpick comes out without batter on it (it may have blue-
berries on it), the muffins are done.
Vary It! Instead of blueberries, consider using applesauce (I like chunks of apples, too),
bananas, or other fruits. Toss in a dash of cinnamon, too.

strawberries. Don’t forget the syrup!
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 6 minutes per slice
Yield: 6 servings
4 eggs
1⁄4 cup milk
1⁄4 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)
2 tablespoons butter
6 slices gluten-free bread
1 In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, milk, and cinnamon (if desired). Beat the mixture
with a whisk or fork until well blended.
2 Melt the butter in a large frying pan or griddle over medium heat.
3 Dip each slice of bread in the egg mixture, coating the bread well on both sides.
4 Place the bread on the hot griddle or in the pan. Cook the bread until it’s golden brown
on both sides, about 3 minutes per side.
5 Serve the French toast warm. You can top the toast with syrup, powdered sugar, and/or
sliced strawberries — get creative.

T Chile Rellenos Casserole
Whether for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, chile rellenos are a great gluten-free meal that
couldn’t be much easier to make. When you eat these for breakfast, you’re sure to have
an olé kind of day. Serve these rellenos with warm corn tortillas and salsa, topped with
guacamole for a creamy, flavorful touch (see Chapter 11 for my guacamole recipe).
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
Nonstick spray
6 eggs
Salt and pepper to taste
1 pound colby cheese, grated
1 pound Monterey Jack cheese, grated
2 8-ounce cans whole green chilies
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 9- by 13-inch casserole dish with nonstick
spray.
2 Separate the egg whites from the yolks. With an electric mixer on medium speed, whip
the whites in a medium bowl until they’re stiff. In a small bowl, beat the yolks with a
fork or a whisk until they’re smooth. Fold the yolks into the whites. Add salt and
pepper.
3 Combine the colby and Monterey Jack cheeses.
4 Spread about 1⁄3 of the egg mixture in the bottom of the dish.
5 Split open the chilies. Layer the chilies on top of the egg mixture. Spread a layer of
cheese on top. Continue layering — egg, chilies, cheese — until you’ve used all the
ingredients. You should end up with about three layers of each ingredient, finishing with
the egg mixture.
6 Bake the chile rellenos for 25 minutes or until golden brown.

ppetizers, by definition, whet people’s
appetites — you know, make ’em hungry. (Am
I the only one who sees some irony in filling up on
yummy starters in order to make you hungrier?)
Every great get-together begins with great-tasting
appetizers, whether you’re at a casual gathering of
friends and family or an elegant soirée among
socialites. Not only do appetizers whet the
appetite, but they whet the imagination, setting
the stage for the meal yet to come.
But appetizer anticipation can quickly turn to disappointment for someone
on the gluten-free diet, as more often than not, appetizers, by definition, seem
to be big globs of gluten. And the party planner perusing most appetizer
recipes finds that appetizers are likely to contain flour, breading, or myriad
other gluten-
containing ingredients, striking fear into hosts and hostesses everywhere:
What can I serve that’s impressive and gluten-free?
If you find yourself paralyzed with appetizer anxiety, never fear: Gluten-free
appetizers are here! Just don’t blame me if everyone’s too full for the main
course.

T “It’s-Not-Chex” Party Mix
Chex Party Mix is always a fiesta favorite, but unfortunately, Chex has gluten in it (and
in rare occasions, so does Worcestershire sauce). Let that stop you from enjoying one
of the best snack foods on the planet? I think not! With some simple substitutions, you
can transform party mix into a gluten-free version of its sister snack, and no one may
ever know the difference. Warning: Party mix is extremely addictive.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 12 servings
6 tablespoons margarine
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
3⁄4 teaspoon garlic powder
11⁄2 teaspoons seasoned salt
1⁄2 teaspoon onion powder
4 cups Health Valley Corn Crunch-Ems!
cereal
4 cups Health Valley Rice Crunch-Ems! cereal
1 Heat the oven to 250 degrees. Melt the margarine in a large roasting pan in the oven.
2 Remove the pan from the oven, and stir the Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, sea-
soned salt, and onion powder into the margarine. Gradually stir in the corn and rice
cereals until they’re evenly coated with the margarine-seasonings mixture.
3 Return the pan to the oven. Bake the mix for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes.
4 Spread the mix on paper towels to cool. Store it in an airtight container.

T Spicy Corn Fritters
This delicious dish uses polenta. Once considered a peasant food (like its cousin corn
grits), polenta is an Italian cornmeal mush that’s becoming quite trendy. You can find
polenta at most grocery stores, and it often comes in a round plastic tube. For this
appetizer, the polenta adds more than just flavor — it actually holds the corn balls
together.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 cup canned corn
2 fresh red chilies, seeded and finely chopped
1 teaspoon minced garlic (about 2 cloves)
10 kaffir lime leaves, finely chopped (found in
Thai sections of Asian markets)
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
2 eggs, beaten
1⁄2 cup pre-made polenta (about 4 ounces)
1⁄4 cup finely sliced green beans
1⁄2 cup peanut oil (for frying)
1 Put the corn, chilies, garlic, lime leaves, cilantro, eggs, polenta, and green beans into a
large bowl; mix them thoroughly. Use your hands to form balls about the size of golf
balls. Set them on a plate.
2 Heat the peanut oil in a wok, skillet, or deep fryer to a high heat. You’ll know the oil is
hot enough when you add a small drop of water into the oil and it pops. (Be careful,
though. More than a drop, and it may pop and burn you.)
3 Turning the fritters occasionally, cook them in the oil until they’re brown and crispy on
the outside (about 7 minutes). Remove the fritters from the wok, skillet, or deep fryer
with a slotted spoon, and let them drain on paper towels.

Buffalo for the city in New York where they originated in 1964. Remember to serve them
with celery sticks and ranch dressing.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 2 dozen wings
11⁄2 cups gluten-free flour mixture
2 teaspoons seasoned salt, divided
24 chicken wings
Oil for frying
1⁄2 cup red wine vinegar
1⁄2 cup honey
2 tablespoons molasses
3 tablespoons ketchup
3 tablespoons Cholula or your favorite 
hot sauce
1 Put the flour mixture and 1 teaspoon of the seasoned salt in a gallon-sized plastic bag,
and shake the bag to mix them. Add the wings (about five at a time) and shake the bag
to coat them well.
2 Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a heavy skillet. Fry the wings in about 2 inches of
hot oil for approximately 5 minutes, until they’re crispy on the outside. Break a wing
open and make sure the meat inside isn’t pink. Drain the wings on paper towels.
3 Prepare the sauce by mixing the remaining teaspoon of seasoned salt, red wine vinegar,
honey, molasses, ketchup, and hot sauce together in a medium bowl.
4 Dip the cooked wings in the mixture to coat them with the sauce.
Tip: For an easier recipe, use commercial wing or hot sauces. Simply coat and cook the
wings as indicated in steps 1 and 2 and then coat the wings with sauce as indicated in step 4.

Digging into Dips and Dippers
Whether you’re dipping veggies, chips, or fried foods, a few good dips go a
long way, and you can vary your repertoire of basic recipes to create exciting
gluten-free graze-ables. Although many dips are inherently gluten-free, others
require just a few tweaks here and there to make them safe for anyone avoid-
ing gluten.
Double-dipping is not allowed, especially if some of the guests are eating
gluten-containing foods. After people have dunked gobs of gluten into the
dip, it’s no longer gluten-free.

Helpful hints if you’re relying on frying
Inarguably not one of the healthier modes of
cooking, frying is, nonetheless, a common cook-
ing method, especially for many appetizers.
Here are some important tips that may help you
create the perfect crunch:
 Use oil you designate for gluten-free foods.
If you’re preparing gluten-containing foods
and gluten-free ones, make sure you either
cook the gluten-free foods first or change
the oil in between. Breadings and batters
can contaminate the oil, turning your
gluten-free goodie into an unwitting source
of wheat.
 Choose the right oil. Some oils, like olive
and sesame oil, aren’t meant to be heated
to the very high temperatures deep frying
requires. Corn, canola, and peanut oils are
some of the best deep-frying oils, because
they have a high smoking point. Find an oil
that matches the flavor profile of the food
you’re cooking and turn down the heat if
your oil begins to smoke, which indicates
the oil is degrading. Degrading oil can affect
the flavor of the food.
 Don’t overload the basket. If you’re impa-
tient like I am, you may be tempted to
“hurry” the cooking process by cooking as
much as you can at once. Overloading the
basket can result in uneven cooking and
may even cause the food to absorb extra oil.
 Filter and clean often. If the oil gets smoky
or has debris in it, dump it out and start with
new oil. Clean your fry pot regularly.
Once you’ve finished frying or deep frying your
favorite gluten-free goodies, you need to figure
out what to do with the used cooking oil. You
can’t just dump it down the drain; that’s not only
bad for the environment, but it’s bound to clog
the pipes. After the oil has completely cooled,
pour it into a coffee can or other empty can or
jar with a lid. Seal the lid tightly and throw it in
the trash. Keep empty cans and lids on hand to
use for getting rid of used cooking grease.
Some restaurants have grease bins where they
keep used grease, and it’s later recycled. If you
do a lot of frying and have a lot of grease to get
rid of, you may want to ask permission to use a
local restaurant’s recycling bin.

By the way, dips aren’t just for dipping. Use them as fillings for hollowed veg-
gies or halved hard-boiled eggs, or spread them on quesadillas. Or put them
on crêpes (you can find a recipe in Chapter 10) or corn tortillas — you can
roll the filling into a wrap and then eat the whole thing as a tasty picnic snack
or slice it into stylish roll-ups.
T Artichoke and Spinach Dip
You won’t find this one in Dieting For Dummies, but it is gluten-free! Use this cheesy dip
with corn tortilla chips, rice crackers, veggies, or deep-fried potato skins. Or if you have
a favorite gluten-free bread, slice it thinly, toast it, and spread the artichoke and spinach
dip on top.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 12 servings
8-ounce package cream cheese
1⁄4 cup mayonnaise
1⁄2 teaspoon minced garlic (about 1 clove)
1 teaspoon fresh basil
Salt and pepper to taste
1⁄2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1⁄2 cup grated Romano cheese
1⁄4 cup grated mozzarella cheese
14-ounce jar artichoke hearts, drained and
chopped
1⁄2 cup spinach, drained and chopped
Nonstick spray
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Let the cream cheese warm to room temperature.
2 In a large bowl, cream together the cream cheese, mayonnaise, garlic, basil, and salt
and pepper. Setting aside a few teaspoons of each cheese to use as a topping, add the
Parmesan, Romano, and mozzarella cheeses. Mix until everything is well blended.
3 Add the artichoke hearts and spinach, and mix again.
4 Spray a one-quart ovenproof serving dish with nonstick spray, pour in the dip, and top
it with the cheese you set aside in step 2.
5 Bake the dip for about 25 minutes or until the top begins to brown and the cheese melts.

T Guacamole
Guacamole is an avocado-based dip that originated in Mexico. Most guacamole recipes
start with fresh, peeled avocados and add lime (or lemon) juice, tomatoes, onions,
cilantro, garlic, and spices. The lime juice actually keeps the guacamole from turning
brown when you expose it to the air. Leaving the avocado pit in the guacamole until just
before you serve it also decreases browning. For this guacamole, feel free to kick it up a
notch with your favorite hot sauce.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
2 ripe avocados
1 small-to-medium ripe tomato, diced
1⁄2 small red onion, chopped
1⁄2 teaspoon finely cut jalapeño pepper
4 tablespoons lime juice
2 teaspoons chopped cilantro
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
Salt and pepper to taste
1 Peel the avocados, remove the flesh from the pits, and cube the avocado flesh. Save the
pits. See Figure 11-1 if you’re not sure how to remove the pit from an avocado.
2 In a medium bowl, combine the avocado flesh, tomato, onion, jalapeño, lime juice,
cilantro, Worcestershire sauce, and salt and pepper.
3 Mix all the ingredients well, keeping the guacamole lumpy. Place the avocado pit in the
dip and remove the pit just before serving.

Becoming an avocado aficionado
Avocados are one of nature’s prepackaged
wonder foods. Most people think they’re a veg-
etable, but they’re actually a fruit. Loaded with
potassium (60 percent more than bananas!) and
the good-for-you monounsaturated fat, avoca-
dos are sodium- and cholesterol-free. Here are
some other avocado factoids:
 California grows 95 percent of the United
States’ avocados, and most of those (60 per-
cent) grow in San Diego County (where I live!).
 One California avocado tree can produce
about 120 avocados each year. That’s about
60 pounds of fruit.
 California avocados grow year-round.
 In Latin America, people wrap avocados
and give them as wedding gifts.
 Some people claim avocados are an 
aphrodisiac.
T Mango Salsa
Salsas come in endless forms and flavors. Fresh mango salsa is versatile and easy to
make. You can serve it as a dip or use it to dress up main courses, putting it over grilled
pork, chicken, or salmon. You can also use it to make fish tacos — just spoon this salsa
over cooked fish and wrap the mixture in a corn tortilla.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1 ripe mango, peeled, pitted, and diced (about
1 cup)
1⁄2 medium red onion, finely chopped
1 jalapeño pepper, minced
1 large tomato, diced
1⁄4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
4 tablespoons fresh lime juice
Salt and pepper to taste
1 Combine the mango, onion, jalapeño, tomato, cilantro, lime juice, and salt and pepper in
a bowl; mix them until well-blended. Don’t mix so hard that you mash the mango — the
salsa should contain chunks.
2 Chill the salsa for an hour or more to blend all the flavors.
Tip: Check out Figure 11-2 to see how to dice a mango. With that big seed in the middle,
they aren’t easy to work with.

T Homemade Tortilla Chips
Corn tortilla chips, or totopos in Spanish, are great for scooping up salsas or dips. You
can sprinkle them with a little grated cheese, or queso seco (dry Mexican cheese), and
serve them with other dishes, such as soups. Start with corn tortillas that are a few
days old; fresh tortillas don’t crisp as well when you fry them.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 48 chips
1 Cut each corn tortilla into six triangular wedges.
2 Pour the oil into a large, heavy frying pan (or deep fryer) so at least 1⁄2 inch of oil covers
the bottom. You want enough oil in the pan so that both sides of the tortilla can cook at
the same time. Place the pan over medium-high heat.
3 Test the oil temperature by putting one tortilla wedge into the oil. If it bubbles and floats,
the oil is hot enough. If not, discard that wedge and wait for the oil to heat some more.
4 Fry the tortilla wedges until golden brown (just a few moments). Use a slotted spoon or
tongs to remove them from the oil, and drain the chips on paper towels.
5 Sprinkle the tortilla wedges with salt.
Vary It! To make lower-fat tortilla chips, bake fresh corn tortillas at 400 degrees for 8 to
10 minutes or until they’re crispy. You can cut the tortillas into triangles before baking or
break them into chips afterward.

Going Wild with Wraps
As one of today’s most popular food trends, wraps offer never-ending possi-
bilities for gluten-free dishes, many of which make great appetizers or main
dishes. The only limits to what you can make into a wrap are your creativity
and your sense of adventure. Use corn tortillas, crêpes, rice wraps, or lettuce
for your wrapper, and then let your imagination run wild as you concoct
clever, flavorful fillings based on which wrapper you’re using. (Check out
Chapter 10 for a gluten-free crêpe recipe.)
A word of advice, though: You may want to skip the wraps on a first date or
when you have the boss over for dinner. They’re delicious, no doubt, but you
may not make your best impression: A serving of these finger foods usually
turns into a fistful.
186
Part III: From Menus to Meals: Recipes for the Gluten-Free Gastronome 
Simple but sexy spreads
The difference between a dip and a spread is
consistency. A dip is creamier, so even a fragile
dipper can withstand the pressure of a good dig
through a dip. On the other hand, you usually
serve a spread with spreading knives and put it
on crackers, tortillas, or quesadillas.
Today, several widely available varieties of rice,
corn, and nut crackers make the perfect crack-
ers for spreads. Consider using these ideas to
impress your guests but still have plenty of time
left to enjoy your own party:
 Jalapeño cream cheese: Put a block of
cream cheese on a serving platter. Top it with
jalapeño jelly (you can usually find this in the
same aisle as all other jellies and jams). It’s
not too hot, but this jelly adds a slightly spicy,
semisweet topping to the cream cheese.
 Brown sugar on baked brie: Place a wedge
or round of brie cheese on an ovenproof
serving platter. Top the cheese with a layer
(about 1⁄4-inch thick) of light brown sugar.
Bake at 350 degrees for 8 minutes or until
the inside of the cheese appears to be soft.
 Crab cream cheese brick: Set a brick of
cream cheese on a serving platter. Drain a
can of crab meat and spread the meat
evenly over the top of the cream cheese.
Drizzle a tasty, spicy sauce over the top
(make a cool design if you feel so inclined).
 Hummus: Hummus is made from garbanzo
beans/chickpeas and is flavored with sea-
sonings such as garlic and spices.
Traditional hummus contains tahini, a
sesame seed paste. Usually available at any
grocery store, hummus’ consistency is
actually right in between a spread and a
dip, so it works well for either.

If you’re having trouble figuring out what to put in your wraps, I give you
some recipes to impress all your guests in the following sections. But here
are some ideas to get you started:
 Caesar salad wrap: Actually, any salad works well in a wrap. Of course,
using a lettuce wrapper is a bit redundant, and it really just looks like
you’re searching for an excuse to eat your salad with your hands. Go for
the corn tortilla.
 Fajita: Fajitas are basically a Mexican blend of marinated meat and sautéed
onions and peppers wrapped in a tortilla. Feel free to get creative, though,
and use any meat or veggie combination you like. You generally serve the
meat and veggies together and serve the tortillas separately so guests
can wrap them up themselves.
 Fish wraps: In Southern California, we call these “fish tacos.” Taco, wrap —
either way you wrap it, you have a corn tortilla holding a bunch of cooked
fish inside. Add some of that “Mango Salsa” from the recipe in this chap-
ter, and you’ve got yourself a gourmet meal!
 Leftovers wrap: Seriously, every fridge on the planet has something in it
that you can make into a wrap. Go with it. Mix. Blend. Be wild and crazy,
and clean out the refrigerator at the same time.
 Pulled pork wrap: You can use a barbecue sauce, salsa, or flavored 
mayonnaise to add more flavor to this wrap. I use either a corn tortilla
or a lettuce wrap for this.
 Quesadilla: A quesadilla is simply a folded tortilla — corn, for the
gluten-free crowd — with melted cheese inside.
 Spicy Southwest wrap: If you’re looking for a little zap in your wrap, spice
it up with a Southwest flair. Wrap up any burrito or enchilada filling with
lettuce or a corn tortilla.
Rice rolls
Rice rolls are a great type of wrap. Available in Asian markets, rice paper wrap-
pers come from a paste of ground rice and water, which people stamp into
rounds and dry. When you moisten pieces of rice paper, the brittle sheets
become flexible, which makes rice paper perfect for wraps. Rice paper wrap-
pers can be tricky to use, but they’re well worth it after you’ve gotten the hang
of working with them.
187
Chapter 11: Appetizers with Attitude

Pre-made wrappers and bottled dipping sauces are readily available in Asian
markets and the Asian section of most supermarkets. The secrets to making
great rice rolls are to use the freshest ingredients, to moisten the rice paper
wrappers until they’re pliable but not too wet, and to roll the bundles tightly.
Here are some tips and tricks:
1. Soak ’em.
To make the rice paper wrappers pliable for folding, you need to soak them
one at a time for about 4 to 5 seconds until they’re soft. Although some
people simply use hot water for soaking, others believe the key to making
a rice wrap that’s pliable but doesn’t fall apart is in the mixture. If hot
water makes your wrapper fall apart, try this for your soaking mixture:
2 cups warm water
2 tablespoons sugar
1⁄4 cup cider vinegar
2. Drain the wrappers on a flat surface.
You can use your hands to take the wrappers out of the water and lay
them flat on a cutting board or plate. Don’t put them on top of each
other, though, or they’ll stick together and you’ll never get them apart.
Pat them dry. Handling rice paper wrappers can be tough, because they
tend to stick to themselves. Be patient. With a few attempts, you can get
the hang of handling them.
3. Layer the ingredients in the wrapper.
Folding rice paper wrappers can be tricky: If they’re not sticking to
themselves, the wrappers seem to be ripping in all the wrong places.
To avoid ripping, don’t overfill the softened wrappers. The easiest way
to prevent tearing is to layer the filling mixture.
4. Fold with finesse.
Check out Figure 11-3 to see how to fold these wraps.

Vietnamese Rice Wraps, or 
Summer Rolls (Goi Cuon)
Get on a summer roll. Goi cuon (pronounced goy koong) is a fresh counterpart to the
spring roll, which is fried. Summer rolls are delicious, nutritious, and gluten-free. You
can make them with the rice paper wraps I talk about in the preceding section and fill
them with raw veggies, such as romaine lettuce, carrots, cucumber, Maui onions, bean
sprouts, radish sprouts, alfalfa sprouts, mint, and basil. Some people add shiitake mush-
rooms and tofu. The meat inside these rolls can be cooked chicken, pork, shrimp, fish,
or fish cake.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Yield: 1 roll
1 sheet of rice-paper wrapper
2 peeled and cooked shrimp, cut lengthwise
and sliced
3 pieces washed and dried romaine (center
rib removed) or Boston lettuce, torn to about
the size of a deck of cards
3 fresh mint leaves
1 tablespoon radish sprouts
1 tablespoon bean sprouts
2 tablespoons rice vermicelli, soaked in warm
water until soft
5 very thin slices of cooked pork
1 Soak a single rice wrapper in hot water or in a soaking mixture (see the numbered steps
at the beginning of the “Rice rolls” section) for 4 to 5 seconds. Drain the wrapper on a
flat surface and pat it dry.
2 Layer the ingredients in the rice wrapper. For instance, lay down the shrimp and then
follow that with the lettuce, mint, radish and bean sprouts, vermicelli, and pork.
3 Fold the right side of the wrapper toward the center, and then fold the short ends over
the filling. Roll the wrapper gently — but firmly and tightly — toward the left until
you’ve formed a neat, oblong bundle. Slice each roll in half at a slight diagonal.
Vary It! For a vegetarian summer roll, substitute tofu for the shrimp and pork.
Tip: This recipe makes one wrap. If you’re going to make several wraps at once, you may
want to gather the ingredients and separate them into bowls. You can refrigerate the ingre-
dients for up to three hours before putting the wraps together.

Pork Spring Rolls
Although many spring rolls use a wheat-based wrapper, using rice wrappers works great
and makes a gluten-free version of this delicious treat. Because you fry spring rolls,
they’re not quite as healthful as the fresh summer rolls, but they’re definitely delicious.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
8 rice paper wrappers
1⁄4 pound ground pork, cooked and drained
1 cup cabbage, shredded
3 carrots, shredded
1⁄2 cup onion, diced
1 teaspoon minced garlic (about 2 cloves)
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
Salt and pepper to taste
Corn oil for frying
1 Soak the rice wrappers, one at a time, in hot water or in a soaking mixture (see the num-
bered steps at the beginning of the “Rice rolls” section) for 4 to 5 seconds. Drain the
wrappers on a flat surface and pat them dry.
2 In a large bowl, combine the pork, cabbage, carrots, onion, garlic, ginger, and salt and
pepper.
3 Drop about 2 tablespoons of the mixture into a softened wrapper. Fold the right side of
the wrapper toward the center. Fold the short ends over the filling. Roll the wrapper
gently — but firmly and tightly — toward the left until you’ve formed a neat, oblong
bundle. Place the rolls seam-side down onto wax or parchment paper until you’re ready
to cook them.
4 Heat the corn oil in a skillet over high heat to about 350 degrees. To test the oil’s temper-
ature, dip a corner of a roll into it. If the oil bubbles, it’s ready. Fry the rolls two at a time
in very hot oil until they’re golden brown, about 4 minutes.
5 Drain the cooked rolls on paper towels.
Tip: You can freeze these rolls and save them for later. To reheat, bake them in a 375-degree
oven until they’re warm, about 10 minutes.
Tip: If the rice wrapper tears while you’re preparing a roll, don’t start all over again. Just use
a second wrapper over the first one. You’ll end up with a thicker skin, which you may prefer,
anyway.

Exploring lettuce wraps
One of the coolest things about lettuce wraps — besides the cool, crisp
palate-cleansing wrap itself — is the versatility they offer gluten-free
diners. You can stuff lettuce wraps with any kind of meat, seafood, poultry,
veggie, and cheese combinations, or you can use pre-made stuffings such
as kung pao chicken, fajita filling, jambalaya, shrimp or egg salad, or well,
anything.
Here are a few things to keep in mind so your lettuce wraps can make an even
bigger hit:
 Use large, pliable leaves. Consider iceberg, red lettuce, and radicchio
leaves or large spinach leaves. Core the lettuce and soak it in ice water
for a couple of hours to help you get the leaves off the head without
tearing them.
 Dry the lettuce before serving. After you’ve removed the leaves, let them
drain individually, and then put them on a towel in the fridge for a couple
of hours to make them crisp.
 Serve the lettuce chilled. For one thing, cold lettuce leaves make a great
contrast to the warm innards you fill them with. For another, they hold
together better when they’re chilled, and they tend to collapse into limp,
lifeless leaves when they’re warm.
 Use a variety of colors, textures, and flavors in the filling. The filling
should include bold flavors and lots of varying texture and colors.
Consider using flavorful ingredients like mustards, yogurt, plum sauce,
hoisin sauce, and sesame oil in your fillings. When you’re trying to decide
what to serve, don’t forget to check out your stash of leftovers. They can
usually inspire and delight you.
 Make the fillings and sauces ahead of time. Fillings are usually
served chilled, so make them in advance and give yourself time to 
refrigerate them.
 Let your guests assemble their own wraps. People love to fill their own
lettuce wraps, so put the lettuce leaves and fillings where everyone can
reach them, and say, “Lettuce dig in!”

 Stimulating your sides
S
oups, salads, and side dishes can be just as
important as the main meal itself. In fact, they
can be the meal itself. But many soups are thick-
ened with flour, salads are often dressed up and
topped off with gluten-laden goodies, and sides are
sometimes seasoned with sauces that make them
off-limits to people enjoying a gluten-free lifestyle.
So should you just forget about creamy chowders,

from leftover food, cutting costs and helping to clear the fridge. Soups are
comforting, satisfying, and nutritious.
But commercial soups often contain flour, pasta, or other ingredients that
make them taboo. Fortunately, great-tasting gluten-free soups are easy to
make, and even creamy chowders and noodle-based soups are a breeze. And
when you make soups yourself, they’re generally more wholesome and you
get to choose what goes in them, so you’re bound to love them even more.
New England Clam Chowder
Many clam chowder recipes call for flour to thicken them, but not this one. Remember a
few key ingredients that go in a really good clam chowder. First, it’s all about the clams;
although some connoisseurs may be able to tell the difference, for the most part, it
doesn’t matter what kind you use — as long as they’re fresh, and as long as you either
use large ones or lots of them. Next is the cream: Personally, my belly bulges just think-
ing about heavy cream, but for this recipe, it’s worth it — besides, milk may curdle. And
finally, the fish stock: Some people use water for the base, but pre-made fish stock adds
a ton of flavor to this incredible chowder, so that’s what I choose to use. If you can’t find
fish stock, you can make your own with equal parts of clam juice and chicken stock.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 45 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
3 cups fish stock
1 cup dry white wine
1⁄2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 bay leaf
1⁄2 teaspoon dried parsley
8 pounds of fresh, cleaned clams 
(still in the shell)
1⁄4 pound sliced bacon, cut in 1-inch pieces
2 medium onions, chopped
11⁄2 pounds of red potatoes, peeled and diced
2 cups heavy cream
Pepper to taste
1 In a large pot, simmer the stock and the wine over medium heat. Add the thyme, bay
leaf, and parsley. Add the clams, cover the soup, and cook it until the clams open
(about 8 minutes for smaller clams and up to 15 minutes for large clams).
2 Remove the clams from the pot, take the clams out of the shells, and set the clams aside.
3 In the large pot, cook the bacon until the pieces begin to get crispy. Remove the pieces
with a slotted spoon and set them aside. Discard all the fat except a teaspoon or so.

4 Add the onion to the bacon fat, turn the heat to low, and cook the onions till they’re soft
but not brown (about 15 minutes).
5 In that same large pot, add the strained cooking liquid and the potatoes. Simmer the
soup gently until the potatoes are cooked through — about another 20 minutes or so.
6 Add the clams, bacon, and cream to the soup, and add pepper to taste.
Tip: To clean the clams, let them sit in fresh water for a few hours. Or you can rinse them
in a few changes of fresh water, letting them sit in the water a few minutes between changes.
Vary It! You’ve probably seen restaurants serve clam chowder in bread bowls and figured
those days are gone now that you’re gluten-free. Well, try this: Heat your oven to 425 degrees
and mix up a batch of Chebe bread (see the Introduction for information on Chebe). Using
ovenproof bowls as molds, press a layer of Chebe about 1⁄2-inch thick into each bowl. Bake the
bowls until the bread is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Peel the bread out of the bowl-mold
and pour clam chowder into your bread bowl. See? You can have your bowl and eat it, too.

Is chicken soup really nature’s 
remedy for the cold and flu?
More than half of the chicken soup sales in the
United States take place during the cold and flu
season. That’s because many people believe that
chicken soup has healing properties. Physician
Moses Maimonides first proposed using chicken
soup as a cold and asthma remedy in the 12th
century, and scientists have studied the thera-
peutic properties of chicken soup extensively in
recent decades. These studies indicate that sci-
entific evidence supports this belief.
Most people agree that chicken soup has some
positive effect on cold and flu symptoms, though
they disagree on why. Some say the steam
helps clear up congestion. Others say the blend
of nutrients and vitamins in chicken soup slows
the activity of certain white blood cells, reduc-
ing the pain and swelling that occurs when
these cells fight infection; this temporarily
relieves common cold and flu symptoms. And
still others claim that the spices in the soup —
garlic and pepper, for instance — thin the
mucus and make breathing easier. Nearly all
doctors agree that increasing fluid intake by
eating the soup also relieves congestion.
Whether chicken soup is really the cure for
what ails ya, chicken soup is delicious — and
easy to make. Start from scratch, or use a pre-
made chicken stock and add your favorite
ingredients, like chunks of chicken, veggies,
rice, and gluten-free noodles.

Faux Pho — Thai-Namese 
Shrimp and Chicken Soup
This soup is my simplified version of a traditional Vietnamese noodle soup called pho.
(“Faux pho” is supposed to be a play on words, except the real pronunciation of that
Vietnamese word is fuh. But it’s my dumb little joke and I’m sticking to it, so bear with me.)
Today the soup is a worldwide favorite, with many variations. My version has a Thai
influence, with the fish sauce, ginger, and curry, but the rice noodles make it Vietnamese.
Hence the name I’ve given it: “Thai-Namese.”
Tools: Dutch oven
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 cups chicken stock
8 ounces bottled clam juice
2 tablespoons fish sauce
2 teaspoons minced garlic (about 4 cloves)
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
3⁄4 teaspoon red curry paste
8 ounces mushrooms, sliced
1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
1⁄2 pound skinless boneless chicken breasts,
cut in 1-inch-square pieces
1 cup trimmed snow peas
1⁄2 cup fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons sliced green onion tops
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
13.5-ounce can light coconut milk
4 cups cooked rice noodles (slightly firm)
1 Combine the chicken stock, clam juice, fish sauce, garlic, ginger, and red curry paste
together in a large Dutch oven, stirring the ingredients with a whisk. Add the mush-
rooms, and bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat.
2 Reduce the heat and simmer the soup for 5 minutes. Add the shrimp, chicken, and snow
peas, and bring the soup to a boil. Cover the soup, reduce the heat, and simmer it for
5 minutes.
3 Stir in the lime juice, sugar, green onion tops, cilantro, and coconut milk. Cook the soup
for 4 minutes or until it’s thoroughly heated. Add the cooked rice noodles.
Tip: Figure 12-1 shows you how to peel and devein shrimp.

Many Thai ingredients are inherently gluten-free, although you do need to check
the labels, especially in Americanized products. Fish sauce is a good example.
Traditional fish sauce comes from fermented, salt-cured fish, and most fish
sauce is just that — fish. But you may occasionally find a label that shows
added wheat. Remember, you always need to read labels. Even the authentic
Asian products have English labels if they’ve been imported to the U.S.
Making Strides with Salads and Sides
Most people know that plain green salads are gluten-free — and of course,
you can have steamed or boiled vegetables — but even hard-core veggie fans
get tired of those things pretty quickly. In this section, I show you ways to
dress up delicious and nutritious veggie salads and help you make fast salad
meals a snap.

Chapter 12: Sensational Soups, Salads, and Sides
Make no bones about it
The origin of the expression to “make no bones
about it” actually has to do with soup. Today it
means to speak frankly and directly — to have
no difficulty or hesitation in saying what you
want to say. But when a version of the phrase
appeared in 1459, the author was making an
analogy to soups that didn’t have any bones in
them; diners wouldn’t hesitate to swallow the
soup, because they wouldn’t have to eat around
the bones.

But another kind of salad falls somewhere between a salad and a side. This is
the kind without any lettuce-like substances at all; instead, it features potatoes,
pasta, rice, and other alternative salad makin’s. Potato salad, for instance:
Is it a side or a salad? You think about that while I show you some ways to
snazz up your salads — sides — whatever.
Serving salads with green, leafy stuff
Veggie salads are a great way to combine interesting grains, fruits, vegetables,
and meats in one dish. As a side or a complete meal, salads are nutritious and
delicious, and they’re especially great on a hot, summer day, when they make
for a cool, quick dinner (without making you resort to cereal and milk).
Most of these salads start with a basic bed of greens or a variety of lettuce
types. Prewashed bagged greens make these salads even simpler, but of
course you can use any type of lettuce you want. Remember that the darker
the lettuce, the more nutritious it probably is.
From there, the options are endless. Here are a few of my personal favorites:
 Caesar Salad: Start with romaine lettuce and add Caesar dressing. You can
buy it or use the easy recipe in this chapter. Remember to add freshly
grated Parmesan cheese.
T Cool as a Cucumber Salad: In a medium-sized bowl, mix finely chopped
cucumber (peeled and seeded) with plain yogurt, onion powder, lemon
juice, and black pepper. Put it over a bed of greens and top it with diced
tomatoes.
 Grilled Garlic Chicken Salad: In a small bowl, mix 3⁄4 cup Italian salad
dressing with 2 teaspoons minced garlic and a dash of crushed red
pepper flakes. Add sliced red bell pepper and sliced mushrooms to the
dressing, and toss them so they’re well-coated. Fish the peppers and
mushrooms out of the dressing, setting the remaining dressing aside,
and grill the peppers and mushrooms as you grill your chicken. Place
salad greens on plates and add the grilled vegetables and chicken.
Drizzle the remaining dressing on top.
 Thai Beef Salad: Start with a bed of greens and add 1⁄4 cup mint leaves
(torn into large pieces), half a cucumber (peeled and sliced), several
thinly sliced pieces of grilled flank steak, 2 tablespoons chopped peanuts,
and lime wedges (for garnish). Top the salad with an Asian salad dressing
like the one I give later in this chapter.
198
Part III: From Menus to Meals: Recipes for the Gluten-Free Gastronome 

T Tomato and Basil Salad: Over a bed of greens, add sliced beefsteak toma-
toes topped with torn pieces of a large, fresh basil leaf. If you’d like, add
a slice of mozzarella. Then drizzle the salad with a balsamic vinaigrette
dressing.
T Warm Beet Salad: In a large saucepan, cook some green beans in boiling
water until they’re tender, about 8 minutes. Add a 16-ounce can of sliced
beets (drained), and cook them over medium heat until they’re heated
through. Drain the beans and the beets. Meanwhile, in a screw-top glass
jar, combine about 3 tablespoons orange juice, 3 tablespoons extra-virgin
olive oil, 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, 2 teaspoons minced garlic, and
a dash of white pepper. Shake the dressing well. Lay out some mixed
greens, place the beans and beets on top of them, and coat the veggies
with the dressing.
Dressing it up with dressings
Lots of commercially available salad dressings are gluten-free. People used to
think that most salad dressings were off-limits for those on a gluten-free diet,
but that was because they thought vinegar wasn’t allowed. Now that they know
vinegar (with the exception of malt vinegar) is okay, store shelves are loaded
with options. But if you’d prefer to make your own dressings — because you
like to, because doing so saves money, or because the dressing has more
wholesome ingredients that way — the recipes in this section should get you
started in the right direction.
No time for recipes? Here are a few quick and easy dressings you can toss
together for your salads:
 Roasted Red Pepper Vinaigrette: Mix chopped roasted red pepper with
white wine vinegar, minced garlic, chopped flat-leaf parsley, extra-virgin
olive oil, and salt and pepper.
 Garbanzo Vinaigrette: Mix coarsely mashed garbanzo beans (chick-
peas) with sherry vinegar, minced shallots, chopped chives and parsley,
extra-virgin olive oil, and salt and pepper.
 Lemon Parmesan Dressing: Mix fresh lemon juice and freshly grated
Parmesan cheese with mayonnaise, minced garlic, extra-virgin olive oil,
and salt and pepper.
 Pesto Vinaigrette: Mix pesto sauce with white wine vinegar, extra-virgin
olive oil, and salt and pepper.

T Asian Salad Dressing
Most commercial Asian salad dressings use soy sauce, and nearly all of them contain
wheat. Asian salad dressing is easy to make yourself, though, and to keep it gluten-free,
just use any type of gluten-free soy sauce. This dressing can also double as a marinade
for meats or tofu.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 8 servings

1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds
1⁄3 cup canola oil

Don’t fear the fat on salads
Most people are well aware that smothering their
salads in fatty salad dressings turns a healthy
meal into a high-fat, diet-sabotaging indulgence.
So they opt for fat-free salad dressings and
figure they’re making a healthy choice. But a
study published by the American Journal of
Clinical Nutrition shows that people may be com-
promising the nutritional value of their salads
when they do that, because dietary fat is neces-
sary for the absorption of nutrients from fruits and
vegetables. In the study, people who ate salads
with fat-free salad dressing absorbed far less of
the helpful nutrients and vitamins from spinach,
lettuce, tomatoes, and carrots than those who ate
their salads with a salad dressing containing fat.
Keep in mind, though, that you don’t have to get
the fat from your dressing, and you don’t have
to eat all that much fat to help with the absorp-
tion of these important nutrients. Eating just a
handful of nuts or a quarter of an avocado gives
you plenty of dietary fat to help with absorption.

Caesar Salad Dressing
Everyone loves Caesar salad, and you can make it in a number of ways. The real chefs
prepare it at the table, gently mixing one ingredient at a time. Not me. I cheat. I make it
in a blender or small food processor, and it takes less than 5 minutes to prepare. I
haven’t had a complaint yet.
Tools: Blender or food processor
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
201
Chapter 12: Sensational Soups, Salads, and Sides
1 egg
1⁄2 cup lemon juice
1⁄2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons minced garlic (about 4 cloves)
2 tablespoons gluten-free 
Worcestershire sauce
3⁄4 cup fresh Parmesan cheese
2-ounce can anchovies
1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 Place the egg in a microwaveable dish and cover it with a paper towel. Heat the egg in
the microwave on high for 10 seconds.
2 Combine the egg, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, Parmesan, anchovies,
and pepper in a blender or small food processor, and process the dressing until smooth.
If it’s too runny, add a little Parmesan cheese. If it’s too thick, add a little more lemon
juice or olive oil.

Creamy Green Anchovy 
Salad Dressing
This dressing is one of my all-time favorites. You can make this vegetarian by leaving out
the anchovies and adding a little salt instead. Add a little avocado to this for a creamy
twist. Use it on your favorite salad or greens. Because the dressing is green and creamy,
I especially like this on a colorful salad with lots of tomatoes; yellow, green, and red
peppers; and avocados.

Finishing off your salad with some fixin’s
Toss it in to mix it up. You can add lots of things to your salad to perk it up
and provide more nutrition at the same time:
 Beans and legumes: Try green beans, kidney beans, black beans, or gar-
banzo beans (chickpeas). Not only do they add flavor, but they add lots
of fiber, too.
 Bok choy: Oh boy — bok choy (Chinese white cabbage) is loaded with
nutrients, and new shredded varieties are great on salads.

 Cherry tomatoes: Several varieties of cherry tomatoes are available, and
they come in all different colors and shapes.
 Crumbled bacon: Of course, bacon adds some fat, but it also adds
flavor.
 Crumbled cheese: Be creative, using cheeses like queso seco (Mexican dry
cheese), queso fresco (fresh Mexican cheese), or freshly grated Romano
or Parmesan.
 Diced ham or turkey: A little less fatty than bacon, these meats add pro-
tein and flavor to a salad.
 Fruit: Grapes, pineapple, melons, kiwi — a variety of fruits can liven up a
salad.
 Greens: Iceberg lettuce is boring and relatively worthless nutritionally
speaking. Consider radicchio, romaine, kale, spinach, arugula, and other
greens to increase the vitamin, mineral, and fiber content — not to men-
tion flavor.
 Jicama: Somewhere between an apple and a potato, jicama (pronounced
hee-cuh-muh) adds crunch, flavor, and lots of fiber.
 Mushrooms: Buy them sliced to make preparing salads easier on yourself.
They add lots of minerals and an interesting flavor.
 Nuts: Any kind of nut will do. They add nutrients, crunch, and flavor.
 Olives: If you use chopped olives, you can spread them around the salad
and get just as much flavor without as many calories.
 Onions: Red onions and scallions are two of the most popular varieties
to put on salads. Onions and other white vegetables add nutrients, too.
 Radishes: Not only do these add a zip to your salad, but they have
potassium and vitamin C.
 Raisins: Also try similar toppings like dried cranberries.
 Raw broccoli: New packaged broccoli slaws make adding flavor and
crunch easy. Broccoli is loaded with cancer-fighting nutrients and 
calcium.
 Shredded cabbage: In the same family as broccoli, cabbage contains
nutrients that are important for cancer prevention.
 Sprouts: Loaded with fiber and nutrients, sprouts are a great addition to
any salad. And they’re easy to grow yourself. See the “Sprout ’em yourself”
sidebar for tips on growing your own sprout garden.

Getting creative with croutons
Okay, I don’t know about you, but I have some pretty specific crouton criteria.
After all, if you’re going to indulge, you may as well do it right. Personally, my
crouton criteria include crunch, flavor, and just a tinge of decadence. I mean,
broccoli just doesn’t cut it as a crouton for me; does it for you?
But croutons are usually made from bread and are therefore off-limits on the
gluten-free diet. But don’t worry — with a little creativity, you can make all
sorts of different types of croutons. Try some of these ideas:
204
Part III: From Menus to Meals: Recipes for the Gluten-Free Gastronome 
Sprout ’em yourself
Sprouts are a great source of protein, fiber, and
vitamins A, B, and C, and they’re loaded with
antioxidants. In fact, a study at John Hopkins
University found that broccoli sprouts actually
have higher levels of cancer-fighting compounds
than fresh broccoli.
You don’t even need a green thumb to grow
sprouts — just a few basic starter items, and
you can watch your sprout garden grow.
You can grow sprouts in soil, just like any other
plant, but most people grow them in jars. For
that, you need:
 A large jar
 Cheesecloth or nylon netting
 A rubber band
 1 tablespoon sprout seeds (alfalfa, radish,
mung bean, or buckwheat are good sprout
starters), available at nurseries or online
 Water
Here’s what you do:
1. Put one tablespoon seeds into the jar, cover
the seeds with water, and tighten the
cheesecloth or nylon netting over the jar
opening with a rubber band.
Let the seeds soak overnight.
2. Drain the water from the jar through the
cheesecloth. Leave the jar on a shelf, in a
cupboard, or under the kitchen sink.
If you keep the jar in the dark, the sprouts
grow white; if you expose the jar to light, the
sprouts come out green.
3. Rinse and drain the seeds once a day
or more.
This step is the most important because the
seeds need to be moist but not wet. If you
don’t rinse the seeds often enough, they
may start to mold. If you notice a bad smell
from your sprouting seeds, they’re probably
no good. Toss them and start over again.
In less than a week, the sprouts should be ready
to eat. To harvest them, just use scissors to cut
the edible sprouts away from the roots, leaving
what you don’t need. The rest keep growing,
and you can use them later.

 Barbecue potato chips: Crush these up on your salad. These are a little
lighter than a tortilla chip, but they work well, too.
 Dehydrated veggies (and fruit): Marinate the veggies in any marinade
and then dehydrate them in a dehydrator. Zucchini, sweet potatoes, and
even bananas work well (you can also buy pre-made banana chips).
 Deep-fried veggies: Take your favorite veggie — sweet potatoes work
really well for this — and dredge them in any gluten-free flour mixture
you have lying around. Deep-fry, and you have veggie croutons.
 Gluten-free homemade croutons: Use any gluten-free bread (stale bread
works best), cut the bread into cubes, and deep-fry. Then coat them with
Parmesan and seasonings. If you want a lower-fat version, put the cubes
on a baking tray and drizzle olive oil over them. Season the bread with
fresh herbs or seasoned salt and bake them in the oven.
 Polenta: Polenta is a boiled cornmeal mush that grocery stores usually
sell in plastic tubes. Dice polenta into crouton-sized pieces and deep-fry
it for a great salad topper.
 Potato croutons: Dice two potatoes and put the pieces on a baking tray
coated with nonstick spray. Then drizzle the potatoes with oil and bake
at 425 degrees for 30 minutes or until crisp and golden.
 Potato skins: Peel the innards out of potatoes and save the skins. Deep-fry
and season the skins with seasoned salt.
 Tortilla chips: Take any kind of gluten-free tortilla chip (even the fla-
vored kind) and crush them up.
Move Over, Mashed Potatoes:
Considering New Sides
Some people think side dishes on the gluten-free diet are easy, and that’s true
to some extent. Rice, corn, and potatoes do serve as staple sides for most
people new to the gluten-free lifestyle. But I say, “Move over, mashed potatoes,”
to make way for more provocative sides featuring more interesting players,
such as quinoa, millet, and beans.
One of my favorite alternative grains is quinoa (pronounced keen-wa). Called an
ancient food because it was one of three staple foods of early South American
civilization, quinoa was then — and still is — known as the Mother Grain.
Boasting nearly 20 percent protein in some varieties, quinoa has more protein
than any other grain. And it’s a complete protein, with a good balance of all
the essential amino acids. It’s also high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. I use
it in recipes for couscous (in place of couscous), tabbouleh, or just about any
other grain. See Chapter 9 for more on preparing quinoa.

T Lemon Quinoa Crunch
Crunchy, colorful, tangy, and nutritious, you can serve this dish at room temperature or
cold (I prefer cold). This food makes a great stand-alone side or salad substitute. In fact,
because quinoa contains all the amino acids your body can’t produce on its own, this
grain can be the main dish. You may want to double the recipe, because the leftovers
are fantastic — this dish gets better each day as the flavors infuse the grain.
Tools: Fine sieve
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1⁄4 cup lime juice
1⁄4 teaspoon white pepper
1⁄4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1⁄4 cup sliced marinated jalapeño pepper

3⁄4 cup sliced red bell pepper
1⁄4 cup sliced yellow bell pepper
1⁄4 cup sliced green onions, white part only
1⁄4 cup chopped Italian parsley
1⁄4 cup chopped fresh mint
Salt and pepper to taste
1 Make a vinaigrette by whisking together the lime juice, white pepper, black pepper,
jalapeño, coarse salt, and olive oil. Set the mixture aside.
2 Place the quinoa in a fine sieve and wash it under running water, rubbing it with your
hands for a few minutes. Drain the water out.
3 In a large pot, combine the water and quinoa. Bring the mixture to a boil, lower the heat,
and simmer it uncovered for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is barely tender.
Don’t overcook it. Strain the quinoa, drain it thoroughly, and let it cool. Don’t rinse it.
4 Mix the quinoa in with the cucumber, tomato, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, green
onions, parsley, mint, and vinaigrette. Add a little salt and pepper to taste (you don’t need
much, because this dish has plenty of flavor). Serve it at room temperature or cold.

Latin American Marinated 
Seafood (Ceviche)
Ceviche poses an imponderable question — is it cooked or not? Ceviche, sometimes
spelled seviche, is a delicious Latin American seafood dish that people prepare by using
an ancient method of “cooking” that uses the acid from citrus juice instead of heat. The
acid actually changes the protein structure in the fish, and you can watch the fish turn
from translucent pink to opaque white. Ceviche is usually a mixture of chunks of raw
fish, lemon and/or lime juice, chopped onion, minced garlic, and chile peppers. The fish
cooks in the citrus while flavors blend into a spectacular dish that you can serve as an
appetizer or even an entree.

3 Stir it frequently, making sure the citrus covers all the fish.
4 Serve the ceviche with heated tortillas and avocado slices or with tortilla chips for 
dipping.
Tip: You can use shrimp, scallops, or squid instead of or in addition to the fish. You can
also use any type of fish you’d like — just make sure it’s firm, like red snapper or cod.
Vary It! Get creative and add diced fruit like mangos, and serve the ceviche rolled in a
fresh, warm corn tortilla with lettuce and a little salsa, or with chips for dipping.

T Sweet-Potato Potato Salad
You may have caught my comment about potatoes being an indulgence. But sweet pota-
toes (as opposed to “regular” ones) are actually very nutritious. (By the way, sweet
potatoes are not the same as yams; if you’re in the U.S., you’re probably technically
eating sweet potatoes.) Try this simple and refreshing potato salad for a unique
Southwestern twist on an old American favorite.

because it’s a very high-glycemic-index food;
you can read more about the glycemic index in
Chapter 6), you may as well make it worth
eating. Bottom line: An unadorned baked potato
is, plain and simple, too plain and simple unless
you dress it up. Try these toppers:
 Bacon or ham pieces
 Bragg Liquid Aminos or gluten-free soy
sauce
 Broccoli tops
 Butter or margarine
 Caramelized onions
 Chili
 Chives
 Diced or shredded chicken
 Guacamole or avocado slices
 Jalapeño peppers
 Ranch salad dressing (or any of the dressings
in this chapter)
 Salsa
 Shredded cheese
 Sour cream
 Steak or barbecue sauce

H
ome-cooked dinners are one of life’s great
pleasures. But these days, many people are
so busy that cooking homemade meals is a luxury;
top that with the idea of working within the para-
meters of a gluten-free diet, and you may find
yourself stuck in the rut of fixing the same three or
four entrees each week.
Well, forget the boiled chicken and plain burger
patties, my friends! You can make anything gluten-
free, as long as you figure out how to make simple
substitutions (really, check out Chapter 9).
Oh, and speaking of simple . . . keep in mind that I’m not into recipes with
24 ingredients (many of which I’ve never heard of) and lengthy instructions
that include words in other languages. I’m all about being simple — at least
in the kitchen — but I love to eat, and taste is something I don’t scrimp on.
So in this chapter, I share with you a few of my favorite-but-simple entrees,
gluten-free style.
Making Poultry with Pizzazz
You may not realize just how versatile poultry really is. Not only do these
birds soak up flavors from marinades and rubs, providing an array of flavors
and taste experiences, but your fine (formerly feathered) friends in and of
themselves are oozing with options. White meat or dark? Breast or thigh?
Skin or no skin? Don’t underestimate the significance of these choices — to
people with a preference, white meat versus dark is an entirely different bird.

Chicken is a great source of protein as well as niacin, vitamins B-6 and B-12,
vitamin D, iron, and zinc. Ounce for ounce, skinless chicken is one of the
lowest-fat meats around. Although breast meat definitely has the lowest fat
content, even skinless dark meat is comparatively low in fat, and most of the
fat it does have is unsaturated — the good kind.
Dark meat is dark because birds use their leg and wing muscles more, so
those muscles require more oxygen. Myoglobin is an iron-containing protein
that transfers oxygen from the blood to the muscles, changing the color of
the meat — and providing you with more iron.
Spicy Chinese Game Hens
Game hens give the appearance of being fancy and ultra-gourmet, but they’re actually
simple to prepare and fairly inexpensive. Marinating game hens enhances the flavor, but
longer isn’t necessarily better (see the “Merry marinades” sidebar). More than eight
hours is overkill, because the flavor doesn’t really improve at that point. Remember to
marinate the hens in the refrigerator in a glass, ceramic, or stainless steel dish (not alu-
minum or iron).

Fowl factoids
Chicken provides you with lots of great impon-
derables: Which came first, the chicken or the
egg? Why did the chicken cross the road? Why
does everything taste like chicken? Chicken
also provides you with pretty interesting trivia.
Chew on some of these chicken tidbits:
 The average American eats more than 81
pounds of chicken each year.
 More than half of all chicken entrees
ordered in restaurants are for fried chicken
(and are therefore not usually gluten-free).
 The average hen lays 255 eggs per year.
 Eating chicken with a fork is illegal in
Gainesville, Georgia, the “Chicken Capital of
the World.”
 Chicken is safe to eat when the internal
temperature reaches 180 degrees. The
breasts are done at 170 degrees, and the
thighs take the longest to cook. Remember,
though, that meat continues to cook for a
few minutes after you take it out of the oven
or off the grill, so you may want to take it out
about three to five degrees before it
reaches your target temperature.
 The most common way to tell if poultry is
done is by the color of the juice that comes
out when you poke the chicken with a fork.
Most people think that if the juices run
clear, it’s done; if they’re pink, it’s not.
However, note that meat around the bones
may be dark pink because of bone marrow.
And purists point out that meat may remain
pink due to certain cooking methods, so
temperature is the only reliable way to
know that the meat’s done.

You can usually find game hens in the frozen section next to the turkeys. They weigh
about one to two pounds, so you can plan on half a hen per person. This recipe calls for
hoisin sauce, oyster sauce, and Asian chile sauce; you can find them in the Asian food
sections of grocery stores.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Refrigeration time: 30 minutes to 8 hours
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
213
Chapter 13: Enticing Entrees
11⁄2 teaspoons minced garlic (about 3 cloves)
3 tablespoons minced ginger
3 green onions, chopped
1⁄4 cup chopped cilantro
3⁄4 cup orange juice
1⁄4 cup lemon juice
1⁄4 cup hoisin sauce
1⁄4 cup oyster sauce
3 tablespoons sesame oil
1 tablespoon Asian chile sauce
4 game hens, cut in half
1 Preheat the grill. If you’re using a gas grill, heat it on high for 10 minutes, and then
reduce the heat to medium.
2 In a small bowl, mix the garlic, ginger, green onions, cilantro, orange juice, lemon juice,
hoisin sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and chile sauce. Set aside 1⁄2 cup of this mixture
for basting the hens; use the rest as a marinade in step 3.
3 Place the halved game hens in a shallow dish or a sealable plastic bag, and add the
marinade. Refrigerate the hens for at least 30 minutes, and up to 8 hours, turning them
occasionally.
4 Grill the game hens on a medium heat, not too close to the flame (or it could flame up and
burn), for about 10 minutes on each side, until the internal temperature is 160 degrees or
the juices run clear when you pierce the meat with a fork. Baste the hens with the mari-
nade you set aside in step 2.
Vary It! If you don’t want to grill the hens, you can roast them in a 425-degree oven for 
25 minutes.
Tip: To split game hens in half, use poultry shears to cut the hens through the breast and
backbone (see Figure 13-1). Cut the backbone out and toss it, if you’d like.

Your Basic Roasted Chicken
Few dishes are easier, more delicious, and more nutritious than your basic roasted
chicken. I like to stuff mine with any fresh herbs I happen to have growing in the kitchen
or garden (doing so makes the kitchen smell great), but you can skip that step if you’d
like. This dish is so good that you probably won’t have any leftovers, but if you do, use
them to add lots of flavor to just about anything: salads, chicken soup, enchiladas, or
stir-fry.

Ginger: Good and good for you
Some people refer to ginger as a root, but it’s
actually a rhizome, an underground stem. One
is depicted in the following figure. Most com-
monly in Indian and Asian dishes, it has a 
peppery, sweet flavor when it’s fresh. When
dried, it’s actually got a bit of a spicy kick. Ginger
is also a stimulant for the circulatory system,
and some cultures consider it an aphrodisiac.

1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2 In a small bowl, mix the onion, lemon juice, garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper, olive oil,
and sesame oil.
3 Take the sack of giblets and the neck out of the chicken and discard (or save them for
another recipe). Rinse the cavity out with cool water and pat dry.
4 Spoon about half the herb mixture into the inside of the chicken cavity. Use your hands
to rub it around and coat the inside of the chicken. Rub the rest of the mixture on the
outside of the chicken until the entire chicken is covered. Pat the chunks of onion and
herbs from the mixture onto the chicken. Some of them will probably fall off while
you’re cooking, but that’s okay.
5 Place the chicken in a roasting pan and cook it for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, until
the breast meat reaches 170 degrees or the juices run clear when you pierce the skin
with a fork.
Tip: Save the drippings. Let them cool and scrape the fat off the top. Then pour the drip-
pings into an ice tray and freeze them. You can use the cubes later for soup broth or 
seasonings.

1⁄4 cup chopped onion

2 tablespoons fresh, chopped rosemary
Salt and pepper to taste
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 large roasting chicken
Skinless or skinful? It’s really not so sinful
The skinny on skin is that although people often
think cooking chicken with the skin off is health-
ier, it actually isn’t. Calorie-wise, the meat is the
same whether you cook it with the skin on or off,
and leaving it on actually helps the chicken
retain moisture and intensifies its flavor. Of
course, you can’t eat the skin in this case. Just
cook the chicken with it on and then — if you
have the willpower — peel it off and throw it
away. The good news? Chicken skin (unless
seasoned or coated with gluten) is gluten-free,
so if you’re into indulgences, go for it!

Lemon Caper Chicken
I happen to love lemon, capers, and chicken, so this dish is definitely one of my
favorites. It’s easy to make, but it looks like you spent hours in the kitchen. The recipe
calls for rice flour for dusting the chicken, but feel free to use any gluten-free flour or
baking mix that you have lying around. (By the way, capers are a type of pickled flower
bud — look for them near the pickles in the store.)

Do you like (cooking) it low 
and slow or hot and heavy?
I’m talking about oven temperature and cooking
time. Poultry preferences vary, and although
some people like crispy, crunchy skin, others
prefer a softer skin. How the skin turns out
depends on how you cook the chicken. For a
crunchy outside, cook the chicken at a very high
oven temperature — 500 degrees works well.
After about 20 minutes, turn the oven down to
350 degrees so the meat can finish cooking
before the skin burns. If you go this route, start
the cooking process with the breast side down
so the legs and thighs get a head start cooking.
About halfway through, turn the chicken over so
the breast can brown. Lower oven tempera-
tures don’t make the outside crunchy, but the
meat stays moist and tender.
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1⁄4 cup rice flour
Salt and pepper to taste
3 green onions, chopped
1 teaspoon minced garlic (about 2 cloves)
1⁄4 cup chicken broth
1⁄2 cup dry sherry
1⁄4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
4 tablespoons capers, drained and rinsed
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 Pound the chicken breasts to an even thickness — about 1⁄2 inch is good. If you don’t have
a meat tenderizer, you can use any other heavy, manageable object, like an iron skillet.
2 Put enough olive oil into a large skillet to coat the bottom of the pan. This will probably
require about 2 tablespoons. Heat the oil over medium-high heat.
3 Dredge the chicken breasts in flour and season the chicken with salt and pepper.
4 Brown the chicken, about 3 minutes on each side. If your pan isn’t big enough, you may
need to do this in a couple of batches. Make sure you have enough oil in the pan at all
times (you’ll probably have to add another tablespoon of oil during cooking). Transfer
the chicken to a warm serving platter and cover it with foil.

5 Clean the pan to get the residual flour out, or use a new skillet. Reduce the heat to low
and add the rest of the olive oil to the skillet (you should have about 1 tablespoon left).
Add the green onion, garlic, chicken broth, sherry, lemon juice, and capers. Turn the heat
up to medium-high and simmer until the liquid has reduced to half (about 5 minutes).
6 Tilt the pan so the liquid pools on one side, and whisk in the butter until the sauce is
smooth. Pour the sauce over the chicken breasts and serve immediately.

Eating Meat
Yes, you can have your steak and eat it, too. And your pork and lamb and
ostrich and buffalo and kangaroo. Even if you’re trying to eat healthily, meat
can be part of a well-balanced diet. Red meat does have a fair amount of fat,
but it’s also a great source of protein, vitamins, and minerals, and it has no
carbohydrates. Just remember to eat it in moderation and to watch your por-
tion size — a serving of meat is three ounces cooked (four ounces before
cooking), about the size of a deck of cards.
Buying beef
If you’ve ever stood at the meat counter wondering whether you should buy
a chuck, flank, round, rib, or sirloin, you’re not alone. Adding to the confusion
are different names for the same cuts and vague labels that confuse even the
savviest of consumers. Thankfully, I have some basic guidelines to help you
make sense of the age-old question, “Where’s the beef?”
Beef grades
Prime, choice, and select grades of beef are descriptions of a cut’s leanness
and palatability and the age of the animal. Select cuts are leaner than choice
cuts, and choice cuts are leaner than prime cuts. Select cuts look less mar-
bled and aren’t as tender or juicy as choice or prime cuts.
The aged meats you usually buy in fine restaurants are prime grades. You
can find select and choice grades in the grocery store and in less expensive
restaurants — but keep in mind that select cuts are the leanest. If you like the
tenderness that comes with higher fat grades, you can learn to work around
the leanness of certain cuts with the use of marinades and simple cooking
techniques.

Beef cuts
Beef is available in many different cuts, including steaks, roasts, brisket,
stew meat, and ground beef. Tender cuts come from the ribs and loin, while
tougher cuts come from the rump and shoulder (see Figure 13-2). Table 13-1
shows how some of the cuts compare nutritionally. The cuts at the top of the
list give you the most protein per gram of fat.

Steak and Peanut Pepper Pasta
In this amazing dish, crunchy, colorful veggies mixed with some of your favorite gluten-
free pasta serve as a bed for thinly sliced steak covered in a spicy peanut sauce.
Seriously, this is one of the most delicious, unique, and impressive (shhhh . . . it’s really
very easy) dishes I’ve ever made!
Tools: Blender
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Refrigeration time: 2 hours
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
219
Chapter 13: Enticing Entrees
1⁄2 cup rice wine vinegar
1⁄2 cup olive oil
4 tablespoons gluten-free soy sauce
4 tablespoons peanut butter
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon minced garlic (about 2 cloves)
1⁄2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1 pound lean top sirloin steak
4 ounces fine gluten-free noodles
11⁄2 cups shredded cabbage
11⁄2 cups bok choy
1 cup spinach
1 cup carrots
1⁄2 cucumber, thinly sliced (for garnish)
1⁄2 yellow summer squash, halved and thinly
sliced (for garnish)
1⁄4 cup chopped peanuts
1 Preheat the grill or set the oven to broil. If you’re using a gas grill, heat on high for
10 minutes, and then reduce the heat to medium-low. If you plan to broil the steak,
move the oven rack so it’s about 5 inches from the top of the oven.
2 Combine the vinegar, oil, soy sauce, peanut butter, cilantro, garlic, and red pepper in a
blender. Cover and blend the dressing until it’s well-mixed.
3 Trim the fat from the meat. Put the steak in a shallow dish and pour about one-third of
the dressing from step 2 over the meat. Cover and marinate the meat in the refrigerator
for 2 hours, turning occasionally. Chill the remaining dressing.
4 Drain the meat, throwing away the dressing it was marinating in. Grill or broil the steak
until it’s cooked the way you like it, turning once halfway through. This should take
about 8 to 12 minutes, depending on the thickness of the meat and how you like your
steak cooked.
5 Cook the noodles according to the package directions, making sure they’re al dente
(slightly firm and not overcooked). Drain them and set them aside.
6 While the meat is cooking, combine the noodles, cabbage, bok choy, spinach, and car-
rots in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add about half of the remaining dressing to the
pasta-veggie mixture and stir until it’s well-mixed.

7 When the meat is done, slice it into thin slices across the grain. To assemble this dish,
serve the pasta-veggie mixture on each person’s plate. Put a few slices of meat on top of
the noodle mixture. Garnish the dish with a few slices of cucumber and squash. Drizzle
the remaining dressing mixture over each plate, and top with peanuts.
Tip: Instead of shredding the veggies myself, I buy a shredded broccoli-carrot-cabbage mix-
ture. You can really use any veggies you want, as long as they’re thinly shredded.

Cooking with pork
Porky the pig’s not so porky anymore. That’s because farmers these days have
changed their breeding and production methods to make the pork much leaner
and healthier. In fact, if you cut all the fat off the edges and buy a lean piece of
pork, it’s about the same as chicken in terms of calories, cholesterol, and fat.
To see where most of the cuts of pork come from, check out Figure 13-3.
Lean pork doesn’t have fat to keep it moist, so it’s especially important not to
overcook it, or it’ll get tough and dry. Pork should be cooked to about 155 or
160 degrees.
You should let meat stand for about 10 to 15 minutes before you carve it.
This is called a resting period, and it allows the juices to be redistributed so
your meat turns out moister. But the meat’s temperature continues to rise
about 5 to 10 degrees during this time, so you need to stop cooking a little
early to allow for this rise in temperature.
Here are a few ways you can tell whether pork is done:
 Use a thermometer. Stick the thermometer into the thickest part of the
cut. At 160 degrees, it’s medium-done and safe to eat.
 Prick it. If you prick it with a fork, the juice that comes out should be
clear, not pink.
 Cut it open. When you cut into the meat, it should be white. A little bit
of pink is sometimes okay.

Shredded Pork
Occasionally, recipes for shredded pork call for flour. Flour certainly isn’t necessary, as
you can see from the recipe I use. This recipe is especially easy because you put every-
thing in a slow cooker and leave it to simmer into a delicious meal. You may want to
serve this with a side of gluten-free noodles, using some of the leftover sauce to drizzle
over the pasta.
Tools: Slow cooker, at least 2.5-quart capacity
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 4 to 5 hours
Yield: 4 servings
Figure 13-3:

Chapter 13: Enticing Entrees
2 pounds boneless pork shoulder-blade roast
1 cup chicken broth
2 large onions, cut into quarters
4 jalapeño peppers, sliced
3 teaspoons minced garlic (about 6 cloves)
2 teaspoons ground coriander
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons dried, crushed oregano
Salt and pepper to taste
1 Trim the fat from the pork. Place all the meat in the slow cooker, cutting the pork roast
into pieces if it doesn’t fit. Add the chicken broth, onions, jalapeño peppers, garlic,
coriander, cumin, oregano, and salt and pepper.

2 Cover and cook the pork on the high-heat setting for 4 to 5 hours. Use a slotted spoon
to get the meat out of the liquid; discard the liquid. When the meat cools, use two forks
to shred it.
Tip: You can use shredded pork to make a variety of meals. Dress it up with condiments
and extras such as sour cream, shredded lettuce, refried beans, olives, salsa, diced toma-
toes, jalapeño peppers, spicy carrots, and guacamole, and use it for:
 Burritos
 Enchiladas
 Fajitas
 Nachos
 Tacos
 Tostadas
 Quesadillas
 Sandwiches
 Salads

9g (Dietary Fiber 3g); Protein 39g.
If you’re watching your fat intake, pork tenderloin is a good choice. Nearly
as low in saturated fat as chicken breast meat, it’s one of the leanest meats
available.

Diving into Seafood
Seafood has been an important source of protein and other nutrients in diets
around the world since, well, since people started eating. Fish and shellfish
usually contain significant amounts of zinc, which studies show is important
for thinking and memory.
Although many recipes call for coatings and breadings or pasta sides that
ruin seafood for us gluten-free types, you can easily modify the recipes so
they’re delicious and gluten-free.
People with dermatitis herpetiformis (see Chapter 3 for details on DH) some-
times need to eliminate iodine from their diets as well as gluten. Iodine is
commonly found in shellfish, among other things.
223
Chapter 13: Enticing Entrees
Merry marinades
Besides adding flavor, acidic marinades also
tenderize foods. The enzymes in the acids break
down the muscle and connective proteins in the
meat, making the meat less tough. Here are
some tips for marinating:
 Refrigerate meat to avoid the growth of
harmful bacteria. The temperature at which
you marinate doesn’t affect the meat’s ten-
derness. The enzymes break down proteins
only at temperatures between 140 and 175
degrees, so leaving the meat at room tem-
perature serves no purpose.
 Poultry and fish can turn to mush or become
tough if you marinate them too long. Poultry
does well when marinated up to four hours,
and about 30 minutes is a good amount of
time to marinate seafood.
 Natural tenderizers include pineapple, figs,
papaya, kiwi, mango, honeydew, wine, citrus,
vinegar, tomato, yogurt, and buttermilk.
 Be careful with what kind of container you
use. Don’t use aluminum containers — only
glass, ceramic, stainless steel, or plastic.
When you marinate in metals other than
stainless steel, the metal and the acidic
marinade produce a chemical reaction.
 Never reuse a marinade. If you’re going to
use some of the marinade for a sauce, take
out the amount you need and set it aside
before you marinate the meat or seafood.
After you’ve marinated food in a marinade,
throw the marinade away.

Tequila-Lime Shrimp and Scallops
People usually eat this dish wrapped in flour tortillas — but my family doesn’t. Substitute
corn tortillas as a wrap, or spoon the shrimp and scallops over rice (I prefer brown rice
over white) or your favorite gluten-free pasta.
Preparation time: 2 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
224
Part III: From Menus to Meals: Recipes for the Gluten-Free Gastronome 
1 pound medium shrimp, cooked, peeled, and
deveined
1⁄2 pound sea scallops
1⁄4 cup lime juice
1⁄4 cup lemon juice
1⁄4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1⁄4 cup tequila
2 teaspoons minced garlic (about 4 cloves)
2 teaspoons hot sauce
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cumin
1⁄2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 large onion, cut into thin wedges
1 green bell pepper, cut into bite-sized strips
1 red bell pepper, cut into bite-sized strips
4 lime wedges (for garnish)
1 If your shrimp or scallops are frozen, thaw and rinse them. If the scallops are as large as
an egg or larger, cut them in half and set them aside.
2 In a large glass, ceramic, or stainless steel mixing bowl, stir together the lime juice,
lemon juice, cilantro, 1 tablespoon oil, tequila, garlic, hot sauce, cumin, and oregano.
Add the shrimp and scallops.
3 In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the onion, green bell pepper, and red bell
pepper in the remaining tablespoon of oil until they begin to get soft, about 4 minutes.
4 Add the shrimp-scallop mixture to the skillet, and bring everything to a boil. Cook and
stir the mixture for about 3 minutes, until some of the liquid has burned off and the
scallops are cooked.
5 Serve the seafood over rice, pasta, or in the wrap of your choice, and garnish it with
lime wedges.

Chapter 13: Enticing Entrees
1 large orange
1 pound large scallops
2 tablespoons wheat-free soy sauce or Bragg
Liquid Aminos
2 tablespoons dry sherry
5 green onions, cut into 1-inch pieces
1⁄2 cup sliced red pepper
1 teaspoon minced ginger
2 1⁄2 teaspoons cornstarch
3⁄4 teaspoon sugar
1⁄2 cup orange juice
1⁄4 cup salad oil, divided
1⁄2 teaspoon (or to taste) crushed red pepper
1 Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.
2 Use a vegetable peeler or sharp knife to cut the peel from the orange in 1-inch-wide
pieces, being careful not to cut into the white part of the peel. Cut the pieces into strips
about 2 inches long, and put them on a small cookie sheet. Bake them in the 200-degree
oven for about 30 minutes to dry them out.
3 In a medium bowl, mix the scallops, soy sauce (or Liquid Aminos), sherry, green onions,
red pepper, and ginger. Cover and refrigerate the mixture for an hour or so.
4 In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch, sugar, and orange juice. Cover and refrigerate this
mixture for about an hour.
5 When you’re almost ready to serve the meal, heat half the oil (1⁄8 cup or 2 tablespoons)
in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir-fry the orange peels until they’re crisp and the
edges are slightly browned, about 2 minutes. Drain the peels on paper towels.
6 Turn that same skillet to high. Use the remaining oil to stir-fry the scallop mixture until
the scallops are cooked through, about 5 minutes. Stir the orange-juice mixture and
then add it to the scallops, and stir-fry the mixture until the sauce is slightly thick and 
it coats the scallops.
7 Spoon the scallop mixture onto a serving platter, and sprinkle it with the orange peels.

Exploring Vegetarian Entrees
Typically, the vegetarian diet relies heavily on pasta, breads, pilafs, various
forms of wheat, and meat replacements — all of which are usually loaded

T Fresh Harvest Penne
This easy-to-prepare one-dish vegetarian meal is a great way to use fresh veggies you’ve
grown or bought from a farmers’ market. If you can’t find gluten-free penne, use another
type of gluten-free pasta. Several varieties are available, and all are delicious.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
227
Chapter 13: Enticing Entrees
16-ounce package gluten-free penne (or any
cut) pasta
2 tablespoons olive oil
1⁄2 medium red onion, diced
3⁄4 cup thickly sliced zucchini
3⁄4 cup thickly sliced yellow squash
1 tablespoon minced garlic (about 6 cloves)
1 cup 1⁄2-inch eggplant cubes
2 medium tomatoes, diced
1⁄3 cup fresh basil, chopped
1⁄3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 Cook the pasta as directed, being careful not to overcook it.
2 In a large frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, zucchini, and
squash to the frying pan, and sauté, stirring often, for about 5 minutes.
3 Add the garlic and eggplant to the pan, and continue stirring frequently.
4 When the eggplant begins to get soft, after about 5 minutes, reduce the heat to low and
add the tomato. Continue stirring the mixture for 3 to 4 minutes.
5 Drain the pasta. In a large serving bowl, combine the pasta, vegetables, basil, and
Parmesan cheese.

with gluten. But plenty of dishes are naturally gluten-free and vegetarian or
vegan; and you can easily convert plenty more. Best of all, these vegetarian
dishes are so delicious that even die-hard carnivores love them.

T Vegan Lasagne
This dish is easy to make and a hit with guests, who may never have a clue that what
they’re eating is gluten-free. Be sure to double the recipe and freeze a pan of lasagne for
later. When you’re ready, take it directly from the freezer to a 350-degree oven, and heat
it for an hour and a half, uncovering it 15 minutes before it’s done. This lasagne is even
better the next day as leftovers! If you can’t find the rice cheeses, you can substitute
regular dairy cheeses for a vegetarian (but not vegan) lasagne.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour, 30 minutes
Yield: 10 servings

1⁄2 cup rice cream cheese
1⁄2 cup rice mozzarella
1⁄2 cup rice Parmesan
2 24-ounce jars pasta sauce
1⁄4 cup fresh chopped basil
1 teaspoon onion powder
1⁄4 teaspoon white pepper
Sea salt to taste
1⁄2 cup chopped spinach
1⁄2 cup diced zucchini
1⁄4 cup sliced black olives
1⁄4 cup sliced mushrooms
1⁄4 cup chopped onions
1 tablespoon Bragg Liquid Aminos
Nonstick spray
10-ounce package of gluten-free lasagna
noodles, uncooked
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 In a large mixing bowl, combine the rice cream cheese, mozzarella, and Parmesan. In a
medium bowl, mix together the pasta sauce, basil, onion powder, pepper, and salt. Set
aside both mixtures.
3 Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the spinach, zucchini, olives, mush-
rooms, and onions in Bragg Liquid Aminos for 4 minutes or until the onions begin to
soften. Don’t overcook (remember, the veggies will still cook when the lasagne bakes).
Set this mixture aside.
4 Spray a shallow 9- by 13-inch baking dish with nonstick spray. In the baking dish, layer
the lasagne as follows:
Place one-third of the sauce on the bottom of the dish, followed by a layer of uncooked
noodles (just enough to cover the sauce), half the cheese mixture, and half the veg-
etable mixture. Repeat this layering process with the another third of the sauce,
another layer of noodles, most of the remaining cheese, and the rest of the vegetables.
Finish with the last third of sauce on the top.
5 Top the lasagne with a thin layer of mozzarella and Parmesan.
6 Cover the lasagne with aluminum foil and bake it for 1 hour. Remove the foil and bake
the lasagne 30 minutes longer or until its top is golden brown. Cool the lasagne for at
least 15 minutes before cutting into it.

Tip:Be creative and use whatever veggies and other “stuffing” ingredients you like.
Tip: If your sauce isn’t flavorful enough, try adding a teaspoon of minced garlic.

T Black Bean Veggie Burgers
Gluten-free veggie burgers are hard to find — so why not make your own? These are
made from black beans, but you can use a combination of beans and even add grains
like millet and buckwheat. Wrap one of these burgers in a lettuce bun, top it with salsa
and guacamole, and you have a delicious, nutritious vegetarian meal.
Tools: Food processor or blender
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 8 servings

Chapter 13: Enticing Entrees
3 pounds cooked black beans, rinsed and
drained
1⁄4 cup diced onion
1⁄2 cup diced red bell pepper
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon cumin
1⁄4 cup egg substitute
1 cup cooked quinoa
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
8 crisp, cold lettuce leaves
Salsa and guacamole (if desired)
1 Put the beans, onion, bell pepper, cayenne, cumin, egg substitute, quinoa, and cilantro
into a food processor or blender. Process the mixture until it has a consistency that you
can mold into patties.
2 Shape the mixture into eight patties.
3 Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add as many patties
as will fit in the skillet, and fry them for two minutes per side, turning once. Add the
remaining tablespoon of oil and cook the remaining patties.

T Cheese Enchiladas
You have to be careful with enchiladas, because many store-bought or restaurant-
prepared enchilada sauces have flour in them. You can dress up this quick and easy
recipe with your favorite veggies, other types of cheese (my favorite is queso seco), salsas,
sour cream, or meat (such as the shredded pork from the recipe earlier in this chapter).
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 6 servings
230
Part III: From Menus to Meals: Recipes for the Gluten-Free Gastronome 
2 cups grated cheddar cheese
2 cups grated Monterey Jack cheese
1 teaspoon garlic powder
3 teaspoons cumin, divided
3 tablespoons cooking oil, divided
1 small white onion, finely minced
2 teaspoons minced garlic (about 4 cloves)
4 cups tomato sauce
3 tablespoons chili powder
1 teaspoon oregano
2 teaspoons hot sauce
Nonstick spray
12 corn tortillas
1⁄4 cup sliced black olives
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 Combine the cheddar, Monterey Jack, garlic powder, and 2 teaspoons of the cumin; set
the mixture aside.
3 To make the enchilada sauce, heat 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil in a large skillet over
medium-high heat. Add the minced onion and garlic, and sauté them until they’re soft,
about 4 minutes. Add the tomato sauce, chili powder, oregano, hot sauce, and the
remaining teaspoon of cumin. Cover the sauce and simmer it for about 30 minutes.
4 When the sauce is finished, spray a 9- by 13-inch baking dish with nonstick spray, and
then pour about 2⁄3 cup of the sauce into it. Set aside the remaining enchilada sauce for
step 6.
5 In a small skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of cooking oil (or enough oil to gen-
erously cover the bottom of the pan) over medium-high heat.
6 Briefly dip one corn tortilla into the hot oil to soften it (about 5 seconds), making sure
both sides get coated, and then dip it in the enchilada sauce, coating both sides. Lay
the tortilla flat on a plate or cutting board, and put about 1⁄3 cup of the cheese mixture
down the center of the tortilla (lengthwise). Roll up the tortilla, and put it seam-side
down into the baking dish.

7 Repeat steps 5 and 6 for each enchilada, laying the enchiladas side by side in the baking
dish. Pour the rest of the enchilada sauce over the rolled-up enchiladas, and sprinkle
any remaining cheese mixture over them. Add the sliced black olives on top of the
cheese.
8 Bake the enchiladas for 20 to 30 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

eing gluten-free doesn’t mean you have to
pine for pizza and balk at breads. In fact, some
of the gluten-free versions of pizza and pasta — and
yes, breads — are even better than the real deal.
Can you grind your own flours and press your own
pasta? Sure, grind away! But you don’t have to.
These recipes are simple enough for a beginner to
master, and they may even have those gluttons for
gluten coming back for more.
Pizza with Pizzazz
When I first describe the gluten-free diet to people, they react with emotion
somewhere between disdain and horror. Usually I’m still talking, chirping the
praises of the gluten-free lifestyle, when they interrupt me, unable to hide the
shock in their voices: “You mean you can’t eat pizza?”
The good news is that you can eat pizza. Maybe not of the fast-food variety,
but gluten-free pizza is delicious nonetheless. And you never have to tip a
driver.

T Basic Pizza Crust
I like to double or even triple the recipe for pizza crust and then freeze what I’m not
going to use. I love being able to pull a crust out of the freezer, let it defrost for 10 min-
utes, top it, and pop it in the oven. Easy as pizza pie!

Crust: The pizza foundation
The secret of a good pizza isn’t in the sauce; the sauce is really just squashed
tomatoes with spices. It isn’t in the toppings; those are just a euphemism for
leftovers. No, the secret to any great pizza is undeniably in the crust.
I believe in using mixes or even pre-made crusts for my gluten-free pizzas, espe-
cially because these days they’re so good. But this is the recipe section of this
book, and my editors claim that simply saying “take pre-made pizza crust out
of package” isn’t good material. So I’m including the pizza crust recipe I’d use if
no one had invented those great-tasting gluten-free mixes and pre-made crusts.

The passion for pizza goes way back
I know that Chicagoans and New Yorkers can
argue for hours about who makes the best
pizza. And I even know that some of them laugh
at us Californians who have supposedly dis-
graced America’s favorite food by topping it
with froufrou toppings like feta cheese and
sushi. But pizza has evolved over the centuries,
and it was around long before Chicago and New
York showed up on the map.
The credit for pizza really goes to ancient
Middle Eastern cultures that made flat, unleav-
ened bread in mud ovens. Pizza took the form
you’re most familiar with in Naples, Italy, where
peasants in the Middle Ages made a seasoned
flatbread and covered it with cheese.
The mass appeal of the tomato-mozzarella
cheese combination is thanks to a Neapolitan
baker named Rafaele Esposito. In 1889, Esposito
made a special pizza for the visiting King
Umberto I and Queen Margherita. He decorated
the pizza to look like the Italian flag, with red
tomatoes, white mozzarella cheese, and green
basil leaves as toppings. The pizza was a hit,
and of course, naming the pizza after the queen
didn’t hurt its popularity; Pizza Margherita is still
an Italian favorite.

Chapter 14: Pizza, Pasta, and Bread: Foods You Thought Were a Thing of the Past
1 cup sorghum flour
1 cup tapioca flour
1⁄2 cup bean flour
1⁄2 cup rice flour
1 tablespoon xanthan gum
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
1⁄3 teaspoon garlic salt
1⁄3 teaspoon oregano
11⁄4 cup warm milk
1 teaspoon cider vinegar
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons olive oil
A fistful of rice, bean, tapioca, or sorghum
flour to keep the dough from sticking
1 In a large bowl, mix the sorghum flour, tapioca flour, bean flour, rice flour, xanthan gum,
salt, yeast, sugar, garlic salt, and oregano. Then add the milk, vinegar, egg, and olive oil.
2 Use an electric mixer or bread machine to knead the mixture for about 3 minutes, until
the dough is soft and thick. Roll the dough into a ball.
3 Sprinkle some rice, bean, tapioca, or sorghum flour on a cutting board, and put the
dough ball on top. Use your hands or a rolling pin to flatten the dough to the thickness
that you like your crust. Add as much flour as you need to keep the dough from sticking
to the rolling pin and the cutting board.
4 Leave the dough in a warm place to rise for about 1 hour.
5 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
6 Spread the dough onto a nonstick pizza pan. The diameter of the pizza depends on how
thick you make your crust. Use your fingers to pinch the edge and make a lip around
the outside of the crust. Add the sauce and toppings to the crust, and bake the pizza at
425 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes or until the cheese is melted.

Using a pizza stone
Nothing’s worse than soggy pizza, and using a
pizza stone is the best way to get a crispy crust.
To use a pizza stone, heat it in a 425-degree oven
for about an hour before you want to cook your
pizza. Then coat the stone with cornmeal and
transfer the crust to the stone (if you’re following
a recipe that calls for letting the crust rise, let it
rise on a separate pan before moving it to the
stone). Cook the crust on the stone, add the top-
pings, and cook the pizza again.
Important: Don’t use oil on a pizza stone,
because the high temperatures can cause the
oil to catch on fire. Equally as important: If you
cook gluten-containing pizzas and gluten-free
pizzas, don’t share stones; they can absorb the
flour and contaminate your gluten-free pizza.

Pizza sauces
I’m gonna let you in on a couple of secrets. First, just about any commercial
pizza sauce is gluten-free (of course, you still need to check the ingredients to
be sure). Second, pizza sauce can be as simple as a little brushed-on olive oil
or chile oil. But if you like to get fancy, and if you like to make your own, feel
free. I offer a couple of simple recipes to get you started.
Use sauces and condiments you already have in your kitchen for sauces on
your pizza: gluten-free teriyaki sauce, Cholula, Dijon mustard, hoisin sauce,
taco sauce, ranch dressing, or barbecue sauce.

Traditionalists lean toward this type of a sauce, because, well, it’s traditional.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: Enough for one 12-inch pizza

2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon minced fresh garlic (about
2 cloves)
1⁄4 cup finely chopped onion
2 cups chopped or diced tomatoes (including
the juice)
1 teaspoon fresh oregano
2 tablespoons fresh minced basil
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon black pepper
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1 In a medium saucepan, cook the onions and garlic in the olive oil over medium-high
heat until they’re tender (about 3 minutes).
2 Add the tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper to the pan, and continue cooking the
sauce over medium heat for a few more minutes.
3 Stir in the tomato paste. Simmer the sauce on low heat for about 10 minutes.

T Alfredo Sauce
This sauce is a great twist on an old favorite, and it makes a white pizza instead of a red
one. It’s basically the same type of cheesy, creamy Alfredo sauce you’d use on pasta —
in fact, if you’re feeling adventurous, feel free to use it on your pasta!

1 Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
2 Add the garlic and sauté it for 2 or 3 minutes, stirring constantly. While you’re sautéing,
sprinkle a little salt on the garlic, which brings out some of the moisture and prevents
burning.
3 Stir in the Parmesan, cream, salt, and pepper. Heat the sauce for about 5 minutes, stir-
ring constantly.
4 Remove the saucepan from the heat. Let the sauce cool for 5 minutes before putting it

Pizzas beyond cheese and pepperoni
For purists, adding anything to a pizza besides sauce and cheese is to sully a
time-honored classic. For others, it’s a chance to flaunt their creative or
adventuresome sides. If you’re a flaunter, read on.

MYOP (make your own pizza) parties
Rarely can an entire group agree on what
should go on a pizza. So why not let everyone
have exactly what he or she wants by turning
the event into a party? That’s what an MYOP
party is all about. Here’s how you do it:
1. Make several batches of gluten-free pizza
dough.
2. Roll up balls that, when flattened, will each
be the right size for an individual-sized
pizza (the balls should be about the size of
a baseball).
3. Put out toppings — lots of them — in sep-
arate serving bowls.
Put sauce in one, different types of cheeses
in others, pepperoni in another, mushrooms,
pineapple, anchovies (yum!) in others, and
so on.
4. Give each guest a dough ball and let him or
her roll it out to the desired thickness.
Have everyone mark the crust, using a
toothpick, with his or her initials or some-
thing else that distinguishes one crust from
another.
5. Prebake the crusts and give them back to
the rightful owners for sauce and toppings.
6. Bake the pizzas until the cheese has
melted and the crust is golden brown.
Of course, MYOP parties are about the messi-
est type of party you can throw, with flour and
dough flying. And you always have the ubiqui-
tous show-off who just has to prove he can toss
the dough like the real pizza-makers do. Be pre-
pared to clean up afterwards. Know also that
these parties always incite friendly-but-com-
petitive cases of “my pizza’s gonna be better
than yours.” If you invite competitive friends,
consider yourself forewarned!

Sauceless Inside-Out Seafood Pizza

Pizza Pockets (Calzones)
When our kids were little, TV ads sang the praises of pizza pockets that looked like an
Americanized version of a calzone — and looked, I might add, sinfully scrumptious and
glutenous. But where there’s a will, there’s a way, and using the “Basic Pizza Crust”
recipe earlier in this chapter, my kids and I created our own gluten-free version of this
tasty junk-food meal and sang our own theme song. You can use any pizza dough recipe
you’d like. Just make enough dough for two 12-inch pizzas (see Chapter 9 for ideas on
which mixes to use). Calzones are great dipped in your favorite pasta sauce, and you
know how kids love to dip!

1 recipe “Basic Pizza Crust” dough, uncooked
About 1⁄4 cup rice, sorghum, bean, or tapioca
flour
Nonstick spray
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup shredded Romano cheese
1 cup pepperoni slices
1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2 Divide the dough into four equal parts, and roll each one into a ball. Cover the balls
with a paper towel that you’ve dampened with warm water, and set the dough in a
warm area for 20 minutes.
3 Spread some flour on a cutting board and on a rolling pin, and roll each dough ball flat
so that it’s about 3⁄4-inch thick. Trim the edges so it’s in an oval shape.
4 Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and spray it with nonstick spray. Put each of the
ovals onto the lined baking sheet. Using your fingernail, a toothpick, or a knife, lightly
draw a line across each oval, dividing it in half crosswise.
5 Put 1⁄4 cup mozzarella, 1⁄4 cup Romano, and 1⁄4 cup pepperoni on one of the halves of each
oval, leaving about 1⁄2 inch of dough along the edges.
6 Fold over the other half of the dough (the half with nothing on it) so it’s lying on top of
the filling. Using your fingers, gently crimp the edges of the dough together.
7 Bake all four pockets in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until they begin to turn golden
brown, or until melted cheese begins to ooze out.

T Mexican Pizza
This version of Mexican pizza is vegetarian, but if you like meat, just add crumbled,
cooked ground beef.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
2 12-inch pizza crusts (see the “Basic Pizza
Crust” recipe)
16-ounce can refried beans
2 large green onions, thinly sliced
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1⁄2 cup sliced black olives, drained
4-ounce can diced green chilies
1⁄4 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons fresh chopped cilantro
1 cup chopped fresh tomato
1 cup shredded lettuce
1⁄4 cup sliced jalapeño peppers
1 cup salsa
1 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
2 Bake the crusts for 8 minutes, or until they just begin to turn golden brown.
3 Divide all the ingredients in half. Spread 8 ounces of refried beans on each crust. If it’s too
hard to spread, mix about 2 tablespoons of salsa into the beans to help thin it out a little.
4 On top of the beans, add one chopped green onion, 1⁄2 cup cheddar, 1⁄2 cup Monterey
Jack, 1⁄4 cup black olives, and 2 ounces green chilies on each pizza.
5 Bake the pizzas for 15 to 20 minutes or until the cheese begins to bubble.

No More Pining for Pasta
Whining about gluten-free pastas was once completely acceptable. They used
to be gritty, heavy on the (insert flour flavor here) flavor, and they went from
being al dente to all-mush in a millisecond.
But gluten-free pasta has come a long way, baby. In fact, even the most dis-
cerning pasta aficionados appreciate the taste, texture, variety of shapes and
sizes, nutritional value, and cookability of today’s gluten-free pastas.

Although these pastas are great with just a little olive oil or butter, you can
also turn just about any pasta recipe into a great gluten-free dish simply by
replacing traditional pasta with a gluten-free variety. Here are a few examples.
T Three-Bean Pasta
A colorful and delicious dish, the “Three-Bean Pasta” is best with the widest noodles
you can find. If you can’t find wide gluten-free pastas, break a lasagna noodle into 1⁄2-inch
pieces. Each noodle should be as long as the width of the lasagna noodle.

Sweet and Tangy Noodles 
with Peanuts (Pad Thai)
Cheating on this dish is way easier than making it from scratch. You can buy pad thai
kits, complete with noodles and sauce, or at least use one of the prepared pad thai
sauces available at most grocery stores and just about any Asian market. But if you’re a
purist and want to make the entire dish yourself, I tell you how here. Tamarind, which

makes foods taste sour and is a natural preservative, is a critical ingredient in the
sauce. Finding a replacement for tamarind is hard, so stock up if you plan to do much
Thai cooking.
Tools: Wok or large nonstick skillet
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
243
Chapter 14: Pizza, Pasta, and Bread: Foods You Thought Were a Thing of the Past
8 ounces rice stick noodles
2 teaspoons tamarind concentrate
5 teaspoons water
2 teaspoons cooking oil
5 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 tablespoons chopped shallots
1⁄2 cup diced firm tofu
1⁄4 cup fish sauce
1⁄4 cup sugar
1⁄4 cup chopped chives
3⁄4 cup broken up roasted peanuts
1 cup fresh cooked shrimp
1 egg, beaten
1 cup bean sprouts
1 Soak the rice sticks according to the package directions so they’re pliable but not
mushy. Mix the tamarind concentrate and the water to make a tamarind juice, and set it
aside for step 3.
2 Heat the cooking oil in a wok over medium-high heat. When the oil’s hot, add the garlic,
shallots, and tofu. Stirring constantly, cook them until the garlic and shallots begin to
turn opaque, about 5 minutes.
3 Add the tamarind juice (from step 1), fish sauce, sugar, chives, and peanuts to the wok
and stir-fry for 2 minutes to mix the ingredients. Add the shrimp and noodles, and stir-
fry the mixture until the noodles are well coated with the sauce, about 2 minutes.
4 Scoop the noodle mixture to one side of the wok; slowly add the beaten egg to the other
side, drizzling it into the hot wok to make a fine ribbon of cooked egg. Blend the egg and
the noodle mixture together.
5 Add the sprouts, and cook the noodle dish for another 30 seconds or so.
Tip: You can add dried shrimp, available at most Asian markets, as a garnish. Another
common garnish for pad thai uses 1⁄2 cup uncooked bean sprouts, 1⁄2 cup chopped chives,
and 1⁄2 cup coarsely ground roasted peanuts marinated in a tablespoon of lime juice, a tea-
spoon of tamarind concentrate, 21⁄2 teaspoons of water, and a tablespoon of fish sauce.
Sprinkle the mixture on the cooked pad thai and place several lime segments and sliced
cucumbers around the serving platter.

Making Bread
Gluten-free bread has a reputation. And for years, it was well-deserved. But if
any food deserves to win in the “most improved” category in the gluten-free
foods’ world, it’s definitely bread. Thanks to some dedicated cookbook
authors, bread has evolved from being, well, tasteless and brick-like to being
light, doughy, and flavorful.
Best of all, the real cooks have done an incredible job of combining interest-
ing, alternative flours that not only improve the flavor and texture but add
nutrients as well. Now that gluten-free bread actually tastes good, it’s supe-
rior in many ways to that gummy white “enriched” gluten-containing stuff
that has more chemicals than a high school chemistry lab.
Although I’m admittedly not a Real Cookbook Author, and I’m really not
patient enough to concoct complex baked goods that require a tender touch,
I have experimented enough to come up with some simple bread recipes I
share with you in this section. For some bread-making tips and tricks, check
out Chapter 9.
Of course, if you’d rather not have to buy and measure all the recipe ingredi-
ents that go into bread, don’t sweat it. Lots of excellent bread mixes are
available. Just toss a mix in your bread machine, add a few ingredients, and
turn it on.

“This is bread?”
I remember my first experience with gluten-free
bread. In fact, I remember it vividly, like a bad
nightmare that won’t go away. My then-toddler
son had recently been diagnosed with celiac
disease, and I was more than just a little anx-
ious about feeding him without poisoning him.
This was, mind you, back in the 1900s — 1991, to
be exact — and gluten-free products were
scarce.
I was relieved and downright giddy to discover, in
the bowels of a freezer box at what was then the
only health food store within a 50-mile radius, a
loaf of gluten-free bread. Screeching with delight,
right there in the store, I pulled out a piece of the
bread, chirping, “Tyler, you can eat this!” Before
it made it out of the flimsy plastic bag, though, the
bread-like substance began to crumble . . . and
crumble some more. Somehow, I maintained my
enthusiasm — albeit waning now — and low-
ered myself to my toddler son, eager to share with
him the newfound treasure that was now nothing
but a fistful of dry, tasteless crumbs. “Mommy,”
he said with sincere confusion, “this is bread?”

T Simple White Bread 
for Bread Machines
A simple white bread can go a long way. After all, everyone knows that bread is really
just an instrument to allow you the pleasure of consuming an entire stick of butter with-
out raising eyebrows. Simplify your life by using 31⁄4 cups of premixed gluten-free flour
mixtures (I list some in Chapter 9) in place of the flours in this recipe and a bread
machine to mix the dough and bake the bread. I like this particular recipe because the
variety of flours enhances the taste, texture, and nutritional value.
Tools: Bread machine
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 2 to 3.5 hours (depending on your bread machine)
Yield: 6 servings (one 11⁄2 pound loaf)
245
Chapter 14: Pizza, Pasta, and Bread: Foods You Thought Were a Thing of the Past
1⁄2 cup tapioca flour
1⁄4 cup millet flour
1⁄2 cup sorghum flour
1 cup white rice flour
1 cup brown rice flour
1 egg
1⁄2 cup egg whites (about 4 or 5 egg whites)
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1⁄4 cup canola oil
1⁄4 cup honey
2 cups warm milk
3 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon xanthan gum
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 Put the tapioca flour, millet flour, sorghum flour, white rice flour, brown rice flour, egg,
egg whites, vinegar, oil, honey, milk, butter, gelatin, salt, xanthan gum, and yeast into
the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Make sure you add
the yeast last, on top of all the other ingredients. Select the cycle for homemade breads.
If your machine has the option of doing only one kneading and one rising cycle, choose
that option (though letting the bread go through two kneadings doesn’t hurt the bread).
2 After a few minutes of kneading, check on the dough. Scrape the flour off the sides of
the tub and into the dough so it can mix thoroughly. Make sure the consistency is just a
little thicker than a cake batter. If it’s too thick, add more milk. If it’s too runny, add a
little rice flour.
3 When the bread is finished, let it cool for a few minutes and remove it from the pan.

T Flour Tortillas
I prefer corn tortillas to flour ones, but some people yearn for flour tortillas. This recipe
is actually really good!
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings 
246
Part III: From Menus to Meals: Recipes for the Gluten-Free Gastronome 
2 cups gluten-free flour mixture
2 teaspoons xanthan gum
1 teaspoon sugar
11⁄4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 tablespoons shortening
1 cup warm water
1 Heat a cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.
2 In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour mixture, xanthan gum, sugar, salt, and baking
powder. Cut in the shortening using a pastry blender, fork, or two knives.
3 Add the warm water slowly, stirring after each addition, until the dough is smooth.
Form it into balls about the size of tennis balls.
4 Put the dough between two sheets of wax paper. Using a rolling pin, flatten the dough
balls, one at a time, until they’re about 1⁄8-inch thick. They should be about 10 to 12 inches
in diameter.
5 Remove the wax paper. Cook the tortillas on the hot iron skillet or griddle for about
45 seconds, until the cooked side has brown flecks; the tortilla may begin to bubble.
Turn each tortilla once. The second side cooks quickly, in about 20 seconds. Peek
underneath the tortilla to see whether it has brown flecks, a sign that it’s done.

not doing the dishes. It is, of course, dessert. If
you think the gluten-free lifestyle means having
to deprive yourself of decadence and indulgence,
this chapter surely proves you wrong.
Now if your idea of dessert is a bowl of sliced
strawberries with raisins on top (for a splurge),
that’s cool. I’ve put together some healthful
recipes in this chapter to satisfy your wholesome-
and-healthy sweet tooth, as well as some recipes
for delicious desserts that pack and travel well
for when you’re gluten-free and on the go. But
if you’re the more decadent type, you may be
delighted to find recipes in this chapter for cakes, cookies, fudge, and other
gluten-free indulgences.
Daring to Be Decadent: 
Gluten-Free Indulgences
Yes, you can have your cake and eat it, too. As long as it’s gluten-free! I’m big
into indulgences; I mean, if you’re going to live it up from time to time, you
may as well really satisfy that craving and get it out of your system. Plenty of

Dessert is the course that comes after the main course — of course. And in
most cultures, dessert is comprised of sweet, decadent foods. But in many
cultures, dessert isn’t sweet at all but is simply a course consisting of very
strong flavors, like cheeses. The word comes from the Old French desservir,
which means “to clear the table.”
T Flourless Chocolate Cake
One of the most incredible desserts on the planet, this flourless chocolate cake is rich,
dense, moist, and surprisingly easy to prepare. It requires very few ingredients, none of
which are specialty items. Prepare to be amazed.
Tools: 9-inch springform pan
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 50 minutes
Yield: 8 servings

Part III: From Menus to Meals: Recipes for the Gluten-Free Gastronome 
Nonstick spray
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter
8-ounce bag semisweet chocolate chips
(about 11⁄2 cups)
6 large eggs
1 cup sugar
1 Preheat the oven to 275 degrees. Spray a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick spray.
Don’t know what a springform pan looks like? See Figure 15-1.
2 Put the butter and chocolate chips in a large microwaveable bowl. Microwave the choco-
late and butter in 10-second intervals until they’re melted, stirring after each interval.
3 Separate the egg whites and egg yolks, putting the yolks in a small bowl and the whites
in another small bowl. Whisk the yolks into the chocolate-butter mixture.
4 Whisk the egg whites (or beat them on low speed) for 3 minutes, and add the sugar.
Continue to beat or whisk the egg whites until they’re stiff and glossy, about 3 minutes.
Gently fold the egg white mixture into the chocolate mixture.
5 Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and smooth the top of the batter with a rubber
spatula.
6 Bake the batter until the cake is set in the center — about 45 to 50 minutes. Let the cake
cool for 15 minutes and remove it from the pan.
Tip: Cover the cake in powdered sugar or cocoa powder, or drizzle it with caramel sauce
or chocolate sauce. If you’re watching your calories (yeah, right!), you may want to cover it
in raspberries instead.

Making Sweet Stuff to Pack ’n Snack On
Some desserts are just meant to be eaten at home. Ice cream, for instance,
and flaming finales like bananas Foster and cherries jubilee. They’re great if
the get-together is at your house, but what if the party’s somewhere else and
the host asks you to bring dessert? What can you bring to picnics? What
packs and travels well for a sweet treat in the kids’ lunchboxes? What if you
just want a quick grab ’n go indulgence? I’m glad you asked.

Chapter 15: Getting Your Just Desserts
Making your own desserts
“Ooey Gooey Brownie-Cake-Cookie” — yum!
Okay, I made that up. I really don’t have a recipe
to follow for a brownie-cake-cookie, but you
could make one, which is the point of this.
Really, I have two points:
 Use mixes: Literally dozens of companies
make absolutely incredible mixes for
gluten-free baked goods. Sure, using them
is a little pricier than making stuff from
scratch, but take it from someone who’s
made at least 436 cakes that didn’t rise, 239
batches of brownies that I later served as
fudged fudge, and 1,486 cookies that formed
a large brick-like glob that I served as
“bars”: Mixes are tried, true, and — today,
at least — absolutely delicious.
 Be creative: How my family and I dealt with
last night’s dessert fiasco is a great exam-
ple of being creative. We made a cake, and
although it did actually rise, it also stuck
miserably to the Bundt pan. We eventually
pulled all the cake from the pan in hundreds
of pieces. I sprayed a pie pan with lots of
nonstick spray and began to press the
crumbs in. Then we realized we’d acciden-
tally bought frosting that had gluten in it, but
we did have leftover cookie dough. So we
squished that, too, topped the cake crumbs
with it, added some candy coated choco-
late for color, and put the cookie and cake
back in the oven for 10 minutes. We ended
up with an ooey-gooey cake-cookie that
actually tasted great!

T Chocolate Marshmallow Bars
Few sweet grab-n-go snacks have withstood the test of time like marshmallow bars. But
most cereals used to make those bars have gluten in them, so they’re usually off-limits.
Try this simple variation using Cocoa Pebbles or any other gluten-free chocolate-
flavored puffed rice cereal you can find.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Refrigeration time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
252
Part III: From Menus to Meals: Recipes for the Gluten-Free Gastronome 
Nonstick spray
1⁄4 cup margarine
10-ounce package marshmallows
5 cups gluten-free chocolate puffed rice
cereal
1 Spray a 9- by 13-inch pan with lots of nonstick spray.
2 Put the margarine into a large saucepan and melt the margarine over low heat. Add the
marshmallows, and stirring constantly, cook the mixture until the marshmallows are all
melted and smooth. Remove the pan from the heat.
3 Add the cereal, and mix it well so all the cereal is coated with the marshmallow mixture.
4 Spread the warm mixture into the sprayed pan. Using wax paper or a spatula sprayed
with nonstick spray, press the cereal mixture into an even layer.
5 Refrigerate the pan for 10 minutes, and then cut the mixture into squares. You can put
the bars back into the fridge until they’re as cold as you like them.

T Sweet Peanut Butter- and 
Chocolate-Covered Cereal
These treats are sweet and crunchy, and they make a great on-the-go snack to satisfy
your sweet tooth. Usually this recipe calls for puffed rice cereal squares like Chex, but
Chex has gluten, so I use Health Valley’s Rice Crunch-Ems! instead. I dare anyone to tell
the difference!
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Refrigeration time: 30 minutes
Yield: 12 servings
253
Chapter 15: Getting Your Just Desserts
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup peanut butter
1⁄2 cup margarine
13-ounce box of Rice Crunch-Ems! Cereal
1 tablespoon vanilla
2 cups powdered sugar
1 Combine the chocolate chips, peanut butter, and margarine in a medium-sized pan over
medium-low heat. Stir the ingredients constantly until they’re melted and well mixed.
2 Pour the cereal into a very large bowl. Drizzle the chocolate mixture over the cereal,
and mix it well so all the cereal is coated.
3 Put the powdered sugar into a large plastic bag; add the cereal — a bagful at a time —
and shake it to coat the cereal.
4 Spread out the mixture on wax paper, separating the chunks of cereal so they don’t
stick together in globs. Refrigerate the mixture for 30 minutes.

fruit-flavored puffed rice cereal.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 12 servings
254
Part III: From Menus to Meals: Recipes for the Gluten-Free Gastronome 
3 cups fruit-flavored puffed rice cereal
1 cup popped plain popcorn
1⁄2 cup peanuts
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons caramel ice cream topping
1 In a large bowl, combine the cereal, popcorn, and peanuts.
2 In a small microwave-safe bowl, heat the butter and caramel topping on high for 1
minute, or until it’s melted. Stir it until it’s smooth.
3 Pour the caramel mixture over the cereal-popcorn-peanut mixture, and stir it well.
4 Spread the mixture on wax paper to cool. When it’s cool enough to touch safely, mold it
into balls the size of a tennis ball. Store the popcorn balls in an airtight container.

2 Put the sugar and corn syrup in a large microwaveable bowl. Cover the bowl with a
paper towel, and microwave the mixture on high for 8 minutes. Stir the mixture, and
then microwave it for 4 more minutes. Watch to make sure it doesn’t bubble over.
3 Stir in the peanuts, and microwave for another 2 minutes. The mixture should be light
brown in color.
4 Add the butter and vanilla, blending well. Microwave the mixture on high for another
minute. The peanuts will be lightly browned. Add the baking soda and stir gently until
the mixture is light and foamy.
5 Pour the mixture onto the cookie sheets over the chocolate chips. Let the mixture cool
for an hour. When it’s cool, break it into small pieces and store them in an airtight

T Incredibly Easy 
Peanut Butter Cookies
By definition, a cookie can be any of a variety of handheld, flour-based sweet cakes,
either crispy or soft. I break all the rules with this recipe, because there’s no flour to be
found. Best of all, the cookies are incredibly easy — they have only three ingredients!

Being Sensible: Sweets for 
the Health-Conscious
“Healthy dessert.” Isn’t that an oxymoron? For the most part, desserts can be
like land mines in the Battle of the Bulge and the Hunt for Health, sabotaging
even your strongest attempts to eat well. Most of the recipes I’ve seen for
healthful desserts usually just make a no-sweetener, no-fat, no-cal, no-carb,
no-taste glob of textures that are more appealing to horses than humans.

258
Part III: From Menus to Meals: Recipes for the Gluten-Free Gastronome 
But you can satisfy without sabotage and still keep the dessert gluten-free. In
fact, some of the recipes I offer in this section are downright good for you, so
you can enjoy them as part of a gluten-free, guilt-free, well-balanced diet.
Try sautéing fruits like apples, pears, or bananas over medium-high heat in
sugar (or sucralose artificial sweetener, sold as Splenda) and water until
they’re a little bit caramelized. Doing so adds a caramel flavor without the fat
of a caramel sauce.
T Grilled Banana Split
You don’t really have to grill the bananas, but they look cool with the grill marks, and
warming them gives them a great texture.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 6 minutes
Yield: 12 servings
6 firm bananas, with peeling
3 tablespoons honey
1 quart nonfat vanilla frozen yogurt
2 tablespoons light chocolate syrup
3 tablespoons fat-free whipped cream
topping
1 Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.
2 Don’t peel the bananas! Cut each one in half lengthwise and then again in half width-
wise so you have four sections from each banana.
3 Brush honey on the flat sides of the bananas, and let them stand for about 5 minutes.
4 Put the flesh side of the bananas on the hot grill and cook them for about 3 minutes
(until the bananas have grill marks). Turn them over and cook about 3 more minutes,
until the peel begins to easily pull away. Make sure the bananas don’t slip through the
grate.
5 Arrange two sections of banana in each bowl, and top the bananas with frozen yogurt, a
drizzle of chocolate syrup, and whipped cream.

and loaded with nutritional value. Blueberries are higher in antioxidants than many
other fruits and vegetables, and they’re fat-free, low in calories, and high in fiber. Just
one cup provides about 15 percent of your daily need for vitamin C. Fresh, frozen,
canned, and dried blueberries are available all year long — but treat yourself to the
sweet, fresh blueberries of summer for the best blueberries of all.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Freezing time: 2 hours
Yield: 4 servings
2 cups blueberries
1⁄4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1⁄4 cup cool water
1 tablespoon lemon juice
8 ounces nonfat plain yogurt
2 cups sliced strawberries
1 In a medium-sized saucepan, stir together the blueberries and sugar.
2 In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch and water together until the cornstarch dissolves.
3 Add the cornstarch-water mixture to the blueberries and sugar, and cook the blueberry
mixture over medium heat until it begins to boil. Let it boil for 1 minute. Stir in the
lemon juice, and let the blueberries cool.
4 Gently fold the yogurt into the cooled blueberry mixture so you don’t crush the berries.
5 In four separate parfait glasses, layer some of the blueberry mixture, then some straw-
berries, and then the blueberry mixture again. Keep alternating layers until the glasses
are full and you’ve used all the ingredients.
6 Freeze the parfaits for at least 2 hours. Take them out of the freezer 30 minutes before
you plan to serve them.
Tip: You can serve your favorite gluten-free cookies with these parfaits. Just before serving,
when the parfait has softened a little, stick a cookie in the parfait.

T Granola Bars
Most granola isn’t gluten-free, so use a commercially available gluten-free granola or
mix up a batch from the recipe I give you in Chapter 10. Turn your granola into a great
gluten-free dessert with this one! This is a good way to use up your granola if it’s begin-
ning to go stale.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 30 to 35 minutes
Cooling time: 1 hour
Yield: 4 servings
Nonstick spray
2 cups granola
1 cup chopped peanuts
1⁄2 cup gluten-free flour mixture
1⁄2 cup raisins
1 egg, beaten
1⁄3 cup honey
1⁄3 cup canola oil
1⁄3 cup packed brown sugar
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
2 Line an 8-inch square pan with aluminum foil, and spray it with nonstick spray.
3 In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine the granola, peanuts, flour mixture, and
raisins. Stir in the egg, honey, oil, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Press the mixture evenly
into the pan.
4 Bake the granola mixture for 30 to 35 minutes, or until it’s lightly browned around the
edges. Cool it for at least 1 hour.
5 Pull the foil out of the pan and flip the granola mixture upside down so you can peel off
the aluminum foil. Cut the granola mixture into sixteen 2-inch squares.

Chapter 15: Getting Your Just Desserts
Satisfy your sweet tooth with fabulous fruit
Humans do love their sweets. If you give a baby
a spoonful of ice cream and one of sour cream,
you don’t need a team of researchers and a
multimillion-dollar, placebo-controlled, double-
blind study to figure out which one will make
him smile and which will make him grimace.
Sure, people need glucose — that’s the sugar
that powers the body. But you can get enough
of that from fruit, vegetables, and other foods.
You also have the added benefit of getting vita-
mins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants for far
fewer calories than the “empty calories” you
find in sugary foods. So satisfy your sweet tooth,
but try to do it with foods that pack a nutritional
punch. Here are some ideas:
 Chocolate hazelnut spread fruit dip: Warm
up chocolate hazelnut spread a little and dip
fresh fruit in it.
 Grapes and French cream: Combine about
1 cup fat-free sour cream, 1⁄2 cup powdered
sugar, 1⁄2 cup sucralose artificial sweetener
(Splenda), and a dash of vanilla. Mix the
French cream with red, green, and black
grapes.
 Peaches ’n cream: Put half of a peach or
pear in a dish and add a small scoop of
vanilla frozen yogurt. Put raspberries or
strawberries on top.
 Pudding: If you use skim milk with a pack-
aged pudding, it’s pretty good for you. Serve
it with bananas on top.
 Strawberries and yogurt: Slice strawber-
ries and blend them with nonfat flavored
yogurt. Top the mixture with artificial sweet-
ener if you want a little extra sweetness.
 Strawberry sweet and sour: Dip fresh
strawberries into fat-free sour cream and
then into artificial sweetener or honey.
Remember: Fresh fruit is best for you when you
store it properly. Don’t refrigerate bananas and
other tropical fruits. Melons don’t need refrig-
eration until you cut them; store them in a sep-
arate bin, away from vegetables and meat.

Living — and
Loving —
the Gluten-Free
Lifestyle 24/7

In this part . . .
I
take a look at the social implications of living gluten-
free, because getting out of the house is one of the
most challenging practical aspects of living a gluten-free
lifestyle. I give you the tools you need to enjoy eating at
restaurants, traveling, and socializing — all while staying
safely gluten-free — because your diet shouldn’t ever
stand in the way of your activities and adventures. I also
discuss the unique emotional challenges that people face
when embracing the gluten-free lifestyle and how to over-
come those obstacles. Most of all, my goal in this part is
to help you capture the essence of living — and loving —
the gluten-free lifestyle.

Chapter 16
Getting Out and About:
Eating Away from Home
In This Chapter
 Setting yourself up for success when eating out
 Preparing for restaurant adventures
 Packing it up — it’s travel time!
 Going gluten-free on planes, trains, and automobiles (and ships)
F
or some people, it isn’t the gluten-free diet itself that presents the biggest
challenge — it’s getting out of the house. Even people who’ve been
gluten-free for years sometimes feel uncomfortable about venturing away
from home.
Most of this book focuses on reading labels, shopping and cooking, modifying
recipes, keeping the kitchen gluten-free, and flicking the peanut butter off the
knife so the knife doesn’t get contaminated with crumbs. But what about when
you eat out? There are no labels to read, you’re limited to the selections others
provide, and you have no idea whether they know how to do the gob drop (see
Chapter 7). And for the most part, you have little control over how the cooks
prepare the food.
Yet getting out is important. Life in a bubble is for oxygen molecules, not
humans. Does venturing outside require extra effort on your part? Sure.
Might you receive a meal contaminated with gluten? Yep. Are you going to
pay $20 for a meal that would have cost $6 to make at home? Darned straight.
Is it worth it? Absolutely.
The reality is that you can’t always be at home in a crumb-free zone with
pantries stocked with your gluten-free favorites and toaster ovens bearing
the “GF” stamp of approval. Whether you’re taking clients out for lunch,
enjoying a romantic dinner for two at your favorite restaurant, traveling for
business, or seeing the world for pleasure, you will be eating out. And unless
you want to pout and starve, you need to know how to safely and comfort-
ably accommodate your gluten-free lifestyle when you’re away from home.

The Golden Rules of Going Out 
Gluten-Free
You just arrived at the social event of the year. You’re energized, looking fabu-
lous, and eager to spend a great evening with friends. And you’re famished.
You zero in on the buffet table, loaded with the most amazing spread you’ve
seen in decades, and slowly you begin to realize that you can’t eat anything
within a 2.8-mile radius. Your mood plummets as fast as your panic rises,
because you realize you’re going to be there all night with nothing to eat.
What follows are some basic rules of going out gluten-free. These rules should
prevent such a buzz-kill scenario, because there’s no reason to let a little food
(or lack thereof) ruin a good time. Armed with these practical and emotional
guidelines, your social experiences can be as spectacular as ever.
Don’t expect others to accommodate
your diet
The office party is coming up in two months. Realizing food will obviously
be there, you take the time to visit with the person planning the party, and
you explain your dietary restrictions, right down to the sometimes some-
what-intricate details of the gluten-free diet. She’s ranking high on the 
does-she-get-it scale, nodding in the appropriate places, even tossing in
an “Oh, so you probably can’t do the rolls, right?” Wow! She gets it! You’re
set, right? Don’t bet your promotion on it. And whatever you do, don’t
expect it.
If she comes through and you see gluten-free goodies there (in which case
you’ll be tempted to fiercely guard them, elbowing guests away, defending
your territory and hissing, “Those are for me! They’re all I can eat!”), be gra-
cious, thankful, and gush all over her (and don’t hiss; it’s really not becoming).
She didn’t have to make the effort to accommodate your diet, but she did.
Really, you shouldn’t expect anyone to accommodate your gluten-free diet —
I don’t care who it is. Even those closest to you — those you love the 
most — are going to forget or make mistakes. This doesn’t happen because
they don’t care — they (usually) do. Often, the lack of gluten-free goodies
is just an oversight, or sometimes people think they understand the diet,
but they missed some of the intricacies and what they think is gluten-free is
floating in teriyaki.
266
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 

Ask what’s for dinner
Asking about the menu isn’t rude. Well, sometimes it is. Like when you invite
some people for dinner and they’re trying to choose between that and
another opportunity, so they respond, “Yeah, maybe. What’s for dinner?” But
that’s another book (see Responding to Rude Remarks For Dummies). (Sorry,
folks, I made that title up, so you’re on your own for clever comebacks).
When you’re gluten-free and attending a social function, asking what’s for
dinner won’t earn you a spot on the social circuit blacklist. Of course, some
ways of asking are ruder than others (see preceding paragraph), but I assume
you have more tact than that and can simply say to the host or hostess, “I
have a dietary restriction and was wondering if it would be okay to ask you
about what you’re serving so I can plan accordingly.” Most of the time,
people are receptive to sitting down with you, discussing the menu, even
asking for your input, and accommodating your diet as best they can.
Fill ’er up before you go
Because you can’t expect any gluten-free goodies you can eat at the party, fill-
ing up before you go is a good idea. That way you’re not starved and fixated
on food, and you can enjoy the party for what it’s really all about, which is
fun and friends.
The biggest problem with this rule is that if you get to the party and find lots
of gluten-free goodies you can eat, you’ll be so excited that you’ll eat them all,
even though you’re not hungry. Beware of popping buttons.
BYOF: Bring your own food
I’m not suggesting that you walk into a formal soirée with bags of fast food
under your arms, wafting the just-fried french fry smell among guests in tuxe-
dos. No, that type of a grand entrance may not sit well with the host and
hostess. The setting does, of course, determine the type of food you bring
and how you bring it.
Don’t worry that bringing your own food may offend the host. First, you can
always discuss this option with him in advance. But if you don’t, you can dis-
creetly explain to him that you have a dietary restriction and rather than
burden him with the details (“I know you’ve been busy getting ready for this
party . . .”), you thought it would be easiest just to bring a few things for
yourself to eat. Ask where you should put your things and whether serving
yourself when you get hungry is appropriate.
267
Chapter 16: Getting Out and About: Eating Away from Home

Bite your tongue when they 
make a mistake
You sat down with the hostess, talked about her plans for the meal, and
decided where she could make a few accommodations for you. You get to
the party only to find croissants surrounded by phyllo-filled finger foods
and breaded fried stuff. You:
A) Pout and starve.
B) Pout, starve, and yell at the hostess.
C) Pout, starve, scream rude things at the hostess, and pick the innards out
of the phyllo-stuffed thingies (No! They’re glutenated!).
D) None of the above. You enjoy the party and relax. You weren’t hungry
anyway, because you filled up before you came.
The correct answer, of course, should be D.
Enjoy the company
It doesn’t matter whether you’re at a nightclub, a festive party for 500, a
restaurant enjoying an intimate dinner for two, a wedding, or a wake — social
gatherings are not about the food. They’re about the occasion, the atmos-
phere, the ambiance, the people you’re with . . . oh, and did I mention that
you don’t have to clean up?
Now I’m not saying that social functions don’t revolve around food. They do.
Most societies use food as a focal point to draw people close during times of
socialization and celebration. But don’t lose sight of the celebration itself and

Making smart choices at potlucks
Potlucks are tough because lots of cooks are in
the kitchen. You have no idea what’s in the
dishes, and even those that look the safest
could have seasonings or ingredients that turn
a potluck surprise into party demise.
Your best bet at potlucks is to offer to bring
something you happen to love — and that can
fill you up and keep you happy throughout the
party. So what if you’re eating only the dish you
brought? If anyone notices, you can explain.
Chances are, though, people will be too busy
loading up their own plates to check out what
you have on yours.

social functions are about. (If you’re invited to a bread-tasting party, ignore
this paragraph — in that case, it is about the food.)
Dining Out: Restaurant 
Realities and Rewards
A great experience at a terrific restaurant is priceless. Good company, nice
ambiance, respectful service, and delicious food synergize to create a multi-
faceted experience that is far more than just a meal.
Being on a gluten-free diet shouldn’t hold you back from going out. Sure,
eating at restaurants involves some risk. You don’t know for sure what ingre-
dients are in your food, no matter how much you try to educate your server
and chef. Kitchen and waiting staffs are busy and can (and do) make mis-
takes, and cross-contamination is always an issue. And by law, you will at
least once in your gluten-free dining days receive a salad with croutons that
you have to send back.
But with just a little extra effort, you can help ensure that your meal is safely
gluten-free, and you can enjoy gluten-free dining as one of life’s more pleasur-
able social experiences.
Here are some tips for eating out that can help make your gluten-free dining
experiences the best they can be:
 Be pleasant and grateful. If you’re demanding, you’re going to put them
on the defensive. When they accommodate your requests, be extremely
grateful.
 Give them just enough information. Not too much, not too little. You
may have to read the server to see whether he or she is really “getting”
what you’re saying.
 Don’t be afraid to ask for what you want. You’re paying for the meal,
and you should be able to enjoy it knowing it’s safe for you to eat.
 Make it clear to the server and chef that this is a serious condition.
If you have to sound alarming, do so. One of the best ways to get their
attention is to say, “It’s kind of like an allergy to peanuts.” You know it’s
not really like an allergy to peanuts, but it will get their attention.
 Call ahead if you can. Remember to avoid busy hours. See whether they
can fax or e-mail you a menu. At the same time, you can fax or e-mail
them a list of ingredients you can and can’t have.
269
Chapter 16: Getting Out and About: Eating Away from Home

 Know how foods are prepared. The more you know about traditional
preparation, the better decisions you can make when ordering.
 Bring your own food. Not only can you bring your own bread or crack-
ers to snack on, but you can even bring food for them to cook for you.
Remember to offer suggestions for how to keep your food from becom-
ing contaminated by the rest of the food in the restaurant.
 Send it back if it’s not right. Of course I’m not suggesting you be rude
about this, but if they give you a salad with croutons on it, don’t pick
the croutons out and eat it. That’s not safe! There’s nothing wrong with
politely saying, “Excuse me. I must have forgotten to mention that I
can’t have croutons on my salad. Do you mind bringing me a new one?”
Everyone knows you mentioned it; you’re just letting them off the hook.
Choosing the restaurant
Don’t go to Sam’s All-We-Serve-Is-Pizza pizza joint and whine that you can’t
eat anything. You’re setting yourself up for frustration and disappointment
if you choose restaurants that, by the very nature of their menu selections,
aren’t likely to have much (if anything) that’s gluten-free.
Instead, go to restaurants that have large and diverse menu selections, or
choose an ethnic restaurant that’s likely to have more gluten-free foods.
Happy gluten-free dining starts with choosing restaurants that are likely to
have foods on the menu that are already gluten-free or that the kitchen staff
can easily modify.
Good bets
With any restaurant you go to, you have to check ingredients in specific dishes.
And of course, food preparation is an issue (are they using the same spatula to
flip the burgers and the buns?). You can either ask the workers to make your
food in an uncontaminated manner or you can opt to eat somewhere else. But
as a general rule, the types of restaurants that are a good bet include
 All-you-can-eat soup and salad: Not only do these restaurants usually
offer lots of items that are gluten-free, but they often have their ingredi-
ents handy so you can check soups and salad dressings to be sure.
Sometimes the ingredients are actually posted on placards in front of the
item. If not, ask a server or the manager whether there’s a listing of
ingredients. Some restaurants have notebooks with recipes for each
item, and they’re usually glad to let you take a look.
 Barbecues: Although you do have to check the sauces, many barbecues
are good bets because they do traditional fare such as ribs, chicken,
pork, corn on the cob, mashed potatoes, and potato salad.
270
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 

 Breakfast houses: Be careful here — some breakfast places make the
scrambled eggs with a boxed egg that has wheat flour mixed in (ick!). So
ask for fresh eggs. You may also be able to get hash browns, fruit, yogurt,
and lots of other good breakfast stuff.
 Fast food: Fast-food joints offer fries, shakes, salads, chili, and other foods
that are often gluten-free. If you order a burger, make sure it’s without a
bun — even if you pluck it off, the bun contaminates your dinner. Many
fast-food places offer a lettuce bun, even if they don’t advertise that they
do so. Several restaurants even have their nutritional information and
ingredients posted online.
When you’re getting fries, make sure they’re not breaded or coated in
anything, and ask what other things are fried in the same oil. You don’t
want to order fries that have been swimming with onion rings or some-
thing else that contaminates the oil with gluten.
 Indian: Many of the ingredients in Indian cooking are inherently 
gluten-free.
 Mexican: Mexican cooking includes many inherently gluten-free foods.
Restaurants often guard their cooking secrets, but most Mexican recipes
call for spices such as cumin, epazote, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper.
Carnitas, a traditional simmered pork dish served with corn tortillas,
shredded lettuce, tomatoes, rice, and beans, is an example of a Mexican
dish that’s usually a safe bet. But as is the case with any meal, you need
to make sure the kitchen staff doesn’t add flour to the sauce, and of
course, specify corn tortillas instead of flour if you get a choice.
 Mongolian barbecue: Mongolian barbecues are essentially choose-your-
own stir-fry restaurants. Because you can make your own sauces and add
your own ingredients, Mongolian barbecues tend to be a good bet for
gluten-free dining. Be sure to have the cooks thoroughly clean the grill
before cooking your meal. And tell them that you have food allergies so
they can keep your food separate from your neighbor’s teriyaki chicken.
 Steak and seafood: These restaurants are likely to have steaks or burg-
ers, seafood, salads (hold the croutons), baked potatoes or rice, french
fries, and ice cream for dessert.
 Thai/Vietnamese: What a treat to be able to go to a Thai or Vietnamese
restaurant and eat noodles! Be careful — not all their noodles are gluten-
free, but most of them are rice-based and are safe. The sauces they use,
for the most part, are gluten-free, too.
You may notice lots of ethnic options on the “good bets” list. Many ethnic
foods are naturally gluten-free. You need to figure out which ones you like, and
of those foods, which are inherently gluten-free. Then you can choose a restau-
rant of that ethnicity and know what to order. Mexican, Thai, Vietnamese, and
Indian cuisines are just a few that offer a huge selection of gluten-free foods.
Do your homework to find out how the chefs prepare traditional fare, and
then dig in.
271
Chapter 16: Getting Out and About: Eating Away from Home

Risky restaurants
You can definitely get gluten-free meals at some of these restaurants, but in
general, restaurants that aren’t going to be a good bet include
 Bakeries: I probably didn’t need to point that out, did I?
 Cajun: You can get blackened fish and other gluten-free foods at Cajun
restaurants, but be careful of contamination issues. For the most part,
Cajun food is covered in breadings (sometimes they’re just cornmeal
and seasonings, and they may be okay). And many gumbos, étouffées,
and other Cajun dishes are often flavored with a darkened roux, which is
made from flour. Some foods that appear to be okay, such as shrimp, are
often boiled in beer.
 Chinese: These restaurants use soy sauce in many, if not most of their
dishes, and their soy sauce usually has gluten in it. You can bring your
own soy sauce, but warn the cooks to be careful about contamination
issues while they’re preparing your food.
 Italian: Most Italian restaurants serve a lot of pasta, breads, and breaded
items. You can, however, find restaurants that serve polenta, an Italian
cornmeal classic, and of course you can eat the wonderful (crouton-free)
salads.
 Specialty coffee shops: The trendy coffee shops you’re familiar with
offer foods and snacks, usually marketed as being wholesome or
healthy. Unfortunately, what that usually means is that their muffins are
bran muffins. For the most part, other than yogurt or fruit, coffee shops
offer very little in the way of gluten-free snacks.
Calling ahead
Don’t be afraid to call a restaurant ahead of time to talk about the menu and
to figure out whether the chefs can accommodate your gluten-free diet. If 
possible, have someone fax or e-mail you a menu so you can see what the
restaurant serves that’s likely to be gluten-free, and then call back and discuss
the ingredients with the head chef. You can also fax or e-mail the restaurant
a list of the safe and forbidden ingredients. Sometimes restaurants are so
accommodating that if you give them enough notice, they’ll get special
ingredients for your meal.
Call at the restaurant’s slowest time of day (if you don’t know when that is,
ask them). If the restaurant serves lunch, you want to catch someone after
the lunch rush and before the dinner crowd — probably around 2:30 or
3:00 p.m. If the restaurant serves dinner only, call earlier than that — more
like 1:00 p.m. or so.
272
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 

One of the best things about fast-food places is that they generally follow
standardized guidelines, so one call to their corporate offices can answer
your questions about dedicated fryers, ingredients, and even food prepara-
tion. Many chains also have Web sites that list their nutritional information
and ingredients, and some even have a gluten-free menu online. If you eat at
fast-food restaurants often, put the information into a small three-ring binder
and keep it in your car. That way, when you’re pulling into the drive-through
of one of your favorite fast-food joints, you have a handy list of their gluten-
free items.
Making smart menu choices
Set yourself up for success. Choose menu items that are likely to be gluten-
free or that the kitchen staff can easily modify to be gluten-free. Obviously,
breaded and fried items aren’t going to be your best bets, although some-
times cooks can use the same meat, season it with spices, and grill it instead.
So, do you order the beer-battered fish? Not a good choice. The teriyaki pork
stir-fry? Nope. Fried chicken? Probably not. Grilled chicken? There you go!
Grilled fish? Steak? Sure! Of course, you still may need to ask a few questions,
but at least you’re on the right track.
Ordering is a four-step process:
1. Find the foods on the menu that are already likely to be gluten-free or
appear that they could easily be modified to be gluten-free.
2. Choose the item(s) you want.
3. Ask about ingredients and food preparation methods. I go into detail
about this later in this chapter.
4. Make sure you’ve made your order clear and have offered suggestions
for how to season and prepare your meal.
273
Chapter 16: Getting Out and About: Eating Away from Home
Gluten-free menus
Close your eyes and imagine being at a beautiful
restaurant with great company. The server
chirps, “Hi, I’m Sarah. I’ll be your server today.
Would you like to see the gluten-free menu?”
Okay, you can open your eyes now, because I
know how hard it is to read this book with them
closed. Besides, this isn’t a dream. It’s a reality!
Today, several restaurants, like PF Chang’s and
Outback Steakhouse, offer gluten-free menus —
some of them are even online. You usually need
to ask, though, so speak up and ask whether they
have a gluten-free menu. You never know when
your server may hand you one.

Do a bit of research on food preparation. The more you know about how foods
are usually prepared, the easier ordering is. For instance, you should know that
restaurants, especially Cajun restaurants, often boil seafood in beer. And the
“crab” you find in sushi is usually a mixture of fish and wheat flour.
Talking with the staff: Ask and 
ye shall receive
My teenage kids hate being with me when I order food at a restaurant. All
I have to do is hold up the menu and say to the server, “Could I ask you a
question?” and my kids start fidgeting, rolling their eyes, mumbling, “Here
we go . . .” But what’s wrong with getting what you want when you’re paying
for your food? (Certainly, my kids don’t hesitate to put in their short-order
requests when I’m the chef!)
Don’t be afraid to ask for what you want (even if your teenage kids are a tad
intimidating). People ask for special considerations at restaurants all the
time, even when they don’t have dietary restrictions. If you feel that the
server isn’t getting it, ask to talk with the chef. Of course, be tactful about it.
Asking for special considerations for your meal isn’t rude — especially when
your health depends on it.
274
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 
Letting restaurant cards speak for you
Restaurant cards are small cards that explain
the basics of the gluten-free dietary guidelines
that you can give to a server or chef. You can
make your own, download one from the
Internet, or buy them from support groups and
other entities. Basically, the card says some-
thing like this:
I have a severe reaction to gluten and am
on a strict gluten-free diet. Thank you for
working with me to prepare a meal I can
safely enjoy.
I cannot eat wheat, rye, barley, or their
derivatives. These include kamut, spelt,
durum, semolina, bulgur, triticale, and malt.
I also avoid oats. Foods and ingredients I
need to avoid include croutons, bread,
breadings, flour, soy sauce, orzo, buns and
rolls, brown rice syrup, and malt vinegar. I
can eat rice, corn, potatoes, tapioca, soy,
beans, amaranth, arrowroot, buckwheat,
quinoa, millet, teff, and nut flours. I can also
eat vinegar (except malt vinegar) and dis-
tilled alcohols.
If you have any questions, please ask me.
Thank you for working with me on this!
Know that you have given me the opportu-
nity to relax and enjoy my meal; I appreci-
ate that very much.
If you make your own card, laminating it is a
good idea, because it’s likely to get covered in
food when the chef handles it. I like to make up
several of these cards and leave them behind
with the chef for other patrons he or she may
have in the future.

Yes, you really do need to talk to the server and maybe even the chef . . . and
yes, you sometimes need to give them lots of detail. But for the most part,
you should keep explanations as simple as possible and work your way into
detail if you need to. You may be surprised at how little you need to say.
Of course, you’ve already chosen a restaurant that’s likely to have gluten-free
items and you’ve picked some items on the menu that look like they may be
gluten-free or could be modified to be gluten-free. So at this point, you’re
ready to order. You may say something like this:
The Opener: “I’m on a gluten-free diet and have some special considera-
tions I’m hoping you can help me with.”
You’re likely to find that the staff is very receptive. I start right in with the
words “gluten-free” because awareness is spreading, and these days when
you explain that you need a gluten-free meal, your server is likely to respond
with, “Oh, really? Do you have a gluten intolerance like celiac disease?” At
this point, you feel like that server is your new very best friend, and you
know your special order is in good hands. The kitchen crew will probably be
on board, too. Today’s chefs learn about the gluten-free diet in culinary
schools, and they love to put their skills and knowledge to work to please a
customer.
Assume, though, that the server doesn’t seem to know anything about the
gluten-free diet and simply shrugs his or her shoulders. At this point, the situ-
ation requires some explanation — but not too much. You don’t want to over-
whelm your server or relate your entire nine-year medical history. You do,
however, need to get your server’s attention.
The Alarm: “I have a very severe reaction to gluten. Gluten is in wheat,
rye, and barley, and I also avoid oats.”
Notice the words “severe reaction.” These are alarm words that in the restau-
rant owner’s mind are a euphemism for “lawsuit waiting to happen.” Not that
you would sue — I hope you wouldn’t. But ears perk up when you use the
words, and that’s a good thing. Restaurant workers and management then
pay closer attention.
At this point, you can hand over your restaurant card or make specific sug-
gestions for how the cooks could prepare the item you want to be gluten-free.
Don’t be afraid of over-stressing the importance of this and the details
involved.
Remember to talk about how the staff prepares the food. If the food is grilled,
you may want to say, “Could you please make sure that the part of the grill
where you cook my food is clean and doesn’t have crumbs from another
meal? Also, could you please use a separate spatula to flip my burger?”

Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 
If the server just doesn’t seem to be getting it or seems unwilling to work
with you, ask to talk with the chef. This is not a big deal. People are so afraid
to ask to talk to the chef, but chefs often love to mingle with the guests and
are really interested in the gluten-free diet.
The do-they-get-it point system
When you talk to your server and/or chef, you
can figure out how to read their responses and
assign them do-they-get-it points. Your interac-
tions with them throughout the ordering process
and ensuing meal may depend on how many
points they earn.

don’t forget a big tip.

Having restaurants cook the food you bring
Many restaurants allow you to bring your own food into the restaurant, and
they may warm it or even cook it for you. If you do this, be aware of how they
normally cook their food, because you probably need to watch out for some
contamination concerns.
For instance, most pizza places use convection ovens that blow the flour all
around. If you bring a pizza crust and ask them to use their toppings and
cook it, you have to be sure their toppings aren’t contaminated (they often
are), and then you have to make sure they wrap the pizza securely in alu-
minum foil before warming it in the oven — otherwise, your gluten-free pizza
goes into a pizza oven that’s blowing flour all over. Same goes for bringing a
pre-made gluten-free pizza with you — make sure it’s wrapped carefully
before asking them to warm it in their ovens.
Pasta places often allow you to bring gluten-free pastas and cook them for
you. Be sure to remind the workers to use a clean pot, clean water, clean
utensils, and a clean colander before they make your gluten-free pasta.
I hope I’m not stating the obvious, but you probably should only ask the
restaurant to prepare your food if you’re actually buying some of theirs. A
group of four, each of whom has brought his own meal in, won’t win any pop-
ularity contests. But if one person in a group of four brings his meal, it’s not
usually a problem. Restaurants don’t usually charge extra to warm or prepare
meals you bring yourself, but you should ask to be sure.
You may want to think about getting toaster bags for toasting your bread
when you’re away from home. The bags are great for making sure your bread
doesn’t get contaminated when you’re away from home. Just put your gluten-
free bread in the bag, and anyone can put it in a toaster, toaster oven, or 
regular oven. Then just take your bread out, and you have perfectly unconta-
minated gluten-free toast. The bags are washable and reusable, but you can
just toss them when you’re done.
Remembering the art of healthy tipping
I don’t take tipping lightly, because when people accommodate your gluten-
free diet and give you the peace of mind that helps you enjoy the multidimen-
sional, multisensational experience of dining out, you should express your
gratitude. If they’ve done it with an eager-to-please attitude, showing your
appreciation is even more important.
277
Chapter 16: Getting Out and About: Eating Away from Home

The number of people going gluten-free is skyrocketing. Every server you talk
to, every chef you inform, and every tip you leave will better the future for
everyone going gluten-free today, tomorrow, and beyond.
The Incredible, Edible Journey: 
It’s Travel Time!
Whether you’re getting away for business or pleasure, nearly all people find
themselves leaving home from time to time. You don’t have to limit or, worse
yet, give up traveling because you’re on a gluten-free diet. In fact, you may actu-
ally find some countries to be more accommodating than you ever would’ve
dreamed. For instance, when you order a burger at McDonald’s in some parts
of Sweden or Finland, they ask you whether you’d like that on a regular or
gluten-free bun!
If you follow the “Golden Rules of Going Out Gluten-Free” that I outline earlier
in this chapter, you’ll be well-prepared for wherever your travels take you.
And because traveling nearly always involves eating at restaurants, you
should also pay particular attention to the advice in the preceding section on
dining out. But to ensure a great gluten-free adventure, here are a few more
things that you should know before you hit the road.
278
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 
Knowing the boundaries when crossing the border
If you’re traveling internationally, be aware of
some special considerations. For instance,
some countries won’t allow you to bring food
across the border. If that’s the case, see
whether you can send it ahead, or find out
whether gluten-free products are available
there, in which case you may not need to bring
food with you.
Also be aware that different countries have dif-
ferent standards for what’s allowed on the
gluten-free diet. In Europe, for instance, manu-
facturers use an ingredient called Codex
Alimentarius wheat starch, which has the
gluten removed. Products that contain this
ingredient are labeled gluten-free, but in the
United States and Canada, that product isn’t
considered gluten-free.
Realize that your foods may be suspect in some
countries. One time my family and I went to
Mexico and brought some of our favorite gluten-
free pancake mix. We didn’t want to take the
entire bag (we buy it in bulk), so we put some in a
food storage zipper bag and tossed it in our carry-
ons. Unfortunately for us, we didn’t use much of it
on our trip. Coming home through customs, our
bags were searched, and the mysterious white
powder was subject to — ahem — intense
scrutiny.

Researching your destination
Do yourself a favor and spend some time researching the area before you go
on your trip. You can always find grocery stores or markets, restaurants, and
fast-food places, all of which will have at least some things you can eat. But
you may do even better than that. Local support groups, Internet chat sites,
and listservs may be able to steer you in the direction of gluten-free-friendly
restaurants and stores, and researching what’s typically available in the area
can tell you how much food to bring and how much you can get while you’re
there. (A listserv is an e-mail list that allows people to post questions,
answers, and other types of information targeted to a specific audience. You
can find more information about the celiac listserv in Chapter 5.)
If, in doing your homework, you find health food stores or natural foods
stores in the area of your destination, call ahead and ask what they carry in
the way of gluten-free specialty items. You may be surprised to find they have
a huge array. If not, ask whether they would consider stocking a few items for
you, and let them know when you’ll be arriving.
Sprechen zie gluten? Speaking 
gluten-free in other countries
Knowing some key words in the language of the country you’re visiting is
important. For instance, “flour” in Spanish is harina. But that can refer to
corn flour or wheat flour, so you have to further distinguish what you’re talk-
ing about by saying harina de maiz (corn flour) or harina de trigo (wheat
flour). Learn the words for gluten, with, without, no, and allergy. Check out
Table 16-1 for some key words in Spanish, French, and German.

Restaurant cards that explain the gluten-free diet are available in different lan-
guages; a quick Internet search should turn those up. And you can also use
translation software, like the Babel Fish translation at www.altavista.com
and others you find on the Internet.
Choosing gluten-free-friendly 
accommodations
Where you stay can make your vacation a much more enjoyable experience.
If possible, choose accommodations with a kitchen or kitchenette, like a
condo or extended-stay hotel. Even a small fridge and microwave can make
your trip a lot easier. That way, you can go to a local grocery store and stock
up on some essentials, like fruit, milk, popcorn, deli meats, and snack items.
If you have a full kitchen at your disposal, you can prepare your own meals if
you want to, sparing yourself the worry of eating at restaurants — not to
mention the expense.
If you don’t have a kitchen, try to find accommodations that have a restau-
rant attached or that have several restaurants nearby. You can call the hotel
restaurant in advance and have the staff fax or e-mail you the menu so you
can discuss items you may be able to enjoy. Some restaurants may even work
with you to accommodate your dietary needs during your stay.
If your accommodations are near several national restaurant chains, you can
look up their Web sites and see whether they have menus online. You may
even be surprised to find an online gluten-free menu.
Packing your own provisions
You may want to bring your kitchen in your suitcase (everything but the
kitchen sink!). Depending on where you’re going and for how long, your
kitchen-in-a-suitcase may include some of the following items:
280
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 

 Baking mixes (pancakes, cookies, cakes, brownies, bread)
 Bread slicer or serrated knife
 Cereals that may be hard to find
 Cookies
 Crackers and snack items that may be hard to find
 Pans to make the baked goods
 Pasta
 Pizza crusts (these sometimes need to be refrigerated)
 Sliced bread
 Toaster bags (see the tip under “Having restaurants cook the food you
bring”)
 Toaster or toaster oven
With any luck, the foods will survive the trip and you’ll arrive fully prepared
to enjoy your gluten-free stay.
If you don’t want to lug the whole kitchen and pantry with you, consider
sending your foods ahead. Either pack them up and send them in a box to
your final destination or order them online and have them shipped to where
you’re going. Hotels and condominiums usually accept packages if you
clearly mark the guest name and date of arrival on the box.
Getting there
Truly, getting there can be half the fun, and if you don’t believe me, rent an
old Chevy Chase “Vacation” DVD and see for yourself. Just don’t expect
model Christy Brinkley to be part of your getting-there plans.
Whether you’re doing it by plane, train, automobile, or cruise ship, you need
to consider the journey itself in your gluten-free plans.
Flying the friendly skies
First rule for flying: Bring food for yourself. You may find that airport food
and what they serve on the airplane is limited in its gluten-free selections.
Airports do usually have fast-food restaurants, so if you know which fast foods
are gluten-free, you can always go there if you want or need to. Some of the
kiosks and cafés sell yogurt, fruit, and salads, and some airports have large
restaurant chains where you can order as you would in any other restaurant.
281
Chapter 16: Getting Out and About: Eating Away from Home

Some airlines allow you to make a request for a gluten-free meal. If you do
this, take food just in case. Sometimes you’ll be served a meal that isn’t
remotely close to being gluten-free, and you want to be prepared for that.
And many airlines are replacing their packets of peanuts with pretzels
because so many people have peanut allergies. Sitting for hours on an air-
plane when you’re starved, smelling everyone else’s fresh, hot bread is pretty
miserable. Sometimes, though, you’ll be thrilled to find that they do accom-
modate the gluten-free diet. We were once served gluten-free rolls, individu-
ally packaged with the ingredients clearly labeled! To hear us cheer, you
would have thought we had won the lottery.
Cruising the high seas
Cruise lines are extremely accommodating when it comes to dietary restric-
tions of any type. Most of the cruise lines I’ve looked into are very familiar
with the gluten-free diet and even stock specialty items like gluten-free
breads, pastas, cookies, and baked goods.
If you’re planning a cruise, call ahead and ask to speak with the executive
chef for the line you’re going to be on. Discuss the gluten-free diet with him
or her — if the chef isn’t familiar with the diet, fax or e-mail the guidelines
and follow up with a phone call to discuss the specifics of what you’ll want
while you’re on board.
If for some reason you don’t want to call ahead, you’re probably still set.
Most cruise lines offer healthy fare like fresh seafood, chicken, steaks, fruit,
and vegetables. Have a talk with the chef when you’re on board about conta-
mination issues and special seasonings so he or she can make sure every
meal’s exceptional and gluten-free.
Taking the train
If you’re taking the train somewhere, your best bet is to bring your own food.
Rail lines usually don’t have any restrictions about bringing your own food,
so load up. The cafés on trains rarely have much that’s gluten-free other than
chips and maybe hot dogs (but usually they’re pre-bunned); instead, the
cafés usually serve packaged sandwiches, croissants, muffins, pastries,
pizzas, and other oh-so-nutritious-and-not-even-close-to-being-gluten-free
goodies. You don’t want to derail your trip by starving the whole way.
Traveling near or far by car
Driving offers you the most flexibility, so it’s often the easiest way to travel, at
least in terms of accommodating your gluten-free diet. (The kids fighting and
asking, “Are we almost there?” the entire way is another matter.)
No matter what country you’re in, chances are you’ll pass a McDonald’s
every 6.8 seconds, and even if you’re spared the golden arches scenery, you
can always find restaurants of some kind along the way.

t’s one thing when adults need or choose to adopt a gluten-free lifestyle.
It’s an entirely different ballgame when your kids need to be gluten-free.
Believe me, I know. I’m the mom(my) (I’ll never let go of that!) of a happy,
healthy, gluten-free kid.
Our son Tyler was almost 2 when he was diagnosed with celiac disease. That
was back in 1991. (If you care to read our entire story, you can find it in
Chapter 1.)
The abridged version is that he was sick, but the doctors didn’t think so.
They kept telling us nothing was wrong, even though he had severe diarrhea,
his belly was growing distended, he was growing listless and lethargic, and
his personality was changing before our very eyes.
Four pediatricians; a pediatric gastroenterologist; preliminary diagnoses of
cystic fibrosis, cancer, or a blood disease; thousands of diarrhea diapers; and
nearly one year later, we heard the bittersweet words that changed our lives
forever: “Your son has celiac disease.” We were shocked, panicked, mad, sad,
glad, confused, frustrated, and terrified to feed our own child. And that was
all within the first 2.4 seconds of hearing those words.

I’ve loaded this chapter with information to help you deal with your roller-
coaster emotions, the practicalities of having kids on the gluten-free diet, and
the psychological impact this may have on your family; I even give you a
glimpse into the wonderful world of Terrific Teens who are avoiding gluten.
Before I dive in, I feel compelled to give away the most important message of
all (so much for teasing you into reading the whole chapter!): Getting the
diagnosis is a good thing in your child’s life and yours. If you’re having trou-
ble believing me, read on.
Forging through the Feelings
Everything’s different when your child’s the one on the gluten-free diet: The
feelings you feel, the way you communicate about the diet, the resentment
you feel toward parents who don’t have to make special accommodations
just to feed their child, the preparations you make to go anywhere, the way
you shop, the foods you buy, the school lunches, the resentment toward
other parents (oops, that must be a biggie).
If you’re a parent — or someone who loves a child as a parent would — and
your child has to (for health or behavioral reasons) adopt a strict, gluten-free
diet, then your emotions probably resemble a sine wave. You know: up one
minute, crashing the next, as in Figure 17-1. It seems like just when you’re
feeling great about the diet, the lifestyle, and all the benefits that go along
with it, you find out the kids had a birthday party at school, and your child
was the only one without a cupcake. Your emotions go from flying high to a
terminal-velocity free fall.
"My child's life
is changed
forever."
"This is a
good thing
in our
lives."
"This is a
good thing
in our
lives."
"I don't want
him to feel
different."
"Will he turn
out okay?"
"This is a
good thing
in our
lives."

284
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 

I talk in Chapter 18 about the emotional obstacles you may face when you
switch to a gluten-free lifestyle. To quantify what the change feels like when
your kid has to go gluten-free, as opposed to you, take the magnitude of those
emotions, multiply by 100, square that, and add an exponential factor of infin-
ity, and you’ll be close.
In addition to the emotions I talk about in Chapter 18, you face other worries —
nagging concerns that distress you because your child’s most affected. See
whether some of these strike a familiar chord.
“My child’s life is changed forever”
Yep. That’s true. And forever seems like a really long time, doesn’t it? What
happened to those visions you have for your children — the perfect life,
where things are easy and magical? Well, for one thing, that’s not reality.
285
Chapter 17: Raising Happy, Healthy, Gluten-Free Kids
Reaching out
I’ve always been acutely aware that Tyler may
not want to be the poster boy for celiac disease,
so I let him decide how involved he wants to be
in my activities. For the most part, because
being gluten-free has never been a big deal to
him, he’s opted to sit on the sidelines and let me
chirp, perk, and sing the praises of the gluten-
free lifestyle on my own.
One day, a few months after a local TV station
had interviewed Tyler, a woman who’d attended
one of our R.O.C.K. (Raising Our Celiac Kids)
parties approached my son (for more about
R.O.C.K., check out www.celiackids.com).
I watched with curiosity and felt somewhat pro-
tective and guarded as this stranger took one of
his hands in both of hers in what seemed like an
affectionate gesture. “Tyler, you have changed
my life,” she said.
Then 13 years old, he said nothing and shot an
anxious glance my way, looking for guidance, but
I was as bewildered as he was. She began to get
tears in her eyes as she continued. “I’m 65 years
old. Three months ago, I was sick as could be. I’d
been to dozens of doctors and had a list of symp-
toms a mile long — everyone thought I was
crazy. I even had to quit my job because I was so
sick. I truly wanted to die. Then I saw you on TV
talking about celiac disease. I insisted on being
tested and tested positive. I’ve been gluten-free
ever since and feel absolutely wonderful.” With
that, she gave him a bear hug, and he shot me a
glance that I couldn’t read.
I’ve learned not to embarrass my kids (well,
sometimes I do it intentionally, but that’s another
matter), so I said nothing, and Tyler went about
his business. Several minutes later, Tyler
approached me with a beaming smile. “Mom,
now I know why you do this! It feels really good
to help other people!”
He has since decided that he’s blessed to have
celiac disease, because it has provided him with
an opportunity to reach out and help others —
an act that even at his young age he realizes is
more satisfying for him than for those he’s help-
ing. Quite a perspective for a teenage boy, if I
may indulge in a brief mommy brag!

People forget to dream about the hardships their kids will face and how
they’ll handle the difficulties in their lives. Yet how your children handle
adversity is one of the most important lessons your children will ever learn.
This is a chance for them to find out at an early age how to turn adversity
into advantage.
Furthermore, what you may initially see as difficulty may actually be a good
thing in your child’s life (and yours). See the “Focusing on the good stuff” sec-
tion for more information.
“I don’t want her to feel different”
You envision your kids’ lives as being smooth and painless, and part of that
means fitting in. But kids are different in many ways, and although I’m not
downplaying the importance of food and the part it plays in everything
people do, your kids’ differences are okay.
Kids are all different — some kids have blond hair, others have red; some
prefer baseball to ballet; some are in wheelchairs, and others wear glasses.
To pine away for her conformity is to send a signal that something about
being different in this (gluten-free) way is bad. The last thing you want to do
is send that message.
Parents worry that their kids won’t fit in or won’t be accepted because of
their “different” diet, but kids can fit in regardless of what they’re eating.
Fitting in has much more to do with their attitude than anything else.
“Will he turn out okay?”
No, he’ll be better-than-okay, because he’s healthy! But I agonized over this
same thing when Tyler was first diagnosed.
Oh, sure, friends and family told me, “It’ll be okay,” the way friends and family
do in tough situations. But I felt they were just placating me — after all, what
did they know? They hadn’t even heard of celiac disease before I explained
the diagnosis. And to be honest, I didn’t care much at that time about what
adults thought of the situation — I wanted desperately to hear it from a kid: “I
turned out just fine!”
The truth is, being gluten-free has never been a big deal for my son. We started
giving Tyler control of his diet from day one, which I believe is crucial. We’ve
always maintained an optimistic yet realistic approach, with Tyler and his
286
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 

(non-celiac-but-oh-so-supportive) sister Kelsie being our guiding lights in terms
of inspiration and positive attitudes. So rest easy, parents. Your kids will, in
fact, be just fine. And so will you.
“This is harder for me than it is for her”
If you love a child the way a parent does (even if you’re not the actual parent,
but are, nonetheless, as emotionally entwined as a parent is), then you can
comprehend the this-hurts-me-more-than-it-hurts-you Pain Amplification
Phenomenon (PAP). Seeing a bloody knee or a broken heart truly causes
pain — palpable pain — for the grown-ups who love that child.
Those of you who are agonizing over the fact that your child has been diag-
nosed with a condition that requires a strict, lifelong, gluten-free diet may
have trouble accepting this idea at first, but believe me: Dealing with the
diagnosis is harder for you than it is for your child.
Your dreams for your child’s future make you think having to be gluten-free is
hard on her — you envision her skipping merrily down the road of life, not trip-
ping over food, for goodness’ sake. But kids don’t have visions for the future
like that. To a kid, a vision of her future may take her to the next baseball game
or her next allowance; it’s far more nearsighted than your vision for her.
In most cases, kids are resilient. They accept what life dishes out, and they
make the best of it. I think grown-ups should take note.
287
Chapter 17: Raising Happy, Healthy, Gluten-Free Kids
A kid’s perspective
I’d love for Tyler to write a few words telling you
how celiac disease is no big deal in his life,
because it’s really not. Tyler’s actually quite an
inspiration with an awesome perspective on
this. For my first book, Kids with Celiac Disease,
he wrote chapter one, “What It’s Like to Be a
Kid with Celiac Disease.” But that was before
he turned into a teenager and discovered he
isn’t supposed to want to do everything his par-
ents ask.
My son would tell you that he thinks more about
other stuff in his life — like friends, school, sports,
and family — than about gluten. He knows the
importance of being 100 percent gluten-free and
doesn’t cheat. He’s in control of what he eats and
makes sure when he’s away from home that he
has access to gluten-free food (although much to
my chagrin, that often consists of a candy bar or
chips).
In spreading the gospel of gluten-free for all
these years, I’ve had the opportunity to meet
with hundreds, if not thousands, of gluten-free
kids. With only a handful of exceptions, nearly
every one has been upbeat, optimistic, and
downright inspiring. So even if you don’t take it
from Tyler (channeling through me), take it from
all the others: Gluten-free kids ROCK!

If you don’t believe that this diagnosis is harder on you than it is on your
child, go up to a kid and ask what he thinks about in his life, and take notes.
He’ll mention things like “baseball,” “my best friend Sarah,” “riding my
horse,” “recess,” or any other number of answers. Go ahead — interview ten
other kids. I’m reasonably certain you won’t find any who answer “my diet.”
It’s just really not a priority — nor should it be.
Focusing on the good stuff
Being gluten-free may be a good thing in your child’s (and your) life for a lot of
reasons. I encourage you to make your own personal list to pull out when you
find yourself feeling frustrated or depressed. Here are a few to get you started:
 Your child has the key to better health. Most people who have celiac
disease or gluten sensitivity never know what’s wrong with them. They
don’t know that a dietary modification would fully restore their health,
so they continue to eat the very foods that make them sick.
 Your child will be less likely to develop associated conditions. Your
child has the advantage of being diagnosed early and going gluten-free at
an early age. That means his or her chances of developing associated
conditions (see Chapter 2) are far lower than for someone diagnosed
after years of being sick with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease.
 Chances are, she’ll learn to be tolerant of others’ sensitivities. In fact,
she may be more tolerant in general.
 He may have the opportunity to help someone else who has gluten
sensitivity or celiac disease. Remember, if 1,000 kids attend your child’s
school, about ten of them may have celiac disease — and even more
may have a form of gluten sensitivity. This awareness and opportunity to
spread this knowledge is an opportunity to help improve other people’s
lives.
 If your child has other dietary issues, like diabetes, controlling them
will be easier on the gluten-free diet. This is partly true because your
child is more aware of her diet and more in control of what she’s eating.
But it’s also true because, if done properly, the gluten-free diet can be
extremely nutritious. Using diabetes as an example, if you avoid most of
the high-glycemic-index foods (like the delicious gluten-free goodies
available today!) and stick to more of a Paleolithic approach (I go into
detail about this in Chapter 6), controlling blood-sugar levels can be far
easier than if your child were on a “regular” diet.
 If your child has behavioral issues in addition to gluten sensitivity or
celiac disease, chances are, they’ll improve. Sometimes, behavioral
issues are symptoms of gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, so
ADD/ADHD-type behaviors or the inability to concentrate may subside
or even completely go away when your child goes gluten-free.

Talking to Your Kids about Being 
Gluten-Free
Whether your child is 18 months or 18 years old, now’s the time to talk, and
the entire family needs to be included. How you do this depends on your
style, your intra-family relationships, and your child’s ability to understand
the intricacies of the subject matter. Talking to your kids is step one in
making sure they develop healthy attitudes and habits.
Including the whole family
Even if your entire family doesn’t choose to go gluten-free, having a gluten-
free kid in the house affects everyone. All the family members need to know
about your child’s condition, the diet, and how to handle a variety of situa-
tions that may arise.
I’m not suggesting that you organize an extended family reunion and include
fifth cousins thrice removed. But you do need to include your immediate
family in some type of discussion. Don’t think these talks need to take place
all at once; discussion is an ongoing process, and you’ll be talking about the
gluten-free lifestyle for months, if not years, to come.
Kids will be kids, and sibs will be sibs. Just because the brothers and sisters
understand the diet doesn’t mean they’ll always be kind. You may hear the
typical taunting — you know, the “I can eat this and you can’t” type of stuff.
Treat that teasing the same way you’d treat any other act that you don’t
approve of between siblings. Don’t let your feelings of sadness that your child
has this condition make you overreact to unkind gestures. Mean is mean, and
you should respond to meanness consistently.
289
Chapter 17: Raising Happy, Healthy, Gluten-Free Kids
I’m glad to be gluten-free because . . .
Sometimes before my talks, especially if a lot of
kids are attending, I take the kids aside and do a
little “Rappin’ with Danna” session, in which we
talk about their feelings about the gluten-free
lifestyle. Usually I ask them to finish this sen-
tence: “I’m glad to be gluten-free because . . .”
They come up with the most inspirational stuff!
Although most of the young ones talk about the
yummy gluten-free brownies and cookies they
get to eat, others are blatantly honest with
responses like “because I don’t have to eat my
mom’s gross casseroles anymore.” For fun, ask
your gluten-free kid to finish the sentence. I think
you’ll be delighted with the response you get
(unless you make really gross casseroles!).

Keeping the discussion upbeat
Everyone you talk to about the gluten-free lifestyle — and the conditions that
require it — finds out how to feel about the gluten-free lifestyle from you. Is
being gluten-free a bad thing in your life? A scary thing? Good thing? How you
talk about it has a far greater impact than you may know.
If you call a family meeting and gather somberly, you’re going to scare your
kid right out of her jammies and cast an impression of doom and gloom. This
conversation should be upbeat, lighthearted, and interactive — after all,
becoming gluten-free is a good thing in everyone’s life. If you can’t remember
why, go back to the preceding sections in this chapter or look at some of the
thoughts in Chapter 19.
The most important person to stay upbeat around is your child. For the rest
of her life, how she feels about being gluten-free depends on you and your
attitudes. She doesn’t know how to feel — this is all new to her (granted, it’s
new to you, too). Give her the advantage of starting off upbeat and optimistic.
If she’s like most kids, she’ll take it from there and will provide amazing
strength and inspiration.
Don’t make a huge deal out of needing to be gluten-free. As huge as it may seem
to you, chances are this isn’t going to be a huge deal in your child’s life . . .
unless you make it one.

Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 
Startled siblings
So you’re sitting down to have a family discus-
sion about Cassidy’s new gluten-free lifestyle,
and before your very eyes, her sister, Mild-
Mannered-Missy, turns into Bordering-on-
Ballistic-Barbie. What’s going on? You did your
best to frame everything in a positive way. Why
is she freaking out?
Don’t be surprised if you see this type of reac-
tion from the siblings in the family. Their being
scared, confused, and even a tinge panicked is
perfectly normal.
Siblings can be wondering all sorts of things: Is
my sister sick? Is she going to die? Am I going
to catch it? If she has to eat gross stuff, do I have
to eat it too? (Correct answer is that neitherof you
has to eat gross stuff!) How come she gets spe-
cial attention and I don’t? What if she gets better
stuff than I do? Why did this happen to our family?
And, most importantly, will my friends think I’m
weird because my sister eats different food?
Being aware that these reactions are typical
can help you respond in a sympathetic, under-
standing way. Address the feelings you suspect
the startled sibs are having, even if they’re not
able to articulate their anxieties, and encourage
them to tell you why the situation scares them.
Before you know it, everyone can relax and
you’ll have a more productive discussion.

Explaining the new lifestyle
The level of detail you get into depends on your child’s age, maturity, and
ability to understand this type of thing. In a nutshell, you want to give her the
“why” she’s gluten-free (to feel better), the “what” (what gluten-free means),
and the “what now” (what she can eat now that she’s gluten-free), which is
really most important, because that’s what matters most to her.
Be patient, and don’t try to rush explaining everything. Understanding and
accepting may not happen all at once but will more likely be an ongoing
process for all of you.
Focusing on the benefits
Chances are, your child has had health or behavioral issues that led to the
need for a gluten-free diet, so start the discussion with something positive
like, “You’re going to feel so much better now that you’re going to be eating
gluten-free foods!”
Kids think in specifics. Drive the point home to them with something they
can personally relate to, like, “You know how much your tummy’s been hurt-
ing lately?” or “You know how hard it is for you to focus in class?” — “You
won’t have that anymore now that you’re gluten-free!” Specifics can help chil-
dren understand exactly what’s going to be better on the gluten-free diet.
Then, a few weeks into the lifestyle, remember to point out to your kids how
much better they feel, thanks to the yummy gluten-free foods they’re eating.
291
Chapter 17: Raising Happy, Healthy, Gluten-Free Kids
Little ears are listening
When you’re talking to other grown-ups about
your child’s diet and condition, keep in mind that
your kid may be tuning in to every word you’re
saying. Sure, he may seem distracted with toys
or friends, and he may in fact be too busy to
hear what you’re saying. But kids have ears,
and they know how to use ’em (unless, of
course, you’re asking them to do the dishes).
Are you apologizing for the complexity of the
diet? That can make your child feel like a victim.
Are you complaining about the restrictions?
That may make him feel like a burden. Are you
feeling sorry for yourself? He’ll feel guilty for
encumbering you with the challenges this
lifestyle may present.
I’m not saying don’t vent — if you’re frustrated,
exhausted, or feeling overly burdened at the
moment, that’s fine, and having someone to
confide in is therapeutic. Just make sure little
ears aren’t listening.

Using big words and good explanations
Don’t underestimate what your kids can grasp. When explaining the diet to
your child, use the “big” words like gluten (spare them the carboxymethyl-
cellulose, though, okay?). Even if your child has developmental or learning
disabilities, use the proper terminology so that he can better communicate
what he can and can’t eat to others.
Of course, he’s not going to understand at first (did you?). Give him examples
he can understand — explain that “gluten is in lots of the foods we used to
eat, like bread, cookies, and crackers,” and then quickly let him know that lots
of yummy things don’t have gluten in them.
Offering gluten-free alternatives
Always focusing on what your child can have is important. Anytime you or
your child asks about or points out a food that’s off-limits, try to point out
something equally as scrumptious that’s gluten-free.
Of course, you’re not going to say, “You can’t have those cookies anymore,
Trevor, but look here! You can eat all the broccoli your little heart desires!”
That won’t win you any parent points, nor will little Trevor be likely to buy
into this new lifestyle with much zest. Instead, you can accomplish three
things at once here:
 Reward your child for grasping the diet
 Offer an alternative
 Reinforce that he can eat it because it’s gluten-free
A couple simple sentences do the trick: “You’re right, Trevor, you can’t eat
those cookies. But you can have this candy bar, because it’s gluten-free!”
Always be prepared to do the Treat Trade. When your child has a treat she
wants to eat but can’t because it has gluten, be ready to trade it for some-
thing equally as appealing — but of the gluten-free variety. Kids are relatively
easily distracted, and if you have some delectable goodies waiting in the
wings as a Treat Trade, you’re sure to turn that frown upside down.
Reinforcing the idea that gluten
makes your child feel icky
Help your child make the connection that gluten makes him feel bad. You
should use this in a couple of situations — first, whenever you talk about
gluten: “You’re right, you can’t eat that. It has gluten, and gluten makes you
292
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 

feel icky.” This way, he learns to associate gluten with feeling bad — and
that’s a very good thing. To state all this scientifically, the desire to cheat is
inversely proportional to the realization that gluten makes you sick, as shown
in Figure 17-2. When you can chart something, it must be true, right?
The other time you may want to point out the effects of gluten — and this is
where a bit of prevarication comes in — is when your child doesn’t feel good —
for just about any reason. This works best for younger kids, usually about 6
and under. And it only works if you really don’t know exactly what’s making
your child feel bad — a tummy ache, for instance. You may know full well that
her discomfort has nothing to do with gluten, but seize the opportunity to say,
“I’m sorry you don’t feel well. We must have goofed, and you accidentally got
some gluten. We’ll have to be more careful next time.”
The chances that she’ll sneak gluten (or even want it, for that matter) are
inversely proportional to the clarity of this association between gluten and
not feeling well.
Chances are, your child is trying really hard to stick to the diet. Make sure
your child doesn’t feel like he’s done something wrong by goofing. Point out
that we all make mistakes and that gluten can be hidden in all sorts of things.
It just means you have to be super careful in the future.
When kids who have celiac disease get tummy aches, you may jump to the
conclusion that they feel sick because they got gluten, and you find yourself
agonizing over what the culprit may have been. But remember, kids get
tummy aches! They can be caused by all kinds of different things, but for the
most part, they’re a normal part of growing up. It’s important to be diligent
about the diet and, when you see a gluten reaction, to figure out what caused
it. But sometimes tummy aches and other types of gastrointestinal distress
are just normal parts of being a kid.

Chapter 17: Raising Happy, Healthy, Gluten-Free Kids

Handling your child’s reaction
You can’t predict how your child will respond when you first start talking to
him about his new gluten-free lifestyle. His reaction will depend on how you
present the diet, his age, maturity, level of understanding, ability to express
his feelings, and of course, his personality.
You probably realize that if he shows anger, hostility, or other “negative”
emotions, you should be soothing, understanding, and supportive — those
parental responses are natural.
Don’t think, though, that the initial “upset” reaction is going to stick. It’s most
likely a fleeting response that, as time passes and your child becomes accus-
tomed to the new lifestyle, will evolve into a more positive outlook. Continue
to remind him of the benefits he can look forward to now that his body is 
getting healthy by eating gluten-free foods.
Be prepared for little or no response. Appearing to be indifferent or apathetic
is not unusual for kids. Don’t read too deeply and assume this reaction is a
“cover” for deep, disturbing thoughts — chances are, it’s an honest response
to a somewhat confusing issue or a reaction to something that truly doesn’t
seem to matter much at the time.
Helping your kids talk to others 
about the diet
Your kids need to learn to talk to other people — both adults and other kids —
about their gluten-free lifestyle. They’ll be doing it for the rest of their lives, and
there’s no time to start like the present. Of course, exactly what they say and
how they communicate it will depend on their age, personality, style, who
they’re talking to, and how comfortable they are talking about this type of
thing.
Explaining what they can and can’t have
Teach your child a phrase to use, even if he’s too young to know what it
means. Use something comprehensive that he can repeat to adults.
For instance, teach him to say, “I can’t eat gluten. That means I don’t eat
wheat, rye, barley, malt, and oats.” I know that definition isn’t technically 
correct (malt is from barley, and oats are gluten-free but sometimes contami-
nated), but it tells adults what they need to know.
294
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 

Maybe that one’s too cumbersome; but if your child can handle it, go with it.
If not, find one that’s more age-appropriate or one that suits your child’s per-
sonality. The idea behind the memorized “sound bite” is that it covers a lot of
bases with a relatively easy couple of sentences.
Of course, the more children can add, the better. If your child can explain to
people exactly what she can and can’t eat, that’s terrific — and if she can add
the fact that gluten makes her feel bad, that’s better yet. Before long, your
child will figure out what works best for her.
Teach your kid to be open and conversant about being gluten-free. I’m not
suggesting you and your child walk into a room, grab a microphone, clear
your throats, and begin proselytizing about the gluten-free lifestyle (even
though that’s what I do!). Nor do you want your child to feel he’s entitled to
have people accommodate his diet. But informing people (especially those
who may be involved in feeding him) is important, and you can do this in a
friendly, informative manner. You may find that your child becomes an effec-
tive awareness-spreading advocate before you know it.
Some kids feel more comfortable simplifying their explanation to something
people can understand more easily, like, “I’m allergic to gluten,” or even “I’m
allergic to wheat.” Even though that explanation’s not technically correct,
sometimes it’s easier. Just make sure your kids know the real facts so they
don’t get confused later on.
Teaching kids to say “no thanks”
No matter how well your child communicates the fact that he can’t eat
gluten, some people will, usually with the best of intentions, offer him some-
thing with gluten.
This can be really confusing to your child, especially if the sweet-slipping-
someone happens to be a loved one who folds a cookie into your child’s
hand and says with a conspiratorial just-between-you-and-me wink, “Don’t
tell Mommy and Daddy.” Yikes! What’s a gluten-free kid to do?
Explain to your child how and why this type of a situation may come up, and
most importantly, how to handle it. Sometimes saying “no thanks” or “I
appreciate it, but I can’t eat that” is easy for a child. Other times, it’s easier
and more conciliatory just to accept the treat and not eat it.
Even if your friends and family won’t be offering him gluten, someone out
there will. You can spare your child disappointment and confusion if you help
her deal with this type of situation before it comes up (and remember to
bring gluten-free treats with you to the mall at the holidays so you can do the
Treat Trade in case you’re accosted by well-intentioned elves!).

Deciding Whether the Whole Family
Should Be Gluten-Free
Many people assume that because one child is gluten-free, the entire family
should adopt the lifestyle. After all, wouldn’t it be cruel to be feasting on
donuts while your gluten-free child is choking down rice cakes? Yeah, it would.
But having the entire family go gluten-free isn’t always the right answer,
either. You really have to weigh both sides of the issue and consider the prac-
tical and psychological issues.
The pros
Here are some advantages if everyone goes gluten-free:
 You make only one version of each meal. Rather than making a gluten-
free version and a “regular” version of some dishes at mealtime, you can
make just one gluten-free version and be done with it.
 You shop only for gluten-free foods. You can skip the bread and cracker
aisles altogether.
 There’s no risk of contamination in the kitchen. You also don’t have to
learn the gob drop (check out Chapter 7).
 Your child doesn’t feel different. It’s okay to be different, but it’s also
nice to feel the same, especially when it comes to being family.
 The pantry is filled with “safe” foods. You don’t have to worry that you
or your child accidentally grabs a gluten-laden snack, because you don’t
have any.
 Your child isn’t tempted to cheat. At least not at home.
The cons
I’m trying to offer both sides here, but if you sense that the cons list is a little
weightier than the pros list, you’re right. Ultimately, in my opinion, the cons
outweigh the pros of having the entire family go gluten-free:
 A gluten-free world is not reality. Your child needs to understand that
the rest of the world eats gluten. They’re not doing it to make him feel
296
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 

bad; they’re not doing it to ostracize him; there are no malicious or evil
intentions. What better environment to learn that important lesson than
in a loving, supportive home?
 Your child doesn’t find out how to make food choices. Knowing how to
choose which foods he can eat and which he can’t is important for your
child. If the pantry’s free of “no-nos,” he doesn’t need to decide. He may
become complacent about mindlessly grabbing food without giving a
thought to whether it’s gluten-free.
 It can create resentment among other family members. Siblings —
even parents — can be a little bitter about having to give up bread and
bagels if they don’t have a health condition that requires it. They can
direct that resentment toward your gluten-free child, and that sets up
an unhealthy family dynamic.
 Your child isn’t tempted to cheat. Although this may sound like more
of a pro than a con (it’s really both), I believe that teaching your child
to resist the temptation (especially because gluten is practically every-
where) is better than never tempting him or her.
 Eating a lot of specialty foods can be more expensive. I’m not advocat-
ing eating lots of specialty foods, but if you do, I think you’ll agree that
you’d rather save the $5 loaf of bread for your gluten-free child.
Middle ground
Sometimes a compromise is the best solution. See whether these ideas work
for your family:
 Make most meals gluten-free. If you can make the majority of your
meals gluten-free and still please everyone without using up your worth-
their-weight-in-gold gluten-free specialty items, do so. This can make
cooking and preparation easier, and everyone will be able to enjoy the
same meals.
 Buy gluten-free condiments and staples. Using gluten-free salad dress-
ings, soy sauce, and other staple or condiment-type items makes life a
lot easier on you — and you don’t have to make separate stir-fries just
because one of them has the gluten kind of soy sauce on it.
 Enjoy the delicious gluten-free baked goods. Most of the mixes these
days for cookies, cakes, brownies, and other baked goods are as good as
the real deal. They’re a little more expensive, maybe, but cost aside, you
really have no reason to make separate batches of these things. Make
one batch of the gluten-free kind and let the entire family enjoy.
297
Chapter 17: Raising Happy, Healthy, Gluten-Free Kids

Giving Your Child Control of the Diet
If your child doesn’t take control of his diet, the diet will control him. No
matter how young he is, he needs to learn from day one to make decisions
about what he can and can’t eat — and how important it is not to cheat, no
matter how tempted he is.
From a psychological standpoint, it’s important that the gluten-free diet
doesn’t take front-and-center-stage in your child’s life — and that means she
should be thinking of other things most of the time. But when it comes time
to eat, she needs to realize how important it is that she makes good choices.
Food is something she needs to pay close attention to.
A wise proverb says, “Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach
him to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.” You need to teach your kids to
choose foods they can eat for a lifetime. Giving your child control of the diet
also creates bonuses for everyone:
 Your child has confidence. He knows that even if you’re not there, he’s
able to eat safely because he can make healthy food choices.
 You can relax. You know that even if you’re not there, your child is pre-
pared to make good food choices. And if you are there, you don’t have to
be doing all the decision-making.
 Your child is learning the importance of healthful eating. How many
kids read food labels or give even a first thought (much less a second) to
what they’re putting in their mouths? Your child is learning to be con-
scious of nutrition at an early age, which is a valuable lifelong lesson.
298
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 
How do gluten-free kids feel when others
eat gluten around them?
I’ve asked dozens of kids this question: “Does it
make you feel bad when other people eat gluten
around you?” Admittedly, I’ve heard the occa-
sional pauses or hesitations — maybe even a
thoughtful consideration and a “sometimes” here
and there. But nearly all the kids I’ve asked —
including my own — have said no. It doesn’t
bother them. They liketheir food, and if you do the
diet right, they should! The food tastes good!
Now I have to tell you that it used to break my
heart when my son was about 4 years old and he
would ask to smell the “real” pizza. I’d ask him
why he wanted to do that — assuming, of course,
that he was pining away for some, wishing he
could eat it, and getting as close to consumption
as he could without actually chewing. But he
matter-of-factly answered, “I’m just curious.”

Working together to make good choices
When I say to give your child control, I’m not suggesting you let her make all
the decisions by herself — like everything else in life, children need a little
guidance, especially at first. You can do lots of things together to help kids
learn how to make good food choices.
 Read labels together. Even if your child is too young to read, pretend.
Hold the ingredients label where you can both see it, and go through
the ingredients out loud, one by one (just like when you’re tired and
reading them bedtime stories, you can skip the superfluous stuff).
Point to the words, and when you come to pertinent ones, like wheat,
remind them, “Nope. This one has gluten in it.” And then, because you’re
well-conditioned to quickly point to the alternative, follow up with,
“Let’s try this one,” and grab something you know is gluten-free.
 Make a game out of it. When you’re reading labels or talking about
foods, see who can decide which one is gluten-free (or not) first. (Note
to those of you competitive types: Let ’em win a few.)
 Have your child call manufacturers. (This works best if your child is
old enough to talk.) After she’s seen you do it a few times, let your child
make the calls. Sometimes being on another extension so you can take
over is a good idea.
 Have your child plan the menu. Not only does this give him a chance to
practice figuring out what’s gluten-free and what isn’t, but you know he’ll
actually eat everything he’s served. So what if his menu consists of
french fries, rice, candy bars, and gluten-free macaroni and cheese? Go
with it. Remember, for that meal at least, he’s in control.
 Have your child pack his lunch. If it’s not perfectly nutritionally bal-
anced, make some suggestions and see whether he’ll add the nutritious
stuff you want. If not, go with it. It won’t kill him to have one bad meal —
but it will let him know he can choose foods that are gluten-free (and
yummy!).
 Let your child cook. Kids love to cook, even though it usually ends up
being far more work than if they don’t help. Figuring out how to cook at
an early age is important for all kids, especially for those who will be
requiring some specially prepared foods for the rest of their lives.
Trusting kids when you’re not there
Letting g-g-g-g-go is one of the hardest things parents ever do; yet it’s your job
as a parent. On a daily basis, you’re preparing your children for life so you
can eventually set them free. If you do your job well, you can rest easy know-
ing they have all the tools they need to make decisions that’ll lead to safe,
happy, healthy lives.
299
Chapter 17: Raising Happy, Healthy, Gluten-Free Kids

The idea behind giving your kids control of their diet is that they need to
know how to feed themselves, because you won’t always be there. You don’t
have much of a problem giving them control of certain things — going potty
by themselves, washing their hands, and using the VCR. But when it comes to
choosing foods — and those foods could make them really sick — trusting
that they’ll make safe choices is hard!
You’ll know when the time is right and when you can actually relax knowing
they’re making safe food choices. It’ll most likely be way before you expect it
and maybe way before you’re ready.
Your children are going to make mistakes. Mistakes won’t kill or permanently
harm them, and with any luck, it’ll cause some discomfort so they realize the
importance of being more attentive.
Hitting the Road with 
the Gluten-Free Gang
Living life in a bubble is for helium molecules. Your child’s life shouldn’t be
restricted just because he’s on a restricted diet!
Really, getting out and about with gluten-free kids isn’t much different from the
way adults do it: You still follow the “Golden Rules of Going Out,” tips for
travel are the same, and ordering at restaurants isn’t much different, except
you may be ordering from a kids’ menu instead of an adult one. I cover all
these things in detail in Chapter 16, so for the most part, if you master the gen-
eral ideas of that chapter, you’ll do great getting out and about with the kids.
I do have a few suggestions that are specific to getting out with gluten-free kids:
 Let your child order for himself. At first this may be cumbersome,
because he’s likely to order chicken nuggets or spaghetti, assuming it’s
the gluten-free kind he eats at home. Don’t worry about taking a long
time or bothering the server. Figuring out how to order at a restaurant is
really important for your child, and actually doing it is an important part
of the learning process.
 Don’t be shy. Some kids are mortified when adults “make a scene” (I call
it “asking a question”) at a restaurant. All I have to do is say, “Could I ask
you about this menu item . . .” and the eyes start rolling, the “Oh boy,
here she goes” comments start spewing forth, and I have, my children
accuse me, scarred them for life. Ignore your kids and ask anyway. If
they won’t, you need to.
 Consider bringing dessert for your child. You can’t assume the
desserts at a restaurant are gluten-free, so just in case they don’t have
any, either bring your own or go somewhere else for dessert.

Leaving Your Gluten-Free Kids
in the Care of Others
Leaving your kids with other people is scary enough, even when your kids
don’t have dietary limitations that can make them sick. But trusting someone
else to safely feed your gluten-free child? Yikes! Letting go of a little parental
control can be frightening, but spending time apart is an important part of
growing up for both kids and parents.
Trusting your kids with friends,
family, and sitters
The most important thing you can do to ensure your kids will be in good hands
from a gluten-free standpoint is to educate the people caring for your child.
You may want to check out Chapter 16 to find out how to talk with others and
how to assess whether they really “get it.” If you suspect they don’t fully under-
stand the diet, work harder to make sure they do or find a new caretaker.
When you leave your kid in someone else’s care, try to bring or leave pre-
pared food as often as you can, and clearly mark on containers that the food
is gluten-free. That prevents any mix-up between your child’s food and some-
one else’s.
Sending your children to school
Because they’re away at school for several hours at a time, day after day,
sending your gluten-free kids to school is one of the biggest challenges you
face. Here are some tips:
 Educate your teachers, nurse, nutritionist, and principal. In fact, edu-
cate as much of the staff as possible. Not only will the staff be better pre-
pared to deal with your child and his diet, but chances are, they have
other kids at the school who need to be gluten-free and don’t know it
yet. You may have an enormous positive impact on those kids as well!
 Give the teacher a stash of treats for your child. Nothing’s worse than
finding out at the end of the day that it was Ashley’s birthday and your
daughter ate nothing while the other kids smeared cupcakes all over
their faces. Bring bags of Halloween-sized candy packages that the
teacher can store in a special place for your child in case of a surprise
party or an event that involves treats.

 Be aware of craft time. Play-Doh has gluten in it, and although kids
aren’t supposed to be eating it, show me one kid who can resist. I know I
couldn’t! Other crafts involve gluten-containing cereals, and those activi-
ties often become a matter of “one for the necklace, one for me . . . one
for the necklace, one for me.” Make sure your teacher and your child are
paying attention at craft time.
 Work with the nutrition department. Teachers or principals can help
you find contact information. Buying lunch even once a week may be a
big deal to your child. Most nutrition departments are willing to work
with you to find ways your child can eat at least one meal each week.
There’s something cool about standing in that line.
 Beware of the Eating Exchange. Swapping food in school lunches is
very serious business. Kids get right down to it, swapping egg salad for
PB&J or bananas for cookies (not a fair trade). Talk to your child about
how important not trading food is — even if someone else’s food looks
okay, it may not be (not to mention the fact that your kid’s just going to
give away those $4 cookies you bought). Ask the lunchtime supervisors
to be on the lookout and make sure your child doesn’t participate in the
Eating Exchange.

Party time!
Parties are supposed to be all about fun! But to
parents, parties sometimes seem like they’re all
about food. Apparently there’s a new law that
requires all children’s parties to be held at pizza
places with dancing animals on a stage. For a
mere $15 per child, parents can host a party that
lasts all of about an hour, stuffs the kids with
pizza and cake, and scares the little ones who
are smart enough to realize that bears shouldn’t
be playing guitars. So what about that pizza and
cake? Do you let party time turn to pouty time?
Nope. Try some of these ideas:
 Make sure your child eats before he goes.
If he’s full, he won’t be thinking about food,
and it won’t be as big of a deal.
 If you know the only food served will have
gluten, bring your own. If possible, bring
something close to what they’re serving —
gluten-free pizza, for instance (be careful —
the ovens at pizza places blow the flour all
around, so cover it carefully if you’re going
to have them warm it).
 If the party is at a restaurant that may have
gluten-free food available, ask the host
ahead of time whether you can order sep-
arately. This isn’t the least bit rude, and your
host will probably be happy to help you with
the details.
 If it’s your child’s party, serve gluten-free
foods. This may sound like a no-brainer, but
it’s not. Don’t, however, try to serve gluten-
free pizza or something else that may
cause that one kid (you know which one
I’m talking about) to spit it five feet and ask,
“What is this?” Serve hot dogs or ham-
burgers, and maybe do sundaes that kids
can build themselves for dessert.

For a manual that thoroughly covers everything — snack and lunch ideas,
talking with school staff, managing craft time, and dealing with bullies — I
suggest you read Kids with Celiac Disease: A Family Guide to Raising Happy,
Healthy, Gluten-Free Children, by yours truly. You can also find information on
your legal rights regarding school lunches at public schools or at other
schools that receive public funding.
Guiding Your Gluten-Free Teens
You can’t push a teen any more than you can push a rope. By the time your
kids are teenagers, the best you can do is hope that you’ve laid a good founda-
tion and are still able to guide them in the direction you think they should go.
If your teen is newly diagnosed, the teen years can be a scary time for them.
They’re already going through many changes, and adopting a gluten-free
lifestyle is one change that they may think will cast them way beyond being
different and into the realm of being downright freaky.
If your teen has been diagnosed, even if that diagnosis happened years ago,
you may see your child evolve from one who was very accepting and easygo-
ing about the diet into one who fights it a little and may even cheat from time
to time.
All these responses are normal, if any definition of the word “normal” applies
to teenagers. You should handle these reactions with patience, understand-
ing, and communication on both sides.
Noticing changing symptoms
Now you see ’em, now you don’t; sometimes kids’ symptoms seem to do a
disappearing act during their teenage years — it’s usually referred to as a
honeymoon period. For some, the symptoms do go away — at least temporar-
ily. At this point, they may be tempted to devour a pizza. They think that
because they don’t feel symptoms, they’ll be okay. Not true! In fact, the whole
thing is just an illusion (like some of the other things that take place during
the teenage years!). Although your kids may not feel the effects, the gluten
still does damage.
For others, the symptoms don’t really go away but evolve into those traits
more characteristic in adults — headaches, fatigue, and depression, for
example. These teens, too, sometimes think their symptoms have disap-
peared, because what they used to associate with eating gluten — diarrhea,
for instance — is no longer their typical reaction. They may not realize
the headaches they get, or other symptoms, are also signs of their gluten
intolerance.
303
Chapter 17: Raising Happy, Healthy, Gluten-Free Kids

Understanding why teens 
may cheat on the diet
I cover the topic of cheating and being tempted to cheat on the gluten-free
diet in Chapter 18. But teens are a different animal, and they sometimes cheat
or want to cheat for different reasons. Really, by the time kids become teens,
parents really can’t stop them from putting something in their mouths. But
knowing why they want to cheat so you can be sympathetic and have an
open discussion with them may help.
No longer is their desire simply a matter of “I want it, so I think I’ll eat it.”
With teens, they may want to eat gluten because of
 Peer pressure: At no time in their lives is peer pressure greater than
when kids are teenagers. Even if their friends aren’t pushing them to eat
gluten (they don’t usually do that), your teen may just want to be like
everyone else and be tempted to cheat on the diet.
Kids love to proclaim how they want to be unique, but they really don’t
want to be different, and this diet may make them feel different. Don’t be
surprised if your teen orders a burger with a bun just to be like his buds.
 Rebellion: Your teen may be tempted to eat gluten as a way of being
rebellious. Even if she doesn’t tell you about the incident, she may sub-
consciously be exerting her control. Sort of an “I’ll show you who’s in
control” type of behavior.
 Curiosity: A child who’s curious about what gluten tastes like may actu-
ally have more restraint than a curious teen. Even if your teen’s been
diligent about following the diet for years, he’s most likely to succumb in
the teenage years.
 Weight control: Many teens figure out that if they eat gluten, they aren’t
absorbing all the available calories. Sadly, some intentionally cheat on
the diet in an effort to lose weight.
Watch for signs of eating disorders in your kids. Sometimes they become
obsessed with their restrictions and take them too far — or they use gluten
as a means of losing weight. Address this issue immediately, as eating disor-
ders are extremely serious issues.
So what do you do about your cheatin’ teen? The best you can do is to have a
two-way conversation. Try to find out why she cheated and what the conse-
quences were, if she felt any. Educate her about what’s happening to her
body and remind her that even if she doesn’t feel the effects of gluten, she’s
still doing tremendous harm to her body.

Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 

Helping teens after they move out
One of the hardest things for teens to handle, especially if they’re new to the
gluten-free lifestyle, is moving out. Being on their own actually isn’t quite as
tough as if they move into college dorms, where a meal plan and a lack of
transportation can limit them to the food in the dining halls. In either case,
make sure your child fully understands the diet and can choose foods that
are healthy and gluten-free.
If your child lives on campus and has to eat in dining halls, have him contact
the dining services office or the food service manager to discuss his dietary
needs. Many of the available foods will already be gluten-free — and many
won’t. He may need to bring his own soy sauce, for instance, or otherwise
modify what he’s eating.
Having access to a fridge and even a full kitchen is helpful. Work with housing
or residential services to make sure he has access at least to a microwave
and refrigerator so he can store foods he buys at the store. Student lounges
at dorms often have a microwave and/or fridge that students have access to
if they can’t have one in their room. Coming up with snacks and menus that
he can make in the microwave (even gluten-free pasta!) is relatively easy.
Check the dorm policies before buying a mini-refrigerator or microwave.
Some dorms that allow these appliances have size and power restrictions.
Care packages are sometimes the next-best thing to being there. Think about
sending some gluten-free goodies in time for midterms or finals, or better yet,
just to remind them you love ’em.

No, you really need help only when you’re facing challenges. And some people
feel that the gluten-free lifestyle is one big buncha challenges. Some of that
has to do with why they’re going gluten-free in the first place.
People who embark on a gluten-free lifestyle do so for one of a few reasons:
 It sounds like fun! Scrutinizing labels, deciphering code words, translat-
ing legal disclaimers provided by manufacturers’ customer service reps,
dodging carefully hidden sources of gluten . . . and best of all, no beer or
pizza! (This group includes authors of the bestseller How to Bring
Yourself Down When You’re Just Too Happy.)
 They think they should. They haven’t been diagnosed with any medical
conditions, or if they have been tested, their tests came back negative.
But they suspect they’d feel better on a gluten-free diet, or they believe
the lifestyle is healthier. Or maybe they just want to support a loved one
who’s going gluten-free.
 They have to. They’ve been diagnosed with a medical condition that
requires it.

Guess which groups have the easiest time from a psychological perspective.
Bingo! When you choose to do something, you’re starting off with a huge
emotional advantage. Not only are you mentally prepared for the challenge,
but you’re welcoming the changes to come.
On the other hand, when someone tells you that you have to do something
(those of you in group three), you’re likely to have a harder time with it. (Think
back to your childhood when you were just getting ready to voluntarily clean
your room and just then your mom yelled, “Don’t forget to clean your room!”
Talk about a motivation-vacuum.) Toss in the unique social and practical chal-
lenges that arise when you’re living a gluten-free lifestyle, and some people find
themselves dealing with all sorts of complex emotional issues.
Okay, okay, so some people have accused me of being overly optimistic when
it comes to espousing the virtues of a gluten-free lifestyle. And I do, from my
very core, believe it’s the greatest dietary lifestyle on the planet. But I’m not
unrealistic — don’t forget, I’ve been there, done that. I’ve been living this
lifestyle for a very long time, and believe me, I’ve encountered my share of
emotional challenges, as most people do when they adopt a strict gluten-free
lifestyle. The idea is to find out how to identify those challenges and obsta-
cles and overcome them.
The key thing to remember is this: Deal with it; don’t dwell on it. You can be
mad, sad, uncomfortable, ticked off, and out-of-your-head ready to scream
with frustration. That’s okay. All those reactions and emotions, and the
others I talk about in this chapter, are perfectly normal when someone has
told you to change your entire life. But getting mired in the negativity and dif-
ficulty of it all is easy, in which case these feelings may begin to consume
you. Allow yourself to experience the tough emotions, and then move on.
In this chapter I discuss a bunch of different ways you can break out of the
negativity and see things in a more positive light. Yes, for some people this is
a difficult transition in life . . . but ultimately, you’ll be better for it.
Recognizing Common
Emotional Struggles
The reasons living gluten-free can be difficult from an emotional standpoint
are vast:
 Social activities revolve around food. Now, because you don’t eat gluten,
you may feel isolated, or you may be afraid to participate in these social
functions because you think you won’t be able to eat anything. (If you’re
struggling with eating away from home, check out Chapter 16.)
308
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 

 People you love don’t get it. In Chapter 16, I talk about how to discuss
the lifestyle with others. But sometimes, no matter how much you say
or don’t say, some people, many of whom are your closest buddies, just
don’t get it.
 People may think you’re crazy. When you try to explain this to some
people, or when they watch you stumble through one of your first expe-
riences ordering at a restaurant, they may think you’re outlandishly
high-maintenance, that you’re picky, that you have an eating disorder, or
that you’re crazy.
 They call it “comfort food” for a reason. Weight-management lectures
aside, for better or for worse, many people find eating to be a stress-
reliever. When your food options are limited, eating can be disconcerting
and can create anxiety.
 Some people don’t do well with change of any type. For those people,
something that involves changing their entire lifestyle can be really 
disruptive.
 You’re losing control in your life. You’re hereby “sentenced” to a life of
dietary restrictions. Wow. How’s that for taking control away? You’ve
been eating since you were a baby and choosing your own foods not
long after that, and now someone’s going to tell you what you can and
can’t eat? It’s tough sometimes.
 It seems so permanent. Oh, wait. That’s because it is. And that doesn’t
help someone feeling “put upon” by their restrictions.
 You feel like you’re on an island. If you do, you’d better hope it’s a big
island, because millions of people are going gluten-free. But I digress.
The gluten-free lifestyle seems isolating to some people; they even feel
ostracized. If you’re feeling like that, read on, because this part of the
book should help you realize that you have control over those feelings
and that you don’t have to be isolated or feel like you’re alone in this.
In this section, I talk about some of the common emotions people experience
when they hear they have to go gluten-free. You may notice that these issues
people face look a lot like reactions you may see in people who’ve experi-
enced a trauma. That’s not so surprising, because for some people, being told
they need to change their entire way of eating can be traumatic and stressful.
Sheer shock and panic
If you’ve ever seen a teenage girl who can’t find her cell phone, you’ve seen
panic. For some people, changing to a gluten-free lifestyle is even worse
than that.
309
Chapter 18: Beating the Blues: Overcoming Emotional Obstacles

On one hand, it all seems so sudden. You’re in the doctor’s office talking
about your bowel movements or lack thereof, and the next thing you know,
you’re branded with a condition you’ve probably never heard of that will
change the way you eat for the rest of your life. Yet in some ways, it’s not
sudden at all. Chances are, you’ve been having health issues for years. And
now it has a name. And a treatment. Both of which can stun you.
Huh? That’s about all you can think or say. You’re numb — you’re in shock.
The good news (let’s see, there’s got to be some good news here — okay,
here it is) is that by definition, you get this shocked feeling only once. (Have
you ever tried to figuratively shock someone twice with the same news? Few
people are that gullible.)
Have you ever had fingers that were so cold they were nearly frozen? They’re
kind of numb at that point, aren’t they? But when they begin to thaw, they
throb and feel like you’ve just run them through a wood chipper. That’s kind
of how you feel when sheer shock turns to pure panic. That’s when the reality
of the words “diet for life” begins to sink in, and you start to panic. What will
you eat? How will you do it? Where will you find special foods? Can you do it?
Rest assured that these feelings are normal, and they do pass. You will figure
out what you can eat, and your panic will subside as you become more com-
fortable with the diet, which begins on day one. The learning curve is steeper
for some than others, but you will learn, and the panic will wear off.
Anger and frustration
The shock and panic have subsided, and you’re beginning to feel more com-
fortable with what you can and can’t eat. But something’s eating at you. You
realize you’re miffed. Peeved. Fightin’ mad and agonizingly frustrated!
It doesn’t matter who or what you’re mad at — some people in this situation
are mad at their parents for giving them a “defective” gene; others are mad at
themselves for passing the gene on to their kids; some are mad at their part-
ner for not being more understanding; most are mad at the major cereal man-
ufacturers who feel it’s a Universal Cereal Manufacturer’s Law that they must
put malt flavoring in every cereal they make; and a few take it out on God for
“thinking up” this crazy condition.
Bottom line is, you’re fumin’ mad, and it’s stressing you out. Anger is a
healthy emotion, and learning to deal with it is one of the most valuable
lessons you can learn in life. Taking your anger out on those closest to you is
tempting, especially if they’re adding to the frustration by being less-than-
understanding about your new lifestyle. If you need help dealing with the
anger, reach out. But don’t lash out, especially at the people closest to you,
because they’re not to blame, and they can be immensely supportive when
you need it most.
310
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 

Grief and despair
Are you grieving? Do you feel like you’ve lost your best friend? In a way, you
may have. Food, your control over what you eat, and even the simple act of
putting food into your mouth can sooth you and bring you comfort. When
you’re forced to give up your favorite foods (if they weren’t your favorites
before, they will be after you give them up!), the change can make you feel
sad and melancholy. Furthermore, some people feel they’re the only ones
who have this problem, which can intensify feelings of isolation or loneliness.
If your child is going gluten-free, those feelings of grief can magnify. You
dream that your children’s lives will be carefree and ideal; having to deal with
dietary restrictions that prevent them from eating what seem to be staples in
a child’s diet isn’t usually part of your plan.
Some people reach a point of desperation or despair. They find the diet to be
cumbersome and difficult, and they keep making mistakes. Then they figure if
they can’t do this right, they may as well not do it at all, and they give up.
Grief and despair are normal emotions, but don’t give in to them. You will get
over your feelings of sadness and loneliness, and this lifestyle doesn’t have to
be in the least bit isolating or depriving. As for doing it right, give it your very
best effort — truly 100 percent — and you will get it. Dealing with a mistake
from time to time is better than giving up and not trying at all.
Loss and deprivation
You may feel a couple kinds of loss when someone tells you that you have to
go gluten-free. You obviously lose your favorite foods — and what about the
social situations that seem to go hand-in-hand with them? You miss pizza and
beer during Monday Night Football or Grandma’s famous oatmeal-raisin cook-
ies that everyone dives for before they remember to hug Grandma hello. And
what about the great appetizers, all of which are heavily skewed toward the
gluten-containing variety, during the dice game Bunco? (Okay, I’ll stop with
the reminders now.)
Many of your favorite foods, at least in the form you know them, are a thing of
the past. At first the social situations may not seem the same without them —
and they aren’t just the same. They’re the same but different, and that’s okay.
Remember when you attend these events that they’re not really about the
food — they’re about the socialization. Also remember to bring yourself foods
that you love — and follow the golden rules of going out gluten-free that I
cover in Chapter 16.
311
Chapter 18: Beating the Blues: Overcoming Emotional Obstacles

Another kind of loss people feel is a loss of convenience. These days, food is
prewashed, precut, prepeeled, precooked, prepackaged, pre-resealed, and
practically pre-eaten and premetabolized into tummy fat before you ever get
it home from the store. Convenience foods come as a complete snack or
meal, in various combinations to please any palate. Yes, these foods are 
convenient — and sometimes, when you pluck them from the aisles of the
produce section, they’re even good for you and gluten-free. But many of
them, for you, are a thing of the past.
So for many people, it’s true: There is a loss of convenience. Your days of call-
ing for pizza delivery are behind you, at least until the big pizza companies
begin offering gluten-free pizza (a girl can dream). No longer do you zip
through a store mindlessly plucking products off the shelves because they
look good or they’re on sale.
Okay, so giving up gluten isn’t as convenient — and you miss your old faves. I’ll
give you that — you can feel a sense of loss. But look what you’ve gained. Your
health! The gluten-free diet is your key to better health, and that’s priceless.
Sadness and depression
Occasionally, people get so overwhelmed with the whole concept of their
medical condition and the gluten-free diet that they feel an impending doom,
and they experience depression to one degree or another.
Realize that depression can be a symptom you experience if you eat gluten
despite your intolerance. Could the depression be due to accidental (or
intentional) gluten ingestion? Or is it a lingering emotional discomfort from
the pre-diagnosis days? Some people, before they’re diagnosed (and some
even afterwards), are accused of “making up” their problems, or they’re told
the symptoms are all in their head. The accusations in and of themselves can
be so hurtful and frustrating that they cause the person to go into a state of
depression.
People with celiac disease have a higher incidence of depression, mania,
seizures, and other neurological problems. I talk more about how gluten
affects behavior in Chapter 2.
And you also feel, of course, the restrictions, grief, sense of loss, anger, and
other emotions I discuss in this chapter. All of those can lead to depression.
Unfortunately, depression caused by illness can result in a vicious cycle. The
physical symptoms lead to suffering and depression, and then the depression
makes the physical symptoms worse. Furthermore, depression can weaken
the immune system and can affect your heart. Another reason to turn that
frown upside down: People with depression are four times more likely to
have a heart attack than those without.
312
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 

If you’re feeling depressed, make sure your diet is 100 percent gluten-free so
you know that what you’re feeling isn’t a symptom of gluten ingestion. Also
consider therapy of some type, whether it’s confiding in friends or seeking
professional help.
If you feel your case of the blues isn’t serious and you want to try to work it
out on your own, see whether these activities help:
 Exercising: When you exercise, your brain produces endorphins, and
those chemicals create a natural high. Exercise also helps you get rid
of stress hormones that build up in the body and wreak all sorts of
physical and emotional havoc.
 Eating well: And that means, besides eating a healthy diet, staying strict
about your gluten-free diet. Eating gluten exacerbates the physical and
mental symptoms you may experience, and if you’re gluten intolerant,
gluten robs you of the important nutrients that are supposed to energize
you and make you feel good. Stay away from the high-glycemic-index
foods I talk about in Chapter 6, because those mess with your blood-
sugar levels and affect your moods.
 Avoiding alcohol: Booze is bad news for people suffering from depres-
sion. Alcohol is a depressant, so by definition, it brings you down — it
also interrupts your sleep patterns, which are important for feeling
your best.
 Relaxing (whether you want to or not): It’s hard sometimes, I know! But
relaxation (even if you force it) is important to maintaining your mental
health. Sometimes you may forget to take care of yourself, but doing so
is crucial — otherwise you won’t be able to help anyone.
 Doing something nice for others: You can find this next postulate under
Danna’s Second Law of Happiness: The amount of happiness you feel is
directly proportional to the happiness you bring to others. Seriously,
have you ever been down and done something nice for someone? Not
feeling better when you make someone’s day is practically impossible.
Dealing with Denial
It walks like a duck. It quacks like a duck. It even lays duck eggs. But you’d like
to believe it’s a golden retriever. As far as your personal health is concerned,
maybe the flags are very, very red, pointing their little pointy flag-fingers at
the glaring neon sign screaming, “Gluten-free’s the way to be!” But you read,
“Gluten-free? I sure don’t need to be!” Denial comes in all sizes and shapes —
some types affect you, other types affect those around you.
313
Chapter 18: Beating the Blues: Overcoming Emotional Obstacles

When you’re the one in denial
When you hear you have to give up gluten for health reasons, deciding to
run, not walk, to the nearest sand pit to start digging a hole for your head is
quite common. It’s called denial, and nearly everyone goes through it to one
extent or another. Here are a few phases of denial, starting with the most
immediate.
Right off the bat
Your doctor: You have (insert condition), and you need to eliminate all
gluten from your diet beginning immediately.
You: Gluten? You mean like honey or sugar or something?
Your doctor: No, I mean like pizza, bread, and beer.
You: Surely you can’t be serious.
Your doctor: I am serious, and don’t call me Shirley.
Okay, so this is no time to joke, even if it is with classic lines from the movie
Airplane! But the initial reaction is a common one: I can’t have that condition;
I’ve never even heard of it; I’m too fat to have that; I’m too old to have it; I’m
too (insert adjective that will support your denial) to have that.
You can deny till the cows come home (where were they, anyway?), but that
doesn’t help your health any. What does help is getting on track as fast as
you can, because you have improved health to look forward to.
Denial down the road
Another type of denial settles in after you’ve been gluten-free for a while and
you’re feeling great. In fact, you feel so good that you start to think maybe
nothing was really wrong with you, and you can’t really remember ever feel-
ing all that bad.
Of course, this is about the time the reality of doing this for the rest of your
life starts to set in, and you’re tempted to cheat — but it’s not cheating if you
don’t really need to be gluten-free now, is it? So begins the battle in your
brain, where good and evil don’t see eye to eye.
The good half of your brain is telling you, “Mmmmm, this is the yummiest
gluten-free cracker I’ve ever had!” But the demon-in-denial side is saying,
“No way am I sittin’ through another football game eating rice cakes and
drinkin’ white wine while the other guys are plowin’ through pizza and
belchin’ their beer. Besides, I don’t have an intolerance . . . come on, just
one piece of pizza . . .”
314
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 

Step away from the pizza box. This is a period of ambivalence, in which
you’re hoping beyond hope that you don’t really have to give up gluten and
are “proving” it to yourself by ignoring red flags (and your conscience).
Acceptance
The biggest problem with denial is that it justifies eating gluten. When you
have this epiphany “realizing” that you don’t need to be gluten-free, it’s
tempting to run, not walk, to the nearest donut shop.
Resist the temptation. If you’ve been gluten-free for a while, then yes, you feel
great, but that’s because of the diet, not in spite of it. The danger in testing
your little theory is that you may not have any reaction when you do, and
then you’re likely to jump to the obvious (by which I mean “desired”) conclu-
sion that you never needed to eliminate gluten in the first place.
If you’re still not sure that you really should be gluten-free, here are some
steps you can take that may clarify things for you a little bit:
 Get properly tested. Denial is one of the most compelling arguments in
favor of proper testing. Check out Chapter 2 for more information about
testing.
 Realize that “negative” tests don’t always mean you’re free to become
a glutton for gluten. Allergy tests don’t pick up celiac disease; celiac
tests don’t always pick up sensitivities. The tests have changed over the
years, and maybe your tests were done long ago. You can also get false
negatives — and problems with gluten can develop at any point, so just
because you were negative once doesn’t mean you’ll be negative again.
And finally, some people are negative on all the tests, yet their health
improves dramatically on a gluten-free diet. Go figure.
 Get another opinion. If you’re particularly stubborn, you may even want
to get a third. Kind of like if Dad says no, ask Mom — but if they both say
no, you may want to admit defeat.
 Talk to others who’ve been there, done that. Most people have gone
through denial in one form or another. Talk to people who’ve been diag-
nosed with a condition that requires them to be gluten-free. They’ll
probably give you that smug smile with the yep-you’ve-got-a-classic-
case-of-denial look on their faces, because they’ve been there before.
You won’t really need to hear much more.
 Take notes. Write down your symptoms, how you feel when you eat
certain foods, and the symptoms of gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, or
whatever condition you may have. Do you see a correlation? When you
eat certain foods, do you notice that some of the symptoms you have
are similar to some of the symptoms of the condition? Hmmmm . . .

Chapter 18: Beating the Blues: Overcoming Emotional Obstacles

When others are in denial
The most common type of denial that others exhibit occurs when they have
all the symptoms themselves and refuse to admit it. Why is it so hard for rela-
tives to believe they may have this? Problems with gluten, after all, run in the
family, and lots of times family members have classic symptoms. Why is it
so hard for friends? Gluten intolerance of one type or another is a common
condition — yet often they say, “I don’t have that.” The bottom line is that
they don’t want to have it.
Conditions that require you to be gluten-free, such as celiac disease, have a
unique common denominator: People don’t always “buy” what you’re telling
them about your condition or the fact that a gluten-free diet may fully restore
your health. They also don’t always understand how strict you really need to
be in sticking to the diet.
I’ve been accused on more than one occasion by more than one person of
being neurotic about trying to avoid gluten. Doctors have told me I’m going
“overboard” because I check the ingredients in a “tiny” pill. Loved ones have
accused me of being obsessed about gluten and making sure food is gluten-
free. And I’m guessing more than one waiter has muttered something about
being high maintenance as he walked away.
I wish I had advice for how to handle the “others” in your life who don’t
believe you about your condition or won’t accept that they, too, could have
an intolerance to gluten. The best you can do is work hard to educate them.
You have no way to force them into testing or trying the diet, which is sad —
because those steps may dramatically improve their health.
Getting Back on Track When
You’re Feeling Derailed
So even I admit that some difficult emotional challenges arise when you go
gluten-free. You may be making a monumental change in your lifestyle! But
overcoming those challenges and getting back on track to enjoying life and
all it has to offer — far beyond food — are important.
Regaining control
If you don’t take control of this diet, the diet will control you. Part of the
reason you sometimes feel out of control when you’re told to go gluten-free is
because you’re afraid. Afraid of messing up. Afraid of believing inaccurate
316
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 

information. Afraid of letting go of your habits and favorite foods. Afraid
you’ll feel deprived. Afraid of being different. Afraid of trying new foods.
Afraid of an entirely new lifestyle.
The only way to get beyond the fear is to try new things. Be creative — explore
new foods — tantalize your taste buds with all the gluten-free goodies you can
think of. Arm yourself with accurate information. Be prepared when you’re out
and about. Taking control of the diet — and giving your kids control of theirs —
is key to living and loving the gluten-free lifestyle.
If you’re finding that all your favorite comfort foods are now off-limits, realize
that those old comfort foods were probably discomfort foods that actually
made you feel bad because they have gluten in them. Choose new favorites,
but try to avoid the pitfall of undermining weight management efforts by
turning to food for solace.
Getting beyond big words
with heavy implications
Many people embarking upon a gluten-free lifestyle hear some pretty scary
words being bandied around. Words like disease, chronic, restrictions, lifelong,
malabsorption, intestinal damage, and intolerance are usually the catalysts for
going gluten-free.
Although it’s easy to be somewhat stunned by the heavy implications these
words have, looking beyond them is important. Thinking more about the fact
that your health will improve, you’ll feel better, and you’ll have more energy
can help shift your perspective in a more optimistic direction.
Focusing on what you can eat
When the only food you can eat is gluten-free, every menu item begins to look
like a croissant. Wanting what you can’t have is the essence of human nature.
Tell someone he can’t juggle machetes, and he’s likely to have a sudden urge
to juggle machetes.
Believe me, I know how depriving this lifestyle can be. After all, for dinner my
family is stuck with main courses like filet mignon, shrimp scampi, chicken
Marsala, and seared ahi. Side dishes are scant with boring dishes like citrus
quinoa, bean and feta salad, and saffron rice — and for dessert all we get are
things like flan, tapioca pudding, chocolate (anything), ice cream, and crème
brûlée. Depriving, indeed.
317
Chapter 18: Beating the Blues: Overcoming Emotional Obstacles

If you’re feeling deprived, please don’t let my sarcasm offend you. It’s per-
fectly normal to feel like your selections are limited (they are limited but not
limiting) and to pine away for freshly baked sourdough. It’s also normal to
peruse a menu and feel like the only thing you can order is a side of fruit —
or to stare at your pantry and see only saltines.
I like to use vegetarians as role models for how you can improve your per-
spective. They don’t whine about the fact that they’re missing out on greasy
pork chops and flank steak. Quite the contrary: They revel in their diets, usu-
ally celebrating their meat-free lifestyle.
Focus on what you can eat, rather than what you can’t. The list of things you
can eat is a heckuva lot longer than the list of things you can’t, and if you don’t
believe me, start writing, my friend. Make a list of all the things you can eat —
let me know when you get that finished, wouldja?
One of the fastest ways to make a particular food take center stage in your
life is to ban it, because it’s human nature to want what you can’t have. For
many people, putting gluten on the no-can-do list makes them want it even
more. So if you’re feeling deprived, indulge yourself! Not with gluten, of
course, but with your favorite gluten-free treat. A splurge from time to time
can remind you of lots of delicious things you can eat and can help take your
mind off the things you can’t.

Are you a tad grumpy?
You may have dieter’s depression.
People who are on a diet of any kind usually feel
a “high” in the beginning, while they’re still
ultra-motivated and passionate about their
commitment. But then, usually around the
second or third week, something commonly
called dieter’s depression sets in, and making
hard food choices becomes tougher. Dieters in
this stage aren’t much fun to be around. Usually,
they’re feeling resentful and emotionally
deprived, especially if food was a source of
comfort for them.
Also, low levels of the hormone serotonin can
lead to depression, and the brain needs carbs
to produce serotonin. Sometimes when people
go gluten-free, they cut their carb level signifi-
cantly and may become depressed as a result.
If you think you may be falling into a dieter’s
depression, first make sure you’re getting good
carbs from fruits and veggies. If you find it too
time-consuming or cumbersome to cook
steamed garden favorites like broccoli and zuc-
chini, you may want to opt for grab-n-go fruits
and vegetables like apples, carrots, and sugar
snap peas. All are excellent sources of good
carbs and have other health benefits, too. Then
finish reading this chapter, which can give you
lots of tips for lifting your spirits and focusing on
the positive.

Deflecting the temptation to 
be annoyed or offended
When it comes to your dietary restrictions, you will, most likely, encounter
people who appear unconcerned, uninterested, thoughtless, and sometimes
even downright rude. From time to time you may have hurt feelings and may
even feel ostracized. (How’s that for sugarcoating it?) Other times you’ll find
that people do care but forget to make accommodations or just don’t “get it”
and serve foods you can’t eat.
Keep in mind that as you embark upon this new lifestyle, you’re probably
gaining an entirely new respect for food and a heightened awareness of what
having dietary restrictions feels like. And you’re probably much more aware
of other people’s restrictions and sensitivities.
Meanwhile, the rest of the world is unenlightened about the intricacies of the
gluten-free lifestyle and may actually be “rude” enough to suggest you join
them for dinner — at your (former) favorite pizza place.
Don’t be annoyed or offended. People are busy and sometimes so focused on
their own fast-paced lives that they can’t possibly remember to accommo-
date yours. Most of the time they’re not being rude or thoughtless (okay,
sometimes they are); they’re just unaware. Be glad they asked you to dinner,
and either bring something you can eat, order the salad, or suggest a differ-
ent restaurant. Save the negative energy for something that really matters —
like the kid next door who feels compelled to practice the drums at midnight.
Faking optimism
I’m not a fan of fake people. Fake people try to act like something they’re not,
usually in an attempt to impress others, and that is, for lack of a better term,
kind of icky.
Faking optimism is an entirely different thing. It’s when you pretend to your-
self that you feel good about something that you really don’t feel good about
at all. Before you know it, you really do feel better about it. It’s a really cool
power our brains have!
Faking optimism is easier for some people than others, because everyone falls
on different parts of the Optimism Spectrum to start with. There are the ohmy-
gosh-those-are-the-most-incredibly-beautiful-mosquitos-on-the-planet types,
and there are the I-find-her-chirpy-perky-optimism-downright-depressing types.
Where you fall doesn’t really matter; you, too, can fake optimism and have it
affect your overall outlook in a positive way.
319
Chapter 18: Beating the Blues: Overcoming Emotional Obstacles

Start by thinking of all the reasons the gluten-free lifestyle is a good thing in
your life (check out Chapter 19 if you need some help). Maybe it makes you
focus more on nutrition; maybe you’re spending more time with the family
eating home-cooked meals; maybe you’re appreciating the improved health
you’re experiencing as a result of the diet; maybe you’ve helped someone
else in the family discover the key to better health, too.
Make your list and convince (or remind) yourself that adopting this lifestyle
is a wonderful thing in your life. Get excited about it — tell your friends and
family how great you feel and why. Before you know it, you’ll have convinced
yourself and you won’t be faking it anymore.
Spreading attitudes — they’re contagious
Attitudes spread like germs through a preschool — and like germs, you can’t
see them, but if you catch the bad kind, they can make you feel pretty nasty.
Sometimes humans are like germs, silently spreading crummy attitudes to
unwitting victims. If you’re unhappy about having to adopt a gluten-free
lifestyle and haven’t found some of the tips in this chapter to help shake your
anxiety, at least don’t spread your misery around. Many people, if not most,
aren’t all that familiar with gluten, the gluten-free lifestyle, and the medical
conditions that benefit from it. Chances are, you’re the first person who’s
teaching them about it.

Avoiding “unpleasantry one-upmanship”
You know people who play this game: You almost
mindlessly comment that you have a headache,
and their quick comeback is, “You think you’ve
got a headache? I had a migraine the other day
that . . .” Yeah, you know the type. Always trying
to one-up you in the you-think-you’ve-got-it-bad
game. Well, in this game of what I call unpleas-
antry one-upmanship, you hold all the cards. If
you’ve been sick with celiac disease and finally
diagnosed, maybe your hand goes something
like this: “Yeah? Well, I have a lifelong, chronic
disease and a restricted diet that prevents me
from eating bread!” And then there’s the trump
card: diarrhea. Sure, you hold the winning hand,
but don’t play it. Playing this game forces you to
focus on the negative and sucks you into a
calamity competition that does you no good.
Furthermore, people who play that game usually
don’t care about what you’re saying; they’re too
busy choosing their next card.

If you feel compelled to whine about the foods you miss or express excessive
feelings of deprivation and despair, people will feel sad and sorry for your
“misfortune.” Do you really want their pity? Try instead to portray being
gluten-free to others as a great lifestyle, a positive event in your life, and a
healthful way to live so that others can feel that way, too.
You can grieve for the foods you can’t eat anymore, or you can rejoice in your
newfound health and strength.
Redefining Who You Are
If your doctor has diagnosed you with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease,
you may feel different. You are different from other people — and that’s okay.
We’re all different. Some have an interest in sports, others an aptitude for
accounting. We readily acknowledge and accept that we’re different in those
types of things, but sometimes we don’t like to be different with this diet.
Your diet is different — but in the big picture, your restrictions are no differ-
ent from those of people, such as vegans or people with peanut allergies, who
have other diet restrictions.
Yes, you’re different from other people — but you’re not different from who
you were before your diagnosis. Your lifestyle is different, but you’re not.
321
Chapter 18: Beating the Blues: Overcoming Emotional Obstacles
So you’re on a diet. That makes you unique?
You can’t eat certain things. If you do, you have
to deal with physical consequences. Your selec-
tions on a menu are limited, you have to be
careful about what you eat when you’re in
social situations, and you can’t always eat what
everyone else is eating. Your diet is restricted,
and it’s a pain in the hiney! So what’s so differ-
ent about you? You sound like you’re on a diet.
That makes you unique? I think not!
You can go on a diet for lots of reasons. People
usually think of going on diets to lose weight, but
some are on special diets to gain weight (much
to the chagrin of those trying to lose). Others are
on special diets because they have high blood
pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, food
allergies, diabetes, or autoimmune diseases like
arthritis or multiple sclerosis. For health or ethi-
cal reasons, some people choose to avoid meat
or foods that contain chemicals or hormones.
Athletes in training often have special diets, and
pregnant or lactating women sometimes choose
to modify their diets to optimize their baby’s
health. Those of us on a gluten-free diet tend to
think of it as being different from other diets —
but in many ways, it’s not different at all!

Sometimes people let their condition define who they are. Try not to do this.
Is having this condition a disappointment? Maybe — maybe not (I hope after
you finish this book you don’t think so!). But okay, maybe you’re bummed
about it, and that’s okay.
What you’re not is a victim, a martyr, or a sick person. In fact, you’re on the
road to recovery and amazing health. Lots of people have some kind of
adversity in their lives, and they deal with it — you can, too.
If you’re having trouble dealing with the gluten-free lifestyle from an emo-
tional or psychological standpoint, step back and take a look at the bigger
picture. Why are you giving up gluten in the first place? Probably because
each and every bite of gluten compromised your health.
Force yourself to remember that the gluten-free diet is key to your better
health, and focus on the great thing you’re doing for your body by being
gluten-free. Here are a few more tips that may help you beat the blues:
 Psych yourself up. Change your perspective on why you eat, what you
eat, and how you eat. Remember, you’re supposed to eat to live, not the
other way around.
 Think outside the box. Getting stuck in food ruts, eating the same basic
meals day after day, week after week, is easy. Explore new foods, find
new favorites, and be creative in finding new ways to tantalize your
taste buds.
 Remember, the diet gets easier with time. If the gluten-free lifestyle
seems difficult to you from an emotional or practical standpoint, realize
that it gets easier over time. You will accept it and adapt to it and will
hopefully learn to love it!
 Seek out help. Whether help comes from family members, support
groups, friends, or counselors, sometimes others can help make the
transition easier.
 Avoid negative people and influences. Basically, purge your life of the
negative. If the gluten-free way of life is a struggle for you, the last thing
you need is a malicious relative sabotaging your efforts.
 Recommit yourself. Sometimes you need to reaffirm your commitment
by remembering why you’re doing this.
Resisting the Temptation to Cheat
There are approximately 4.2 gazillion diets out there: lowfat, high-protein, low-
carb, low-calorie, low-glycemic, and everything in between. The thing they all
have in common is that people cheat on them. It’s a fact. People cheat on diets.
322
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 

But you can’t cheat on this one, especially if you have celiac disease. No, not
even a little. “Everything in moderation” and “a little won’t hurt you” do not
apply if you have gluten sensitivity or celiac disease.
Resisting the temptation to cheat starts with understanding why you want to
cheat.
Realizing why you want to cheat
If you’re spending a lot of time (or money on diet books) figuring out why you
want to cheat on your diet, you’re working too hard. There may be a lot of
factors that play a part, but it all boils down to one reason, as far as I can tell:
you want to. You want that cookie, pasta, or that bagel. After all, if you didn’t
want it, it wouldn’t be a temptation.
There are lots of reasons you may want to eat the forbidden glutenous goods,
and if you hope to resist the temptation, it’s important to figure out what’s
driving your desire. Here are some of the more common triggers for tempta-
tion to cheat on the gluten-free diet:
 It’s just too good to resist. I realize this isn’t profound or worthy of land-
ing me on any pop psych talk shows, but most people who indulge in a
food not on their diet do so because it’s just too yummy to say no.
 Just this once. Not a good plan. There’s a slippery slope between “just
this once” and a diet that’s long-forgotten.
 You want to fit in. If everyone else were jumping off a cliff, would you?
(Bungee jumpers aren’t allowed to answer that.) Truthfully, other people
probably aren’t paying much attention to what you’re eating, anyway.
Social situations are about the company, the conversation, and the
ambiance. Yeah, it’s about the food, too, but people aren’t paying atten-
tion to what you’re eating.
 It’s a comfort food for you. In difficult times, people sometimes have
certain foods they turn to. If a gluten-containing goodie is your comfort
food, a weak moment may send you straight to the food that you think
will make you feel better — even though you know it won’t.
 It’s a special occasion. Try again. This excuse may work for other diets,
but not this one. Eating even a little bit of gluten may turn your social
affair into a dreaded nightmare. No occasion is worth compromising
your health, and furthermore, special occasions are about the occasion,
not the food.
323
Chapter 18: Beating the Blues: Overcoming Emotional Obstacles

 You’re bored by the diet. If all you’re eating is rice cakes and celery, I
don’t blame you. Live it up, get creative, and try new things. Use this
book as a guide to figure out exactly what you can eat, and then chal-
lenge yourself to try something new. If you need a little inspiration,
check out Chapter 9, which offers ideas for getting creative in the
kitchen, and learning to make anything gluten-free.
 A little won’t hurt. Yeah, it could. If you plan to use this as an excuse,
you’re assigned to read Chapters 2 and 3.
 The diet’s too hard. Hey, this is a For Dummies book, remember? This
book is supposed to make it really easy to figure out what you can and
can’t eat, and how to live (and love!) the lifestyle. Sometimes it’s not
easy to change your perspective, I’ll give you that. But you can do it, and
between your friends, family, books like this, and helpful resources
listed in Chapter 5, you’ve got plenty of support.
 Someone’s sabotaging your diet. People do this! In fact, it’s common.
Usually they’re not aware that they’re doing it, and they do it for all dif-
ferent reasons. Sometimes they do it because they’re jealous that you’re
getting healthier than they are. Sometimes they do it because they don’t
“believe” you need to be on the diet (see the section called “When
others are in denial,” earlier in this chapter). Other times, people do it
because they don’t want to have to follow the clean-kitchen rules or
don’t want to have to put the effort into preparing gluten-free foods.
Don’t succumb to the sabotage efforts. Instead, try to find someone who
seems particularly supportive of your gluten-free lifestyle, and ask for
help. People love to help, and they get tremendous satisfaction out of
lending a shoulder, an ear, or a hand.
 I’ve already blown it so much, it doesn’t matter anymore. Not true.
Today can be the first day of the rest of your gluten-free life.
Although these are powerful factors in enticing you to go for the gluten, over-
coming the temptation is important. Sometimes the key to saying no is taking
a look at the consequences.
You choose to cheat — or not — because you have full control over what you
put in your mouth. When you cheat on the gluten-free diet, you’re cheating
yourself out of better health.
Assessing the consequences
One of the tough parts about looking at the consequences of your actions is
that if they’re not immediate and drastic, you sometimes feel that they don’t
matter. People who are dieting to lose weight often don’t notice any conse-
quences from a setback or two because they don’t see the extra inches jump
324
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 
Part IV: Living — and Loving — the Gluten-Free Lifestyle 24/7 

back onto their thighs when they eat a bowl of ice cream — and for that
matter, they may never gain the weight back, because for them, a high-calorie
indulgence from time to time may be okay.
If you have gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, though, the consequences can
have serious adverse affects on your health, and if you cheat chronically,
those effects can be cumulative. In fact, you could be setting yourself up to
develop conditions like osteoporosis, lupus, thyroid disease, and lots of
other conditions that I’m betting aren’t worth that bagel. For some friendly
reminders about how much damage you could be doing when you cheat, see
Chapters 2 and 3.
Overcoming the temptation
After you realize why you want to cheat and you remind yourself of the con-
sequences, you have to finalize the deal by just saying no. Here are a few
things you can do to make this a little easier:
 Indulge in your favorite gluten-free goodie. If you’re craving a brownie,
eat it — the gluten-free kind, of course. Just about anything that has
gluten in it has a gluten-free counterpart these days. If you’d rather just
grab a (gluten-free) candy bar, that’s cool, too. If you’re tempted to eat
something with gluten, try to find something else that will satisfy at least
as much, but still keep you on track with your gluten-free lifestyle.
 Reward yourself when you resist. If you’ve been challenged by tempta-
tion and successfully overcome it, give yourself a treat. It doesn’t have to
be food — maybe you buy yourself something special or do something
nice for yourself. Doing so can reinforce your strength and commitment
to the lifestyle.
 Simplify what you need to. If the diet seems to cumbersome, maybe
you’re trying to do too much and need to go back to the basics. If your
menu plans are overwhelming, cut something out so you don’t have so
much to think about. If you don’t understand the diet, read parts of this
book again, particularly Chapters 4 and 5. You may also want to seek out
some of the resources in Chapter 5.
 Make your lifestyle a priority. This is about you — your health — your
future. If you find this lifestyle too difficult because of your work commit-
ments, think about changing your schedule. If you have negative people
in your life who seem to sabotage your efforts, avoid them if you can. If
something’s not working in your life, change it. Being gluten-free is about
more than a diet; it’s about a lifestyle, and it should be a high priority.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
summarize some of the many benefits of being gluten-
free in Chapter 19. In Chapter 20, where I list tips to
help you love the gluten-free lifestyle. If you’re thinking
you don’t need or want to give up gluten, you may want to
pay special attention to Chapter 21, where I list some of
the lame excuses I’ve heard for not going gluten-free. If
any of them sound familiar, you may want to do some
soul-searching and reconsider your decision.

Chapter 19
Ten Benefits of Being Gluten-Free
In This Chapter
 Healing for people with celiac disease
 Preventing celiac disease
 Looking younger
 Managing your weight or menopausal symptoms
 Knowing what you’re eating
H
ow ’bout these for benefits: no more diarrhea, no more headaches, no
more fatigue, no more depression, no more “irritable bowel syndrome”
or “fibromyalgia”? (You can read more about how these conditions may bene-
fit from a gluten-free diet in Chapter 2.) If you’re going gluten-free because
you have some form of gluten intolerance, I don’t need to tell you how icky
feeling icky feels — and the key to not feeling icky is being gluten-free. For
you, the benefits are blatant.
But even if you have no medical reasons whatsoever for being gluten-free, the
benefits of the gluten-free lifestyle are still vast. In fact, I could list way more
than ten benefits of being gluten-free, but this is called the “Part of Tens,” not
the “Part of Tons,” so I just give you the highlights.
You Know How to Improve Your Health
I always get way too excited and end up spilling the punch line halfway
through a joke. Here I go again, giving you the very best benefit of being
gluten-free right out of the gates: You, unlike many people, have the key to
better health — a gluten-free diet.
This idea is especially true if you’ve been diagnosed with gluten sensitivity or
celiac disease; most people who shouldn’t eat gluten aren’t so lucky. They
don’t know they have an intolerance to gluten, so they have no clue what’s
making them feel so bad. They try cutting out dairy or other potential aller-
gens, and their surgeons try cutting out their gallbladders or various other

innards, but nothing helps. You, on the other hand, know exactly what’s
making you sick — gluten — and you can eliminate it from your diet, enjoying
fully restored health.
If You Have Problems with Gluten,
Your Health Improves Right Away
If you have celiac disease, gluten damages your intestinal tract. The minute
you go gluten-free, your body starts healing, you begin to absorb nutrients
again, and before you know it, you’re feeling so great that you can’t even
remember how bad you used to feel. Whether you’ve been sick for years,
days, or never even seemed to feel any effects from gluten, your body can
begin healing immediately, and that means your health can improve, too.
The Diet Can Be Super Healthful
You can do the gluten-free diet in several ways, and one of them is extremely
healthful. It’s an approach some people call the caveman diet or the Paleolithic
diet, and it consists of eating meat, poultry, fish, seafood, fruits, vegetables,
berries, nuts, ancient alternative “grains,” and other foods that your body was
designed to eat — all of which are naturally gluten-free. Follow this form of a
gluten-free diet, and you may look and feel better, live longer, age more slowly,
and have a nutritional edge over gluttons for gluten. You can find more infor-
mation on this approach by doing a search on “Paleolithic diet” on any search
engine (or by flipping to Chapter 6).
If You Don’t Have Celiac Disease
and You’re Not Eating Gluten,
You’ll Never Develop It
You need three things to develop celiac disease: the genetic predisposition,
an environmental trigger of some kind (a virus, surgery, trauma, pregnancy,
or emotional distress, for instance), and a diet that includes gluten. If you’re
not eating gluten, you can’t develop celiac disease!

You May Decrease the Chances
of Developing Associated
Autoimmune Diseases
Many autoimmune diseases go hand in hand, meaning that if you develop one,
you’re likely to develop another. If you have celiac disease and you continue
to eat gluten, your chances of developing associated autoimmune diseases
increase over time. Some studies have shown that the sooner you cut gluten
out of your diet, the lower your risk of developing other conditions (to find
out more about related conditions, see Chapter 2).
You May Be Turning Back the Clock
Is the gluten-free diet the holy grail for turning back the hands of time? Maybe,
if you follow the principles of Dr. Nicholas Perricone, a dermatologist and
adjunct professor of medicine at Michigan State University. He maintains
that inflammation contributes to accelerated aging and that through diet
(and supplements and creams), you can erase scars and wrinkles, increase
the production of collagen and elastin, enjoy radiance and glow, and develop
a dewy, supple appearance to your skin.
So how does the gluten-free diet fit into the picture of youth? Although
Perricone doesn’t actually pinpoint gluten as a culprit, he does say that
wheat provokes an inflammatory response by quickly turning to sugar in
the bloodstream. That inflammatory response causes your skin to age more
quickly, and he maintains that avoiding foods like wheat may help reverse
the aging process. You can find out more about the Perricone principles at
www.nvperriconemd.com.
Symptoms of Menopause May Decrease
Some doctors think wheat-based foods may exacerbate symptoms of
menopause, such as hot flashes, night sweats, headaches, fatigue, and
mood swings. Eliminating these wheat-based products, especially foods
that contain white refined flour, may reduce these symptoms.

Chapter 19: Ten Benefits of Being Gluten-Free

Your Weight Can Be Easier to Manage
If you go gluten-free the nutritious way (see Chapter 6), you’ll be eating high-
protein, low-glycemic-index foods. Eating these types of foods stabilizes the
“I’m hungry” and “I’m full” hormones, so you don’t always feel hungry; it also
causes your body to use the stored fat (read “love handles” or “saddlebags”)
as energy.
Sometimes when people go gluten-free, they seek out specialty gluten-free
products like cookies, donuts, pizza crusts, breads, bagels, and pastas. These
foods are fine in moderation, but they’re not going to do you any favors when
you’re trying to squeeze into your skinny jeans. If you follow a naturally gluten-
free diet, you’ll help your body function the way it’s supposed to, decrease
your hunger pangs, and make managing your weight much easier.
You’re More Aware of Nutrition
Now that you’re gluten-free, you’re way more knowledgeable about nutrition
than most people. For one thing, you read labels. You know that processed
foods usually have multisyllabic ingredients (with lots of x’s and y’s in them)
that seem better suited to a pesticide than your plate. You, unlike the common
Joe, know that malt usually comes from barley, maltodextrin doesn’t contain
malt, and glucose isn’t the same as gluten (if you’re thinking, “It isn’t?” please
read Chapter 3 before the pop quiz). Hopefully, you’ve even experienced the
joys of quinoa, millet, and other alternative grains that many people have never
heard of, and you know that they’re nutritional powerhouses compared to the
typical cereal grains.
Blood-Sugar Levels May Be More Stable
If you’re doing the gluten-free diet the nutritious way that I outline in Chapter 6,
then you’re essentially eating low-glycemic-index foods that help stabilize your
blood-sugar levels. High-glycemic-load foods found in lots of wheat-based prod-
ucts quickly turn to sugar in your bloodstream and cause your insulin levels
to spike and then drop quickly. Energy levels and even moods can follow this
yo-yo pattern, and not only is that unhealthy, but getting a rush of energy only
to quickly crash and burn is no fun. A naturally gluten-free diet helps stabilize
your blood-sugar levels and gives you sustained energy throughout the day. If
you have diabetes, you can benefit greatly from this approach when you’re
trying to control your blood sugar.

Ten Tips to Help You
(or Your Child) Love 
the Gluten-Free Lifestyle
In This Chapter
 Delighting in the foods you can eat
 Wrestling for control of the diet
 Taking a bite out of boredom with an occasional splurge
 Living life like you did before
T
he transition from gluten-gorger to “gluten-free is good for me” is harder
for some people than others. Learning to live the lifestyle is one thing;
learning to love it is sometimes quite another. Sometimes you’re going along
just fine with the gluten-free lifestyle, and for some reason life seems to turn
into one big gluten-gala and resisting your gluten-glomming friends who seem
to be taunting you with gluten galore becomes harder than ever.
Focus on What You Can Eat
Staring into a pantry and seeing nothing but gluten is really easy. Sometimes
you may seem to find more gluten around you than oxygen molecules. It’s
true — gluten is everywhere — yet the reality is that the list of things you can
eat is a lot longer than the list of things you can’t. You just have to shift your
thinking a tinge. Instead of thinking about the foods you can’t have anymore,
focus on the foods you can eat, and put a special emphasis on those that you
especially enjoy. If you’re feeling a little restricted or deprived, treat yourself
to your favorite gluten-free indulgences. Try to think outside the box and
explore foods you may not otherwise have tried, or figure out how to make
your favorite glutenous meal into a gluten-freebie (Chapter 9 helps you get
creative in the kitchen). Before you know it, you’ll realize that the gluten-free
lifestyle might have its restrictions, but it’s definitely not restrictive.

Expand Your Culinary Horizons
with Alternative Grains
There’s a bold, gluten-free world out there filled with foods some people
have never heard of; quinoa, amaranth, teff, millet, buckwheat, acai, kefir, and
sorghum top the list of my faves. Don’t underestimate your kids’ willingness
to try new foods, either. Even if they’re reluctant to experiment at first, they
usually make the leap and learn to broaden their horizons. Whether your
palate is conditioned to enjoy bland and tasteless foods or foods exploding
with flavor, you may find a whole new world of unique and sometimes excep-
tionally nutritious foods.
Enjoy an Ethnic Flare
Lots of cultures use naturally gluten-free ingredients in their cooking. Many
Asian cuisines, including Thai, Vietnamese, and Korean, are often gluten-free,
as are many Mexican and Indian dishes. Do some research on the Internet
to find out what ingredients a particular culture uses, or explore cookbooks
featuring recipes from around the world. You can figure out how to cook
foods from those cultures or venture out to restaurants to enjoy a new taste
experience gluten-free — globally!
Control the Diet
Whether you’re 2 or 102, if you’re going gluten-free, you need to take control
of the diet. The diet can suddenly control things like what you eat, when and
where you eat, with whom you eat, and even how you eat. But remember that
you’re in control. You decide what you’re going to eat, when you’re going to
eat, and with whom. Planning ahead helps, and I talk about menu planning
and shopping in Chapter 8. It’s also important to make sure something’s always
available for you when you’re hungry. I cover the golden rules of going out
gluten-free in Chapter 16, because part of being in control of the diet is being
able to get out and about and know that you’re able to eat safely when you’re
not at home.
If your child’s on the diet, start giving him or her control from day one, no
matter how young he or she is. People usually way underestimate kids’ abilities
to understand the diet and why being strict about following it is so important.
Check out Chapter 17 for more about raising happy, healthy, gluten-free kids.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Eat to Live, Don’t Live to Eat
Your body is designed to use food as fuel, not as a comforter, pacifier, or
partner-replacer. Sure, food has become a huge part of society and interper-
sonal relationships, and by definition, social functions all revolve around
food. But that doesn’t mean food is the social function, nor does that mean
you have to eat the food that’s there. Food tastes good, and having a full
belly often feels good. But food serves a greater purpose, and you should
treat it as fueler, not filler.
Remember: You’re Different. So What?
People talk about wanting to be unique, and yet they cringe when they’re
afraid they appear out of step. The bottom line is that everyone is different,
even when people try to look the same. If you’re on the gluten-free diet, your
bread may look a little different, and you may sometimes appear to be a tad
high-maintenance at a restaurant. So what? Lots of people “customize” a
menu. Vegetarians skip a huge portion of the buffet line. Some people don’t
like chicken; others don’t do dairy; and some can die if they eat the wrong
foods. Lots of people have “different” diets and lifestyles. Yours happens to
be healthy, delicious, and the key to your better health.
Go Ahead — Enjoy a (Gluten-Free)
Splurge
If you put too many restrictions on yourself in trying to maintain a healthy,
gluten-free lifestyle, you may just find yourself getting bored and frustrated
and feeling deprived. Give yourself a break. Indulge from time in time in your
favorite gluten-free extravagance, whether it happens to be a sweet treat or a
baked potato loaded with sour cream and butter. Finding and maintaining a
good balance is an important part of any lifestyle.
Tune In to the Benefits
When you tune in and remind yourself of the benefits of being gluten-free (see
Chapter 19), that step reinforces in your mind why you’re living a gluten-free
lifestyle. If you think it would be helpful to write down all the good things about
335
Chapter 20: Ten Tips to Help You (or Your Child) Love the Gluten-Free Lifestyle

being gluten-free, do it. Post the list on the fridge, if you want a daily reminder,
or keep a list in a journal on your desk. Maybe you want to challenge yourself
to add an item to the list each day or week. When you focus on the reasons
being gluten-free is a good thing in your life, you can gain a new or renewed
appreciation for the lifestyle itself.
Turn Away from Temptation
Avoid putting yourself in tempting situations when you can, saving your
strength for when you have no choice in the matter. You’re not doing yourself
any favors if you surround yourself with tidbits of temptation, whether in the
workplace, at home, or in social situations. You probably shouldn’t take that
job at the bakery. Don’t think you’re building character by holding a slice of
pizza to your nose and taking a big whiff. And yeah, you may want to think
twice about entering that pie-eating contest. There’s enough gluten to go
around in this world without setting yourself up for temptation and frustration.
Deal with It; Don’t Dwell on It
If you’re mad, sad, grief-stricken, confused, frustrated, agitated, and downright
ticked off about having to live without gluten, that’s okay. Lots of people expe-
rience those feelings, especially if they’re forced to embark upon an entirely
new — and sometimes very different — lifestyle. But deal with those feelings,
and move on. Call on your friends, family, and support groups, share with
them how you’re feeling, and let them try to help you work through the feel-
ings. If you need professional help, get it. Not wallowing in the negativity of
your circumstances is important, or your thoughts may intensify and can
even end up causing other physical and emotional problems.

Chapter 21
Ten Lame Excuses Not 
to Go Gluten-Free
In This Chapter
 Hearing excuses, excuses
 Realizing excuses don’t buy you good health
I
realize you may not want to give up pizza and bagels, much less beer. And
I also realize that you’re going to work really hard to justify why you don’t
need to. Some of the excuses I’ve heard for not going gluten-free are pretty
creative — but I’m not buyin’ em.
“I’m too fat to have celiac disease
or gluten sensitivity.”
This is one of the more understandable excuses, because most people associ-
ate gluten intolerance, celiac disease, and malabsorption in general with being
skinny. But sometimes weight gain is a symptom as much as weight loss. In
fact, because of the malabsorption that can result from gluten intolerance, your
hormones — including the ones that make you store or use fat — can be way
out of whack, wreaking all sorts of havoc on your body in many ways, including
your weight. (And by the way — the gluten-free diet, if done as I recommend in
Chapter 6, may actually help you manage your weight quite effectively.)
“I don’t have the symptoms of gluten
sensitivity or celiac disease.”
More than 250 symptoms characterize gluten sensitivity and celiac disease,
and I seriously wonder whether anyone can honestly claim to have none.
Headaches? Fatigue? Joint pain? Gas? Bloating? Depression? Mouth ulcers?

Take a look at the list of symptoms in Chapter 2, and then remember that
that’s the short list. Some people with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease
truly are asymptomatic (they have no apparent symptoms), but eating gluten
causes them significant internal damage.
“I don’t want to be deprived
of important nutrients.”
You mean all the nutrients you’re getting from those bagels, pizzas, and
beers? Trust me — your body will survive without those nutritional power-
houses. In fact, if you have any form of gluten intolerance and you’re still
eating gluten, you’re already depriving your body of important nutrients.
Furthermore, the gluten-free diet can be extremely healthy, especially if you
do it the way I recommend in Chapter 6. If you’re still concerned about a lack
of vitamins and minerals, you can take supplements — just make sure they’re
gluten-free.
“I don’t want to give up (insert favorite
gluten-containing food).”
Of course you don’t want to give up your favorite foods, but not being tested
and continuing to eat gluten won’t make your problem, if you have one, go
away. In fact, it’ll get worse, and you may be setting yourself up to develop
some nasty complications and associated conditions.
“My problem isn’t with gluten. I just
don’t do well with pasta and beer.”
Pinpointing a few foods that don’t sit well with you is easy. What’s hard is
realizing that you may have a bigger issue that includes an intolerance to
those foods — and many more. If you’ve targeted a few foods that you don’t
do well with and they happen to have gluten in them, consider the fact that
gluten — not just those few foods — could be what’s making you feel bad.
338
Part V: The Part of Tens 

“Pizza makes me feel bad; I must 
have lactose intolerance.”
Lots of people draw this kind of conclusion. They figure out that a particular
food makes them ill, but they don’t make the association between that food
and gluten — usually because they’ve never heard of gluten. When pizza or
pasta makes people feel bad, they often assume it’s the lactose in the cheese
or the tomatoes in the pasta sauce. You can also blame the bubbles in the
beer, the sugar in the cookies, and the yeast in the bread. Of course, there’s
the possibility that you are lactose intolerant — but there’s also the possibil-
ity that gluten may be the culprit.
“I have irritable bowel syndrome, and
my doctor said diet doesn’t affect it.”
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) isn’t a specific disease; it’s a term for a group
of symptoms — like gas, bloating, and diarrhea — that doctors use when none
of the tests show a single underlying cause. All these symptoms are signs of
gluten sensitivity and celiac disease. In fact, IBS is a common misdiagnosis
for gluten sensitivity and celiac disease, as are fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue
syndrome, gallbladder disease, migraines, and myriad other conditions —
and in those cases, if they are due to gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, a
gluten-free diet can help. Bottom line: If you aren’t getting better, you may
want to rethink your diagnosis.
“I had celiac disease as a 
kid, but I outgrew it.”
In the 1950s and 1960s, physicians thought people outgrew celiac disease, so
they often told patients to try eating gluten again as an adult, and if they didn’t
feel symptoms, to consider themselves “cured.” Some people still believe that
people can outgrow celiac disease, but now doctors know that no one out-
grows celiac disease. Your symptoms may change — you may not even have
any symptoms (or may not associate symptoms such as headaches and fatigue
with gluten) — but if you had celiac disease at one time in your life, you have it
forever and definitely need to be gluten-free for life.
339
Chapter 21: Ten Lame Excuses Not to Go Gluten-Free

“I was tested for celiac disease,
and I was negative.”
Once negative doesn’t mean always negative. Celiac disease can develop at
any point in your life, so even if you test negative once, you need to be tested
again in the future if you’re at risk for developing it or if you have symptoms.
Furthermore, you can get false negatives if your testing is incomplete (not all
the tests are done), if you’re IgA-deficient (see Chapter 2 for more details), or
if the tests were done or interpreted poorly.
“I don’t have the genes 
for celiac disease.”
You may still have a form of gluten intolerance. Some people test negative for
gluten sensitivity and celiac disease, yet they still find they feel better on a
gluten-free diet (which logically means that gluten makes them feel bad).
