Preface
The world is continuous, but the mind is discrete.
David Mumford
We seek to bridge some critical gaps between various ﬁelds of mathematics by
studying the interplay between the continuous volume and the discrete vol-
ume of polytopes. Examples of polytopes in three dimensions include crystals,
boxes, tetrahedra, and any convex object whose faces are all ﬂat. It is amusing
to see how many problems in combinatorics, number theory, and many other
mathematical areas can be recast in the language of polytopes that exist in
some Euclidean space. Conversely, the versatile structure of polytopes gives
us number-theoretic and combinatorial information that ﬂows naturally from
their geometry.
Fig. 0.1. Continuous and discrete volume.
The discrete volume of a body P can be described intuitively as the number
of grid points that lie inside P, given a ﬁxed grid in Euclidean space. The
continuous volume of P has the usual intuitive meaning of volume that we
attach to everyday objects we see in the real world.

Preface
Indeed, the diﬀerence between the two realizations of volume can be
thought of in physical terms as follows. On the one hand, the quantum-
level grid imposed by the molecular structure of reality gives us a discrete
notion of space and hence discrete volume. On the other hand, the New-
tonian notion of continuous space gives us the continuous volume. We see
things continuously at the Newtonian level, but in practice we often compute
things discretely at the quantum level. Mathematically, the grid we impose
in space—corresponding to the grid formed by the atoms that make up an
object—helps us compute the usual continuous volume in very surprising and
charming ways, as we shall discover.
In order to see the continuous/discrete interplay come to life among the
three ﬁelds of combinatorics, number theory, and geometry, we begin our fo-
cus with the simple-to-state coin-exchange problem of Frobenius. The beauty
of this concrete problem is that it is easy to grasp, it provides a useful com-
putational tool, and yet it has most of the ingredients of the deeper theories
that are developed here.
In the ﬁrst chapter, we give detailed formulas that arise naturally from
the Frobenius coin-exchange problem in order to demonstrate the intercon-
nections between the three ﬁelds mentioned above. The coin-exchange problem
provides a scaﬀold for identifying the connections between these ﬁelds. In the
ensuing chapters we shed this scaﬀolding and focus on the interconnections
themselves:
(1) Enumeration of integer points in polyhedra—combinatorics,
(2) Dedekind sums and ﬁnite Fourier series—number theory,
(3) Polygons and polytopes—geometry.
We place a strong emphasis on computational techniques, and on com-
puting volumes by counting integer points using various old and new ideas.
Thus, the formulas we get should not only be pretty (which they are!) but
should also allow us to eﬃciently compute volumes by using some nice func-
tions. In the very rare instances of mathematical exposition when we have a
formulation that is both “easy to write” and “quickly computable,” we have
found a mathematical nugget. We have endeavored to ﬁll this book with such
mathematical nuggets.
Much of the material in this book is developed by the reader in the more
than 200 exercises. Most chapters contain warm-up exercises that do not de-
pend on the material in the chapter and can be assigned before the chapter
is read. Some exercises are central, in the sense that current or later material
depends on them. Those exercises are marked with ♣, and we give detailed
hints for them at the end of the book. Most chapters also contain lists of open
research problems.
It turns out that even a ﬁfth grader can write an interesting paper on
integer-point enumeration [145], while the subject lends itself to deep inves-
tigations that attract the current eﬀorts of leading researchers. Thus, it is an
area of mathematics that attracts our innocent childhood questions as well

as our reﬁned insight and deeper curiosity. The level of study is highly ap-
propriate for a junior/senior undergraduate course in mathematics. In fact,
this book is ideally suited to be used for a capstone course. Because the three
topics outlined above lend themselves to more sophisticated exploration, our
book has also been used eﬀectively for an introductory graduate course.
To help the reader fully appreciate the scope of the connections between
the continuous volume and the discrete volume, we begin the discourse in two
dimensions, where we can easily draw pictures and quickly experiment. We
gently introduce the functions we need in higher dimensions (Dedekind sums)
by looking at the coin-exchange problem geometrically as the discrete volume
of a generalized triangle, called a simplex.
The initial techniques are quite simple, essentially nothing more than ex-
panding rational functions into partial fractions. Thus, the book is easily ac-
cessible to a student who has completed a standard college calculus and linear
algebra curriculum. It would be useful to have a basic understanding of par-
tial fraction expansions, inﬁnite series, open and closed sets in Rd, complex
numbers (in particular, roots of unity), and modular arithmetic.
An important computational tool that is harnessed throughout the text is
the generating function f(x) = P∞
m=0 a(m) xm, where the a(m)’s form any
sequence of numbers that we are interested in analyzing. When the inﬁnite
sequence of numbers a(m), m = 0, 1, 2, . . . , is embedded into a single generat-
ing function f(x), it is often true that for hitherto unforeseen reasons, we can
rewrite the whole sum f(x) in a surprisingly compact form. It is the rewriting
of these generating functions that allows us to understand the combinatorics
of the relevant sequence a(m). For us, the sequence of numbers might be the
number of ways to partition an integer into given coin denominations, or the
number of points in an increasingly large body, and so on. Here we ﬁnd yet
another example of the interplay between the discrete and the continuous: we
are given a discrete set of numbers a(m), and we then carry out analysis on
the generating function f(x) in the continuous variable x.
What Is the Discrete Volume?
The physically intuitive description of the discrete volume given above rests
on a sound mathematical footing as soon as we introduce the notion of a
lattice. The grid is captured mathematically as the collection of all integer
points in Euclidean space, namely Zd = {(x1, . . . , xd) : all xk ∈Z}. This
discrete collection of equally spaced points is called a lattice. If we are given
a geometric body P, its discrete volume is simply deﬁned as the number of
lattice points inside P, that is, the number of elements in the set Zd ∩P.
Intuitively, if we shrink the lattice by a factor k and count the number
of newly shrunken lattice points inside P, we obtain a better approximation
for the volume of P, relative to the volume of a single cell of the shrunken
lattice. It turns out that after the lattice is shrunk by an integer factor k, the
number #
 P ∩1
kZd
of shrunken lattice points inside an integral polytope P

X
Preface
is magically a polynomial in k. This counting function #
 P ∩1
kZd
is known
as the Ehrhart polynomial of P. If we kept shrinking the lattice by taking a
limit, we would of course end up with the continuous volume that is given by
the usual Riemannian integral deﬁnition of calculus:
vol P = lim
k→∞#

P ∩1
k Zd
 1
kd .
However, pausing at ﬁxed dilations of the lattice gives surprising ﬂexibility
for the computation of the volume of P and for the number of lattice points
that are contained in P.
Thus, when the body P is an integral polytope, the error terms that mea-
sure the discrepancy between the discrete volume and the usual continuous
volume are quite nice; they are given by Ehrhart polynomials, and these enu-
meration polynomials are the content of Chapter 3.
The Fourier–Dedekind Sums Are the Building Blocks: Number
Theory
Every polytope has a discrete volume that is expressible in terms of certain
ﬁnite sums that are known as Dedekind sums. Before giving their deﬁnition, we
ﬁrst motivate these sums with some examples that illustrate their building-
block behavior for lattice-point enumeration. To be concrete, consider for
example a 1-dimensional polytope given by an interval P = [0, a], where a is
any positive real number. It is clear that we need the greatest integer function
⌊x⌋to help us enumerate the lattice points in P, and indeed the answer is
⌊a⌋+ 1.
Next, consider a 1-dimensional line segment that is sitting in the 2-
dimensional plane. Let’s pick our segment P so that it begins at the origin
and ends at the lattice point (c, d). As becomes apparent after a moment’s
thought, the number of lattice points on this ﬁnite line segment involves an
old friend, namely the greatest common divisor of c and d. The exact number
of lattice points on the line segment is gcd(c, d) + 1.
To unify both of these examples, consider a triangle P in the plane whose
vertices have rational coordinates. It turns out that a certain ﬁnite sum is
completely natural because it simultaneously extends both the greatest integer
function and the greatest common divisor, although the latter is less obvious.
An example of a Dedekind sum in two dimensions that arises naturally in the
formula for the discrete volume of the rational triangle P is the following:
s(a, b) =
b−1
X
m=1
m
b −1
2
 ma
b
−
jma
b
k
−1
2

.
The deﬁnition makes use of the greatest integer function. Why do these sums
also resemble the greatest common divisor? Luckily, the Dedekind sums sat-
isfy a remarkable reciprocity law, quite similar to the Euclidean algorithm

Preface
XI
that computes the gcd. This reciprocity law allows the Dedekind sums to be
computed in roughly log(b) steps rather than the b steps that are implied by
the deﬁnition above. The reciprocity law for s(a, b) lies at the heart of some
amazing number theory that we treat in an elementary fashion, but that also
comes from the deeper subject of modular forms and other modern tools.
We ﬁnd ourselves in the fortunate position of viewing an important tip of
an enormous mountain of ideas, submerged by the waters of geometry. As we
delve more deeply into these waters, more and more hidden beauty unfolds
for us, and the Dedekind sums are an indispensable tool that allow us to see
further as the waters get deeper.
The Relevant Solids Are Polytopes: Geometry
The examples we have used, namely line segments and polygons in the plane,
are special cases of polytopes in all dimensions. One way to deﬁne a polytope
is to consider the convex hull of a ﬁnite collection of points in Euclidean
space Rd. That is, suppose someone gives us a set of points v1, . . . , vn in
Rd. The polytope determined by the given points vj is deﬁned by all linear
combinations c1v1+c2v2+· · ·+cnvn, where the coeﬃcients cj are nonnegative
real numbers that satisfy the relation c1 +c2 +· · ·+cn = 1. This construction
is called the vertex description of the polytope.
There is another equivalent deﬁnition, called the hyperplane description
of the polytope. Namely, if someone hands us the linear inequalities that
deﬁne a ﬁnite collection of half-spaces in Rd, we can deﬁne the associated
polytope as the simultaneous intersection of the half-spaces deﬁned by the
given inequalities.
There are some “obvious” facts about polytopes that are intuitively clear
to most students but are, in fact, subtle and often nontrivial to prove from ﬁrst
principles. Two of these facts, namely that every polytope has both a vertex
and a hyperplane description, and that every polytope can be triangulated,
form a crucial basis to the material we will develop in this book. We carefully
prove both facts in the appendices. The two main statements in the appen-
dices are intuitively clear, so that novices can skip over their proofs without
any detriment to their ability to compute continuous and discrete volumes of
polytopes. All theorems in the text (including those in the appendices) are
proved from ﬁrst principles, with the exception of the last chapter, where we
assume basic notions from complex analysis.
The text naturally ﬂows into two parts, which we now explicate.
Part I
We have taken great care in making the content of the chapters ﬂow seamlessly
from one to the next, over the span of the ﬁrst six chapters.
•
Chapters 1 and 2 introduce some basic notions of generating functions, in
the visually compelling context of discrete geometry, with an abundance
of detailed motivating examples.

the other hand, to fully understand Dedekind sums, we need to understand
ﬁnite Fourier analysis, which we therefore develop from ﬁrst principles in
Chapter 7, using only partial fractions.
•
Chapter 9 answers a simple yet tricky question: how does the ﬁnite geo-
metric series in one dimension extend to higher-dimensional polytopes?
Brion’s theorem give the elegant and decisive answer to this question.
•
Chapter 10 extends the interplay between the continuous volume and the
discrete volume of a polytope (already studied in detail in Part I) by
introducing Euler–Maclaurin summation formulas in all dimensions. These
formulas compare the continuous Fourier transform of a polytope to its
discrete Fourier transform, yet the material is completely self-contained.
•
Chapter 11 develops an exciting extension of Ehrhart theory that deﬁnes
and studies the solid angles of a polytope; these are the natural extensions
of 2-dimensional angles to higher dimensions.
•
Finally, we end with another “dessert” chapter that uses complex ana-
lytic methods to ﬁnd an integral formula for the discrepancy between the
discrete and continuous areas enclosed by a closed curve in the plane.
Because polytopes are both theoretically useful (in triangulated manifolds,
for example) and practically essential (in computer graphics, for example) we
use them to link results in number theory and combinatorics. There are many
research papers being written on these interconnections, even as we speak,
and it is impossible to capture them all here; however, we hope that these
modest beginnings will give the reader who is unfamiliar with these ﬁelds a
good sense of their beauty, inexorable connectedness, and utility. We have
written a gentle invitation to what we consider a gorgeous world of counting
and of links between the ﬁelds of combinatorics, number theory, and geometry
for the general mathematical reader.
There are a number of excellent books that have a nontrivial intersec-
tion with ours and contain material that complements the topics discussed
here. We heartily recommend the monographs of Barvinok [12] (on general
convexity topics), Ehrhart [81] (the historic introduction to Ehrhart theory),
Ewald [82] (on connections to algebraic geometry), Hibi [96] (on the interplay
of algebraic combinatorics with polytopes), Miller–Sturmfels [132] (on com-
putational commutative algebra), and Stanley [172] (on general enumerative
problems in combinatorics).

The Coin-Exchange Problem of Frobenius
The full beauty of the subject of generating functions emerges only from tuning in
on both channels: the discrete and the continuous.
Herbert Wilf [187]
Suppose we’re interested in an inﬁnite sequence of numbers (ak)∞
k=0 that arises
geometrically or recursively. Is there a “good formula” for ak as a function of
k? Are there identities involving various ak’s? Embedding this sequence into
the generating function
F(z) =
X
k≥0
ak zk
allows us to retrieve answers to the questions above in a surprisingly quick
and elegant way. We can think of F(z) as lifting our sequence ak from its
discrete setting into the continuous world of functions.
1.1 Why Use Generating Functions?
To illustrate these concepts, we warm up with the classic example of the
Fibonacci sequence fk, named after Leonardo Pisano Fibonacci (1170–
1250?)1 and deﬁned by the recursion
f0 = 0, f1 = 1,
and fk+2 = fk+1 + fk for k ≥0 .
This gives the sequence (fk)∞
k=0 = (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . ) (see also
[165, Sequence A000045]). Now let’s see what generating functions can do for
us. Let

F(z) =

fk zk.
We embed both sides of the recursion identity into their generating functions:
X
k≥0
fk+2 zk =
X
k≥0
(fk+1 + fk) zk =
X
k≥0
fk+1 zk +
X
k≥0
fk zk.
(1.1)
The left–hand side of (1.1) is

k≥0
fk+2 zk = 1
z2
X
k≥0
fk+2 zk+2 = 1
z2
X
k≥2
fk zk = 1
z2 (F(z) −z) ,
while the right–hand side of (1.1) is
X
k≥0
fk+1 zk +
X
k≥0
fk zk = 1
z F(z) + F(z) .
So (1.1) can be restated as
1
z2 (F(z) −z) = 1
z F(z) + F(z) ,
or
F(z) =
z
1 −z −z2 .
It’s fun to check (e.g., with a computer) that when we expand the function F
into a power series, we indeed obtain the Fibonacci numbers as coeﬃcients:
z
1 −z −z2 = z + z2 + 2 z3 + 3 z4 + 5 z5 + 8 z6 + 13 z7 + 21 z8 + 34 z9 + · · · .
Now we use our favorite method of handling rational functions: the par-
tial fraction expansion. In our case, the denominator factors as 1 −z −z2 =

This method of decomposing a rational generating function into partial
fractions is one of our key tools. Because we will use partial fractions time
and again throughout this book, we record the result on which this method
is based.
Theorem 1.1 (Partial fraction expansion). Given any rational function
F(z) :=
p(z)
Qm
k=1 (z −ak)ek ,
where p is a polynomial of degree less than e1 + e2 + · · · + em and the ak’s are
distinct, there exists a decomposition

ck,1

ck,2

,
where ck,j ∈C are unique.
One possible proof of this theorem is based on the fact that the polynomials
form a Euclidean domain. For readers who are acquainted with this notion,
we outline this proof in Exercise 1.35.
1.2 Two Coins
Let’s imagine that we introduce a new coin system. Instead of using pennies,
nickels, dimes, and quarters, let’s say we agree on using 4-cent, 7-cent, 9-cent,
and 34-cent coins. The reader might point out the following ﬂaw of this new
system: certain amounts cannot be changed (that is, created with the available
coins), for example, 2 or 5 cents. On the other hand, this deﬁciency makes our
new coin system more interesting than the old one, because we can ask the
question, “which amounts can be changed?” In fact, we will prove in Exercise
1.20 that there are only ﬁnitely many integer amounts that cannot be changed
using our new coin system. A natural question, ﬁrst tackled by Ferdinand
Georg Frobenius (1849–1917),2 and James Joseph Sylvester (1814–1897)3 is,

1 The Coin-Exchange Problem of Frobenius
“what is the largest amount that cannot be changed?” As mathematicians,
we like to keep questions as general as possible, and so we ask, given coins of
denominations a1, a2, . . . , ad, which are positive integers without any common
factor, can you give a formula for the largest amount that cannot be changed
using the coins a1, a2, . . . , ad? This problem is known as the Frobenius coin-
exchange problem.
To be precise, suppose we’re given a set of positive integers
A = {a1, a2, . . . , ad}
with gcd (a1, a2, . . . , ad) = 1 and we call an integer n representable if there
exist nonnegative integers m1, m2, . . . , md such that
n = m1a1 + · · · + mdad .
In the language of coins, this means that we can change the amount n us-
ing the coins a1, a2, . . . , ad. The Frobenius problem (often called the linear
Diophantine problem of Frobenius) asks us to ﬁnd the largest integer that is
not representable. We call this largest integer the Frobenius number and
denote it by g(a1, . . . , ad). The following theorem gives us a pretty formula
for d = 2.
Theorem 1.2. If a1 and a2 are relatively prime positive integers, then
g (a1, a2) = a1a2 −a1 −a2 .
This simple-looking formula for g inspired a great deal of research into
formulas for g (a1, a2, . . . , ad) with only limited success; see the notes at the
end of this chapter. For d = 2, Sylvester gave the following result.
Theorem 1.3 (Sylvester’s theorem). Let a1 and a2 be relatively prime
positive integers. Exactly half of the integers between 1 and (a1 −1) (a2 −1)
are representable.
Our goal in this chapter is to prove these two theorems (and a little more)
using the machinery of partial fractions. We approach the Frobenius problem
through the study of the restricted partition function
pA(n) := #

(m1, . . . , md) ∈Zd : all mj ≥0, m1a1 + · · · + mdad = n
	
,
the number of partitions of n using only the elements of A as parts.4 In
view of this partition function, g(a1, . . . , ad) is the largest integer n for which
pA(n) = 0.
There is a beautiful geometric interpretation of the restricted partition
function. The geometric description begins with the set
4 A partition of a positive integer n is a multiset (i.e., a set in which we allow
repetition) {n1, n2, . . . , nk} of positive integers such that n = n1 + n2 + · · · + nk.
The numbers n1, n2, . . . , nk are called the parts of the partition.

P =

(x1, . . . , xd) ∈Rd : all xj ≥0, x1a1 + · · · + xdad = 1
	
.
(1.4)
The nth dilate of any set S ⊆Rd is
{(nx1, nx2, . . . , nxd) : (x1, . . . , xd) ∈S} .
The function pA(n) counts precisely those integer points that lie in the nth
integer dilate of the body P. The dilation process in this context is tantamount
to replacing x1a1+· · ·+xdad = 1 in the deﬁnition of P by x1a1+· · ·+xdad = n.
The set P turns out to be a polytope. We can easily picture P and its dilates
for dimension d ≤3; Figure 1.1 shows the three-dimensional case.

Recall that we require a and b to be relatively prime. To begin our discus-
sion, we start playing with generating functions. Consider the product of the
following two geometric series:

1
1 −za
 
1
1 −zb

=
 1 + za + z2a + · · ·
  1 + zb + z2b + · · ·

(see Exercise 1.2). If we multiply out all the terms we’ll get a power series all
of whose exponents are linear combinations of a and b. In fact, the coeﬃcient
of zn in this power series counts the number of ways that n can be written as
a nonnegative linear combination of a and b. In other words, these coeﬃcients
are precisely evaluations of our counting function p{a,b}:

1 −zb

=
X
k≥0

l≥0
zakzbl =
X
n≥0
p{a,b}(n) zn.
So this function is the generating function for the sequence of integers
 p{a,b}(n)
∞
n=0. The idea is now to study the compact function on the left.
We would like to uncover an interesting formula for p{a,b}(n) by looking at
the generating function on the left more closely. To make our computational
life easier, we study the constant term of a related series; namely, p{a,b}(n) is
the constant term of
f(z) :=
1
(1 −za) (1 −zb) zn =
X
k≥0
p{a,b}(k) zk−n.
The latter series is not quite a power series, since it includes terms with neg-
ative exponents. These series are called Laurent series, after Pierre Alphonse
Laurent (1813–1854). For a power series (centered at 0), we could simply eval-
uate the corresponding function at z = 0 to obtain the constant term; once
we have negative exponents, such an evaluation is not possible. However, if
we ﬁrst subtract all terms with negative exponents, we’ll get a power series
whose constant term (which remains unchanged) can now be computed by
evaluating this remaining function at z = 0.
To be able to compute this constant term, we will expand f into partial
fractions. As a warm-up to partial fraction decompositions, we ﬁrst work out
a one-dimensional example. Let’s denote the ﬁrst ath root of unity by
ξa := e2πi/a = cos 2π
a + i sin 2π
a ;
then all the ath roots of unity are 1, ξa, ξ2
a, ξ3
a, . . . , ξa−1
a
.
Example 1.4. Let’s ﬁnd the partial fraction expansion of
1
1−za . The poles of
this function are located at all ath roots of unity ξk
a for k = 0, 1, . . . , a −1. So
we expand

⊓⊔
Returning to restricted partitions, the poles of f are located at z = 0 with
multiplicity n, at z = 1 with multiplicity 2, and at all the other ath and bth
roots of unity with multiplicity 1 because a and b are relatively prime. Hence
our partial fraction expansion looks like

as z →1 to obtain
B2 = lim

by applying L’Hˆopital’s rule twice, for example. For the more interesting con-

again by applying L’Hˆopital’s rule.
We don’t need to compute the coeﬃcients A1, . . . , An, since they con-
tribute only to the terms with negative exponents, which we can safely ne-
glect; these terms do not contribute to the constant term of f. Once we have

the other coeﬃcients, the constant term of the Laurent series of f is—as we
said above—the following function evaluated at 0:

Encouraged by this initial success, we now proceed to analyze each sum in
(1.7) with the hope of recognizing them as more familiar objects.
For the next step we need to deﬁne the greatest-integer function ⌊x⌋,
which denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. A close sibling
to this function is the fractional-part function {x} = x −⌊x⌋. To readers
not familiar with the functions ⌊x⌋and {x} we recommend working through
Exercises 1.3–1.5.
What we’ll do next is study a special case, namely b = 1. This is appealing
because p{a,1}(n) simply counts integer points in an interval:
p{a,1}(n) = #

(k, l) ∈Z2 : k, l ≥0, ak + l = n
	
= # {k ∈Z : k ≥0, ak ≤n}

1.4 Sylvester’s Result
Before we apply Theorem 1.5 to obtain the classical Theorems 1.2 and 1.3, we
return for a moment to the geometry behind the restricted partition function
p{a,b}(n). In the two-dimensional case (which is the setting of Theorem 1.5),
we are counting integer points (x, y) ∈Z2 on the line segments deﬁned by the
constraints
ax + by = n ,
x, y ≥0 .
As n increases, the line segment gets dilated. It is not too far-fetched (al-
though Exercise 1.13 teaches us to be careful with such statements) to expect
that the likelihood for an integer point to lie on the line segment increases
with n. In fact, one might even guess that the number of points on the line
segment increases linearly with n, since the line segment is a one-dimensional
object. Theorem 1.5 quantiﬁes the previous statement in a very precise form:
p{a,b}(n) has the “leading term” n/ab, and the remaining terms are bounded
as functions in n. Figure 1.2 shows the geometry behind the counting func-
tion p{4,7}(n) for the ﬁrst few values of n. Note that the thick line segment
for n = 17 = 4 · 7 −4 −7 is the last one that does not contain any integer
point.
Lemma 1.6. If a and b are relatively prime positive integers and n ∈[1, ab−1]
is not a multiple of a or b, then
p{a,b}(n) + p{a,b}(ab −n) = 1 .
In other words, for n between 1 and ab −1 and not divisible by a or b, exactly
one of the two integers n and ab −n is representable in terms of a and b.

Here, (⋆) follows from the fact that {−x} = 1−{x} if x ̸∈Z (see Exercise 1.5).
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 1.2. We have to show that p{a,b}(ab −a −b) = 0 and that
p{a,b}(n) > 0 for every n > ab −a −b. The ﬁrst assertion follows with Exer-
cise 1.24, which states that p{a,b}(a + b) = 1, and Lemma 1.6. To prove the
second assertion, we note that for any integer m,
 m

⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 1.3. Recall that Lemma 1.6 states that for n between 1 and
ab−1 and not divisible by a or b, exactly one of n and ab−n is representable.
There are
ab −a −b + 1 = (a −1)(b −1)

1.5 Three and More Coins
13
integers between 1 and ab −1 that are not divisible by a or b. Finally, we
note that p{a,b}(n) > 0 if n is a multiple of a or b, by the very deﬁnition of
p{a,b}(n). Hence the number of nonrepresentable integers is 1
2(a−1)(b−1).
⊓⊔
Note that we have proved even more. Essentially by Lemma 1.6, every
positive integer less than ab has at most one representation. Hence, the rep-
resentable integers less than ab are uniquely representable (see also Exer-
cise 1.25).
1.5 Three and More Coins
What happens to the complexity of the Frobenius problem if we have more
than two coins? Let’s go back to our restricted partition function
pA(n) = #

(m1, . . . , md) ∈Zd : all mj ≥0, m1a1 + · · · + mdad = n
	
,
where A = {a1, . . . , ad}. By the very same reasoning as in Section 1.3, we can
easily write down the generating function for pA(n):
X
n≥0
pA(n) zn =

1
1 −za1
 
1
1 −za2

· · ·

1
1 −zad

.
We use the same methods that were exploited in Section 1.3 to recover our
function pA(n) as the constant term of a useful generating function. Namely,
pA(n) = const

1
(1 −za1) (1 −za2) · · · (1 −zad) zn

.
We now expand the function on the right into partial fractions. For reasons
of simplicity we assume in the following that a1, . . . , ad are pairwise relatively
prime; that is, no two of the integers a1, a2, . . . , ad have a common factor.
Then our partial fraction expansion looks like
f(z) =
1
(1 −za1) · · · (1 −zad) zn
= A1
z + A2
z2 + · · · + An

1 The Coin-Exchange Problem of Frobenius
As before, we don’t have to compute the coeﬃcients A1, . . . , An, because they
don’t contribute to the constant term of f. For the computation of B1, . . . , Bd,
we may use a symbolic manipulation program such as Maple or Mathematica.
Again, once we have calculated these coeﬃcients, we can compute the constant
term of f by dropping all negative exponents and evaluating the remaining
function at 0:
pA(n) =
 
B1
z −1 + · · · +

We will study these sums in detail in Chapter 8. With this deﬁnition, we have
arrived at the following result.
Theorem 1.7. The restricted partition function for A = {a1, a2, . . . , ad},
where the ak’s are pairwise relatively prime, can be computed as
pA(n) = −B1 + B2 −· · · + (−1)dBd + s−n (a2, a3, . . . , ad; a1)
+ s−n (a1, a3, a4, . . . , ad; a2) + · · · + s−n (a1, a2, . . . , ad−1; ad) .
Here B1, B2, . . . , Bd are the partial fraction coeﬃcients in the expansion
(1.11).
⊓⊔
Example 1.8. We give the restricted partition functions for d = 3 and 4.
These closed-form formulas have proven useful in the reﬁned analysis of the
periodicity that is inherent in the restricted partition function pA(n). For
example, one can visualize the graph of p{a,b,c}(n) as a “wavy parabola,” as
its formula plainly shows.

Notes
1. The theory of generating functions has a long and powerful tradition. We
only touch on its utility. For those readers who would like to dig a little
deeper into the vast generating-function garden, we strongly recommend Herb
Wilf’s generatingfunctionology [187] and L´aszl´o Lov´asz’s Combinatorial Prob-
lems and Exercises [122]. The reader might wonder why we do not stress
convergence aspects of the generating functions we play with. Almost all of
our series are geometric series and have trivial convergence properties. In the
spirit of not muddying the waters of lucid mathematical exposition, we omit
such convergence details.
2. The Frobenius problem is named after Georg Frobenius, who apparently
liked to raise this problem in his lectures [41]. Theorem 1.2 is one of the

16
1 The Coin-Exchange Problem of Frobenius
famous folklore results and might be one of the most misquoted theorems
in all of mathematics. People usually cite James J. Sylvester’s problem in
[177], but his paper contains Theorem 1.3 rather than 1.2. In fact, Sylvester’s
problem had previously appeared as a theorem in [176]. It is not known who
ﬁrst discovered or proved Theorem 1.2. It is very conceivable that Sylvester
knew about it when he came up with Theorem 1.3.
3. The linear Diophantine problem of Frobenius should not be confused with
the postage-stamp problem. The latter problem asks for a similar determina-
tion, but adds an additional independent bound on the size of the integer
solutions to the linear equation.
4. Theorem 1.5 has an interesting history. The earliest appearance of this
result that we are aware of is in a paper by Tiberiu Popoviciu [148]. Popoviciu’s
formula has since been resurrected at least twice [161, 183].
5. Fourier–Dedekind sums ﬁrst surfaced implicitly in Sylvester’s work (see,
e.g., [175]) and explicitly in connection with restricted partition functions
in [104]. They were rediscovered in [25], in connection with the Frobenius
problem. The papers [157, 83] contain interesting connections to Bernoulli
and Euler polynomials. We will resume the study of the Fourier–Dedekind
sums in Chapter 8.
6. As we already mentioned above, the Frobenius problem for d ≥3 is much
harder than the case d = 2 that we have discussed. Certainly beyond d = 3,
the Frobenius problem is wide open, though much eﬀort has been put into its
study. The literature on the Frobenius problem is vast, and there is still much
room for improvement. The interested reader might consult the comprehensive
monograph [153], which surveys the references to almost all articles dealing
with the Frobenius problem and gives about 40 open problems and conjectures
related to the Frobenius problem. To give a ﬂavor, we mention two landmark
results that go beyond d = 2.
The ﬁrst one concerns the generating function r(z) := P
k∈R zk, where
R is the set of all integers representable by a given set of relatively prime
positive integers a1, a2, . . . , ad. It is not hard to see (Exercise 1.34) that
r(z) = p(z)/ (1 −za1) (1 −za2) · · · (1 −zad) for some polynomial p. This ra-
tional generating function contains all the information about the Frobenius
problem; for example, the Frobenius number is the total degree of the function
1
1−z −r(z). Hence the Frobenius problem reduces to ﬁnding the polynomial
p, the numerator of r. Marcel Morales [134, 135] and Graham Denham [73]
discovered the remarkable fact that for d = 3, the polynomial p has either 4
or 6 terms. Moreover, they gave semi-explicit formulas for p. The Morales–
Denham theorem implies that the Frobenius number in the case d = 3 is
quickly computable, a result that is originally due, in various disguises, to
J¨urgen Herzog [95], Harold Greenberg [89], and J. Leslie Davison [65]. As

Exercises
17
much as there seems to be a well-deﬁned border between the cases d = 2
and d = 3, there also seems to be such a border between the cases d = 3
and d = 4: Henrik Bresinsky [43] proved that for d ≥4, there is no absolute
bound for the number of terms in the numerator p, in sharp contrast to the
Morales–Denham theorem.
On the other hand, Alexander Barvinok and Kevin Woods [14] proved
that for ﬁxed d, the rational generating function r(z) can be written as a
“short” sum of rational functions; in particular, r can be eﬃciently computed
when d is ﬁxed. A corollary of this fact is that the Frobenius number can
be eﬃciently computed when d is ﬁxed; this theorem is due to Ravi Kannan
[105]. On the other hand, Jorge Ram´ırez-Alfons´ın [152] proved that trying to
eﬃciently compute the Frobenius number is hopeless if d is left as a variable.
While the above results settle the theoretical complexity of the computa-
tion of the Frobenius number, practical algorithms are a completely diﬀerent
matter. Both Kannan’s and Barvinok–Woods’s ideas seem complex enough
that nobody has yet tried to implement them. Currently, the fastest algo-
rithm is presented in [32].

Here is an outline of one possible proof. Recall that the set of polynomials
(over R or C) forms a Euclidean domain, that is, given any two polynomials
a(z), b(z), there exist polynomials q(z), r(z) with deg(r) < deg(b), such that
a(z) = b(z)q(z) + r(z) .
Applying this procedure repeatedly (the Euclidean algorithm) gives the great-
est common divisor of a(z) and b(z) as a linear combination of them, that
is, there exist polynomials c(z) and d(z) such that a(z)c(z) + b(z)d(z) =
gcd (a(z), b(z)).
Step 1: Apply the Euclidean algorithm to show that there exist polynomials
u1, u2 such that
u1(z) (z −a1)e1 + u2(z) (z −a2)e2 = 1 .
Step 2: Deduce that there exist polynomials v1, v2 with deg (vk) < ek such
that

(z −a1)e1 (z −a2)e2 =
v1(z)
(z −a1)e1 +
v2(z)

A Gallery of Discrete Volumes
Few things are harder to put up with than a good example.
Mark Twain (1835–1910)
A unifying theme of this book is the study of the number of integer points
in polytopes, where the polytopes lives in a real Euclidean space Rd. The
integer points Zd form a lattice in Rd, and we often call the integer points lat-
tice points. This chapter carries us through concrete instances of lattice-point
enumeration in various integral and rational polytopes. There is a tremendous
amount of research taking place along these lines, even as the reader is looking
at these pages.
2.1 The Language of Polytopes
A polytope in dimension 1 is a closed interval; the number of integer points in
 a
b , c
d

is easily seen to be
 c
d

−
 a−1
b

(Exercise 2.1). A 2-dimensional convex
polytope is a convex polygon: a compact convex subset of R2 bounded by
a simple, closed curve that is made up of ﬁnitely many line segments.
In general dimension d, a convex polytope is the convex hull of ﬁnitely
many points in Rd. To be precise, given any ﬁnite point set {v1, v2, . . . , vn} ⊂
Rd, the polytope P is the smallest convex set containing those points; that is,
P = {λ1v1 + λ2v2 + · · · + λnvn : all λk ≥0 and λ1 + λ2 + · · · + λn = 1} .
This deﬁnition is called the vertex description of P, and we use the notation
P = conv {v1, v2, . . . , vn} ,
the convex hull of v1, v2, . . . , vn. In particular, a polytope is a closed sub-
set of Rd. Many polytopes we will study, however, are not deﬁned this way,

26
2 A Gallery of Discrete Volumes
but rather as bounded intersections of ﬁnitely many half-spaces and hyper-
planes. One example is the polytope P deﬁned by (1.4) in Chapter 1. This
hyperplane description of a polytope is, in fact, equivalent to the vertex
description. The fact that every polytope has both a vertex and a hyperplane
description is highly nontrivial, both algorithmically and conceptually. We
carefully work out a proof in Appendix A.
The dimension of a polytope P is the dimension of the aﬃne space
span P := {x + λ(y −x) : x, y ∈P, λ ∈R}
spanned by P. If P has dimension d, we use the notation dim P = d and call
P a d-polytope. Note that P ⊂Rd does not necessarily have dimension d. For
example, the polytope P deﬁned by (1.4) has dimension d −1.
Given a convex polytope P ⊂Rd, we say that the hyperplane H =

x ∈Rd : a · x = b
	
is a supporting hyperplane of P if P lies entirely on
one side of H, that is, P ⊂

x ∈Rd : a · x ≤b
	
or P ⊂

x ∈Rd : a · x ≥b
	
.
A face of P is a set of the form P ∩H, where H is a supporting hyperplane
of P. Note that P itself is a face of P, corresponding to the degenerate hyper-
plane Rd,1 and the empty set ∅is a face of P, corresponding to a hyperplane
that does not meet P. The (d −1)-dimensional faces are called facets, the 1-
dimensional faces edges, and the 0-dimensional faces vertices of P. Vertices
are the “extreme points” of a polytope.
A convex d-polytope has at least d + 1 vertices. A convex d-polytope with
exactly d+1 vertices is called a d-simplex. Every 1-dimensional convex poly-
tope is a 1-simplex, namely, a line segment. The 2-dimensional simplices are
the triangles, the 3-dimensional simplices the tetrahedra.
A convex polytope P is called integral if all of its vertices have inte-
ger coordinates, and P is called rational if all of its vertices have rational
coordinates.
2.2 The Unit Cube
As a warm-up example, we begin with the unit d-cube 2 := [0, 1]d, which
simultaneously oﬀers simple geometry and an endless fountain of research
questions. The vertex description of 2 is given by the set of 2d vertices
{(x1, x2, . . . , xd) : all xk = 0 or 1}. The hyperplane description is
2 =

(x1, x2, . . . , xd) ∈Rd : 0 ≤xk ≤1 for all k = 1, 2, . . . , d
	
.
Thus, there are the 2d bounding hyperplanes x1 = 0, x1 = 1, x2 = 0, x2 =
1, . . . , xd = 0, xd = 1.
1 In the remainder of the book, we will reserve the term hyperplane for non-
degenerate hyperplanes, i.e., sets of the form

x ∈Rd : a · x = b
	
, where not all
of the entries of a are zero.

2.2 The Unit Cube

We now compute the discrete volume of any integer dilate of 2. That is,
we seek the number of integer points t 2∩Zd for all t ∈Z>0. Here tP denotes
the dilated polytope
{(tx1, tx2, . . . , txd) : (x1, x2, . . . , xd) ∈P} ,
for any polytope P. What is the discrete volume of 2? We dilate by the
positive integer t, as depicted in Figure 2.1, and count:
#

 [0, t]d ∩Zd
= (t + 1)d.

We generally denote the lattice-point enumerator for the tth dilates of
P ⊂Rd by
LP(t) := #

,
a useful object that we also call the discrete volume of P. We may also
think of leaving P ﬁxed and shrinking the integer lattice:
LP(t) = #

With this convention, L2(t) = (t + 1)d, a polynomial in the integer variable t.

What about the interior 2◦of the cube? The number of interior integer
points in t 2◦is
L2◦(t) = #
 t 2◦∩Zd

 (0, t)d ∩Zd
= (t −1)d.
Notice that this polynomial equals (−1)dL2(−t), the evaluation of the poly-
nomial L2(t) at negative integers, up to a sign.
We now introduce another important tool for analyzing any polytope P,
namely the generating function of LP:
EhrP(z) := 1 +
X
t≥1
LP(t) zt.
This generating function is also called the Ehrhart series of P.
In our case, the Ehrhart series of P = 2 takes on a special form. To
illustrate, we deﬁne the Eulerian number A (d, k) through
X
j≥0
jd zj =
Pd
k=0 A (d, k) zk
(1 −z)d+1

(See also [165, Sequence A008292].)
With this deﬁnition, we can now express the Ehrhart series of 2 in terms
of Eulerian numbers:

⊓⊔
2.3 The Standard Simplex
The standard simplex ∆in dimension d is the convex hull of the d + 1
points e1, e2, . . . , ed and the origin; here ej is the unit vector (0, . . . , 1, . . . , 0),
with a 1 in the jth position. Figure 2.2 shows ∆for d = 3. On the other hand,
∆can also be realized by its hyperplane description, namely
∆=

(x1, x2 . . . , xd) ∈Rd : x1 + x2 + · · · + xd ≤1 and all xk ≥0
	
.
In the case of the standard simplex, the dilate t∆is now given by
t∆=

(x1, x2, . . . , xd) ∈Rd : x1 + x2 + · · · + xd ≤t and all xk ≥0
	
.
To compute the discrete volume of ∆, we would like to use the methods devel-
oped in Chapter 1, but there’s an extra twist. The counting functions in Chap-
ter 1 were deﬁned by equalities, whereas the standard simplex is deﬁned by an
inequality. We are trying to count all integer solutions (m1, m2, . . . , md) ∈Zd
≥0
to
m1 + m2 + · · · + md ≤t .
(2.4)
To translate this inequality in d variables into an equality in d + 1 vari-
ables, we introduce a slack variable md+1 ∈Z≥0, which picks up the dif-
ference between the right-hand and left-hand sides of (2.4). So the number

(2.6)
for d ≥0. The constant-term identity (2.5) requires us to ﬁnd the coeﬃcient

. Hence the discrete volume
of ∆is given by L∆(t) =

also notice that (2.6) is, by deﬁnition, the Ehrhart series of ∆.
Let us repeat this computation for the interior ∆◦of the standard d-
simplex. Now we introduce a slack variable md+1 > 0, so that strict inequality
is forced:
L∆◦(t) = #

2.4 The Bernoulli Polynomials as Lattice-Point Enumerators of Pyramids
33
Consider a (d −1)-dimensional unit cube embedded into Rd and form
a d-dimensional pyramid by adjoining one more vertex at (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1), as
depicted in Figure 2.3. More precisely, this geometric object has the following
hyperplane description:
P =

(x1, x2, . . . , xd) ∈Rd : 0 ≤x1, x2, . . . , xd−1 ≤1 −xd ≤1
	
.
(2.9)
By deﬁnition, P is contained in the unit d-cube; in fact, its vertices are a
subset of the vertices of the d-cube.

Fig. 2.3. The pyramid P in dimension 3.
We now count lattice points in integer dilates of P. This number equals
#

(m1, m2, . . . , md) ∈Zd : 0 ≤mk ≤t −md ≤t for all k = 1, 2, . . . , d −1
	
.
In this case we just count the solutions to 0 ≤mk ≤t −md ≤t directly: once
we pick the integer md (between 0 and t), we have t −md + 1 independent
choices for each of the integers m1, m2, . . . , md−1. Hence
LP(t) =

k=1
kd−1 = 1
d (Bd(t + 2) −Bd) ,
(2.10)
by Lemma 2.3. This is, naturally, a polynomial in t.
We now turn our attention to the number of interior lattice points in P:
LP◦(t) = #

(m1, m2, . . . , md) ∈Zd : 0 < mk < t −md < t
for all k = 1, 2, . . . , d −1

By a similar counting argument,

t−1
X
md=1
(t −md −1)d−1 =
t−2
X
k=0
kd−1 = 1
d (Bd(t −1) −Bd) .
Incidentally, the Bernoulli polynomials are known (Exercise 2.15) to have the
symmetry
Bd(1 −x) = (−1)dBd(x) .
(2.11)
This identity coupled with the fact (Exercise 2.16) that
Bd = 0 for all odd d ≥3
(2.12)
gives the relation
LP(−t) = 1
d (Bd(−t + 2) −Bd) = 1
d (Bd (1 −(t −1)) −Bd)
= (−1)d 1
d (Bd(t −1) −Bd) = (−1)d LP◦(t) .
Next we compute the Ehrhart series of P. We can actually do this in
somewhat greater generality. Namely, for a (d −1)-polytope Q with vertices
v1, v2, . . . , vm, deﬁne Pyr(Q), the pyramid over Q, as the convex hull of
(v1, 0) , (v2, 0) , . . . , (vm, 0) , (0, . . . , 0, 1). In our example above, the d-polytope
P is equal to Pyr(2) for the unit (d−1)-cube 2. The number of integer points
in t Pyr(Q) is, by construction,
LPyr(Q)(t) = 1 + LQ(1) + LQ(2) + · · · + LQ(t) = 1 +
t
X
j=1
LQ(j) ,
because in t Pyr(Q), there is one lattice point with xd-coordinate t, LQ(1)
lattice points with xd-coordinate t−1, LQ(2) lattice points with xd-coordinate
t−2, etc., up to LQ(t) lattice points with xd = 0. Figure 2.4 shows the instance
t = 3 for a pyramid over a square.
This identity for LPyr(Q)(t) allows us to compute the Ehrhart series of
Pyr(Q) from the Ehrhart series of Q:

2.5 The Lattice-Point Enumerators
of the Cross-Polytopes
Consider the cross-polytope 3 in Rd given by the hyperplane description
3 :=

(x1, x2, . . . , xd) ∈Rd : |x1| + |x2| + · · · + |xd| ≤1
	
.
(2.14)
Figure 2.5 shows the 3-dimensional instance of 3, an octahedron. The vertices
of 3 are (±1, 0, . . . , 0) , (0, ±1, 0, . . . , 0) , . . . , (0, . . . , 0, ±1).

Fig. 2.5. The cross-polytope 3 in dimension 3.
To compute the discrete volume of 3, we use a process similar to that of
Section 2.4. Namely, for a (d −1)-polytope Q with vertices v1, v2, . . . , vm,
deﬁne BiPyr(Q), the bipyramid over Q, as the convex hull of
(v1, 0) , (v2, 0) , . . . , (vm, 0) , (0, . . . , 0, 1) ,
and (0, . . . , 0, −1) .
In our example above, the d-dimensional cross-polytope is the bipyramid
over the (d −1)-dimensional cross-polytope. The number of integer points in
t BiPyr(Q) is, by construction,
LBiPyr(Q)(t) = 2 + 2LQ(1) + 2LQ(2) + · · · + 2LQ(t −1) + LQ(t)
= 2 + 2
t−1
X
j=1
LQ(j) + LQ(t) .
This identity allows us to compute the Ehrhart series of BiPyr(Q) from the
Ehrhart series of Q, in a manner similar to the proof of Theorem 2.4. We leave
the proof of the following result as Exercise 2.23.

2.5 The Lattice-Point Enumerators of the Cross-Polytopes
37
Theorem 2.6. If Q contains the origin, then EhrBiPyr(Q)(z) = 1+z
1−z EhrQ(z).
⊓⊔
This theorem allows us to compute the Ehrhart series of 3 eﬀortlessly:
The cross-polytope 3 in dimension 0 is the origin, with Ehrhart series
1
1−z.
The higher-dimensional cross-polytopes can be computed recursively through
Theorem 2.6 as
Ehr3(z) =
(1 + z)d
(1 −z)d+1 .
Since Ehr3(z) = 1 + P
t≥1 L3(t) zt, we can retrieve L3(t) by expanding
Ehr3(z) into its power series at z = 0:

2.6 Pick’s Theorem
Going back to basic concepts, we now give a complete account of LP for all
integral convex polygons P in R2. Denote the number of integer points inside
the polygon P by I, and the number of integer points on the boundary of P by
B. The following result, called Pick’s theorem in honor of its discoverer Georg
Alexander Pick (1859–1942), presents the astonishing fact that the area A of
P can be computed simply by counting lattice points:
Theorem 2.8 (Pick’s theorem). For an integral convex polygon,
A = I + 1
2B −1 .
Proof. We start by proving that Pick’s identity has an additive character: we
can decompose P into the union of two integral polygons P1 and P2 by joining
two vertices of P with a line segment, as shown in Figure 2.6.
P1
P2
Fig. 2.6. Decomposition of a polygon into two.
We claim that the validity of Pick’s identity for P follows from the validity
of Pick’s identity for P1 and P2. Denote the area, number of interior lattice

2.6 Pick’s Theorem
39
points, and number of boundary lattice points of Pk by Ak, Ik, and Bk,
respectively, for k = 1, 2. Clearly,
A = A1 + A2 .
Furthermore, if we denote the number of lattice points on the edge common
to P1 and P2 by L, then
I = I1 + I2 + L −2
and
B = B1 + B2 −2L + 2 .
Thus
I + 1
2B −1 = I1 + I2 + L −2 + 1
2B1 + 1
2B2 −L + 1 −1
= I1 + 1
2B1 −1 + I2 + 1
2B2 −1 .
This proves the claim. Note that our proof also shows that the validity of
Pick’s identity for P1 follows from the validity of Pick’s identity for P and P2.
Fig. 2.7. Triangulation of a polygon.
Now, any convex polygon can be decomposed into triangles that share a
common vertex, as illustrated in Figure 2.7. Hence it suﬃces to prove Pick’s
theorem for triangles. Further simplifying the picture, we can embed any
integral triangle into an integral rectangle as suggested by Figure 2.8.

This reduces the proof of Pick’s theorem to proving the theorem for integral
rectangles whose edges are parallel to the coordinate axes, and for rectangular
triangles two of whose edges are parallel to the coordinate axes. These two
cases are left to the reader as Exercise 2.24.
⊓⊔
Pick’s theorem allows us not only to count the lattice points strictly inside
the polygon P but also the total number of lattice points contained in P,
because this number is
I + B = A −1
2B + 1 + B = A + 1
2B + 1 .
(2.15)
From this identity, it is now easy to describe the lattice-point enumerator LP:
Theorem 2.9. Suppose P is an integral convex polygon with area A and B
lattice points on its boundary.
(a) The lattice-point enumerator of P is the polynomial
LP(t) = A t2 + 1
2B t + 1 .
(b) Its evaluation at negative integers yields the relation
LP(−t) = LP◦(t) .
(c) The Ehrhart series of P is
EhrP(z) =
 A −B
2 + 1

z2 +
 A + B
2 −2

z + 1
(1 −z)3
.
Note that in the numerator of the Ehrhart series, the coeﬃcient of z2 is LP◦(1),
and the coeﬃcient of z is LP(1) −3.
Proof. Statement (a) follows from (2.15) if we can prove that the area of tP
is At2, and the number of boundary points on tP is Bt, which is the content
of Exercise 2.25. Statement (b) follows with LP◦(t) = LP(t)−Bt. Finally, the
Ehrhart series is

2.7 Polygons with Rational Vertices

2.7 Polygons with Rational Vertices
In this section we will establish formulas for the number of integer points in
any rational convex polygon and its integral dilates.
A natural ﬁrst step is to ﬁx a triangulation of the polygon P, which reduces
our problem to that of counting integer points in rational triangles. However,
this procedure merits some remarks. After counting lattice points in the tri-
angles, we need to put those back together to form the polygon. But then we
need to take care of the overcounting on line segments (where the triangles
meet). Computing the number of lattice points on rational line segments is
considerably easier than enumerating lattice points in 2-dimensional regions;
however, it is still nontrivial (see Popoviciu’s Theorem 1.5).
After triangulating P, we can further simplify the picture by embedding an
arbitrary rational triangle in a rational rectangle as in Figure 2.8. To compute
lattice points in a triangle, we can ﬁrst count the points in a rectangle with
edges parallel to the coordinate axes, and then subtract the number of points
in three right triangles, each with two edges are parallel to the axes, and
possibly another rectangle, as shown in Figure 2.8. Since rectangles are easy
to deal with (see Exercise 2.2), the problem reduces to ﬁnding a formula for
a right triangle two of whose edges are parallel to the coordinate axes.
We now adjust and expand our generating-function machinery to these
right triangles. Such a triangle T is a subset of R2 consisting of all points
(x, y) satisfying
x ≥a
d , y ≥b
d , ex + fy ≤r
for some integers a, b, d, e, f, r (with ea+fb ≤rd; otherwise, the triangle would
be empty). Because the lattice point count is invariant under horizontal and
vertical integer translations and under ﬂipping about the x- or y-axis, we may
assume that a, b, d, e, f, r ≥0 and a, b < d. (One should meditate about this
fact for a minute.) Thus we arrive at the triangle T depicted in Figure 2.9.
To make our life a little easier, let’s assume for the moment that e and f
are relatively prime; we will deal with the general case in the exercises. So let
T =

(x, y) ∈R2 : x ≥a
d , y ≥b

(2.16)
To derive a formula for
LT (t) = #

(m, n) ∈Z2 : m ≥ta
d , n ≥tb
d , em + fn ≤tr

we want to use methods similar to those in Chapter 1. As in Section 2.3, we
introduce a slack variable s:
LT (t) = #

(m, n) ∈Z2 : m ≥ta
d , n ≥tb

(2.18)
To extract the coeﬃcient of ztr of our generating function (2.17), we use
familiar methods. As usual, we shift this coeﬃcient to a constant term:

Before we apply the partial fraction machinery to this function, we should
make sure that it is indeed a proper rational function, that is, that the total
degree satisﬁes
u + v −tr −e −f −1 < 0
(2.19)
(see Exercise 2.31). Then we expand into partial fractions (here we’re using
our assumption that e and f do not have any common factors!):

The general formula for LT —not assuming that e and f are relatively
prime—is the content of Exercise 2.34.
Let us pause for a moment and study the nature of LT as a function
of t. Aside from the last two ﬁnite sums (which will be put in the spotlight
in Chapter 8) and the appearance of u and v, LT is a quadratic polynomial
in t. And in those two sums, t appears only in the exponent of roots of unity,
namely as the exponent of ξe and ξf. As a function of t, ξt
e is periodic with
period e, and similarly ξt
f is periodic with period f. We should also remember
that u and v are functions of t; but they can be easily written in terms of
the fractional-part function, which again gives rise to periodic functions in t.
So LT (t) is a (quadratic) “polynomial” in t, whose coeﬃcients are periodic
functions in t. This is reminiscent of the counting functions of Chapter 1, which
showed a similar periodic-polynomial behavior. Inspired by both examples, we
deﬁne a quasipolynomial Q as an expression of the form Q(t) = cn(t) tn +

of Q is n,3 and the least common period of c0, . . . , cn is the period of Q.
Alternatively, for a quasipolynomial Q, there exist a positive integer k and
polynomials p0, p1, . . . , pk−1 such that

if t ≡k −1 mod k.
3 Here we tacitly assume that cn is not the zero function.

The minimal such k is the period of Q, and for this minimal k, the polynomials
p0, p1, . . . , pk−1 are the constituents of Q.
By the triangulation and embedding-in-a-box arguments that started this
section, we can now state a general structural result for rational polygons.
Theorem 2.11. Let P be any rational polygon. Then LP(t) is a quasipolyno-
mial of degree 2. Its leading coeﬃcient is the area of P (in particular, it is a
constant).
We have the technology at this point to also study the period of LP ; we
let the reader enjoy the ensuing details (see Exercise 2.35).
Proof. By Exercises 2.2 and 2.34 (the general form of Theorem 2.10), the the-
orem holds for rational rectangles and right triangles whose edges are parallel
to the axes. Now use the additivity of both degree-2 quasipolynomials and
areas, and Popoviciu’s theorem (Theorem 1.5).
⊓⊔
2.8 Euler’s Generating Function for General Rational
Polytopes
By now we have computed several instances of counting functions by set-
ting up a generating function that ﬁts the particular problem we’re interested
in. In this section, we set up such a generating function for the lattice-point
enumerator of any rational polytope. Such a polytope is given by its hyper-
plane description as an intersection of half-spaces and hyperplanes. The half-
spaces are algebraically given by linear inequalities, the hyperplanes by linear
equations. If the polytope is rational, we can choose the coeﬃcients of these
inequalities and equations to be integers (Exercise 2.7). To unify both de-
scriptions, we can introduce slack variables to turn the half-space inequalities
into equalities. Furthermore, by translating our polytope into the nonnegative
orthant (we can always shift a polytope by an integer vector without changing
the lattice-point count), we may assume that all points in the polytope have
nonnegative coordinates. In summary, after a harmless integer translation, we
can describe any rational polytope P as
P =

x ∈Rd
≥0 : A x = b
	
(2.23)
for some integral matrix A ∈Zm×d and some integer vector b ∈Zm. (Note
that d is not necessarily the dimension of P.) To describe the tth dilate of P,
we simply scale a point x ∈P by 1
t , or alternatively, multiply b by t:
tP =
n
x ∈Rd
≥0 : A x
t = b
o
=

x ∈Rd
≥0 : A x = tb
	
.
Hence the lattice-point enumerator of P is the counting function
LP(t) = #

x ∈Zd
≥0 : A x = tb
	
.

Using the ideas from Sections 1.3, 1.5, 2.3, and 2.7, we now construct a gen-
erating function for this counting function. In these previous sections, the
lattice-point enumerator could be described with only one nontrivial linear
equation, whereas now we have a system of such linear constraints. However,
we can use the same approach of encoding the linear equation into geometric
series; we just need more than one variable. When we expand the function
f (z1, z2) :=
1
(1 −z1z2) (1 −z2
1z2) (1 −z1) (1 −z2) z3t
1 z2t

into geometric series, we have

Returning to the general case of a polytope P given by (2.23), we denote
the columns of A by c1, c2, . . . , cd. Let z = (z1, z2, . . . , zm) and expand the
function

z = (z1, z2, . . . , zm) ∈Cm and c = (c1, c2, . . . , cm) ∈Zm. When multiplying
out everything, a typical term will look like
n1c1 + n2c2 + · · · + ndcd −tb = An −tb ,
where n = (n1, n2, . . . , nd) ∈Zd
≥0. That is, if we take the constant term of our
generating function (2.25), we’re counting integer vectors n ∈Zd
≥0 satisfying
An −tb = 0 ,
that is,
An = tb .
So this constant term will pick up exactly the number of lattice points n ∈Zd

Notes
1. Convex polytopes are beautiful objects with a rich history and interest-
ing theory, which we have only glimpsed here. For a good introduction to
polytopes, we recommend [47, 90, 193]. Polytopes appear in a vast range
of current research areas, including Gr¨obner bases and commutative algebra
[174], combinatorial optimization [159], integral geometry [110], and geometry
of numbers [163].
2. The distinction between the vertex and hyperplane description of a convex
polytope leads to an interesting algorithmic question; namely, how quickly can
we retrieve the ﬁrst piece of data from the second and vice versa [159, 193]?
3. Ehrhart series are named after Eug`ene Ehrhart (1906–2000),4 in antici-
pation of the theorems we will prove in Chapter 3. The Ehrhart series of a
polytope belonging to the special class of normal polytopes equals another
rational generating function, the Hilbert–Poincar´e series. These series appear
in the study of graded algebras (see, for example, [96, 171]). Ehrhart series also
appear in the context of toric varieties, a vast and fruitful subject [64, 84].
4. The Eulerian numbers A (d, k) are named after Leonhard Euler (1707–
1783)5 and arise naturally in the statistics of permutations: A (d, k) counts
permutations of {1, 2, . . . , d} with k −1 ascents. For more on A (d, k), see [62,
Section 6.5].

5. The pyramids of Section 2.4 have an interpretation as order polytopes [172].
A curious fact about the lattice-point enumerators of these pyramids is that
they have arbitrarily large real roots as the dimension grows [24].
6. The counting function L3 for the cross-polytope can, incidentally, also be
written as
min(d,t)
X
k=0
2k
d
k
t
k

.
In particular, L3 is symmetric in d and t. The cross-polytope counting func-
tions bear a connection to Laguerre polynomials, the d-dimensional harmonic
oscillator, and the Riemann hypothesis. This connection appeared in [51],
where Daniel Bump, Kwok-Kwong Choi, P¨ar Kurlberg, and Jeﬀrey Vaaler
also found a curious fact about the roots of the polynomials L3: they all have
real part −1
2 (an instance of a local Riemann hypothesis). This fact was proved
independently by Peter Kirschenhofer, Attila Peth˝o, and Robert Tichy [109];
see also the Notes in Chapter 4.
7. Theorem 2.8 marks the beginning of the general study of lattice-point
enumeration in polytopes. Its amazingly simple statement was discovered by
Georg Alexander Pick (1859–1942)6 in 1899 [143]. Pick’s theorem holds also
for a nonconvex polygon, provided its boundary forms a simple curve. In Chap-
ter 12, we prove a generalization of Pick’s theorem that includes nonconvex
curves.
8. The results of Section 2.7 appeared in [29]. We will see in Chapter 8 that
the ﬁnite sums over roots of unity can be rephrased in terms of Dedekind–
Rademacher sums, which—as we will see in Chapter 8—can be computed very
quickly. The theorems of Section 2.7 will then imply that the discrete volume
of any rational polygon can be computed eﬃciently.
9. If we replace tb in (2.24) by a variable integer vector v, the counting
function
f(v) = #

x ∈Zd
≥0 : A x = v
	
is called a vector partition function: it counts partitions of the vector v in terms
of the columns of A. Vector partition functions are the multivariate analogues
of our lattice-point enumerators LP(t), have many interesting properties, and
give rise to intriguing open questions [20, 40, 63, 173, 178].
10. While Leonhard Euler most likely did not think of lattice-point enumer-
ation in the sense of Ehrhart, we attribute Theorem 2.13 to him, since he
certainly worked with generating functions of this type, probably thinking of

tion for Ehrhart polynomials was already realized by Ehrhart [79, 81]. Several
modern approaches to computing Ehrhart polynomials are based on Theo-

Given the profusion of examples that gave rise to the polynomial behavior of
the integer-point counting function LP(t) for special polytopes P, we now ask
whether there is a general structure theorem. As the ideas unfold, the reader
is invited to look back at Chapters 1 and 2 as appetizers and indeed as special
cases of the theorems developed below.
3.1 Triangulations and Pointed Cones
Because most of the proofs that follow work like a charm for a simplex, we ﬁrst
dissect a polytope into simplices. This dissection is captured by the following
deﬁnition.
A triangulation of a convex d-polytope P is a ﬁnite collection T of d-
simplices with the following properties:
•
P =
[
∆∈T
∆.
•
For any ∆1, ∆2 ∈T, ∆1 ∩∆2 is a face common to both ∆1 and ∆2.
We say that P can be triangulated using no new vertices if there exists
a triangulation T such that the vertices of any ∆∈T are vertices of P.
Theorem 3.1 (Existence of triangulations). Every convex polytope can
be triangulated using no new vertices.
This theorem seems intuitively obvious but is not entirely trivial to prove.
We carefully work out a proof in Appendix B.

3 Counting Lattice Points in Polytopes: The Ehrhart Theory
Fig. 3.1. Two (very diﬀerent) triangulations of the 3-cube.
A pointed cone K ⊆Rd is a set of the form
K = {v + λ1w1 + λ2w2 + · · · + λmwm : λ1, λ2, . . . , λm ≥0} ,
where v, w1, w2, . . . , wm ∈Rd are such that there exists a hyperplane H for
which H ∩K = {v}; that is, K \ {v} lies strictly on one side of H. The
vector v is called the apex of K, and the wk’s are the generators of K.
The cone is rational if v, w1, w2, . . . , wm ∈Qd, in which case we may choose
w1, w2, . . . , wm ∈Zd by clearing denominators. The dimension of K is the
dimension of the aﬃne space spanned by K; if K is of dimension d, we call it a
d-cone. The d-cone K is simplicial if K has precisely d linearly independent
generators.
Just as polytopes have a description as an intersection of half-spaces, so
do pointed cones: A rational pointed d-cone is the d-dimensional intersection
of ﬁnitely many half-spaces of the form

x ∈Rd : a1x1 + a2x2 + · · · + adxd ≤b
	
with integral parameters a1, a2, . . . , ad, b ∈Z such that the corresponding
hyperplanes of the form

x ∈Rd : a1x1 + a2x2 + · · · + adxd = b
	
meet in exactly one point.
Cones are important for many reasons. The most practical for us is a
process called coning over a polytope. Given a convex polytope P ⊂Rd with
vertices v1, v2, . . . , vn, we lift these vertices into Rd+1 by adding a 1 as their
last coordinate. So, let
w1 = (v1, 1) , w2 = (v2, 1) , . . . , wn = (vn, 1) .
Now we deﬁne the cone over P as
cone(P) = {λ1w1 + λ2w2 + · · · + λnwn : λ1, λ2, . . . , λn ≥0} ⊂Rd+1.
This pointed cone has the origin as apex, and we can recover our original
polytope P (strictly speaking, the translated set {(x, 1) : x ∈P}) by cutting
cone(P) with the hyperplane xd+1 = 1, as shown in Figure 3.2.

3.1 Triangulations and Pointed Cones

Fig. 3.2. Coning over a polytope.
By analogy with the language of polytopes, we say that the hyperplane
H = {x ∈Rd : a·x = b} is a supporting hyperplane of the pointed d-cone
K if K lies entirely on one side of H, that is,
K ⊂

x ∈Rd : a · x ≤b
	
or
K ⊂

x ∈Rd : a · x ≥b
	
.
A face of K is a set of the form K ∩H, where H is a supporting hyperplane
of K. The (d −1)-dimensional faces are called facets and the 1-dimensional
faces edges of K. The apex of K is its unique 0-dimensional face.
Just as polytopes can be triangulated into simplices, pointed cones can be
triangulated into simplicial cones. So, a collection T of simplicial d-cones is a
triangulation of the d-cone K if it satisﬁes:
•
K =
[
S∈T
S .
•
For any S1, S2 ∈T, S1 ∩S2 is a face common to both S1 and S2.

3 Counting Lattice Points in Polytopes: The Ehrhart Theory
We say that K can be triangulated using no new generators if there
exists a triangulation T such that the generators of any S ∈T are generators
of P.
Theorem 3.2. Any pointed cone can be triangulated into simplicial cones us-
ing no new generators.
Proof. This theorem is really a corollary to Theorem 3.1. Given a pointed d-
cone K, there exists a hyperplane H that intersects K only at the apex. Now
translate H “into” the cone, so that H∩K consists of more than just one point.
This intersection is a (d −1)-polytope P, whose vertices are determined by
the generators of K. Now triangulate P using no new vertices. The cone over
each simplex of the triangulation is a simplicial cone. These simplicial cones,
by construction, triangulate K.
⊓⊔
3.2 Integer-Point Transforms for Rational Cones
We want to encode the information contained by the lattice points in a set
S ⊂Rd. It turns out that the following multivariate generating function allows
us to do this in an eﬃcient way if S is a rational cone or polytope:
σS(z) = σS (z1, z2, . . . , zd) :=
X
m∈S∩Zd
zm.
The generating function σS simply lists all integer points in S in a special
form: not as a list of vectors, but as a formal sum of monomials. We call σS
the integer-point transform of S; the function σS also goes by the name
moment generating function or simply generating function of S. The integer-
point transform σS opens the door to both algebraic and analytic techniques.
Example 3.3. As a warm-up example, consider the 1-dimensional cone K =
[0, ∞). Its integer-point transform is our old friend
σK(z) =
X
m∈[0,∞)∩Z
zm =
X
m≥0
zm =
1
1 −z .
⊓⊔
Example 3.4. Now we consider the two-dimensional cone
K := {λ1(1, 1) + λ2(−2, 3) : λ1, λ2 ≥0} ⊂R2
depicted in Figure 3.3. To obtain the integer-point transform σK, we tile K
by copies of the fundamental parallelogram
Π := {λ1(1, 1) + λ2(−2, 3) : 0 ≤λ1, λ2 < 1} ⊂R2.
More precisely, we translate Π by nonnegative integer linear combinations
of the generators (1, 1) and (−2, 3), and these translates will exactly cover

3.2 Integer-Point Transforms for Rational Cones
61
K. How can we list the integer points in K as monomials? Let’s ﬁrst list all
vertices of the translates of Π. These are nonnegative integer combinations of
the generators (1, 1) and (−2, 3), so we can list them using geometric series:
X
m=j(1,1)+k(−2,3)
j,k≥0
zm =

X
k≥0
zj(1,1)+k(−2,3) =

We now use the integer points (m, n) ∈Π to generate a subset of Z2 by adding
to (m, n) nonnegative linear integer combinations of the generators (1, 1) and
(−2, 3). Namely, we let
L(m,n) := {(m, n) + j(1, 1) + k(−2, 3) : j, k ∈Z≥0} .
It is immediate that K∩Z2 is the disjoint union of the subsets L(m,n) as (m, n)
ranges over Π ∩Z2 = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (−1, 2), (−1, 3)}. Hence

3 Counting Lattice Points in Polytopes: The Ehrhart Theory
Similar geometric series suﬃce to describe integer-point transforms for
simplicial d-cones. The following result utilizes the geometric series in several
directions simultaneously.
Theorem 3.5. Suppose
K := {λ1w1 + λ2w2 + · · · + λdwd : λ1, λ2, . . . , λd ≥0}
is a simplicial d-cone, where w1, w2, . . . , wd ∈Zd. Then for v ∈Rd, the
integer-point transform σv+K of the shifted cone v+K is the rational function
σv+K(z) =
σv+Π(z)
(1 −zw1) (1 −zw2) · · · (1 −zwd) ,
where Π is the half-open parallelepiped
Π := {λ1w1 + λ2w2 + · · · + λdwd : 0 ≤λ1, λ2, . . . , λd < 1} .
The half-open parallelepiped Π is called the fundamental parallelepiped
of K.
Proof. In σv+K(z) = P
m∈(v+K)∩Zd zm, we list each integer point m in v + K
as the monomial zm. Such a lattice point can, by deﬁnition, be written as
m = v + λ1w1 + λ2w2 + · · · + λdwd
for some numbers λ1, λ2, . . . , λd ≥0. Because the wk’s form a basis of Rd, this
representation is unique. Let’s write each of the λk’s in terms of their integer
and fractional part: λk = ⌊λk⌋+ {λk}. So
m = v+
 {λ1} w1+{λ2} w2+· · ·+{λd} wd

+⌊λ1⌋w1+⌊λ2⌋w2+· · ·+⌊λd⌋wd ,
and we should note that, since 0 ≤{λk} < 1, the vector
p := v + {λ1} w1 + {λ2} w2 + · · · + {λd} wd
is in v+Π. In fact, p ∈Zd, since m and ⌊λk⌋wk are all integer vectors. Again
the representation of p in terms of the wk’s is unique. In summary, we have
proved that any m ∈v + K ∩Zd can be uniquely written as
m = p + k1w1 + k2w2 + · · · + kdwd
(3.1)
for some p ∈(v + Π) ∩Zd and some integers k1, k2, . . . , kd ≥0. On the other
hand, let us write the rational function on the right-hand side of the theorem
as a product of series:
σv+Π(z)
(1 −zw1) · · · (1 −zwd) =



If we multiply everything out, a typical exponent will look exactly like (3.1).
⊓⊔

3.2 Integer-Point Transforms for Rational Cones
63
Our proof contains a crucial geometric idea. Namely, we tile the cone v+K
with translates of v + Π by nonnegative integral combinations of the wk’s. It
is this tiling that gives rise to the nice integer-point transform in Theorem 3.5.
Computationally, we therefore favor cones over polytopes due to our ability
to tile a simplicial cone with copies of the fundamental domain, as above.
Another reason for favoring cones over polytopes appears in Brion’s theorem
in Chapter 9.
Theorem 3.5 shows that the real complexity of computing the integer-
point transform σv+K is embedded in the location of the lattice points in the
parallelepiped v + Π.
By mildly strengthening the hypothesis of Theorem 3.5, we obtain a
slightly easier generating function, a result we shall need in Section 3.4 and
Chapter 4.
Corollary 3.6. Suppose
K := {λ1w1 + λ2w2 + · · · + λdwd : λ1, λ2, . . . , λd ≥0}
is a simplicial d-cone, where w1, w2, . . . , wd ∈Zd, and v ∈Rd, such that the
boundary of v + K contains no integer point. Then
σv+K(z) =
σv+Π(z)
(1 −zw1) (1 −zw2) · · · (1 −zwd) ,
where Π is the open parallelepiped
Π := {λ1w1 + λ2w2 + · · · + λdwd : 0 < λ1, λ2, . . . , λd < 1} .
Proof. The proof of Theorem 3.5 goes through almost verbatim, except that
v+Π now has no boundary lattice points, so that there is no harm in choosing
Π to be open.
⊓⊔
Since a general pointed cone can always be triangulated into simplicial
cones, the integer-point transforms add up in an inclusion–exclusion manner
(note that the intersection of simplicial cones in a triangulation is again a
simplicial cone, by Exercise 3.2). Hence we have the following corollary.
Corollary 3.7. Given any pointed cone
K = {v + λ1w1 + λ2w2 + · · · + λmwm : λ1, λ2, . . . , λm ≥0}
with v ∈Rd, w1, w2, . . . , wm ∈Zd, the integer-point transform σK(z) evalu-
ates to a rational function in the coordinates of z.
⊓⊔
Philosophizing some more, one can show that the original inﬁnite sum
σK(z) converges only for z in a subset of Cd, whereas the rational function
that represents σK gives us its meromorphic continuation. Later, in Chapters
4 and 9, we make use of this continuation.

3 Counting Lattice Points in Polytopes: The Ehrhart Theory
3.3 Expanding and Counting Using Ehrhart’s Original
Approach
Here is the fundamental theorem concerning the lattice-point count in an
integral convex polytope.
Theorem 3.8 (Ehrhart’s theorem). If P is an integral convex d-polytope,
then LP(t) is a polynomial in t of degree d.
This result is due to Eug`ene Ehrhart, in whose honor we call LP the
Ehrhart polynomial of P. Naturally, there is an extension of Ehrhart’s
theorem to rational polytopes, which we will discuss in Section 3.7.
Our proof of Ehrhart’s theorem uses generating functions of the form
P
t≥0 f(t) zt, similar in spirit to the ones discussed in the beginning of Chap-
ter 1. If f is a polynomial, this power series takes on a special form, which we
invite the reader to prove (Exercise 3.8):
Lemma 3.9. If
X
t≥0
f(t) zt =
g(z)
(1 −z)d+1 ,
then f is a polynomial of degree d if and only if g is a polynomial of degree at
most d and g(1) ̸= 0.
⊓⊔
The reason we introduced generating functions of the form σS(z) =
P
m∈S∩Zd zm in Section 3.2 is that they are extremely handy for lattice-point
problems. The connection to lattice points is evident, since we are summing
over them. If we’re interested in the lattice-point count, we simply evaluate
σS at z = (1, 1, . . . , 1):
σS(1, 1, . . . , 1) =
X
m∈S∩Zd
1m =
X
m∈S∩Zd
1 = #
 S ∩Zd
.
(Here we denote by 1 a vector all of whose components are 1.) Naturally, we
should make this evaluation only if S is bounded; Theorem 3.5 already tells
us that it’s no fun evaluating σK(1) if K is a cone.
But the magic of the generating function σS does not stop there. To liter-
ally take it to the next level, we cone over a convex polytope P. If P ⊂Rd has
the vertices v1, v2, . . . , vn ∈Zd, recall that we lift these vertices into Rd+1,
by adding a 1 as their last coordinate. So let
w1 = (v1, 1) , w2 = (v2, 1) , . . . , wn = (vn, 1) .
Then
cone(P) = {λ1w1 + λ2w2 + · · · + λnwn : λ1, λ2, . . . , λn ≥0} ⊂Rd+1.

3.3 Expanding and Counting Using Ehrhart’s Original Approach
65
Recall that we can recover our original polytope P by cutting cone(P) with
the hyperplane xd+1 = 1. We can recover more than just the original polytope
in cone(P): By cutting the cone with the hyperplane xd+1 = 2, we obtain a
copy of P dilated by a factor of 2. (The reader should meditate on why this cut
is a 2-dilate of P.) More generally, we can cut the cone with the hyperplane
xd+1 = t and obtain tP, as suggested by Figure 3.4.
Fig. 3.4. Recovering dilates of P in cone(P).
Now let’s form the integer-point transform σcone(P) of cone(P). By what we
just said, we should look at diﬀerent powers of zd+1: there is one term (namely,
1), with z0
d+1, corresponding to the origin; the terms with z1
d+1 correspond to
lattice points in P (listed as monomials in z1, z2, . . . , zd), the terms with z2
d+1
correspond to points in 2P, etc. In short,

66
3 Counting Lattice Points in Polytopes: The Ehrhart Theory

d+1 + · · ·
= 1 +

Specializing further for enumeration purposes, we recall that σP (1, 1, . . . , 1) =

, and so
σcone(P) (1, 1, . . . , 1, zd+1) = 1 +

But by deﬁnition, the enumerators on the right-hand side are just evaluations
of Ehrhart’s counting function, that is, σcone(P) (1, 1, . . . , 1, zd+1) is nothing
but the Ehrhart series of P:
Lemma 3.10. σcone(P) (1, 1, . . . , 1, z) = 1 +
X
t≥1
LP(t) zt = EhrP(z) .
⊓⊔
With all this machinery at hand, we can prove Ehrhart’s theorem.
Proof of Theorem 3.8. It suﬃces to prove the theorem for simplices, because
we can triangulate any integral polytope into integral simplices, using no new
vertices. Note that these simplices will intersect in lower-dimensional integral
simplices.
By Lemma 3.9, it suﬃces to prove that for an integral d-simplex ∆,
Ehr∆(z) = 1 +
X
t≥1
L∆(t) zt =
g(z)
(1 −z)d+1
for some polynomial g of degree at most d with g(1) ̸= 0. In Lemma 3.10
we showed that the Ehrhart series of ∆equals σcone(∆) (1, 1, . . . , 1, z), so let’s
study the integer-point transform attached to cone(∆).
The simplex ∆has d+1 vertices v1, v2, . . . , vd+1, and so cone(∆) ⊂Rd+1
is simplicial, with apex the origin and generators
w1 = (v1, 1) , w2 = (v2, 1) , . . . , wd+1 = (vd+1, 1) ∈Zd+1.
Now we use Theorem 3.5:
σcone(∆) (z1, z2, . . . , zd+1) =
σΠ (z1, z2, . . . , zd+1)
(1 −zw1) (1 −zw2) · · · (1 −zwd+1) ,
where Π = {λ1w1 + λ2w2 + · · · + λd+1wd+1 : 0 ≤λ1, λ2, . . . , λd+1 < 1}. This
parallelepiped is bounded, so the attached generating function σΠ is a Laurent
polynomial in z1, z2, . . . , zd+1.

3.4 The Ehrhart Series of an Integral Polytope
67
We claim that the zd+1-degree of σΠ is at most d. In fact, since the xd+1-
coordinate of each wk is 1, the xd+1-coordinate of a point in Π is λ1+λ2+· · ·+
λd+1 for some 0 ≤λ1, λ2, . . . , λd+1 < 1. But then λ1 +λ2 +· · ·+λd+1 < d+1,
so if this sum is an integer it is at most d, which implies that the zd+1-degree
of σΠ (z1, z2, . . . , zd+1) is at most d. Consequently, σΠ (1, 1, . . . , 1, zd+1) is a
polynomial in zd+1 of degree at most d. The evaluation σΠ (1, 1, 1, . . . , 1) of this
polynomial at zd+1 = 1 is not zero, because σΠ (1, 1, 1, . . . , 1) = #
 Π ∩Zd+1
and the origin is a lattice point in Π.
Finally, if we specialize zwk to z1 = z2 = · · · = zd = 1, we obtain z1
d+1, so
that
σcone(∆) (1, 1, . . . , 1, zd+1) = σΠ (1, 1, . . . , 1, zd+1)
(1 −zd+1)d+1
.
The left–hand side is Ehr∆(zd+1) = 1+P
t≥1 L∆(t) zt
d+1 by Lemma 3.10.
⊓⊔
3.4 The Ehrhart Series of an Integral Polytope
We can actually take our proof of Ehrhart’s theorem one step further by study-
ing the polynomial σΠ (1, 1, . . . , 1, zd+1). As mentioned above, the coeﬃcient
of zk
d+1 simply counts the integer points in the parallelepiped Π cut with the
hyperplane xd+1 = k. Let us record this.
Corollary 3.11. Suppose ∆is an integral d-simplex with vertices v1, v2, . . . ,
vd+1, and let wj = (vj, 1). Then
Ehr∆(z) = 1 +
X
t≥1
L∆(t) zt = hd zd + hd−1 zd−1 + · · · + h1 z + h0
(1 −z)d+1
,
where hk equals the number of integer points in
{λ1w1 + λ2w2 + · · · + λd+1wd+1 : 0 ≤λ1, λ2, . . . , λd+1 < 1}
with last variable equal to k.
⊓⊔
This result can actually be used to compute Ehr∆, and therefore the
Ehrhart polynomial, of an integral simplex ∆in low dimensions very quickly
(a fact that the reader may discover in some of the exercises). We remark,
however, that things are not as simple for arbitrary integral polytopes. Not
only is triangulation a nontrivial task in general, but one would also have to
deal with overcounting where simplices of a triangulation meet.
Corollary 3.11 implies that the numerator of the Ehrhart series of an inte-
gral simplex has nonnegative coeﬃcients, since those coeﬃcients count some-
thing. Although the latter cannot be said of the coeﬃcients of the Ehrhart
series of a general integral polytope, the nonnegativity property magically
survives.

68
3 Counting Lattice Points in Polytopes: The Ehrhart Theory
Theorem 3.12 (Stanley’s nonnegativity theorem). Suppose P is an in-
tegral convex d-polytope with Ehrhart series
EhrP(z) = hd zd + hd−1 zd−1 + · · · + h0
(1 −z)d+1
.
Then h0, h1, . . . , hd ≥0.
Proof. Triangulate cone(P) ⊂Rd+1 into the simplicial cones K1, K2, . . . , Km.
Now Exercise 3.14 ensures that there exists a vector v ∈Rd+1 such that
cone(P) ∩Zd = (v + cone(P)) ∩Zd
(that is, we neither lose nor gain any lattice points when shifting cone(P) by
v) and neither the facets of v + cone(P) nor the triangulation hyperplanes
contain any lattice points. This implies that every lattice point in v+cone(P)
belongs to exactly one simplicial cone v + Kj:
cone(P) ∩Zd = (v + cone(P)) ∩Zd =
m
[
j=1
 (v + Kj) ∩Zd
,
(3.2)
and this union is a disjoint union. If we translate the last identity into
generating-function language, it becomes
σcone(P) (z1, z2, . . . , zd+1) =
m
X
j=1
σv+Kj (z1, z2, . . . , zd+1) .
But now we recall that the Ehrhart series of P is just a special evaluation of
σcone(P) (Lemma 3.10):
EhrP(z) = σcone(P) (1, 1, . . . , 1, z) =
m
X
j=1
σv+Kj (1, 1, . . . , 1, z) .
(3.3)
It suﬃces to show that the rational generating functions σv+Kj (1, 1, . . . , 1, z)
for the simplicial cones v + Kj have nonnegative numerator. But this fact
follows from evaluating the rational function in Corollary 3.6 at (1, 1, . . . , 1, z).
⊓⊔
This proof shows a little more: Since the origin is in precisely one simplicial
cone on the right-hand side of (3.2), we get on the right-hand side of (3.3)
precisely one term that contributes 1/(1 −z)d+1 to EhrP; all other terms
contribute to higher powers of the numerator polynomial of EhrP. That is,
the constant term h0 equals 1. The reader might feel that we are chasing our
tail at this point, since we assumed from the very beginning that the constant
term of the inﬁnite series EhrP is 1, and hence h0 has to be 1, as a quick look
at the expansion of the rational function representing EhrP shows. The above
argument shows merely that this convention is geometrically sound. Let us
record this:

3 Counting Lattice Points in Polytopes: The Ehrhart Theory
The representation of the polynomial LP(t) in terms of the coeﬃcients
of EhrP can be interpreted as the Ehrhart polynomial expressed in the basis

(see Exercise 3.9). This representation is very useful, as
the following results show.
Corollary 3.15. If P is an integral convex d-polytope, then the constant term
of the Ehrhart polynomial LP is 1.

⊓⊔
This proof is exciting, because it marks the ﬁrst instance where we extend
the domain of an Ehrhart polynomial beyond the positive integers, for which
the lattice-point enumerator was initially deﬁned. More precisely, Ehrhart’s
theorem (Theorem 3.8) implies that the counting function
LP(t) = #
 tP ∩Zd
,
originally deﬁned for positive integers t, can be extended to all real or even
complex arguments t (as a polynomial). A natural question arises: are there
nice interpretations of LP(t) for arguments t that are not positive integers?
Corollary 3.15 gives such an interpretation for t = 0. In Chapter 4, we will
give interpretations of LP(t) for negative integers t.
Corollary 3.16. Suppose P is an integral convex d-polytope with Ehrhart se-
ries
EhrP(z) = hd zd + hd−1 zd−1 + · · · + h1 z + 1
(1 −z)d+1
.
Then h1 = LP(1) −d −1 = #

Proof. Use the expansion of Lemma 3.14 with t = 1:

⊓⊔
The proof of Corollary 3.16 suggests that there are also formulas for
h2, h3, . . . in terms of the evaluations LP(1), LP(2), . . . , and we invite the
reader to ﬁnd them (Exercise 3.10).
A ﬁnal corollary to Theorem 3.12 and Lemma 3.14 states how large the
denominators of the Ehrhart coeﬃcients can be:
Corollary 3.17. Suppose P is an integral polytope with Ehrhart polynomial
LP(t) = cd td +cd−1 td−1 +· · ·+c1 t+1. Then all coeﬃcients satisfy d! ck ∈Z.

where the hk’s are integers. Hence multiplying out this expression yields a
polynomial in t whose coeﬃcients can be written as rational numbers with
denominator d!.
⊓⊔
We ﬁnish this section with a general result that gives relations between
negative integer roots of a polynomial and its generating function. This the-
orem will become handy in Chapter 4, in which we ﬁnd an interpretation for
the evaluation of an Ehrhart polynomial at negative integers.
Theorem 3.18. Suppose p is a degree-d polynomial with the rational gener-
ating function
X
t≥0
p(t) zt = hd zd + hd−1 zd−1 + · · · + h1 z + h0
(1 −z)d+1
.
Then hd = hd−1 = · · · = hk+1 = 0 and hk ̸= 0 if and only if p(−1) = p(−2) =
· · · = p (−(d −k)) = 0 and p (−(d −k + 1)) ̸= 0.
Proof. Suppose hd = hd−1 = · · · = hk+1 = 0 and hk ̸= 0. Then the proof of
Lemma 3.14 gives
p(t) = h0
t + d
d

+ · · · + hk−1

.
All the binomial coeﬃcients are zero for t = −1, −2, . . . , −d + k, so those are
roots of p. On the other hand, all binomial coeﬃcients but the last one are
zero for t = −d + k −1, and since hk ̸= 0, −d + k −1 is not a root of p.
Conversely, suppose p(−1) = p(−2) = · · · = p (−(d −k)) = 0 and
p (−(d −k + 1)) ̸= 0. The ﬁrst root −1 of p gives
0 = p(−1) = h0

so we must have hd = 0. The next root −2 forces hd−1 = 0, and so on, up to
the root −d + k, which forces hk+1 = 0. It remains to show that hk ̸= 0. But
if hk were zero then, by a similar line of reasoning as in the ﬁrst part of the
proof, p(−d + k −1) = 0, a contradiction.
⊓⊔
3.5 From the Discrete to the Continuous Volume
of a Polytope
Given a geometric object S ⊂Rd, its volume, deﬁned by the integral vol S :=
R
S dx, is one of the fundamental data of S. By the deﬁnition of the integral, say

72
3 Counting Lattice Points in Polytopes: The Ehrhart Theory
in the Riemannian sense, we can think of computing vol S by approximating
S with d-dimensional boxes that get smaller and smaller. To be precise, if
we take the boxes with side length 1/t then they each have volume 1/td. We
might further think of the boxes as ﬁlling out the space between grid points in
the lattice
  1
t Z
d. This means that volume computation can be approximated
by counting boxes, or equivalently, lattice points in
  1

d:
vol S = lim
t→∞
1
td · #
 
S ∩
1

.
It is a short step to counting integer points in dilates of S, because
#
 
S ∩
1
t Z
d!
= #
 tS ∩Zd
.
Let us summarize:
Lemma 3.19. Suppose S ⊂Rd is d-dimensional. Then
vol S = lim
t→∞
1
td · #
 tS ∩Zd
.
⊓⊔
We emphasize here that S is d-dimensional, because otherwise (since S could
be lower-dimensional although living in d-space), by our current deﬁnition
vol S = 0. (We will extend our volume deﬁnition in Chapter 5 to give nonzero
relative volume to objects that are not full-dimensional.)
Part of the magic of Ehrhart’s theorem lies in the fact that for an integral
d-polytope P, we do not have to take a limit to compute vol P; we need to
compute “only” the d + 1 coeﬃcients of a polynomial.
Corollary 3.20. Suppose P ⊂Rd is a integral convex d-polytope with Ehrhart
polynomial cd td + cd−1 td−1 + · · · + c1 t + 1. Then cd = vol P.
Proof. By Lemma 3.19,
vol P = lim
t→∞
cd td + cd−1 td−1 + · · · + c1 t + 1
td
= cd .
⊓⊔
On the one hand, this should not come as a surprise, because counting
integer points in some object should grow roughly like the volume of the
object as we make it bigger and bigger. On the other hand, the fact that we
can compute the volume as one term of a polynomial should be very surprising:
the polynomial is a counting function and as such is something discrete, yet by
computing it (and its leading term), we derive some continuous data. Even
more, we can—at least theoretically—compute this continuous datum (the
volume) of the object by calculating a few values of the polynomial and then
interpolating; this can be described as a completely discrete operation!
We ﬁnish this section by showing how to retrieve the continuous volume
of an integer polytope from its Ehrhart series.

3.6 Interpolation

Corollary 3.21. Suppose P ⊂Rd is an integral convex d-polytope, and
EhrP(z) = hd zd + hd−1 zd−1 + · · · + h1 z + 1
(1 −z)d+1
.
Then vol P = 1
d! (hd + hd−1 + · · · + h1 + 1) .
Proof. Use the expansion of Lemma 3.14. The leading coeﬃcient is
1
d! (hd + hd−1 + · · · + h1 + 1) .
⊓⊔
3.6 Interpolation
We now use the polynomial behavior of the discrete volume LP of an integral
polytope P to compute the continuous volume vol P and the discrete volume
LP from ﬁnite data.
Two points uniquely determine a line. There exists a unique quadratic
passing through any three given points. In general, a degree-d polynomial
p is determined by d + 1 points (x, p(x)) ∈R2. Namely, evaluating p(x) =
cdxd + cd−1xd−1 + · · · + c0 at distinct inputs x1, x2, . . . , xd+1 gives

(3.5)
(Exercise 3.16 makes sure that V is invertible.) The identity (3.5) gives the
famous Lagrange interpolation formula.
This gives us an eﬃcient way to compute LP, at least when dim P is not
too large. The continuous volume of P will follow instantly, since it is the
leading coeﬃcient cd of LP. In the case of an Ehrhart polynomial LP, we
know that LP(0) = 1, so that (3.4) simpliﬁes to

h + 9 = LTh(2) = vol (Th) · 23 + c2 · 22 + c1 · 2 + 1 .

3.7 Rational Polytopes and Ehrhart Quasipolynomials
We do not have to change much to study lattice-point enumeration for rational
polytopes, and most of this section will consist of exercises for the reader. The
structural result paralleling Theorem 3.8 is as follows.
Theorem 3.23 (Ehrhart’s theorem for rational polytopes). If P is a
rational convex d-polytope, then LP(t) is a quasipolynomial in t of degree
d. Its period divides the least common multiple of the denominators of the
coordinates of the vertices of P.
We will call the least common multiple of the denominators of the co-
ordinates of the vertices of P the denominator of P. Theorem 3.23, also
due to Ehrhart, extends Theorem 3.8, because the denominator of an integral
polytope P is one. Exercises 3.21 and 3.22 show that the word “divides” in
Theorem 3.23 is far from being replaceable by “equals.”
We start the path toward a proof of Theorem 3.23 by stating the analogue
of Lemma 3.9 for quasipolynomials (see Exercise 3.19):
Lemma 3.24. If
X
t≥0
f(t) zt = g(z)
h(z) ,
then f is a quasipolynomial of degree d with period dividing p if and only if g
and h are polynomials such that deg(g) < deg(h), all roots of h are pth roots
of unity of multiplicity at most d + 1, and there is a root of multiplicity equal
to d+1 (all of this assuming that g/h has been reduced to lowest terms).
⊓⊔
Our goal is now evident: we will prove that if P is a rational convex d-
polytope with denominator p, then
EhrP(z) = 1 +
X
t≥1
LP(t) zt =
g(z)
(1 −zp)d+1 ,
for some polynomial g of degree less than p(d + 1). As in Section 3.3, we will
have to prove this only for the case of a rational simplex. So suppose the d-
simplex ∆has vertices v1, v2, . . . , vd+1 ∈Qd, and the denominator of ∆is p.
Again we will cone over ∆: let

76
3 Counting Lattice Points in Polytopes: The Ehrhart Theory
w1 = (v1, 1) , w2 = (v2, 1) , . . . , wd+1 = (vd+1, 1) ;
then
cone(∆) = {λ1w1 + λ2w2 + · · · + λd+1wd+1 : λ1, λ2, . . . , λd+1 ≥0} ⊂Rd+1.
To be able to use Theorem 3.5, we ﬁrst have to ensure that we have a descrip-
tion of cone(∆) with integral generators. But since the denominator of ∆is p,
we can replace each generator wk by pwk ∈Zd+1, and we’re ready to apply
Theorem 3.5. From this point, the proof of Theorem 3.23 proceeds exactly like
that of Theorem 3.8, and we invite the reader to ﬁnish it up (Exercise 3.20).
Although the proofs of Theorem 3.23 and Theorem 3.8 are almost identical,
the arithmetic structure of Ehrhart quasipolynomials is much more subtle and
less well known than that of Ehrhart polynomials.
3.8 Reﬂections on the Coin-Exchange Problem
and the Gallery of Chapter 2
At this point, we encourage the reader to look back at the ﬁrst two chapters in
light of the basic Ehrhart-theory results. Popoviciu’s theorem (Theorem 1.5)
and its higher-dimensional analogue give a special set of Ehrhart quasipoly-
nomials. On the other hand, in Chapter 2 we encountered many integral
polytopes. Ehrhart’s theorem (Theorem 3.8) explains why their lattice-point
enumeration functions were all polynomials.
Notes
1. Triangulations of polytopes and manifolds are an active source of research
with many interesting open problems; see, e.g., [69].
2. Eug`ene Ehrhart laid the foundation for the central theme of this book in
the 1960s, starting with the proof of Theorem 3.8 in 1962 [79]. The proof we
give here follows Ehrhart’s original lines of thought. An interesting fact is that
he did his most beautiful work as a teacher at a lyc´ee in Strasbourg (France),
receiving his doctorate at age 60 on the urging of some colleagues.
3. Given any d linearly independent vectors w1, w2, . . . , wd ∈Rd, the lat-
tice generated by them is the set of all integer linear combinations of
w1, w2, . . . , wd. Alternatively, one can deﬁne a lattice as a discrete subgroup
of Rd, and these two notions can be shown to be equivalent. One might won-
der whether replacing the lattice Zd by an arbitrary lattice L throughout the
statements of the theorems—requiring now that the vertices of a polytope be
in L—gives us any diﬀerent results. The fact that the theorems of this chapter

Exercises
77
remain the same follows from the observation that any lattice can be mapped
to Zd by an invertible linear transformation.
4. Richard Stanley developed much of the theory of Ehrhart (quasi-)polyno-
mials, initially from a commutative-algebra point of view. Theorem 3.12 is
due to him [170]. The proof we give here appeared in [30]. An extension of
Theorem 3.12 was found by Takayuki Hibi; he proved that if hd > 0 then
hk ≥h1 for all 1 ≤k ≤d −1 (using the notation of Theorem 3.12) [98].
5. The tetrahedron Th of Example 3.22 was used by John Reeve to show that
Pick’s theorem does not hold in R3 (see Exercise 3.18) [154]. Incidentally, the
formula for LTh also proves that the coeﬃcients of an Ehrhart polynomial (of
a closed polytope) are not always positive.
6. There are several interesting questions (some of which are still open) regard-
ing the periods of Ehrhart quasipolynomials. Some particularly nice examples
about what can happen with periods were given by Tyrrell McAllister and
Kevin Woods [126].
7. Most of the results remain true if we replace “convex polytope” by “poly-
topal complex,” that is, a ﬁnite union of polytopes. One important exception
is Corollary 3.15: the constant term of an “Ehrhart polynomial” of an integral
polytopal complex C is the Euler characteristric of C.
8. The reader might wonder why we do not discuss polytopes with irrational
vertices. The answer is simple: nobody has yet found a theory that would par-
allel the results in this chapter, even in dimension two. One notable exception
is [11], in which irrational extensions of Brion’s theorem are given; we will
study the rational case of Brion’s theorem in Chapter 9. On the other hand,
Ehrhart theory has been extended to functions other than strict lattice-point
counting; one instance is described in Chapter 11.

(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (1, 1, n), where n is a positive integer. Show that the
volume of Tn is unbounded as n →∞, yet for all n, Tn has no interior and
four boundary lattice points. This example proves that Pick’s theorem does
not hold for a three-dimensional integral polytope P, in the sense that there
is no linear relationship among vol P, LP(1), and LP◦(1).
3.19. ♣Prove Lemma 3.24: If

then f is a quasipolynomial of degree d with period dividing p if and only if g
and h are polynomials such that deg(g) < deg(h), all roots of h are pth roots
of unity of multiplicity at most d + 1, and there is a root of multiplicity equal
to d + 1 (all of this assuming that g/h has been reduced to lowest terms).
3.20. ♣Provide the details for the proof of Theorem 3.23: If P is a rational
convex d-polytope, then LP(t) is a quasipolynomial in t of degree d. Its period
divides the least common multiple of the coordinates of the vertices of P.

particular, LT is a polynomial.
3.22. Prove that for any d ≥2 and any p ≥1, there exists a d-polytope P
whose Ehrhart quasipolynomial is a polynomial (i.e., it has period 1), yet P
has a vertex with denominator p.
3.23. Prove that the period of the Ehrhart quasipolynomial of a 1-dimensional

4 Reciprocity
This chapter is devoted to proving that a similar identity holds for rational
polytopes in any dimension:
Theorem 4.1 (Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity). Suppose P is a convex
rational polytope. Then the evaluation of the quasipolynomial LP at negative
integers yields
LP(−t) = (−1)dim PLP◦(t) .
This theorem belongs to a class of famous reciprocity theorems. A common
theme in combinatorics is to begin with an interesting object P, and
1. deﬁne a counting function f(t) attached to P that makes physical sense
for positive integer values of t;
2. recognize the function f as a polynomial in t;
3. substitute negative integral values of t into the counting function f, and
recognize f(−t) as a counting function of a new mathematical object Q.
For us, P is the closure of a polytope and Q is its interior.
4.1 Generating Functions for Somewhat Irrational Cones
Our approach to proving Theorem 4.1 parallels the steps of Chapter 3: we
deduce Theorem 4.1 from an identity for rational cones. We start with a
reciprocity theorem for simplicial cones.
Theorem 4.2. Fix linearly independent vectors w1, w2, . . . , wd ∈Zd, and let
K = {λ1w1 + λ2w2 + · · · + λdwd : λ1, . . . , λd ≥0}, the simplicial cone gener-
ated by the wj’s. Then for those v ∈Rd for which the boundary of the shifted
simplicial cone v + K contains no integer point,
σv+K
 1
z1
, 1
z2
, . . . , 1
zd

= (−1)d σ−v+K (z1, z2, . . . , zd) .
Remark. This theorem is meaningless on the level of formal power series;
however, the identity holds at the level of rational functions. We will establish
that σv+K is a rational function in the process of proving the theorem.
Proof. As in the proofs of Theorem 3.5 and Corollary 3.6, we have the formula
σv+K(z) =
σv+Π(z)
(1 −zw1) (1 −zw2) · · · (1 −zwd) ,
where Π is the open parallelepiped
Π = {λ1w1 + λ2w2 + · · · + λdwd : 0 < λ1, λ2, . . . , λd < 1} .
(4.3)
This also proves that σv+K is a rational function. Note that by assumption,
v + Π contains no integer points on its boundary. Naturally,

4.1 Generating Functions for Somewhat Irrational Cones
85
σ−v+K(z) =
σ−v+Π(z)
(1 −zw1) (1 −zw2) · · · (1 −zwd) ,
so we need to relate the parallelepipeds v + Π and −v + Π. This relation is
illustrated in Figure 4.2 for the case d = 2; the identity for general d is (see
Exercise 4.2)
v + Π = −(−v + Π) + w1 + w2 + · · · + wd .
(4.4)
Now we translate the geometry of (4.4) into generating functions:
v

−v + Π

4.2 Stanley’s Reciprocity Theorem for Rational Cones
For the general reciprocity theorem for cones, we patch the simplicial cones of a
triangulation together, in a manner very similar to our proof of Theorem 3.12.
Theorem 4.3 (Stanley reciprocity). Suppose K is a rational d-cone with
the origin as apex. Then
σK
 1


= (−1)d σK◦(z1, z2, . . . , zd) .
Proof. Triangulate K into the simplicial cones K1, K2, . . . , Km. Now Exer-
cise 3.14 ensures that there exists a vector v ∈Rd such that the shifted cone
v + K contains exactly the interior lattice points of K,
K◦∩Zd = (v + K) ∩Zd,
(4.5)
and there are no boundary lattice points on any of the triangulation cones:
∂(v + Kj) ∩Zd = ∅
for all j = 1, . . . , m,
(4.6)
as well as
∂(−v + Kj) ∩Zd = ∅
for all j = 1, . . . , m.
(4.7)
We invite the reader (Exercise 4.3) to realize that (4.5)–(4.7) imply
K ∩Zd = (−v + K) ∩Zd.
(4.8)

4.3 Ehrhart–Macdonald Reciprocity for Rational
Polytopes
In preparation for the proof of Theorem 4.1, we deﬁne the Ehrhart series
for the interior of the rational polytope P as
EhrP◦(z) :=
X
t≥1
LP◦(t) zt.
Our convention of beginning the series with t = 1 stems from the fact that
this generating function is a special evaluation of the integer-point transform
of the open cone (cone(P))◦: Much in sync with Lemma 3.10, we have
EhrP◦(z) = σ(cone(P))◦(1, 1, . . . , 1, z) .
(4.9)
We are now ready to prove the Ehrhart-series analogue of Theorem 4.1.
Theorem 4.4. Suppose P is a convex rational polytope. Then the evaluation
of the rational function EhrP at 1/z yields
EhrP
1
z

= (−1)dim P+1 EhrP◦(z) .
Proof. Suppose P is a d-polytope. We recall Lemma 3.10, which states that
the generating function of the Ehrhart polynomial of P is an evaluation of
the generating function of cone(P):
EhrP(z) =
X
t≥0
LP(t) zt = σcone(P) (1, 1, . . . , 1, z) .
Equation (4.9) above gives the analogous evaluation of σ(cone(P))◦that yields
EhrP◦. Now we apply Theorem 4.3 to the (d + 1)-cone K = cone(P):
σ(cone(P))◦(1, 1, . . . , 1, z) = (−1)d+1 σcone(P)

1, 1, . . . , 1, 1
z

.
⊓⊔
Theorem 4.1 now follows like a breeze.
Proof of Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity (Theorem 4.1). We ﬁrst apply Exer-
cise 4.5 to the Ehrhart series of P: namely, as rational functions,
EhrP
1
z

=
X
t≤0
LP(−t) zt = −
X
t≥1
LP(−t) zt.
Now we combine this identity with Theorem 4.4 to obtain
X
t≥1
LP◦(t) zt = (−1)d+1 EhrP
1
z

= (−1)d X
t≥1
LP(−t) zt.
Comparing the coeﬃcients of the two power series yields the reciprocity the-
orem.
⊓⊔

88
4 Reciprocity
With Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity, we can now restate Theorem 3.18
in terms of Ehrhart polynomials:
Theorem 4.5. Suppose P is an integral d-polytope with Ehrhart series
EhrP(z) = hd zd + hd−1 zd−1 + · · · + h1 z + 1
(1 −z)d+1
.
Then hd = hd−1 = · · · = hk+1 = 0 and hk ̸= 0 if and only if (d −k + 1)P is
the smallest integer dilate of P that contains an interior lattice point.
Proof. Theorem 3.18 says that hk is the highest nonzero coeﬃcient if and only
if LP(−1) = LP(−2) = · · · = LP (−(d −k)) = 0 and LP (−(d −k + 1)) ̸= 0.
Now use Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity (Theorem 4.1).
⊓⊔
The largest k for which hk ̸= 0 is called the degree of P. The above
theorem says that the degree of P is k precisely if (d −k + 1)P is the smallest
integer dilate of P that contains an interior lattice point.
4.4 The Ehrhart Series of Reﬂexive Polytopes
As an application of Theorem 4.4, we now study a special class of integral
polytopes whose Ehrhart series have an additional symmetry structure. We
call a polytope P that contains the origin in its interior reﬂexive if it is
integral and has the half-space description
P =

x ∈Rd : A x ≤1
	
,
where A is an integral matrix. (Here 1 denotes a vector all of whose co-
ordinates are 1.) The following theorem gives a characterization of reﬂexive
polytopes through their Ehrhart series.
Theorem 4.6 (Hibi’s palindromic theorem). Suppose P is an integral
d-polytope that contains the origin in its interior and that has the Ehrhart
series
EhrP(z) = hd zd + hd−1 zd−1 + · · · + h1 z + h0
(1 −z)d+1
.
Then P is reﬂexive if and only if hk = hd−k for all 0 ≤k ≤d
2.
The two main ingredients for the proof of this result are Theorem 4.4 and
the following:
Lemma 4.7. Suppose a1, a2, . . . , ad, b ∈Z satisfy gcd (a1, a2, . . . , ad, b) = 1
and b > 1. Then there exist positive integers c and t such that tb < c < (t+1)b
and

(m1, m2, . . . , md) ∈Zd : a1m1 + a2m2 + · · · + admd = c
	
̸= ∅.

4.4 The Ehrhart Series of Reﬂexive Polytopes
89
Proof. Let g = gcd (a1, a2, . . . , ad); by our assumption, gcd(g, b) = 1, so one
can ﬁnd integers k and t such that
kg −tb = 1 .
(4.10)
Furthermore, we can choose k and t in such a way that t > 0. Let c = kg;
equation (4.10) and the condition b > 1 imply that tb < c < (t + 1)b. Finally,
since g = gcd (a1, a2, . . . , ad) there exist m1, m2, . . . , md ∈Z such that
a1m1 + a2m2 + · · · + admd = kg = c .
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 4.6. We recall that P is reﬂexive if and only if
P =

x ∈Rd : A x ≤1
	
for some integral matrix A.
(4.11)
We claim that P has such a half-space description if and only if
P◦∩Zd = {0}
and for all t ∈Z>0, (t + 1)P◦∩Zd = tP ∩Zd.
(4.12)
This condition means that the only lattice points that we gain when pass-
ing from tP to (t + 1)P are those on the boundary of (t + 1)P. The fact
that (4.11) implies (4.12) is the content of Exercise 4.11. Conversely, if P
satisﬁes (4.12) then there are no lattice points between tH and (t + 1)H for
any facet hyperplane H of P (Exercise 4.12). That is, if a facet hyperplane
is given by H =

x ∈Rd : a1x1 + a2x2 + · · · + adxd = b
	
, where we may as-
sume gcd (a1, a2, . . . , ad, b) = 1, then

x ∈Zd : tb < a1x1 + a2x2 + · · · + adxd < (t + 1)b
	
= ∅.
But then Lemma 4.7 implies that b = 1, and so P has a half-space description
of the form (4.11).
Thus we have established that P is reﬂexive if and only if it satisﬁes (4.12).
Now by Theorem 4.4,
EhrP◦(z) = (−1)d+1 EhrP
1
z

= h0 zd+1 + h1 zd + · · · + hd−1 z2 + hd z
(1 −z)d+1
.
By condition (4.12), P is reﬂexive if and only if this rational function is equal
to
X
t≥1
LP(t −1) zt = z
X
t≥0
LP(t) zt = z EhrP(z)
= hd zd+1 + hd−1 zd + · · · + h1 z2 + h0 z
(1 −z)d+1
,
that is, if and only if hk = hd−k for all 0 ≤k ≤d
2.

4.5 More “Reﬂections” on the Coin-Exchange Problem
and the Gallery of Chapter 2
We have already encountered special cases of Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity
several times. Note that Theorem 4.1 allows us to conclude that counting
the number of interior lattice points in a rational polytope is tantamount to
counting lattice points in its closure. Exercises 1.31, 2.1, and 2.7, as well as
part (b) of each theorem in the gallery of Chapter 2, conﬁrm that
LP(−t) = (−1)dim PLP◦(t) .
Notes
1. Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity (Theorem 4.1) had been conjectured (and
proved in several special cases) by Eug`ene Ehrhart for about a decade before
I. G. Macdonald found a general proof in 1971 [123]. One can actually relax the
condition of Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity: it holds for polytopal complexes
that are homeomorphic to a d-manifold. The proof we give here (including
the proof of Theorem 4.3) appeared in [30].
2. Theorem 4.3 is due to Richard Stanley [169], who proved more general
versions of this theorem. The reader might recall that the rational function
representing the Ehrhart series of a rational cone can be thought of as its
meromorphic continuation. Stanley reciprocity (Theorem 4.3) gives a func-
tional identity for such meromorphic continuations.
3. The term reﬂexive polytope was coined by Victor Batyrev, who found ex-
citing applications of these polytopes to mirror symmetry in physical string
theory [16]. Batyrev proved that the toric variety XP deﬁned by a reﬂexive
polytope P is Fano, and that every generic hypersurface of XP is Calabi–Yau.
That the Ehrhart series of a reﬂexive polytope exhibits an unexpected sym-
metry (Theorem 4.6) was discovered by Takayuki Hibi [97]. The number of
reﬂexive polytopes in dimension d is known for d ≤4 [117, 118]; for example,
there are precisely 16 reﬂexive polytopes in dimension 2, up to symmetries
(see also [165, Sequence A090045]). A striking result is that the sum of the
numbers of lattice points on the boundaries of a reﬂexive polygon and its dual
is always 12 [147]. A similar result holds in dimension 3 (with 12 replaced by
24) [18], but no elementary proof of the latter fact is known [22, Section 4].
4. There is an equivalent deﬁnition for reﬂexive polytopes: P is reﬂexive
if and only if both P and its dual P∗are integral polytopes. The dual
polytope of P (often also called the polar polytope) is deﬁned as P∗:=

x ∈Rd : x · y ≤1 for all y ∈P
	
. The concept of (polar) duality is not con-
ﬁned to polytopes but can be deﬁned for any nonempty subset of Rd. Duality

Exercises

is a crucial chapter in the theory of polytopes, and one of its applications is
the equivalence of the vertex and hyperplane description of a polytope. For
more about (polar) duality, the reader might consult [12, Chapter IV].
5. The cross-polytopes 3 from Section 2.5 form a special class of reﬂexive
polytopes. We mentioned in the Notes of Chapter 2 that the roots of the
Ehrhart polynomials L3 all have real part −1
2 [51, 109]. Christian Bey, Martin
Henk, and J¨org Wills proved in [37] that if all roots of LP, for some integral
polytope P, have real part −1
2, then P is the unimodular image of a reﬂexive
polytope.

Face Numbers and the Dehn–Sommerville
Relations in Ehrhartian Terms
“Data! Data! Data!” he cried, impatiently. “I can’t make bricks without clay.”
Sherlock Holmes (“The Adventure of the Copper Beeches,” by Arthur Conan Doyle,
1859–1930)
Our goal in this chapter is twofold, or rather, there is one goal in two diﬀerent
guises. The ﬁrst one is to prove a set of fascinating identities, which give
linear relations among the face numbers fk. They are called Dehn–Sommerville
relations, in honor of their discoverers Max Wilhelm Dehn (1878–1952)1 and
Duncan MacLaren Young Sommerville (1879–1934).2 Our second goal is to
unify the Dehn–Sommerville relations (Theorem 5.1 below) with Ehrhart–
Macdonald reciprocity (Theorem 4.1).
5.1 Face It!
We denote the number of k-dimensional faces of P by the symbol fk. As k
varies from 0 to d, the face numbers fk encode intrinsic information about
the polytope P.
The d-polytope P is simple if each vertex of P lies on
precisely d edges of P.

and 0 ≤k ≤d, then

5 Face Numbers and the Dehn–Sommerville Relations in Ehrhartian Terms
This theorem takes on a particularly nice form for k = d, namely the
famous Euler relation, which holds for any polytope (not just simple ones).
Theorem 5.2 (Euler relation). If P is a convex d-polytope, then
d
X
j=0
(−1)jfj = 1 .
This identity is less trivial than it might look. We give a quick proof
for rational polytopes, for which we can use Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity
(Theorem 4.1).
Proof of Theorem 5.2, assuming P is rational. Let us count the integer points
in tP according to the (relatively) open faces that contain them:3
LP(t) =
X
F⊆P
LF◦(t) =
X
F⊆P
(−1)dim FLF(−t) .
Here, and in the remainder of this chapter, the sums are over all nonempty
faces. (Alternatively, we could agree that L∅(t) = 0.) The constant term of
LF(t) is 1, for any face F (by Exercise 3.27). Hence the constant terms of the
identity above give
1 =
X
F⊆P
(−1)dim F =
d
X
j=0
(−1)jfj ,
which proves our claim.
⊓⊔
There is a natural structure on the faces of a polytope P induced by the
containment relation F ⊆G. This relation gives a partial ordering on the set
of all faces of P, called the face lattice of P.4 A useful way to illustrate
this partially ordered set is through a graph whose nodes correspond to the
faces of P, such that two nodes are adjacent if one of their corresponding
faces contains the other. In Figure 5.1, we give the face lattice for a triangle.
Exercise 2.6 implies that the face lattice of any simplex is a Boolean lattice,
which is the partially ordered set formed by all subsets of a ﬁnite set, where
the partial ordering is again subset containment.
We already mentioned that we will unify the Dehn–Sommerville relations
(Theorem 5.1) with Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity (Theorem 4.1). It is for
this reason that we will prove Theorem 5.1 only for rational polytopes. To
combine the notions of face numbers and lattice-point enumeration, we deﬁne
3 Note that the relative interior of a vertex is the vertex itself.
4 The usage of the word lattice here is disjoint from our previous deﬁnition of the
word.

the sum being taken over all k-faces of P. By Ehrhart’s theorem (Theo-
rem 3.23), Fk is a quasipolynomial. Since LF(0) = 1 for all F,
Fk(0) = fk ,
the number of k-faces of P. We also remark that the leading coeﬃcient of Fk
measures the relative volume of the k-skeleton of P, that is, the union of all
k-faces; see Section 5.4 for a precise deﬁnition of relative volume.
Our common extension of Theorems 5.1 and 4.1 is the subject of the next
section.

The classical Dehn–Sommerville equations (Theorem 5.1)—again, only for
rational polytopes—are obtained from the constant terms of the counting
functions on both sides of the identity. On the other hand, for k = d, Theo-
rem 5.3 gives (with t replaced by −t)

(−1)jFj(t) = (−1)d

The sum on the right-hand side is an inclusion–exclusion formula for the
number of lattice points in the interior of tP (count all the points in P,
subtract the ones on the facets, add back what you’ve overcounted, etc.), so
in a sense we recover Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity.

98

Proof. Suppose F is a k-face of P. Then, again by counting the integer points
in F according to relatively open faces of F,
LF(t) =

5.3 Applications to the Coeﬃcients of an Ehrhart
Polynomial
We will now apply Theorem 5.3 to the computation of the Ehrhart polynomial
of an integral d-polytope P. The only face-lattice-point enumerator involving
the face P is Fd(t), for which Theorem 5.3 specializes to
LP(t) = Fd(t) =
d
X
j=0
(−1)jFj(−t) .

5.3 Applications to the Coeﬃcients of an Ehrhart Polynomial
99
In fact, we do not have to assume that P is simple, since this identity simply
counts integer points by faces. (Recall that (−1)jFj(−t) counts the integer
points in the t-dilates of the interior of the j-faces.)5 The last term on the
right-hand side is
(−1)dFd(−t) = (−1)dLP(−t) = LP◦(t)
by Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity. Shifting this term to the left gives
LP(t) −LP◦(t) =
d−1
X
j=0
(−1)jFj(−t) .
(5.2)
The diﬀerence on the left-hand side of this identity has a natural interpre-
tation: it counts the integer points on the boundary of tP. (And in fact, the
right-hand side is once more an inclusion–exclusion formula for this num-
ber.) Let us write LP(t) = cd td + cd−1 td−1 + · · · + c0. Then LP◦(t) =
cd td −cd−1 td−1 + · · · + (−1)dc0, so that
LP(t) −LP◦(t) = 2cd−1 td−1 + 2cd−3 td−3 + · · · ,
where this sum ends with 2c0 if d is odd and 2c1t if d is even (this should
look familiar; see Exercise 4.9). Combining this expression with (5.2) yields
the following useful result.
Theorem 5.4. Suppose LP(t) = cd td + cd−1 td−1 + · · · + c0 is the Ehrhart
polynomial of P. Then
cd−1 td−1 + cd−3 td−3 + · · · = 1

d−1

j=0
(−1)jFj(−t) .

We can make the statement of this theorem more precise (but also more
messy) by writing
Fj(t) =
X
F⊆P
dim F=j
LF(t) = cj,j tj + cj,j−1tj−1 + · · · + cj,0 .
Then collecting the coeﬃcients of tk in Theorem 5.4 yields the following rela-
tions.
Corollary 5.5. If k and d are of diﬀerent parity, then
ck = 1

⊓⊔
5 So one might argue that we did not need the Dehn–Sommerville machinery for
the computations in the current section. This argument is correct, although The-
orem 5.3 is a strong motivation.

100
5 Face Numbers and the Dehn–Sommerville Relations in Ehrhartian Terms
If k and d have the same parity, then the left-hand side has to be replaced
by 0.
The ﬁrst coeﬃcient ck in the Ehrhart polynomial of a d-polytope P satis-
fying the parity condition is cd−1. In this case Corollary 5.5 tells us that cd−1
equals 1
2 times the sum of the leading terms of the Ehrhart polynomials of
the facets of P.
The next interesting coeﬃcient is cd−3. For example, if dim P = 4, we can
use Corollary 5.5 to compute c1 entirely from (the linear coeﬃcients of) the
Ehrhart polynomials of the faces of dimension ≤3.
5.4 Relative Volume
It’s time to return to continuous volume. Recall Lemma 3.19: if S ⊂Rd is
d-dimensional, then vol S = limt→∞1
td · #
 tS ∩Zd
. Back in Chapter 3, we
stressed the importance of S being d-dimensional, because otherwise (i.e., S
is lower-dimensional although living in d-space), by our deﬁnition vol S = 0.
However, the case that S ⊂Rd is not of dimension d is often very in-
teresting; an example is the polytope P that we encountered in connec-
tion with the coin-exchange problem in Chapter 1. We still would like to
compute the volume of such objects, in the relative sense. This makes for
a slight complication. Let’s say S ⊂Rd is of dimension m < d, and let
span S = {x + λ(y −x) : x, y ∈S, λ ∈R}, the aﬃne span of S. If we follow
the same procedure as above (counting boxes or grid points), we compute
the volume relative to the sublattice (span S) ∩Zd; we call this the relative
volume of S.
For example, the line segment L from (0, 0) to (4, 2) in R2 has the relative
volume 2, because in span L =

(x, y) ∈R2 : y = x/2
	
, L is covered by two
segments of “unit length” in this aﬃne subspace, as pictured in Figure 5.2. A
three-dimensional instance that should be reminiscent of Chapter 1 is illus-
trated in Figure 5.3.

region is a fundamental domain for the sublattice that lies on the aﬃne span of the
triangle.
If S ⊆Rd has full dimension d, the relative volume coincides with the
“full-dimensional” volume. Henceforth, when we write vol S we refer to the
relative volume of S. With this convention we can rewrite Lemma 3.19 to
accommodate a set S ⊂Rd that is m-dimensional: its relative volume can be
computed as
vol S = lim
t→∞
1
tm · #
 tS ∩Zd
.
In the case that #
 tS ∩Zd
has the special form of a polynomial—for
example, if S is an integral polytope—we can further simplify this theorem.
Suppose P ⊂Rd is an integral m-polytope with Ehrhart polynomial
LP(t) = cm tm + cm−1 tm−1 + · · · + c1 t + 1 .
Then, according to the above discussion, and much in sync with Lemma 3.19,

102

vol P = lim
t→∞
1
tm LP(t) = lim
t→∞
cm tm + cm−1 tm−1 + · · · + c1 t + 1

= cm .
The relative volume of P is the leading term of the corresponding counting
function LP.
For example, in the previous section we found that Corollary 5.5 implies
that the second leading coeﬃcient cd−1 of the Ehrhart polynomial of the
d-polytope P equals
1
2 times the sum of the leading terms of the Ehrhart
polynomials of the facets of P. The leading term for one facet is simply the
relative volume of that facet:

polynomial of the integral polytope P. Then

Notes
1. The Dehn–Sommerville relations (Theorem 5.1) ﬁrst surfaced in the work
of Max Dehn, who proved them in 1905 for dimension ﬁve [71]. (The Dehn–
Sommerville relations are not that complicated for d ≤4; see Exercise 5.3.)
Some two decades later, D. M. Y. Sommerville proved the general case [167].
Theorem 5.1 was neither well known nor much used in the ﬁrst half of the
twentieth century, but only after its rediscovery by Victor Klee [111] and its
appearance in Branko Gr¨unbaum’s famous and widely read book [90].
2. The Euler relation (Theorem 5.2) is easy to prove directly for d = 3 (this
case is attributed to Euler), but for higher dimension, one has to be somewhat
careful, as we already remarked in the text. The classical proof for general d
was found in 1852 by Ludwig Schl¨aﬂi [158], although it (like numerous later
proofs) assumes that the boundary of a convex polytope can be built up
inductively in a “good” way. This nontrivial fact—which is called shelling of
a polytope—was proved by Heinz Bruggesser and Peter Mani in 1971 [50].
Shellability is nicely discussed in [193, Lecture 8]. There are short proofs of
the Euler relation that do not use the shelling of a polytope (see, for example,
[120, 139, 184]).
3. The reader might suspect that proving Theorems 5.1 and 5.2 for rational
polytopes suﬃces for the general case, since it seems that we can transform
a polytope with irrational vertices slightly to one with only rational vertices
without changing the face structure of the polytope. This is true in our every-
day world but fails in dimension ≥4 (see [156] for dimension 4 and [193,
pp. 172/173] for general dimension).

Magic Squares
The peculiar interest of magic squares and all lusus numerorum in general lies in
the fact that they possess the charm of mystery.

Fig. 6.1. Magic square at the Temple de la Sagrada Fam´ılia (Barcelona, Spain).
Equipped with a solid base of theoretical results, we are now ready to return
to computations. We use Ehrhart theory to assist us in enumerating magic
squares.
Loosely speaking, a magic square is an n × n array of integers (usually
required to be positive, often restricted to the numbers 1, 2, . . . , n2, usually
required to have distinct entries) whose sum along any row, column, and main
diagonal is the same number, called the magic sum. Magic squares have turned

106
6 Magic Squares
up time and again, some in mathematical contexts, others in philosophical or
religious contexts. According to legend, the ﬁrst magic square (the ancient Luo
Shu square) was discovered in China sometime before the ﬁrst century B.C.E.
on the back of a turtle emerging from a river. It was the square pictured in
Figure 6.2.

Fig. 6.2. The Luo Shu square.
Our task in this chapter is to develop a theory for counting certain classes
of magic squares, which we now introduce.
6.1 It’s a Kind of Magic
One should notice that the Luo Shu square has the distinct entries 1, 2, . . . , 9,
so these entries are positive, distinct integers drawn from a particular set. Such
requirements are too restrictive for our purposes. We deﬁne a semimagic
square to be a square matrix whose entries are nonnegative integers and
whose rows and columns (called lines in this setting) sum to the same number.
A magic square is a semimagic square whose main diagonals also add up to
the line sum. Figure 6.3 shows two examples.

Fig. 6.3. A semimagic and a magic square.
We caution the reader about clashing deﬁnitions in the literature. For
example, some people reserve the term “magic square” for what we will call
a traditional magic square, a magic square of order n whose entries are
the distinct integers 1, 2, . . . , n2. (The Luo Shu square is an example of a
traditional magic square.) Others are slightly less restrictive and use the term

6.1 It’s a Kind of Magic
107
“magic square” for a magic square with distinct entries. We stress that we do
not make this requirement in this chapter.
Our goal is to count semimagic and magic squares. In the traditional case,
this is in some sense not very interesting:1 for each order there is a ﬁxed
number of traditional magic squares. For example, there are 7040 traditional
4 × 4 magic squares.
The situation becomes more interesting if we drop the condition of tra-
ditionality and study the number of magic squares as a function of the line
sum. We denote the total numbers of semimagic and magic squares of order
n and line sum t by Hn(t) and Mn(t), respectively.

Example 6.1. We illustrate these notions for the case n = 2, which is not
very complicated. Here a semimagic square is determined once we know one
entry, say the upper left one, denoted by ♥in Figure 6.4. Because of the upper
row sum, the upper right entry has to be t −♥, as does the lower left entry
(because of the left column sum). But then the lower right entry has to be
t −(t −♥) = ♥(for two reasons: the lower row sum and the right column
sum). The entry ♥can be any integer between 0 and t. Since there are t + 1
such integers,
H2(t) = t + 1 .
(6.1)
In the magic case, we also have to think of the diagonals. Looking back at our
semimagic square in Figure 6.4, the ﬁrst diagonal gives 2 · ♥= t, or ♥= t/2.
In this case, t −♥= t/2, and so a 2 × 2 magic square has to have identical
entries in each position. Because we require the entries to be integers, this is
possible only if t is even, in which case we obtain precisely one solution, the
square on the right in Figure 6.4. That is,
M2(t) =
 1 if t is even,
0 if t is odd.
These easy results already hint at something: the counting function Hn is of
a diﬀerent character than the function Mn.
⊓⊔
1 It is, nevertheless, an incredibly hard problem to count all traditional magic
squares of a given size n. At present, these numbers are known only for n ≤5
[165, Sequence A006052].

6.2 Semimagic Squares: Integer Points
in the Birkhoﬀ–von Neumann Polytope
Just as the Frobenius problem was intrinsically connected to questions about
integer points on line segments, triangles, and higher-dimensional simplices,
magic squares and their relatives have a life in the world of geometry. The
most famous example is connected to semimagic squares.
A semimagic n×n square has n2 nonnegative entries that sum to the same
number along any row or column. Consider therefore the polytope
Bn :=

consisting of nonnegative real matrices, in which all rows and columns sum
to one. Bn is called the nth Birkhoﬀ–von Neumann polytope, in honor
of Garrett Birkhoﬀ(1911–1996)2 and John von Neumann (1903–1957).3 Be-
cause the matrices contained in the Birkhoﬀ–von Neumann polytope appear
frequently in probability and statistics (the line sum 1 representing probabil-
ity 1), Bn is often described as the set of all n × n doubly stochastic matrices.
Geometrically, Bn is a subset of Rn2 and as such diﬃcult to picture once
n exceeds 1.4 However, we can get a glimpse of B2 ⊂R4 when we think about
what form points in B2 can possibly attain. Very much in sync with Figure 6.4,
such a point is determined by its upper left entry ♥, pictured in Figure 6.5.
This entry ♥is a real number between 0 and 1, which suggests that B2 should

6.2 Semimagic Squares: Integer Points in Birkhoﬀ–von Neumann Polytope
109
These results generalize: Bn is an (n −1)2-polytope (see Exercise 6.3), whose
vertices (Exercise 6.5) are the permutation matrices, namely, those n × n
matrices that have precisely one 1 in each row and column (every other entry
being zero). For dimensional reasons, we can talk about the continuous volume
of Bn only in the relative sense, following the deﬁnition of Section 5.4.
The connection of the semimagic counting function Hn(t) to the Birkhoﬀ–
von Neumann polytope Bn becomes clear in the light of the lattice-point enu-
merator for Bn: the counting function Hn(t) enumerates precisely the integer
points in tBn, that is,
Hn(t) = #

tBn ∩Zn2
= LBn(t) .
We can say more after noticing that permutation vertices are integer points
in Bn, and so Ehrhart’s theorem (Theorem 3.8) applies:
Theorem 6.2. Hn(t) is a polynomial in t of degree (n −1)2.
⊓⊔
The fact that Hn is a polynomial—apart from being mathematically
appealing—has the same nice computational consequence that we exploited
in Section 3.6: we can calculate this counting function by interpolation. For
example, to compute H2, a linear polynomial, we need to know only two val-
ues. In fact, since we know that the constant term of H2 is 1 (by Corollary
3.15), we need only one value. It is not hard to convince even a lay person
that H2(1) = 2 (which two semimagic squares are those?), from which we
interpolate
H2(t) = t + 1 .
To interpolate the polynomial H3, we need to know 4 values aside from
H3(0) = 1. In fact, we do not even have to know that many values, because
Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity (Theorem 4.1) assists us in computations. To
see this, let H◦
n(t) denote the number of n × n square matrices with positive
integer entries summing up to t along each row and column. A moment’s
thought (Exercise 6.6) reveals that
H◦
n(t) = Hn(t −n) .
(6.3)
But there is a second relationship between Hn and H◦
n, namely, H◦
n(t) counts,
by deﬁnition, the integer points in the relative interior of the Birkhoﬀ–von
Neumann polytope Bn, that is, H◦
n(t) = LB◦n(t). Now Ehrhart–Macdonald
reciprocity (Theorem 4.1) gives
H◦
n(−t) = (−1)(n−1)2Hn(t) .
Combining this identity with (6.3) gives us a symmetry identity for the count-
ing function for semimagic squares:

110
6 Magic Squares
Theorem 6.3. The polynomial Hn satisﬁes
Hn(−n −t) = (−1)(n−1)2Hn(t)
and
Hn(−1) = Hn(−2) = · · · = Hn(−n + 1) = 0 .
⊓⊔
The roots of Hn at the ﬁrst n −1 negative integers follow from (Exer-
cise 6.7)
H◦
n(1) = H◦
n(2) = · · · = H◦
n(n −1) = 0 .
Theorem 6.3 gives the degree of Bn, and it implies that the numerator of the
Ehrhart series of the Birkhoﬀ–von Neumann polytope is palindromic:
Corollary 6.4. The Ehrhart series of the Birkhoﬀ–von Neumann polytope Bn
has the form
EhrBn(z) = h(n−1)(n−2) z(n−1)(n−2) + · · · + h0
(1 −z)(n−1)2+1
,
where h0, h1, . . . , h(n−1)(n−2) ∈Z≥0 satisfy hk = h(n−1)(n−2)−k for 0 ≤k ≤
(n−1)(n−2)
2
.
Proof. Denote the Ehrhart series of Bn by
EhrBn(z) = h(n−1)2 z(n−1)2 + · · · + h0
(1 −z)(n−1)2+1
.
The fact that h(n−1)2 = · · · = h(n−1)2−(n−2) = 0 follows from the second
part of Theorem 6.3 and Theorem 4.5. The palindromy of the numerator
coeﬃcients follows from the ﬁrst part of Theorem 6.3 and Exercise 4.6: it
implies
EhrBn
1
z

= (−1)(n−1)2+1zn EhrBn(z) ,
which yields hk = h(n−1)(n−2)−k upon simplifying both sides of the equation.
⊓⊔
Let’s return to the interpolation of H3: Theorem 6.3 gives, in addition to
H3(0) = 1, the values
H3(−3) = 1
and
H3(−1) = H3(−2) = 0 .
These four values together with H3(1) = 6 (see Exercise 6.1) suﬃce to inter-
polate the quartic polynomial H3, and one computes
H3(t) = 1
8 t4 + 3
4 t3 + 15
8 t2 + 9
4 t + 1 .
(6.4)

6.3 Magic Generating Functions and Constant-Term Identities
111
This interpolation example suggests the use of a computer; we let it calcu-
late enough values of Hn and then simply interpolate. As far as computations
are concerned, however, we should not get too excited about the fact that
we computed H2 and H3 so eﬀortlessly. In general, the polynomial Hn has
degree (n −1)2, so we need to compute (n −1)2 + 1 values of Hn to be
able to interpolate. Of those, we know n (the constant term and the roots
given by Theorem 6.3), so n2 −3n + 1 values of Hn remain to be computed.
Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity reduces the number of values to be computed
to n2−3n
2
+ 1. That’s still a lot, as anyone can testify who has tried to get a
computer to enumerate all semimagic 7 × 7 squares with line sum 15. Never-
theless, it is a fun fact that we can compute Hn for small n by interpolation.
It is amusing to test one’s computer against the constant-term computation
we will outline below, and we invite the reader to try both. For small n, in-
terpolation is clearly superior to a constant-term computation in the spirit
of Chapter 1. The turning point seems to be right around n = 5: the com-
puter needs more and more time to compute the values Hn(t) as t increases.
Methods superior to interpolation are needed.
6.3 Magic Generating Functions and Constant-Term
Identities
Now we will construct a generating function for Hn, for which we will use
Theorem 2.13. The semimagic counting function Hn is the Ehrhart polynomial
of the nth Birkhoﬀ–von Neumann polytope Bn, which, in turn, is deﬁned as a
set of matrices by (6.2). First we rewrite the deﬁnition of Bn to ﬁt the general
description (2.23) of a polytope. If we consider the points in Bn as column
vectors in Rn2 (rather than as matrices in Rn×n) then
Bn =

From this description of Bn, we can easily build the generating function
for Hn. According to Theorem 2.13, for a general rational polytope P =

x ∈Rd

, we have
LP(t) = const

1
(1 −zc1) (1 −zc2) · · · (1 −zcd) ztb

,
where c1, c2, . . . , cd denote the columns of A. In our special case, the columns
of A are of a simple form: they contain exactly two 1’s and elsewhere 0’s. We
need one generating-function variable for each row of A. To keep things as
clear as possible, we use z1, z2, . . . , zn for the ﬁrst n rows of A (representing
the row constraints of Bn) and w1, w2, . . . , wn for the last n rows of A (rep-
resenting the column constraints of Bn). With this notation, Theorem 2.13
applied to Bn gives the following starting point for our computations:

⊓⊔
This identity is of both theoretical and practical use. One can use it to compute
H3 and even H4 by hand. For now, we work on reﬁning it further, exempliﬁed
by the case n = 2.
We ﬁrst note that in the formula for H2, the variables w1 and w2 are
separated, in the sense that we can write this formula as a product of two
factors, one involving only w1 and the other involving only w2:
H2(t) = const
 1

2
1
(1 −z1w1) (1 −z2w1) wt
1
1
(1 −z1w2) (1 −z2w2) wt
2

.
Now we put an ordering on the constant-term computation: let us ﬁrst com-
pute the constant term with respect to w2, then the one with respect to w1.
(We don’t order the computation with respect to z1 and z2 just yet.) Since z1,
z2, and w1 are considered constants when we do constant-term computations
with respect to w2, we can simplify:
H2(t) = constz1,z2
 1

× constw2

1
(1 −z1w2) (1 −z2w2) wt
2

.
Now we can see the eﬀect of the separate appearance of w1 and w2: the
constant-term identity factors. This is very similar to the factoring that can
appear in computations of integrals in several variables. Let us rewrite our
identity to emphasize the factoring:

.
But now the expressions in the last two sets of parentheses are identical,
except that in one case the constant-term variable is called w1 and in the
other case w2. Since these are just “dummy” variables, we can call them w,
and combine:
H2(t) = constz1,z2

(Note the square!) Naturally, all of this factoring works in the general case,
and we invite the reader to prove it (Exercise 6.8):


(z1 · · · zn)−t

constw

(1 −z1w) · · · (1 −znw)wt
n

(6.6)
We can go further, namely, we can compute the innermost constant term
constw
1
(1 −z1w) · · · (1 −znw)wt .
It should come as no surprise that we’ll use a partial fraction expansion to do
so. The w-poles of the rational function are at w = 1/z1, w = 1/z2, . . . , w =
1/zn, and so we expand

Now it’s time to put more order on the constant-term computation. Let’s say
we ﬁrst compute the constant term with respect to z1, and after that with
respect to z2. So we have to compute ﬁrst

 z−t

.
To obtain these constant terms, we need to expand the function
1
(z1−z2)2 . As
we know from calculus, this expansion depends on the order of the magnitudes
of z1 and z2. For example, if |z1| < |z2| then
1
z1 −z2

So let’s assume for the moment that |z1| < |z2|. This might sound funny, since
z1 and z2 are variables. However, as such they are simply tools that enable
us to compute some quantity that is independent of z1 and z2. In view of
these ideas, we may assume any order of the magnitudes of the variables. In
Exercise 6.11 we will check that indeed the order does not matter. Now,

(see Exercise 6.10) one checks that

This was a lot of work for this seemingly trivial polynomial. Recall, for
example, that we can get the same result by an easy interpolation. How-
ever, to compute a similar interpolation, e.g., for H4, we likely would need
to use a computer (to obtain the interpolation values). On the other hand,
the constant-term computation of H4 boils down to only ﬁve iterated con-
stant terms, which can actually be computed by hand (see Exercise 6.14).
The result is
H4(t) =

6.4 The Enumeration of Magic Squares
What happens when we bring the diagonal constraints, which are not present
in the semimagic case, into the magic picture? In the introduction of this
chapter we have already seen an example, namely the number of 2 × 2 magic
squares,
M2(t) =
1 if t is even,
0 if t is odd.
This is a very simple example of a quasipolynomial. In fact, like Hn, the
counting function Mn is deﬁned by integral linear equations and inequalities,
so it is the lattice-point enumerator of a rational polytope, and Theorem 3.23
gives at once the following result.
Theorem 6.7. The counting function Mn(t) is a quasipolynomial in t.
⊓⊔
We invite the reader to prove that the degree of Mn is n2 −2n −1 (Exer-
cise 6.16).
Let’s see what happens in the ﬁrst nontrivial case, 3 × 3 magic squares.
We follow our recipe and assign variables m1, m2, . . . , m9 to the entries of our
3 × 3 squares, as in Figure 6.6.

m7 + m8 + m9 = t ,
m1 + m4 + m7 = t ,

m3 + m6 + m9 = t ,
m1 + m5 + m9 = t ,
m3 + m5 + m7 = t ,
according to the row sums (the ﬁrst three equations), the column sums (the
next three equations), and the diagonal sums (the last two equations). By

now, we’re experienced in translating this system into a generating function:
we need one variable for each equation, so let’s take z1, z2, z3 for the ﬁrst
three, w1, w2, w3 for the next three, and y1, y2 for the last two equations. The
function M3(t) is the constant term of
1
(1 −z1w1y1) (1 −z1w2) (1 −z1w3y2) (1 −z2w1) (1 −z2w2y1y2) (1 −z2w3)
×
1
(1 −z3w1y2) (1 −z3w2) (1 −z3w3y1) (z1z2z3w1w2w3y1y2)t .
(6.12)
It does take some work, but it is instructive to compute this constant term
(just try it!). The result is
M3(t) =
(
2
9 t2 + 2
3 t + 1
if 3|t,
0
otherwise.
(6.13)
As predicted by Theorem 6.7, M3 is a quasipolynomial. It has degree 2 and
period 3. This may be more apparent if we rewrite it as
M3(t) =



if t ≡0 mod 3,

underwent much further development in the Islamic world late in the ﬁrst

millennium C.E. and in the next millennium (or sooner; the data are lacking)
in India [54]. From Islam they passed to Christian Europe in the later Middle
Ages, probably initially through the Jewish community [54, Part II, pp. 290
ﬀ.] and later possibly Byzantium [54, Part I, p. 198], and no later than the
early eighteenth century (the data are buried in barely tapped archives) to
sub-Saharan Africa [191, Chapter 12]. The contents of a magic square have
varied with time and writer; usually they have been the ﬁrst n2 consecutive
integers, but often any arithmetic sequence or arbitrary positive numbers.
In the past century, mathematicians have made some simpliﬁcations in the
interest of obtaining results about the number of squares with a ﬁxed magic
sum, in particular, allowing repeated entries as in this chapter.
2. The problem of counting magic squares (other than traditional magic
squares) seems to have occurred to anyone only in the twentieth century,
no doubt because there was no way to approach the question previously. The
ﬁrst nontrivial formulas addressing the counting problem, namely (6.4) and
(6.13) for H3 and M3, were established by Percy Macmahon (1854–1929)5
[124] in 1915. Recently there has grown up a literature on exact formulas (see
for example [80, 168] for semimagic squares; for magic squares see [1, 23]; for
magic squares with distinct entries see [31, 189]).
3. Another famous kind of square is latin squares (see, for example, [72]).
Here each row and column has n diﬀerent numbers, the same n numbers in
every row/column (usually taken to be the ﬁrst n positive integers). There
are counting problems associated with latin squares, which can be attacked
using Ehrhart theory [31] (see also [165, Sequence A002860]).
4. Recent work includes mathematical-historical research, such as the discov-
ery of unpublished magic squares of Benjamin Franklin [2, 141]. Aside from
mathematical research, magic squares and their siblings naturally continue
to be an excellent source of topics for popular mathematics books (see, for
example, [4] or [144]).
5. The Birkhoﬀ–von Neumann polytope Bn possesses fascinating combinato-
rial properties [38, 48, 49, 58, 192] and relates to many mathematical areas
[74, 112]. Its name honors Garrett Birkhoﬀand John von Neumann, who
proved that the extremal points of Bn are the permutation matrices [39, 186]
(see Exercise 6.5). A long-standing open problem is the determination of
the relative volume of Bn, which is known only for n ≤10 [165, Sequence
A037302]. In fact, the last two records (n = 9 and 10) for computing vol Bn
rely on the theory of counting functions that is introduced in this book, more
precisely, Theorem 6.6 [28].

6. An important generalization of the Birkhoﬀ–von Neumann polytope is the
transporation polytopes, which consist of contingency tables. They have appli-
cations to statistics and in particular to disclosure limitation procedures [68].
The Birkhoﬀ–von Neumann polytopes are special transportation polytopes
that consist of two-way contingency tables with given 1-marginals.
7. The polynomiality of Hn (Theorem 6.2) and its symmetry (Theorem 6.3)
were conjectured in 1966 by Harsh Anand, Vishwa Dumir, and Hansraj Gupta
[3] and proved seven years later independently by Eug`ene Ehrhart [80] and
Richard Stanley [168]. Stanley also conjectured that the numerator coeﬃcients
in Corollary 6.4 are unimodal, a fact that was proved only in 2005, by Christos
Athanasiadis [8]. The quasipolynomiality of Mn (Theorem 6.7) and its degree
are discussed in [23]. The period of Mn is in general not known. In [23] it
is conjectured that it is always nontrivial for n > 1. The work in [1] gives
some credence to this conjecture by proving that the polytope of magic n × n
squares is not integral for n ≥2.
8. We close with a story about Cornelius Agrippa’s De Occulta Philosophia,
written in 1510. In it he describes the spiritual powers of magic squares and
produces some squares of orders from three up to nine. His work, although
inﬂuential in the mathematical community, enjoyed only brief success, for
the Counter-Reformation and the witch hunts of the Inquisition began soon
thereafter: Agrippa himself was accused of being allied with the devil.

Finite Fourier Analysis
God created inﬁnity, and man, unable to understand inﬁnity, created ﬁnite sets.
Gian-Carlo Rota (1932–1999)
We now consider the vector space of all complex-valued periodic functions
on the integers with period b. It turns out that every such function a(n) on
the integers can be written as a polynomial in the bth root of unity ξn :=
e2πin/b. Such a representation for a(n) is called a ﬁnite Fourier series.
Here we develop the ﬁnite Fourier theory using rational functions and their
partial fraction decomposition. We then deﬁne the Fourier transform and the
convolution of ﬁnite Fourier series, and show how one can use these ideas to
prove identities on trigonometric functions, as well as ﬁnd connections to the
classical Dedekind sums.
The more we know about roots of unity and their various sums, the deeper
are the results that we can prove (see Exercise 7.19); in fact, certain statements
about sums of roots of unity even imply the Riemann hypothesis! However,
this chapter is elementary and draws connections to the sawtooth functions
and Dedekind sums, two basic sums over roots of unity. The general philos-
ophy here is that ﬁnite sums of rational functions of roots of unity are basic
ingredients in many mathematical structures.
7.1 A Motivating Example
To ease the reader into the general theory, let’s work out the ﬁnite Fourier
series for a simple example ﬁrst, an arithmetic function with a period of 3.
Example 7.1. Consider the following arithmetic function, of period 3:
n : 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .
a(n) : 1, 5, 2, 1, 5, 2, . . .

7 Finite Fourier Analysis
We ﬁrst embed this sequence into a generating function as follows:
F(z) := 1 + 5z + 2z2 + z3 + 5z4 + 2z5 + · · · =
X
n≥0
a(n) zn.
Since the sequence is periodic, we can simplify F(z) using a geometric series
argument:
F(z) =
X
n≥0
a(n) zn

We now use the same technique that was employed in Chapter 1, namely the
technique of expanding a rational function into its partial fraction decompo-
sition. Here all the poles are simple, and located at the three cube roots of
unity, so that
F(z) = ˆa(0)
1 −z +

(7.1)
where the constants ˆa(0), ˆa(1), ˆa(2) remain to be found, and where ρ := e2πi/3,
a third root of unity. Using the geometric series for each of these terms sepa-
rately, we arrive at
F(z) =
X
n≥0
 ˆa(0) + ˆa(1)ρn + ˆa(2)ρ2n
zn,
so that we’ve derived the ﬁnite Fourier series of our sequence a(n)! The only
remaining piece of information that we need is the computation of the con-
stants ˆa(j), for j = 0, 1, 2. It turns out that this is also quite easy to do. We
have, from (7.1) above, the identity
ˆa(0) (1 −ρz)

 1 −ρ2z

+ ˆa(2) (1 −z) (1 −ρz)

valid for all z ∈C. Upon letting z = 1, ρ2, and ρ, respectively, we obtain
3 ˆa(0) = 1 + 5 + 2 ,
3 ˆa(1) = 1 + 5ρ2 + 2ρ4,
3 ˆa(2) = 1 + 5ρ + 2ρ2,
where we’ve used the identity (1 −ρ)(1 −ρ2) = 3 (see Exercise 7.2). We can
simplify a bit to get ˆa(0) = 8
3, ˆa(1) = −4−3ρ
3
, and ˆa(2) = −1+3ρ

. Thus the

The object of the next section is to show that this simple process follows just
as easily for any periodic function on Z. The ensuing sections contain some
applications of the ﬁnite Fourier series of periodic functions.
7.2 Finite Fourier Series for Periodic Functions on Z
The general theory is just as easy conceptually as the example above, and we
now develop it. Consider any periodic sequence on Z, deﬁned by {a(n)}∞
n=0, of
period b. Throughout the chapter, we ﬁx the bth root of unity ξ := e2πi/b. As
before, we embed our periodic sequence {a(n)}∞
n=0 into a generating function,
F(z) :=

n≥0
a(n) zn,
and use the periodicity of the sequence to immediately get

1 −zb ,
where the last step simply deﬁnes the polynomial P(z) = Pb−1
k=0 a(k) zk. Now
we expand the rational generating function F(z) into partial fractions, as
before:
F(z) = P(z)
1 −zb =
b−1
X
m=0
ˆa(m)
1 −ξmz .
As in the example of the previous section, we expand each of the terms

We now ﬁnd a formula for the Fourier coeﬃcients ˆa(n), as in the example.

where we have used the factorization 1 −zb = Qb
k=1(1 −ξkz) of Exercise 7.1.
To solve for P(ξ−n), we note that
lim
z→ξ−n
1 −zb
1 −ξmz = 0
if m −n ̸≡0 mod b,
and
lim

ˆa(n) = 1

a(k) ξ−nk.
We have just proved the main result of ﬁnite Fourier series, using only ele-
mentary properties of rational functions:
Theorem 7.2 (Finite Fourier series expansion and Fourier inver-
sion). Let a(n) be any periodic function on Z, with period b. Then we have
the following ﬁnite Fourier series expansion:
a(n) =
b−1
X
k=0
ˆa(k) ξnk,
where the Fourier coeﬃcients are
ˆa(n) = 1

(7.2)
with ξ = e2πi/b.
⊓⊔
The coeﬃcients ˆa(m) are known as the Fourier coeﬃcients of the func-
tion a(n), and if ˆa(m) ̸= 0 we sometimes say that the function has fre-
quency m. The ﬁnite Fourier series of a periodic function provides us with
surprising power and insight into its structure. We are able to analyze the func-
tion using its frequencies (only ﬁnitely many), and this window into the fre-
quency domain becomes indispensable for computations and simpliﬁcations.

7.2 Finite Fourier Series for Periodic Functions on Z
127
We note that the Fourier coeﬃcients ˆa(n) and the original sequence ele-
ments a(n) are related by a linear transformation given by the matrix
L =

ξ(i−1)(j−1)
,
(7.3)
where 1 ≤i, j ≤b, as is evident from (7.2) in the proof above. We further note
that the second half of the proof, namely solving for the Fourier coeﬃcients
ˆa(n), is just tantamount to inverting this matrix L.
One of the main building blocks of our lattice-point enumeration formulas
in polytopes is the sawtooth function, deﬁned by
((x)) :=
(
{x} −1
2
if x /∈Z,
0
if x ∈Z.
(7.4)
(As a reminder, {x} = x −⌊x⌋is the fractional part of x.) The graph of this
function is displayed in Figure 7.1. We have seen a closely related function
before, in Chapter 1, in our study of the coin-exchange problem. Equation
(1.8) gave us the ﬁnite Fourier series for essentially this function from the
discrete-geometry perspective of the coin-exchange problem; however, we now
compute the ﬁnite Fourier series for this periodic function directly, pretending
that we do not know about its other life as a counting function.

7.3 The Finite Fourier Transform and Its Properties
Given a periodic function f on Z, we have seen that f possesses a ﬁnite
Fourier series, with the ﬁnite collection of Fourier coeﬃcients that we called
ˆf(0), ˆf(1), . . . , ˆf(b −1). We now regard f as a function on the ﬁnite set
G = {0, 1, 2, . . . , b −1}, and let VG be the vector space of all complex-valued
functions on G. Equivalently, VG is the vector space of all complex-valued,
periodic functions on Z with period b.
We deﬁne the Fourier transform of f, denoted by F(f), to be the peri-
odic function on Z deﬁned by the sequence of uniquely determined values
ˆf(0), ˆf(1), . . . , ˆf(b −1) .
Thus
F(f)(m) = ˆf(m) .
Theorem 7.2 above gave us these coeﬃcients as a linear combination of the
values f(k), with k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , b −1. Thus F(f) is a linear transformation
of the function f, thought of as a vector in VG. In other words, we’ve shown
that F(f) is a one-to-one and onto linear transformation of VG.
The vector space VG is a vector space of dimension b; indeed, an explicit
basis can easily be given for VG using the “delta functions” (see Exercise 7.7)
deﬁned by
δm(x) :=
(
1
if x = m + kb, for some integer k,
0
otherwise.
In other words, δm(x) is the periodic function on Z that picks out the arith-
metic progression {m + kb : k ∈Z}.
But there is another natural basis for VG. For any ﬁxed integer a the roots
of unity {ea(x) := e2πiax/b : x ∈Z} can be thought of as a single function

130
7 Finite Fourier Analysis
ea(x) ∈VG because of its periodicity on Z. As we saw in Theorem 7.2, the
functions {e1(x), . . . , eb(x)} give a basis for the vector space of functions VG.
A natural question now arises: how are the two bases related to each other?
An initial observation is
bδa(n) = 1
b e−2πian/b,
which simply follows from the computation
bδa(n) = 1
b
b−1
X
k=0
δa(k) ξ−kn = 1
b ξ−an = 1
b e−2πian/b.
So to get from the ﬁrst basis to the second basis, we need precisely the ﬁnite
Fourier transform!
It is extremely useful to deﬁne the following inner product on this vector
space:
⟨f, g⟩=
b−1
X
k=0
f(k) g(k) ,
(7.6)
for any two functions f, g ∈VG. Here the bar denotes complex conjugation.
The following elementary properties show that ⟨f, g⟩is an inner product (see
Exercise 7.8):
1. ⟨f, f⟩≥0, with equality if and only if f = 0, the zero function.
2. ⟨f, g⟩= ⟨g, f⟩.
Equipped with this inner product, VG can now be regarded as a metric
space. We can now measure distances between any two functions, and in
particular between any two basis elements ea(x) := e2πiax/b and ec(x) :=
e2πicx/b. Any positive deﬁnite inner product gives rise to the distance function
d(f, g) = ⟨f −g, f −g⟩.
Lemma 7.5 (Orthogonality relations).
1
b ⟨ea, ec⟩= δa(c) =
(

otherwise.
Proof. We compute the inner product
⟨ea, ec⟩=
b−1
X
m=0
ea(m) ec(m) =
b−1
X
m=0
e2πi(a−c)m/b.
If b | (a−c), then each term equals 1 in the latter sum, and hence the sum
equals b. This veriﬁes the ﬁrst case of the lemma.
If b ∤(a−c), then ea−c(m) = e2πim(a−c)/b is a nontrivial root of unity, and
we have the ﬁnite geometric series

Example 7.6. We recall the sawtooth function again, since it is one of the
building blocks of lattice point enumeration, and compute its Fourier trans-
form. Namely, we deﬁne

a periodic function on the integers with period b. What is its ﬁnite Fourier
transform? We have already seen the answer, in the course of the proof of
Lemma 7.3:
bB(n) = 1
2b

1 −ξn = i

for n ̸= 0, and bB(0) = 0. As always, ξ = e2πi/b.
⊓⊔
In the next section we delve more deeply into the behavior of this inner
product, where the Parseval identity is proved.
7.4 The Parseval Identity
A nontrivial property of the inner product deﬁned above is the following iden-
tity, linking the “norm of a function” to the “norm of its Fourier transform.” It
is known as the Parseval identity, and also goes by the name of the Plancherel
theorem.
Theorem 7.7 (Parseval identity). For all f ∈VG,
⟨f, f⟩= b ⟨ˆf, ˆf⟩.
Proof. Using the deﬁnition em(x) = ξmx and the relation
ˆf(x) = 1

b−1

m=0
f(m) em(x)
from Theorem 7.2, we have

(Lemma 7.5) in the fourth equality above.
⊓⊔
A basically identical proof yields the following stronger result, showing that
the “distance between any two functions” is essentially equal to the “distance
between their Fourier transforms.”
Theorem 7.8. For all f, g ∈VG, we have
⟨f, g⟩= b ⟨ˆf, ˆg⟩.
⊓⊔
Example 7.9. A nice application of the generalized Parseval identity above
now gives us Lemma 7.4 very quickly, the reformulation of the Dedekind sum
as a sum over roots of unity. Namely, we ﬁrst ﬁx an integer a relatively prime
to b and deﬁne f(k) =
   k
b

, and g(k) =
   ka
b

. Then, using Example 7.6, we
have ˆf(n) =

twist. Since
ka

2b

m=1
cot πm

we can multiply each index m by a−1, the multiplicative inverse of a modulo
b (recall that we require a and b to be relatively prime for the reformulation
of the Dedekind sum). Since a−1 is relatively prime to b, this multiplication
just permutes m = 1, 2, . . . , b −1 modulo b, but the sum stays invariant (see
Exercise 1.9):

7.5 The Convolution of Finite Fourier Series
Another basic tool in ﬁnite Fourier analysis is the convolution of two ﬁnite
Fourier series. Namely, let f(t) =
1
b
Pb−1
k=0 ak ξkt and g(t) =
1
b
Pb−1
k=0 ckξkt,
where ξ = e2πi/b. We deﬁne the convolution of f and g by
(f ∗g)(t) =
b−1
X
m=0
f(t −m)g(m) .
Indeed, it is this convolution tool (the proof of the convolution theorem be-
low is almost trivial!) that is responsible for the fastest known algorithm for
multiplying two polynomials of degree b in O(b log(b)) steps (see the Notes at
the end of this chapter).
Theorem 7.10 (Convolution theorem for ﬁnite Fourier series). Let
f(t) = 1
b
Pb−1
k=0 ak ξkt and g(t) = 1
b
Pb−1
k=0 ck ξkt, where ξ = e2πi/b. Then their
convolution satisﬁes
(f ∗g)(t) = 1
b
b−1
X
k=0
akck ξkt.
Proof. The proof is straightforward: we just compute the left-hand side, and
obtain

because the sum Pb−1

the case that l = k, we have Pb−1
m=0 ξ(l−k)m = b.
⊓⊔
It is an easy exercise (Exercise 7.22) to show that this convolution theorem
is equivalent to the following statement:
F(f ∗g) = b F(f)F(g) .
Note that the proof of Theorem 7.10 is essentially identical with the proof of
Lemma 7.4 above; we could have proved the lemma, in fact, by applying the
convolution theorem. We now show how Theorem 7.10 can be used to derive
identities on trigonometric functions.
Example 7.11. We claim that

Notes
1. Finite Fourier analysis oﬀers a wealth of applications and is, for example,
one of the main tools in quantum information theory. For the reader inter-
ested in going further than the humble beginnings outlined in this chapter,
we heartily recommend Audrey Terras’s monograph [180].
2. The Dedekind sum is our main motivation for studying ﬁnite Fourier series,
and in fact, Chapter 8 is devoted to a detailed investigation of these sums, in
which the Fourier–Dedekind sums of Chapter 1 also ﬁnally reappear.
3. The reader may consult [116, p. 501] for a proof that two polynomials of
degree N can be multiplied in O(N log N) steps. The actual proof of this fact
runs along the following conceptual lines. First, let the two given polynomials
of degree N be f(x) = PN
n=0 a(n)xn and g(x) = PN
n=0 b(n)xn. Then we know
that f(ξ) and g(ξ) are two ﬁnite Fourier series, and we abbreviate them by
f and g, respectively. We now note that fg = F(F−1(f) ∗F−1(g)). If we
can compute the ﬁnite Fourier transform (and its inverse) quickly, then this
argument shows that we can multiply polynomials quickly. It is a fact of life
that we can compute the Fourier transform of a periodic function of period
N in O(N log N) steps, by an algorithm known as the fast Fourier transform
(again, see [116] for a complete description).
4. The continuous Fourier transform, deﬁned by
R ∞
−∞f(t)e−2πitxdt, can be
related to the ﬁnite Fourier transform in the following way. We approximate
the continuous integral by discretizing a large interval [0, a]. Precisely, we let
∆:= a
b , and we let tk := k∆= ka
b . Then
Z a

f(t)e−2πitxdt ≈
b
X
k=1
f(tk)e−2πitkxtk ,
a ﬁnite Fourier series for the function f( a
b x) as a function of x ∈Z. Hence
ﬁnite Fourier series ﬁnd an application to continuous Fourier analysis as an
approximation tool.

Dedekind Sums, the Building Blocks
of Lattice-point Enumeration
If things are nice there is probably a good reason why they are nice: and if you don’t
know at least one reason for this good fortune, then you still have work to do.
Richard Askey
We’ve encountered Dedekind sums in our study of ﬁnite Fourier analysis and
we became intimately acquainted with their siblings in our study of the coin-
exchange problem in Chapter 1. They have one shortcoming, however (which
we’ll remove): the deﬁnition of s(a, b) requires us to sum over b terms, which
is rather slow when b = 2100, for example. Luckily, there is a magical reci-
procity law for the Dedekind sum s(a, b) that allows us to compute it in
roughly log2(b) = 100 steps. This is the kind of magic that saves the day
when we try to enumerate lattice points in integral polytopes of dimensions
d ≤4. There is an ongoing eﬀort to extend these ideas to higher dimensions,
but there is much room for improvement. In this chapter we focus on the
computational-complexity issues that arise when we try to compute Dedekind
sums explicitely.
8.1 Fourier–Dedekind Sums and the Coin-Exchange

8 Dedekind Sums, the Building Blocks of Lattice-point Enumeration
variations of the Dedekind sum that have appeared in the literature, and form
the building blocks of Ehrhart quasipolynomials. For example, we showed in
Chapter 1 that sn (a1, a2, . . . , ad; b) appears in the Ehrhart quasipolynomial
of the d-simplex

8.1 Fourier–Dedekind Sums and the Coin-Exchange Problem Revisited
141
Returning to the general Fourier–Dedekind sum, we now prove the ﬁrst
of a series of reciprocity laws: identities for certain sums of Fourier–Dedekind
sums. We ﬁrst recall how these sums came up in Chapter 1, namely, from the
partial fraction expansion of the function

.
(Here we assume that a1, a2, . . . , ad are pairwise relatively prime.) Theo-
rem 1.7 states that with the help of the partial fraction coeﬃcients B1, . . . , Bd
and Fourier–Dedekind sums, we can compute the restricted partition function
for A = {a1, a2, . . . , ad}:
pA(n) = −B1 + B2 −· · · + (−1)dBd + s−n (a2, a3, . . . , ad; a1)
+ s−n (a1, a3, a4, . . . , ad; a2) + · · · + s−n (a1, a2, . . . , ad−1; ad) .
We note that B1, B2, . . . , Bd are polynomials in n (Exercise 8.6), whence we
call
polyA(n) := −B1 + B2 −· · · + (−1)dBd
the polynomial part of the restricted partition function pA(n).

⊓⊔
We are about to combine the Ehrhart results of Chapter 3 with the partial
fraction expansion of Chapter 1 that gave rise to the Fourier–Dedekind sums.
Theorem 8.4 (Zagier reciprocity). For any pairwise relatively prime pos-
itive integers a1, a2, . . . , ad,
s0 (a2, a3, . . . , ad; a1) + s0 (a1, a3, a4, . . . , ad; a2) + · · ·
+ s0 (a1, a2, . . . , ad−1; ad)
= 1 −poly{a1,a2,...,ad}(0) .
At ﬁrst sight, this reciprocity law should come as a surprise. The Fourier–
Dedekind sums can be complicated, long sums, yet when combined in this
fashion, they add up to a trivial rational function in a1, a2, . . . , ad.
Proof. We compute the constant term of the quasipolynomial pA(n):
pA(0) = polyA(0) + s0 (a2, a3, . . . , ad; a1)
+ s0 (a1, a3, a4, . . . , ad; a2) + · · · + s0 (a1, a2, . . . , ad−1; ad) .
On the other hand, Exercise 3.27 (the extension of Corollary 3.15 to Ehrhart

8.2 The Dedekind Sum and Its Reciprocity
and Computational Complexity
We derived in (8.1) the classical Dedekind sum s(a, b) as a special evaluation
of the Fourier–Dedekind sum. Naturally, Theorem 8.4 takes on a particular
form when we specialize this reciprocity law to the classical Dedekind sum.
Corollary 8.5 (Dedekind’s reciprocity law). For any relatively prime
positive integers a and b,
s(a, b) + s(b, a) = 1

a

Proof. A special case of Theorem 8.4 is
s0(a, 1; b) + s0(b, a; 1) + s0(1, b; a) = 1 −poly{a,1,b}(0)
= 1 −1

Now we use the fact that s0(b, a; 1) = 0 and the identity (8.1):
s0(a, 1; b) = −s(a, b) + 1
4 −1
4b .
⊓⊔
Dedekind’s reciprocity law allows us to compute the Dedekind sum s(a, b)
as quickly as the gcd algorithm for a and b. Let’s get a better feeling for
the way we can compute the Dedekind sum by working out an example. We
remind the reader of another crucial property of the Dedekind sums that we
already pointed out in (7.5): s(a, b) remains invariant when we replace a by
its residue modulo b, that is,
s(a, b) = s(a mod b, b) .
(8.5)
Example 8.6. Let a = 100 and b = 147. Now we alternately use Corollary 8.5
and the reduction identity (8.5):

⊓⊔
As a second corollary to Theorem 8.4, we mention the following three-
term reciprocity law for the special Fourier–Dedekind sum s0(a, b; c). This
reciprocity law could be restated in terms of the classical Dedekind sum via
the identity (8.2).
Corollary 8.7. For pairwise relatively prime positive integers a, b, and c,

8.3 Rademacher Reciprocity for the Fourier–Dedekind
Sum
The next reciprocity law will be again for the general Fourier–Dedekind sums.
It extends Theorem 8.4 beyond n = 0.
Theorem 8.8 (Rademacher reciprocity). Let a1, a2, . . . , ad be pairwise
relatively prime positive integers. Then for n = 1, 2, . . . , (a1 + · · · + ad −1),

8.3 Rademacher Reciprocity for the Fourier–Dedekind Sum

sn (a2, a3, . . . , ad; a1) + sn (a1, a3, a4, . . . , ad; a2) + · · ·
+ sn (a1, a2, . . . , ad−1; ad) = −poly{a1,a2,...,ad}(−n) .
Proof. We recall the deﬁnition
p◦
A(n) = #

(m1, . . . , md) ∈Zd : all mj > 0, m1a1 + · · · + mdad = n
	
of Exercise 1.31, that is, p◦
A(n) counts the number of partitions of n using
only the elements of A as parts, where each part is used at least once. This
counting function is, naturally, connected to pA through Ehrhart–Macdonald
reciprocity (Theorem 4.1):
p◦
A(n) = (−1)d−1pA(−n) ,
that is,
(−1)d−1p◦
A(n) = polyA(−n) + sn (a2, a3, . . . , ad; a1)
+ sn (a1, a3, a4, . . . , ad; a2) + · · · + sn (a1, a2, . . . , ad−1; ad) .
On the other hand, by its very deﬁnition,
p◦
A(n) = 0
for n = 1, 2, . . . , (a1 + · · · + ad −1) ,
so that for those n,
0 = polyA(−n) + sn (a2, a3, . . . , ad; a1)
+ sn (a1, a3, a4, . . . , ad; a2) + · · · + sn (a1, a2, . . . , ad−1; ad) .
⊓⊔
Just as Zagier reciprocity takes on a special form for the classical Dedekind
sum, Rademacher reciprocity specializes for d = 2 to a reciprocity identity for

The two-term reciprocity law allows us to compute the Dedekind–
Rademacher sum as quickly as the gcd algorithm, just as obtained for the clas-
sical Dedekind sum. This fact has an interesting consequence: In Theorem 2.10
and Exercise 2.34 we showed implicitly (see Exercise 8.10) that Dedekind–
Rademacher sums are the only nontrivial ingredients of the Ehrhart quasi-
polynomials of rational polygons. Corollary 8.9 ensures that these Ehrhart
quasipolynomials can be computed almost instantly.

In this section we return to Ehrhart polynomials and illustrate how Dedekind
sums appear naturally in generating-function computations. We will study

As we have done numerous times before, we shift this coeﬃcient to the con-
stant term:
LP(t) = const

1
(1 −zbc) (1 −zac) (1 −zab) (1 −z) zabct

.
To reduce the number of poles, it is convenient to change this function slightly;
the constant term of 1/
 1 −zbc
(1 −zac)
 1 −zab
(1 −z) is 1, so that
LP(t) = const

z−abct −1
(1 −zbc) (1 −zac) (1 −zab) (1 −z)

+ 1 .
This trick becomes useful in the next step, namely expanding the function into
partial fractions. Strictly speaking, we cannot do that, since the numerator
is not a polynomial in z. However, we can think of this rational function as
a sum of two functions. The higher-order poles of both summands that we
will not include in our computation below cancel each other, so we can ignore
them at this stage. The only poles of
z−abct −1
(1 −zbc) (1 −zac) (1 −zab) (1 −z)
(8.7)
are at the ath, bth, cth roots of unity and at 0. (As before, we don’t have
to bother with the coeﬃcients of z = 0 of the partial fraction expansion.) To
make life momentarily easier (the general case is the subject of Exercise 8.12),
let’s assume that a, b, and c are pairwise relatively prime; then all the poles
besides 0 and 1 are simple. The computation of the coeﬃcients for z = 1 is

8.4 The Mordell–Pommersheim Tetrahedron
149
very similar to what we did with the restricted partition function in Chapter 1.
The coeﬃcient in the partial fraction expansion of a nontrivial root of unity,
say ξk
a, is also computed practically as easily as in earlier examples: it is
−
t
a (1 −ξkbc
a
) (1 −ξka)
(8.8)
(see Exercise 8.11). Summing this fraction over k = 1, 2, . . . , a −1 gives rise

−t

X
k=1
1
(1 −ξkbc

) (1 −ξka) = −t s0 (bc, 1; a) .
Putting this coeﬃcient and its siblings for the other roots of unity into the par-
tial fraction expansion and computing the constant term yields (Exercise 8.11)
LP(t) = abc

We recognize instantly that the Fourier–Dedekind sums in this Ehrhart poly-
nomial are in fact classical Dedekind sums by (8.1), and so we arrive at the
following celebrated result.

We ﬁnish this chapter by giving the Ehrhart series of the Mordell–
Pommersheim tetrahedron P. It follows simply from the transformation for-
mulas (computing the Ehrhart numerator coeﬃcients from the Ehrhart poly-
nomial coeﬃcients) of Corollary 3.16 and Exercise 3.10, and hence the Ehrhart
series of P naturally contains Dedekind sums.

Notes
1. The classical Dedekind sums came to life in the 1880s when Richard
Dedekind (1831–1916)1 studied the transformation properties of the Dedekind
η-function [70]
η(z) := eπiz/12 Y
n≥1
 1 −e2πinz
,
a useful computational gadget in the land of modular forms in number theory.
Dedekind’s reciprocity law (Corollary 8.5) follows from one of the functional
transformation identities for η. Dedekind also proved that
12k s(h, k) ≡k + 1 −2
h
k

(mod 8) ,
establishing a beautiful connection between the Dedekind sum and the Jacobi
symbol
  h
k

(the reader may want to consult the lovely Carus monograph
entitled Dedekind Sums, by Emil Grosswald and Hans Rademacher, where the
above result is proved [151, p. 34]), and then used this identity to show that
the reciprocity law for the Dedekind sums (for which [151] contains several
diﬀerent proofs) is equivalent to the reciprocity law for the Jacobi symbol.
2. The Dedekind sums and their generalizations appear in various contexts be-
sides analytic number theory and discrete geometry. Other mathematical areas
in which Dedekind sums show up include topology [101, 131, 190], algebraic
number theory [129, 166], and algebraic geometry [85]. They also have con-
nections to algorithmic complexity [114] and continued fractions [10, 99, 138].

3. The reciprocity laws (Theorems 8.4 and 8.8) for the Fourier–Dedekind
sums were proved in [25]. Theorem 8.4 is equivalent to the reciprocity law for
Don Zagier’s higher-dimensional Dedekind sums [190]. Corollary 8.7 (stated
in terms of the classical Dedekind sum) is originally due to Hans Rademacher
[149]. Theorem 8.8 generalizes reciprocity laws by Rademacher [150] (essen-
tially Corollary 8.9) and Ira Gessel [87].
4. The Fourier–Dedekind sums form only one set of generalizations of the
classical Dedekind sums. A long, but by no means complete, list of other
generalizations is [5, 6, 21, 34, 35, 36, 56, 77, 78, 87, 92, 93, 113, 129, 131,
130, 150, 179, 190].
5. The connection of Dedekind sums and lattice-point problems, namely The-
orem 8.11 for t = 1, was ﬁrst established by Louis Mordell in 1951 [136]. Some
42 years later, James Pommersheim established a proof of Theorem 8.11 as
part of a much more general machinery [146]. In fact, Pommersheim’s work
implies that the classical Dedekind sum is the only nontrivial ingredient one
needs for Ehrhart polynomials in dimensions three and four.
6. We touched the question of eﬃcient computability of Ehrhart (quasi-)po-
lynomials in this chapter. Unfortunately, our current state of knowledge on
generalized Dedekind sums does not suﬃce to make any general statement.
However, Alexander Barvinok proved in 1994 [15] that in ﬁxed dimension,
the rational generating function of the Ehrhart quasipolynomial of a ratio-
nal polytope can be eﬃciently computed. Barvinok’s proof did not employ
Dedekind sums but rather used a decomposition theorem of Brion, which is
the subject of Chapter 9.

The Decomposition of a Polytope
into Its Cones
Mathematics compares the most diverse phenomena and discovers the secret analo-
gies that unite them.
Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768–1830)
In this chapter, we return to integer-point transforms of rational cones and
polytopes and connect them in a magical way that was ﬁrst discovered by
Michel Brion. The power of Brion’s theorem has been applied to various do-
mains, such as Barvinok’s algorithm in integer linear programming, and to
higher-dimensional Euler–Maclaurin summation formulas, which we study in
Chapter 10. In a sense, Brion’s theorem is the natural extension of the familiar
ﬁnite geometric series identity Pb
m=a zm = zb+1−za
z−1
to higher dimensions.
9.1 The Identity “P
m∈Z zm = 0”. . .
. . . or “Much Ado About Nothing”
We start gently by illustrating Brion’s theorem in dimension one. To this end,
let’s consider the line segment I := [20, 34]. We recall that its integer-point
transform lists the lattice points in I in the form of monomials:
σI(z) =
X
m∈I∩Z
zm = z20 + z21 + · · · + z34.
Already in this simple example, we are too lazy to list all integers in I and
use · · · to write the polynomial σI. Is there a more compact way to write
σI? The reader might have guessed it even before we asked the question: this
integer-point transform equals the rational function
σI(z) = z20 −z35
1 −z
.

156
9 The Decomposition of a Polytope into Its Cones
This last sentence is not quite correct: the deﬁnition of σI(z) yielded a poly-
nomial in z, whereas the rational function above is not deﬁned at z = 1.
We can overcome this deﬁciency by noticing that the limit of this rational
function as z →1 equals the evaluation of the polynomials σI(1) = 15, by
L’Hˆopital’s rule. Notice that the rational-function representation of σI has
the unquestionable advantage of being much more compact than the original
polynomial representation. The reader who is not convinced of this advantage
should replace the right vertex 34 of I by 3400.
Now let’s rewrite the rational form of the integer-point transform of I
slightly:
σI(z) = z20 −z35
1 −z
=
z20
1 −z +
z34
1 −1
z
.
(9.1)
There is a natural geometric interpretation of the two summands on the right-
hand side. The ﬁrst term represents the integer-point transform of the interval
[20, ∞):
σ[20,∞)(z) =
X
m≥20
zm =
z20
1 −z .
The second term in (9.1) corresponds to the integer-point transform of the
interval (−∞, 34]:
σ(−∞,34](z) =
X
m≤34
zm =
z34
1 −1
z
.
So (9.1) says that on a rational-function level,
σ[20,∞)(z) + σ(−∞,34](z) = σ[20,34](z) .
(9.2)
This identity, which we illustrate graphically in Figure 9.1, should come

as a mild surprise. Two rational functions that represent inﬁnite sequences
somehow collapse, when being summed up, to a polynomial with a ﬁnite
number of terms. We emphasize that (9.2) does not make sense on the level of
inﬁnite series; in fact, the two inﬁnite series involved here have disjoint regions
of convergence.

9.1 The Identity “P
m∈Z zm = 0”. . . or “Much Ado About Nothing”
157
Even more magical is the geometry behind this identity: on the right-hand
side we have a polynomial that lists the integer points in a ﬁnite interval P,
while on the left-hand side each of the rational generating functions represents
the integer points in an inﬁnite ray that begins at a vertex of P. The two
half-lines will be called vertex cones below, and indeed the remainder of this
chapter is devoted to proving that an identity similar to (9.2) holds in general
dimension.
We now extend the deﬁnition of integer-point transforms σA(z) from the
case of cones A to the case of aﬃne spaces A. Any such aﬃne space A ⊆Rd
equals w + V for some w ∈Rd and some n-dimensional vector subspace
V ⊆Rd, and if A contains integer points (which is the only interesting case
for our purposes), we may choose w ∈Zd. The integer points V ∩Zd in V
form a vector space, and hence there exists a basis v1, v2, . . . , vn for V ∩Zd.
This implies that any integer point m ∈A ∩Zd can be uniquely written as
m = w + k1v1 + k2v2 + · · · + knvn
for some
k1, k2, . . . , kn ∈Z .
Using this ﬁxed lattice basis for V, we deﬁne the skewed orthants of A as the
sets of the form {w + λ1v1 + λ2v2 + · · · + λnvn}, where for each 1 ≤j ≤n,
we require either λj ≥0 or λj < 0. So there are 2n such skewed orthants,
and their disjoint union equals A. We denote them by O1, O2, . . . , O2n. All of
them are (half-open) pointed cones, and so their integer-point transforms are
rational.
Lemma 9.1. Suppose A is an n-dimensional aﬃne space with skewed or-
thants O1, O2, . . . , O2n. Then as rational functions,
σO1(z) + σO2(z) + · · · + σO2n(z) = 0 .
Proof. Suppose
A = {w + λ1v1 + λ2v2 + · · · + λnvn : λ1, λ2, . . . , λn ∈R} .
Then a typical skewed orthant O looks like
O = {w + λ1v1 + λ2v2 + · · · + λnvn : λ1, . . . , λk ≥0, λk+1, . . . , λn < 0} ,
and its integer-point transform is

Now consider the skewed orthant O′ with the same conditions on the λ’s as in
O except that we switch λ1 ≥0 to λ1 < 0. Then the integer-point transform
of O′ is

so that σO(z) + σO′(z) = 0. Since we can pair up all skewed orthants in this
fashion, the sum of all their rational generating functions is zero.
⊓⊔
Since O1 ∪O2 ∪· · · ∪O2n is equal to A as a disjoint union, it now makes
sense to set
σA(z) := 0
(9.3)
for any n-dimensional aﬃne space with n > 0. Lemma 9.1 says that this deﬁn-
ition is not as arbitrary as it might seem, and the following result strengthens
our motivation for the deﬁnition (9.3).
Theorem 9.2. Given half-open pointed cones K1, K2, . . . , Km ⊆Rd with a
common apex in Zd such that the disjoint union of K1, K2, . . . , Km is an aﬃne
space, then as rational functions,
σK1(z) + σK2(z) + · · · + σKm(z) = 0 .
Proof. Suppose the disjoint union of K1, K2, . . . , Km is the n-dimensional
aﬃne space A, and w ∈Zd is the common apex of K1, K2, . . . , Km. Now
we decompose A into the skewed orthants O1, O2, . . . , O2n, which are also
pointed cones with common apex w. The intersection of one of the Kj’s with
one of the Ok’s is again a half-open pointed cone, and all these cones form yet
another disjoint union of A, which is a common reﬁnement of the dissection
of A in terms of the Kj’s and in terms of the Ok’s:
A =
[
1≤j≤m
1≤k≤2n
(Kj ∩Ok) .
For each 1 ≤j ≤m, Kj = S2n
k=1 (Kj ∩Ok) as a disjoint union, and so we can
write the integer-point transform of Kj as
σKj(z) =
2n
X
k=1
σKj∩Ok(z) ,
as a rational-function identity. Similarly, we obtain for each 1 ≤k ≤2n,
σOk(z) =

σKj∩Ok(z) .
Thus

9.2 Tangent Cones and Their Rational Generating Functions

9.2 Tangent Cones and Their Rational Generating
Functions
The goal of this section, apart from setting the language that allows us to prove
Brion’s theorem, is to prove a sort of analogue of (9.2) in general dimension.
We recall a deﬁnition that was touched on only brieﬂy, in Exercise 3.14:
A hyperplane arrangement H is a ﬁnite collection of hyperplanes. An
arrangement H is rational if all its hyperplanes are, that is, if each hy-
perplane in H is of the form

x ∈Rd : a1x1 + a2x2 + · · · + adxd = b
	
for
some a1, a2, . . . , ad, b ∈Z. An arrangement H is called a central hyperplane
arrangement if its hyperplanes meet in (at least) one point.
Our next deﬁnition generalizes (ﬁnally) the notion of a pointed cone,
deﬁned in Chapter 3. A convex cone is the intersection of ﬁnitely many
half-spaces of the form

x ∈Rd : a1x1 + a2x2 + · · · + adxd ≤b
	
for which the
corresponding hyperplanes

x ∈Rd : a1x1 + a2x2 + · · · + adxd = b
	
form a
central arrangement. This deﬁnition extends that of a pointed cone: a cone
is pointed if the deﬁning hyperplanes meet in exactly one point. A cone is
rational if all of its deﬁning hyperplanes are rational. Cones and polytopes
are special cases of polyhedra, which are convex bodies deﬁned as the inter-
section of ﬁnitely many half-spaces.
We now attach a cone to each face F of P, namely its tangent cone,
deﬁned by
KF := {x + λ (y −x) : x ∈F, y ∈P, λ ∈R≥0} .
It turns out that KF is the smallest convex cone containing both span F and
P. We note that KP = span P. For a vertex v of P, the tangent cone Kv is
often called a vertex cone; it is pointed. For a k-face F of P with k > 0, the
tangent cone KF is not pointed. For example, the tangent cone of an edge of
a 3-polytope is a wedge.
Lemma 9.3. For any face F of P, span F ⊆KF.
Proof. As x and y vary over all points of F, x + λ (y −x) varies over span F.
⊓⊔
We note that this lemma implies that KF contains a line, unless F is a
vertex. More precisely, if KF is not pointed, it contains the aﬃne space span F,
which is called the apex of the tangent cone. (A pointed cone has a point as
apex.)
An aﬃne space A ⊆Rd equals w + V for some w ∈Rd and some vector
subspace V ⊆Rd. The orthogonal complement A⊥of this aﬃne space A
is deﬁned by
A⊥:=

x ∈Rd : x · v = 0 for all v ∈V
	
.
We note that A ⊕A⊥= Rd, which gives us the following result.

160
9 The Decomposition of a Polytope into Its Cones
Lemma 9.4. For any face F of P, the tangent cone KF has the decomposition
KF = span F ⊕

(span F)⊥∩KF

.
Consequently, unless F is a vertex,
σKF (z) = 0 .
Proof. Since span F ⊕(span F)⊥= Rd,
KF =

span F ⊕(span F)⊥
∩KF
= (span F ∩KF) ⊕

(span F)⊥∩KF

= span F ⊕

(span F)⊥∩KF

,
where the last step follows from Lemma 9.3. The second part of the lemma is
immediate since σspan F⊕((span F)⊥∩KF)(z) = σspan F(z) σ(span F)⊥∩KF (z) and
σspan F(z) = 0.
⊓⊔
Although we do not need this fact in the sequel, it’s nice to know that
(span F)⊥∩KF is a pointed cone (see Exercise 9.1).
9.3 Brion’s Theorem
The following theorem is a classical identity of convex geometry named after
Charles Julien Brianchon (1783–1864)1 and Jørgen Pedersen Gram (1850–
1916).2 It holds for any convex polytope. However, its proof for simplices
is considerably simpler than that for the general case. We need only the
Brianchon–Gram identity for simplices, so we restrict ourselves to this special
case. (One could prove the general case along similar lines as below; however,
we would need some additional machinery not covered in this book.) The
indicator function 1S of a set S ⊂Rd is deﬁned by
1S(x) :=
 1 if x ∈S,
0 if x ̸∈S.
Theorem 9.5 (Brianchon–Gram identity for simplices). Let ∆be a d-
simplex. Then
1∆(x) =
X
F⊆∆
(−1)dim F1KF (x) ,
where the sum is taken over all nonempty faces F of ∆.
1 For more information about Brainchon, see
http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/∼history/Biographies/Brainchon.html.
2 For more information about Gram, see
http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/∼history/Biographies/Gram.html.

9.3 Brion’s Theorem
161
Proof. We distinguish between two disjoint cases: whether or not x is in the
simplex.
Case 1: x ∈∆. Then x ∈KF for all F ⊆∆, and the identity becomes
1 =
X
F⊆∆
(−1)dim F =
dim ∆
X
k=0
(−1)kfk .
This is the Euler relation for simplices, which we proved in Exercise 5.5.
Case 2: x /∈∆. Then there is a unique minimal face F ⊆∆(minimal with
respect to dimension) such that x ∈KF and x ∈KG for all faces G ⊆∆that
contain F (Exercise 9.2). The identity to be proved is now
0 =
X
G⊇F
(−1)dim G.
(9.4)
The validity of this identity again follows from the logic of Exercise 5.5; the
proof of (9.4) is the subject of Exercise 9.4.
⊓⊔
Corollary 9.6 (Brion’s theorem for simplices). Suppose ∆is a rational
simplex. Then we have the following identity of rational functions:
σ∆(z) =
X
v a vertex of ∆
σKv(z) .
Proof. We translate the Brianchon–Gram theorem into the language of inte-
ger-point transforms: we sum both sides of the identity in Theorem 9.5 for all
m ∈Zd,
X
m∈Zd
1∆(m) zm =
X
m∈Zd
X
F⊆∆
(−1)dim F1KF (m) zm,
which is equivalent to
σ∆(z) =
X
F⊆∆
(−1)dim FσKF (z) .
But Lemma 9.4 implies that σKF (z) = 0 except when F is a vertex. Hence
σ∆(z) =
X
v a vertex of ∆
σKv(z) .
⊓⊔
Now we extend Corollary 9.6 to any convex rational polytope:
Theorem 9.7 (Brion’s theorem). Suppose P is a rational convex polytope.
Then we have the following identity of rational functions:
σP(z) =
X
v a vertex of P
σKv(z) .
(9.5)

162
9 The Decomposition of a Polytope into Its Cones
Proof. We use the same irrational trick as in the proofs of Theorems 3.12 and
4.3. Namely we start by triangulating P into the simplices ∆1, ∆2, . . . , ∆m
(using no new vertices). Consider the hyperplane arrangement
H := {span F : F is a facet of ∆1, ∆2, . . . , or ∆m} .
We will now shift the hyperplanes in H, obtaining a new hyperplane arrange-
ment Hshift. Those hyperplanes of H that deﬁned P now deﬁne, after shifting,
a new polytope that we will call Pshift. Exercise 9.6 ensures that we can shift
H in such a way that:
•
no hyperplane in Hshift contains any lattice point;
•
Hshift yields a triangulation of Pshift;
•
the lattice points contained in a vertex cone of P are precisely the lattice
points contained in the corresponding vertex cone of Pshift.
This setup implies that
•
the lattice points in P are precisely the lattice points in Pshift;
•
the lattice points in a vertex cone of Pshift can be written as a disjoint
union of lattice points in vertex cones of simplices of the triangulation that
Hshift induces on Pshift.
The latter two conditions, in turn, mean that Brion’s identity (9.5) follows
from Brion’s theorem for simplices: the integer-point transforms on both sides
of the identity can be written as a sum of integer-point transforms of simplices
and their vertex cones.
⊓⊔
9.4 Brion Implies Ehrhart
We conclude this chapter by showing that Ehrhart’s theorem (Theorem 3.23)
for rational polytopes (which includes the integral case, Theorem 3.8) follows
from Brion’s theorem (Theorem 9.7) in a relatively straightforward manner.
Second proof of Theorem 3.23. As in our ﬁrst proof of Ehrhart’s theorem, it
suﬃces to prove Theorem 3.23 for simplices, because we can triangulate any
polytope (using only the vertices). So suppose ∆is a rational d-simplex whose
vertices have coordinates with denominator p. Our goal is to show that, for a
ﬁxed 0 ≤r < p, the function L∆(r + pt) is a polynomial in t; this means that
L∆is a quasipolynomial with period dividing p.
By Theorem 9.7,
L∆(r + pt) =
X
m∈(r+pt)∆∩Zd
1
= lim
z→1 σ(r+pt)∆(z)
(9.6)
= lim
z→1
X
v vertex of ∆
σ(r+pt)Kv(z) .

Notes
163
We used the limit computation for the integer-point transform σ(r+pt)∆rather
than the evaluation σ(r+pt)∆(1), because this evaluation would have yielded
singularities in the rational generating functions of the vertex cones. Note that
the vertex cones Kv are all simplicial, because ∆is a simplex. So suppose
Kv = {v + λ1w1 + λ2w2 + · · · + λdwd : λ1, λ2, . . . , λd ≥0} ;
then
(r + pt)Kv = {(r + pt)v + λ1w1 + λ2w2 + · · · + λdwd : λ1, λ2, . . . , λd ≥0}
= tpv + {rv + λ1w1 + λ2w2 + · · · + λdwd : λ1, λ2, . . . , λd ≥0}
= tpv + rKv .
What’s important to note here is that pv is an integer vector. In particular,
we can safely write
σ(r+pt)Kv(z) = ztpvσrKv(z)
(we say “safely” because tpv ∈Zd, so ztpv is indeed a monomial). Now we
can rewrite (9.6) as
L∆(r + pt) = lim
z→1
X
v vertex of ∆
ztpvσrKv(z) .
(9.7)
The exact forms of the rational functions σrKv(z) is not important, except for
the fact that they do not depend on t. We know that the sum of the generating
functions of all vertex cones is a polynomial in z; that is, the singularities of
the rational functions cancel. To compute L∆(r + pt) from (9.7), we write
all the rational functions on the right-hand side over one denominator and
use L’Hˆopital’s rule to compute the limit of this one huge rational function.
The variable t appears only in the simple monomials ztpv, so the eﬀect of
L’Hˆopital’s rule is that we obtain linear factors of t every time we diﬀerentiate
the numerator of this rational function. At the end we evaluate the remaining
rational function at z = 1. The result is a polynomial in t.
⊓⊔
Notes
1. Theorem 9.5 (in its general form for convex polytopes) has an interesting
history. In 1837 Charles Brianchon proved a version of this theorem involving
volumes of polytopes in R3 [44]. In 1874 Jørgen Gram gave a proof of the same
result [88]; apparently he was unaware of Brianchon’s paper. In 1927 Duncan
Sommerville published a proof for general d [167], which was corrected in the
1960s by Victor Klee [111], Branko Gr¨unbaum [90, Section 14.1], and many
others.
2. Michel Brion discovered Theorem 9.7 in 1988 [45]. His proof involved the
Baum–Fulton–Quart Riemann–Roch formula for equivariant K-theory of toric

varieties. A more elementary proof of Theorem 9.7 was found by Masa-Nori
Ishida a few years later [103]. Our approach in this chapter follows [27].
3. As we have already remarked earlier, Brion’s theorem led to an eﬃcient
algorithm by Alexander Barvinok to compute Ehrhart quasipolynomials [15].
More precisely, Barvinok proved that in ﬁxed dimension, one can eﬃciently3
compute the Ehrhart series P
t≥0 LP(t) zt as a short sum of rational func-
tions.4 Brion’s theorem essentially reduces the problem to computing the
integer-point transforms of the rational tangent cones of the polytope. Barvi-
nok’s ingenious idea was to use a signed decomposition of a rational cone to
compute its integer-point transform: the cone is written as a sum and diﬀer-
ence of unimodular cones, which we will encounter in Section 10.4 and which
have a trivial integer-point transform. Finding a signed decomposition involves
triangulations, Minkowski’s theorem on lattice points in convex bodies (see,
for example, [57, 133, 140, 163]), and the LLL algorithm which ﬁnds a short
vector in a lattice [121]. At any rate, Barvinok proved that one can ﬁnd a
signed decomposition quickly, which is the main step towards computing the
Ehrhart series of the polytope. Barvinok’s algorithm has been implemented
in the software packages barvinok [185] and LattE [66, 67, 115]. Barvinok’s
algorithm is described in detail in [13].

the diﬀerence between the discrete integer-point transform and its continuous
sibling:
X
m∈P∩Zd
em·x −
Z
P
ey·xdy ,
(10.2)
where we have replaced the variable z that we have commonly used in generat-
ing functions by the exponential variable (z1, z2, . . . , zd) = (ex1, ex2, . . . , exd).
Note that upon setting x = 0 in (10.2) we get the former quantity (10.1). Re-
lations between the two quantities P
m∈P∩Zd em·x and
R
P ey·xdy are known as
Euler–Maclaurin summation formulas for polytopes. The “behind-the-scenes”
operators that are responsible for aﬀording us with such connections are the
diﬀerential operators known as Todd operators, whose deﬁnition utilizes the
Bernoulli numbers in a surprising way.
10.1 Todd Operators and Bernoulli Numbers
Recall the Bernoulli numbers Bk from Section 2.4, deﬁned by the generating
function

We now introduce a diﬀerential operator via essentially the same generating
function, namely
Toddh := 1 +

.
(10.3)
This Todd operator is often abbreviated as
Toddh =

dh ,
but we should keep in mind that this is only a shorthand notation for the
inﬁnite series (10.3). We ﬁrst show that the exponential function is an eigen-
function of the Todd operator.
Lemma 10.1. For z ∈C \ {0} with |z| < 2π,
Toddh ezh =

1 −e−z .
Proof.
Toddh ezh =

The condition |z| < 2π is needed in the last step, by Exercise 2.14.
⊓⊔
The Todd operator is a discretizing operator, in the sense that it transforms
a continuous integral into a discrete sum, as the following theorem shows.
Theorem 10.2 (Euler–Maclaurin in dimension 1). For all a < b ∈Z

10.2 A Continuous Version of Brion’s Theorem
In the following two sections, we develop the tools that, once fused with the
Todd operator, will enable us to extend Euler–Maclaurin summation to higher
dimensions. A lemma, which is of independent interest, but will be used in
the proof of the continous version of Brion’s theorem, now follows.
Lemma 10.3. Suppose w1, w2, . . . , wd ∈Zd are linearly independent, and let
Π = {λ1w1 + λ2w2 + · · · + λdwd : 0 ≤λ1, λ2, . . . , λd < 1} .
Then
#
 Π ∩Zd
= vol Π = |det (w1, . . . , wd)|
and for any positive integer t,
#
 tΠ ∩Zd
= (vol Π) td.
In other words, for the half-open parallelepiped Π, the discrete volume
#
 tΠ ∩Zd
coincides with the continuous volume (vol Π) td.
Proof. Because Π is half open, we can tile the tth dilate tΠ by td translates
of Π, and hence
LΠ(t) = #
 tΠ ∩Zd
= #
 Π ∩Zd
td.
On the other hand, by the results of Chapter 3, LΠ(t) is a polynomial with
leading coeﬃcient vol Π = |det (w1, . . . , wd)|. Since we have equality of these
polynomials for all positive integers t,
#
 Π ∩Zd
= vol Π .
⊓⊔
We now give an integral analogue of Theorem 9.7 for simple rational poly-
topes. We start by translating Brion’s integer-point transforms
σP(z) =
X
v a vertex of P
σKv(z)
into an exponential form:
σP(exp z) =
X
v a vertex of P
σKv(exp z) .
For the continuous analogue of Brion’s theorem, we replace the sum on the
left-hand side,
σP(exp z) =
X
m∈P∩Zd
(exp z)m =
X
m∈P∩Zd
exp(m · z) ,
by an integral.

10.2 A Continuous Version of Brion’s Theorem
171
Theorem 10.4 (Brion’s theorem: continuous form). Suppose P is a
simple rational convex d-polytope. For a vertex cone Kv of P, ﬁx a set of
generators w1(v), w2(v), . . . , wd(v) ∈Zd. Then
Z
P
exp(x · z) dx = (−1)d
X
v a vertex of P
exp (v · z) |det (w1(v), . . . , wd(v))|
Qd
k=1 (wk(v) · z)
for all z such that the denominators on the right-hand side do not vanish.
Proof. We start with the assumption that P is an integral polytope; we will
see in the process of the proof that this assumption can be relaxed. Let’s
write out the exponential form of Brion’s theorem (Theorem 9.7), using the
assumption that the vertex cones are simplicial (because P is simple). By
Theorem 3.5,
X
m∈P∩Zd
exp(m · z) =
X
v a vertex of P
exp(v · z) σΠv(exp z)
Qd
k=1 (1 −exp (wk(v) · z))
,
(10.4)
where
Πv = {λ1w1(v) + λ2w2(v) + · · · + λdwd(v) : 0 ≤λ1, λ2, . . . , λd < 1}
is the fundamental parallelepiped of the vertex cone Kv. We would like to
rewrite (10.4) with the lattice Zd replaced by the reﬁned lattice
  1
nZ
d, be-
cause then the left-hand side of (10.4) will give rise to the sought-after integral
by letting n approach inﬁnity. The right-hand side of (10.4) changes accord-
ingly; now every integral point has to be scaled down by 1
n:

(10.5)
The proof of this identity is in essence the same as that of Theorem 3.5; we
leave it as Exercise 10.2. Now our sought-after integral is

(10.6)
At this point we can see that our assumption that P has integral vertices can
be relaxed to the rational case, since we may compute the limit only for n’s
that are multiples of the denominator of P. The numerators of the terms on
the right-hand side have a simple limit:

where the last identity follows from Lemma 10.3. Hence (10.6) simpliﬁes to

and the theorem follows.
⊓⊔
It turns out (Exercise 10.4) that for each vertex cone Kv,
Z
Kv
exp(x · z) dx = (−1)d exp (v · z) |det (w1(v), . . . , wd(v))|
Qd
k=1 (wk(v) · z)
,
(10.7)
and Theorem 10.4 shows that the Fourier–Laplace transform of P equals the
sum of the Fourier–Laplace transforms of the vertex cones. In other words,
Z
P
exp(x · z) dx =
X
v a vertex of P
Z
Kv
exp(x · z) dx .
We also remark that |det (w1(v), . . . , wd(v))| has a geometric meaning: it
is the volume of the fundamental parallelepiped of the vertex cone Kv.
The curious reader might wonder what happens to the statement of The-
orem 10.4 if we scale each of the generators wk(v) by a diﬀerent factor. It is
immediate (Exercise 10.5) that the right-hand side of Theorem 10.4 remains
invariant.
10.3 Polytopes Have Their Moments
The most common notion for moments of a set P ⊂Rd is
µa :=
Z
P
ya dy =
Z
P
ya1
1 ya2
2 · · · yad
d dy
for any ﬁxed vector a = (a1, a2, . . . , ad) ∈Cd. For a = 0 = (0, 0, . . . , 0), we
get µ0 = vol P. As an application of moments, consider the problem of ﬁnding
the center of mass of P, which is deﬁned by
1
vol P
Z
P
y1 dy ,
Z
P
y2 dy , . . . ,
Z
P

.

10.3 Polytopes Have Their Moments
173
This integral is equal to
1
µ0
 µ(1,0,0,...,0), µ(0,1,0,...,0), . . . , µ(0,...,0,1)

.
Similarly, one can deﬁne the variance of P and other statistical data attached
to P and use moments to compute them.
Our next task is to present the moments µa in terms of Theorem 10.4. We
make the change of variables yk = exk in the deﬁning integral of µa:
µa =
Z
P
ya dy =
Z
P
ex1a1ex2a2 · · · exdad ex1ex2 · · · exd dx =
Z
P
ex·(a+1) dx .
Thus Theorem 10.4 gives us the following formulas for the moments of a simple
rational d-polytope P:
µa = (−1)d
X
v a vertex of P
exp (v · (a + 1)) |det (w1(v), . . . , wd(v))|
Qd
k=1 (wk(v) · (a + 1))
,
for all a such that the denominators on the right-hand side do not vanish.
Going a step further, we can use Theorem 10.4 to obtain information for a
diﬀerent set of moments. Along the way, we stumble on an amazing formula
for the continuous volume of a polytope.
Theorem 10.5. Suppose P is a simple rational convex d-polytope. For a ver-
tex cone Kv of P, ﬁx a set of generators w1(v), w2(v), . . . , wd(v) ∈Zd. Then
vol P = (−1)d
d!
X
v a vertex of P
(v · z)d |det (w1(v), . . . , wd(v))|
Qd
k=1 (wk(v) · z)
for all z such that the denominators on the right-hand side do not vanish.
More generally, for any integer j ≥0,
Z
P
(x · z)j dx = (−1)dj!
(j + d)!
X
v a vertex of P
(v · z)j+d |det (w1(v), . . . , wd(v))|
Qd
k=1 (wk(v) · z)
.
Proof. We replace the variable z in the identity of Theorem 10.4 by sz, where
s is a scalar:
Z
P
exp (x · (sz)) dx = (−1)d
X
v a vertex of P
exp (v · (sz)) |det (w1(v), . . . , wd(v))|
Qd
k=1 (wk(v) · (sz))
,
which can be rewritten as
Z
P
exp (s (x · z)) dx = (−1)d
X
v a vertex of P
exp (s (v · z)) |det (w1(v), . . . , wd(v))|
sd Qd
k=1 (wk(v) · (z))
.

174
10 Euler–Maclaurin Summation in Rd
The general statement of the corollary follows now by ﬁrst expanding the
exponential functions as Taylor series in s, and then comparing coeﬃcients
on both sides:

j≥0

(j + d)! .
⊓⊔
The proof of this corollary reveals yet more identities between rational
functions. Namely, the coeﬃcients of the negative powers of s in the last line
of the proof have to be zero. This immediately yields the following curious set
of d identities for simple d-polytopes:
Corollary 10.6. Suppose P is a simple rational convex d-polytope. For a ver-
tex cone Kv of P, ﬁx a set of generators w1(v), w2(v), . . . , wd(v) ∈Zd. Then
for 0 ≤j ≤d −1,

(v · z)j |det (w1(v), . . . , wd(v))|
Qd
k=1 (wk(v) · (z))

⊓⊔
10.4 From the Continuous to the Discrete Volume
of a Polytope
In this section, we apply the Todd operator to a perturbation of the continuous
volume. Namely, consider a simple full-dimensional polytope P, which we may
write as
P =

x ∈Rd : A x ≤b
	
.
Then we deﬁne the perturbed polytope
P(h) :=

x ∈Rd : A x ≤b + h
	
for a “small” vector h ∈Rm. A famous theorem due to Askold Khovanski˘ı and
Aleksandr Pukhlikov says that the integer-point count in P can be obtained
from applying the Todd operator to vol (P(h)). Here we prove the theorem
for a certain class of polytopes, which we need to deﬁne ﬁrst.
We call a rational pointed d-cone unimodular if its generators are a basis
of Zd.
An integral polytope is unimodular if each of its vertex cones is
unimodular.1
1 Unimodular polytopes go by two additional names, namely smooth and
Delzant.

10.4 From the Continuous to the Discrete Volume of a Polytope

Theorem 10.7 (Khovanski˘ı–Pukhlikov theorem). For a unimodular d-
polytope P,

More generally,
σP(exp z) = Toddh

Proof. We use Theorem 10.4, the continuous version of Brion’s theorem; note
that if P is unimodular, then P is automatically simple. For a vertex cone
Kv of P, denote its generators by w1(v), w2(v), . . . , wd(v) ∈Zd. Then The-
orem 10.4 states that
Z
P
exp(x · z) dx = (−1)d

(10.8)
where the last identity follows from Exercise 10.3. A similar formula holds
for P(h), except that we have to account for the shift of the vertices. The
vector h shifts the facet-deﬁning hyperplanes. This shift of the facets induces
a shift of the vertices; let’s say that the vertex v gets moved along each edge
direction wk (the vectors that generate the vertex cone Kv) by hk(v), so that
P(h) has now the vertex v −Pd
k=1 hk(v)wk(v). If h is small enough, P(h)
will still be simple,2 and we can apply Theorem 10.4 to P(h):

Strictly speaking, this formula holds only for h ∈Qm, so that the vertices
of P(h) are rational. Since we will eventually set h = 0, this is a harmless
restriction. Now we apply the Todd operator:

P(h) exp(x·z) dx gives us the discrete integer-point transform σP(z).

where Bk(x) denotes the kth Bernoulli polynomial. It was discovered indepen-
dently by Leonhard Euler and Colin Maclaurin (1698–1746).3 This formula
provides an explicit error term, whereas Theorem 10.2 provides a summation
formula with no error term.
2. The Todd operator was introduced by Friedrich Hirzebruch in the 1950s
[100], following a more complicated deﬁnition by J. A. Todd [181, 182] some
twenty years earlier. The Khovanski˘ı–Pukhlikov theorem (Theorem 10.7)
can be interpreted as a combinatorial analogue of the algebro-geometric
Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem, in which the Todd operator plays a
prominent role.
3. Theorem 10.4, the continuous form of Brion’s theorem, was generalized by
Alexander Barvinok to any polytope [11]. In fact, [11] contains a certain ex-
tension of Brion’s theorem to irrational polytopes as well. The decomposition
formula for moments of a polytope in Theorem 10.5 is due to Michel Brion
and Mich`ele Vergne [46].
4. Theorem 10.7 was ﬁrst proved in 1992 by Askold Khovanski˘ı and Alek-
sandr Pukhlikov [108]. The proof we give here is essentially theirs. Their paper
[108] also draws parallels between toric varieties and lattice polytopes. Subse-
quently, many attempts to provide formulas for Ehrhart quasipolynomials—
some based on Theorem 10.7—have provided fertile ground for deeper con-
nections and future work; a long but by no means complete list of references
is [9, 33, 46, 55, 60, 61, 76, 91, 106, 107, 119, 125, 137, 146, 178].

Solid Angles
Everything you’ve learned in school as “obvious” becomes less and less obvious as
you begin to study the universe. For example, there are no solids in the universe.
There’s not even a suggestion of a solid. There are no absolute continuums. There
are no surfaces. There are no straight lines.
Buckminster Fuller (1895–1983)
The natural generalization of a two-dimensional angle to higher dimensions is
called a solid angle. Given a pointed cone K ⊂Rd, the solid angle at its apex
is the proportion of space that the cone K occupies. In slightly diﬀerent words,
if we pick a point x ∈Rd “at random,” then the probability that x ∈K is
precisely the solid angle at the apex of K. Yet another view of solid angles is
that they are in fact volumes of spherical polytopes: the region of intersection
of a cone with a sphere. There is a theory here that parallels the Ehrhart
theory of Chapters 3 and 4, but which has some genuinely new ideas.
11.1 A New Discrete Volume Using Solid Angles
Suppose P ⊂Rd is a convex rational d-polyhedron. The solid angle ωP(x)
of a point x (with respect to P) is a real number equal to the proportion of a
small ball centered at x that is contained in P. That is, we let Bǫ(x) denote
the ball of radius ǫ centered at x and deﬁne
ωP(x) := vol (Bǫ(x) ∩P)
vol Bǫ(x)
for all positive ǫ suﬃciently small. We note that when x /∈P, ωP(x) = 0;
when x ∈P◦, ωP(x) = 1; when x ∈∂P, 0 < ωP(x) < 1. The solid angle
of a face F of P is deﬁned by picking any point x in the relative interior F◦
and setting ωP(F) = ωP(x).

180
11 Solid Angles
Example 11.1. We compute the solid angles of the faces belonging to the
standard 3-simplex ∆= conv {(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)}. As we just
mentioned, a point interior to ∆has solid angle 1. Every facet has solid angle
1
2 (and this remains true for any polytope).
The story gets interesting with the edges: here we are computing dihedral
angles. The dihedral angle of any one-dimensional edge is deﬁned by the
angle between the outward-pointing normal to one of its deﬁning facets and
the inward-pointing normal to its other deﬁning facet.
B
C

O
Each of the edges OA, OB, and OC in the above ﬁgure have the same
solid angle

deﬁning facets as follows:

= cos−1

.
The edges AC and BC have the same solid angle by symmetry.
Finally, we compute the solid angle of the vertices: the origin has solid
angle 1
8, and the other three vertices all have the same solid angle ω. With
Corollary 11.9 below (the Brianchon–Gram relation), we can compute this
angle via

⊓⊔
We now introduce another measure of discrete volume; namely, we let

11.1 A New Discrete Volume Using Solid Angles
181
AP(t) :=
X
m∈tP∩Zd
ωtP(m) ,
the sum of the solid angles at all integer points in tP; recalling that ωP(x) = 0
if x /∈P, we can also write
AP(t) =
X
m∈Zd
ωtP(m) .
This new discrete volume measure diﬀers in a substantial way from the
Ehrhart counting function LP(t). Namely, suppose P is a d-polytope that can
be written as the union of the polytopes P1 and P2 such that dim (P1 ∩P2) <
d, that is, P1 and P2 are glued along a lower-dimensional subset. Then at each
lattice point m ∈Zd, ωP1(m) + ωP2(m) = ωP(m), and so the function AP
has an additive property:
AP(t) = AP1(t) + AP2(t) .
(11.1)
In contrast, the Ehrhart counting functions satisfy
LP(t) = LP1(t) + LP2(t) −LP1∩P2(t) .
On the other hand, we can transfer computational eﬀort from the Ehrhart
counting functions to the solid-angle sum and vice versa, with the use of the
following lemma.
Lemma 11.2. Let P be a polytope. Then
AP(t) =
X
F⊆P
ωP(F) LF◦(t) .
Proof. The dilated polytope tP is the disjoint union of its relative open faces
tF◦, so that we can write
AP(t) =
X
m∈Zd
ωtP(m) =
X
F⊆P
X
m∈Zd
ωtP(m) 1tF◦(m) .
But ωtP(m) is constant on each relatively open face tF◦, and we called this
constant ωP(F), whence
AP(t) =
X
F⊆P
ωP(F)
X
m∈Zd
1tF◦(m) =
X
F⊆P
ωP(F) LF◦(t) .
⊓⊔
Thus AP(t) is a polynomial (respectively quasipolynomial) in t for an
integral (respectively rational) polytope P. We claim that Lemma 11.2 is in
fact useful in practice. To drive the point home, we illustrate this identity by
computing the solid-angle sum over all integer points of ∆in Example 11.1.

182
11 Solid Angles
Example 11.3. We continue the solid-angle computation for the 3-simplex
∆= conv {(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)}. We recall from Section 2.3 that
L∆◦=
 t−1
3

. The facets of ∆are three standard triangles and one triangle
that appeared in the context of the Frobenius problem. All four facets have
the same interior Ehrhart polynomial
 t−1
2

. A similar phenomenon holds for
the edges of ∆: all six of them have the same interior Ehrhart polynomial
t −1. These polynomials add up, by Lemma 11.2 and Example 11.1, to the
solid-angle sum
A∆(t) =

The magic cancellation of the even terms of this polynomial is not a coinci-
dence, as we will discover in Theorem 11.7. The curious reader may notice
that the coeﬃcient of t in this example is not a rational number, in stark
contrast with Ehrhart polynomials.
⊓⊔
The analogue of Ehrhart’s theorem (Theorem 3.23) in the world of solid
angles is as follows.
Theorem 11.4 (Macdonald’s theorem). Suppose P is a rational convex
d-polytope. Then AP is a quasipolynomial of degree d whose leading coeﬃcient
is vol P and whose period divides the denominator of P.
Proof. The denominator of a face F ⊂P divides the denominator of P, and
hence so does the period of LF, by Ehrhart’s theorem (Theorem 3.23). By
Lemma 11.2, AP is a quasipolynomial with period dividing the denominator
of P. The leading term of AP equals the leading term of LP◦, which is vol P,
by Corollary 3.20 and its extension in Exercise 3.29.
⊓⊔
11.2 Solid-Angle Generating Functions
and a Brion-Type Theorem
By analogy with the integer-point transform of a polyhedron P ⊆Rd, which
lists all lattice points in P, we form the solid-angle generating function
αP(z) :=
X
m∈P∩Zd
ωP(m) zm.
Using the same reasoning as in (11.1) for AP, this function satisﬁes a nice
additivity relation. Namely, if the d-polyhedron P equals P1 ∪P2, where
dim (P1 ∩P2) < d, then

11.2 Solid-Angle Generating Functions and a Brion-Type Theorem
183
αP(z) = αP1(z) + αP2(z) .
(11.2)
This generating function obeys the following reciprocity relation, which par-
allels both the statement and proof of Theorem 4.3:
Theorem 11.5. Suppose K is a rational pointed d-cone K with the origin as
apex, and v ∈Rd. Then the solid-angle generating function αv+K(z) of the
pointed d-cone v + K is a rational function that satisﬁes
αv+K
1
z

= (−1)dα−v+K (z) .
Proof. Because solid angles are additive by (11.2), it suﬃces to prove this the-
orem for simplicial cones. The proof for this case proceeds along the same lines
as the proof of Theorem 4.2; the main geometric ingredient is Exercise 4.2.
We invite the reader to ﬁnish the proof (Exercise 11.4).
⊓⊔
The analogue of Brion’s theorem in terms of solid angles is as follows.
Theorem 11.6. Suppose P is a rational convex polytope. Then we have the
following identity of rational functions:
αP(z) =
X
v a vertex of P
αKv(z) .
Proof. As in the proof of Theorem 9.7, it suﬃces to prove Theorem 11.6 for
simplices. So let ∆be a rational simplex. We write ∆as the disjoint union of
its open faces and use Brion’s theorem for open polytopes (Exercise 9.7) on
each face. That is, if we denote the vertex cone of F at vertex v by Kv(F),
then by a monomial version of Lemma 11.2,
α∆(z) =
X
F⊆∆
ω∆(F) σF◦(z)
=
X
v a vertex of ∆
ω∆(v) zv +
X
F⊆∆
dim F>0
ω∆(F)
X
v a vertex of F
σKv(F)◦(z) ,
where we used Brion’s theorem for open polytopes (Exercise 9.7) in the second
step. By Exercise 11.5,
X
F⊆∆
dim F>0
ω∆(F)
X
v a vertex of F
σKv(F)◦(z) =

and so
α∆(z) =

11 Solid Angles
11.3 Solid-Angle Reciprocity and the Brianchon–Gram
Relations
With the help of Theorems 11.5 and 11.6, we can now prove the solid-angle
analogue of Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity (Theorem 4.1):
Theorem 11.7 (Macdonald’s reciprocity theorem). Suppose P is a ra-
tional convex polytope. Then the quasipolynomial AP satisﬁes
AP(−t) = (−1)dim PAP(t) .
Proof. We give the proof for an integral polytope P and invite the reader to
generalize it to the rational case. The solid-angle counting function of P can
be computed through the generating function:
AP(t) = αtP(1, 1, . . . , 1) = lim
z→1 αtP(z) .
By Theorem 11.6,
AP(t) = lim
z→1
X
v a vertex of P
αtKv(z) ,
where Kv is the tangent cone of P at the vertex v. We write Kv = v + K(v),
where K(v) := Kv −v is a rational cone with the origin as its apex. Then
tKv = tv + K(v) because a cone whose apex is the origin does not change
under dilation. Hence we obtain, with the help of Exercise 11.3,
AP(t) = lim
z→1
X
v a vertex of P
αtv+K(v)(z) = lim
z→1
X
v a vertex of P
ztvαK(v)(z) .
The rational functions αK(v)(z) on the right-hand side do not depend on t. If
we think of the sum over all vertices as one big rational function, to which we
apply L’Hˆopital’s rule to compute the limit as z →1, this gives an alternative
proof that AP(t) is a polynomial, in line with our proof for the polynomiality
of LP(t) in Section 9.4. At the same time, this means we can view the identity
AP(t) = lim
z→1
X
v a vertex of P
ztvαK(v)(z)
in a purely algebraic fashion: on the left-hand side we have a polynomial that
makes sense for any complex t, and on the right-hand side we have a rational
function of z, whose limit we compute, for example, by L’Hˆopital’s rule. So
the right-hand side, as a function of t, makes sense for any integer t. Hence
we have the algebraic relation, for integral t,
AP(−t) = lim
z→1
X
v a vertex of P
z−tvαK(v)(z) .

11.3 Solid-Angle Reciprocity and the Brianchon–Gram Relations
185
But now by Theorem 11.5, αK(v)(z) = (−1)dαK(v)
  1

, and so
AP(−t) = lim
z→1

1
z

= (−1)d lim
z→1 αtP
1
z

= (−1)dAP(t) .
In the third step we used Exercise 11.3 again.
This proves Theorem 11.7 for integral polytopes. The proof for rational
polytopes follows along the same lines; one deals with rational vertices in the
same manner as in our second proof of Ehrhart’s theorem in Section 9.4. We
invite the reader to ﬁnish the details in Exercise 11.6.
⊓⊔
We remark that throughout the proof, we cannot simply take the limit
inside the ﬁnite sum over the vertices of P, since z = 1 is a pole of each rational
function αK(v). It is precisely the magic of Brion’s theorem that makes these
poles cancel each other, to yield AP(t).
If P is an integral polytope, then AP is a polynomial, and Theorem 11.7
tells us that AP is always even or odd:
AP(t) = cd td + cd−2td−2 + · · · + c0 .
We can say more.
Theorem 11.8. Suppose P is a rational convex polytope. Then AP(0) = 0.
This is a meaningful zero. We note that the constant term of AP is given by
AP(0) =
X
F⊆P
ωP(F) LF◦(0) =
X
F⊆P
ωP(F) (−1)dim F,
by Lemma 11.2 and Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity (Theorem 4.1). Hence
Theorem 11.8 implies a classical and useful geometric identity:
Corollary 11.9 (Brianchon–Gram relation). For a rational convex poly-
tope P,
X
F⊆P
(−1)dim FωP(F) = 0 .

186
11 Solid Angles
Example 11.10. Consider a triangle T in R2 with vertices v1, v2, v3 and
edges E1, E2, E3. The Brianchon–Gram relation tells us that for this triangle,
ωT (v1) + ωT (v2) + ωT (v3) −(ωT (E1) + ωT (E2) + ωT (E3)) + ωT (T ) = 0 .
Since the solid angles of the edges are all
1
2 and ωT (T ) = 1, we recover
our friendly high-school identity “the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180
degrees”:
ωT (v1) + ωT (v2) + ωT (v3) = 1
2 .
Thus the Brianchon–Gram relation is the extension of this well-known fact to
any dimension and any convex polytope.
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 11.8. It suﬃces to prove A∆(0) = 0 for a rational simplex
∆, since solid angles of a triangulation simply add, by (11.1). Theorem 11.7
gives A∆(0) = 0 if dim ∆is odd.
So now suppose ∆is a rational d-simplex, where d is even, with vertices
v1, v2, . . . , vd+1. Let P(n) be the (d + 1)-dimensional pyramid that we obtain
by taking the convex hull of (v1, 0) , (v2, 0) , . . . , (vd+1, 0), and (0, 0, . . . , 0, n),
where n is a positive integer (see Figure 11.1). Note that, since d + 1 is odd,

AP(n)(0) =
X
F(n)⊆P(n)
(−1)dim F(n)ωP(n)(F(n)) = 0 .
We will conclude from this identity that P
F⊆∆(−1)dim Fω∆(F) = 0, which
implies that A∆(0) = 0. To this end, we consider two types of faces of P(n):
(a) those that are also faces of ∆, and

11.3 Solid-Angle Reciprocity and the Brianchon–Gram Relations
187
(b) those that are not contained in ∆.
We start with the latter: Aside from the vertex (0, 0, . . . , 0, n), every face F(n)
of P(n) that is not a face of ∆is the pyramid over a face G of ∆; let’s denote
this pyramid by Pyr (G, n). Further, as n grows, the solid angle of Pyr (G, n)
(in P(n)) approaches the solid angle of G (in ∆):
lim
n→∞ωP(n) (Pyr (G, n)) = ω∆(G) ,
since we’re forming ∆×[0, ∞) in the limit. On the other hand, a face F(n) = G
of P(n) that is also a face of ∆obeys the following limit behavior:
lim
n→∞ωP(n) (F(n)) = 1
2 ω∆(G) .
The only face of P(n) that we still have to account for is the vertex v :=
(0, 0, . . . , 0, n). Hence
0 =
X
F(n)⊆P(n)
(−1)dim F(n)ωP(n)(F(n))
= ωP(n)(v) +
X
G⊆∆
(−1)dim G+1ωP(n) (Pyr (G, n))
+
X
G⊆∆
(−1)dim GωP(n) (G) .
Now we take the limit as n →∞on both sides; note that limn→∞ωP(n)(v) =
0, so that we obtain
0 =
X
G⊆∆
(−1)dim G+1ω∆(G) +
X
G⊆∆
(−1)dim G 1
2 ω∆(G)
= 1
2
X
G⊆∆
(−1)dim G+1ω∆(G) ,
and so
A∆(0) =
X
G⊆∆
(−1)dim Gω∆(G) = 0 .
⊓⊔
The combination of Theorems 11.7 and 11.8 implies that summing solid
angles in a polygon is equivalent to computing its area:
Corollary 11.11. Suppose P is a 2-dimensional integral polytope with area
A. Then AP(t) = A t2.

11 Solid Angles
11.4 The Generating Function of Macdonald’s
Solid-Angle Polynomials
We conclude this chapter with the study of the solid-angle analogue of Ehrhart
series. Given an integral polytope P, we deﬁne the solid-angle series of P as
the generating function of the solid-angle polynomial, encoding the solid-angle
sum over all dilates of P simultaneously:
SolidP(z) :=
X
t≥0
AP(t) zt.
The following theorem is the solid-angle analogue to Theorems 3.12 and 4.4,
with the added bonus that we get the palindromy of the numerator of SolidP
for free.
Theorem 11.12. Suppose P is an integral d-polytope. Then SolidP is a ra-
tional function of the form
SolidP(z) = adzd + ad−1zd−1 + · · · + a1z
(1 −z)d+1
.
Furthermore, we have the identity
SolidP
1
z

= (−1)d+1 SolidP(z)
or, equivalently, ak = ad+1−k for 1 ≤k ≤d
2.
Proof. The form of the rational function SolidP follows by Lemma 3.9 from
the fact that AP is a polynomial. The palindromy of a1, a2, . . . , ad is equivalent
to the relation
SolidP
1
z

= (−1)d+1 SolidP(z) ,
which, in turn, follows from Theorem 11.7:
SolidP(z) =
X
t≥0
AP(t) zt =
X
t≥0
(−1)dAP(−t) zt = (−1)d X
t≤0
AP(t) z−t.
Now we use Exercise 4.5:
(−1)d X
t≤0
AP(t) z−t = (−1)d+1 X
t≥1
AP(t) z−t = (−1)d+1 SolidP
1
z

.
In the last step we used the fact that AP(0) = 0 (Theorem 11.8).

Notes
1. I. G. Macdonald inaugurated the systematic study of solid-angle sums in
integral polytopes. The fundamental Theorems 11.4, 11.7, and 11.8 can be
found in his 1971 paper [123]. The proof of Theorem 11.7 we give here follows
[26].
2. The Brianchon–Gram relation (Corollary 11.9) is the solid-angle analogue
of the Euler relation for face numbers (Theorem 5.2). The 2-dimensional case
discussed in Example 11.10 is ancient; it was most certainly known to Euclid.
The 3-dimensional case of Corollary 11.9 was discovered by Charles Julien
Brianchon in 1837 and—as far as we know—was independently reproved by
Jørgen Gram in 1874 [88]. It is not clear who ﬁrst proved the general d-
dimensional case of Corollary 11.9. The oldest proofs we could ﬁnd were from
the 1960s, by Branko Gr¨unbaum [90], Micha A. Perles, and Geoﬀrey C. Shep-
hard [142, 162].
3. Theorem 11.5 is a particular case of a reciprocity relation for simple lattice-
invariant valuations due to Peter McMullen [128], who also proved a parallel
extension of Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity to general lattice-invariant val-
uations. There is a current resurgence of activity on solid angles; see, for
example, [52].

A Discrete Version of Green’s Theorem
Using Elliptic Functions
The shortest route between two truths in the real domain passes through the complex
domain.
Jacques Salomon Hadamard (1865–1963)
We now allow ourselves the luxury of using basic complex analysis. In par-
ticular, we assume that the reader is familiar with contour integration and
the residue theorem. We may view the residue theorem as yet another re-
sult that intimately connects the continuous and the discrete: it transforms a
continuous integral into a discrete sum of residues.
Using the Weierstraß ℘and ζ functions, we show here that Pick’s theorem
is a discrete version of Green’s theorem in the plane. As a bonus, we also
obtain an integral formula (Theorem 12.5 below) for the discrepancy between
the area enclosed by a general curve C and the number of integer points
contained in C.
12.1 The Residue Theorem
We begin this chapter by reviewing a few concepts from complex analysis.
Suppose the complex-valued function f has an isolated singularity w ∈G;
that is, there is an open set G ⊂C such that f is analytic on G \ {w}. Then
f can be expressed locally by the Laurent series
f(z) =
X
n∈Z
cn (z −w)n ,
valid for all z ∈G; here cn ∈C. The coeﬃcient c−1 is called the residue of f
at w; we will denote it by Res(z = w). The reason to give c−1 a special name
can be found in the following theorem. We call a function meromorphic if
it is analytic in C with the exception of isolated poles.

192
12 A Discrete Version of Green’s Theorem Using Elliptic Functions
Theorem 12.1 (Residue theorem). Suppose f is meromorphic and C is
a positively oriented, piecewise diﬀerentiable, simple, closed curve that does
not pass through any pole of f. Then
Z
C
f = 2πi
X
w
Res(z = w) ,
where the sum is taken over all singularities w inside C.
⊓⊔
If f is a rational function, Theorem 12.1 gives the same result as the
partial fraction expansion of f. We illustrate this philosophy by returning to
the elementary beginnings of Chapter 1.
Example 12.2. Recall our constant-term identity for the restricted partition
function for A = {a1, a2, . . . , ad} in Chapter 1:
pA(n) = const

1
(1 −za1) (1 −za2) · · · (1 −zad) zn

.
Computing the constant term of the Laurent series of
1
(1−za1)···(1−zad)zn ex-
panded about z = 0 is, naturally, equivalent to “shifting” this function by one
exponent and computing the residue at z = 0 of the function
f(z) :=
1
(1 −za1) (1 −za2) · · · (1 −zad) zn+1 .
Now let Cr be a positively oriented circle of radius r > 1, centered at the
origin. The residue Res(z = 0) = pA(n) is one of the residues that are picked
up by the integral
1
2πi
Z
Cr
f = Res(z = 0) +
X

Res(z = w) ,
where the sum is over all nonzero poles w of f that lie inside Cr. These
poles are at the ath
1 , ath
2 , . . . , ath

roots of unity. Moreover, with the help of
Exercise 12.1 we can show that

Res(z = w) .

12.2 The Weierstraß ℘and ζ Functions
193
To obtain the restricted partition function pA, it remains to compute the
residues at the roots of unity, and we invite the reader to realize that this
computation is equivalent to the partial fraction expansion of Chapter 1 (Ex-
ercise 12.2).
⊓⊔
Analogous residue computations could replace any of the constant-term
calculations that we performed in the earlier chapters.
12.2 The Weierstraß ℘and ζ Functions
The main character in our play is the Weierstraß ζ-function, deﬁned by
ζ(z) = 1
z +
X
(m,n)∈Z2\(0,0)
 
1
z −(m + ni) +
1
m + ni +
z
(m + ni)2
!
.
(12.1)
This inﬁnite sum converges absolutely for z belonging to compact subsets of
the lattice-punctured plane C \ Z2 (Exercise 12.4), and hence forms a mero-
morphic function of z.
The Weierstraß ζ-function possesses the following salient properties, which
follow immediately from (12.1):
(1) ζ has a simple pole at every integer point m+ni and is analytic elsewhere.
(2) The residue of ζ at each integer point m + ni equals 1.
We can easily check (Exercise 12.5) that
℘(z) := −ζ′(z) =
1
z2 +
X
(m,n)∈Z2\(0,0)
 
1
(z −(m + ni))2 −
1
(m + ni)2
!
,
(12.2)
the Weierstraß ℘-function. The ℘-function has a pole of order 2 at each
integer point m+ni and is analytic elsewhere, but has residue equal to zero at
each integer point m+ni. However, ℘possesses a very pleasant property that
ζ does not: ℘is doubly periodic on C. We may state this more concretely:
Lemma 12.3. ℘(z + 1) = ℘(z + i) = ℘(z) .
Proof. We ﬁrst invite the reader to prove the following two properties of ℘′
(Exercises 12.6 and 12.7):
℘′ (z + 1) = ℘′(z) ,
(12.3)
Z z1
z0
℘′ (z) dz is path independent.
(12.4)
By (12.3),
d
dz (℘(z + 1) −℘(z)) = ℘′ (z + 1) −℘′(z) = 0 ,

194
12 A Discrete Version of Green’s Theorem Using Elliptic Functions
so ℘(z + 1) −℘(z) = c for some constant c. On the other hand, ℘is an even
function (Exercise 12.8), and so z = −1
2 gives us
c = ℘

= 0 .
This shows that ℘(z + 1) = ℘(z) for all z ∈C\Z2. An analogous proof, which
we invite the reader to construct in Exercise 12.9, shows that ℘(z + i) = ℘(z).
⊓⊔
Lemma 12.3 implies that ℘(z + m + ni) = ℘(z) for all m, n ∈Z. The
following lemma shows that the Weierstraß ζ-function is only a conjugate-
analytic term away from being doubly periodic.
Lemma 12.4. There is a constant α such that the function ζ(z)+αz is doubly
periodic with periods 1 and i.
Proof. We begin with w = m + ni:
ζ (z + m + ni) −ζ(z) = −
Z m+ni
w=0
℘(z + w) dw ,
(12.5)
by deﬁnition of ℘(z) = −ζ′(z). To make sure that (12.5) makes sense, we
should also check that the deﬁnite integral in (12.5) is path independent (Ex-
ercise 12.10).
Due to the double periodicity of ℘,
Z m+ni
w=0
℘(z + w) dw = m
Z 1
0
℘(z + t) dt + ni
Z 1
0
℘(z + it) dt
:= mα(z) + niβ(z) ,
where
α(z) :=
Z 1
0
℘(z + t) dt
and
β(z) :=
Z 1
0
℘(z + it) dt .
Now we observe that α (z + x0) = α(z) for any x0 ∈R, so that α (x + iy)
depends only on y. Similarly, β (x + iy) depends only on x. But
ζ (z + m + in) −ζ(z) = −(mα(y) + inβ(x))
must be analytic for all z ∈C \ Z2. If we now set m = 0, we conclude that
β(x) must be analytic in C \ Z2, so that β(x) must be a constant by the
Cauchy–Riemann equations for analytic functions. Similarly, setting n = 0
implies that α(y) is constant. Thus
ζ (z + m + in) −ζ(z) = −(mα + inβ)
with constants α and β. Going back to the Weierstraß ℘-function, we can
integrate the identity (Exercise 12.11)

12.3 A Contour-Integral Extension of Pick’s Theorem

℘(iz) = −℘(z)

β =

To summarize, we have

 z + m + in −z

so that ζ(z) + αz is doubly periodic.
⊓⊔
12.3 A Contour-Integral Extension of Pick’s Theorem
For the remainder of this chapter, let C be any piecewise-diﬀerentiable, simple,
closed curve in the plane, with a counterclockwise parametrization. We let D
denote the region that C contains in its interior.
Theorem 12.5. Let C avoid any integer point, that is, C ∩Z2 = ∅. Let I
denote the number of integer points interior to C, and A the area of the region
D enclosed by the curve C. Then

(ζ(z) −πz) dz = I −A .
Proof. We have

By Theorem 12.1,

C ζ(z) dz is equal to the sum of the residues of ζ at all of
its interior poles. There are I such poles, and each pole of ζ has residue 1.
Thus

ζ(z) dz = I .
(12.7)
On the other hand, Green’s theorem tells us that

Going back to (12.7), we get
Z
C
(ζ(z) + αz) dz = 2πiI + α (2iA) .
(12.8)
We only have to show that α = −π. Consider the particular curve C that is
a square path, centered at the origin, traversing the origin counterclockwise,
and bounding a square of area 1. Thus I = 1 for this path. Since ζ(z) + αz
is doubly periodic by Lemma 12.4, the integral in (12.8) vanishes. We can
conclude that
0 = 2πi · 1 + α (2i · 1) ,
so that α = −π.
⊓⊔
Notice that Theorem 12.5 has given us information about the Weierstraß
ζ-function, namely that α = −π.
This chapter oﬀers a detour into an inﬁnite landscape of discrete results
that meet their continuous counterparts. Equipped with the modest tools
oﬀered in this book, we hope we have motivated the reader to explore this
landscape further. . .
Notes
1. The Weierstraß ℘-function, named after Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weier-
straß (1815–1897),1 can be extended to any two-dimensional lattice L =
{kw1 + jw2 : k, j ∈Z} for some w1, w2 ∈C that are linearly independent
over R:

The Weierstraß ℘L-function and its derivative ℘′
L satisfy a polynomial rela-
tionship, namely, (℘′
L)2 = 4 (℘L)3 −g2 ℘L −g3 for some constants g2 and g3
that depend on L. This is the beginning of a wonderful friendship between
complex analysis and elliptic curves.
2. Theorem 12.5 appeared in [75]. There it is also shown that one can retrieve
Pick’s theorem (Theorem 2.8) from Theorem 12.5.

A
Vertex and Hyperplane Descriptions
of Polytopes
Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.
Albert Einstein
In this appendix, we prove that every polytope has a vertex and a hyperplane
description. This appendix owes everything to G¨unter Ziegler’s beautiful ex-
position in [193]; in fact, these pages contain merely a few cherries picked from
[193, Lecture 1].
As in Chapter 3, it is easier to move to the world of cones. To be as concrete
as possible, let us call K ⊆Rd an h-cone if
K =

x ∈Rd : A x ≤0
	
for some A ∈Rm×d; in this case K is given as the intersection of m halfspaces
determined by the rows of A. We use the notation K = hcone(A).
On the other hand, we call K ⊆Rd a v-cone if
K = {B y : y ≥0}
for some B ∈Rd×n, that is, K is a pointed cone with the column vectors of
B as generators. In this case we use the notation K = vcone(B).
Note that, according to our deﬁnitions, any h- or v-cone contains the origin
in its apex. We will prove that every h-cone is a v-cone and vice versa. More
precisely:
Theorem A.1. For every A ∈Rm×d there exists B ∈Rd×n (for some n)
such that hcone(A) = vcone(B). Conversely, for every B ∈Rd×n there exists
A ∈Rm×d (for some m) such that vcone(B) = hcone(A).
We will prove the two halves of Theorem A.1 in Sections A.1 and A.2. For
now, let us record that Theorem A.1 implies our goal, that is, the equivalence
of the vertex and halfspace description of a polytope:

200
Appendix A: Vertex and Hyperplane Descriptions of Polytopes
Corollary A.2. If P is the convex hull of ﬁnitely many points in Rd, then P
is the intersection of ﬁnitely many half spaces in Rd. Conversely, if P is given
as the bounded intersection of ﬁnitely many half spaces in Rd, then P is the
convex hull of ﬁnitely many points in Rd.
Proof. If P = conv {v1, v2, . . . , vn} for some v1, v2, . . . , vn ∈Rd, then coning
over P (as deﬁned in Chapter 3) gives
cone(P) = vcone

v1 v2 . . . vn


.
By Theorem A.1 we can ﬁnd a matrix (A, b) ∈Rm×(d+1) such that
cone(P) = hcone(A, b) =

x ∈Rd+1 : (A, b) x ≤0
	
.
We recover the polytope P upon setting xd+1 = 1, that is,
P =

x ∈Rd : Ax ≤−b
	
,
which is a hyperplane description of P.
These steps can be reversed: Suppose the polytope P is given as
P =

x ∈Rd : Ax ≤−b
	
for some A ∈Rm×d and b ∈Rm. Then P can be obtained from
hcone(A, b) =

x ∈Rd+1 : (A, b) x ≤0
	
by setting xd+1 = 1. By Theorem A.1 we can construct a matrix B ∈R(d+1)×n
such that
hcone(A, b) = vcone(B) .
We may normalize the generators of vcone(B), that is, the columns of B, such
that they all have (d + 1)st variable equal to one:
B =
 v1 v2 . . . vn
1
1
1

.
Since P can be recovered from vcone(B) by setting xd+1 = 1, we conclude
that P = conv {v1, v2, . . . , vn}.
⊓⊔
A.1 Every h-cone is a v-cone
Suppose
K = hcone(A) =

The ﬁrst half of Theorem A.1 follows with these two lemmas, as we can start
with (A.1) and intersect with one hyperplane yk = 0 at a time.

⊓⊔
Proof of Lemma A.4. Suppose K = vcone(B), where B has the column vec-
tors b1, b2, . . . , bn ∈Rd; that is, b1, b2, . . . , bn are the generators of K. Fix
k ≤d and construct a new matrix Bk whose column vectors are all bj for
which bjk = 0, and the combinations bikbj −bjkbi whenever bik > 0 and
bjk < 0. We claim that
K ∩

x ∈Rd : xk = 0
	
= vcone (Bk) .
Every x ∈vcone (Bk) satisﬁes xk = 0 by construction of Bk, and so
vcone (Bk) ⊆K∩

x ∈Rd : xk = 0
	
follows immediately. We need to do some
more work to prove the reverse containment.

allows us to deﬁne
Λ =

Note that Λ ≥0. Now consider the decomposition
x =

λjbj .
(A.2)
If Λ = 0 then λibik = 0 for all i such that bik > 0, and so λi = 0 for these i.
Similarly, λj = 0 for all j such that bjk < 0. Thus we conclude from Λ = 0
that
x =
X
j: bjk=0
λjbj ∈vcone (Bk) .
Now assume Λ > 0. Then we can expand the decomposition (A.2) into

A.2 Every v-cone is an h-cone
Suppose
K = vcone(B) = {B y : y ≥0}
for some B ∈Rd×n. Then K is the projection of

. The constraints for (A.3) can be writ-
ten as

and


= 0 .
Thus the set (A.3) is an h-cone, for which we can project one component of
y at a time to obtain K. This means that it suﬃces to prove the following
lemma to ﬁnish the second half of Theorem A.1.

A.2 Every v-cone is an h-cone
203
Lemma A.5. If K is an h-cone, then the projection {x −xkek : x ∈K} is
also an h-cone, for any k.
Proof. Suppose K = hcone(A) for some A ∈Rm×d. Fix k and consider
Pk = {x + λek : x ∈K, λ ∈R} .
The projection we’re after can be constructed from this set as
{x −xkek : x ∈K} = Pk ∩

x ∈Rd : xk = 0
	
,
so that it suﬃces to prove that Pk is an h-cone.
Suppose a1, a2, . . . , am are the row vectors of A. We construct a new ma-
trix Ak whose row vectors are all aj for which ajk = 0, and the combinations
aikaj −ajkai whenever aik > 0 and ajk < 0. We claim that Pk = hcone (Ak).
If x ∈K then A x ≤0, which implies Ak x ≤0 because each row of Ak is
a nonnegative linear combination of rows of A; that is, K ⊆hcone (Ak). How-
ever, the kth component of Ak is zero by construction, and so K ⊆hcone (Ak)
implies Pk ⊆hcone (Ak).
Conversely, suppose x ∈hcone (Ak). We need to ﬁnd a λ ∈R such that
A (x −λek) ≤0, that is,
a11x1 + · · · + a1k (xk −λ) + · · · + a1dxd ≤0
...
am1x1 + · · · + amk (xk −λ) + · · · + amdxd ≤0 .
The jth constraint is aj · x −ajkλ ≤0, that is, aj · x ≤ajkλ. This gives the
following conditions on λ:
λ ≥ai · x
aik
if aik > 0 ,
λ ≤aj · x
ajk
if ajk < 0 .
Such a λ exists because if aik > 0 and ajk < 0 then (since x ∈hcone (Ak))
(aikaj −ajkai) · x ≤0 ,
which is equivalent to
ai · x
aik
≤aj · x
ajk
.
Thus we can ﬁnd a λ that satisﬁes
ai · x
aik
≤λ ≤aj · x
ajk
,
which proves hcone (Ak) ⊆Pk.

Triangulations of Polytopes
Obvious is the most dangerous word in mathematics.
Eric Temple Bell
The goal of this appendix is to prove Theorem 3.1. Recall that a triangula-
tion of a convex d-polytope P is a ﬁnite collection T of d-simplices with the
following properties:
•
P =
[
∆∈T
∆.
•
For any ∆1, ∆2 ∈T, ∆1 ∩∆2 is a face common to both ∆1 and ∆2.
Theorem 3.1 says that P can be triangulated using no new vertices, that is,
there exists a triangulation T such that the vertices of any ∆∈T are vertices
of P. In preparation, we ﬁrst show that a triangulation of a polytope induces
a triangulation on any of its facets in a natural way.
Lemma B.1. Suppose T(P) is a triangulation of the d-polytope P, and F is
a facet of P. Then
T(F) := {S ∩F : S ∈T(P), dim (S ∩F) = d −1}
is a triangulation of F.
Proof. To avoid unnecessary notation, we write S T(F) for S
∆∈T (F) ∆. We
have to show:
(i) F = S T(F) .
(ii) For any ∆1, ∆2 ∈T(F), ∆1 ∩∆2 is a face common to both ∆1 and ∆2.
(i) First, S T(F) ⊆F by deﬁnition of T(F). Now we will show that F \
S T(F) = ∅, by means of contradiction. Let x ∈F \ S T(F). If there is a
neighborhood N of x in F that contains no points of S T(F), then N consists

206

only of points contained in some simplices from T(P) that meet F in a set of
dimension less than d −1, which is impossible since dim N = d −1 and there
are only ﬁnitely many simplices in T(P). Hence any neighborhood of x in F
contains points in some ∆∈T(F). However, S T(F) is closed, and so such
an x cannot exist. Hence F \ S T(F) = ∅.
(ii) Given ∆1, ∆2 ∈T(F), there are S1, S2 ∈T(P) such that
∆1 = S1 ∩F
and
∆2 = S2 ∩F
and the intersections of both S1 and S2 with F are (d −1)-dimensional. Now
∆1 ∩∆2 = S1 ∩S2 ∩F, and since S1, S2 ∈T(P), S1 ∩S2 is a face of both S1
and S2. That is, there are hyperplanes H1 and H2 in Rd such that
S1 ∩S2 = S1 ∩H1
and
S1 ∩S2 = S2 ∩H2 .
The (d −1)-hyperplanes H1, H2 in Rd induce the (d −2)-hyperplanes
h1 := H1 ∩span F
and
h2 := H2 ∩span F
in span F. We claim that h1 ∩∆1 = ∆1 ∩∆2 = h2 ∩∆2, that is, ∆1 ∩∆2 is a
face of both ∆1 and ∆2. Indeed,
h1 ∩∆1 = h1 ∩(S1 ∩F)
= (H1 ∩span F) ∩(S1 ∩F)
= (H1 ∩S1) ∩(F ∩span F)
= (S1 ∩S2) ∩F
= ∆1 ∩∆2 ,
and a practically identical calculation gives h2 ∩∆2 = ∆1 ∩∆2 .
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 3.1. We use induction on the number of vertices of the d-
polytope P. If P has d + 1 vertices, then P is a simplex, and {P} is a trian-
gulation.
For the induction step, suppose we are given a d-polytope P with at least
d+2 vertices. Fix a vertex v of P such that Q, the convex hull of the remaining
vertices of P, is still of dimension d. By the induction hypothesis, we can
triangulate Q.
We call a facet F of Q visible from v if for any x ∈F, the half-open line
segment (x, v] is disjoint from Q. By the Lemma, the triangulation T(Q) of
Q induces the triangulation
T(F) = {∆∩F : ∆∈T(Q), dim (∆∩F) = d −1}
of a facet F of Q.
Let T consist of the convex hulls of v with each (d −1)-simplex in the tri-
angulations of the visible facets. We claim that T ∪T(Q) forms a triangulation
of P. To prove this, we have to show:

Appendix B: Triangulations of Polytopes
207
(i) P = S (T ∪T(Q)) .
(ii) For any ∆1, ∆2 ∈T ∪T(Q), ∆1 ∩∆2 is a face common to both ∆1
and ∆2.
(i) P ⊇S (T ∪T(Q)) follows by the deﬁnitions of T and T(Q). To prove
P ⊆S (T ∪T(Q)), assume x ∈P is given. If x ∈Q then x ∈S T(Q). If
x ∈P \Q, consider the line through v and x. This line meets Q (because P is
convex), so let y ∈Q be the ﬁrst point in Q that we meet when traveling along
the line towards Q. This point y is on a facet of Q that is, by construction,
visible from v, and hence x ∈∆for some ∆∈T.
(ii) Given ∆1, ∆2 ∈T ∪T(Q), there are three cases:
(a) ∆1, ∆2 ∈T(Q);
(b) ∆1, ∆2 ∈T;
(c) ∆1 ∈T, ∆2 ∈T(Q).
In each case we have to show that ∆1 ∩∆2 is a face common to ∆1 and ∆2.
(a) Since T(Q) is a triangulation, ∆1 ∩∆2 is a face of both ∆1 and ∆2.
(b) Given ∆1, ∆2 ∈T, there exist S1, S2 ∈T(F) such that ∆1 = conv {v, S1}
and ∆2 = conv {v, S2}. Since T(F) is a triangulation, S1∩S2 is a face common
to S1 and S2. By convexity, ∆1 ∩∆2 = conv {v, S1 ∩S2}. Exercise 2.6 shows
that S1 ∩S2 is a simplex, and that this simplex is the convex hull of some
of the common vertices of S1 and S2. But then ∆1 ∩∆2 = conv {v, S1 ∩S2}
is the convex hull of some of the common vertices of ∆1 and ∆2 and hence,
again by Exercise 2.6, a face of both ∆1 and ∆2.
(c) Since ∆1 ∈T, there exists S ∈T(F) such that ∆1 = conv {v, S}. By
construction, ∆1 ∩Q = S, and S is a face of some ∆∈T(Q). Since T(Q) is
a triangulation, ∆∩∆2 is a face common to ∆and ∆2. But then
∆1 ∩∆2 = S ∩∆2 = (S ∩∆) ∩∆2 = S ∩(∆∩∆2)
is an intersection of two faces of ∆and hence by Exercise 2.6 again a face of
∆and a simplex. The vertices of ∆1 ∩∆2 = S ∩(∆∩∆2) form a subset of
the vertices common to S and ∆2. Since S is a face of ∆1, ∆1 ∩∆2 is a face
of both ∆1 and ∆2, by Exercise 2.6.
