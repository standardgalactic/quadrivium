Black Suits – Language Modifiers 
 
 
So let’s do one more exercise here. I’ll give you some cards here, I’ll give you some cards 
there, some here. This time, we’re going to take just one of the black suits. So let me 
just talk a little bit about what these black suits do. 
 
They’re fundamentally different to the colored suits. The colored suits are about 
hypnotic language. At the most basic level it’s about flowing smoothly with ideas. If I 
interrupt ideas, I create barriers to understanding and each little barrier may be nothing 
on its own, but the more barriers are there, the harder it is for the ideas to be accepted. 
 
The smoother my ideas are, the fewer the barriers the smoother the road is shall we 
say, the more momentum you can build up so that ultimately so that even so called 
more difficult experiences will be easier to access. It’s really just an over simplified idea 
that describes how hypnotic language works. 
 
These black modifiers do something extra. On their own, they don’t do very much. 
They’re designed to go with your regular language to enhance their impact. So just as 
these (colored suits) enhance your communication generally, these (black suits) will 
enhance what these (colored suits) do. 
 
It’s like having a magnifying lens with another lens on top of that. That’s how a 
telescope works, or binoculars, they have two sets of lenses each one of which amplify 
what the other set has done. 
 
That’s what the modifiers do.
