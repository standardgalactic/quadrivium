Preface
The ﬁrst MCPC conference was hosted by Hong Kong University of Science and
Technology in 2001. Since then the MCPC conference has grown to become the
primary conference for presenting and discussing current issues and recent
developments within the ﬁelds of Mass Customization, Personalization, and
Customer Co-Creation. Since 2001, the conference has been hosted by University
of Technology Munich (2003), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
(2005), M.I.T. (2007), Aalto University (2009), and UC Berkeley (2011).
The 2014 MCPC conference, the seventh in the series, for which the contributions
are presented in this book, is hosted by Aalborg University.
The MCPC 2014 is a multi-track conference featuring a combination of high
proﬁle keynotes with expert talks, panel discussions, paper sessions, workshops,
receptions, and much more. While it is devoted to sharing and discussing the latest
research in the ﬁeld, the MCPC conference has a strong focus on real-life
applications. Since its beginning, the MCPC conference has had an equal share of
participants, practitioners, and academics/researchers. This makes the MCPC
conference truly unique among many conferences. It strives to connect MCPC
thinkers, ﬁrst movers, entrepreneurs, technology developers, and researchers with
people applying these strategies in practice.
Twenty years ago Mass Customization was acknowledged as the ‘‘New Frontier
in Business Competition’’. Ever since, the industry has been applying the concept
and researchers have developed the topic into a well-established research area and
businesses have formed new strategies. More knowledge, methods, and technol-
ogies are available now than ever before. Along with general Mass Customization
topics, this conference addresses Mass Customization from a historical perspec-
tive, looking at both mass customization in the past 20 years and toward the new
frontiers in the 20 years to come.
The MCPC 2014 conference wants to engage academics, business leaders, and
consultants in fundamental debates through a set of plenary presentations, work-
shops, discussion panels, and paper presentations. Continuing our tradition, we
invite contributions from a wide range of specialists. MCPC 2014 is looking
for contributions in cutting-edge research, as well as insightful advances into
industrial practice in key areas.

A Bonded Experience: ‘‘Value Creation
as the Creation of an Experience, Within
a Business Relationship’’
Ron J. A. Journée and Marcel E. A. Weber
Abstract In this paper, we investigate the application of the concepts of customer
experience (CX) and co-creation for SMEs in the B2B sector. Based on a sys-
tematic review of extant research on the subject of CX, we will recognize that
customer experience management (CXM) can be a new way for organizations to
create a competitive advantage, simultaneously creating more value for their
customers. We will introduce a conceptual framework for a better understanding
of the concept, identifying several elements that have to be taken into account in
CXM, i.e., the types, levels, and strengths of experience; the tacit and measurable
outcomes of a great CX for the ﬁrm; the methods to measure CX; the conditions to
execute CXM; the possibilities for CXM by the ﬁrm, such as the management of
experience providers and the application of the customer journey approach to gain
insights into customers’ experience; and, ﬁnally, the role that customers have in
CXM. With this latter element of our framework, we will be able to cross the
bridge from CX to customer co-creation, in particular the co-creation of experi-
ences in NPD. Reﬂecting these insights on SME practice will teach us what small-
and medium-sized enterprises can do to apply CXM. In that respect, we will
observe that research has not reached a sufﬁcient level of knowledge to aid ﬁrms in
achieving this goal. We intend to further investigate the application of CX con-
cepts in SME in ongoing studies.

1 Introduction
Customer co-creation has become an important and novel way for ﬁrms to practice
open innovation in creating new products and services (NPD/NSD) [1]. Co-cre-
ation is however not limited to NPD/NSD, but can be used to create new CXs as
well [2]. The concepts of value co-creation and experience management have
entered the domain of marketing management [3]. Traditional marketing views
customers as rational deciders with mainly attention for functional product prop-
erties and beneﬁts. Experiential marketing, on the other hand, perceives customers
as both rational and emotional beings that are looking for positive experiences [4].
Research in the past decade demonstrates that the traditional point of view has not
changed much, in spite of increasing customer satisfaction surveys. A satisﬁed
customer is not a guarantee for loyalty, extra turnover, or a larger market share. To
increase loyalty and customer advocacy, companies have to consider delivering a
positive CX. In order to provide a positive CX, it is also recommended to co-create
with customers [2]. Companies will proﬁt if this is done in a proper way.
In spite of these positive insights about CX, academic research on the subject of
CX in B2B SME is limited. CX seems to be an exclusive topic for practitioners in
practice-oriented literature, e.g., Shaw and Ivens [5]. These publications tend to
focus on the practical managerial aspects of CX, instead of developing and
researching theory on the antecedents and consequences of CX. For those cases
where theory has been developed, e.g., Schmitt [6], theory seems to be aimed on
large, multinational companies operating in the B2C. Academic research intended to
study the subject for the beneﬁt of the SME, particularly in the B2B, seems to lack.
In this paper, we try to start the debate on the advantages and disadvantages of
customer experience management (CXM) for the SME by providing an overview,
based on systematic research of the literature. In order to do this, we will ﬁrst
investigate the ontology of CX. Next, we develop a conceptual framework that
covers all important aspects of customer experience (CX) and co-creation in seven
interrelated elements, entailing constituents, moderators, outcomes and measure-
ments of CX and co-creation, as well as conditions, business interactions, and
customer actions to improve or create CX and co-creation. At this stage, we cross
the bridge from CX to customer co-creation. In the end, we will reﬂect on this
body of knowledge, contemplating on its use for the SME.
2 Ontology of (Customer) Experience
Experience is a main construct in the phenomenological philosophy [7]. The
phenomenology regards human beings as a subject that undergoes perceptions,
interpretations, and experiences, where experiences represent a more complex
concept than the meaning in ordinary language. Experience is the concrete exis-
tence of man ‘‘as being in the world’’ [7] and is essentially a matter of ‘‘meaning-
2
R. J. A. Journée and M. E. A. Weber

making’’ and thus a question to be addressed by interpretive approaches [8]. This
viewpoint has been adopted in social psychology as well, for instance, in the works
of Kurt Lewin who postulates that social behavior is determined by subjective
interpretations of events in the environment [9]. Experience is not tacit and con-
crete, but refers to the qualiﬁcation of one’s subjective perceptions and therefore
personal [10]. Experience can manifest itself in many ways, such as physical,
mental or thoughts, emotional, spiritual or religious, and even virtual [11].
The role and importance of experience in consumption and use of goods and
services was ﬁrst proposed by Holbrook and Hirschman [12], who introduced CX
as an addendum for the contemporary consumer behavior models that were mainly
based on rational behavior of consumers. Based on this insight, Schmitt advises
‘‘to treat consumers as living human beings with experiential needs rather than as
rational price- and attribute-driven information [6].’’ Consumers want to experi-
ence that their feeling, senses, and soul are being ‘‘touched’’ and are in search of
authentic and honest treatments by providers. Consumption is no longer a matter
for ‘‘customers’’ in the depersonalized sense, but holistic for individuals [6].
According to Pine and Gilmore [13], experiences occur when customers are being
involved in such a way that it provides a permanent and unforgettable impression.
The experience is memorable and personal, touching the customer on an emo-
tional, physical, intellectual, and even spiritual level [13].
3 Experiential Marketing: Customer Experience
in Marketing
As observed earlier, Holbrook and Hirschman ﬁrst introduced CX in marketing
science in 1982 as an expansion of the existing, rational behavior models with
experience aspects. It is in the late 1990s that more attention for the phenomenon is
given by scholars in publications, e.g., Pine and Gilmore [13], and Schmitt [14].
Pine and Gilmore were the ﬁrst in describing the inﬂuences of experience in terms
of the economic added value for customer and ﬁrm. They prophesized that, after
commodities, products, and, subsequently, services, experiences are the new eco-
nomic offering, with in the end, the transformation [15]. These publications were
the cause of a paradigm shift from organizations aiming to provide the best product
or service, to organizations that have the aspiration of providing what customers
experience as the most pleasant in their relation, which, aside from the moments of
consumption, consists of several moments of interaction between customer and
provider. Contact and interaction moments, or touch points, are crucial for the
experience the customer gets [5]. Most of these publications focused on creating a
hedonic CX, where fun, joy, and excitement are the emotions to be triggered.
Subjective experiences, however, do not only consist of hedonic elements. Expe-
riences can also entail irrational aspects, leading to irrational behavior [16].

3.1 Development of the Concept
Following Pine and Gilmore, more and more attention has been given to CXM as a
new paradigm in marketing theory in the past decade. CXM is now regarded as a
new lever to create value for customers as well as for companies [4, 5, 17–22]. CX
is the result of all interaction a customer has with a product or service provider.
With the advance of technological, socializing, and globalizing trends, com-
panies can get closer to their customers. Firms and customers nowadays focus on
collaboration in networks in order to respond quickly to changing needs and to
focus on what they are good at. In that respect, customers will look for more
meaningful experiences, so they can shape their own existence. In a society where
self-actualization and welfare become central, ﬁrms will have to focus on guiding
customers in achieving this by providing meaningful and memorable experiences
that create transformations in people’s lives. To facilitate this, ﬁrms need to create
a platform where customers and ﬁrms can jointly create a context for giving more
sense and meaning to one’s life [21]. The dialog between ﬁrm and individual
customer is the foundation for the co-creation of personalized value [23].
3.2 Current Status: Customer Experience Management
It is not surprising that CXM in marketing is gaining attention. CXM is proposed
as the new way to get insight into customers’ preferences and needs, which
inﬂuence behavior and loyalty [17]. Firms realize that relationship based on
experiences will aid in the attraction and retention of customers [13, 24]. CXM is
now regarded as a way to distinguish the ﬁrm from its competitors and to create
more value for customers and ﬁrms’ stakeholders; it has become essential to
survive in present competitive environments.
4 A Conceptual Framework for Customer Experience
Management
We have systematically reviewed the extant literature on CX and CXM, in order to
identify the necessary elements for our conceptual model. We refer to references
for an overview of the reviewed literature. The resulting framework is depicted in
Fig. 1.
Our ﬁrst observation is that CX consists of several constituents (box ‘‘Con-
stituents,’’ depending on the point of viewing at the concept, which can be clas-
siﬁed as types, levels, and strength of CX. Achieving a certain intended type, level,
and strength of CX can lead to desired outcomes (box ‘‘Outcomes’’) for the ﬁrm.
As we will see, these outcomes can also be classiﬁed in material or ﬁnancial
4
R. J. A. Journée and M. E. A. Weber

outcomes, and immaterial outcomes. To achieve the intended CX, companies can
take some actions (box ‘‘Business Interventions and Actions’’), both internal and
external, inﬂuence customer behavior (box ‘‘Customer Actions’’), but can also
depend on some external inﬂuences (box ‘‘Moderators’’). To complete the man-
agement cycle, so we can truly speak of CXM, companies need to measure the
realized CX (box ‘‘Measurement’’). We will now review each box or element of
our conceptual model referring to insights from CX and CXM literature in the
following subsections, where, at a certain point, we can also provide a deﬁnition
for CX.
4.1 Constituents of Customer Experience: A Taxonomy
According to Meyer and Schwager [25], experience is a personal and subjective
response that customers have in direct or indirect contact with an organization. As
has been argued before, CX does not only entail cognitive, functional, and rational
aspects of customer behavior, but the emotional and irrational aspects as well [4,
20]. Several scholars, e.g., Gentile et al. [17] and Schmitt [14], attempt to classify
the construct of CX in types. Schmitt [14] provides us with a comprehensive set of
types, for which we will use the anagram FASTR as taxonomy:
• Feel, referring to the emotions and feelings in the experience;
• Act, referring to physical experience and behavior;

• Sense, when it comes to the sensory experiences as smell, taste, sound, and
touch;
• Think for rational, intellectual, and cognitive experiences; and
• Relate, referring to social identity, relational experiences resulting from rela-
tions with a (peer) group, culture, or lifestyle.
Experience can also vary in strength; although both excited, two persons can
experience this excitement at a different intensity. The ultimate, superior experi-
ence is the so-called ‘‘ﬂow’’ [26]. CX is also no longer considered a mere hedonic
aspiration of customers, as proposed by several scholars [12, 18, 19].
Experience can be manifested at several levels of the contact [27], where there
is a distinction between brand level, transactional level, and relational level. Other
levels mentioned in the literature are the customer journey [28], the individual
interaction, and the total CX [28, 29]. We now propose the following classiﬁcation
for the levels of CX:
1. Interactional experience level, referring to the experience for each individual
interaction between organization and customer. This experience can vary in
strength, direction, and quality, depending on how the interaction is shaped and
executed. For example, a customer can be very pleased when buying a product
in the store, but the experience can turn into disappointment when he tries to
use the product.
2. Relational experience level, when it comes to the experience one gets from
interacting or communicating with certain individuals or departments of an
organization. We can start to like the shop attendant, while hating the customer
service whenever we call for help.
3. Channel or transactional experience level, where experience differences can
occur, depending on the channel in use. We can have a different experience
when buying something in the store compared to buying it online.
4. Customer journey experience level, which is a composition of the previous
three experience levels when it comes to the customer journey.
5. Brand or organizational experience level where it comes to the experience that
derives from contact with the virtual brand or organization. We can get a
pleasant feeling when seeing the logo of Apple or feeling good when we read
something about LEGO.
6. Total CX level, which covers the experience a certain person can get from all
his contacts and touch points with an organization in his life.
The CX starts at the ﬁrst contact and develops in strength, direction, and types
on all following interactions, touch points, communication, etc. So, the FASTR
components vary in time, depending on the type of interaction, but also shaping
and reshaping the total CX. In that way, we cannot speak of CX as a static entity.
CX is of a complex nature.
A deﬁnition for customer experience There is no consensus on the construct
of CX. Based on our previous elaboration, we can, however, try to provide a
deﬁnition for the concept, which we will use in our ongoing research.

Customer experience is a personal and subjective response that customers have on direct
or indirect contact with an organization, at several levels. By inﬂuencing this CX the
organization tries to evoke several kinds of perceptions to a customer: emotional, physical,
sensorial, rational en relational, where customers and the organization co-create unique,
meaningful experiences in order to achieve a proﬁtable, durable and affective relationship
that gives value to all stakeholders.
4.2 The Outcomes of Customer Experience (Management)
Creating the ideal CX and brand experience will have a positive effect on a
sustainable competitive advantage for the ﬁrm, reﬂected in long-term continuity
and survival [30]. CX also has a positive effect on customer satisfaction and
loyalty [6]. It has also been asserted that meaningful CXs create value for both
customers and organizations [17, 21]. Vargo and Lusch [31] suggest that value is
always unique and is determined by the beneﬁciary. In the sense that each indi-
vidual can get a different experience from the same stimulus, this means that the
valuation of a product or service can differ among customers. Value is, in that
respect, a similar concept as experience: highly personal and subjective.
Minckiewicz et al. [32] review the academic debate on the concept of value and
conclude that no consensus exists about the concept. They discover four different
approaches for ‘‘value’’ in the marketing literature: (1) value in exchange; (2)
value in use; (3) value in experience; and (4) value in context. Value in experience
seems to ﬁt the best in the CX philosophy and entails that the customer values a
product or service as a function of his experience. In a market of value-in-expe-
rience, the market becomes a platform for conversations and interactions between
customers, communities, and ﬁrms [21].
Summarizing, we can depict many possible outcomes from good CXs for the
ﬁrm in two categories, see Table 1.
4.3 Conditions for Customer Experience Management
A basic condition to build customer loyalty is market and customer orientation: an
external focus [33]. Market orientation leads to market- and customer-focused
strategies and higher levels of customer satisfaction, leading to loyalty and long-
lasting proﬁtability [34].
4.4 Moderators of Customer Experience
Every organization creates a CX as a response, positive, neutral or negative,
conscious or unconscious. The moments that experience becomes manifest are
called touch points. In general, these touch points refer to interactions between an
A Bonded Experience
7

organization (or brand) and all of its stakeholders, including customers, employ-
ees, suppliers, etc. [39]. The success depends on how effective the organization is
in CXM, but can also be inﬂuenced by other factors, which the organization cannot
control. Usually, other customers and external stakeholders, such as local com-
munity, media, action groups, government, and public opinion, are accountable for
this inﬂuence. The intensity of competition in the market is an important external
factor, which inﬂuences CX [24]. The higher the competitive intensity is, the
sooner that companies tend to look for a sustainable competitive advantage [17].
Organizations can try to inﬂuence the external factors, requiring speciﬁc actions
to accomplish this, which we will not elaborate on, except for those that are
identiﬁed as important moderators of CX.
Shaw [40] identiﬁes another important external factor: customers’ expectations.
Customers shape their expectations based on previous (life) experiences, including
‘‘traits’’, ‘‘life events’’, and other inﬂuences [40]. From these ‘‘pre-experiences’’,
customers develop attitudes that shape their expectations [41]. It is important for
organizations to know and manage these expectations and forthcoming needs of
their customers, since they inﬂuence the experience [42].
4.5 Measuring Customer Experience
Several studies [43] demonstrate that the CX the ﬁrm thinks it delivers is estimated
higher than what customers think. It is therefore necessary to measure CX in order
to evaluate the efﬁcacy of the CXM. But it looks as if the appropriate methods to
measure CX do not exist. That is probably why CX is often measured through
customer satisfaction surveys. Customer satisfaction in itself is a poor predictor for
a ﬁrm’s quality, since satisfaction can be high, while growth and loyalty remain
low [44]. An important critique on the measurement of customer satisfaction is
that customer satisfaction often is deﬁned on ﬁrm-established criteria, without
examining what truly moves the customer. Another often used method for the
Table 1 Outcomes of positive customer experience
Financial and measurable outcomes

• Enhancement of customer relations [35]
• Increase in proﬁtability and sales [30, 35] • Recommendation and word of mouth [22]

• New market entry [37]

• Reputation [38]
• Employee satisfaction [37]

• New customer attraction [37, 38]
• Competitive distinctiveness, ability to charge

measurement of CX is the Forrester Customer Experience Index or CXi [45]. With
this method, customers are asked three main questions: How well the organization
met their needs, how easy it was to get things done, and how pleasant the col-
laboration has been; the CXi is then an average of the score for these three
questions.
Customer loyalty can be measured through the Net Promoter Score (NPS) [44].
Through the NPS, an organization identiﬁes its customers in three categories:
promoters, detractors, and passives. The method consists of one question to cus-
tomers, the ultimate question, stating ‘‘Would you recommend this organization to
friends, colleagues or acquaintances [44]?’’ Customers that tend to recommend
(promoters) are usually loyal to the organization.
A recently developed measurement for CX is the Dutch Performance Index
(DCPI), which measures value-to-customers (V2C) and value-to-ﬁrm (V2F) [46].
The advantage of the DCPI over other methods of measurement is its measurement
of more customer-focused indicators, leading to a more complete picture of CX in
organizations. To measure experience in online situations, a model with corre-
sponding constructs has been developed [47], based on ﬂow [26].
We observe that none of the aforementioned methods is aimed at measuring
what customers truly feel, their emotions. Customers are merely asked to reﬂect on
their experience to evaluate this in a cognitive mode. The affective and sensorial
character of CX requires a method that is capable of evoking perceptions and
emotions [48], which is not an easy affair, because emotions are interpretative,
contextual, and almost untouchable [49]. Looking into the psychological discipline
to ﬁnd the appropriate measurement methods for emotions in consumption situ-
ations does not seem to give any help, either [50]. We observe that the marketing
discipline still lacks a comprehensive, quantitative method of measuring emotions
in CXs. Arnould and Epp [51] and Palmer [52] argue that, because of the sub-
jectivity of experience, qualitative methods are better suited to study CX.
4.6 Customer Experience Management: The Actions
from the Firm
To meet the emotions from customers, the organization is required to be capable of
delivering a total CX through effective communication and empathy. CX should
be managed [5]. All classic marketing mix actions are therefore at an organiza-
tion’s disposal, but now with a focus on CX. For instance, customer segmentation
is nowadays based on experience [53]; the multi-channel approach of ﬁrms should
be focused on enhancing CX [54]. However, ﬁrms should not only focus on
functional and operational factors to manage experience; organizational culture is
also important in the sense that customers interact with employees, shaping their
brand experience [55]. A positive employee experience has a positive effect on
marketing, CRM, HRM, and the innovation strength of the organization [56]. It is
A Bonded Experience
9

not only the marketer’s responsibility to manage CX, it is everyone’s responsi-
bility [57].
Experience providers Organizations can undertake some actions to manage
their customers’ experience [4, 5]. To do this, organizations can implement and
manage the so-called experience providers, such as communication, visual and
verbal identity, product presence, social media, etc. [4]. Berry et al. [28] suggest
that organizations should have an eye for all ‘‘clues’’ that customers can detect in a
transaction process. Experience providers and clues have to be managed in detail
and should be used in their fullest potential to create great CX [4]. Attention has to
be given to the spatial environment, the inﬂuence of other customers, waiting lines,
sounds, visual expressions, and even the weather [24].
Customer journey management To analyze the experiential world of the
customer, the customer journey approach has been developed [58]. The customer
journey approach entails a description of all experiences a customer is exposed to,
from long before the transaction takes place to long after this moment, depicting all
touch points the customer has with the organization and other stakeholders during
that time. The experience during this journey depends on expectations and the
interactions the customer has. Some of these touch points are considered ‘‘moments
of truth’’ since these moments are crucial and of high impact in creating a mean-
ingful and intended CX [59]. To construct a customer journey, it is not only
important to map what people say, but also how they feel and how they behave. An
organization can deploy a variety of methods and techniques to elicit these insights,
such as depth interviews, ethnography, observation, cultural probes, etc. [60]. In
managing the moments of truth, organizations should consider the peak–end rule
[61], depicting that experiences are evaluated on the peak and the end experience,
and not on what happens in between. The peak or end experience can be either
positive or negative, determining the strength and direction of the total experience.
The other experiences are not really forgotten, but left out of the evaluation [62].
4.7 The Role of the Customer, an Active One
Experience management literature focuses substantially on the ﬁrm’s role in
experience management, e.g., Carbone and Haeckel [63]. But customers should
also be prepared to create or co-produce their own experiences [29]. The customer
has to provide inputs such as time, money, search actions, involvement, and
personality [12]. Co-production of experiences creates value for the customer,
such as time-saving, ease, and enabling a customer-speciﬁc, positive, and mem-
orable experience [64]. But co-creation of experiences also creates value for the
organization [2].
Therefore, literature also gives attention to how organizations can engage with
the customers and address customers’ capabilities to co-create [65], how to
motivate them to execute tasks [66], and how to increase self-efﬁcacy and self-
conﬁdence of customers [67].

4.8 From Customer Experience Management to Co-creation
of Experiences in Open Innovations
Customer co-creation has become an important and novel way for ﬁrms to practice
open innovation in creating NPD/NSD [1]. Co-creation is however not limited to
NPD/NSD, but can be used to create new CXs as well [2, 35]. Carú and Cova [19]
distinguish a continuum with at the one end experiences that are traditionally
created by ﬁrms for their customers and, at the other end, experiences that are
solely created by customers. They observe that, with the progress of time, ﬁrms
tend to move from the one end to the other, passing through a co-creation stage, in
which the ﬁrm provides the customer with the basic platform and raw materials,
which are then being used by the customer, to mold and obtain his own experience.
Each customer designs his own experience in the unique context of each inter-
action they have with the company. More important is the customer process and
how he engages with the organization. When companies let their customer-facing
processes co-evolve with customer processes, they inevitably ﬁnd that the CX
improves (and so does the experience of the customer-facing employees) [68]. Co-
creation of experiences seems to become an important condition for services [69]
and new product development [70], where ﬁrms no longer provide experiences,
but provide artifacts, content, and platforms where customers can create their own,
unique experiences [21].
New product and new service development become more and more focused on
creating a total CX [58]. With NPD, apparently complex-looking problems can be
solved in a relative simple way, by responding to users’ experiences. It no longer is
important how things look, but how they are perceived and experienced. Prahalad
and Ramaswamy [71] already attended us on the increasing role of customers in
the development of new products, services, and experiences. They emphasized to
co-create value. This point of view has been adopted in later studies [72, 73] that
acknowledge the trend that customers become more active in NPD and NSD.
Customers seem to have a preference for ﬁrms that involve their customers in the
creation and selection of their new products [38], leading to an increase in cus-
tomer satisfaction, loyalty, and word of mouth, resulting in reduction in marketing
costs [74].
5 Customer Experience and Co-creation Management
in SME in B2B
SMEs usually constitute the majority of organizations in a society or economy. So,
it is somewhat surprising to see that the larger part of CXM practice and research
is aimed at larger enterprises, and in most cases at B2C companies. But, as we can
observe as a result from our previous systematic research, we believe that theory
on CXM is applicable for SME as well. SMEs, B2B companies in particular, are
A Bonded Experience
11

also dependent on customer loyalty and satisfaction. Loyalty and satisfaction can
be enhanced with CXM.
Hollyoake [75] investigated the difference between B2B and B2C experience.
He states that much of the current ‘‘wisdom’’ about CX relates to the B2C domain,
which is because the largest budgets are within the B2C sector. Throughout B2B-
experience, there is limited genuine hard evidence-based research and correlation
to academic theory. Within the B2B sector, the absolute number of customer
relationships may be fewer, but they are far more complex. They often include
multiple contacts at differing levels across a large number of touch points. Cus-
tomers themselves are becoming more vocal, sophisticated, and demanding around
what they expect. Consolidation brings with it leverage and an ability to become
more demanding of the supplier base. Hollyoake advises that, before embarking
upon the pursuit of a bonded experience with every customer, it is important to
understand the importance of the overall B2B relationship: The investment value
input into the experience needs to match the level of value gained. In essence, an
organization needs to segment its customers ﬁrst and to be clear where and with
whom to develop experience at the appropriate level. Once an organization has
achieved the delivery of a consistent experience that meets base expectations,
Hollyoake identiﬁes key areas that enhance the B2B experience. These coalesce
around co-creation of value, strategic understanding and contact at all levels across
the organization, working within strategic business units, ﬂexibility, and proac-
tivity. Finally, the relationship moves into what is described as a ‘‘bonded expe-
rience.’’ The four pillars of this bonded experience are trust, communication,
interdependence, and integrity. It is not so much the relationship or the way
customers are managed that differentiates an organization, but the experience
developed through the relationship that makes the difference [75].
CXM can therefore also be of interest for SMEs [37], showing that it can
increase proﬁtability and market share, and attraction of new customers [24].
However, more research is needed to aid SMEs in B2B sectors to ﬂesh out the
speciﬁcs of the appropriate CXM for these companies.
6 Conclusion
Based on a systematic review of extant research on the subject of CX, we have
recognized that CXM can be a new way for organizations to create a competitive
advantage, simultaneously creating more value for their customers. We introduced
a conceptual framework for a better understanding of the concept, identifying
several elements that have to be taken into account in CXM, i.e., the types, levels,
and strengths of experience; the tacit and measurable outcomes of a great CX for
the ﬁrm; the methods to measure CX; the conditions to execute CXM; the pos-
sibilities for CXM by the ﬁrm, such as the management of experience providers
and the application of the customer journey approach to gain insights in customers’
experience; and, ﬁnally, the role that customers have in CXM. With this latter
12
R. J. A. Journée and M. E. A. Weber

element of our framework, we have been able to cross the bridge from CX to
customer co-creation, in particular the co-creation of experiences in NPD.
Reﬂecting these insights on SME practice thought us that small- and medium-sized
enterprises can also apply CXM, although they need to seek a trade-off with the
cost of CXM. In that respect, we have observed that research has not reached a
sufﬁcient level of knowledge to aid ﬁrms in achieving this optimum. We intend to
further investigate the application of CX concepts in SME in B2B in ongoing
studies.

A Case Investigation of Product Structure
Complexity in Mass Customization
Using a Data Mining Approach
Peter Nielsen, Thomas D. Brunoe and Kjeld Nielsen
Abstract This paper presents a data mining method for analyzing historical con-
ﬁguration data providing a number of opportunities for improving mass custom-
ization capabilities. The overall objective of this paper is to investigate how speciﬁc
quantitative analyses, more speciﬁcally the association rule Apriori, can support the
development within the three fundamental mass customization capabilities. The
results of the Apriori analysis can be utilized for improving the conﬁguration process
by introducing soft constraints and consolidating the product structure by joining
components or modules and ﬁnally for improving production planning and control.

1 Introduction
In any company, it is essential to offer products which match the needs and desires
of customers to achieve sales and proﬁt. This is true for mass producers as well as
mass customizers; however, in mass customization, this issue is somewhat more
complex than mass production due to a much higher variety and a more complex
product structure. As pointed out by Salvador et al., mass customizers need three
fundamental capabilities to be successful: (1) solution space development—
identifying the attributes along which customer needs diverge, (2) robust process
design—reusing or recombining existing organizational and value chain resources

to fulﬁll a stream of differentiated customer needs, and (3) choice navigation—
supporting customers in identifying their own solutions while minimizing com-
plexity and the burden of choice [1, 2].
To support companies in developing their capabilities as mass customizers,
some research has focused on assessing the fundamental capabilities, to evaluate
within which areas the companies should strengthen their efforts. All three capa-
bilities relate strongly to the product variety, which is also the main element which
differentiates mass customization from other business strategies. This implies that
tools and methods for continuously assessing, adjusting, and communicating the
product variety are needed in order to improve the three capabilities. Mass cust-
omizers often utilize product conﬁguration software for implementing a choice
navigation process. A product conﬁguration is a piece of software which allows
customers or sales people to conﬁgure a product from a set of predeﬁned variety.
During a conﬁguration process, a large amount of data are generated. These data
can be utilized for different kinds of analyses with the purpose of improving per-
formance within the three fundamental capabilities; Salvador et al. [3] address this
speciﬁc as one of several approaches to achieve mass customizing capabilities. The
data generated by a product conﬁguration may include the following kind of data:
• Information about the customer
• Selected product options, e.g., parametric dimensions, optional modules, colors,
and functional requirements.
• BOM information, i.e., speciﬁc components for manufacturing the product and
quantities
• Sales process and manufacturing costs
• Lead times, quality data, etc.
The overall objective of this paper is to investigate how speciﬁc quantitative
analyses, more speciﬁcally the association rule Apriori, can support the develop-
ment within the three fundamental mass customization capabilities.
2 State of the Art
Data mining and association rules are a well-known ﬁeld and have seen some
application in the area of mass customization [4]. The data mining methods
applied in this research have similarly been used in the domain of mass custom-
ization by among others: Geng et al. [5], Hong et al. [6], and Zhou et al. [7].
However, this paper contains two novel contributions compared with the current
state of research. First, it presents a speciﬁc case study where the number of
association rules is studied as a function of the support and conﬁdence levels
chosen. Second, it suggests a method to exploit this knowledge to choose (in the
speciﬁc case) a reasonable combination of the complexity of association rules and
support and conﬁdence levels.
18
P. Nielsen et al.

3 Method
The paper uses the association rule Apriori, which is a widely used data mining
rule [8]. The Apriori association rule is based on determining two parameters:
conﬁdence and support. Support is ‘‘the ratio of the number of transactions that
contain the item set to the total number of transactions’’ [8], so support is the
indicator for the frequency with which a certain combination occurs.
Conﬁdence is the support for a given combination (e.g., A ? B) divided by the
number of occurrences of A. So high support indicates a frequent occurrence of a
given combination (A ? B), while high conﬁdence indicates that, e.g., A often is
found with B. So the conﬁdence becomes a proxy for the likelihood of observing
B given A.
Figure 1 illustrates the different levels of complexity of association rules
deﬁned and addressed in this research. Where the most simple association rule
assumes that lack of input leads to A occurring, the next level assumes that if
A occurs, B occurs with a given support and conﬁdence and so forth. Note that
links are unidirectional, and thus, A leads to B does not imply that B leads to A. In
the context of mass customization, these complexities can be directly related to the
conﬁguration choices or bill-of-material of the conﬁgured products. As an example
assume that customers choosing to use component A in their conﬁguration also
chooses with some conﬁdence and support to include component B. Of these
complexities of rules II–IV are investigated in this research to limit the scope.
This paper investigates two issues:
1. How the complexity of the association rules inﬂuences the number of rules that
can/should be taken into account.
2. How the support and conﬁdence inﬂuence the number of rules at a given
complexity level of associations and compared to a higher level of complexity,
i.e., investigate what is driving increases in number of rules, conﬁdence levels,
and/or support levels.
The resulting method investigates how complex a solution space is and how
difﬁcult it can be to, e.g., guide a customer through the customization process. The
ﬁrst point is investigated through identiﬁcation of the number of additional rules
created through adding a level of complexity at given level of conﬁdence and
support. The second point is investigated through ANOVA with conﬁdence and
support levels as independent variables and the number of rules and the factorial
increase in the number of rules as dependent variables.

complexity of the mining
rules and their deﬁnition in

A Case Investigation of Product Structure Complexity

The experimental setup is as follows: Conﬁdence and support are varied from
0.25 to 1.00 in steps of 0.05, and all combinations of conﬁdence and support levels
for rule complexity II–IV are investigated. This gives 16 9 16 9 3 (16 conﬁdence
levels 9 16 support levels 9 3 complexity levels) = 768 investigations that are
carried out.
4 Results
The studied case contains 180 unique orders with 178 bill-of-material parameters
that vary in inclusion/exclusion of a conﬁgured product. BOM items always
included have been removed from the study, so that only BOM items that are
actually conﬁgured are included. The method is implemented and tested in the
open source software R using the package arules [9].
The results of these investigations on the case data are shown in Fig. 2. From
Fig. 2, it is shown that the number of rules increases from in thousands, to the
hundreds of thousands and to millions as one goes from a complexity of rules of II,
to III and III to IV, respectively. A simple experiment of adding a further level of
complexity to the rules indicates that tens of millions of additional rules are
created by adding this complexity. This underlines that the even a limited number
of orders can contain a very large number of association rules, when the com-
plexity of these rules increases from simple rules (i.e., A ? B) to more compli-
cated rules.
By using ANOVA analysis, treat support and conﬁdence levels as independent
variables and the logarithmic number of rules (due to exponential behavior of the

complexity level of rules to the next. Second row: factorial increase in complexity from one
complexity level to another

P. Nielsen et al.

number of rules) and the factorial increase in the number of rules as dependent
variables. The best ﬁtted models are given in Table 1.
It should be noted that in the case of the factorial increase from going from II to
III and from II to IV in the complexity of the rules, the interaction between support
and conﬁdence levels is in fact signiﬁcant. However, removing the interaction only
lowers R2 from 0.77 to 0.76, so the interaction has limited explanatory value and
has been excluded. From the R2 and adjusted R2 values shown in Table 1, it is
clear that a large part of variation in the factorial increase in the number of rules
and the actual logarithmic values of the number of rules can be explained by a
combination of the support and conﬁdence levels.
For all three levels of complexity of association rules, the support level is the
most signiﬁcant variable in determining the number of rules created by using the
association rules. In general, the analysis shows that the higher the support (i.e.,
the higher the frequency of occurrence), the lower the number of rules. This seems
intuitively correct and can indicate a number of issues for the case. First, as the
number of association rules is quite low when support is 0.90 or above (for II–IV,
respectively, 117–545, 1,675–4,987, and 11,886–26,615, depending on the conﬁ-
dence level), the number of ﬁxed BOM combinations with high use frequencies is
low (taking 178 BOM items into account). Second, when support levels are low
(0.25), the number of rules increases dramatically (for II–IV, respectively,
904–3,322, 42,315–92,583, and 989,015–1,676,487, depending on the conﬁdence
level). This implies that there are in fact a very large number of BOM combina-
tions that are frequently used (even with conﬁdence level 1.00) and implies a large
degree of dependence inside the BOM structure in the particular case. For the
complexity of association rules at II, the conﬁdence level is also signiﬁcant in
explaining the number of rules. However, removing the conﬁdence level only

lowers R2 from 0.53 to 0.52, so like the interaction discussed previously, it can be
discounted from the discussion.
Of equal interest is how the number of association rules increases (for a ﬁxed
support and conﬁdence level) when the complexity of the association rules
increases. Interestingly enough, this depends both on the support level and on the
conﬁdence level, though again with the largest contribution from the support level.
The R2 values are c. 0.80 for the ﬁtted response models, indicating a strong
explanatory value of support and conﬁdence levels. This is not necessarily intui-
tive. However, it implies that when increasing the complexity of the association
rules to investigate the BOM dependencies, the support and conﬁdence levels are
non-trivial. Speciﬁcally, in the particular case, the response models imply that low
support levels tend to have high increases in the number of rules when the com-
plexity of the association rules is increased. In the sense of managing a solution
space, the number of rules to consider is thus very much higher if the support
levels are low. This could also indicate for the case that there are a large number of
constraints in the solution space for combinations that are seldom used.
5 Implications
The knowledge obtained from the Apriori analysis can be utilized in a number of
different ways. In this section, it is described for each mass customization capa-
bility, how utilization of the results can beneﬁt mass customizers.
5.1 Solution Space Development
Solution space development concerns the identiﬁcation and development of
product variety. This implies also to revise a company’s current product portfolio
in order to consolidate it if necessary over time. This is typically done by removing
unnecessary components or modules, which are seldom sold or which have a
function that can be incorporated into other modules or components. This will
generally imply lower manufacturing costs, similar to general design for manu-
facturing principles [10]. In this context, the results of the Apriori analysis could
be utilized to identify candidates for combining two modules into one module.
Often, mass-customized products are modular, and the modules are used to
accommodate product variety by allowing different variants of a certain module
type. However, this variety comes at a cost and reducing the number of module
variants will usually imply lower manufacturing costs. The results of the Apriori
analysis will indicate which modules are often sold together. If certain modules are
always sold together, it would be natural to consider joining these two modules.
There are, however, other considerations which could limit the possibilities of
joining two modules, e.g., if the two modules are supplied by different suppliers,
22
P. Nielsen et al.

utilize different manufacturing technologies, have different life cycles, etc., which
needs to be taken into account. If the module, however, could be combined, this
could imply a faster assembly process, as fewer modules would need to be
assembled, lower fabrication cost of modules, a simpler product structure with
lower administration costs as well as a simpler product family model and a simpler
conﬁguration system.
5.2 Robust Process Design
Another natural approach to using the information gained from the Apriori method
would be to use this to design both planning processes and inventory management.
In production planning [11], the typical approach is to batch similar products/
components for planning purposes [12]. However, in mass customization, this is
typically one of the main planning challenges, as there are by deﬁnition no
standard products to group for production, so products are either made-to-order or
assembled-to-order from a central inventory of components/modules. Standard
inventory management would then imply that components/modules are grouped
based on their individual characteristics (price, demand proﬁle, lead time, supplier,
etc.) [13]. However, this implies that items can be managed individually. The
study presented in this paper clearly concludes that a large number of components
directly or indirectly are always sold together. This strongly implies that both the
inventory management approach and the subsequent planning approach need to
take these dependencies into account.
5.3 Choice Navigation
The capability choice navigation is deﬁned by Salvador et al. [3] as ‘‘Support
customers in identifying their own solutions while minimizing complexity and the
burden of choice.’’ Hence, this capability is related primarily to the capabilities of
the conﬁguration system and its ability to conﬁgure a variety of products. The ideal
product conﬁguration should, after a customer has ﬁnished a conﬁguration, leave
the customer with the experience that the process has not been unnecessarily
difﬁcult to perform and the customer has been able to match his or her needs
exactly to a speciﬁc conﬁguration of a product [3].
The knowledge obtained from the Apriori analysis can be applied almost
directly to improve the product conﬁguration process. If it is determined that
customers nearly always select component B given component A, it would be
obvious to introduce a ‘‘soft constraint’’ in the product conﬁguration, which would
imply that once a customer selects component A, then component B is automat-
ically chosen as default. Contrary to a hard constraint, a soft constraint would
allow the customer to choose a different component than B following this.
A Case Investigation of Product Structure Complexity
23

However, selecting B automatically would imply less effort from the customer for
performing the whole conﬁguration process, yet leaving the ﬂexibility to alter the
automated selection.
The introduction of soft constraints should, however, only be made if there is a
high conﬁdence for a certain rule, i.e., component B is almost always chosen given
component A. If the conﬁdence is lower, a different approach could be taken. The
Apriori analysis may in some cases indicate that if a component A is selected, then
components B, C, or D are chosen equally frequent; however, other components
may also be chosen. In this case, in an actual conﬁguration, the customer is usually
presented with a number of different components to choose from (e.g., B, C, D, E,
F, and G). However, if this list is sorted according to conﬁdence, then the most
likely component would be on top of the list and the least likely in the bottom. This
would, like the introduction of soft constraints, improve the conﬁguration process
by reducing the necessary effort to perform the conﬁguration process.
6 Conclusions
Establishing the links between components in conﬁgured products can potentially
signiﬁcantly improve the ability to control the solution space and choice naviga-
tion for customers. Previous research has applied the Apriori data mining tech-
nique to establish these links. This paper focuses on a speciﬁc case and analyzes
180 sold conﬁgurations and their link to support and conﬁdence levels used in the
data mining.
From the case study, it can be seen that number of rules to consider increases
dramatically as a function of the complexity of the rules. Furthermore, it can be
concluded that in particular, the support levels are critical when investigating the
rules. In general, low support levels lead to many rules and to disproportional large
increases in the number of rules as the complexity of rules applied is increased.

A Method for Speciﬁcation
of Multi-variant Products Using
Degrees of Freedom of Shape
Attributes in Product Structures
Paul Christoph Gembarski and Roland Lachmayer
Abstract Planning multi-variant products in the early stage of the design process
is still a challenge. In the present paper, a speciﬁcation technique is introduced in
order to deﬁne multi-variant products using degrees of freedom of shape attributes
(in the following shape-DoFs) within product structures. Our goal is to plan variety
at the beginning of product development actively. Shape-DoFs are classiﬁed in the
ﬁelds of shape attributes (dimension, position, shape, as well as their combina-
tions) on the one hand and mandatory or optional components on the other hand.
Setup on this taxonomy graphical symbols are introduced for the use in product
modeling. As application example, a pipe rack is modeled.

following shape-DoFs) within product structures. Usually, the product structure
and the component’s shape are considered individually. For a certain products,
implementing both has advantages for product modeling [1].
1.1 Motivation
Planning multi-variant products in the early stage of the design process is still a
challenge. In particular, using modular product designs is favorable regarding
design efforts for customizable products, which means assembling as many
compound products out of only a few standardized components or subassemblies
[2]. The consequence is that relations between these components have to be
reduced to the minimum. Ideally, a sub-function is realized solely in one module
which comes with standardized interfaces. Therefore, the exchange of separate
modules due to either functional or design aspects is possible. Diversity so is
realized using optional components.
The approach presented in the present paper has different aims. According to
our method, a component’s degrees of freedom are intentionally used in order to
plan and benchmark diversity regarding technical and economical aspects. On the
other hand, those degrees of freedom can be understood as design variables which
are used in later CAD models.
1.2 Structure of the Paper
In the following Sect. 2, previous approaches of modeling product structures of
multi-variant products are presented. Sect. 3 then shows our method using shape-
DoFs. An application example (a welded pipe rack) then visualizes the concept.
Closing the paper, Sect. 4 contains a brief summary and drafts prospect questions
we are dealing with.
2 Structuring Multi-variant Products
Product structuring can be done in different ways. Generally accepted is the rep-
resentation using either assembly structures (the structure of physical compo-
nents), structures of functionality, or product architectures [3].
The assembly structure resembles the manufacturing and assembly sequence,
whereas the structure of functionality describes the relation of main- and sub-
functions. Both views on the product structure are mapped within the product
architecture which translates functions into physical components. Regarding the
assembly structure, it is represented by either a hierarchical component tree or
graphs. Diversity therein is represented as alternative or optional components.
28
P. C. Gembarski and R. Lachmayer

In order to describe variance in product structures, variant trees where sug-
gested [4]. There a component’s different occurrences are placed side-by-side in a
hierarchical tree, so the last row corresponds to the maximum count of all product
variants. Using restrictions expressed by conﬁguration rules or interdictions of
application, the optimal amount of product variants can be worked out. Therefore,
all occurrences of the product and its components have to be speciﬁed before.
A different approach is the use of degrees of freedom in product structures
which is discussed recently. In one representation, so-called cardinalities were
implemented which have to be understood as variables for distinct component
occurrences [5, 6].
Advancing is another method which distinguishes different areas in the product
structure. Therefore, ﬁxed and scalable arrays, optional and mandatory alterna-
tives, and predeﬁned and general spaces have to be differentiated in order to adapt
a product to new market conditions or functional requirements [7].
3 Shape-DoFs Within Product Structures
Picking up this approach, we deﬁne the general degrees of freedom using shape
and body attributes [8]. First of all, in this chapter, a taxonomy of shape-DoFs is
introduced. Afterward, these DoFs are transformed into graphical elements which
describe a product’s components.
At the end of the chapter, an application example (a welded pipe rack, Fig. 1) is
modeled with shape-DoFs.
Fig. 1 Pipe rack
A Method for Speciﬁcation of Multi-variant Products
29

3.1 Taxonomy
Regarding the superior classiﬁcation of product components, mandatory and
optional elements have to be distinguished.
Choosing one component out of multiple alternatives is already a degree of
freedom. Furthermore, shape attributes of faces and bodies have to be differenti-
ated as DoFs of position, size, shape, and count result. These can be used solely or
in combination.
Also to be considered as DoF are predeﬁned spaces within the product structure
when a component is designated but yet not detailed. In principle, such an element
can be modeled through a combination of all shape-DoFs. Not to mix it up with
components where the DoFs are used as distinct design variables, another DoF
layout is deﬁned. An overview of shape-DoFs is given in Table 1.
3.2 Symbols
The symbols are built up in three elements (Fig. 2). The upper part is the so-called
usage marker. It indicates whether the component is mandatory (rectangular) or
optional (triangular). The mid part contains the information ﬁeld with the com-
ponent’s name or identiﬁer. It is completed with the quantity n on the lower left
and a value range [a…b] on the lower right (e.g., when a position shall be between
100 and 200 mm, see below). The bottom part is the shape-DoF marker.

3.3 Base Symbols
Base symbols are used for fully determined and ﬁxed components which don’t
have any DoFs. In order to improve readability, we recommend labeling the top
node with another color (see example above Mounting Foot, Fig. 3). The usage
marker identiﬁes the components Base Plate and Beam IPB 100 9 800 as man-
datory, the Flange Plate is optional.
3.4 Selection of Alternative Components
Selections within the product structure are represented by a symmetric triangle in
the shape-DoF marker and a gray information ﬁeld. These nodes have to be
understood as placeholders in the product structure. They get replaced by the
distinct-selected component and do not resemble any BOM elements. In the
example above, the pipe support no. x can be set up either as double brace or as U
clamp (Fig. 4).
3.5 Components with Shape-DoFs
As shape-DoFs position, size, and shape are differentiated as well as their com-
binations (a component’s count also resembles a shape attribute; this is indeed
represented by optional components in the actual model).
If variable positioning of a component is intended, the DoF marker is a cut-out
rectangle (Fig. 5). The value range in this example expresses that the double brace
has to be mounted in between 160 and 360 mm measured form the base line. The
representation can be extended to all Cartesian coordinates (variable position in X,
Y, and Z).
Variable size is shown by a trapezoid in the DoF marker (Fig. 6). In the
example above, the length of the IPB100 beam may vary between 80 and 800 mm.
The size DoF might additionally be characterized by a certain step, e.g., the
beam’s length may only be varied in a 10-mm step.

The shape-DoF is characterized by a freehand line in the DoF marker (Fig. 7).
Regarding modularity, the interfaces to neighbor components should be stan-
dardized and must not be affected by the shape. In other words, an installation
space has to be deﬁned within the shape that can vary.
In addition, all possible combinations of shape-DoFs have to be allowed
(Fig. 8).

3.6 Deﬁned Spaces for Non-detailed Components
Reasonably non-detailed components only may be optional components. In this
case, a sub-function is planned, but yet not designed (this will, e.g., be done when
this sub-function is explicitly demanded by a customer). The DoF marker is a bend
(Fig. 9).
3.7 Cut-to-Fit Modularity
Our concept is able to represent PINE’s cut-to-ﬁt modularity using the size DoF
which also can be done on assemblies like in our application example below [9]:
This single-brace pipe support was identiﬁed as company-speciﬁc standard part
within a design project. It is manufactured in-house from a clamp and a t proﬁle.
The single brace is prefabricated in larger amounts in three distinct lengths.
When used in an assembly a suitable brace is taken and then cut-to-ﬁt. So, the
size DoF is in the subassembly single brace but not in its parts (Fig. 10).

Using the simpliﬁcation that only one diameter of pipe supports is used, the above
product model represents the application example (Fig. 11).

4 Conclusion
In the present paper, a method was introduced in order to model a product’s
variability using shape-DoFs within the product structure. The goal is to actively
plan variability in the early stages of product development.
Until now, we used three shape attributes (position, size, shape) for modeling. It
will be examined whether other attributes lead to other necessary shape-DoFs. In
the application example, a welded assembly was examined. In addition, it has to be
proved that other types of products can be modeled as well.
In our example, all shape-DoFs are furthermore decoupled which means that
there is no functional or geometric relation between them. This simpliﬁcation has
to be withdrawn, and a possibility for linking shape-DoFs has to be implemented.
Regarding economic aspects, we hypothesize that different shape-DoFs lead to
different costs in manufacturing. If a size DoF can be realized through another cut
length, the position DoF within a welded assembly might require new or adapted
jigs or ﬁxtures. Special attention has to be paid on the effects of the shape-DoF.
Recent manufacturing techniques like rapid prototyping and additive manufac-
turing offer new potentials there. Summarized, it has to be examined whether cost
scenarios can be derived of shape-DoFs.

A Proﬁle Chart Approach for Deﬁning
the Solution Space of a Production
Network
Lars Skjelstad and Maria Kollberg Thomassen
Abstract Norwegian leisure boat manufacturers have experienced a transition
from large to small production series during the last years following a general
decline in demand. They are forced to transform large-scale operations into han-
dling small volumes of highly customized products while maintaining the same
level of cost efﬁciency. The literature presents several frameworks that can help to
‘‘crack the code’’ of mass customization. However, the mass customization
strategy is still little understood and deployed in industry. There is thus a need to
develop more in-depth understanding of how companies can get started and
enhance their mass customization capabilities. This paper presents a chart
approach for deﬁning the solution space of a leisure boat production network.
Opportunities and limitations of the suggested approach are also addressed.

1 Introduction
Mass customization is the capability to offer individually tailored products or
services on a large scale [1]. Furthermore, it is about developing, producing,
marketing, and delivering affordable goods and services with enough variety and
customization possibilities that nearly everyone ﬁnds exactly what they want [2].
The concept offers new opportunities to companies combining a mass production

tradition with a high level of customization, maintaining high efﬁciency while
offering highly customized products. MC has got great attention during the last
two decades, but its adoption in practice has been slow seen in terms of the
increasing interest and major potential [3–5]. Even though the concept is easy to
describe, it is not that easy to deploy.
The literature presents several frameworks, e.g., [6, 7] companies can use to
investigate and ‘‘crack the code’’ of MC. However, existing frameworks are rarely
based on empirical studies, and industry therefore often ﬁnds it hard to make
practical use of the knowledge in the literature. There are several EU research
projects addressing implementation issues in various industries, for instance, the
automobile industry and the clothing and footwear sectors. The ‘‘Customization
500’’ survey [8], studying 500 companies that have started with mass custom-
ization, showed that 20 % of the companies have stopped or are closed down after
one year, while the ones that succeeded show high revenues. Companies need to be
better apt to realize the MC strategy and see the opportunities in their respective
industry. Research also shows that there are several unresolved issues regarding
the practical implementation of MC and that most conclusions are drawn from
limited case examples or based on educated guesses from individual authors rather
than from empirical evidence obtained through exhaustive research [9].
Charts are sporadically used to illustrate MC capabilities in research [4].
However, a proﬁle chart approach has not been systematically investigated in
depth as an analytical tool for a supply chain.
For manufacturing companies starting with MC, perhaps the most important
decision is how to deﬁne the solution space, what to offer. An investigation to map
customer expectations is needed. From a manufacturer perspective, too many
choices might be just as big a mistake as too few. Also, capabilities in own
organization as well as for key actors in the supply chain must be mapped to see
how well customer preferences can be met. Further, market expectations normally
alter over time.
Hence, we suggest using what we denote ‘‘proﬁle charts’’ to compare initial
gaps between market needs and the supply chain’s ability to meet them. It is a
quick and visual approach to get a start-off point, covering central actors in the
supply chain. An example chart of the number of variants preferred by customers
regarding a selection of leisure boat attributes is shown in Fig. 1.
The proﬁle chart shows the ideal solution space seen from a customer point of
view. We suggest that this initial picture should be compared to what the supply
chain is able to offer.
The purpose of this research is to present a quick and easy approach to deﬁne
the solution space of a production network by evaluating the trade-off between
cost, lead time, and customer satisfaction. Capabilities in the whole supply chain
should be taken into consideration.
The paper is structured as follows. The applied research approach is described
followed by a presentation of the theoretical frame of reference. Findings from
applying the chart approach to deﬁne the solution space of a leisure boat pro-
duction network are presented and discussed.

2 Research Approach
In order to design a proﬁle chart approach for deﬁning the solution space of a
production network, a set of MC capabilities were identiﬁed in the literature.
These were used to develop charts that could graphically illustrate MC capabili-
ties. The charts were tested in a case-speciﬁc empirical setting including a network
of three companies in the leisure boat industry.
Compared to simpler products such as sun glasses and shoes, boats are more
similar to cars and more complex products. The manufacturing time of a boat is
more than 10 weeks and can out of season be even longer. This opens for good
planning of deliveries from the supply chain into the major assembly project.
MC capability charts were designed based on data collected from the compa-
nies. A mix of qualitative and quantitative data was used. Data were collected
through interviews and from internal documentation. Company representatives
were involved in the development of proﬁle series during workshops.
Focus in this study is on the Norwegian leisure boat industry. It has experienced
a major decline during the last few years due to the ﬁnancial crisis and increased
international competition. Manufacturers faced a major challenge of operational
efﬁciency as production volumes diminished, resulting in batch sizes of one. At the
same time, customers preferred a higher degree of customization in their boats. A
potential arose for leisure boat manufacturers to adopt a MC strategy to more
efﬁciently align their organizations with market and customer needs.
The boat manufacturers could traditionally be characterized by a high level of
handcraft with sporadic customization rather than the mass production tradition,
which is typically among some companies that seek to develop their MC capa-
bilities. They have not yet exploited the possibilities that might be for them in the
mass customization strategy; they are not both customer centric and effective at the
same time. The decrease in volumes after 2008 was challenging and caused a
necessary shift in strategy from large volumes to small volumes and from a generic
market to more dedicated customers. From a theoretical point of view, smart
customization is a more proper term for the business today rather than mass

customization. A downsizing of the business was not enough; they also needed to
develop their industrial effectiveness and handling of individual customers pref-
erences in a more competitive way. They went from small series to one of a kind
and from handcraft to smart customization. Employing the thinking of mass
customization could prepare the companies for a future increase in the series
volumes. The need for a deﬁned solution space checked for cost and response time
considerations was essential. A case study strategy was applied. The investigated
case is a production network of three companies;
• a boat manufacturer that manufactures high-end leisure boats
• a windscreen supplier that provides windscreens to the boat manufacturer
• supplier of components made of stainless steel that provides a range of various
components to the boat manufacturer.
Even though the charts were developed for a speciﬁc leisure boat context, the
intention was to provide a general approach that can be applicable also for other
industrial contexts.
The charts presented in this paper are primarily designed to illustrate examples
of relevant boat attributes. They are based on the original charts designed in the
research project but have been simpliﬁed and made more explicit to show the
overall principles of the proﬁle chart approach.
3 Theoretical Frame of Reference
The competitive advantage of MC is based on combining the efﬁciency of mass
production with the differentiation possibilities of customization [10]. MC is
further about developing, producing, marketing, and delivering affordable goods
and services with enough variety and customization that nearly everyone ﬁnds
exactly what they want [2].
MC is a customer-centric business strategy applicable to most companies,
provided that it is appropriately understood and deployed. In order to beneﬁt from
MC, companies need to think of it as a process for aligning an organization with its
customers’ needs [6].
There are several examples of frameworks available in the literature that can be
used to characterize a company’s ability to carry out MC operations. Salvador
et al. [6] propose three common capabilities that will determine the ability of a
company to mass customize its offerings:
• Solution space development: Identify the product attributes along which cus-
tomer needs mostly diverge. The solution space deﬁnes what a company will
and will not offer to its customers.
• Robust process design: Reuse or recombine existing organizational and supply
chain resources to fulﬁll a stream of differentiated customer needs
• Choice navigation: Support the customers in identifying their own solutions,
while minimizing complexity and the burden of choice.

L. Skjelstad and M. K. Thomassen

According to Skjelstad [5] and Alfnes and Skjelstad [7], order-winning per-
formance objectives for MC include cost, customization, and responsiveness, and
companies with strong MC capabilities should be able to deliver customized
products quickly and at low cost (Fig. 2). This means that companies that seek to
improve their MC capabilities should focus on performance improvements related
to customization, cost, and responsiveness and ﬁnd an appropriate balance
between the three dimensions.
Although the literature underlines the importance of strong MC capabilities not
only of single companies but also of entire supply chains or networks [1, 9–11],
there is limited research dealing with MC capabilities in a supply chain perspec-
tive. The frameworks presented above primarily provide structures for character-
izing and developing MC capabilities of single ﬁrms and do not speciﬁcally
address MC capabilities of several companies in production networks. However,
the dimensions of these frameworks are also relevant for developing MC capa-
bilities of networks as a whole.
The solution space concept is used to deﬁne boundaries for customers’ ‘‘legal’’
choices. The solutions within the deﬁned space should represent the attributes
most sensitive to customer preferences. Since MC capabilities not only relate to
customization but also involve cost and responsiveness, the proposed solution
space must be evaluated also along these two dimensions.
4 Findings
The suggested approach reﬂects three perspectives including the customer, indi-
vidual company, and network of companies and follows a set of steps, see Fig. 3.
First, a chart was developed to represent customers’ preferences regarding attri-
butes and number of variants. This was compared to a chart showing the current
situation with regard to the network’s current offering, in order to identify the gap,
or development potential. The development potential was then considered in terms

of both costs and lead times of the production network, before the solution space of
the network was deﬁned.
4.1 Revealing the Gap by Comparing Customer
Preferences with Current Situation
The customer preference chart (Fig. 1) was combined with the current situation
regarding the number of variants per boat attribute offered by the boat manufac-
turer in Fig. 4.
This chart revealed a gap or mismatch between the customers’ preferences of
number of variants and the number of variants that were currently offered by the
boat manufacturer on all attributes except from ‘‘navigation package.’’ With regard
to ‘‘engine,’’ ‘‘sound package,’’ ‘‘graphics,’’ and ‘‘ﬂooring,’’ the number of variants
preferred by customers was higher than what was offered, while for the attributes
‘‘interior color’’ and ‘‘sunbed color,’’ the boat manufacturer offered more variants
than was asked for. Except for the ‘‘navigation package,’’ there was a gap between
customer preferences and variants offered. This means that there was a develop-
ment potential of increasing the number of variants for some attributes while
reducing the number for others.
4.2 Cost
In a robust process perspective, it was important to consider not only the manu-
facturing processes of the boat manufacturer, but also those of the suppliers. The
development potential in terms of increased or decreased number of alternatives
was therefore considered related to relative cost or savings of the boat manufac-
turer and the two suppliers. An aggregated overview of the costs and savings of the
network as a whole is shown in Fig. 5.

The chart indicates for example that an increased number of engine variants
imply a relatively high cost for the network. This is due to brackets, spare parts,
testing, negotiations with engine manufacturer, etc. Furthermore, reducing the
number of interior color variants will have minor implications for reduced costs in
the network. This means that in terms of cost, the most proﬁtable measures for the
network would be to increase the number of ﬂooring variants and to reduce the
number of sunbed color variants. The other alternatives were less evident, as a
reduced number of interior colors only represent minor savings and increased
number of sound packages and graphics imply relatively higher costs. The chart
gave a quick overview of the costs and beneﬁts associated with increasing or
reducing the number of variants offered by the network.

4.3 Responsiveness
A similar chart with regard to lead times was developed. The proﬁle chart in Fig. 6
was used to reveal the relative lead time difference of the production network with
respect to the development potential of attribute variants. An increased number of
engine variants for example would imply longer lead times of the network on an
aggregated level, while an increased number of graphic variants had little impact.
The proﬁles were again constructed by checking capabilities and consequences
for the participating network actors, following a ‘‘weakest link’’ type of logic.
4.4 Solution Space
Based on the cost and responsiveness perspectives of the entire production net-
work, a chart showing the solution space in relation to customer preferences was
developed, see Fig. 7.
The chart shows that an increase or reduction in the number of variants for
certain attributes implies several beneﬁts for the network in terms of both costs and
lead times. A chart was also developed to show a comparison of the current
situation and the suggested solution space, Fig. 8.
The development of the solution space is a continuous process, where the gap
compared to customer preferences must be sought closed. In our case, the man-
ufacturer has as an example to work on how to offer more engine options
efﬁciently.

4.5 Opportunities and Limitations
Several opportunities and limitations of using the chart approach for deﬁning the
solution space of the production network were revealed (Table 1). These ﬁndings
are based on the experiences from testing and developing charts in the case
companies of the production network.
The proﬁle charts constituted an efﬁcient tool for deﬁning the solution space of
the production network by illustrating and visualizing customer preferences and
the current situation, and as a means to identify gaps between customer prefer-
ences and company network charts. They further provided a foundation of col-
lected facts of current status for strategic discussions about direction of major
improvement potential.
Moreover, the charts constituted an efﬁcient tool for discussing MC strategies
with suppliers on how the network can improve the MC performance and better
match customers’ preferences. The approach implied increased insights among the

company representatives of challenges and opportunities related to building MC
capabilities in the network.
A major challenge was to get access to reliable data for characterizing capa-
bilities. In the case companies, operations were mainly managed manually and ad
hoc and ERP or similar systems were only used to a limited extent. This implied
that we had limited access to consistent data for developing the charts, especially
those related to costs and lead times.
Another important consideration was that the charts did not give a precise
measure of MC performance. Rather, they intended to give improved under-
standing of major MC capabilities and how these could be operationalized and
conceptualized.
Applying the charts in a network perspective revealed a major challenge related
to customer orientation. The leisure boat manufacturer ‘‘owned’’ the relationship
with the customer, while the suppliers had no direct interface toward the end user
of the ﬁnal product. This implied that the suppliers had little insight into customer
preferences as they are deﬁned in the MC framework. In order to ensure a highly
customer-centric production network including the suppliers, the boat manufac-
turer would have to share information about customer preferences with its sup-
pliers, for example via a Web-based supplier portal. The charts led to an increased
awareness of customer preferences among the suppliers in the network.
5 Conclusion
The proﬁle chart approach was used in this study to deﬁne the solution space of a
production network in the leisure boat industry. Findings show that this approach
constitutes an efﬁcient instrument for describing current situation and customer
preferences as well as directions for future improvement potential with regard to
the manufacturing network MC capabilities. The characterization itself can help
companies to better understand the MC mechanisms.
In a production network perspective, the approach can be used to improve the
understanding of customer preferences to producers and suppliers and a better

understanding of current status and challenges of other companies in the network.
The importance of the network perspective has been little addressed in previous
research.
It is important that the key suppliers in the chain are involved to ensure a true
picture of the network MC performance, since producers depend upon their sup-
pliers. We experienced that reduced lead time for one attribute did not affect the
total lead time, but could be offered as a postponed decision point for customers.
This research has demonstrated how the solution space of a leisure boat pro-
duction network can be characterized by using charts. The aim of this approach has
been to efﬁciently visualize and concretize the MC concept to companies so that
the strategic mechanism can be appropriately understood and deployed. The chart
approach was developed based on a combination of literature studies and empirical
data collected from a production network in the leisure boat industry.
This research may have implications both for researchers and practitioners. The
chart approach provides a starting point for researchers addressing MC capabilities
and MC performance measurement. It also provides a practical tool for managers
who seek to improve their MC capabilities and performance, as well as to clarify
the meaning of the MC concept in organizations. It makes it easier to bark on the
job of creating an understanding of consequences for the whole network when
altering the solution space.
This study has several limitations that give opportunities for further research.
Since results of this study are based on a single context in the leisure boat industry,
it is suggested that the chart approach should be tested in other industrial contexts
to enhance the validity. Due to limited access to reliable data, the study mainly
presented example charts that can serve as a starting point for designing more
reﬁned chart templates in future studies.
Future research is needed to further develop the approach, designing a more
comprehensive analytical management instrument for analyzing and improving
MC qualities. A few measures for MC capabilities for the leisure boat production
network were identiﬁed in this study that can be further developed in terms of
sharpness and preciseness for assessing MC capabilities.
Moreover, the charts constituted an efﬁcient tool for discussing MC strategies
with suppliers on how the network can improve the MC performance and better
match customers’ preferences. The approach implied increased insights among the
company representatives of challenges and opportunities related to building MC
capabilities in the network.

Applying the 5 WHYs to Identify Root
Causes to Non-completions in On-Site
Construction
Søren Lindhard
Abstract In on-site production, mass-customized subproducts are assembled
through standardized processes. The production is pushing mass customization to
the edge by producing unique and complex products. Due to the project structure,
it has proven difﬁcult to avoid repetitions of problems and to learn from mistakes.
A central part of the control framework Last Planner System is to identify not
completed activities to identify root causes and to learn. One tool to investigate
root causes is the 5 WHYs approach. The 5 WHYs approach has been applied in a
case study research to analysis the root cause to not completed activities. In total,
17 non-completed activities were registered and analyzed. To reduce non-com-
pletions, the risks each activity is carrying should be analyzed and understood, the

1 Introduction
Production in on-site construction projects is said to be based on engineering to order
where an individual customization of the unique product takes place. Despite the
uniqueness of the end product, construction projects contain a lot of standardized
work process and mass-customized prefabricated subproducts. Mass customization
is understood in relation to Tseng and Jiao’s [1] deﬁnition ‘‘producing goods and
services to meet individual customer’s needs with near mass production efﬁciency.’’

Even though construction projects can be viewed as simple assembling of mass-
customized subproducts, the project structure, consisting of a temporary organiza-
tion containing competing contractors, makes it difﬁcult to standardize, to schedule,
and to learn, especially between projects.
When mass customization is pushed to the edge, the products are becoming
close to unique and the production is reminding of one-of-a-kind production as
known in the construction industry. This high level of mass customization is
making it very difﬁcult to keep control of the production. To improve, mass-
customized production should look toward the construction industry, which is
experienced in handling ‘‘extreme’’ customization. Instead of planning based on
the product structure, like it is normal for standard production, planning is shifted
to an activity-based approach. In other words, the activity structure is often more
invariant.
To handle ‘‘extreme’’ customization, the on-site production control principle
Last Planner System (LPS) focuses on securing schedule reliability. Despite the
construction industries, experience in handling ‘‘extreme’’ customization learning
is still essential. Therefore, a part of the LPS is to learn from mistakes to avoid any
future repetitions [2, 3, 4]. According to LPS, ‘‘the starting point for improvement
in planning is measuring the percentage of planned activities completed PPC,
identifying reasons for non-completion, and tracing reasons back to root causes
that can be eliminated to prevent repetitions’’ [2]. Non-completions, which are
deﬁned as activities not completed according to schedule, are a part of on-site
construction projects [5]. Non-completions decrease on-site productivity by cre-
ating interruptions in the work ﬂow.
Root cause analysis is the discipline of identifying the cause to non-completions
[6]. Instead of ﬁxing the symptoms to recurrent and pernicious problems, the idea
of root cause analysis is to identify the root causes and to prevent the problem from
re-occurring [6, 7]. Root cause analysis plays a central role in the lean philosophy
and is necessary to ensure continuous improvement by pursuing perfection [6]. As
part of the lean philosophy, the 5 WHYs technique was introduced to capture and
analyze data [8].
The 5 WHYs is a simple technique where ﬁve WHYs is asked to systematically
uncover each layer to the occurred problem and to thereby reach its root [9, 7, 8].
The root cause is then eliminated to prevent the problem from reoccurring [7, 8].
Despite the importance of root cause analysis, the 5 WHYs is only rarely applied
in practice in in-site production [10]. The reasons to why the 5 WHYs is only
rarely applied is, besides a tendency in on-site production to de-emphasize root
cause analysis, the difﬁculty in identifying the problems emerging on-site [10].
Tsao et al. [10] found that the trades working on-site not necessarily do complain
about experienced site problems and identiﬁed 3 key reasons:
1. That the problems contractually often are the trade’s responsibility.
2. A determination of which battles to ﬁght. More ‘‘important’’ problems are
addressed.
52
S. Lindhard

3. Pride and the fear that complaining will result in a poor reﬂection of the trades
skill. Instead they believe that workarounds are how the problems are supposed
to be solved.
This research study is based on the research hypothesis that the 5 WHYs
technique will increase learning in on-site production, and it is made as an example
to how the 5 WHYs can be applied in on-site construction. By registering site
problems and identifying speciﬁc root causes, the lessons learned is estimated. The
5 WHYs technique is known from the Toyota Production system and can be
directly used in mass-customized production as an instrument for learning.
2 Methods
The research is conducted as a qualitative research and consists of a one case
study. A qualitative approach was selected to understand the context with sur-
rounds a construction project and to enable identiﬁcation of root causes to non-
completions. Moreover, the context is important because it forms and inﬂuences
the results [11].
The case study research was carried out by the following three steps: 1) Getting
started, 2) selecting case, and 3) choosing crafting instruments and methods, which
are presented in Eisenhardt’s [12] guidelines for case study research. Getting
started includes the deﬁnition of the research focus and the related research
question. The selected construction case was followed with focus on identifying
root causes to non-completed activities in the Weekly Work Plan. The root cause
has been identiﬁed by applying the 5 WHYs technique. It is important to keep a
clear research focus, to ensure that the correct data are collected, and to avoid
being overwhelmed by a massive volume of irrelevant data [12]. Mintzberg [13]
states it like this ‘‘No matter how small our sample or what our interest, we have
always tried to go into organizations with a well-deﬁned focus—to collect speciﬁc
kinds of data systematically.’’
On single-construction case was followed. The case was selected through
industry contacts, and it was ensured that LPS was applied and that a PPC reg-
istration occurred; thus, that activities, which not were completed according to the
schedule, were registered. The selected case embraced the refurbishment of a top
ﬂoor section at a hospital. The refurbishment project was carried out, while the
hospital was fully functioning resulting in limited site access where materials only
could arrive at early morning or late night. The site manager worked as a general
contractor, the contract value was $5.5 million, and the contract period was
7 months.
The data collection consisted of on-site observations, participation in the fol-
low-up process and the scheduling of the Weekly Work Plan, and semi- and
unstructured interviews. The construction project was followed in a 6-week period
with observation carried out once a week. During each observation round, on-site,
Applying the 5 WHYs to Identify Root Causes
53

unstructured interviews were carried out. The unstructured interviews served to
help with the identiﬁcation of root causes to non-completed activities. Moreover, a
semi-structured interview was carried out with the site manager. The semi-struc-
tured interview focused on the applied construction control methods, including the
application of Last Planner System, and the follow-up process.
3 Results
LPS was in general implemented successfully and functioned satisfactorily. An in-
depth description to the application of LPS is listed in Table 1. Data to the
application of LPS are gained through a combination of on-site observations and
the semi-structured interview. The structure in Table 1 follows the structure of the
LPS meetings starting with the follow-up process to last week’s work. At the
meetings, the general contractor was represented with a project manager, project
engineer, and a superintendent. Moreover, foremen did represent the individual
subcontractors.
3.1 Root Cause Analysis with Application of the 5 WHYs
Technique
During the follow-up of last week’s work, activities not completed according to
schedule were identiﬁed and the percentage of planned activities completed (PPC)
was calculated. It is important to realize that the PPC measurement is not a
measurement of productivity but of schedule quality [14]. Thus, both activities
completed too early and too late are registered. The registration of non-completed
activities did not rigorously stick to the general procedure. Some activities were
not registered as non-completions even though they were completed one day late
or completed before schedule. Moreover, at the meeting, which takes place every
Thursday, registration of activities being completed Friday and Saturday is based
on estimates. Despite a number of non-completions have been overlooked and
ignored, 17 non-completed activities were identiﬁed. Table 2 shows the 5 WHYs
analysis applied to identify root causes to the 17 non-completions.
4 Discussion
Applying the 5 WHYs takes time and a lot of energy. One reason is that, when
tracking down the root cause to the problem, the problem is changing hands. A lot
of different sides and companies are involved and it can be difﬁcult to get through

Table 1 Application of LPS
Step 1
Walk through the last week’s work plan and
registration of non-completed activities.
The individual contractor stated the completion state of the scheduled activities.
Activities are registered as completed according to the schedule even though they are
completed one day late or if the ﬁnish before scheduled.
The scheduling meeting takes place at Thursdays. At the meeting, they are just guessing
what work is completed Friday and Saturday.
Calculation of PPC is carried out at the meeting.
Step 2
Scheduling of next week’s work plan.
The individual contractor stated which activities he had scheduled to complete in next
week (and the related Manning is noted). The task is scheduled in relation to the
contractor and not in relation to where the tasks are located in the sequence (only very
little discussion in the process).
Often activities are recorded as a percent completion stage and not as completed tasks.
Task was often very big resulting in only a few task on the weekly work plans
Often the subcontractors were not very prepared.
The activities are just scheduled—only rarely a discussion is taken place where the
subcontractors in collaboration ﬁnd an optimal sequence. But the subcontractors have
the possibility to race questions and discuss.
The schedule is not related to the weather forecast—even though there is some weather
depended activities. Once the weather forecast was mentioned after the meeting.
Only very rarely a workable backlog is registered.
Step 3
Update of the master schedule.
The update is basically done by the site manager. Though he asks the individual
subcontractors about the status of the activities and the expected completions date.
Looking into the coming activities. The site manager is trying to cut down the duration of
the activities. Because they are delayed and wants to catch up. (Still delays so
afterward he walks though only the critical tasks and tries to encourage the
subcontractors to ﬁnd activities which can be cut down so they can catch up.)
Here, the sequence is continuously discussed in search for optimization.
Step 4
Update the constraint log.
Registration of the present constraints in activities which according to the master plan
should be completed in the next week. (Should have been on the weekly work plan.)
Registration of emerging and removed constraints.

to the person responsible, especially if the person responsible never is present on-
site. This difﬁculty in identifying the responsible person has been the reason that it
not always has been possible to identify the root causes. It is important to note that
root cause identiﬁcation would be easier at a factory production where all is
working in the same organization. In the following, it will be discussed what
lessons can be learned from the ones identiﬁed.
The 17 non-completions are categorized into 10 categories corresponding to
Lindhard and Wandahl [15] nine preconditions plus an unidentiﬁed category. The
result is as follows: Climate (4), safety (0), known conditions (0), materials (3),
design and management (1), space (2), prior work (3), workers (1), heavy
equipment (0), and unidentiﬁed (3).
No root causes were in the 17 incidents found to be related to the three cate-
gories: safety, known conditions, and heavy equipment. Since no heavy equipment
was applied at the refurbishment project, it is not a surprise that no non-comple-
tions are related to heavy equipment. If the complete construction project had been
followed and more non-completions registered, it will have been likely that some
would have been related to safety and known conditions. Conversations with the
project participants made it clear that the project had been redesigned due to
unknown conditions where changes in internal and bearing element were made and
not registered on the original drawings.
4.1 Climate
The climate in which the construction project takes place affects the work ﬂow on-
site. For instance, temperature, wind, moisture, rain, snow, waves, and visibility
can inﬂuence the work conducted [16].
The climate is difﬁcult to forecast. Unexpected climate conditions are difﬁcult
to handle. In one incident, an incorrect weather prognosis did cause the non-
completion of an activity.
Climate precautions can in some cases prevent non-completions due to bad
weather in evolving, but it is a management decision whether or not they should be
implemented. This decision is often based on a risk and a cost and beneﬁt analysis.
In the construction project, one particular climate precaution was considered to
expensive resulting in three registered non-completions. In a cost–beneﬁt analysis,
it is important to include the costs of these non-completions.
4.2 Materials
The material ﬂow is complex; numerous of different materials have to be delivered
to the correct work task on time [16]. To avoid re-handling or due to minimal
storing capacity, a lot of materials are delivered just-in-time. This increases risk of
58
S. Lindhard

non-presents, and moreover, the constraint is discovered very late without time to
make adjustments in the schedule. This is also the reason that the lost delivery and
the non-present material lead to non-completed activities.
The non-completion caused by a subcontractor following his own schedule is a
repeatedly problem [17]. A construction project consists of multiple competing
subcontractors, which have a tendency to work not only for the project but also for
oneself [17].
4.3 Design
The construction design is deﬁning which activities have to take place on-site and
includes relevant drawings and task speciﬁcations. Thus, before an activity can
start, the construction design has to be decided. In one incident, a missing approval
from the architect leads to a non-completion. Even though no root cause has been
identiﬁed, the non-completion still shows the risk of including ‘‘at risk’’ activities
in the buffer [18].
4.4 Space
In construction, a great number of work activities have to be completed simulta-
neously with only limited space available [19]. Furthermore, a small miscom-
munication can cause unforeseen complications and lead to non-completions. This
makes space allocation both complex and important.
4.5 Prior Work
Due to interrelationships between activities, the completion of the scheduled
activities might depend on the completion of previous activities. Three non-
completions have been caused by uncompleted previous work due to incorrect or
misjudged time estimates. Despite no root causes have been identiﬁed, the lesson
learned is once again the risk of including ‘‘at risk’’ activities in the buffer [18] and
the importance of following the production to identify the misjudgments.
4.6 Workers
The completion of every task is dependent on qualiﬁed labor. In one incident, the
subcontractor did not show up as scheduled which caused the planned task not to
be completed on schedule. The actual reason was not identiﬁed, but no illness was
Applying the 5 WHYs to Identify Root Causes
59

reported to management. The reason could be caused miscommunication or once
again it could be caused by a subcontractor working toward own priorities.
5 Conclusion
It can be very difﬁcult to avoid non-completions. Only small miscommunications,
carelessness, or misjudgments resulted in non-completed activities.
Increased collaboration and communication does reduce misunderstandings
[20]. Communication on-site could be strengthened by introducing a Communi-
cation Schedule that contains interrelationships and bonds among the activities, the
needs for coordination, and the one responsible [21].
Non-completions caused by carelessness can be reduced by increasing focus on
the risks an activity is carrying. Thus, if the soundness of an activity is depending
on the completion of prior work, material deliveries, etc.
Misjudgments are difﬁcult to avoid, but the effect can be reduced by following
the production to identify variations in work ﬂow and to reveal time to make
changes in the schedules.
The ﬁndings are transferable to a mass-customized production. Thus, the focus
on communication and collaboration should increase as the level of customized
orders increases. Moreover, the 5 WHYs technique can also be used directly as a
learning technique in a mass-customized production.

Challenges in Request Management:
Demand Management of Customer-Driven
Product Development
Anita Friis Sommer
Abstract Request management (RQM) is a new term used for managing customer
requests for new products. It is the counterpart to typical product development
processes, which has no direct customer involvement. It is essential to manage
customer requests in a structured and efﬁcient way to obtain proﬁtability. This
research study seeks to investigate the challenges of RQM in practice. Existing
demand chain management literature is used as a basis for developing a RQM
framework. RQM is investigated through an explorative research design in a
dyadic B2B case study including a global industrial company and its customers.
The study provides an insight into a new area of supply chain management,
including the process activity ﬂow and challenges involved across the process.
Furthermore, the method is dyadic including the customer in the case study, which
is rare in related research.

1 Introduction
Research within supply chain management (SCM) has evolved from logistics
research by incorporating the view of managing business processes from raw
material to end customer from a focal company in the supply chain [1, 2]. The next
evolutionary step of understanding is demand chain management in which the
focus is shifted from supply to a demand view, with the customer as the focal point
rather than the company [3–5]. In competitive markets, it is essential for a supply

chain to have a short-time and efﬁcient response to market changes [6]. It is also
essential to keep introducing new competitive products and to keep at pace with
the change rate in the marketplace [7]. Managing customer requests for new
products is viewed as special instance of demand chain management, which has so
far not been investigated in SCM research. Traditionally, new product develop-
ment has been viewed as a process initiated by the focal company, when in fact
there are various examples of product development being driven by customer
requests [8–11]. This research study is concerned with B2B mass producers where
customer requests for new products can be used to feed into an existing product
portfolio. Request management (RQM) is managing new product requests from
customers. In this paper, the phenomenon is investigated from a demand chain
management perspective and the objective is to understand how companies can
develop competitive advantage and increase customer value by managing cus-
tomer requests for new products and to develop an understanding of the com-
plexity of the cross-organizational process. The objective raises the research
question: What are the elements and structures of the request management pro-
cess, and what are the challenges involved?
First, a theoretical background is presented, including frameworks and models
necessary for investigating the phenomenon in practice. Afterwards, the method is
presented followed by analysis and results of the research study. Finally, the
results and contributions are discussed, including a presentation of a ﬁrst take on a
generative model of the RQM process.
2 Theoretical Background
Recently, it has been proposed that managing the demand chain can be viewed as a
separate discipline involving both logistics and marketing management [4, 5, 12].
The deﬁnition of DCM used in this paper is that demand chain management is:
understanding and integration of customer value as the focal point in key business
processes throughout the supply chain. DCM has been identiﬁed as a cross-
managerial challenge involving marketing and supply chain management in
interaction with the market [12]. DCM is combining the managerial areas of
marketing and logistics for increased competitiveness. Most companies today do
not have this integration, but some in highly competitive markets have recently
started to coordinate across these traditional managerial boundaries [12]. Another
framework on DCM developed by Jüttner et al. [13] presents a similar collabo-
ration between marketing and supply chain managers. This framework is differ-
ently focused on the managerial factors of the focal company and has not included
the market as a factor. Instead, the factors identiﬁed for DCM are managing the
integrated processes between demand and supply, the structure between the pro-
cesses and customer segments and social interaction between the marketing and
SCM. Both frameworks on DCM seem to include relevant elements. The frame-
work by Jüttner et al. [13] is developed through workshops with marketing and
64

SCM representatives, whereas the framework by Hilletofth et al. [12] is developed
through the researches own reasoning based on previous research. The special
instance of DCM where the supplier manages customers request for new product
or product changes rather than existing products is termed RQM. Based on DCM
literature, the framework depicted in Fig. 1 is used for exploring RQM.
2.1 Request Management Process and Challenges
Request management is closely interrelated with collaborative product develop-
ment. Collaborative product development has been widely investigated in existing
supply chain management literature [7, 13–17]. In existing literature, there is a
lack of research concerning the supplier’s side of B2B collaborative product
development where the initiator is customer requests for new products [18]. From
the supplier’s side, this consists of two elements: request management and col-
laborative product development. RQM is deﬁned as managing incoming customer
requests for new products from new and existing customers including a go/no-go
decision process. The accepted product requests developed in collaboration with
the customer, and thus, the second element in customer-driven product develop-
ment is collaborative product development. RQM is a cross-functional supply
chain management business process like demand management and product
development [2], and therefore, RQM is being viewed from a SCM perspective.
Customer requests for new products, which is customers acting on their needs
by a request to a supplier, are viewed as unﬁxed and to some extend variables of
external inﬂuence and are not regarded as ﬁnal expressions of ﬁxed needs. This
view is supported by Bonner [19] proposing a view on collaborative product
innovation as a learning process. When customers are actively engaged in

management framework

65

collaborative product development, they are affected through interaction with the
supplier through learning in a joint problem-solving project. In particular, when
dealing with ‘hard-to-articulate’ knowledge collaborative approach is relevant to
apply, the ﬁrst assessment of customer needs is likely to be insufﬁcient. When
customers engage in collaborative product development, it will have a positive
effect on customer commitment and loyalty [19]. Quantitative research studies
have also indicated a signiﬁcant relation between customer involvement in NPD
and market success/performance [20, 21]. Following this line of thinking, it is
relevant to use customer requests to actively include customers in new product
development, thereby improving commitment and loyalty from the speciﬁc cus-
tomer, but also to improve general market success.
3 Method
Exploratory research requires an in-depth understanding of the phenomenon in
question. Therefore, we apply the case study method to explore a speciﬁc instance
of the phenomenon in question [22]. A case study is ‘an empirical inquiry that
investigates a contemporary phenomenon in depth and within its real-life context’
[23]. In order to create visibility of the research process, it has been chosen to
present each method step including sampling, data collection and data processing
and critically evaluate the quality of the applied research design. This paper
includes a single dyadic case study. The dyad is between a buyer and supplier with
focus on investigating the challenges involved in the cross-organizational RQM
process initiated by the customer but managed by the supplying company. The
chosen case company is a global industrial production company with more than
30,000 employees worldwide. The company’s markets are within thermodynam-
ics, including a large range of products like valves, air-conditioners, and ther-
mostats. The speciﬁc business unit, which is chosen for this research study,
produces high-quality industrial thermodynamic products to B2B manufacturing
customers. This business unit was selected because it is currently receiving an
increasing amount of customer requests for new products and has started to focus
on improving the managerial tasks involved with RQM. The business unit has a
number of large original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers, and the
primary sales strategy is to develop long-term relationships with customers
through close interaction, high-quality products and services. The customers are
one medium and one large industrial OEM company both with a long history in
collaborating with the focal company. Both have recently been requesting for new
product development at the supplier and have had successful outcome of following
joint product development projects.
The organizational functions of interest for the RQM process was identiﬁed
through a preliminary study including two times 1 h interviews with the project
manager in charge of improving the RQM process. The RQM process was found to
be a cross-functional business process, which cuts across the operations
66

department including technical service, engineering, and department managers,
and the sales department including management, coordination, and sales repre-
sentatives from local sales departments. Persons from all participating functions in
the RQM process have been interviewed. In total, 12 interviews on 1–2 h were
conducted across the internal RQM process including two cross-departmental
group interviews both lasting about 2 h. Furthermore, the project manager
improving RQM was interviewed 6 times for 1 h over a six-month period to follow
the progression of the improvement project. Additionally, two OEM customers
were interviewed each for 1 h. The interviews were in both cases conducted with
the employee who had been responsible for the primary contact to the supplier
during the RQM process. The contact to the customer was made through the sales
department manager of the supplying company. An overview of the interviews is
provided in Table 1.
The interview study was based on a semi-structured interview guide constructed
to explore the RQM challenges based on the elements in the RQM framework. All
interviews were recorded, and during each interview, notes were made. After-
wards, all audio recordings were compared with the notes, which were used during
the analysis. The interviews were supported by unobtrusive data from the com-
pany, including power points, e-mail threads and documents with formal infor-
mation concerning the process. To increase validity of the study, triangulation of
data was applied whenever possible [23]. Furthermore, the analysis and outcome
were presented and discussed with the operations manager, sales manager and the
RQM project manager, thereby increasing data reliability. Internal validity and
reliability of the research study is perceived to be high due to the depth of insight
into the company and triangulation of data [22].
4 Analysis and Results
The company analyses the amount of accepted customer requests resulting in a
ﬁnal sale, called hit-rate. Ideally, this number should be 100 %, since all accepted
requests should lead to sold products. However, the hit-rate is only about 60 %
meaning that 40 % of the developed products are never sold. Evidently somewhere
in the process, something is very wrong. An overview process model of the RQM
process is been developed by the technical service (TS) department in an attempt
to formalize the RQM process. The process model is a stage-gate model, which
includes a linear ﬂow from an enquiry stage to an attractiveness evaluation stage.
The two stages consist of the following steps:

Enquiry Stage
1. A customer enquires for a new product or product change to a local sales
employee.
2. The sales employee ﬁlls out a customer request sheet (CRS), if the enquiry is
considered proﬁtable. When in doubt of business potential, TS is contacted
informally.
3. The CRS is forwarded to a regional strategic sales development (SSD) man-
ager. Requests that are outside the range of the company’s strategy or have a
too low business potential are rejected. Otherwise, the CRS is forwarded to TS.
Often the CRS details are unclear and SSD contacts the sales employee for
further details, which are then requested from the customers.
Attractiveness Evaluation Stage
1. Technical service receives the CRS. CRSs are distributed to two different TS
departments depending on the product area and speciﬁc TS managers within the
department according to global regions. For instance, a TS manager is
responsible for sensor products in the North and South American regions.
2. Each TS manager is responsible for a go/no-go decision for each CRS, which is
based on a cost–beneﬁt analysis. TS managers use the engineering department
as support function during the analysis. The engineering department is in close
contact with production managers to ensure that the product design ﬁt pro-
duction capabilities. Often, the sales employee is contacted by TS to elaborate
on CRS speciﬁcations. The sales employee then contacts the customer in order
to specify their needs.
3. After a number of iteration cycles involving the customer, sales employee, SSD
manager, TS manager, engineering employees and production managers, the
TS manager has collected enough data to make the ﬁnal go/no-go decision. The
customer request is then formally accepted or declined with a speciﬁc reason
attached, and the process proceeds to collaborative product development.
Event though the stage-gate model is the formal representation of the RQM
process, the model is inconsistent with the actual activity ﬂow and is therefore not
used consistently. The two stages are assigned to the departments of sales and TS,
yet all stakeholder departments often participate in the process more than once
during the process ﬂow in each stage. Instead of the linear ﬂow, the process has an
iterative activity ﬂow across the two stages and across two distinct organizational
silos, which include sales and SSD in one silo, and the operations department (TS,
engineering and production) in the other silo. The process iterations are considered
necessary to reach a sufﬁcient foundation for the go/no-go decision in the current
set-up, but they are not used consistently or formally, and therefore, the iterations
are hidden underneath the formal RQM process.

4.1 Request Management Challenges
Five major challenges are identiﬁed in the RQM process, which are related to the
low hit-rate. These include lack of knowledge sharing, uncertainty in go/no-go
decision, long lead-times, unclear strategy and increasing amount of requests.
Table 2 includes an overview of the ﬁve major RQM challenges, and the stake-
holder groups that identiﬁes the challenges, which will afterwards be described in
more detail.
Lack of knowledge sharing Local sales employees refer to the operations unit
as ‘a black hole’. As one employee states: ‘You send the CRS in, just to check if it
is possible to produce this item, and hear nothing for months and suddenly they
send you an email that the product is now ready to be sold’. This is one of the more
extreme statements, yet employees generally ﬁnd a lack of knowledge sharing to
be challenging especially between the two organizational silos. The lack of
knowledge sharing increases iterations and increases lead-time.
Uncertainty in go/no-go decision The go/no-go decision has a high level of
uncertainty related especially to tree interdependent factors: Finding the optimal
technical solution, estimating production costs, and estimating market potential
and customer value. Uncertainty is generated from the interdependencies, since for
instance both costs and beneﬁts are linked to the chosen technical solution, and
thus, if the solution is altered by engineering or the customer, it affects the entire
analysis. Furthermore, the technical solution cannot be developed solely by the
engineering department due to the high level of technical complexity, which
requires additional input from the customer. Hence, these alterations change the
prerequisites for the go/no-go decision even at late stages of the RQM process and
during the following product development process. Thus, as a TS manager
describes it: ‘The go/no-go decision is nothing more than a qualiﬁed estimate…
We often want to reply that we deﬁnitely maybe will accept the request’.
Long lead-times Through the analysis, it was found that managing even simple
product requests take weeks and even months. Questions about technical

requirements and possible price per unit are not simple to answer and in many
cases generate counter questions, thus going back and forth in the organizational
structure. TS and sales employees express that many requests are so to speak ‘lost
in translation’. They express a need to develop an overview system of the requests
and a more structured managing process internally in their department.
Unclear strategies All internal interviewees, apart from operations manage-
ment, express that they do not have sufﬁcient knowledge on the strategy and
capabilities of the company. They explain that so far, there has not been a clear-cut
product or market strategy, which has had the consequence that neither capabilities
nor the strategy has been considered in the RQM process until now. Operations
management has now, after becoming aware of this problem, initiated a market
strategy development programme to meet this challenge and considers developing
a technology centre function to share knowledge of production capabilities.
Increasing amount of requests Finally, during the last years, the company has
experienced an increasing amount of requests from all over the world. The chal-
lenge is to keep up with the pace of responding to all requests in a timely manner
while maintaining improving the quality of the RQM process. So far, there have
not been any internal initiatives to solve this problem, and TS managers express
that they are increasingly pressed by a larger list of unﬁnished CRSs.
5 Discussion and Conclusion
During the analysis, the process ﬂow across stages and organizational structures
was identiﬁed including a set of major challenges affecting the RQM process
negatively.
This study indicates that mass producers in B2B relationships receive requests
for new products and product changes and that RQM is an important management
discipline that may increase customer value and be an important competitive
advantage in increasingly demanding markets. Indeed, there has been found strong
indications from other research studies of positive outcomes of collaborative
product development increasing customer value [24–26].
The RQM process contains a high level of complexity including several
interdependent factors involving several disconnected stakeholders, product and
production technology, market potential in relation to existing products, customer
relationship. Hence, the challenges might be symptoms that the process is not
managed as a complex development process but rather as a demand management
process with low uncertainty. RQM differs from DCM on all ﬁve elements of the
framework. In DCM, the go/no-go decision process is normally related to pro-
duction capabilities and lead-time on existing products [1]. Hence, the decision
process of RQM is of a different nature, than the one typically managed by mass
producers. Social interaction in DCM is complex, yet for RQM the complexity is
increased further by including changes in the product itself, which requires
inclusion of additional functions in the process. The structure supporting the RQM
70
A. F. Sommer

process is similar to that of DCM in the case. Yet, the RQM process complexity
seems to require a more ﬂexible structure, with close interaction between stake-
holders. The customer is an active part of the RQM process, whereas they are
merely the initiator of the DCM process. Finally, strategy and capabilities of RQM
differs from DCM in the type of strategy, i.e. new product strategies versus market
strategies, and capabilities of product development and project management rather
than demand management. Hence, we conclude that RQM even viewed as a
special instance of DCM is a fundamentally different process both in regard to
complexity, customer involvement, activity ﬂow, and business potential. Even so,
both RQM and DCM are customer-focused processes, which must be viewed as
parallel, sometimes even dependent, processes that greatly affect the perceived
customer value. The research study is limited in that it is only concerned with the
RQM process, and thus, new product development, production management, and
logistics management have been omitted from the study. The supply chain for the
product is considered relevant [14, 27], and therefore, we call for further studies on
the relation between RQM and supply chain management.

Customization Issues: A Four-Level
Customization Model
Kaj A. Joergensen, Thomas D. Brunoe, Stig Taps
and Kjeld Nielsen
Abstract Implementation of mass customization and product conﬁguration in
companies requires fundamental considerations about how products can fulﬁl the
demand from customers. In order to support such decision-making, a multi-level
model for customization is developed. This model identiﬁes four different levels of
customization, ranging from the structure level at the bottom, through the per-
formance level and the experience level, to the learning level at the top. The model
also has a dual view with customers/demand at one side and product/supplier at the
other side. It is a rather general model, which can be applied to many types of
products, and typically, product designers must decide how far up in levels the
customization should aim. In this paper, the four-level customization model is
applied to wheel chairs.

1 Introduction
Mass customization (MC) was originally introduced by Davis [4] and Pine [16,
17], and several companies have recognized the need for mass customization. MC
has set focus on new requirements regarding the view of customer–product rela-
tionships and much effort has been put into identifying, which success factors are
critical for an MC implementation and how different types of companies may
beneﬁt from it [1, 7, 14, 20, 22].

For obvious reasons, there are different strategies on how to implement MC most
appropriately and it varies naturally between different companies, markets and
products. Because there is not a single generic strategy, it is important to look at the
issue from different viewpoints. The fact that products must be easily customizable
in order to achieve MC has been described comprehensively in the literature, and
more general, [1, 16] have discussed the issues related to readiness of the value
chain. Newer research underlines that MC is a strategic and sometimes non-
reversible development and suggests that the change process is considered as a
strategic mechanism. Consequently, in order to beneﬁt from MC, the mangers must
tailor the development process to the existing business, rather than vice versa [21].
Customization is very often an important issue regarding design, marketing,
sales and production. It is rather fundamental for customers to seek for individual
demands, and consequently, suppliers must decide to what degree they want to
fulﬁl these demands. Many manufacturers have learned that manufacturing of
many product variants may increase the cost dramatically and non-proﬁtably.
2 Product Conﬁguration and Mass Customization
An often used approach for implementation of MC is product conﬁguration, in
which a series of products is deﬁned by one single model—a product family model
[10]. Hence, a product family can be viewed as the set of end products, which can
be formed by using a predeﬁned product family model. The result of each con-
ﬁguration will be a model of the conﬁgured product (conﬁgured product model)
and from this model, the physical product can be produced.
Most of the methods, which exist for product family modelling, focus on
modelling of the solution space [21] of a conﬁguration process. This means that
they describe the attributes of the products and the product structure. Hence, they
do typically not focus on additional information, which goes beyond what must be
used to perform the conﬁguration itself. This kind of information, which could
include customer, market, logistics and manufacturing information, is according to
[19] similarly important, since a successful implementation of MC must integrate
all information ﬂows.
A product family model is often the basis for development of a product con-
ﬁgurator, i.e. a tool, computer software, which can support users in the conﬁgu-
ration process [6]. Product conﬁgurators are important tools, which can provide a
range of opportunities for adding new dimensions to the subject and conﬁguration
may also add more value to customers. Therefore, when a conﬁgurator is designed,
a large number of design parameters must be considered and balanced decisions
must be made.
Mass customization and product conﬁguration are relevant for many enterprises
and great beneﬁts are normally found, where customization is common and where
the idea is introduced gradually. In general, however, the beneﬁts depend very
much on the product and the market. In the relationship between the manufacturer
74
K. A. Joergensen et al.

and the market or more precisely the product and the customer, the product
conﬁgurator plays a major role.
A major distinction between markets and customers is business-to-business
(B2B) and business-to-consumers (B2C), and an important dimension here is the
degree of personalization. Personalization is most relevant in relationship with
B2C and a high degree of personalization towards individual customers or small
groups of customers generates special requirements to product conﬁgurators, but,
on the other hand, this also raises new opportunities for increased market share.
The enormous development of electronics and particularly computer-based
technologies has resulted in great change in product design and product devel-
opment. For instance, a large range of products has shifted from mechanical
products to mechatronic products with electromechanic and electric parts [2, 3].
This development is continuing, and for many new generations of existing prod-
ucts, the percentage of traditional mechanical parts are decreasing. Particularly,
customization of mechatronic and electronic products raises new issues.
3 Customization Levels
In order to support the decision-making regarding customization of products, a
model for customization has been developed [11, 12, 13]. This model (see Fig. 1)
identiﬁes four different levels of customization, ranging from the structure level at
the bottom, through the performance level and the experience level, to the learning
level at to top. The model has a dual view with customers/demand at one side and
product/supplier at the other side. It is considered a general model, which can be
applied to many types of product families, and typically, it must be decided how
far up in levels the development should aim. Further, a good match between the
two sides and on each level must be established.
In the following, the four levels of the model are described in further detail and
some most typical design issues are addressed and explained by referring to wheel
chairs as a sample product family (see e.g. Fig. 2). Obviously, wheel chairs must
be manufactured in many variants to meet the demands from a great variety of
end-users. Hence, the degree of personalization is rather high for this product
family. In the following, the product/supplier side of the customization model has
the primary focus and customer/market demands rest only on commonly known
end-user requirements and are not addressed in particular.
3.1 Customization: Structure Level
It is very common to view customization on the structure level because it is
characterized as a matter of offering components, which can be used as building
blocks. Typical commercial product examples are computers, automobiles and
Customization Issues: A Four-Level Customization Model
75

bicycles. Important issues are modularity, interfaces of modules and product
platforms, i.e. end products are conﬁgured by selections among modules, and
modules are assemblies of components. Very often, modularity is recommended as
an enabler for implementation of product conﬁguration, and modules are most
preferably identiﬁed with clear separation of functionalities, i.e. modularity is in
contrast to integration. Further, different architectures of modularity are worth
considering.

Fig. 2 Sample wheel chair
76
K. A. Joergensen et al.

Looking at wheel chairs on the structure level comprises the identiﬁcation of
components: frame, wheels, seat, footrest, bearings, brakes, etc. The end product is
an assembly of these components, and a traditional consideration, seen from a
manufacturing point of view, is to decide which components are standard sub-
supplied components and which are manufactured in-house. This issue must be
viewed closely connected to the need for customization, where nearly all com-
ponents must be available in multiple variants depending on, e.g., the size and
weight of the end-user. The frame, for instance, must be provided in different sizes
(height, width and depth) and strength. In addition, wheels (main wheels and front
wheels) and seats must also be offered in different variants.
Consequently, a wheel chair is a product family and the frame is a good
representative of the classic dilemma of MC: to provide a large range of variants
for customers versus to constrain the number of manufactured variants. Typically,
this problem is solved by modularization, and for this product family, the frame
will become the primary module. For this module, it is important to focus on all
relationships with the remaining components and design interfaces, which are
standardized and easy to assemble. Further, when the product family is presented
to customers and the foundation for conﬁguration is build, other modules are
identiﬁed in order to simplify choice navigation. A typical result here is that
multiple components are put together in one module, e.g., the two main wheels are
together a module and likewise the two front wheels.
The frame module is special because it is also conﬁgurable and particular
relationships with the remaining modules and components can be deﬁned. Hence,
measurements of the end-user may constrain the conﬁguration of the frame, and
the frame may constrain the selection of other modules/components. A conﬁgu-
rator model of the frame has special importance and become a key instrument to
get success regarding implementation of MC.
3.2 Customization: Performance Level
On the next level, the performance of products is essential. When products are
installed in their user environment, they perform their functions—hopefully in the
expected way. Therefore, considerations about the ability to perform the functions,
which are required by the customer, are very important and should be a signiﬁcant
subject of conﬁguration. Hence, the focus of product conﬁguration is shifted to
identiﬁcation and deﬁnition of product attributes instead of modules and compo-
nents. This is particularly important, when the performance of the product is
essential and a careful balance between integration and modularization must be
established. Extreme product examples are automobile engines and computer
processors.
Functional issues of products are important in relationship with modularization
and mapping of functional requirements to speciﬁc modules is considered in
[9, 5, 15]. Jiao proposes to use a triple-view representation scheme. The three
Customization Issues: A Four-Level Customization Model
77

views are the functional, technical and structural views. The functional view is
used to describe, typically, the customer’s functional requirements, and the tech-
nical view is used to describe the design parameters in the physical domain. The
structural view, which corresponds to the structural level described above, includes
the mapping between the functional and technical view as well as the rules of how
a product may be conﬁgured. The description of this modelling approach is
however rather conceptual and is not easily implemented in industrial applications.
The performance of a wheel chair is very important for the end-user. Perfor-
mance requirements must be speciﬁed in harmony with the end-user and is about,
e.g., seat and footrest adjustment, stability and manoeuvrability. For instance, ideal
stability must be arranged individually by positioning the seat and thereby gain the
right balance of weight between main wheels and front wheels. This performance
requirement leads to further design constraints on the frame in addition to those
identiﬁed on the structure level.
The two lower levels of customization, the structure level and the performance
level, are rather common and widely used with many products and on all types of
markets. The additional two upper levels of the customization model will primarily
relate to customers and products with higher degree of personalization.
3.3 Customization: Experience Level
The next level, termed the experience level, focuses on special attributes of
products and on immaterial attributes, which are related to customer’s emotions
and even dreams. Involvement in a conﬁguration process will for many customers
result in a higher degree of satisfaction, and the customer will likely feel a stronger
attachment to the solution [18]. The experience level of customization is therefore
strongly related to personalization. Hence, customers typical for this level are
primarily individual persons or relatively small groups. Many fashion and service
products, for instance, are highly personalized and aim at giving the customer-
speciﬁc experiences. Additional examples are entertainment, personal care, well-
ness and travel. Many examples show that conﬁgurators for these types of products
aim at special values of the products for the customers. Also with ordinary
products, many customers may ﬁnd extra dimensions of personal value. Cus-
tomer’s concern for the environment may for instance give more preference for
ecologic products.
A major distinction regarding markets/customers is the personalization
dimension. Obviously, personalization is most relevant in relationship with busi-
ness-to-consumer products and a high degree of personalization towards individual
customers or small groups of customers generates special requirements to prod-
ucts, but, on the other hand, this also raises new opportunities for increased vol-
ume. Products may offer user-driven customization, and also this way increases the
emotional-based satisfaction. In order to create good support for the experience
level, it is important that the available options are matched properly with the
78
K. A. Joergensen et al.

customer needs and it is important to analyse, what effect different attributes have
on customers, whether they are real or imaginary attributes.
An important aspect of this customization level is authenticity. Gilmore and
Pine [8] show that customers are becoming more sensitive and expect higher and
higher quality of goods and services. Practically all consumers desire authenticity.
Every person is unique, and he is perhaps aware of his own uniqueness and values
it. The consumer sensibility for authenticity evidences itself, and whenever
informed, individuals independently purchase any item with which they are
intensely involved. According to this theory, many companies fail if they act
against their own policies. If a company claims to be very conscientious, it may
very fast loose loyalty, if the opposite is found; for instance, if it is disclosed that
some products are produced by children and perhaps under poor circumstances.
These aspects relate also to product conﬁguration. Because of the endless number
of emotional preferences residing at customers, this customization level could be
more beneﬁcial and should get more attention.
For the wheel chair product family, the experience level is also very important.
There are many ways, how end-users can be satisﬁed emotionally. For instance,
seats can be formed differently and, thereby, give different seating comfort. Some
basic comfort parameters may relate to the performance level, but additional
ergonomic efforts may also be valued, especially for end-users who have to use the
wheel chair for long periods. The colour of the wheel chair may also be an
important opportunity for giving the customer a special experience from using the
product.
Means for good conﬁgurator support on the experience customization level are
to present the perhaps unseen values of products, to provide good and reliable
guidance to the user and to display consequences of choices. If the options are
limited, it is important to be selective regarding customer segments. However,
some customers may be intimidated by getting a wrong message.
3.4 Customization: Learning Level
At the top level of customization, the learning level, special services must be
offered that may result in further impact on the involved customer or end-user. A
product in the traditional understanding may be present, but special aspects of the
product may lead to a learning process for the customer/end-user. Often, this is
related to complex products with numerous functionalities, which require sub-
stantial training and support for optimal usage. Many services of this kind can be
provided by related Web sites with user-friendly tutorials and help support and
assistance for troubleshooting.
A large amount of features and services may be included in products and such
services may identify a range of subjects that represent a gap between the cus-
tomer’s knowledge and what the product can offer. Consequently, the transfor-
mation of the customer is a key issue on the learning level.
Customization Issues: A Four-Level Customization Model
79

The product may be difﬁcult to understand for the customer, and the knowledge
gap may be related to different aspects of the product. Perhaps the product must ﬁt
into complex processes at the end-user’s site, and it may be difﬁcult for the
customer to estimate, how the product can fulﬁl the requirements. Maybe the
customer for the ﬁrst time is engaged in a complex purchasing process, where
many issues are new to the customer. Therefore, it should be possible for the
customer to ﬁnd answers to questions about such issues. If customers are unable or
unskilled to make decisions about such issues, trustworthy guidance must be
provided, perhaps along with the conﬁgurator. In this way, the conﬁgurator and
guide are integrated with the product or it can be seen to complement the product.
The learning level can also be related to wheel chairs. End-users may have
many different usages and may require different set-up of their product. However,
an optimal set-up may be difﬁcult to ﬁnd. As already mentioned, stability is an
important issue for wheel chairs and a good balance for an end-user may be
violating requirements about stability. Very often, an experienced consultant is
needed to ﬁnd the solutions. This person may know a method for doing so, but, if
such a method must be described and applied to a wide range of use cases and
proportions of end-users, it may become very complicated. To develop such an
amendment to the physical product may initiate a valuable learning process for the
end-user.
Like for the previously presented customization levels, issues on the learning
level should create further attraction from the customer towards the product but
adding such additional features also requires a precise segmentation of customers
in order to attract the attention and initiate a relationship with new customers. Too
many features may give a negative effect and well-skilled customers for instance
may ﬁnd this kind of support as a barrier, so it is important that the conﬁgurator is
able to adjust itself to different customer types.
4 Conclusion
If product design is performed with respect to mass customization, customization
issues are normally very important to consider and, in order to support this, a
model for customization has been developed and presented. The model arranges
customization in four different levels of customization, ranging from a structure
level at the bottom, through a performance level and an experience level, to a
learning level at the top. Further, the levels must be seen from both a customer/
demand side and a product/supplier side. Designers must consider to which extend
the issues related to the four customization levels should be applied.
In addition, it is important to create a design approach, which includes both a
bottom-up view and a top-down view. The presentation and the select issues related
to the wheel chair product family clearly underline it is not enough to look at the
structure level, which is the most commonly used view. Each of the levels above
also contributes with special views of customization and design requirements
80
K. A. Joergensen et al.

identiﬁed on one level have inﬂuence on other levels. Hence, a good balance among
the use of all levels is preferable.
An important dimension of customization is the degree of personalization
because a strong orientation towards individual customers or small groups of
customers generates special requirements regarding customization. Implementa-
tion of such requirements, however, may also raise new opportunities for increased
volume. In connection with the presentation of the customization levels, a wheel
chair is introduced as a sample product family. Obviously, this is a type of product,
which must be personalized to a rather high degree. It must be underlined, how-
ever, that the customization model can be applied to many other types of products
and many markets or customers.
Many applications of conﬁguration and use of computer-based conﬁgurators
provide a range of opportunities for adding new dimensions, and it is argued that
the presented model for customization on different levels can add more value to a
product and make it more attractive for customers.

Danish Public Construction Counselling
Selection and Assignment Criteria
in European Tendering
Jesper Kranker Larsen, Lene Faber Ussing
and Thomas D. Brunoe
Abstract One of the largest customers in the Danish construction industry is
public agencies that own and develop projects. For some of the counselling ser-
vices, they recur to be put out in European tendering. The aim is to ﬁnd which
selection and assignment criteria are used most in public tendering. How projects
use selection and assignment criteria for counselling services and ﬁnally if there is
signiﬁcant use of selection and assignment methods in public counselling. The
method is based on 74 public counselling tenders from the European Tenders
Electronic Daily database from January 2010 to March 2013. A following standard
error and Fisher’s exact test were conducted to test if there were any signiﬁcant
relations. Results indicate that invited tender with pre-qualiﬁcation and most
economically advantageous offer in 57.1 % of the tenders are the most used
selection and assignment criteria in public counselling services.

criteria are used to secure that the project partners have the right competence and
resources according to the chosen selection and assignment criteria for the project
in tender [1]. The different combinations of selection and assignment criteria are
therefore used to secure the best offer according to the project economy, user
demands and the owner and project manager’s strategic project plan [2].
Normally seen selection criteria in the Danish construction industry are invited
tender with a pre-qualiﬁcation process where the pre-qualiﬁcation process requires
that the incoming offer has the right competence and resources to fulﬁl the pro-
ject’s demands to both technical and human capital etc. Another normally used
selection criteria is open procedure tender where all offers are welcome, and no
further qualiﬁcation is required. Looking at the used assignment criteria, the lowest
price is a normally seen criterion where the owner and project manager use the
market forces to secure the lowest price on a project between the incoming offers.
The obverse of that assignment criterion is a most economically advantageous
offer where a planned percentages-weighting of parameters such as architecture,
functionality and price is used to evaluate a more varied perspective to ﬁnd the
best offer for the speciﬁc project or task [3].
It is therefore of particular interest to study how public construction counselling
services’ selection and assignment criteria are used and combined within different
project types such as restoration and maintenance projects’, and new construction
project types, based on the public construction agencies. These agencies are the
largest owners and developers in the Danish construction industry, and their use of
selection and assignment criteria in construction counselling services has never
been studied.
The aim of this study is therefore to ﬁnd out which selection and assignment
criteria are mostly used in Danish public construction counselling services put out
in European tender, how different types of construction projects use selection and
assignment in the bidding process and ﬁnally, if there are any signiﬁcant difference
between the used selection and assignment methods in Danish public counselling
construction projects.
2 Materials and Methods
The research method used for the study is based on a quantitative research
approach in three stages to secure a systematic research process.
The ﬁrst stage the ‘‘input stage’’ was conducted basically as a literature review
according to [4] and adjusted according to [5, 6]. The authors started the research
by ﬁrst identifying which Danish public agencies manage, develop and supervise
public construction projects and buildings, which hereafter was converted into
search strings by adding ‘‘AND’’, ‘‘AU’’ and ‘‘CY’’ for example, CY = [DK]
AND AU = [Agency no. 1] AND AU = [Agency no. 2] etc., and hereafter tested
in the European Tenders Electronic Daily database to ﬁnd which search string
identiﬁed most tender cases. The search string that identiﬁed most tender cases
84
J. K. Larsen et al.

was hereby the main search string, where 258 hits were identiﬁed, and by a
following data-proceeding, the amount of cases was reduced, because some tender
cases were construction tasks and others did not contain useful or correct data for a
following data analysis.
During the next ‘‘processing stage’’, the data were limited to focus on tender
cases from January 2010 to the month of March 2013, where the ﬁnal 74 cases
were found and hereafter converted to numerical data so a following segmenting
and data analysis was possible. The data analysis was conducted in the software
Microsoft Excel, where the dataset was calculated for standard error and Fisher’s
exact test of independence for testing if there was any signiﬁcant use of selection
and assignment criteria, the signiﬁcance level was decided to 0.05 according to [7].
In the last ‘‘output stage’’, the result was presented for colleagues for a ﬁnal
review, and hereafter the paper and arguments were constructed according to the
results.
3 Results
In this section, the results from the third stage, output stage will be presented by a
quantitative research approach to answer the outlined research questions, the
ﬁndings of the analysis will be presented individually in selection and assignment
criteria according to the speciﬁc counselling project types, and ﬁnally the selection
and tendering criteria will be analysed using a Fisher’s exact test to ﬁnd if there is
any signiﬁcant use of some criteria.
The different counselling project types are used in the analysis, and the results
are shown in Fig. 1, where the segment ‘‘restoration and maintenance projects’’ by
8 (10.8 %) of the 74 cases covers construction counselling services, where the
objectives are to restore and maintain older buildings, where its user requirements
or user functions have changed so radically that a restoration of the building is
required. Further, the described segment will also include small counselling ser-
vices such as construction part replacements, for example windows, roof and other
facility management counselling services that still demand a European tendering.
The second most involved project counselling services are ‘‘new construction
projects’’ by 11 (14.9 %) of the 74 cases that contain construction counselling
services of new buildings such as ofﬁces and university buildings etc.
The segment ‘‘unspeciﬁed counselling services’’, which covers 55 (74.3 %) of
the 74 cases, contains tenders where the selection or assignment criteria are
described, but the speciﬁc construction counselling type, whether it is a new
construction project or restoration project, is not described in the tender documents
and the exact reason for the large amount of unspeciﬁed counselling services is the
authors not familiar with, but a theory could be that the tender cases represent a
phase in the construction project where it are in its client brief phase and where the
speciﬁc project objective still is unclear.

3.1 Selection Criteria
Looking at the most used selection criterion, regardless of counselling project type,
it is invited tender with a pre-qualiﬁcation process in the 64 (86.5 %) of the 74
cases used, see Fig. 2.
The advantages of invited tender with a pre-qualiﬁcation process are that the
owner and project manager can secure that the tenderer has the right qualiﬁcation
and resources to manage and design the project before the following offer process
starts and hereby use the pre-qualiﬁcation process as a control point to protect the
project from counselling partners who do not have the qualiﬁcation to fulﬁl the
minimum requirements, which the owner and project manager have set as control
points in the pre-qualiﬁcation process.
Second most used selection criterion is found to be open procedure tendering by
5 (6.8 %) of the 74 cases which is also the level for the no published tendering
segment at Fig. 2, which by looking at the distribution of the three segments not is
distributed equally in the counseling services.
The advantages of using open procedure tender are the additional unlimited
offers that, if it is an advantage for the case, can press the total project price, but by
opening for in theory unlimited offers, the chance for frivolous counselling part-
ners will also increase which potentially can give later project complications in the
following project phases. Therefore, the open procedure tender has both advan-
tages of using the marked forces to secure a large amount of offers and of pressing
the total price, but on the other hand, the selection model has the weakness of
increasing the chances for counselling partners who do not have the right com-
petencies. Open procedure tender should therefore only be used in counselling
tasks where the impact of later complications is limited to the general project and
following construction process.

To test if there is a signiﬁcant level of selection criteria between the different
counselling project types, the null hypothesis is tested, see Table 1, where the null
hypothesis was conﬁrmed, and therefore. the data are not demonstrating a sig-
niﬁcant use of invited tender with a pre-qualiﬁcation process, but by looking at
Fig. 2, it is obviously by 86.5 % of the cases using that selection criterion. The
Fisher’s exact test is therefore not demonstrating a clear picture of the use of the
selection criterion because on the data in most of the cases is incomplete on
counselling type of the tender.
The results of the selection criterion must therefore be that there is an indication
of signiﬁcant use of invited tender with a pre-qualiﬁcation, and by looking at the

limited distribution between project counselling type, there is a tentative indication
that both restoration and maintenance counselling services by 33.3 % and new
construction project counselling services by 55.6 % are using invited tender with
pre-qualiﬁcation as selection criterion by in total 88.9 % of the described cases,
which is nearly the same percentage distribution in Fig. 2 by 86.5 %.
3.2 Assignment Criteria
Looking at the most used assignment criterion regardless of project type, it is
found to be most economically advantageous offer in 54 (73.0 %) of the 74 cases,
see Fig. 3.
The advantage of using most economically advantageous offer is that owner
and project manager before the tender process start can specify some planned
percentage parameters such as architecture, functionality and price to ﬁnd the best
counselling offer from the incoming offers.
Most economically advantageous offer has therefore the strength of giving the
opportunity to ﬁnd the best offer according to the planned weighting where the
weighting of price is reduced by focusing on, for example, softer parameters such
as architecture and functionality.
Lowest price is found to be the second most used assignment criterion in 13
(17.6 %) of the 74 cases and has the advantages of using the marked forces to
secure the total lowest price, but as earlier described in selection criteria the use of
market forces can give later project complication. This is why the combination
open procedure tender and lowest price should be carefully considered because the
chance that a counsellor will not have the right competencies and resources to
manage the construction project safely through increases.
To test if there is a signiﬁcant use of some assignment criteria and the different
construction counselling project types are the null hypothesis tested using a
Fisher’s exact test, where the null hypothesis was rejected by 0.028 = 0.05.
The rejecting demonstrates a signiﬁcant use of most economically advanta-
geous offer between the two project types, which is also percentages conﬁrmed by
looking at Table 2, where the two project segments restoration and maintenance
project by 21.4 % and new construction project by 42.9 % are using most eco-
nomically advantageous offer that could indicate a signiﬁcant use of that particular
assignment criterion.
The authors are not familiar with the exact reason for the signiﬁcant use of most
economically advantageous offer as assignment criterion in construction coun-
selling services, but one theory could be that using most economically advanta-
geous offer the owner and project manager secure that public construction projects
are both evaluated on price and also on a well-planned parameters such as
architecture and its compliance of other softer user demands, which can be
complicated to evaluate by the criterion lowest price.

3.3 Selection and Assignment Criteria
Looking at Table 3, the most used selection and assignment combination invited
tender with pre-qualiﬁcation and most economically advantageous offer used in
57.1 % of the involved tender cases regardless of project counselling types. This is
further supported by looking at the speciﬁc selection and assignment criterion for
the two project counselling types at Table 1 and Table 2 as earlier described in the
result section of the article.

The second most used tendering combination is found to be most economically
advantageous offer with lowest price as assignment criterion in 35.7 % of the cases,
which when looking at the two most used tendering combinations, both use the
same selection criterion invited tender with pre-qualiﬁcation in 92.8 % of the cases.
Finally, the third most used selection and assignment combination according to
Table 3 found to be open procedure tender and lowest price in 7.1 % of the cases.
The reason for low use of the third tendering combination is not known by authors,
but as earlier explained, there is some risks by choosing that combination.
To test if there was a signiﬁcant use of the selection criterion for open proce-
dure tender and invited tender with a pre-qualiﬁcation compared to the assignment
criterion most economically advantageous offer and lowest price the null
hypothesis was tested by a Fisher’s exact test, which conﬁrmed the null hypothesis
and therefore demonstrated no signiﬁcant use between the different selection and
assignment criteria, see Table 3.
4 Conclusion
The purpose of this paper was to study which selection and assignment criteria were
most used in public construction counselling services put out in European tendering,
how different types of construction counselling types are using selection and
assignment criteria and ﬁnally if there was any signiﬁcant use of some selection and
assignment combinations in Danish public construction counselling services.
During the data obtaining, 74 tender cases were identiﬁed and used in the
processing stage where it was found that invited tender with a pre-qualiﬁcation
process in 64 (86.5 %) of the 74 cases was the most used selection criterion
regardless of project type.

Hereafter, a Fisher’s exact test was conducted between counselling project type
and the two selection criteria used, where the null hypothesis was conﬁrmed by
0.6667 = 0.05 and therefore demonstrating no signiﬁcant use of invited tender
with pre-qualiﬁcation process. But by looking at 33.3 % of the restoration and
maintenance projects and 55.6 % of new construction project tender cases that use
invited tender with a pre-qualiﬁcation process as selection criterion could there be
a tentative indication of a signiﬁcant use of invited tender with a pre-qualiﬁcation
that was not possible to conﬁrm by a Fisher’s exact test based on incomplete data
from most of the tender cases.
Looking at the most used assignment criterion regardless of project type, it was
found to be most economically advantageous offer in 54 (73.0 %) of the 74 cases,
where
a
following

test
rejected
the
null
hypothesis

advantageous offer between the two project types. Thus is also percentages con-
ﬁrmed by the project segments restoration and maintenance project by 21.4 % and
new construction project by 42.9 % use most economically advantageous offer.
To test if there is a signiﬁcant use of some selection and assignment combi-
nation regardless of counselling project type, the tender cases’ selection and
assignment criteria were tested using a Fisher’s exact test where the null
hypothesis was conﬁrmed by 0.6429 = 0.05, and therefore not demonstrating a
signiﬁcant use of one tendering combination, but by looking at the percentages
distribution, the most used tendering in 57.1 % of the cases was invited tender with
a qualiﬁcation process as selection criterion and most economically advantageous

Delays in the Apparel Manufacturing
Industry’s Implementation of Mass
Customization
Jocelyn Bellemare, Serge Carrier and Pierre Baptiste
Abstract Past research has demonstrated the importance of understanding the
mass customization of clothing within the context of trade globalization, which has
led to ever more ferocious competition in the apparel industry. But, why is the
apparel manufacturing industry so late in understanding this? This paper outlines
and discusses the possible causes of the delays of mass customization in the
apparel and fashion industry. The study ﬁrst identiﬁes (based on a number of
interviews with apparel producers) the performance indicators and the integration
of technologies necessary for the implementation of a system of mass custom-
ization in the clothing industry. The interviews with these producers reveal certain
factors and characteristics that can explain this delay. The principal cause is the
lack of integration between technologies currently in place and those offered by
suppliers that do not adequately respond to the needs of manufacturers and
distributers.

1 Introduction
Although the role of clothing manufacturing has changed greatly over the past few
decades, the fashion and apparel industry still remain an important source of
economic activity and employment. Following sustained growth in the 1990s, the
industry is currently experiencing disruptions as a result of massive imports and
economic ﬂuctuations due to e-commerce in its primary markets. Signiﬁcant
breakthroughs by foreign-based newcomers to the industry have only added to
existing local competition. Moreover, as apparel products now seem to have an
ever-shorter life cycle, a phenomenon exacerbated by the introduction and
implementation of new business models, commercial strategies are facing
mounting pressure. This situation has forced all manufacturers to revise their
organizational strategies in order to survive in this highly competitive market.
In addition to this, apparel companies are busy adapting to all the technological
and managerial developments that have taken place in the last few years. Cus-
tomers’ expectations in terms of quality, cost, lead time, and service are constantly
on the rise, whereas proﬁts margins have steadily decreased over the past 20 years.
To compete, businesses must ﬁnd new approaches to product development and
marketing, such as reducing life cycle times, improving productivity, and rede-
ﬁning customer service. Hence, they have turned to technology to identify
potential new approaches to support their business strategies. Technology ﬁrms
smell the kill and multiply their promises on  sure bet  new products. Yet,
reality often is more down-to-earth; and businesses encounter a number of
obstacles on their road to reinvention.
Our research looks into the factors and industry characteristics in large part
explaining the apparel industry’s difﬁculties and lateness in implementing one of
the most important recent innovations: the mass customization of clothing prod-
ucts. We argue that one of the major difﬁculties arises from the lack of integration
between the technologies presently used by the industry and those offered by the
providers of new systems. The products offered do not meet the apparel manu-
facturers’ and distributors’ needs and expectations. Our interviews with different
stakeholders point to: (1) a lack of technological ﬂuency on the part of both
managers and labour, (2) a strong resistance to change in a very traditional
industry that still relies on outdated work habits, (3) a lack of proactivity and
implementation of strategic or technical watches, (4) minimal investment due in
part to the difﬁculties in borrowing money, and (5) the bad press often given to
technology and mass customization implementations by certain important industry
actors.
These ﬁndings should encourage the actors that make up this industry to
re-adjust. The above list of difﬁculties should also trigger a wake-up call to the
new reality in the clothing industry: more demanding consumers, globalized
markets, new technologies, etc. Apparel industry businesses must be proactive,
adopt, and adapt to new mind-sets and management tools to take full advantage of
information technologies. To successfully implement mass customization, it is of
94
J. Bellemare et al.

the utmost importance that they emphasize analysis, decision making, performance
evaluation, and added value. Indeed, ﬂexibility is a must as the market increasingly
expects it.
2 Literature
Reviewing the writings on this subject tells us that paradoxically, at a time where
the global key word in most industries is standardization, the focus in the apparel
industry is on ‘‘uniqueness.’’ Fashion is ﬁrst and foremost a subjective world;
consumers are ever more focused on their own needs and expectations and are
therefore resisting product standardization [22]. Hence, Piller [12] has identiﬁed
mass customization as an important development axis. Ashdown [2] conﬁrms that
consumer demand for mass-customized apparel is steadily growing and that the
capacity to fulﬁl this demand is made possible by new technologies and infor-
mation systems. Inala [7] states that mass customization is a highly competitive
strategy for organizations offering personalized products. The more the product
can be adapted to individuals’ requirements, the more competitive the seller can be
[8]. Yet, this requires a thorough understanding of consumers’ needs and wants.
Currently, some confusion still exists between personalization and mass cus-
tomization [4]. When garments were tailor-made, each individual piece was cut
and sewn for the eventual user; the garment was ﬁtted for a particular consumer
[23]. As Pine [14] states this was a hand-made and personalized production. Yet to
implement a mass customization program [24], one needs high-volume manu-
facturing operations based on ﬂexible processes enabling the producer to quickly
meet individual customers’ demands. As Pine [14] states the success of mass
customization is based on a complete integration of the value chain, which must
simultaneously perform on two opposing axes: (1) quick turnaround times for (2)
products meeting individual clients’ speciﬁcations.
Tian et al. [18] conﬁrm that consumers increasingly want a personal touch with
their garments to make them ‘‘unique.’’ Piller [13], they want to exhibit creativity
in all domains, particularly with furniture, automobiles, sports accessories, and
clothing. This is why, according to Pine [14], in such large markets, business must
incorporate mass customization in every step of the process, from a garment’s
conception to every aspect of its manufacture. But Agrawal et al. [1] see product
adaptation to individual consumers’ needs as mass customization’s main problem,
while Von Hippel [21] goes so far as to say that consumers’ lack of experience and
knowledge make them unable to know exactly what they really want or need. One
must therefore simplify and guide this demand. The information technologies used
must transform the masses of data into meaningful and understandable information
[2]. The objective is clearly to produce realistic garments, yet, the constraints make
a compromise between performance, realism, and technical characteristics very
difﬁcult. Some suggest that a product conﬁgurator may offer the solution.

3 Technological Solution
Many apparel businesses are currently researching technological ways to produce,
adjust, sell, and deliver, in a systematic and automatized fashion, personalized and
made-to measure products. Brown and Bessant [3] highlight that product conﬁ-
gurators, by determining the level of personalization offered, will play an
important role in supporting the mass customization paradigm. For Piller [12], the
ﬁrst objective of the conﬁgurator is to facilitate the consumer’s experience when
confronted with a Web site. The conﬁgurator is the bridge between the producer
and the consumer [7]. Over and above the product decision facilitating function,
the conﬁgurator should also lead to cost reductions [13] as it allows for time
savings when pacing and receiving orders.
A product conﬁgurator must be based on a strong technological platform in
order to enable a consumer/producer product co-design and co-production. It
operates as the interface between consumer and producer and must facilitate this
co-creation offering both parties a value-added proposition. At the present time,
the conﬁguration of a product that meets the client’s requirements is a complex
task requiring increased time and effort as the number of product options and
components increases. Kincade et al. [8] explain that, as the number of product
variations increases, the number of potential errors multiplies, production start-up
and lead times extend, and therefore, the number and cost of potential errors can
skyrocket. This same observation led Ashdown [2] to highlight the number of
challenges one has to currently face to produce a mass-customized garment. Ro-
goll and Piller [16], for their part, point to the fact that a conﬁgurator must ﬂuently
interface between different programming languages (different languages are often
used in programming for data acquisition from the consumer on the internet, for
pattern-making, laser cutting, etc.), yet they must also be fully autonomous. All
these human, technological, and product dimensions obviously make the devel-
opment of an apparel conﬁgurator all the more difﬁcult (Fig. 1).
Yet, development is only one part of the challenge: the apparel business must
then implement it at both the consumer input end and in production processes.
Henderson and Venkatraman [6] point to the fact that performance indicators
become all the more important as they offer managers the tools to evaluate whether
objectives are met (both short- and long-term). Rogers [15] adds some precision to
this point in identifying two types of indicators necessary to evaluate implemen-
tation: performance indicators and integration indicators.
One must remember that an apparel producer may perform well, yet be deﬁ-
cient in terms of integration of its technologies (i.e. using highly effective and
efﬁcient processes and offering a well-adapted product, yet arriving at this result
due to the quality of a company’s personnel, resources, and historical management
approaches). Performance indicators (stock rotation, return percentage, number of
complaints, etc.) enable organizations to know if they are meeting their goals and
objectives. They provide information on the efﬁciency and effectiveness of the use
of resources, whereas integration indicators provide a reading of the adjustment in
96
J. Bellemare et al.

the technologies used to attain the organization’s goals and objectives. They help
technology suppliers in ﬁne-tuning their offers to the needs of the apparel
producer.
Venkatraman [20] tells us that when business processes and technologies are
well adjusted, managers and employees develop a better attitude towards new
technologies and a greater openness to mass customization [13]. Thus, our
research focuses on the link between business processes (order management,
production, distribution, etc.) and technologies currently in use or intended to be
implemented. We purport that this will enable us to better comprehend the
slowness of apparel producers in adopting technologies to facilitate mass
customization.
4 Methodology
Having observed that, despite numerous opportunities, apparel manufacturers have
been rather reluctant to adopt mass customization, our research aims at better
understanding the apparel producers’ use of the most up-to-date technologies in
their overall business and decision-making processes. The basic selection criterion
for such producers to participate in the research was an expression of interest in
developing a mass customization project within the next 10 years. Hence, they
must plan on coupling mass customization technologies to their current processes
and technologies. The research comprises 20 producers. The interviews and
questionnaires used focus on understanding their current systems/technologies
integration and the variations found in this aspect within the industry. The ques-
tionnaires were handed out on a one-to-one basis and/or sent via e-mail. We also
conducted lengthy interviews with three technology suppliers in order to under-
stand their perspectives in terms of technology products/services currently avail-
able on the market.

5 Conceptual Framework
The primary objectives of the survey focuses on the integration of new technol-
ogies within the operations of clothing manufacturers who wish to implement mass
customization. More than just simply recognizing the concept, this will allow us to
evaluate whether the available performance and technology integration indicators,
touted by the equipment and software companies and presented as important
management and development tools, have any effect on the business processes
used in manufacturing, distribution, and general management. This will help us
understand the elements leading to delays in implementing mass customization in
the apparel industry from a technological point of view.
Thus, we asked three speciﬁc questions in our study. First, we wanted to know
if the level of current results highlighted by the performance and integration
indicators (on a scale from high to low) had an impact on the management’s
attitude towards technology and innovation as well as its intention to pursue mass
customization. Second, we wondered whether the results on the indicators
employed (performance and integration) had an effect on the business processes.
Third, we wanted to know what effects the management, manufacturing and dis-
tribution processes in place had on the management’s attitude towards technology,
innovation, and intention to pursue mass customization.
Figure 2 presents the technology’s performance and integration indicators that
we position as our independent variables in the model. These indicators focus on
the most important areas of improvement put forward by technology and services
suppliers to the apparel industry.
Our three dependant variables consist in three types of reactions frequently
found in operations management regarding the effects of technology, namely:
attitudes towards technology [19], attitudes towards innovation [10, 11, 15, 20],
and the actual intention to utilize mass customization [5, 9, 14, 17].
The integration of the existing business processes’ impact, on attitudes and
intention, to predict and explain the impacts of the indicators stems from to the
ﬁndings of Henderson and Venkatraman [6] who state that it is through these
business processes that the manufacturer is able to form a concrete idea of the level
of integration and performance of a particular technology, whether already
implemented or yet to be implemented.
6 Results of the Indicators
The ﬁrst element of our research deals with the producers’ current use of tech-
nology, as well as the performance indicators used. Our results show that the
performance indicators perceived as the most signiﬁcant are those that focus on
data transfer technologies such as EDI, RFID, and bar codes.
Our respondents indicate that technologies that better enable sourcing, pro-
duction, and distribution operations management will have an immediate impact
98
J. Bellemare et al.

on business processes, and that both upstream (suppliers) and downstream (dis-
tributors, retailers) business partners require their use.
Yet, our research results also show that the critical integration indicators focus
on other technologies such as ERP, SCM, EMS, all of which emphasize the
optimization of internal processes. Our respondents conﬁrm that implementing and
using such technologies would require major changes within an organization’s
management systems. Some also stated that this implementation often takes quite a
bit of time, yet does not bring the expected results.
Our results show that 61 % of organizations use relatively non-integrated
technological systems and that their performance indicators are inadequate.
Moreover, 12 % conﬁrm that their existing technological systems are ‘‘heavy’’ and
hard to manage, and that they present a poor ﬁt with the structure in place in terms
of performance and process integration.
Table 1 shows the results of the performance and integration indicator levels
for the 20 manufacturers surveyed, on a scale of 1–10 (10 being the highest
relative impact).
Figure 3 presents the manufacturers’ evaluations of both performance and
integration indicators used in operations management on the impacts of technology
with respect to our three dependant variables: attitude towards technology, attitude
towards innovation, and intention to implement mass customization.
Another notable feature is the lack of innovation, which is not merely a question
of technology, according to the suppliers, but is also (and primarily) based on efﬁ-
cient work habits cultivated by motivated and experienced teams—a distinctive set
of traits possessed by the workforce of any successful organization. Thus, it appears
that the lack of information sharing and best practices within the apparel industry is a
crucial problem. We have witnessed that decisions are often made at the last minute
and that crisis management is a permanent condition. Indeed, many companies have
serious problems with management, control, and responsiveness due to an obvious
lack of vision within organizations, both internally and externally.

Only two out of 20 respondents said they were satisﬁed with the systems in
place and are ready to continue to implement mass customization. Technology
suppliers also stated that organizations need to better understand that technology is
not an end in itself but requires massive ﬁnancial and personnel investments.
7 What is Mass Customization?
The concept of mass customization as a principle of widespread personalization
via the internet seriously puts into question traditional manufacturing techniques
and production methods. We asked the following question in our survey:
‘‘According to you, what is the minimum number of units necessary for custom-
ization to become ‘mass customization’?’’ The responses vary widely according to
the experience of the manufacturers. According to them, on average they must
have the capacity to produce at least 200 units that respect the customers’ quality
requirements for it to constitute mass customization. The following table presents
the results of this question in our survey (Fig. 4).

Below 200, we can say that we are in the territory of artisanal or ‘‘craft’’
production. It thus follows that several companies currently offering mass-cus-
tomized products on the web do not have this capability within their business
model, which renders them particularly vulnerable in terms of proﬁtability.
8 Perspectives and Limits
Our research validates the idea that the use of performance and integration indi-
cators has a direct and signiﬁcant impact on the implementation of a mass cus-
tomization strategy. It also highlights that this observation is in great part due to a
fundamental cultural problem. The industry is comprised of a large number of
family businesses, managed in a more or less autocratic manner not very condu-
cive to market adaptation and the implementation of revolutionary technologies.
Indeed, for these companies, technological innovation is seldom a priority. The
generally limited education level of the apparel producers’ managers leads to a
lack of competencies, of market knowledge, and ultimately of leadership.
Our research shows that apparel producers seldom have a strategic plan and that
even fewer invest in a strategic watch, and the information systems in place are
often deﬁcient and poorly integrated with the rest of the ﬁrm’s activities. One
cannot help but notice a strong reluctance to change, along with a lack of vision on
the part of higher management.
We also have to underline that our research has a number of limits which,
viewed more positively, constitute avenues for future research. First, we decided
not to consider certain characteristics and traits among producers’ and/or man-
agers’ that may have an impact on technology adoption (e.g. size of the organi-
zation, other market strategies, etc.). Second, our research examined only one
subset of one speciﬁc sector, which undoubtedly had an impact on its external
validity.

9 Conclusion
This study conﬁrmed that performance and integration indicators had a signiﬁcant
effect on the implementation of mass customization, as seen in the responses to our
survey questions. They have also helped us understand the factors and charac-
teristics that lead to signiﬁcant delays in the fashion and apparel industry regarding
the adoption of such systems from a technological, organizational, and strategic
point of view. Our interviews have conﬁrmed that for the concept of ‘‘mass cus-
tomization’’ to operate, there must be signiﬁcant investments made in information
decoding and data mining, as well as in all aspects of understanding client rela-
tions, as consumers have increasingly less time to spend shopping and at the same
time have more demands and needs.
We remain surprised that the results of our interviews and surveys indicate a
strong resistance to the introduction of mass customization among manufacturers
who want to put in place an element of personalization. However, these results also
give us the opportunity to provide valuable information to develop a mass cus-
tomization program for the garment industry. An analysis of the results allows us
to identify ﬁve major components that will potentially be useful for such a pro-
gram: the fostering of a culture of innovation, improved organization, vision,
implementation, as well as conﬁguration and design.
Mass customization offers a number of innovation possibilities and may con-
stitute a major opportunity for some apparel industry players. To take advantage of
this opportunity, the order givers will have to better understand what is possible in
terms of product personalization and on-demand garment production. They will
need to radically rethink their marketing and production strategies, remembering
always that mass customization must start with consumers, involving them in both
product design and production.
Nor should mass customization be considered strictly as a short-term marketing
strategy. It may lead to signiﬁcant cost savings for the producer and greater supply
chain integration. It may also provide producers with a better understanding of
their consumers, their preferences and wider opportunities for market segmenta-
tion. Taking the mass customization route is an avenue to create new opportuni-
ties, to give a competitive advantage and a better position to an organization within
the global market.
It may be true that the western apparel industry cannot currently compete with
producers from ‘‘emerging’’ countries in terms of costs, but a technology-based
strategy may yet offer deﬁnite advantages.

Describing Product Variety
Using Set Theory

Abstract Three capabilities: solution space development, robust process design,
and choice navigation are critical for mass customizers. In order to become and
stay competitive, it is proposed to establish assessment methods for these capa-
bilities. This paper investigates the usage of set theory as a means for developing
metrics and assessment systems. It is concluded that set theory cannot be used as
an assessment method directly but is useful in the development of metrics.

1 Introduction
In any company, it is essential to offer products that match the needs and desires of
customers to achieve sales and proﬁt. This is true for mass producers as well as
mass customizers; however, in mass customization, this issue is somewhat more
complex than mass production due to a much higher variety and a more complex
product structure. As pointed out by Salvador et al. [4]., mass customizers need
three fundamental capabilities to be successful: (1) solution space development—
identifying the attributes along which customer needs diverge, (2) robust process
design—reusing or recombining existing organizational and value chain resources
to fulﬁll a stream of differentiated customer needs and (3) choice navigation—
supporting customers in identifying their own solutions while minimizing com-
plexity and the burden of choice [2, 4].

In order for companies to be able to establish themselves as mass customizers
or for existing mass customizers to improve performance, it is proposed that a set
of metrics for assessing the three capabilities is developed. However, in order to
formulate these metrics, it should be possible to deﬁne the ideal scenario for mass
customization. An essential concept in mass customization is product variety.
Variety is what differentiates mass customization from other business strategies;
however, the variety offered to the customer, the solution space, must be carefully
designed, since a too high variety will imply higher costs and a too low variety will
imply lost sales, since customers will not be able to buy the product matching their
individual requirements [3]. In order to describe the product variety and to
describe the ideal situation for mass customizers, in this paper, we describe
product variety using set theory. The research question for this paper is thus:
How can sets be used to describe product variety supporting assessment of the
three MC capabilities?
In the following sections, the different sets that can be used to describe variety
in a mass customization company are deﬁned, and following this, the intersections
of the different sets are analyzed to identify the ideal scenario and identify which
scenarios may be suboptimal.
2 Representing Variety as Sets
In this paper, we use set theory to represent product variety. When describing
variety as a set, it should be deﬁned what an element in the set corresponds to. One
possibility would be that each element in the sets will correspond to a unique
product variant. Following this, each possible combination of conﬁguration
choices would correspond to a variant and thus an element in the set. However, for
most mass customization product families, the number of elements becomes
astronomical due to numerous conﬁguration variables each with a number of
outcomes. For example, when conﬁguring a Mini Cooper online, the conﬁguration
choices presented to the customer will result in a number of possible variants well
above a 20 digit ﬁgure. This is obviously signiﬁcantly more than the potential
market of the Mini Cooper. Assuming that the sale of Mini Coopers is a good
representation of the demanded variety, and the Mini Cooper has sold a few
million cars and assuming that each sold Mini Cooper is unique, the customer
demanded variety will still only be a tiny fraction of the offered variety. Fur-
thermore, we would expect that assessing whether single variants would counter a
demand from a customer is simply not possible if the number of variants is high.
Thus, it would seem that variants deﬁned as all possible combinations of conﬁg-
uration variables is not an appropriate way to deﬁne product variety.
A more simple and comprehensible way of representing the sets may be
deﬁning the elements of the sets as the ‘‘dimensions of customization.’’ If a
product has a number of customizable attributes and each attribute has a ﬁnite
106
T. D. Brunoe et al.

number of values that can be chosen, each value will correspond to a product
property, which can potentially be demanded by a customer.
Figure 1 illustrates a set describing the variety, using a ﬁctive example of a
customizable shirt with four customizable attributes, from where ﬁve different
colors, ﬁve different sizes, two different sleeve lengths, and three different prints
can be chosen. Each element in the set corresponds to one value of a customizable
attribute, e.g., the attribute ‘‘Color’’ having the value ‘‘Blue.’’
If the elements in the set had been each combination of the different outcomes
of all variables, the set would have 150 elements, making it less comprehensible
than what is illustrated in the ﬁgure. While 150 elements may not seem like much,
the complexity increases exponentially as more conﬁguration choices are intro-
duced, as with the Mini Cooper for example presented above.
3 Solution Space
Salvador et al. [4] described the capability ‘‘solution space’’ of a company as the
ability to ‘‘identify the idiosyncratic needs of its customers’’ and deﬁning the
‘‘solution space’’ that ‘‘clearly delineates what it will offer and what it will not.’’
Hence, the solution space can be interpreted as the initial decision of the company
regarding what variety should be offered to the customer. However, a number of
processes must be undertaken, from deciding what to offer, until a product is sold
to an end customer each representing the solution space. Within each of these
processes, changes to the solution space may occur. We assume that most mass
customizers will follow the processes illustrated in Fig. 2 or a similar variation in
these processes [1].
The variety of planning process is similar to general product planning, and in
this phase, the company identiﬁes customer needs and decides on what to offer the
customer. The output of this process we deﬁne as ‘‘initially deﬁned variety.’’ In
the following process, the actual product design and development take place and
Fig. 1 Illustration of an
example of variety

107

the ‘‘initially deﬁned variety’’ is basically a requirement speciﬁcation for this
process. Ideally, the output of this process should be a product family design that
perfectly reﬂects the ‘‘initially deﬁned variety,’’ however, for various reasons, the
product design may differ from this by either offering more options to choose from
or fewer options, which could be due to cost or time constraints in the development
project. The output of this process is deﬁned as ‘‘designed variety.’’
Once the product design process is ﬁnished, production preparation must take
place to ensure that all variants can be manufactured and tools and materials are in
place prior to production ramp-up. Again, ideally the output of this process should
reﬂect both ‘‘initially deﬁned variety’’ and ‘‘designed variety,’’ however, this may
also differ. We deﬁne the output of this process as the set ‘‘manufacturable vari-
ety.’’ This set may be smaller than the previous sets, in case the manufacturing
capabilities are not sufﬁcient to produce the designed variety, however, the set may
also be larger if the manufacturing system offers greater ﬂexibility than required.
Finally, before a product family can be offered to the customers, the company
must typically develop a product conﬁgurator, the tool in which customers select
and conﬁgure the product matching their requirements. The set of products that is
possible to conﬁgure in the ﬁnished conﬁgurator offered to the customers is
deﬁned as ‘‘conﬁgurable variety.’’ The ‘‘conﬁgurable variety’’ set should corre-
spond to the ‘‘designed variety’’ adjusted for variety that cannot be manufactured
and is thus not present in the ‘‘manufacturable variety’’ set. However, if the
speciﬁcation of the variety has errors or if the programming of the conﬁgurator has
errors, this will not be the case.

variety

As illustrated in the Fig. 3, the four sets deﬁned will intersect each other.
Ideally, the four sets are completely convergent; however, as described above due
to different reasons, this may not always be the case. In most cases, the ‘‘initially
described variety,’’ ‘‘designed variety,’’ and ‘‘conﬁgurable variety’’ will be almost
convergent, but these sets will be subsets of the manufacturable variety, since
manufacturing capabilities will usually be more ﬂexible than actually demanded as
they may be used to manufacture other products than the products in question here.
What can be concluded on the above is that the term ‘‘solution space’’ may be
interpreted in a number of different ways. All the sets deﬁned above represent the
solution space; however, at different points in time. Ideally, the four sets should
contain the same variety; however, due to the reasons described above this is not
always the case, and when referring to solution space, it is relevant to indicate at
what state the solution space is. As the two ‘‘states’’ of solution space ‘‘manu-
facturable variety’’ and ‘‘conﬁgurable variety’’ are the sets that are immediately
relevant to end customers, these are the two sets that will be considered in the
remainder of this paper.
4 Variety from a Conﬁguration System View
The set ‘‘conﬁgurable variety’’ describes which variety is possible to conﬁgure, but
does not address what variety is actually conﬁgured by customers during the sales
process. However, if variety is present in the conﬁguration system, but it is never
conﬁgured, then it brings no value to the customer and is thereby unnecessary.
We therefore, introduce a set, called ‘‘conﬁgured variety,’’ which contains all
variety which until a point in time has been conﬁgured. ‘‘Conﬁgured variety’’ will
by deﬁnition be a subset of conﬁgurable variety, since it is not possible to con-
ﬁgure any variety outside the set ‘‘conﬁgurable variety.’’
Fig. 3 Illustration of the four
sets as output of the
development process

109

However, even if certain variety has been conﬁgured by a customer does not
imply that this variety is actually sold. Conﬁgurations are often made and then
abandoned. On the contrary, variety that is sold must ﬁrst be conﬁgured. This leads
to the introduction of another set ‘‘ordered variety,’’ which again is a subset of the
set ‘‘conﬁgured variety.’’ The relations of the three introduced sets are illustrated
in the Venn diagram in Fig. 4.
5 Customer Demanded Variety
Since one of the fundamental capabilities in mass customization ‘‘solution space
development,’’ concerns identifying the idiosyncratic need of the customers,
another perspective of variety is highly relevant—the variety that is actually
demanded by customers. For this reason, we introduce the set ‘‘customer
demanded variety.’’
Whereas the previously introduced sets are in theory easily identiﬁed by a
company, since they relate to data created by the company, ‘‘customer demanded
variety’’ is less trivial.
Each element of this set would be a current or future demand for a certain
product property from any customer. Identifying each element in this set is in
reality impossible. This would require identifying each potential customer and
having these describe their future demands for a speciﬁc product type. Although it
is impossible to deﬁne each element of the set ‘‘customer demanded variety,’’ it is
very important to address this set, since the elements in this set is what determines
success or failure for a future mass customized product.

6 Intersections and Subsets
In order to evaluate to what extent set theory can be used to evaluate mass
customization capabilities, the intersections and subsets of the sets introduced
earlier are analyzed. The sets are numbered in the Fig. 5 for easier reference in the
text in Table 1.
6.1 Relation Between Sets and Capabilities
Since the purpose of this paper is to evaluate whether using set theory can be
utilized to evaluate mass customization, all the sets presented above have been
analyzed to identify what deﬁciencies in capabilities may result in elements
present in each set. These relations are indicated by an X.
As it can be seen from the Table 2, set one implies no issues in relation to the
three fundamental capabilities. However, all other sets indicate some sort of issue
that can be attributed to one or more of the capabilities. Furthermore, it can be seen
that choice navigation and robust process design may be difﬁcult to distinguish
between by observing the sets, since many sets relate to both capabilities.

Table 1 Evaluation of intersections and subsets of mass customization capabilities
Set Characteristics
1
This intersection is the ‘‘sweet spot’’ of mass customization, since this is where there is a
customer demand for a speciﬁc option, it is conﬁgured and sold and it can be
manufactured by the mass customizer. This can be said to be the ideal scenario of mass
customization
2
In this intersection, there is a customer demand for a speciﬁc option, which is also conﬁgured
and sold. However, since the option is outside the manufacturable variety, the mass
customizer will not be able to actually deliver the product containing this option. This
would require the mass customizer to either cancel the order or change the conﬁguration
to ﬁt the conﬁgurable variety, possibly changing the characteristics of the product
compared to what was actually desired by the customer
3
In intersection 3, an option is conﬁgured, sold, and manufactured; however, is outside the
manufacturable variety. This implies that a customer has purchased a product with
undesired characteristics. This may ultimately lead to unsatisﬁed customers and possibly
customers returning products to the manufacturer, since it does not meet expectations
4
Here, an option is sold, for which there is no demand and cannot be manufactured. Since the
product cannot be manufactured, the customer will never receive the product, and what
happens in this scenario is hence similar to intersection 2
5
In this set, an option is conﬁgured, but never ordered. Also it is outside what can be
manufactured and outside the customer demand. However, since the customer does not
order the product, as the conﬁguration is abandoned, possibly due to the fact that the
conﬁguration does not correspond to the demanded variety, no order needs to be canceled
6
Here, a conﬁguration is performed outside the manufacturable variety but within the
demanded variety. The conﬁguration is not ordered, although it is within the demanded
variety, so the order does not need to be canceled, which would be the case if the
conﬁguration was ordered
7
Here, a conﬁguration is performed, which can be manufactured and is in the customer
demanded variety. However, the conﬁguration is abandoned and thus not ordered. This
could be due to the customer not being able to perform the conﬁguration or get the
necessary information about the product, thus canceling the conﬁguration instead, i.e.,
improved choice navigation could have implied that elements from set 7 moved to set 1
increasing sales
8
Here, a conﬁguration is performed, which is outside the customer demanded variety but
within the manufacturable variety and the conﬁguration is not ordered. This could be due
to the customer not being able to ﬁnd the option required. Hence, no matter the
performance of choice navigation, this conﬁguration would not lead to a sale
9
This set contains options that can be conﬁgured and are outside the demanded variety and
cannot be manufactured. Since it cannot be manufactured, it is a result of a faulty
implementation of a product conﬁgurator, however, it has no consequence as it is never
conﬁgured
10
This set contains options that can be conﬁgured, have a demand, but are outside the
manufacturable variety. As with set number 9, this is a result of a faulty implementation
and since it is within the customer demanded variety, there is a risk that a customer will
conﬁgure and order it, but in that case, the company would need to cancel the order as it
cannot be manufactured

7 Discussion and Conclusion
The aim of this paper was to investigate if observing different sets representing
product variety in different ways could contribute to assessing the three funda-
mental mass customization capabilities ‘‘solution space development,’’ ‘‘robust
process design,’’ and ‘‘choice navigation.’’ By populating the generic sets with
elements of ‘‘conﬁguration options,’’ an element present in a speciﬁc subset or
intersection would according to Table 1 indicate an issue within one or two of the
capabilities. Hence, it can be concluded that using set theory to describe variety
can be helpful toward assessing mass customization capabilities. There are,
however, a number of issues that need to be considered doing this.
To perform an analysis of the sets in real life, historical data would need to be
present, at least to represent what has been conﬁgured and what has been ordered.
This data would need to be registered over a period of time. Within this time
span, certain conﬁguration options may move from one set to another, if e.g., the
Table 1 (continued)
Set Characteristics
11
In this set, there is a match between what is demanded, what can be manufactured, and what
can be conﬁgured. However, since no customers actually conﬁgure this option,
something is keeping them from choosing from this variety. This could be a result of bad
choice navigation performance and would indicate a potential for increased sales, if
choice navigation was improved moving elements from set 11 to set 1
12
This set contains variety, which can be manufactured and conﬁgured, but is outside the
customer demand and is never conﬁgured. This is thus unnecessary variety and could be
removed from the product portfolio with no consequence
13
Set 13 contains unfulﬁlled customer demanded variety. This variety cannot be conﬁgured
and cannot be manufactured. This variety is thus potential new business for mass
customizer; however, it may be very difﬁcult to identify
14
In this set, there is a match between the variety, which can be manufactured and the variety
that is demanded. However, since it is outside the conﬁgurable variety, customers are not
able to conﬁgure and order the product and this is thus an unfulﬁlled business potential.
There may be a reason for the company not offering this variety in a conﬁgurator;
however, it is likely that the reason for it not being offered is a faulty conﬁgurator
implementation
15
Set 15 contains variety that can be manufactured, but is not demanded and not possible to
conﬁgure. This is thus a result of developing products and manufacturing capabilities that
is not utilized

conﬁgurable variety is changed or manufacturing capabilities are changed. Fur-
thermore, using set theory on ‘‘conﬁguration options’’ will not distinguish whether
a certain choice has been made once or one million times. If an assessment method
is based purely on set theory this would likely be an issue, since including certain
variety would appear equally proﬁtable no matter how frequently it is sold. Hence,
set theory appears to be useful for developing metrics for assessing mass cus-
tomization capabilities; however, evaluating solely on the number of elements in
certain sets is likely not a viable approach.

Design and Evaluation of a Reconﬁgurable
Manufacturing System
By the Use of the 2D/3D Computer Simulation
Shuai Zhang, Yang Li, Arne Bilberg and Ronen Hadar
Abstract In modern manufacturing industry, reconﬁgurable manufacturing sys-
tem (RMS) is a promising concept in the research arena. A new RMS system
structure has been recently designed by a large consumer goods manufacturer in
Europe, aiming to improve its production efﬁciency. This paper shows an
exploratory research on the (re)conﬁguration procedure and evaluation of the RMS
philosophy based on the new RMS structure, which is part of the RMS research in
University of Southern Denmark. Tecnomatix Plant Simulation is used for system
analysis and optimization. Results from simulation show that the RMS imple-
mented in this consumer goods manufacturer can be effectively (re)conﬁgured as
part of the daily operations, and the conﬁguration is analyzed by computer sim-
ulation before release. Flexibility can be increased considerably meanwhile the
system can maintain an acceptable productivity.

1 Introduction
With the progress of globalization, it is well recognized that the manufacturing
industry is facing new challenges, include ﬁerce competition, turbulent market
demand, more complex product management, highly customized product, etc. [1].
This trend has forced industrial companies to embrace more ﬂexibility, adapt-
ability, and responsiveness on their manufacturing system. Dedicated manufac-
turing lines (DML) have the advantages with high productivity and low unit cost
yet its adaptability is low. To ramp-up a DML dynamically is very expensive and
time-consuming. The use of ﬂexible manufacturing system (FMS) shows advan-
tages when producing highly customized products. FMS is often composed of
computerized numerical control (CNC) machine units, and the productivity of
FMS is not sufﬁcient for mass customization. Under such circumstances, a cost-
effective, productive manufacturing system with the ability to rapid change is
crucial to the industry [2–4]. Koren and Mehrabi have introduced a concept of
reconﬁgurable manufacturing system (RMS), and six core characteristics of RMS
have been summarized as modularity, integrability, customization, scalability,
convertibility, and diagnosability. Based on the principles of RMS, a consumer
goods manufacturer in Europe (note as CGM in this paper) has designed a new
RMS structure (named RMS-L in this paper) to address its own manufacturing
problems between productivity and ﬂexibility. The current manufacturing line in
CGM is generally a DML. CGM investigated the RMS concept within an indus-
trial perspective and decided to use computer simulation to exam the performance
of the concept without having to invest in any hardware [5]. In addition, a research
group has been established to simulate and evaluate the reconﬁgurable assembly
system of CGM.
RMS-L is constructed by modular base units with dedicated tools and con-
veyors installed on top [5]. The structure of one modular base unit is shown in
Fig. 1 (left). Up to four conveyers could be installed on the top of the base unit
pointing at four directions. The conveyors can transfer materials forward or
backward. The centerpiece (round area in the center) is used to deliver elements in
the system to a desired direction. The four red bars placed above the conveyers
represent the positions for tools to be installed, and only one tool at one position.
The base units could work individually and autonomously or could be easily
connected and work cooperatively as a bigger system. Usually, the RMS-L need to
be reconﬁgured according to the requirement of the different production processes.
The reconﬁguration process could happen on tools level (only change the tools) or
on a system level (change the layout of base units). Figure 1 (right) illustrates
some possible conﬁgurations of RMS-L on the system level. 3D models of the
RMS-L have been created using the computer simulation, see Fig. 2. They are
116
S. Zhang et al.

built based on corresponding 2D models, which are used for system analysis. 3D
simulation shows how the system is actually working, facilitating the discussion
between colleagues and system designers. Moreover, it could give suggestions to
the factory layout designers on the use of space and other resources. This article
attempts to explore the system conﬁguration and to evaluate the performance of
the new RMS (RMS-L) in CGM.
2 Method Exploration
Based on the conﬁguration procedure proposed by Koren and Shpitalni [1], a
possible conﬁguration procedure for RMS-L is developed in this section. This
procedure is applied during operation while producing a single product type (see
Fig. 3 shows).
2.1 Calculating Minimum Number of Tools
Based on the tact time constraints, the minimum tools calculation for each process
can be preliminarily decided. For further illustration, a practical and simple
example is introduced. There are four processes in a manufacturing task (polish,
Fig. 1 RMS-L base unit and possible RMS-L conﬁgurations

decoration, assembly, and test). Daily demand of the product is e.g., 10,000 pcs,
and the system can operate continuously for 8 h per day. The data for the system
are mean values, and the real times might vary stochastically to some extent, yet
have little inﬂuence here to the elaboration of the conﬁguration method.
According to the manufacturing requirement, the tact time is 2.88 s, thus more
tools need to be integrated into the system to reduce the cycle time of each process
down to 2.88 s. Theoretically, eight tools are needed in the system (see Table 1).
With eight tools, the system can theoretically reach the pulse time of 2 s. In
such case, the total daily throughput could be 14,400. However, considering the
complexity of the RMS-L structure and the inﬂuence of the transit system (con-
veyers and centerpieces) and the availability of the whole system, the actual
conﬁguration might not be able to achieve the exact cycle time for each process.
Thus, it is still difﬁcult to decide whether the conﬁguration with eight tools could
accomplish the manufacturing task.
2.2 Analysis of Alternative Conﬁgurations
Figure 4a shows the basic RMS-L conﬁguration, which contains only one tool for
each of the four processes. The black arrows indicate the material ﬂow. Due to the
ﬂexible structure of the RMS-L, the conﬁguration based on the tools allocation in
Table 1 could be various. Figure 4b shows one of the conﬁgurations that strictly
follow the tools allocation table.

This conﬁguration may have the capability for accomplishing the production
task, however, redundancy exists in the system since three base units are working
only as conveyers without any tools installed. Usually, one base unit might be
much more costly than a single tool. Thus, it might be more cost-effective to use as
few base units as possible. Based on conﬁguration (b), two other conﬁgurations are
designed as alternatives, Fig. 4c and d. Conﬁguration (c) has saved one base unit at
the expense of one more assembly tool, compared with (b). As for (d), two base
units are saved at the expense of two more assembly tools. In a situation where
there are no more than ﬁve available base units but enough assembly tools, con-
ﬁguration (d) would absolutely be the best choice.
The analysis of the conﬁgurations above is based on an ideal environment where
transit system (conveyers and centerpiece) can run fast enough and have little
inﬂuence on the performance of the whole system. However, in real-life manu-
facturing system, the transit system may have considerable impact on the perfor-
mance of the whole system, especially when the tools are acting so quickly that time
spent on a tool is close or even less than time spent on jointed conveyers. Computer
simulation is essential to make sure that the system has the capacity to meet daily
demand, especially when the whole system is considerably complicated.
2.3 Computer Simulation and Analysis
Computer simulation gives the opportunity to test alternative solutions and to ﬁnd
the optimal one in a cost-effective way, since the real-life testing can be time-
consuming and costly and mathematical ways can be very complicated to involve

all factors. Computer simulation result shows that the system pulse time of the four
conﬁgurations in Fig. 4 are 6.0, 2.7, 2.5 and 2.1 s, respectively. Thus, conﬁgura-
tion b, c, and d can all accomplish the production goal since their pulse times are
less than the required tact time (2.88 s). However, conﬁguration b actually needs
more base units (seven units) with fewer tools (eight tools) than conﬁgurations c
and d. The availability of the tools or the base units should be considered when
deciding which conﬁguration to use. By contrast, conﬁguration d is probably a
better choice as it runs faster than other conﬁgurations with the least base units
(usually base units are more costly than tools). Besides, the difference in pulse
times between conﬁguration b, c, and d also reﬂects the inﬂuence of transit system
(conveyors and centerpieces), showing that the reduction in extra transportation
could increase the productivity considerably in this case.
When the conﬁguration model has been built and capacity has been proved
adequate for the production task, it is necessary to know in detail how the system
actually works and whether the system or the material ﬂow is actually balanced. A
balanced system with properly allocated material ﬂow will contribute to the sta-
bility and sustainability of the system (See e.g., [6]). With the help of speciﬁc
analysis tools in computer simulation, the RMS-L system can be adjusted to its
best working state and the performance can be optimized.
2.4 Making the Final Choice
Following the procedures, probably only a few conﬁguration options are left.
Accordingly, some practical factors might be considered to make the ﬁnal choice.
Some possible factors could be as follows:
1. The availability of tools or base units
2. The cost to run an extra base unit or an additional tool
3. The cost of making new tools or base units, on both monetary and time aspects
4. The space availability.
The decision maker should consider the weight of each factor speciﬁcally in the
manufacturing situation, decide which factor would be the most important one for
the company, and make the decision accordingly. In the example case, conﬁgu-
ration d has a pulse time of 2.1 s, which means its productivity is much higher than
that of conﬁguration b and c, showing better adaptability to the environment.
Besides, less base units means less operating costs. Thus, conﬁguration d would be
the best choice.

2.5 RMS-L (re)Conﬁguration in Multiproduct
Manufacturing Task
Procedures above demonstrate how to conﬁgure an RMS-L system when the
product demand and time limitation are given as constraints for producing one
product type. When dealing with more product types, it will be more complicated
since each product may probably need one unique conﬁguration. One possible
method is to divide the total available time into several slots and assign each one
slot to each product. With the number limit and the time limit assigned, the
conﬁguration for each product can be built according to the previous procedures.
However, the length of timeslot is challenging to deﬁne and it can potentially
cause waste and unnecessary difﬁculties. Another possible way is to test the
alternative conﬁgurations individually, which is actually feasible with the help of
computer simulation. The procedures can be depicted in a ﬂow chart (see Fig. 5).
Basic conﬁguration is the conﬁguration with only one processing tool for each
process. Starting from the basic conﬁgurations, all possible systems would be
easily simulated and tested by computer simulation, until the proper ones are
found. According to the procedure shown in Fig. 5, the systems are up scaled in an
order depending on relative system potentials. When considering the potential of
one-speciﬁc conﬁguration to be up scaled, several factors can be considered:
1. The complexity of the conﬁguration: the one with simplest conﬁguration has
the priority.

121

2. The relative time consumption of each process: the bigger time difference exists
between processes, the more potential the corresponding production system has.
3. The total time consumption for producing some type of product: the one with
longest production time based on the basic conﬁgurations simulation has the
priority.
The three factors are listed in a sequence that is from the one with most
signiﬁcance to the one with the less, according to experiences acquired from the
research. However, the sequence could be different in speciﬁc situations, and more
research is expected in this area in the future.
3 Performance Measurement for RMS
3.1 Measurement Model Design
Based on the performance measurement research (See e.g., [7, 8], this paper
designed a simple model to evaluate the productivity and ﬂexibility performance
of RMS-L.
1. Productivity measurement
Two metrics about productivity are involved, namely pulse time and produc-
tivity rate.
The productivity rate is deﬁned in this paper as:
In the test period,
total output
the input cost
ð1Þ
where input cost includes labor cost, raw material cost, overhead cost; and
depreciation cost.
2. Flexibility measurement
The measurement of ﬂexibility consists of two different types of ﬂexibility,
namely product ﬂexibility and adaptability.
The product ﬂexibility is in the test period,
times of changeover

The adaptability is

3.2 Test Scenario Design
The evaluation is based on a real case example in CGM, where a products family
(three products A, B, and C with similar manufacturing processes) need to
assembled and delivered for sale as a pack. Two scenarios are used in the process
of performance measurement. Firstly, this paper attempts to investigate and
quantify the comparison between RMS-L and DML in CGM. Secondly, this paper
intends to explore the potential capacity as well as limitations about RMS-L.
Therefore, a more generalized scenario is required.
1. Scenario one
The demand of three products varies on a daily basis and the forecast ﬁgure
could be drawn based on historical data. The daily demand ﬁgure is random
numbers generated by MATLAB following Poisson distribution, where the
expected value is the demand forecast. In probability theory, Poisson distribution
expresses the probability of a group of discrete events occurring in a ﬁxed interval
of time. In CGM’s case, the custom demand could be regarded as discrete events
[9]. Under the same circumstances, the production plan of RMS-L and DML is
distinguishable.
Figure 6 shows the demand trends and corresponding production plan. To
measure the performance, the total output of the products A, B, and C (the
numerator of metrics) is controlled therefore the denominator can be compared.
The production plan of current DML is that one product will be produced dedi-
catedly at ﬁrst afterward the changeover of system occurs. The second product will
be produced for the next period etc. The production period is determined by the
demand forecast (e.g., one week in CGM). After all three products are produced,
then the DML will be changed to produce other product family. The inventory of
product A, B, and C is sufﬁcient for the demand of a long period, such as half a
year. On the other hand, for RMS-L, it is anticipated to have the adaptability to
follow the turbulent demand. Therefore, the plan in RMS-L is not according to the
forecast but to the real demand coming of every day.

123

2. Scenario two
The second scenario is a reasonable expansion of the ﬁrst scenario since CGM
is interested in the potential of RMS-L. The test period is 14 days with 8 h per day.
RMS is anticipated to overcome some challenges—rapid scale up, ﬂexible pro-
duction, and new product arrivals. Figure 7 depicts the assumed product demand
of the test, where the demand will force RMS-L to scale up. Besides, a new
product in the family, product B will be introduced in the middle of test period.
3.3 Test Results and Analysis
The test results are showed in Fig. 8 based on four metrics. Currently, CGM has
two factory locations, and the cost is different hereof the results are separated.
Therefore, the results indicate that the productivity performance of RMS-L is app.
80 % of the productivity of DML, from the dimension of speed and efﬁciency (see
the result from pulse time and productivity rate). Besides, the labor time in RMS-L
is 16 % higher than the labor time in DML because besides the regular workers,
the process of reconﬁguration requires engineers. The changeover time of the
Fig. 7 Assumed product demand for scenario two

system in RMS-L is much shorter than the time in DML (see the huge improve-
ment on product ﬂexibility). In the test, RMS-L reconﬁgured three times per day
on average. Therefore, compared with DML, RMS-L can provide great advantages
on ﬂexibility (see the result from product ﬂexibility and adaptability). The rapid
changeover of the system is the main enabler.
Figure 9 shows the conﬁguration results of RMS-L in scenario two. With the
increased demand and product variety, RMS-L is up scaled four times during the
test period (happened on July 5, 7, 11, and 13). Therefore, within the product
family, RMS-L can process more product varieties with little inﬂuence on pro-
ductivity. In July 5, for example, RMS-L can handle one more product with very
little negative effects on its productivity. Moreover, the output scale of RMS-L can
be ramped up without too much effort on time and cost. Lastly, Inventory level is
reduced in RMS-L (adaptability increased from 0.01 to 1.16). The product batch
size is much smaller than in DML, at least one batch (product A, B, C) can be
produced during one day in RMS-L.
4 Conclusion
This article shows an exploratory research on the (re)conﬁguration method and
performance evaluation for RMS-L, which is part of the RMS research at SDU.
The (re)conﬁguration methods are separately designed according to the type of
manufacturing task: single product or multiproduct manufacturing task. The
(re)conﬁguration process of the RMS-L is managed manually with the help of
computer simulation. When the system gets more complicated for higher capacity
in the future, the (re)conﬁguration process would more rely on computer analysis
for system optimization.
Within the process of exploration and evaluation, Tecnomatix Plant Simulation
plays a signiﬁcant role in the research. On one hand, it helps obtain data of RMS-L
by modeling the system and simulating its operation. On the other hand, the com-
puter simulation helps to analyze and further optimize the conﬁguration of RMS-L.
In the testing case, RMS-L has shown great ﬂexibility of production capabilities
and outstanding responsiveness to demand changes, compared to the currently
used DML system. The modular structure of RMS-L enables frequent and precise
changes in layout that ﬁts current needs and demand. Thus, the changeover of the
system will not require too much time and money efforts. The inventory level can

125

be greatly reduced and small batch production can be achieved in RMS-L—due to
the high system responsiveness, RMS-L is able to produce smaller batches in
frequent periods (such as one batch per day in the testing case) and reduce its
inventory level and inventory cost accordingly. Besides, labor force working time
could increase greatly when manual changeover happens frequently. However, the
RMS-L has the potential to integrate new technologies such as robot arms to
replace labor force. The performance evaluation of RMS-L application in CGM
has demonstrated great adaptability of the RMS-L concept, and its potential to deal
with new challenges in the globalized environment.
5 Discussion
In this paper, the RMS-L conﬁguration procedures has been explored and devel-
oped, which will contribute to deciding the proper system conﬁguration according
to the requests of different production tasks. The procedures are applicable with
the use of computer simulation. When the manufacturing processes are relatively
simple (such as the cases in this paper), the theoretical calculation (tact time
constraint) of the tools is quite applicable and can lead to a proper system con-
ﬁguration with enough capability for production task. When the number of the
manufacturing processes becomes bigger or the system has to deal with high
volume, the complexity of RMS-L conﬁgurations will increase dramatically
because of the special structure of the base unit, which has four connective
interfaces. In such case, the applicability of the calculation for allocating the tools,
which is based on the constraint of tact time, might be weak, as the real conﬁg-
uration may not be able to follow the calculated tools allocation. Therefore, the
performance of the RMS conﬁguration can differ a lot from theoretical anticipation
hence the procedures of conﬁguring RMS-L will mostly rely on computer simu-
lation analysis.
The RMS-L conﬁguration method does not involve the inﬂuence of the transit
system (conveyers and centerpieces) on the base unit. Practically, when the pro-
cessing tools spend much more time than the centerpieces or the related conveyers
spend, the transit system will have little inﬂuence on the system. However, when
the transit system, especially the centerpiece, consumes more or less the same time
as the tools, the centerpiece may become the bottleneck. In such situations,
computer simulation and analysis will be crucially important to decide the system
conﬁguration.
The research has presented practical procedures to design the RMS-L conﬁg-
uration with the right capacity to fulﬁll the production requests. However, if the
production demand changed frequently with huge ﬂuctuation, it would be feasible
and much more efﬁcient to create a database on the demand and corresponding
conﬁgurations in advance using computer simulation. As for multiproduct man-
ufacturing tasks, the database will be much more difﬁcult to create, which can be a
subject for future research.

Design Conﬁgurator Requirements
for IS Integration
Pasi Paunu and Marko Mäkipää
Abstract Conﬁgurators are essential tools in mass customization. While sales
conﬁgurators and product conﬁgurators have received a fair amount of attention, a
new type of conﬁgurator has emerged for area of order engineering: design con-
ﬁgurator. Design conﬁgurators can be used to automate order engineering and
decrease lead-time for product quotations and customized designs. Thus, they can
bring ETO companies closer to mass customization. In the literature, the concept
of design conﬁgurator has been suggested and this paper examines the require-
ments of such conﬁgurator for IS integration through illustrative case example. By
determining the requirements and integration possibilities of design conﬁgurator,
this study will greatly beneﬁt different industrial contexts when considering a
conﬁgurator solution.

1 Introduction
Competitive market dynamics push companies to offer ever more variety to cus-
tomers and even treating them individually by reconﬁguring their product or
service to meet each customer’s needs [1]. At the same time, increased cost
competition drives companies to reduce costs directly or by developing new
products that deliver what customers need more cheaply [2]. Generally, increasing

product variety negatively effects cost efﬁciency, resulting in potentially weaker
competitive position. Hence, those companies, which can deliver sufﬁcient variety
at competitive cost structure, can achieve an important market advantage over less
efﬁcient and less effective competitors [3].
A challenge for most companies craft customizing their products today is to
continue delivering quality and high customer value while curtailing costs and
shortening delivery time. Mass customization is proposed as a promising approach
to compete in this kind of competitive environment [4, 5]. By using ﬂexible
processes and organizational structures [4], mass customization enables companies
to provide ‘‘tremendous variety and individual customization, at prices comparable
to standard goods and services’’ [6].
The center of mass customization is the customer co-design process. Customers
are invited to participate in value creation process by deﬁning, conﬁguring,
matching, or modifying an individual solution, inside a large but ﬁxed solution
space [7]. Conﬁgurators support this process by collecting customer needs and
matching them to predesigned product features. Traditionally, conﬁguring a
product, rather than designing it, has implied that no component design activities
are needed to deﬁne the required product variants [3]. However, advances in
technology, especially in parametric 3D CAD and design automation tools, has
contested the deﬁnition of design activity excluded in product conﬁguration.
While sales conﬁgurators and product conﬁgurators have received a fair amount
of attention in the literature, this study explores a third type of conﬁgurator for use
in craft customization: a design conﬁgurator [8]. With advanced information
technology utilizing modeled engineering knowledge, a design conﬁgurator can be
used to automate design activities and decrease lead-time for product quotations
and customized designs. This brings the potential to respond quickly to customer
requirements and generate a range of variant designs to meet speciﬁc requirements
[9]. Thus, design conﬁgurators can bring craft manufacturers closer to mass
customization.
Sales conﬁgurators are typically used by customers themselves or by profes-
sional sales personnel. They offer an easy to use interface to place an order in
digital format and to make sure that product speciﬁcation is completed and error
free. When used together with product conﬁgurator, sales conﬁgurator typically
collects the customer requirements and delivers them for product conﬁgurator for
precise product deﬁnition generation. When used as a stand-alone system, sales
conﬁgurator either locates the best matching product for customer requirements or
conﬁgures the product from major modules and options. With complex products
with high level of offered customization, a product conﬁgurator can be used
together with sales conﬁgurator or as a stand-alone solution for internal sales. It is
typically used to combine and verify composition of component and modules to
create a validated customized product. Design conﬁgurators, on the other hand, are
based on parametric conﬁguration of components, modules and whole products,
instead of merely modular conﬁguration of predesigned components and modules.
It produces individual drawings by manipulating parametric 3D CAD models, yet
inside predeﬁned limits, offering greater possibilities for customization. It can be

used as a stand-alone solution for internal sales or sales support, or it can be used
together with sales and product conﬁgurators. If used in combination, sales con-
ﬁgurator is used to collect customer requirements and to produce sales docu-
mentation, product conﬁgurator conﬁgures the modular parts of product and the
design conﬁgurator generates CAD drawings for parametric features of the
product.
In the literature, few practical examples can be found [8–10] as well as proof-
of-concepts [11] showing ﬁrst efforts toward complete design conﬁgurator. Also,
an approach for modeling manufacturing requirements in design automation has
been discussed [12]. This paper contributes this stream of research of conﬁgurators
by describing an example of craft manufactured product and the information
systems integration requirements it places for a fully operative design conﬁgurator.
The research method is mainly conceptual–analytical research method supple-
mented with an illustrative case study. The study is based on existing literature on
conﬁgurators, the conceptual deﬁnition of a design conﬁgurator, illustrative case
example and subsequent analysis for information system requirements
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, an example product is
introduced to illustrate a craft customizable product and its qualities. In Sect. 3, the
conﬁguration process for deﬁning the product is presented. In Sect. 4, the
requirements for information systems integration to build a design conﬁgurator are
drawn from the basis of conﬁguration process of an example product. Finally, in
Sect. 5, the paper is ﬁnished with conclusions, limitations, and future research
recommendations.
2 Case Downhill Skis
Downhill skiing, also called as alpine skiing, is a sport in which the skier slides
down snow-covered mountains or slopes wearing skis with ﬁxed-heel bindings.
Skis used for sliding downhill are a construct of narrow strip of wood, plastic,
metal, or combination thereof worn underfoot to glide over the snow. Substantially
longer than wide and characteristically employed in pairs, skis are attached to
boots with bindings, either with a free, lockable, or permanently secured heel [13].
Modern type of downhill skis have over a hundred years of history behind them
originating from Norway circa 1850, but the skis of the old have very little
resemblance with the typical downhill skis mass produced today [14, 15]. They
come with various shapes and forms and have multitude of options for a customer
to choose from. Even though the variety in ski models is quite large, the basic
construction attributes in manufacturing are quite simple: the width, length, turn
radius (accomplished by sidecut), and the rocker type of the skis. These four basic
features of the ski combined with the skier’s height, weight, and personal style
preference are the starting points for making good downhill skis.
Looking more closely on the construction of skis the baseline design has ﬁve
major manufacturing layouts [16, 17]:
Design Conﬁgurator Requirements for IS Integration
131

• Classic wooden, made out from one single long wood piece
• Laminated wood, made out of two pieces of wood glued together
• Laminated metal and ﬁberglass, which uses laminated wooden core with alu-
minum or ﬁberglass housing sheets
• Torsion box, which has wooden core that has initially been wrapped in wet
ﬁberglass
• Cap design (also called single-shell), where the wooden or foam core is housed
in all three sides of the ski in plastic cover.
After the design layout is chosen, the layering of different materials begins. By
mixing and layering different materials, the skis are made to perform better various
kinds of tasks and they will have very speciﬁc characteristics. The outer features of
skis, as illustrated in Fig. 1, have the last say in the matter of overall handling, but
whether the skis are required to perform hard and quick turns or ﬂoat the skier on
top of a very powdery snow, the inner layers make the performance sustainable.
The layers act in many ways, e.g., stiffening or reinforcing the skis, but they also
carry a graphical signiﬁcance when ﬁnishing the product according to customer
speciﬁc details.
In Fig. 2, the molding of ski is illustrated where all the layers with different
materials come together and form the actual skis. Depending on the manufacturing
process style, the skis can still take part in many different sanding and grinding

operations after the heat molding has been done. Some methods also leave the
graphical decals installation to the end phases though usually they are done before
molding.
3 Conﬁguration Process
The manufacturing of modern skis has signiﬁcantly changed from the artisan
workmanship of the old days to mass production of today’s commercialism. Mass
production has pushed the cost and efﬁciency to their limits, but there is still demand
for more personalized and customized products [6, 18]. Because of this reason there
still are companies that make high-end skis with custom tailoring almost totally by
hand, arguing that their way of doing retain the best of artisan know-how and quality
not easily achieved using other construction methods [19, 20]. The downfall with
this kind of workmanship is usually both delivery time and price of the ﬁnal end
product.
In article [8], a design conﬁgurator has been suggested as a solution for the
challenge of bridging pure customization closer to mass production and hence
mass customization [21]. To better understand this notion, we next concentrate on
the conﬁguration process of such conﬁgurator by examining the illustrated
downhill skis case example.
One possible representation of a generic conﬁguration process is shown in [22]
where the overarching process consists of three temporal interdependent phases;
commercial conﬁguration process, commercial conﬁguration, and technical con-
ﬁguration. The starting point is the customer’s supply of initial information about
the product speciﬁcation needs which then initiates the activity where all the
information negotiated ‘‘identify the complete and congruent commercial
description of the product that best ﬁts the customer’s requirements’’ [22]. The
second phase, commercial conﬁguration, illustrates the speciﬁc features and

characteristic of the product, which the customer is willing to buy and the seller is
willing to sell. After this, the technical conﬁguration can be generated where the
commercial description of a product is used for the creation of product docu-
mentation of such product variant [22].
Though generic this conﬁguration process, as illustrated in Fig. 3, does not
entirely apply when we consider the conﬁguration process of a downhill skis with
design conﬁgurator. The main reason is that all the conﬁguration activities happen
inside the design conﬁgurator, which now controls the process and guides the user
to best satisfy his needs on the ski product.
When the user ﬁrst initiates the conﬁguration process, he inputs physical details
of himself like weight, height, and foot size into the conﬁgurator. This denotes the
start of the commercial conﬁguration. The user then starts to deﬁne the perfor-
mance characteristics of the skis by selecting appropriate ski design on which the
conﬁgurator helps the selection. This can include features like the environment
(powder, alpine-touring, etc.) or skill level of the user.
This kind of conﬁguration highly resembles the features of sales and product
conﬁgurator, and it can be argued that design conﬁgurator actually performs as one
complete conﬁgurator but it also depends how the strict deﬁnition is made. For
example, [23] give three alternatives for sales conﬁgurator operations: structure based,
feature focused, and performance focused. A design conﬁgurator may adapt various
function logics but is highly depended on the information systems environment.
After the ﬁrst conﬁguration decisions, the user starts the main phase: technical
conﬁguration. The technical conﬁguration process of downhill skis can be divided
into three larger steps:
• Selection of the base construction design of skis: Laminated, torsion box, or
single-shell type
• Applying different material layers according to base ski design
• Choosing the outer feature design by performance characteristics illustrated in
Fig. 1.

When the user selects, modiﬁes, and tests the skis design, by applying various
layering materials like reinforcement metals or ﬁberglass pieces, the conﬁgurator
guides the process by offering different setup combinations. It also limits the
illegal positions and materials deﬁned by the underlying decision logic in
the conﬁgurator. These steps are further divided into smaller decision points where
the more detailed materials and measurements, e.g., geometric information are
given for the product but for the purpose of this simpliﬁed example they are not
exhaustively listed here.
The fundamental factor with this conﬁguration process is the uses of parametric
models, which enable the conﬁgurator create new CAD drawings based on the user
given data and also construct the normal product documentation (bill-of-materials
among other things) on the go. This means that the conﬁguration enables almost
inﬁnite variations within the deﬁned borders of the product speciﬁcations, which
have been parameterized. This is completely different from the basic modular
design of selecting only ready-made components from some component library
into the design. After all required features have been listed and attached, the
product is then ready for the conﬁgurator to push to manufacturing which handles
the end production according to the speciﬁc product documentation details created
by the design conﬁgurator.
4 Requirements for Information Systems
In the literature, there are few practical examples [8–10] as well as proof-of-
concepts [10, 11], which show steps toward more comprehensive and complete
design conﬁgurator solution. These examples usually show only part of the whole
conﬁguration process discussed in Section 3, thus lacking the connection to fully
incorporate a true design conﬁgurator. From a closer analysis of the conﬁguration
process of the downhill skis example, we can now present the information systems
integration requirements for a fully operative design conﬁgurator.
The requirements can be divided into ﬁve distinctive parts. First is the need for
visual conﬁguration interface toolkit which acts as the window for the whole
conﬁguration process. Similar application concept can be observed in [8, 10]
(Asoma Studio case) where both toolkits rely on web browser functionality for
their visualization framework. This framework is then used to communicate all the
user manipulated data through the second requirement: main conﬁguration process
manager based on appropriate logic engine. The purpose of this process handler is
to work much like the expert system in [11]. The difference is that the knowledge
is shared between different systems and the logic engine determines needed actions
between systems and conﬁguration decisions. This possesses the requirement of
interoperability of different systems where the process manager is also able to
launch and operate other systems.
In the next phase of the conﬁguration process, the customer is seen to start the
deﬁnition of skis technical speciﬁcation. He needs to modify the structure,
Design Conﬁgurator Requirements for IS Integration
135

geometrics, and possibly other item details which now raise the third requirement
for the IS integration, parametric skeleton model platform. There are many different
ways to implement such a knowledge repository, and one suggestion has been an
integrated PDM system for product conﬁguration concept [24]. In this example, the
PDM platform would also include the logic rules for the overall process handling
and conﬁguration management. Other example is the Cargotec MacGregor case [8]
where PLM is used only to store the skeleton model information and then the ﬁnal
product documentation. This includes the history data and changes to the model
variants. This leads to the fourth requirement of product variant and compilation of
product costs for price formation. This can be done via ERP which would then
contain the cost information for all the items, materials, and work needed in the
skeleton models, product variants, and ﬁnal documentation (e.g., BOM) of the end
product [25]. The last requirement is the interface integration to CAD system.
When the user changes details of the product through the visual conﬁgurator
interface process manager launch and operate the CAD system to provide efﬁcient
and accurate depiction of the product and communicate the changes through the
logic engine to both model storage (e.g., PLM or PDM) and manufacturing systems
(e.g., ERP). Illustration of this requirements schema is shown in Fig. 4.
The ﬁnal connection to manufacturing happens from the central logic rules
system which will send the ﬁnal customer modiﬁed product to physical con-

5 Conclusion
Technological development extends the possibilities of efﬁcient customization. A
concept of design conﬁgurator is suggested to extend the use of conﬁgurators to
order engineering. Previous research has elaborated on the concept, showed some

proof-of-concepts and partial operational cases. However, both research and
practice is still in its infancy.
In this paper, we examined the information systems and integration require-
ments that the concept of design conﬁgurator necessitates. For the illustrative case
example, we found ﬁve major areas that the design conﬁgurator must master:
1. visual conﬁguration interface,
2. conﬁguration process manager,
3. management of CAD skeleton models and product variant data in PDM/PLM,
4. compilation of cost information from ERP and manufacturing orders, and
5. interface integration to CAD to manipulate drawings.
With capabilities in these ﬁve areas, a design conﬁgurator is able to master
whole process of commercial and technical conﬁguration and provide accurate and
detailed tenders and manufacturing orders, without the need for manual inter-
vention. Yet, practical implementation of such conﬁgurator might generate new, so
far unrevealed requirements.
Further research is suggested to contribute our understanding of technical
requirements and solutions of design conﬁgurators as well as business beneﬁts and
organizational consequences of utilizing design conﬁgurators in various contexts.

Designfunding: An Inquiry Tool
for Mass Customization
Matthias Kulcke
Abstract Designfunding is deﬁned as a unique category of crowdfunding. It is
described and explored regarding its potential to become a major inquiry tool for
the preliminary gathering of data as a basis for the conception of mass custom-
ization products.
1 Introduction
Crowdfunding for designers of furniture and accessories, a special chapter in the
comparatively young story of crowdfunding as a means of gathering ﬁnancial and
ideal support for the realization of product ideas, has not yet reached the status of a
mainstream technique. This is due in part to the fact that crowdfunding, though
repeatedly reported on in mass media, has not yet gained a steady foothold with
customers as an online sales tool in all the market areas one could theoretically
think of applying it to. Frontrunner products displayed in crowdfunding platforms
are projects concerned with accessories and gadgets for, in a lot of cases well
spread and well known, brands in information technology [9]. Film projects, as
another example, are also frequently crowdfunded and successful with this format.
Crowdfundings, labeled by the project-starters themselves or the administrators
of the chosen online platform as belonging to the category of design, appear not to
be very successful if dealing with interior design objects. To explore possible
reasons and maybe even overcome some of them, the author initiated in spring
2013, in a cooperation with the Institute of Applied Building Technology of the
Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH), the Hamburg Kreativ Gesellschaft
mbH, and the Hamburger Möbelkooperation, the launch of a contest under the

label designfunding. Strategies, pursued to better the chances of the participating
designfundings, were the display of prototypes in cooperating stores (stilwerk
Hamburg and Lokaldesign), setting up a designfunding Web site (www.
designfunding.com), showcasing the designs, and linking them to the crowd-
funding platform, as well as an accompanying special exhibition at the stilwerk
Hamburg toward the end of the ﬁnancing phases of the projects (Fig. 1).
The outcome sadly strengthened the original thesis by a collection of only 60 %
of the needed sum by the most successful project, considering percentage of the
projected budget [2]. A preceding search through www.kickstarter.com and www.
startnext.de undertaken by the author showed comparatively few crowdfundings in
the category of furniture design and a slim margin out of those in the category of
successful projects.
Although it has to be stated, this does not imply that they are least likely to
succeed overall and, in the long run, since there are product groups that are not
represented at all in the present or past crowdfunding campaigns. There are
designers who already use this format, and if the formats used by designers were to
be optimized, more are bound to get their campaigns fully ﬁnanced.
The crowdfunding technique is generally on the rise [6] and to be reckoned
with, and it is very likely one of the suitable means in the future to reach potential
and actual customers with a new design product, which is not particularly con-
nected to information technology. The frequent launching of specialized crowd-
funding platforms, such as www.technofunding.com and www.sciencestarter.de, is

a further indicator that crowdfunding is here to stay and will further spread into the
conscience of the consumer. In the fall 2013, the regional platform www.
dutchdesignstarter.com [5] was launched as a designfunding platform for Dutch
designers and residents. At the time of this writing, there were no successful
crowdfundings yet listed in the category of furniture design.
2 Crowdfunding Phases and the Integration
of Crowdsourcing
The three phases of a crowdfunding, and thus for a designfunding as well, are
labeled broadly: preparation or pre-campaign, starting phase, and ﬁnancing or
fundraising phase. Some platforms do not require a starting phase and some
describe a conclusive or post-campaign phase as what is to be done after a suc-
cessful funding [7].
2.1 Preparation or Pre-campaign
In preparation, the content of the personalized crowdfunding page is developed
and successively uploaded, in the best case accompanied by productive feedback
from the administrators of the platform. The crowd, for better chances of success,
should be pre-gathered, with the help of social networks such as Facebook and
Twitter.
2.2 Starting Phase
The starting phase is not mandatory on all platforms; it can be included in the
ﬁnancing phase. The project-starter goes public and invites people to become fan
of the project and of course the product. It is especially in this phase that the
project-starter enters also a potential crowdsourcing phase. Crowdsourcing has of
course already been spotted by a lot of enterprises as a tool to optimize products by
putting their clients to work [1], even valued to the degree that the ﬁrms are willing
to pay for such information, having its provision offered as a service to them by
specialists [4, 8].
Since new products are developed, and sometimes not even a ﬁrst prototype has
been produced before a ﬁrst series is ﬁnanced, the products advertised in a
crowdfunding campaign are still subject to change. This is not only due to the
nature of the format; it is also something skilled designers and entrepreneurs are
aiming for, as part of the design process. Invitations to make a contribution to the
Designfunding: An Inquiry Tool for Mass Customization
141

project blog, considering the appearance and functions of the ﬁnal product, are
posted and automatically spread by email newsletter to those registered to the
platform and who also chose to hit the fan-button of the project. This serves on the
one hand to remind fans repeatedly of the ongoing campaign, to hopefully increase
their willingness to ﬁnancially support the project and at best to become customers
by choosing the product itself as an incentive for their monetary contributions.
Now, these interactions with supporters, already vital to designfundings in
progress, might even be extended and/or speciﬁed targeting something else: the
collection of substantial data as a base for deciding upon ﬁxed and variable
parameters of a future mass customizable product series that is to be developed out
of the approach to the market through the designfunding campaign. This goal is
probably more likely to be reached if the initial product concept includes a mass
customization strategy, but it might also spawn from a designfunding that did not
aim for mass customization at ﬁrst and is then changed according to customer
responses pointing in this direction.
Taking these possibilities into consideration and integrating them in campaigns
could not only further establish designfunding as a marketing tool for new mass
customization products, but also serve as ‘‘radar,’’ scrutinizing their chances of
success with customers.
2.3 Financing Phase or Fundraising
Even in the ﬁnancing phase, further relevant information concerning customiz-
ability can be collected, by analyzing which product conﬁguration is preferably
chosen from the list of incentives presented to the customers who order them. And,
since it is possible to list additional incentives even while already in the ﬁnancing
phase, a campaign-starter can react to ﬁne-tune and adjust favored product con-
ﬁgurations, without having to alter a production, because production only starts
after the fully ﬁnanced designfunding has come to a conclusion.
3 Parametric Design in Crowdfunding
Parametric design with the aim of mass customization is characterized by a mix of
ﬁxed and variable parameters, chosen by the designer preceding the programming
and launching of a permanent sales platform including the conﬁgurator, which
establish the product-speciﬁc mass customization strategy. The image below
shows an overview of how a parametric design process may be enhanced by
adding cycles to the iterative design process, including data gathering through a
designfunding (Fig. 2).

4 Conclusion
In particular, design products for production in small numbers by regionally active
craftsmen and manufacturers are suited for this market approach, since cost-
intensive prototype production can be minimized and focused on the most
promising pre-conﬁgured constellations in the case of a successful funding.
Although the recently released Indiegogo Hardware Handbook advises cam-
paigners to build works-like and looks-like prototypes, it is, according to the
contributors, not vital for a campaign to build design-for-manufacturing (DFM)
prototypes [3]. The same goes for the development of the user interfaces and
integrated conﬁgurators on the succeeding permanent online sales platform for the
mass-customized product, because variable parameters to be selected by the
customer have already been sent through a cycle of testing in a direct dialogue
with buyers (for a realized example following a crowdfunding, see [10]).

Does Customer Co-creation Really Pay
Off? An Investigation into the Firm’s
Beneﬁts from Customer Involvement
in New Product and Service Development
Marcel E. A. Weber and Dirk H. Van der Laan
Abstract The active involvement or co-creation of customers in the innovation
process is nowadays very common for ﬁrms. Since the awareness that it also
entails the involvement of customers, many organizations have taken this step.
Customers are nowadays assailed by ﬁrms’ requests to participate in co-creation
challenges, crowdsourcing invitations, and so on. Until now research has mainly
focused on the question why customers indulge on such requests and what they get
out of these participations. However, little attention has been given to the beneﬁts
ﬁrms reap from co-creation initiatives. This research tries to bridge that gap and
investigates the outcomes organizations perceive from co-creating with their
customers. Through a research data on the employment of co-creation by 154
Dutch organizations, we investigate how this co-creation affects innovation suc-
cess, ﬁnancial results, reputational results, and organizational beneﬁts. Compared
with organizations that do not co-create with their customers, organizations engage
in co-creation beneﬁt better from these efforts, culminating in more successful
innovations, an increase in business reputation and an increase in organizational
capabilities. However, customer co-creation does not seem to have a better effect
on the ﬁnancial results.

1 Introduction
Companies ask a lot from their customers these days. In addition to purchasing
products and consuming them, customers may be expected to forgive negative
experience [1], pay premium prices [2], and make loyal purchases [3]. Customers
are encouraged to attend brand-centered events [4], participate in brand commu-
nities [5], and communicate with other customers of a brand [6]. Companies ask
their customers to spread word of mouth [7, 8], participate in research [9], vol-
unteer time [10, 11], and donate money [12, 13]. Firms seem to beneﬁt from such
actions even though they do not take the customers’ beneﬁts into account [14]. It is
argued that customers try to create a meaningful relationship with brands that is
qualiﬁed by the perceived ego signiﬁcance of the chosen brands that adds meaning
to people’s lives [15].
In the past decade, a new way of customer participation has risen: customer co-
creation. Customer co-creation entails the active involvement of customers in the
creation of new value for ﬁrms [16]. As it can be derived from its name, it is
evangelized that customer co-creation is beneﬁcial to both ﬁrms and customers in
several respects. The beneﬁts for customers when participating in co-creation have
been researched extensively, both conceptually and empirically, e.g. [17–21].
However, for ﬁrms, it is only assumed and argued that co-creation with customers
holds beneﬁts; we lack systematic empirical evidence for the fact that the sourcing
of external knowledge from customers is beneﬁcial for a ﬁrm [22].
To close this gap in research literature, we integrate theoretical insights from
literature on co-creation to develop some hypotheses on ﬁrms’ beneﬁts from
customer co-creation. To test these hypotheses, we examine the effect of customer
co-creation on several business performance outcomes in a survey on the customer
experience and co-creation efforts of 115 ﬁrms in the Zwolle region of the
Netherlands. We evaluate the correctness of each hypothesis and conclude this
paper by mentioning several limitations to our research.
2 Theoretical Base and Hypotheses
Open innovation assumes that ﬁrms can and should use external ideas as well as
internal ideas, and internal and external paths to market, as the ﬁrm look to
advance their technology [23]. Companies can no longer focus only on efﬁcient
intra-organizational knowledge creation and sharing, but should also include the
inter-organizational realm, as well as other relevant stakeholders in its business
ecosystem, like various start-ups, universities, research consortia, incubators, and
other outside organizations [24]. To survive and thrive in an increasingly turbulent
landscape, it has become necessary to create new relationships and new mental
space with diverse members in the sociocultural business system that includes
employees, partners, suppliers, competitors, and most importantly, customers [25].
146
M. E. A. Weber and D. H. Van der Laan

Customers know more about their context, their desired outcomes, their needs, and
their constraints than ﬁrms can ever hope to learn [26], making them an almost not
to be neglected source for ﬁrms that decide to undertake the journey of open
innovating [25].
Von Hippel [27] asserts that users are a powerful source for innovations.
Involving customers in the innovation process can be beneﬁcial for ﬁrms, in the
case of developing new products for business users [28, 29] as well as consumers
[30] or for new services [31, 32]. The contribution of customers is growing
steadily larger as a result of continuing advances in computer and communications
capabilities [30].
2.1 Innovation Success
Firms have a great deal to gain from involving the user in the design and devel-
opment process, both in its pre-launch phase (initial innovation) and in its post-
launch phase or re-innovation stage [33]. Firstly, manufacturers can complement
their own R&D efforts through plugging into the technical strengths of their
customers. Secondly, involving the user is a great aid to establishing the optimum
performance/price combination, which in turn establishes the optimum design
speciﬁcation. Thirdly, involved users undergo a learning process that enables them
better to operate the new equipment when it is installed, making such users
potential demonstrators for potential customers of the innovation. This learning
effect also applies to new services that are developed with customers [34]. This
can, in turn, accelerate the acceptance process from new designs [35]. Finally, the
good relationships engendered through user involvement in the formulation of the
initial design can result, if maintained, in a ﬂow of user-initiated improvements,
thus extending the equipment’s life cycle [36].
User involvement during NPD can therefore be beneﬁcial for two reasons. First,
the quality of the product is improved by incorporating users’ mental schemes [37]
and their specialized needs and preferences [27]. The manufacturer may develop a
product that better ﬁts user needs [28, 38, 39]. Even, when new services are
developed, customer involvement may lead to successful new services with unique
beneﬁts and better values [34]. Second, users are more receptive to a new system if
they contribute to its design [35, 40]; involvement may accelerate market acceptance
and diffusion of the product [28] and new service [34]. User involvement per se does
not result in the realization of systems beneﬁts. It is the accommodation of mutual
needs identiﬁed during user involvement that is important [41]. A better product or
service, new value to the customer, greater market acceptance and diffusion are all
elements of a successful innovation, so we can state our ﬁrst hypothesis:
H1
Co-creating with customers in innovations will lead to successful innova-
tions, entailing a better ﬁt to user needs, faster acceptance and diffusion of
the innovation
Does Customer Co-creation Really Pay Off?
147

2.2 Financial Results
Smedlund [42] argues that user involvement is likely to result in high proﬁt
combined with a lower and shared risk of failure in the development process.
Involvement of the user helps to establish the optimum price/performance com-
bination [43]. Syam and Pazgal [44] demonstrate that if ﬁrms charge a single price
over price differentiation for co-creation settings this self-imposed lack of pricing
ﬂexibility may actually be proﬁt enhancing. Franke and Piller [39] and Schreier
et al. [45] assert that the value that customers perceive of co-created products is
higher than the price of ﬁrm-created goods, resulting in an opportunity of exclusive
pricing and higher proﬁts. A study concerning the involvement of lead users at
3 M [46] argues that annual sales resulting from this involvement are conserva-
tively projected to be more than eight times higher than forecast sales for the
average contemporaneously conducted traditional project. Co-creation can lead to
growth, increase in share value, and increase in proﬁts [47]. Involving potential
users in the process of product development, the manufacturer may shorten the
duration of the total development project [28], resulting in the reduction of
development costs. We can therefore conclude with the observation that co-cre-
ation has a positive effect on the ﬁnancial results, consisting of a higher proﬁt,
turnover, and sales, in combination with lower costs, for a ﬁrm:
H2
Co-creating with customers in innovations will lead to increased ﬁnancial
results for the ﬁrm
2.3 Reputational Results
Developing products that meet customers’ needs and preferences because they
were involved could mean that customers will be better satisﬁed than when they
are not involved [39]. Co-creation with customers will increase customer satis-
faction [48] and loyalty [33, 34, 49–55]. Mäkipää et al. [56] found in their research
that when seeking to increase customer loyalty and attracting new customers,
companies need to increase customer involvement in research and design opera-
tions. Another advantage for customer involvement in new service development is
the improvement of long-term relationship with customers [34, 57]. A company’s
reputation, resulting from an increase in customer satisfaction, loyalty, and rela-
tionship, will prosper when the company co-creates with its customers:

Co-creating with customers in innovations will lead to increased reputa-
tional results for the ﬁrm

2.4 Organizational Results
From the perspective of the ﬁrm, customer involvement in innovations offers
information valuable in achieving ideal costs and time in production [58] and in
reducing the uncertainty during the innovation process, such as those regarding the
environment and user demands [35, 59]. Co-creation with customers can improve
the effectiveness of the product development process [60, 61]. Customer
involvement can be important for decreasing development time [35, 62–66], which
is especially useful in incremental innovations [58, 67]. Development time has
become particularly important in development in order to secure competitive
advantage [68, 69]. Moreover, innovation speed has been shown to be the most
appropriate measure of success in highly competitive and rapidly changing mar-
kets with short product life cycles [70, 71]. By involving customers in an early
stage in a continuous way, the product development process may be accelerated
[72]. By involving potential users in the process of product development, the
manufacturer may shorten the duration of the total development project [28].
Another advantage for customer involvement in new service development is
reduced cycle time [34, 73, 74]. Chien and Chen [75] discovered that customer
involvement is beneﬁcial to cross-functional integration during the NPD process as
well, because it confronts different departments that have differing viewpoints on
the process or its outcomes with an independent party reducing controversy.
Furthermore, customer involvement can inspire the innovation process of the ﬁrm
[73]. Chan et al. [48] show that co-creation with customers also drives perfor-
mance outcomes like employee job satisfaction and employee job performance
through the creation of economic and relational values. So we can posit our last
hypothesis on the internal organizational results, entailing a higher employee
satisfaction, an increase in productivity and innovation capacities, and a shorter
time-to-market.

Co-creating with customers in innovations will lead to increased organi-
zational results for the ﬁrm
3 Data Acquisition Method
To test the hypotheses, we conducted a survey among organizations in the Zwolle
region of the Netherlands. The survey, the customer experience and co-creation
monitor, was designed to investigate the use of both customer experience man-
agement and co-creation by respondents. The participating organizations varied in
size, sector, and market size (Fig. 1). The research was conducted in the second
quarter of 2013. About 800 organizations were invited to participate in an online
survey on their efforts and beneﬁts in customer experience management and

customer co-creation; 154 responded by ﬁlling in and returning the survey, of
which 141 were valid. Since it is our aim in this article, we will restrict our current
analysis on the results of the co-creation efforts and leave out other results of the
survey.
In order to limit the amount of survey questions and time invested by
respondents, the constructs being tested were measured by asking the responding
manager for his/her perception of the change in the mentioned outcome: Has the
outcome increased or decreased since the start with their efforts on co-creation.
These outcomes were as follows: innovation success (H1), ﬁnancial results (H2),
reputational results (H3), and organizational beneﬁts (H4). The relevant questions
were all stated in a 5-point Likert scale. Although this would lead to subjective
results, we refrained from asking for objective proof for the change in outcomes,
since it is our intention to perform follow-on research in qualitative interviews, on
the exact impact of co-creation—and other—efforts on the business results.
4 Results
From the 154 respondents, 72 (46.7 %) indicated that they took action to co-create
with their customers in NPD or NSD; 34 (22.1 %) indicated that they did not co-
create at all. The rest (31.2 %) are not aware of any co-creation actions or ini-
tiatives within their organization and were therefore excluded in this research,
leaving us with two samples: co-creating and non-co-creating organizations. From
the remaining 96 organizations, 14 refused to reveal the ﬁnancial, reputational, and
organizational beneﬁts from their co-creation efforts. Table 1 provides the
descriptive results on these four variables. It can be observed that regardless of the
fact that the organization invested time and effort in co-creation, the majority of
respondents signaled an increase in all four variables: innovation success, ﬁnancial
results, reputational results, and organizational beneﬁts. Based on these data, we
can therefore not conclude that co-creation with customers is more beneﬁcial than
not co-creating with them. Although this amount of 82 respondents looks rather
small, we nevertheless tested our four hypotheses, claiming that it is more bene-
ﬁcial to co-create than not to co-create. To execute this test, we compared the two
samples (organizations which co-create and organizations that do not co-create at
all) with the Mann–Whitney test on the four designated outcomes of co-creation.
Table 2 shows the results of this Mann–Whitney test, revealing signiﬁcant dif-
ferences between co-creating and non-co-creating organizations for innovation
success (H1), reputational results (H3), and organizational results (H4). We
therefore accept these three hypotheses, with the addition that co-creating orga-
nizations beneﬁt more than non-co-creators. On the other hand, ﬁnancial results
resulting from co-creation are not higher than for non-co-creators, implying that
H2 is rejected. This is not so surprising since there are many other factors that
inﬂuence the ﬁnancial results from new product introductions [76], which were not
accounted for in this research.

5 Discussion
5.1 Co-creation is Beneﬁcial to Organizations
As expected, organizations, which co-create with their customers, beneﬁt from
this. Compared to organizations that do not co-create at all with customers, these
co-creating organizations perceive better success, increase in their business rep-
utation, and improved organizational capabilities. Although we detect no differ-
ence between co-creators and organizations that do not engage in co-creation in
the perception of the change in their ﬁnancial results, reported ﬁnancial results did
increase, indicating that co-creation does not have adverse effects on ﬁnancials.
That we did not encounter a signiﬁcant difference between the two researched
groups can be attributed to the fact that ﬁnancial results are dependent on other
inﬂuences as well. More and detailed research is needed to establish the factual
impact of co-creation initiatives on these ﬁnancial results.
5.2 Limitations
As with many empirical investigations, this research also entails several limita-
tions, preventing us from generalizing the results. First, response is low compared
to the total population, raising questions about the representativeness of the results.
Although the Mann–Whitney test clearly demonstrates superior results for co-
creators compared to non-co-creators, where the ratio of co-creators to non-co-
creators is approximately 2 to 1, this research cannot conclude that co-creation is
the only or main cause of the better results. Neither can we state that about two-
thirds of all regional organizations engage the customer in co-creation. Increasing
the number of respondents may provide more reliable ﬁgures.

Furthermore, the result variables (innovation success, ﬁnancial results, repu-
tational results, and organizational results) have been measured through self-
reporting of the respondents on superlative measures, entailing subjective views,
meaning as much that one’s perception of, for example, a ‘‘strong increase’’ or
‘‘strong decline’’ can differ from another’s. The research could be enhanced by
providing more objective classes of measures, e.g., ‘‘25 % increase or more.’’ It is
our intention to further investigate the exact impact of co-creation efforts on these
result variables.
Finally, we have aggregated several single result constructs into four result
categories—innovation success, ﬁnancial, reputational, and organizational capa-
bilities—and based our conclusions on the measurement of these four categories,
without investigating the effect of the single result constructs on the categories. An
increase in turnover may, for example, coexist with a decline in proﬁt, but how
does one classify the ﬁnancial result: as an increase or a decline? We therefore
recommend taking these limitations into account in a following study.

Enablers of Innovation
in the Construction Material Industry

and Søren Bolvig Poulsen
Abstract The construction material industry is often acknowledged as slightly
more innovative than the overall construction industry and could hence serve as a
valuable learning place for how innovation could ﬂourish in the construction
industry. Construction is viewed as network or supply chain based, which creates a
strong interdependence between the different supply network partners and can be
seen as a hindrance for innovation. Innovation models must embrace such a
contemporary business structures, where competition often takes place between
supply chains rather than between individual companies. By exploring case-based
innovation processes the purpose is to discover enablers of innovation in the
construction material industry. The research design is based on explorative case
studies. By applying case study as method, the research is drawn towards inductive
research, where we investigate patterns suitable for generalization on enablers for
innovation. In total, six cases of successful innovation are investigated. The
conclusion of this research validates that open innovation in a network approach is
a precondition for a successful innovation journey in the construction industry. In
addition, it was found that different approaches for facilitating this journey exists,
based on company characteristics. This paper adds to the body of knowledge on

1 Introduction
In general, it is recognized that innovation contributes to economic growth of
industries as well as competitive advantage of ﬁrms [1]. The construction industry
is in many countries considered to be a slow adopter of new technology and new
processes, and its conservatism and tradition bound thinking pose serious impli-
cations for the rate of innovation, which lags behind most other industries, and
appear to be falling further and further behind [2]. This is in particular of concern,
as the construction industry’s turnover typically ranges from 5 to 12 % of a
nation’s GDP [3, 4]. It is clear that improvements would be highly beneﬁcial not
only for the individual ﬁrms in this industry, but also at an aggregated macro-
economic level. Hence, a dedicated focus on how to enable innovation practices
within this industry is important.
The research presented in this paper speciﬁcally focuses on the construction
material industry, which is considered to be a subpart of the whole construction
industry. The construction material industry is often acknowledged as slightly more
innovative than the overall construction industry. Pries and Dorée [5] investigated
innovations in the Dutch construction industry and found that about two-thirds of
all innovations originate from supplying industries. Winch [6] argues that inno-
vation efforts in the industry are disproportionately orientated towards product
enhancement rather than process improvement. This corresponds well with the
observations of Pries and Dorée [5]. The construction industry is in this research
viewed as collaborative networks within a supply chain. This structure creates a
strong interdependence between the different supply network partners (suppliers,
manufacturers, retail, architects, and construction contractors) and can be seen as a
hindrance for innovation [7]. Yet, innovation models must be developed to embrace
such contemporary business structures, where competition often takes place
between supply chains rather than between individual companies [8].
Even though the construction material industry is more innovative, known for
higher gross margins and better earnings than the construction industry in general,
improvements are still highly necessary. The construction material industry has
often been criticized for not providing added value for the end-user, and for being
an additional supply tier adding costs to the ﬁnal construction. There are two main
arguments to narrow the scope for this research to only focus on the construction
material industry. Firstly, this industry can provide cases of ‘‘successful’’ inno-
vation. Successful should be perceived as Van de Ven [9, p. 591] wrote ‘‘managing
ideas into good currency.’’ Since this research aims at identifying enablers of
160
S. Wandahl et al.

innovation, it is imperative to have access to such cases. Secondly, we argue that
the construction material industry can be viewed as an innovation broker for
increasing the innovation level of the whole construction industry.
It is largely acknowledged, and underpinned by empirical research, that
effective and efﬁcient management of innovation depends on a range of contin-
gencies [e.g. 10–12]. In order to be innovative, ﬁrms have to be aware of the
speciﬁc circumstances inﬂuencing possibilities to innovate. Studies have already
been undertaken to examine enablers of construction innovation. Yet, a consistent
and general understanding of innovation management in construction is still
missing [10]. The present research effort addresses this knowledge gap by studying
the following question: How is innovation structured and managed in construction
material ﬁrms that have had noticeable innovation success?
By exploring case-based innovation processes, the purpose of the research at
hand is to discover particular enablers of innovation in the construction material
industry.
2 Method
The main method is the explorative case study with the purpose of identifying
innovation processes and analytic generalization [13]. A qualitative study is pre-
ferred due to the lack of consistent understanding and use of innovation in the
construction material industry. Malløe [14] argues that an inductive case study is
suitable for creating new understanding, amongst others because the expected bias
is made explicit.
2.1 Data Selection and Collection
The ﬁrst step in data collection was to establish a number of criteria for the
selection of cases. Rigorous and consistent application of such criteria increases
the credibility of the research [15, 16]. The criteria were as follows:
• Should be within the construction material industry. No exact deﬁnition of this
industry exists, hence it can range from screws and nails to prefabricated
bathrooms. However, companies closer to being part of the manufacturing
industry have been left out.
• Should be small- and medium-sized enterprises. The European commission’s
[17] deﬁnition of SME’s was applied, whereby criteria in terms of employees,
turnover, and balance sheet were applied.
• Should not be direct competitors. Instead, the selected companies should rep-
resent different subparts of the construction material industry in term of degree
of processing.

• Should be characterized as being ‘‘successful’’ innovators. This is a very sub-
jective selection criterion. It is operationalized by four sub-criteria, which are
discussed below.
It can be discussed how exactly to deﬁne and understand ‘‘successful with
innovation.’’ No obvious measurable ﬁgures exist for this purpose. It would be
misleading to use, e.g. growth as an indicator for successful innovation, as inno-
vation could be one of several reasons for a company to grow larger, but no
coherent relation occurs. An increased turnover is also an inconsistent indicator for
successful innovation. Process innovation could lead to a decrease in ﬂexible and/
or capacity costs, but several other factors inﬂuence these costs. The amount of
patents held by the company could be an acceptable indicator for successful
innovation, but many innovations are not suitable for processing patents, espe-
cially incremental process innovations. Costs allocated to research and develop-
ment could be a relevant indicator for innovation activities, however, more than
often, the R&D costs of an organization is kept conﬁdential and are not displayed
in public account reports.
It is, therefore, concluded that no speciﬁc and objective quantiﬁable measures
for successful innovations occurs. Instead a combination of less precise selection
criteria is applied:
• If a company describes themselves as innovative, it could be an indicator for
explicit innovation activities. The degree of success cannot be validated in this
criterion.
• Expert evaluation as innovative.
• The media recognizes the company as being innovative.
• The authors’ extensive empirical knowledge of innovative companies in the
construction material industry.
A total of six cases were selected to be included in the research.
As the methodological strategy for the research is case studies, the primary data
collection methods were semi-structured interviews and collecting material from
archives. Table 1 illustrates data collection in relation to each case.

2.2 Presentation of Six Selected Cases
Six cases were applied for data collection in this research. Since all six companies
are based on the Danish construction material industry, full anonymity was granted.
Selection criteria for each case are summarized in Table 2 and commented
upon afterwards.
Case 1 is a highly automated and industrialized producer of modular box-based
houses and cottages. For several years, they have been seeking to optimize their
production process by, amongst other things, introducing LEAN manufacturing.
They do not perceive themselves as innovative (the term innovation is not well
seen by the CEO), instead they: ‘‘…just follow good ideas.’’
Case 2 is a young ﬁrm with a fully outsourced production. They collect pro-
duction scrap and waste from wind turbine production, plastic production, and
glass production. These raw materials are used to produce composite panels,
isolation panels, rooﬁng panels, and sound insulation panels.
Case 3 is a manufacturer of high-end design radiators and other heating systems.
For the past couple of years, they have integrated user-driven innovation principles in
their design process, resulting in, amongst others, a radiator laboratory where
architectscan come and ‘‘play’’ with radiator components and build their own design.
Case 4 produces advanced HVAC systems. Each year, they host a ‘‘ventilation
innovation day,’’ which is open for all interested parties. They have an open inno-
vation agenda and have also founded a special R&D subdivision with the primary
purpose to stay in contact with high-ranked university research in the HVAC ﬁeld.
Case 5 is a ﬁrm-producing cement products. It is a very large ﬁrm and should
hence not have been selected due to the SME criterion. However, this case is still
relevant because it is known for owning many patents and develops new products
in accordance to a highly structured innovation process. It is also well-known that
this ﬁrm actively strives to change the boundary condition, both politically and
legally. From Table 2, it shows that case 5 does not match the SME criterion.
However, the number of employees is not exceeded signiﬁcantly. The case is

included due to the fact that this case is placed upstream in the construction
material industry’s supply chain, i.e. the degree of processing is very low. In total,
it can be concluded that one large, two medium, and three small companies are
presented in this study.
Case 6 is a 10-year-old ﬁrm-producing high performance concrete solutions,
specializing in sleek balconies and staircases. They perform a very active mar-
keting strategy, branding themselves as highly innovative.
The six cases represent different products with different degrees of processing,
ranging from case 1 prefabrication of modular boxes to case 5 cement production.
This enables a broad picture of innovation structures and management in the
construction material industry.
2.3 Data Analysis
The data analysis is executed as a comparative analysis of the six cases with
respect to speciﬁc subjects. These subjects were deﬁned as conceptually relevant
guidelines for conducting the case studies. The subjects were all conﬁrmed
through the qualitative dialogues as being of high relevance the innovation
activities of the case companies.
• Scope of innovation. Identiﬁcation of which scopes are applied in the innovation
processes, namely product, process, organization, market, or technology.
• Open innovation. An analysis of how open each company is in their innovation
process, and a description of who they involve, e.g. customers, consultants,
supply network, or external cooperation (with competitors).
• Innovation maturity. An adaption of Essmann and Du Preez’ [18] ﬁve levels of
innovation maturity is applied to identify how mature each case is in terms of
innovation activities.
For each subject (scope of innovation, open innovation, innovation maturity),
the data analysis is based on interviews and data from archives. To present the data
and conclusions in a condense form different schematic approaches are applied,
e.g. spider diagrams. The values used in spider diagrams are developed through a
qualitative measure of percentage, which allows for the identiﬁcation of patterns
across the six cases.
3 Findings
3.1 Scope of Innovation
In order to identify the different scopes of innovation, we return to the very basics
of innovation theory. Schumpeter [19, 20] described and distinguished between
164
S. Wandahl et al.

ﬁve scopes for innovation known as: products (or services), processes, technology,
exploitation of new markets, and new ways of organizing [21]. Similar scopes of
innovation are still found at the core of contemporary deﬁnitions of innovation.
Amongst others, this is reﬂected in the 4P’s of innovation [22], (1) identiﬁed as
product innovation (changes in the deliverables that the organization offers, be that
in the matter of products or services); (2) process innovation (changes in the
manner of which the deliverables are created and delivered); (3) position inno-
vation (changes in the context or markets in which the deliverables are introduced)
[23]; and (4) paradigm innovation (changes in the models and organization, which
frames what the organization does) [24]. We hence apply the following ﬁve scopes
of innovation for the case analysis; product, process, organization, market, and
technology (Table 3).
Figure 1 shows that all cases involve from three to ﬁve of the ﬁve different
scopes for innovations. This implies that the companies have a broad access to
how to innovate. However, there is a clear indication that not all of the ﬁrms are
capable of performing technologically driven innovation. It also indicates that
synergy arises when innovating with several scopes simultaneously. An innovation
of a new product is often based on an identiﬁcation of several observations and
ideas from market request and trends, new technology, etc.
Five of the six companies rate product innovation is very high. Case 1 has high
focus on LEAN optimization of the production process of prefabricated con-
struction modules. No connection between innovation scope and degree of pro-
cessing is observed. However, it is noted that case 1 with the most processed
product unilaterally focuses on process innovation. Also, no interdependencies
between the different innovation scopes are evident. The only clear observation is
the openness towards use of several innovation scopes simultaneously. The ﬁnd-
ings for the six cases are illustrated on two radar diagrams in Fig. 1 presented.
3.2 Open Innovation
How the six cases cooperate with external partners in their innovation activities is
illustrated in Fig. 2 and presented.
It is evident that all cases apply open innovation and cooperates with one or
more external partners in some degree.
It is a tendency that the cases cooperate in a small degree with consultants.
Case 1 differs again. They cooperate extensively with consultants, amongst others
in terms of adopting LEAN production principles. All cases cooperate with dif-
ferent Danish GTS1 institutions. All six cases cooperate with customers in a
medium to a high degree. How they cooperate is very different. It ranges from

research and technology organizations approved by the government.

user-focused design (case 2) over co-creation (case 3) to development of new
business models (case 6).
The analysis also investigates who customers are. It is clear that the further
upstream a company is in the value chain of construction, the less the company
cooperates with partners close to the end-user. Cases 2 and 5 are most upstream
and their customers are mainly the next tier of construction material producers.
Cases 1, 3, 4, and 6 have a broader customer landscape and cooperate with mainly
vendors but also with contractors and architects. In general, there seems to be a
barrier in cooperation with traditional actors in construction projects. Hence, there
is a risk that innovation only takes places with the next tier in the supply chain and
leaves out the end customer of construction, i.e. clients and users. Architects are
often involved in innovation with the construction material industry (cases 1, 2, 3,
and 6) as a construction partner, whilst only cases 4 and 5 cooperate with con-
tractors in innovation processes.

Dyadic cooperation is collaboration between the focal company and either a
supplier, a competitor, a university, or another company. All cases apply such
dyadic cooperation in a medium or high degree in their innovation effort. The
analysis discovered that cases 1, 2, 4, and 6 have more than one dyadic cooperation
relation in their innovation campaign. Finally, four of the six cases participate in
innovation network activities, e.g. InnoByg.2 Thus, it can be concluded that all
cases work with open innovation, however, in different manners and extent. No
correlation between company size, maturity, or degree of processing and how open
they are could be determined. More research should be delegated to explore this
speciﬁc topic.
3.3 Innovation Maturity
It became clear from the interviews that the six cases differ in how structured they
go about the innovation process, ranging from ad hoc to structured and delegated.
To investigate this further, the ﬁve levels of innovation maturity identiﬁed by
Essmann and Du Preez [18] are applied. The ﬁve levels are presented as follows:
• Level 1: The organization is wholly consumed with day-to-day operations—
maximizing short-term revenue and reducing cost. Individual attempts at being
creative or ‘‘out-of-the- ordinary’’ are often dismissed. Innovative outputs are
inconsistent and unpredictable.
• Level 2: The organization has identiﬁed the need to innovate. Innovation is
clearly deﬁned. A basic understanding has been established of the various
factors that inﬂuence innovation. Innovative outputs are inconsistent, but
traceable.
• Level 3: Innovation is supported and managed with appropriate practices,
procedures, and tools. Individuals are encouraged to be innovative. Innovative
outputs are consistent in nature and ensure sustained market share and
positioning.
• Level 4: Practices, procedures, and tools for integrating innovation activities are
used. A deep understanding has been established of the internal innovation
model and its relation to business requirements. Innovative outputs are consis-
tent, diverse, and a source of differentiation.
• Level 5: Innovation practices, procedures, and tools are institutional. Individuals
are empowered to innovate. Synergy is achieved through the alignment of
business and innovation strategy and the synchronization of activities. Innova-
tive outputs provide sustained competitive advantage in existing and new
markets.
2 InnoByg is the innovation network for energy efﬁcient and sustainable construction. The
Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation has granted a co-ﬁnancing of 20 million
DKK to the new network in the period 2011–2014.

S. Wandahl et al.

Based on interviews, observations and archives of each case are in one of the
ﬁve levels for innovation maturity in organizations in the following.
Case 1 has delegated the responsibility for the innovation process to key
employees. For example., the production manager was a blue collar employee a
few years prior to this research. He is currently responsible for the continuous
development (known as continuous development or Kaizen) of the production and
is the team manager for the whole production. The hourly paid workers have an
additionally pay based on incentives from production optimization ideas. Also, a
product development manager in charge of LEAN innovation is employed. Top
management seldom interferes in this process. Monthly employee meetings in the
production are carried out. These facts correspond well with level 3, where
innovation is somewhat supported and managed with appropriate practices, pro-
cedures, and tools. Case 1 is a medium-sized company with 140 employees and
was founded in 1978.
Case 2 is placed in level 1 in terms of innovation maturity. In this level, the
company applies all its energy on developing a product and to gain a market share.
As mentioned, case 2 has high focus on product innovation and struggles to gain a
relative market share. Essmann and Du Preez [18] argue that in this level, focus is
put on short-term revenues and planning. During interviews, the CEO of case 2
only talked about the technical speciﬁcations and the proﬁts that can be gained of
his one product. Case 2 is a small company with only 11 employees and was
founded in 1999.
Case 3 is in level 2. This phase is characterized by introduction of structures,
systems, and procedures for directing the development process. The company has
recently reorganized itself with more ﬁrm direction for product development. As a
part of the reorganization, they developed an innovation laboratory where cus-
tomers can come and ‘‘play’’ and assemble heating components.
Case 4 introduced a strong restructuring of their development activities 4 years
ago. This structure contains procedures for prioritizing and selecting innovative
ideas. The company was founded in 1957 and has today 175 employees. Therefore,
case 4 is placed in level 4, which implies the use of practices, procedures, and tools
for integrating innovation activities to enhance co-ordination.
Case 5 is placed in level 3. During this level, a company can have different
development projects with separate (and conﬂicting) agendas. Each project has its
own leader who only focuses on that particular project and fails to take the whole
company into consideration in the decisions that are made. The Head of Devel-
opment in case 5 is currently facing these challenges. He is in the process of
developing new structures and procedures for the future innovation process of the
organization. He also struggles to prioritize the different projects to ensure that the
scarce organizational resources are spent efﬁciently. Case 5 is an old company
founded in 1889 with 371 employees.
Case 6 is, similar to case 3, placed in level 2. It has just moved away from a
‘‘leadership crisis,’’ due to a new CEO and his strategic efforts in the company. So,
whilst the organization has identiﬁed the need to innovate and that innovation is
clearly deﬁned, little effort has been put into activities for conducting innovation
Enablers of Innovation in the Construction Material Industry
171

due to the change in management. It is a small organization and has existed for
merely 10 years.
As illustrated in Fig. 3, there is a pattern that the size of the organization has an
inﬂuence on the level of innovation maturity. This is not a signiﬁcant linear
pattern, but does provide indications that innovation maturity in constructional
material companies may in fact be dependent on the general organizational
maturity.
4 Discussion
Despite the largely negative picture of innovation in the construction industry,
some SMEs do manage to deliver innovations of signiﬁcant originality [25]. The
ways in which these successful innovators operate and how they differ from less
innovative businesses are likely to provide useful illustrative examples. For this
reason, a study focusing on enablers for innovation in SMEs in the construction
industry can make a contribution to understanding how and why some ﬁrms are
able to counter the trend set by many of their peers.
To discuss research ﬁndings from the six case studies and in the quest of
generalizing factors that enables innovation, ﬁndings from a range of past studies
on innovation in the construction industry are drawn upon.
Most of past studies have a broader scope than the construction material
industry, instead focusing on the construction industry in general or the project-
based condition of construction projects. The following enablers are the most
dominant (often occurring) from litterateur in and around the construction industry.
4.1 Collaboration with External Partners
What we ﬁnd throughout the analysis is that collaboration with the external
environment is a key enabler of innovation in the construction material industry,

and that this is often practiced with several different scopes of innovation. This
ﬁnding is supported by several studies pinpointing that industry relationships, both
up and down stream in the supply chain, have a signiﬁcant impact on innovation
[26, 27]. The beneﬁt of strong relationships must be utilized through careful
facilitation, which can enable knowledge ﬂow and transactions [4]. This can
include processes related to product integration, project organization and coordi-
nation, diffusion of technologies, and information ﬂow from various sources [28].
For example., manufacturing ﬁrms are often considered a key source for con-
struction innovation, because they often provide innovative components [4].
Anderson and Manseau [28] argue that manufacturing ﬁrms have larger R&D
programmes due to their more stable boundary conditions. Moreover, their focus
and

not

based

discontinuities.
Miozzo and Dewick [27] found that the strength of inter-organizational coop-
eration in the construction industry in ﬁve European countries is responsible for
enhanced innovative performance. Stable relations, almost quasi-ﬁrm like, ensures
mutual interest, active participation, and open communication. These elements,
combined with continuing cooperation, is an enabler of both product and process
innovation [27]. Synonyms for such a relationship could be relational contracting
and strategic alliances.
Downstream, we also ﬁnd that costumers with a technical insight are considered
to have enormous capacity to exert inﬂuence on ﬁrms involved in construction in a
way that fosters innovation [4, 29–32]. Customers are able to enhance innovation
in construction in a number of ways. The more demanding and technically oriented
the costumer is, the more likely it is to stimulate innovation [30, 32, 33]. Manley
[34] has demonstrated that a high level of technical competence in the costumer
body is a signiﬁcant enabler for construction innovation. Nam and Tatum [29]
have pointed out that customers’ values are not necessarily as conservative as they
are sometimes perceived to be. Some construction customers are able to accept and
encourage innovation in the building projects that they commission [35].
Wandahl et al. [2] and Lassen et al. [36] argue a major challenge for companies
working with innovation in the construction industry is the development of an
understanding of the importance of working trans-disciplinary within the various
companies in value chain. To innovate in an open innovation setting, the involved
companies must overcome these challenges. That openness enables innovation is
demonstrated in the analysis of the cases in this study, as well as in the work of
Dubois and Gadde [26] who concluded that up and down stream relations had
signiﬁcant impact on innovation performance.
4.2 Trust
In close relation to cross-organizational tiers and communication, trust within such
a collaborative establishment becomes crucial [37]. Akintoye and Main [38] found
Enablers of Innovation in the Construction Material Industry
173

lack of trust to be one out of two major reasons for not succeeding with innovation
in construction. Bosch-Sijtsema and Postma [39] argues that mutual trust amongst
partners can lead to access to and further development of the knowledge and
innovation.
Akintoye and Main [38] identify success and failure factors for collaboration in
the construction industry in the UK. One of two principle failure factors is deﬁned
as being lack of trust and consultation amongst the business partners.
Bosch-Sijtsema and Postma [39] claim that: ‘‘partnerships with complimentary
technological capabilities and mutual trust relationships develop and share (new)
knowledge on organizational and market issues…can be positive for the innova-
tion potential and for developing and strengthening competitive advantage’’
(p. 69). Thus, mutual trust amongst the business network partners in the con-
struction industry can lead to further development of the knowledge and innova-
tion of all business network partners, which in return support the general industrial
relationships.
Jacobsen and Lassen [37] have also stressed the importance of trust between
collaborative partners in the construction industry. They state that, generally, the
element of trust is a well-known and researched ﬁeld; however, it proved to be an
absolutely essential element in the construction industry due to the general
industry inexperience in collaborating for innovation. They state that different
kinds of trust exist during a trust development process for an innovation project in
the construction industry, and that these types of trust are developed through
certain activities which ensure success of the collaboration.
The element of trust may in fact be related to the innovation maturity of the
organization, as it takes time to develop relationships, procedures, and structures
that enable innovation.
4.3 Management Support
The available resources of a ﬁrm are widely regarded as critical for innovation
success. The case analysis reveals that ‘‘trial and error’’ nature of much innovation
requires a supportive management structure and sufﬁcient resource allocation if it
is to deliver beneﬁts [35]. The organizational structure and awareness from top
management seems critical [2, 40]. Also the competences of top and middle
management have proven impact on innovation [41]. Ownership of the innovation
process is important both when a single ﬁrm innovates and in inter-ﬁrm innova-
tion. A dedicate resource that facilitates and drives the process must be present.
Slaughter [42] mentions the role of ‘‘gatekeepers,’’ whilst Mitropoulos and Tatum
[43] and Gambatese and Hallowell [41] identify this role as ‘‘champions.’’ The
role of the champion is close to the concept of the innovation broker [4, 10, 44].
Bosch-Sijtsema and Postma [39] state that one of the main conditions for
accomplishing a collaborative innovation project in the construction industry is the
top management support of the individual business partners: ‘‘Especially
174
S. Wandahl et al.

managerial support increases the opportunity of transferring knowledge and
internalizing this knowledge in the ﬁrm,’’ which supports the ability of creating,
enhancing, and facilitating the innovation skills of the business network.
Another aspect that must be considered is that often in the construction
industry, it is in fact the top management that comes up with the innovation [29].
As such, top management support to, and sometimes direct involvement in, the
collaboration for innovation in the construction industry becomes a necessity for
developing and cultivating innovation. Management support can also be applied
through trust to the individual departments and hereby allowing a certain degree of
freedom to explore potential innovative directions.
However, considering the traditional and norm-bound setting of the construc-
tion industry, ensuring success of collaboration for innovation requires further
education and re-orientation of the construction industry in general [45].
A key observation made by Wandahl et al. [2] and Jacobsen and Lassen [37] is
that innovation managers in the construction industry have very different degrees
of freedom to act within. For cross-organizational collaboration, these differences
in mandate turned out to be a hurdle in an open innovation process. Nam and
Tatum [29] illustrate that top management often is the main the driver of inno-
vative ideas in construction. Thus, it is evident that organizational structure and
awareness from top management is a critical enabler for innovation in the con-
struction material industry [2, 35, 40].
5 Conclusion
In conclusion, focus returns to the research question which is set forth in this
research, focusing on how innovative processes is structured and managed in
successful construction material ﬁrms. In other words, identifying, describing, and
discussing the innovation enablers in construction supply chains.
Through this paper it has been discussed how different structures and innovative
practices in general, in a fuzzy compound can set the foundation for successful
innovation in construction material ﬁrms. These practices are to be viewed in a
larger scope of transforming the whole construction industry into a more inno-
vative industry. Boundary conditions, however, calls for an open or network-based
approach to innovation in the construction industry.
The result of this research is knowledge of the practices, which support inno-
vation within construction material ﬁrms. A range of practices that can lead to
successful innovation has been discovered, some through literature and some
through analysis of empirical data. The main point to observe is that successful
innovative ﬁrms apply a combination of different innovative actions simulta-
neously. Such companies are open-minded and pursue innovation in multiple
directions, e.g. technological, organizational, etc. It is, therefore, not possible to
put forward a recipe-like agenda on how to be innovative as this is highly
Enablers of Innovation in the Construction Material Industry
175

depended on the given context and the capacities within the ﬁrm. It is, however,
possible to point out precepts for increased success ratio.
Peer research has proven that management support, organizational structure,
ﬁrm resources, and selection of champions are innovation enablers. This research
documents an additional enabler—that initiating innovation processes from mul-
tiple sources simultaneously seems to enable innovative success. This is important
to incorporate as rigid structures of innovation practices emerges as companies
matures.
All cases in this research practice dyadic collaboration and open innovation,
which therefore seems to be an enabler. More precise, it is recognized that open or
network-based innovation within the supply chain (i.e. with suppliers and cus-
tomers) as well as innovation processes outside the supply chain with industrial
partners or even competitors increases the chance of successful innovation for
construction material ﬁrms.
Whether or not the innovative actions are conducted internally or externally,
trust is paramount to establish due to the fragile culture of collaboration. This
research enclosed that ownership to the innovation process is critical especially in
a network-based approach.
A ﬁnal enabler veriﬁed through this research is that successful ﬁrms actively try
to inﬂuence the regulatory climate to achieve a competitive advantage.
This research has identiﬁed the abovementioned precepts for innovative prac-
tice within the construction material industry. Theses precepts should be explored
in greater detail in future research to investigate and describe the constraints in
greater detail.

Enabling Facilitation of Mass
Customization via Partnering
in the Construction Industry
Kristian Ditlev Bohnstedt
Abstract In the past decades, the manufacturing industry has gone through dra-
matic improvement in productivity, cycle time, and inventory level of manufac-
turing applying information technology and manufacturing technology. However,
the construction industry has not yet been able to enjoy similar magnitude of
improvements. The aim of this paper is therefore to investigate which of the
normally used procurement forms in the Danish construction industry would
facilitate the implementing mass customization. Benchmark results from 2,318
cases were obtained from The Benchmark Centre for the Danish Construction
Sector containing information on the realization processes and the integration of
customers likely to answer the question of which procurement or contract form
that would best accommodate the facilitation of near-mass customization perfor-
mance. To test this, a one-way ANOVA comparison was used, and it was found
that Partnering and Turnkey Contracts signiﬁcantly enhance the likelihood of
facilitating the implementing mass customization than all other contract forms.

1 Introduction
In the new era of competitive environment, customer demands for high variety of
product choices [16]. At the same moment, customers increasingly show an
interest of self-customization of the item to personalize the product [5]. Manu-
facturers such as construction companies understand that customers are the driver
of the market, in order to accommodate the needs of customer; they are attempting

to produce a large number of product variants in an economical way. Mass cus-
tomization philosophy seems to show a possibility to help construction companies
to achieve this goal by achieving mass production efﬁcient in an economic way
while allowing customizing at the same moment [15]. However, to apply mass
customization successfully on an industry such as the construction industry, an
effective and efﬁcient customer requirement collecting and implementing plat-
form, high-performance manufacturing processes, and well-maintained supply
chain support are required. To facilitate functions of these enablers, a contracting
model that facilitates the implementing mass customization is necessary.
Modern building system is closely bonded with the development and the sub-
stantiality of the society [20]. The construction process in the future should allow
ﬂexibility to perform modiﬁcation uttered from the customers and keep pace with
the changes along the changing world in terms of technology and development
[20]. Even though the construction process is inseparable with our breath, con-
struction industry is still sticking to the traditional way of practice in terms of
project management and production strategy. In terms of business process, the
constructing a building is a very complex process; it involves numerous stages of
iterations and collaboration between government, construction professionals, and
developers; different disciplines each with their own interests and mastery area.
The mass customization movement has evolved a lot over the past years [12].
Once publically recognized merely as a new way to sell consumer goods such as
customized cereal or running shoes, these days’ mass customization has gained
acceptance and application as a revolutionary way to design, make and sell the
products of the future, and to help form a better, more individual society for
individual people [12].
One such area where the concept of mass customization is currently winning
more and more fans is that of architecture and building construction. Why?!—
Because no two inhabitants are exactly the same and the house one lives in should
reﬂect that. More so, since it is not only a rather expensive product but a home, a
place where one should feel completely comfortable. Research has shown that
mass customization can help to make the dream of the truly individual house an
affordable reality (within certain limits, of course) [23]. However, the concept has
far more potential than what is being put to use these days. When analyzing
architecture and the construction industry with regard to the strategic capabilities
of mass customization that have been suggested by literature, opportunities for
improvement, especially in terms of the realization processes and the integration of
customers, can be recognized [12].
Mass customization can be described as ‘‘enabling a customer to decide the
exact speciﬁcation of a product or service, and have that product or service supplied
to them at a price close to that for an ordinary mass-produced alternative’’ [10]. The
ﬁrst part of this deﬁnition, the ‘‘involvement of the customer in deciding the exact
speciﬁcation’’ means that the relationship between the vendor and the customer is
different to a mass production situation, where the vendor offers a product on a
‘‘take it or leave it’’ basis. In a study entitled ‘‘Approaches to mass customization:
Conﬁgurations and empirical validation’’ Rebecca Duray et al. [7] states that mass
180

customization takes place when a product is designed to meet the needs of a
particular customer. Whereas increased product variety is sometimes cited to
support descriptions of mass customization, here it is argued that the customer must
be involved in specifying the product for true mass customization to take place [7].
This type of mass customization is sometimes known as ‘‘collaborative custom-
ization,’’ a term which was coined in a 1997 Harvard Business Review article ‘‘The
Four Faces of Mass Customization’’ by B. Joseph Pine and James H. Gilmore [10].
Collaborative customization is where the business conducts a dialog with the
individual customer to help them articulate their needs, to identify the precise
offering that fulﬁlls those needs, and to make customized products for them. This
approach is appropriate for businesses whose customers cannot easily articulate
what they want and grow frustrated when forced to select from a plethora of
options. This involvement of the customer in the design and production stage means
that the customer becomes a ‘‘prosumer’’ as described by futurologist Alvin Tofﬂer
in the 1970 book, ‘‘Future Shock’’ [22]. The prosumer is producer and consumer in
concert, deﬁning and producing the product. The second part of the deﬁnition refers
to the price, which must be ‘‘close to that for an ordinary mass-produced alterna-
tive’’. This addresses the ‘‘mass’’ in mass customization. This separates mass
customization from the traditional ‘‘made to order’’ approach, which by nature
involves high cost, for example, in construction of complex buildings. At the
extreme of mass and collaborative customization is ‘‘pure customization’’ as
described by Henry Mintzberg in 1988 [19]. This is where an enterprise supplies a
product designed and produced from scratch for each individual customer. Pure
customization includes the customer in the entire cycle, from design through fab-
rication, assembly, and delivery, and it provides a highly customized product.
The aim of this paper is therefore to investigate which of the normally used
procurement forms in the Danish construction industry would facilitate the
implementing mass customization. This is based on the argument that the customer
must be involved in specifying the product for true mass customization to take
place, since analysis of architecture and the construction industry with regard to
the strategic capabilities of mass customization have been suggesting opportunities
for improvement, especially in terms of the realization processes and the inte-
gration of customers for near-mass customization performance outlet.
2 Methodology
When doing so, i.e., arguing which procurement form that would best facilitate
mass customization performance outlet, facilitate is deﬁned as rendering proba-
bility and/or substantiate the use of mass customization philosophy in a con-
struction process. Best indicates the one with highest likelihood for facilitating
mass customization of the normally used procurement forms not implying that
other forms of procurement under certain conditions could not be at least as
preferable.
Enabling Facilitation of Mass Customization
181

Procurement implies both the dedicated processes where tenders are invited to
bid on a project and the process following where different collaboration forms are
used to undertake the construction; different procurement forms yield different
collaboration form per say, traditional procurement normally calls for traditional
ways of collaborating where procurement forms such as partnering enforces the
use of value-based collaboration, not taking special cases into account. As men-
tioned before, ‘‘best’’ indicates the one form with highest likelihood of facilitating
mass customization, the selected indicators or variables of this is as follows: The
contractors’ ability to:
1. Aid constructively with project analysis or with planning of the project before
the on-site contract start
2. Find solutions in accordance with the demands in the speciﬁcations and also to
accommodate the client’s needs and wishes within the agreed contract frame-
work/term
3. Meet time schedules and hand over the contract on time
4. Enter dialog regarding additional works and pricing of these
5. Participate in a constructive dialog and contribute to a good working rela-
tionship between the projects key personnel
6. Be considerate to the construction sites vicinity, e.g., neighbors, tenants, other
personnel, and any users of the building under construction
7. Contribute toward completing a satisfactory handing over
8. Deliver information regarding facility management in accordance with the
demands in the speciﬁcations.
This is all summed into a dependent variable called customer satisfaction (CS)
given the deﬁnition that mass customization takes place when a product which is
designed to meet the needs of a particular customer [21] and where the contractor
conducts a dialog with the individual customer to help them articulate their needs,
to identify the precise offering that fulﬁlls those needs, and to make customized
products for them [13]. To test how different procurement and collaboration
methods affect the CS procurement form is selected as a test factor.
To sum up, the dependent measure is the CS, and the factor affecting it is the
procurement method. To test the hypotheses that: (1) Partnering results in better
marks in CS than either of the traditional procurement methods; and (2) that
Turnkey Contracts is the second best alternative to Partnering Contracts; a one-
way ANOVA statistical tests were carried out using SPSS.

struction Sector containing benchmark results from 2,318 cases.
The test comprises of a one-way ANOVA and uses planned comparisons to test
the hypotheses that: (1) Partnering results in better marks in CS than either of the
traditional procurement methods; and (2) that Turnkey Contracts is the second best

customization based on aforementioned premises.

It looks as though CS is highest when the procurement form Partnering Contract
(3.7296) is used and lowest when using Trade Contracts (3.2690).
The next part of the output (Table 2) reports a test of the assumption of
homogeneity of variance (Levene’s test). For these data, the assumption of
homogeneity of variance has been met, because our signiﬁcance is 0.095, which is
larger than the criterion of 0.05.
Table 3 is the main ANOVA summary table; it shows us that because the
observed signiﬁcance value is less than 0.05, we can say that there was a signif-
icant effect of selected procurement form on CS. However, at this stage, we still do
not know exactly what the effect of the procurement form was (we do not know
which groups differed).
Because there were speciﬁc hypotheses, some contrast needs to be speciﬁed.
Table 4 shows the codes used. The ﬁrst contrast compares Partnering Contract
(coded with -4) against all the other procurement forms (all coded with 1). The
second contrast compares Turnkey Contract (coded with -3) against all other
(coded with 1). Note that the codes for each contrast sum to zero and that in
contrast 2, Partnering Contract has been coded with a 0 because it is excluded from
that contrast.

Table 5 shows the signiﬁcance of the two contrasts speciﬁed above. Because
homogeneity of variance was met, this means that the part of the table labeled; Does
not assume equal variances can be ignored. The t-test for the ﬁrst contrast tells us that
Partnering Contract was signiﬁcantly different from the other Contract forms (it is
signiﬁcantly different because the value in the column labeled Sig. is less than 0.05).
Looking at the means, this tells that the average CS using Partnering Contract was
signiﬁcantly higher (3.7296) than the average CS for all the other Contract forms
combined (3.528). The second contrast (together with the descriptive statistics) tells
that the CS after Main, Major, and Trade Contracts were signiﬁcantly lower than after
Turnkey Contracts (again, signiﬁcantly different because the value in the column
labeled Sig. is less than 0.05). As such it can be concluded that Partnering Contracts
produces signiﬁcantly better CS than all other Contract forms, and Main, Major, and
Trade Contracts produces signiﬁcantly worse CS than Turnkey Contracts.
3.1 Calculating the Effect Size
Table 3 provides three measures of variance: the between-group effect (SSM), the
within-subject effect (MSR), and the total amount of variance in the data (SST).
This can be used to calculate omega squared (x2):
x2 ¼ SSM  dfM

SST þ MSR
Substituting from output in Table 3:
x2 ¼ 2:742  4
ð Þ0:075

For the contrasts, the effect sizes will be:

The result for contrasts 1 and 2 is as follows:

Therefore, as well as being statistically signiﬁcant, this effect is medium, and so

small to medium effect size. All signiﬁcant values are reported at p \ 0.05. There
was a signiﬁcant effect of procurement (Contract) form on CS, F(4, 44) = 9.2,
x2 = 0.48. Planned contrasts revealed that Partnering Contracts produced sig-
niﬁcantly better CS than all other Contract forms, t(44) = -3.1, r = 0.18, and that
Main, Major, and Trade Contracts produced signiﬁcantly CS than Turnkey Con-
tracts (Partnering held aside), t(44) = -2.5, r = 0.12.
4 Discussion
So why this focus on selecting the right procurement or contract form, because
studies have shown, including this, that different contracting form yield different
outcomes and different processes under which the consumers’ demands are met.
When using Partnering or Turnkey Contracts, numerous advantages and induce-
ments are highlighted in the literature (e.g., minimization of costs, bidding prices
and waste; increased efﬁciency and effectiveness; increased innovation; better
quality [6, 17, 18]; better design; better sharing of project risks [14]; better use of
labor; improved communication; reduction in conﬂicts, claims, and disputes [9, 11,
17, 18]; higher level of supply chain collaboration [2, 4], and more information in
the decision-making [1]. Also [8] described partnering as a way to avoid conﬂicts,
minimize costs, reduce time, and yield a better working environment. The possible
cost savings ranged from 5 to 30 %, and possible time savings ranged from 10 to
40 % [6, 8].
Furthermore, besides the included key factors contained in partnering, it also
uses a clearly deﬁned risk allocation with gain share/pain share to manage the
process. In this model, parties contractually commit to their contribution levels and
required proﬁt and then place these at risk in undertaking the project. This provides
a powerful incentive to achieve project goals [3].
To answer the why, the step-forward in the construction industry is to deliver
added value, as expressed by the consumer, not only in terms of end product, but
of process as well. An open consumer-oriented building process does not mean
that an inﬁnite number of options have to be offered. In a tailor-made house, the
single desired option is enough. An inﬁnite offer of variety is the other extreme of
consumer satisfaction. In a process of mass customization, a limited number of
options can be sufﬁcient. This is a strategic decision, which will differ from
company, market segment, location and time. In all cases, it is important to keep
the customer satisﬁed. He wants to know the selection to choose from and how to
choose and since every option is measured against the available budget, the
consumer wants to know the cost implication of every combination of options.

5 Conclusion
The aim of this paper was to investigate which of the normally used procurement
or contracts forms in the Danish construction industry would facilitate the
implementing mass customization, based on the argument that the customer must
be involved in specifying the product for true mass customization to take place and
in terms of the realization processes and the integration of customers for near-mass
customization performance outlet. So, to apply mass customization successfully on
an industry such as the construction industry, an effective and efﬁcient customer
requirement collecting and implementing platform, high-performance manufac-
turing processes, and well-maintained supply chain support are required. To
facilitate functions of these enablers, a contracting model that facilitates the
implementing mass customization is necessary. In this study, there is here found
strong indicators pointing out that to succeed implementing near-mass custom-
ization in the construction industry the best choice would be Partnering or Turnkey
Contracts because Partnering and Turnkey Contract differed signiﬁcantly from the
other contract forms in case of average CS, where Partnering Contract was rated
higher (3.7296) and Turnkey (3.6530) than the average CS for all the other con-
tract forms combined (3.528). Looking at homogeneity of variance, contrasts and t
tests, all showed great signiﬁcance, as such it can be conclude that Partnering
Contracts produces signiﬁcantly better CS than all other contract forms, and Main,
Major, and Trade Contracts produces signiﬁcantly worse CS than Turnkey Con-
tracts, thus improving the likelihood of best facilitating the implementing mass
customization in the construction industry

Extending Conﬁguration and Validation
of Customized Products by Implicit
Features in Virtual Reality Environments
Angel Bachvarov, Stoyan Maleshkov and Dimo Chotrov
Abstract The virtual reality (VR) is an environment, which enables the proactive
participation of the customers in deﬁning their needs and requirements within the
product development process. However, the traditional approaches for representation
of physically existing objects (products) using VR show only a few of their properties
(geometric, structural, and topological). The potential of VR as technology for efﬁ-
cient validation of still not-materialized artifacts in the early design stages is not fully
exploited. In order to improve the immersion and to enable customers in conﬁguring
more aspects of the newly created customized products, as well as to validate these
through ‘‘experiencing,’’ we propose the concept of so-called implicit features rep-
resenting ‘‘hidden’’ product properties (i.e., magnetization, surface roughness, and
humidity), which normally are not part of the object model, cannot be perceived
directly, and are not exposed for conﬁguration. Here, we discuss the implicit feature
concept, their implementation, and their use for customer co-design.

A process in which the customer selects different attributes and attribute values
from a ﬁnite set of options and combines them into a ﬁnal individualized product is
known as product conﬁguration process. In the product conﬁguration, the

costumers act as co-designers of the new product. Actually, it is a two-way con-
tinuous exploration and interaction between the product (its respective producer)
and the customers in which the customer needs are identiﬁed, processed, priori-
tised, and translated in engineering requirements on which base the customized
product shall be materialized. Beside that, a validation of the generated product
conﬁguration can be made before its materialization.
The virtual reality (VR) provides an environment, which enables the proactive
participation of the customers in deﬁning their needs and requirements and
interactive multimodal validation of the properties of the conﬁgured products in
the early stages of their development. Using VR technologies, the customers are
allowed to carry out more efﬁcient mapping of their functional requirements into
the physical domain, and then, they are able not only to observe or simulate the
individual creation, but also to ‘‘experience’’ it through multiple sensorial chan-
nels, e.g., visual, audible, and tactile. The primary source for the representation of
the virtual object (VO) properties in the virtual environment is a combination of
multiple presentational elements corresponding to the individual modalities used
in the VR system. This is especially useful and efﬁcient in cases of complex
engineering products when multiple decisions have to be taken related to various
aspects of the product.
2 Brief Explanation of Virtual Objects
The VOs, hereafter referred to only as ‘‘objects,’’ are elements that make up the
virtual environment and represent the real existing (materialized) objects, e.g.,
products. They play the role of an interface through which the users receive the
virtual experience and the perception of presence as shown in Fig. 1.
According to the formalization presented in [1], the VO can be observed as an
artifact resulting from human activity, which has an extension in the physical
domain and creates a sense of presence. The VO is deﬁned as follows:
VO ¼ E; MC; VP; PP; FR; ES
f
g
where
E
is the sum of its constituent elements
MC
is a plurality of morphological characteristics
VP
is the set of visual properties
PP
is the set of physical properties
FR
is the set of functional relationships
ES
is the state of being.
However, this is a rather complicated and practically unusable scheme
description. A more practical representation that allows deﬁnition of VOs prop-
erties is proposed by [2]. According to it, VOs similar to the physical ones are
190
A. Bachvarov et al.

characterized by three main aspects that determine the speciﬁcs of the process of
their creation: (1) shape, (2) function and (3) behavior.
Here, Shape refers to the ‘‘appearance’’ of the VO and its geometric properties
as well as to the spatial relations between its constituent elements describing the
object’s structure (topology). Usually, the ‘‘appearance’’ is associated with visual
sensory channel, but part of it may be associated with other senses: hearing, tactile
sense, etc. Function refers to a set of elementary actions that the VO executes
autonomously or in response to an external stimulus to realize its behavior.
Behavior refers to the way in which the individual VO changes dynamically and
performs its separate functions, usually presented in terms of conditions, data
exchange, events, and internal restrictions. The behavior and functions are similar
in nature, but their separation is necessary for the easy deﬁnition of dynamic
objects.
In accordance with one of its deﬁnitions [3], VR can be observed as a high-end
user interface of a specialized computer system that allows the user to ‘‘immerse’’
and ‘‘experience’’ interactively real-time simulation of VOs in an artiﬁcial envi-
ronment using all his sensory channels. The basic paradigm used today in the
design of advanced user interfaces [4, 5] considers the communication with the
user as a transfer of messages (at semantic level) or presentation elements (at
physical level). In this context, the creation of VOs can be seen as a multimodal
combination of various presentation elements carrying information, which pro-
duces a picture in the user’s mind of the VO’s nature and properties.
Figure 2a, b shows a comparison between a real (i.e., materialized) and a VO.
In case of a real object (Fig. 2a), the source of the process of forming the object
picture is performed by the real physically existing object itself [4]. Such an object
may be inﬂuenced by its environment in various ways, e.g., through ﬁlling a part of
the physical space, causing changes in the surrounding objects, and releasing of
substances. These effects of the real objects are registered by the user’s sensory
organs, then are transformed in perceptions, and at the end are interpreted as a
mental picture of the object. In case of a VO (Fig. 2b), the primary source of
information for the nature and properties of the object is not the VO itself but the

combination of several different presentation elements. Each of these presentation
elements is produced individually, and all of them are activated simultaneously as
a result of the user actions.
3 Representation of Object Properties in VR
Environments
In general, the VO model is a description thereof in the form of a special data
structure. Depending on its type, it can contain information about the geometry,
the structure (topology), the behavior, etc. When used in VR systems, these data
have to be processed and produced a virtual representation through synthetic
‘‘sensory images’’ of all the objects and their spatial and temporal organization in
the virtual environment. The creation of the sensory images of the individual
objects can be divided into two phases: (1) representation and (2) implementation.
In the representation phase, a choice is made how the VOs will look, sound, and
be felt by the user. In the implementation phase, the selected representation
method is implemented through a hardware and software system for VR presen-
tation. The choice of an appropriate form of presentation is highly dependent on
the purpose of the respective application and the nature of the properties, which
have to be presented in the virtual environment. In certain cases, when presenting
quantitative information, the user needs to retrieve numeric values based on the
perceived sensory image. This can be done directly (by numerical tables) or
indirectly (through a variety of methods for displaying data in the different sensory
channels). In other cases, the information to be presented is of qualitative nature or
Fig. 2 Comparison between a material and b VO
192
A. Bachvarov et al.

requires combination of quantitative and qualitative data produced in form of signs
and symbols that require additional interpretation by the user.
Summarizing research work in this ﬁeld as in [2, 5–9], a general practical
approach for managing properties of VOs in virtual environments has been
developed. The approach includes the following four steps: (1) Choosing the
property to be presented, (2) choosing the parameters of the virtual environment,
which will transmit the information about the presented property, (3) mapping the
properties to be presented to the selected parameter, and (4) implementation in the
virtual environment.
4 Implicit Properties
The term implicit property or implicit feature is not unknown. In the methodology
of Kansei Engineering, it is used to describe the emotional experiences and needs
of the customers, which are difﬁcult to be quantiﬁed. Further, in the computer
science, the implicit object features are the features of each object, which are not
pre-computed/evaluated in case of information search [10]. We use the meaning of
implicit features in completely different and new context. We propose an extension
of the classiﬁcation of the standardized properties of the material and VOs con-
sidering the way in which they can be perceived by the observer—perceived
directly or ‘‘hidden.’’ According to this, the object properties are divided in two
major groups:
1. Explicit properties: These are the properties of the objects that can be perceived
immediately by the observer through his/her senses (e.g., shape, color, and
size).
2. Implicit properties: These are the properties of the objects that cannot be
perceived by the observer through his/her senses (remain hidden), e.g., ﬁelds,
radiation, humidity, and toxicity. They require expansion of the observer’s
sensory range.
The traditional approach for presentation of objects in VR environment is
mainly based on their visual attributes (e.g., color, type, texture, and thickness of
the lines). An example for this is shown in Fig. 3 for a hairdryer. The user can
perceive its shape, color, topology, dimensions, and assembly structure. Normally,
he can explore and interact with the VO trough a set of commands or gestures,
which change its spatial position, size, and attribute values. The new approach
aims at extending the information content and deepening the immersive repre-
sentation of the object model in a VR environment through their enhancement with
a predeﬁned set of the above-explained implicit features.
An example for this is shown in Fig. 4. Here, beside the visually perceived
attributes the user can get additional information concerning the functional

behavior of the object. In this case, for example, he/she is able to explore and/or
conﬁgure how the different combination of the hairdryer switches controlling the
fan speed and heat output can inﬂuence the operating range. Further, the user can
deﬁne the working area, which gives him/her an immediate idea for the safe way
of use of the appliance. In this case, the operating range depends on the temper-
ature and airﬂow distribution at the front of the appliance and could be observed as
a complex implicit feature of the hairdryer. Depending on the needs, the properties
can be presented only visually or in combination with soniﬁcation (by using
sounds and noises to bring out information). Further, additional technical infor-
mation related to the hairdryer operation can be presented such as the distribution
of the housing surface temperature or noise emission (sound with respective
characteristics) under different working conditions and modes.
From the point of view of the VR software system architecture, the implicit
features are classiﬁed and described in a separate data structure independent from
the programming application in use for building-up the geometry and for inter-
action in the VR environment. The mapping of the features to the scene geometry,
attributes, and different sensory channels is carried out during the representation of
the objects in the virtual world and provides the possibility to manipulate and
modify the features as well as the related geometry directly in the virtual envi-
ronment as shown in Fig. 4.
5 Practical Implementation of Implicit Features
Two different approaches have been developed and implemented for the repre-
sentation of implicit object features in VR environments: (a) creating a dedicated
software module as part of our in-house developed VR system and (b) extending
the functionality of a commercially available VR software package.
The ﬁrst method described in details below includes several additional com-
ponents to our VR software system architecture built on the top of the SceniX
scene graph software development kit designed by NVIDIA, which aims at rep-
resenting virtual scenes interactively in high quality, taking advantage of the latest
improvements in graphics hardware.
The second technique for implementing implicit features takes advantage of the
functionality of commercial VR programming packages (in our research, we use
Virtools) and applies build-in instruments for describing attributes and behavior of
the VOs. In order to prepare a virtual model with implicit feature presentation for
exploration in a VR environment, the user has to follow a number of steps as
shown in the activity diagram in Fig. 5.
In the ﬁrst place, the virtual model has to be designed in a digital content
creation (DCC) or computer-aided design (CAD) application, for example, 3D
Studio Max or SolidWorks. When the model is ready, it has to be exported to an
appropriate ﬁle format supported by the VR application (i.e., 3DS, VRML,
COLLADA, and OBJ). The assignment (mapping) of implicit features to the
Extending Conﬁguration and Validation of Customized Products
195

model follows. For the purpose, a special conﬁguration application (Conﬁgurator)
has been developed, which provides the user with the ability to import a model and
assign implicit features to it—this process is called implicit feature mapping. The
implicit features exposed by an object are represented by effects—one effect for
each implicit feature. Effects are used to describe how an implicit feature is to be
presented to the user by applying different sensorial stimuli. We concentrate on
three types of sensorial stimulation—visual, audio, and haptic. Each effect pro-
vides different settings that can be modiﬁed by the user—for example, there are

two types of audio effects—constant effects that are played continuously and
effects that are played only during the period of time when the user interacts with
the object in some way. After the implicit feature mapping process is ﬁnished, the
conﬁgurator generates an implicit feature mapping description ﬁle, which
describes the effects assigned to each of the objects features.
To explore and/or modify the built scene in a VR environment, the user acti-
vates the VR application. Two types of hardware conﬁgurations can be imple-
mented: The application can run on a desktop machine or mobile device or a
powerwall or cluster conﬁguration can be realized as shown in Fig. 6.
The hardware conﬁguration to be used together with additional settings is
speciﬁed in a conﬁguration ﬁle read by the application when it starts. After the user
loads the virtual scene and the description ﬁle, he/she can explore the selected
model/scene in VR environment.
The process of mapping two different presentation elements (visual, audible,
and tactile) in order to present various object features simultaneously within a
validation step can be observed in Fig. 7. The ﬁgure shows a virtual model of an
electronic appliance case extended with additional implicit features (in this case

information about surface roughness of the individual areas of the case which is
extremely important for the production). Using the extended information, an
audible presentation element is conﬁgured to present the different surface qualities.
The assignment of presentation elements to the individual object properties is
made using the conﬁgurator application upon selecting the respective VO from the
scene tree. As a result, the user (customer) receives multimodal real-time feedback
for selected implicit feature or features of the VO, which enables him/her to
validate in terms to compare his initial requirements with the estimated functional
properties of the newly created product conﬁguration or to modify it further.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce the concept of implicit object features and propose their
presentation in VR environments through mapping on different sensor channel
modalities in order to extend the conﬁguration and validation capabilities within
early stages of the product development process enabling more active and efﬁcient
participation of the customer. Two directions for implementation of this approach
have been followed: (1) development of a dedicated software module as part of our
in-house developed VR system and (2) extending the functionality of commercially
available VR software packages. This work can be considered a major step in
transforming the VR technology from its current state of being only a high-end
presentation show case toward an important tool for exploration and validation of
design features contributing to the process of front-loading for reducing design
cycles and ‘‘materialization time’’ of highly customized products with direct active
involvement of the customers. Combining visual, auditory, and tactile sensory
channels possesses a potential for change of the traditional way in which the cus-
tomers perceive, modify, and evaluate product models in engineering applications
in the ﬁeld of product conﬁguration of individualized products designed and
manufactured according to speciﬁc user needs. More extensive usability study is
planned to explore the combination of various presentation elements, information
content enhancement, and created synergies in speciﬁc user groups.

Extending the Theoretical Framework
of Mass Customization: Initial
and Adaptive Solution Space Development
for High-Variety Production
Environments
Frank Steiner
Abstract In
today’s
markets,
customer
needs
are
becoming
increasingly
heterogeneous. In response to the diverse customer needs, companies are often-
times forced to offer a broad product variety in order to meet the individual
demands of their customers. Being confronted with such a business environment,
manufacturers need to establish new business models that are capable of dealing
with high levels of heterogeneity, such as mass customization. However, as
offering limitless choice is economically unfeasible, manufacturers have to
develop a suitable solution space by clearly deﬁning which product variants will be
offered and which options will be explicitly excluded from the ﬁrm’s offering. In
this context, this paper introduces the distinction between initial and adaptive
solution space development (before and after market launch) and discusses the
interrelation between these two modes of deﬁning a product offering for high-
variety production environments.

1 Introduction
Business success in general depends on a company’s ability to meet the customer
needs in a speciﬁc market [1]. Therefore, it is indispensable for any ﬁrm to closely
monitor the needs of its customers and to develop a product offering that meets
these needs [2]. However, as customer needs in today’s markets are becoming
increasingly heterogeneous [3], it is rather unlikely that manufacturers will be able

to meet customer expectations with standardized, mass-produced product offer-
ings. Instead, ﬁrms are oftentimes forced to offer a broad product variety in order
to meet the individual demands of their customers [4, 5]. Nevertheless, it is
important to emphasize that the development of a broader product portfolio has to
be done in a careful and purposeful manner: Offering limitless choice is eco-
nomically unfeasible [6]. Therefore, variety should be offered only for those
product attributes, along which customer needs diverge and that can be aligned
with the existing product architecture [7, 8]. Subsequently, companies, which are
targeting the exploitation of heterogeneous customer needs, have to develop a
solution space of available product variants that acts as a link between the diverse
customer needs on the one hand and the manufacturing capabilities of the com-
pany on the other hand [4]. Salvador et al. [7] term this capability ‘‘solution space
development,’’ i.e., understanding the customers’ idiosyncratic needs and deriving
a suitable set of product variants from this knowledge.
The capability of solution space development does not seem to be considered
yet to a large extend in the literature. This is rather surprising as the delineation of
a suitable solution space appears to be a fundamental task for any manufacturer
that is facing heterogeneous markets. Piller [6], for example, states that ‘‘[s]etting
the solution space becomes one of the foremost competitive challenges of a mass
customization company.’’ Nevertheless, this issue has not been discussed in detail;
to the best of our knowledge, there is no study available that exclusively explores
mechanisms for the development of a solution space for high-variety offerings. For
this reason, this paper will focus on the strategic capability of developing a suitable
solution space for heterogeneous markets in the following.
By addressing the before-mentioned gaps in the literature, this paper makes
several important contributions to research on new product development in high-
variety business environments in general and to the ﬁeld of mass customization in
particular: (1) The paper deﬁnes the terms ‘‘initial solution space development’’
and ‘‘adaptive solution space development’’ and thereby contributes to an in-depth
understanding of deﬁning high-variety product offerings. (2) Furthermore, we
provide a literature review on methods that allow companies to gain an under-
standing of the ‘‘idiosyncratic needs’’ of their customers [cp. 7]. (3) Lastly, the
paper discusses the interrelation of initial and adaptive solution space development
and derives respective managerial implications for deﬁning product offerings for
high-variety production environments.
2 Theoretical Framework for Solution Space Development
We deﬁne the term ‘‘solution space’’ in the context of high-variety production
environments as the sum of all available product variants in a company’s product
offering. This deﬁnition follows the argumentation put forward by von Hippel [9],

production system allows the customers. In order to deﬁne this solution space, a
company has to decide ‘‘what it will offer—and what it will not [provide]’’ [7].
This managerial decision process is necessary as offering limitless choice is
economically unfeasible and the solution space has to be in line with the pre-
existing manufacturing capabilities of the company [9]. The result of this task is a
‘‘choice menu’’ of product features or product attributes that customers can choose
from in order to customize products that meet the individual customer needs [10].
Solution space development is a rather cross-functional task: On the one hand,
it is strongly interlinked with the technical environment of the product, but it also
has to take the respective market situation into account. This results from the fact
that the solution space has to act as a link between the heterogeneous customer
needs and the manufacturing capabilities of the company [4]. With regard to the
technical aspects, companies have to develop a comprehensive understanding of
the customization options that are technically feasible in the generation of product
variety. Piller [6], for example, suggests the three generic design dimensions ﬁt,
form, and functionality as a starting point for this analysis. Customization based on
ﬁt means to manufacture a product according to measurements provided by the
customer, such as body measurements or dimensions of a physical object. Cus-
tomization of form relates to aesthetic aspects, such as the selection of colors,
styles, applications, cuts, or ﬂavors. The aspect of functionality addresses rather
technical attributes such as speed and precision [6]. Functionality, for example, is
the traditional starting point for customization in industrial markets: In this
domain, machines or components have to be adjusted to ﬁt in with an existing
manufacturing system from a technical point of view [11]. However, mere tech-
nical feasibility does not indicate a business opportunity. Therefore, the idiosyn-
cratic needs of the customers have to be considered for successful solution space
development [7]. If at all, customer needs are most likely heterogeneous for some
product attributes, only. Subsequently, it is not proﬁtable to offer all product
conﬁgurations that are feasible from a technical point of view [6], but companies
need to identify the so-called key value attributes [12]. Generating product variety
along these product attributes offers the chance of truly creating additional value
for the customers [13].
This analysis indicates that there indeed is a broad body of the literature that is
concerned with the realization of a mass customization strategy and respective
strategic capabilities. However, despite this ongoing research on mass custom-
ization and the relevant strategic capabilities, no research so far addresses the issue
of solution space development in an integrated and holistic manner. For this
reason, we present a detailed literature review on the capability of solution space
development in the remainder of this paper. With this research, we extend the
current understanding of interrelation of deﬁning product offerings for high-variety
production environments and also provide respective managerial implications for
mass customization practitioners.

2.1 Solution Space Development: A Two-Stage Process
Solution space development in markets with high levels of heterogeneity has to be
clearly distinguished from deﬁning a product offering in the context of a more
homogeneous business setting [6]. As mass production aims at reaching as many
customers as possible with standardized products, manufacturers have to develop
products that address common needs among all targeted users. In product domains
with high customer need heterogeneity, on the contrary, ﬁrms need to identify
those product attributes along which customer needs diverge the most [7]. These
different approaches to solution space development also cause signiﬁcant differ-
ences in the role of uncertainty [14, 15]: When customer needs are highly heter-
ogeneous, customers will most likely show varying preferences in terms of product
options [16]. Subsequently, companies have to offer more product variety, which
in term may lead to higher levels of complexity in all planning tasks of the value
chain [17]. As complex tasks are more difﬁcult to predict for the respective
decision maker, the increase in complexity ultimately leads to a higher level of
uncertainty [18].
This leads to a severe dilemma for product managers that are faced with the
task of solution space development in heterogeneous markets: On the one hand,
the market success of new products is contingent upon successful solution space
development. Only if product managers are successful in understanding the idio-
syncratic needs of the customers, an appropriate product offering, which has a
chance to be successful in the respective market, can be derived [19]. On the other
hand, as shown above, the impact of uncertainty on developing a solution space is
particularly strong in the context of heterogeneous markets. In consequence, it
becomes nearly impossible to derive a product offering that is in line with the
current and future market demands at the same time [20, 21]. This dilemma causes
an adaptation problem: Decision-making processes need to provide sufﬁcient
ﬂexibility so that adjustments to the initially designed solution space can be made,
as new information is gained [22]. For this reason, Tseng and Piller [23] propose a
so-called knowledge loop that allows to acquire new knowledge in an iterative
manner, so that the efﬁciency and quality of the solution space can be constantly
enhanced.
It becomes apparent that product management should approach the task of
solution space development for heterogeneous markets by means of a two-step
procedure. Thus, we suggest to separate between tasks of ‘‘initial solution space
development’’ and ‘‘adaptive solution space development.’’ In accordance with
Verganti and Buganza [24], we suggest to differentiate between the point of time,
when the solution space is conceived for the ﬁrst time in its initial form and the
time after market launch, where the solution space will be continuously improved
over time. This suggested dichotomy is based on the ‘‘classic distinction in
organizational thinking between situations that can be described as certain, pre-
dictable, well-understood, or routine and situations that are characterized as
unpredictable, intractable, or uncertain’’ [25]. Before market launch, the product
204
F. Steiner

itself does not exist yet and decisions have to be made under uncertainty [26].
However, as soon as the initial solution space has been launched to the market,
performance indicators can be derived [27] and the existing solution space can be
adapted whenever insufﬁciencies are detected. In the following, we will discuss
these two concepts—initial and adaptive solution space development—in more
detail.
2.2 Developing an Initial Solution Space Before Market
Launch
This paper extends the deﬁnition of solution space development of Salvador et al.
[7] by introducing the differentiation between initial and adaptive tasks of delin-
eating a suitable product offering. In this context, initial solution space develop-
ment is deﬁned as the sum of all product management activities that are necessary
to deﬁne those variants of the new product that will be made available at market
launch. While this may consist of tasks such as the elicitation of customer needs
and the selection of necessary product features, solution space development does
not include any product design activities nor the deﬁnition of an underlying
product architecture. This deﬁnition clearly indicates at what time companies need
to engage in initial solution space development activities: For every new-to-the-
ﬁrm product and for every new-generation product, an initial solution space needs
to be deﬁned before the new product offering is introduced to the market.
The fact that the initial solution space has to be drafted before market launch
brings about a speciﬁc characteristic of this phase in product management: As the
product has not yet been released to the market, the product itself does not exist at
the time when the respective decision-making process takes place. That means that
the customers, on the one hand, cannot interact with the new product itself, but can
only experience a mere verbal description or a prototype and are thus not able to
provide fully accurate feedback concerning the new product [28]. The manufac-
turer, on the other hand, does not have access to realistic data on customer demand
and purchase behavior [29]. For these reasons, neither the company nor the
potential customers can beneﬁt from existing usage experience or objective
product data [26]. Subsequently, the initial product offering has to be derived
under conditions of high uncertainty, and it is very unlikely that a manufacturer
can indeed deﬁne an ideal initial solution space under these circumstances. It is
simply not possible to predict all technological advances and changes in customer
demand [30].
We suggest two major objectives that are relevant for initial solution space
development: Firstly, manufacturers need to assess which product design param-
eters are relevant and feasible in the context of the solution space development
process at hand. In this context, ‘‘[d]esign constraints may be functions of the laws
of nature, the environment in which the product will function, governmental
Extending the Theoretical Framework of Mass Customization
205

regulations, or corporate decisions or policies’’ [31]. These restrictions need to be
considered, as an economically efﬁcient production can be realized only, if all
predetermined product options in the solution space meet the preexisting capa-
bilities and resources of the company’s manufacturing system [9]. The result of
this assessment should be a collection of all product variants that could realisti-
cally be provided by the speciﬁc manufacturer. Secondly, the company has to
identify the customer requirements for the respective product domain [31]. For this
purpose, companies have to understand the customers’ idiosyncratic needs and
derive a suitable set of product variants that corresponds with the heterogeneous
customer demand [7]. After deriving all relevant and feasible product options and
identifying the customer requirements, these two sets of product variants can be
compared. In consequence, the sum of all congruent elements will form the initial
solution space.
These two objectives already provide rough guidelines for the execution of
initial solution space development. However, it remains unclear, how companies
should approach these two objectives operatively. Therefore, we will derive
suggestions for particular methods or managerial activities, which could be applied
for deﬁning an initial product offering, from related knowledge domains. With
regard to the ﬁrst objective mentioned above—the identiﬁcation of all relevant and
feasible product design parameters—companies could adopt managerial approa-
ches from several related ﬁelds, as this decision is inﬂuenced by technical, eco-
nomical, and normative limitations [31]. One very well documented approach for
understanding the technical as well as economical limitations of the product at
hand could be the application of the so-called quality function deployment (QFD)
method. QFD originally is a method for transferring customer needs into technical
product speciﬁcations [32]. However, the approach builds on the use of transfor-
mation matrices that enable decision makers to visualize the relationships among
individual product speciﬁcations [33]. That way, trade-offs between certain
product attributes or parameters can be identiﬁed and technical limits in the
generation of variants can be revealed [33]. Besides the technical and economical
limitations, initial solution space development also needs to take normative lim-
itations in form of laws, regulatory standards, or social norms into account. Certain
industrial standards, for example, could speciﬁcally prohibit product variety with
regard to speciﬁc parts or components [34]. Furthermore, certain technologies
might be protected by patents and have to be excluded from the feasible solutions
or require licensing before they can be considered in the respective solution space.
In this context, patent analysis might be a suitable methodological approach to
make allowances for these normative limitations [35].
Beyond identifying potential limitations of the respective product offering,
initial solution space development also has to build up an understanding of the
relevant key value attributes in the market [12]. From a methodological per-
spective, most conventional market research techniques could be applied for this
purpose. However, due to the high level of heterogeneity in customer needs,
companies might have to refrain from using such methods, as they have been
developed for the purpose of revealing ‘‘average’’ customer needs, i.e., ﬁnding
206
F. Steiner

commonalities among potential customers [36]. In heterogeneous markets, how-
ever, companies should try to identify the differences in customer needs [7].
Similarly, Ogawa and Piller [37] claim that common market research techniques
are not administrable in the case of high levels of customer need heterogeneity and
high numbers of possible product variants. Subsequently, market research methods
have to be reﬁned in order to be applicable in today’s changing market environ-
ment [38].
Furthermore, the identiﬁcation of customer needs might be hampered by the
fact that the customers oftentimes simply do not know what they really want in a
product [37]. For example, latent needs may not be mentioned by the customers,
because they are considered to be a basic prerequisite and might be taken for
granted. Other need information may not be transferred as customers are either not
able to correctly express these needs or they are not aware of them [20]. In such a
context of low preference insight, initial solution space development needs to
implement speciﬁc organizational processes and methods in order to proactively
learn about the latent needs of current or potential customers [27]. For this reason,
the literature suggests different market research techniques such as focus groups,
conjoint analysis, or customer surveys [33]. In particular, the conjoint analysis
seems to be a suitable methodological approach to capture the heterogeneity of
customer needs concerning speciﬁc product attributes [39, 40]. Some researchers
have developed methods for solution space deﬁnition which build on a conjoint
analysis methodology. Here, the approach is not used to identify the best product
variants, but options in a solution space that will be valued most by customers
[10].
Also, as customers might not fully understand the opportunities that arise with
new, disruptive technologies, they might orient themselves at the status quo of
technology when voicing their needs [41]. Subsequently, in order to avoid mis-
leading suggestions, companies may focus their market research activities on
speciﬁc users that have more technological know-how and that can make well-
informed and foresighted suggestions for new products. This is a similar view of
the customer as in the lead user concept put forward by von Hippel [42, 43]. Lead
users have well-expressed, current preferences that are ahead of the market and
that will become common needs of many customers in the future. Lead users are
not only aware of their needs, but they also have solutions for their own problems.
Furthermore, these users are willing to pass their solution knowledge to manu-
facturers and thereby actively contribute to the development of new products [44].
2.3 Adapting an Existing Solution Space
Whereas initial solution space development aims at deﬁning a suitable product
offering before the time of market launch, adaptive solution space development is
deﬁned as the sum of all management activities that are concerned with the
assessment of the market ﬁt of the existing solution space and potential changes to
Extending the Theoretical Framework of Mass Customization
207

this offering. For this purpose, an organization should constantly evaluate the ﬁt of
any exiting solution space with the heterogeneous customer demand within its
product domain. In case, the existing solution space does not show a sufﬁcient
level of ﬁt, the organization needs to revise, trim, or extend the available product
assortment in order to comply with changing customer needs and/or new tech-
nologies [7]. If such an adaptation of the solution space should become necessary,
this could manifest itself either in the introduction of new product variants that
meet new or previously undetected needs or in the elimination of underperforming
existing variants [17, 45].
In comparison with the phase of initial solution space development, there is
much more information available for the tasks of adaptation. As these management
activities only become relevant after market launch, there already is, by deﬁnition,
an existing product offering in the market and the manufacturer and the customers
can gain experience by interacting via this solution space. That means that on the
one hand, customers can beneﬁt from a real-life customer experience of actually
searching and buying suitable product variants from the solution space [24],
whereas the manufacturer, on the other hand, now has objective sales data
available that can be analyzed for the purpose of adaptation [27]. Such sales
performance data does not only reveal how often each product variant was sold,
but it could also provide detailed information about the conﬁguration and sales
process, which could be used to reveal potential pitfalls or shortcomings of the
transaction processes in use [46]. Thus, the level of available information is much
higher during the adaptation process than during the initial development of the
solution space, and subsequently, managers are not facing such high levels of
uncertainty during adaptive solution space development.
Similar to initial solution space development, there are two major objectives
that have to be addressed in the context of adaptive solution space development.
The ﬁrst objective is concerned with the ﬁt between the existing solution space and
the current customer demand in the respective market. Before any corrective
action can be taken, the level of ﬁt needs to be measured or controlled in some
way. For this purpose, companies need to identify proxy variables that could serve
as an indicator of the quality of the existing product offering. Only if such a
controlling mechanism has been established, companies can identify shortcomings
of their existing solution space. Salvador et al. [7] call this process of collecting
and analyzing data on customer transactions, behaviors, and experiences ‘‘cus-
tomer experience intelligence.’’ The second central objective of adaptive solution
space development is the tracking of social trends or new technological devel-
opments. As the necessity for adapting the solution space can result from unex-
pected changes in customer preferences [47] or technical turbulences [48],
companies should try to keep track of these developments, so that they can better
predict upcoming changes of their business environment.
This discussion of objectives of adaptive solution space development leads to
the question, which methods or management activities could be applied in order to
fulﬁll the above-mentioned goals. The ﬁrst objective of adaptive solution space
development is the constant assessment of the ﬁt between the existing product
208
F. Steiner

offering and the current customer needs. As the term ‘‘customer experience
intelligence’’ [7] indicates, this task builds upon the fact that there already is an
existing product offering available in the market, and that customers can interact
with real products and can experience these products in a real usage environment.
This experience, in turn, may lead to new suggestions for improvement [49]. It is
the companies’ task to collect these suggestions, so that they can react to these
customer impulses and adapt the existing product offerings, if necessary. For this
purpose, the manufacturers have to enable their customers to express their con-
cerns about the existing product offering. Methods for enabling the customers to
transfer this information range from simple feedback forms or questionnaires to
regular workshops with key customers [50]. Also, companies can make use of
Internet-based technologies such as toolkits or feedback mechanisms within the
conﬁgurator [51] or can interact with customers via key account management
systems [52]. In this context, it is important to notice that companies should not
rely on only one way to gather such customer feedback, but should provide
multiple channels for this interaction with customers [50].
Besides managerial activities for gathering direct customer feedback, there are
also methods that can serve as indicators for the quality of solution space ﬁt in a
more indirect manner. One possibility in this context is the analysis of sales data of
the current product offering. If such an analysis should reveal that certain product
variants are performing rather poorly, product management should consider to
eliminate the respective options from the product offering as the maintenance of
each option that is kept available causes substantial costs [53]. Another potential
indicator for the ﬁt of the existing solution space can be seen in the actual customer
behavior within the customization process, especially if the existing product
offering is available in an online conﬁgurator. In such a case, log ﬁles of the
customers’ browsing behavior—i.e., number of hits, the search history, or the
amount of time that was spent on a certain Web site—can be used for the purpose
of reﬁning the solution space [7, 54]. Using these data, a simple analysis of hits can
already provide information about the popularity of certain features, and partic-
ularly long page impression durations of individual pages could indicate that there
are certain pitfalls or shortcomings within the existing product offering [7].
In order to derive a solution space that meets current and future challenges
alike, it is imperative for product managers to apply corporate foresight to forecast
future developments of a company’s business environment [55]. In this context,
the second objective of adaptive solution space development is the tracking of
social trends and new technological developments, in order to detect changes in
customer preferences or technical turbulences as early as possible. Strategic
management literature offers several managerial approaches for forecasting
activities, which help companies to identify such disruptions of the business
environment and to turn them into business opportunities [56]. Research shows
that most corporate foresight activities, which are applied by product managers,
aim at the identiﬁcation of new customer requirements by analyzing cultural shifts
and gathering new information about customer needs [55]. Examples for such
Extending the Theoretical Framework of Mass Customization
209

methods are, for example, the analysis of interest groups such as online brand
communities [57, 58] or the use of lead user methodology [42, 43]
As mentioned above, the second important aspect of this task is the identiﬁ-
cation of emerging technologies by scanning the technological environment of the
product domain [55]. For this purpose, ﬁrms can apply rather simple methods such
as technology road maps [59] or more complex approaches such as scenario
analysis [60]. Scenarios consider many aspects such as stakeholder information,
technology road maps, key uncertainties, or social trends at the same time and try
to reduce this enormous amount of information into a limited number of possible
scenarios, which are documented in narratives that are much easier to understand
and grasp for the respective decision makers [61]. Rohrbeck and Gemünden [55]
show in their study that about two-thirds of the companies in the study sample
employ some form of a continuous technology-scanning activity, ranging from
technology road mapping to individually developed tools for the evaluation of
potentially applicable technologies. Normally, such tools aim at monitoring a
certain number of technologies and providing an assessment of the level of
maturity and deployment readiness of each of these technologies [55].
2.4 The Interrelation of Initial and Adaptive Solution Space
Development
After discussing the two modes of solution space development in more detail, this
chapter will try to shed light on the interrelation of the two concepts. This paper
conceptualizes initial and adaptive solution space development as tasks that take
place at different point of times during new product development. As the product
itself only becomes available at the time of market launch, initial and adaptive
solution space development are also characterized by different levels of uncer-
tainty: Deﬁning an initial product offering is subject to high levels of uncertainty,
whereas the adaptation of the existing solution space can beneﬁt from additional
information that becomes available after market launch. Based on these consid-
erations, the two modes of solution space development could be viewed as two sets
of tasks that compete for the same resources in the context of deﬁning a suitable
product offering. This argumentation identiﬁes a management trade-off in solution
space development: Companies have to decide how much effort they would like to
invest in the initial development of the solution space. Presumably, a higher
investment at an early stage enables the company to avoid costly adaptations after
market launch. However, this reasoning diminishes the role of adaptive solution
space development and describes it as a mere corrective mechanism that makes up
for ‘‘mistakes’’ have been made during the deﬁnition of the initial product offering.
However, in contrast to this evaluation, we rather regard initial and adaptive
solution space development as complementary tasks that supplement each other:
On the one hand, certain decisions during the deﬁnition of an initial product
210
F. Steiner

offering may affect the adaptability of the solution space at a later point of time.
For example, a company’s decision to use a certain technology for a new product
family might prohibit a change of technologies at a later point of time. However, if
the company considers ﬂexible interfaces during the initial conceptualization of
the product, adaptations of the resulting solution space may be realized with less
effort. On the other hand, adaptive solution space development is the only way to
integrate new technologies or to consider trends in customer demand, which could
not be foreseen at the time of market launch. Subsequently, this mode of recon-
sidering the existing product offering cannot be downgraded to a purely corrective
mechanism, but it should be carried out in a more proactive manner. Subsequently,
an optimal product offering can only be realized by balancing initial and adaptive
solution space development tasks in an integrated product management concept.
Having recognized these complementarities among initial and adaptive solution
space development, research in this ﬁeld might be able to beneﬁt from related
literature that describes similar interrelations. For example, product development
literature considers a similar complementary interrelation in the context of orga-
nizational learning. Organizational learning literature separates all possible orga-
nizational activities into two categories: exploration and exploitation [62].
Thereby, exploration describes all activities that engage in the pursuit of unknown
things and the integration of these aspects into the knowledge of the ﬁrm.
Exploitation, on the other hand, indicates actions that aim at the use and reﬁnement
of existing knowledge [cf. 62, 63]. Similar to initial and adaptive solution space
development, activities of exploration and exploitation compete for the same
resources in an organizational context. Therefore, companies have to decide how
to balance their investments in either set of activities. With regard to this trade-off
between exploration and exploitation, research observes ‘‘a tendency to substitute
exploitation of known alternatives for the exploration of unknown ones, to
increase the reliability of performance rather more than its mean’’ [63]. However,
such a focus on exploitation activities will inevitably destroy the competitive
position of any company in the long run, as innovation and renewal are essential
for the future viability of a company [62]. Therefore, it is necessary for organi-
zations to ﬁnd a suitable balance between exploitation and exploration. A broad
stream of management literature is concerned with such a balanced approach to
exploitation and exploration, namely organizational ambidexterity. Ambidexterity
describes a ﬁrm’s capability to successfully manage the daily business while
simultaneously being able to identify and adapt to new developments in the
business environment [64]. Subsequently, companies have to become ambidex-
trous organizations in order to ﬁnd the necessary balance between exploration and
exploitation. For this, organizational structures and strategies may have to be
reconsidered, as they are considered important promoters of ambidexterity [64].
This analogy from the organizational learning literature provides valuable
insights for the development of suitable solution spaces for heterogeneous markets.
Comparably to exploration and exploitation, initial and adaptive tasks of solution
space development have to be balanced in order to enable long-term success. For
this purpose, ﬁrms have to accept that adaptive solution space development is
Extending the Theoretical Framework of Mass Customization
211

more than just a corrective mechanism and should view the adaptation of existing
product offerings as an opportunity rather than a threat. However, such a shift in
the strategic mindset of a company might require fundamental changes to the
organization, just like in the case of companies that strive for becoming an
ambidextrous organization. Companies that struggle with this transition toward
higher levels of operational ﬂexibility can follow the recommendations and
managerial implications of agile manufacturing research [cf. 65–67]. The term
‘‘agile manufacturing’’ describes the ability of a manufacturer to successfully offer
a range of products, even though being exposed to market conditions of continuous
change [65]. Agility ‘‘requires ﬂexibility and responsiveness in strategies, tech-
nologies, people and systems’’ [66]. In this context, Yusuf et al. [67] even claim
that agile manufacturing goes beyond high levels of responsiveness or ﬂexibility,
but rather has to be considered as an orchestrated use of many different ﬂexible
production technologies and insights from manufacturing practices such as lean
production. Subsequently, a company that has adopted the principles of agile
manufacturing will be empowered to truly beneﬁt from the complementarities of
initial and adaptive solution space development.
3 Conclusion
This paper discusses the development of product offerings for heterogeneous
markets that demand high levels of product variety. So far, there are no studies
available that discuss the concept of solution space development with this level of
detail or that provide recommendations for potential activities or best practices in
this ﬁeld. Therefore, it can be stated that this paper contributes to the product
management research in several ways: Firstly, the paper extends the existing
deﬁnition of solution space development by deﬁning the terms ‘‘initial solution
space development’’ and ‘‘adaptive solution space development,’’ two different
modes of deﬁning a product offering for heterogeneous customer needs. Beyond
the theoretical conceptualization of these two approaches, the paper provides an
extensive literature review on methods and tools for deﬁning suitable high-variety
product offerings. Secondly, the paper provides a valuable contribution with regard
to the interrelation of initial and adaptive solution space development. In this
context, the paper shows that—similar to the concept of ambidexterity in orga-
nizational learning—initial and adaptive tasks of solution space development have
to be balanced in order to enable long-term success of a respective product
offering. With this ﬁnding, we make a useful contribution to the managerial
implications for the realization of successful solution space development, as our
results highlight the need for highly ﬂexible and responsive strategic and opera-
tional processes as a basic prerequisite for deﬁning a successful product offering
for high-variety environments.
Furthermore, the results of this paper could serve as a starting point for future
research in this ﬁeld of expertise. In the following, two potential gaps that require
212
F. Steiner

further research will be highlighted. Firstly, the validation of the theoretical
concepts that were developed in this paper could be strengthened with respective
qualitative or quantitative empirical evidence. For this purpose, it would be useful
to conduct expert interviews or a large-scale survey among manufacturers of high-
variety product offerings. Secondly, future research could try to investigate the
impact that individual managerial activities mentioned in this paper have on the
solution space quality/ﬁt or on the overall ﬁrm performance.

and Morten Kristiansen
Abstract This paper describes a new ﬂexible and fast approach to laser cutting
called ROBOCUT. Combined with CAD/CAM technology, laser cutting of metal
provides the ﬂexibility to perform one-of-a-kind cutting and hereby realises mass
production of customised products. Today’s laser cutting techniques possess,
despite their wide use in industry, limitations regarding speed and geometry.
Research trends point towards remote laser cutting techniques which can improve
speed and geometrical freedom and hereby the competitiveness of laser cutting
compared to ﬁxed-tool-based cutting technology such as punching. This paper
presents the concepts and preliminary test results of the ROBOCUT laser cutting
technology, a technology which potentially can revolutionise laser cutting.

1 Introduction
Companies are today faced with an increasing demand for fulﬁlment of individual
customer needs, and this results in an increasing number of product variants and/or
customised products. Mass customisation (MC) [1] focuses on how to operate in
and take advantages of such market conditions, including how to deliver and

manage high product variety and customised products. An essential element in MC
is to limit the internal complexity of product variety, e.g. by modularisation and
postponement of the product decoupling point. From a review of MC literature, [3]
appoints the importance of process agility, both in a deﬁnition of MC and in a list
of MC enablers. This has been supported by a later study conducted by [14]. Based
on [1] and substantial MC implementation experiences, [14] appoints robust
process design as one of three essential capabilities for a company to succeed with
MC. In terms of manufacturing, robust process design can be interpreted as a
manufacturing system capable of absorbing ﬂuctuations, varieties and changes in
manufacturing requirements. Hence, manufacturing systems should, regardless of
MC, possess ﬂexibility to handle product variety, customised products and con-
stant product introductions.
In regard to metal cutting, laser cutting is one such ﬂexible process technology
which, in combination with CAD/CAM, is capable of performing one-of-a-kind
metal cutting and hereby realises customised products. A main advantage of laser
cutting over other ﬂexible types of metal cutting, e.g. water or plasma cutting, is its
cleanliness and its ability to create cuts that can accommodate the high demands
for surface ﬁnish that is, e.g. present in the automotive industry. Laser cutting is a
widely used technology and can be found in many industrial applications [4, 16].
Since the ﬁrst oxygen-assisted laser cut was accomplished in 1967 [18], the
CO2 laser has been the most common laser type for cutting applications [23], as it
was able to provide the required power for metal cutting. It is still a widely used
technology, but due to the wavelength of the generated laser beam, it needs to be
guided by means of mirrors from the laser source to the workstation. This reduces
the ﬂexibility of the system and increases the cost of a reconﬁguration of the laser
cell.
Recently, new types of high-power lasers have emerged, such as the single- and
multi-mode ﬁbre lasers and disk lasers [6]. These laser types have much higher
energy efﬁciency while retaining the exceptional beam quality of the CO2 laser
[10, 20]. Another beneﬁt is that these laser types have a shorter wavelength which
entails that they can use optical ﬁbres for beam guidance instead of mirrors. This
gives a great deal of ﬂexibility as the laser power can be ﬁbre-transmitted from a
central laser station to one or more workstations in the production facility.
In standard laser cutting, the molten material is removed by a cutting gas
delivered through a nozzle. This implies a strict process restriction on the distance
between the laser cutting head and the object to be cut. This restriction results in
speed and geometrical limitations of laser cutting and hence a lack of competi-
tiveness compared to ﬁxed-tool-based high-volume processes such as punching.
As stated in [9], the limitation on current cutting speeds in industrial sheet cutting
applications is, however, no longer due to the intensity of the laser, but due to
limitations of the mechanical set-up that is used to move the work piece and the
laser. This has led to a substantial amount of research being conducted within the
ﬁeld of remote laser cutting where the movement of the laser beam is no longer
based entirely on the reposition of the cutting head, but also on the deﬂection of
the beam by means of mirrors, e.g. [7, 17, 25]. In [9], it is, however, pointed out
218
S. Villumsen et al.

that remote laser cutting is still in an early stage of development and is still
suffering from burr formations and thickness limitations. The main challenges with
these remote cutting technologies are related to their ability to eject molten
material from the cutting kerf. The ROBOCUT technology described in this paper
is a new way of conducting remote laser cutting that has the potential to overcome
these disadvantages and increase cutting speeds and reduce burr formations.
1.1 Volvo
The applicability of the ROBOCUT technology and good-quality remote cutting in
the industry is very large, especially with regard to customisation of prefabricated
sheet metal panels. As an example of such an application of remote laser cutting
and the ROBOCUT technique, one could look at the automotive industry. One of
the main advantages that remote laser cutting can accomplish over other cutting
techniques is to introduce customisation of end-user products at a very late stage of
production. This is mainly due to its ﬂexibility and its ability to cut complex
shapes in 3D objects, e.g. a car chassis. In Fig. 1, three different Volvo models are
shown. All of these models can be equipped with various accessories, depending
on package and market for the model. Traditionally, cutting the required holes/
contours for these accessories would require cutting in the body shop before
prepainting. By introducing good-quality remote cutting via, e.g. the ROBOCUT
technology, it is possible to move the cutting of these mounting holes to a very late
stage of production, possibly to the steps of ﬁnal assembly. This implies that the
product decoupling point can be postponed to the stage of ﬁnal car assembly.
In the following section, a small introduction to laser cutting, including remote
laser cutting, will be conducted. In Sect. 3, the ROBOCUT technology will be
described; preliminary results will be discussed in Sect. 4, and Sect. 5 draws up the
conclusion.

2 Introduction to Laser Cutting
The process of cutting materials with a high-power laser beam is known as laser
cutting. It can be used to cut a large range of different materials ranging from, e.g.
thin wooden plates, to high-strength steel. Depending on the type of laser, even
transparent materials like acrylic can be cut. The principle of the process is simple,
and you take a high-power laser source, focus it and move it over the target that
needs to be cut. If the target is made of, e.g. metal, it will melt and evaporate, and
if it is made of, e.g. plastic or wood, it will evaporate and burn. One of the main
difﬁculties with metal cutting is that the molten metal will start to solidify as soon
as the laser beam is turned off or has moved away. If the molten material is not
removed from the cutting kerf, it will solidify where it was and simply close the
gap behind the laser beam, and thus, a proper cut will not be obtained. This entails
that for a good cut, the molten material needs to be removed efﬁciently. In the
following, laser cutting will be divided into two categories, traditional laser cutting
(see [18] ) and remote laser cutting (see [9, 26] ), due to their fundamental
differences in how the molten material is removed and how cutting is achieved.
2.1 Traditional Laser Cutting
In traditional laser cutting, a laser beam is focused on the metal sheet that needs to
be cut (see Fig. 2). The intensity of the laser beam heats up the metal, and it melts,
evaporates and sublimates (phase transition from solid directly to vapour state). To
prevent the molten material from solidifying on the sides of the cutting kerf, a gas
(e.g. nitrogen) jet is applied to blow it away [2, 13, 15]. Some of the cutting gas
escapes through the gap between the nozzle tip and the metal, and the rest enters
Fig. 2 A sketch of traditional laser cutting. A laser beam (red) melts the sheet metal being cut
(grey), and a cutting gas (green) is applied to blow away molten material from the cutting kerf

the cutting kerf and blows away the molten material. Using a cutting gas for melt
ejection ensures that good cutting quality is obtained as the melt ejection can be
controlled by the gas pressure. The main drawback besides the cost of cutting gas
is that the gas nozzle needs to be positioned close to the object to keep a constant
gas pressure to the cutting kerf. Another limitation is that the focusing optics and
gas nozzle and other pieces of equipment are combined in a cutting head. The
cutting head needs to be moved over the entire contour, which practically limits
the cutting speed to the speed of the mechanical system that repositions the cutting
head. Also, if a contour needs to be cut on a complex 3D shape, it might be
geometrically impossible to ﬁnd a path where the cutting head does not collide
with the object. Another inherent trade-off when using a cutting gas is that on the
one hand, the narrower the cutting kerf gets, the faster the gas pressure will drop in
the cutting kerf. This results in less gas ﬂow to blow away molten material and
thus worse quality. On the other hand, when the cutting kerf decreases in width,
the amount of metal that needs to be melted also decreases, which again entails
that faster cutting rates can be achieved with the same laser power. These draw-
backs and trade-offs have entailed that a lot of research is being done in how
remote cutting can be achieved [9, 26].
2.2 Remote Laser Cutting
In remote laser cutting, the cutting head is no longer positioned adjacent to the sheet
metal but at a distance. This remote position entails that the risk of collisions can be
reduced. A remote cutting set-up is shown in Fig. 3 where two rotating mirrors are

piece of sheet metal underneath. Note the remote position of the cutting head (Color ﬁgure online)

used to deﬂect the beam. For simplicity, some components of the cutting head are
not shown in the ﬁgure, e.g. collimating lens and focus adjustment. The main
advantage of remote cutting is that the beam can be repositioned by means of an
optical system, e.g. scanner mirrors, instead of a standard mechanical repositioning
system. These mirror-based systems allow for very fast beam repositions exceeding
[720 m/min [26]. The main drawback is, however, that the molten metal can no
longer be removed by means of a gas nozzle, and currently, there are two processes
by which the molten material can be removed, and these are remote ablation cutting
(RAC) and remote fusion cutting (RFC) [26].
In RAC, a highly focused high-power laser beam moves over the contour that
needs to be cut at a very high speed repeatedly. On each pass, the beam melts and
evaporates only a tiny bit of the surface metal as shown in Fig. 4. The main principle
is that in the cutting kerf, the evaporated material expands and builds up a gas
pressure that ejects the molten material when the gas escapes the cutting kerf. By
repeating this process, more material is removed, and if enough scans are conducted,
the material will ﬁnally be cut. This technique generally allows for fast cutting
speeds in thin plates, but the speed quickly decreases when the thickness increases.
In RFC, the melt ejection mechanisms are not completely understood yet [26]. In
this type of remote cutting, an unfocused laser beam is moved slowly over the sheet
metal. Due to the intense heat and the evaporation of metal on the top of the cutting
kerf and internal pressure phenomena, the molten material is expelled from the
cutting kerf. The main drawback of RFC is the slow cutting speeds and the large
heat-affected zone (HAZ). The HAZ is a zone around the cutting kerf where the
metal has been heated to such a degree that the internal metallic structure changes.
These changes can cause several disadvantages such as changes in hardness and
increased risks of ruptures [19]. Both technologies have, however, difﬁculties when
cutting thicker plates when compared to traditional laser cutting. According to [11,
26], RFC with a 4-KW laser can only cut 3-mm stainless steel, which is not a lot
when compared to standard laser cutting. In [8], a weaker (3 kW) laser can cut
plates more than three times as thick and at much faster speeds when an external
cutting gas is applied. Both technologies rely on some form of gas pressure being
generated directly by the intense laser radiation in the cutting kerf. These mecha-
nisms are exactly what the ROBOCUT approach seeks to enhance and control.

the metal (orange) and creates a vapour pressure (green arrows). The melt is ejected by means of
the vapour and to some extent solidiﬁes as burr on top of the cutting kerf (Color ﬁgure online)
222
S. Villumsen et al.

3 ROBOCUT Laser Cutting
The ROBOCUT approach seeks to improve the melt ejection mechanisms to RAC
and RFC. The idea is that by changing the intensity distribution of the beam, the
melt ejection mechanisms can be controlled [11, 12]. A beam from a single-mode
ﬁbre laser will generally have an intensity distribution with a shape that reas-
sembles a Gaussian function. Such a standard distribution is shown in Fig. 5a. In
Fig. 5b, the concept of the ROBOCUT beam is shown. When this is compared to
4, it is shown that the laser beam has been divided into three beam sections: a melt
beam, a barrier beam and a lid beam. This division implies that only a part of the
beam should be used for melting the metal, and the remaining should be used for
melt guidance in the cutting kerf. In Fig. 6, the principle of a ROBOCUT laser cut
is shown. The melt beam is where the majority of the laser power is placed as it is
used for melting and evaporating the metal. When the cutting head moves, the
molten metal runs (blue arrows) around the melt beam due to the evaporation of
metal on the front side of the cutting kerf. As the head moves further down the

contour, this metal is met by the barrier beam. The barrier beam creates a vapour
pressure that pushes the molten metal from the sides of the cutting kerf towards the
centre to prevent it from solidifying on the sides. Finally, the lid beam creates a
vapour pressure on top of the cutting kerf that pushes the molten material
downwards and out of the cutting kerf. The main advantage of using multiple
beams instead of one is that the ejection gas, which is normally added from a gas
nozzle, is directly generated by the barrier beam and lid beam. By doing this, the
trade-off described in Sect. 2.1 between kerf width and gas pressure can be
avoided. This ensures that a good melt ejection can be created, even in very narrow
cutting kerfs. This should lead to an increase in cutting speed and thickness
capability when compared to RFC and RAC. The quantity and direction of the
generated ejection gas can be customised by changing the design of the beam
pattern. If a proper beam design can be found, remote cutting can be achieved in a
single pass as with RFC but potentially at much higher speeds [10]. Another
possibility with the ROBOCUT approach is that the vapour pressure, generated by
the beam pattern, can be combined with an external gas source to improve the melt
ejection of standard laser cutting. This could lead to an increase in cutting speed
and a reduction in burr formations. On this basis, a preliminary estimation of the
cutting potential has been conducted by [10] where it is assessed that speeds can be
almost doubled compared to standard laser cutting when the internal gas genera-
tion is combined with a standard cutting gas.
3.1 Technology Comparison
As stated in the introduction, the above-mentioned laser technologies (standard
laser cutting, RAC, RFC and ROBOCUT) are all to some extend ﬂexible manu-
facturing processes, as they can be controlled by CAD/CAM software to produce
customised products. If one considers the Volvo case described in Sect. 1.1, one of
the main goals is to implement this customisation process at an as late manufac-
turing step as possible to minimise internal product variety. It has already been
stated that laser cutting and especially good-quality remote laser cutting would be

technologies that could postpone the product decoupling point. For easy reference,
a list of capabilities of the various technologies is given in Table 1.
The table shows that in general, laser processes are relatively clean and can
generally accommodate for fast processing speeds. It is also shown that the remote
laser cutting technologies have the potential to achieve the fastest cutting speeds in
thin sheets due to the mirror deﬂection of the beams. This high speed, combined
with little process mess and the possibility of 3D cutting, is what drives the industry
towards remote cutting. From the table, it is also shown that the ROBOCUT
technology potentially can compete with the speeds of RAC cutting while retaining
the ability to cut thicker sheets. When compared to water jet cutting and plasma
cutting, these beneﬁts do, however, come at a greater cost. For ROBOCUT cutting,
the cost is, however, comparable to other remote laser cutting set-ups. In the fol-
lowing, some preliminary results of the ROBOCUT technology will be presented.
4 Preliminary ROBOCUT Results
As the ROBOCUT beam patterns are still being developed, no conclusive data
have been produced that directly show the effect of the ROBOCUT technology.
Preliminary results have, however, shown that there are differences and that the
cutting quality is generally improved, and these preliminary studies have, how-
ever, also shown that the barrier beam shape is too wide in the current design. This
entails that the ends of the barrier beam will simply heat and melt the sides of the
cutting kerf and not guide the melt towards the centre and prevent it from

solidifying before it leaves the cutting kerf. From Fig. 7b, an actual measurement
of the shape of the laser beam is shown. It is shown that it reassembles the shape
given in Fig. 5b, but with minor deviations around the centre beam.
These variations originate from the lid beam, as it, due to its low power level, is
hard to distinguish from measurement noise. The nonuniform shape is a conse-
quence of unintended interference patterns originating from the multibeam gen-
eration process or from the measurement device itself. From the ﬁgure, it is shown
that the approximate width of the pattern is about 400 lm. In Fig. 8a, b, two
sections of a laser cut are shown. Figure 8a shows a cut with a standard round
beam, and Fig. 8b shows a ROBOCUT cut, with the beam shown in Fig. 7b. From
the ﬁgures, it is shown that the cutting kerf from the ROBOCUT cut is approxi-
mately three times wider than the standard cut. This result indicates that the
intensity of the beam is spread over a too wide area, and thus, a wider cutting kerf
is created, which results in reduced cutting speed for the initial design.

5 Conclusion
Laser cutting is a ﬂexible cutting process which can conduct one-of-a-kind cutting.
Traditional laser cutting techniques possess a number of restrictions, resulting in
speed and geometrical limitations and hereby a lack of competitiveness compared
to ﬁxed-tool-based high-volume cutting processes such as punching. This paper
has presented the general idea behind the ROBOCUT technology and the main
advantages of it and how it distinguishes itself from the traditional types of remote
laser cutting. For easy reference, a list of capabilities of the various technologies is
given in Table 1. From this table, it is clear that ROBOCUT is capable of
expanding the beneﬁts of remote cutting to thicker plates and possibly also at
higher speeds.
The multibeam principle was presented, and it was shown that a tailored beam
has been created. The preliminary results have shown that the new beam shape has
altered the cutting process. They have, however, also revealed that the current
beam design is too wide and that a new beam should be designed to prove the
ROBOCUT melt ejection principle. Further studies of the ROBOCUT technology
will determine the ﬁnal beam patterns and their effectiveness.

Food Customization: An Analysis
of Product Conﬁgurators in the Food
Industry
Monika Kolb, Paul Blazek and Clarissa Streichsbier
Abstract Product customization offerings appear in a growing number of
industries (Conﬁgurator Database, cyLEDGE Media GmbH, www.conﬁgurator-
database.com, 1). When looking at the customization potential of food, customer
preferences in terms of taste tend to diverge a lot. In addition, there are different
needs like nutrition and health which lead to a more heterogeneous diet. These
factors enable a perfect playground for the concept of mass customization.
Eighty-eight existing online food conﬁgurators, which are listed in the Conﬁgu-
rator Database, have been identiﬁed and analyzed. The objective of this paper is to
provide the status quo of the food and beverages industry in the market of mass
customization. The results shall show insights and implications for creating a food
customization project.
Keywords Mass customization  Food customization  Product conﬁgurators
1 Introduction
The increasing awareness of the needs of the customer at the level of individuality,
the low costs of information technology, and the development of technology are
drivers of the trend toward individualization and customization [2]. The term mass
customization derives from the combination of the two apparently contradictory

terms ‘mass production’ and ‘customization.’ The aim of mass customization is to
tailor make products for individual customers at costs comparable to mass pro-
duction [3].
The interaction with the customer through a conﬁgurator is the core business of
mass customization [3]. Interaction processes with customers include both the
incorporation of customer requirements and the speciﬁcation of product properties
by the customer. The design of the product properties is realized by using a Web-
based conﬁgurator [4]. Walcher and Piller [5] identiﬁed parameters that have a
strong inﬂuence on the perceived quality of such a conﬁgurator: visual realism
(i.e., how realistic is the visualization of the conﬁgured product), creativity (i.e.,
the degree of creational freedom during the conﬁguration process), enjoyment (i.e.,
the degree of fun, delight, and entertainment of the conﬁguration process), and
choice options (i.e., the provided choice options in the conﬁguration process).
The Conﬁgurator Database powered by cyLEDGE [1, 6] is a collection of
existing Web-based product conﬁgurators. The database was started in 2007, and
since then, the collected data have changed a lot as the market of individualization
and personalization is very fast moving. Many new conﬁgurators have been
launched, especially in the ﬁeld of food customization. The database currently
contains more than 900 product conﬁgurators which are categorized in 16 different
industries. Within these, the food industry is the third largest, after apparel and
house & garden.
2 Characteristics of Food Customization
Food customization is one of the fastest developing industries in the ﬁeld of mass
customization. Within this industry, the variety of products is wide-ranging, from
customizable tea to popcorn and sausages [6]. Nevertheless, according to Mat-
thews et al. [7], mass customization is still rarely applied by companies in the food
industry. This lack of food conﬁgurators can be traced back to several reasons.
Food products need to be processed and distributed quickly, entail complex han-
dling requirements, and are produced under demanding legal provisions. These are
key factors that limit the ability to customize food products. Nevertheless, there
are some food categories which are suitable for mass customization, especially
those which are non-perishable. Moreover, the packaging or labeling of a food
product is perfectly applicable for individualization.
Yeretzian et al. [2] have identiﬁed two driving forces to customized food. First,
there is a rising awareness among consumers that individuals are different con-
cerning nutritional needs. Consumers are increasingly looking for foods custom-
ized to their speciﬁc nutritional requirements. Accordingly, the demand of
individualized food derives especially from the recognition that inadequate dietary
choices impede our well-being. The second driver of the high demand of cus-
tomized food is the individual ﬂavor preferences, which inﬂuence choices of every
consumer. Food is a commodity that appeases hunger, but more importantly, it is a
230
M. Kolb et al.

source of enjoyment. Flavor serves as a criterion in making food choices. Even the
most nutritious food will not be regularly consumed if its taste does not ﬁt to the
consumer’s preferences.
Insel et al. [8] differentiate hedonic food which people consume because of taste
and smell, enjoyment and lifestyle and functional food, which provides health
beneﬁts. Requirements regarding both hedonic issues and health issues are very
heterogeneous and require concepts which allow the creation of individual nutri-
tion [9]. Mass customization enables creating a unique food or beverage that
exactly matches the individual needs of each consumer. By offering a Web-based
product conﬁgurator, a mass customizer allows its customers to individualize a
product appropriate to their needs.
3 Measures and Evaluations
The aim of the following analysis is to investigate 88 food conﬁgurators (see
appendix) listed in the conﬁgurator database [1, 6]. The brands behind the 88
conﬁgurators are located in 7 different countries. The majority is based in Ger-
many (54 brands) and the United States (28 brands). Every conﬁgurator was
analyzed based on the following predeﬁned criteria [3, 5, 10, 11]:
• Product: Which kind of product is offered for customization
• Level of customization: What can be individualized
• Steps in conﬁguration process: How many steps has the consumer to fulﬁll
• Visualization: How is the product depicted
• Tutorial: Is there a tutorial which explains the usage process of the conﬁgurator
• Support: How is the customer supported during the process
• Social Media: Which social media channels and interaction possibilities are
used.
3.1 Product
The analysis indicates that the currently most offered products in food custom-
ization are ‘chocolate’ and ‘sweets and candy,’ followed by ‘cereals’ and ‘cakes.’
Conﬁgurators of these product categories offer a variety of different ingredients
and exotic ﬂavors which customers usually not get offered as a regular product.
Every user can assemble a unique composition. Besides these popular product
types, there are also rather unusual customizable products like spices, popcorn, or
ketchup (Fig. 1).

3.2 Level of Customization
In the ﬁeld of food customization, there can be made a general distinction between
the customization of the ingredients (functional customization) and the personal-
ization of the food0s packaging (cosmetic customization) [11]. In the ﬁrst case, the
individual liking of each customer is determinative. Taste and preferred ﬂavors
differ strongly, and therefore, customers appreciate the possibility to create their
own assortment. The own design of the packaging on the other hand is often used
for personal presents as it gives every product a unique appearance.
Our investigation reveals that 36 out of 88 food conﬁgurators provide both,
customization of ingredients and packaging. Thirty concentrate on the individu-
alization of ingredients and ﬂavors, and 22 provide the design or personalization of
packaging only (Fig. 2).

3.3 Steps in Conﬁguration Process
A conﬁguration process always consists of various steps a user has to pass through
in order to get his individual product. Every task may be represented in an own
conﬁguration step. However, the user should never be overchallenged by too many
single steps.
The results show that most conﬁguration processes are separated in two or three
steps. Some conﬁgurators even consist of ﬁve or six steps which tend to be more
appropriate for highly complex products such as cars or computers (Fig. 3).
3.4 Visualization
The type of visualization describes the illustration of the conﬁgured product or the
contained ingredients. Reichwald and Piller [11] state that a realistic image of the
product is one of the most vital parts of a conﬁguration tool. The visualization
replaces the physical product. It should on the one hand support the customer in
making decisions and on the other hand stimulate his creativity. In food custom-
ization, the taste is more important than the visual appearance of the product, but
due to the fact that ﬂavor cannot be showed online, an attractive visualization
affects the customers’ buying decision. Moreover, a realistic image of the product
is especially important when it comes to the personalization of packaging or labels.
Four general types of visualization can be distinguished:
• 3D photorealistic
• 2D photorealistic
• 3D illustrated
• 2D illustrated.
The evaluation of the visualization types shows that more than half of all
conﬁgurators use visualizations in 3D photorealistic. The other 3 types are less
used in the food section (Fig. 4).

3.5 Tutorial
Offering different options to the customer leads to a certain degree of complexity.
To compensate this complexity, a conﬁgurator should include a tutorial that
provides an explanation of the process and the conﬁguration steps [3]. Such a
tutorial can be executed in various ways. This analysis differentiates text tutorials,
graphic tutorials, and video tutorials.
The text tutorial is by far the most used form of tutorial. Sixty-nine of all
analyzed conﬁgurators provide their users with this form. Graphic and video
tutorials are offered rarely, and 16 companies do not explain the conﬁguration
process at all (Fig. 5).
3.6 Support
Besides tutorials, there are other ways to support the user in case of questions or
misunderstandings. Providing customers with one or more channels where their
questions are answered helps to understand the conﬁguration process and eliminate

problems [3]. In this study, the usage of live chat, hotline, mail support, and FAQ
is evaluated.
The evaluation indicates that a lot of companies offer at least one of the four
support options. The most used type of support is FAQ. Twenty-eight companies
offer a hotline for customers, and 24 companies give support via mail. The live
chat support is a recent trend that is used for more and more online shops to
guarantee a real-time assistance. Only 4 out of 88 analyzed food conﬁgurators use
this type of support. Ten companies sell customized products without any support
(Fig. 6).
3.7 Social Media
As social media is getting a part of many customers’ and companies’ communi-
cation, it is necessary for mass customizers to deal with these channels for
interacting with the user [10]. Social media provides a wide range of potentials
which mass customizer can use. Facebook & Co can be used to reduce the
uncertainty about the performance of the user’s own design. Via social media,
users can share self-designed products with other users and get feedback. In
addition, users can be inspired by the designs published by others [12].
This paper focuses on the two most popular platforms Twitter (www.twitter.
com) and Facebook (www.facebook.com) as well as the usage of sharing
possibilities.
3.7.1 Facebook
Companies doing food customization are very advanced in using the social net-
work. Seventy-ﬁve of all analyzed companies offering a food conﬁgurator have a
Facebook fan page. The intensity of usage differs strongly, which can be moni-
tored by the number of fans. The company with the most fans on Facebook is
‘Hershey’s’ with about 5.8 million fans, followed by ‘Jones Soda’ and ‘myS-
wissChocolate.’ However, there are also brand fan pages with less than 10 fans,
which indicate that Facebook is not or barely used by them (Fig. 7).

3.7.2 Twitter
Twitter can be an additional marketing or service channel for mass customizers.
Nevertheless, it is not as common as Facebook. Fifty-ﬁve of all analyzed food Web
sites with an integrated conﬁgurator use Twitter for interacting with customers and
prospects. The most followers can be found in the ‘mymuesli’ Twitter account with
about 14.000 followers, followed by ‘element bars’ and ‘Jones Soda’ (Fig. 8)
3.7.3 Sharing Possibilities
The possibility of sharing content from a Web site to different social media
platforms has become very popular. Customers can easily share the Web site,
product, or creation with their social network and thus increase the reach or the
trafﬁc on the company0s Web site. Social sharing mechanism can help users to get
feedback or show their created product to their social network. There is a variety of
sharing possibilities available. The research has investigated the sharing options
Facebook Like, Facebook Share and Facebook Send, Tweet, Google Plus share,
Pin it, and the sharing via mail.
Half of the analyzed companies offer the possibility of sharing their content via
social media. The most popular possibility among food conﬁgurators is the
Facebook Like button with 27 utilizations. Customers can easily state that they like
the company by just clicking one button. Sixteen companies provide a Tweet
button. The other options are not very common until now but may gain importance
in the future (Fig. 9).

4 Conclusion
Food customization is a contemporary way to satisfy the heterogeneous needs of
nowadays consumers. Food customization is feasible for many different kinds of
food and enhances the value of the product. According to the analyzed 88 Web-
based food conﬁgurators, the following implications for creating a food conﬁgu-
rator can be stated:
• As food products are often used and marketed as a present, the option of cus-
tomizing the packaging is recommended.
• The conﬁguration process may be separated in two or three steps which reﬂect
the necessary customization tasks.
• A photorealistic visualization of the single-product components is necessary to
whet the appetite for the food product. Various views of the assembled product
may raise the customer’s imagination and the likelihood of a transaction.
• It is necessary to convey the feeling that there is help offered when conﬁguring
an own product, regardless of whether form of tutorial or support is used.
• The conﬁguration process and the associated social interaction possibilities may
contribute to the customer0s satisfaction with the product and thus strengthen the
customer’s identiﬁcation with the company.
• The possibility of sharing the individual creation of the customer via Facebook
and Twitter represents a great potential to connect users and spread the idea of
customized food.

Generative Design Approach
for Modelling of Large Design Spaces
Bastian Sauthoff and Roland Lachmayer
Abstract Mass customisation of mechanical and mechatronic products requires
computer-aided conﬁguration tools including parametric models of the product.
For an extended individual adaption, approaches including iterative conﬁguration
processes are necessary. Knowledge-based engineering systems (KBES) are
developed for this kind of customisation tasks among other things, but they are still
not universally applicable and accepted in the industry. Thus, in this paper, an
approach for the modelling of large design spaces by parametric models is pre-
sented. This approach implies a conﬁnement of the widely deﬁned pretension of
KBES by a systematic modelling of practical conversant design solutions. In
contrast to the modelling of higher-level design rules, the exclusion of inexpedient
variants is completely possible. The detailed aspects of the approach consisting of
a structural design, effective areas and design elements are illustrated in this paper
as well as methodological aspects. The application is demonstrated by a wheel
carrier design.

1 Introduction
For mass customisation of mechanical and mechatronic products, computer-aided
conﬁguration tools are common used in the industry. Based on a static and a
customer-dependent set of functional and geometrical parameters, the ﬁnal design
of a product is conﬁgured. The precondition for the development of such kind of
conﬁguration tool is an explicit relationship between function and design. While
the approaches of size ranges and assembly design kits, e.g., the methodology of
Pahl et al. [1], are predicated on this aspect, extended conﬁguration demands and
iterative adaption process. This aspect is illustrated in Fig. 1.
Every product is deﬁned by a set of parameters subdivided in geometrical and
physical ones. A fraction of this parameter set is accounted for conﬁguration. The
functional design is generally modelled by interrelationships of parameters. If a set
of explicit constraints is deducible from the interrelationship including all con-
ﬁgurable parameters, a direct conﬁguration is feasible. Whenever an explicit
constraint set cannot be deﬁned, an iterative conﬁguration process has to be
established. In this case, the well-adapted parameter conﬁguration cannot be cal-
culated directly. An evaluation of a speciﬁc parameter set by an analysis model
combined with an iterative parameter variation is the only feasible way. Particu-
larly for the conﬁguration of components dimensioned by physical ﬁeld problems,
an iterative conﬁguration is essential. Thus, an iterative conﬁguration is obviously
much more complex that a direct conﬁguration, but the feasibility of conﬁguration
is more ﬂexible as well.
To support mass customisation based on iterative conﬁguration models,
knowledge-based engineering systems (KBES) have been developed since the
1980s. The exploration of large parts of the design space as well as the auto-
matisation of repetitive design tasks is still the visions of this research ﬁeld. But
the complexity in reference to development and implementation as well as the
integration in company working processes restrains the application today as well
[2, 3].
1.1 Challenges of Extended Conﬁguration
To conﬁne the approaches of KBE in consideration of application for mass cus-
tomisation, the today’s challenges of this ﬁeld are summarised.
1.1.1 Effort of Development
Normally the product design grows up continually during the design process. Thus
a KBE-based conﬁguration systems must include the steps of the underlying
design synthesis. The design steps have to be transformed into rules including
242
B. Sauthoff and R. Lachmayer

functional as well as geometrical aspects on an abstract level. This way of engi-
neering fundamentally differs from the iterative and creative way of engineering
work. Additionally, the development of such a meta-model efforts a lot of engi-
neering resources which can only be applied by big companies. Thus, major
challenges relating to conﬁguration tools in almost the same manner are an
improvement of accessibility by engineers and methodology for applicable
development [2].
1.1.2 Implementation and Interaction with Existing Tools
A lot of scientiﬁc articles can be found about speciﬁc implementations of KBES
characterised by speciﬁc programming languages to build a conﬁguration system.
Until now a lot of CAD tools are quite familiar with parametric modelling and
direct conﬁguration features. But tools for a development of iterative conﬁguration
tools often require deeper understanding of programming. Additionally, the pro-
gramming and connecting interfaces, especially between tools of different com-
panies, are difﬁcult to manage. Thus, implementation of iterative conﬁguration
tools in existing development tools as well as existing work ﬂows without isolated
application is quite a challenge [3, 4].
1.1.3 Integration of Product-Speciﬁc Knowledge and Design Rules
Analysing guidelines for engineering design, there are two different kinds: On the
one hand, general design rules are describing engineering knowledge which is
related to a speciﬁc manufacturing technology of principles of mechanics. These
rules are important for the design work of engineers, but a transformation into
constraint-based rules of a KBES is quite difﬁcult. One reason for this aspect is the
Fig. 1 Direct and iterative conﬁguration
Generative Design Approach for Modelling of Large Design Spaces
243

independent formulation of product-speciﬁc geometrical design. On the other
hand, there are a lot of product- and company-speciﬁc design rules based on
engineering experience, simulation, or testing. These are often closely solution
oriented and not commonly available. Because of this aspect, an integration in a
conﬁguration system is only possible if the design space is very close to the
application range of these rules. Thus, the formulation of design rules on an
applicable but also product-variant-space level is still a challenge [1, 5, 6].
1.1.4 Exclusion of Inexpedient Variants While Modelling a Large
Design Space
Exploring the design space of variants for a deﬁned conﬁguration parameter set the
ratio of theoretical available, but inapplicable design solutions is important for the
conﬁguration effort. Particularly this aspect is weightily if the design space
increases. Thus, a modelling of the complete design space is often inefﬁcient.
A deﬁned restriction of the design space to the sections where feasible solutions
are expected is quite a challenge.
Summarised a conﬁnement of the approaches for KBE with focus to mass
customisation is a necessity to make the grade of these challenges. In particular,
available geometric-related design solutions have to be brought in focus instead of
an overlaying meta-model describing design activities in general.
2 Parametric Modelling Approach
Based on this perception, an approach is developed focusing the exploration of
large design spaces by well-known design concepts.
2.1 Levels of Design Impact
For identiﬁcation of a feasible level of abstraction of a product design, the different
levels of design impact are analysed. In Fig. 2, the levels of design activities
related to the development steps are illustrated. The iterative design process is
often affected by the following developing strategy: Planning activities as well as
ﬁrst conceptional developments are made on general product level. During the
ongoing design process, the activities are further more focused to component
design and eventually to component section details. Thus, the impact of design
switches into detail. But the ﬁnal product design is deﬁned by an iterative
reﬂection of the design increasing the point of view to the product level [7].
244
B. Sauthoff and R. Lachmayer

For mass customisation using KBE-based tool, this aspect clariﬁes the problem of
modelling underlying design activities. Both directions of abstraction have to be
integrated.
2.2 Modelling Approach
Because of mentioned aspects, it is a reasonable way to develop an approach
which is strongly related to the design of a product itself. For this purpose, dif-
ferent methodology approaches of embodiment design are analysed. The design
methodology of Roth [8] is identiﬁed as a very strictly structured approach nearby
the geometric forming of design. Roth subdivides the process of embodiment
design in the steps of structural design and contour design. The inherent structure
of component or component assembly is designed using structural design. Based
on this minimal-function-oriented skeleton, the contour is deﬁned. During both
steps, an iterative process of shape variation is done to identify the best design.
The interaction of components is modelled by effective areas. The basis of all steps
and operations is scalable representation of the product.
Based on this approach, it is recommended to apply this way of geometric
oriented design for the development of computer-aided conﬁguration models.
Because of the issue that a deﬁned component-oriented structure with effective
areas to link the structure elements limits the variation part boundaries, the
approach is expanded to a design-characteristic-oriented structural design. This
implies that effective areas are not solely located at the boundary of parts. Based
on this a product is represented by inherent sections of structural elements coupled
by effective areas. For the variation in the ﬁnal shape, so-called design elements
are deﬁned which are related to a special constellation of structure and effective
areas. Thereby, the topology as well as the contour design of an design element

245

can vary completely while retaining the inherent structure. In Fig. 3, the approach
is illustrated by a mount. The inherent structural design of a mount consists of a
base element with one effective area for linking to a further component and two
internal effective areas for linking to design elements of the side class. The side
class elements are identiﬁed as characteristically equal. They have an external
effective area for circular formed components. For the design elements of the basis
class as well as the side class, different design variants are developed considering
several design rules and manufacturing technologies. Based on the parameters of
the structural design and the effective area design, the elements are assembled to
different design variants.
2.3 Levels of Parametrisation
Going into detail different levels of parametrisation are identiﬁed. On the one
hand, there are a few fundamental parameters on the level of structural design
characterising the whole mount. On the other hand, there are special parameters
characterising the individual design of the effective areas subordinated by the
design element shape. Thus, the parametrisation is classiﬁed by these three levels.
In Fig. 4, the two levels of structural and effective area design are illustrated for
the mount. On the level of structural design, the length and the height are the
fundamental parameters. Additionally, the positions of the effective areas related
Fig. 3 Modelling approach instancing a mount
246
B. Sauthoff and R. Lachmayer

to the skeleton design are parameterised to complete the geometric model. They
are, different from length and height, deﬁned as relative proportion parameters
supporting the variation independence. To control the substitution of effective
areas and design elements, there are additional conceptional parameters on the
level of structural design allocating the variants by integer parameters. Further-
more, a parameter for the manufacturing technology is deﬁned which constrains
unfeasible combinations of design elements assigned to different manufacturing
technologies. Additionally, constraints for the combination of design elements and
Fig. 4 Design of skeleton and effective areas
Generative Design Approach for Modelling of Large Design Spaces
247

effective areas are necessary because the type of an effective area is fundamentally
important for the shape and topology of the design elements. Thus, allocation
tables are introduced to classify the design elements by including effective areas
and the design element classes by effective area design. Thereby, the design space
is restricted to feasible design solutions. The allocation tables are established on
the level of structural design, too.
The effective area designs of the mount, illustrated in Fig. 4, are parameterised
by a shared set of parameters. These parameters are interpreted individually by
every type of effective area. Width (a) and length (b) of the area designs are
identiﬁed as characteristic dimensions completed by a parameter for the inner
proportion (d). While width and length are nearly identical interpreted by every
area the parameter c, deﬁned by a fraction of width or length, has fundamentally
different inﬂuence to the different area designs. Nevertheless, a value variation in
c in the range of 0.1 is accomplishable without the risk to generate unfeasible
design variants. Thus, this generative approach demonstrates a combination of a
large design space and the conﬁnement of feasible solutions. The parametrisation
of design elements is implemented by the same strategy.
3 Modelling Principles for Generative Design Approach
Based on experience in modelling different types of design elements according to
the above approach, general modelling principles are formulated in order to
support its application.
Modelling principle 1 Level of parametrisation: The impact of a parameter
variation should be conﬁned only to one level of structural design, effective area
design or to a type of design elements. The impact should be as local as possible.
Modelling principle 2 Complexity of design elements: For topology variations,
the deﬁnition of additional design elements is advisable, while contour variations
are feasible modelled by one design element as long as the order of the contour
design does not change.
Modelling principle 3 Coupling of parameters: Coupling of parameters in the
space of one level should be avoided. Coupling of parameters over different levels
is preferred.
Modelling principle 4 Parameter properties: For a stable regeneration of the
design model, parameters should be coupled by fractions of other parameters in a
speciﬁed range.
Modelling principle 5 Parameter hierarchy: The level of structural design
should be dominated by a small number of parameters. The number of parameters
of the effective areas as well as the design elements should be decreased to a
suitable level by linking similar parameters. Example: The curving of different
248
B. Sauthoff and R. Lachmayer

edges should be described by one parameter as long as a curving does not fun-
damentally characterise the design element.
Modelling principle 6 Design rules: Design rules should be applied to each
effective area design as well as to each design element individually. The deﬁnition
should be as independent as possible from the value range of parameters.
Modelling principle 7 Choice of CAD elements: The used CAD elements like
lines and arcs to model the design elements should be as simple as possible to
support a robust parametrisation. In particular, higher-order elements like splines
are dependent on several dependent parameters. For example, the modelling of a
curved contour by one line and two arcs instead of a spline limits the design space
but improves the parametrisation.
To demonstrate the application of the approach, the design space of a race car
wheel carrier is exempliﬁed. The impact for application is the scope of individual
adaption of the wheel carrier to its load cases [9].
4 Application Example: Wheel Carrier
A wheel carrier of a race car (Fig. 5) consists of a segment for the wheel bearings
and three application points for the steering tie rod and the suspension arms linking
the wheel to the body. Directing the wheel forces to the application points is the
main function. Thus, the design of the wheel carrier is signiﬁcant for its durability
as well as its weight and manufacturing costs. The structure of the carrier is
analysed, and three inherent types of design elements are identiﬁed: The bearing
element which includes the wheel bearings, three connector elements linking
application points and bearing element and three application point elements
including the connection to the arms and the rod. Although the connector elements
as well as the application point elements differ in their local occurrence, they are
merged in one element class for every element type. The effective areas between
bearing element and connector elements are identiﬁed as cylindrical faces, the
other effective areas are plains with different contour types. The skeleton for the
parametrisation of the structural design mainly consists of effective area posi-
tioning parameters. The distance between the application points and the bearings is
inherent parameters for the wheel carrier, too. In Fig. 5, exemplary a choice of
connector design elements is presented. Although there are different manufactur-
ing variants (casting, welding, and cutting), every instance is modelled by an
identical parameter set. The determining parameters for these elements are the
wall thickness, edge rounding, and properties of the right and left contour.

4.1 Design Adaption by Optimisation Algorithm
The optimal design of the wheel carrier is calculated by an optimisation algorithm
based on an objective function including the mechanical stress distribution, the
manufacturing costs as well as the weight of the carrier. Modelling the design
space of the wheel carrier by the presented modelling approach, all design variants
can be generated by parameter variations. Thus, optimisation by a genetic algo-
rithm is a feasible way although the design model includes topology design
changes. For the implementation of the generative design approach, a computer-
aided design tool which support parametric design in parts and assemblies is
necessary. Additionally, the tool has to provide an application programming
interface to implement the allocation tables controlling the variation process of
effective areas and design elements. Based on these features, an optimisation can
be done manually. For the adaption by a genetic algorithm, the implementation of
an interface to a ﬁnite element environment as well as an external genetic algo-
rithm is implemented [10]. This requires deﬁnitely some effort but is a more
feasible option than developing an standalone knowledge-based engineering
system.

5 Conclusions
The presented generative design approach supports direct as well as iterative
conﬁguration as a tool of mass customisation. The design space is conﬁned by
systematic analysis of structure and shape. On the one hand, feasible solutions are
favoured, and on the other hand, this way of modelling limits the number of
solutions in general. No higher-order design rules are formulated whereby the
complicity is reduced. The integration of all design rules in the design elements
does not require such a formulation. Relating to mass customisation, this approach
supports the computational modelling of individual product variants focusing
embodiment design. In comparison with common KBE applications, creativity and
the iterative design exploration characterising the way of engineering work are not
decreased. But for an implementation of an optimisation process, programming
effort is still required. Outlining further challenges, an extension to assembly
design introducing part overall effective areas is necessary. Further there is the
question of the number of design elements necessary to model a product optimally.

How to Squeeze a Conﬁgurator
into a Handheld Device
Homero M. Schneider, Marcos F. Espindola and Yuzo Iano
Abstract In this paper, it is presented the implementation of a solar-powered
pumping system conﬁgurator based on a new approach for the modelling of the
conﬁguration process of product families. An important outcome of this approach
is that if a few modelling conditions are satisﬁed, deriving product family mem-
bers becomes a direct (backtrack-free) process. Consequently, a conﬁguration
problem-solving process that typically would require a high-performance com-
puter can be squeezed into handheld devices as a standalone program.

1 Introduction
Solar-powered pumping systems (SPPS) have long become a viable economic
option for rural areas and the widespread of this technological solution will have a
great socioeconomic impact in many countries. Nevertheless, this is still a largely
unexplored market segment which will require the increasing involvement of the
private sector [1]. For a company interested in this market, sending trained tech-
nicians to distant sites in the countryside to visit potential customers is a costly

approach, not to mention the shortage of trained technicians in SPPS. A better
approach is to provide an established sales force with an SPPS conﬁgurator that
can be run as standalone programs on devices such as smartphones and tablets.
This strategy is justiﬁed by the fact that the sales force would require little training
and make use of devices that are becoming very popular as tools to conﬁgure the
SPPS. Moreover, these tools can be used in places where there is no Internet
connection (typical of rural areas in developing countries), which renders a cen-
tralized conﬁguration server useless. However, it is well known that product
conﬁguration tends to be a time-consuming process that requires high-performance
computers. Hence, one might wonder, how is that a handheld device can be used
for this role?
In this paper, we apply a new approach to model the conﬁguration of product
families to the SPPS problem. This approach is based on a knowledge framework
which combines a generic product structure (GPS) and a constraint network
extended with design function (CN-F) model to represent product families. One
important outcome of this approach is that, if a few modelling conditions are
satisﬁed by the CN-F model, deriving product family members becomes a direct
(backtrack-free) process. To show the applicability of our approach to the SPPS
problem, we implemented a conﬁgurator which is capable of quite challenging
solutions. The conﬁgurator was also tested on an emulator for mobile devices to
demonstrate the viability of running it as a standalone program on a handheld
device.
In what follows we will ﬁrst make a brief review of related works. Then, we
will apply our modelling approach to represent an SPPS product family and deﬁne
the method for deriving its members. After that, we will present our implemen-
tation of the SPPS conﬁgurator. Finally, we make some concluding remarks.
2 Related Works
Constraint network (CN) has been a successful approach to deal with conﬁguration
problems [2]. However, since its proposal [3], various extensions to the classical
CN model have been introduced to cope with the speciﬁcities of product conﬁg-
uration problems [4]. Typically, backtrack algorithms are used to ﬁnd solutions for
conﬁguration problems, which tends to be a time-consuming process. To over-
come the inefﬁciency of the search method, knowledge from the conﬁguration
domain has to be used to guide the search process [5]. On the other hand, it has
been shown that under some conditions, depending on the topology of the CN
model and its degree of consistency, ﬁnding solutions can be a backtrack-free
process [6]. Other backtrack-free approaches rely in a pre-processing stage to map
all the solutions in the design space prior to the conﬁguration stage, when the
actual problem-solving occurs [7]. Although the search for solutions is faster, these
approaches cannot avoid the exponential grows of memory utilization in the pre-
processing stage.

From the engineering perspective, graph grammar has been used as an approach
for deriving members of product families [8]. A review on product families and
methods for their design can be found in [9, 10], respectively.
3 The Solar-Powered Pumping Product Family
A typical SPPS is composed of a few components. At the core of the system, there
is a photovoltaic (PV) array that provides power to a water pump. To improve the
pump performance, a pump controller is used to condition the power and to control
the pump. A ﬂoat switch (ST) is used to turn the pump off when the water tank is
full, and another switch (SW) is used to turn the pump off when the water level at
the well is low, thus avoiding that it runs dry. The components of an SPPS are
connected by wires to transmit power and control signals. The water is carried
from the well to the tank through a piping system. A battery bank may be added to
the system in case it is necessary to pump water at night or during heavily clouded
days. The charging of the battery bank is carried out by a charge controller.
However, selecting and conﬁguring these components to meet the application
requirements and to optimize the system performance is far from trivial and may
involve a large solution space.
Our approach assumes that the product family has already been developed.
However, the framework with the GPS and CN-F models will capture all the
relevant knowledge about the product family to deﬁne precisely its solution space
and to set up the process to derive its members.
3.1 The Generic Product Structure
The GPS is a modular architecture composed of component types, which stands for
classes of components. In our approach, component types belong to four possible
categories: common/generic, optional/generic, common/speciﬁc and optional/
speciﬁc. We say that a GPS represents the architecture of a given product family if
and only if the architecture of each member of that family is isomorphic to a
substructure of the GPS.
Figure 1 shows the GPS for our SPPS product family. The PV array, pump,
controller, sensors, wiring and piping are considered to be common component
types, i.e. they are present in every member of the SPPS product family. Other-
wise, the battery bank and charge controller are optional component types. The
well and tank sensors will be taken as speciﬁc component types, i.e. they do not
vary among applications. Otherwise, all the other components are of the generic
type, i.e. they will vary among applications and have two or more variants. It
should be noted that, according to our classiﬁcation, to be a common component
type in the product family architecture does not imply that it is ﬁxed. Actually, in
How to Squeeze a Conﬁgurator into a Handheld Device
255

our example, most of the product family variability happens on the common part
of the GPS.
The GPS is a useful means to delimit the design space of a product family
because it constrains the possible arrangement of the components. However, it is
not enough to determine completely what the valid conﬁgurations are and, in
particular, what speciﬁc conﬁguration will meet the requirements of a given
application. Therefore, in our approach, the GPS is combined with a constraint
network model to restrict the design space further.
3.2 The Constraint Network Extend with Design Functions
The CN-F model used in our approach can be regarded as an extension of the
traditional CN model. It is deﬁned by the tuple
V; C; F
h
i, where V is a set of
variables, C is a set of constraints, and F is a set of design functions (abbreviated
as d-function), such that every variable in V has at least one d-function attached to
it that generates its values. In this section, we will see how these elements apply to
the SPPS product family and how they complement the GPS.
Variables. Optional components in a product family are one main source of
variability. However, most of the diversity in a product family may be due to the
variability of the generic components. For example, a pump manufacture may
provide a large number of pumps options, each one designed to operate optimally
within a narrow window of total dynamic head and ﬂow rate. Pumps may also be
based on different pumping principles to maximize either head or ﬂow rate. Vari-
ations among the product family members can be identiﬁed by variables and
localized on the components of the GPS, but the scope of a variable can vary

widely. It may be related to one speciﬁc feature or to the component as a whole. The
set of all the values that can be assigned to a variable is its domain of variation. For
instance, the domain of the variable Pump model is deﬁned by the set {HR-03,
HR-03H, HR-04, HR-04H, HR-07, HR-14, HR-20, C-SJ5-8, C-SJ8-7}.
Since the variability of the product family is related to the generic or optional
component types, only such components are associated with variables, and
because these are the variables that specify the product family members, they are
referred to as output variables. A special type of output variable is the inclusion
variable associated with optional component types (e.g., Battery inclusion). These
are binary variables that deﬁnes if the component is included or not in the derived
product. However, variations will also be related to the application environment.
For example, applications will vary in the amount of daily water needed, the water
yield of the well, the capacity of the tank, if pumping is necessary when the sun is
not shining, etc. These variables express the customer requirements and are
referred to as input variables. Figure 1 shows the list of all the input and output
variables for the SPPS example. However, input and output variables are not
necessarily disjoint subsets of V, and besides these two classes, the set V may
contain a subset of auxiliary variables (shown in Fig. 6), which are neither input
nor output variables. For example, the variable Total dynamic head is deﬁned in
terms of input variables, and although it is an essential variable for the choice of
the pump system, it is not used to specify directly any of the components in the
GPS. Therefore, it is classiﬁed as an auxiliary variable.
Constraints. Constraints deﬁne how subsets of variables in V are related to each
other, thus restricting the possible combinations of values that can be assigned to
them simultaneously. For example, the following constraints describe how the
auxiliary variable Total dynamic head is related to some other variables in V:
C7
Total dynamic head is equal to the sum of the Water level, Water drawdown,
Tank elevation and the friction loss of the piping system
C8
Total dynamic head must be less or equal than the head of the pump system,
deﬁned by the combination of the Pump model and Controller model
To satisfy a constraint, the values assigned to the variables in the expression
deﬁning it must render the expression true. If an optional component will not be
included, all constraints involving non-inclusion variables on that component can
be disregarded. An assignment of values to all the variables in V such that no
constraint in C is violated is said to be a solution to the CN-F model. The set of all
solutions will be denoted by S. As we will argue below, solutions in S correspond
to members of the product family.
Design Functions. D-functions have been introduced as an extension to the CN
model to capture the necessary knowledge to generate the values for the variables
in V. For example, Fig. 2 shows the speciﬁcation of d-function F4, which gener-
ates the values for Total dynamic head (the dependent variable) as a function of
Water drawdown, Water level and Tank elevation (the independent variables).

257

Actually, an important consequence of d-functions is the dependency relation that
they establish between variables. Now, if the value generated by a d-function is to
be consistent with the values of the variables it depends on, it must incorporate all
the constraints involving these variables. We say that a d-function incorporates a
constraint if and only if every combination of the values of the independent
variables (for which the d-function is deﬁned) and the value generated from them,
satisfy the constraint. For example, from lines 1, 2 and 3, it can be veriﬁed that
constraint C7 is incorporated by F4. However, in general, a d-function is not
dependent on all the variables related to the variable it is attached. For example,
although the variables deﬁning the pump system are related to Total dynamic head
by C8, F4 is not dependent on them. Note that, the condition introduced in line 4 is
only used as part of the conﬁguration control mechanism.
Input variables are attached with special d-functions that request the user to
assign a value chosen from a delimited range of values, which may be generated
dynamically. Hence, except possibly for the input variables, all variables in V will
necessarily depend on some other variable due to the d-function attached to them,
forming a network of dependencies on V.
If a set of variables is strongly coupled, they can be grouped together to form
compound variable and the same d-function will generate the values for all them.
This is the case for F12, which selects the pump system from a performance table
which, for a given total dynamic head, correlates the output ﬂux and the input
power for optimal performance of the pump systems. Inclosing strongly coupled
variables into the same d-function also prevents dependency loops between
variables.
It is this capability of d-functions to establish acyclic network of dependencies
over V, together with their capability to generate values that are locally consistent,
that forms the basis for the backtrack-free conﬁguration process in our approach.
Moreover, since only values generated by the d-functions are taken into account
in the conﬁguration process, the domain of a variable in the CN-F model is deﬁned
as the set of all values that can be generated by the d-functions attached to it. An
important consequence of this deﬁnition is that the domains need not to be deﬁned

explicitly and can be either discrete or continuous. All these properties have been
used in our SPPS example.
4 Deriving Product Family Members
Based on our knowledge framework for representing product families, the con-
ﬁguration process will be divided into two stages. First, a solution to the CN-F
model is found from the values of the input variables. Second, this solution is used
to transform the GPS into a speciﬁc model representing the desired product family
member.
As mentioned in Sect. 2, approaches base on the CN model typically use a
backtracking method to ﬁnd solutions. Moreover, in general, those approaches will
not guarantee that a solution can be found or if this will happen in a reasonable
time. However, if the CN-F model satisﬁes the following modelling conditions: (1)
There are no dependency loops between the variables, (2) each variable has only
one d-function attached to it, (3) the d-functions are deﬁned for every combination
of values of variables they depend on, and (4) every constraint is incorporated by
some d-function; then, it can be demonstrated that the control algorithm shown in
Fig. 3 is enough to ﬁnd a solution for every consistent input to the CN-F model.
This result is still valid if we make condition 2 less restrictive by allowing more
than one d-function to be attached to the same variable. However, to handle this
general condition, it would be necessary to introduce the concept of instantiation
patterns (something we will not do in this paper). Anyway, for the SPPS example,
the more restrictive condition is sufﬁcient.
As it can be veriﬁed, the control algorithm is a straightforward one and does not
admit backtracking. D-functions in F may be organized in any order. A d-function
is enabled when all the variables it depends on are assigned values. The algorithm
will iterate at most as many times as the number of elements in F. The demon-
stration that the CN-F model of the SPPS product family satisﬁes each of the above
modelling conditions and that the control algorithm always leads to a solution will

not be given here for space reasons. However, some evidence is given in the next
section.
The second stage of the conﬁguration process consists in transforming the GPS
into a speciﬁc product model based on the solution found in the ﬁrst stage. To
achieve this, initially we remove from the GPS the optional components that are
not needed. This happens whenever the value of the inclusion variable associated
with the optional component has a speciﬁc value, for instance, zero. Otherwise, the
component is kept on the structure. After this cleaning process, the remaining
generic components are substituted by speciﬁc ones, as deﬁned by the values of the
output variables on them assigned by the solution. The resulting model can be used
for the assembly of the correspondent product family member. Moreover, this
product will meet the application requirements that started the conﬁguration
process. Since both stages use direct methods, we can conclude that deriving
members of the product family is a direct (backtrack-free) process.
If the product family has been properly modelled, then every solution in
S corresponds to a product family member and, on the other hand, every member
of the product family must correspond to a solution to the CN-F model. In this
case, we can conclude that the set S of solutions to the CN-F model precisely
deﬁned the solution space of the product family, and every consistent set of
requirements expressed by the input variables leads to a product family member.
5 Implementation of the SPPS Conﬁgurator
The SPPS conﬁgurator was conceived as a tool to support the sales force, requiring
them to have only enough technical knowledge about SPPS to make some
assessments at the customer site. Customer requirements may be entered all at
once or requested interactively by the conﬁgurator. To avoid inconsistent inputs,
the conﬁgurator performs some checks on the requirements and suggests appro-
priate actions to remove them. The output of the conﬁgurator is the instantiation of
the product family GPS by specifying the components, theirs settings and
arrangement.
The method for the modelling of the conﬁguration process can be generalized
into the following steps: (1) deﬁnition of the product family GPS; (2) identiﬁcation
of the variables; (3) deﬁnition of their constraints; and (4) speciﬁcation of the
d-functions. These steps have been followed in Sect. 3 for the development of the
SPPS product family; thus, we will not discuss them further. However, it should be
stressed that adjustments to the CN-F model may be necessary in view of the four
conditions stated in Sect. 4. Notably, the options at the input variables must be
restricted appropriately to prevent downstream functions to become undeﬁned.
The abort condition introduced in F4 is an extreme action that prevents the cus-
tomer requirements to be outside the domain of deﬁnition of the d-function that
selects the pump system. Actually, if that happens, it does not make sense to
continue with the conﬁguration process.
260
H. M. Schneider et al.

Figure 4 shows the implementation of the d-function F4 (speciﬁed in Fig. 2) in
the programing language LabVIEW. This is a relatively simple d-function. The
most complex are the ones that deﬁne the arrangement of the battery bank and the
PV array. The latter one, for example, calculates all possible arrangements for each
PV module model available within certain limits of voltage and current and
chooses the one that optimizes the power in reference to a target power. As a
secondary optimization criterion, this d-function also maximizes the open-circuit
voltage of the array.
Technical information about the available components is arranged as tables and
implemented as .txt ﬁles. They are directly used by the d-functions. For instance,
in F4 the ﬁle ‘‘Pumps.txt’’ is used to check for the availability of a pump system
that can overcome the total dynamic head of the application. Note that, by the
addition of new pumps to this table, the total dynamic head limit of the conﬁ-
gurator can be increased.
Figure 5 shows the general algorithm for the SPPS conﬁgurator. At the centre,
it can be seen the d-functions (numbered F1–F17), each one representing a subVI
(a kind of routine in LabVIEW), with the variables to which they are attached at
the right of the diagram. The variables to which the d-functions depend on are
indicated by the connection lines from below. The arrangement of the d-functions
in the diagram clearly reveals the dependency between variables. As it can be
veriﬁed, there is no dependency loop between the variables. At the left of the
diagram, it can be seen the control structure which operates in conjunction with the
loop structure (the outer structure encompassing the whole program). Initially,
only the ﬁrst four d-functions will be executed. If the abort condition in the
d-function F4 is true, there is no solution for the conﬁguration problem and the
program ends. Otherwise, the abort variable is set to false and the other d-functions
are executed. As the d-functions are executed, they generate the values for the
correspondent variables and are set to inactive. D-functions attached to variables
(other than the inclusion variables) on components that will not be included are set
to inactive without generating values. When all the functions are inactive (which is
equivalent to F = [ in the control algorithm in Fig. 3), a solution has been found
and the program ends. This happens in exactly three iterations of the conﬁgurator
program.
Figure 6 shows the solution of the CN-F model found by the conﬁgurator after a
test case for the values of the input variables. The values of the output variables

specify the member of the SPPS product family that meets those requirements. For
an illustrative purpose, the auxiliary variables and their values are also displayed.
The program described above was ported to Windows Mobile 6 professional,
ARM920T Device Emulator. Tests with the emulator showed that after all the
customer requirements have been input, the time to obtain solutions was in the
order of milliseconds.
6 Conclusions
In this paper, we have shown that the conﬁguration process of the SPPS product
family can be arranged into a direct method by the concatenation of the d-functions
into a dataﬂow process. Because LabVIEW is a programing language based on the
principle of dataﬂow, it proved to be an interesting choice to put that property in
evidence.
The short response times of the SPPS conﬁgurator running as standalone pro-
gram on an emulator for mobile devices demonstrate its viability as a tool for
popular devices such as smartphones and tablets, without Internet connection. This
also implies that there is room for the design of a much more sophisticated con-
ﬁgurator without compromising its responsiveness on the mobile device.
Besides the performance, another conspicuous advantage of our approach is the
level of modularity that can be obtained. The resulting software program is such
that any d-function can be improved without affecting the other functions or the
control structure. The same is true for the introduction of new d-functions. For
example, we could have included a d-function that automatically deﬁnes the
insolation level from the location of the well. Moreover, because the available
components are given as .txt ﬁles, new components can be included independently
from the d-functions. All these features will facilitate greatly the maintainability of
our conﬁgurator.
Finally, it is important to note that, besides the correct conﬁguration of the
SPPS, conﬁgurators may have a major role in the automation of the total sales
cycle, thus giving a further competitive advantage to the company [11]. This was
outside the scope of this work. However, tasks such as the preparation of the
quotations and bill of materials could have been included as additional d-functions.

Implementation of BIM in the Danish
Building Sector
Lene Faber Ussing and Jesper Kranker Larsen
Abstract The Danish building sector has now for some years worked for
implementation of BIM in the whole building process. In practice, it seems with
the long way from the wish of using BIM in the whole building process to what
really happens on the projects and building sites. To get an idea of how long the
BIM implementation has come in the sector, a contractor company at present
involved in one of the biggest public construction projects in Denmark was con-
tacted to survey some employees at the project, because such a project ought to be
one where BIM is best implemented. This survey shows the building sector is
implementing BIM, but there are still big challenges to solve both internally in the
company and externally both in the immediate environment and distant
environment.

The building sector is frequently described as conservative and tradition bound,
which according to critics results in little innovation, a not very efﬁcient and
effective cooperation and bad economy compared with other industries. The wish
in a lot of building projects is customization. A method to be more efﬁcient and

effective is to use mass customization in house building in a way where the
building owner seems it as customization [14]. The Danish building sector has for
one thing used BIM to make mass customization.
The sector has now for some years worked with the implementation of BIM in
the whole building process. The engineers and architects work for going from 2D
drafts to 3D modeling in expectation of being more efﬁcient and making less faults
and imperfections in the completed building [2]. In 2007, the Danish government
worked out an executive order treats information and communication technology
(ICT) in public construction projects which meant that all involved parties in a
public construction project suddenly needed a sort of 3D modeling to fulﬁll the
executive order about ICT in public construction projects.
When BIM is discussed with engineers, architects, contractors, and suppliers,
there is still a long way from what the Danish government wants in the future with
ICT and BIM and what really happens on the Danish building projects and sites.
The engineers and architects are going from 2D to 3D drawing [4], but a lot of
them do not use the part of the programs where you can put in the time and the
costs. The explanation is that they are not being responsible for time and costs; the
contractors and suppliers have to calculate these themselves. The contractors and
suppliers do not have the software to use 3D [15] and BIM because it is too
expensive. So it is the Gordian knot if the engineers and architects will not use the
whole software and the contractors and the suppliers will not buy it because they
see no advantage [3].
Therefore, the project aim is to have a look at one of the big public construction
projects which actually demands use of ICT in the whole process of the project.
2 Research Methodology
The purpose of this paper is to seek partly answers to the research question: How
does a contractor in Denmark implement BIM in his organization and does all in
the company he knows about and uses BIM? To answer the question, the biggest
contractors in Denmark have been examined. They all make public buildings, and
therefore, they have to follow the rules in the executive order about ICT in public
construction projects. They have all made some initiative and development pro-
jects to diffuse BIM in the respective companies. Three master students at Aalborg
University recorded in their company internship program at three of the biggest
contractors in Denmark that the companies may have implemented BIM, but the
employees did only in a limited degree know about the initiatives and development
projects diffusing BIM. Therefore, the three students decided to write their Master
thesis about a survey of some employees at the contractor company at present
involved in one of the biggest public construction projects in Denmark, because
such a project ought to be one where BIM is best implemented.

2.1 The Survey
The survey was made as qualitative interviews. All interviews were made as semi-
constructed interviews where all questions were designed with open main ques-
tions and if necessary supported with open subquestions to secure an open and
pleasant talk for the interviewees [5, 13, 17]. To ensure all communication such as
voice and body language, etc. of the interviewee, the interviews were made face to
face where the advantages are a communication where interviewee will answer
spontaneously and with a reduced chance of reﬂection at the questions [12]. On the
other side, that gives the interviewer a challenge and opportunity to create a good
atmosphere during the interview session [16]. To avoid interviewee feeling
‘‘observed’’ and ‘‘used’’ by researcher, [9] interviewer and interviewees were
communicating a few times to create trust and conﬁdence [11].
The interviewed persons were a BIM manager from the strategic level in the
organization who was not directly involved in the big public construction project, a
BIM coordinator from the tactical level in the organization who was the con-
nection between the general organization and the single project, a project manager,
and a concrete foreman both from the operational level in the organization and
both placed on the same big public construction project.
The interview study is compounded by questions about formalities like what is
your job? How do you deﬁne BIM? And how and when do you use BIM? and
about the planning of implementation of BIM like how have the employees been
trained and prepared for the implementation? What do you feel about the process
of change and how do you deal with it? Where and who pays for the imple-
mentation of BIM? and the practical implementation like how has the BIM
strategy been accepted in the organization and on the pilot projects? What has been
the biggest challenge? And what has been the greatest success?
3 Findings and Discussion
3.1 Formalities
The ﬁrst question was to clarify whether it was the right persons to be interviewed
what is your job? As mention before, four people were interviewed (Fig. 1);
• The BIM manager who is responsible for development, implementation, and
performance of BIM in the company.
• One of the BIM coordinators, who is employed in the quality division, but the
salary is paid by the BIM division so the coordinator refers to two divisions. The
coordinator is afﬁliated to the big public construction project and some other
projects which needed help for support of BIM and the coordinator also teach in
the use of BIM.
Implementation of BIM in the Danish Building Sector
267

• The project manager of the big public construction project, who has the daily
leadership of the project such as procurement and contracting of subcontractors,
management of time schedule, management of own production, and dialog with
the building owner.
• The concrete foreman of the big public construction project, who is responsible
for 40 men—15 engaged with prefabricated concrete construction and the rest
engaged with in situ concrete. The primary work is scrutiny and project clari-
ﬁcation.
Those four people were picked out so that they together represent each level of
the company, and therefore, they can describe the opportunity of their level in the
company to implement BIM in the organization.
The next question was how do you deﬁne BIM? The question reveals whether
an agreement is reached in all level in the organization of what BIM is. The upper
level (manager and coordinator) deﬁnes BIM as many things going from 2D over
3D sketches linked together with time and economy to a process where in the
future you end with a sort of digitized building work, whereas the lower levels
deﬁne BIM only as 3D modeling. The company has not deﬁned an unambiguous
deﬁnition of BIM because they do not want the employee to be limited by a
deﬁnition. This can have two solutions. One is that the lower level does not see the
whole plan and another where some good ideas pop up which the board of
directors did not see. The last one is wishes which have not happened yet.
Another question is how and when do you use BIM? The upper level tries to
help the rest of the organization to use BIM to as great an extent as possible. The
boards of directors want to implement BIM as soon as possible, but it has to be a
voluntary choice, so the results are that the lower level use BIM mainly for
visualization, navigation, and scrutiny. The project manager also sometimes uses
BIM to verify an amount from a tender.

3.2 Planning of Implementation
The ﬁrst question was how have the employees been trained and prepared for the
implementation of BIM? To answer to the question is in agreement at all level.
The overall BIM strategy was presented on a BIM conference in autumn 2012.
After the conference, the employees were informed on divisions meetings and
there was ongoing information by mails with newsletters. The newsletters were to
the interviewed project manager and the concrete foreman without value. So there
has been a quite good planning of the implementation. But the lower level still felt
that they did not know why the board of directors wants to implement BIM in the
company, the purpose of BIM for the company, and what the strategy about BIM
actually was. But as mentioned before, the board of directors has been conscious of
their decision. Hopefully, it gives more useful inputs than frustrations in the long
run.
Another question was what do you feel about the process of change and how do
you deal with it? The upper level ﬁnds that the process has been good. The BIM
manager and the BIM coordinator have both been deeply involved in the process
because they had to implement BIM in practice in the company. The lower levels
represented by the project manager and the concrete foreman ﬁnd that some of the
process had been good—the conference and the course programme, but when it
was decided to go for conferences and courses, there had been a dilemma with the
top level saying the employees had to go to the courses and all the project manager
saying the employees had not to go until the work on the site is ﬁnished.
The last question was where and who pays for the implementation of BIM? The
project does not pay for BIM. It is the BIM division which pays for hardware and
software, and the employees division pays for own employees’ training and
courses. Not all have yet been trained and have not attended courses. In 2012, 600
employees started a course programme. It is the project which decided how many
and who has to join the course programme, but it is the BIM division which
decided which projects are relevant for using BIM. In that way, it is usually
motivated and interested employees who join the course programme without direct
cost for the project.
3.3 Practical Implementation
When it comes to the implementation in practice a question was how has the BIM
strategy been accepted in the organization and on the pilot projects? The
employees have gone from opposition to BIM because they did not know what
BIM was to no opposition to BIM because some of the employees now know what
BIM was; they have got some BIM competences, and they see BIM as an
instrument for doing their job better, easier, and cheaper. The lower levels see the
same, but when there is a time conﬂict between doing something on the project and
Implementation of BIM in the Danish Building Sector
269

being better at BIM, the project will still win because you still have a contract
which requires delivery at time, have the right price, and the building owner has to
be satisﬁed [1]. In practice, this causes the implementation to take longer time, but
hopefully it is worthwhile the effort [8]. Generally, the head organization is
positive prepared for BIM, but on the projects, there is still a long way; most of the
employees are positive as long as it does not conﬂict with the project.
Another question was what has been the biggest challenge? That question can
be split up into two parts: internal challenges and external challenges.
Internal challenges For the BIM manager, there has been no big challenge
internally in the company.
The BIM coordinator still has and had a lot of challenges; lack of experience, in
practice the hardware and software are not good enough at the site, the BIM focus
can be too high instead of just using BIM as an integrated part of the project, the
coordinator has to argue for the use of BIM, and the individual employee’s
competences about BIM are only known by his or her chef and are not written
down. This means that the knowledge will disappear with a chef who leaves the
company, and furthermore, it is not easy to plan further education in BIM if you do
not know who has which qualiﬁcations.
The project manager and the concrete foreman have nearly the same internal
challenges; some of the chefs are barriers because they are negative toward BIM,
and the chef can decide that an employee does not have to follow a BIM course. At
the same time, there is a depression in the Danish building sector, which means
that some of the employees are under pressure and therefore act according to the
best here and now solution instead of using BIM and to get a long-lasting good
solution. A challenge also exists between the different divisions, between different
tradesperson, and young and old employees. The gap is going from very positive
and persons who want to learn new things because it is exciting, to persons who
are negative, afraid of new things and only wants to do as usual because they then
think they are safe. The last challenge is that some building owners insist on using
special software for BIM. A good deal of software for BIM exists and if the
software is different from project to project have to start from scratch every time.
It seems that the upper level, represented by the BIM manager, does not see any
internal problems. But the longer we move down in the levels, the bigger are the
problems or challenges. A general issue for the company can therefore be to solve
the problems the manager and the board of directors do not see.
External challenges For the BIM manager, the biggest challenges were
external. The most important of them all is to work with BIM in a country like
Denmark and in the building sector. In Denmark, all the norms are made nationally
though many good examples on classiﬁcation and ICT treatment can be found
from other countries [5]. The Netherlands has chosen to use American standards.
The standards have been reworded and rephrase both in Dutch and English. Some
in Denmark are working on making Danish standards, and the Danish educational
system is educating candidates who only learn Danish norms which means the
companies have to go abroad if they want to obtain international experience and
competencies.

For the BIM coordinator, the external challenges have been legal barrier and
problems with collaboration abroad due to lack of expected competencies [4] and
therefore resulting in incomplete project material, discussions, and delays [6]. The
external advisers have been difﬁcult to contact, they do not want to exchange
expectations, and they and the subcontractors do not always work at the same BIM
level as agreed.
The project manager and the concrete foreman have had some of the same
external challenges as the BIM coordinator. The external advisers have not
incorporated the contractors and the workmanship in their project and models. The
advisers only incorporate things which are of value for themselves. The use of
different software does not always work, and sometimes drawings did not match
because they come from different software. Another problem is that the advisers
who make the drawings do not supervise on the site too, and the contractor is not
allowed to contact the advisor who made the drawings directly. This again results
in a lot of discussions and delays. The legal contract on the project is based on 2D
drawings, but the building owner demands BIM material in the ﬁnal product. The
last challenge is the suppliers. Most of them are quite conservative, and they still
only use 2D drawings.
Again, it seems that the upper level represented by the BIM manager does not
see the same external problems as others. It is a general issue for the company to
solve when the manager and the board of directors do not discover it.
The biggest success The last question was what has been the biggest success?
For the BIM manager, the biggest success was going to a branch meeting where all
department heads discussed BIM in the production. This indicates that some
activities have an effect and succeed after all.
For the BIM coordinator, the biggest success was that the 3D models were so
visual that communication was much easier, and for the ﬁrst time, it was easy to
read the exact amount directly from the drawings.
For the project manager and the concrete foreman, the biggest success was the
visualization. The planning and contracting had been easier because of localization
and the opportunity to see exact amounts in the systems. Potential problems were
detected earlier with the advantage of a better quality of the project. It is a big
advantage to have a BIM expert on the site, which gives the opportunity to ask
when problems arise instead of waiting for half a day.
4 Conclusion and Further Research
This case maybe describes one of the projects in Denmark with major use of BIM.
But the interviews show that there still is a long way to go before a project can be
found where BIM is used in an optimal way. The question is whether the company
implements BIM in the right way. Planning of the implementation seems to be all
right but with some minor errors which have to be adjusted in the future.
Implementation of BIM in the Danish Building Sector
271

The practical implementation on the other hand was with major errors. The
BIM manager did not see any internal challenges despite the fact that the BIM
coordinator, the project manager, and the concrete foreman saw a lot of challenges.
Some of the internal challenges can be solved easily; for instance, employees who
are negative and do not have the right BIM knowledge. The company can send
these employees on courses together with the positive and interested ones, but ﬁrst,
the BIM manager and the board of directors must see the problem and make some
registration on the employees’ BIM education, knowledge on BIM, and interest in
BIM. They must make a decision on whether to use BIM or not. If the answer is to
use BIM, then there has to be an ofﬁcial written BIM strategy, some written rules
about use of hardware and software so an employee cannot use what he/she ﬁnds
optimal, and all employees without exception have to be educated in BIM. If the
upper level does not take such a decision, the risk is that BIM will not be used any
further. The company now uses BIM ‘‘for fun,’’ use it when you want. The result
could be that BIM will not be used in future or it will take a very long time before
all use it. If the company really wants to use BIM, some ﬁnancial support for
education of all employees is required together with some time for key BIM
persons; part of the work has already been made so it is a shame not to complete
the last part internally in the company.
Externally, the company experiences nearly the same problem. The BIM
manager meets problems going aboard with different standards which the manager
cannot do anything about in a short term, but people who have direct contact to the
projects see and live with small external problems in the immediate environment.
Some of these problems can maybe be solved by solving some of the internal
problems. If the company has an ofﬁcial written BIM strategy and some written
rules about use of hardware and software, then the company’s collaborators as
advisors, subcontractors, and suppliers will know that they have to follow these
rules. It can also be easier for a project manager to choose his/her collaborator if
requirements are written down. Then, they can say whether the collaborator is
qualiﬁed or not and a lot of discussions will end and maybe we will get a better
quality of projects in the future.
To get a better implementation of BIM at the building project in general, BIM
must be required by the building owner and in the project organization, but it also
requires education and development of workable software. Financial support is
needed, and the Danish building sector is not known to have much money.
A solution can be more pilot projects where the government gives some money for
special parts of BIM and in that way takes one workable step at a time. If the
projects in the same way have to fulﬁll the wish of customization, a method to be
more efﬁcient and effective is to use mass customization by taking appropriate
lessons from the manufacturing sector which involves a mixture of standardized
components [14]. Standardized components can also make the use of BIM easier.

InnoTracing: A Framework to Investigate
the Moment-to-Moment Unfolding
of Leadership, Creativity, and Innovation
Ian Sutherland, Paul Blazek, Birgit Penzenstadler, Hans Lundberg
and Hagen Habicht
Abstract In researching the crucial drivers in innovation processes, it becomes
more and more clear that social interactions at a microlevel play an important role
when it comes to user innovation. InnoTracing sheds light on understanding what
happens in the black box of emergent, situated processes by looking at what
participating users regard as their particular ‘‘moments of signiﬁcance’’ (MOS).
The usage of the newly developed software tool InnoTrace allows real-time data
gathering, aggregating, and analyzing and works within the methodological con-
cept InnoTracing as fundamental enabler for identifying previously invisible
innovation and leadership effects. This software and methodology combination
offers researchers and companies the ability to understand how collaboration
processes among innovators work and provides valuable insights on how to create
a supporting environment.

1 Introduction
Group processes are complex, nonlinear, recursive, unpredictable, and largely tacit
[45, 54]; this is particularly true for the elusive and ephemeral phenomena of
innovation and leadership [2, 12, 24, 33, 47]. Despite decades of study, theori-
zation, and modeling, the moment-to-moment unfolding, the microlevel of inter-
action, of these processes remains an unexplored black box. The InnoTrace
software and methodology have been speciﬁcally developed to address this lacuna.
The central methodological problem has been the imposition of researchers, and
their biases, on such systems in identifying signiﬁcant moments, events, and actors
[29, 54]. Whether using survey methods, interviews, focus groups, participant
observation, or any of our other familiar data-gathering processes, researcher bias
inﬂuences the data gathered. What has been lacking, in terms of interrogating
social interactions at a microlevel, is the empowerment of research participants in
generating the data themselves. InnoTrace is a bespoke tool for researchers to put
data gathering directly into the hands of participants, to empower them to capture
the ‘‘moments of signiﬁcance’’ (MOS) they experience in unfolding processes, and
to aggregate that data for each participant and the whole group of participants—
creating individual and group cognitive maps which serve as a rich visual tapestry
of the microlevel interactions of group processes which underlie the phenomena of
leadership and innovation.
2 Background: Methodological Innovation
In recent years, researchers working on leadership and innovation have been
moving beyond their traditional phenomenological and methodological boundaries.
There is increasing attention placed on the microlevel, to the situated interactions of
participating agents and how—in real time from moment-to-moment—leadership
and innovation emerge [29, 54].
Within leadership studies, there has been a turn away from the traditional
positivist stance that typiﬁed twentieth-century approaches. As an academic dis-
cipline that has relied heavily upon psychological and social–psychological
methods, leadership scholars worldwide have been making calls for a change, to
broaden the focus from studying singular leaders and followers toward contextual
relations of interacting, subjective social agents [29, 30].
At the heart of this, shift has been a questioning of the basic ontological and
epistemological assumptions of leadership and its study. As scholars such as [2, 3,
30, 31, 52] have questioned the very nature and study of leadership (even if ‘‘it’’
exists), there has been a movement toward social–constructivist views of leader-
ship; that as a phenomenon, leadership is constructed, maintained, changed, or
dispersed at the microlevel of interactions between a variety of social agents acting
within contextualized times and spaces [1, 16, 23, 33, 37, 41, 47]. As a result, a
276
I. Sutherland et al.

number of closely related theories have arisen from this more sociological,
emergent, and ‘‘in-action’’ view of leadership. These include distributed leadership
[9, 24, 44], collective leadership [18, 36], shared leadership [41, 42], and relational
leadership [47]. Such theories treat leadership as a more complex, dynamic, and
‘‘messy’’ process than the leader-centric or follower-centric theories that have
proliferated the literature over the last century.
In a similar vein, innovation research is moving from studying coordination
issues of research and development activities within particular departments toward
an increased interest in collaborative research efforts which cross organizational
boundaries [4]. This change has taken on speed due to the development of social
software-enabled innovation methods such as communities and contests [53, 39].
Scholars nowadays recognize various forms of collaborative (open) innovation, be
it in the form of interorganizational innovation networks, or be it based on crowd-
sourcing mechanisms.
Although this research has produced a variety of studies on individual char-
acteristics [34, 49] and motivators [27, 28, 38, 50] of participants, on success-
relevant management capabilities, and organizational characteristics [13, 21, 35,
54] as well as on expected outcomes [20, 48, 49], the microfoundations of col-
laboration among innovators have to date remained a black box. In particular,
studying the in situ unfolding of creativity on the group level, such as by tracing
the actual process of identifying and spanning of boundaries, or the self-reporting
about direct group-level effects of self-rewarding activities (e.g., group ﬂow),
would lead to new insights on the actual foundations of collaborative innovation.
Yet, ultimately, these concepts and theories encounter a methodological brick wall
as researchers face the difﬁculty of getting to the in situ, socially constructed
dynamics of leadership and innovation unfolding in real time. What is missing is
the ability to visualize the seemingly invisible, moment-to-moment emergence of
such collaborative processes at the situated level of individual and group action as
people interact in space and time.
In leadership research in particular, there have been a number of new meth-
odological calls resulting from the desire to explore the level of situated and
subjective social action. Crevani, Lindgren, and Packendorff [16] have posited
‘‘…an analytical focus on leadership as it is practiced in daily interaction’’ (p. 77).
Iszatt-White has engaged an ethnomethodological approach of ‘mutual elabora-
tion’—‘‘…the idea that an action only makes sense, has meaning, in the speciﬁc
setting in which it is enacted—to explore leadership practices as irreducibly
‘events in a social order’’’ [29, p. 120] . This approach ‘‘pays attention to, and
seeks to make visible, the ‘ethno-methods’ [22] through which the social order of
[a] setting is inter-subjectively constructed…’’ [29, p. 124].
Parry [40] and Kempster and Parry [30] have been advocating for a grounded
theory [14, 15] approach to studying leadership as methodological means to
moving beyond the ontological and epistemological assumptions that chained
leadership to its singular or dyadic focus upon leaders and followers. They have
noted ‘‘Leadership research has begun to embrace the necessity of incorporating
context and process into an understanding of the manifestation of the leadership
InnoTracing: A Framework to Investigate the Moment-to-Moment Unfolding
277

phenomenon’’ (p. 106). With its focus on generating contextually relevant theo-
retical explanations for experienced phenomena based on the subjective actions
and perceptions of agents within a given context, grounded theory matches the
contemporary directions of leadership and innovation inquiry. Still, others have
proceeded with inquiry into the esthetics of leadership, focusing on the felt, sen-
sory–emotional aspects of leadership in action [7, 25, 26, 32].
At the basis of these sociological approaches toward leadership and innova-
tion—that they are phenomena emerging from social interactions, irreducible to the
actions of single individuals—is a call to look at the moment-to-moment experi-
ences and perceptions of emerging processes. Working from a process philosophy
standpoint, Wood and Ladkin [54] argue that ‘‘Rather than focusing primarily on
the individual leader, or even the dyadic relationship between leaders and fol-
lowers, the lens of process philosophy frames leadership as an unfolding, emerging
process; a continuous coming into being.’’ [54, p. 15]. Yet, here, we ﬁnd a meth-
odological quagmire. The ability to investigate the continuously ‘‘coming into
being’’ of human interactional phenomena is trying to make the invisible of highly
complex interactions visible. There are no methodological tools ready-made for this
task. While we may seek to investigate it through ethnography and conceptualize it
as an ethnomethodological process (such as argued by Iszatt-White [29]), we run up
against problems of observer inﬂuence and interpretation. Similarly, we often ﬁnd
ourselves in the realm of ex post facto research and analysis when what we really
desire is to, as Wood and Ladkin [54] have suggested, focus on the level of par-
ticipating actors’ perceptions of the moments of the phenomena.
What is required is a methodological approach that empowers participating
agents to document and comment upon signiﬁcant moments as they relate to
leadership and innovation—what InnoTracing refers to as (MOS)—as they unfold
in real time. This is the core of the InnoTracing project, to provide participants and
researchers insights into these seemingly invisible moments when ‘‘something’’
seems to be happening. The InnoTrace tool allows participants to capture—via
picture, video, text, or voice notes—moments which feel signiﬁcant in the
unfolding, emergent processes of leadership, and innovation, as they happen. The
resulting methodology seeks to provide a methodological tool to aid researchers in
working with the gathered data.
3 InnoTracing: A New Methodology in Leadership
and Innovation Research
InnoTracing1 is a methodological development that combines a unique data-
gathering and aggregating software tool—InnoTrace—with social science methods
to help researchers and participants open, visualize, and investigate the (MOS) of
1 http://www.innotracing.org

leadership and innovation. The InnoTrace tool is designed as user-friendly and
user-conﬁgurable software, affording participants the ability to capture and trace
the moment-to-moment messy, tacit, and intangible elements of leadership and
innovation. The tool empowers participants to document these moments as they
feel them occur in real time (through photos, videos, text ﬁles, or sound messages),
while the Web-based software collects and organizes this data in a variety of ways.
At a basic level, with each use of the InnoTrace software, participants document
unfolding processes by photographing, video recording, or creating text or voice
notes of the MOS of an unfolding process. The underpinning concept is to
empower participants to make ‘‘visible’’ what they perceive as signiﬁcant (whether
the signiﬁcance is of something positive, negative, or even mundane) in the
unfolding processes of which they are a part.
This type of participant-centered data-gathering methodology has anthropo-
logical roots where participants have been engaged to visually document their
perceptions of the world around them (e.g., [8, 42, 43]). In organizational studies,
precedence has been set in studies by Buchanan [11] and Warren [51] where they
have investigated the esthetic experiences of individual social agents, asking them
to photograph elements of their daily experience to make visible ‘‘how it feels to
work here’’ [51]. Within leadership research, Wood and Ladkin [54] involved
participant managers and organizational consultants in photographing ‘‘…those
usually hidden elements, which they perceived as contributing to the experience of
leadership in their workplaces’’ (p. 15). In studies on the microphases and par-
ticipant roles in innovation groups, both in physical and virtual settings,
researchers have used a variety of tracing approaches including audio and video
recording, screen shots, and versioning/history functions of activities on collabo-
ration-supporting innovation software [5, 6]. Despite the valuable insights that
have resulted from these research initiatives, a systematic means of gathering,
aggregating, and analyzing participant-generated data is still lacking.
As a researcher-conﬁgurable tool, InnoTrace provides a unique platform for
participant-generated data. The standard ﬁve-step process is as follows:
1. Phenomena of interest With each project, the researcher(s) indicates to the
participants the phenomena of interest around which they would like to gather
MOS. For Wood and Ladkin [54], this was ‘‘hidden elements’’ which con-
tributed to the experience of leadership. For Warren [51], it was the visuali-
zation of ‘‘how it feels to work here.’’ With regard to leadership and innovation
processes, it may be tipping points when things coalesce or take new directions.
2. MOS Tagging Within the tool, researchers can include a variety of classiﬁcation
options (tags) or leave tagging open to the discretion of research participants.
With each data entry participants can provide their own tag, or in the case of
researcher speciﬁed tags select from available tags. Additionally, in the case of
open tagging, participants may select a tag from the cloud of tags generated by
all research participants. These may be descriptors such as ‘‘leadership
moment’’ or ‘‘idea generation’’ or ‘‘insight’’ and/or they may be evaluative
InnoTracing: A Framework to Investigate the Moment-to-Moment Unfolding
279

elements that classify the importance of a moment (e.g., a star rating indicating
relative level of importance or impact of a moment).
3. Participant-Generated MOS The tool is made available to research participants
who, following the Phenomena of Interest outline and using MOS Tagging,
engage in gathering data on the MOS of processes in which they are involved.
4. MOS Aggregation and Visualization As research participants gather data, the
InnoTrace software collects and organizes this data by user, time, format, and
tag:
(a) User: Each data element is registered as generated by a unique author. This
provides indication of who generated the data as well as frequency and
quantity analyses of the overall data set by individual author. Through this,
the data set can be viewed as a whole, or segmented to look at individual
participants or groups of participants.
(b) Time: Each data element is registered by when it was created. This provides
indication of the frequency and quantity of data as it was generated chro-
nologically. Through this, the data set can be viewed as a whole (providing
a distribution view of MOS over time) or segmented to look at speciﬁc time
periods.
(c) Format: Each data element is registered by the type of format used (pho-
tograph, video, text). Through this, the data can be viewed as a whole
indicating the overall types of formats used, or segmented to look at one
format type at a time (e.g., to look at all photographic data generated).
(d) Tagging: Tagging is the process of using a descriptor or evaluator tag for
data points. This may be left to the discretion of users or speciﬁed by
researchers. Through this tagging, the data set can be segmented by par-
ticipant-generated classiﬁcations.
In total, the gathered data represent a cognitive map of the happenings in the
group. More precisely, it is a shared or composite cognitive map [17, 45] of group
processes. It aggregates the perspectives of the group members in the form of a
joint context map (as opposed to a strip map) [19, 46] comprising decisive events
along with their respective contexts. It thereby enables a better understanding of
the boundary conditions of activities [46].
The meanings assigned to the uploaded representations of MOS represent
‘‘labels’’ [10] whose creation—in contrast to traditional cognitive maps—is not
exposed to any researcher’s interpretation. As a result, anything gathered by the
InnoTrace software can be seen as unbiased (uninﬂuenced) situated data collected
by self-reﬂective participants in the moment.
For this pilot study, participants were given an overview of the InnoTrace
project and software, along with a short (5–10 min) training session upon their
arrival at the conference. In the main exhibition space of the conference, volun-
teers (who came to be known as ‘‘InnoTracers’’) were greeted by members of the
InnoTrace team as they arrived at the InnoTrace exhibition table, given their
unique cowtags—which included their unique username and password printed on
280
I. Sutherland et al.

the cowtag, and then the project overview and training session. Each username was
anonymized (e.g., test1@innotrace.com) to maintain participant conﬁdentiality in
generated data.
Within the explanation and overview of the project, participants were instructed
on how to use the software (practice runs at logging in and creating test data
points), the phenomenon of interest, and MOS tagging. Regarding the phenome-
non of interest, participants were asked to ‘‘document MOS of your learning
experiences during the conference.’’ This explanation was deemed wide enough to
allow participants to be free as to what they interpreted as signiﬁcant. Regarding
MOS tagging, the research team decided to allow participants full discretion to
create their own tags for data points. During the conference, as the tagging
increased, multiple users began using existing tags from the growing tag cloud
visible in the InnoTrace application.
4 InnoTrace Software Development and Programming
The development of the easy-to-use software tool InnoTrace2 proved to be a
crucial task in this project. The programmed data storage is utilizing a modern
NoSQL solution: MongoDB3 was chosen because if its broad usage, stability, and
the ability to freely modify and update the data schema during our iterative
development cycles. The back end, powered by Java, is leveraged with the power
of the Restlet Framwork4 to provide the possibility of a REST API. Communi-
cation between the server and the client is completely done with the help of
JSON.5 Using such a RESTful approach has the advantage of being completely
transparent to the client system as well as easily replaceable since the technology
that REST is based on is regular HTTP. A custom authentication and authorization
system with a sophisticated access control system guaranteed a ﬁne-grained
control of user access. Such a system paved the ground for many different user
privileges to ensure ﬂexibility in terms of what a user is allowed to do. Google’s
‘‘Dart Language’’6 as the client development platform—although in its early
development stage—proved to be a good replacement for traditional JavaScript
applications. With the decision to create InnoTrace as Web App, a high ﬂexibility
in terms of usage on different devices could be achieved. The user interface design
reacts in a responsive way on the display possibilities of the user’s devices and
minimizes user irritation with its clear and simple interaction process (see Fig. 1).

5 Analysis and Initial Findings
Data gathered through the InnoTrace application can be used for most forms of
qualitative analysis as well as for quasi- and descriptive statistics. The data are
open to all the forms of analysis that have been developed for participant-gener-
ated data including cognitive maps such as the creation of submaps, e.g., identity
maps, cause maps, categorization maps, social system maps, hierarchic maps, and
cybernetic maps [25]. Moreover, quasi statistics can help in estimating the cen-
trality of issues or incongruences between different views present.
While the above-described process is the essential methodological approach
offered by InnoTracing, it is purposefully open-ended, particularly regarding
analysis. InnoTracing is itself a researcher-conﬁgurable methodology. Using this
basic structure, researchers may approach the data-gathering and analyzing
methods in ways best suited to their research questions and goals.
We are currently analyzing the accumulated data sets of the ﬁrst case studies
that allow insights on the study subject of MOS in leadership and innovation as
well as different usage scenarios for the tool, e.g., usage as protocol, for personal
comments, personal reﬂections, abstraction and transfer insights, and feedback on
the tool itself.

6 Conclusion
This paper presented InnoTracing, a framework to investigate the moment-to-
moment unfolding of leadership, creativity, and innovation, and gave a preview of
the software tool InnoTrace that is the prototypical realization to implement the
concepts.
The impact of our work is that it provides researchers as well as practitioners
with a means to gather data on and analyze the nonlinear and largely tacit (group)
processes that take place during workshops, seminars, or over longer periods of
time in any working unit. Practitioners might not have the complete theoretic
background for a full-ﬂedged phenomena analysis, but they may well get insights
by performing statistical analysis and reﬂecting on the data sets.
Our next steps are to analyze the data sets of our ﬁrst case studies, to extend our
set of studies to other application scenarios and to different industry sectors, and to
develop a stand-alone version of the tool that can be used off-line.

Introducing Mass Customization to SMEs
in Furniture Industry: A Case Study
Nikola Suzic´, Zoran Anišic´ and Cipriano Forza
Abstract Even though much insights has been gained by academic research on
mass customization (MC), companies still suffer from a lack of guidelines and
supports that help them in the process of implementing MC. The paper presents an
approach to help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in implementing MC by
illustrating its actual application in SME operating in the furniture industry.
Possibilities of MC implementation in the case company and more generally in the
SME furniture manufacturers are discussed in the conclusions of the work.

1 Introduction
Mass customization (MC) is a concept that has been around for more than
20 years, and since the ﬁrst literature appearances [1, 2], it has been discussed,
well understood, and recorded in work of many researchers. But what is clear to
researchers specialized in MC may be far from the comprehension of a number of
time-pressed managers and engineers working in SMEs. This is also due to the fact
that MC is composed of so many techniques, practices, and principles that it takes

time and appropriate training to manage it effectively in actual settings. Companies
will often be in front of the serious challenges when coping with the implemen-
tation of MC, challenges such as where to start with the MC implementation, how
to proceed with MC implementation, where does it end, what are the effects, what
MC techniques should we implement, how much will it cost, how much time and
human resources should we devote for this kind of project, what is our current
position in implementing of MC, and did we already implement some of the tools
without knowing it, what are the possible downfalls, is it a continuous and ongoing
job or a one shot project, etc.
Hence, while the research has made considerable progresses in understanding
what MC is, what goals does it address, and what are its effects, there is limited
guidelines for practitioners on the process of its implementation. There is a need to
develop approaches, tools, techniques, and guidelines to help SMEs in the
implementation of the MC. It can also be argued that the future will lie in holistic
approach of MC implementation [3].
The present paper contributes in covering the need of practical guidelines for
MC implementation. It does it by proposing an approach for analysis of the current
state in areas where it is possible to identify speciﬁc MC improvement initiatives.
This approach is structured in four areas of analysis namely
1. Product assortment and part commonality,
2. Sales procedure and product conﬁguration,
3. Production sequence and material ﬂows, and
4. Cost.
Approach is presented by describing a case of MC implementation in a furni-
ture-manufacturing company located in Serbia. By interacting with the academia,
this company understood that implementing a MC strategy was very appropriate
for its market.
That company realized that the trend of its product variants increased in last few
years. These variant increases lead to problems in design, production, and sales
processes of the company. Same products with slightly different characteristics
were designed repetitively from the beginning, production was not able to meet the
deadlines of nonstandard products, and salesmen were not restricted in variants
offering to the customers. Furthermore, salesmen were often forced to contact
production engineers in order to determine whether wanted conﬁguration is pos-
sible to produce. These contacts of salesmen and production engineers had often
more than one interaction. Also, nonstandard orders many times lead to mistakes
in production which required additional time to correct and lead to dissatisfaction
of customers. By applying the proposed analysis approach, this company was
expecting the following beneﬁts:
• Better understanding of current state of the company making a clear overview of
design, production, and sales processes,
• Getting ideas of how to advance current status of the company and eliminate
some if not all of the problems the company encounters,
288
N. Suzic´ et al.

• Understanding MC concept trough presentation of effects MC concept could
have if implemented in the company, and
• Making basis for successful MC implementation.
The situation faced by the given company is common to many SMEs in the
furniture industry as well as in other industry sectors too. The presented work is
therefore intended to be a ﬁrst step toward the development of a wider research that
will provide SMEs with practical tools and guidelines on how to implement MC.
The remaining part of the present paper is structured in ﬁve sections. First two
sections present the MC in the furniture industry and provide some information on
the furniture industry in Southeast Europe. The subsequent section presents the
proposed approach by illustrating its application in a SME operating in a furniture
industry. Finally, in the last two sections, the results of the application of the
proposed approach are discussed and some conclusions are ﬁnally drawn.
2 Furniture Industry in the World and Mass
Customization
Furniture industry in the world is in a constant growth. Besides the old players
from Europe and North America, today Asia is being more present in this ﬁeld of
manufacturing, especially China whose exports are rising year by year (http://
world-furniture-confederation.com/statistics.htm).
As the size of the market grows, so does the interest of the researchers for the
area of MC furniture production. There are a number of papers discussing
implementation of MC in furniture industry [4], customer preferences for furniture
customization [5], environmental issues concerning MC furniture manufacturing
[6], data management in customized furniture manufacturing [7], and a number of
case studies [8].
The research has also shown that the number of customized products as
opposed to mass produced goods is increasing in the world market [9] (Fig. 1). In
that sense, many researchers see MC as a strategy of the future for the furniture
industry [5]. We can almost say that MC is a must for manufacturers in some
countries who are not cost-competent with today’s rules in the furniture market.
3 Furniture Industry in the Region of Southeast Europe
For the moment, there are four types of furniture manufacturing equally present in
Serbia: upholstered furniture, massive furniture, laminated furniture, and interior
furnishing. Because of a good raw material base and the vicinity of the European
market, there is a good possibility for development of Serbian furniture industry.
Introducing Mass Customization to SMEs in Furniture Industry: A Case Study
289

Manufacturing ﬁrms in Serbia have, like other companies in the world,
undertaken a job of creating an environment for customization. In most of the
cases, companies are still implementing customization and not MC. At this
moment, we can ascertain that these initiatives are only basic movements in the
MC direction.
Small and medium enterprises (SME) sector is maybe the most interested in the
application of MC principles, and one of the possible scenarios is that this sector
relates closely with the universities and institutes as some researchers openly
propose [10], allowing them to pursue a MC concept on the deeper level and with
as much as possible low engagement of human resources from the company itself.
One such case will be presented in the paper.
Research of the MC concept in Serbia is also making its appearance [11]. Some
researchers have already shown [12] that the furniture market of Southeast Europe
(particularly Serbia) would welcome MC initiatives and that there is a market for
mass-customized products in the furniture industry.
4 Guiding a Furniture Manufacturer Toward MC: A Case
Study
The case was analyzed by the support of company personnel, managers, and
engineers and was set to be a pre-MC implementation analysis.
Throughout the project, the analysis of the company and possibilities of MC
implementation was focused on the following:
1. Product assortment,
2. Sales procedure,
3. Production sequence analysis,
4. Part commonality analysis,
5. Material ﬂows,
6. Basic calculations for product conﬁgurator implementation,
Fig. 1 Market share of
standardized versus
customized economies [9]

N. Suzic´ et al.

7. Impact of product conﬁgurator introduction, and
8. Final cost analysis.
Basically, the approach taken in this case analysis follows the procedure for
action research cycles proposed by Coghlan and Brannick [13]. Coghlan and
Brannick propose four steps: analyze current situation, deﬁne and plan the changes
that have to be realized, implement the changes planned, and evaluate the obtained
results. The presented research was based on ﬁrst two steps of the mentioned
approach. The research was not rigorously structured in terms of analysis
sequencing at the beginning of the project, but in some way a bit ad hoc leaving
the decision of the next steps opened. The goal was not to be structured, but to
have a broad analysis of the company and its capabilities in order to set some
grounds for future implementation of MC based on the market needs and com-
pany’s current product assortment.
4.1 Product Assortment Analysis
In this step, the product assortment of the furniture company was analyzed. Three
big groups of products depending on the purpose of use were found:
• ofﬁce furniture,
• home furniture, and
• furniture for conference halls, theaters, cinemas, etc.
After analysis of the product assortment, the project team agreed that the most
interesting part of the product assortment for MC implementation is the home
furniture. Speciﬁcally, the family selected for the pilot program was the family of
sofas, because the most adjustments in the past were done on this product family.
The sofa family is comprised of 8 distinct products with a number of versions
that appear in production estimated at a couple of hundred basic versions. This
group of products is made from the same materials and intermediate parts. They
differ in design, construction, and price.
After choosing the product family, the representative product was selected
using the Pareto analysis on sales quotes in the past. One of the ‘‘economy’’
models (named Aphrodite) dominated the analysis (Fig. 2). This was expected
knowing roughly the sales numbers in the last few years.
The product was then analyzed by the raw materials used in its production and
assembly. In this step, it was recorded that the company has no restrictions
regarding the solution space and in order to get the buyer agrees to make changes
that characterize the craft production.

291

4.2 Sales Procedure Analysis
The sale of the products is done in a number of ways, but the majority of the sofa
families are sold in company’s salesrooms directly to the customers. The models
are presented in a couple of variants in terms of textile combinations to give a
better insight to a buyer on all the options he has to choose from. This is the
modality in which the standard sofa models are sold.
As previously mentioned, there is also nonstandard part of the offer. The system
functions in a way that the buyer asks for a change in some of the products
features. The change request is sent to the producer for approval. Production and
design engineers approve or disapprove the change. If the change is possible and
can be done, the price for the new product variant is calculated and sent to the
buyer. The buyer then decides whether he will buy the product.
The delivery time varies depending on the type of the products. A serial pro-
duction is delivered in 7–15 days, a standardized product is delivered in
15–30 days, and a nonstandard product may take more time to be delivered.

4.3 Production Sequence Analysis
The production is organized in job shops, grouping the machines of the same type
together. There are job shops for the following: sponge processing, wood pro-
cessing, laminated material processing, textile processing, metal processing, wire
core processing, and product assembly. In the production of representative prod-
uct, sponge processing, wood processing, metal processing, and product assembly
are included (Fig. 3).
4.4 Part Commonality Analysis
The complete architecture of product representative was captured in this step,
locating common, semi-variant, and variant parts in the product (Fig. 4).
4.5 Material Flows
Material ﬂows of the representative product have been recorded in this step (Fig. 5).
Engineers have already tried to reduce the transport of products in the production
system to minimum, in order not to damage the products in the movement.

4.6 Basic Calculations for Product Conﬁgurator
Implementation
This step included assessment of cost-effectiveness and evaluation of proﬁtability
of product conﬁgurator by calculating the increase in production costs and the cost
of materials when creating nonstandard products. The increase was compared with
predicted increase in sales of standard and nonstandard products. Assessment also
included system changes as well as changes resulting from the introduction of
product conﬁgurator.

4.6.1 Creating the Worst-Case Conﬁguration Scenario
In order to have the cost-effectiveness analysis, the ‘‘worst possible’’ product
conﬁguring scenario was designed.
To enable the analysis of different scenarios in product conﬁguration, the
product was split into the three units: the sofa sides (unit A), the main bed (unit B),
and the additional bed (unit C).
Using this division, we deﬁned nonstandard modiﬁcations, and of all changes,
we chose the ones that make the biggest cost increase in the production (Table 1).
The model of nonstandard product was named ‘‘ABC model’’ in the product
speciﬁcation, according to the naming of the units.
Consideration of the worst possible conﬁguration scenario must also take the
textile changes into account. The most expensive textile was chosen for the cal-
culations according to the decision that the most expensive version of the product
is created.
During the analysis, design limitations were found for every unit of the product
(Table 1). These limitations represent main constraints which must be taken into
account during the design process for every product conﬁguration. Analysis
showed that limitation for sofa sides (Unit A) is predetermined design which is
limited by a number of designed variants. For the basic bed (Unit B), limitation is
the lifting mechanism which constrains the possibilities to change the size of the
bed (length) having in mind mechanical characteristics of the standard lifting
mechanism. Additional bed (Unit C) is limited by the statistical endurance, and
calculations show that 80 cm is the maximum length that used material can
withstand.
Marked limitations are important for purposes of MC implementation in
company. They imply that there is limited number of possible variants with current
product design, mechanical properties of parts, and materials used. Furthermore,
this leads to conclusion that mentioned design limitations are the ones to be
worked on in order to create greater number of product variants in the future. The

changes could be, for example, new sides design, introduction of new lifting
mechanisms, or change in materials for additional bed.
4.6.2 Material Norms
Using the cutting plans deﬁned with the Table 1 and the norms of materials, the
total production cost for a standard product ‘‘Aphrodite’’ was calculated. After-
ward, the percentage of increase in material cost for nonstandard ‘‘ABC’’ product
was calculated. The cost increase went from 0 to 23.55 % by product part com-
pared to the standard product.
4.6.3 Changes in Production
In order to produce a nonstandard product, the changes should be implemented in
seven of twenty-one operations in the standard product. In only two of those seven
operations, there is a need to change (produce) a new tool. In this case, the cost of
the tools is low. Other changes refer mainly to the changes in the CNC codes.
4.6.4 Material Utilization
Because of the lower quantity of the nonstandard products, there is a problem to
make efﬁcient ‘‘cut-out schemes.’’ This increases the cost of the material. The
calculated efﬁciency decrease is around 5 % as opposed to the standard products.
The calculated efﬁciency decrease varies from the type of material in case, being it
the wood parts, the sponge, or the textile. The biggest decrease is expected in
textile materials because of the raw material dimensions.
4.7 Impact of Product Conﬁgurator Introduction
The differences between the standard product and the nonstandard product in
production processes are managed in the work order document. The changes are
added in the work order, and the workers follow the instructions. This kind of
organization is subjected to the appearance of mistakes. This is the point where the
product conﬁgurator can give substantial results giving the standard list with the
operations to the workers.
The team agreed that the points of conﬁgurator impact on the production system
would be the following:
296
N. Suzic´ et al.

• The amount of manual work in taking nonstandard orders and managing the
work orders in production would be signiﬁcantly reduced and in some cases
completely left out,
• The mistakes caused by the misinterpretation of the work order would also be
signiﬁcantly reduced,
• Increase in sales is expected after the product conﬁgurator is in place,
• The product stocks should be revised with the product conﬁgurator and MC
concept in place, and
• Stock of raw materials: Expectation is that there may be increase in the raw
laminated material stocks up to 20 %, depending on the orders sequencing. The
sponge stocks would not change. The textile stocks would represent a problem
because of the vast number of textile options. There is assumption that there
would be a need to revise the textile list in order to optimize the expenses.
4.8 Final Cost Analysis
In order to calculate the cost-effectiveness of introducing MC into the given
company, two types of costs were taken into account: one-time costs and costs per
unit of the product.
One-time costs that were taken into account are as follows: product conﬁgurator
introduction, maintenance of the product conﬁgurator, special tools production,
worker training, IT hardware acquisition, and minimal stocks build up.
Costs per unit of the product include the following: increased material con-
sumption norms, higher material waste, costs of longer production time, costs of
increased assembly time, and increased transport costs.
Total cost of MC introduction per product was then calculated with the
assumption of 20 % participation of nonstandard products in the sales in next
4 years. The result was the increase of 23.02 % in cost per unit of the nonstandard
product (Fig. 6). The numbers would be more favorable if the nonstandard
products would sell more.
The calculations were made in order to predict the additional cost per product
sold in the observed period as opposed to the current state in company. All cal-
culations were done in accordance with the prices of the raw materials and labor
market in Serbia.
Analyzing the product lifecycle, the project group presumed that the product
will be sold in the period of next 4 years with minor changes. The cost analysis
was done for that period of time.

5 Discussion
The research was done with the assistance and full participation of the company
management, design, and production engineers. Results of applied analysis steps
lead to discussion and conclusions summarized below:
• Proposed method of analysis was graded as applicable and suitable from the
company’s side.
• Research showed that initial investment in MC would not be of very high level
in the company’s terms.
• It was concluded that implementation of product conﬁgurator draws with it a
series of changes in the system itself and in production generally. This fact is
known from the corresponding literature [14, 15] and was conﬁrmed in the
research.
• Research showed that there are many changes in the company that are needed in
order to implement MC and that are in fact very low in costs and only dealing
with organization of production, like implementation of form postponement
strategy and changing the sequence of the operations.
• The company ‘‘convinced itself’’ that MC is plausible in practice and not so
demanding at the start. In-depth analysis of production processes and the
product changes done in the near past have persuaded the company management
that the changes in products will come being wanted or not.
• The ‘‘personalized model’’ for MC implementation was created for the company
through presented project.
• The increase in nonstandard product price has been calculated to be 23.02 %
which is close to the theoretical 20 % which the buyer is ready to pay [5].
Additionally, the studied case is the ‘‘worst conﬁguration’’ scenario, where in
practice, most of the demanded changes will be minor, leading the price well
beneath the 20 % increase.

• Cutting efﬁciency (laminated material) has also been treated for the worst
possible case, where in practice, the more pieces of products are being produced,
the waste will be lesser. So we could expect these prices to be lower too.
• The costs were calculated in the 4-year period time, giving the total expenses.
The conﬁgurator maintenance is the expense that will come in per-month cycles
and is to be treated in such a way.
• The costs were treated for the representative model (Aphrodite). It is to be
expected that the costs will drop down signiﬁcantly if the MC implementation
would cover the whole product range.
• It can be expected that implementation of the product conﬁgurator will rise the
sales of other similar products in offer.
• The positive effects of the MC implementation on company were ascertained by
both university and company project members.
• It can be expected that with implementation of the MC concept, company would
acquire a concurrent advantage on the market and further strengthen its position.
Analyzing results of the research, the project team concluded that a path for
successful MC implementation could be derived from the given results and that the
steps toward application are to be taken. In this way, the pre-MC implementation
analysis based on the proposed method was completed successfully and with valid
results showing that MC implementation is possible in the given company and
would have multiple positive effects if implemented.
6 Conclusions of the Research
The approach applied in this case company analyses consider the general proce-
dure proposed by Coghlan and Brannick [13] for action research cycles and is
adapted to the case of MC. The application was mainly based on ﬁrst two steps of
the given approach: analysis of current situation and deﬁning and planning the
changes that have to be realized.
Analysis of current situation step was divided into eight phases in the research:
1. Product assortment,
2. Sales procedure,
3. Production sequence analysis,
4. Part commonality analysis,
5. Material ﬂow,
6. Basic calculations for product conﬁgurator implementation,
7. Impact of product conﬁgurator introduction, and
8. Final cost analysis.
Based on the research results, we can ascertain that proposed procedure can be
applied successfully in furniture-manufacturing SMEs as pre-MC implementation
analysis. Procedure reveals problems in company processes and emphasizes

critical points for MC application. In result, procedure can lead to proposal of
feasible solutions for MC implementation in analyzed furniture-manufacturing
company.
Furthermore, it is expected that same procedure can be generalized and applied
as introduction analysis for MC projects in SMEs of other industry sectors having
the same or similar starting positions like the case study company.
Future research should be focused on the application of proposed procedure in
furniture sector as well as investigating possibilities to apply this procedure in
other industries.

Is Sustainable Mass Customization
an Oxymoron? An Empirical Study
to Analyze the Environmental Impacts
of a MC Business Model
Golboo Pourabdollahian, Marco Taisch and Frank T. Piller
Abstract For about two decades, mass customization (MC) is considered as a
proper business model for the markets characterized by heterogeneous needs of
customers. It can be considered as a win–win strategy that beneﬁts both customers
and companies. However, when it comes to environmental impacts of MC, things
are less clear and more challenging. This paper aims at investigating how a MC
business model performs in terms of environmental sustainability based on an
empirical analysis.

1 Introduction
From its early introduction as a strategy, mass customization (MC) has changed
signiﬁcantly the market offer and the value proposition for customers. The concept
of MC is based on the fact that customers like to be treated as individuals and want
to be felt important. They do not want to be involved only in purchasing process,
but they tend to be a part of an experience while buying a product [7]. Meanwhile,
customers are more concerned about design, esthetic, function, and other attributes
of the product and they want to be involved in design process [3]. From the

companies’ perspective, MC acts as an economically viable strategy for the
companies. Pursuing MC enables companies to provide their customers with
personalized shoes which are produced with near-to-mass production efﬁciency
[14]. MC generates beneﬁts for both company and customers. It enables compa-
nies to follow emerging customer trends and bring value to them so that they can
be a source of proﬁt generation for the company. It gives customers the feeling of
being important and the excitement of being a part of an experience by co-design
while providing them with a limited variety that facilitates the purchasing process
[5, 8, 13]. MC can also enhance the level of satisfaction of design-sensitive
customers by giving them the opportunity to design their own product. However,
like any other strategy, the concept of MC has its own pros and cons.
At a ﬁrst glance, the term MC itself looks like an oxymoron. Combining the
attributes of personalization with mass production to offer customized products to
mass market, at the beginning, seemed to be more an abstract concept rather than a
practical one. However, during last two decades, numerous studies have been
carried out to introduce operational and technological enablers for MC, and
accordingly now, it has become a trend followed by many companies in different
sectors. However, a satisfactory performance of a ﬁrm in terms of MC does not
necessarily guarantee its success. Emergence of other trends, such as sustain-
ability, within both market and industry, obliges the companies to integrate them
with their current strategies and to come out with a business model to enhance the
performance of the ﬁrm in different perspectives. In this regard, currently, cus-
tomers’ demands for more environmentally friendly products on one hand and
tough regulations by governments on the other hand bring out the concept of
sustainability as a point of attention for companies. Accordingly, a MC company,
like any other company, should monitor and improve its sustainability perfor-
mance. However, when it comes to environmental impacts of MC, things are less
clear and get more challenging. In fact, how MC affects sustainability in a ﬁrm is
still an open debate. Although in very recent publications there have been debates
in this regard [1, 2] and proposals of models to integrate MC and sustainability [4],
the discussion is still open since there are very few studies investigating the
problem in depth and for speciﬁc industries.
This paper aims at targeting this challenge to ﬁnd out whether a MC business
model can be sustainable or not. In other words, can the term ‘‘sustainable mass
customization (SMC)’’ be considered as a future business model for MC compa-
nies or it is only an oxymoron. We tried to ﬁnd out the answer by investigating the
possible environmental impacts of a MC business model in footwear industry.
At ﬁrst, we propose a MC business model based on both theoretical and empirical
data. In next step, we evaluate the sustainability performance of the proposed MC
business model throughout two surveys. Finally, we propose a list of possible and
potential impacts of several MC enablers, mentioned in the proposed MC business
model, based on a set of sustainability key performance indicators (KPI).

2 Development of a Mass Customization Business Model
Designing a business model is a challenging task. It does not only requires a ﬁtting
structure which can connect all the parts of business together, but most importantly,
it requires a clear view of what one means by ‘‘business model.’’ Without knowing
the objective of a business model and its speciﬁc deﬁnition, it is impossible to build
an effective business model for a company. We deﬁne the term ‘‘business model’’ in
this study as a tool containing a set of strategic choices, alternatives, and guidelines
to support a company to create, deliver, and capture different forms of value within
a value network. It describes how a company can reach its strategic objectives
which have been set based on the main strategy of the ﬁrm.
Accordingly to implement MC, a company needs to modify the as is business
model based on the requirements of MC as a strategy. Development of a MC business
model depends upon the deﬁnition of its structure and building blocks. The structure
of a BM describes its boundaries and illustrates the areas that will be studied more in
detail during BM development process. The reference structure applied in this study
is the one proposed by Osterwlader and Pigneur [6] (called business model canvas)
with minor modiﬁcations in order to adopt it to the context of interest. The initial
business model canvas of Osterwlader and Pigneur includes 9 building blocks that
can be logically grouped into three areas: Left side relates to efﬁciency (key partners,
key activities, key resources, and cost structure), the right side relates to value
delivery (customer segment, customer relationship, channels, and revenue streams),
and ﬁnally the value proposition which is in between. The proposed change is to
merge the blocks of cost and revenue into a single block called performance. This
is mainly due to the fact that in a MC business, not only cost and revenue are
considered as critical issues but also evaluation of customization and efﬁciency level
of the ﬁrm is important [10]. Figure 1 illustrates the structure of MC business model.
In next step, the contents of each building block need to be deﬁned. Each block
should introduce a set of enablers that facilitate and support the implementation of
MC. Therefore, the ﬁnal developed MC business model can be considered as a
library of MC enablers. Identiﬁcation of these enablers is based on both theoretical
and empirical data. Theoretical data are collected by an extensive literature review.
In order to collect the theoretical data, a total number of 142 studies published in
books, journals, and proceedings during the period of 1996–2012 were reviewed.
Empirical data are collected by analyzing ﬁve MC footwear companies as case
studies. The analysis comprehends both cases of small–medium companies and
large companies. Data were collected through different primary and secondary
sources including questionnaire, personal interview, papers, releases, and publi-
cations on scientiﬁc magazines, ofﬁcial company Web site, ofﬁcial ﬁnancial
reports, blogs, forums, communities, and online sector magazine release [10].
Table 1 reﬂects a summary of analyzed case studies.
As a result, a set of enablers and objectives for MC was identiﬁed for each
block of business model. Figure 2 shows the ﬁnal MC business model containing
MC enablers.

3 Environmental Impacts of a MC Business Model
Development of a MC business model provides the required backbone to analyze
the environmental impacts of such a BM. In other words, we can monitor the
performance of the MC business model in terms of environmental sustainability to

understand ‘‘Is mass customization sustainable?’’ In order to track the possible
impacts, three KPI are deﬁned in this study: waste production, energy consump-
tion, and emission. Waste production describes the amount of produced waste
during the whole life cycle of the product. Energy consumption relates to the
amount of used energy during the whole life cycle of the product. Finally emission
describes the amount of green house gas emission during the whole life cycle of
the product. Accordingly to evaluate the sustainability inﬂuences of MC, we
analyzed the impact of each MC enabler presented in the proposed business model
on each of three sustainability KPIs.
3.1 Data Collection
In order to collect data, two surveys were designed and sent to two different target
groups. One survey was designed to target MC experts in academia and the other
to target MC footwear companies. The ﬁrst survey was sent to 164 academia
experts at universities and research centers, and the second one was sent to 35 MC
footwear companies. In both surveys, the respondents were asked to identify the
possible impacts of 13 selected MC enablers on each sustainability KPI. The total
number of MC enablers used in surveys was reduced to 13 since enablers related
to the blocks of customer segment, value proposition, and performance are not
relevant to the concept of sustainability.
3.2 Data Analysis
Collected data from both surveys were analyzed using a descriptive approach. This
was due to the fact that since there was no dependent variable in the data set, an
economic approach was not considered as a proper method for data analysis.
Figure 3 illustrates a general picture of data analysis. It embodies the statistical
distribution of participants’ answers regarding the possible environmental impacts
of each MC enabler. Each ﬁgure relates to one of the sustainability KPIs. To
understand the impact of each MC objective on each MC KPI, It is necessary to
ﬁnd the central tendency of the data for each variable. There are usually three main
measurement methods to ﬁnd the central tendency: mean, median, and mode.
These measures are used to focus on where the data are clustered or centered.
Taking into account that our data set contained discrete data, the mode was the
most appropriate method to discover the central tendency.
Analysis of the mode of data for each MC enabler led us to highlight its
possible impact on the speciﬁc sustainability KPIs. In cases where data show more
than one mode, all of them were considered as the possible impact. Table 2 depicts
a summary of the results of data analysis.

4 Discussion
Table 2 can be seen as a guideline to clarify the environmental impacts of the
proposed MC business model and hence support the companies to conﬁgure a
more eco-friendly MC business model. However, the results of data analysis bring
into light some challenges and debates as well. These open issues can shape a part
of the future research streams in the ﬁeld of MC. In this paper, we introduce and
discuss about four main areas of challenge for sustainable implication of MC. The
environmental impacts of these four MC enablers are bolded in Table 2. Data
analysis revealed these enablers as critical mainly based on two reasons: (1) There
is more than one mode for data; hence, it is not possible to clarify the dominant
environmental impact and (2) Although there is a single data mode, the frequency
of one of the other two variables is very close to the frequency of data mode.
Clariﬁcation of the reasons and initiative behind each challenging area and ena-
bler, however, needs a more focused research and further analysis of each area.
4.1 Robust Production Processes
Robust production processes are widely considered as a main capability for MC
[11]; however, the impact of this major MC enabler on sustainability has been
always a debate in academia. While some believe that having a robust production
process is a driver for an efﬁcient production and hence a lower level of waste [9],

still there is no clear insight on how robust production affects sustainability
performance. Our data analysis conﬁrms such a problematic challenge. While
45.45 % consider it as a force to reduce waste, 41.82 % do not give it any speciﬁc
role in terms of waste production. The same scenario holds for energy con-
sumption where 47.27 % believe that robust production processes do not affect the
level of energy consumption. In contrast, 43.64 % take it as a driving force to
reduce the level of energy consumption. The more interesting outcome regarding
this MC enabler relates to distribution of answers in academia and in industry. In
academia, the percentage of respondents who consider robust production process
as a driving force to decrease waste and energy consumption is equal to those who
believe it does not affect any sustainability KPI. However, among industrial par-
ticipants, the outcome is more concrete, emphasizing on the fact that the majority
of practitioners do not consider any role for this enabler in terms of environmental
sustainably.
4.2 Modularity
Generally, it is believed that a modular architecture of a product leads to a lower
level of waste production [12]. At the end of its life, a modular product can be
disassembled and the components can be used for disposal, reassembling, or
remanufacturing. Consequently, it is expected that modular products are more
environmentally friendly than those products with integrated architecture. Our data
analysis conﬁrms this claim since 58.18 % of respondents think that modularity
acts as driver to reduce waste. Nevertheless, the confusion is mainly related to how
modularity affects the level of energy consumption. Does a modular architecture
tends to reduce energy consumption to produce a new product since some modules
can be reused or reassembled at the end of life of the product or simply it does not
affect it at all? The result of data analysis demonstrates a non-clear response in this
regard. Respondents do not have a clear idea and are divided into two equally sized
groups: ﬁrst group believe that modularity reduces the level of energy consump-
tion and the second one does not take it as a driving force. However, the reason for
this confusion lies on the responses of MC academia experts. While majority of
practitioners believe modularity does not affect the level of energy consumption,
the academicians are still not sure about the possible impacts.
4.3 Postponement
Postponement, in any production process, is mainly considered as a way to
enhance standardization and hence efﬁciency of the production line. In such a way,
it helps a mass customizer to maintain a certain level of efﬁciency. On the other
hand, implementing postponement implies less customized processes and more
308
G. Pourabdollahian et al.

standard ones which might also lead to a change in the level of produced waste and
consumed energy, as well as the level of emission. Accordingly, postponement
should be seen as an enabler, which can enhance the sustainability performance in
terms of at least one of the three deﬁned KPIs. Surprisingly, based on the survey
results, the majority of participants do not consider any speciﬁc relationship
between postponement and sustainability. Nevertheless, postponement still is a
borderline enabler since the percentage of participants who believe it reduces the
level of sustainability is very close to those who take it as a neutral factor. Like the
previous cases of robust production process and modularity, such uncertainty
derives from academia respondents since the majority of participants from
companies did not assign any impact for postponement in terms of sustainability.
4.4 Delivery at Point of Sale
Customized products can be delivered to customers via physical stores or online
channels. In the case of physical stores, where customers go to the store to cus-
tomize and order their individualized product, the ﬁnal product can be delivered to
them at the point of sale. The fact that which type of channel is more eco-friendly
is still an issue of debate and doubt. The survey results reveal that the challenge is
mainly related to understand how delivery at point of sale affects the level of
emission. The distribution of answers reveals two different directions for academia
and industry. MC companies believe that delivery at point of sale either increases
or does not affect the level of emission. On a completely different direction, MC
experts think either it reduces or it does not affect the emission. Such a clear
difference of opinion between two groups necessitates a further analysis of this
enabler while conﬁguring a SMC business model.
5 Conclusion
From its emergence as a trend, MC has been extensively discussed as a proper and
potential business model for heterogeneous markets. In a market that is characterized
by high levels of heterogeneity in terms of customers’ requirements and needs, MC
can be considered as a win–win strategy that beneﬁts both customers and companies.
However, in recent years, the increasing sensitivity to the sustainability performance
of the companies is a big challenge for ﬁrms, and MC companies are not an
exception. In this paper, we tried to target this challenge by analyzing the environ-
mental impacts of a MC business model on footwear industry. The empirical study
was based on a data collection and analysis from MC experts in academia and MC
footwear companies. The results, however, bring into the light a part of challenges
and problems regarding mapping the potential impacts of MC on sustainability.
Although a proposal regarding the environmental impacts of several MC enablers on

309

three main sustainability KPI is presented in the paper, there are still doubts and
confusions revealed during data analysis. One of the challenges relates to some
critical MC enablers that their impact on sustainability KPIs is placed on a borderline
position and makes it very difﬁcult to decide about the real impact. In the case of
these enablers, we suggest a more detailed analysis since the result and impact might
vary from one company to the other. Another challenge derives from the huge gap
and difference of opinion between academia and industry. In the case of all critical
MC enablers, there was a discrepancy between academicians and practitioners. The
undeniable observation is that while academicians usually swing between two
possible sustainability impacts for MC enablers, practitioners from industry are more
concrete about how MC enablers affect sustainability. The revealed gap between
these two groups emphasizes again on the fact that how we see things in an academic
environment might be totally different from what happens in reality.

Living Lab Methodology as an Assessment
Tool for Mass Customization
Lynn Coorevits, Constantijn Seys and Dimitri Schuurman
Abstract Mass customization has been regularly used as a growth strategy during
the last decades. The strength of this approach stems from offering products adjusted
to customers’ individual needs, resulting in added value. The latter resides in the
word ‘custom,’ implying unique and utilitarian products allowing for self-expression
of the consumer. Researchers and practitioners however predominantly focused on
the company’s internal processes to optimize mass customization, often resulting in
market failure. As a response, a framework with ﬁve factors determining the success
of mass customization was developed. Additionally, Living Lab methodologies have
been used to improve innovation contexts that were too closed. This paper will ﬁll a
gap in the literature by demonstrating that the integration of the ﬁve-factor frame-
work in the Living Lab methodology is well suited to determine the possible success
or failure of a mass-customized product in the market by means of a single case study.

1 Introduction
Companies are investing signiﬁcant resources (time and money) in ﬁnding new
products or services that can create value. Ortt and van der Duin [1] deﬁne innovation
as making a new product or service where the ‘new’ can be distinguished as follows:

new to the market, the company, or technology. This clariﬁes that innovation is a
broad concept that can be tackled by using several approaches. In this paper, the
focus is on a speciﬁc strategy within innovation, namely mass customization.
Researchers and practitioners agree that involving users can increase the likelihood
of an innovation’s success in case of incremental innovation [1, 2]. The European
Living Lab movement goes even further and argues that innovation should be user-
driven, conducted in real-life environments, and involve different stakeholders [3].
They emerged from innovation contexts that were too closed, often resulting in failed
innovations attributed to the lack of end user involvement [4]. A user can be involved
in the different stages of the innovation process. The goal of this paper is to determine
the potential of the Living Lab approach that has been used in several B2C and B2B
innovations, combined with a mass customization framework as an assessment tool
[5] to evaluate the products’ potential success in the market and optimize
accordingly.
2 Mass Customization
Mass production has challenged companies to ﬁnd new market approaches [2].
One of these was to customize products for speciﬁc customer segments. Pine [6]
deﬁned mass customization as ‘developing, producing, marketing and delivering
affordable goods and services with enough variation and customization that nearly
everyone ﬁnds exactly what they want.’ The strategy behind it is aligning a
company’s products with customer needs. Customization can appear in different
degrees from no customization to full customization, varying predeﬁned elements,
parameters, etc. to choose from. The level of customization has to be adjusted to
the customers’ needs. To discover those needs, user research is recommended. In
the past, researchers have focused on the factors inﬂuencing companies to move
from mass production to mass customization [6] and the implementation of mass
customization in their strategy [7]. However, there is still a lack of research
focusing on the factors determining the success of a mass-customized product in
the market. Broekhuizen and Alsem [8] suggested a framework with ﬁve factors
impacting the success of a mass-customized product, but have not tested it yet.
This paper will try to ﬁll this gap, by testing the model, and as such the success of
the product, in a Living Lab environment, by means of an in-depth case study. The
ﬁve determining factors are the following:
1. Customer factors or understanding the customer needs. Companies should
analyze whether customers show a need for mass-customized products, meaning
whether they want to be involved and are willing to pay a premium price.
2. Product factors will inﬂuence the possibilities of mass customization. There are
four product factors impacting the success, namely the purchasing frequency,
the luxury level of the product, the visibility of the product, and the product
adaptability. Purchasing frequency gives the producers the option of learning
312
L. Coorevits et al.

from their customers, resulting in a learning relationship that will be difﬁcult to
establish for other suppliers. Luxury products are in nature more expensive and
will therefore be more likely to be customized than products that fulﬁll basic
needs [6]. Products being displayed publicly are more likely to offer variety in
product presentation, and customers will prefer products allowing for self-
expression. Finally, product adaptability impacts the costs for the company to
customize the product and as such the decision to do so.
3. The market factors exist out of two characteristics inﬂuencing the use of mass
customization, namely the current level of market variety (product proliferation
and competitor analysis) and the willingness and ability to adopt. When market
variety is high, customers are often confronted with an abundance of choices,
increasing the need for customized products. The higher the adoption level, the
higher the need for mass-customized products.
4. The industry factors also inﬂuence the likelihood of success, namely the growth
of production technology, e-commerce, and the growth of ﬂexible production
technology.
5. The organization should be capable of delivering the desired products or ser-
vices quickly, inexpensively, and via a convenient and enjoyable conﬁguration
process.
If these ﬁve factors are successful, a company can decide to switch to mass
customization and be effective in it. This framework will be researched in a Living
Lab environment in order to examine the research question, does a Living Lab
allow to grasp the ﬁve factors more efﬁciently and evaluate the potential of mass
customization?
3 Living Lab Methodology
Living Lab research is a state-of-the-art methodology aiming at the involvement of
end users in the innovation process. Living Labs are experimental platforms where
end users can be studied in their everyday context [9]. Living Labs confront
(potential) users with (prototypes or demonstrators of) products and/or services in
the innovation process [5]. This approach has three main advantages. First, it
assists in developing more context-speciﬁc insights on development and accep-
tance processes and especially the interaction between both. Second, these
experiments inform us about possible conditions for stimulating the societal and
economic embedding of technology. Third, embedding it in real-life situations
generates images of potential societal impacts of innovation [10]. Living Labs
illustrate that users not only initiate the process of innovation, but can dominate the
subsequent phases of product development as well [5]. Therefore, this method
seems appropriate to research the success factors of a mass-customized product.
Living Lab Methodology as an Assessment Tool for Mass Customization
313

Pierson and Lievens [11] identiﬁed ﬁve stages in the process conﬁguration of
Living Lab research. The case study follows those stages to test the possible success
of a (new) product going from full customization to tailored customization.
1. Contextualization is an exploratory phase. Different research methods are
applied to provide the required background and insights. The contextualization
allows us to deﬁne the selection criteria and proﬁles of end users.
2. Selection is the identiﬁcation and selection of users that will be involved in the
Living Lab research. In the selection phase, non-probability sampling is used,
such as maximum variation based on sociodemographic variables or criterion
sampling trying to understand the different factors and their conﬁguration.
3. Concretization is the initial measurement of the selected users before the
technology or service is introduced. Speciﬁc characteristics of the users are
measured such as their behavior and perception on the technology.
4. Implementation is the operationally running test phase of the Living Lab. There
are two major research methods being used: direct analysis by registering user
actions remotely (e.g., logging) or indirect analysis by researching the moti-
vations via focus groups, interviews, and self-reporting techniques.
5. Feedback happens at the end of the Living Lab. It exists out of an ex-post-
measurement detecting evolutions in the perception and attitudes toward the
introduced technology or service. Additionally, technological recommendations
are deduced from the implementation phase.
Each of those ﬁve stages allows the focus on different success factors, and
therefore, a Living Lab appears the most appropriate method to test the mass
customization framework and optimize the product of the case study, digital
signage content feeds, accordingly.
4 Methodology
The in-depth case study involves a company that recently launched an online
platform delivering digital signage content feeds. The idea came from the owners’
previous experience in the creation of fully customized content. The company
detected a common problem for all users, namely not knowing which content to
select. Therefore, they decided to offer more standardized quality content, useful in
various situations such as point of sale, point of wait, and point of transit and easy to
integrate in the existing content playlist. The aim of the study was to test the
readiness of the product for market launch in Benelux and optimize the product
accordingly. In this case study, we will look at the potential of using the Living Lab
methodology as a research tool for identifying the potential success of a mass-
customized product. Case studies can help to understand complex issues or add
strength to existing theories. Additionally, they are the most commonly used
method for researching technology adoption at an organizational level [12].
314
L. Coorevits et al.

Considering the mass customization model of Broekhuizen and Alsem [8] has not
been implemented in practice yet and the Living Lab method requires a natural
setting [4], a combination of both discussed frameworks seemed the most appro-
priate for this research. A Living Lab approach offers the possibility of iteratively
optimizing a product. After each step, the company involved can improve their
product, organization, strategy, etc. based on the results of the Living Lab building
block. Therefore, it appears to serve as a perfect tool to prepare for launching a
mass-customized product in the market. The different success factors of mass
customization were integrated in the building blocks of the Living Lab method-
ology. The table gives an overview of the different phases of the Living Lab
evaluating the different success factors of mass customization. This paper will only
discuss the ﬁrst three phases and its results because the Living Lab case is still in
progress.
The research ﬂow is visualized in Table 1.
4.1 Contextualization
During a start-up session, a ﬁrst scan of the market, the product, and the organization
was established. The value proposition canvas, a tool to detect the supposed added
value for your (future) customers, was ﬁlled in together with the supplier of digital
signage content feeds. The value proposition is created through usage of the product/
service, reduction in customer risks, or the efforts a customer has to make. The
concept of mass customization allows a company to integrate an extra value to the
customer by allowing them to personalize and conﬁgure their value package. In
other words, the customer is involved in the value creation process [13]. Addi-
tionally, the researchers conducted desk research to generate some ﬁrst impressions
on the product/market ﬁt by scanning the market, competitors, and its environment.
4.2 Selection
In B2B research, the importance of the market structure prevails [14], meaning the
different stakeholders and their potential to inﬂuence the product’s potential need
to be uncovered. Eight stakeholders were selected and interviewed, each varying in
their level of involvement with digital signage content, namely operational work
area, containing businesses and the wider environment [15]. This is a major dif-
ference with Living Lab research in a B2C environment where the focus is often
purely on the involvement of end users. The Table 2 shows the stakeholder model
for digital signage content.

4.3 Concretization
By organizing face-to-face interviews with these different stakeholders, located in
different areas of Belgium, we gained more in-depth knowledge of digital signage
content, its market, and customer needs.
5 Results
During the ﬁrst three phases of the Living Lab, an evaluation of the ﬁve factors of
the mass customization framework was established. In the contextualization phase,
the value proposition canvas and desk research showed that the digital signage
industry is in a mature stage when it comes to technology. There have been some
major advances in resolution, and costs have been reduced signiﬁcantly. As such,
most businesses can now afford the hardware for digital signage. Therefore, a next
important issue arises: designing an appealing and conveying message that
engages customers. Digital signage content providers will become more important
allowing for different levels of customization and delivering a design that ﬁts the
company’s image. The company being researched is capable of delivering that
desired content quickly, efﬁciently, and inexpensively by means of the content
feeds. Additionally, digital content is visible to a company’s customers and
requires the possibility to adapt it to the company’s wishes. Therefore, the need to
customize digital signage content arises. In other words, the industry, product, and
organization seem ready for mass customization. Nevertheless, the current Belgian
market variety seems limited compared to the world and consequently the market
might not be willing to accept the product yet. Additionally, the customer needs
are not clear for the Belgian market. Previous research has focused more on
international needs and less on region-speciﬁc needs. Insights into the Belgian
customers will be required. The results of the contextualization phase indicated the
need to interview different stakeholders in order to gain deeper understandings of
the market and customer needs.
When analyzing the concretization phase, we noticed that the new product has
its limitations. Although the product itself is perceived as attractive, efﬁcient, and
qualitative, it does not satisfy the customers’ needs completely. They show that the
product will have to offer more variety, and it appears too standardized on the
customization ladder. More parameters will have to be added to the current offer in
order to better fulﬁll customer needs. Additionally, the product does not ﬁt into the

Benelux market structure and value chain of digital signage. The market used to be
cluttered and is slowly consolidating, resulting in an interconnected market with
some bigger players. As some of the stakeholders perceive the product as an
intruder in the market, it will be hard for the company to launch the product. The
integration of the content feeds is not always supported by their hardware and
software, meaning it needs to move away from its current coding structure.
Additionally, customers buy their content together with their hardware and soft-
ware offered by system integrators, which makes it difﬁcult to operate as content
provider without integrating other services. In other words, the company will have
to fulﬁll more customer and system integrator needs, change the product and their
organizational strategy in order to make their product successful. The advantage of
iterating during the Living Lab before continuing the following steps appears to be
a useful strategy for the introduction of a mass-customized product in the market.
The results allowed the company to change course and optimize the product to
better suit its customers’ needs. In a next phase, the intervention phase, a business
workshop will be organized with the different stakeholders involved to optimize
the product even further and inﬂuence the market factors where possible. Addi-
tionally, the opportunity will arise to test whether the optimization was successful
and to decide upon their market and organizational strategy from there. In a
following stage, the feedback phase, a ﬁnal evaluation of the product will happen.
6 Conclusion
The results of this study imply a working method to identify the potential success
of a mass-customized product. Researchers and practitioners from different
industries can implement the Living Lab methodology to study the different
success criteria of a mass-customized product and iterate accordingly. It can be
applied for incremental as well as radical innovations. The mass customization
framework appears effective in analyzing the potential of a mass-customized
product, especially because it focuses on more than internal processes and addi-
tionally involves external factors such as the market and the customer. It allows
managers to use it as a structure to identify and found their strategy of mass
customization on. The advantage of using it in a Living Lab environment is the
possibility to iterate when the product does not appear market ready and to opti-
mize the different factors by involving a diversity of stakeholders in a real-life
environment. The involvement of multiple stakeholders and of the end users
allows for multiple perspectives and angles to be taken into account when eval-
uating the success factors. The framework contributes by structuring the Living
Lab approach even further. Both strengthen each other and the results of the
research.
Considering mass customization is a form of innovation, future research should
focus on the applicability of the framework within a Living Lab environment for
other sorts of innovations.
318
L. Coorevits et al.

Although only the prephase of the Living Lab was performed, we believe that
the next phases will only add value to the current results and allow for further
product optimization. Considering this research is work in progress, we will be
able to follow up on the potential of the other phases of the Living Lab and their
applicability in determining the success of a mass-customized product.
Performing user research within a B2B context is a challenge. The heteroge-
neity of businesses prevails, and as such, the selection process of users becomes
more difﬁcult. Therefore, the contextualization and selection phases of the Living
Lab become more important. Deﬁning the market structure with its different
stakeholders is a ﬁrst step in this process. If a mass-customized product will be
tested for the B2C market, the focus should be more on the end users compared to
multiple stakeholders. Previous Living Lab research has mainly focused on B2C
Living Labs, and as such, the ﬁndings of this Living Lab case can serve as input on
how to implement the Living Lab methodology in a B2B environment.

Managing Process Customisation
for the Capital Goods Sector:
An Application Case Study
Juan Manuel Besga, Juan Carlos Astiazaran and Patxi Zubizarreta
Abstract The capital goods sector is characterised by a limited number of large
orders with a high degree of customisation. This means neither products nor
processes are standardised, making it difﬁcult to accurately determine delivery
times, often resulting in non-fulﬁlment. This paper describes a conceptual model
used in a methodology for deﬁning a reliable production system regarding both
delivery times and cost, enabling companies to reach achievable commitments with
customers and improve their responsiveness to major changes in demand. This
model is based on deﬁning and scheduling generic assembly processes that can be
customised for each particular order. The description of the conceptual model is
illustrated by an application case study at a hydraulic presses manufacturer.

• Because products are not standard, the process is longer. Speciﬁc machine
design stage and an adjustment stage at the end of the machine assembly are
required, and the process is longer. Also, having no standard products means
component purchasing cannot be done before the orders arrive.
• Because processes are not standard, the delivery times are uncertain, and the
companies often fail to fulﬁl them.
In order to minimise the effects of the latter point, capital goods sector com-
panies need a reliable production system that will allow them to make and meet
achievable commitments to their customers. Companies would therefore be able to
fulﬁl these commitments with no risk of penalties, improving their market image
and controlling their operating margins.
Over the last few years, companies offering customised products and services
have begun to use mass customisation (MC) as a strategy for achieving a com-
petitive edge [1].
Concepts such as customer-driven, ﬂexible, lean manufacturing [2] and just-
in-time (JIT) manufacturing have appeared on the MC scene as strategies for
achieving efﬁciency levels close to those of mass production [3–5].
These productive approaches have been widely used by mass production
companies, but they have been of little use in high-variability/low-volume envi-
ronments such as the capital goods sector. It has even been questioned whether or
not lean manufacturing techniques should be used in these environments [6],
although there have been cases of application in custom manufacturing industries,
e.g. in the aerospace [7], naval [8] and machine tool [9] sectors.
Although the production approaches mentioned are not directly applicable to
the capital goods sector, some of their concepts, together with value stream
mapping (VSM) [10], a tool used in lean manufacturing to analyse the material and
information ﬂows required to make a product or service available to customers,
may be adapted and applied to deﬁning and implementing a reliable production
system for companies in this sector.
Taking these concepts into account (takt time, ﬂow, pull systems, etc.),
IK4-IKERLAN has developed a methodology for deﬁning a reliable production
system that will enable capital goods sector companies to make and meet
achievable commitments to their customers. The key component of this method-
ology is a conceptual model, presented in this paper, along with its application at a
stamping press manufacturing company.
The outline of this paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 describes the research
approach. In Sect. 3, some characteristics of capital goods sector are presented.
Sections 4 and 5 present the conceptual model on which the proposed production
system is based and the application case. In Sect. 6, some conclusions are pre-
sented. Finally, Sect. 7 sets out some future lines of work.

2 Research Approach
We present an application case study, based on the results of an applied research
project. This project resulted in the deﬁnition of a methodology for designing and
implementing a production system at capital goods sector companies that will
enable a regular assembly pace (takt time) and synchronising the other order cycle
activities (design, purchasing, etc.) with this pace.
This methodology was later applied at several capital goods sector companies,
to validate both the suitability of the methodology and the conceptual model
included in this methodology. This paper describes one of these application cases.
3 Sector Scenario
Projects at capital goods sector companies tend to be highly customised. This
makes it impossible to standardise products (except for commercial items and
auxiliary elements), as each product is new. As practically no stocking can be
done, purchasing lead times interferes with delivery times and project
planning.
Normally, project planning is not detailed enough, as there are no standard
processes (the projects are always different). Due to there is no a detailed
scheduling, the purchasing department does not know the exact date on which the
materials will be required, and the technical ofﬁce does not know the exact dates
on which designs will be required, so deadlines for obtaining project requirements
are not known either.
Also, when the machine assembly needs to be rescheduled for any reason
(problems with the current project and/or with other projects running in the
assembly plant), the initial planning is no longer valid and all dates should be
calculated again, which does not always happen, resulting in wrong information
being used and a total loss of control over what is occurring in each project and in
the shop ﬂoor.
The ‘push system’ is therefore used for project management, to forestall
problems whenever possible—the sooner the work is done, the better.
So, for the ﬁrst part of the project (requirements, design and initial purchasing),
there is no pressure, as regards delivery dates, as all those involved know, are
normally tentative, and the deadline pressure therefore shifts to the second part of
the project (assembly and adjustment stages), meaning overtime, pressure on
suppliers, extra costs due to rush deliveries, adjustment work done only partially or
not at all, assembly processes postponed until ﬁnal assembly at the customer’s
facilities, etc.
Managing Process Customisation for the Capital Goods Sector
323

4 Production System Proposed
It is true to say that it is not possible to fully standardise products and production
processes at capital goods sector companies, but easily customisable generic
products and processes can be deﬁned to a large extent, because, although all
projects may be different, many of them have similarities.
Taking this premise as a starting point and focusing on production processes,
the developed methodology is used to deﬁne a production system for predictably
and orderly assembling, adjusting and disassembling of machines, guaranteeing
the delivery deadlines, achieving a good capacity utilisation of productive
resources and working in accordance with the shop ﬂoor’s limitations.
The production system is based on a network of cells that is organised by
products, synchronised according to a particular pace (takt time), easy to schedule
and with guaranteed performance.
This system (Fig. 1) is deﬁned on the basis of a conceptual model with four
main blocks: generic processes, scheduling patterns, cells and ﬂows. Once the
information on these blocks has been deﬁned, for each project, depending on its
characteristics, the customised scheduling for the cells can be obtained, together
with the information required for the project monitoring and control.
Fig. 1 Production system
324
J. M. Besga et al.

4.1 Conceptual Model
The processes deﬁned in this conceptual model are generic and therefore are not
related to a speciﬁc machine but to an entire family of machines.
Each process (Fig. 2) consists of a set of phases or operations which need to be
carried out, predictably and following a sequence, established in a precedence
diagram, for assembling a component, assembling a machine, adjusting it, etc.
Each phase of a speciﬁc project will be carried out if its condition, deﬁned on the
basis of the machine’s characteristics, is fulﬁlled.
To carry out the projects, ﬁrst they must be scheduled. For quick and efﬁcient
scheduling, a set of scheduling patterns (Fig. 3) have been deﬁned, which can be
customised for each new project as required, so each machine does not have to be
scheduled from scratch.
Each pattern consists of one or more processes, with the detailed scheduling of
a part of a ‘mock’ machine, taking into account the most common values for the
characteristics of the machine, and the resources available (workers, number of
shifts) for carrying out the project, which will determine the pace (takt time).
A cell is a set of resources (workers, tools, etc.) work within a speciﬁc envi-
ronment and that are able to put a set of scheduling patterns into practice within a
guaranteed period of time. It is essential to guarantee the pace of each cell.
Therefore, decisions to minimise arising problems need to be taken, in order to
solve them by the deadline established, whenever possible. For this reason,
workers should not be given an excessive workload (below 85–90 %).
Fig. 2 Generic process
Managing Process Customisation for the Capital Goods Sector
325

Finally, deﬁne ﬂows involves dividing the shop ﬂoor layout into ‘assembly
lines’, according to the product mix expected to be sold in the next months or years.
An ‘assembly line’ is taken to mean a speciﬁc path where a set of cells, synchronised
according to the takt time, are used to assemble machines of a speciﬁc type.
4.2 Project Management
The project is scheduled by choosing suitable scheduling patterns. The pattern
scheduling is customised according to the machine characteristics for the project,
maintaining the phases required for the project, deleting those that do not form part
of it and scheduling any required phases that are not scheduled in the pattern.
Finally, the customised scheduling is adapted to the project, balancing the work-
load of assembly workers.
For project monitoring, the information required is prepared based on the
project scheduling and the shop ﬂoor planning. During assembly monitoring and
control, periodically (e.g. weekly), the fulﬁlment of each process phase is checked.
On the other hand, the detailed scheduling for each machine indicates which
materials, and when, are needed for assembling each module and the whole
machine. Knowing the materials’ delivery time, the deadline for order release is
known, and this will also be the deadline for completing the corresponding design.

5 Application Case
5.1 The Company: Product and Stages of a Project
The case study company is ONAPRES, one of the most important European
designers and manufacturers of hydraulic presses (Fig. 4). It custom-manufactures
all its presses for each customer, always considering their needs a top priority.
Recently, ONAPRES and FAGOR ARRASATE, a world leader in the design,
manufacturing and supply of presses and stamping systems, metal cutting and
processing lines, have announced the full merge of their activities creating together
the company worldwide with the broadest catalogue of solutions for the sheet
metal forming and processing sectors.
Concerning product families, its highest percentage of sales is in modular frame
presses, followed by monoblock presses. Other press families (column presses, hot
drape forming machines, special presses) represent only a minor percentage. We
therefore chose the modular frame and monoblock press families for the case
study. The major modules for both types of presses are shown in Table 1.

The stages of a typical project for this company are as follows:
• When the order is placed, the company’s technical manager gathers all order
requirements, with collaboration from the commercial department.
• The technical ofﬁce creates all the press designs (mechanical, hydraulic,
pneumatic, lubrication, electrical, PLC programs, etc.).
• At the purchasing stage, the purchasing department converts the completed
designs into material requirements and places purchase orders.
• Suppliers deliver materials to the assembly plant.
• Main press units or modules are then assembled.
• When all modules are ﬁnished, the whole press is assembled.
• PLC programs, user interface, etc. are loaded, and the adjustment is made.
• The press is disassembled, and the modules are painted and packaged.
• The modules are dispatched and transported to the customer’s facilities.
• The press is assembled again at the customer’s facilities and started up.
5.2 Model Deﬁned
In this case, it has been deﬁned 19 generic processes and 17 scheduling patterns,
for the modules’ assembly, press assembly, adjustment and disassembly, and
painting and packaging, with 125 characteristics for customising processes. These
processes and patterns are grouped according to the type of modules and presses.
Table 2 shows the relationship between them (in parentheses, the number of
processes or patterns for each group and the average number of phases or oper-
ations for each one).
Also, it has been deﬁned four types of cells. Each one can perform one type of
scheduling patterns (B, C, PA&A and DP&P) and requires a certain space to
perform its tasks. In this case, in the shop ﬂoor, there are 6 assembly areas for
heavy modules (‘H’) and 9 assembly areas for light modules (‘L’). There is also a
pit in which 3 presses can be assembled simultaneously. The cells have been
conﬁgured as shown in Table 3.

Taking into account the areas needed by each cell, the layout of the shop ﬂoor is
organised in two assembly lines.
Finally, organise ﬂows, as said before, consist in select the set of cells needed to
carry out each project and place these cells into an assembly line. In Fig. 5, as an
example, several modular presses have been distributed (synchronised) into the
two assembly lines deﬁned.
For the synchronisation of presses in the different assembly lines, the bottleneck
must be taken into account. In this case, the bottleneck occurs during the disas-
sembly of modular frame presses, due to the assembly areas occupied; thus, the
presses have been arranged so that two disassembly processes never take place at
the same time.

6 Results
In the application case, presented in this paper, the current situation was diagnosed
before deﬁning the model. Eight presses were manufactured at the plant in 2011
(six modular frame presses and two monoblock presses), with the shop ﬂoor
working at practically full capacity. Once the model was established, depending on
the product mix, it was concluded that 10 modular frame presses or nine modular
frame presses and two monoblock presses could be assembled per year. It has been
estimated an increase in productivity between 25 and 37 %.
7 Conclusions
In this paper, we have presented an application case study for a methodology that
focuses on the design and implementation of a reliable production system that will
enable capital goods sector companies to make and meet achievable commitments
to their customers.
Deﬁning a reliable production system using the methodology presented in this
paper has the following advantages:
• It facilitates assembly management as detailed scheduling is obtained quickly
and easily. The detailed scheduling of the project allows workers to know the
tasks they have to perform each day and allows project manager to control
accurately the progress of the project.
• It enables maximum productivity to be obtained from the shop ﬂoor, optimising
bottlenecks.
• It provides an overview of the whole assembly plant.
• It allows sales agents to provide more accurate delivery dates, based on prior
knowledge about whether or not the shop ﬂoor can respond.
• It guarantees deadlines promised to the customer, eliminating penalties due to
delays.
• It shortens deadlines, enhancing the appeal of the commercial offer.
8 Future Research Lines
In the case study presented above, the methodology focused on assembly processes.
The next step would be to extend the application to other connected stages of the
order cycle such as purchasing and design, so that they are synchronised with
the assembly stage and so that assembly requirements, scheduled according to
delivery dates, determine the dates on which the work needs to be done for that
stages, i.e. a ‘pull system’, with the assembly stage ‘pulling’ the previous stages.
Managing Process Customisation for the Capital Goods Sector
331

On the other hand, developing a support tool for the methodology to facilitate
the tasks of deﬁning and updating information about the blocks of the model would
be a signiﬁcant improvement at both the model deﬁnition stage and that of
production system operation.

Mass Customization and Performance
Assessment: Overview and Research
Directions
Simon Haahr Storbjerg, Thomas D. Brunoe and Kjeld Nielsen
Abstract Mass customization (MC) has been introduced as the future of manu-
facturing, and great results have been proven. Recent research, however, docu-
ments a high failure rate for companies trying to adapt to MC as a business
strategy. Making this transition is, as highlighted by several scholars, an enterprise
transformation that requires strategic control mechanisms. This paper contributes
to existing MC literature with an overview and analysis of available MC perfor-
mance assessment methods. Shortcomings of the literature are identiﬁed and
directions for future research given.

1 Introduction
Based on the increased demand for product customization and intensiﬁed com-
petition, manufacturing companies today are required more than ever to deliver
product variants in an efﬁcient manner. Mass customization (MC) is a concept and
operation strategy embracing different strategies for delivering products that meet
individual customers’ needs with near mass production efﬁciency.

MC arose as a concept in the late 1980s and was popularized in the early 1990s
[26]. The concept has been adopted by industry for years, and the body of
knowledge on MC has simultaneously grown. A recent study of 500 ﬁrms reports,
however, a high failure rate at implementing MC, both for company start-ups and
established ﬁrms. The reasons for this high failure rate are many, pointing in
different directions and at different levels.
Research has for years focused on clarifying the fundamental or deﬁning
characteristics of ﬁrms that successfully adopt the MC strategy. Among other
things, this has led to the introduction of three fundamental MC capabilities:
solution space development, robust process design, and choice navigation [28].
Several researchers, e.g. [10, 19, 31] have adopted the three fundamental capa-
bilities and continued this line of research, supporting that a more comprehensive
understanding of which characterises constitute a successful mass customizer can
be developed.
The transition toward MC is as highlighted by several authors, among others
Salvador et al. [28], not an isolated activity; it is an enterprise comprising a wide
continuous innovation effort involving both radical change and continuous
improvement. From this, it is clear that focusing on what characterizes a successful
mass customizer is not sufﬁcient guidance for companies to ensure a successful
transition. Based on this, we argue that one of the central reasons for the high
failure rate in industry is a shortcoming of theory in giving adequate guidance for
companies in how to undertake the organizational transition. Many MC
researchers have also clearly stated the need for more research addressing the
managerial aspects of MC, e.g., [16, 28]. The research on MC has only recently
given increased attention to providing knowledge about how to undertake and
support the transition toward MC.
The relation between success of improvement in a change process and use of
performance measurement and management has been documented in several
cases. One example is Kristal et al. [16], who, through data investigation from 167
mid- to large-sized manufacturing plants, prove that the use of feedback infor-
mation favorably contributes to the development of MC capability. Based on these
results, Kristal et al. [16] argue that continuous improvement and performance
assessment are key elements for addressing the issue of ensuring a successful MC
implementation. Throughout the last decade, the use of performance assessment
has gained increasing attention within MC research, e.g., [4, 8, 23, 29] to mention
some of the later contributions.
The literature on assessing organizational performance has in general split into
two main streams. One stream focuses on metrics, performance measures, per-
formance measurement systems, and approaches to performance management,
e.g., [11]. The other stream of the literature, which is primarily found within
quality management literature, focuses more on the use of capability maturity
frameworks in the assessment of organizational capabilities, e.g., [20].
Based on a coarse literature review in [29], we argue that research on MC
seems to speak much about capabilities but little about how to measure them. MC
literature addressing performance assessment appears to be unilateral, focusing
334
S. H. Storbjerg et al.

mostly on performance metrics. Furthermore, the literature offers only a scarce
overview of how performance assessment has been addressed within the MC
domain. In order to ensure progression on this topic and ultimately to ensure that
relevant tools and methods can be developed for guiding companies in their
transition toward MC, we see a need for giving an overview of MC research
addressing performance assessment.
The purpose of this paper is to review the literature addressing performance
assessment within MC, clarify focus, evaluate ability to give relevant feedback
information in the organizational change process of implementing MC, identify
potential gaps, and, based on this, give direction for future research. The research
questions have been framed as follows:
• RQ1: What performance assessment methodologies are available within the
domain of MC?
• RQ2: What is the capability of available performance assessment methods in
giving guidance to companies in the transition toward MC?
To answer research question 1, the central dimensions along which the avail-
able methods are reviewed are introduced in the following section. Based on these,
the literature on performance assessment within MC is reviewed in Sect. 3, and, in
order to answer research question 2, performance assessment methods are ana-
lyzed with a focus on their ability to support the transition toward MC. In closure,
the results are discussed, the gap in the current literature is identiﬁed, and direc-
tions for future research are given.
2 Performance Assessment
In order to provide a valuable overview of the existing literature, a general frame for
classifying research on performance assessment is needed. Based on this, the pur-
pose of the following section is to clarify along which dimensions the literature has
to be reviewed by looking into the general literature on performance assessment.
It has long been recognized that performance assessment plays an important
role in the efﬁcient and effective management of organizations [15]. This topic has,
as recognized by Folan and Browne [11], among others, also gained focus in an
ever-increasing number of academic ﬁelds. Research on performance assessment
was initiated in management accounting at the beginning of the twentieth century,
and it later gained a broader role in non-ﬁnancial disciplines, such as operations
management, marketing, and human resource management [6]. Organizational
performance is by no means a simple phenomenon; rather, it is a complex and
multidimensional concept. The purpose of conducting performance assessment is
to achieve [21] ‘‘closed-loop deployment of organizational strategies, allowing
relevant information to feed back to the appropriate points facilitating decision and
control processes.’’
Mass Customization and Performance Assessment
335

Assessment of organizational performance has split into two main streams in
the literature, providing a relevant dimension for initial classiﬁcation. One stream
focuses on metrics, including performance measures or performance measurement
systems. In this stream, performance is typically measured using a quantitative
approach and is expressed in ﬁgures or by the use of an index, etc. The other
stream focuses more on the assessment of organizational capabilities, e.g., through
the use of capability maturity frameworks. In this stream, performance is typically
evaluated using qualitative approaches.
Another relevant dimension in analyzing the literature on performance
assessment is given by Folan and Browne [11], who, based on an extensive lit-
erature review, argue that the research on performance measurement gives rec-
ommendations on four different levels or dimensions:
1. Individual performance measures.
2. Structural frameworks (set of performance measures).
3. Procedural frameworks (process of building performance measures systems).
4. Performance measurement systems (the integration of the above points).
‘‘Structural performance framework’’ refers to the set of recommendations,
boundaries, dimensions, and relations in between the measures [11]. In addition,
performance systems provide guidance for the employment of performance
frameworks or particular sets of performance measures. Although the split
between the literature addressing performance assessment as individual metrics,
measurement frameworks, and measurement systems is only developed within
performance measurement, we also ﬁnd it to be highly relevant within capability
assessment.
Based on these two dimensions, the framework depicted in Fig. 1 has been
developed for use in the assessment of the available methods.
In addition to the two dimensions depicted in Fig. 1, it is relevant to address the
scope of the method, i.e., which of the fundamental capabilities the method gives
performance feedback to. Based on this, the literature is reviewed according to the
following questions:
• What is the purpose of the method?
• Which type of performance assessment does the method build on?
• At what level are recommendations given?
• In what way is the suggested method given guidance in the transition?
• To which of the fundamental capabilities is the method relevant?
3 Mass Customization and Performance Assessment
With the use of the framework clariﬁed above, the central literature on perfor-
mance assessment within MC is reviewed in the following. The literature review is
done on the basis of an extensive search primarily using the Web of Science
336
S. H. Storbjerg et al.

database. Combined title and topic searches have been conducted using combi-
nations of the keywords: mass customization, measures, metric, capability
assessment, performance, performance assessment, and performance management.
In addition to title and topic search, forward and backward search methods have
been utilized. In total, 159 contributions have been found, which have been nar-
rowed down to 21 papers by assessing against the following criteria: (1) giving
recommendation for methods or approaches at performance assessment; (2)
encompassing performance assessment by quantitative performance measures or
assessment of organizational capabilities; and (3) addressing MC-speciﬁc
challenges.
3.1 Performance Measurement Methodologies
The majority of the literature on performance assessment and MC applies a per-
formance measurement perspective. From the literature review, 17 contributions
and 11 methods have been identiﬁed, which are reviewed in the following:
• Blecker and Abdelkaﬁ[2]: The purpose of the proposed method is to support
companies in achieving a higher component commonality, thereby making MC
work more efﬁciently. The proposed method enables evaluation of the overall
commonality of a product family by using the total commonality index (TCI),
which is an expression of the extent to which the variations of a product family
can be produced around the same components. The metric indicates how well
the company performs in relation to the product family design and the variety-
induced complexity on the shop ﬂoor. No indications are given, however, of the
appropriate level of TCI, though the authors suggest that benchmarking the

index with the best in the industry could contribute in highlighting potential
opportunities for improving product designs/redesigns.
• Blecker et al. [3]: In order to ensure well-founded variety creation decisions in
MC, Blecker et al. introduce a key metric system for variety steering. The
purpose of this method is to assess how well the company performs in gearing
the product variety toward customers’ real needs and managing the internal
complexity level. The system, which is one of the most comprehensive of its
kind, encompasses 32 key metrics, or KPIs, in total, which all indicate whether
certain capabilities have been implemented.
• Bonev and Hvam [4]: The purpose of the proposed evaluation method is to
initially give an assessment of the performance of ETO companies moving
toward MC. The method builds on performance measurement of ﬁnancial
measures combined with a qualitative analysis of operational performance. The
method introduces a procedural framework outlining four phases. It is con-
ceptually described and addresses performance at a high level; the output of the
measurement is thus only determined through additional qualitative analysis
relying on subjective interpretation related to which capabilities need to be
focused on in order to improve performance.
• Cormier et al. [7]: Cormier’s proposed method aims at assessing the ﬂexibility
of a design in the early stages of the design process to ensure a sound product
family design. The method proposes a set of metrics that uses early design
information to evaluate the ﬂexibility of proposed product architectures in the
early stages of the design process. The method primarily gives recommenda-
tions about which metrics to utilize and measures only product-related aspects.
• Daaboul et al. [8, 9]: The purpose of the extended value network method is to
evaluate MC strategies by supporting companies in the decision of whether to
implement MC or not, and how better to implement it. The purpose of the
method is more precisely to support in decisions regarding product and process
variety, taking into account the impact on the perceived value for the customer.
The method works as a decision-aiding system, allowing comparison of different
alternatives for decisions on product and process variety. The method builds on
a performance measurement system that assigns value based on 17 performance
parameters and 6 main performance indicators, which are introduced in a
framework together with a procedure for implementation and simulation.
• Fogliatto et al. [10]: The purpose of the method proposed by Fogliatto is to
indicate MC feasibility and point at areas of the operations that require major
improvements in ﬂexibility to deliver products satisfying customer require-
ments; this is achieved by identifying gaps between customer demand and
product and process performance. The measurement is implemented through the
application of the Quality Function Deployment matrix. Recommendations are
given mainly on how to compute the measurement, as the method is described at
a rather conceptual level. The method thus does not offer guidance in what
metrics to utilize, how to capture and describe customer requirements, etc.
Furthermore, a way to translate the results so that areas for improvement are
indicated is not described.
338
S. H. Storbjerg et al.

• Gero and Sosa [12]: The method proposed by Gero involves supporting the
design process in generating a higher variety of solutions by assessing the
complexity of the design space through complexity measures. The focus of this
measurement is solely on the product aiming to maximize the solution space
offered; the method does not take customer demand or process impact, perfor-
mance or capabilities into consideration. Furthermore, the method is only
applicable to MC strategies aiming at generating novel solutions, i.e., ones that
use parametric or algorithmic solutions to yield a high degree of customization.
• Jiao and Tseng [13]: The purpose of the method proposed by Jiao and Tseng
[13] is to measure the customizability of design, i.e., the cost-effectiveness of a
design to be customized in order to meet individual customer needs. The aim is
to maximize customer-perceived value by exploiting the potential of design to
be customized. The performance assessment is mainly done through individual
metrics, which is also the main focus of the recommendations given; some
instruction is also given regarding how to conduct the customizability analysis;
recommendations are given, however, at a rather conceptual level.
• Jiao and Tseng [14]: The purpose of this proposed method is to support com-
panies in product family decisions, taking internal complexity and external
variety into consideration. Jiao proposes two commonality measurements, a
component part and a process commonality index, that can support companies in
understanding and evaluating the product family. The proposed metrics can
support the analysis of whether or not a product family is adequately designed.
However, the method does not offer translation of the output of the measure-
ment, nor indications of expected level, e.g., being ready for MC.
• Kumar [18]: Similar to the method proposed by Blecker et al. [3], the purpose of
the method proposed by Kumar [18] is to support companies in variety decisions
to help them ﬁnd the optimal combination of MC and mass production strate-
gies. Kumar [18] introduces a number of new metrics that measure the ‘‘mass’’
as well as the ‘‘customization’’ aspects of this strategy. The metrics focus on
aspects such as modularity, customization degree, and level of exploitation of
economy of scale. Recommendations are mainly given about which metrics to
use, not the relations between them or how to deploy them to improve solution
space capabilities.
• Nielsen and Brunoe [22]: The purpose of this proposed method, which is based
on work in four earlier contributions [5, 23–25], is to provide information on a
company’s performance as a mass customizer in order to focus the improvement
effort; this is done by assessing the three fundamental MC capabilities. A
number of metrics are introduced relating to each of the three capabilities, and
two and six additional metrics are proposed for solution space assessment and
process robustness, respectively. The three fundamental capabilities are assessed
indirectly by linking the predeﬁned metrics to the capabilities through a rela-
tionship matrix.
Based on the review of the contributions above, utilizing a performance mea-
surement perspective in the MC performance assessment, it is revealed that the
Mass Customization and Performance Assessment
339

methods proposed by Blecker and Abdelkaﬁ[2], Cormier et al. [7], Gero and Sosa
[12], Jiao and Tseng [13], Jiao and Tseng [14], Kumar [18], and thus the great
majority focus solely on supporting decisions regarding solution space develop-
ment. A sound product family design is also pivotal for the success of MC, and
having metrics supporting decisions about the product family is thus crucial.
However, as the focus of these methods is only on assessing the attributes of the
product with the aim of developing solution space capabilities, process perfor-
mance and capabilities are, in most cases, not taken into consideration. If attention
is given to process capabilities, it is only in trade-off decisions, assessing the
impact of design decisions on process performance. These methods are due to the
narrow focus, believed to offer limited guidance in the transition toward MC.
Another shortcoming of many of the proposed methods, such as [4, 7, 10, 12,
and 13], is that the methods are only conceptually described and need further
development before they can be implemented in industry to give mass customizers
guidance in their transition toward MC.
For all of the methods utilizing a performance measurement perspective, a
further shortcoming is that the methods in focusing at performance measurement
do not make sure to translate or relate the results to organizational challenges.
Only the methods proposed by Daaboul et al. [8], Nielsen and Brunoe [22] attempt
to some extent doing this. Consequently, in order for the methods reviewed to be
able to support the transition toward MC with adequate guidance, these methods
need to be further developed, so that the methods more consistently and thor-
oughly point out areas and capabilities for improvement.
3.2 Capability Assessment Methodologies
Only three out of the 21 contributions give methods for assessing capabilities, not
including the methods with a combined focus, which are reviewed in the following
section.
• Berman [1]: The purpose of the assessment method introduced by Berman [1] is
to assess a company’s readiness to adopt an MC strategy. The method builds on
a capability assessment made by using a vertical audit against 21 checkpoints.
The method only gives recommendations about which assessment points should
be utilized, and no guidance is given on the relationship between measurements
or the translation of the results.
• Tu et al. [30]: The proposed method is to measure the level of modularity-based
manufacturing practices and their impact on MC capability. The method aims at
ensuring that the necessary organizational capabilities within manufacturing
leading to customization are implemented. The capability assessment method
gives recommendations for 15 items or capabilities to be used as individual
measurements, and a framework connecting the capabilities is introduced.
Having knowledge about the capabilities of manufacturing practices and their
340
S. H. Storbjerg et al.

impact on MC capability is deﬁnitely valuable in the transition toward MC.
Modularity-based practices are one of the primary means of achieving MC
capability.
• Pishdad and Taghiyareh [27]: The purpose of this proposed method is to support
management with information on organizational readiness for MC by letting
managers utilize their knowledge and understanding of the ﬁrm to develop a
proﬁle of the company before committing to an MC plan. The methods build on
capability assessment and introduce a capability framework consisting of 26
capabilities or factors that are used in assessment by appointing scores from
either a 3-, 5-, or 8-point scale. However, no guidance is given regarding how to
assess the performance of each of the factors, no goals or benchmark items are
introduced, and the assignment of scores is thus based on subjective input,
which reduces the reliability of the result. In addition, the relationship between
the measurements is not described.
A shortcoming to highlight that is common in each of the three methods is that
the performance assessment alone builds on either management’s subjective input
or acquiring input from the organization. Performance is not quantiﬁed, e.g., by
performance measures giving operational or ﬁnancial ﬁgures, which makes the
performance of MC harder to quantify. Another shortcoming of the proposed
method by Tu et al. [30], in relation to giving feedback in the transition toward
MC, is that the method, by focusing on the manufacturing processes, is limited in
scope, as assessment is done only on the three fundamental capabilities.
A third shortcoming of the proposed methods is that the methods proposed by
Pishdad and Taghiyareh [27] and Berman [1] only offer guidance to companies
that are in the consideration or planning stages of implementing an MC strategy.
This makes the proposed method based on this lack valuable information in the
transition toward MC.
3.3 Combined Assessment Methodologies
In contrast to the great majority of contributions on performance assessment within
MC, the following two methods apply a more holistic view of performance
assessment, taking both performance measurement and capability assessment into
perspective.
• Kumar and Stecke [17]: The performance assessment method introduced by
Kumar [18] aims to determine the effectiveness of a ﬁrm’s MC strategy, i.e., the
extent to which a company’s MC and personalization strategy has been effective
in enhancing a company’s strategic advantage. This method relies on perfor-
mance measurement and capability assessment combined in a computational
index called an MC and personalization effectiveness index (MCPEI). Recom-
mendations are given at the individual, structural, procedural, and systemic
levels. The method gives recommendations for three compound measurements
Mass Customization and Performance Assessment
341

or components of the MCPEI: a market-based measurement that gives the
market’s perception of effectiveness, a capability-based measurement based on
the company’s capabilities, and a combined measurement of the two
components.
• Storbjerg et al. [29]: The purpose of the method proposed by Storbjerg and
Nielsen is to support companies that are aiming to implement or improve their
choice navigation capabilities, with performance assessment supporting the
change process. Building on theory and a model from continuous improvement
theory, the method combines measurement of performance with capability
assessment. These two forms of measurement are introduced as constructs in a
framework and as related to the success of MC. Besides the framework, the
method only gives recommendations for general performance assessment
methodologies.
The method proposed by Kumar and Stecke [17] enables a company to assess
the effectiveness of its strategy. Furthermore, the index enables benchmarking with
other companies to give input on best practice, and the method is based on this,
considered to be relevant in giving valuable information in the transition toward
MC. However, two drawbacks can be identiﬁed from the suggested approach.
First, the capability assessment is based on a limited set of capabilities, making the
assessment narrow in scope. Second, the suggested approach for assessing the
capabilities is a subjective evaluation by the management team, which gives the
data needed for calculating the index by assigning a score from 1 to 10. This
signiﬁcantly reduces the reliability of the result of the measurement and reduces its
usability for benchmarking.
On a conceptual level, the method proposed by Storbjerg et al. [29] is also
considered relevant for providing information for the transition toward MC.
However, recommendations at a conceptual level are not sufﬁcient, and the method
is thus not considered adequate in present form for giving feedback to companies
in their transition toward MC. Another shortcoming of the method is that it focuses
only on one of the fundamental capabilities, choice navigation, which makes it
narrow in scope.
In summary, 21 contributions have been reviewed, from which 16 performance
assessment methods have been analyzed. Based on the analysis, ﬁve shortcomings,
common to some or several of the methods, have been identiﬁed. The methods are
as follows:
1. Narrow in scope, not supporting the full set of capabilities highlighted in the
literature as necessary for a successful transition to MC.
2. Narrow in purpose, only supporting the decision about adopting an MC strat-
egy, not the deployment of the strategy.
3. Not operational or possible to implement, as the methods are only conceptually
described and do not give recommendations at all levels, i.e., individual,
framework, and system levels.
4. Product focused, only offering support for decisions about variety steering.
342
S. H. Storbjerg et al.

5. Unilateral in assessment, either metric focused or capability focused. No
translation of performance results in capabilities and capability areas that need
to be improved, and vice versa.
Based on the shortcomings identiﬁed through the analysis, none of the available
methods have been assessed as fully capable of giving feedback information to the
change process toward MC. The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 1,
which also includes the ﬁve general shortcomings identiﬁed.
4 Discussion
Based on the results of the analysis, an obvious question for discussion is whether
the aim should be to develop one method capable of supporting the wide-ranging
and complex needs of supporting the change process of implementing a MC
strategy. One dimension within this line of discussion is whether there, at all, is a
need for having a method both giving input on MC performance in quantitative
terms by performance measurements, e.g., ﬁnancial measures, and in qualitative
terms by capability assessments. The two approaches each have their beneﬁts;
performance measurement enables, if properly designed, clear indications of the
output performance of processes, which leaves out discussions of, in this case, the
success of the MC strategy. However, performance measures do not work effec-
tively in pointing out the causes for the performance level. At best, areas or
functions contributing positively or negatively to the performance level are indi-
cated. This leaves management unanswered on what to do in order to improve
performance. Furthermore, many of the performance measurement methods tend
to express the output performance and thus work as lag indicators. In contrast,
capability assessment enables early indications of the output performance and can
as such work as lead indicators. In addition to this, some capability assessment
methodologies, as highlighted in [20], [29], enable not only assessment of per-
formance, i.e., capability or maturity level, but also give guidance in which
activities should be put in place to achieve a higher performance level. We argue
based on this that MC performance assessment, given the fundamental nature of
performance measurement and capability assessment, respectively, needs to
address both elements in order to give adequate guidance in the change process of
implementing MC.
Another dimension to discuss in relation to the prior question is whether it is
practical or even necessary to have one method covering the broad nature of MC
capabilities. Building on that, in order to become a successful mass customizer, a
company needs to develop all three capabilities; we argue based on this that a
comprehensive performance assessment method is needed.
Another relevant dimension to discuss in relation to the initial question is how
big a drawback having performance assessment methods that do not give rec-
ommendations for how to conduct assessment on all the levels earlier discussed is,

e.g., methods that only give guidance on a metric level. Having a method giving
only the metrics to be utilized leaves the user with a larger implementation and
interpretation task. Similarly, having a method that only gives recommendations at
a framework level leaves the user with a huge task in developing the method, e.g.,
clarifying relevant measurements or checkpoints. We thus argue that a method
needs to give recommendations at all levels in order to give proper guidance.
Finally, it is worth discussing whether it is relevant, considering the broadness
of the available MC strategies, to develop a generic MC performance assessment
methodology. This discussion has been initiated by Blecker and Abdelkaﬁ[2],
who, based on the fact that there is not only one way to achieve MC, highlight the
challenge of setting up a general assessment method. One way of dealing with this
challenge is to build certain ﬂexibility into the performance assessment methods,
such as by suggesting different metrics, capabilities, and capability areas for the
different levels of customization proposed by Daaboul et al. [9].
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we give an overview of the literature addressing performance
assessment within MC. Focus, level of recommendation, and relevance of the
available methods for the fundamental capabilities of MC are evaluated. Based on
this, the ability of the methods to give relevant feedback information in the
organizational change process of implementing MC is evaluated.
Based on an extensive search of the literature within MC addressing perfor-
mance assessment, more than 150 contributions have been identiﬁed. By
reviewing the general literature on performance assessment, relevant points for
classiﬁcation and evaluation have been identiﬁed, and a framework for review has
been developed.
By a thorough review of 21 contributions, it is concluded that the dominating
perspective in the literature on performance assessment is a performance mea-
surement perspective; only 5 out of 21 contributions address how to assess
capabilities. It is furthermore concluded that the great majority only covers one
dimension; only two contributions attempt to bridge the assessment of perfor-
mance and capabilities
With 16 out of 21 contributions on topics related to variety steering, the
majority of methods attempt to support development of solution space capabilities.
In contrast, only six methods attempt to address assessment of the choice navi-
gation capabilities.
Furthermore, it can be concluded based on the analysis that only a limited
number of the available methods aim at assessing performance more broadly,
covering all the fundamental capabilities.
Based on the analysis, ﬁve more general shortcomings, common to some or
several of the methods, have been identiﬁed. Based on the shortcomings identiﬁed,
Mass Customization and Performance Assessment
345

none of the available methods have been assessed as fully capable of giving
feedback information to the change process of MC.
None of the proposed methods have treated the task of proposing a framework
as a design task, clarifying requirements, proposing different solutions for the
requirements, selecting the best-ﬁtting solution, and testing the method. We see
this as a clear avenue of future research; a sound start would be to clarify general
requirements for performance assessment from both change management literature
and potential users in industry. From this starting point, a further potential area for
future research is to develop a more holistic performance assessment system
building on both measurement of performance and capability assessment.

Mass Customization as Innovation Driver
of International Competitiveness
in Peripheral Regional SME
Subcontractors
Stig B. Taps, Thomas D. Brunoe, Kjeld Nielsen
and Kaj A. Joergensen
Abstract The manufacturing literature has for long been occupied with the
linking of manufacturing capabilities with the competitive advantages of the
company. The dominant manufacturing content approach is concerned with
the consistent set of decisions about process technology design and organizational
practices that can be exploited as competitive capabilities. This paper suggests that
an open network structure demands a transformation of peripheral-located SME
subcontractor from traditional customized producer to mass customized producer.
Mass customization as an instrument for the transformation process consisting of
practical tools on many different company levels will comply with the challenges
the international competition charts.

The driver in the changing process is the dominant economic price paradigm
where efﬁciency in all parts of manufacturing operation is believed to obtain cost
advantages as core competence for sustainable competitiveness.
The increasing global hostile battleﬁeld on cost advantages has recently been
enlarged by incumbent companies desperately seeking proﬁt opportunities by
moving their cost curve from established market to developing markets such as
China, India, and similar. The consequences for small and medium enterprise
(SME)-sized manufacturing companies located in peripheral region might be
dramatic.
The larger manufacturing companies steadily seek location advantages outside
peripheral regions leaving the SME without their traditional supply chain liveli-
hood. The traditional competitive advantage of subcontractors based on efﬁciency
and control runs out of advantages.
Their customers constantly redesign their supply chain from a closed integrated
whole to an open international network structure leaving the subcontractors in a
global battleﬁeld of creativity, ﬂexibility, and timing. Because integration will tend
to exclude integrated units from interaction with the broader set of potential users,
producers accommodate companies that are seeking new organizational forms in
loose-coupled networks without trammels. In the integrated supply chain, the
competitive advantage as a whole is critical. In an open network structure, every
single part of the supply chain is challenged by competitors with the same focus on
each productive element [1]. Dynamic capabilities [15] are demanding by the
modern manufacturing company which by itself can be viewed as a dynamic
community, focusing on the modularity of companies’ resources, the processes by
which these resources are dynamically reconﬁgured as markets and company
players coevolved [5].
In an open and ﬂexible knowledge, network competitive advantages are not any
longer bound to traditional parameters as efﬁciency, control, and cost. Such
parameters are qualiﬁers [7] in the international competition, whereas learning to
construct innovation capabilities becomes the future order winners.
This paper argues that in peripheral regions, the challenge for SME subcon-
tractor is the transformation from traditional efﬁciency supplier to open innovation
agency. This transformation process has several dimensions. One important is the
solution space the product portfolio encompasses. Enabled by technologies such as
computerization, internet, product modularity, process ﬂexibility, the solution
space of the subcontractors’ product offering accommodates the challenges in an
open network structure.
We have organized the paper in three sections. The ﬁrst section is concerned by
the structural characteristic dominating a Danish peripheral region. The next is a
theoretical outline of mass customization as framework for transforming the tra-
ditional SME subcontractor culture to an open innovation network culture. The
ﬁnal section is recommendation to a road map of the transformation process.

1.1 Northern Jutland: Structural Characteristic
Northern Jutland is part of the mainland of the Kingdom of Denmark (Fig. 1) with
a population of 0.6 million and with an occupational structure dominated by SME
companies.
The largest geographical area is an island, separated from the mainland by the
Limfjord. Selected ﬁgures in Table 1 make a short statistical structure of the
region. The line of business in Table 1 is characterized by production. Approxi-
mately 70 % of all industrial companies employ less than 100 employees. Between
2005 and 2010, companies with more than ﬁve employees generated a growth in
turnover with more than 10 % [11]. They found that companies exist within all
sizes and identiﬁed special strength characteristics to growth:
• Low level of hierarchy and informal tone with strong crosswise team work.

• Steady and engaged employees with high degree of responsibilities and planning
capacity and skills to solve unexpected problems.
• Market understanding with a high level of navigation capacities in uncertain
surroundings.
Of challenges, the research found capital scarcity and management resources
and skills to develop new industrial business models together with limit resources
of qualiﬁed employees [11].
Companies located to Northern Jutland have an inward focus in their sales
activities, and only export approximately 25 % of the production [4]. The region is
the least-exporting region in Denmark, and for companies exporting, the main
market is nearby the border of Denmark: Norway, Sweden, and Germany. Fur-
thermore, it is documented that people settled in Northern Jutland believe that
overall activities within society must be focused on internal local activities instead
of global activities, and many people are seized with fear [18].
Region Northern Jutland has set six consecutive business clusters as priorities
growth generator for employment and economic income (Table 2). The report
recommends knowledge, knowledge sharing, and innovation to strategic instru-
ment [4].
The business clusters employ more than half of the total employment in
Northern Jutland. According to statistics Denmark [2], approximately 31,000
people are employed in the industrial sector in Northern Jutland. Even though
there are widely different frames, customers, and size, a convergence of the
strategic development of competences necessary to survival in a dynamic and
changing global competition has common characteristics. These are the coherence
between future line of business, strategies, competitive resources, and skills.
The criterion for the cluster is a complex concept focusing on integration of
personal and professional skills as growth generator in the region.
Region Northern Jutland is part of the ‘‘Big H,’’ which is the overall govern-
ment infrastructure investment plan for urban development, income growth, and
logistics (see Fig. 2). The geographical location of Denmark demands an infra-
structure which links the country to the rest of Europe, especially to the nearest
surrounding countries, because these countries are the most important trading
partners. Seventy percentage of the Danish export is traded within the European
Union (Table 3).

Placed at the northern end of the European continent and the outskirts of the Big
H and with an introvert perspective, the region faces a big challenge to generate
economic growth and new manufacturing jobs. It is very difﬁcult to put forward
suggestions for growth in the future [4].
An interesting point is that future growth potentials are placed in the inter-
section between traditional industries and divided technologies and knowledge
domains. We also argue that changes are pressing for the SME understanding of
traditional business model and product offering. Growing unpredictability to
customer demand of product speciﬁcations and accelerating technology develop-
ment of production systems require development of reconﬁgurable and scalable
manufacturing processes which can accommodate dynamic and changing demand
of individualized products.
2 Modular Organizational Forms
Dramatic changes in the nature of many companies take place in the transition to a
global society. The locus of production is no longer within the boundaries of a
single company, but occurs instead at the nexus of relationship between varieties of

parties that contribute to the production function [13]. To be ﬂexible, companies
need to be recombined into a variety of conﬁgurations much as a modular product
system which enables multiple end-product conﬁgurations from a given set of
components, but heterogeneity in resources leads to differentiated capabilities and
to put them at a competitive advantage is limited by the structural characteristics of
SME. Companies are encouraged to specialize in those activities in which their rate
of return is highest. Further, the more heterogeneous the demands made upon a
company, the pressure to produce more alternative conﬁgurations from the same
inputs available will be commanding and the more valuable the ﬂexibility becomes.
We argue that region Northern Jutland need to support what we term dynamic
community [5] by the following features: SME structure that displays modularity
(generating resource and process diversity among companies with specialties and
display product systems offering as new productive assets in the context of
changing markets). Supporting modular organization forms is an innovative fea-
ture to growth generation.
3 Characteristics of Mass Customization and Modularity
Mass customization has long been known as a competitive strategy for delivering
individually customized products at costs near mass production, bringing inex-
pensively tailored products to the end customer [10]. Applying MC implies a
number of beneﬁts to companies: the ability to charge a price premium [9, 10] and
economies of integration giving access to market information and customer loyalty
[9]. Prominent examples of MC includes customized computers from Dell, which
are all conﬁgured to individual customers’ requirements; custom shoes from
Adidas or Nike; as well as the car industry where MC is widely adopted allowing
customers to conﬁgure hundreds of different options within a speciﬁc car model.
In the competition against manufacturing in low-wage countries, shifting to a
mass customization strategy is a major possibility for Danish manufacturing
companies, since ﬂexibility, innovation, and responsiveness are all proven
strengths of Danish industry as opposed to low-cost manufacturing. Furthermore,
due to logistics of individually customized products, Denmark will have a com-
petitive advantage due to closeness to the European markets and experience within
manufacturing of small series. Hence, shifting the focus to MC would be an
enabler for growth in the Danish industry and increasing the employment of
Danish workforce.
It is commonly acknowledged that the usage of modular product architecture is
an efﬁcient way of creating the product variety necessary in mass customization [3,
16, 17]. Furthermore, the usage of modular product design has proven to have a
number of long-term positive effects on product development as well as manu-
facturing and logistics [5]. Numerous deﬁnitions of modular product architecture
exist, but in this context, the deﬁnition of modular product architecture deﬁned by
Ulrich and Eppinger [17] is adopted. This deﬁnition states that products with
354
S. B. Taps et al.

modular architectures have the following properties: (1) One module, being a part
of the product, implements one or few functional elements and (2) the interactions
and thereby interfaces between modules are well deﬁned [17]. This applies to
physical products and may to some extent also apply to digital products. However,
digital products’ variety can also be implemented without the usage of a physical
modular architecture, since products can be customized by nonphysical means.
Ulrich and Eppinger [17] deﬁne three different types of modularity: (1) slot
modular architecture, (2) bus modular architecture, and (3) sectional modular
architecture. In the sectional modular architecture, however, all interfaces between
modules are identical, implying that modules can be combined randomly, and no
module is common to all products in a product family.
Modular product architecture broadly deﬁned is often considered the opposite
of integral product architecture, in which products are not logically divided in
modules with clear interfaces. This architecture is typically chosen for perfor-
mance reasons, when size is an important optimization issue or if the product is
produced in a volume, where the accumulated variable costs exceed the savings
from choosing modular architecture.
A variation in the modular product architecture is the platform architecture. The
concept of a product platform has been deﬁned by numerous scholars. McGrath [8]
deﬁnes a product platform as: ‘‘a collection of the common elements, especially
the underlying core technology, implemented across a range of products.’’ This
deﬁnition is embraced in this context since it deﬁnes very well the characteristics
of a product platform related to the product itself, where other deﬁnitions also
focus on processes, knowledge, and organization [12]. The usage of product
platforms has proven to be a very efﬁcient way of creating a product family with a
high variety at a low cost. This is done by implementing the common functions of
a product family in a platform and implementing the differentiating characteristics
in modules which are combined with the platform. Simpson [14] deﬁnes two types
of platform-based product families; the module-based platform family and the
scale-based platform family. The module-based product family is customized by
adding or removing modules from the platform, whereas the scale-based platform
is customized by stretching or shrinking the product design. However, there are
also known examples of product families which embed both principles in the
customization process. The platform product architecture is a subtype of the
modular product architecture, which implies that a platform-based product is also
modular; however, a modular product is not necessarily platform based. As
mentioned above, Ulrich and Eppinger [17] deﬁned two modular architectures
which can arguably be characterized as platform architectures. The slot modular
architecture is deﬁned by a common module or set of modules with a number of
slots in which certain module types will ﬁt. Each slot, however, only ﬁts one
module type, and modules can thus not be interchanged. The modules which ﬁt in
the slots are thus used for differentiating the individual products, and the common
modules can be considered the product platform. The bus modular architecture
also deﬁned by Ulrich and Eppinger [17] is similar to the slot modular architec-
ture; however, modules are interchangeable. In the platform architecture, a number

of common modules will constitute the product platform containing the ‘‘bus,’’
whereas the differentiating modules used for customizing the product are ﬁtted
onto the bus. This implies somewhat greater ﬂexibility compared with the slot
modular architecture; however, the requirements for a common interface may
render this architecture impractical in some applications.
Hence, if Danish manufacturers are to exploit the opportunities in mass cus-
tomization, they must master the disciplines of modularity and product platforms.
Though theory provides extensive knowledge on the topic, many companies have
faced signiﬁcant challenges implementing this product architecture [6]. On the
other hand, mass customization provides great opportunities for competing on
different parameters than low manufacturing costs, and since it requires high
process robustness, it is considered ideal for a region like Northern Jutland. We
argue above that Northern Jutland must also aim at establishing itself as a
‘‘dynamic community’’ and utilize modular organization forms in order to produce
high-quality products by combining the competencies of different companies to
meet speciﬁc varying requirements. However, in order to do this, product modu-
larity is key, since the deﬁnition of clear interfaces between different modules will
be critical in the integration of subparts or modules of products needed to produce
a whole product.
4 Conclusion
Peripheral regions in Denmark, as well as in similar countries, face a number of
different challenges, one of them being the transition from traditional efﬁciency
supplier to open innovation agency. This transformation process has several
dimensions. One important is the solution space the product portfolio encom-
passes. Enabled by technologies such as computerization, internet, product mod-
ularity, process ﬂexibility, the solution space of the subcontractors’ product
offering accommodates the challenges in an open network structure.
We argue that region Northern Jutland needs to support the concept dynamic
community by the following features: SME structure that displays modularity
(generating resource and process diversity among companies with specialties and
display product systems offering as new productive assets in the context of
changing markets). Supporting modular organizations forms is an innovative
feature to growth generation. Furthermore, the business strategy mass custom-
ization provides important opportunities to provide competitive product offerings
for the market as well as close export markets, which are traditionally important
for Northern Jutland. However, to support modular organization forms, product
modularity must be implemented in the individual companies to enable integra-
tion. Furthermore, increasing the modularity in organizations as well as products
will enable companies in Northern Jutland to enter new markets for mass
customization.

Abstract A recent survey has indicated that 17 % of companies have ceased mass
customizing less than 1 year after initiating the effort. This paper presents mea-
surement for a company’s mass customization performance, utilizing metrics
within the three fundamental capabilities: robust process design, choice naviga-
tion, and solution space development. A mass customizer when assessing per-
formance with these metrics can identify within which areas improvement would
increase competitiveness the most and enable more efﬁcient transition to mass
customization.

1 Introduction
To address the increasing customer demand for individually customized products,
mass customization has been widely adopted as a competitive business strategy
during the last two decades [1, 2, 3, 4]. Up to 17 % of companies have within the
ﬁrst year experienced that the implementation of mass customization is much
more complicated than immediately anticipated and in some cases even jeopar-
dized the existence of the company instead of increasing competitiveness [5].
Meanwhile, others such as Dell, BMW, and Adidas have shown that success is
indeed feasible [4].
The reason why shifting to mass customization is so difﬁcult is that it is fun-
damentally different from mass production. In product development, families of

products must be developed instead of individual products. In the sales process,
vast amounts of information must be exchanged between customer and company
to conﬁgure the right product and allow the company to manufacture it. In man-
ufacturing, products are manufactured in batches of one as opposed to mass
production where batches are hundreds or thousands of identical products. This
basically renders a mass production system ineffective in relation to mass cus-
tomization manufacturing. In relation to logistics, a speciﬁc product must be
distributed from the manufacturing facility to the end customer, whereas in mass
production, a number of products are shipped from the manufacturer to a ware-
house to a retailer where it is sold to the end customer. This further introduces a
challenge since mass customization products cannot be stocked and can only be
produced once a customer order is given. All the challenges described above need
to be addressed if a company wishes to pursue a mass customization strategy,
which in many cases has proven more difﬁcult than anticipated.
1.1 Mass Customization Capabilities
Recent research has shown that the ability to transform a business into a successful
mass customization business depends primarily on three fundamental capabilities
[5, 4]: (1) ‘‘Robust Process Design—Reusing or recombining existing organiza-
tional and value chain resources to fulﬁll a stream of differentiated customer
needs,’’ (2) ‘‘Solution Space Development—Identifying the attributes along which
customer needs diverge,’’ and (3) ‘‘Choice Navigation—Supporting customers in
identifying their own solutions while minimizing complexity and the burden of
choice.’’ A company mastering each of the three capabilities will thus have
increased chances of succeeding as a mass customizer [4]. Although these three
capabilities are identiﬁed and described theoretically in literature, mass custom-
ization companies are still faced with a challenge when evaluating their capabil-
ities to identify where performance lacks since no integrated method is available
serving this purpose.
The objective of this research is to identify the relations between mass cus-
tomization capabilities, the sales and operations in a company and ultimately the
proﬁtability and thereby competitiveness of the company. Furthermore, the aim is,
by identifying these relations, to be able to measure a company’s performance
within each capability and thereby indicating which tools and methods should be
applied with the greatest improvement as a result.
1.2 Mass Customization Performance Measurement
Performance measurement has long been applied as a tool for improving perfor-
mance, and since tools like the balanced scorecard have emerged, focus within
360
K. Nielsen et al.

performance measurement has to some extent shifted from purely ﬁnancial mea-
sures to now also include non-ﬁnancial measures [6]. Many publications indicate
that performance measurement does in fact improve performance; the evidence has
been much discussed in literature [7]. It has proven a tremendously useful tool for
assisting in improving performance, performance measurement itself cannot
guarantee performance improvement, since the effect of performance measure-
ment depends on a number of factors [7]. Bourne et al. [7] analyzed these factors
and organized them into three groups: (1) context (2) content, and 3) process. The
context factors include the companies’ external environment as well as internal
factors such as structure, culture, strategy, and resources [7]. The content factors
are related what the performance measurement system actually measures, i.e., the
deﬁnition of measures, dimensions, and structure of the measures [7]. Finally, the
factors related to the process address the process in which the measures are (1)
designed, (2) implemented, (3) used, and (4) refreshed.
Hence, a high number of different factors determine whether a performance
measurement system has a positive effect on performance, both factors which can
be inﬂuenced during the development of a performance management system, but
also the contextual factors.
Relating this to a mass customization context, a performance measurement
system for mass customization should be designed with these different factors in
mind, but it also implies that one single performance measurement system will not
ﬁt all mass customization companies, since these companies will have different
contexts. However, literature generally agrees that performance measurement
systems should be aligned with the companies’ strategies [6].
In order to develop the three fundamental mass customization capabilities de-
scribed by Salvador et al. [4], performance measurement is considered an
important enabler, however, the performance measurement system must be
developed speciﬁcally to ﬁt mass customization and for a speciﬁc mass custom-
ization company to be effective. In this research, we look into the speciﬁc content,
rather than context and process of performance management systems to address
the three fundamental capabilities.
In the research presented in this paper, we identify the metrics needed to
develop a performance measurement system for mass customization, assuming this
will be a valuable tool for companies to be able to establish themselves as mass
customizers or for existing mass customizers to improve performance. The
research question is:
What metrics can be used to measure performance and thereby assess capa-
bilities for choice navigation, solution space development, and robust process
design and how can these be determined?
The research question has been answered through ﬁrst deﬁning each capability,
and in overall terms, what should be assessed. Then, a literature review is conducted
to identify related metrics already deﬁned in literature. These metrics are evaluated,
whether they are descriptive in relation to the three capabilities, and a ﬁnal set of
metrics is developed for each capability. In previous papers, thorough literature
reviews have been conducted and metrics deﬁned in greater detail [3, 8, 13, 9].

2 Metrics
Three fundamental capabilities in mass customization have been analyzed for key
performance indicators during literature reviews and explorative research. To
support this work, each capability has been analyzed to establish evaluation cri-
teria sets for each of the three capabilities. Because of the different nature of the
capabilities, no common evaluation criteria set has been established. The evalu-
ation criteria sets have been chosen on individual basis for each of the three
capabilities, with two goals in mind (1) they must be measurable; otherwise, they
are per deﬁnition not metrics and (2) the required data should preferably be readily
available in the company or should be easily obtainable. Luckily, most mass
customization companies have information systems which could support this, such
as conﬁgurators, product lifecycle management (PLM) systems, enterprise
resource planning (ERP) systems, engineering change management (ECM) sys-
tems, which are expected to provide most of the required data.
The authors have in previous research made a comprehensive presentation of
potential metrics for each of the three capabilities and based on the evaluation
criteria made a selection of metrics [3, 8, 13, 9]. Each metric’s value has
accordingly been veriﬁed for valuable information about the capability. These
selected and veriﬁed metrics are presented as a walk-through of the metrics one by
one, with name, equation (if existing) and a veriﬁcation of how the metric’s value
can assist assessment and measurement in the speciﬁc capability.
2.1 Choice Navigation Metrics
The choice navigation capability is related primarily to the capabilities of the
conﬁguration system, and its ability to conﬁgure a variety of products. The cus-
tomer experience from a product conﬁguration process should aim for a result
where the customers recognize that the conﬁguration process supports the cus-
tomer’s requirements and offers the products which fulﬁll the customer’s exact
needs [4].
Supporting the customer in the process, making the product conﬁguration easy
and fast, is a matter of making it easy to match characteristics of needs, empower
customer in building models of needs, or embed the conﬁguration in the product
[4], from an assessment point-of-view this is potentially measurable. Measuring
how well the choice navigation ensures a 100 % ﬁt between customer needs and
the goods conﬁgured by the customers, however, seems more difﬁcult.
In choice navigation, the evaluation criteria set has been established with
introduction of three sets and their intersections (see Fig. 1): solution space (SS),
products and variants developed by the company, customers demanded variety
(CDV), expressing customers’ needs, and ﬁnally customers conﬁguration (CC), an
expression of the conﬁguration actually done by the customer (or sales personal).
362
K. Nielsen et al.

Analyzing Fig. 1, intersections B and C are consequences of a mismatch
between the actual demand and solution space, where B implies variety which is
part of the solution space but has no demand thus potentially implying unnecessary
complexity costs. C implies a demand for variety that is not met by the current
solution space and which may indicate an intersection where the development of
the solution space could increase sales. The D intersection is seemingly less
interesting in terms of choice navigation, since they relate primarily to the capa-
bilities within solution space development.
In intersection D, the customer conﬁgures a product that does not meet the
demand nor is it contained in the solution space. This is not a typical situation, but
is nevertheless undesirable and would likely be indicated by the customer aban-
doning the conﬁguration. In intersection E, there is a match between the variety
offered by the company and the customer demand; however, the customer does not
conﬁgure the product. This is likely a result of a user interface unable to guide the
customer satisfactory through the conﬁguration process. Intersection F indicates
conﬁguration, which match a customer demand, but is outside the actual solution
space, i.e., a product that can be conﬁgured but not produced, which is also highly
undesirable. Finally, in intersection G, the customer conﬁgures a product that is
within the solution space but does not meet the demand thus resulting in a cus-
tomer disappointment.

The CA metric describes how frequently customers or sales people choose to
abort a conﬁguration which has been initiated due to whatever reason. A high CA
value can be used as an indication, for intersection E (see Fig. 1), since customers
that cannot conﬁgure a product to meet their requirements will likely abandon the
conﬁguration.
Customers return rate metric (RTR) source: [11]
RTR ¼ number of returned products
number of delivered products
The RTR metric describes how often customers return a product to the com-
pany after receiving it due to, e.g., disappointment in the product.
In this case, customers realize that the conﬁgured product does not meet
requirements, after it is received. In this case, the customer may return the product,
which then is indicated by RTR. High RTR value indicates information about
intersection G, an area within solution space but no customers’ need.
Customers churn rate metric (CR) source: [12]
CR DT

NOC
number of customers at T
NONC
number of new customers at DT
The CR metric describes the relationship between new customers and lost
customers. High value of CR indicates information about intersection G, an area
with solution space but no customers’ need.
Customers repurchase rate metric (RR) source: [11]
RR ¼ repurchase through existing customers DT
ð

number of new customers DT
ð

The RR metric describes how often products are repurchased, or how often
customers return to purchase another different product. A low value of RR indi-
cates information about intersection G, an area with solution space but no cus-
tomers’ need.

K. Nielsen et al.

Customers complaints rate metric (COR) source: [10]
COR ¼ number of complaints DT
ð
Þ
numberof deliveries DT

Similar to the CR metric, the COR metric describes how often customers
complain over a product they have purchased after receiving it. A high value of
COR indicates information about intersection G, an area with solution space but no
customers’ need.
Seller order cancellation rate (SOCR) source: [13]
SOCR ¼ number of orders canceled by seller
number of placed orders
The value of metric SOCR can have several reasons; one could be, customers
conﬁgure products which are within the customer demanded variety but outside
the solution space, i.e., a product is conﬁgured which cannot be delivered. This
would likely result in the order being canceled by the company, since it cannot be
manufactured. High values of SOCR would then indicate conﬁgurations within
intersection F, an area with customers need but no solution space.
Seller order change rate after purchase (SOCRAP) source: [13]
SOCRAP ¼ number of orders changed by seller
number of placed orders
If a conﬁguration is inside customer demand variety but outside solution space,
an alternative to cancellation would be that the company will change the conﬁg-
uration to ﬁt within the solution space by, e.g., upgrading the product. High values
of SOCRAP would then indicate conﬁgurations within intersection F.
Customer order cancellation rate (COCR) source: [13]
COCR ¼ number of orders canceled by customer
number of placed orders
In this case, the customer conﬁgures a product, which is within solution space
but does not correspond to the customer’s requirements and if the customer
realizes that the product is not satisfactory prior to delivery, the customer may
cancel the order. High values of COCR could indicate conﬁgurations within
intersection G, an area with solution space but no customers’ need.
Customer order change rate after purchase (COCRAP) source: [13]
COCRAP ¼ no: of orders changed by customer
number of placed orders
Mass Customization Measurements Metrics
365

In this case, the customer conﬁgures a product, which is within solution space
but does not correspond to the customer’s requirements and if the customer
realizes that the product is not satisfactory prior to delivery, the customer may
alternatively change the order. High values of COCRAP could indicate conﬁgu-
rations within intersection G, an area with solution space but no customers’ need.
Conﬁguration sales rate metric (CSR) source: [13]
CSR ¼ number of sold configurations
number of started configurations
CSR indicates, when values are high, that most conﬁgurations lead to a sale and
hence an indicator of being on target with choice navigation. Since conﬁgurations
within intersection A should lead to a sale, then an increase in CSR would also
indicate an increase in conﬁgurations within intersection A, the area which satisfy
the customer, with solutions space and potential conﬁguration opportunity.
2.2 Solution Space Development Metrics
In order to establish metrics for solution space development and developing
measurement techniques, it is important to have some sort of idea of what con-
stitutes a ‘‘good’’ solution space or even an optimal solution space.
A set of performance parameters has been introduced as evaluation criteria’s for
metrics in solution space development, these parameters are presented in Fig. 2.
Selected metrics for assessment and measurement of solution space development
are as follows:
Aggregate solution space proﬁtability (ASSP) source: [14]
ASSP ¼ Total Sales income  Total manufacturing cost
The metric ASSP is a measure of how proﬁtable the solution space is as a whole
and should be measured over a period of time.
Proﬁtability per product family (PFP) source: [14]
PFP ¼ Sales income from product fammanufacturing cost for product fam
This metrics requires high data availability and detailed data about manufac-
turing cost. The metric can be used in comparison status as an indicator for
proﬁtability per product family over a period. Positive high values of PFP indicate
proﬁtable product family.
366
K. Nielsen et al.

Conﬁguration variable proﬁtability (CVP), Negative proﬁtability (NPCV), and
Skewness of the distribution of proﬁtability (CVPS)
CVP is a metric which is somewhat less trivial to determine. However, if
historical conﬁguration data are available with sales price and manufacturing costs
registered for each conﬁguration, it is possible to generate a linear model
describing the variation in price and cost from the conﬁguration variables using the
methods described by Brunoe and Nielsen [15]. From the signiﬁcance and coef-
ﬁcients for each variable, it will be indicated if a speciﬁc conﬁguration choice is
proﬁtable, e.g., a speciﬁc color. However, assessing each variable may be useful in
solution space development choices but less useful in assessing a company’s
overall capability, since it will consist typically of hundreds of records, corre-
sponding to the number of conﬁguration options. However, once the proﬁtability
for each option is calculated, the distribution of proﬁtability’s may be analyzed.
What is interesting here is how many conﬁguration variables (percentage) have
negative proﬁtability (NPCV). Obviously, this value should be as low as possible
and will indicate how well a company is able to develop only conﬁguration
choices, which are beneﬁcial. Furthermore, we propose a metric for the skewness
of the distribution of proﬁtability (CVPS). A positive value of CVPS will indicate
that a few conﬁguration variables are very proﬁtable, whereas a negative value of
CVPS would indicate that a number of conﬁguration variables contribute signif-
icantly to a lower proﬁtability, speciﬁcally for these above-mentioned metrics, and
because they are calculated based on algorithms, no arithmetic equations have
been included.
Used variety (UV), mean conﬁguration variable utilization percentage (MCVUP),
and conﬁguration variable utilization percentage variance (CVUPV) source: [14]
Fig. 2 Evaluation criteria’s
for solution space capability
Mass Customization Measurements Metrics
367

UV ¼ Number of perceived variants
Number of all possible variants
UV metric addresses how well the solution space is utilized by the customers,
i.e., how much variety is offered vs. how much does actually make sense compared
to the customers’ requirements. However, using this metric may be difﬁcult in
practice, since the number of perceived variants is not readily available. A more
practical way of assessing the utilization would be to calculate the frequency by
which each conﬁguration variable is chosen by a customer. By dividing this by the
frequency of which conﬁgurations are made in general, the percentage of con-
ﬁgurations containing a certain conﬁguration choice could be calculated, thereby
describing the utilization of a certain conﬁguration variable. If these percentages
are analyzed statistically, the two metrics MCVUP and CVUPV can be derived.
The value of these two metrics can provide insight into the magnitude and dif-
ferences in frequency by which certain parts of the solution space are actually
creating value for customers. Because they are calculated based on algorithms, no
arithmetic equations speciﬁc for MCVUP and CVUPV have been presented.
Repurchase rate (RR) source: [11]
RR ¼
number of repurchases
total number of purchases
The metric RR describes to what extent customers repurchase a product, or to
what extent customers return to the company to buy a different product. If cus-
tomers repurchase products regularly, it is reasonable to assume that those cus-
tomers have been happy with the variety and the product in general. Otherwise,
they would likely have chosen a competing product instead.
A high value of RR can be interpreted as an indicator for high customer sat-
isfaction with the product offerings, including variety. Clearly, the RR does only
make sense for products, which are purchased frequently, e.g., customized muesli
or shirts, whereas products like cars or houses are purchased less frequently by the
same customer, rendering this metric irrelevant.
Conﬁguration Abortion Rate (CAR) source: [10]
CAR ¼ number of aborted configurations
number of initiated configurations
The value of CAR (same as CA metric presented in Sect. 2.1) can also be a
measure of how satisﬁed the customers are with the offered variety. If a customer
initiates a conﬁguration and is not able to select the desired product properties and
is thus unsatisﬁed with the offered variety, that customer is likely to abandon the
conﬁguration and purchase a competing product. Hence, a high abortion rate could
indicate that customers are dissatisﬁed with the offered variety and vice versa.
368
K. Nielsen et al.

Multiple use (MU) source: [16]
MU ¼ NV
NM
The value of MU metric indicates how many modules are required to produce
all variants within the solution space [17]. NV is the number of product variants
required by customers and NM is the number of different modules required to
build all variants in the product portfolio. While number of different modules
should be easy for any company to determine, the number of variants required by
customers is less trivial.
Modules Commonality Metric (MCM) and Parts Commonality (PC) source: [10]
MCM ¼
Number of common modules
Total number of different modules
The MCM [18] is a measure of how many modules are common to all variants
relative to the total number of different modules. Generally, a higher MCM value
will indicate more efﬁcient product architecture, since higher commonality will
usually imply lower manufacturing and development costs source: [10].
PC ¼
Number of common parts
Total number of different parts
PC [18] is used to measure the relationship between common parts and the total
number of different parts in the same way as the MCM. A high PC value also
indicates an efﬁcient product architecture since that would imply higher pur-
chasing volume for each different part further implying lower purchasing costs.
Rate of which New Conﬁguration Attributes are Introduced (RNCA), Rate of
Eliminated Conﬁguration Attributes (RECA), and Average lead time for conﬁgu-
ration variable changes (ALCVC)
RNCA [14] is determined by summing up the number of added conﬁguration
choices during a certain period. Similarly, the value of RECA can be measured
[14]. A high RNCA value indicates that a company frequently introduces new
options for customers and would indicate that the company reacts to a broad
spectrum of changes in the market. A large difference between RNCA and RECA
would indicate that the solution space is either growing or shrinking. A steadily
growing solution space could indicate a problem, since the company may be
focusing on introducing new variety without doing ‘‘housekeeping’’ and elimi-
nating options not needed anymore. This could result in unnecessarily increasing
manufacturing complexity.
The two metrics described above describe the change rate of the solution space,
but not the lead time for changes (ALCVC), which is also essential when

competing in a rapidly changing market [14]. Speciﬁc for these above-mentioned
metrics and because they are calculated based on algorithms, no arithmetic
equations have been included.
2.3 Robust Process Design Metrics
To evaluate metrics in Robust Process Design, two viewpoints have been intro-
duced and are indicated in Fig. 3.
• The ability to manufacture a variety of products within a ﬁxed solution space,
i.e., the current product portfolio/variety—Robustness toward existing variety
• The ability to adapt the manufacturing system to accommodate new variety,
e.g., when the solution space changes due to new product options—robustness
toward new variety. This has a close relation to solution space development.
Both viewpoints of the capability are relevant; however, they are not neces-
sarily correlated. For example, a purely manual production is highly ﬂexible
toward new variety compared to a highly specialized and automated production,
whereas the latter would probably be more efﬁcient in manufacturing a predeﬁned
variety.

It is generally acknowledged that a late differentiation point or customer
decoupling point is an enabler for an efﬁcient mass customization production, the
DPI is a measure of how postponed the variant creation is in a manufacturing
process. DPI indicates the postponement of variants and on the other hand how
many manufacturing processes have to change due to product variety. The most
postponed manufacturing setup is expected to support highly robust manufacturing
processes and therefore a very good indicator of robust process design.

SI indicates how setup costs contribute to the overall manufacturing costs. The
SI calculates the cost of setup of manufacturing processes compared to the total
cost of a product. Since a high value of setup cost is an indicator of a low
robustness, this indicator can contribute to the assessment of process robustness.

NMP gives a measure of the average number of modules manufactured in the

processes, since each process will be able to manufacture more different modules
and thus a higher number of end variants.

variety.

PVI indicates how much the variety of manufacturing processes increases when
a new product option or product is introduced in the manufacturing system. The
PVI metric calculated as an average during a period in time. A low value of PVI
will indicate a high robustness since this implies that few new processes need to be
introduced, when a product option is introduced and thus that the existing pro-
cesses can accommodate new product variety.

In addition to the PVI metric, the CAPIV is introduced. This is done since a
high value of PVI does not necessarily can be compared with high cost, given a
new process is implemented on existing ﬂexible equipment. The CAPIV metric
also calculated as an average over a period of time.

The time and cost to introduce new product variety are also important metrics to
assess process robustness, since robust processes will imply low cost and fast
introduction of new product variety.
3 Discussion
It is evident that the application of these metrics poses certain requirements related
to data availability and quality. However, most mass customization companies
already have systems in place which are very likely to contain the data required for
calculating the metrics presented in this paper.
There are strong relations between these three capabilities, and phenomena
experienced in a company cannot necessarily be attributed to only one capability.
If for instance the proﬁtability of the solution space changes, instead of changes in
the solution space, it could be due to changes in the manufacturing processes
lowering manufacturing costs or changes in choice navigation leading customers
to choose products sold at a greater price.
One other example is the metric conﬁguration abortion rate which we argue
indicates how well choice navigation is implemented. However, the conﬁguration
abortion rate will be strongly inﬂuenced by the solution space, i.e., how well the
offered variety matches the demanded variety. In future research, the relationship
Mass Customization Measurements Metrics
373

between the capabilities should be established and the links between all three
capabilities need to be analyzed. Furthermore, the relations between metrics per-
formance and speciﬁc methods should be addressed so that an assessment could
point out not only what a company should do to improve but also how.
When performing an assessment and interpreting the values of the metrics, the
interpretation should take into account the product type. Also when benchmarking,
companies manufacturing different products cannot necessarily be compared
directly. The reason for this is that several metrics are based on the customers’
actions, and these actions will depend on the product type. For example, a cus-
tomer buys a customized car compared to a customized bag of muesli, the cus-
tomer would probably then be more likely to complain or return the car if it has a
wrong color compared to the muesli, if a wrong ingredient has been added. In that
case, the difference would be due to the difference in cost of the products. Fur-
thermore, a metric like the repurchase rate makes more sense for some product
types than others. For example, customers are likely to repurchase muesli more
often than cars. So this metric would depend on to what extent a product can be
characterized as a consumable or a durable, and in case it is a durable, how long
the life cycle is.
4 Conclusion
In order to support the development of production in mass customization, metrics
are needed in order make performance measurement, assessment, and bench-
marking. To establish these metrics, relevant literature has been reviewed and
several applicable metrics have been identiﬁed. Further metrics have been deﬁned
in areas where no sufﬁcient metrics could be identiﬁed in literature.
In relation to research in mass customization, it is the intention to apply these
metrics in different types of mass customization companies to analyze what dis-
tinguishes successful mass customizers. It is the intention that these metrics can be
used in mass customization companies for different purposes. One purpose is
benchmarking against ‘‘best practice’’ mass customizers, in order to identify areas
with the greatest potential for improvement. Another purpose is to use these
metrics as key performance indicators which are continually calculated to monitor
performance to continuously improve.
This work concludes a preliminary research of assessment and measurement of
the mass customization process. We have with this paper ﬁnalized a general
approach how to assess and measure mass customization and set a framework of
potential metrics, whether this is for the purpose of internally performance indi-
cators or it is used for benchmarking in general. The next stage in this research will
be test and evaluation of these potential useful metrics.

Mass-Customization Service Encounters:
The Inﬂuence of the Co-Design Process
Structure on Performance
Miriam Oversohl and Moritz Wellige
Abstract Increasingly, companies offer customizable products to consumers. This
study investigates how the different layouts of a co-design process affect cus-
tomers’ perception and evaluation of the process and its outcome as well as the
productivity of the process from the companies’ point of view. In an experiment
which was carried out with a mass-customization provider in the ﬁeld of shoes, the
authors ﬁnd that a more structured co-design process reduces customers’ percep-
tion of complexity and decreases time duration necessary to serve customers.
However, some expected effects could not be conﬁrmed in the experiment. More
speciﬁcally, the modiﬁcations show no effect on outcome variables like customer
satisfaction. Nevertheless, this study provides some valuable implications for how
companies can design their co-design processes to increase the productivity and
decrease complexity.

1 Introduction
Mass-customization (MC) business strategies require information to be exchanged
between the MC provider and its customers. These providers have to communicate
customization options, and customers need to articulate their preferences [1].

During this interactive co-design process, a product that matches customers’ needs
has to be found, which is feasible within production possibilities [2]. However, this
process of identifying suitable product solutions is associated with difﬁculties and
high effort for companies as well as for customers [3]. The associated high degree
of variety in the assortment as well as the co-design process itself can induce
complexity and uncertainty for the customers [4]. If customers’ uncertainties and
efforts of choice making are too high, they might cancel the purchase [5]. Thus,
designing a co-design process requires companies to balance customer require-
ments concerning the co-design process, costs, and efforts in order to gain a high
level of productivity and customer satisfaction at the same time.
This study investigates how a modiﬁcation of the co-design process inﬂuences
perceptions of complexity and the overall productivity of the MC provider.
Therefore, an experiment with 79 participants was conducted, using an MC pro-
vider in the ﬁeld of luxury shoes as example. An analysis of companies’ co-design
process, a focus group with its customers, and an interview with the CEO indicates
that the mentioned difﬁculties and efforts associated with co-design could be
identiﬁed in the company: They need to invest one hour of time on average to co-
design a pair of shoes together with its customers. Moreover, during the co-design
process, technical devices and other resources of the company are tied to the
service process. Thus, the present layout of the co-design process of the company
is associated with high expenditures and costs to serve each single customer. In the
focus group, it was investigated that customers are often overwhelmed by the co-
design process and the product options the company is offering. Particularly for
novices, the co-design process seems to be a tough task.1
In an experiment, the transparency of the co-design process, its structure, and
outer appearance of the store’s environment were manipulated in order to inves-
tigate effects on customers’ perception and evaluation, and the overall productivity
of the process. Therefore, basing on the theory, hypothesis will be deducted in the
following. Subsequently, the data acquiring and analysis will be described. Finally,
results will be presented and managerial implications and limitations of this study
will be discussed.
2 Theory and Hypotheses
MC providers face the challenge to design the MC service encounter in an
appealing manner. One issue of concern is complexity that is often associated with
variety [6] also called the ‘‘paradox of choice’’ [7]. Whereas, on the one side,
customers value variety as ﬁnding a suitable product solution is more likely within
a large assortment, and on the other side, variety fosters complexity and in
turn impedes customers’ decision-making process. Amount of customization

possibilities and related information might appear quite complex and confusing [5,
8, 9]. Search and information costs rise due to the large amount of alternatives that
have to be evaluated.
Companies need to ensure that customers are able to enjoy a sufﬁcient degree of
freedom during the conﬁguration while minimizing the risk of mass confusion
[10]. Reducing complexity within the MC offering is presumed to create value for
customers as well as for companies. The co-design process structure and the outer
appearance of a store contribute to perceptions of complexity. The aim is to
construct MC environments that satisfy customers’ needs, reduce complexity and
uncertainty, and simultaneously increase operational ease and efﬁciency from
companies’ point of view [11].
In the following, it will be hypothesized how a more transparent structure of co-
design processes and better-tuned outer appearance of the environmental process
surroundings, thus more customer-oriented processes, affect the different deter-
minants of customer satisfaction and the productivity of the overall co-design
process.
2.1 Duration of the Co-design Process
Deﬁning a customized product is more time-consuming than choosing a standard
product off the shelf [3]. Customers need to get familiar with the MC concept and
evaluate various individualization options. This requires time as customers want to
ensure that they recognized the entire offering and collected all relevant infor-
mation [9]. To reduce anticipated regret and uncertainties, customers spend
extensive time within the decision-making process. Empirical results conﬁrm that
emotionally difﬁcult decisions impede decision-making and demand more time
[12, 13].
The service encounters’ environment affects customers’ decision-making pro-
cess [14]; interior can contribute to customers’ reconstruction of the co-design
process as indications about the service procedure can be given [11]. Customers
value stores that follow a logical structure and provide assistances (e.g., signs or
separated waiting areas) to comprehend the offered service more easily [14]. In the
context of MC creating transparency within the co-design process and aligning, the
outer appearance of a store with the co-design process seems to create value. The
layout of a physical shop environment can be used to guide customers through an
assortment [15]. An organized structure, which reﬂects the co-design process, is
supposed to facilitate customers’ decision-making. Customers are supposed to
process the co-design process more easily if it follows a logical structure. In turn,
the co-design process should demand less time.
H1 The co-design process will demand less time within a more customer-
oriented co-design process.
Mass-Customization Service Encounters
379

2.2 Process Effort and Enjoyment
Customers are willing to pay premium prices for customized product solutions as
MC providers succeed in creating pleasurable shopping experiences [16]. It seems
crucial that customers enjoy the conﬁguration task and do not perceive the co-
design process as a waste of time [1]. Customers experience different values from
the co-design process. They are proud to be the initiator of the customized product,
also called the ‘‘I designed it myself’’ [17], or the ‘‘pride of authorship’’ effect [3].
Furthermore, customers enjoy venting their creativity [18].
The design of the MC service encounter should contribute to customers’ out-
come of the co-design process; process effort and process enjoyment are of con-
cern. Whereas process effort should be minimized, customers’ joy should be
maximized [19]. Perceived complexity has a major impact on those two items.
Within a complex environment, it seems to be even more difﬁcult to deﬁne a
customized product [5]. A wide range of customization possibilities can confuse
and overwhelm customers [9].
Precise directions and simple layouts are in need to support customers
accomplishing the transaction [14]. The aim is to facilitate customers’ decision-
making. Transferring ﬁndings from the MC online environment to the stationary
retail, it seems valuable to structure the conﬁguration task hierarchically [20]. It is
anticipated that a transparent co-design process that is aligned to the service
environment can be passed more easily. Customers are able to complete the
conﬁguration task on their own, what in turn raises feelings of accomplishment
and increases satisfaction [3].
H2a Customers perceive less complexity within a more customer-oriented co-
design process.
H2b Customers perceive higher process enjoyment within a more customer-
oriented co-design process.
2.3 Product Satisfaction
Besides values stemming from the co-design process, customers perceive further
values from the ﬁnal product itself. Functionality and utility are enhanced as
products are aligned to customers’ needs [4]. How satisﬁed customers are with the
product outcome depends on the degree to which needs and expectations are met
[21]. If expectations are fulﬁlled, customers are contended.
Research proved that product satisfaction is connected to process experiences
[18]. Customers, who perceive the co-design process as entertaining task, evaluate
the ﬁnal product more positively and are willing to spend more money [22].
Furthermore, an easy process is supposed to create value as customers presume to
make the right choice; due to convenience of the decision, they perceive less
380

anticipated regret [23]. Thus, a joyful and comprehensible co-design process
increases product satisfaction. A transparent co-design process should increase
experienced joy and in turn product satisfaction. Furthermore, it is expected that
the outer appearance of the MC service encounter has an effect on product sat-
isfaction. Bitner showed within an empirical study that the organization of a
working environment inﬂuences customers’ perceptions of service failure [24].
Disorganized working places were connected to incompetence and inefﬁciency,
and customers within the disorganized treatment considered future appearance of
service failures as probable [24]. Thus, physical surroundings appear to contribute
to perceptions of service quality and trust. An organized appearance of MC pro-
viders is essential as participating within customization demands for a high level
of trust. An ordered co-design process should make contribution to perceptions of
organization and in turn lead to higher product satisfaction.
H3 Customers perceive higher product satisfaction within a more customer-
oriented co-design process.
2.4 Loyalty
Concerning the success of an MC offering, customers’ loyalty seems to play an
important role. To be successful in the long run requires that customers return to
the offering and recommend the company to others [25]. Customers, who are
satisﬁed with an offering, will repurchase and convince others of the company; this
phenomenon is termed ‘‘word-of-mouth’’ communication [21]. Certain things
account for loyalty: satisfaction with the co-design process, satisfaction with the
ﬁnal product, and the overall impression of the offering. Research proved that
service environments have an inﬂuence on WOM communication [26]; store
remodeling affects customers’ tendency to recommend the company at least in the
short run. As modiﬁcation of the co-design process is supposed to enhance process
enjoyment and product satisfaction, it seems logical to assume that in turn cus-
tomers’ loyalty will be improved.
H4 Customers show a higher loyalty toward the MC provider within a more
customer-oriented co-design process.
2.5 Productivity
To evaluate the overall productivity factors that contribute to productivity have to
be identiﬁed. The conventional productivity concept needs to be extended to a
company–customer perspective. This could be differentiated between two
dimensions: the operational productivity and the customer productivity. From the
companies’ point of view, there are common inputs like hour worked, amount of
Mass-Customization Service Encounters
381

materials, or use of technical devices [27, 28]. Further, process and personnel
issues determine providers’ productivity in the special case of MC. Companies’
output is speciﬁed by the number of closed sales or sold products [29]. From
customers’ point of view, productivity of the co-design process is inﬂuenced
through various determinants. Inputs that come into play are time, effort, prior
knowledge, creativity, motivation, and decision-making ability. Customers’ out-
come is affected through satisfaction with the process and product solution, per-
ceived quality, and values stemming from individualization.
Providers face the challenge to use resources efﬁciently and maximize pro-
ductivity. The provider’s aim is to keep the input as low as possible while max-
imizing customers’ output. Within this experiment, a productivity ratio containing
companies’ and customers’ inputs and outputs before modiﬁcation of the co-
design process will be compared to a productivity ratio after modiﬁcation of the
co-design process. On the basis of the foregoing considerations, it seems plausible
that the modiﬁcation of the co-design process structure affects companies’ and
customers’ inputs and outputs.
From the companies’ perspective, the time the co-design process takes is crucial
as resources are bonded for the speciﬁc period of time. Employees have to be
present, and materials and technical devices have to be available. Concerning
hypothesis one, a reduction in the length of the co-design process leads to an
improvement of productivity for MC providers as the amount of required inputs
decreases. Assumptions of hypothesis four have further a positive inﬂuence on
companies’ productivity. As customers are loyal to the MC provider, they are
likely to repurchase in the future and recommend the company to others. The
process’ output rises due to a greater extent of sold items. As inputs decline and
outputs increase through the modiﬁcation of the co-design process, operational
productivity improves.
From the customers’ point of view, the modiﬁcation of the co-design process
structure is as well assumed to increase productivity. In terms of hypothesis one,
less duration time of the co-design process leads to an improvement of produc-
tivity as customers have to spend fewer inputs. Besides process’ outcomes
increase, customers perceive higher process enjoyment and product satisfaction.
Changes in the operational and the customer productivity affect the overall pro-
ductivity of the MC service encounter. Following the previous assumptions,
modifying the co-design process structure yields an improvement in the both
dimensions of the productivity ratio. Therefore, it seems plausible to hypothesize
that the overall productivity improves as well.
H5a Operational productivity is higher within a more customer-oriented co-
design process.
H5b Customer productivity is higher within a more customer-oriented co-
design process.
H5c The overall productivity is higher within a more customer-oriented co-
design process.

3 Data and Research Design
Within an empirical experiment, inﬂuences of a modiﬁcation of a co-design
process in terms of customer-orientation will be examined. In detail, it will be
examined whether the co-design process structure has an impact of MC service
encounters productivity. Data collection, analysis, and results will be presented.
Store Selection As already mentioned, the study was conducted together with
an MC provider in the ﬁeld of luxury shoes. Results of the focus groups displayed
that customers sometimes are confused and overwhelmed by the large amount of
customization possibilities and different visible stimuli. Therefore, within a ﬁrst
step, the status quo of the co-design process as it proceeds within the store and the
outer appearance of the store were recorded. As the status quo had been analyzed,
appropriate modiﬁcations of the co-design process structure were identiﬁed, and a
concept for a more customer-oriented co-design process, thus a more transparent
and better-tuned outer appearance of the process, was derived.
Design and Procedure Hypotheses were tested using a between-subject design
with one manipulation namely modiﬁcation of the co-design process structure
(current vs. modiﬁed). The study took place within a research laboratory at RWTH
Aachen University. The company provided all materials to rebuild the co-design
process within the laboratory environment. Participants separately had to pass the
co-design process and afterward complete a questionnaire. Eighty-one women
participated within the study; they were randomly assigned to one of the both
treatment groups.
Each appointment proceeded in a similar way. After the welcoming, the con-
cept of the company and the procedure of the co-design were explained. Con-
cerning the explanation of the co-design process structure, both treatment groups
differed (current co-design process vs. modiﬁed co-design process). In the fol-
lowing, subjects had to design their individual shoes. As conﬁguration of the shoes
was complete, participants were asked to take part at the survey. Finally, subjects
were said goodbye.
Independent Variable The independent variable alludes to the modiﬁcation of
the co-design process (current co-design process vs. modiﬁed co-design process).
The current co-design process proceeds similar to the co-design process at the
store of the company. Modiﬁcations dealt with the structure of the co-design
process (transparence) and the outer appearance of the physical surrounding.
Concerning structure, the modiﬁed co-design process is broken down into minute
steps that follow a precise order. In terms of the outer appearance of the envi-
ronment, the amount of visual stimuli was reduced. Taking leathers as example,
the number of patterns was reduced. Whereas in the current co-design process, all
possible kinds and colors of leathers were displayed; within the modiﬁed co-design
process, there was just one pattern for every kind of leather in a neutral color.
Measures Time duration was measured observing the time the co-design
process takes place. Process effort, process enjoyment, product satisfaction, and
loyalty were measured using a questionnaire. Appropriate scales were adapted
Mass-Customization Service Encounters
383

from previous studies [9, 18, 22, 25]. Besides, the questionnaire entailed a
manipulation check to examine whether the independent variable was manipulated
successfully. All ﬁve items yield alpha values greater than 0.70 referring to a
satisfactory degree of reliability. An EFA was conducted for each variable, factor
loadings were above 0.06.
4 Analysis and Results
Seventy-nine completed questionnaires could be gathered and used for further
analyses. Statistic methods were applied to assess whether the modiﬁcation of the
co-design process structure yields to variations in time duration, process effort,
process enjoyment, product satisfaction, loyalty, operational productivity, cus-
tomer productivity, and the overall productivity.
Results of the analysis reveal that the manipulation of the independent variable
has been successfully made. There is a signiﬁcant difference between the two
conditions in terms of process structure (t (77) = -2.176, p \ 0.05); participants
within the modiﬁed co-design process experience the co-design process as more
structured than participants within the current co-design process condition.
Concerning the duration of the co-design process, it was found that participants
within the modiﬁed co-design process take signiﬁcantly less time to complete the
conﬁguration task (t (65.55) = 4.628, p \ 0.01). Whereas on average, the current
co-design process took 34 min (SE = 0:12:02), the modiﬁed co-design process
lasted 23 min and 35 s (SE = 0:07:30). Results support hypothesis one; modiﬁ-
cation of the co-design process led to a reduction in the time duration of about
32 %.
There was no signiﬁcant difference between the groups in terms of process
effort (F (1.77) = 0.079, p [ 0.05); hypothesis 2a could not be conﬁrmed. Sub-
jects did not perceive less complexity within the modiﬁed co-design process than
customers within the current co-design process. Besides, there was no support for
hypothesis 2b. Experienced joy did not differ signiﬁcantly between the current and
the modiﬁed co-design process conditions (Welch (1.60) = 0.218, p = 0.642).
Subjects within the modiﬁed co-design process group were supposed to be more
satisﬁed with the ﬁnal product solution. Assumptions could not be veriﬁed; rele-
vant means did not differ signiﬁcantly (F (1.77) = 0.854, p [ 0.05).
In terms of loyalty, there were no statistical differences between the two con-
ditions (Welch (1.67) = 0.277, p = 0.600). Customers did not show a higher
loyalty toward the MC provider within the modiﬁed co-design process than cus-
tomers within the current co-design process.
Modiﬁcation of the co-design process was further supposed to increase oper-
ational productivity. Results show that even if the output remains at a constant
level, reduction in required inputs leads to an enhancement of operational pro-
ductivity; hypothesis 5a could be supported. Concerning customer productivity,
384

similar results can be documented. As the co-design process took less time, cus-
tomers have to spend fewer inputs. Outputs were not affected through modiﬁcation
of the co-design process. Although overall customer productivity is higher within
the modiﬁed co-design process than within the current co-design process, there is
support for hypothesis 5b.
As modiﬁcation of the co-design process improves companies’ as well as
customers’ productivity, the overall productivity of the MC service encounter is
also enhanced. Hypothesis 5c could be supported.
5 Conclusion and Future Research
At least for the case of the regarded MC provider, this experiment suggests that the
layout of the co-design process has an inﬂuence on perceptions of complexity and
the MC service encounters’ productivity. Modiﬁcations in terms of transparency of
the co-design process, its structure, and the outer appearance of the store’s envi-
ronment yield to a reduction in perceived complexity and duration time, and thus
can help improve the overall productivity. However, the theoretically deducted and
hypothesized relationships between the layout of co-design processes and cus-
tomers’ process effort, process enjoyment, product satisfaction, and loyalty could
not be conﬁrmed in this experiment. This might reﬂect the reality, but could also
be attributed to the setup of the experiment, such as that manipulations might be
not appropriate or some factors that inﬂuenced the results were not taken into
account. We suggest that further research has to be carried out to verify these
results.
However, some of the results offer insights for other MC providers. Although
each customization offering is highly dependent on individual product character-
istics, most providers face similar problems: Presenting customization options and
creating a pleasurable shopping experience for different types of customers are
quite difﬁcult. Presentation of MC assortments bears risks of oversupply of visible
stimuli and non-transparency within the co-design process. Here, this study offers
some valuable hints to other MC providers, how to improve present co-design
processes or implement more customer-oriented processes. Results of this case
study suggest that MC providers should aim to construct a transparent and evident
co-design process. How the structure of a co-design process and the outer
appearance of a store can be improved, is shown exemplarily within the experi-
ment. Subdividing the conﬁguration task into minor steps that follow a speciﬁc
order is supposed to create value. Customers can concentrate on the co-design
process and get a better overview about the whole co-design process. Concerning
the outer appearance of a store, it appears promising to organize the assortment’s
structure. Results suggest that it is crucial to ensure that customers are able to
handle the amount of visual stimuli. Assigning attributes to superior categories and
thereby reducing the amount of presented items promise added value for both
customers and providers.

But, due to the nature of experiments, the generalizability of these results is
limited. Since this study represents a ﬁrst experiment on effects of designing more
customer-friendly co-design processes in ofﬂine environments, it was not possible
to control all determinants and factors. We carefully selected the factors to be
manipulated. However, we cannot rule out any interaction or confounding effects
between the included factors or with other factors that were not taken into account.
Further research is necessary to get a better understanding about effects and
determinants of co-design processes and how they can be designed more customer-
oriented. The study could be repeated containing a within-subject design where
participants compare both the co-design processes. Furthermore, for the sake of
generalizability, additional experiments should be carried out within other product
categories and different markets. Furthermore, it should be displayed whether
results can be transferred to the business-to-business context, where consumers
have a deeper insight into product attributes due to their professional expertise.

Mechatronic Behavior Analysis
of a Customized Manufacturing Cell
Paryanto, Matthias Brossog, Jochen Merhof and Jörg Franke
Abstract Analyzing the mechatronic behavior of a manufacturing cell used in a
customized manufacturing process is a difﬁcult task with numerous obstacles.
Therefore, a method that can be easily used for developing and optimizing a
customized manufacturing cell, i.e., universal contacting module (UCM) cell, for
the in-circuit testing of electronic modules is desired. In this paper, we present a
convenient method using multi-domain simulation tools for analyzing the mech-
atronic behavior of the UCM cell. The UCM cell, which consists of mechatronic
components such as a six-axis industrial robot and conveyor systems, were suc-
cessfully modeled, simulated, and validated under several payloads. This work
also presents a modeling procedure that can be applied by system engineers with a
basic background in control systems for analyzing the mechatronic behavior of
manufacturing cell components.

1 Introduction
The need for product customization drives the manufacturing industry to search for
an effective and efﬁcient method for the development of ﬂexible manufacturing
cells. Unlike a mass production system that produces only a few variants of the
product, industry requires attention to many product variants that are produced for
a short period of time [1]. Therefore, a customized manufacturing cell should be
able to be used for several variants of a product at the same time. Furthermore, a

manufacturing cell itself is a complex mechatronic system, which consists of
mechanical, electrical, and automatic control systems. This leads to the develop-
ment of a customized manufacturing cell as a complex task with many obstacles.
The most powerful method that has been commonly used by industries and
researchers for developing and analyzing mechatronic workcells is a modeling and
simulation approach [2, 3]. Many papers about the simulation of manufacturing
cells have been published; however, most of them are still based on a speciﬁc
physical domain. This makes the analysis and optimization processes time-con-
suming and cost-intensive. On the other hand, most simulation tools that are
already used in the market for analyzing a mechatronic system are relatively
expensive. To address that issue, we use the free multi-domain simulation tool,
OpenModelica,1 and the commercial package, Wolfram SystemModeler,2 for
developing and analyzing the mechatronic behavior of UCM cell components.
The UCM3 cell is a comprehensive test platform for testing electronic devices,
which is used for checking electronic modules (printed circuit boards). This cell
consists of a six-axis industrial robot with special grippers, two small conveyor
systems, two UCM platforms for in-circuit testing and functional testing of elec-
tronic components, as well as a hot function test module (see Fig. 1). The inter-
esting issue concerning this cell is how to expand the application of the UCM for
other electronic components that have different weights, and to choose suitable
parameters to optimize the process. Therefore, the modeling of the UCM cell
components is performed under several payload weights. Thus, we can choose the
right parameters for various UCM operations.
Accordingly, the aims of this research are to analyze the system performance of
UCM cell components (a six-axis industrial robot and a conveyor system) under
different payloads. Furthermore, we used the results from this research for

analyzing the energy consumption of a manufacturing system, especially for the
six-axis industrial robot. This paper also presents the modeling procedure of
mechatronics systems for system engineers with a basic background in control
systems using multi-domain software tools. In addition, a comparative study in
OpenModelica and Wolfram SystemModeler is discussed at the end of this paper.
Both OpenModelica and Wolfram SystemModeler are simulation tools based on
the Modelica language, which provide a wide variety of mechatronics libraries.
These simulation tools are appropriate for simulating a manufacturing cell, which
is a multi-domain system. Modelica itself is an open and object-oriented language;
hence, the researcher can access the programming code and develop or modify a
model library when it does not coincide with the user requirements [4].
There are three main contributions from this paper. The ﬁrst contribution is a
convenient modeling method that can be used by system engineers for developing,
analyzing, and optimizing a customized manufacturing cell. The second contri-
bution is a dynamic behavior analysis of mechatronic systems that is part of the
manufacturing cell. Results show that the mechatronic behavior (i.e., speed
response, acceleration, electric current) is strongly inﬂuenced by the payload of the
UCM cell workpiece. This data can be used as a reference to choose and optimize
the operating parameters of the UCM cell components while improving the pro-
ductivity of the cell. In addition, we also provide a comparative study between free
multi-domain simulation tools and commercial ones. The result of this compara-
tive study will give useful information to system engineers for choosing the right
simulation tool in their project.
2 Related Work
Simulation is a key technology for shortening the development time of customized
mechatronic systems. This is because it can be used effectively to verify and
analyze the characteristics of physical systems [5]. In this study, we focused on
analyzing the effect of payloads on the mechatronic behavior of a six-axis
industrial robot and a conveyor system, both parts of the UCM cell. The mecha-
tronic behavior in this research refers to the dynamics and electric behavior of
UCM components.
Concerning the payload’s effect on the dynamics of an industrial robot, there
have been many studies conducted. Several researchers present the analysis of
initial parameters of the industrial robot load in order to improve the dynamic
accuracy of the robot. It was found that the mass, inertia, and the location of the
center of the robot’s payload are important factors that inﬂuence the robot
dynamics [6]. Another study also shows the payload inﬂuences the robot’s per-
formance and its repeatability [7]. In the conveyor system, the weight of the
payload strongly inﬂuences the performance and dynamic behavior [8]. However,
most of these studies are based on an experimental investigations or mathematical
calculations to analyze the effect of payloads. For system engineers, these methods
Mechatronic Behavior Analysis of a Customized Manufacturing Cell
391

are inconvenient and time-consuming. Moreover, the use of multi-domain simu-
lation tools for mechatronic behavior is still rare.
Regarding the energy consumption analysis of mechatronic systems, much
research has been conducted, such as in [9, 10]. Nevertheless, analyses based on
payload and multi-domain modeling and simulation methods are still limited.
3 The Digital Model of the UCM Cell
In this section, we describe the modeling of the UCM cell components: A six-axis
industrial robot and conveyor systems.
3.1 Modeling the Six-Axis Industrial Robot
The industrial robot used in the UCM cell is the Motoman MH5L.4 It is a small
robot platform, which has a 5-kg payload and is commonly used in a wide range of
applications, such as packaging, material handling, machine tending and dis-
pensing [11]. While modeling, parameters and speciﬁcations (i.e., the maximum
speed of every axis, and the weight and inertia of the robot structure) used for the
model of this robot are based on the information from [11]. However, because not
all robot parameters are available in that reference, the initial parameters from the
Modelica library and from the measurement data have also been used. As can be
shown in Fig. 2, the robot model consists of path planning, six axes, and the robot
structure.
Modeling the robotic system started with creating a motor drive model on each
of the robot axes. Every motor drive model consists of axis path planning, a
control bus, driver, and servo motor. In this work, the model of the servo motor is
based on [12]. Some of these class models are available in the Modelica library.
However, we had to choose a correct model with the right parameters because the
simulation results are very dependent on how appropriately the model represents
the real system. The second step for industrial robot modeling is creating the
mechanical structure of the robot. In this step, we use Multi-body components,
such as revolute joint and body mass. The next steps are deﬁning the path-planning
model and reference point for the robot’s position. For the robot’s path planning,
we use a PTP2 model, which instructed the robot to move as fast as possible from
the starting position to the end position under speciﬁc kinematic constraints [4].
Finally, the veriﬁcation of every model is needed in order to ensure that each robot
component model represents those of the real world. The equations and the
parameters should be managed and ensured so as to have the same number. Thus, a

lot of time and effort are required, especially when using the free multi-domain
simulation tool like OpenModelica.
3.2 Modeling the Conveyor System
Modeling and simulation of the conveyor system leads to a better understanding of
the conveyor’s mechatronic behavior, which helps in the development of suitable
controllers and in choosing the best operation parameters. As shown in Fig. 3, the
conveyor system consists of a PID controller, a motor, and a conveyor structure.
While modeling, we started with making a motor and PID controller model and
then formed a conveyor structure. Similar to the industrial robot’s modeling,
veriﬁcation is conducted in the ﬁnal step. In order to choose suitable controller
parameters, we used the Ziegler–Nichols method. Based on this method, we deﬁne
Kp: 1.176, Ki: 0.025, and Kd: 0.00625. Compared to other turning methods, the
Ziegler–Nichols method is relative simple and widely used in industries to give
better approximations of the controller; therefore, it is suitable for a systems
engineer with a basic knowledge of control systems. The Ziegler–Nichols method
is explained in detail in [13].
To model the motor, we modiﬁed the Modelica library components’ parameters
and initial values corresponding to the real motor. Generally, the parameters of
the motor’s model are based on information from [14]. The conveyor structures
used as transport systems consist of several components from rotational and

translational packages. This structure consists of inertia, reduction gears, bearing
frictions, a backlash, spring damper, support friction, and conveyor load. To
represent real conditions, a spring damper is modeled using the coefﬁcients c: 0.25
and d: 7. Loads representing the electronic specimens are simulated under several
weights, from 1 to 5 kg.
4 Simulation Results and Discussion
4.1 Simulation Results from the Six-Axis Industrial Robot
In this work, the robot is simulated from position A to B (see Fig. 1) with a
payload from 1 to 5 kg. The analysis focuses on the sixth axis, due to its high
vibration. The results from this simulation are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. In these
ﬁgures, we plotted torque, acceleration, and position of the sixth axis as well as
current of the all robot’s motors. As can be shown in Fig. 4, the robot’s payload
has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the robot’s dynamic behavior. Heavier payloads lead
to an increase in the oscillation of robot’s torque (see Fig. 4a). Thus, we see that
changing the UCM specimen, which has a different weight than the existing one,
results in varying robotic torque. The values from these graphs can be used as a
reference to tune the UCM operation parameters in order to improve the dynamic
accuracy of the robot. Moreover, they can also be used to verify the control system
of the robot.
As shown in Fig. 4c, every kilogram of payload contributes to a mere deviation
of about 0.2 milliradians. Although Fig. 4a and b show that the weight of the
payload alters the torque and the acceleration, though the accuracy of the robot is
not affected. Thus, from the simulation results, it is evident that the robot’s system
performs sufﬁciently and robustly for payload variations.

4.2 Validation and Electrical Behavior of the Industrial
Robot
A comparison between the simulation’s results and actual measurements is used to
validate and analyze the accuracy of the simulation model. In this comparative
study, we focused on the electrical behavior of the industrial robot. From the
simulation method, we obtained a value of current, resistance, and voltage from
the motor of every robot axis. Thus, from the simulation data, we calculated the
robot power. While using actual measurements, we obtained data for the current,
voltage, and power from the robot. We used the value of the current to conduct a
comparative study since this value is directly collected from both of these meth-
ods. Comparison results are presented in Fig. 5. The deviation of the robot’s
current between measurement and simulation is less than 15 %. The deviation is
caused by the robot control unit that not modeled since this component is outside
of the robot structure. When we add the current value from the robot control unit to
the simulation results, it matches well with the measurement values.
Based on Fig. 5, the robot’s payload strongly inﬂuences the value of the
motor’s current. The varying payload results in a different current value for every
robot axis. Therefore, this data can be used as an indicator for analyzing the energy
efﬁciency of manufacturing components since the current is closely related to
power consumption.

4.3 Simulation Results from the Conveyor System
As shown in Fig. 6, the dynamic of the conveyor depends on the weight of the
specimens. A heavier specimen reduces the speed and the acceleration response
(see Fig. 6a, b). A specimen with 5 kg of weight needs 3 s to achieve a steady
response, and with 1 kg of weight, it only needs 1 s. Thereby, the control system
of the conveyor has not adapted quickly enough to the heavy specimen. However,
these conditions are acceptable when used as a transport system in a UCM cell
since the acceleration response is not as high. The simulation results (see Fig. 6c)
also show that the torque of the motor is affected by the weight of the specimen.
Similar to the speed responses, a heavier specimen reduces the response. However,
this condition generally shows that the UCM cell can be used not only for mon-
itoring a single variant of PCBs but also for other variants that have different
weights.
Simulation results also show that the backlash and friction coefﬁcient of the
conveyor damper have an inﬂuence on the speed response. Therefore, for precise
applications, a modiﬁcation of the damper is needed.
4.4 Comparative Study
Based on our experience with this work, we present a comparative study between
the open-source Modelica tool OpenModelica version 1.9.0 and the commercial
tool Wolfram SystemModeler 3.0.2 in this sub-chapter. In this comparative study,
we focus on the user interface, simulation results, modeling deﬁciencies, and
simulation time.
• User interface: Both of these tools provide a software template/layout in the
same primary theme. A user familiar with OpenModelica will easily adapt to the
Fig. 5 Current in all robot
axis motor under several
payloads
396
Paryanto et al.

Wolfram SystemModeler template. This template is divided into two main
windows: modeling and simulation. However, Wolfram SystemModeler pro-
vides a function that allows the user to more easily create, edit, and simulate the
model. Furthermore, Wolfram SystemModeler offers more interactive tools to
plot and edit the simulation results.
• Simulation results: In this study, we used the DASSL solver, 2-s stop-time for
the robotic simulation and a 6-s stop-time for the conveyor system simulation,
0.00001 for tolerance, and an interval setting of 500. From the simulation
results, both of these tools produced the same value of graphs.
• Modeling: From the authors’ experience, using OpenModelica is relative difﬁ-
cult. With each new model, we always had to verify and check the equations,
parameters, and variables. Moreover, some bugs exist in the OpenModelica
Compiler.
• Simulation time: For the simulations, we used a standard PC with Intel Core2
Quad processor and 4-GB RAM. Generally, as can be shown in Table 1, when
using OpenModelica, we needed more simulation time than when using
Wolfram SystemModeler. However, this table shows that the time difference is
less than 2 min; therefore, for a systems engineer, this issue is hardly crucial.

From this comparative study, we know that for modeling complex mechatronic
systems, using a commercial tool is recommended, but for modeling a simple one,
OpenModelica is powerful enough. Since OpenModelica is available freely, it is
recommended for a system engineering that just wants to know a basic knowledge
of mechatronic systems modeling.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we present a method for the mechatronic behavior analysis of a
customized manufacturing cell that is used in electronic production. The method
implements the object-oriented and multi-domain simulation tools based on the
Modelica language. Using this method, the UCM cell components, such as an
industrial robot and a conveyor system, were successfully modeled, simulated, and
validated. The procedure for modeling and simulating UCM cell components was
also provided in this paper. This procedure can be used to understand the mech-
atronic behavior for the development and optimization of a manufacturing cell.
The results of the investigation show that the weights of the specimen inﬂuence
the mechatronic behavior and the performance of the UCM cell components, such
as speed, acceleration, accuracy, and torque as well as their electrical behavior.
However, from the results, we know that a UCM cell can be used to test several
variants of specimen that have different weights. Also, using the results, we were
able to optimize the performance and deﬁne a strategy for low energy consumption
in a UCM cell.

Modelling and Organising
Customer-Driven Business Processes
in a Mass Customisation Environment
Hans-Henrik Hvolby, Chris Martin and Heidi Dreyer
Abstract The techniques of mass customisation in the manufacturing area are
being challenged by more recent trends of made to order processes. This paper
reviews the relevant literature dealing with the challenges of determining speciﬁc
made to order processes. The researchers then use a case study approach to gain
insights into what are the new demands on planners and schedulers. Two case
studies in Denmark are highlighted. The researchers found that the tasks of
planning business processes in the order ﬂow is likely change in the future as
increased adaptation to customer ordering takes place, which will force changes to
staff training and company re-organisation.

In the previous industrial revolution, the custom-made industry went through a
transition of standardisation to enable affordable prised products by use of mass
production. As an example, there were more than 23,000 custom shoe-making

establishments in the US in the early 1900, and some twenty years later, barely a
few hundred remained, now producing standard-sized shoes [1]. In the 1980s, the
competition from low-cost countries put a high pressure on Western industry
which led to a much higher degree of customised products. A survey by Lampel
and Minzberg [1] found that on average only twenty articles on customisation
appeared annually from 1971 to 1980, whereas the number was 234 from 1981 to
1990 and 2,324 from 1990 to 1996.
When changing from mass- to customer-speciﬁc production, more departments
are involved in order processing [2, 3]. The recent shift towards order-speciﬁc
customisation has increased the need to control the order process through the
administrative business processes in order to secure that the individual orders are
delivered on-time and at the right place. Furthermore, companies need to operate
within effective supply chain networks that are highly responsive, ﬂexible, inno-
vative and dynamic, while at the same time compressed in order to be able to
respond to pressures such as cost reductions, product development, high quality,
value-adding products, frequent, on-time deliveries and service [4–6].
In the following possible improvements, options regarding resource consump-
tion, delivery performance and lead-time will be argued when improving business
processes and especially by coordinating the activities in the order process and
aligning the information ﬂow and use of ICT.
2 Problem Deﬁnition
Through the experience of projects in co-operation with industry, a number of
general problems related to the interaction and coordination in the order processes
of companies have been identiﬁed. Generally speaking, the lack of updated and
real-time information on for example drawings in production and before this the
replenishment needs and the lack of materials necessary in the ﬁnal assembly of
goods are on-going problems for manufacturers. In many engineering industry, the
customers are allowed to change the product speciﬁcation close up to production
start and in some cases even after the production has stared. Companies accept all
kinds of customer-speciﬁc changes, even if this means rework or disposal of
previously produced or purchased items. The ‘‘customer is king’’ so the saying
goes and many companies do not leave the customer to either select between
possible options or else to be charged for the actual costs of the desired product
changes. As a consequence, a large number of people in the product development
department, purchase, planning and production departments are occupied with
customer-speciﬁc changes. Furthermore, the number of production orders is
growing as batch sizes are reduced. In total, man-hours are increased due to
changes caused by customisation.
The product development department in many companies has become a bot-
tleneck because, besides the development of new products, it has to take part in the
adaptation of customer orders. Often, the department is not included in the overall
402
H.-H. Hvolby et al.

resource plan and therefore is constantly behind the production schedule. Errors in
drawings and bill-of-materials are not corrected because of the high workload of
staff. In the course of time, the workforce in the production department does not
report errors because they are not corrected, and a vicious circle is created.
Some information systems have been integrated over time. One example is
enterprise resource management (ERP) where ﬁnancial, manufacturing, shop ﬂoor
control, scheduling and human resource management are integrated [7, 8], whereas
few examples are seen to integrate ERP with, e.g. manufacturing execution sys-
tems (MES) and computer-aided design (CAD) systems. This means that bill-of-
materials from the CAD system in most cases are entered into the ERP system
manually. This is less problematic in a batch environment but highly problematic
in a mass customisation environment.
We deﬁne this situation as a problem of efﬁcient manufacturing planning,
embedding, organising and coordinating the various processes and functions to the
continuously updated status of the order. This is a under research area where the
literature contributions still is scarce [9]. The conducted case studies have revealed
too many changes of responsibility in the order ﬂow and the lack of quality
information which causes signiﬁcant errors and consequent increased workloads.
Too much time is spent on searching for information or correcting information as
the individual links in the order chain are not fully aware of demands from the rest
of the chain.
3 Modelling Customer Order Business Processes
One of the strategies to assist manufacturers in this area is the modelling of business
processes. The idea to consider the business processes as a chain is not new. vom
Brocke and Rosemann [10] has illustrated the evolution of business process from
work simpliﬁcation towards lean supported by information systems (Fig. 1).
In 1985, Michael Porter introduced his ‘‘Generic Value Chain’’ consisting of
ﬁve primary activities: ‘‘Inbound Logistics’’, ‘‘Operations’’, ‘‘Outbound Logis-
tics’’, ‘‘Marketing and Sales’’ and ‘‘Service’’ [11]. Besides, the ﬁve primary
activities four support activities are speciﬁed as ‘‘Firm Infrastructure’’, ‘‘Human
Resource Management’’, ‘‘Technology Development’’ and ‘‘Procurement’’. Por-
ter’s Generic Value Chain, however, is different from the Activity Chain Model at
several points.
Porter only considers one chain for the whole company and places the activity
‘‘Order Processing’’ in the primary activity ‘‘Outbound Logistics’’ and ‘‘Produc-
tion’’ in the primary activity ‘‘Operations’’. As ‘‘Outbound Logistics’’ is placed
after ‘‘Operations’’, Porter assumes that the product is produced before the order is
processed. In other words, the Generic Value Chain is oriented towards production
to stock. This view is also supported by the fact that the ‘‘Marketing and Sales’’
activity is placed after ‘‘Outbound Logistics’’ and thus not integrated with the
production and logistics processes.
Modelling and Organising Customer-Driven Business Processes
403

As a further development of the Generic Value Chain, Hammer and Champy
[12] introduced the business process reengineering (BPR) concept in 1993
bringing customer focus and integration as possible means to increase effective-
ness. BPR is based on a total reorganisation of business processes in the company,
whereas the Activity Chain Model is focused on the customer order processes.
As discussed in Sect. 1, customised production involves a large number of
departments in a functionally organised company. This makes it very difﬁcult for
the company in general and for individual employees to obtain the actual
knowledge of customer order processes. One purpose of modelling customer-
speciﬁc order processes is to analyse and communicate the obtained knowledge
throughout the company. Subsequently, the model is used to improve current
business processes.
To analyse the customer-speciﬁc order processes, we recommend a bottom-up
approach where all sub-tasks, tasks and information processing performed in
connection with customer orders are described. This is done by pursuing orders
right from customer contact until the product is delivered and paid. It is important
to distinguish among the different types of orders in the company such as standard
orders, special orders, urgent orders and spare part orders.
Also a distinction between customer-speciﬁc tasks and general/basic tasks is
relevant in most companies, especially to identify the relevance (value) of tasks
and the cost of customer-speciﬁc order processes. This distinction may be difﬁcult,
as some activities may be adding value for the company even though the customer
is not willing to pay for the activity (order winning vs. order qualiﬁer criteria), for
example product documentation or the registration of time consumption in
administration and production [13]. Schmid et al. [14] deﬁnes non-value-adding
information as ‘‘information which is not needed instantly or not needed at all’’.
Schmid points out that non-value-adding information (called waste information)
will lead to non-value activities such as generation, handling and storage.
Fig. 1 Illustration of the evolution of business process from work simpliﬁcation towards lean
supported by information systems [10]
404
H.-H. Hvolby et al.

Therefore, we make a distinction between customer value-adding activities for
which the customer is willing to pay and internal value-adding activities.
It is often relevant to supply the analysis of order processes with the analysis of
tasks and information processing regarding the materials ﬂow from reception of
raw materials and components through production and assembly to the delivery of
ﬁnal products. This analysis focuses on information controlling the materials ﬂow
(such as requisitions, production orders) and on activities (such as receipt and
dispatch of materials to/from suppliers and customers, receipt and delivery of
materials inside the company). This analysis also gives a thorough knowledge of
production processes and of planning procedures on the shop ﬂoor. We have
observed different objectives in the central planning and in the shop ﬂoor planning
in many companies, e.g. where central planning focuses on customer orders
whereas shop ﬂoor planning focuses on utilisation of capacities.
Further, it is important to examine time consumption for several reasons: (a) to
evaluate which costs are related to orders and which are related to development.
(b) to improve planning and gain information about time consumption per unit and
bottlenecks and (c) to evaluate the possible proﬁt of rationalisation.
4 Case Study
One case company, located in Denmark, is a typical example of a company where
customers have a substantial inﬂuence on the working procedures of order man-
agement. An increasing number of customer-speciﬁc demands and inquiries cause
more work in order management which results in an augmented time consumption
of white-collar employees. Some 80 employees work at the case company, and
order management is handled in a criss-cross fashion across existing departments
and then tasks solved by the departments. All departments are more or less involved
in the (nearly) 150 orders, and in the unknown number of inquiries and offers which
are dealt with each year. Furthermore, the case company develops products
intended for customer-speciﬁc alterations far into the order and production process.
A preliminary analysis within the company showed that the time consumption
per order was far higher than indicated by costs estimates and that the time
consumption overall was increasing, especially for exports. The preliminary
analysis provided a basis for a discussion of the company’s assessment of time
consumption per order and how this has evolved over the years during the tran-
sition from being a mass producer to a being a customised order producer.
A more detailed analysis of order management showed that the processing of an
order was unclear and involved transfer of responsibility many times. This was
supported by later analyses that indicated large time consumption in order man-
agement. Moreover, several problems were revealed during the analysis: Drawings
were not available in time and product speciﬁcations were often completed late in the
order processing. Much overtime work and many rush jobs were caused by customer
changes. And ﬁnally, the errors created a lot of manual paper work and double ﬁling.
Modelling and Organising Customer-Driven Business Processes
405

An example of one of the more analyses carried out at the company was an
analysis of the time consumption of white-collar employees. The purpose of the
analysis was to establish the time consumption for each activity: which depart-
ments and employees were involved and how much time was spent on value-
adding and not value-adding activities. A result of this analysis was among others,
that too many departments and employees were involved in each activity, which
means that it was necessary to restructure the business processes and the
organisation.
The company’s order management system was analysed, and the connection
between information and activities was documented by IDEF diagrams. Inspired
by Laudon and Laudon [15], key business processes and key measures were
identiﬁed and illustrated. A large number of forms had been added during time,
and a closer analysis of the system led to a 50 % reduction in the number of forms
used. This ﬁrst evaluation of collected information in the manual system was an
important part of the later reduction in time consumption in order management.
Order management was split into well-deﬁned and limited activities and sub-
tasks. Hereafter, the activities were regrouped in other or new sub-tasks and
activities. Through working with reorganising order management, it became evi-
dent that more employees carried out a number of sub-tasks which could advan-
tageously be grouped in new tasks. Consequently, more sub-tasks were combined
in larger tasks. This combination reduced the number of transfers of responsibility,
and at the same time, it required that the individual employee had more qualiﬁ-
cations. Further, deﬁning the contents of each activity is a good way of revealing
old routines and sub-systems which are no longer used, or worse, which are carried
out twice.
The interesting is not alone the possibilities for rationalisation, but also the
knowledge about the contents, size and distribution of sub-tasks which can be used
in further development of order management in the company. Order management
will undoubtedly become a more strategic element if customer-speciﬁc variants are
introduced as a competitive parameter alongside lower prices, shorter lead-time
and higher delivery precision. After the conclusion of this case, the company has
itself launched three big projects in order to further develop the order management.
• Introduction of a new control concept for order management established as
product centres which are organisational units responsible for all customer
relevant tasks. The new control concept has contributed to an improved cus-
tomer contact resulting in a reduction in errors and of time consumption both in
the new product centres and in the head ofﬁce. The saved time in head ofﬁce has
until now been used for development of a new budget system and two new
products.
• Development of a new order speciﬁcation system, which gathered all infor-
mation from existing documents used for specifying an order. The purpose of
this work was to secure quick access to the latest documentation and to reduce
time consumption of activities by 25 %.
406
H.-H. Hvolby et al.

• Development of a new planning system with real-time information on each
order, that is information about changes of plans, lack of authorisation, lack of
materials, lack of capacity and customer speciﬁcations. The purpose of this work
was to improve prioritisation of orders and to supervise consequences of plan
changes.
5 Discussion
The tasks of order management will change radically in future. In brief, mass
customisation will give way to customer-driven manufacturing. The goal will be to
maintain satisfactory utilisation of resources and an acceptable proﬁt with an
increased adaptation to customer-speciﬁc orders and a short and precise time of
delivery. This anticipated strategic oriented change in work pattern will have a
signiﬁcant impact of stafﬁng issues. These trends will mean that the employees of
the future will need to possess various types of skills and qualiﬁcations.
A similar development has taken place in production where self-managed work
teams comply with the new conditions [16]. This change calls for retraining of
employees, and a corresponding re-education will be necessary for employees in
the administration of these new manufacturing techniques. A co-operation between
production groups and administrative groups, perhaps best achieved by organi-
sational structure changes, will hopefully contribute to an improved control in
future.
A feature of the trends in Danish manufacturing over the last three decades has
been improvements in production techniques, production facilities and the intro-
duction of improved business processes. Associated with this trend has been a
move towards order-speciﬁc customisation which has meant the adoption of
streamlined business processes. In this paper, researchers used data gained from
two Danish manufacturing companies that were used as case studies to provide
data. Two major elements of improvement that were found were the coordination
of activities in the order process, and, the associated analysis of the information
ﬂow in the case companies.
6 Conclusion
As production processes have changed so too have the demands placed on the
production designers and schedulers, especially with frequent customer requests.
Many of the information systems in use were not connected to each other leading
to errors and subsequent rework. These new trends put pressures on the current
organisational design attributes. The researchers also found that a number of
activities were adding value to the processes but the customer was not willing to
pay for them. Additionally there had been examples of creeping form ﬁlling. The

researchers predict that order management will change dramatically in the future;
giving rise to different organisational models, and, that supervisors and employees
will have the need for additional training for the increased skill levels demanded.

Multidisciplinary Product Decomposition
and Analysis Based on Design Structure
Matrix Modeling
Tufail Habib
Abstract Design structure matrix (DSM) modeling in complex system design
supports to deﬁne physical and logical conﬁguration of subsystems, components,
and their relationships. This modeling includes product decomposition, identiﬁ-
cation of interfaces, and structure analysis to increase the architectural under-
standing of the system. Since product architecture has broad implications in relation
to product life cycle issues, in this paper, mechatronic product is decomposed into
subsystems and components, and then, DSM model is developed to examine the
extent of modularity in the system and to manage multiple interactions across
subsystems and components. For this purpose, Cambridge advanced modeler
(CAM) software tool is used to develop the system matrix. The analysis of the
product (printer) architecture includes clustering, partitioning as well as structure
analysis of the system. The DSM analysis is helpful to support decisions about
product redesign and modularization.

the decisions about product architecture are relevant to the overall function of the
product, which has broad implications related to product performance, product
change, product variety, component standardization, and manufacturability [1].
According to Ulrich and Eppinger, ‘‘The architecture of a product is the scheme
by which the functional elements of the product are arranged into physical chunks
and by which the chunks interact’’ [2]. Product architecture is thought about in
terms of its modules and decomposing a system into independent parts or modules
that can be treated as logical units [3]. It is the process of rearranging known parts
into new architectures, and it revolves around redesigning the interfaces of key
components to make them more modular in order to achieve a higher level of
system performance in one or various dimensions [4], which is also relevant to
mass customization (MC) in products. The aim of developing and using modules
in product architecture is partly to make it possible to create customized products
for the market and partly to reduce the number of variants which have to be dealt
with internally in the company and thus to reduce complexity and cost [5].
Complexity is involved in the design and development of mechatronic systems
due to number of subsystems, components and their interactions, and other aspects.
According to Weber, complexity is an attribute of a system and can be divided into
various aspects such as numerical, relational, variational, disciplinary, and orga-
nization complexity [6]. These aspects can be the number of subsystems, com-
ponents and their relations, and variants as important characteristics of complexity.
The degree of complexity is also relevant to the number of disciplines and the
distribution of work [7]. In the context of mechatronic systems, designers and
engineers need to deal with various aspects of complexity. Market requirements
are also attributed to complexity due to customization that requires number of
variants in products. Interaction of disciplines and distribution of work is also an
issue especially for multidisciplinary products. In order to address these issues,
various approaches and analysis tools are used; one of such tools is design
structure matrix (DSM) to model complex products.
The DSM is a network modeling tool to represent the components of a system
and their interactions, therefore, highlighting the systems architecture [8]. DSM
ﬁrst introduced by Steward [9] followed by many authors in different ﬁelds with a
range of applications to product and organization domains. Various organizations
and industry such as BMW, Audi, Hilti, NASA, Boeing, General motors, Intel,
Kodak, Mozilla, Timken and BP etc., used it for various issues relevant to product,
organizational, and process architecture modeling. In the domain of product
development, the component-based DSM could be combined with the task and
team DSMs to include the modularization in the rest of the design process planning
using multi-domain DSM [10]. The method leaves more business-oriented factors
and product functionality up to the designer’s judgment after, ﬁrst, simplifying the
architecture by decomposition and interface management. Therefore, it is impor-
tant to raise the following research question:
How the functional elements in a product can be decomposed into components
by identifying their interrelationships to assess the degree of modularity as there is
410

always a trade-off between modules and market requirements on one hand, and
functionality and performance on the other in mechatronic products/systems?
The complexity in multi-domain products requires decomposing them into
subsystem and components, to guide the design requirements and to identify the
solution space for functional improvements. This work implement component-
based DSM (using printer as an example) in order to address the issue of system
decomposition and interface management. The outcome of this paper is product
decomposition to increase the architectural understanding of the multi-domain
system, to examine the degree of modularity in the system, and to manage
interactions across subsystems and components.
2 Methodology
In this methodology through system decomposition, complex products can be
decomposed into subsystems, components, and functions. A modeling tool such
as DSM is used in a software tool to represent the system elements and their
interactions in order to generate the system architecture. In this example, the
architecture is used to identify modules in the system, manage interactions across
subsystems and components, and structure analysis results are presented.
Figure 1 represents an overall approach in this paper that is based on [8]. After
system decomposition, the relationships between system components are identi-
ﬁed. For the printer case, data about interfaces and physical structure are collected
from product manuals, product videos, and physical observation of the product. In
the next step, all the elements of the system are placed along rows and columns in
a matrix display format. For this purpose, Cambridge advanced modeler (CAM)
software tool [11] is used to develop the system matrix. Finally, the analysis of the
system architecture (DSM form) is performed (e.g., clustering, partitioning, and
displaying the elements in a network diagram). This DSM can be further extended
to multiple domain matrices (MDM) for analyzing issues related to process and
organization; however, this paper is limited to product architecture DSM.

3 System Decomposition and Identiﬁcation of Interfaces
3.1 System Decomposition
In general, main subsystems of the printers are image-formation system, paper
feed and delivery system, scanning system, formatter and control system, and fuser
system. In the printer example, other functional elements such as duplexing unit
and envelops’ feeder systems are considered as optional systems to simplify the
DSM model.
3.2 Identify Interfaces between System Components
The following types of interfaces are identiﬁed in the printer system:
• Physical connections
• Material (e.g., toner, paper)
• Energy ﬂows (e.g., mechanical rotary, electrical, thermal, chemical, etc.)
• Information ﬂows (e.g., image data, sensor signals, and actuator commands).
Spatial interfaces indicate that physical adjacency is needed for alignment, ori-
entation, serviceability, assembly, and weight. For example, scanning mirror and
focusing lens are in physical contact with scanning motor, when scanning mirror is
rotated by motor, LASER beam reﬂects off the mirror, through a set of focusing
lenses that is directed on photosensitive drum. A spatial connection between
scanning motor and mirror is established in order to reﬂect beam on photosensitive
drum. The alignment and orientation of the drum and charging roller are the
necessary features to create a uniform negative potential on the drum surface that
is necessary for the image development and its subsequent transfer to paper. Thus,
a physical interface between charging roller and photosensitive drum is identiﬁed.
During the fusing process, the toner is fused into the paper by heat and pressure
to produce a permanent image. The paper passes between a heated fusing roller
and a pressure roller. This melts the toner and presses it into the paper. The quality
of the fusing process depends on heat and pressure produced by fusing roller and
pressure roller and their interaction with paper. Thus, a spatial interface is created
between paper and fusing roller as well as paper and pressure roller.
Material interfaces indicate a functional requirement related to transferring
mass ﬂows such as toner and paper. For example, the developing cylinder must be
able to attract toner, and the toner must obtain negative surface charge as the
developing cylinder is connected to power supply. Thus, developing cylinder
depends on power supply to be able to attract toner, while the toner must be
attracted by this process. This results in a symmetrical dependency.
Energy
ﬂow indicates a functional requirement related to transferring
mechanical energy, heat energy, vibration energy, electrical energy, noise, etc.

T. Habib

In printer example, for instance, the variation in the print density depends on the
DC bias given to the developing cylinder, which causes more or less toner to be
attracted to the developing cylinder, hence developing cylinder and power supply
is related by (electrical) energy. Similarly, motor and drive assemblies are related
by power transmission due to mechanical energy. Heat transfer from heater to
cooling fan is kind of (thermal) energy interface. Although energy interfaces such
as chemical, vibrations are also present in this kind of systems, however, they are
not considered in this example.
Information interface indicates a functional requirement related to transferring
sensor signals or controls, image data, and actuator commands. For instance,
information about LASER beam is send to central processing unit (CPU) by the
beam detect (BD) sensor; these two are related by information interface. Similarly,
information about image formation is transferred from control panel to formatter
CPU and is highlighted by information relation. When the power switch of the
printer is turned on and the printer enters in the standby mode, the CPU outputs the
signals to drive the loads such as laser diode, motors, and solenoids, based on
the print commands and the image data input from the external device. CPU and
the loads are connected by information (image data and actuator commands)
dependency.
3.3 Develop Design Structure Matrix
The tool that is used to handle relations between items is widely known as the
DSM. As shown in Fig. 2, a square matrix represents the elements in a system (the
shaded cells along the diagonal) and their interactions (the off-diagonal marks).
There are two possibilities to read the matrix. One can read across an element’s
row to see its inputs and down its columns to see its outputs although the opposite
convention, the transpose of the matrix, is also used. For instance, element D
receives inputs from elements B and C and providing an output to element B, as
shown in Fig. 2.
To model product architecture, the DSM elements are product components and
their interactions are the interfaces between the components. In structure analysis,
DSM elements are called as nodes and their interactions as edges of a system.

3.3.1 DSM Model
The composite DSM (comprising multiple interfaces) model using CAM is dis-
played in Fig. 3 that shows the decomposition of the printer system into eight
subsystems and 38 functional components. Four types of interfaces such as P-M-E-I
(physical, material, energy, and information) are indicated in the DSM. Eight
subsystems and two optional systems are discussed in Sect. 3.1.
4 Results and Analysis
Once the DSM model is developed, the analysis of the system can be performed
with the following types:
• Clustering
• Partitioning
• Structure analysis.
Initially, a DSM based only on physical interfaces is analyzed by applying clus-
tering algorithm using CAM. The results, as illustrated in Fig. 4, identify seven of
the subsystems as somehow modular, as having more interfaces among compo-
nents in each subsystem. These modular subsystems are scanning system, paper
feed system, tray assembly, LASER and BD system, and paper delivery and fuser
systems. As only physical connections are used, there are no interfaces with ele-
ments such as image formation and control software, and they are placed inde-
pendently in the model. The DSM also shows the remaining subsystems as more
spatially distributed. For instance, printer control system and printer drive
assembly are more functionally distributed across the printer system, or in other
words, their structure is more integrative than modular one.
To analyze composite DSM, partitioning algorithm is applied to it. The CAM
tool uses loop-searching algorithm, which basically tries to accumulate depen-
dencies on one side of the matrix diagonal. If this alignment cannot be realized
completely, the partitioning tries to arrange dependencies as close as possible to
the diagonal. Partitioning is also used to minimize the size of the feedback loops
(A feedback loop consists of two or more nodes of a DSM, which are interlocked
sequentially by edges and reciprocally inﬂuence each other [7]). Complex struc-
tures possess feedback loops that do not allow an alignment of edges at one side of
the matrix diagonal. Partitioning then tries to align a minimum of edges below and
all edges as close as possible to the diagonal.
In general, partitioning can provide information about the existence of feedback
loops and can determine the strongly connected parts implied in a structure.
Groups of nodes can also be identiﬁed that are suitable for modular design.
However, it is not able to provide information about feedback loops in speciﬁc
nodes. In Fig. 5, interfaces of the main controller, power supply, and printer drive
414

assembly are sparser than the other elements. The remaining elements are rela-
tively close to the diagonal that can be considered as possible module candidates.
The reason for not accumulating near the diagonal is due to many interfaces shared
by some of the elements in a system.

The designer can draw useful insights from the DSM architecture after clus-
tering the elements in composite DSM. In Fig 6, the DSM model identiﬁed four of
the subsystems as somehow modular, as more interfaces among components in
each subsystem. These modular subsystems are scanning system, paper feed
system, and paper delivery and fuser systems. The DSM also shows the remaining
subsystems as more distributed. These systems are printer control system, main
motor, and printer drive assembly that are more functionally distributed across the
printer system, or in other words, their structure is more integrative than modular
one.

4.1 Structure Representation and Analysis
The network view is used to visualize the dependency information in the detailed
printer system; each line represents a connection in the DSM, from this diagram
elements with more integrated connections can be visualized, though it is hard to
read especially when there are many components and interfaces. In the network
view as shown in Fig. 7, power supply, main controller, and printer drive assembly
are more connected than other elements.
From the network view, each node represents the components and assemblies in
the printer architecture; on average, more than one interface is present with each
component; it also points toward the functions performed by each component in
the architecture as is distributed. According to Ulrich’s deﬁnition of modular
architecture having one-to-one mapping between functions and components,
modular structures must have a smaller function-to-component ratio than integral
products. Though the function-to-component ratio is not calculated in this case, but
the distribution of the interfaces is much higher, that must be reduced to increase
the degree of modularity in the architecture.
The attainability in a structure is measured to assess the change in any node and
its impact on other nodes in the structure. Attainability of a node is the ratio of the
number of nodes it reaches to the maximum number of nodes it could reach
Fig. 7 Structure representation in network view

theoretically. In the proposed example, the attainability in the nodes such as CPU
control, printer drive assembly, power supply is relatively more than the remaining
nodes of the system. A high valve of attainability means that many other nodes can
be affected by any change in the node that is considered for any change. In general,
the attainability in the nodes must be reduced in order to be able to make structural
changes or redesign the architecture, though other criteria such as paths and
lengths of the nodes are also relevant for proper characterization of the nodes.
Clustering is a measure, or a heuristic, to deﬁne the level of connectivity
between a group of people or components. The clustering coefﬁcient (CC) is the
measure of this level of connectivity [12]. In the printer example, scanning mirror
is having two edges and both are closely connected; hence, its CC is equal to 1.
While cylindrical lens is having one edge and no other connections, therefore, its
CC is 0. In Fig. 8, CC for most of the nodes is close to center that point’s medium
level of connectivity in nodes.
Table 1 represents the total number of clusters formed, number of nodes, edges
and their connections, nonzero fraction (NZF) as well as singular value modularity
index (SMI) in the structure. There are in total four clusters, all the nodes are
connected with some kind of interface. The SMI and NZF are introduced by Refs.
[10, 13], where NZF, is the fraction of nonzero entries without diagonal values,
that can be computed as,
Non zero fraction ¼
PN
i¼1
PN
j¼1 DSMij
N N  1
ð
Þ
ð1Þ
where, N = number of components.
According to the NZF, the density of the system is 0.122 or 12 %. In other
words, only 172 of the 1,406 off-diagonal cells are occupied in the system. While
Fig. 8 The level of connectivity in the elements of composite DSM

complex, with as many as 38 elements and lot of interrelationships, the density is
only 12 %.
The SMI evaluates the overall connection scheme between the components;
however, this index does not evaluate that how components are grouped into
modules. The SMI measures the decay rate of the singular values in the system
[13],
SMI ¼ 1

ð2Þ
where, r is the singular values in the matrix, and N is the number of components,
and a determines the decay rate. This index is theoretically bounded and based on
numbers between 0 and 1. According to [10], an SMI closer to 1.0 indicates a
higher degree of modularity, where the connectivity information is more distrib-
uted. An SMI closer to zero indicates a more integral system. The SMI, in printer
case is closer to zero, that indicates an integral system, even though the algorithm
formed some modules. One reason can be the number of edges formed by inter-
faces related to elements such as power supply, paper, main controller CPU, as
these interfaces are more distributed in DSM.
5 Discussion and Conclusions
This paper is about a case study analyzing an existing product by applying the
component DSM method. The results are not generalizable and primarily depen-
dent on product type. One reason that determines the degree of modularization in a
product is dependent on the number of interactions, component connectivity, and
how spread these interactions are in the matrix.
In this work, decomposition of the mechatronic product is performed to analyze
the architecture of the multi-domain system. For this purpose, DSM approach is

used by decomposing the system into subsystems and components and, in the
process, establishes the component interfaces. After applying the clustering
algorithm, the DSM formed by only physical interfaces is different than the
composite DSM. In case of physical interface DSM, the number of interfaces is
signiﬁcantly less and not spread like composite DSM; hence, more modules are
formed by clustering algorithm. In composite DSM, more interfaces are there, as
elements related to information and control are more spread and linked to other
elements in the structure as compared to those related to mechanical elements. The
matrix formed by partitioning highlights important aspect related to identiﬁcation
of modules. As partitioning, regroup most of the elements close to the diagonal
that can be considered as possible module candidates. Some interfaces are not
accumulating near the diagonal is due to many interfaces shared by some of the
elements in a system.
Structural analysis of the system architecture is an important aspect that rep-
resents nodes, edges, interfaces, and modules. A high degree of connectivity in a
structure can make the system analysis difﬁcult. The quantity of feedback loops
may increase drastically as connectivity of elements in a structure becomes higher.
This indicates integral products’ architectures and results in more connected
product that require more efforts to redesign. From the SMI index and Ulrich’s
deﬁnition of product architecture, the printer architecture is close to integrative,
though some modules are formed after clustering. Structural optimization is useful
when a fundamental system structure has to be redesigned in order to form product
platforms to create variety. This supports developers in the creation of speciﬁc
system variants for product customization [7]. This implies that through structure
optimization using DSM methods, a product platform can be developed from a
single product that can be used for customization in the product. Structure opti-
mization involves application of various approaches such as tearing and structure
Pareto analysis.
The development of product architecture based on design parameters and their
interfaces is a useful approach for product upgrading and MC. For instance, for
better performance, increasing the copying speed of the printer can be achieved by
changing design parameters such as speed of a motor or its size. Once the modular
structure is in place along with relevant interfaces, the designer can decide either
to replace the component (with a high speed motor) or to use a controllable
component (variable resistance in this case), that also involve change in the control
software, in case of mechatronic products. This upgrading may not change to a
large extent the physical conﬁguration of the system. As shown in the printer
example, though main motor is not placed in any module, any change may
inﬂuence the interfaces with subsystems and components such as printer drive
assembly, main CPU, and control software. Furthermore, the design parameters
can be changed to create variety in the product, such as changing speed and size of
the motor. This must have an effect on the overall performance of the product.
One issue related to the design of complex systems is the trade-off between mod-
ularity and integrality. What should be the degree of modularity in case of computer-
controlled mechatronic products? According to Hollta and Whitney [10, 14], integral
Multidisciplinary Product Decomposition and Analysis
421

architecture is driven by product performance (i.e., power consumption, weight, size,
speed, etc.) and cost while modular architecture by business demands such as variety,
product change, engineering standards, and service requirements. They argue that
how total modularity is not always desirable in case of high-power mechanical
products as opposed to low power signal processor type products. That argument is
supported by some high-performance systems such as automotive and aerospace
vehicles appear to favor highly coupled architectures, where one part fulﬁlls poten-
tially many functions [15]. It means that products with technical performance con-
straints (e.g., light weight, tight packaging, power efﬁciency, speed) tend to have a
larger function-to-component ratio, i.e., they are more integral such as electronic
calculator and mobile phones (excluding batteries and cover). But on the other hand,
products like computers are highly modular as compared to products that contain
computer control mechanical parts such as printers, car engines even though they are
microprocessor-based products (or subproducts).
The optimal solution in case of mechatronic systems could be a high-perfor-
mance product, with a few modules that can be used for commonality and ﬂexible
design for customization. However, that statement cannot be generalized due to
various factors and requirements. Though mechatronics is a design process to
develop high-performance products by the functional and spatial integration of
subsystems with various engineering disciplines, more software and electronics are
integrated to mechanical products for improved performance. Apart from these
functional improvements, there must be some compromise on performance to
satisfy market needs. Therefore, the degree of modularity in mechatronic products
varies and cannot be generalized due to performance requirements, product
structure, market demands, etc.

Open Innovation, Co-Creation and Mass
Customisation: What Role for 3D Printing
Platforms?
Thierry Rayna, Ludmila Striukova and John Darlington
Abstract Both open innovation and 3D printing technologies have attracted a lot
of attention recently. Our main aim is to investigate the role of online 3D printing
platforms in open innovation with customers. There are four main contributions in
this paper. Firstly, it offers a better understanding of the relationship between open
innovation, co-creation and mass customisation and indicates in which case they
overlap. Secondly, it provides an ‘inside–outside’ typology of co-creation that
enables to classify co-creation activities according to their aim and type of
collaboration. The third main contribution is a typology of online 3D printing
platforms, based on their core services. Finally, by combining the two typologies,
we are able to demonstrate the role played by each platform based on type of
co-creation activity considered.

has now become very popular and ﬁrms, small or large, have been trying to
integrate this new way of innovating in their strategies. However, focus has
generally been put either on open innovation with other ﬁrms or open innovation
with the academic world. Yet customers can also be an essential source of ideas
and engaging customers in co-creation activities (designing a new product or
improving an existing one) can provide ﬁrms with a strong competitive advantage.
Indeed, many ﬁrms have been using ideas and feedback from consumers to
innovate and neither open innovation nor co-creation with customers is new
phenomena. Yet, until recently, these practices were limited in extent and
restricted to very particular situations. Standardisation and specialisation were
governing innovation practices, and although consumer input was sometimes used,
it was mostly used to ‘guess’ the needs of the majority of consumers.
The recent progresses of ICTs have changed the situation considerably. In
particular, the advent of Web 2.0 technologies and social media has enabled ﬁrms
to permanently engage in co-creation activities with a large number of customers.
Furthermore, beforehand, the ‘outside–in’ aspect of open innovation with cus-
tomers was far more exploited than the ‘inside–out’ aspect. Indeed, without ade-
quate means of productions widely available to customers, it was difﬁcult for them
to use and develop ideas of the ﬁrms that were so far unexploited. Recent progress
in ICTs has changed that and enabled customers to actually engage in developing
ideas put forward by the ﬁrms and transform these ideas into innovative products.
Until recently, however, this ability has been mainly restricted to the digital goods.
However, the recent advances in 3D printing technologies have the potential to
extend the opportunities of co-creation with customers to the realm of physical
objects.
Although prices of 3D printers have considerably decreased over the past few
years, advanced printers remain rather expensive. On the lower end of the range,
printers can be found for less than $1,000, but the relatively low quality of the
objects they produce restrict them to rapid prototyping activities. Aiming to bridge
this gap, several online 3D printing platforms have appeared over the past few
years. The ﬁrst of such platforms, Ponoko, appeared in 2007 and there are now 14
online platforms that enable ﬁrms and customers to engage in co-creation activities
related to 3D objects. Interestingly, these platforms are rather heterogeneous and
do not systematically offer the same services, which implies that they aim to
satisfy different needs.
The main goal of this paper is to investigate the role that these online 3D
printing platforms play in open innovation activities conducted with customers.
Since these technologies, as well as the related IT systems, are in their early stage
of development, our methodology is both descriptive and prescriptive.
The paper has the following structure. In the ﬁrst section, we focus on open
innovation with customers and on the role played by co-creation and mass cus-
tomisation in this form of innovation. In the second section, we detail the different
forms of co-creation and provide a typology enabling to classify co-creation
activities. In section three, we present in detail the current online 3D printing
426

platforms and provide a typology of such platform, which is based on the core
services these platforms deliver. The last section combines the two typologies to
investigate the types of co-creation activities that each platform enables.
2 Open Innovation with Customers
The importance of external sources of innovation started to be emphasised by
researchers back in the 1980s [2] and gained even more attention since 2003, when
Chesbrough coined the term ‘open innovation’.
Open innovation can typically take three forms [3]. The ﬁrst form, also known
as inbound open innovation [4], is ‘outside–in’ and consists in integrating suppliers
and customers as external source of knowledge. The second form, ‘inside–out’, or
outbound open innovation [4] aims to increase proﬁts by bringing ideas to the
outside environment, so that ‘outsiders’ can develop ideas and technologies that
are not used by the ﬁrm. The last form is a combination of both forms and is
referred to as coupled open innovation.
Until recently, open innovation with customers was mainly ‘inside–out’.
Companies were using customers as a source of ideas for new products or
improvements of existing products [2, 5]. Lately, however, there has been a shift
from simply exploiting customer knowledge to co-creating knowledge with cus-
tomers [6]. Nowadays, open innovation with customers has even taken the form of
a coupled process focused on co-creation. Customers are involved in generating
ideas for new products, co-creating products with ﬁrms, testing ﬁnished products
and in providing end user product support [7]. Furthermore, consumers are no
longer simply external sources of ideas (outside–in), but can also become external
paths to market (inside–out) [8, 9].
Co-creation is an active, creative and social collaborative process between
producers and users that aims to create value for customers [10]. There are two
different forms of co-creation. Autonomous co-creation relates to co-creation
activities led by customers that take place independently from companies [11].
Although customers may still be using tools and platforms originally provided by
ﬁrms, they do so on their own free will, without any incentive provided by the
companies. In contrast, sponsored co-creation relates to co-creation activities
conducted by individuals customers or by customers communities that take place
at the initiative of a company or any other established organisation.
Co-creation can occur at different stages of the production process: during the
product design stage (co-design), the product manufacturing stage (co-manufacturing)
and even during the product distribution stage. In addition to taking place between
companies and customers, co-creation can also take place between individual cus-
tomers. These co-creation communities are also known as ‘communities of creation’
[6] or ‘communities of co-design’ [12].
Co-creation corresponds to the customer-related part of open innovation: ‘open
innovating’ with customers necessarily implies engaging in co-creation with them.
Open Innovation, Co-Creation and Mass Customisation
427

However, although co-creation is a necessary condition of open innovation with
customers, it is not always a sufﬁcient condition. Indeed, not all co-creation
activities carried out with customers lead to open innovation, as innovation
requires successful commercialisation. Hence, suggestions submitted by customers
that are not acted upon, or a collaborative design that does not go beyond the
prototype stage, are examples of co-creation activities that do not result in
innovation.
Yet the recent raise of mass customisation has strengthened the link between
co-creation and innovation. Indeed, when the target of co-creation is the mass
market, it is likely that few co-creation activities with customers will lead to a
commercially successful product and, hence, to an innovation. However, if
co-creation takes place within the context of mass customisation, the situation is
radically different since customers engaged in it are no longer trying to guess what
the mass market want, but instead help develop a product that fulﬁls their needs.
For this reason, most mass customisation co-creation activities are likely to result
in commercialisation of the product (and hence in innovation). The key difference
is, of course, that this takes place in a ‘market of one’ instead of the mass market.
Mass customisation relates to the production of personalised or custom/tailored
goods or services on a large scale (i.e. customisation is the rule and not the
exception). Although, co-creation activities increasingly result in mass-customised
products, mass customisation does not necessarily involve co-creation activities
[13] or even lead to open innovation [14, 15]. For instance, when mass customi-
sation implies choosing from a set of predetermined options (e.g. colour, size, add-
ons), this is not co-creation, as customers do not provide actual input, besides
choosing amongst options that were set by the ﬁrm (possibly without any customer
input). Furthermore, selecting from predetermined options does not lead to inno-
vation, as this does not provide any element of novelty [15]. Figure 1 summarises
the relationship between open innovation, co-creation and mass customisation.

3 Categorising Co-Creation Activities
Co-creation activities may take different forms. To categorise the different
co-creation activities, we consider two critical aspects: whether the roles of the
consumers and ﬁrms are differentiated or integrated (‘inside’) and whether the
resulting product is aimed at the mass market or is customised (‘outside’). This
‘inside–outside’ approach enables us to cover both inside–out and outside–in
aspects of open innovation [3].
The ﬁrst aspect of this classiﬁcation relates to the complementarity of the
activities of consumers and ﬁrms in the co-creation process. For instance, the
consumer might design the product and the ﬁrm manufacture it. In the case of DIY
furniture, the ﬁrms supply ﬂat-packed furniture and consumers assemble the object
themselves. In contrast, other co-creation activities involve ﬁrms and consumers
working together on the same aspect of the production process, for instance, when
a customer is ordering a custom made piece of jewellery or when ﬁrms and
customers work together writing a computer program.
The second aspect relates to whether the output of the co-creation activity is
meant to be mass-produced or is tailored for a speciﬁc consumer. This aspect is
particularly important as it relates to the value created and incentives to participate
in the co-creation activity. Some co-creation activities result in a product ‘valuable
to one’ (mass customisation), while others lead to products that are ‘valuable to the
many’ (mass production).
Table 1 presents our classiﬁcation of co-creation, as well as examples for each
type of co-creation. Nowadays, the most common type of co-creation activity is
‘differentiated/mass production’. Indeed, most crowdsourcing activities belong to
this type of co-creation, as crowdsourcing typically implies that the ‘crowd’ is in
charge of one type of activity (usually design), while the company takes care of the
rest and mass-manufactures the product.
4 Typology of Online 3D Printing Platforms
Our research enabled us to identify 14 online platforms related to 3D printing and
opened to consumers. Aside these platforms, there are several 3D platforms
offering B2B and B2C solutions to businesses (e.g. Digital Forming). Since they
are not (directly) opened to consumers, these platforms were not considered.

Amongst these 14 platforms, ﬁve originate from the USA (3DLT, Cubify
Cloud, Krafwürx, MakerBot/Thingiverse, MakeXYZ), three from the UK (3D
CreationLab, 3DPrintUK, iMakr), one from Australia (Additer), one from New
Zealand (Ponoko) and four from the continental Europe: 3D Burrito (Sweden),
i.Materialise (Belgium), Sculpteo (France) and Shapeways (Netherlands). Fur-
thermore, three of these companies (Ponoko, Sculpteo, Shapeways), although not
originally located in the USA, have opened ofﬁces there. Finally, it is to be noted
that two of the companies studied have a physical store: Thingiverse/Markerbot in
New York, USA and iMakr in London, UK.
The ﬁrst mover, Ponoko, launched its service back in 2007. A few other
companies followed in the next two years (six platforms were launched between
2007 and 2009), but platform was launched in 2010 (probably because of the lack
of maturity and adoption of the technology at the time). Starting in 2011, the
growth resumed, with eight platforms launched between 2011 and 2013, and half
of these platforms launched in the ﬁrst 6 months of 2013.
At the moment, there are only few consumers and SMEs who are equipped with
a 3D printer, and those who do have a 3D printer usually can only print with plastic
(and they might want or need objects made of other materials). Hence, these
platforms have emerged to attempt to bridge this gap. Their customers are either
people who want designs that they can print using their 3D printers or people who
have designs, but do not own a printer (or, at least, not the one that prints with the
material they want). There are also customers who want both to acquire designs
and have them manufactured.
Because of these heterogeneous needs, there is room for specialisation in the
market, which is reﬂected by the variety of combinations of services offered by 3D
printing platforms. Some platforms only cover design aspects (3D Burrito, 3DLT)
or manufacturing aspects (3DPrintUK, MakeXYZ). However, the majority of
platforms (10 out of 14) cover both design and manufacturing aspects.

Whether involved in design, manufacturing, or both, the main services offered
by the existing online 3D printing platforms are rather similar. We identiﬁed eight
different services, which are presented in Table 2. Five of these services (design
supply, hosting, customisation, co-creation and crowdsourcing) relate to design
aspects, while three of them (object printing, 3D printer sales, printing crowd-
sourcing) correspond to manufacturing.
Based on the core services offered, we were able to identify three broad cate-
gories of 3D printing platforms (Table 3). Out of the fourteen platforms, seven of
them (Cubify Cloud, i.Materialise, Ponoko, Sculpteo, Shapeways, 3D Burrito,
3DLT) can be categorised as design marketplaces. Their main activity is to host
and sell third-party designs of 3D objects. Three of these marketplaces (Cubify
Cloud, i.Materialise, Sculpteo) also offer their own designs for sale (‘Design
supply’). The same three companies also offer users to customise these designs
(‘Design Customisation’). Sculpteo goes even further and enables users to cus-
tomise third-party designs hosted on their platform. Two of the design market-
places (i.Materialise and Shapeways) also offer co-creation design services to help
third-parties turn their designs into a 3D object. However, none of the design
marketplaces (currently) offers a design crowdsourcing service.
Once consumers purchase designs from these marketplaces, they are then able
to print it at home using their own 3D printer or using ﬁve of these marketplaces
(all except 3D Burrito and 3DLT). One of the marketplaces, Cubify Cloud, even
sells 3D printers to consumers, so they are then able to print objects at home.
The second main category of platforms consists of companies that operate
similarly to a traditional printing service (albeit a 3D one). The main objective of

3DCreationLab, 3DPrintUK, iMakr and Makerbot/Thingiverse is to enable users to
3D print their designs. Users upload their designs on these platforms’ website and
these designs are then 3D printed and shipped to the user. There are also physical
stores (iMakr in London, Makerbot in New York), which offer to print objects
from existing designs. In addition to its physical store, iMakr allows the online
submission of designs. Both companies also sell home 3D printers.
Unlike design marketplaces, printing services generally do not supply or host
designs (the only exception is Makerbot/Thingiverse, which operates a repository
of free-of-charge designs supplied by users). However, two of these printing ser-
vices (3DCreationLab and iMakr) also offer a co-creation design service to help
users create 3D models of objects.
The last group in Table 3 consists of platforms that are neither design market-
places nor printing services. One of them, MakeXYZ, is, so far, the only printing
marketplace. It enables owners of 3D printers to supply their services and acts as an
intermediary between them and people who require printing. In June 2013, Make-
XYZ announced its partnership with 3DLT, one of the two design marketplaces
without a printing service. The integration of these two services will, thus, result in
another design marketplace with printing service (albeit a crowdsourced one).
The last two companies, Additer and Kraftwürx, are signiﬁcantly different from
other 3D printing services in this new market, which, otherwise, looks rather
traditional (marketplaces, printing services, etc.). Indeed, they operate as full
crowdsourcing platforms, which means that they enable users to crowdsource both
design and manufacturing aspects.
For instance, there is a board on Kraftwürx’s website, where users can post
ideas and projects at any stage of development. Some of them post a very generic
idea (for instance, showing different pieces of jewellery and asking the crowd to
produce a personalised object ‘in the spirit of’ of the design of the objects posted).
Others post 2D designs and need help turning them into 3D objects. Finally, other
users already have a rough 3D model of the object and ask the crowd to help reﬁne
it, or make it functional.
Likewise, although some users seem to already have a precise idea of the
material they would like to use, others expect the crowd to offer them different
options. The crowd is also used to advise on can a variety of other manufacturing
aspects (cost, proximity, quality, etc.).
To this respect, a rather surprising point in this study is that, aside from these two
crowdsourcing platforms, none of the other twelve online 3D printing platforms use
crowdsourcing or offer crowdsourcing services. However, this may be due to the
fact that the technology is yet immature and that the tools to enable crowdsourcing
are not yet available. Indeed, one of the essential aspects of crowdsourcing is the
wide availability of tools (e.g. software, online platforms) that enable users to
contribute to crowdsourcing at a very low cost and with minimal barriers to entry.
At the moment, in many cases, advanced knowledge of highly technical 3D
modelling software is often required to produce 3D objects. When intuitive and
easy to use tools will be readily available, it might become more interesting for 3D
platforms to include crowdsourcing as a part of their business model.

5 Types of Co-Creation and 3D Printing Platforms
In Sect. 3, we introduced a classiﬁcation of co-creation activities. Using the
typology presented in Table 1, it is possible to categorise the role that the fourteen
online 3D platforms play with regard to co-creation (Fig. 2).
Printing services obviously belong to the ‘differentiated/mass customisation’
quadrant, as they relate to user manufacturing and lead to the creation of custom
objects. By nature, the roles of ﬁrms and customers are differentiated, as customers
provide the designs and these printing services transform designs into objects.
However, as mentioned in Sect. 4, two of these platforms (3DCreationLab and
iMakr) also offer a co-design service, so for these two platforms, there is an
overlap with the ‘integrated/mass customisation’ quadrant.
The case of design marketplaces is slightly more complex. Indeed, as a few of
these also offer a printing service, there are cases when no co-creation takes place.
This is, for instance, the case when a customer purchases a 3D model through the
marketplace and has it printed without customising it (beyond basic options).
In contrast, when a customer buys a 3D model on the marketplace and prints it
at home, it is indeed a co-creation process with differentiated activities. However,
whether this case belongs to mass production or mass customisation essentially
depends on whether the object was customised or not. If it was not, then the
co-creation activity can be considered as being a part of a mass production process.
Indeed, although each customer 3D prints its own copy, it is the same identical

object that is printed over and over again. It is, thus, actually a mass production
process, albeit being a decentralised one.
However, some of the design marketplaces offer design customisation services.
In such cases, the co-creation process relates to mass customisation. Also,
depending on the type of design service offered (e.g. customisation, co-creation),
the co-creation process becomes more or less integrated.
Finally, the case of crowdsourcing platforms is probably the most complex one,
as depending on the type of activity that is crowdsourced and the extent of the
crowdsourcing activity, the co-creation process can potentially fall in any of the
categories. Indeed, some customers use Additer and Kraftwürx with the aim to
mass-produce (again, not with the aim to produce millions of units, but in order to
sell the same object to many customers). In that case, both design and manufac-
turing processes can include or exclude the co-creation activities.
The same is true for the co-creation activities that are related to mass cus-
tomisation. However, these platforms give raise to a new form of co-creation
activities: crowd customisation, which is a combination of crowdsourcing and
mass customisation. In such a case, the ‘wisdom of the crowd’ is used not to satisfy
the needs of the many (like it is for instance with threadless), but to satisfy the
needs of one, in other words, the crowd is asked to help design and manufacture an
object which has value for only one particular customer.
6 Conclusion
Co-creation with customers is a critical aspect of open innovation, but techno-
logical and cost constraints were, until recently, such that this form of innovation
was only used in particular situations. By providing customers with easy to use and
effective means of productions, recent technological progress has empowered
consumers with the ability to create goods in the digital realm, thereby initiating
their transformation from consumers to prosumers. 3D printing technologies have
the potential to do the same in the world of physical object and, thereby, take
co-creation to its full potential. However, for this to happen adequate co-creation
platforms need to be built and this requires to fully understand the different aspects
of co-creation.
In this paper, we examined the role of online 3D platforms in co-creation
processes. To do so, we ﬁrst investigated the relationship between open innova-
tion, co-creation and mass customisation. We demonstrated that although there is a
clear overlap between these three phenomena, they do not necessary imply one
another. Yet, we have shown that the progresses made in manufacturing tech-
nologies have made it easier to combine them.
The second key contribution of this article is an ‘inside–outside’ typology of co-
creation, which is based on both the means (complementarity of roles between ﬁrms
and customers) and aims (mass market or individuals) of co-creation. This typology
enables to understand better the challenges and opportunities related to co-creation.
434

Another key contribution is a typology of online 3D platforms, which is based on
the core services we delivered. This typology enables us to identify three main
categories of platforms: design marketplaces, printing services and crowdsourcing
platforms. Finally, we have combined the two typologies in a mapping that enables
to better understand which kind of platforms is suited for which kind of co-creation.
This is critical to both online 3D platforms (in order to develop new services or ﬁne-
tune existing ones) and SMEs and consumers using these platforms.
An avenue for further research would be to use this mapping to critically assess
the services provided by online 3D platforms and investigate how these services
could be improved. It would also be interesting to see whether the two typologies
enable to design types of platforms that do not yet exist. Finally, the typology of
co-creation could be applied to other kinds of online platforms, such as Web 2.0
platforms.

Open Innovation: Creating Value
Through Co-Creation
Yaghoub Zahedi Anbardan and Maryam Raeyat
Abstract Research in the ﬁeld of open innovation and creating value through co-
creation are somehow new. The main objective of this study is to answer the
question that ‘‘How open innovation helps companies in creating value through co-
creation activities?’’ In order to do so, the authors conducted a qualitative research
and ﬁnally found four main strategies that companies could follow in different
situations. These strategies were: (1) Corrective product/service improvement, (2)
incremental
product/service
improvement,
(3)
Crawling
product/service
improvement, and (4) Radical product/service improvement.

1 Introduction
Nowadays, consumers have a more broad range of choices of products or/and ser-
vices than they ever had before, but yet they seem unhappy. Firms invest in greater
product/service diversity but are less able to differentiate themselves in the market
[1]. For more than a hundred years, a company-oriented, view of value creation has
shaped the industrial structure and the entire business environment, while this
perspective often conﬂicts with what consumers’ perception of value is [2].

On the other hand, value creation is one of the main purposes and vital pro-
cesses in economic transactions. Systems are value creation conﬁgurations of
people, technologies, value propositions connecting internal and external service
systems, and shared information [3]. Here, co-creation adds a new dynamics to the
relationship between producer and customer through engaging customers directly
in the production/distribution of value. In other words, customers can get involved
at about any stage of the value chain [4]. In the existing literature on value creation
and value co-creation, value is used as an abstract concept that seldom is speciﬁed
in more concrete terms. In addition, one should note that value is a relationship
between what one achieves and what one sacriﬁces [5].
While contributing substantial creative input/value, the co-creation activities
also provide a variety business challenges by disrupting a closed business model of
expertise, pushing toward an open innovation model [6]. Yet, some of the litera-
ture falls under the rubric of concepts such as ‘‘customization’’ and ‘‘co-produc-
tion’’ for the use of a given customer/group of customers, some companies
incorporate the ideas/designs suggested by consumers into their open innovation
processes or speciﬁcally support co-creation activities [7].
In this paper, the authors review the existing literature on open innovation and
co-creation, and then discuss the methodological issues. Then, the ﬁndings are
discussed, and the paper concludes with four main strategies for creating value
through open innovation activities. Finally, the limitations and future directions are
elaborated and the paper concludes.
2 Literature Review
2.1 Open Innovation
Open innovation has become one of the important topics in the innovation man-
agement ﬁeld. After Chesbrough’s groundbreaking works in the last decade (see
[8, 9]), it quickly became clear that the roots of open innovation go far back in
history, and not just in the last few years. In an extensive literature review, after
reviewing a hundred and ﬁfty open innovation papers, Dahlander and Gann [10]
found many references to concepts such as complementary assets, absorptive
capacity, and the exploration versus exploitation discussion, which are different
concepts with roots in open innovation phenomenon [11].
In today’s information-based atmosphere, ﬁrms can no longer afford to rely
completely on their own ideas in order to succeed in their business. Moreover, they
cannot restrict their innovations to a single direction in the market [8]. Open
innovation describes an emergent model of innovation in which ﬁrms draw on
research and development (R&D) that may lie outside their own boundaries [12].
The open innovation paradigm can be understood as the antithesis of the ‘‘tradi-
tional vertical integration model’’ where ﬁrm-level research and development
438
Y. Z. Anbardan and M. Raeyat

activities lead to internally developed products/services that are then distributed by
the ﬁrm [9].
As Huizingh [11] argues, the basic premise of open innovation is opening up
the innovation process. One of its most often used deﬁnitions is: ‘‘the use of
purposive inﬂows and outﬂows of knowledge to accelerate internal innovation
(inbound open innovation), and to expand the markets for external use of inno-
vation (outbound open innovation), respectively’’ [13]. These two types of open
innovation are broadly studied in the relevant literature (e.g., see [13]).
While inbound open innovation refers to the acquisition of external technology
in open exploration processes, and the practice of utilizing external sources of
innovation, such as suppliers, customers, outbound open innovation describes the
outward transfer of technology in open exploitation processes, and proﬁting from
bringing ideas or technologies to market via pathways that lie outside the ﬁrm’s
[14–17]. Generally speaking, the literature shows that inbound open innovation is
more frequently and commonly used and developed than outbound open innova-
tion, which can be explained by insufﬁciencies of the market or the organization
(see [11, 18, 19]).
2.2 Co-creation
The terms ‘‘co-production,’’ ‘‘presumption,’’ and ‘‘co-creation’’ refer to situations
in which consumers/customers collaborate with companies or with other con-
sumers/customers to produce valuable products and services. These situations
sometimes appear to differentiate the traditional roles of ‘‘producer’’ and ‘‘con-
sumer’’ [20]. It is extensively studied in the open innovation literature, and derived
from open development studies [21], customization [7], and the like. According to
the literature, however, the term ‘‘co-creation’’ only implies the mutual collabo-
rative efforts/activities that occur during the consumption process, which was the
original implication of presumption [22].
Customers/consumers become active participants in an open innovation process
of a ﬁrm and take part in the development of new products/services [23]. Piller
et al. [23] also focus on inbound innovation processes and ﬁnd that the underlying
idea, which is shared, is that of an active, creative, and communal collaboration
process, between producers and customers/consumers. In their eyes, co-creation
involves customers who are active in a company’s innovation processes and ini-
tiatives [23, 24].
Furthermore, in the relevant literature, the term customer/consumer co-creation
of value has been frequently used [25]. It was originally deﬁned in the late 1990s
by Kambil et al. [4] as co-creation of value by a ﬁrm’s customers/clients. Then,
this concept has been gradually extended toward other individual initiatives for
customers and companies [7]. Some authors believe that the key to value creation
is to co-produce goods/services that mobilize customers [26]. Matching customer
practices and provider activities requires that one not only understands the concept
Open Innovation: Creating Value Through Co-Creation
439

of value but similarly prominently the process of value creation, especially through
co-production activities [27].
Lusch et al. [28] provide a general model in order to explain that how much of
the co-creation or service provision is performed by customers. Prahalad and
Ramaswamy [29] argue that nowadays the marketplace has become a venue for
proactive customer contribution. They argue for co-opting customer involvement
in the value creation process. Moreover, Oliver et al. [30] elaborate the idea of co-
creation in their remarks that marketing is headed toward a paradigm of real-time
marketing, which incorporates mass customization and relationship marketing by
interactively designing evolving offerings that meet customers’ distinctive altering
needs.
According to the notion of co-creation, if a consumer/customer is involved in
the production of a good or rendering a service, the created value will be improved
because the customer can modify the product as he/she desires. This is why co-
creation concept refers to collaboration with customers for the purposes of inno-
vation and has become a fundamental premise of the service/product development
[31, 32]. Kristensson et al. [32] compare co-creation and customization and argue
that the difference between these two lies in the degree of involvement of the
customer; in general terms, the customer plays a less active role in customization
than in co-creation. Finally, they conclude that based on the notion of co-creation,
value can only be determined by the user during the consumption/usage process.
von Hippel [33] studied the contribution of customers to the research and devel-
opment of new products and services. His concept is broadly recognized in both
academic and practitioner spheres. In 1970s, he found that most product innova-
tions come not from within the company but from end users of the product [34,
35]. Moreover, Thomke and von Hippel [36] suggested methods for customers to
become more like co-innovators and co-developers of custom products.
Value co-creation can take place only if interactions between the ﬁrm and the
customer occur proactively. If there are no direct interactions, no co-creation of
value is likely. However, the mere existence of interactions, by itself, does not
mean that the ﬁrm is engaged in the customer’s value creating process [37]. Lusch
et al. [31] argue that an organization requires co-creation in order to renew its
value propositions or offered services. In other words, it must be able to com-
prehend important external trends [22].
Customers play an active role in the creation and provision of services/products
and in the realization of its value in different extents. Some customers may be
involved with service activities and be regarded as ‘‘part-time employees’’ of the
ﬁrm but all involved in integrating the service they receive with other aspects of
their lives to some degree before there can be beneﬁt. However, although ﬁrms are
looking for increasing customer co-creation, it is crystal clear that customers
normally fail to optimize their co-creation roles [38]. In sum, co-creation entails
enabling users to freely experiment and innovate by providing a platform for
collaborative innovation [39]. Prahalad and Ramaswamy [1] analyzed co-creation
as a relatively new and critical development within the ﬁeld of innovation. They
440
Y. Z. Anbardan and M. Raeyat

provided examples of four building blocks by which co-creation occurs: dialog,
access, transparency, and risk [40].
Piller et al. [23] suggest a typology of co-creation activities, which contributes
to a better understanding of enterprise strategies for open innovation. Their ﬁrst
dimension describes the stage in the innovation process that customers can par-
ticipate in. The second dimension refers to the degree of collaboration between a
ﬁrm and its customers and among the customers themselves. The third dimension
describes the degrees of freedom that customers are given when working on a
speciﬁc task. Based on these dimensions, eight types of customer co-creation are
identiﬁed [41]. This conceptualization, along with Chesbrough’s [8, 9] concep-
tualization of open innovation, is used in the present study to answer a main
question: ‘‘How open innovation helps companies in creating value through co-
creation activities?’’
3 Methodology
The qualitative researchers might aim at induction, in the sense of development of
theory from data [42]. As Miller [43] notes, ‘‘Qualitative research is an empirical,
socially located phenomenon, deﬁned by its own history, not simply a residual
grab-bag comprising all things that are not quantitative.’’ This is a conceptual
paper which puts forward a conceptual model for showing how open innovation
helps companies in creating value through co-creation activities. For this purpose,
co-creation is deﬁned as a four-dimensional concept-based on the deﬁnition pro-
posed by Piller et al. [23]. The arguments draw on a range of contemporary
research prompted by considerations of the interface between co-creation and open
innovation albeit that research into this area is still in its ﬁrst two decades of
elaboration. In particular, the discussion presented here uses data from:
Interview sessions Ten face-to-face interviews with experts in the ﬁeld of co-
creation and open innovation were conducted. The experts had more than three
years of relevant experience and also published a series relevant of books, papers,
and reports. As mentioned earlier, the aim of the research was to propose a
conceptual for showing how co-creation activities help companies in creating
value through open innovation. The interview agenda contained both structured
elements and open questions [44].
Focus group sessions Two series of focus groups among experts were held
which raised a variety of topics, including open innovation, characteristics of co-
creation, etc. It should be noted that these sessions were designed based on [45]
technique.

4 Discussion
As mentioned earlier, we used a qualitative research method to answer the research
question. In order to do so, ﬁrst the authors held ten face-to-face interview sessions
with experts in this ﬁeld to discuss the main topics, i.e., open innovation and its
dimensions, co-creation strategies, value creation, etc. Then, two series of focus
group sessions were arranged to decide what models are best ﬁtted to answer the
research questions. The length of the interviews ranged from 30 to 60 min, with a
previous contextualization about the research. Almost all conversations were
recorded, and the second interviewer was not actively involved in the interview
process but took notes. There were some key issues which were mainly discussed
in the sessions, among which the importance of the followings was greater than
others: (1) to scrutinize the main frameworks, (2) to choose the main framework
for the conceptualization of strategies, (3) to ﬁnd examples of the real-world
situations and discuss the used/proposed strategies, etc.
In sum, based on our ﬁndings, co-creation is a strategy to realize open inno-
vation. In order to do so, both inbound and outbound open innovations are con-
sidered. Figure 1 shows that open innovation activities could inﬂuence co-creation
activities/strategies, and it, in turn, will lead to social/economic value creation.
However, this depends on some other issues, like contextual elements, readiness
for innovation, etc. It should be noted that since the research was qualitative in
nature, the authors tried to make a conceptualization based on which future studies
could be done. Moreover, the gathered data were analyzed based on coding
method, and then, the authors followed open and axial coding. The strategies
mentioned in Table 1 are the main pillars under which the codes were categorized.
In Table 1, different scenarios are shown. As illustrated in the table, four main
groups of strategies are identiﬁed, which are as follows:
•Inbound Open 
Innovation
•Outbound Open 
Innovation
Open 
Innovation
•Degree of 
collaboration
•Degree of 
freedom
Co-creation
•Social value
•Economic value

4.1 Corrective Product/Service Improvement/Proposal1
This group of strategies is appropriate for situations in which, (1) the open
innovation level is low, and (2) co-creation is considered at a lower level. In such
situations, companies collaborate with a single customer and use open innovation
strategies at a low level. Then, they try to correct their product/services based on
open innovation and comments from that single customer.
4.2 Incremental Product/Service Improvement/Proposal
This group of strategies is appropriate for situations in which, (1) the open
innovation level is low, and (2) co-creation is considered at a higher level. These
strategies are applicable when there is a group of customers or communities who
collaborate with the company, but the company is not following strong open
innovation strategies. Then, there would be some incremental product/service
improvements/proposals.
4.3 Crawling Product/Service Improvement/Proposal
This group of strategies is appropriate for situations in which, (1) the open
innovation level is high, and (2) co-creation is considered at a lower level. In this
situation, the company follows highly open innovative strategies, but co-creation
and customer collaboration are low. Therefore, the company considers Crawling
product/service improvements/proposals.
4.4 Radical Product/Service Improvement/Proposal
This group of strategies is appropriate for situations in which, (1) the open
innovation level is high, and (2) co-creation is considered at a higher level. These
strategies are so radical and are followed by substantial changes in the company.
This is because of the presence of a group of collaborative customers and the open
innovation strategies of the company, which could make fundamental revisions in
the products/services of the ﬁrm.
1 ‘‘Improvement’’ is used for inbound open innovations, and ‘‘Proposal’’ is used for outbound
open innovations. The reason behind this is that when companies deal with inbound open
innovations, they focus on themselves and ‘‘improvements’’, and when they follow outbound
open innovation strategies, they focus on ‘‘proposals’’ to other external bodies/entities.

5 Conclusion
The literature on co-creation and open innovation is limited, as these concepts
were newly discussed and elaborated in last two decades. However, there is evi-
dence that supports the existence of these phenomena before, yet their concep-
tualization, as it is today, is new. This study, tried to answer the following
question: ‘‘How open innovation helps companies in creating value through co-
creation activities?’’ In order to do so, a qualitative study was done, which led to
introduction of four types of strategies, as follows: (1) Corrective product/service
improvement, (2) incremental product/service improvement, (3) Crawling product/
service improvement, and (4) Radical product/service improvement.
Yet, there were some limitations. For instance, in this study, we mainly focused
on the conceptualizations, and future studies could take the contextual elements
into account to be more precise. Moreover, this research was a qualitative one and
using quantitative methods could contribute to the existing literature. Last but not
least, there were some limitations for ﬁnding experts in this ﬁled, as the topic is
new. To handle this limitation, we used snowball sampling to ﬁnd the experts.
Future research could be done in the domain of value created by co-creation
activities. In particular, in developing countries, this concept is newly discussed
and needs more efforts to be implemented (see [46, 47]). In addition, each sce-
nario/strategy could be investigated separately to scrutinize how it works.

Product, Organizational,
and Performance Effects of Product
Modularity
Henrike E. E. Boer
Abstract A lot has been written about the performance effects associated with
implementing a higher degree of product modularity in a ﬁrm’s product portfolio.
However, these ﬁndings are mostly based on case research in the electronics and
automotive industries and have hardly been tested and generalized beyond these
industries. To be able to establish whether ﬁrms not part of these industries would
experience the same performance effects, survey research will be needed. To
support future survey research, this paper proposes an operationalization of
product modularity and details the link between product modularity and ﬁrm
performance, to support the future development of measures and hypotheses.
Keywords: Product modularity  Firm performance  Literature study
1 Introduction
The concept of modularity is not new. In fact, its origins can be traced back as far
as to 1965, where Martin K. Starr noted that consumers were demanding ever-
greater variety, a demand that could be met by modular production, that is,
‘‘developing capacity to design and manufacture parts, which can be combined in a
maximum number of ways’’ [1, p. 132]. Plenty authors have further examined and
developed the concept during the subsequent years.
Nowadays, most authors agree on the general principles behind modularity. In
general, modularity is regarded as a design strategy for building and organizing
complex systems effectively [2]. It is viewed as a relative property and depends on
the degree to which the interfaces, interactions, or design rules of the system are

standardized and the degree to which each product component has a clear, unique,
and deﬁnite function within the system [3–5]. A system is modular if it has
standardized interfaces and the components perform one or very few functions. In
effect, the coupling and dependency between components are minimal, and the
components can be mixed, matched, and changed without compromising the
overall functionality and integrity of the system [3, 4, 6, 7].
The problem in the modularity literature is, however, that although many
performance beneﬁts have been proposed, these have hardly been tested empiri-
cally. One explanation for this lack of empirical veriﬁcation has its roots in the
concept itself. Even though authors agree on the general principles behind mod-
ularity, the concept of modularity is ambiguously understood on a more detailed
level [8, 9]. Even within the boundaries of the management literature, the concept
is measured and operationalized in different ways [10]. There is also a tendency in
the literature to generalize ﬁndings based upon a limited empirical background
[11]. The literature is riddled with examples of companies that have gained from
using modular systems. However, most of the case studies derive from the auto-
motive and electronics industries [12]. In addition, the few articles that have
examined the performance effects of product modularity quantitatively have op-
erationalized it differently (e.g., [12–19]).
Thus, in order to develop ﬁrmer theory, we need large-scale, i.e., survey based,
research to (1) test the performance effects reported in the literature but largely
based on case studies and (2) generalize these effects beyond the automotive and
electronics industries. In order to prepare for such a study, this paper operation-
alizes product modularity and develops hypotheses on the performance effects of
product modularity. This paper focuses on internal ﬁrm performance effects, which
means that any possible effect that goes beyond ﬁrm boundaries, i.e., effects on
supplier relations, customer involvement and preferences, or competitor imitation
capabilities, is not included. The paper also primarily focuses on product modu-
larity, not on service, knowledge, or production modularity, and on operational
performance, not strategic or ﬁnancial performance.
2 Research Design
In order to ﬁnd the articles from which the many proposed performance effects of
product modularity originates, a two-step literature study was conducted.
First, a subject search was conducted with the purpose to ﬁnd articles that
examined product modularity and its inﬂuence on ﬁrm performance. The search
was conducted in four databases, conﬁned to English language academic journals,
limited to peer-reviewed articles, and reviews published during the last 20 years,
and excluded obviously irrelevant areas such as chemistry, medicine, and physics.
Based on the above search limitations and the search terms shown in Table 1, 649
articles were found.

H. E. E. Boer

This number was reduced to 25 articles by only including articles focusing on
product and ﬁrm level and excluding articles that focused on models, metrics, and
methods for assessing and achieving modularity, on modularity’s performance
effects in a very speciﬁc context or regarded modularity as one of many ways of
achieving certain effects. All of these 25 articles had some preconceptions of how
product modularity inﬂuences ﬁrm performance, either based on logic or on pre-
vious articles.
The purpose of the second step was to extend the number of articles and include
those that were most inﬂuential in forming the preconceptions behind modularity.
To do so, the 25 articles’ references were turned to. From these references, the 21
articles, books, and paper cited ﬁve times or more were added to the literature
base.
3 Linking Product Modularity and Firm Performance
Only a handful of articles have attempted to operationalize modularity. These
articles, shown in Table 3, are based on survey research. Although they examine
different industries and settings—from the ﬁrst-tier suppliers to the ‘‘big three’’
auto manufacturers in North America [18, 19] to the plastics, electronics, and toy

industries in Hong Kong [13, 14]—the articles present some comparable ﬁndings.
First of all, it is found that product modularity positively impacts one or more
traditional performance parameters, such as ﬂexibility, customer service, product
performance, product innovativeness, and new product development speed, and
may or may not inﬂuence costs, new product and model introduction, delivery, and
quality. Secondly, it is established that the relationship between product modu-
larity and performance is mediated by internal integration.
However, problem is that the ﬁndings are based on different measures of
product modularity. As illustrated in Table 3, the different authors that have
conducted survey research have used different measures to operationalize product
modularity. These measures are deﬁned in Table 2.
Furthermore, the above measures ignore some critical aspects of product
modularity. Ulrich [4], one of the most referred to articles, deﬁnes a modular
architecture as having a one-to-one mapping from functional elements to physical
components and decoupled interfaces between components. However, both the
allocation of functions to the modules and the interfaces has been neglected in the
measures.
Yet another problem is that the articles operationalize product modularity by
focusing, mostly, on its effects, rather than its characteristics. The extent to which
components can be reused, added-on, or carried over are product effects of
implementing modularity in the product portfolio, while standardization of mod-
ules and interfaces, and one-to-one (or few) links between modules and functions
are actual characteristics of modularity.
Lastly, these ﬁndings are based on different and very aggregate perceptions of
what performance exactly constitutes. In fact, the relationship between product
modularity and ﬁrm performance is rather complicated. The complexity of this
relationship may partly explain why researchers struggle with determining the
exact nature of the connection between product modularity and, for instance,
innovation, quality, and costs [20, 21]. This means that there is a need for com-
bining and clarifying what literature proposes the relationships between product
modularity and ﬁrm performance to be, in order to develop hypotheses to support
future research. This article will try to do so, by distinguishing between (1) the
organizational effects that are expected to derive from and/or enhance the

proposed performance effects and (2) performance effects to be expected from
implementing product modularity and these organizational practices.
The remainder of the article is structured according to the model shown in
Fig. 1. This model delineates between product modularity characteristics and
product effects and also distinguishes between organizational effects and perfor-
mance effects that possibly could be expected to appear after implementing
product modularity.
3.1 Product Modularity Characteristics and Effects
This article proposes that product modularity is a function of three product char-
acteristics: the standardization of component interfaces and the component itself and
how functions are allocated to the components. This means that the extent to which a
ﬁrm’s product portfolio is modular depends on whether the physical components and
connections are standardized and the internal integrity in the product. Standard
interfaces refer to the use of physical connections that are well deﬁned and not
allowed to change during a period of time [3, 23]. Standard components are com-
ponents that are designed for the use in several products [4]. Internal integrity refers
to consistency between function and structure [24], i.e., the extent to which each
component performs one offew functions. If key product functions are dependent on
multiple components, it gravely complicates the task of standardizing components
or subsystems and their usability in multiple applications [4].

The use of standard interfaces and modules provides the company with several
possibilities, which it may or may not utilize. First of all, it allows the existing and
future product portfolio to use the same component in several products for the
same functional purpose, i.e., it allows for carry-over and commonality. It also
facilitates assemblability, as it minimizes the complexity of assembly as the
number of components is minimized, and interfaces are well known.
The use of standard interfaces and speciﬁc functions enables product changes to
one functional element to be localized within one component, which is denoted
independence in Fig. 1 [4]. It should also allow the product to be decomposable,
i.e., that the product cannot only be quickly assembled, but also quickly decom-
posed into separate units again, which facilitates a ‘‘plug-in and plug-out ﬂexi-
bility.’’ The combination of standard interfaces and speciﬁc functions also helps
attaining combinatorial assembly from relatively few components, that is, com-
binability [4], allowing the ‘‘mixing and matching’’ of components to give a
potentially large number of product variations [25].
3.2 Organizational Effects
The combinability of components allows for form [26] or manufacturing post-
ponement [27]. Postponement is based on the principle of seeking to design
common platforms, components, or modules, and delaying ﬁnal assembly or
customization until the ﬁnal market destination and/or customer requirements are
known [28]. It implies that the customer order decoupling point, the point that
divides the order-driven, and the forecast-driven activities, is pushed upstream
[26], in the form of, for instance, assemble-to-order.
Product modularity not only allows for the decoupling of components, but also
the decoupling of tasks [29]. This enables product development, after the system-
level design phase, to be conducted by relatively independent teams [7]. Different
parts of the design can be worked on independently and parallel to each other [5].
In other words, when a ﬁrm creates modular designs with well-deﬁned interfaces,
the need for component developers to interact is greatly reduced, which enables a
ﬁrm to adopt a ‘‘modular’’ organization design for product creation processes [3].
Similar effects can be expected in production, where modular designs allow a ﬁrm
to divide its production into specialized groups with narrow focus areas [4].
3.3 Performance Effects
One of the most mentioned beneﬁts of product modularity is the possibility to
achieve economies of scale on component level [30]. Reusability allows the
components to be produced in higher volumes using larger batch sizes [29]. This
means that change over times and costs are reduced and a higher equipment

utilization rate can be expected. In addition, development resources and capital
expenses can be amortized across a larger range of units [29], lower spare parts,
and safety stock levels are needed and, if the component is outsourced, larger
batches can be purchased at increasing discount rates. The performance effects that
can be expected from achieving component economies of scale include lower unit
manufacturing costs, shorter manufacturing lead-time, and higher-throughput time
efﬁciency.
Related to economies of scale is the notion of the learning curve. Reusing
components means that the total number of different components to be manufac-
tured decreases and the workforce will attain a comparatively higher degree of
experience with producing the speciﬁc components, especially if they are reused in
different product generations. As these components, carried over from previous
generations, have already been tested extensively in practice, product modularity
may increase durability and reliability. Additionally, if the components that are
carried over are of proven high quality, a ﬁrm can expect lower scrap and rework
costs and higher conformance and product quality.
Another performance effect of product modularity highlighted in the literature
is related to postponement [4, 18]. A greater variety of products can be constructed
from a smaller set of components [29], tailored according to customer order, and
assembled or conﬁgured to order. The bulk of the components, rather than ﬁnal
products, can be stocked [29], resulting in shorter-order lead-times and improved
responsiveness for customized products, and also decreased inventory costs, as
fewer variants need to be, kept in stock [31].
The assemblability and decomposability of the product facilitated by product
modularity, enables easier, and therefore, less costly and faster assembly. The ability
to decompose the product also supports repair and maintenance, as any dysfunc-
tional element can easily be removed and replaced, reducing rework cost [29].
The relationship between product modularity and innovation is more ambigu-
ous than the above relationships and much discussed in the literature. On the one
hand, product modularity, especially the independence of components and parallel
development, facilitates incremental and modular innovation. Concurrent devel-
opment of components may increase the efﬁciency of product development and
time to market [5, 23]. Additionally, modular upgradable products enable econ-
omies of substitution, where technological progress may be achieved by substi-
tuting certain components while retaining the others [6]. The components that are
retained in the product structure can, subsequently, undergo a series of incremental
improvements.
Through developing new and improved components based on new technologies
that ﬁt into the overall product architecture and by giving component developers
the opportunity to experiment with new component designs, the innovativeness
and introduction speed of new technologies can be accelerated [2, 23]. This
enables the ﬁrm to offer greater product variety and customize products to suit
many different customer segments [32].
However, it is important to note that, although modular innovation may
enhance performance at the module level, it does not necessarily do so on system
456
H. E. E. Boer

level [33]. Excessive modularization may result in enhanced system complexity
from the perspective of the designer, where the designer may become blind to
possible important interactions between component improvements and system-
level performance [33].
Even though modularity may facilitate rapid innovation, ﬁrms will also expe-
rience resource-intensive upfront development before being able to make use of
these beneﬁts, as the initial design efforts needed to create a modularized product
portfolio are much higher than designing comparable integrated systems [2], and
may include design changes in the manufacturing system, too [32]. It requires
extensive architectural knowledge to be able to deﬁne which components and
interfaces need to be standard and establish how functions can be allocated to
components.
Finally, a modular product portfolio does not imply sustainable advantages.
From time to time, not only the components, but also the entire product structure
may require an update. Innovation at this level, also called architectural innova-
tion, can be difﬁcult for ﬁrms geared toward innovation on a modular level, as
these ﬁrms over time will have developed organizational structures and informa-
tion channels that are focused on component-level activities [25]. So, architectural
innovation creates problems for the established ﬁrm, as it alters the way in which
the components of a product are linked together [34].
Another side effect of increasing product modularization is that components are
not optimized for one application but have been designed so that they meet the
requirements of multiple products. This is called global performance optimization
in Fig. 1, and means that, compared to integral products, the individual products
that are part of a modular product portfolio may have lower levels of performance
or that components have excess capability when used in some particular appli-
cations [29]. An integral product allows for function sharing, i.e., implementing
multiple functions using a single element, which allows for redundancy to be
eliminated and geometric nesting minimizing the mass, size and material use of a
product [7]. Modular product portfolios, on the other hand, may have redundancy
in the physical structure, increasing size and mass, material use and in the end,
variable costs. The fact that there is less function sharing in modular products may
also increase the number of subassembly steps needed in production.
Finally, modularity has also been highlighted as a tool to achieve mass cus-
tomization and is seen as a part of platform thinking. Pine [30] even states that
creating modular components is the best method of achieving mass customiza-
tion—minimizing costs, while maximizing individual customization. Meyer and
Lehnerd [35] argue that companies should plan and manage on the basis of product
platforms, the combination of subsystems and interfaces that constitute a common
product structure for a series of derivative products. The clearly identiﬁed inter-
faces between subsystems of the product would then provide the product designers
with the degree of freedom needed for rapid and cost-efﬁcient creation of deriv-
ative products [35].

4 Summary and Further Research
4.1 Summary
There is little robust theory on the practical effects of implementing a higher
degree of product modularity in a company’s product portfolio. In order to test
this, mostly case research based, ﬁndings reported in the literature and establish
whether the many beneﬁts suggested extend beyond the automotive and elec-
tronics industries, large-scale survey research is needed. To support such research,
this paper proposes an operationalization of product modularity and details the link
between product modularity and product, organizational, and performance effects,
to support the future development of measures and hypotheses.
Operationalization of product modularity and its effects By taking outset in the
measures used in survey research as well as the most widely recognized deﬁnitions,
this paper proposes that product modularity should be operationalized by including
(1) its characteristics—the degree of standardization of interfaces and components
and the degree of internal integrity within the product portfolio—and (2) its product,
organizational, and performance effects. Product effects include the degree to which
the ﬁrm can carry-over or reuse its components between products and product
generations, and the independence, combinability, and assemblability of compo-
nents. Organizational effects include (1) moving the customer order decoupling point
upstream by implementing assemble-to-order or even conﬁgure-to-order production,
(2) decoupling of activities in product development, as well as (3) focused, i.e.,
specialization of, production activities. The extent to which these effects are
implemented affects the extent to which performance effects are achieved, in terms
of, for example, shorter-order lead-times, improved responsiveness, decreased
inventory costs, and increased speed, and reduced cost of new product development.
The role of time It takes time and money to implement and make the best use of
modularity. Creating modularity requires a large amount of upfront development
costs as well as resources. Modularity facilitates incremental and modular inno-
vation. However, over time, architectural innovation could be needed, which may
be difﬁcult to cope with for a company whose performance is based on an
established architecture. Finally, the learning curve effect is fostered by the reuse
of standards, both in terms of modules and interfaces, which, in the long run,
improves speed, quality, reliability, and, thereby, reduces costs.
4.2 Further Research
Figure 1 together with the operationalizations proposed in this article will provide
the basis for the development of a survey questionnaire. In preparing that instru-
ment, the role of context needs to be addressed as well, considering that, for
example, product modularity may prove to be overkill in very stable markets and
458

in markets where there is no need for high product variety. In environments with
very volatile changes in, for example, product technology, or demanding very
levels of high customization, modularity may not be the appropriate solution,
either. As Ernst [11] highlights, a feature of modular systems is their rigidity, as
interface standards are difﬁcult to adjust. Any transition to a new generation of
design architecture requires fundamental changes in system components, and if
these transitions are required too often, product modularity may not be the correct
solution [11].

Production and Resource Scheduling
in Mass Customization with Dependent
Setup Consideration
Izabela Nielsen, Grzegorz Bocewicz and Ngoc Anh Dung Do
Abstract Mass customization has been implemented in services and manufactures to
increase the competitiveness of companies. In a manufacturing company, the procedure
for production and resource scheduling has to be changed to adapt to mass custom-
ization. A good production and resource scheduling will contribute to the success of
mass customization. This paper addresses the problem of production and resource
scheduling for a production system with dependent setup and internal transportation
such as AGVs in a mass customization environment. A constraint-programming-based
methodology is developed to satisfy the customer demands on-time. An example is
presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology.

1 Introduction
Nowadays, customers prefer highly customized products and require their orders
to be fulﬁlled quickly [5]. Large variety demands make difﬁculty in planning and
fast reacting when getting orders from customers (online rescheduling). Changing
from traditional production policy where high-leveled customization is produced
with high production cost [3, 9] to mass customization which can reduce pro-
duction cost while keeping the same quality of product and on-time delivery to

satisfy diversiﬁed demands will bring success to the company [4]. In mass cus-
tomization, using ﬂexible manufacturing systems including advanced manufac-
turing machinery such as computer numerical control (CNC), robots, and
automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) can provide a high output rate, easily change to
producing similar products, and quickly fulﬁll the orders of customers with high-
customization and low-production cost. Improving the efﬁciency of supply and
distribution chains helps the manufacturer to follow the production plan and to
deliver products on-time. However, in mass customization, production managers
have to deal with large variety, small batch sizes, random arrival of orders, and
wide span of due dates [13] while keeping the production costs as low as mass
production. Moreover, it is not easy to use the traditional method to schedule and
allocate resources in production planning when manufacturers change to the
implementation of mass customization. In a manufacturer, several production
policies are implemented such as make-to-order, make-to-stock, etc., but they are
not relevant to mass customization. For example, make-to-order policy is inefﬁ-
cient because it does not utilize the similarity and modularity of products and
makes higher production cost than mass production. Make-to-stock gets trouble
with the large variety. These limitations bring a challenge to the development of a
new approach for production and resource scheduling in mass customization.
There are many researches in production planning and scheduling which vary from
simple to complicated production line. Some of them concern the use of AGVs or
mobile robots in production. Optimizing the schedule for both machine and AGV
is very difﬁcult, and it is more complicated for the case of multiple AGVs due to
avoiding the collision of AGVs when they are moving. On the other hand, the
sequence of products to be manufactured is an issue because of customization. In
mass customization, the demand on products cannot be counted as the total
demand during planning horizon. It means that an amount of a product has to be
delivered at a certain point of time in the planning horizon and the deadline of
producing a product is considered in making the production plan. Therefore, the
production manager has to decide on a production scheduling which can satisfy the
demand on-time and what the resource scheduling is so that the corresponding
output rate (production rate) can guarantee producing enough products to satisfy
demand. Optimizing production scheduling is more difﬁcult when the setup is
dependent on cost and time. Different production sequences can make different
make-spans due to dependent setup, which affects the delivery time. In mass
customization, the manager has to decide when and how many units of a type of
product to be produced regarding the deadlines of delivery.
In this paper, we consider the problem of production and resource scheduling
for a production system where mass customization is implemented. The setup time
and cost are dependent on the sequence of products, and there exists internal
transportation (e.g., AGVs). The production plan must assure that the demands
from customers are satisﬁed on-time. It is less efﬁcient if production scheduling
(e.g., product sequence) and resource scheduling (e.g., AGVs scheduling) are not
simultaneously considered. This paper is aimed to develop a novel methodology to
deal with both production and resource scheduling with dependent setup in a mass

customization environment. This paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2, we
present the motivation of this paper; the description of considered system is shown
in Sect. 3; the problem formulation and solution algorithm are presented in Sects. 4
and 5; an example is provided in Sect. 6 to illustrate the performance of proposed
algorithm; and this paper ends with the conclusion in Sect. 7.
2 Motivation
In this paper, a production system, which includes a set of machines and a set of
AGVs to transport semi-ﬁnished goods among the machines, is considered. Dif-
ferent products have different sequences of production processes. When the pro-
duction system changes to producing another type of product, the machines need
to be setup and this setup is dependent meaning that the required cost and time for
setup depend on the sequence of two products. There are two main problems in
this system. The ﬁrst one concentrates on how to make a production plan to satisfy
the customer demand in a planning horizon considering sequence-dependent setup.
This problem is a well-known NP-hard problem. Many studies are conducted on
these problems for single machine or parallel machines with or without sequence-
dependent setup [1, 6, 7]. The second main problem is the AGVs scheduling
problem. The aim of AGV scheduling is to dispatch a set of AGVs to achieve the
goals for a batch of pickup/drop-off (or P/D for short) jobs under certain con-
straints such as deadlines, priority, etc. [8, 10]. Bocewicz (2014) considers the
problem linking AGVs and production scheduling, which is treated as a scheduling
of concurrent cyclic multimodal processes. To solve it, the multi-level declarative
framework is implemented using constraint-programming techniques. It is more
complicated if we consider mass customization manufacturing that is characterized
by short product life cycles with large mix and low-volume products in a rapidly
changing environment [13]. The production system has to change frequently to
satisfy the large variety of demands and utilize the automated machines such as
CNC and AGVs to rapidly change to producing new product. Therefore, the
manager has to consider the production plan including production scheduling and
resource scheduling. However, these two problems are considered independently
in traditional production system. The contribution of this paper is to develop a
methodology to make a plan for production scheduling and resource scheduling
simultaneously with dependent setup in mass customization.
3 Systems of Concurrent Cyclic Processes (SCCPs)
The problem of production and AGVs scheduling is based on the AGVs system
shown in Fig. 1a. The digraph shown in Fig. 1b represents AGV system from
Fig. 1a) where six cyclic local processes P1 - P6 encompassing AGVs operations

are distinguished. Processes passing transportation sectors (resources) interact via
common shared resources. Their routes are speciﬁed as follows: p1 = (R2, R3),
p2 = (R1, R3), p3 = (R3, R4, R6), p4 = (R3, R5, R6), p5 = (R6, R7), p6 = (R6, R8),
where: R3, R6—are shared resources, since each one is used by at least two
processes, R1, R2, R4, R5, R7, R8—are non-shared as each one is exclusively used
by only one process.
Apart from local processes, we consider two concurrent multimodal processes
(representing manufacturing routes [2]): mP1, mP2. In these kinds of processes, the
execution of operations is realized commonly with appropriate operations of local
processes. In other words, processes are executed along the parts of cyclic local
processes. The routes of considered multimodal processes are distinguished by red
mP1, and blue mP2 color lines, in Fig 1. Processes represent two manufacturing
routes which are used for mass production of two kinds of products (distinguished
as products A and B). The multimodal process route specifying how a multimodal
process is executed can be seen as the composition of the route parts of local cyclic
process. So, the routes mP1, mP2 are: mp1 = ((R1, R3), (R3, R4, R6), (R6, R7)),
mp2 ¼
R1; R3
ð
Þ; R3; R5; R6
ð
Þ; R6; R7
ð
Þ
ð
Þ, where: (R1, R3), (R3, R4, R6), (R6, R7)—
parts of routes p2, p3, p6 included in mp1, (R1, R3), (R3, R5, R6), (R6, R7)—parts
(subsequences) of routes p1, p4, and p5 included in mp2.
Both, local and multimodal, processes interact on the basis of mutual exclusion
protocol while sharing common resource (transportation sector). The possible
resource conﬂicts are resolved with the help of assumed priority-dispatching rules
determining the order in which processes make their access to common shared
resources. For instance, in case of the resource R3, the priority-dispatching rules:
r0
3 ¼ P2; P3; P2; P3; P1; P4
ð
Þ; r1
3 ¼ mP1; mP1; mP2
ð
Þ (see Fig. 1b) determine the
orders in which local and multimodal processes can access to the shared resource
R3. A sequence r0
3 means that the ﬁrst access is for process P2, and next to P3 and
once again to P2, and next P3, P1, P4, and so on. So, the SCCP is speciﬁed by the

4 Problem Formulation
The behaviors of system (1) can be seen as a cyclic schedule representing the
cyclic production of product A and B. Formally, the cyclic schedule of SCCP is
deﬁned in following way [2]:
XSC ¼
X; a
ð
Þ; mX; ma
ð
Þ
ð
Þ
ð2Þ
where: X = {X1, X2, …, Xi, …, Xn}—the set contains the sequences Xi ¼
xi;1; . . .; xi;w0
i lr ið Þ


which elements xi,j determine the moments of operation oi,j
beginning in the l-th cycle: xi;jðlÞ ¼ xi;j þ l  a; l 2 Z;
xi;j lð Þ

2 Z—the moment
when the operation oi,j starts its execution in the l-th cycle, a—denotes the peri-
odicity of local processes: a ¼ xi;j l þ 1
ð
Þ  xi;j lð Þ. mX = {mX1, …, mXi, …,
mXw}—the set of sequences, mXi ¼
mxi;1; . . .; mxi;w1
i lm ið Þ


, where: mxi,j—vari-
able specifying the value mxi,j(l): mxi;j lð Þ ¼ mxi;j þ l  ma; l 2 Z; ma—denotes the
periodicity of multimodal processes: ma ¼ mxi;j l þ 1
ð
Þ  mxi;j lð Þ.
Figure 2a shows the graphical representation of the cyclic schedule XSC cor-
responding with a possible production mode of system from Fig. 1. In this mode,
two streams of process mP1 and one stream of process mP2 are ﬁnished in one
cycle. In other word, two units of product A and one unit of product B are com-
pleted within 14 units of time (u.t.) (14 u.t.—is a periodicity of one cycle of mode
I). In that context, the rate of product A of mode I is equal to two: rpA;1 ¼
2 units/period and rate of product B is equal to one: rpB;1 ¼ 1 units/period. Modes
II and III (Fig. 2b, c) are characterized by different periodicity: a2 ¼ 16 u:t: and
a3 ¼ 12 u:t:
and
different
production
rates:
rpA;2 ¼ 1 unit/period;
rpC;2 ¼
2 units/period (mode II) and rpB;2 ¼ 2 units/period; rpC;2 ¼ 1 unit/period (mode
III).
In the case of SCCP, the problems of rescheduling (problem of cyclic behavior
transitions) between many different cyclic schedules play a special role. In Fig. 3,
the example of transition between the schedules of modes I and II is presented.
Considered transition allows ﬁnishing the production of products A and B (mode I)
and start new ones C and A (mode II). Please note that a transition requires an
additional delays (the setup times) caused by a preparation of resources to new
operations. The duration time of the transition from Fig. 3 is equal to 31 u.t.
(st1,2 = 31)
and
the
production
rates:
rpA;1;2 ¼ 2 units/period and rpB;1;2 ¼
2 units/period.
Of course, similar transitions are possible for the rest variants: Mode
II ? Mode I; Mode I ? Mode III, Mode III ? Mode I, Mode II ? Mode III,
Mode III ? Mode II. All of them were evaluated using approach based on the
ﬁnding the states with common allocation of processes [2] and presented as a
digraph on the Fig. 4. In that context, we consider the following problem:

The solution of CS problem is a sequence V representing schedule of SCCP modes
and sequences PA, PB, PC, PT the values of which satisfy all constraints C (4)–
(11). To solve this kind of problem, the constraint-programming environments
ILOG, ECLiPSe [12], Mozart are used [2, 11].

6 Illustrative Example
An SCCP shown as Fig. 1 is given. It can work in three modes (see Fig. 2) with
transactions presented on the Fig. 4. Three kinds of products: A, B, C should be
produced according to the following limits (determined by the customer
requirements):
• product A: 70 units within 800 u.t. and 200 units within 3,100 u.t.,
RA1 = 70; HA1 = 800; RA2 = 200; HA2 = 3,100;
• product B: 110 units within 1,400 u.t., RB = 110; HB = 1,400;
• product C: 100 units within 1,700 u.t. and 270 units within 2,900 u.t.,
RC1 = 100; HC1 = 1,700; RC2 = 270; HC2 = 2,900;
The answer to the following question is sought: ‘‘Does there exist a schedule of
SCCP (a sequence V) which guarantees the production of product A, B, C, on given
levels RA1,RA2 RB, RC1, RC2 in given horizon times HA1, HA2 HB, HC1, HC2?’’
The one admissible solution is shown in Fig. 5. It has been obtained in
OzMozart, Dual Core, 2.67 GHz, 4.0 GB RAM environment in 7 s (25,438 steps
of constraint propagation and variables distribution). The presented schedule
allows satisfying all given production constraints.

7 Concluding Remarks
In this paper, production and AGVs scheduling in mass customization are con-
sidered. The combination of production and AGVs scheduling in mass custom-
ization has not been studied, and this paper proposes a methodology to ﬁll this gap.
A procedure based on CSP is developed to ﬁnd a solution which satisﬁes the
constraints on production level and time horizon. Modeling problem as CSP and
implementing it by constraint-programming techniques can reduce computation
time to adapt with random orders which frequently occur in mass customization.
By satisfying the product-level constraint, the solution guarantees to fulﬁll the
large variety of demands. On the other hand, by satisfying the time horizon
constraint, the solution assures that the products are on-time delivered to the
customer, and this will increase the competitiveness of the manufacturer. More-
over, the lower production costs increase competiveness and proﬁt. The applica-
tion of this paper is very promising as: (1) the methodology can be implemented to
mass customization production systems; (2) it assists the manufacturer to reduce
cost when changing production system and plan for mass customization; (3) the
proposed procedure can obtain a feasible solution very quickly (within 7 s in the
illustrated example). This paper can be extended by developing a methodology for
online control and fuzzy control where unforeseen situations occur, for example
production line break-down or order changing from key customers.

Scaling Up Local and Individualized
Solutions, Challenging Existing Logic
Nicola Morelli
Abstract This paper is based on a recently completed EU-funded project, aimed
at creating location-based and socially networked services to support elderly
people’s independent life. The project team created a platform of services for
elderly people in four EU locations. It included the development of a business
model to ensure the economic sustainability of the services beyond the funding
period. Elderly people, as commonly known, are reluctant to use new technology
and are especially difﬁdent of open social networking systems, because of the
openness of those systems, that risk to undermine the urgent need of trust and
safeness. The Life 2.0 platform is highly related to a real-life context of senior
people. This has implications on the scalability of the platform. This paper anal-
yses the lesson learned and proposes some insights into how the diffusion of
innovation based on local and personal solutions challenges the common scala-
bility logics.
1 The Logical Context
Demographical and social transformation are challenging the social and economic
structure of our communities, imposing a deep review of the strategies to address
existing and emerging social needs.
One of the main evidences of such changes is the unbalance between active and
passive population, caused by broad social and economic phenomena, such as
unemployment, migration and population ageing. This will require a radical
revision of welfare policies and a radical redesign of public services [1, 2].

One of the emerging issues for government and public institutions is the need for a
revision of assistance services and infrastructures for senior people. A proportionally
larger number of elderly people are going to require a bigger amount of resources,
but the present economic crisis and the growing disproportion between active and
passive citizens is urging governments to consider a new approach to services that
considers supporting senior people as much as possible in their own home [3].
The existing welfare services are grounded on the idea that elderly people be
passive receivers of assistance, unable to perform many fundamental functions in
their everyday life. This in fact represents a limit of the existing system, because it
does not consider that the senior population is very diverse in its components, their
capabilities are different; many people in the third age may not have the physical
strength of their youth, but they still have enormous residual capabilities and
resources, including time, knowledge and skills that are sometimes disappearing.
Several governments are considering activating citizens’ residual capabilities to
co-produce new solutions. This approach would bring institutions closer to citi-
zens’ needs and possibly offer higher service quality for a proportionally lower
cost [4].
This methodological approach has been used in the Life 2.0 project to develop
an online platform to support social interaction, thus facilitating the exchange of
knowledge and favours, supporting the organization of individual and group ini-
tiatives and even individual entrepreneurship.
The experience in the Life 2.0 project, however, suggests an interesting chal-
lenge that possibly concerns several other services that are based on an active
participation of individual citizens to the process of value creation.
The economic sustainability of highly personalized and localized services, like
Life 2.0, requires a new approach to scalability, so that the knowledge and
resources used in an individual instance of the service can also be reused and
replicated in other contexts or for other communities. The condition of person-
alization and the strong link to the local context makes the traditional idea of a
wildﬁre diffusion of the service totally inadequate. One can no longer expect those
services to increase the number of users from a small community to millions of
users, as it happened for several social networking applications that were basically
geographically independent.
The considerations about the possible replication and expansion of the Life 2.0
platform suggest some interesting insights into alternative scalability strategies.
2 The Life 2.0 Project
At the end of 2010, a group of 12 partners, including universities, organizations,
companies and public administrations, started an EU-funded project called Life
2.0. The project aimed at generating service-based solutions to support elderly
people’s independent life, through a platform that is exploring the advantages of
geographical positioning systems and social networking.
474
N. Morelli

The project, now almost completed, is proposing interesting insights to
understand how a different kind of innovative solutions can be scaled up from local
to wider geographical contexts.
The Life 2.0 project has been carried out in four different locations: Aalborg
(Denmark), Joensuu (Finland), Barcelona (Spain) and Milano (Italy). In each of
those locations, a group of 20–40 elderly people has been contacted and involved
in the co-development and testing of a platform of online services.
The level of participation of elderly people to the project has been very high,
with continuous feedbacks on the design of the platform components. The co-
creation process reinforced users/testers’ sense of ownership to the platform,
besides creating a strong social and human link with the project personnel.
In two cases (Aalborg and Barcelona), the project has been associated to an
existing community: in Aalborg, the project has been located in a training centre,
where elderly people meet daily or weekly, to make physical exercise, knit, play
cards, discuss or have dinner together. In Barcelona, the project has been placed in
‘‘Agora’’, an association of volunteers located in the area of Sant Marti, where
elderly people attend courses and meetings. In Finland and Milano, the community
of elderly people has been ‘‘created’’ around the local library, with the help of
existing organizations operating in the area. As a result of the project, groups of
users have been formed (in Milano and Joensuu) or reinforced (in Aalborg and
Barcelona) beyond the online contact between them.
3 What is Life 2.0?
The Life 2.0 platform is the playground for a series of activities and exchanges of
knowledge, information and help between elderly, local associations/organiza-
tions, and local businesses. The platform includes three main components:
• Announcements: here, people can offer or request help to others. The nature of
such help is usually very different. According to the seniors that tested the
platform, it is sometimes hard to classify posts in this category as ‘‘help’’: they
could range from real help to solve IT problems to the proposal to walk together
to the church or the supermarket.
• Events: here, local organizations (the local church, activity centres, associations
and clubs) can post announcements of initiatives and events that happen in the
neighbourhood
• Market place: here, local businesses can post ads or even proposals for per-
sonalized services, such as special menu of the day, special offer of the week, to
elderly people in the area.
The access to the platform is strictly regulated in each location, by a local
administrator that only accepts users if they are personally or directly known. For
the duration of the project, the administrator is a researcher from the project, but in
Scaling Up Local and Individualized Solutions, Challenging Existing Logic
475

the post-funding period, the administrator should be a person that personally
knows the users or is able to have enough knowledge about the users to guarantee
trust in the community. Usually, personnel of an activity centre, or associations,
can have this role.
About 40 people in each community are using the Life 2.0 platform at present.
Some organizations are posting relevant events and some businesses (e.g. local
foot massage, local supermarket or a national producer of aids products) are
posting ads (but not yet personalized offerings) on the platform.
4 Main Features and Limitations of the Life 2.0 System
The main feature of the project is the strong link between online presence and
direct and personal contact between the users. The Life 2.0 platform has never
been proposed as an alternative to personal contact. Users were well aware of the
existence of social networking platforms, such as Facebook, and in few cases, they
also had a proﬁle in some social networks. However, users considered those
platforms quite impersonal unsafe and unattractive, because they are open, they
refer to very broad contexts, beyond the geographically perceivable limits of their
everyday life, and because those networks link unknown or unfamiliar people.
The platform is strongly linked to everyday real life. Life 2.0 services help
people organizing a walk to the local supermarket, solving practical problems,
organizing parties and supporting seniors in many other practical functions. This
means that the platform is complementary, rather than alternative to real life. The
platform makes the condition possible, for an augmented neighbourhood, in which
the increased knowledge about what is going on in the area is giving more
opportunities to solve practical problems, but also to reinforce social cohesion.
The other characteristic of the platform is the direct personal contact between
people in the community and the community administrator. This ensures trust
among people and between people and the platform, which has been identiﬁed by
the testers as a critical requirement.
This characteristic is at the same time a positive feature of the system—because
it encourages elderly peoples’ participation—and a limitation of the platform—
because the limits of the community correspond to the number of people that are
personally known by the administrator. This feature has been critical when shaping
the scalability and business model.
5 Evaluation Criteria for Life 2.0
Evaluation criteria for this platform are qualitative and not obvious; because of the
high social and cultural implications, the service has on elderly people’s life. Two
parameters that may be used for an evaluation are relevance and trust.
476
N. Morelli

5.1 Relevance
As many other social networking applications, the value of the Life 2.0 platform
could be measured by users’ participation in the platform. Users’ participation is
not necessarily proportional with the amount of information or activities posted on
the platform, nor is this parameters linearly linked to the number of registered users.
In other words, the platform can include a lot of information without being relevant
to users, or it can include a lot of users, but being used by only few of them.
In this platform, as in any online environments, an enormous amount of
information available is not necessarily absorbed and used in everyday life. A
platform full of information would require elderly people to dedicate more
attention to it and therefore would inevitably put Life 2.0 in competition to their
everyday life, their personal and social needs. The dialectic interaction between
over abundance of information, whatever relevance it may have, and users’ ﬁlter
generated by their attention resources can be analysed as an economy of attention
[5, 6]. This approach is very relevant for the business framework for the Life 2.0
project.
In fact the Life 2.0 platform can also be seen as the marketplace in which
information-based service offers will meet users’ attention. Relevance will be the
main catalyst for user attention. Attention is the internal currency in the exchange
of information within the platform.
Not only will the services need to have high and personal relevance for users,
but also the platform itself. This is the reason why the content of the platform
cannot just have a functional and commercial character (e.g. services to elderly
people); but it has to include information (e.g. events, mutual help offering or
simply communication opportunities) the value of which can hardly be quantiﬁed
in economic terms. Elderly will pay more attention to what is relevant for their
everyday life, when the online content of the platform will seamlessly mix with
their real life. Of course their direct participation to the deﬁnition of the content (in
the form of calls for participation, recommendations, help offering and even ser-
vice offering to their neighbours) will increase their attention resources spent on
the platform. Elderly people’s chances to be directly involved in each activity will
be a ﬁlter for the offerings on the Life 2.0 platform. At the same time, the pos-
sibility for elderly people to generate content on the platform will widen the
window of attention for the services offered in the platform.
5.2 Trust
Trust is linked to the number of users connected to the platform, their social
proximity and their geographical location.
As mentioned before, trust is a basic requirement for elderly people to be part of
the platform. Given the strong link of the platform to the local context, trust can be
Scaling Up Local and Individualized Solutions, Challenging Existing Logic
477

achieved by making sure that the online presence is parallel and overlapping with
the real interaction between people in a neighbourhood. Trust is also ensured by
the presence of an administrator, or a centre, where the participants are known and
can be identiﬁed by a person. This means that the expansion of the model cannot
be wide and seamless, but has to progress by ‘‘circles’’ or communities (Fig. 1).
Each community will guarantee trustworthy interaction to its users. When the
online community becomes larger than the number of people the administrator
knows personally, no new users can be added, unless another community or
another ‘‘centre’’ is set up, with a new administrator. Of course, there could be
overlapping between two different communities, but the participation of a user to
more than one community has to be mediated by the administrators.
Both the parameters illustrated above, relevance and trust, suggest that the
strategies to scale up the Life 2.0 platform cannot be based on a generic model of
diffusion of innovation. Instead of a ‘‘wildﬁre’’ innovation pattern, those param-
eters suggest a development ‘‘by community’’. It is not the number of users that
should expand to scale up Life 2.0, but the number of communities.
6 The Life 2.0 Ecosystem
The Life 2.0 business model is based on a modular structure. The modularization is
based on capabilities, knowledge and skills. Each module describes an actor type
in the system and its role. Here, below and in Fig. 2, the modules and their
characteristics are described.

6.1 Users
Users are typically elderly people living in a speciﬁc area, but this category of
users can also include relatives (children, grandchildren) or friends, of elderly
people. Users are not supposed to pay to access the platform, but of course, they
should pay for accessing the services offered on the platform by local business
(e.g. restaurant, training).
Capabilities: Beside their economic capability, that allows them to access to the
commercial services offered on the platform, their main ‘‘currency’’ in this platform
is attention. Their attention, measured by the amount of their posts, answers to
others’ posts or active participation and adds value to the platform.
Knowledge: elderly people provide personal, un-codiﬁed knowledge, con-
cerning social links, events, initiatives and geographically located information. The
relevance of this knowledge is often local, that means that the value they can add to
the platform is also strongly related to their location.
Skills: elderly people have often limitations in using IT facilities; to address
this, the platform has been co-designed with them, to make sure its technical
characteristics matches the users with the lowest technical skills.

6.2 Community Providers
The community providers are organizations (e.g. seniors’ associations, local
interest groups) or public entities (such local municipalities), that are able to
aggregate a number of senior citizens, thus becoming the tangible reference for the
users of the Life 2.0 platform.
Capabilities: Community providers usually have a physical location, where
events or gathering are organized. Their role is to moderate, promote and ensure
trust among the users. Community providers should own the platform at the local
level.
Knowledge: Community providers have the critical social knowledge that would
allow the network to be formed and grow. They have the basic function of aggre-
gating people. Without this knowledge, the mere existence of an IT platform for
exchanging information would not have too many chances of success among elderly
people. The personnel in this organizations indeed has personal and direct knowl-
edge of all the members of the network and can moderate and encourage the par-
ticipation in the activities on the platform.
Skills: The skills of personnel working at community providers are not neces-
sarily technical; they may not be able to manage complex technical problems (such
as installation of the platform, updates and new applications). For those operations,
they need the support of technical brokers. Community providers should also
collect money from the sponsors; however, small organizations may not be legally
or organizationally ﬁt for this, and therefore, they may need the support of external
organization or a federation of community providers. In some cases, like in Den-
mark, this role can be covered by local administrations that coordinate different
activity centres.
6.3 Event Organizers/Hub
The project team deﬁned with the term hub all the organizations around which the
local everyday life of elderly people is usually based. Hubs include local associ-
ations, training centres, sport clubs and churches. Most of the hubs are not sup-
posed to pay to access the platform, although some of them (local cinema, theatre,
bowling), may be requested to pay a fee to access the service.
Capabilities: Likewise community providers, hubs are organizations and groups
that aggregate people, but their function in the platform does not concern the
coordination of the activities. Hubs add content to the platform in the form of public
events or initiatives for a larger number of users (users can also organize events, but
those events are usually for a restricted number of people).
Knowledge: Hubs have a good social understanding of the local area and
interpret the need for entertaining, spiritual, sport or social activities. Their
480
N. Morelli

knowledge is usually localized, although some events may have a wider relevance
and connect different communities
Skills: usually, people from hubs adding events to Life 2.0 do not have high
technical skills. In many cases, the contributors from hubs are themselves elderly
people and have the same need for simplicity and clarity as users.
6.4 Local Businesses
Local businesses included in the platform are usually small commercial activities
that users already know personally, such as foot massage, local supermarket or
local restaurants. Those business activities can reach elderly people with person-
alized offers (e.g. the menu of the day) or with online services (such as booking/
payment) that can supplement personal services. However, some of those busi-
nesses may have wider target group and therefore be interested in participating in a
system that is broader than a single community. Also their contact with the system
may not directly come through community providers, but through a ‘‘coordinator’’
of such providers, such as local administrator or a federation of community pro-
viders. Local businesses are supposed to pay to access the platform.
Capabilities: Local businesses are adding value to the platform in the form of:
• Real personalized services proposed to citizens
• Ads targeting users in a community or across communities
• Money paid to the platform administration to access the platform
Knowledge: Local businesses provide content to the platform in the form of
codiﬁed knowledge, technical skills and specialized services to elderly people.
Skills: Although many people in local businesses do not have high technical
skills, those actors are supposed to have a more active role in the platform. In long
terms, they are supposed, for instance, to develop applications that may be con-
nected to Life 2.0 through appropriate API; such applications will be essential to
support personalized services.
6.5 Technical Broker
Technical brokers are the actors that will install the platform at the local level and
ensure a constant technical support to community providers. In some instances
though, technical brokers may be the owners of the platform and promote it to
local communities.
Capabilities: Technical brokers are adding value to the platform by providing
their technical support. They may also develop new applications that address
emerging needs from customers.
Scaling Up Local and Individualized Solutions, Challenging Existing Logic
481

Knowledge: likewise the social knowledge of community providers, the tech-
nical knowledge needed to run the platform is essential for the existence of the
platform. In some cases, technical brokers may integrate the platform in their
existing offering to local communities.
Skills: Technical brokers are not supposed to have high social skills, that means
that their capability to reach users may be limited, especially for the target group of
elderly people. Their technical skills are complemented by the community pro-
viders’ social skills.
6.6 Funder
Because of the initial installation costs, and constant personnel costs, the Life 2.0
platform may need to be supported by a funder organization that could be a public
or private institution. In some instances, this role could be covered by
public administrations. In this historical moment in fact, consistent cuts in the
public budget are common to many local administrations; however, the Life 2.0
platform offers elderly people a concrete possibility to activate local resources,
such as other elderly people, their families, their neighbours; that would ensure a
better life quality and a sense of independence.
Capabilities: Besides the ﬁnancial capabilities, that would add immediate
support to the platform, the funding organization could have a more active role, as
catalyzer of new communities and coordinator of the ﬁnancial support for a fed-
eration of communities. In this role, they could also reinforce the trust in the
individual community providers.
Knowledge: Although no particular knowledge is required from this actor, the
funding organizations may provide knowledge and skills to set up new commu-
nities. Furthermore, their back up to a community provider may ensure trust among
the users.
Skills: Funders should add the ﬁnancial skills that would allow community
providers to operate, especially in the earliest phases of the project.
7 Discussion: Models for Scaling Up the Life 2.0 Platform
The description of the ecosystem and its actors clearly shows a direct and tight link
between the online and the real community. These characteristics describe a sort of
hybrid social network, in which logical, geographical and personal relationships
are equally relevant. Each instance of the platform is anchored to a real and local
context, because the information it includes is also local and very personal to its
users. However, not all the actors are necessarily focusing on the same geo-
graphical context. Local businesses, for instance, may ﬁnd a single community too
limited and would not consider accessing to the platform, unless they have access
482
N. Morelli

to multiple communities. The same applies for hubs, although most of them do not
pay. Even elderly users may ﬁnd the community limiting, if they live in border
areas between two communities or have friends in communities where they do not
live. The need for relevance and trust, however, would make a ‘‘wildﬁre’’
development of the platform unthinkable. A Life 2.0 community cannot exceed the
number of people the administrator knows personally. Other mechanisms have
obviously been considered, such as invitation and referral, but the participants
were difﬁdent to forms of diffusion that would widen the network beyond their
local community. They explicitly declared that the advantage of this platform, with
respect to other open social networking applications, is the fact that its access is
limited and controlled.
Unlike many other online social networking applications, which are indepen-
dent from the geographical context in which the participants are located, Life 2.0
can only expand if new ecosystems are set up in different local context. The
community provider is the catalyst for each ecosystem. All the other actors will
connect with the community providers.
Local business or technical providers may take part to more than one com-
munity, as they need to reach larger group of users. Those actors are still working
to scale up their services, whereas other actors, such as the community providers
are working to defend the borders of the community. The two logics, however, are
not competing, they are rather complementary: a strong community, with a strong
participation, will increase users’ attention, and therefore give more value to each
post or paid service offered by the business companies in the platform. On the
other hand, technical providers or local businesses taking part to a community
could act as bridge users of the platform, as new community providers may use
their presence in their area to build a new network.
The question of new models for scaling up similar cases for social innovation is
quite new to the literature. Many authors have focused on social network potential
to generate social innovation [7, 8], but they did not propose any broad reﬂection
on a model to scale up innovation generated by social networks. The innovation
they mention is either relying on existing social networks or assumes that the
diffusion of new applications will follow a logic of wildﬁre expansion. The
parameters of relevance and trust have been considered also critical for the dif-
fusion of social networks, but the link to the geographical location has never been
considered as a binding condition for scaling up, but rather an outcome of speciﬁc
approach to the use of such applications.
The question of scalability has been analysed from a technical perspective;
Pujol et al. [9], for instance, focus on strategies that replicate bridge users to scale
up fully distributed systems. Although this approach focuses on the technical
organization of online social networks, without any reference to the social char-
acteristics of its users, the exploration of the parallel development of scaling-up
strategies for fully distributed ICT systems and hybrid social networks, such as
Life 2.0, could provide interesting insights.

8 Conclusion
The dynamic proposed by the Life 2.0 project and its model of expansion is
challenging the existing logic to scale up innovation.
The existing model is based on the most known examples of diffusion of
applications, such as Facebook or Twitter. Those applications were relying on
logical links between participants (interest, friendship, collaboration), but were
basically geographically independent, although the geographical proximity of the
participants was an obvious reason for establishing new friendships on those
networks.
The new model instead is deeply rooted in the geographical context. The social
links often exist before the creation of the application and the application is usually
augmenting the existing links, adding a new layer of information. The two fun-
damental parameters for the creation of such network do not hinder scaling up, but
impose a new mechanism of expansion.
Scaling up Life 2.0 is not an obvious exercise, because it requires that the
ecosystem be appropriately structured according to the modular structure sug-
gested in this paper and the roles and competences of each of the actors are clearly
deﬁned. Of course, the Life 2.0 project represents just a case, but the conditions it
represent may be common to many other cases in which services, especially public
services, are designed to address personal or very local instances. The time is
coming for rethinking the way public and private services should be planned and
scaled up from local contexts to wider geographical areas, and Life 2.0 proposes
some critical reﬂections on how this can be done.

Strategic Capabilities to Manage
High-Variety Production Environments:
The Role of Underlying Activities
and Organizational Resources
Frank Steiner and Moritz Wellige
Abstract Product offerings (PO) with a high number of product variants have
become a standard in today’s industrial manufacturing sector and are also
becoming increasingly popular in business-to-consumer markets. Increasingly,
more companies pursue such a strategy as they hope to beneﬁt from the com-
petitive advantage that arises from the opportunity to address every customer
individually. However, adapting a respective business model (BM) for high-
variety (HV) production demands profound organizational change. Existing
research suggests that companies have to develop certain strategic capabilities
when implementing such business strategies. Still, most studies lack a sufﬁcient
level of detail in the discussion of these strategic capabilities and remain vague
regarding underlying management activities and organizational resources. With
this study, we provide more detailed deﬁnitions of the strategic capabilities of
mass customization. Furthermore, we identify a comprehensive set of underlying
management activities and organizational resources and thereby facilitate the
realization of the strategic capabilities for practitioners.

1 Introduction
The development of suitable product offerings (PO) for today’s markets is strongly
affected by the level of uncertainty within the particular product domain [1–4]. In
this context, market uncertainty oftentimes is the result of changing customer
demands with regard to speciﬁc product requirements [3, 5]. Furthermore, today’s
markets are characterized by an increasing heterogeneity in customer needs [6]. In
consequence, POs with a high number of product variants have become rather
common for manufacturing companies. This trend can be observed in particular in
industrial goods’ markets, as customers in such business-to-business (B2B) set-
tings usually demand products that meet clearly deﬁned speciﬁcations [7]. Such a
‘‘lock-in’’ on strictly deﬁned product speciﬁcations typically results in low levels
of customer ﬂexibility and an increasing demand for product variety [8, 9]. Being
confronted with such business environments, manufacturers of industrial goods
need to establish new business models (BM) that are capable of dealing with high
levels of customer demand heterogeneity. Mass customization (MC) is such a BM
that aims at establishing a competitive advantage by addressing every single
customer individually [10–12].
However, adapting a respective BM for high-variety (HV) production cannot be
accomplished overnight, but demands profound organizational change [13–15].
Existing research suggests that companies have to develop certain strategic
capabilities in order to be able to successfully implement such business strategies
for HV environments. Salvador et al. [16], for example, suggest three dimensions
of strategic capabilities for the successful implementation of a MC BM, namely
‘‘solution space development’’ (SSD), ‘‘robust process design’’ (RPD), and
‘‘choice navigation’’ (CN). Despite the availability of an ample amount of liter-
ature that discusses success factors or strategic capabilities for the implementation
of a MC BM, the adoption rate of such business approaches is still surprisingly low
[17]. We assume that the reason for this development can be found in a lack of
sufﬁcient detail in the understanding of the necessary capabilities as well as related
management activities and organizational resources. Even though there is a broad
body of literature available, most studies fail to provide necessary managerial
implications for companies that would like to increase the variety of their POs. By
addressing these shortcomings of current research, we make important contribu-
tions to the ﬁeld of MC or HV production environments in general: (1) This
research extends and reﬁnes the deﬁnitions of strategic capabilities for BMs related
to HV production strategies. (2) Based on literature reviews and expert interviews,
this paper provides an extensive list of managerial activities and resources that can
strengthen a company’s ability to provide a HV PO.

2 Theory and Literature Review
In recent years, a growing number of companies have established BMs and
strategies, which are geared toward product customization and HV production,
also referred to as MC [18, 19]. Numerous examples of successful applications,
which range from the automobile industry [16] and engineered products [20] to
electronics [21, 22], demonstrate the high relevance as well as the practicability of
such strategies. Thus, customization strategies represent a promising option for
companies competing in long-tail markets that are typically characterized by
heterogeneous customer needs. However, the examples also show that some
companies are more successful than others in the realization of BMs for HV
environments. This leads to the question, whether there are certain prerequisites
that facilitate the implementation of BMs for HV productions. A review of the
literature dealing with HV production strategies and associated BMs reveals dif-
ferent management activities, procedures, and capabilities, which are regarded as
critical for a successful implementation [cf. 16, 18, 23]. For example, the literature
highlights the need for ﬂexible but also efﬁcient manufacturing processes for the
realization of large numbers of product variants [cf. 24–27]. The discussion also
includes aspects such as the necessary interaction between ﬁrms and their cus-
tomers during the speciﬁcation of an individual product [12, 18, 28–30]. A third
relevant factor is concerned with the PO: As offering limitless choice is eco-
nomically unfeasible, companies need to identify those product attributes for
which the customers require variety [16, 31–33]. This is in line with the resource-
based view, which locates the source of company success in the existence and
composition of certain resources and capabilities. Differences in performance and
divergence in competitiveness between companies are due to imperfect distribu-
tion of resources across companies [34–37]. Thus, each company represents a
unique bundle of resources that determines its competitive position [38]. In this
context, resources are deﬁned as speciﬁc tangible and intangible assets owned by
companies and—if they are difﬁcult to imitate—represent a potential source of a
sustainable competitive advantage [39].
We follow the notion that capabilities are also representing a particular type of
resource [37, 40]. Capabilities enable companies to improve the productivity of the
ordinary resources a company possesses [40]. As Amit and Schoemaker [38] point
out, capabilities ‘‘[…] are information-based, tangible or intangible processes that
are ﬁrm-speciﬁc and are developed over time through complex interactions among
the ﬁrm’s resources’’. Thus, capabilities enable companies to orchestrate activities
and utilize resources in an efﬁcient and purposeful way. Subsequently, the com-
bination of resources and capabilities that are available in a company determines
its ability to successfully realize a BM for heterogeneous markets. We expect that
an analysis of the resources and capabilities that companies use in the pursue of a
customization strategy may provide valuable insights into why some ﬁrms perform
better than others.

3 Strategic Capabilities for Customization Strategies
In order to get an overview of existing research on strategic capabilities, under-
lying activities, and routines for customization strategies, a literature review was
conducted. On the one hand, the review shows that there are only very few studies
that take a holistic perspective on MC. Instead, most studies focus on single
capabilities or speciﬁc underlying activities and organizational resources. Whereas
this allows a deeper understanding of one aspect, such focused studies can support
companies in establishing or improving a MC BM only to a limited extend.
The framework of three strategic capabilities proposed by Salvador et al. [16]
has attracted notable attention in recent years: SSD describes the ability to identify
the heterogeneities in the needs of customers and derive a suitable PO. RPD is
deﬁned as the ability to reuse or recombine given organizational and value chain
resources. Finally, CN reﬂects the ability of customization companies to support
their customers in the tasks of need speciﬁcation and product customization. We
will rely on this framework, since the literature review reveals that the organi-
zational capabilities used in this framework are frequently quoted and commonly
regarded as critical for customization strategies. However, although this frame-
work provides valuable insights into organizational capabilities that have the
potential to drive the success of customization BMs, some aspects of these
capabilities remain unclear and require to be deﬁned in a more detailed way.
Furthermore, this framework offers only a few indications about underlying
management activities and organizational resources. In order to ﬁll these gaps, we
conducted a series of expert interviews and an extensive literature review. Based
on these research activities, we will extend and reﬁne the deﬁnitions of strategic
capabilities for MC in this paper. We will also present an extensive list of man-
agerial activities and resources that underlie these capabilities.
3.1 Solution Space Development
According to the framework proposed by Salvador et al. [16], the ﬁrst step toward
a customization strategy is the development of a so-called solution space: High
levels of customer need heterogeneity oftentimes force companies to offer a high
number of product variants. Yet, offering limitless choice is economically
unfeasible; thus, companies have to make a choice, clearly deﬁning what they are
going to offer and which variants will be excluded [16]. In this context, SSD
describes the ﬁrm’s capability to understand the individual needs of its customers
and to target this heterogeneous market with a suitable selection of product
variants [14]. However, due to the myriad of customer choices, this selection
process becomes a rather complex task and is strongly inﬂuenced by uncertainty
[41–43]. This leads to a dilemma for product managers as it becomes nearly
impossible to derive a PO that is in line with the current and future market
490
F. Steiner and M. Wellige

demands at the same time [44, 45]. Therefore, the respective decision-making
processes should be designed to provide sufﬁcient ﬂexibility so that adjustments to
the initially designed solution space can be made, as new information is gained
[46, 47]. In order to take this aspect sufﬁciently into account, we propose to extend
the SSD capability by differentiating between tasks that aim at deﬁning an initial
solution space before market launch and tasks that are concerned with the adap-
tation of an existing PO. Thus, we deﬁne the two subcategories initial and adaptive
SSD in the following.
Initial Solution Space Development is deﬁned as the sum of all product
management activities that are necessary to deﬁne those variants of the new
product that will be made available at market launch. While this may consist of
tasks such as the elicitation of customer needs and the selection of necessary
product features, SSD does not include any product design activities nor the
deﬁnition of an underlying product architecture. We see two main objectives that
have to be addressed by initial SSD: In a ﬁrst step, potential design constraints
need to be identiﬁed in order to understand which product variants could realis-
tically be offered. In this context, ‘‘[d]esign constraints may be functions of the
laws of nature, the environment in which the product will function, governmental
regulations, or corporate decisions or policies’’ [48]. Secondly, the company has to
identify the customer requirements for the respective product domain in order to
identify the so-called key value attributes [33], i.e., those product attributes, along
which customer needs diverge [16, 49]. For this purpose, ﬁrms have to understand
the customers’ idiosyncratic needs and derive a selection of product options that
corresponds with the heterogeneous needs of the customers [16]. After the eval-
uation of all potentially feasible product variants and the identiﬁcation of the key
value attributes, these two sets of choice options can be synchronized to form the
initial solution space.
The separation between initial SSD and adaptive SSD allows a much more
detailed identiﬁcation of managerial activities and organizational resources that
could be applied in order to build the above-mentioned capabilities. With regard to
the recognition of potential design constraints, for example, quality function
deployment (QFD) proves to be a very well-documented approach for under-
standing technical as well as economical limitations of a product [50]. Further-
more, in order to gain a thorough understanding of all technical aspects of the
product, companies could consider approaches such as patent analysis [51],
reverse engineering of existing products, or the morphological box method [52].
For the identiﬁcation of the individual customer needs, many different market
research techniques are available. If companies are trying to gather input directly
from the customers, tools such as customer interviews or surveys [53], customer
focus groups [53] or conjoint analysis [54] could be applied, especially conjoint
analysis seems to be a suitable methodological approach to capture the hetero-
geneity of customer needs concerning speciﬁc product attributes [54, 55]. How-
ever, such a direct interaction with customers may not be able to reveal latent
customer needs. Therefore, ﬁrms might also want to consider methods that stim-
ulate the creativity of customers such as innovation toolkits [32, 56] or idea
Strategic Capabilities to Manage High-Variety Production Environments
491

contests [57]. Also, companies could try to identify such latent needs via obser-
vation techniques such as netnography [58]. Lastly, if there are already product
concepts available, the customer acceptance toward these concepts could be tested
with the help of physical, virtual, or rapid prototyping [59, 60] as well as test
market techniques [61].
Adaptive Solution Space Development is deﬁned as the sum of all manage-
ment activities that are concerned with the assessment of the market ﬁt of the
existing solution space and potential changes to this offering. In this context, ﬁt
means the level of congruency between the existing PO and the heterogeneous
customer demand within a certain product domain. If the level of ﬁt should be
insufﬁcient, the organization needs to revise, trim, or extend the available PO [16].
If adaptations have to be made, this could be achieved either with the introduction
of new choice options or with the elimination of underperforming existing variants
[42, 62]. Again, we recognize two major objectives. The ﬁrst objective is con-
cerned with the solution space ﬁt. Companies need to constantly measure some
kind of ﬁt indicator in order to be able to take any kind of corrective actions. The
second central objective of adaptive SSD is the tracking of social trends or new
technological developments. Such trends can be predictors of upcoming changes in
a company’s business environment and can thus help the ﬁrm to foresee the
necessity for changing the existing PO.
In the following, this paper will suggest managerial activities that could be
purposeful in the context of adaptive SSD. As indicated above, there should be a
controlling mechanism for the solution space ﬁt. One possible approach for this is
the use of proxy variables. Examples for such proxies could be the tracking of
customer purchase behavior, the analysis of sales data, or the monitoring of cus-
tomer complaints [63]. Customers need to be enabled to transfer their experiences
with the available PO to the manufacturer. Possible mechanisms for this transfer
range from simple feedback forms or questionnaires [64] to regular workshops
with key customers [65, 66]. Another potential activity could be the tracking of the
actual customer behavior within the customization process, especially in an online
context. In this case, click stream data including the number of hits, the search
history, or the time spent on a certain Web site can be used for this purpose [16,
67]. Also, the sales staff plays an important role in this context, as these employees
can directly interact with the customers. Thus, it is essential to link the sales
personnel with other functions of the company via speciﬁc routines, so that
potential changes or pitfalls can be immediately reported and communicated
throughout the ﬁrm [68]. Lastly, we identify the need to monitor social trends and
technological developments. For this purpose, companies need to establish cor-
porate foresight routines to identify potential disruptions of the business envi-
ronment and to turn them into business opportunities [69]. Examples of such
foresight activities are trend analyses, scenarios, or technology roadmaps [70, 71].

3.2 Robust Process Design
This capability targets the issue of additional production costs that may arise from
the increase in product variety [16]. In the context of such a BM, production is
facing a considerably higher number of parts, processes, suppliers, retailers, and
distribution channels [72]. Thus, with the increasing level of variety, the pro-
duction complexity and the uncertainty in business operations are likely to
increase as well [73]. In consequence, all parts of the value chain—ranging from
raw material procurement to production and eventually to distribution—will be
confronted with higher operational cost [14, 73]. Furthermore, increases in man-
ufacturing cycle times and shipment lead times are to be expected [74, 75]. Thus,
ﬁrms need to develop a capability that allows them to maintain the stability of
manufacturing processes and the supply chain in order to be successful in
implementing a HV BM [76]. One way to achieve this goal is the suggested RPD
capability, which is intended ‘‘to reuse or recombine existing organizational and
supply chain resources […] to deliver customized solutions with near mass-pro-
duction efﬁciency and reliability’’ [16]. Subsequently, it can be stated that a
successful BM for HV production is characterized by a stable, but still ﬂexible,
manufacturing process that provides a dynamic ﬂow of products [26, 77, 78].
However, the impact of increasing product variety on production cost cannot
only be mitigated by reconﬁguring the manufacturing process and bringing a
higher degree of ﬂexibility to the production, but product development has to be
considered as well. This paper supports the idea that the integration of certain
activities during the development of new products can lead to an improvement in
manufacturing process stability. Thus, we suggest differentiating between two
strategic capabilities in this context: RPD and ‘‘Product Design for Process
Robustness’’.
Robust Process Design. With regard to RPD, we completely follow the sug-
gestions of Salvador et al. [16] and deﬁne it as the capability that aims to achieve
the necessary robustness of manufacturing processes with respect to the hetero-
geneity of orders, by determining a suitable production system architecture and
respective logistics that facilitate an efﬁcient and ﬂexible production. As we do not
differ from the original deﬁnition in this case, the identiﬁcation of relevant man-
agerial activities is less complex: Literature suggests a number of different
activities or organizational resources that can be applied to reduce or even avoid
the additional costs of variety in manufacturing. Some of these methods will be
presented in the following.
A possible starting point for increasing the robustness of the manufacturing
process for HV POs is the implementation of process modularity [16]. This can be
put to practice by considering manufacturing and supply chain processes as seg-
ments that are necessary in order to realize speciﬁc product variants [76]. In such a
modular setting, ﬁrms can serve individual customer choices by appropriately
recombining the process segments [79]. Also, companies could consider the
concept of postponement or delayed product differentiation in manufacturing or
Strategic Capabilities to Manage High-Variety Production Environments
493

distribution logistics in order to increase process robustness. Delayed product
differentiation reorganizes the supply chain into a generic preproduction phase and
a customer-speciﬁc phase, in which a product is customized to the customers’
preferences [80–82]. Beyond reorganizations of the manufacturing process itself,
there are many new technologies available that can help to increase the process
ﬂexibility: Computer-integrated manufacturing [14, 83], ﬂexible automation [26,
79, 84], robotics [85, 86], or the use of rapid manufacturing technologies such as
3D printing [87] are some of the examples that are discussed in the literature.
Besides these ﬂexible technologies, companies need to train their employees for
dealing with novel task, so that they can be assigned ﬂexibly in the manufacturing
processes [16, 88]. Furthermore, supply chain logistics need to be reconsidered as
well: Just-in-time and just-in-sequence logistics enable a lean logistic concept that
allows prompt response times, even in case of unexpected changes [42, 89]. Lastly,
the robustness and ﬂexibility of manufacturing processes should already be con-
sidered during the development of new processes. This could be achieved by an
interdisciplinary development approach that respects the requirements and con-
cerns of all affected departments [90].
Product Design for Process Robustness. Whereas the description of RPD
provided above strongly follows the original framework of Salvador et al. [16], we
extend this framework with a new capability, namely ‘‘product design for process
robustness’’. This extension builds on the idea that the use of certain activities
during new product development can foster the robustness of the resulting man-
ufacturing processes. Similarly, Vickery et al. [91] claim that a close collaboration
of product design and development, marketing, and manufacturing is needed in
order to realize sufﬁcient product ﬂexibility. Subsequently, we formulate the fol-
lowing deﬁnition: Product design for process robustness aims to achieve the
necessary robustness of manufacturing processes with respect to the heterogeneity
of ordered product variants, by determining a product architecture that facilitates
an efﬁcient and ﬂexible production.
The operational realization of this capability can manifest itself in several
different activities and organizational resources: Firstly and most importantly, it
has to be decided whether each product variant is developed separately, or whether
the new product development process is carried out jointly for a variety of
products. Research shows that the approach of developing products one by one
oftentimes leads to a proliferation of products and parts, as issues of commonality
and standardization do not receive sufﬁcient consideration [19, 92]. Thus, literature
recommends a platform-based development approach that builds on an overall
logical structure for ‘‘generating a family of products by providing a generic
umbrella to capture and utilize commonality [, while designing] an entire class of
products […] based on individually customized requirements within a coherent
framework’’ [93]. If companies decide to follow this approach and intend to
develop a full PO in a joint development process, the deﬁnition of the product
architecture has a major impact on the manufacturability of the future product
variants [94]. The selection of a speciﬁc product architecture—e.g., integrated,
modular, or parametric—determines the ‘‘mechanism’’ that is used to reach
494
F. Steiner and M. Wellige

process ﬂexibility [95]. Thus, companies have to decide rather early, which
product architecture and which realization mechanism are best suited for the
production of the intended solution space. Lastly, cross-functional collaboration
plays an important role in developing new products: In order to guarantee
manufacturability, all relevant functional areas of the company should be inte-
grated in the development process [96]. Such a use of cross-functional teams [90,
97] or concurrent engineering methodology [19] allows the ﬁrm to integrate the
speciﬁc requirements of ramp-up management or manufacturing at an early point
of time [98, 99].
3.3 Choice Navigation
According to Salvador et al.’s [16] framework, ﬁrms pursuing a customization
strategy need to develop and implement a CN capability. From an economic point
of view, CN addresses the question how customers’ non-monetary costs associated
with the transfer of information between ﬁrms and customers can be kept as low as
possible, while the overall value for customers can be increased at the same time.
This captures one important aspect of the necessary information transfer and
interaction between a company and its customers. But, a description of this
capability that takes all relevant aspects into account, in our opinion, requires a
broader deﬁnition. Thus, we deﬁne interaction competence (IC) as a ﬁrms’ ability
to master all aspects and activities related to the necessary information transfer
during the customization process. Further, we deﬁne two subdimensions of IC,
namely external IC and internal IC.
External Interaction Competence refers to the ability of a company to efﬁ-
ciently support customers in identifying their needs and creating their own solu-
tions, such that choice complexity is minimized and/or enjoyment of the search/
conﬁguration process is maximized. As mentioned above, customizing products
according to the speciﬁc needs of each individual customer requires additional
information to be transferred between ﬁrms and their customers [6, 29, 100]. This
information transfer usually takes place in the form of an interactive process,
including the customer and the company. The aim of these processes is to identify
customers’ demands and to translate them into a product that is feasible within
given production possibilities [6, 14]. For customers and companies, interaction
processes are associated with additional transaction costs [18, 30, 101]. For cus-
tomers, the amount of these non-monetary costs depends on how they evaluate the
interaction process in terms of the effort and the perceived beneﬁts arising from it.
Customer effort is caused by the need to actively take part in the interaction
process. This can lead to dissatisfaction or may even cause the customer to not buy
any product at all [28]. Therefore, companies need to apply certain activities in
order to support customers in identifying suitable solutions, while minimizing
complexity and burden of choice [16]. Additionally, the literature on customiza-
tion offerings in B2C markets indicates that hedonic beneﬁts can be associated
Strategic Capabilities to Manage High-Variety Production Environments
495

with interaction processes: Customers expect to have a more enjoyable shopping
experience while creating their unique solution [12, 64, 101–103]. Here, hedonic
value can be induced by creative achievement [12] or a feeling of having created
something [102]. Since hedonic value is positively related to customers’ willing-
ness to pay for customized products [64], companies are asked to design their
interaction process accordingly.
The following managerial activities and organizational resources are identiﬁed
as drivers of external IC: In order to reduce the variety-induced complexity,
companies should implement an easily understandable [cf. 16, 18, 28, 30, 104,
105] and well-structured interaction process [12, 104, 105]. Provision of techno-
logical devices, such as augmented reality devices or 3D visualizers, can help
customers to get a better understanding of their own needs [106, 107] and thus can
also reduce uncertainties during the customization process. In addition, it is sug-
gested to provide customers with more information about the product and the
available customization options during the process. Such information is valuable
for the customers, since they cannot test or see the product before it will be
manufactured [28, 102, 107]. Randall et al. [104] note that different sales channels
or differently designed interaction processes provide the possibility to address
different types of consumers more precisely. For online customization offerings, it
is recommended to implement conﬁguration or software tools to interact and
codesign with customers [cf. 14, 16, 104, 105]. Other studies suggest comple-
menting online-based customization offerings with recommendation systems
[108]. Also, Dellaert and Dabholkar [107] show that interaction with trained sales
personnel makes online customization offerings less complex and more enjoyable
for customers. Similar beneﬁts may result from interacting with sales represen-
tatives in classical retail stores. They can help customers to better understand
product characteristics and to match these with their own needs more precisely
[109]. Thus, especially in ofﬂine environments, an adequate support for customers
requires a well-trained sales staff, that possesses all necessary competencies [18,
104].
Internal Interaction Competence. A prerequisite for a successful realization
of interaction processes is that all related information can be handled in an efﬁcient
way [23]. We deﬁne this capability as internal IC, which represents a companies’
ability to efﬁciently handle the ﬂow of all customer-order-speciﬁc information. On
the one hand, internal IC needs to be realized, so that customers can be provided
with distinct product-related information during interaction processes. The
importance of providing real-time feedback to customers on product conﬁgura-
tions has been stressed by different studies [6, 16, 105–107, 110–112]. Providing
product-related information helps to increase transparency of the interaction pro-
cess and reduces the risk that customers experience complexity and uncertainty
[18, 30]. Furthermore, it increases satisfaction and demand for customized prod-
ucts [111]. On the other hand, internal IC incorporates a companies’ ability to
process customer and order-speciﬁc information in order to increase the efﬁciency
of internal operations.

F. Steiner and M. Wellige

In the following, we provide management activities that may help companies to
strengthen their internal IC. Key enabler for the efﬁcient provision and processing
of information are information systems, information technologies, and conﬁgu-
ration systems [cf. 14]. These systems allow serving customers with product-
related information during the customization process in real time [111, 112]. This
includes the provision of information for a customer-speciﬁc product in regard to
feasibility [106], technical characteristics and virtual models [106, 111, 112], price
and costs [6, 107, 112], or delivery dates [106]. However, these systems also allow
for an automatic generation of information about each single product variant,
thereby increasing the efﬁciency of internal operations. For example, this includes
the preparation of bills of materials [112–114] or manufacturing-related infor-
mation [112]. Complementarily, the availability of technologies such as mea-
surement devices [14, 115–117] and appropriate (technical) sales support systems
[14, 102, 105, 118] can help to collect, process, and use information during the
interaction process and thereby may lead to an increase in process efﬁciency.
4 Conclusion
This paper provides research on strategic capabilities for companies that are facing
rather heterogeneous market conditions and that are required to provide HV POs.
In particular, our research focuses on the role of underlying activities and orga-
nizational resources that—in combination—are the building blocks for the relevant
strategic capabilities. In this context, our paper contributes mainly in two ways to
the existing research on HV production environments: Firstly, we extend and
reﬁne the deﬁnitions of capabilities for BMs related to HV production strategies.
As a starting point, our research uses the capabilities framework for MC proposed
by Salvador et al. [16], which describes three rather broadly deﬁned strategic
capabilities. Our study reﬁnes this set of capabilities by deﬁning two subcategories
for each of the three original capabilities and thus enables a detailed discussion of
potentially relevant activities and organizational resources. Secondly, we derive an
extensive list of managerial activities and organizational resources that could serve
as individual building blocks for the above-mentioned strategic capabilities (see
Appendix for a full list of activities). Subsequently, our research provides prac-
titioners with an overview of activities that can be implemented in order to
strengthen a company’s ability to provide a HV PO.
Naturally, the research approach that has been applied for authoring this paper
is not free of limitations. Two major limitations of this paper will be considered in
the following. Firstly, the results of this study are based on a literature review and
a relatively low number of expert interviews, only. In order to strengthen the
validation of the theory-based proposition of the paper, more empirical evidence in
the form of additional expert interviews might be needed. On the other hand,
however, existing research shows that the amount of eight interviews might be
sufﬁcient [119, 120]. Nevertheless, additional expert interviews could provide

497

further insights. Secondly, this study relies completely on qualitative data.
Therefore, it would be interesting to validate the results with quantitative empirical
data. Such data could be collected via a large-scale survey of companies that offer
HV

heterogeneity.
Our research results show that there is still more research needed in this ﬁeld.
For this purpose, two potential gaps that require further research will be high-
lighted in the following. Firstly, the results of this study could be extended with
regard to the managerial implications. Further research needs to support practi-
tioners in applying the identiﬁed managerial activities and organizational resources
by prioritizing the suggested approaches. A large-scale survey among manufac-
turers of HV POs could indicate which activities or routines have the strongest
impact on the respective strategic capabilities. Secondly, future research could try
to investigate the impact that individual managerial activities or routines suggested
in this paper have on the overall ﬁrm performance.

The Impact of Mass Customization
on the Artist’s Paradigm
in the Twenty-First Century
Donald M. Rattner
Abstract The image of the artist as a solitary ﬁgure who creates art that is
autonomous, physically inviolable and subject to ﬂuctuating prices has remained
relatively constant since the gallery system was established in the mid-nineteenth
century. The advent of computer-aided manufacturing and mass customization
now threatens to replace or augment that paradigm with a more democratic
alternative. This talk examines the potential form the new paradigm may take and
presents several examples of artists using mass custom technologies to create
contemporary art.
Keywords Art gallery  Art market  Contemporary art  Customizable art 
Mass customization  Modular  Modular art
The generalized perception of the contemporary artist as a creative ﬁgure in
present-day culture, as well as the workings of the ﬁne art market in which the
artist operates, have remained relatively true to their historical origins in the
nineteenth century [1] despite the upheavals experienced in other markets from
the effects of computerization. This condition raises two questions: ﬁrst, how has
the persona of the contemporary artist so far managed to resist the wave of change
that has profoundly altered so many disciplines and markets, and second, what
impact might mass customization and other digital production technologies have
on this persona and, by extension, the art market as a whole should they come to
have an impact in the future?
Addressing this latter question will necessarily be the focus of this paper, but to
explain the nature of the shift in the artist’s paradigm that will be proposed during
the discussion, it is ﬁrst necessary to describe the state of that persona as it
currently exists. Perhaps, no better single image encapsulates this persona than a
1966 photograph taken of the artist Ad Reinhardt (1913–1967) working in his New

York studio (Fig. 1) [2]. Though it was taken nearly half a century ago, this
photograph remains a superb snapshot of what it means to be an artist in the
twenty-ﬁrst century—in particular, how the artist works, what their relationship is
to the work of art and to those who buy art, how the work of art relates to its
context, and how art is sold. Each of these issues is important insofar as it is the
contention of this paper that they will all be substantially transformed in the
coming years as a result of advances in mass customization.
Looking at the photograph, one’s ﬁrst impression is likely to be of the artist
working in solitude. That solitude is most obviously conveyed by the fact that
there is no one else in the studio. Even the photographer is rendered effectively
absent by being positioned high up in the space, perhaps perched on a ladder so as
to obtain a bird’s eye view that suggests an otherworldly, omniscient vantage point
not normally associated with everyday human perspective. The extensive fore-
ground in the image occupied by a large expanse of an empty wood ﬂoor adds to
the sense of quiet emptiness. Even the city glimpsed through the plate glass
windows feels distant and quiet, perhaps because of the barrier set up between
artist and outside world that the closed windows imply, or the somewhat clouded,

low contrast effect that lays over the buildings and streetscape, in contrast to the
strong lights and darks visible on the interior side. This carefully orchestrated
image of solitude and singular focus on the work of art serves to reinforce the
image of the contemporary artist as an autonomous, heroic, self-enveloped genius
whose creativity springs entirely from within.
That introspective quality is further reinforced by the lack of any ﬁgurative
models or other points of references among the room’s furnishings and para-
phernalia, and by the artist’s indifference to the city outside. These are not arbi-
trary qualities, but signiﬁers of the artist’s persona, for the lack of connection to
external realities is aesthetically consistent with the abstract qualities of the canvas
the artist is painting. It is in fact one of numerous canvases within Reinhardt’s
Black Painting series of the 1960s. These are works which at ﬁrst glance look to be
simply canvases painted black, but on closer inspection turn out to be composed of
areas in variable shades of black. Being so nearly devoid of content, the black
paintings can be said to have no context, no connection to the world around it. For
that reason once they were done, they could be hung almost anywhere, and for that
matter, could be placed in almost any orientation since they lack a discernible top
and bottom.
One might nevertheless argue that contemporary art of the sort embodied by the
black paintings do in fact have a context, or at least an intermediate one, and that is
the white cube of the contemporary art gallery. For as was most likely the case,
this piece was being made on speculation by Reinhardt for sale to an unknown
buyer. Once completed, it would have been consigned to his dealer who would
have put it on view in his or her gallery. A collector would eventually have bought
it at something near the asking price after negotiation and then installed it in his or
her private residence or place of business. Over time, the piece would likely have
been resold and moved multiple times. If the artist achieved increasing recognition
for his work, as this one was, the price of the artwork would have risen over time
as it was re-sold, in part because supply would inevitably be limited by the ﬁnite
output an artist could achieve in a lifetime.
At no point in its history would anyone have thought to alter this work of art.
Not only would that have been considered amoral and a violation of a silent pact
entered into with the artist, but anyone doing so would have been ﬁnancially
foolhardy, since it would have eliminated almost any chance of the work retaining
its monetary value. That monetary value, incidentally, would have been entirely
subject to the whims and judgment of the market, there being no factual or tangible
basis for calculating its worth.
Returning to the photograph once more, it cannot have escaped notice that the
artist is creating the work of art by hand, with a paint brush, much as his forebears
did in the Renaissance, antiquity and perhaps even in the caves of Lascaux
40,000 years ago. At least within the framework of physical production, this very
modern artist is creating a hand-crafted custom work of art using manual tech-
niques that have typiﬁed artistic production for centuries and even millennia. So
while conceptually much of contemporary art speaks of an entirely modern and
unprecedented set of ideas about the world, from a production standpoint, most

contemporary artists remain ﬁrmly grounded in the historical spectrum, as can be
shown from even the most cursory review of the current art market.
Contemporary art, then, is a curious mix of both entirely modern paradigms of
the artist as a singular ﬁgure creating unique pieces that are delivered to the market
in a fully completed state, devoid of context, and which are to remain unaltered in
perpetuity, and an historical production model which is largely manual in nature
and which derives value in part from the scarcity that ineluctably derives from its
origins in the individual artist.
For these reasons, it appears that ﬁne art would be ripe for the kind of disruption
brought on by the advent of computerization that has transformed so many other
ﬁelds of human activity. Moreover, mass customization, insofar as it involves the
production of tangible goods by means of a visual interface, and since oftentimes
those goods require creative input on the part of the user to be realized, would
appear to be a particularly suitable mechanism for effecting change in the ﬁne art
market.
What would a recast artistic paradigm look like if mass customization were
brought to bear on the production of art? To begin to answer this question, one
might compare and contrast the salient characteristics of the artistic paradigm as it
was dissected in the Reinhardt image with how such characteristics might be
transformed in a post-industrial, digitally driven era.
For example, consider that most fundamental precept of the contemporary
artist, namely, that the artist is a lone ﬁgure who creates ﬁnished work without
direct input from others. In a mass customization environment, the artist neither
operates alone and nor produces completed work; rather, he or she is joined by a
co-creator, a collaborator who will take up where the artist leaves off to ﬁnalize the
work. This constitutes a fundamental sea change in how to think about the artist’s
relationship to the work of art. No longer does the artist possess a proprietary,
exclusive, and top-down right to ownership of the work of art; in a mass cus-
tomization framework, art is a joint venture involving multiple parties, each
playing a role in the creative process. To be sure, the artist remains critical in his or
her initial conception of the idea behind the work of art, but rather than executing
the work from start to ﬁnish, the artist sets up a system or platform that others can
use to generate their own iterations, which can then be shared across communities.
Meanwhile, the collector of old is transformed from a passive observer and con-
sumer of art to an active participant in its realization. The consequence of this
approach is to democratize art, to make it more consistent with the horizontal,
crowd sourcing, and open innovation practices of the twenty-ﬁrst century than the
vertically stratiﬁed social paradigms of the past.
Another change involves the means of production. No more does the artist toil
in an artisanal culture of hand-crafted objects, in its place comes post-industrial
manufacturing. Rather than wield a brush, the artist writes code to translate his or
her vision of the artwork to be into transmittable form. Rather than being the direct
output of the artist’s hand, the work of art is fabricated by robotically controlled
machinery following the commands of digitally transmitted computer ﬁles. Rather
508
D. M. Rattner

than making art only during the artist’s waking hours and in his or her studio, now,
art can be made anytime and almost anywhere.
There are a number of advantages in changing the means of production to a
mass-customized model. For one, the scarcity principle which is so fundamental to
valuing traditional art is replaced by the abundance principle. The scarcity prin-
ciple follows classic laws of supply and demand in positing that prices will rise
when a product’s supply is constrained, all other things being equal. In the case of
traditionally produced art, an artist’s supply of work is naturally limited by how
much he or she can produce in a ﬁnite lifetime. For increasingly successful artists,
that invariably means that prices become inﬂated as demand increases, which
means that fewer and fewer people can afford them. And once the artist passes
away, a permanently limited supply puts even further pressure on price afford-
ability, provided the artist’s reputation remains intact. The same holds true when
considering the individual work of art, at least those manually produced in non-
replicable media. Being singular and unique, the value of each piece is potentially
unlimited since it is irreplaceable.
Mass-customized art, on the other hand, has no built-in limitations on supply
and therefore is less susceptible to diminished affordability as a result of increased
demand. Nor do prices spike when the artist passes away and supply is cut off,
since the ﬁles live on indeﬁnitely. The paradox of popularity evident in the tra-
ditional gallery model gives way to perpetual democratic accessibility.
A similar change takes place with regard to price structure. In the traditional
gallery model, pricing is speculative and negotiable, which is to say, the price of a
work of art is whatever someone is willing to pay for it at any given moment. It is
almost entirely based on market perception, since there is no direct correlation
between the time and materials initially required to produce the piece and it is
agreed on selling price. And of course, because it is based on intangibles, no one
really knows whether the price will go up or down in the future.
Mass-customized art, by contrast, works on a computed pricing model, meaning
that the cost of fabricating the piece can be calculated objectively. Proﬁt and
overhead as a percentage of costs can be added on top of the cost of goods, making
the price a potentially transparent and objective ﬁgure. Being industrially pro-
duced, it is not subject to price negotiation or wide market swings. And that is a
good thing, because the art market is generally one of the least rational places to
invest one’s money, not only because traditional art is so subjectively speculative,
but also because the entire gallery system is extremely non-transparent and
unequal in its distribution of information. In some cases, asking prices are not even
published, and rarely is the actual purchase price of ﬁrst-time sales divulged. With
mass-customized art, the price is up front and the same for all.
The clandestine nature of the contemporary gallery system is not accidental, of
course. Part of the mystique that clouds its inner workings is devised intentionally
in order to preserve what has been called the ‘‘aura’’ of the work of art. This aura
helps to elevate the perceived value of the artwork by distinguishing it from the
everyday, commonplace character of other types of tangible goods.
The Impact of Mass Customization on the Artist’s Paradigm
509

Compared to traditional ﬁne art, mass-customized art is unabashedly quotidian,
commonplace even. Born in the post-industrial factory and inﬁnitely replicable, it
can have no pretensions to sacredness or cultural apotheosis. It can almost never be
worth more or less than what it starts off being worth. Hence, a work of mass-
customized art needs only be insured for its material replacement value, since that
would be the cost to restore it to original condition if lost or damaged.
None of these remarks are intended to give the impression that the contem-
porary art market is a nefarious operation and that mass customization is a white
knight that will cure its alleged shortcomings. Nor should it be overlooked that
others have offered their own proposals for modifying the artist’s paradigm over
the years. For example, in 1959, a Swiss artist named Daniel Spoerri founded a
groundbreaking publishing entity known as Edition MAT, or Multiplication d’Art
Transformable [3]. This now somewhat forgotten group promoted the art multiple
as a solution to the problems of affordability and exclusionary pricing associated
with unique works of art. It also advanced two other characteristics that have some
connection to this discussion. One was that works of art need not be static and
immobile, as they traditionally were, but could incorporate movement and muta-
bility. The second was that contemporary art could be participatory, interactive,
and open-ended, rather than something to be delivered ﬁnished by the artist to the
collector or observer, never to be altered again for fear of compromising value.
Yaakov Agam’s transformable painting and sculpture series is a case in point
[4]. In these works dating from the 1950s on, some of which were issued by
Edition MAT, the artist invites the viewer to not merely view the work of art
passively, but to physically engage with it by re-positioning two- and three-
dimensional pieces devised by the artist within a frame or assembly. Agam’s work
thus presages a key characteristic of mass customization as it pertains to the
production of objects, namely, that of interactive customer co-creation. Substitute
the artist for the company offering mass-customized art, and the viewer or co-artist
for the customer, and Agam’s transformable works lay a pathway to mass-cus-
tomized art in the twenty-ﬁrst century. Where they differ is largely in the means of
production. Agam’s works were almost entirely hand-made; today, mass-cus-
tomized art is by deﬁnition fabricated by computer controlled machinery, absent of
the human hand, at least in its initial stage.
The computer plays a critical role in the interaction between the co-creator and
the mass-customized work of art (Fig. 2). Thanks to the use of a conﬁgurator, the
co-creator can participate in devising both the form and content of the mass-
customized work of art. The e-commerce venture Juicy Canvas, to take one
example, offers the buyer a series of graphic templates with which to begin the
customization process [5]. A buyer can then rotate, re-size, re-orient, colorize, and
add text on the canvas before proceeding to checkout.
While Juicy Canvas’ attempt to offer customizable art is commendable, it
nonetheless fails to realize the full potential of mass customization, starting as it
does with the kind of conventional illustration art that would normally be framed
and hung as is. Little about these templates suggests that they were initially
conceived with the intent of being subsequently manipulated by a co-creator

within the framework of a conﬁgurator. Somewhat more promising is work
coming out of Ixxi, an Amsterdam-based company [6]. Ixxi’s product is a modular
system of interconnected printed cards hung on a wall in a regular grid. The
images printed on the cards can be uploaded by the user and can either be printed
one to a card or the entire grid can represent a single image. Ixxi also offers a
collection of pre-designed cards in both formats. Grids range in size and are
rectangular or square in overall proportions, each card being a square.
The cards are delivered stacked in a box and with all the necessary connecting
pieces and hanging supplies. The buyer can then choose how to actually arrange
the cards before mounting the assembly on a wall.
Ixxi is especially germane to the discussion of mass-customizable art because it
is modular. Modularity, as is often noted, goes hand in glove with mass custom-
ization from both a production and conceptual standpoint. By its very nature, a
product designed in a modular framework lends itself to being creatively manip-
ulated by the addition, subtraction, or reconﬁguration of its component modules. In
the case of Ixxi, individual cards can be conﬁgured within the grid any way the
user chooses to form different patterns or assume different overall shapes. A user

can also add or take away modules to suit their needs or preferences, or perhaps
external exigencies, such as in the case where the piece has to be moved.
Historically, the idea and practice of modular art is not new. In the 1950s, artists
such as Norman Carlberg and Erwin Hauer were known as modular constructivists
for their work combining repetitive elements of an architectural character [7]. But
it was in the 1960s that modular art really began to coalesce in a coherent body of
work. Perhaps, best known then and later was Sol LeWitt, a proliﬁc inventor of
abstract art based on repetitive units (Fig. 3).
LeWitt is a central ﬁgure in a discussion of mass-customized art in several
respects. First, he embodies the idea that modular art originates in industrialism.
That is to say that the concept of a standardized unit infers industrial production,
rather than artisanal craft, because in order to be truly standardized to ensure exact
ﬁt with adjacent units, the unit must be made exactly the same each time. It is the
factory, not the workshop, that can ensure this level of precision. LeWitt, as is well
known, often did not actually execute his own work, but provided written or
graphic instructions for others to do so, thus distancing himself personally from the
physical work of art, in contrast to the direct connection of the artist and his work
that was represented in the image of Ad Reinhardt discussed earlier. Technically, a
LeWitt piece could be executed any time, anywhere and by any one, making it
conceptually at least an industrially fabricated product. Mass-customized products
are by deﬁnition industrially made, and with the advent of digitized production,
even more precise than was possible in the ﬁrst Industrial Revolution and therefore
a consummation of the industrial ideal. Modular art and mass customization are,
once again, simply natural bedfellows.

Menard via Flickr, http://www.ﬂickr.com)
512
D. M. Rattner

Another notable quality of LeWitt is his proclivity for placing his work in
architectural contexts. Many of his pieces were conceived for speciﬁc interior
environments, and in some cases, he executed semi-architectural three-dimen-
sional structures evocative of building forms. Unlike the kind of non-contextual
work, we saw being produced in the Reinhardt image, LeWitt’s pieces often
connected to their surroundings in very direct ways. This underscores still another
shift in the artist’s paradigm in the age of mass customization, namely, that mass-
customized art and modular mass-customized art in particular are potentially site-
speciﬁc, able to be designed and fabricated to harmonize with their actual sur-
roundings. Moreover, in the case of modular art, a piece can be disassembled and
re-conﬁgured, expanded, or diminished to suit a new location if it is ever moved, a
degree of ﬂexibility that the immutable canvas by Reinhardt never had nor aspired
to.
Still, in certain respects, LeWitt shares Reinhardt’s allegiance to the traditional
artist’s paradigm. Like Reinhardt’s canvas, his works are also considered invio-
lable, precious objects whose price ﬂuctuates according to the market. Any
physical alteration inﬂicted on them would be regarded as a compromise of their
artistic integrity and their potential market value. At the end of the day, LeWitt’s
embrace of modularity is therefore more thematic than actual.
In contrast to LeWitt, mass-customized modular art is post-industrially manu-
factured, affordable, user friendly, generative and needs only the input of a co-
creator to be realized. It is composed of repetitive and standardized units that,
paradoxically, can form unique compositions, making them a kind of distant rel-
ative to the hand-crafted creations produced by traditional artists. No longer a
solitary heroic ﬁgure and the sole author of the work, the artist’s persona is now
that of a collaborator and an instigator.
To date, only a handful of contemporary artists and designers have begun to
investigate this line of inquiry. Among them is the Swedish designer Mia Cullin
[8], who has created a series of modular tapestries out of wool felt as well as from
industrial materials (Fig. 4). Clearly inspired by Cullin, the New York ﬁrm Studio
for A.R.T. and Architecture, which is headed by the author, developed its own line
of modular felt tapestries [9]. Produced on-demand, available in several different
shapes and in an array of colors, the modules are made of wool felt laser cut from
ﬁles uploaded over the Internet and then shipped to the customer in sheets. Cus-
tomers piece the modules together to form the tapestry, which can be composed in
form and color to suit its surroundings.
Studio has also explored modular mass-customized art using more solid
materials, such as MDF veneers and acrylic. Their sculptural wall assemblies
combine both materials, as well as felt, in a series of variously shaped modular
systems that join together by connecting cross-pieces (Fig. 5). Here, one observes
modularity’s capacity for conﬁguring site-speciﬁc art; note how the piece ﬁts
around the various openings and steps down with the ceiling to nestle comfortably
and deliberately into its environment, unlike a traditional rectangular or ﬁxed piece
that would have been superimposed on the backdrop with little inﬂection toward
its surroundings.

As these early efforts attest, the application of mass customization practices to
the production and sale of ﬁne art is at an incipient stage. Signiﬁcant opportunities
lie ahead for artists, designers, and entrepreneurs wanting to further explore the
new artistic paradigm of mass customization.

The Impact of the Arrangement of User
Interface Elements on Customer
Satisfaction in the Conﬁguration Process
Paul Blazek and Klaus Pilsl
Abstract Conﬁguration systems are important drivers for the concept of mass
customization. One of the main challenges when conceptualizing, designing, and
implementing such a conﬁguration system is the creation of an appropriate user
interface. The recent literature covers a lot of different ﬁndings, which criteria a
B2C product conﬁgurator should fulﬁll to offer the customer an optimal custom-
ization process. A case study by Streichsbier et al. (The Inﬂuence of De-Facto
Standards on Users dealing with B2C Conﬁguration Systems, Taipei 2010)
identiﬁed de-facto standards according to the position and availability of certain
Web elements within the user interface of conﬁgurators of the automobile, apparel,
and electronic industries. As the identiﬁed standards vary within the industries, for
the following study only the apparel industry, strictly speaking T-shirt conﬁgu-
rators are considered. The empirical aim of the present study, based on user
observation, is to ﬁnd out whether or not the structure of a conﬁgurator’s user
interface has an inﬂuence on the customers’ process satisfaction.

1 Introduction
A well-designed, usable interface is considered as an essential criterion for the
success of interactive solutions [1]. Meanwhile, a lot of literature addresses the
importance of user interfaces and formulates guidelines for the preparation of such
systems [2]. The main goal of a conﬁgurator is to enable the user to create the

desired product [3]. Therefore, a conﬁguration system should be as user-friendly as
possible to guarantee a proper human computer relationship [4].
Over the years, diverse guidelines and conventions of user interface design
were developed. Consequentially, users build up habits and expectations toward a
Web-based user interface [5]. It has already been empirically proved that users
have expectations concerning the location of relevant Web elements of e-com-
merce shops like the login button, the shopping cart or the help button [6].
A case study by Streichsbier et al. [7] detects such standards within the auto-
mobile, apparel, and electronic industry. Nevertheless, they suggest proving if the
identiﬁed standards accompany with user experiences and expectations [7]. A
market study published by the European Commission [8] points out that mass
customization in the fashion industry is of growing importance: ‘‘Customized
clothes has become a niche market and is expected to be worth EUR 27.2 billion
by 2020, corresponding to 5 % of the global clothing industry.’’ Therefore, the aim
of the conducted study was to ﬁgure out whether or not structural standards of
conﬁgurators in the apparel industry have any inﬂuence on the customer’s process
satisfaction. By using the technology of Combeenation [9], four T-shirt conﬁgu-
rators have been created and compared by conducting a user observation.
2 The Role of User Interface Design for Web-Based
Product Conﬁgurators
2.1 The Need for a Usable Conﬁguration System
One of the fundamental capabilities of the mass customization approach is to
establish the right interaction environment for customers, so they can create
products according to their needs, namely choice navigation. It is crucial for any
conﬁgurator to support the customers in identifying their needs and at the same
time to minimize complexity for the user [10]. So the user interface of Web-based
conﬁgurators is a key success criterion for the customer’s satisfaction, as the
conﬁgurator is the only and most important touching point between the customer
and the manufacturer [11]. Dockenfuß [12] emphasizes the importance of a well-
designed conﬁgurator with the statement ‘‘a user who creates his own products
expects a graphic design that is easy to interpret and use, and employs a familiar
terminology.’’
Rogoll and Piller [13] deﬁned three criteria from the user’s point of view, which
a conﬁguration system should fulﬁll: (a) Risk reduction and trust building: A
conﬁguration system should build up a user’s conﬁdence and show competence.
(b) Usability: Operability and self-explanation, orientation, individual access on
information, loading time, and support. (c) Visualization: As customers do not
have any chance to judge the real, physical product, it is essential to provide the
518
P. Blazek and K. Pilsl

customer a real feeling of the product. Another meaningful attribute is the fun
factor a conﬁguration system should deliver, as it leads to higher customer satis-
faction and willingness to pay [14].
2.2 Deﬁnition and Advantages of User Interface Standards
According to Nielsen and Loranger [15], the existence of de-facto standards is
given, if a Web element is designed in the same way on 80 % and more Web sites.
Users expect these elements to function in the same way. Arguments against and
for the usage of Web standards can be found in many research publications.
Nielsen and Loranger [15] express the potential of standards quite radical ‘‘the
more you stay departed from using standards the more likely appears the danger
that you confuse or even lose your customers.’’ Since standards provide a secure
feeling by having a Web site under control, they increase customer satisfaction
[15]. Adkisson [16] deﬁnes reduced development costs and high usability as core
arguments for standards.
Advantages for the users are higher usability, less training, acceptance of the
system and higher satisfaction, whereas saving time and work, simplifying quality
control, reducing training time are declared as advantages for developers of such
systems [17].
Contrariwise, it is indicated that Web standards may cause that companies lack
in individuality and are not able to create their own solutions [16]. Furthermore, it
is criticized that Web conventions and Web standards are not up to date, which is
why practice-orientated research is getting more important [18].
2.3 Structural Standards for Web-Based B2C Product
Conﬁgurations
According to several studies, Bernard [6] justiﬁes the relevance of right located
Web elements within an online shop. 2001 Bernard has observed 302 subjects
concerning their expectation of the position of well-known Web elements in e-
commerce Web sites. The results conﬁrm that customers have developed certain
prospects in terms of the structure of e-commerce sites [6]. In 2006, Shaikh et al.
[19] have conducted a similar analysis to ﬁnd out whether the expectations of users
have changed, caused by new technological evolution, and increased Internet
usage since 2001. The results of Shaikh and Lenz’s study corroborate Bernard’s
ﬁndings from 2001.
Referring to Bernard’s [6] results, Streichsbier et al. [7] have identiﬁed certain
standards and guidelines in the automobile, electronic and apparel industries
regarding to the placement of Web-objects within the user interface such as but-
tons, toolboxes, and text ﬁelds. As within the apparel industry products vary a lot,
the sample has been subdivided into conﬁgurators for T-shirts and shirts.

519

A total number of 30 T-shirt conﬁgurators have been observed. In the fol-
lowing, the identiﬁed standards for T-shirt conﬁgurators are listed [7]:
• 100 % of the observed conﬁgurators use real product images.
• 90 % support customers with a visual feedback showing choices and alterations
made and 83 % represent several perspectives and viewing points of the product
image.
• The average product image size is 315 9 337 px.
• 80 % show and update the price during the conﬁguration process.
• 77 % of the conﬁguration takes place on a single screen and do not lead the user
through a conﬁguration process.Structure of T-shirts Conﬁgurators. Figure 1
depicts the statistical likeliness of the position of relevant elements in a struc-
tural frame of T-shirt conﬁgurators.
3 Empirical Analysis
3.1 Research Aims
Rogoll and Piller [13] stress the need of testing user requirements when designing
conﬁgurators. Streichsbier et al. [7] also recommend checking the identiﬁed
standards, described in 2.3, on the basis of user testing. The analysis aims on
ﬁguring out whether or not standards concerning the structure of a conﬁgurator as
the position of Web elements (e.g., toolbox, product image, and process navigation
bar) have any inﬂuence on the user’s process satisfaction. To exclude confounding
factors like different designs or different design options, this study was conducted
with the same conﬁgurator in different variations so that only the structure varies
but not the tool or the design options itself.

3.2 Method and Setting
The empirical focus is put on a special kind of user observation. For the following
qualitative analysis, 6 users have been observed while dealing with four T-shirt
conﬁgurators. All subjects chosen for the usability test are familiar with online
shops and have already purchased products online. According to Nielsen [20], the
amount of 5 users for usability testing is sufﬁcient as 5 users can detect already
85 % of the usability problems within the ﬁrst testing round.
The method used for the study is a ‘‘thinking aloud’’ approach. During testing,
the users are asked to speak out loud all thoughts that come to their mind while
using the conﬁgurator. The observer can understand the user’s interaction with the
conﬁgurator as intentions become visible. In that way, a holistic emotional and
rational behavioral pattern of the user while operating the conﬁgurator is to be
researched. Problems of the interface can easily be discovered because the
observer can see the difference between what the user is thinking and actually
doing [21].
All subjects have been asked to fulﬁll the following task with all four T-shirt
conﬁgurators: ‘‘Create a polo T-shirt in size medium with an image of an ice and
your name on it.’’
To avoid any interference concerning process satisfaction and duration, the
conﬁgurators have been presented in a different order. During the observation, the
listed aspects have been considered:
• Handling: Is the structure of the conﬁgurator clear and easy to use?
• Orientation: Is the user able to ﬁnd everything necessary in order to complete
the task?
• Duration: How long does the user need to fulﬁll the task with each
conﬁgurator?
• Ranking: Which of the conﬁgurators is considered to be the easiest to use?
Which conﬁgurator is preferred in terms of joy in handling?
Deﬁned Structure of the Conﬁgurators Used in the Experiment. To guar-
antee reliable testing objects, in cooperation with the initiators of the Conﬁgurator
Database [22], four user interface structures of T-shirt conﬁgurators have been
compiled. The identiﬁed structures represent used user interface structures of
existing conﬁgurators in the fashion industry:
Technical Implementation of the Conﬁgurators. The conﬁgurators have been
implemented by using the technology of Combeenation [9]. Probst et al. [8]
describes Combeenation as an innovative solution for manufacturers of custom-
izable products allowing them to sell their commodities online without initial
costs. This software as a service enables clients to develop an all-in-one Web shop
for their products. The conﬁgurators build by the clients can be modiﬁed and
integrated into their own corporate Web site (Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 5).

3.3 Results and Key Findings
All 6 users have been able to create the deﬁned T-shirts with all of the given
conﬁgurators. The following ﬁndings can be clustered in ‘‘process navigation’’
(i.e., steps, buttons, accordion and general usability), ‘‘structure’’ (i.e., arrangement
of the toolboxes, presentation of product and options and functionality) as well as
in ‘‘overall ranking’’ and the investigation of the ‘‘duration’’ needed to ﬁnish the
given task.
Process Navigation. Regarding process navigation, user interface 1 has been
preferred the most. The subjects like the handling and the ease of use. In particular,
the horizontal steps, which are labeled, are perceived as helpful during the

conﬁguration process. Switching back and forth in the process is easy, but it is
annoying for all subjects to run through all steps again when one option (e.g.,
model) has to be changed subsequently. Also user interface 3 has been appreciated
by the subjects as all conﬁguration options are shown on one screen. There is no
predeﬁned way of conﬁguring and thus leads to a very good usability in the
subject’s opinions. The user interface of conﬁgurator 3 is simple and very practical
and offers the best functionality, compared to the other interfaces. More points of
criticism have emerged at user interfaces 2 and 4. The subjects generally like the
ﬂexible process navigation of user interface 2. However, the toolbox as accordion,
which opens and closes automatically, is not useable as it is annoying that the
options disappear once another choicebox is opened. User interface 4 is not self-
explaining. It is not clear which steps exist as they are not labeled. The separation
in 4 steps is disturbing and should be replaced with labeled and clickable steps.
The subjects dislike that the process navigation is only possible via next and back
button. Subsequent changes are laboriously, because it is necessary to go back step
by step.
Structure. In general, the subjects set great value upon a good overview and a
big presentation of the product itself as well as the options. The toolboxes are
preferred on the right side of the conﬁgurator, as in user interfaces 1 and 3. User
interface 1 provides a very good overview as there is enough space for the tool-
boxes. The options and the product itself are shown big enough and the product is
always in the center of the conﬁgurator. The necessary toolboxes are always
opened and are well positioned. User interface 3 is also perceived very user-
friendly as all toolboxes are opened. This interface provides a good overview of all
options, and it is very clear and transparent. The roundly arrangement of the
toolboxes (right and bottom) is not optimal as the interface looks ﬁlled up with
tools and thus a little narrow.
The structure of user interface 2 is also judged quite good, because the product
is always in the center of the conﬁgurator and all toolboxes are placed together on
one side. Nevertheless, the interface looks narrow and the images of the different
models are too small and not recognizable at a glance. User interface 4 totally
lacks of overview. The models are very small and hardly recognizable.
Overall Ranking. All subjects have been asked to give an overall ranking of all
four tested conﬁgurators concerning the satisfaction with process navigation and
structure. The average ranking position is, with consideration of certain premises,
as shown in Table 1. To sum it up, user interface 1 has been preferred most,
because the subjects like the joyful guidance through the conﬁguration process and
the big product images.
Duration of Fulﬁlling the Given Task. During the user testing, the time
needed to ﬁnish the given task has been tracked. The subjects have shown learning
effects, as the duration of the conﬁguration got generally shorter, no matter what
conﬁgurator has been presented ﬁrst as shown in Fig. 6. Figure 7 depicts that the
duration difference between the user interfaces is marginal.

4 Conclusion and Outlook
The results show that the structure of user interfaces, considered in isolation, has
an emotional impact on the satisfaction with the conﬁguration process. It is indeed
possible for the subjects to achieve the desired result with all user interfaces.
However, clear preferences concerning the structure have emerged. Moreover, the
testing detects that the structural standards Streichsbier et al. [7] gathered, which
are represented in user interface 3, are not preferred by the subjects, but it is
nevertheless voted on rank 2. These ﬁndings can of course not be generalized for
all customizable products, as there is a high variety of product types, forms of
customization, etc. However, there can be applicability for products of the fashion
industry as well as products with a similar degree of complexity.
By a further gradual user testing, an optimization of the conﬁgurators could be
certainly achieved. Combeenation [9] is seen as a suitable tool for this purpose, as
the user interface can be adapted easily and quickly regardless of the underlying
product data, which can certainly vary depending on the industry and product
complexity. As the user testing is only a ﬁrst insight into the importance of the
structure of user interfaces for conﬁgurators, an adaptation of the conﬁgurators
concerning the evaluated results and a further testing would be desirable. In a next
step, it would be interesting to add the design components and make a user testing
not only with the structure. Another exciting ﬁeld of investigation would be the
testing of the structure in terms of usability and ease of use on mobile devices such
as iPads and smartphones.

Abstract Developing product conﬁguration system (CS) requires extracting and
representing domain expert knowledge in appropriate product models. As
acknowledged by researchers, this is often one of the most challenging activities in
conﬁguration projects, where only little empirical insights have yet been reported.
This article investigates the challenge on how industrial companies model their
product CSs. The study is based on interviews of 18 industrial companies using
CSs for conﬁguring customer-tailored products. It investigates the relationship
between using a structured modelling technique for modelling product families
relative to less or no formal approaches. Furthermore, the study explores the
speciﬁc characteristics of conﬁguration set-ups with respect to size and complexity
and their effect on product variant management and availability of product
knowledge in organizations. The results empirically validate the need for a sug-
gested systematic modelling approach for large and complex conﬁguration pro-
jects and its positive effect on the overall performance of companies.

1 Introduction
With product conﬁguration systems (CSs), companies can obtain the growing
product variety caused by today’s global market competition in an efﬁcient way
[1, 2]. They represent one of the most successful applications of artiﬁcial intel-
ligence principles [3–5]. A product CS is a software-based expert system that
supports the users in the speciﬁcation of customized products [6]. The system
provides design choices for the user, while restricting the offered solution space to
feasible combination of choices. Having a predeﬁned knowledge base, CSs enable
automating repetitive product speciﬁcation tasks, for which human experts where
previously needed. Their implementation has resulted in a number of operational
beneﬁts: such as reduced lead times, better quality of speciﬁcations, improved
on-time delivery and less training for new employees [7–9]. In many cases,
product CSs have been used to create quote prices, sales prices, bill of materials,
and other product speciﬁcations. They incorporate knowledge-integrated or
intelligent models of the product portfolio. Based on these models, new speciﬁ-
cations for product instances and their life cycle properties can be derived. The
development of CSs requires that domain expert knowledge is extracted and
represented in corresponding product models to be incorporated in a CS. As
acknowledged by researchers, this is often one of the most challenging activities
in conﬁguration projects [1, 4, 10]. However, only little empirical studies inves-
tigate the character of the modelling methods applied in industry and their use-
fulness with regard to nature of the conﬁguration project. Instead, academia
typically focusses on proposing various modelling methods based on conceptual
examples or single case studies, e.g. [11–14]. To better understand this relation,
this article evaluates the experiences from applying a structured approach for
modelling product variants for product CS in relation to less formal methods. The
implementation of a comparison framework for such a systematic approach is
examined relative to less formal modelling techniques, e.g. structured bills of
materials, or to no speciﬁc methods at all. The qualities of the suggested mod-
elling procedure are yet not compared to other related modelling techniques.
2 Literature Review
2.1 From Real World to an IT-System
The development of a computer model can be expressed in several phases. Figure 1
shows the so-called phenomenon model and the information model as means for
modelling real world objects for an IT-system. In the context of product CSs, such a
transformation represents modelling product variants for a product CS. Based on the
actual product family and its variants offered on the market, a phenomenon model is
530
L. Hvam et al.

developed and further formalized into an information model—an object-oriented
model, which facilitates the transformation into an IT-system. Finally, the infor-
mation model is implemented into a computer model, for which the same features
and constraints are used, changed and updated across the phenomenon model, the
information model and the computer model [15].
The challenge of modelling product knowledge has been discussed by several
authors and alternative representation techniques have been suggested [1]. In the
majority of cases, the proposed methods make use of the uniﬁed modelling lan-
guage (UML) standard for the representation of the product knowledge and in
particular of the information model [8]. Aldanondo et al. [11] for example intro-
duce a combination of class diagrams, constraints expressed with natural language,
as well as a number of inter- and intra-domain matrixes depicting the relationship
between product components, operations or attributes. Chao and Chen [12] pro-
pose the use of a ‘‘general design’’ model, which expresses the relationship
between components and assesses their ability for a physical assembly before
production. Even though not discussed by the authors, the model makes partly use
of the UML standard, e.g. to describe decomposition or cardinality. Also Magro
and Torasso [16] investigate the possibility of providing a sufﬁcient model for the
representation of the product knowledge. The authors suggest a frames parts
components (FPC) model, as a means of describing the relevant product knowl-
edge. The mentioned technique can be seen as a modiﬁed UML model with a
reduced syntax for the expression of, e.g. aggregation and generalization struc-
tures. Through its simpliﬁcation, the authors argue for its visual support of
sequential conﬁguration algorithm examples. However, it remains unclear why the
given and more comprehensive UML standard would not be at least just as suitable
for the discussed conﬁguration problems. Alternative methods have, e.g. proposed
the use of feature or functional hierarchy trees [13, 17]. Based on such an initial
meta-modelling of product functions, a more detailed conﬁguration model is then
acquired with class diagrams using the UML standard.
2.2 The Centre for Product Modelling Procedure
A more comprehensive approach has been taken by Hvam et al. [1]. The authors
suggest a set of modelling techniques for modelling product families for product
conﬁguration [1]. The so-called Centre for Product Modelling (CPM) approach
Fig. 1 From real world to an IT-system (adapted from [15])
The Use of Modelling Methods for Product Conﬁguration in Industrial Applications
531

focuses on the phenomenon model and its transformation into an information
model. The CPM procedure includes the use of a generic product variant model,
the so-called product variant master (PVM) and class responsibility collaboration
(CRC) cards for modelling product families. Here, a product model can be deﬁned
as a model that describes a product’s structure, function and other product’s life
cycle properties, e.g. manufacturing, assembly, transportation and service [18, 19].
As it includes a deﬁnition of the rules for generating variants in the product
assortment, it is used as a basis for a product CSs [1, 20]. However, experiences
from a considerable number of industrial companies have shown that often these
product CSs are constructed without the use of a strict modelling technique. As a
result, many of the systems are unstructured and undocumented and therefore
difﬁcult or impossible to maintain or develop further [1].
In order to cope with these challenges, according to theory, the introduced
method makes it possible to document the product CSs in a structured way.
Furthermore, the modelling techniques enable to involve domain experts from, e.g.
sales, product development and production in the modelling process. This
improves the ability to make the right decisions on which products and features to
include in the CS. Consequently, a stronger commitment behind the product
knowledge implemented in the CS can be achieved.
The main principles of the PVM technique can be seen in Fig. 2. The left-hand
side of the model contains the generic part of structure, also known as the
aggregation structure from object-oriented modelling. The generalization which
describes how a product part can appear in several variants, the so-called kind-of
structure, is listed on the right-hand side of the model. In the PVM, a description is
also given of the most important connections between modules/parts, i.e. rules for
which modules/parts are permitted to be combined. This is done by drawing a line
between the two modules/parts and writing the rules which apply for combining
the modules/parts concerned. In a similar manner, the life cycle systems to be
modelled are described in terms of masters that for example describe the pro-
duction system or the assembly system. The individual modules/parts in the PVM
are further described in CRC cards, which are used to detail the individual object
classes [1, 19, 21]. They moreover contain information about product responsi-
bility, version control or sketches and can be associated with both the PVM and the
object-oriented analysis (OOA) model. The purpose of the CRC cards is to doc-
ument detailed knowledge about attributes and methods for the individual object
classes and to describe the classes’ mutual relationships. The CRC cards serve as
documentation for both domain experts and system developers, and thus, together
with the PVM and the class diagram, become an important means of communi-
cating and documenting knowledge within the project group. With their creation, a
class diagram as an object-oriented model based on the UML standard can then be
developed. Due to its systematic framework and the relative frequent use, the
hereby described approach is further taken as a comparison model for a generally
structured modelling procedure for CSs.

3 Research Method
To investigate the actual use of modelling techniques in product conﬁguration
projects, an investigation on the use of product CSs in industry companies was
carried out. The study was conducted as semi-structured interviews of employees
with knowledge of the conﬁguration projects. The main reason for using inter-
views instead of a web-based or paper-based questionnaire survey is that the area
in focus is characterized by a much unclear terminology. The chosen approach
allowed for the interviewer to clarify the meaning of questions that are not
understood and to rigorously investigate the nature of the conﬁguration set-up.
This option proved to be particularly helpful because of the different backgrounds
of interviewees and the different industrial settings, deﬁnitions and practices of the
target organizations. Furthermore, the research design made it possible to balance
the breadth and the depth of the case studies by allowing for both qualitative
explanations and quantitative indications.
A total of 26 companies were interviewed for the study, where a sample of 18
companies was selected based on: (1) the interviewed being able to explain the
modelling techniques used and (2) the interviewed being able to state the effects
from using product conﬁguration. All 18 case companies offer business-to-business
products, where in ten of them, several CS are in operation. The evaluation of the
interviews enabled a general classiﬁcation of the 18 companies with regards the
modelling approach in three different categories, with six in each category. Figure 3
illustrates the modelling distribution for each of the categories. All companies
belonging to category A were using the suggested PVM technique, three were using
CRC cards and two companies also used class diagrams. Companies belonging to
category B reported using structured bills of materials as their dominant way for

deﬁning the variants in the product families. Besides, they apply Excel spread
sheets, Word documents and the modelling environment provided in the product
conﬁguration software. The remaining C companies claimed not to use any speciﬁc
modelling techniques outside the conﬁguration tool, except of product tables in
Excel spread sheets and speciﬁcation reports in Word documents. The results of the
conﬁguration set-up in relation to the used modelling approach are discussed in the
following section.
4 Results
4.1 Effects of the Conﬁguration Set-Up on Company Size
and Market
Figure 4 provides background information on the investigated companies and the
size and purpose of their CSs. As indicated in Fig. 4, CSs are used across all three
categories in support of the quotation and production process. More precisely, 17
out of 18 of the companies apply product CSs for quotations. Sixteen of these use
the product CSs both for creating quotations and for the manufacturing speciﬁ-
cations, while only one company uses product CSs solely for creating manufac-
turing speciﬁcations. In most cases, such product CSs were created by using the
same standard conﬁguration software shells. In the context of counting the number
of product CSs, a single product CS is deﬁned as being each running software
application, which has an individual knowledge base.
Companies belonging to category A are typically globally operating ﬁrms, which
are larger in average (84 % bigger than the mean value) and have a high share of
customized products compared to conﬁgured ones. They are mainly offering
industrial systems, plants and machineries, which require a strong engineering

effort. To support the customization of their complex products, they have imple-
mented several CSs (60 % more than the mean value). This helps them to conﬁgure
ca. 30 % of their product range, while remaining part of their portfolio today
involves additional engineering workload.
Compared to A ﬁrms, companies belonging to category B are in average
smaller in size, yet globally operating. They are producing building, agricultural
and mechanical systems and use a limited number of CSs for a large part of their
product range. Next, C companies are considerably smaller in size. They are
typically locally operating ﬁrms working within building and tooling sector, where
ca. half of their products are supported by generally one CS.
4.2 Effects of the Conﬁguration Set-Up and Complexity
on the Modelling Approach
When investigating the detailed set-up of the individual CSs in the case compa-
nies, a major difference can be revealed. Companies in category A use several CSs
for relatively complex products and with a strong integration to other IT systems
(50 % more than the mean value), such as CAD or ERP. In order to handle the
conﬁguration tasks, each of their CSs comprise a large number of attributes and
rules. Due to the increase challenges in modelling their product portfolio for
conﬁguration, all of the A companies were using the suggested CPM modelling
techniques. But as the CSs grew bigger and the number of people involved in the
conﬁguration projects increased, they realized a need for being able to work in a
more structured way and for being in more control of the models implemented in
the product CSs. Here, three of the six companies using the CPM procedure have
Fig. 4 Background information and conﬁguration support

535

reported that they started to model their product CSs without any speciﬁc mod-
elling technique.
As Fig. 5 reveals, companies of category B and C have implemented signiﬁ-
cantly smaller CSs. Their systems are usually integrated to enterprise resource
planning (ERP) or product lifecycle management (PLM) systems, with little
emphasis on external integrations to computer-aided design (CAD) or to advanced
calculation systems. This indicates that with a minor conﬁguration project for
relatively simple products and not involving too many employees, the modelling
can be managed by using less formal modelling tools. As the conﬁguration task
increase in both, size and complexity, the more important becomes a systematic
modelling approach.
4.3 Effects of the Conﬁguration Set-Up on Companies’
Performance
Finally, the impact on the companies’ ability to document and share their product
knowledge, their ability to reduce the number of product variants in the company
and the degree of employee satisfaction among the employees involved in the
product conﬁguration projects was investigated. The respondents have rated the
impact on a ﬁve-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) and
‘‘empty space’’ for no answer to the question. Here, reducing product variants
means the ability to eliminate unnecessary product variants from the product
assortment in the company. The ability to keep down the number of product
variants (item numbers) in the product assortment is claimed to be an important
enabler for reducing complexity and thus keeping down costs in the company
Fig. 5 Effects of product conﬁguration complexity on system integrations
536
L. Hvam et al.

[22, 23]. As listed in Fig. 6, A category companies claim to have a better ability to
reduce the number of product variants than the others. This may be related to an
increased ability to document and get access to product knowledge with the CRM
procedure. Companies not using the CPM procedure report to have less docu-
mentation of, and access to, their product knowledge. However, the differences
between the three groups on documentation and accessibility of product knowledge
are not very signiﬁcant. This could be related to the fact that the companies using
less formal modelling techniques are having relatively minor CSs, which handle
simpler conﬁguration tasks and where the related complexity can still be managed.
Furthermore, employees working on product conﬁguration projects with the
described formal modelling procedure report to be slightly more satisﬁed with their
working situation than those working with no formal modelling techniques. This
may be related to the increased ability to document and get access to product
knowledge, which makes it easier for the employees to control the product knowl-
edge implemented in the CSs and to communicate the product knowledge with
colleagues from other departments, such as product development, sales and
production.
5 Conclusion
The conducted study on the use of product CSs in industrial companies provided
new insight into how CSs are modelled and documented in relation to the nature of
the conﬁguration set-up. The results reveal that out of 18, six companies used
Fig. 6 Effects on work environment, knowledge management, product design and quality

537

the suggested systematic modelling approach, namely the CPM procedure, for
relatively complex products and sophisticated CSs. The remaining 12 companies
used less formal or no formal modelling techniques for less challenging and less
advanced conﬁguration projects. Furthermore, three of the six respondents using
the CPM modelling techniques have claimed that they started to use the more
formal modelling techniques as the number of CSs and thus the conﬁguration
projects grew bigger and involved more and more people. They then claim to be
more in control of their product knowledge and their product variants than the
companies using less formal modelling techniques. This may be partly due to an
increased ability to involve domain experts in the modelling process, which
secures that the right decisions are being made as to which product variants to
include in the CSs. This indicates that in order to major companies to be successful
in the use of product CSs in a setup with several CSs with a high complexity and
numerous employees (often geographically diversiﬁed) involved, a formal mod-
elling technique like the CPM approach is needed. Furthermore, a more formal
modelling technique makes it possible to keep track of the product variants, fea-
tures and rules implemented in the CS. A better communication with the domain
experts reﬂected in the report an increased ability to control the product knowledge
as well as an increased level of satisfaction from the employees working in the
conﬁguration projects. The study revealed an important correlation between the
use of a formal modelling technique (the CPM approach), the size and complexity
of the CSs as well as the ability to control the product knowledge and products
variants. However, having obtained these results, further questions are being raised
as to, e.g. which speciﬁc features of the modelling techniques leads to an increased
control of the product knowledge, or what is the correlation between the use of a
formal modelling technique and the capability to successfully implement a product
CS. Moreover, to better generalize the results, it would be beneﬁcial to expand the
number of industrial cases.

Understanding Complex Construction
Systems Through Modularity
Tor Clarke Jensen, Baris Bekdik and Christian Thuesen
Abstract This paper develops a framework for understanding complexity in
construction projects by combining theories of complexity management and
modularization. The framework incorporates three dimensions of product, process,
and organizational modularity with the case of gypsum wall elements. The analysis
ﬁnds that the main driver of complexity is the fragmentation of the design and
production, which causes the production modules to construct and install new
product types and variants for each project as the designers are swapped for every
project. The many interfaces are characteristics of an integral system, rather than a
modular, although the industry forces modular organizational structures. This
creates a high complexity degree caused by the non-alignment of building parts and
organizations and the frequent swapping of modules.

1 Introduction
The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry differentiates from
other production-based industries by its unique properties. The project-based
production (PBP) nature of the construction industry combined together with size
of the projects causes high complexity. Researchers such as [1] and [2] deﬁne the
projects as hyper-complex, but do not explain where this complexity arises and
evolves. Although sub-products such as gypsum walls are produced according to
mass production principles, the ﬁnal construction product is very much tailored

according to the highly varied PBP requirements. Therefore, the uniqueness of
each construction project involves great challenges in terms of mass customiza-
tion. The ambition of the paper is to explore the construction industry from a
system perspective, as a complex production system. The main idea is to under-
stand the project-based environment of construction through concepts such as
modularity and complexity management, which have been developed as a system
analysis for operation-based businesses, and thereby potentially enables the
application of mass customization principles in construction.
2 Methodology
The research is conducted through an abductive case study combining theories of
complexity and modularization with empirical material from a standard con-
struction practices: gypsum walls. The empirical data were collected through semi-
structured interviews [3] with the various parties such as architect, project director,
and carpenters, which all participate in the design and production gypsum walls. A
detailed analysis of a gypsum wall (sub-product) being assembled (process) by a
carpenter (organizational unit) will be the core point of this paper.
3 Literature Study
The two theories, complexity and modularity, that the research is based on
encompass similar and compatible concepts. They both have a focus on product,
process, and organizational aspects (PPO). In this paper, the two theories are
brought together in the attempt to understand the highly complex production
systems within construction.
3.1 Complexity
Complexity and complex system are not necessarily about large numbers. Appelo
[4] describes how small systems such as a single water molecule are complex,
because its actions are not easily predictable. This is in opposition to causality,
which says that a certain cause will have a speciﬁc effect, which characterizes
linearity, predictability, and determinism. Complex systems are thus nonlinear and
very difﬁcult to predict.
Wilson and Perumal [5] argue that understanding and analyzing complexity is
crucial for developing organizational efﬁciency. In their perspective, products,
processes, and organizations are related and all have their own role of complexity;
however, managing each subject alone will not provide much improvement
compared to a combined approach.

The Product Complexity arises from a variety available to the end customer. It
is a tough balance between having enough variety and too much variety; too little
will send market shares to competitors, while too much will make products can-
nibalize on existing products’ market share [5]. The actual introduction of new
packages, products, or other product-related innovations also increases process
complexity, as this results in increased variety through the whole value chain [6].
Wilson and Perumal [5] subdivide product complexity into external and internal,
where the external is the actual product range. The internal product complexity is
derived from the elements, which are used to create the product such as parts,
speciﬁcations, and instructions.
The Process Complexity arises through the amount and dependencies of
processes within a production chain. The more direct the production chain is, the
less the complexity costs are associated with the product, while rework and work-
around are consequences of too much complexity. Reducing process complexity is
very similar to the lean concept of process waste and non-value-adding processes.
Wilson and Perumal [5] say that process complexity and non-value-adding costs
can be treated as equivalent at a practical level, but technically they are different.
The Organizational Complexity of a company is related to the amount of
organizational units, systems, and assets, which the company involves in per-
forming its processes. The complexity of the organization and the processes are
strongly linked, and the organizational complexity usually arises to cope with the
increased complexity of the processes [5]. Ashkenas [6] describes how incremental
change can increase the organizational complexity, as small tweaks keep adding
complexity and this often goes unrecognized.
Intersection between different types of complexities. Wilson and Perumal [5]
argue strongly that the main reason for complexity to arise is the relations between
the three dimensions of product, process, and organization. These are related
through the complexity cube, which is a three-dimensional diagram with an axis
for each dimension as shown in Fig. 1. The further from the center, the more the
complexity, and this means that the complexity is multiplied rather than added
for each dimension. As Wilson and Perumal [5] treat complexity costs and non-
value-adding costs equally, this also means that the degree of non-value adding
will increase steadily with the company generating less revenue.
Product/process face—Where complexity arises. The product variety strains
the performance of processes producing the product, and this inﬂuences the
proﬁtability of the product. As the processes are required to deliver the product,
these constitute a substantial part of the product cost. The processes are, however,
not isolated to a single product, but are connected to a series of products, which
accumulates the overall cost of delivering the products.
Process/organizational face—Where complexity hides. As the process is how
a work is delivered, the process/organization face is about how the organization
deploys its resources to execute these processes. This face is the least tangible, as
processes are dispersed between organizational functions, which may be divided
into silos, and the holistic view of the processes is thus lost. The amount of resources
required for a given process is thus not visible without any in-depth analysis.

543

Organizational/product face—Where complexity takes root. This is where
organizational resources are allocated to the products of an organization. These
resources include physical assets, organizational structures, and supply chain
partners. This face has the largest need of investment and thus holds most assets
such as facilities, technology, and IT systems, but also increased cost with a
fragmented supply chain and rivalry between functional units. The organizational/
product face will always seek to optimize itself according to the given conditions,
so the organization and products become dependent on each other. The roots occur
through a series of iterations, where the product portfolio cannot be reduced
because the assets will be obsolete and the assets cannot be reduced because these
support the product portfolio. The complexity thus becomes trapped and cannot be
controlled unless both the product and organization are considered simultaneously.
3.2 Modularity
According to Campagnolo and Camuffo [7], there exists no single accepted deﬁ-
nition of modularity, but a series of common traits which are generally applied.
The main trait as Simon [8] describes is that systems consist of hierarchies of
modules and interdependence within a module is stronger than the interdepen-
dence between modules. The modules interact with other modules through stan-
dardized interfaces, which also allow a decoupling of modules. Campagnolo and
Camuffo [7] argue that a modular system is in opposition to an integral one, which
provides an axis of analysis, measuring systems according to modular versus
integral structure.
Given the broad acceptances of the concept, Campagnolo and Camuffo [7]
argue that every system is modular to some extent. This gives rise to different ways
of understanding and describing modularity.
In Campagnolo and Camuffo’s [7] review of the concept of modularity, they
identify three streams of literature clustered around three different units of anal-
ysis: (a) product design modularity, (b) production system modularity, and
Fig. 1 The complexity cube.

(c) organizational design modularity (p. 260). Based on Thuesen [9] reinterpre-
tation of the modularity concept, these categories are in the following referred to as
product, process, and organizational modularity.
Baldwin and Clark [10] describe how modularity is a strategy to manage
complex products and processes. Managing modularity deals with hidden and
visible information, where the hidden information covers the interdependency
within the modules. The visible information is concerned with the overall archi-
tecture, interfaces, and standards, which all cover external information for each
individual module. In this relation, architecture is the dominant aspect of modular
systems, as this describes the modularity principles, functions, and interaction. In
order to manage modularity, the architecture has to be apparent and this has to be
in control of the architect [10].
3.3 Complexity and Modularity in Construction
A construction project is unique, while a mass production is repeated. Bertelsen [2]
accepts that projects can be deﬁned as production, but says that in order to
understand the construction projects, a complexity approach also has to be applied.
He deﬁnes construction projects as complex systems which cannot obtain opti-
mality: neither in design nor in production. Projects are thus unpredictable and
nonlinear and cannot be followed through speciﬁc linear phases and with inde-
pendent organizations.
The complexity of construction projects means that traditional learning through
experience does not necessarily increase efﬁciency over time. Traditional con-
struction always incorporates a number of crafts into the construction organization.
Depending on the project and contract type, the client will hire the contractor/
contractors to perform the actual production as well as consultants to perform the
program and design. The contracting organization may be organized in different
conﬁgurations (or architectures), but are generally divided into subcontractors
consisting of individual companies or organizational units according to crafts or
professions. Relations between a client and contractors or main contractor and
subcontractors are usually established through tenders, and the ensuing relation-
ship is upheld through contracts.
The organization is thus modular to the extent that crafts can be interchanged
and the contracts act as standardized interfaces and their also exists a number of
platforms. Standards for organizing projects, such as AB92, exist for the Danish
construction projects, so this matches the deﬁnition of modularity of Baldwin and
Clark [10], but in particular, the architecture is difﬁcult to translate into a project
environment. The modularity combined with complexity together with the
advantages and challenges in the application of construction sub-product will be
analyzed in the following section.

4 Analysis of Gypsum Walls
The detailed analyses of the gypsum wall production as a construction sub-product
are studied in this section. As explained earlier are the empirical data collected
through a series of interviews. Figure 2 illustrates a general overview of the
gypsum wall production including the process and the involved organizations.
Gypsum walls have become the standard choice for partition walls, as it is the
easiest method of establishing partitions between rooms. They also have a low cost
compared to their high acoustic and ﬁre protection rating. In addition, they have a
good constructability as they are very ﬂexible and easy to get into the building. An
example of a gypsum wall is shown in Fig. 3.
4.1 Case Analysis
The gypsum wall application case will in the following be analyzed with a product,
process, and organizational focus.
The product focus. The products or sub-products in question are the gypsum
walls, which are divided into a series of variants/types. The gypsum walls consist
of steel proﬁles with screw-mounted gypsum boards with insulation material in
between. In addition, the walls are plastered and painted and some include tech-
nical installations, mainly electrical installations. The gypsum wall types are
differentiated by the components: three types of steel proﬁles, two types of gypsum
boards, and three types of insulation (more component types may be procured).
The structure also differentiates between single or parallel steel proﬁles, number of
boards, boards on one or two sides, and single or double insulation. The actual sub-
product module is deﬁned as all internal or directly mounted components on the
gypsum wall without other interfaces.
In addition to the actual module, a series of interfaces connect the gypsum wall
to other sub-products. The most direct interface is with the (concrete) slab ele-
ments, as in Fig. 3, which supports the wall at bottom and top. The penetrations of
technical installations are also considered interfaces as well as ceilings, ﬂoors,
glass walls, (concrete) wall elements, and façades. This leads to two kinds of
interfaces: penetrating interfaces and mount interfaces, which could be subdivided
into line and point (for TVs, etc.). Internal electrical installations should also have
an interface to the electrical supply system. The product interfaces are not spec-
iﬁed on components or material, but are established on-site according to the
erected sub-products. The main means of performing the actual interfaces are
through screws, glue, or sealants. Each single wall may have different interfaces,
as these are determined by the different designers.
Although the initial product coming directly from factory is a mass production
product ﬁtting pick-to-order (PTO) scenario, the variety between the gypsum walls
and their established interfaces could mean that all walls are individual and
therefore follow an assemble-to-order (ATO) process.
546
T. C. Jensen et al.

The process focus. The processes are generally derived from the current
product structure and by the crafts traditional work method. The gypsum walls
have a set of production processes described in the supplier manual and design
information. These processes include erecting steel structure, installing insulation,
mounting gypsum boards, installing electrical installations, plastering, painting,
mounting doors, and detailing/ﬁnishing. These processes are delegated to the crafts
according to their traditional domain. The actual production process is thus
dominated by the product, which speciﬁes the processes, while the organizations
are chosen according to speciﬁed processes. Specifying wall type mainly involves
creating information on the speciﬁc requirements for the individual wall and
otherwise following the supplier’s manual for attaining these properties. This

547

would suggest a simple process of speciﬁcation to construction, but as architect
explains how information generated may change through the design phase, this
will have consequences for the production processes. A process module with
similar input and output could be swapped and shared. Knauf Danogips [11]
describes mounting gypsum boards: These can both be ﬁxed with screws or glued
in place. This does not change the previous process (erection of steel proﬁles) or
subsequent process (plastering), but the three processes cannot be swapped.
The processes themselves are not speciﬁcally deﬁned. Both carpenters say that
the individual task can be performed in many different ways. The process of
aligning the steel proﬁles is not described. This would imply that the process
interfaces are standardized across crafts, but not within them.
The architecture of the project and the amount of interfaces may result in the
ﬁnal gypsum wall product to contain the characteristics varying from ATO process
to even engineer-to-order (ETO) process of mass customization scenarios pre-
sented by Hvam [12].
The organizational focus. By following the value chain, the main organiza-
tions who are involved in the construction of the gypsum walls are architect,
carpenter contractor, electrical contractor, painter contractor, and joiner contractor.
Other organizations are more indirectly involved, and these include gypsum
supplier, consulting engineer, design–build contractor, technical contractors, and
possibly other contractors. The departments or project teams of the companies who
are involved in the project are deﬁned as organizational modules. The organiza-
tions involved in the project also work on other sub-products. The architect is
involved in all the non-technical sub-products, while the carpenter is also
responsible for construction of ceilings, ﬂoors, window sills, and skirting.
Although some of the organizational modules have continuous relationships,
these are not actually predeﬁned partnerships. Project director states that although
the carpenter contractors are part of the case company, they are only considered if
they can perform at a competitive price, and otherwise, another carpenter con-
tractor would have been chosen instead. The architect and consulting engineer are
neither permanent partners, so these will also be swappable.
The organizational modularity is evident according to the swap-within and
share-across aspects. The question is whether the standard interfaces occur. As
these are deﬁned as interaction between organizational modules, the interaction
must be standardized. An example of this could be the project clariﬁcation, which
is used by the carpenter to clarify inconsistencies or alternatives in the architect’s
speciﬁcation.
A topic, which has not been described by the literature, is the individual’s role
within the organizational modules. Both complexity management and modularity
are based on industrial production or service companies, which mainly work
through operations and permanent employees. The project organization of con-
struction systems creates an environment, where the craftsmen do not follow
speciﬁc organizational units and the different types of functional organizational
modules can consist of different companies from project to project.
548
T. C. Jensen et al.

The PPO-module. The modularity of the product and organization is clearly
not aligned, because the sub-products are designed and produced by several
organizational units and the organizational units design or produce a series of sub-
products. The process modularity dictates which and when the organizational
modules are applied. The PPO-modules, which include all three dimensions,
cannot follow the described modularity.
The different organizational units only deliver part of the product. The architect
delivers a design represented by drawings; the carpenter contractor delivers a steel
structure clad with gypsum, the painter delivers plaster and paint to the surfaces, and
the joiner delivers doors. The electrician may also install some components within
the wall. Meanwhile, the organizations and individuals are split on a series of other
sub-products with other associated processes. This provides a structure where the
products are divided into materials which dictate processes and organizations.
The PPO-module of carpenter contractor/gypsum wall will include the processes
of steel proﬁle erection, insulation installation, and gypsum board mounting. The
gypsum wall will, however, also all have PPO-modules of architect, electrical
contractor, painting contractor, and joiner contractor. All PPO-modules of the gyp-
sum walls are presented in Fig. 4. The modules will thus be a clustering of processes,
and these will also determine the sequence of PPO-modules. The carpenter con-
tractor and individual carpenters will also be part of a series of other modules.
Assessing interfaces. The PPO-module of gypsum wall/carpenter contractor
has been analyzed, and the deﬁnition of interfaces along the three dimensions has
been established. This creates a total of 32 interfaces with 15 other PPO-modules
as shown in Fig. 4. The ﬁgure is based on conservative estimations of the
empirical data and may include more as many of the other sub-products and
organizations have not been investigated in any detail.
Product interfaces. Figure 4 shows the 13 product interfaces for the gypsum
wall/carpenter contractor, which corresponds to the following:
• Internal: architect drawings, gypsum components, electrical, plaster/paint,
doors, details/ﬁnish
• External: concrete slabs, concrete walls, façades, glass walls, technical instal-
lations (HVAC, electric, sprinkler, etc.), ceilings, ﬂoors
The internal products’ interfaces all appear in the supplier’s manual and are
regular. The external interfaces are more irregular, but interfaces with the concrete
structure and technical installations are described in the manual. Architect says
that mainly interfaces toward the façades and glass walls are speciﬁcally designed
for the project, which suggests that these are irregular.
Process interfaces. Figure 4 shows the seven process interfaces with for the
gypsum wall/carpenter contractor, which corresponds to the following:
• Previous: specifying wall class and specifying wall type, manufacturing com-
ponents, mounting slab elements
• Subsequent: installing electrical installations, plastering/painting, mounting
doors, and detailing/ﬁnishing
Understanding Complex Construction Systems Through Modularity
549

The process interfaces follow a sequence caused by the process constraints. These
mainly follow the supplier’s manual, but processes where the supplier is not
involved are not described. Architect says that the speciﬁcation process consists of
dialogue with different organizational units such as the client, consulting engi-
neers, and carpenter contractor, which must lead to a series of iterations and thus
limits the consistency of the process. The product interfaces which are not regular
such as the façade and glass walls will thus not be regular in the process of
establishing these interfaces.
Organizational interfaces. Figure 4 shows the 12 organizational interfaces for
the gypsum wall/carpenter contractor, which corresponds to the following:
• Internal: design–build contractor, electrical contractor, carpenter (ﬁnishes), car-
penter (ceiling), carpenter (ﬂoor), carpenter (window sills), carpenter (skirting)
• External: Architect, Technical Contractors (HVAC, Electric, Sprinkler etc.),
Painting Contractor, Supplier, Joiner
The organizational interfaces are mainly performed through the management
such as project director. The main exception to this is the electricians, and this
creates a less regular interface from an organizational view, as each individual
carpenter thus has interaction with the electrician module instead of this going
through the management.
Assessing variety. The variety within the case project should be determined
across the three dimensions. The possible variety within the PPO-module will be
14 different wall types, 80 different carpenters, and up to 80 different methods. The
carpenters and methods are, however, connected to each other, as each carpenter
has their own method, but only if one carpenter works on each wall. The wall types
Fig. 4 Interfaces of the gypsum wall/carpenter contractor PPO-module
550
T. C. Jensen et al.

will thus contribute to the highest variety for each individual carpenter. The walls
are, however, determined not only by type, but also by geometrical variety. The
variety of geometry will increase the variety way above the 14 types. The
placement of doors and other components of the wall is neither part of the type, so
will increase variety. So when all instances of walls are considered, these will
potentially lead to all gypsum walls as unique.
The PPO-module across projects. Although most interfaces are regular to a
certain degree and the variety is mainly limited to the different types and geom-
etries, this is only for the case project. Through the interviews, a strong focus has
been on the variety of products and processes as well as relationships of organi-
zational units across project. The gypsum wall/carpenter contractor PPO-module is
set in the center when assessing it across projects, so other PPO-modules will be
swapped rather than gypsum wall/carpenter contractor.
The wall types must be similar, as they are based on the suppliers’ manual, and
although different suppliers advise the architects, the case company only has a
single supplier. The architect, however, dominates all decisions regarding geom-
etry and extra components, which increases variety further.
The organizational interfaces are not as similar across projects as the product
and process interfaces. Only few of the organizational units have worked together
before, and these are not permanent partnerships. Although it is an advantage that
the individuals of the organizational units know and trust each other, the main
determinant of an organizational unit’s involvement is the price. The main rep-
resentatives of the organizational units are the managements, while the craftsmen
are not permanent employees within the companies.
4.2 Assessing Structural and Operational Complexity
The variety of the gypsum walls is very high as almost all walls will be unique
through their geometry or embedded and mounted components. This creates a high
structural complexity for the sub-product. Although the detailed methods are very
varied, these do not increase structural complexity as methods are embedded within
each carpenter, so as long as carpenters are responsible for each wall, this will not
result in a large increase. Across projects, the amount of structural complexity will
increase even more, because of the unique geometry. The carpenter contractor’s
permanent agreement with the gypsum supplier reduces not only the sub-product
variety, but also the processes. Contrary, the individual carpenters may change
company from project to project. The structural complexity is thus high within the
case project driven by the sub-product, while both the organizational and sub-
product varieties will increase structural complexity across projects.
The interfaces of the gypsum wall/carpenter contractor are very numerous,
which leads to a more integral than modular system. The interaction between the
carpenter and electrical contractor is especially strong, and the regularity is mainly
controlled by the individuals knowing each other. Across projects, this interface
Understanding Complex Construction Systems Through Modularity
551

will be a strong driver of uncertainty, as the two interacting PPO-modules may be
exchanged from project to project. This will create different relations between the
PPO-modules and thus increases uncertainty. The rest of the interfaces are man-
aged through the contractors’ managements and so will not increase the uncer-
tainty when assessing the case project, but across projects, this will accumulate and
increase operational complexity further. This results in a high operational com-
plexity between the gypsum walls’ carpenter and electrical contractors, while the
other interfaces only provide a medium operational complexity.
5 Discussion
As the current construction system is neither optimal from a modular nor an
integral approach strategies for managing, both operational and structural com-
plexities are proposed. This is summed up and related to other ideas for developing
a new construction system. The product modularity and organizational modularity
are currently misaligned, as the product modularity and organizational modularity
follow different hierarchies. This creates many individual PPO-modules and many
strong interfaces and thus increases the operational complexity.
If a more integral organization was to be applied, these strong interfaces could
provide more regular interfaces, especially organizational interfaces. This creates
Development Initiative 1 (DI1) to manage operational complexity:
• DI1: Create regular partnerships with all organizational modules and thus use
similar products and processes for all projects.
This initiative maintains all current interfaces within the individual projects, but
stabilizes these across projects. By letting the same individuals work together, this
creates regular interfaces, and especially if the design modules use similar designs,
this will inﬂuence the product and processes to apply similar interfaces. DI1 would
automatically create a more integral organization, with more focus on partnerships
and permanent relations than ﬂexibility, which will have to be incorporated into
the system according to the actual need.
Another approach could be to align the product and organizational hierarchies.
Ericsson and Erixon [13] describe this system as ‘‘small factories within the
factory’’ and thus following an integrated value chain for each sub-product. This
would require multiple crafts within the same PPO-module and possibly also
design capabilities. The PPO-structured modularity will thus comprise of less
PPO-modules and less interfaces by integrating the supply chains for each sub-
product into single modules. This creates Development Initiative 2 (DI2) for
managing operational complexity:
• DI2: Aligning the organizational modularity with the product modularity and
creating PPO-modules by integrating all processes and organization. An illus-
tration of DI2 is shown in Fig. 5.
552
T. C. Jensen et al.

This would require sub-product contractors rather than craft contractors. The
integrated PPO-modules would increase dependencies within and decrease
dependencies without compared to the existing structure. DI2 will also ease pro-
curement and outsourcing of sub-products. This will help create system archi-
tecture, so also interfaces and standards could develop. The system architecture
will increase ﬂexibility as the PPO-modules integrating a sub-products value chain
can be exchanged at will.
The construction system is currently a mix of strong interfaces and ﬂexible
modules in all three dimensions. The two solutions thus go in two different
directions: more integral or more modular, where either the interdependence or the
exchange of modules shall be reduced. The paper has also found connections
between operational complexity and modularity. As systems become more inte-
gral, the amount and strength of interfaces increases. This causes the operational
complexity to increase, and when modules are swapped and shared, this opera-
tional complexity increases drastically.
Modularity is applied on many levels, and this paper has explored modularity
on a holistic level, especially product modularity of industrial production requires
very speciﬁc interfaces. The interfaces of construction sub-products are dominated
by less-deﬁned point, line, and surface interfaces, where sub-products can be
mounted onto the bearing structure at will. Ulrich and Tung’s [14] cut-to-ﬁt
modularity thus becomes dominant, while still retaining the swap-within and
share-across modularity.
Based on the ﬁndings and experiences gathered through the case, it is concluded
that the principles of mass customization of a sub-part can be successful when
implemented stepwise. The case shows that substantial beneﬁts can be gained
through implementing modularized construction. It is especially interesting to note
Fig. 5 An example of how the PPO-structured modularity could be implemented through
Development Initiative 2. Development initiative 1 would resemble the interfaces and structure
found in Fig. 4 for all sub-products
Understanding Complex Construction Systems Through Modularity
553

that these beneﬁts are achieved through the development of a module with focus
on the internal interfaces [15].
The generally craft-based organization thus seems to be a remnant of the past.
Current implementations of ICT in the industry, such as BIM, do not ﬁt well into
the current construction system [16], but could be heading development toward a
new system, which organizationally would be more operation based. As shown in
the analysis is the current system very fragmented, and the development is difﬁcult
to implement rationally in such a system [17]. As is often said when discussing
industry competition: ‘‘Supply chains, not businesses, are the competitors of
tomorrow.’’
6 Conclusion
The complexity in construction projects arises because the system is integral, but
acts modular. The integral property arises because the misalignment between the
product modularity and organizational modularity and combined with the frag-
mented organization, variety, and interfaces cannot be managed, especially as the
design and production are performed by different organizations.
The paper has attempted to show that the PPO-structured modularity can link
the dimensions of product, process, and organization into a common system. The
PPO-modules are developed by combining product, process, and organizational
modularity into a common structure where the interfaces are also deﬁned across all
three dimensions. The PPO-structured modularity is based on the complexity cube
and thus uniting modularity with complexity management. This has also added to
both concepts, mainly through linking operational complexity with the modular-
integral continuum. Applying PPO-structured modularity to a project environment
was applicable, and the case project showed how gypsum walls have a dispersed
supply chain, with 32 interfaces from a contractor perspective.
PPO-modules of gypsum walls provide variation possibilities and thus serve
perfectly to individual customer needs. The different combinations of PPO-modules
enable various numbers of solutions, thanks to the ﬂexibility and creativity they
possess.
This paper has also developed paths for the industry to pursue in order to
manage complexity. This involves developing the construction system as either
more integral or more modular, where the integral path is to standardize PPO-
modules of the current system through permanent partnerships, while the modular
path aligns the organizations according to the sub-products.
This will generate the level of process stability that mass customization highly
depends on. Thus, modular production of the studied construction product gypsum
wall contains great promises for applying mass customization principles within
PBP.
