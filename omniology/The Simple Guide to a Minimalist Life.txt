A small irony
Yes, I know it's ironic that a book on 
minimalism is more than a page or two long. 
The content isn't minimalist, and that's 
contradictory, right?
Well, sure. I could do a book that's just a 
paragraph long. But would that be worth 
your time and money? Would it help you 
achieve what you came here for?
I wanted to create a really useful guide, and 
so that means I've put a "more than minimal" 
amount of information into this book. I hope 
that's good for you. If not, delete the book 
now!

Notes on
using this book
The ﬁrst thing to note is that this isn’t a step-
by-step guide that you should follow from 
beginning to end.
It’s a series of guides on different areas that 
can help you explore a life of minimalism. 
There is no one single path -- yours will be 
different than mine, and I can’t prescribe 
exact steps you should take.
I share my experiences and what I’ve learned 
in hopes that it’ll help you.
Second note is some will notice that not 
everything in this book is new material. Some 
is new, but much is gathered from various 
writings I’ve made on these topics around 
the web. I highly doubt that anyone reading 
this ebook has read all the articles previously 
published -- they’ve been widely scattered, 
and over a long period of time.
Even still, I’ve updated and expanded on 
previous writings, and I’ve added some new 
content. I’ve put it all together in hopes that 
it’ll save you some time searching for good 
articles on these topics.
Use this as a reference guide that you refer 
back to, because on your journey you’ll ﬁnd 
new things on each reading, as you go 
through this process. I hope it’ll be a useful 
guide on this journey.

What is a
minimalist life?
It's one that is stripped of the unnecessary, to 
make room for that which gives you joy.
It's a removal of clutter in all its forms, 
leaving you with peace and freedom and 
lightness.
A minimalist eschews the mindset of more, of 
acquiring and consuming and shopping, of 
bigger is better, of the burden of stuff.
A minimalist instead embraces the beauty of 
less, the aesthetic of spareness, a life of 
contentedness in what we need and what 
makes us truly happy.
A minimalist realizes that acquiring stuff 
doesn't make us happy. That earning more 
and having more are meaningless. That 
ﬁlling your life with busy-ness and 
freneticism isn't desirable, but something to 
be avoided.
“Be Content with what you 
have; rejoice in the way things 
are. When you realize there is 
nothing lacking, the whole 
world belongs to you.”
- Lao Tzu

7
A minimalist values quality, not quantity, in 
all forms.
I'm a minimalist, and it's something that's 
deeply satisfying. I wake in the morning in a 
room that lacks clutter, in the quiet of the 
early morning, have coffee and read, go out 
for a run, and then write. Work a little more, 
spend some time with my family.
These are the things that make me happy. 
Not buying a lot of things. Not traveling all 
the time, nor going to parties or spending 
money on expensive entertainment. Not 
watching a lot of television and being 
bombarded with ads. Others might ﬁnd joy 
in these things, and I'm not criticizing them. 
I'm just stating what makes me happy.
And that's the key. Figure out what makes 
you happy. Get rid of the rest, so you have 
room for those important things. It's not a life 
of nothing, of boringness. It's a life of 
richness, in less.
Your minimalist life will be different than 
mine. You'll need to ﬁgure out what makes 
you happiest. Plan your ideal day. Then strip 
your life of the non-essentials, to make room 
for this ideal day, for the things and people 
you love. This book is meant to help you ﬁnd 
that path.

Overall minimalist
principles
Minimalism isn't necessarily all about less. 
It's also not an end in and of itself. It's a path, 
to help you to:
* Have more freedom
* Have more time
* Have more room for what's important
* Have less worry
* Have more pleasure
* Be more frugal
* Become greener
* Become healthier
The Minimalist Principles
There are some key principles we'll be 
repeating throughout this book, in various 
forms. It's important to list them here:
1. Omit needless things. Notice this doesn't 
say to omit everything. Just needless things.
2. Identify the essential. What's most 
important to you? What makes you happy? 
What will have the highest impact on your 
life, your career?
3. Make everything count. Whatever you do 
or keep in your life, make it worthy of 
keeping. Make it really count.

9
4. Fill your life with joy. Don't just empty 
your life. Put something wonderful in it.
5. Edit, edit. Minimalism isn't an end point. 
It's a constant process of editing, revisiting, 
editing some more.
In anything you do, see if you can apply 
these principles. There’s no need to get 
obsessive about it, of course, but it’s always 
useful to examine what we do, how we do it, 
and whether we really need to do it.
“Fear less, hope more; eat 
less, chew more; whine less, 
breathe more; talk less, say 
more; love more, and all good 
things will be yours.”
- Swedish proverb

How to become
a minimalist
While minimalist aesthetics and products 
and the minimalist lifestyle appeals to a lot of 
people, they ﬁnd it easier to like it than to 
live it.
Minimalism is something people might strive 
for, but they don’t know where to start. There 
are lots of things to do, to think about, and it 
can be overwhelming. Here's where I'd start:
* Start by realizing you already have 
enough. We'll look more into this in the next 
chapter, but this is really key. Being content 
with what you have is important, or all the 
decluttering in the world won't matter, 
because you'll just want more.
* Start cutting back on clutter and 
possessions. We'll get into this asap, but 
really if you have a home or ofﬁce full of 
clutter, you're not minimalist yet. We want to 
get rid of this clutter, and it can be done in a 
weekend or two, or it can be done slowly 
over the course of weeks. Either is ﬁne, but 
the key is to start.

11
* Start simplifying your schedule. Cut back 
on commitments, take the unnecessary stuff 
out of your schedule, and leave some 
breathing room. Allow yourself to focus on 
the important stuff.
* Slowly edit everything you do, with 
minimalist principles in mind. It's a constant 
process.
That's it. It's pretty simple. We'll go into more 
depth, of course, covering eating and ﬁtness 
and ﬁnances and family and all of that.
But at the core of things, to become a 
minimalist, all you need to do is the four 
things above.
“Great acts are made up of 
small deeds.”
- Lao Tzu

12
Contentedness: You 
already have enough
This is really the starting place. It's not 
enough to just strip things bare, because 
clutter will eventually accumulate if you 
continue to acquire things. And at the root of 
the desire to acquire is a discontentedness 
with how things are now.
If you're buying things you don't need, it's 
because you're dissatisﬁed in some way. You 
want more, not just what you have now. You 
want more excitement, fun, ways to make 
your life better. You want something cooler. 
Whatever the reason, you're not happy with 
what you have.
It's a problem that can go pretty deep, but the 
solution doesn't have to be complicated. 
Here's what I suggest:
1. Realize you already have all you really 
need. What are the things you truly need? 
Food, water, basic clothing, shelter, loved 
ones. Everything else is extra. You don't need 
the latest technology, stylish clothing, cool 
new shoes, a fancy car, a big house.
2. Learn to stop buying non-necessities. This 
might sound difﬁcult, but it's a matter of 
being conscious of it. One great method is to 

13
start a 30-day list -- make it a rule that if you 
want to buy a non-necessity, you have to put 
it on this list (with the date it was added) and 
you can't buy it for at least 30 days. If you 
still want it after 30 days, you can buy it. This 
usually works, because the urge to buy 
dissipates. Always ask before buying: Is this 
an absolute necessity?
3. Learn to be happy by doing, not owning. 
We can be happy with just the true 
necessities, if we learn that owning things, 
having things, does not make us happy. 
Instead, doing things can make us happy -- 
talking with a friend, taking a walk with a 
loved one, cooking, creating, singing, 
running, working on something exciting. If 
you can focus on doing things that make you 
happy, you'll have less of a need for stuff.
4. Learn the concept of Enough. This is the 
idea that we don't always need more -- that 
once we reach a certain point, we have 
enough. The key is to learn to recognize 
when that is. Often we don't realize we have 
enough, and are caught up in the cycle of 
more.
“He who is contented is rich.”
- Lao Tzu

14
Having more breeds wanting more. It's an 
endless cycle of more, an addiction to 
acquiring and owning. We need to learn 
when enough is enough, and be happy with 
what we have.
This doesn't happen overnight. It takes time, 
but most importantly it takes a consciousness 
of all of this -- of necessities vs. wants, of 
more vs. enough, of being happy by doing 
not owning. Over time, this consciousness 
will result in a contentedness with what we 
already have, which is a true foundation for a 
minimalist life.
“The secret of happiness, you 
see, is not found in seeking 
more, but in developing the 
capacity to enjoy less.”
- Socrates

15
Rethinking 
necessities
One of the basics of minimalism is that you 
eliminate as many non-necessities as you can, 
to make room for what’s important.
If you don’t need a ton of clothing, you get 
rid of much of it. If you don’t need that new 
gadget, you don’t buy it. Within reason, of 
course.
You learn to be content with what you 
already have, with the necessities, with doing 
things you love rather than having things.
But it’s funny, because often things we 
assume are necessities are not necessarily so. 
The problem is that we categorize things as 
necessities because we’re used to them, and 
we can’t see how to live without them. And 
it’s difﬁcult to make big changes.
Some examples:
 • 
A car. Cars are seen as necessities, but 
amazingly, people lived without them 
for quite awhile before the 20th 
century. Even today, some people 
manage to go carless. And it’s not 
impossible — especially if you live in a 
place with a decent public 
transportation system. And there are 
car sharing options now in many cities, 
so you can use a car when you need it, 
for much less than actually owning a 
car. It’s possible to bike and walk most 

16
places, and take public transit and 
shared cars everywhere else.
 • 
Meat. Many people believe they can’t 
live without steaks and burgers. And I 
was one of them. These days, I’m not 
only vegetarian, but mostly vegan. 
And it’s not that hard to change, if you 
do it slowly. It’s also healthier and 
better for the environment — meat and 
dairy animals are tremendously 
harmful to the environment and a huge 
waste of our natural resources.
 • 
Lots of clothes. While I don’t advocate 
going naked (though some do it) nor 
do I recommend just owning one 
outﬁt, it is possible to own less clothing 
than most people have. We don’t need 
to constantly buy clothes to stay 
fashionable — we can buy quality, 
timeless clothing, with colors and 
patterns chosen so that all our clothes 
go with each other.
 • 
A big house. Have less stuff, you need 
less house.
These are just a few examples — think about 
all the things you consider necessities. Are 
they really? What’s really needed, beyond 
food, shelter, basic clothing, and loved ones?
“If your mind isnʼt clouded by 
unnecessary things, then this 
is the best season of your life.”
- Wu-Men

17
Simplify what you do
Living a minimalist life isn't just about 
eliminating physical clutter. It's about 
reducing the clutter of your busy schedule, 
your work life, all the running around you 
might normally do.
It's about doing only what's necessary, so you 
have time for what makes you truly happy.
Reduce commitments
The most important thing you can do to 
simplify your schedule is to list all your 
commitments, and pick the most important 
ones. Commitments include everything that 
takes up your time, from work projects to 
side jobs to serving on civic committees to 
coaching for your kids' soccer team to 
renovating your home to serving on a PTO or 
other school committee.
These commitments are easy to say "yes" to, 
but they ﬁll up our lives as they accumulate, 
until we're so busy we have no time for 
what's really important to us. Minimalism 
suggests we reduce these commitment to just 
the most important, leaving room in our lives 
for what we love most and leaving space so 
we're not as stressed out.

18
To do this, make a list of every commitment 
you can think of. Anything you do on a 
regular basis, or that you've committed to 
doing in the near term or long term.
Now mark this list: what are the 4-5 most 
important commitments? The things you 
love most, that are most valuable to you. 
These are your top priorities. Everything else 
should be removed, if at all possible.
To remove commitments, you need to make a 
phone call or send an email informing people 
that you can no longer commit to something. 
This is difﬁcult and uncomfortable, because it 
means saying "no" to people, and often 
disappointing them. But you know what? 
They'll live, and their projects and lives will 
go on. While it's difﬁcult to disappoint 
people, it's rarely as bad as we fear.
This is a slow process of removal -- there will 
be some commitments you can't get out of 
right away. But if you keep in mind that you 
want to eventually get rid of all non-essential 
commitments, you'll slowly get out of them, 
either by saying "no" or when the 
commitments are ﬁnished naturally.
It's important, from this point on, to try to 
say "no" to all requests for commitments if 
“Nature does not hurry, yet 
everything is accomplished.”
- Lao Tzu

19
they're not on your essential list -- things you 
really love doing. You should want to say 
"Hell yes" to new commitments -- or say no. 
Don't just say yes.
Once you've gotten rid of non-essential 
commitments, your life will be freed to do 
the things you've always wanted to do.
Clear your schedule
See how clear you can make your schedule. 
This means cutting back on meetings, which 
are often a waste of time anyway. It means 
not making appointments if you can avoid it. 
It means leaving big blocks of time available 
for creating, for doing the work you love, for 
doing other things you love.
Leave space between things in your schedule. 
The space helps you to go through your 
schedule with less stress, and if things run 
long, it won't throw everything off.
If you can, leave entire days without 
scheduled appointments. That doesn't mean 
you won't do any work -- it just means 
nothing is hard-coded into your calendar.
Cut back on your to-do list
If you have a long to-do list ﬁlled with lots of 
things to do, the minimalist way is to 
simplify the list.

20
To do this, you must be honest with yourself: 
can you really do all the things on your todo 
list today? How about in the next three days? 
Often we believe we can do more than we 
actually can, and as a result we make long to-
do lists that we could never do in a day or 
three.
Now, it's the nature of to-do lists to be never-
ending, but the real problem is that they're 
ﬁlled with lots of tasks that keep us super 
busy. And instead, we should be focusing on 
fewer tasks, not more.
Fewer tasks means we're less busy. It also 
means that we must select the most 
important ones the tasks that will have the 
highest impact on our work and our lives.
Choose three tasks for each day -- really 
important, high-impact tasks. These three 
Most Important Tasks (MITs) should be your 
focus each day, and ideally you should do 
them before working on any tasks of lower 
importance.
Do the important stuff ﬁrst. Worry about the 
little things later.

21
On clearing clutter
Clutter is poison to a minimalist. The 
minimalist will toss out the unnecessary and 
be left with sparse beauty.
The problems with clutter:
* stuff weighs you down
* stuff stresses you out
* stuff is expensive, to buy, store and 
maintain
* looking for stuff in clutter leads to wasted 
time
* clutter is a reﬂection of your internal state
You accumulate clutter by being in the 
mindset of Acquiring rather than a mindset 
of Enough. You accumulate it by having a 
fear mentality, not wanting to let go of things, 
wanting to hoard and keep everything for 
sentimental reasons.
Being too busy also leads to clutter, because 
we don't have time to clean up, don't have 
time to get rid of the unnecessary, and clutter 
will pile up. So reducing what you do will 
help clear clutter.
Not having a system for dealing with stuff, 
and not having the habits to keep the system 

22
going, will lead to clutter. You can declutter 
you home and get it looking beautiful, but if 
you don't have a system and habits in place, 
you'll soon start putting things down in any 
old place, and soon will have clutter again.
The solution is to ﬁnd a place for everything, 
once you've done some decluttering. This 
isn't too hard -- you just need to put 
something in a place you think is a good 
"home" for that thing, and then make a 
mental note of that place. Then you need to 
get into the habit of putting that thing in its 
place whenever you're done with it. It takes 
more time to form that habit, but it's not too 
difﬁcult if you do it consciously.
Beating the Fear Mentality
So if you're afraid to let go of stuff, how do 
you conquer that fear in order to declutter?
There are a few related fears or emotions 
related to keeping stuff:
* Fear of needing it again
* Reluctance to waste something valuable
* Not wanting to let go of sentimental things, 
because of emotional connection
“Have nothing in your houses 
that you do not know to be 
useful, or believe to be 
beautiful.”
- William Morris

23
These are all strong emotions and if they're 
not addressed, will stop you from 
decluttering. Here's how to beat them:
1. If you haven't used it in 6 months, toss it. 
For seasonal items such as winter clothes, 
extend the rule to 12 months or so. If you 
don't use it, you don't need it. But what if 
some occasion comes up where you do need 
it? Well, that's not likely, but ask yourself 
what you could do in such an event -- could 
you use something else instead, or borrow it 
from someone else, rent it, or in a worst-case 
scenario, buy another one (preferably used)? 
Usually, we can do without it or ﬁnd another 
solution, and usually, such a scenario doesn't 
happen -- as evidenced by not using it for the 
last 6 months. Sometimes it does, but it's not 
the end of the world.
2. It's wasteful to hold on to things. While I 
know many people who feel it's wasteful to 
get rid of things that can still be used -- and 
part of me strongly agrees with that -- this 
belief leads to the accumulation of incredible 
amounts of junk and clutter. I know because 
I've seen all their clutter. It's not pretty. 
Instead, realize that it's actually more 
wasteful to hold on to things if you don't use 

24
and love them. First, they waste space, which 
actually costs you money each month (in the 
form of rent or mortgage of your home, or 
renting or buying additional storage space). 
It also costs you time to maintain all of the 
clutter, and stress in maintaining it and see it 
and going through all of it to ﬁnd things. 
Finally, if these things are actually still usable 
and valuable, give them to someone else who 
can and will use them. Things aren't valuable 
if they're not used. So by holding onto things, 
you are preventing them from actually being 
used by someone who needs them.
3. Take a picture. If things have sentimental 
value, it's because of the memories they hold, 
not because of what they actually are or what 
they can be used for. So take a digital picture, 
or if it's a picture or document, scan it into 
your computer. You'll still have the 
memories, but they'll take up no space. Try 
this, for at least a few things, and you'll see 
that the sentimental value of things can be 
moved into the digital space to defeat this 
fear.
4. The "maybe" box. If you just can't bring 
yourself to get rid of things, have a "maybe" 
box when you declutter. This is a box for all 

25
the things you're on the fence about -- put 
them into a box, mark the date, and put the 
box into a closet or other storage. After 6 
months, if you never needed these items, get 
rid of them. This is a stopgap measure 
designed to overcome these fears.
How to Get Started
Getting started tackling a house full of clutter 
can be difﬁcult because the task is too 
overwhelming. It's important, then, to start 
small.
You don't need to take on the mountain. Just 
start with one rock at a time.
The Fly Lady (ﬂylady.net) recommends 
starting with your kitchen sink, and I agree 
with that. Clear out your sink (wash any 
dishes), clean it well, and get it nice and 
shiny. This is something you can do in 5-10 
minutes (depending on how many dishes 
there are), and it has a motivating effect.
Now keep this sink clean and shiny. From 
here, you can expand: clear your kitchen 
counters, and wipe them clean. Clear your 
kitchen ﬂoors of clutter. Keep these areas 
clean for a few days.
Expand to other rooms -- table tops, then 
ﬂoors, then shelves, then closets. One surface 
“We donʼt need to increase our 
goods nearly as much as we 
need to scale down our wants. 
Not wanting something is as 
good as possessing it.”
- Donald Horban

26
at a time. But keep the sink clean, and any 
areas you've already decluttered and cleaned, 
keep them clean.
You don't need to tackle all of this overnight. 
You can do it a little at a time -- 10-15 minutes 
a day, or more if you like. If you want, you 
can schedule a weekend of decluttering, but 
it's not necessary. Gradually, you'll get there. 
Decluttering system
Here's a brief system for decluttering:
1. Start with one ﬂat surface at a time. This 
can be a countertop, a tabletop, a section of 
the ﬂoor in a room, a shelf, the ﬂoor of a 
closet, a cabinet. Just focus on one shelf in a 
closet at a time, for example, not the whole 
closet.
2. Take everything off the surface (or out of 
the drawer or cabinet). Put it all into one big 
pile. You don't literally have to pile things -- 
just put them all together, maybe on a table 
or on the ﬂoor, but not on the table or ﬂoor 
you're decluttering. This will be your 
temporary workspace.
3. Take one thing off the pile, and make a 
quick decision with it: do you love and use 
this regularly? Have you used it in the last 6 

27
months? If so, put it in a separate "keep" pile. 
If not, put it in a "donate" box, or trash or 
recycle bag if it's actually trash. You can have 
a third option of a "maybe" box for items you 
can't decide on -- see the previous section of 
this chapter for more on that.
4. Repeat this process with every item in the 
pile, one at a time, making quick decisions 
with each item, until you're done. If you 
make quick decisions, it doesn't have to take 
long. You should now have two piles -- a 
"keep" pile, and a donate box, plus a trash 
bag. Perhaps also the "maybe" box if you go 
that route.
5. Now clean the surface, shelf, cabinet. 
Then put back the "keep" pile, neatly and 
sorted. Put spaces in between stuff. Find 
other homes for things that don't really 
belong here.
6. Put the donate box into your car to be 
dropped off tomorrow. Throw out the trash. 
Put the maybe box, if you used it, into 
storage. You're done!
Repeat this process for other ﬂat surfaces.

28
What to do with unneeded stuff
You don't need to actually throw things in the 
trash when you declutter. There are many 
options for getting rid of things you don't 
need or love. Here are a few:
* Donate to Goodwill or other such charities
* Freecycle.org - a site for giving away things 
to people who need them, in your area
* Have a yard sale
* Sell your stuff on Ebay.com (tip: put your 
CDs in bundles and sell them)
* Give things to friends and family who need 
them
* Donate DVDs and books to the library
* Sell books to used bookshops
* Recycle
* Make something out of the items, and give 
it as a gift

29
Minimalist home
I try to keep my home relatively uncluttered 
-- not completely empty or sparse, but not 
cluttered at all.
For example, on the ﬂoor of my kitchen/
dining room area are just a few essentials: 
dining table (clear of any clutter), chairs. On 
the counter is only the coffee maker.
In my living room is only a pair of couches, a 
TV stand, a side table, a lamp, and my 
computer desk and chair. The desk has only 
my iMac and keyboard, with no paper ﬁles or 
other clutter.
I don't see this kind of minimalist home as 
devoid of character and fun and life -- 
instead, I get a kind of fulﬁllment at looking 
around and seeing a home free of clutter. It’s 
calming, and liberating, and just nice.
Beneﬁts of a Minimalist Home
Just a few key beneﬁts:
* Less stressful. Clutter is a form of visual 
distraction, and everything in our vision 
pulls at our attention at least a little. The less 
clutter, the less visual stress we have. A 
minimalist home is calming.
* More appealing. Think about photos of 
homes that are cluttered, and photos of 

30
minimalist homes. The ones with almost 
nothing in them except some beautiful 
furniture, some nice artwork, and a very few 
pretty decorations, are the ones that appeal to 
most of us. You can make your home more 
appealing by making it more minimalist.
* Easier to clean. It’s hard to clean a whole 
bunch of objects, or to sweep or vacuum 
around a bunch of furniture. The more stuff 
you have, the more you have to keep clean, 
and the more complicated it is to clean 
around the stuff. Think about how easy it is 
to clean an empty room compared to one 
with 50 objects in it. That’s an extreme 
example, of course, as I wouldn’t recommend 
you have an empty room, but it’s just to 
illustrate the difference.
What a Minimalist Home Looks Like
This would vary, of course, depending on 
your taste and how extreme of a minimalist 
you want to be. I am a minimalist, but not to 
any extreme. But here are some 
characteristics of a minimalist home:
* Minimal furniture. A minimalist room 
would only contain a few essential pieces of 
furniture. A bedroom, for example, might 
have a simple bed (or even just a mattress), a 
dresser, and perhaps a night stand or book 
shelf.
“One can furnish a room very 
luxuriously by taking out 
furniture rather than putting it 
in.”
- Francis Jourdain

31
* Clear surfaces. All ﬂat surfaces are clear, 
except for one or two decorations (see next 
item). There are not a whole bunch of knick 
knacks, and deﬁnitely not stacks of books or 
papers or other items.
* Accent decorations. A home completely 
clear of things would be a bit boring, actually. 
So instead of having a coffee table completely 
free of any objects, you could have a simple 
vase with a few ﬂowers, for example. Or a 
clear desk might just have a family photo. An 
otherwise empty wall might have a tasteful 
piece of art (I use my dad’s artwork, as he’s a 
great artist).
* Quality over quantity. Instead of having a 
lot of stuff in your home, a minimalist would 
choose just a few really good things he loves 
and uses often. A really nice table, for 
example, is better than 5 pieces of press-
board furniture.
How to Create a Minimalist Home
The real key is to change your philosophy 
and shoot for the ideals in the previous 
section above. But here are some tips that I 
would offer to anyone trying to shoot for 
minimalism:
* One room at a time. Unless you’re just 
moving into a place, it’s hard to simplify an 
entire house at once. Focus on one room, and 
let that be your center of calm. Use it to 

32
inspire you to simplify the next room, and 
the next. Then do the same outside!
* Look at the furniture. The biggest things in 
any room are the furniture, so you should 
always begin simplifying a room by looking 
at the furniture. The fewer pieces of 
furniture, the better (within reason, of 
course). Think of which furniture can be 
eliminated without sacriﬁcing comfort and 
livability. Go for a few pieces of plain, simple 
furniture (example of a minimalist coffee 
table) with solid, subdued colors.
* Only the essentials. Whether looking at 
your furniture or anything else in the room, 
ask yourself if the item is truly essential. If 
you can live without it, get it out. Try to strip 
the room down to its essentials — you can 
always add a few choice items beyond the 
essentials later.
* Clear ﬂoors. Except for the furniture, your 
ﬂoors should be completely clear. Nothing 
should clutter the ﬂoor, nothing should be 
stacked, nothing should be stored on the 
ﬂoor. Once you’ve gotten your furniture 
down to the bare essentials, clear everything 
else on the ﬂoor — either donate it, trash it, 
or ﬁnd a place for it out of sight.
* Store stuff out of sight. This has been 
mentioned in the above tips, but you should 
store everything you need out of sight, in 
drawers and cabinets. Bookshelves can be 

33
used to store books or DVDs or CDs, but 
shouldn’t have much else except a few 
simple decorations (not whole collections of 
things).
* Simple artwork. To keep a room from being 
boring, you can put a simple painting, 
drawing or photo, framed with a subdued, 
solid color, on each wall if you want. Leave 
some walls bare if possible.
* Simple decorations. One or two simple 
decorations can serve as accents for a 
minimalist room. A vase of ﬂowers or a small 
potted plant are two classic examples. If the 
rest of your room has subdued colors, your 
accents could use a bright color (such as red, 
or yellow) to draw the eye and give a plain 
room a splash of energy.
* Plain patterns. Solid colors are best for ﬂoor 
coverings (if you have any), furniture, etc. 
Complex patterns, such as ﬂowers or 
checkers, are visual clutter.
* Subdued colors. You can have a splash of 
bright color in the room, but most of the 
room should be more subtle colors - white is 
classic minimalist, but really any solid colors 
that don’t stress the eyes is good (earth colors 
come to mind, such as blues, browns, tans, 
greens).
“Perfection is achieved, not 
when there is nothing more to 
add, but when there is nothing 
left to take away.”
- Antoine de Saint-Exupe

34
* Edit and eliminate. When you’ve 
simpliﬁed a room, you can probably do more. 
Give it a couple of days, then look at 
everything with a fresh eye. What can be 
eliminated? Stored out of sight? What’s not 
essential? You can come back to each room 
every few months, and sometimes you’ll 
discover things you can simplify even more.
* A place for everything. It’s important that 
you ﬁnd a place for everything, and 
remember where those places are. Where 
does you blender go? Give it a spot, and stick 
with it. Aim for logical spots that are close to 
where the thing is used, to make things more 
efﬁcient, but the key is to designate a spot.
* Sit back, relax, and enjoy. Once you’ve 
simpliﬁed a room, take a moment to look 
around and enjoy it. It’s so peaceful and 
satisfying. This is the reward for your hard 
work. Ahhhh. So nice!

35
Minimalist workspace
How minimalist is your workspace? An 
uncluttered workspace is a thing of beauty.
The deﬁnition of a minimalist workspace will 
be different for each person. The most 
extreme minimalist workspace, I think, 
would be to have no desk or papers or 
computer or anything of the kind — just 
yourself. You’d think, and talk, and maybe sit 
on the ﬂoor.
Of course, that won’t work for most of us, so 
it’s more useful to look at our minimum 
requirements, and focus on creating a 
workspace that addresses these essentials 
and nothing more.
So the ﬁrst step is for you to consider your 
requirements for working, and what’s 
The desk and computer I use.

36
essential to your workﬂow. If possible, 
streamline and simplify that workﬂow and 
those requirements. Then, once you’ve got 
that down to a minimum, see what the 
minimum setup would be for those essentials 
and your workﬂow. Eliminate everything 
unnecessary.
What are your requirements?
It’s interesting to note that what you think 
your requirements are might not be the 
minimum. They might just be what you’re 
used to doing.
Taking myself as an example: I used to work 
with tons of paper, ﬁles, sticky notes, and all 
the usual ofﬁce tools (pens, pencils, 
notebooks, pads, stapler, hole puncher, 
whiteout, calendar, personal organizer, etc.). 
But then I realized that it’s possible to work 
without paper, and I’ve eliminated the need 
for all that stuff. In fact, as I’ve eliminated 
paper, I’ve eliminated the need for drawers.
Now, you might not have that luxury, and 
you might not want to go that extreme. Your 
needs are different than mine — but the point 
is to see if it’s possible to change the way you 
work, so that you still get the essentials done, 
without all the same requirements. It’s worth 
some thought at least — and if you make 
changes, as I did, you might ﬁnd that 
“Our life is frittered away by 
detail… Simplify, simplify, 
simplify! … Simplicity of life 
and elevation of purpose.”
- Henry David Thoreau

37
changing things in small increments is better. 
I didn’t do away with paper altogether. I did 
it in steps, eliminating different needs for 
paper one at a time.
My Minimalist Setup
Basically, I have an iMac and a very 
minimalist desk, with no drawers, printer, 
papers, ﬁles, or ofﬁce tools.
I work from home these days, and I do 
everything online. I do have a phone 
(elsewhere in my house, so it doesn’t disturb 
me) and a cell phone (also elsewhere), but I 
don’t have a PDA, an iPod, a printer (though 
my wife has ordered one for her needs), a 
scanner, a fax machine, or anything like that. 
I don’t print anything and I don’t use fax (an 
outdated technology).
On my computer, I mostly just use the 
browser, as I do nearly everything online. I 
also use text programs for writing and a 
couple other utilities for uploading ﬁles and 
photo editing.
All my organizing needs are taken care of on 
the computer: Address Book, Gmail, text ﬁles 
for to-do lists and errands and ideas and 
projects, Gcal for scheduling.

38
Tips for Creating Your Own Minimalist 
Workspace
You won’t need to have my setup, but once 
you’ve determined your minimum needs, 
here are some tips for making your 
workspace as minimalist as possible. Not all 
tips will work for you, so pick and choose 
which ones will work best for your workﬂow.
* Have one inbox. If paper is a part of your 
life, keep an inbox tray on top of your desk 
and make sure ALL papers, including phone 
messages and sticky notes, go into this tray. 
You might have to train your co-workers who 
put papers on your desk if they’re not 
already used to this. Don’t leave papers 
scattered all over your desk, unless you’re 
actually working on them at this moment. 
You might also have a “working ﬁle” folder 
for papers you’re working on but not at this 
moment, but put this working ﬁle in a 
drawer, so that it’s out of the way.
* Clear out your inbox each day. Nothing 
should go back in there after you process 
them. It’s not a storage bin, but an inbox. To 
clear your inbox, process top down, one item 
at a time. Make quick decisions on each item, 
and take action: ﬁle immediately, trash, 
forward to someone else, take immediate 
action, or put it on your to-do list and in your 
action folder to later action.
* Clear your desk. Aside from your 
computer, your inbox tray, your phone, and 

39
maybe a nice photo of a loved one, there 
should be nothing on top of your desk. No 
papers (again, unless you’re working on 
them), no notes, no stapler or pens or other 
junk. Clear as much of it off as humanly 
possible. If you want to include a couple 
other essentials, you should, but be sure they 
absolutely must be there. Keep it as clear as 
possible, as a clear desk is a relaxing 
workspace. Use the decluttering method in 
the chapter on Clearing Clutter.
* Get rid of knick-knacks. This goes with the 
above item, but many people don’t even 
think about all the little trinkets they have on 
top of their desk. They’re usually 
unnecessary. Toss ‘em!
* Clear the walls. Many people have all 
kinds of stuff posted on their walls. It creates 
visual clutter. Get them off your walls. If it’s a 
reference guide, put it on your computer and 
set up a hotkey so you can call the guide up 
with a keystroke when needed.
* Clear your computer desktop. We'll cover 
how to keep your computer as minimalist as 
possible in the next chapter.
* Re-examine your paper needs. While you 
might think the way you do things now is 
necessary, it's possible you can do things 
digitally instead of through paper. Give this 
some serious thinking, and if possible, 
eliminate paper to the extent you can. It'll 

40
give you a more minimalist workspace. More 
on this in a couple chapters.
* Eliminate unnecessary tools. Think about 
each tool you have in your desk, in your 
work area, and even in your ofﬁce. Do you 
need a stapler and hole puncher? Do you 
need all those pens? Do you really need a fax 
machine? Or a scanner? You might not have 
control over all these types of tools, but if you 
do, eliminate the ones you don’t really need, 
maybe one at a time.
* Simplify your ﬁling. As mentioned above, 
it’s unnecessary to keep paper copies of ﬁles 
you have on your computer or can access 
online. Back stuff up online if you’re worried 
about losing them. Having stuff digitally 
makes them searchable, which is much better 
than ﬁling. Just archive, and search when 
necessary. If you do need paper ﬁles, keep 
them alphabetically and ﬁle immediately, so 
that you don’t have a huge “to be ﬁled” pile. 
Once every few months, weed out 
unnecessary ﬁles.
* Go through each drawer. One drawer at a 
time, take out all the contents and eliminate 
everything you don’t need. It’s much nicer to 
use drawers if you can open them and see 
order. Have a designated spot for each item 
and make sure to put those items back in that 
spot immediately, every time.
* Clear the ﬂoor. There should be nothing on 
your ﬂoor but your desk and chair. No ﬁles, 
no boxes. Keep it clear!

41
Minimalist computer
A minimalist computer setup, as paradoxical 
as that may sound to some, lends itself to a 
more serene, focused creative environment in 
my experience.
I love a clean desktop, a friction-free 
interface, and simple tools that help me focus 
on what I really need to get done: to create, 
without distractions.
And when I gaze lovingly at my icon-less 
desktop, I sigh with contentment. I really 
love simplicity.
An Uncluttered Desktop
I don’t have any icons on my computer 
desktop — I’ve had the experience of having 
a thousand icons on the desktop and it really 
doesn’t compare to an uncluttered 
My minimalist desktop.

42
environment. Sure, it may be easy to just 
double-click on a frequently used app or 
document (although that’s not as fast as what 
I suggest under the “Interface” section 
below). But having to look at so many icons 
is visual stress and distraction, so I’ve 
banished this method of working.
Now, I have zero icons on the desktop and I 
usually choose a fairly minimalist (but 
beautiful) desktop pic to complete the 
experience. See my desktop in the pic above.
Here’s what to do:
 1. 
Put all icons on your desktop into a 
folder. You could put them into a 
“Temp” folder for sorting later, or 
create two folders and sort them 
quickly: “Working” and “Archives”. 
Working is for stuff you’re working on 
right now, and Archives is for 
everything else. More on ﬁling 
structure below.
 2. 
On the Mac, remove the hard drive 
icon by selecting “Preferences” (Cmd-,) 
and under the “General” tab, deselect 
“Hard disks” under “Show these items 
on the Desktop”. On the PC, you can 
right-click on the desktop and under 

43
the “View” submenu, deselect “Show 
desktop icons”.
 3. 
On the Mac, set the Dock to auto-hide 
in the Dock preferences. I never use the 
Dock anymore (see the next section).
 4. 
Choose a serene desktop pic (or 
“wallpaper”). I like ones with a plain-
colored background (such as white or 
black) and a nice minimalist picture on 
it. Or just a nice nature scene. Nothing 
too distracting.
 5. 
I also don’t like a lot of icons or apps in 
my menu bar, so I remove everything 
that isn’t necessary. Right now all I 
have is the clock and Spotlight. On the 
PC, I do the same thing - remove 
everything.
Simple Interface
If you’re still using the mouse to open 
programs and documents, you should 
seriously consider using the keyboard 
instead. It’s super fast and frictionless, which 
means you can get things done without 
having to dig through folders or scroll your 
cursor over your entire desktop or go the 
Start menu (on a PC) or down to the Dock 
(on a Mac).
“Simplicity is the ultimate 
sophistication.”
- Leonardo da Vinci

44
On the Mac, use the free and 
awesome Quicksilver. On the PC, I 
like AutoHotKey or Launchy. The all work 
similarly: you can launch programs and 
documents with the keyboard, without 
having to use the mouse or dig through a lot 
of folders. Quicksilver is by far the best, as it 
can do so, so much more.
So you need to start writing — with a couple 
of keystrokes, your trusty writing program 
launches and you’re writing in seconds. You 
need to look something up or send an email? 
A few keystrokes away.
Keeping the interface simple like this, 
without a real need for the Finder or 
Windows interface, makes things much 
easier.
Simple Filing
You don’t have time to ﬁle, to sort all your 
stuff into a million little folders. You’re a 
busy person! You have bigger and better 
things to do! Right?
So stop ﬁling. Set up only four folders in 
your Documents folder:

45
 ▪ 
1Inbox: For things you’re 
downloading. I empty this folder daily 
so it doesn’t ﬁll up with junk.
 ▪ 
2Working: For things you’re working 
on now. Empty it weekly.
 ▪ 
3Read: For stuff to read. Empty weekly.
 ▪ 
4Archive: For everything else. When I 
empty the above three folders, I just 
dump the ﬁles in here. Do I organize it 
into subfolders and subsubfolders? 
Heck no! I just dump it all here. Why? 
Search, and online ﬁles. Read on for 
more.
Search and Online Files
You don’t need to organize all your ﬁles into 
folders anymore because of magic called 
Search. On the Mac, Quicksilver and 
Spotlight cover this well. On the PC, I 
recommend Google Desktop. These 
programs index all your ﬁles — including the 
contents of the ﬁles — and put any ﬁle at 
your ﬁngertips in seconds.
I have been using this system for a few years 
and have never had trouble ﬁnding a single 
document.

46
Then again, my hard drive doesn’t have a lot 
of documents on it (mostly movies and music 
and pictures) because I keep most of my 
documents online. I use Google Docs and 
Spreadsheets, which means I never ﬁle 
anything. I just search and it’s there in half a 
second.
Keeping all my documents online — even 
most of my photos are online using Picasa — 
means they’re accessible from any computer, 
which is important to me as I switch between 
my iMac and Macbook Air frequently, and 
sometimes work from other computers. I 
don’t need to sync anything or carry around 
a USB drive.
I know some people will say, as they always 
do, that I’m a fool for giving all my data to a 
company (Google). What if the Internet 
crashes? What if Google folds? What if they 
do evil things with all of it?
All good points. I don’t see any of that 
happening soon, and I can always export it 
all if necessary. I’ve been using this system 
for three years without a single problem. In 
those three years, I would have had to do 
17,000 syncs or transfers of ﬁles, and my hard 
drive would have crashed once or twice, 
losing valuable data if I don’t back up.

47
Tools
Your needs will differ from mine, but I 
recommend using the simplest programs for 
the work you need to do.
As a writer, I use TextEdit (on the Mac) or 
Wordpad (for the PC). I also love, love the 
program WriteRoom (Mac) 
or DarkRoom (PC) … it is so beautifully 
minimalist, and blocks out all distractions as 
I write.
For todo lists, I don’t like full-featured todo 
programs because they’re too complicated 
and invite too much ﬁddling and 
distractions. I use Gmail’s simple Task app or 
a simple text ﬁle on my desktop computer.
Keep your tools simple. It allows you to focus 
on what’s important: creating.

48
Going paperless,
digitizing
We are living in a digital world -- an obvious 
statement, perhaps, but if it's obvious why do 
we still have so much paperwork in ofﬁces?
While at one time I was a paper pusher, 
several years ago I started re-examining my 
assumptions, as things became more and 
more digital. Do I really need this to be in 
paper form? The answer, in every single case, 
was "no".
The only reason you can't change something 
from paper form to digital is that someone -- 
perhaps you, perhaps a client, perhaps a boss 
-- is reluctant to change the way things are 
done. They don't want to ﬁgure out a new 
way to do things, because that can be 
difﬁcult.
Sure, changing from paper to digital takes 
some work, but think of the reward: an ofﬁce 
that doesn't have mountains of paperwork, 
that doesn't have huge ﬁling cabinets full of 
paper ﬁles, that doesn't have to spend so 
much on paper products and waste so many 
natural resources.
A digital ofﬁce is a minimalist one in many 
ways. Information takes up so much less 

49
space, for one, which means less storage 
space is needed and less paper clutter 
everywhere. There's a lot less work, because 
you don't have to move things from digital to 
paper (printing), then physically send it to 
someone in your ofﬁce (or worse, outside the 
ofﬁce), then move it from paper to digital 
(data entry), and so on. Also, digital ﬁles are 
searchable, by the computer, while 
information in paper ﬁles takes much longer 
to ﬁnd.
So yes, it takes work to go paperless, but the 
payoff is great, especially for the minimalist.
How to Go Paperless
The main things is to consider every piece of 
paper, every paper form, every paper note, 
and ask yourself whether it needs to be 
paper, and whether it can be made digital or 
not.
I can almost guarantee you, the answer is no 
(it doesn't need to be paper) and yes (it can 
be made digital).
Some examples:
* Printing things to read. If you print things 
out to read, stop. Read it digitally. That was 
an easy one.
“… in all the things, the 
supreme excellence is 
simplicity.”
- Henry Wadsworth 
Longfellow

50
* Stop keeping paper ﬁles. I used to print 
things out and ﬁle the paper in folders. Now 
I just keep everything digitally, and have it 
searchable on my computer.
* Kill faxes. If your ofﬁce still uses it, stop 
now. It's an outdated technology. Anything 
that can be faxed can be emailed -- it might 
mean you need to scan something, but it can 
be done.
* Stop sending paper memos and letters. 
Also stop circulating documents in paper 
form. I don't know if people still do this, but 
email has replaced those uses.
* Turn all your forms into online forms. Let 
people log into a website and ﬁll out the 
form. Now you don't need to enter the 
information from paper forms, and you save 
tons on printing costs.
* Invoice digitally. Lots of great online 
software to do this.
* Pay for things digitally. Stop using checks. 
Use online banking and Paypal.
* Stop bills and notices and catalogs and 
newsletters that come in the mail in paper 
form. This takes a phone call for each one.
* Stop getting paper magazines and 
newspapers. They're available online.
* Stop printing contracts to be signed and 
then mailed to other parties. Use an online 
contract signing service, such as 
echosign.com -- I've used it and it's fast, easy, 
and requires no printing or mailing. It's also 
completely legal.

51
Again, these are just some examples. Your 
situation will be different, and the difﬁculty 
of going paperless will vary from ofﬁce to 
ofﬁce. You might not be able to eliminate 
paper, but you can probably reduce it.
Digitizing your physical stuff
You probably have lots of things that are in 
paper form or in some kind of physical 
digital format, such as DVDs or CDs. These 
can all be digitized and stored on the 
computer, and the physical forms can be 
trashed or sold or given away.
I've done this with almost everything, from 
photos to memorabilia to paper records to 
DVDs and CDs. The result is I have no need 
for all this clutter, and everything is stored 
using no physical space.
This also takes a little work, but if you do it a 
little at a time, it's not hard.
A few notes:
* Digitize photos. If you have a lot of old 
print photos, you can scan them in a little at a 
time. Or send them to a company that will do 
them all for you.

52
* Take photos of memorabilia. Do you have 
little items or papers that have sentimental 
value? Snap a quick digital photo, and get rid 
of the item. The memories have been 
captured.
* Scan papers. Again, this can be done a little 
at a time, or hire a teen-ager (your own or a 
neighbor or relative) to scan them, or send 
them to a company that will scan for you.
* Digitize CDs and DVDs. There are lots of 
programs that will rip a CD or DVD, and 
then you can store all your songs and movies 
on your computer and have the library 
accessible via a program such as iTunes. You 
can do a stack of disks in an afternoon.

53
Minimalist travel
The minimalist tries to travel as light as 
possible - a light bag, a light itinerary, and a 
light attitude.
Many of us have had the nightmare 
experience of lugging around too much 
luggage, waiting in the baggage claims area, 
trying to cram too many activities into each 
day, and generally being so stressed that we 
need a vacation when we get home.
Instead, simplify your travel.
My biggest aim is to pack as lightly as 
possible and to keep my itinerary loose and 
light. I travel with just a carry-on bag, and 
don't check luggage, to make things as 
hassle-free as possible. My carry-on is just a 
small backpack. Here’s my usual packing list:
 ▪ 
Travel docs (passport, credit card, ID)
 ▪ 
minimal toiletries (deodorant, 
toothbrush)
 ▪ 
2 pairs of shorts or jeans (depending on 
destination)
 ▪ 
2 T-shirts
 ▪ 
2 pairs underwear
 ▪ 
swim trunks or hoodie (depending on 
destination)

54
 ▪ 
1 book
 ▪ 
journal and pen
 ▪ 
camera, charger
Anything else I need, I can always get at my 
destination. I can wash clothes at night. 
There's no need to take a huge amount of 
clothing. Obviously, if you're going to a 
business conference or something like that, 
your needs will be different, but for vacation, 
this will usually sufﬁce.
That said, let's look at more ways to travel 
lightly -- both in what to pack and what to 
do.
What to Pack
There are lots of different opionions on how 
to pack light and what items are essential or 
useful. What follows are a variety of tips, but 
be aware that there may be contradictory tips 
here — choose the ones that will work best 
for you.
 ▪ 
Pack as light as possible. Ask the 
simple question: “Do I want it or do I 
need it and if I need it am I will to cart 
it around?” There is little you really 
need when you travel.
“I travel light; as light, that is, 
as a man can travel who will 
still carry his body around 
because of its sentimental 
value.”
- Christopher Fry

55
 ▪ 
Travel with a light backpack. If you are 
moving between places, backpacks 
leave your hands free to hold their 
hands.
 ▪ 
Pack just a few clothes with only a 
couple complimentary, solid colors — 
no patterns. Black is a good idea if you 
need to be able to dress up and be 
casual.
 ▪ 
Limit yourself to just one pair of shoes, 
or possibly two if you're a woman.
 ▪ 
Pack only what you can carry on to the 
ﬂight.
 ▪ 
Put everything you want to bring in a 
pile and slowly strip away things that 
aren’t necessary.
 ▪ 
Leave the laptop behind, as well as 
blackberry and any other tech gadget. 
Being away from the internet’s 
constant ﬂow of data for a few days 
recharges and relaxes you in ways that 
you never experience at home.
 ▪ 
Most toiletries can be found easily in 
your destination country.
 ▪ 
Bring one book, and when you’re 
done, ﬁnd a book-exchange and trade 
it for a new one.
 ▪ 
In Asia, sarongs are a traveler’s best 
friend. A sarong works as a towel, a 

56
skirt, a makeshift bag, a scarf, a sheet. 
They’re especially good to have if 
you’re traveling low-budget, staying in 
hostels or guesthouses, which often 
don’t offer towels or even top sheets.
 ▪ 
Mail your purchases home as you go. 
This reduces what you must carry 
around with you, what you have to list 
for customs.
 ▪ 
Don’t travel with anything in your 
pockets except your passport and 
wallet. You won’t have to dig 
everything out of your pockets every 
time you go through security. Sitting in 
the plane is a lot more comfortable as 
well.
 ▪ 
Photocopies of sections of guidebooks 
so at the end of a leg of trip the copy 
goes in the trash.
 ▪ 
Take a photocopy of all your credit 
cards, passport and any other valuable 
document you have. Write down the 
emergency phone number for each 
credit card beside its photocopy. Leave 
this with a neighbour or family 
member along with your itinerary. 
Should you have your wallet and bags 
stolen and be only allowed to make 
one phone call, call this contact person 

57
who would be able to cancel your 
credit cards etc. for you. Alternatively, 
instead of photocopying your 
important documents consider 
scanning them and mailing them to 
yourself. That way you can always 
access these documents. Another 
reader suggested that you should 
encrypt documents if you email them 
to yourself.
 ▪ 
Pack only high-tech fabrics, the kind 
that dry quickly so that you can do a 
wash in the sink. You can get away 
with 2 pairs of socks for a 2 week trip 
by rinsing out the dirty pair at night. 
High tech fabric means it’s dry by the 
next morning. Cotton will stay soggy 
for days.
 ▪ 
Tilley makes underwear you can wash 
in the evening, and it will be dry by 
morning. You only need two pair, or 
even one if you are sure of ﬁnding 
somewhere to wash it!
 ▪ 
Tip for quick drying: roll a towel over 
wet fabric,and squeeze tightly.
 ▪ 
Bring a small amount of foreign 
currency to cover incidental expenses 
upon arrival, then change the rest in 

58
your destination country, as exchange 
rates are usually more favorable.
On Planning and Doing
Aside from what to pack, some ideas about 
what to do when you get to your destination, 
along with some tips en route to the 
destination:
 ▪ 
Don’t overplan your trip. Keep your 
travel itinerary ﬂuid, so that you can 
soak up the atmosphere in each place. 
Leave room for the serendipitous and 
when plans don’t work out, treat it as 
an opportunity!
 ▪ 
Arrive earlier than you think is 
necessary — for domestic travel, try to 
arrive at least 2 hours before ﬂight 
time; on international, make it three. 
This reduces the stress of waiting in a 
long security line as the time of your 
departure inches ever closer, and those 
desperate rushes to your boarding 
area.
 ▪ 
Take time for naps. Seriously.
 ▪ 
Smile a lot and talk to the locals.
 ▪ 
Eat, eat, eat and savour the ﬂavors.
 ▪ 
Don’t get caught up with sights. Plan 
some must-dos and leave the rest to 
chance.
“A good traveller has no ﬁxed 
plans, and is not intent on 
arriving.”
- Lao Tzu

59
 ▪ 
Wander around at night and stay open 
to the crazier elements of the culture.
 ▪ 
Get lots of massages.
 ▪ 
Get up early. In hot climates, this will 
help you avoid the heat of the day; in 
any climate, it will help you avoid the 
crowds and get more out of your day 
at a more leisurely pace. Equally, do 
the thing you really want to do ﬁrst, as 
often plans go awry as the day goes on.
 ▪ 
You shouldn’t try and see everything 
in a given place. In fact, you’ll 
probably have a better time if you 
focus on meeting great people (instead 
of going to great places).

Wardrobe and
grooming
Developing a minimalist wardrobe and 
grooming routine (not to mention grooming 
products) is a major challenge for most 
people.
Many people have huge closets and dressers 
overﬂowing with clothes -- so many that they 
can't possibly wear them all, and can't even 
remember what they have. It's overwhelming 
and a bit wasteful.
And grooming routines can take an hour for 
many people, even if they're rushing. They 
have cabinets and showers and drawers full 
of grooming products, from hair stuff to 
makeup to lotions to tweezers and scissors 
and razors to nail kits to facial products to 
teeth-care products to soap and shampoo and 
conditioners and bodywash and facial wash 
and more.
Now, you might not be as bad as all that, but 
if you're having trouble getting to minimal, 
you may want to rethink your needs.
Start with this: you don't need as much as 
you think you do.
Consider people who live in Third World 
countries -- many use no grooming products 
at all, except soap if they're lucky, and have 
barely any clothing. Now, I'm not suggesting 

61
you live like someone in the Third World, but 
I am saying that what you have is deﬁnitely 
more than you need. It's a matter of ﬁnding a 
balance, so you can live comfortably but not 
in excess. 
Wardrobe
To have a functioning wardrobe without 
needing too many clothes, it's best to have 
options that can all go together. Every shirt or 
top should go with every pants, shorts, or 
skirt.
The way to do this is to choose a color 
scheme and a style. For example, I go with 
plain solid colors, and most of my clothes can 
all go together -- the colors I use are blue, 
grey, black, brown, tan and green. I prefer to 
go without bright colors, but you may be 
different. Figure out your color scheme.
Stick with a classic style that won't be out of 
fashion in a few months. Go for high-quality 
clothes that won't fall apart after a few 
washes.
Let go of the need to have lots of clothes. 
Sure, there's a feeling of plenty that comes 
with having a lot of clothes, and that can be 
pleasant. But even better is a feeling of 
having quality over quantity.
“Be wary of any enterprise that 
requires new clothes.”
- Henry David Thoreau

62
Go through your closet. Take everything out, 
and separate the clothes into two piles: pieces 
you've worn in the last 6 months, and clothes 
you haven't. Of course, if it's seasonal, such 
as a winter coat, give it a 12-month window. 
Take the pile of clothes you've worn in the 
last 6 months, and put them back neatly. 
Donate the rest to charity or give it to a friend 
who'll use them.
From now on, avoid shopping if possible. 
Only go clothes or shoe shopping when you 
absolutely have to -- and even then, consider 
going to a second-hand shop. When you are 
tempted to buy something, ALWAYS ask 
yourself: "Am I going to wear this all the 
time?"
If the answer is "No" or "I'm not sure", don't 
buy it.
Grooming
This is a tough area, especially for women. I 
can't claim to know how to advise women 
when it comes to grooming, as I absolutely 
don't understand their needs. My wife, Eva, 
is far from minimalist, although she's much 
simpler than many women. She doesn't use 
hairspray or other products in her hair (she 
uses a straightener), and she uses minimal 
makeup (and sometimes none at all). But I 

63
don't pretend to understand all the facial and 
body products she uses.
I'll just describe what I do, then give some 
suggestions, and allow you to decide what's 
truly necessary for you.
I've reduced my needs greatly -- not least by 
shaving my head. I'll admit this isn't for 
everyone, but for me it has made my life so 
much simpler. I don't have need for fancy 
shampoos or conditioners or gels or sprays ... 
or even combs or brushes, for that matter. All 
I need for my head is an electric razor, which 
I apply once a week, and then I forget all 
about it.
Other than that, I use soap, a toothbrush, 
toothpaste, a razor (for shaving my beard),  
shaving cream and deodorant.
I really feel this is all that's necessary. And of 
course, if you don't shave your face, you 
need even less. And if you don't mind 
smelling a little, you don't need deodorant. 
Soap and toothpaste are pretty mandatory in 
my book.
“When you are content to be 
simply yourself and donʼt 
compare or compete, 
everybody will respect you.”
- Lao Tzu

64
What about those who don't shave their 
heads? I recommend a low-maintenance 
haircut. Perhaps something short, deﬁnitely 
something that needs minimal styling and 
brushing and product. Keep it simple.
I also think, if you use facial products or 
lotions or makeup, you should consider 
keeping it to a minimum. I won't try to list 
what that is, but you can probably ﬁgure out 
the simplest possible setup, and get rid of the 
rest (maybe keeping a few things for special 
occasions).
Keep it simple, so you can get ready in a ﬂash 
and not be weighed down by a bunch of 
clutter and a long routine.

65
Minimalist food
Most people would agree that most 
Americans eat way too much -- and 
increasingly, much of the rest of the 
industrialized world.
So for most people, eating less is the answer. 
Not diet foods or fad diets or health 
smoothies or liquid cleanses. Just eating less. 
That's easier said than done, so we'll look at 
some ways to achieve that.
But minimalism in food goes beyond that. It 
extends to what you eat, and how you 
prepare it. You want to eat foods in as natural 
a state as possible, avoiding processed foods. 
And you want to prepare them simply, so 
you don't have to eat fast food or spend all 
day in the kitchen.
Eat less
If people who are overweight, or on their 
way to becoming overweight, ate less, many 

66
of their health problems would be solved. 
Sure, eating the right foods and exercising are 
also important, but excess calories are a 
fundamental problem for most people.
When you eat too many calories every day, 
for a long period of time, they're stored as fat. 
A little fat on your body is necessary, but too 
much fat causes all kinds of health problems.
So how to eat less? Some ideas:
* Eat until you're almost full. The 
Okinawans eat until they're 80% full, and 
they're the healthiest people on earth. Don't 
wait until you're completely full.
* Eat smaller, lighter meals. Nothing heavy, 
nothing too big.
* Eat lots of ﬁber-rich and water-rich foods, 
such as fruits and veggies and beans. They're 
ﬁlling and healthy.
* Avoid the restaurants that serve huge 
amounts. Which means most of them. Or 
only order side dishes or salads if you do go. 
Or split a huge meal with someone.
* Fast for 18-24 hours, a couple times a 
week. Sounds counter to most health advice, 
I know, but read Brad Pilon's Eat Stop Eat 
book for more info. It works.
Eat clean
While eating less will solve a lot of problems, 
eating clean is also a good idea. Basically, it's 
“Less is more.”
- Ludwig Mies van der Rohe

67
eating food in its natural state, without it 
being processed.
This doesn't necessarily mean raw food, 
although raw is good. I'm not advocating a 
raw diet. I'm advocating a whole food diet, 
an unprocessed one, often called "clean 
eating".
So what is clean eating? Here's one deﬁnition 
-- mine:
 • 
Food consumed in its most natural 
state, or close to it.
 • 
Which means nothing processed.
 • 
Fruits and veggies, of course.
 • 
Nuts, legumes, natural nut butters, nut 
oils.
 • 
Whole grains, preferably not ground 
into ﬂour.
 • 
Lean proteins, although I don't eat 
meat or dairy.
This is my goal, at least. I don't do it 100% of 
the time. I shoot for about 90%.
This means I have treats, I eat out at 
restaurants, I can drink beer. Just in 
moderation.
Cook simply
I highly recommend that you cook for 
yourself. It will not only save money but save 
natural resources and it's much healthier.

68
Eating out at restaurants is convenient, but 
expensive and usually unhealthy -- even if 
you make healthy choices, they usually serve 
way too much, and usually it's not healthy.
So cook for yourself, but do it simply, with 
simple recipes that don't take a lot of time. 
Use simple, natural ingredients and some 
good spices so you can make it taste good 
without adding a lot of fatty or sugary stuff 
and without frying.
The best methods for cooking are baking, 
grilling, stir-frying, and making things like 
soups.
Some simple recipes to get you started:
* dress up an Amy's Kitchen frozen pizza 
with some veggies
* my favorite healthy breakfast: cook rolled 
oats and add berries, nuts, other dried or 
fresh fruits, ﬂaxseed, cinnamon, and a little 
agave nectar or raw sugar (more healthy 
breakfasts)
* veggie chili
* black bean tacos with lettuce, tomatoes, 
corn, salsa on corn tortillas
* yogurt, fruit, berries and nuts
* whole grain pita, hummus, olives, 
tomatoes, spinach

69
* best soup ever
* whole grain pasta, healthy pre-made 
spaghetti sauce, veggies
* quinoa w/ black beans & corn
Cook more than you need for one meal, so 
you'll have leftovers for tomorrow.
Minimalist kitchen setup
Keep your kitchen minimalist as well. Only 
keep as many dishes and silverware and pots 
and pans as you need. A couple of good, 
sharp knives and a cutting board. That's 
pretty much all you need.
Don't have single-use kitchen tools and 
gadgets -- they waste space. Things such as a 
juice maker, wafﬂe iron, ice cream scooper, 
and on and on. You will barely use them and 
they're not needed.
Veganism
You don't need to be a vegan or vegetarian to 
be a minimalist, and I'm not going to try to 
convert you here. But I think the two 
philosophies mesh very well, because they 
try to use as few resources as possible. A 
vegan, in a very minimalist way, will only eat 
what's necessary. And as meat and dairy and 
eggs aren't necessary for healthy living 

70
(they're luxuries), a vegan will do without 
them, especially as a vegan doesn't see them 
as ethical.
Becoming vegetarian or vegan doesn't have 
to be difﬁcult, nor does it have to be 
instantaneous. Like any of the changes in this 
book, you do them slowly, gradually, over 
time. That's sustainable, and it's manageable. 
Gradually eat more vegetarian meals, 
dropping one kind of meat or animal product 
at a time. You'll get used to it.
Being a vegan is actually just as liberating as 
being a minimalist, because you realize that 
before becoming vegan, you were tied to 
meat and other animal products almost 
involuntarily, because of advertising and a 
culture of excess.
“Nothing will beneﬁt human 
health and increase chances 
for survival of life on Earth as 
much as the evolution to a 
vegetarian diet.”
- Albert Einstein

71
Minimalist ﬁtness
We've covered eating healthier, but what 
about exercise? This is another tough area for 
a lot of people, because many people either 
hate exercise or put it off for various reasons.
But getting ﬁt doesn't have to be difﬁcult or 
complicated. What's the minimal amount of 
exercise you need to get ﬁt? What kind of 
exercise do you need to do, and what kind of 
equipment do you need?
Minimalist ﬁtness focuses on working out 
less than others would have you do, with less 
equipment. Two common barriers for people 
who want to exercise and get in shape are a 
lack of time and money needed for ﬁtness.
Less time
Exercise doesn't need to take an hour or two 
each day -- you can get by on an hour or two 
a week if you do it right.
In fact, if you're just starting out in exercise, I 
suggest you start small, and start slowly. Just 
start walking, if you've been inactive, for 
15-20 minutes a few times a week. If you've 
been active, 20 minutes a day, 5 days a week 
would be great. Eventually getting up to 30 

72
minutes is even better, but you can get a great 
workout in just 20 minutes.
Who doesn't have 15-20 minutes to save their 
lives? Do it in the morning, after you wake 
up, at lunch, or right after work on the way 
home.
If you've been active for a few months, you 
can get a great workout by doing intervals 
(walk-run, or jog-run, or biking slow then 
fast, or swimming), or by doing some of the 
bodyweight workouts below.
The key is to get active, most days of the 
week (4-5 is best). Get outside, do something 
fun. Play basketball, go skating, surf, run and 
jump with your kids, play soccer or rugby, 
climb or hike or paddle.
If you go longer than 20-30 minutes, because 
you're having fun, that's OK, but it's not 
necessary.
Minimal equipment
It takes no equipment to get a great workout 
and get in shape, and with one or two pieces 
of simple equipment, you can turn that great 
workout into a fantastic one.
“People love chopping wood. 
In this activity one immediately 
sees results.”
- Albert Einstein

73
And with little or no equipment required for 
a fantastic workout, you can do it at home, or 
wherever you are. It’s hard not to ﬁnd time 
for this type of workout — you can even do it 
while watching TV!
Using just your bodyweight, you can do a 
large number of challenging exercises. I 
designed a workout that I do when I can’t 
make it to the gym, for example, and I can 
testify that it’s incredibly challenging.
If you add just one or two pieces of 
equipment: a dumbbell, a kettlebell, a jump 
rope, a medicine ball, or a chinup bar, for 
example, you can increase the challenge even 
more.
Bodyweight workouts are great because there 
are no gym fees or need to buy expensive 
equipment, you can do the workout 
anywhere, anytime, most exercises involve 
many muscles working in coordination, 
resulting in great overall ﬁtness and strength, 
and for people who are just starting with 
strength training, bodyweight is often more 
than enough to begin with. And it gives you 

74
a good foundation of strength you can build 
on later.
I suggest starting with bodyweight exercises, 
and then slowly transitioning to a 
combination of bodyweight and weight 
training to get a good balance. And even if 
you’re doing a complete weight training 
program, you can always use bodyweight 
exercises anytime you can’t make it to the 
gym.
A sample bodyweight workout: a circuit of 
pullups, pushups, jump squats, bicycle 
crunches, jumping lunges, burpees, hanging 
knee raises, diamond pushups, planks, 
chinups. This is by no means the only way to 
do it -- there are tons of other bodyweight 
exercises you can choose from, and you 
should mix it up with a variety of cardio 
exercises as well.
Get outside and get active. Walk or run or 
bike. Mix in some dumbbells, barbells, 
kettlebells, jump rope, martial arts. As you 
get better, make your workouts short but 
intense. Also try Crossﬁt to really challenge 
yourself with a minimalist workout.

75
Minimalist ﬁnances
Finances are one of the most complicated 
things in many people's lives ... and yet, they 
don't have to be.
With a little effort, you can simplify your 
ﬁnancial life and end the money headaches 
most people face. Here's how to simplify 
your ﬁnancial life:
1. End consumerism. This is the ﬁrst and 
most important step. Too often we get into 
the mindset of buying, of attaining more, of 
shopping for pleasure or stress relief or 
ﬁnding self-worth, of impulse buys. This is a 
mindset that comes from years of exposure to 
advertising, and it's hard to stop. Start by 
becoming more conscious of it, and by telling 
yourself that you will no longer ﬁnd pleasure 
in buying and having material things.
When you ﬁnd yourself with an urge to buy, 
stop, and breathe. Put the item on a 30-day 
list and don't buy it until 30 days after you 
put it on the list -- usually the impulse will 
dissipate. Give thought to every purchase 
and ask yourself, "Is this really, really 
necessary? Can I live without it?" Try to live 
only with what's necessary, and get 
happiness from doing things, from spending 
time with people, from creating ... rather than 
from material goods and spending.

76
2. Save up an emergency fund. Before you 
can ﬁnd ﬁnancial peace of mind, you need an 
emergency fund, otherwise you're always 
going to be living on the edge, from paycheck 
to paycheck. Every unexpected expense that 
comes up will derail everything I recommend 
below, if you have no emergency fund. This 
point has been driven home many times on 
this site, so I won't belabor it. But start here. 
Save up at least $500 by putting $50-100 per 
paycheck towards this fund, and gradually 
build up to $1000 or more.
To do this, cut out unnecessary expenses. 
Look closely at your spending, including 
regular payments you might have forgotten 
about, and see what can be cut. There's 
always something: magazine subscriptions, 
monthly payments for services you don't 
really need (including online services), 
buying books when you could use the library, 
cable TV, a bigger car than you really need, 
gourmet coffee when you can make your 
own at home, a bigger home than you need, 
storage space when you could just sell your 
stuff, clothes and shoes when you already 
have plenty, gadgets and computer purchases 
you don't really need, going out to lots of 
restaurants or bars or clubs or other 
expensive entertainment when you could 
stay home or do fun things without spending 
much.
“Too many people spend 
money they havenʼt earned, to 
buy things they donʼt want, to 
impress people they donʼt like.”
- Will Rogers

77
Put all money you cut out into your 
emergency fund until it gets to at least $500.
3. Get out of debt. This is important -- 
otherwise, minimalist ﬁnances will be 
difﬁcult to achieve. Debt payments are not 
essential -- you shouldn't have them in the 
ﬁrst place. But until you pay them off, they'll 
be headaches.
After you've saved at least $500 for your 
emergency fund, put most of your extra 
income towards debt payment, one debt at a 
time, until you're all paid up. Maybe put a 
little each paycheck towards your emergency 
fund.
This step will take the longest, but it's well 
worth it. And you can do the other stuff on 
this list immediately, without having to 
complete this step ﬁrst.
4. Use cash, not credit. I'm a big fan of cash, 
and a big credit card hater. Credit card bills 
are a blight on most people's ﬁnances -- they 
make it too easy to spend money you don't 
have, and then you end up paying tons in 
interest and fees. Sure, it's possible to use 
them responsibly, but in most cases, it's not 
necessary and it's an unnecessary temptation. 
Ditch the credit cards and use cash and 
(sometimes) Visa or Mastercard debit cards -- 

78
these are better as they only allow you to 
spend money you already have and not get 
into debt.
Cash is great because you can withdraw a 
pre-determined amount each month, and you 
always know how much you have left. With 
credit cards, it's easy to spend more than you 
have budgeted because to stay within a 
budget you'll have to constantly track your 
expenses. No need to track expenses with 
cash -- you can see you only have a little left. 
Try the envelope system for cash -- put 
designated amounts of cash into separate 
envelopes for groceries, gas and other 
spending.
5. Automate ﬁnances. I don't like to worry 
about paying bills, so I've made my ﬁnances 
automagical. Basically, I have all my income 
automatically deposited in my checking 
account, and I've set up automatic payment 
for all bills. Some are done by automatic 
deduction, when possible, and others are 
done by using the online bill-paying system 
of my bank, set to recurring monthly 
payments. Other bills I've paid in big chunks, 
6 months to a year at a time -- my rent, for 
example -- when I received large payments 
(such as tax returns or bonuses). I also make 
savings transfers automatic, and when I was 

79
in debt, those payments were automatic as 
well.
It helps to have a sizable emergency fund so 
you can make payments like this and not 
worry about whether there's enough in your 
account for all of your automatic bill 
payments. I've actually split my emergency 
fund into two: most is in an online savings 
account, and the rest is in my checking, so I 
always have a comfortable cushion in my 
checking account.
It takes a little while to get automated 
ﬁnances just right, but you can start today by 
setting up automatic deposits and deductions 
and bill payments. It's nice, because your 
ﬁnances also become paperless.
I recommend putting a reminder in your 
calendar to check on your bank accounts 
once a week, just for peace of mind. 
Otherwise, you can now forget about 
ﬁnances.
6. Don't buy unless you need it and have the 
money. This is such an old and common-
sense piece of advice that it's embarrassing to 
put it here, but it's important, because once 
“He looks the whole world in 
the face for he owes not any 
man.”
- Henry Wadsworth 
Longfellow

80
you've done all of the above, you're debt-free 
with a good emergency fund and automatic 
ﬁnances ... but what about purchases from 
now on? Should I buy a bike if I want to 
commute by bike? Should I buy new 
furniture? The answer is two-fold: 1) don't 
buy it unless you really need it; and 2) don't 
buy it unless you have the money already. 
Not "if you have the money next month or 
next week", but only if you have the money 
in hand. It's as simple as that.
Stay out of debt as much as possible. The last 
car I bought was used, and I was able to pay 
cash for it (with a trade-in). I hope to buy my 
ﬁrst house completely with cash, or at least 
mostly.
Don't buy it unless you need it, and only if 
you have the money. If you follow these two 
rules, you'll never have to worry about 
ﬁnances again.

81
Finding simplicity
with kids
Any parent knows that kids create clutter like 
nobody’s business. It’s enough to drive a 
minimalist such as myself crazy -- especially 
as I have six kids. Still, with a little diligence, 
and a little bit of Zen detachment, it’s 
possible to have a simple, (relatively) 
uncluttered home as well as peace of mind.
Let me ﬁrst state the obvious: any life that 
includes children is going to be complicated, 
at least to some degree. You’ll never get an 
absolute minimalist lifestyle with kids, and 
I’ve learned to accept that. While my 
minimalist inner self would like to live 
without a car, a cell phone, or a large house, 
my kids preclude those things from 
happening.
However, I have found ways to simplify my 
house, including the kids’ rooms. Sure, the 
house still gets messy — especially their 
rooms. But it’s not as bad as it once was, and 
it’s at a manageable level.
Attitudes
It's important to start with the right attitudes 
-- both for you, and your kids. All the 
decluttering in the world won't matter unless 
you address this ﬁrst.
First, you must realize that kids are messy, 
and that they don't care about clutter like you 

82
do. You'll never change this -- although some 
kids are naturally neater than most. You must 
start by accepting this, and not trying to force 
your system on them. It will only end in 
frustration.
Better is to take a more relaxed approach. Let 
kids be kids, but ﬁnd ways to educate them 
about material goods, and ﬁnd ways to 
contain their clutter. Do the decluttering for 
them -- but let them help and be a part of it -- 
and ﬁnd a compromise you can all live with. 
Being relaxed about it will keep your sanity.
Next, you might try to talk to the kids, get 
them to take the right attitude about 
possessions. They might not understand at 
ﬁrst, but as you lead by example and educate 
them, they'll eventually come to share in 
many of your values about material goods 
and clutter, even if they aren't good at being 
minimal or organized or neat. At the very 
least, they'll be more aware of it when they 
go out and become adults, and then they can 
decide what to do from there.
Kids clutter
Here are my tips for simplifying clutter with 
kids:
 
• Identify the important. The ﬁrst step 
in decluttering is identifying which toys and 
“You can learn many things 
from children. How much 
patience you have, for 
instance.”
- Franklin P. Jones

83
other possessions are truly important to the 
kids. What do they play with, what do they 
love? Then get rid of as much of the rest as 
possible, keeping only those they use and 
love.
 
• Massively purge. In the beginning, if 
you have a lot of kid clutter, you’ll want to go 
through a massive purge. The way to do this 
is to block off a day to go through their 
rooms. Do one area at a time: a drawer, a 
section of the closet, a shelf. Take everything 
out of that area, put it in a pile. From that 
pile, take only the really important stuff (See 
Tip 1). Get rid of the rest. Donate it to charity 
if it’s still good. Get some boxes and put all 
the stuff to donate in there, and when they’re 
full, load them up in your car to donate on 
your next trip. Then put back the important 
stuff, and tackle the next area. If you do this 
quickly, you can do a room in a couple of 
hours.
 
• Leave space. When you put the 
important stuff back, don’t try to ﬁll up each 
drawer, shelf or closet area. Allow there to be 
some space around the objects. It’s much 
nicer looking, and it leaves room for a couple 
of extra items later if necessary.
 
• Contain. The key for us has been to 
contain the kid clutter. We only let them keep 

84
their stuff in their rooms. The living room, 
kitchen and dining room are for household 
stuff only. We do have a play area for the two 
toddlers, and their stuff gets spread 
throughout the house, but still, we try to 
contain the kid stuff to certain areas only. 
This leaves our living area very simple and 
minimal.
 
• Bins. These are the best type of 
containers for kids stuff, in general. Bins or 
baskets. The key is to make it easy for the 
kids (or you) to toss their stuff into the bins, 
making cleanup simple. Label each bin, if 
possible, with the type of stuff that goes there 
(blocks, stuffed animals, Legos, instruments 
of destruction). If your child can’t read, use 
picture labels.
 
• Cubbies. We have a small plastic 3-
drawer organizer (we call them “cubbies”) 
for each child. They don’t take up much 
room in the closets, and it allows them to 
have a place to put their little odds and ends 
that would otherwise be all over the place.
 
• A home for everything. We haven’t 
actually completely succeeded at this, but we 
try to teach the kids that everything they own 
has a “home”. This means that if they’re 
going to put away a toy, they should know 
where its home is, and put it there. If they 

85
don’t know where the home is, they need to 
ﬁnd a home for it, and put it there from now 
on. Actually, this is a useful concept for 
adults, too, and it’s one that I’ve mastered 
and found very useful. Our kids understand 
this idea (at least, the four older ones do), but 
sometimes they forget. Still, it helps keep 
things organized.
 
• Organize like with like. Try to keep 
similar things organized together. So, one bin 
for stuffed animals, another for sports stuff. 
This makes it easier to remember. Same thing 
with clothes: underwear and socks together, 
shirts, shorts, pants, etc. All video game stuff 
in one place.
 
• One place for school papers. Similarly, 
you should have one place to keep all 
incoming school papers. We have an inbox 
for all incoming papers in our house, but we 
also keep a folder to store school papers, so 
we never have to search for them. Also, when 
we get a school calendar or a notiﬁcation of 
some school event, we enter it in our Google 
Calendar, so we never forget when stuff is.
 
• Teach them to clean. All our kids know 
how to clean up after themselves, including 
our 3-year-old. So, instead of us continually 
stressing out about the messes, we just ask 
them to clean up now and then. Sure, things 
“Your children need your 
presence more than your 
presents.”
- Jesse Jackson

86
will get messy again soon. But at least the 
kids are doing the work cleaning up, not 
us. :)
 
• Allow them to mess. Kids are not 
perfect. They will inevitably make a mess. 
You have to allow them to do this. Then, 
when they’re done, ask them to clean it up. 
No harm, no foul.
 
• Purge at Christmas, birthdays. On 
these two occasions, new stuff comes into 
their lives en masse. If you just add this new 
stuff to their old stuff, you will have a huge 
mess. Instead, we ask them to put all their 
gifts in one place. Then, a day or two after 
Christmas or their birthday, we go through 
their closets and bins and ask them what they 
want to get rid of so they can make room for 
the new stuff.
 
• Do regular decluttering. Every month 
or two, you’ll need to declutter their stuff 
again. Do it at least quarterly. You could put a 
reminder in your calendar, or just look at 
their rooms every now and then, and if it 
looks way too cluttered, schedule some time 
to do some purging.
 
• Less is more. Teach the kids that they 
don’t need to have huge piles of stuff to be 
happy. They can’t possibly play with 
everything anyway — there aren’t enough 

87
hours in the day. With less stuff, they can ﬁnd 
things more easily, they can see what there is 
to play with, and they can own better quality 
stuff (see next tip).
 
• Go for quality. Instead of getting them 
a huge pile of cheap junk, go for quality toys 
or possessions that will last long. Wood is 
better than plastic, for example. The classic 
toys are often the best. It’s best to spend your 
money on a couple of great things than a 
whole bunch of cheap things that will break 
and be relegated to the junk pile in no time.
 
• Buy less. Drastically reduce the 
amount of stuff you buy for your kids. It’s 
difﬁcult to resist them when they really want 
something at a store, I know, but you aren’t 
doing them any favors by caving in. Don’t 
deprive them completely, but also don’t spoil 
them with stuff. On Christmas, for example, 
just get them a few great things rather than a 
whole bunch of stuff.
 
• Clean as you go. I’ve learned to clean 
up messes as I go (or ask the kids to clean up 
their mess), so that the house is never a 
wreck.
 
• Clean before bed. I also do a quick 
clean-up right before I go to bed, getting any 
little things the little ones forgot to put away. 
It makes my mornings much more pleasant.

88
 
• 30-minute cleanups. On Saturdays, do 
a “30-minute cleanup”. This means that 
every child (over 5 years old probably) has a 
chore, and the whole family (including 
parents) pitch in to clean up the house. Set a 
timer, and see if you can do it all in 30 
minutes. That’s much easier for our family to 
accomplish, as we have six people (including 
two adults and a teenager) pitching in to 
ﬁnish quickly. This gives us a clean house 
and the rest of the day to have fun.
 
• Prep time. This isn’t so much to do 
with clutter as with general simplifying your 
life with kids. It helps to have prep time each 
evening and morning to prepare the kids’ 
lunches, clothes, or whatever is needed for 
whatever we’re doing that day. This means 
we get the soccer gear and drinks and snacks 
ready on soccer days, or whatever gear is 
necessary for the activities of the day. It saves 
a rush when you are trying to get out the 
door, and saves you from forgetting stuff 
later.

89
Dealing with
non-minimalist
loved ones
One of the biggest challenges for anyone 
wanting to live a minimalist life is not 
internal but external — their loved ones 
aren’t on board the minimalist train.
How do you deal with that? What’s the 
simple solution?
There isn’t one.
Dealing with others who might be hoarders, 
clutter-bugs, just plain messy, or maybe just 
regular people who don’t care about 
minimalism … it’s not easy. It’s so much 
easier to live alone and not have to worry 
about the living habits and preferences of 
others, but many of us don’t have that 
“luxury” (although there are a few beneﬁts of 
living with those who love you).
Here are some strategies that have worked 
for me. Your mileage will deﬁnitely vary.
1. Focus on yourself. While your spouse or 
partner or children may not want to declutter 
their lives or live without consumerism, you 
can, at least in the areas you control. You can 
stop buying. You can get rid of things you 
personally own that you don’t need. You can 
ﬁnd joy in doing rather than owning or 
buying. You can reduce what you do, what 
you consume, what you eat, and so on. These 
you control, and they should be your ﬁrst 
focus.
2. Lead by example. You must remember that 
others are people with their own beliefs and 

90
way of living — which you cannot control. 
However, you can inﬂuence them. And one 
of the best ways of inﬂuencing others is by 
example. Live a life of minimalism, and show 
how wonderful it can be. Show how easy — 
and actually fun — it can be to declutter. 
Show how happy you are. Share it all with 
those around you. Do it without trying to 
push it on them, because they will react 
negatively to being forced or nagged into 
doing anything.
3. Educate. Often people are against change 
because they don’t know enough about it. 
Combat this ignorance with non-pushy 
education. Talk with your loved ones about 
what you’re doing and why. Show them 
examples of people who inspire you. Send 
them links to mnmlism.com, Zen Habits and 
other blogs and magazines you enjoy — not 
as a hint, but as a way to share things you’re 
excited about. Over time, they’ll start to 
understand, and maybe even join you.
4. Ask for help. Your loved ones, most likely, 
care about you. They want you to be happy 
— but want to be happy themselves. Enlist 
your loved ones’ desire to make you happy 
… ask them for help. Say, “I need your help 
in getting to the minimalist life I want. Do 
you think you can help me?” Of course, if 
you’ve educated them, they already know 
what you want, but most people would love 
“You must be the change you 
want to see in the world.”
- Gandhi

91
to help you if they can. Don’t ask them to 
change, but ask if they can help you 
declutter, or keep a certain area uncluttered, 
or ﬁgure out a solution to a problem you’re 
facing.
5. Set boundaries. If you can’t get a loved 
one on board, it helps to set boundaries. For 
kids, ask them to keep their clutter to their 
rooms. Give them that personal space, and 
don’t bug them about it. For adults, you 
might designate certain rooms or areas as 
yours and others as theirs. I’ve known some 
people who’ve split rooms or entire homes in 
half — one side is uncluttered, and the other 
was … not.
6. Find compromises. Living with other 
people means ﬁnding ways of living that 
work for everyone. That might mean you 
need to give a little, if you want to ask them 
to give a little in return. Be willing to accept a 
less-than-perfect solution, if the solution will 
work for everyone.
7. Find acceptance. In the end, you might not 
win over the people who live with you — 
and you can either be frustrated or angry 
with that, or you can accept it. The second 
option is preferred, as you’ll have more peace 
of mind. It’s not easy, and will require you 
letting go of certain expectations, letting go of 
a need to control, and learning to love 
someone for who they are, not who you want 
them to be. But in the end, the effort will be 
worth it.

92
Minimalism
is the end of
organizing
The rise of clutter has given birth to a whole 
industry: organizing.
We now have legions of professional 
organizers, whole companies that sell 
organizing products such as closet 
organizers, magazines and blogs on how to 
get yourself organized, and of course, the 
hand-held notebooks we call organizers — 
and their digital equivalent, PDAs and 
mobile devices.
And while I have nothing against 
professional organizers — they help people 
to ﬁnd peace in lives of chaos — I don’t think 
they’re necessary … if you adopt 
minimalism.
Organizing is only necessary when you have 
too many things to easily ﬁnd what you’re 
looking for.
Think about it: when we organize a collection 
of books, it’s because when they’re not 
organized, we can’t ﬁnd the books we want. 
But if we had, say, ﬁve books, we wouldn’t 
need to organize.
The same applies to anything that needs to be 
organized:
 • 
Closets that have a minimal amount of 
things don’t need to be organized.

93
 • 
Tasks only need a complicated system 
or productivity apps for organizing if 
you have a lot to do. Focus on only 
doing a few important things, and you 
barely even need a list.
 • 
Finances only need organizing if 
they’re complicated. I’ll write about 
minimalist ﬁnances later.
 • 
Files only need to be organized if you 
can’t let go of this need to organize 
them. With search so powerful these 
days, you can ﬁnd things with a few 
keystrokes.
There are lots of other things that need to be 
organized, if they’re not kept as simple as 
possible. I’m sure you can think of a few 
yourself. Consider making them as 
minimalist as possible, and the organizing 
will fade away.
“The ability to simplify means 
to eliminate the unnecessary 
so that the necessary may 
speak.”
- Hans Hofmann

Step lightly
upon this world:
on sustainability
There’s a lot we can learn from traditional 
cultures such as the Native Americans. 
Including the idea of walking lightly upon 
this earth.
It’s something we’ve forgotten in hundreds 
of years of striving to achieve more, to 
produce more, to build bigger and better 
things.
We have forgotten to walk lightly, and 
instead mine the earth of its natural 
resources, clearcut forests, pollute rivers and 
lakes and oceans, alter the landscape to ﬁt 
our needs, make the air dirty and the rain 
acidic and the ozone holed.
This isn’t news. We’re all aware of the 
problems, but the solutions are less obvious.
Do I buy greener products? Do I buy a 
greener car? Do I recycle all the stuff I use?
Well, sure. You can do all of those things, and 
they are useful. But even better: live a life of 
less, and walk lighter.
A life of less means you consume less, use 
fewer natural resources, pollute less, own less 
stuff, contribute less to greenhouse 
emissions.
Minimalism, the philosophy of a life of less, 
is more sustainable because it uses less, and 

95
thus recycling isn’t as necessary (though it’s 
still important). It’s not sustainable to 
continue to consume huge amounts of 
products (no matter how green they are) or 
use natural resources (no matter how 
organic).
There’s a lot to write about here, and I’ll 
write more later, but a few brief examples:
 • 
Buy less stuff. Buying a lot of products 
is at the heart of this. Read more:Why 
less stuff is better; Consumerism vs. 
minimalism; Rethinking necessities.
 • 
Eat less. Americans as a group eat way 
too much. It’s not just about the huge 
amounts of natural resources that go 
into producing all of that food, 
although that’s huge (read about the 
rainforests being clearcut to make 
grazing room for McDonald’s beef 
cows, for example). It’s also about the 
huge wasteful restaurants, from 
McDonald’s to Chilis to Lone Star, 
serving ridiculous amounts of fat and 
salt and sugar laden food (and 
throwing much of it away), when we 
could simply eat at home. It’s about all 
the packaging that goes into all our 
frozen and processed food. It’s about 
the health problems that arise from 
eating so much unhealthy food, and 
“Walk lightly in the spring; 
Mother Earth is pregnant.”
- Native American (Kiowa) 
proverb

96
the wasted resources that go into 
caring for all our diseased people, too 
fat from all the eating.
 • 
Eat less meat. Meat is not sustainable. 
Most of the crops we grow go to 
feeding animals raised for food or 
dairy or eggs. If we stopped eating so 
much meat, we would use fewer 
resources and could feed more people.
 • 
Use less packaging. It’s insane how 
much packaging is used in all the 
products we buy. Unfortunately, there 
isn’t much choice when you want to 
buy something. Choose products with 
less packaging when you do have a 
choice. I think the public demanding 
less packaging will get manufacturers 
to change this wasteful practice.
 • 
Drive less. Walk more. Start cycling. 
Use mass transit. Carpool. Consolidate 
trips. Stay home sometimes.
 • 
Have a smaller house. Have less stuff, 
and you need less space. Big houses 
are wasteful, not only in the resources 
they take to build, but in cooling and 
heating and maintaining.
Again, just a few examples. It’s really a 
mindset, not a laundry list of things to do.

97
FAQs
Some frequently asked questions (FAQs) 
about minimalism and living the minimalist 
life, for those new to the concept.
Q: Why be a minimalist?
A: It’s a way to escape the excesses of the 
world around us — the excesses of 
consumerism, material possessions, clutter, 
having too much to do, too much debt, too 
many distractions, too much noise. But too 
little meaning. Minimalism is a way of 
eschewing the non-essential in order to focus 
on what’s truly important, what gives our 
lives meaning, what gives us joy and value.
Q: Isn’t minimalism boring or too sparse, 
with nothing in your life?
A: This is a misconception about minimalism 
— that it’s necessarily monk-like, empty, 
boring, sterile. Not at all. Well, it can be, if 
you go in that direction, but I don’t advocate 
that ﬂavor of minimalism. Instead, we are 
clearing away all but the most essential 
things — to make room for that which gives 
us the most joy. Clear away the distractions 
so we can create something incredible. Clear 
away all the obligations so we can spend 
time with loved ones. Clear away the noise so 
we can concentrate on inner peace, on 
spirituality (if we wish), on our thinking. As 
a result, there is more happiness, peace, and 
joy, because we’ve made room for these 
things.

98
Q: What is minimalist living?
A: It’s simply getting rid of things you do not 
use or need, leaving an uncluttered, simple 
environment and an uncluttered, simple life. 
It’s living without an obsession with material 
things or an obsession with doing everything 
and doing too much. It’s using simple tools, 
having a simple wardrobe, carrying little and 
living lightly.
Q: What are the beneﬁts of minimalism?
A: There are many. It’s lower in stress. It’s 
less expensive and less debt. It’s less cleaning 
and maintaining. It’s more enjoyable. There’s 
more room for creating, for loved ones, for 
peace, for doing the things that give you joy. 
There’s more time for getting healthy. It’s 
more sustainable. It’s easier to organize. 
These are only the start.
Q: What does the schedule of a minimalist 
look like?
A: There’s no single answer to this question, 
but a minimalist would probably focus on 
doing less, on having a less cluttered 
schedule, but what’s on his or her schedule 
would be important. A minimalist might not 
actually keep a schedule or calendar, at one 
extreme, if he didn’t have much to do each 
day — he might instead live and work 
“Simplicity, simplicity, 
simplicity! I say let your affairs 
be as one, two, three and to a 
hundred or a thousand… We 
are happy in proportion to the 
things we can do without.”
- Henry David Thoreau

99
moment-by-moment, or just decide each 
morning to focus on one or two important 
things.
A minimalist would also save a lot of time 
because of having less clutter and fewer 
possessions. That means less time cleaning 
and maintaining, and less time searching for 
things. A minimalist who clears away 
distractions and single-taskswould also 
waste less time with those distractions and in 
switching back and forth between tasks 
(multi-tasking).
In general, all this results in more time for 
relaxing, for hobbies, for creating, for doing 
fun things.
Q: What rules do I need to follow to become 
minimalist?
A: There are no set rules. There’s no one way. 
What I suggest for living minimally isn’t 
what someone else would recommend, nor is 
it how you would live your minimalist life. In 
general, however, you want to live simply 
without too many unnecessary possessions, 
distractions, clutter, or waste. You want to 
live frugally, debt-free, sustainably, naturally.
Q: Do you need to be vegan or vegetarian to 
be minimalist?
A: No. While I believe the vegan/vegetarian 
lifestyle is consistent with minimalism, you 
can eat simply as an omnivore as well. Again, 

100
there’s no one way. A minimalist would try to 
eat naturally, without too much processing, 
and not eat too much food (such as the 
ridiculous portions at most restaurants these 
days).
Q: Aren’t you being contradictory by 
claiming to be a minimalist and owning a 
Mac, or a house, or having six kids?
A: Again, there’s no one way. Everyone must 
ﬁnd his own path, and mine is different than 
what someone else would consider 
minimalist. Also, I have never claimed to be 
perfect — I’m striving for minimalism, but I 
always have room for improvement. I have 
things that are inconsistent with minimalism, 
or at least by the deﬁnition of others. I’m 
working on it.
I should say a word or two about having six 
kids and minimalism. Having six children is 
inconsistent with my message of simplifying, 
frugality, downsizing, being green.
I don’t have a defense … but I do have an 
explanation for the inconsistency. I had my 
kids before (and during) my change in 
philosophy. In fact, my philosophy is 
evolving even now, so I can’t claim to have 
believed in the things I believe in now, for a 
very long time. Many things I believe in are 
only recent developments.

101
As an example — only recently, I made the 
decision to transition back into veganism (I 
was vegan once, but have been lacto-ovo 
veggie for over a year). But I own a pair of 
leather sandals — do I throw them out? 
Wouldn’t that be wasteful? Is it better to be 
wasteful but consistent with my beliefs? It’s 
hard to say.
However, I have decided it would be most 
unethical for me to throw out my children, 
just because I now believe in downsizing.
As a result of my simplifying, I am able to 
enjoy my time with my children, and I have 
to admit, they are the best thing to happen to 
me. I don’t regret having them one bit, even 
if they are inconsistent with my philosophy 
of downsizing.
On the good side, I believe that even with six 
kids, being vegan, buying less stuff, being 
energy conscious, owning only one car and 
rarely driving it, walking more for 
transportation …. I actually use fewer 
resources than the average person in 
developed countries (and far less than the 
avg American) — this is according to online 
carbon footprint calculators. It’s not a 
justiﬁcation for having six kids, but just a 
note that things aren’t as bad as they could 
be.
“Simplicity is the final 
achievement. After one 
has played a vast quantity 
of notes and more notes, it 
is simplicity that emerges 
as the crowning reward of 
art.”
- Frederic Chopin
