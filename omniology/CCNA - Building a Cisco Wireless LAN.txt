Common Practice for
Subnetting TCP/IP
Address Space
This practice serves many
purposes:
■
It does not use regis-
tered IP space for wire-
less devices; which
typically do not include
servers.
■
It enables the organiza-
tion to subnet the
address space without
any restrictions.
■
It allows for easy iden-
tification of WLAN
traffic on the network
because it is not
sharing address space
with the wired net-
work.

Over the last 10 years, the impact of wireless communications on the way we live
and do business has been surpassed only by the impact of the Internet. Cellular
phones, pagers, and wireless personal digital assistants (PDAs) have become so com-
monplace in our lives that it is easy to forget that 10 years ago, they were a rarity. But
wireless communications technology is still in its infancy, and the next stage of its
development will be in supplementing or replacing the network infrastructure that
was traditionally “wired” as well as enabling network infrastructures that previously
could only be imagined. From local coffee shops to commercial inventory control
systems, within restaurants and throughout public airports, wireless commerce is
beginning to challenge the exchange system that our modern world currently
embraces, by accessing central pools of information and communicating directly
between users and between the devices themselves.
No longer are our choices restricted by the shortfalls of processing and battery
power, operating system efﬁciencies, or heat dissipation within the small footprint of
the mobile device. Rather, we are limited only by the practical application of these
technologies. How will we access information? How will we integrate multiple hard-
ware and software technologies into intelligent and useable form factors? Not all
business models necessarily imply the use of a single terminal to supply the user with
voice, video, and data services. Ergonomic factors may dictate that voice services are
maintained privately while data exchange and video information is easily viewable
from a speciﬁed distance, perhaps on complementary devices.
As network engineers, the challenges before us include the seamless distribution
of information between seemingly incompatible software and hardware standards. In
addition, we will be challenged by narrower bandwidths to develop highly efﬁcient
means of transport in order to fully leverage wireless technologies.
Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) technology is a reliable and convenient method of pro-
viding immediate, highly ﬂexible, and pedestrian-speed mobile data network access.

Preface
IEEE 802.11-based products offered by Cisco Systems have quickly become one of
the foundational technologies fostering the untethering of data communications in
the same way cordless telephony enhances local mobility for residential voice com-
munications.
Wi-Fi, however, is signiﬁcantly more complex than cordless telephony; loss, cov-
erage, and bandwidth requirements are much more stringent, not to mention that
direct sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS) is inherently more complicated than fre-
quency division multiple access (FDMA) and time division multiple access (TDMA).
More important, the proliferation of wireless LANs in corporate environments has
resulted in interesting security challenges.
Many organizations do not invoke IEEE security features. In addition, the current
IEEE 802.11 standard authentication techniques of using Service Set Identiﬁers
(SSID) and Media Access Control (MAC) addressing do not provide strong authenti-
cation.And although Wired Equivalent Protocol (WEP) combines access control, data
privacy, and data integrity using an underlying algorithm, it can also be broken via
passive monitoring with freely available monitoring software such as AirSnort.
Fortunately, Cisco offers enhanced capabilities to mitigate some weaknesses. Of
course, proper design and implementation are critically important; the design should
exclude direct wireless access point connectivity to the internal network, strong secu-
rity mechanisms must be implemented at different levels, and strict security policies
must be enforced.With 802.11b access speed ranging from 1 Mbps up to 11 Mbps,
and distances reaching from 500 feet indoors to as much as 5 kilometers outdoors, a
wireless LAN could offer an unwanted user powerful network access.
Connectivity, availability, and capacity issues are resolved with proper frequency
planning and testing. Security concerns are properly addressed with unobtrusive
testing, implementation of proper policies, and ﬁrewalls. Network addressing must
also be implemented consistently.
Callisma regularly assists customers with these considerations.This book will edu-
cate readers on some of the theory and practical information required to successfully
and safely deploy Wi-Fi.

Chapter 1 • Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networks
Introduction
Wireless local area networks (WLANs) can be employed to provide network
connectivity almost anywhere. Consider the cost savings from not having to run
network cable to every possible location that could have a computer or network
device connected to it. Consider the convenience of a wireless-enabled confer-
ence room. Imagine the increase in accuracy of a medical professional’s data
entered directly into a tablet computer during his rounds through the WLAN
instead of transcribed from a clipboard at a central workstation. Conference
rooms, warehouses, indoor and outdoor public access areas, and hospitals are all
suitable locations for WLANs. Unfettered access to the network, regardless of
physical location, or traditional cable distance limitations is one of the primary
drivers for WLANs.
Where can you ﬁt WLANs into your existing infrastructure? Just about any-
where you like.WLANs allow network designers to no longer be constrained by
the 100m distance limitation for Category 5 copper cabling. Because WLANs use
radio frequency (RF) signals to communicate, users can stay connected to the
network almost anywhere.
Many companies are merging WLANs into their traditional wired networks
to provide connectivity to the network to large numbers of users. Conference
rooms are a great place to start considering wireless in your network.The cost of
wiring a conference room and maintaining the hardware required to keep those
wired jacks “hot” can be prohibitive. Conference rooms are used for “chalk talk”
design sessions, application development sessions, and training. By using WLANs,
the need for multiple data jacks in a conference room can be eliminated.A single
antenna connected to a WLAN access point (AP) can support many users.
Warehouse applications are also prime candidates for WLAN. Real-time inven-
tory control can be implemented using wireless. Imagine having your inventory
control software connected to mobile devices on the warehouse ﬂoor tracking
inventory as it ﬂuctuates during the course of a day.WLANs can be a very impor-
tant business driver, enabling a company to gain a competitive advantage.
Hospital bedside access is also a popular application for WLANs.The ability
for a hospital staff member to check in a patient at bedside rather than waiting 
in line at an admissions desk is much more efﬁcient. Bedside access can also
enable a doctor to write a prescription or check medical records on a patient
instantaneously.
College campuses and some companies are also extending the network infra-
structure to public access areas both indoors and outside.This no longer restrains
www.syngress.com

the user to just her desk, or even in the building, to be productive. For the
growing mobile workforce, wireless provides the connectivity.
Reviewing Networking Basics
Before we delve into the topic of WLANs, we need to cover networking in gen-
eral.A network is deﬁned as a series of points or nodes interconnected by commu-
nication paths.The points or nodes may be devices dedicated to a single function,
such as a PC dedicated to client applications, or a router dedicated to intercon-
necting networks.This chapter covers some fundamental theories, technologies,
and applications for networks. LAN Technologies such as Ethernet, Fast Ethernet,
Gigabit Ethernet,Token Ring, and Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) are
prevalent in the networking industry today.
There are three primary types of networks, the local area network (LAN),
metropolitan area network (MAN), and the wide area network (WAN).The dis-
tinguishing feature of these networks is the spatial distance covered. LANs, as the
name implies, are typically contained in a single structure or small geographic
region. Groups of LANs interconnected may also be referred to as a campus in
larger environments. MANs connect points or nodes in a geographic region
larger than a LAN, but smaller than a WAN. Some of the same LAN technologies
may be employed in a MAN, such as Gigabit Ethernet.WANs are geographically
diverse networks and typically use technologies different from LANs or MANs.
WANs typically are comprised of high-speed circuits leased from a telecommuni-
cations provider to facilitate connectivity.WANs rarely use the same technologies
as LANs or MANs.Technologies such as Frame Relay, Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN), X.25,Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Digital Subscriber
Line (DSL) and others may be used.This is because of the larger distances WANs
service.
Deﬁning Topologies
Within the deﬁnition of a network, points or nodes are connected by communi-
cation paths.These paths may vary signiﬁcantly depending on the paths imple-
mented.We cover four primary topologies: bus, star, ring, and mesh. Each topology
has strengths and weaknesses, as well as different associated costs.A good network
design will take each topology into consideration to determine the best solution.

Chapter 1 • Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networks
NOTE
The word topology can refer to either the physical or logical layout of
the network. For example, an Ethernet network with a hub would have a
star topology, but the logical topology would be a bus.
Bus Topology
A bus topology is a linear LAN architecture in which transmissions from network
devices or stations propagate the entire length of the medium and are received by
all nodes on the medium.A common example of a bus topology is
Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 networks, as illustrated in Figure 1.1.
Star Topology
A star topology is a LAN architecture in which the devices or stations on a net-
work are connected to a central communications device, such as a hub or switch.
Logical bus and ring topologies are often physically implemented in star topolo-
gies. Figure 1.2 shows a typical star topology.
Ring Topology
A ring topology is a LAN architecture in which the devices or stations on a net-
work are connected to each other by unidirectional transmission links to form a
single closed loop. Common examples of ring topologies are Token Ring/IEEE
802.5 and FDDI networks, as illustrated in Figure 1.3.

Mesh Topology
A mesh topology is a LAN architecture is which every device or station on a
network is connected to every other device or station. Mesh topologies are
expensive to deploy and cumbersome to manage because the number of connec-
tions in the network can grow exponentially.The formula used to calculate the
number of connections in a fully meshed network is as follows:
(N x (N–1))/2
where N is the number of devices on the network. Divide the result by 2 to
avoid double counting the device A-to-device-B connection and the device

B-to-device-A connection.To illustrate the large numbers that a fully meshed
environment can reach, review the following examples:
■
A small network with 50 users wants to implement a fully meshed
topology.The number of connections required to do this would be 
(50 × (50–1))/2, which equals 1,225.That is a lot of connections for a
small LAN!
■
A medium network with 500 users wants to implement a fully meshed
topology.The number of connections required to do this would be 
(500 × (500–1))/2 which equals 124,750 connections!
Now for the reality check on fully meshed networks. Fully meshed networks
are typically implemented in a small handful of situations.The most common
deployment model for fully meshed networks would be in the WAN arena. Frame
Relay and ATM are technologies that are well suited for fully meshed networks
with high availability requirements. Figure 1.4 depicts a typical mesh network.
CSMA/CD versus Deterministic Access
In LANs, there are two predominant methods of controlling access to the physical
medium: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CMSA/CD)
and deterministic access. CSMA/CD is the access method for Ethernet.
CSMA/CD is best described as the same set of rules you would follow in a
meeting. In a meeting, everyone in the room has the right to speak, but everyone
follows the generally accepted rule of “Only one person can talk at one time.” If

you want to speak, you need to listen to see if anyone is else is speaking before you
begin. If someone else is speaking, you must wait until they are ﬁnished before you
can begin. If nobody is speaking, you can speak, but will continue to listen in case
someone else decides to speak at the same time. If they do, both speakers must stop
talking, wait a random amount of time, and start the process again. If a speaker fails
to observe the protocol of only one speaker at a time, the meeting will quickly lose
all effective communication. (Sounds too familiar, doesn’t it?)
In Ethernet, the multiple access (MA) is the terminology for many stations
connected to the same cable and having the opportunity to transmit. No device
or station on the cable has any priority over any other device or station.All
devices or stations on the cable do take turns communicating per the access algo-
rithm to ensure that one device on the LAN does not monopolize the media.
The CS (carrier sense) refers to the process of listening before speaking in an
Ethernet network.The carrier sense operation is performed by every device on
the network by looking for energy on the media, the electrical carrier. If a carrier
exists, the cable is in use, and the device must wait to transmit. Many Ethernet
devices maintain a deferral or back-off counter deﬁning the maximum number
of attempts the device will make to transmit on the cable. If the deferral counter
is exceeded, typically 15 attempts, the frame is discarded.
The CD (collision detect) in Ethernet refers to the capability of the devices
on the wire to know when a collision occurs. Collisions in Ethernet happen
when two devices transmit data at the same time on the cable. Collisions may be
caused by the cable distance being exceeded, a defective device, or a poorly
written driver that does not adhere to Ethernet speciﬁcations.When a collision is
detected, the participants generate a collision enforcement signal.The enforce-
ment signal lasts as long as the smallest Ethernet frame size, 64 bytes.This sizing
ensures that all stations know about the collision and do not attempt to transmit
during a collision event.After the collision enforcement signal has ﬁnished, the
medium is again open to communications via the carrier sense protocol.
Deterministic access is the protocol used to control access to the physical
medium in a token ring or FDDI network. Deterministic access means that a
control system is in place to ensure that each device on the network has an equal
opportunity to transmit.
Cabling
The physical infrastructure of a LAN is one of the most important components
of a network. If the physical medium that data is traversing is faulty or installed
incorrectly, network performance and operation will be impacted. It is analogous
www.syngress.com

Chapter 1 • Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networks
to the foundation of a building. Everything in the building is set upon the foun-
dation, typically strong reinforced concrete or other equally durable and reliable
building materials. If the foundation is not installed properly, everything built on
this foundation is suspect.A LAN is the same, a faulty foundation can be disas-
trous to a network.You can install all of the high-end gear, switches, routers,
servers, but if they don’t have the physical infrastructure to communicate effec-
tively, your network will fail.
There are two primary forms of physical medium a network will utilize:
copper and ﬁber. Between these two forms, there are sometimes many different
standards of cable. For example, copper may be shielded, unshielded, twisted,
untwisted, solid core, or braided core.We explore copper and ﬁber cable in more
detail to provide a solid understanding of the importance of cabling in your net-
work.You may be asking yourself “Why are we covering cabling in a book on
wireless?”That is a very good question.Wireless, as its name implies, does not use
physical cabling to provide communications to the wireless network. However, it
does use copper cabling to connect to your existing LAN. If your existing LAN
has out-of-spec or faulty cabling, your WLAN may not meet your expectations.
(Or more importantly, your boss’s expectations!)
The most common form of LAN cabling installed today is copper. Copper
has been the “preferred” installation since networks starting taking hold in the
corporate world in 1980 when Xerox developed Ethernet. Copper is relatively
cheap, easy to install, and can meet most distances that LANs were designed to
cover.The original Ethernet speciﬁcation used what is called thick coaxial cable.
This cable lived up to its name for sure! Thick coax is much bigger than the tra-
ditional copper cable you might be familiar with.After thick coax came thin
coax.Thin coax was a cheaper and easier to handle and install cable alternative.
Both of these cable types are implemented in a bus topology.As we covered ear-
lier, a bus topology is linear LAN architecture. Each device or station on a bus is
connected to the same medium. One of the major downsides to thick and thin
coax was that it created a single point of failure. If the bus were to experience a
failure or cut, the network became nonfunctioning.
With the advances made in copper technology, twisted pair cable became a
popular LAN medium.There are two main types of twisted pair cable: shielded and
unshielded. Shielded, as its name implies, contains smaller copper cables, twisted
among themselves with a shielded jacket around them. Shielded twisted pair allows
copper cable to be installed in facilities where there is signiﬁcant interference to the
electrical signals passed along the cable.The shielding—as well as the twisting of the
www.syngress.com

Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networks • Chapter 1

cables—plays a role in protecting the cable from this interference.Twisted pair
cables are less prone to interference than ﬂat, or nontwisted cables.
Among the twisted pair cabling family are a number of different levels of
cables.These are commonly referred to as categories, or CAT for short.The pri-
mary differences between the categories is the number of twists per foot in the
cable. More twists per foot equals less susceptibility to outside interference. Some
of the newer, higher categories of cabling also have internal dividers intertwined
with the copper cabling to further reduce interference.These higher standards
allow faster communications such as Fast Ethernet at 100 Mbps and Gigabit
Ethernet at 1000 Mbs over copper cabling.
Understanding How Wireless 
Fits into the OSI System Model
Wireless technology, as a networking component, is guided by the same standards
processes and organizations deﬁned for all other networking components in the
industry.Although working in the networking industry can be difﬁcult at best,
there are many components to a network that can either make or break the
system. In order to help standardize and deﬁne the areas a manufacturer must
build their equipment to service, the International Organization for Standard-
ization (ISO) created the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model.
This model is a seven-layer approach to data networking. Each layer encompasses
www.syngress.com
The Blame Game
When planning your WLAN implementation, you need to consider the
wired network and its physical plant. Connecting a WLAN to a wired net-
work with a questionable physical plant is a plan for trouble.
Troubleshooting connectivity to a new technology is difﬁcult enough
because the new technology is the ﬁrst to be blamed. On man occa-
sions, problems have been blamed on the wireless network when in fact
the wired network and the wiring itself was to blame. Approximately 60
percent of all network problems can be tracked to the physical layer.
Don’t let your wired network create havoc in your wireless network.

a speciﬁc set of tasks or standards that must be met in order for the network to
function.We’ll review each layer in greater detail because this is a very important
concept to understand.A comprehensive understanding of the OSI system model
is of paramount importance for the internetworking designer, installer, or support
team.
The seven layers to the OSI system model are as follows:
■
Physical layer
■
Data-link layer
■
Network layer
■
Transport layer
■
Session layer
■
Presentation layer
■
Application layer
We start at the bottom with the Physical layer.The Physical layer of the OSI
system model is responsible for deﬁning the electrical and mechanical aspects of
networking.Topics such as cabling and the methods for placing the 0’s and 1’s of
binary data on the medium are covered in great detail here. Standards such as
Category 5, RS-232, and coaxial cable fall within the realm of the Physical layer.
The next layer is the Data-link layer.The Data-link layer deﬁnes the protocols
that control the Physical layer. Issues such as how the medium is accessed and
shared, how devices or stations on the medium are addressed, and how data is
framed before transmission on the medium are deﬁned here. Common examples
of Data-link layer protocols are Ethernet,Token Ring, FDDI, and PPP.
Within the Data-link layer are two sublayers: the Media Access Control
(MAC) and Logical Link Control (LLC).These two sublayers each play an
important role in the operation of a network.We start with the MAC ﬁrst.The
MAC sublayer is responsible for uniquely identifying devices on the network.As
part of the standards of the OSI system model, when a network interface in a
router, switch, PC, server, or other device that connects to a LAN is created, a
globally unique 48-bit address is burned into the ROM of the interface.This
address must be unique or the network will not operate properly. Each manufac-
turer of network interfaces has been assigned a range of addresses from the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).The MAC sublayer is
considered the lower of the two sublayers and is also responsible for determining
the access method to the medium, such as token passing (Token Ring or FDDI)

or contention (CSMA/CD). Figure 1.5 shows an example of MAC addresses “on
the wire” after being passed from the MAC layer to the Physical layer and being
converted to 0’s and 1’s.
The next sublayer is the LLC layer.The LLC sublayer is responsible for han-
dling error control, ﬂow control, framing, and MAC sublayer addressing.The
most common LLC protocol is IEEE 802.2, which deﬁnes connectionless and
connection-oriented variants. IEEE 802.2 deﬁnes Service Access Points (SAPs)
through a ﬁeld in the Ethernet,Token Ring, or FDDI frame.Two SAPs are asso-
ciated with LLC: the Destination Service Access Point (DSAP) and the Source
Service Access Point (SSAP).These SAPs in conjunction with the MAC address
can uniquely identify the recipient of a frame.Typically LLC is used for protocols
such as SNA that do not have a corresponding network layer.
The next layer deﬁned by the OSI reference model is the Network layer.The
Network layer is responsible for addressing a network above the Data-link layer.
The Network layer is where protocols such as Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) and
AppleTalk tie into the grand scheme of things. Routing functions are also per-
formed at the Network layer.TCP/IP routing protocols such as Routing
Information Protocol (RIP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), and the Border
Gateway Protocol (BGP) operate at the Network layer.We focus more on
TCP/IP in the upcoming “Review of TCP/IP Basics” section.
The three previous layers we covered, Physical, Data-link, and Network, are
considered the lower level protocols in the OSI reference model.These are the
protocols that will more than likely consume the majority of your time as a

network engineer. However, that does not mean that the next four layers are not
important to the operation of a network.They are equally important, because
without the next four layers, your network doesn’t even need to be in existence.
The fourth layer of the OSI system model is the Transport layer.The
Transport layer deﬁnes the protocols that control the Network layer, similar to
the way the Data-link layer controls the Physical layer.The Transport layer speci-
ﬁes a higher level of ﬂow control, error detection, and correction. Protocols such
as TCP, User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX), and
Name Binding Protocol (NBP) operate at this layer.These protocols may be con-
nection-oriented, such as TCP and SPX, or connectionless, such as UDP.
The ﬁfth layer of the OSI system model is the Session layer.The Session layer
is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating communication sessions
between Presentation layer entities and the Transport layer, where needed.
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and Remote Procedure Call
(RPC) are examples of Session layer protocols.
The sixth layer of the OSI system model is the Presentation layer.The
Presentation layer is responsible for ensuring that data sent from the Application
layer of one device is comprehensible by the Application layer of another device.
IBM’s Network Basic Input Output System (NetBIOS) and Novell’s NetWare
Core Protocol (NCP) are examples of Presentation layer protocols.The ISO also
developed a Presentation layer protocol named Abstract Syntax Notation One
(ASN.1), which describes data types independent of various computer structures
and representation techniques.ASN.1 was at one time thought to be the
Presentation layer protocol of choice, when the ISO’s protocol stack was going to
sweep the networking industry. Now we know that some components of ISO,
such as Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) as a routing protocol,
and the X.500 directory services protocol have been widely deployed, while the
majority of the protocol stack has been neglected.
The seventh, and ﬁnal, layer of the OSI system model is the Application layer.
The Application layer is responsible for providing network services to applications
such as e-mail, word processing, and ﬁle transfer, which are not implicitly deﬁned
in the OSI system model.The Application layer allows developers of software
packages to not have to write networking routines into their program. Instead,
developers can utilize programming functions to the Application layer and rely
upon Layer 7 to provide the networking services they require. Some common
examples of Application layer protocols include Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
(SMTP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and Telnet.

Tracking Data through the OSI System Model
Understanding how data moves across an internetwork is a very important com-
ponent of being a network engineer.You need a comprehensive grasp of the
technologies and the standards they support, and you also need to know how
those technologies and standards relate to the actual network.The OSI system
model bridges that gap for you. Knowing the details of the network as well as 
the way end-user applications interact with the network is a powerful trouble-
shooting tool.
One of the easiest analogies used to understand the OSI system model is that
of sending a letter through the mail.A number of items must be completed for
your letter to be delivered to the appropriate recipient.We walk a letter through
the postal system and illustrate the parallel connections to the OSI system model.
The ﬁrst thing that you need to do to send a letter is to write it.You sit
down at your desk and write a letter to your friend that lives on the other side of
the country.After you ﬁnish writing the letter, you get an envelope and address it
to your friend.You then walk to your mailbox and place the letter inside.These
actions correlate to the OSI system model layers nicely.Writing the letter corre-
sponds roughly to the Application layer. If you used a word processor to write the
letter, then print it out to place in the envelope, the act of printing the letter
would be similar to what happens at the Application layer.The fact that you
printed the letter means that you relinquished control of the letter to the net-
work, the postal system in this case.Your actual words on the paper correspond to
the Presentation layer in that you needed to ensure that the recipient, your
friend, can read the letter.You presented your thoughts in a format your friend
can read and comprehend.Addressing the letter can correspond to the Session,
Transport, and Network layers. In networking terms, the steps of sealing the letter
in the envelope and addressing it relate to the actions of UDP in a TCP/IP net-
work.The data, your letter, was encapsulated in the envelope and passed down
through the OSI model to the Network layer where it was addressed.Without
the address, your letter cannot be delivered and the same principle applies to net-
working. Data cannot be delivered without an address. Placing the envelope in
the mailbox is comparable to what happens at the Data-link and Physical layers
of the OSI system model.The envelope was placed or encapsulated in the correct
format for delivery on the network where it will be transmitted to the recipient.
The mailbox maps to the Data-link layer and the postal carrier that picks up the
envelope would be the Physical layer, responsible for ensuring that the envelope is
delivered.

Chapter 1 • Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networks
Now that the envelope is in the network, the postal system, it may pass
through many different ofﬁces. If you view these ofﬁces as nodes on a network,
they would correspond to routers.The envelope reaches your local post ofﬁce, or
default gateway in a TCP/IP network, and is scanned by a computer to deter-
mine if the envelope requires routing for proper delivery. In this example, your
friend lives across the country, so the envelope does need to be routed.The com-
puters in the post ofﬁce review the destination address and determine the best
path for the envelope to take to reach its ﬁnal destination.The next ofﬁce, or
hop, on the path the envelope takes may be a regional ofﬁce or some other cen-
tral location with routes to the next hop.Your envelope is transported by mail
truck, plane, or other form of transportation.The actual path and transmission
medium are unimportant to you as you relinquished control of your letter when
you placed it in your mailbox.You are trusting that the postal service will ensure
that your letter arrives.
Your envelope ﬁnally reaches the local post ofﬁce for your friend.The enve-
lope is delivered to your friend and is opened.Your friend opens the envelope,
pulls out the letter, and reads it.These last steps correlate to the OSI system
model working in reverse.The data, your letter, is de-encapsulated when the
envelope is opened.The contents are then delivered to the recipient when your
friend reads the letter, a mapping to the Presentation layer, and comprehends
through the Application layer.
OSI and Wireless: Layer 2 and Down
Now that you have an understanding of the OSI system model, we can relate the
different technologies used in WLANs to the OSI system model.As the name wire-
less LAN implies, it is networking without wires.The wires you are accustomed to
using are replaced by radio signals.A number of various techniques are available for
sending data over radio signals—these are covered in greater detail in Chapter 2.
The standards covered by the Cisco WLAN products detailed in this book are
based on the IEEE’s 802.11 series.The 802.11 standards are responsible for deﬁning
the Physical and MAC layers of operation in a WLAN.The primary standard we
focus on in the 802.11b standard, which is an extension to the original 802.11
standard. 802.11b’s primary objective deﬁnes the use of the 2.4 GHz band in radio
frequency (RF) for high-speed data communications. 802.11b supports the original
802.11 data rate of 2 Mbps as well as higher speeds up to 11 Mbps.
The frames generated by a WLAN device differ from the frames generated by
an Ethernet device in many ways.WLANs are not physically connected by cables
like an Ethernet LAN, so new ﬁelds in the frames must be created to describe

aspects of the WLAN.We ﬁrst examine a typical 802.2 Ethernet frame and com-
pare it to a 802.11b frame.
An 802.2 Ethernet frame is comprised of six ﬁelds each with a speciﬁc func-
tion. Figure 1.6 illustrates an Ethernet frame.
■
Preamble The ﬁrst ﬁeld in an Ethernet frame is the preamble.The
preamble is an 8-byte long alternating pattern of 0’s and 1’s telling
receiving devices that a new frame is arriving.
■
Destination Address and Source Address The next ﬁelds are the
destination address (DA) and source address (SA).The ﬁelds are 2 or 6
bytes long and contain the MAC address of the source device on the
network and the destination address.The destination address may be a
single MAC address in the case of a unicast, a broadcast to all nodes on
the network, or a multicast to a group of nodes on the network.
■
Length The next ﬁeld is the length and is 2 bytes long describing the
number of bytes of data following this ﬁeld.
■
Data Unit The next ﬁeld is the data unit containing the user data of
the frame and is 46–1500 bytes long.This is where the data being
encapsulated into the frame is located; for example the graphic in a Web
page requested by your system.This ﬁeld will vary in length based on
the data encapsulated.
■
Frame Check Sequence The last ﬁeld in an Ethernet frame is the
Frame Check Sequence (FCS) ﬁeld and is 4 bytes long.The FCS is a
cyclic redundancy check (CRC) on the frame allowing the receiver of
the frame to perform basic error controls on the frame. If a frame fails
the CRC check, it is discarded and the upper layer protocol is typically
responsible for retransmission.

Chapter 1 • Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networks
A 802.11b frame (illustrated in Figure 1.7) is comprised of nine ﬁelds.
■
The ﬁrst ﬁeld in an 802.11b frame is the frame control (FC) ﬁeld and is 2
bytes long.The FC ﬁeld contains ten subﬁelds including protocol ver-
sion, type, subtype, to Distribution System (DS), from DS, more frag-
ments, retry, power management, more data,Wired Equivalent Protocol
(WEP), and order.These ﬁelds are some of the prime differentiators in
an 802.11b frame and are described in greater detail here:
■
Protocol Version The protocol version ﬁeld is the ﬁrst ﬁeld within
the frame control ﬁeld and is 2 bits long.The default value for this
ﬁeld is 0 with all other values being reserved at this time.
■
Type The type ﬁeld is 2 bits long and works in conjunction with
the 4-bit subtype ﬁeld to identify the function of the frame.The pos-
sible combinations and their descriptions are illustrated in Table 1.1.
■
To Distribution System The To DS ﬁeld is 1 bit long and is set
to 1 in all frames sent by an associated station with an AP to signify
that the frame is destined for the network behind the AP, such as a
server connected to the same Ethernet network as the AP.All other
frames have the To DS bit set to 0.
■
From Distribution System The From DS ﬁeld is 1 bit long and
is set to 1 on all frames exiting the DS.All other frames have the
From DS bit set to 0.
■
More Fragments The More Fragments (MF) ﬁeld is 1 bit long and
is set to 1 in all frames that contain another fragment of the current
MAC Service Data Unit (MSDU) or MAC Management Protocol
Data Unit (MMPDU).All other frames have the MF bit set to 0.

■
Retry The retry ﬁeld is 1 bit long and is set to 1 in all frames, data
or management, that are retransmissions of earlier frames. Frames that
are not retransmissions of a previous frame are set to 0.
■
Power Management The Power Management (PM) ﬁeld is 1 bit
long and is used to indicate the power management mode of a sta-
tion.The value is used to indicate the state in which the station will
be in after the successful completion of the frame exchange sequence.
A value of 1 is used to indicate that the station will be in power-save
mode, whereas 0 indicates that the station is in active mode.
NOTE
The PM ﬁeld in frames transmitted by a wireless Access Point will always
be set to 0, indicating active mode. It would not be desirable for an AP
on your network to go into power-save mode.
■
More Data The More Data ﬁeld (MD) is 1 bit long and used to
tell an associated station in power-save mode that one or more
frames are buffered for the station on the AP.The MD ﬁeld is set to
0 for all other directed frames.
■
WEP The WEP ﬁeld is 1 bit long and is set to 1 if the frame body
contains data that has been processed by the WEP algorithm. Frames
that have not been processed by WEP have a WEP ﬁeld value of 0.
■
Order The Order ﬁeld is 1 bit long and is set to 1 in any data
frame that contains data using the StrictlyOrdered service class.All
other frames have a value of 0 in the Order ﬁeld.
NOTE
The StrictlyOrdered service class is a mechanism built into the 802.11
standard that provides additional protection against out of order frames.
This is accomplished by holding any multicast or broadcast trafﬁc that
matches addresses for frames that are already queued. Without this
mechanism, it would be possible for broadcast or multicast trafﬁc to
reach a recipient out of order and create communications problems.

The next ﬁeld in an 802.11b frame is the Duration/ID ﬁeld and is 16
bits long. It is used to carry the association ID of a station with an
Access Point.
■
The next ﬁelds in the 802.11b frames are address ﬁelds. If you review an
Ethernet frame, you see that there are only two ﬁelds for addresses: desti-
nation and source. In 802.11b frames, there may be up to four, the basic
service set identiﬁer (BSSID), destination address (DA), source address
(SA), receiver address (RA), and transmitter address (TA).
■
The BSSID is the MAC address of the Access Point.
■
The DA is the MAC address of the ﬁnal recipient.
■
The SA is the MAC address of the sending station on the WLAN.
■
The RA is the MAC address of the intended immediate recipient
stations on the WLAN.
■
The TA is the MAC address of the sending station on the WLAN.
■
The next ﬁeld in an 802.11b frame is the frame body and is 0–2312 bytes
long.The frame body is the payload, or data contained within the frame.
This is where the data being encapsulated into the frame is located, for
example the graphic in a Web page requested by your system.This ﬁeld
will vary in length based on the data encapsulated.
■
The ﬁnal ﬁeld in the 802.11b frame format, just as in the Ethernet
format, is the FCS.
As you can see, there are a number of differences between Ethernet and
802.11b frames.These differences are required to enable high-speed communica-
tions on a physical medium of radio waves rather than standard copper or ﬁber
media.

Chapter 1 • Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networks
OSI and Wireless: Layer 3 and Up
The OSI system model applies to the conﬁguration, management, and trouble-
shooting of Cisco WLANs far beyond Layers 1 and 2. Certainly Layers 1 and 2
are key to WLANs, but the other layers play key roles as well. For example, all
conﬁguration of wireless APs and bridges are done through Telnet and HTTP,
two Application-layer protocols.The Web interface on APs and bridges use
HTTP in their graphical interfaces.This is a key topic to understand because if
there is a problem accessing the Web interface, you need to be able to use your
knowledge of the OSI system model to troubleshoot the problem. Could the
problem be caused by an access list on a router between your system and the AP,
is it a problem with general network connectivity, can you ping the AP’s TCP/IP
address? These all come into play in determining the cause of the failure.
Bridges and APs also use other protocols in the OSI system model. Examples
include the following:
■
Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) at Layer 7 to automati-
cally obtain a TCP/IP address on the network from a DHCP server.
■
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) at Layer 7 working with
RADIUS.
■
Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) at Layer 7 in
conjunction with EAP to authenticate WLAN users.
■
WEP at Layer 2 to encrypt/decrypt data on the WLAN.
Review of TCP/IP Basics
TCP/IP is one of the most widely deployed protocols on networks today.
TCP/IP can be looked upon as the great network communication uniﬁer. Prior
to the wide adoption of TCP/IP as the protocol of choice, many disparate and
proprietary protocols existed. IPX, Local Area Transport (LAT), and AppleTalk
each provided connectivity to their respective operating systems.There was no
common protocol to facilitate communications between the different operating
systems.Awkward protocol gateway systems were implemented to “covert” com-
munications between the networks.TCP/IP had actually been around since the
1980s, but few vendors felt it was important or dominant enough to implement
in their products. Now, looking back, it is almost hard to imagine networking
without TCP/IP to provide intersystem connectivity.
www.syngress.com

Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networks • Chapter 1
21
TCP/IP was originally implemented as a standard protocol for the pre-
ﬂedging Internet called ARPANET for the United States government Advanced
Research Projects Agency, which funded the network.As the ARPANET grew,
the need to have a standardized protocol became apparent. IP as a protocol was
deﬁned in Request for Comments (RFC) 760 in 1980;TCP was deﬁned in
RFC 793 in 1981.TCP/IP comprises a suite of protocols.This means that many
different protocols fall under the umbrella of TCP/IP.
A few of the more common TCP/IP protocols include HTTP, File Transfer
Protocol (FTP), SMTP, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), and Post
Ofﬁce Protocol (POP). Each of these protocols uses IP as their base foundation
for moving data on a network. Looking at TCP/IP from the perspective of the
OSI system model can be very beneﬁcial to understand how the protocols inter-
relate. For example, SMTP, a messaging protocol is deﬁned as an Application layer
protocol, and as such, resides at Layer 7 of the OSI system model. SMTP relies on
TCP at the Transport layer to establish a reliable connection to a remote system.
TCP in turn relies on IP to provide addressing information and routing capabili-
ties to ensure that the data is sent to the proper destination.We cover TCP in
more depth later in the chapter.
Understanding TCP/IP Addressing
As with any Network layer protocol, addressing is a key component;TCP/IP is
no different. Devices on the network require a unique address to identify them-
selves as well as other nodes on the network to establish communications.The
addressing in TCP/IP is comprised of a 32-bit value, represented by four groups
of decimal addresses separated by periods for ease of classiﬁcation.The decimal
numbers represent binary numbers, 0’s and 1’s, in a format that is much easier for
humans to comprehend and remember. For example, the TCP/IP address of
192.168.149.234 is a representation for 11000000.10101000.10010101.11101010.
Which number would you rather remember? Furthermore, any IP address can be
divided into two portions: the network number and the host number.The net-
work number may be a valid Internet assigned network or may be part of a pri-
vate TCP/IP addressing scheme. Because there are a limited number of TCP/IP
addresses available in the world, the Internet community created RFC 1918,
which allocates address space in the three primary classes of address space for 
private organizations to utilize for their internal networks.
www.syngress.com

22
Chapter 1 • Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networks
IP addresses are divided into ﬁve distinct classes, with three of the classes
being predominant.The classes are labeled by the alphabet, so the classes are A, B,
C, D, and E. Figure 1.8 illustrates the different classes.
As you can see, each class of address allows for a varying number of hosts. For
example, in each class A address, there is the possibility of 16,777,214 hosts, while
a class C address has the possibility of 254 hosts.The class of address employed in
an organization usually depends on the number of devices to be addressed.
To determine the class of address you are dealing with, there are two primary
mechanisms. One, the simplest, is memorization; the other is to examine the high
order, or ﬁrst bits of the IP address.The high-order bits will always dictate the
class of address space used without fail, whereas memorization is susceptible to
human error. In Figure 1.9, you can see the high-order bits and the number of
addresses possible per class.
One of the more difﬁcult tasks for a TCP/IP network administrator is that of
subnetting.TCP/IP addresses can be broken down into smaller networks called
subnets. Subnetting can be very beneﬁcial because it allows for effective address
allocation and broadcast domain control. Subnets are created by the network

administrator and can be concealed by address summarization for efﬁcient com-
munications to the outside world, or to maintain stability in the network.
Subnetting is accomplished by borrowing bits from the host portion of the
TCP/IP address and designating them as subnet mask bits. Every IP address has a
subnet mask.The subnet mask has the same format as an IP address in that it is a
32-bit value represented by four groups of decimal addresses separated by
periods. However, subnet masks contain all binary 1’s in the ﬁelds signifying the
network address and binary 0’s in the ﬁelds signifying the host address.There are
two main ﬂavors of subnet masks: classful and classless. Classful, as their name
implies, are based on the class of IP address. For example, a Class B network of
172.16.0.0 using a classful subnet mask would have a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0.
The 255.255 portion of the subnet mask signiﬁes the network portion; the 0.0
signiﬁes the host portion of the address.TCP/IP protocol stacks perform a logical
AND on the IP address and subnet mask to determine the broadcast and net-
work address for a given address.

Chapter 1 • Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networks
Classful subnet masks are easy to remember as they follow the class of address
being used.Things get a bit more complicated with classless subnet masking.
Classless subnet masking takes place when the subnet mask is anything other than
the natural classful subnet mask. Back to the example of the 172.16.0.0 network:
If you apply a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, you are breaking the larger net-
work, 172.16.0.0, into a smaller network, 172.16.0.0 with a class C mask,
meaning that you will have only 254 addresses on the network.A result of the
logical AND done using the 172.16.0.0 with the 255.255.255.0 mask is illus-
trated in Figure 1.10.

Common Practice for 
Subnetting TCP/IP Address Space
A common practice in many organizations is to assign TCP/IP address
space from RFC 1918. This practice serves many purposes:
■It does not use registered IP space for wireless devices; which
typically do not include servers.
■It enables the organization to subnet the address space
without any restrictions.
■It allows for easy identiﬁcation of WLAN trafﬁc on the net-

the 1 further right from the original high-order bit placement.There are ﬁxed
values for subnet masks because you are restricted to having the high-order bits

TCP
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the protocols in the TCP/IP pro-
tocol suite.TCP is a Layer four,Transport layer protocol that is responsible for
establishing and maintaining reliable communications in a TCP/IP network.TCP
also provides stream data transfer, efﬁcient ﬂow control, multiplexing, full-duplex
communication, and reliability on the network at Layer four.
TCP is considered a reliable protocol in that every packet sent between nodes
on a network is acknowledged before the next packet is sent.This might sound
like high overhead to you—it is.TCP was developed to be used on networks that
were less reliable than the networks we are used to working with in 2002.To
accommodate for less reliable communication,TCP utilizes ﬂow control and
sequencing to ensure proper data ﬂow.
As networks have stabilized,TCP has remained and is still in wide use today.
On most IP networks,TCP is the most prevalent protocol because so many
applications use TCP. Some of the more common applications include SMTP,
FTP, HTTP, and Telnet.

UDP
UDP is one of the protocols in the TCP/IP protocol suite. UDP is a Layer four,
Transport layer protocol that is used for applications that are not considered mis-
sion-critical, require low overhead, or are streamlined for speed. Unlike TCP,
UDP is not considered a reliable protocol. Rather UDP attempts to send packets
on a “best-effort” service. It is connectionless and as such does not have the same
overhead as TCP.
Some of the more common applications include SNMP, Network Time
Protocol (NTP), Domain Name Service (DNS), and some Voice over IP (VoIP)
implementations.

Summary
In this chapter, you have formed a solid foundation in basic networking to delve
more deeply into WLANs.The chapter has reviewed some basics of networking
including deﬁning bus, star, ring, and mesh topologies.The most common
deployment model for fully meshed networks would be in the WAN arena.
Two of the different access methods networks use include Carrier Sense
Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) and deterministic access.
The OSI system model plays an important role in developing networking
standards.The model is comprised of seven layers:
■
Physical layer
■
Data-link layer
■
Network layer
■
Transport layer
■
Session layer
■
Presentation layer
■
Application layer
The Physical layer of the OSI system model is responsible for deﬁning the elec-
trical and mechanical aspects of networking.The Data-link layer deﬁnes the proto-
cols that control the Physical layer, determining such issues as how the medium is
accessed and shared, how devices or stations on the medium are addressed and how
data is framed before transmission on the medium.The Network layer is where
protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) are
addressed, as well as where routing functions are performed.The Transport layer
speciﬁes a higher level of ﬂow control, error detection, and correction.The Session
layer is responsible for establishing, managing and terminating communication ses-
sions between Presentation layer entities and the Transport layer.The Presentation
layer is responsible for ensuring that data sent from the Application layer of one
device is comprehensible by the Application layer of another device.The
Application layer is responsible for providing network services to applications such
as e-mail, word processing, and ﬁle transfer that are not implicitly deﬁned in the
OSI system model.
After the OSI review, we applied the OSI system model to WLANs and dis-
cussed the frame format the MAC layer uses in the 802.11 standard.We com-
pared the familiar Ethernet frame format with a 802.11 frame to reveal

Chapter 1 • Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networks
differences such as the Frame Control (FC) ﬁeld as well as the four address ﬁelds.
Moving up the OSI system model, we touched on how the other ﬁve layers of
the OSI system model apply to WLANs.
Next, we covered some basics with TCP/IP including addressing and subnet-
ting.There are ﬁve classes of TCP/IP addresses with classes A, B, and C being the
predominant addresses. Class D addresses are reserved for multicast, and class E
address space is reserved for future use by the IETF.Within the classes of
addresses, you can more effectively utilize the address space by subnetting.We
covered the seven basic subnet mask values that you will encounter in the real
world as well.
Finally, we wrapped up the chapter with a quick review of TCP and UDP as
part of the TCP/IP protocol suite.TCP is the reliable protocol with ﬂow control
and connection-oriented applications such as HTTP, FTP, and Telnet. UDP is
considered “unreliable” and makes a best effort to deliver data. Many applications
use UDP such as SNMP, NTP, and DNS.

Q: Does a wireless network require a wired network to work properly?
A: A wireless network does not require a wired network to operate, according to
the standards. However, if you require devices on your wireless network to
communicate with devices on the wired network, the WLAN must connect
to the wired network at some point.
Q: Why would I want to subnet my address space?
A: Subnetting can be a very tricky proposition, from both a technical aspect as
well as an operational aspect. Some organizations are interested in wasting as
little address space as possible and therefore subnet. Other organizations may
or may not subnet for political reasons. It is up to the individual organization
to determine their subnetting policy.

Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
Introduction
The primary advantage of wireless local area networks (WLANs) is their ability
to communicate to the wired network or to other WLAN devices. Integrating
both wired network and wireless LAN technologies into a single device allows
you to have the best of both worlds. In addition to the radio technologies
enabling WLANs, other technologies are employed to provide security, efﬁciency,
and stability of the WLAN. Because WLAN radio devices use various aspects of
radio technology, we ﬁrst review radio frequency (RF) fundamentals.We deﬁne
and explain the various RF apparatus as it pertains to the functionality of
WLANs.This chapter provides an overview of WLANs to provide a knowledge
base for more detailed wireless networking topics.We provide information con-
cerning the underlying concepts and technologies used in wireless systems in
order to enhance your ability to design, implement, and troubleshoot the various
processes of a wireless system.You will be given the practical information neces-
sary to understand the functionality of any WLAN radio device to include Cisco
Aironet products. Because this subject matter represents such a broad range of
topics and technologies, discussing them all in the course of one chapter is difﬁ-
cult at best. Instead, we give focus to the fundamentals and standards as they
directly relate to WLANs. Next, we discuss current wireless technologies and the
advantages and disadvantages of various wireless technology implementations,
with greater attention given to the technology used by Cisco Aironet devices.
Finally, we turn our attention to standards with respect to wireless standards from
the major standards organizations worldwide. In doing so, we examine where
wireless radio devices ﬁt into the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) reference model.
Understanding the 
Fundamentals of Radio Frequency
A fundamental understanding of RF is necessary in order to fully understand the
world of wireless networking. RF in wireless communications is typically used to
describe devices or equipment that use radio waves to transmit images and
sounds from one transmission point to one or more reception points. In com-
puter networking, RF is used to describe network devices (access points [APs],
bridges, and so on.) that use radio waves to transmit or receive data instead of
using traditional wired data cabling or telephone lines.Wireless systems utilize
components of radio technology to prepare, transmit, and receive the digital data

used in WLANs. In the next few sections, we provide a brief history of radio, the
RF concepts and terms used, and their place in the technology of WLANs.
It has taken the work of some of the best minds in science history to produce
what is known today as radio. In 1886, Heinrich Hertz developed a device called
a spark gap coil, for generating and detecting electromagnetic waves.This spark
gap coil would not have been possible if it were not for the mathematical theory
of electromagnetic waves formulated by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell
in 1865. In 1895, Guglielmo Marconi, recognizing the possibility of using these
electromagnetic waves for a wireless communication system, gave a demonstra-
tion of the ﬁrst wireless telegraph, using Hertz’s spark coil as a transmitter, and a
radio detector called a “coherer,” which was developed by a scientist by the name
of Edouard Branly, as the ﬁrst radio receiver.The effective operating distance of
this system increased as the equipment was improved, and in 1901, Marconi suc-
ceeded in sending the letter “S” across the Atlantic Ocean using Samuel Morse’s
dot-dash communication coding technique, commonly referred to today as
Morse code.The ﬁrst vacuum electron tube capable of detecting radio waves
electronically was invented (by Sir John Fleming) in 1904.Two years later, Lee de
Forest invented a type of triode (a three-element vacuum tube) called an audion,
which not only detected radio waves but also ampliﬁed them.
The beginning of RF, in terms of the transmission of music and speech,
began in 1906 with the work of Reginald Fessiden and Ernst F.W.Alexanderson.
However, it was not until 1913 when Edwin H.Armstrong patented the circuit
for the regenerative receiver that long-range radio reception became a practical
reality.The major developments in radio initially were for ship-to-shore commu-
nications. Following the 1920 establishment of station KDKA as the ﬁrst com-
mercial broadcasting station in the United States (located in Pittsburgh, PA),
technical improvements in the industry increased, as did radio’s popularity.
Particularly in the United States, the radio receiver became so popular that it
could be found in nearly every home. Since the early days of radio, countless
improvements and research has brought us such applications as television, radar,
wireless phones, and eventually wireless radio devices for LANs.
In order to understand the concepts that are detailed here, we must start with
a common frame of reference.We use a common transmission and reception
example to look at the RF communication process in a simpliﬁed manner and
then drill down into each part of the process.We start with a common analogy
that most of you can relate to, your car radio communication process.
In order for you to listen to music from your car radio, a speciﬁc transmission
and reception process must take place. Initially, the radio station impresses

(encodes) some information, like voice or speech, on a radio wave.This informa-
tion encoding on a radio wave is known as modulation.The radio station broad-
casts this radio wave with the encoded data (music) on a certain frequency from a
large antenna.Your car radio antenna picks up the broadcast based on the fre-
quency to which your radio dial is tuned.Your car radio then decodes the music
from the radio wave and plays that information through the speakers as sound.
See Figure 2.1.
Wireless Radio Signal 
Transmission and Reception
Radio frequency (RF) is a speciﬁc type of electric current known as alternating
current (AC) that generates an electromagnetic (EM) ﬁeld when applied to an
antenna.The resulting electromagnetic ﬁeld (sometimes called an RF ﬁeld) and
subsequent electromagnetic radiation is then used for wireless broadcasting
and/or communications.When an electric current ﬂows through a wire, a mag-
netic ﬁeld is generated around the wire.When alternating current ﬂows through
a wire, the magnetic ﬁeld alternately expands and collapses.This expansion and
collapse is a result of the electrical current reversing its direction. In the United
States,AC reverses direction or alternates at a frequency of 60 Hertz (Hz), or 60
cycles per second. In South America and Europe,AC typically alternates at a fre-
quency of 50 Hz or 50 cycles per second.This is one reason why electrical
devices, such as hair dryers and shavers, require special converters in order to
work properly outside North America. Conventional AC power is produced by

rotating machines, called alternators, that produce a smooth alternation, like that
of a pendulum.This alternating current and subsequent frequency changes are
described mathematically as a “sine wave” (see Figure 2.2). It is the ideal wave-
form for the transfer of AC power and consequently radio transmission.
As you have seen in the car radio analogy, a radio wave is broadcast from the
radio station antenna.To broadcast the radio wave,AC is applied to the antenna,
giving rise to an electromagnetic ﬁeld that moves and spreads through space, like
the ripples caused by dropping a pebble into a pond.When we say electromagnetic
ﬁeld, you need to make the distinction between ﬁeld and radiation.A ﬁeld is a
physics term for an area of space or region that is under the inﬂuence of some
force that can act on matter within the area or region.A good example of this is
a comet passing close to Earth:The gravitational ﬁeld produced by Earth attracts
the comet and therefore inﬂuences the comet’s trajectory. In the car radio
example, the radio transmitter and antenna generate a moving electric charge.
Nonmoving or static electric charges produce electric ﬁelds around them.
Moving electric charges produce both electric and magnetic ﬁelds, or an electro-
magnetic ﬁeld.An electromagnetic ﬁeld is generated when charged particles, such
as electrons, are accelerated. Electric ﬁelds surround all electrically charged parti-
cles.When these charged particles are in motion, they produce magnetic ﬁelds.
When the speed of the charged particle changes, an electromagnetic ﬁeld is pro-
duced. In the 19th century, scientists discovered that arcs or sparks of electrical
energy (in the form of an electromagnetic ﬁeld) could travel between two per-
pendicular conductive rods without the aid of wires between them.They learned
to reproduce this effect over varying distances and led them to believe that it was
possible to communicate wirelessly over long distances.These electric arcs were
used in the ﬁrst radio transmitters.

Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
As you have seen, electrically charged particles in motion produce electro-
magnetic ﬁelds.When the motion of these charged particles regularly repeats or
changes, they produce what we call electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radia-
tion moves energy from one point to another.This is somewhat like a small ball
moving the same way over and over, against the inside of a larger ball causing the
larger ball to move in a certain direction.The larger ball represents the electro-
magnetic radiation and the smaller ball inside the larger ball represents an electri-
cally charged particle in motion. Radio waves are not the only form of
electromagnetic radiation. Light is also electromagnetic radiation, and both radio
waves and light have many similarities.The most signiﬁcant of these similarities,
for our purposes, is the speed at which both travel. Both are moving through
space in approximately straight lines at a speed of about 299,792 km per second
or 186,000 miles per second. In other words, a radio wave as electromagnetic
radiation travels at the speed of light.
As the distance from the energy source of electromagnetic radiation increases,
the area over which the electromagnetic radiation is spread is increased, so that
the available energy from the electromagnetic radiation in a given area is
decreased. Radio signal intensity (amplitude), like light intensity, decreases as the
distance from the source increases.The signal gets weaker as you move farther
away from the source of the transmission.A transmitting antenna is a device that
projects electromagnetic radiation, as RF energy, into space by a transmitter (the
electromagnetic radiation energy source).The antenna can be designed to con-
centrate the RF energy into a beam and increase its effectiveness in a given
direction.
Radio is commonly used for the transmission of voice, music, and pictures, as
in broadcast radio and television.The sounds and images used in radio and televi-
sion are converted into electrical signals by some input device such as a micro-
phone or video camera, ampliﬁed, and used to encode (modulate) a carrier wave
that has been generated by an oscillator circuit (a circuit used to produce alter-
nating current) in a transmitter.A carrier wave is the form of the radio wave
prior to modulation or transmission.The modulated carrier wave is also ampliﬁed
and then applied to an antenna that converts the electrical signals to electromag-
netic waves for radiation into space. Electromagnetic waves are transmitted by line
of sight and by deﬂection from a speciﬁc layer of the upper atmosphere, called
the ionosphere.This is the layer of the upper atmosphere that ranges from
approximately 30 to 250 miles high. Ionization of nitrogen and oxygen molecules
from ultraviolet radiation and X-rays from the sun produces a layer of charged
particles, which allows radio waves to be reﬂected around the world.

Receiving antennas do not actively search for a radio wave from any source.
The electromagnetic radiation from the originating antenna passes across the pas-
sive, receiving antenna. Receiving antennas intercept part of this electromagnetic
radiation and change it back to the form of an electrical signal.The receiving
antennas then feed this signal to a receiver, which in turn, takes the incoming sig-
nals mixed with a signal from a local oscillator in the receiver, to produce inter-
mediate frequencies that are equal to the mathematical sum and difference of the
incoming and local frequencies. In other words, the oscillator acts as a type of
ﬁlter to weed out all frequencies other than the intended frequency.The oscil-
lator then sends this intended frequency through an ampliﬁer. Because the ampli-
ﬁer operates at the previously determined intermediate frequency (a single
frequency), it is designed for optimum selectivity and gain.The tuning control on
a radio receiver adjusts the local oscillator frequency. In order for the receiver to
amplify the signal and feed it to circuits that demodulate it to separate the signal
wave from the carrier wave, the incoming signals must be above the threshold of
sensitivity of the receiver and tuned to the frequency of the signal.
Some radio devices act as both transmitter and receiver for radio signals.
These devices are known as transceivers.When a responding signal is sent back to
the originating radio, the radio transceiver changes modes from reception to
transmission and back again. Cisco Aironet Access Points and bridges, as
transceivers, have this characteristic.Transceivers change modes from transmission
to reception over and over again.They will do this many thousands of times per
second.Though transceivers allow you to transmit and receive with the same
device, thus reducing the size and cost of radios; in wireless networking, this
capability introduces latency, a delay in communications. It is idiosyncratic to
radio communications and negatively affects data throughput, albeit minimally.
Frequency
AC is the type of electric current generally used to produce electromagnetic
ﬁelds.As you have seen (in Figure 2.2),AC alternates, or cycles over time.This
cycling over a period of time is referred to as amplitude.The amplitude oscillates
from zero to some maximum and back again.The number of times the cycle is
repeated in one second is called the frequency.AC frequencies can range from a
single cycle in thousands of years to quadrillions of cycles per second. Remember
Heinrich Hertz, he is the one who invented the spark coil for generating and
detecting radio waves.The unit of measurement for frequency is called a Hertz,
after Heinrich. In fact, radio waves were originally called Hertzian waves.A Hertz
www.syngress.com

38
Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
is usually deﬁned as one cycle per second, or one wave per second.The fre-
quency unit or Hertz is normally abbreviated Hz. Because frequencies can be
very large, the standard units of quantities used in science and commonly seen in
the data world are used to annotate them. For example, 1000 Hz equals 1 KHz
(kilohertz), 1000 KHz equals 1 MHz (megahertz), 1000 MHz equals 1 GHz
(gigahertz), and so on.
At any given instance, a radio wave will have an amplitude variation similar to
that of its time variation. Picture the waves produced by a pebble dropped into a
still pond. One of the waves traveling on the pond represents a radio wave, the
height of that wave represents the amplitude and the speed at which that wave
travels represents the time variation.The distance from the top of one wave to
the next is known as the wavelength.The frequency of an electromagnetic ﬁeld
(RF ﬁeld) is directly related to its wavelength. By specifying the frequency of a
radio wave (f) in megahertz and the wavelength (w) in meters, the two are inter-
related mathematically, according to the following formula:
w = 300/f
In the car radio example, the radio is tuned to 96.3 MHz.This is the signal
frequency of the radio station transmitter we want to “listen to.”At 96.3 MHz,
the signal has a wavelength of about 3 meters, or about 10 feet.This same for-
mula applies if the wavelength is speciﬁed in millimeters (mm) and the frequency
is given in gigahertz.Therefore a Cisco Aironet AP that transmits a signal at 2.4
GHz would have an approximate wavelength of 120 mm, or a little less than 5
inches. Remember, all radio waves travel at the speed of light, so a radio wave
with a shorter wavelength will cross a speciﬁc point in space (like an antenna)
more times than a radio wave with a long wavelength.
In general, as the frequency of a radio gets higher the corresponding wave-
length of the electromagnetic ﬁeld gets shorter.At 9 KHz, the free space wave-
length is approximately 33 kilometers (km) or 21 miles (mi).At the highest radio
frequencies, the electromagnetic wavelengths measure approximately one mil-
limeter (1 mm).As the frequency is increased beyond that of the RF spectrum,
electromagnetic energy takes the form of various types of light and energy such
as infrared light (IR), visible light, ultraviolet light (UV), X-rays, and gamma rays.
Electromagnetic radiation, as radio waves, can be generated and used at fre-
quencies higher than 10 KHz.A considerable segment of the electromagnetic
radiation spectrum is available for use, extending from about 9 KHz, the lowest
allocated wireless communications frequency, to thousands of gigahertz, with the
upper ends of the frequency spectrum consisting of gamma and cosmic rays.

Many types of wireless devices make use of radio waves. Radio and television
broadcast stations, cordless and cellular telephone, two-way radio systems and
satellite communications are but a few. Other wireless devices make use of the
visible light and infrared portions of the frequency spectrum.These areas of the
spectrum have electromagnetic wavelengths that are shorter than those in RF
ﬁelds. Examples include most television remote controls, some cordless computer
keyboards and mice, and many laptop computers.Table 2.1 depicts the eight

Bandwidth
Traditionally, bandwidth is the amount of information that can be carried
through a phone line, cable line, satellite feed, and so on.The greater the band-
width, the greater the speed of your connection and the more your Internet
experience approaches a more instant-download,TV-style experience.
Bandwidth, in the computer world, is deﬁned as how much data you can
send through a connection usually measured in bits per second.A full page of
English text is about 16,000 bits And a fast modem can move about 15,000 bits
in one second. Full-motion full-screen video would require roughly 10,000,000
bits per second, depending on compression.
In the radio world, bandwidth is deﬁned in a little more complicated manner.
Bandwidth is the difference between limiting frequencies within which perfor-
mance of a radio device, in respect to some characteristic, falls within speciﬁed
limits or the difference between the limiting frequencies of a continuous fre-
quency band. In the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency-band, which is used in Cisco

Aironet products, the band begins at 2.4 GHz and ends at 2.4835 GHz.The dif-
ference between the beginning point and the end point is the bandwidth.
Therefore the total available bandwidth available for use by wireless devices in
this band is .0835 GHz or 83.5 MHz.
WLAN Frequency Bands
In order to prevent interference from radio signals in the United States, the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is charged with assigning small sec-
tions of the RF spectrum for speciﬁc uses called licensed frequencies. In order to
broadcast radio signals at these frequencies you must apply to the FCC for a
license.The FCC allocated separate bands of radio frequencies as public bands,
allowing use of some of the radio spectrum for devices that would not require a
license. No license is required to use equipment transmitting at these frequencies.
These are called the ISM bands, short for industrial, scientiﬁc, and medical bands.
There are three unlicensed bands within the industrial, scientiﬁc, and medical
frequency range.They are the 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 5.8 GHz frequencies (see
Figure 2.3). Cisco Aironet products currently use the 2.4 GHz frequency range,
which adheres to the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)
802.11b standard. Recently, the FCC also opened up the 5.2 GHz band, known
as the UNII (Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure) bands, for unli-
censed use by high-speed data communications devices. 5.2 GHz is the same
band that is used for the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ETSI
HiperLAN speciﬁcation in Europe.

Of signiﬁcant importance is the total number of channels allocated in a given
geographical area.The same IEEE 802.11 standard can be more versatile in areas
where additional channels (bandwidth) are allocated.The advantage is due to the
greater number of channels that can be potentially deployed. By allowing more
channels to be deployed in a given area, the possibility of interference from other
wireless devices is reduced or eliminated.
Modulation
An example of how modulation beneﬁts us is the advances in modem tech-
nology over the years.The ﬁrst modems communicated at 300 baud. Changes in
modulation schemes allowed modem speeds to increase even though the physical
medium (phone lines) did not change. 56K modems are today’s current standard.
They obtain much higher speeds over the same channel as the earlier modems.
This increase in speed is due to utilizing more complex modulation techniques.
For the propagation and interception of radio waves, a transmitter and
receiver are employed.A radio wave “carries” information-bearing signals through

space, this carrier wave may have information encoded directly on it by periodi-
cally interrupting its transmission, as in Morse code telegraphy, or encoded on it
by what is known as a modulation technique.
The actual information in a modulated signal is contained in its sidebands, or
frequency components added to the carrier wave. It is important to note that the
information is not contained in the carrier wave itself.Those frequency compo-
nents that are higher than the carrier frequency are called upper sidebands.
Frequency components that are lower than the carrier frequency are called lower
sidebands. Usually only one of these sidebands needs to be transmitted because
they typically contain equivalent information. Most common types of modulation
techniques are analog, such as frequency and amplitude modulation (FM and
AM).All WLAN radio devices including Cisco Aironet bridges and APs, must
have the capability to encode digital information on an analog signal to prepare it
for transmission and a reverse of the process for reception, much like the func-
tionality of a modem.The conversion process requires modulation techniques
that can efﬁciently convey digital information in analog form. Cisco Aironet
devices use a family of modulation techniques, called phase modulation, to perform
this efﬁcient encoding.

Signal to Noise Ratios and Modulation
Noise on a channel, whether wired or wireless, reduces the line speed
and throughput normally available. Noise, speed, and distance are all
interrelated. The importance of the signal to noise ratio of a RF system
is made much clearer by investigating Shannon’s Law, a fundamental
mathematical equation used to calculate the channel capacity of com-
munications systems. Claude Shannon was a Bell Laboratories engineer
in the 1940s whose research resulted in the creation of the following
equation:
C=BWlog2(1+S/N)
where C is the channel capacity, BW is the available bandwidth, and S/N
is the signal-to-noise ratio within the bandwidth.
In order to be received correctly, complex modulation schemes
require optimal signal-to-noise ratios (more signal with less noise). The

Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
Phase Modulation
Phase modulation is the current modulation technique of choice for efﬁciently
converting digital signals in a WLAN. Signal strength is used in amplitude modu-
lation (AM) to modify the carrier wave to send information. Frequency modula-
tion (FM) converts the originating signal into cycles to bear information. Phase
modulation takes advantage of a signal wave’s shape. It is ideal for sending digital
information. Cisco Aironet radios use several forms of phase shifting for transmit-
ting digital signals.We examine a digital signal and review current Cisco phase
modulation techniques.
A digital signal means an ongoing stream of bits.These bits are usually used
to communicate information in the form of data for devices capable of receiving
and decoding them.These “data bits” are mathematically represented as 0’s and 1’s
and correspond to off and on pulses electrical energy typically in the form of
alternating current. Because a radio wave is an analog waveform, we must modu-
late the off-on-off-on beat of digital electrical signals in order to transmit them
on a carrier wave.
You can send a digital signal without a carrier wave, like the earliest wireless
telegraphs, but your results would be less than spectacular. If you ever have had
someone turn on a hair dryer or vacuum sweeper while listening to an AM radio
you know how bad interference on the signal can be and therefore how inefﬁ-
cient it is. Digital signals without a carrier wave are wideband, extremely inefﬁ-
cient, and would have extremely limited data rate capacity.
A radio wave, represented as a sine wave, is a continuous wave produced to
transmit analog or digital information.The many phases or angles of the sine
wave give rise to different ways of sending information. Simple phase modulation
schemes begin by encoding a digital stream of bits onto an unchanging analog
waveform.You now have a rising and falling pattern, in tune with the 0’s and 1’s.

same is true in RF. As a receiver moves farther from a transmitter, the
signal gets weaker, and the difference between the signal and the noise
becomes less. At some point the signal cannot be distinguished from the
noise, and loss of communication occurs. The amount of compression
(or modulation scheme) at which the signal is transmitted determines
the amount of signal that is required in order to be heard through the
noise. As transmission or modulation schemes (compression) become
more complex and data rates increase, immunity to noise becomes less;
therefore the distance is reduced.

Wireless LAN Overview • Chapter 2

This pattern is sometimes referred to as on and off amplitudes.A digital bit “0”
might be marked by anything above some baseline value on the analog wave-
form, and a digital bit “1” might be marked by anything below the same baseline
value. Simple enough, but it gives you just two states to send information. Binary
Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) is an example of this type of modulation. Phase mod-
ulation techniques have become more complex to accommodate the need to
carry greater amounts of information in the waveform.The following modula-
tion techniques are used in Cisco Aironet radios (we describe each in the sections
that follow):
■
Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK)
■
Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)
■
Complimentary Code Keying (CCK)
Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK)
In Binary Phase Shift Keying modulation, digital on and offs (1’s and 0’s) are rep-
resented by the various phases of an alternating current waveform or sine wave.
BPSK uses one phase to represent a binary 1 and another phase to represent a
binary 0 for a total of two bits of binary data (see Figure 2.4).This is utilized to
transmit data at 1 Mbps.

Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)
With Quadrature Phase Shift Keying, the carrier undergoes four changes in phase
and can therefore represent four binary bits of data.This scheme, used by most
high speed modems, increases the speed and amount of data transferred by dou-
bling the two states BPSK offers to at least four states to send information. QPSK
manipulates or changes a sine wave’s normal pattern by shifting its alternation
and forcing the wave to fall to its baseline resting point.This fall to the wave’s
baseline is represented in the example by a premature drop to zero degrees (our
baseline) before the wave would naturally drop on its own (see Figure 2.5). By
forcing this abrupt drop, we are able to increase the amount of information con-
veyed in the wave.
As with BPSK, we must represent digital bits using various phases of the
analog waveform. In our QPSK example, the portion of the phase from 0 degrees
to 90 degrees might represent binary digit 0, 90 degrees to 180 degrees could
represent binary digit 1, 180 to 270 degrees and 270 back to 0 degrees might be
represented by binary digits 10 and 11 respectively.The wireless radio conﬁgured
for QPSK arranges a forced shift in the sine wave at each point that a bit or set
of bits is transmitted.The receiving wireless radio expects these shifts and decodes
them in the proper sequence. QPSK is utilized to transmit data at 2 Mbps.
Complimentary Code Keying (CCK)
Complimentary Code Keying is a newer modulation standard originally based on
another modulation technique called Mary Orthogonal Keying (MOK). It was
not a deﬁned modulation technique in the original IEEE 802.11 standard for

WLANs, unlike BPSK and QPSK. CCK was designed as a new, modiﬁed modu-
lation technique by industry leaders to overcome the limitations of the rate bar-
rier of 2 Mbps within the original standard. It was adopted in the newer IEEE
802.11b standard that is currently employed by most vendors.
CCK is a coded QPSK modulation, where the original data bits are mapped
to a corresponding modiﬁed data symbol, 8 bits for one 8-bit symbol.The data
symbol is then applied to the various phases of the analog waveform as in phase
shift keying modulations.The resulting waveform is the same as the original 
2 Mbps QPSK modulation, however, the resulting data rate is 11 Mbps. CCK uses
a complex set of functions known as complementary codes to send additional data in
the waveform. Complimentary Code Keying provides an additional bit to each I
(In-phase) and Q (Quadrature) channel by inverting or rotating the waveform 90
degrees and utilizing unmodiﬁed versions of the spreading function.There is a
code set as well as a cover sequence deﬁning the waveform.This new symbol type
carries six bits and can be QPSK modulated to carry two more bits.The result is
that 8 bits are transmitted with each symbol, resulting in a waveform that contains
16 bits of complexity.This is why the data rate for a Direct Sequence Spread
Spectrum (DSSS) system employing CCK modulation is capable of 11 Mbps
throughput rather than 2 Mbps. CCK supports both 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps mod-
ulation, and it is backward compatible with the 1–2 Mbps scheme.The data bit
structure per codeword for BPSK, QPSK, and CCK is outlined in Figure 2.6. One
of the advantages of CCK over similar modulation techniques is that it suffers less
from multipath interference than systems based only on QPSK and BPSK.

Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
A digital signal produced using any of these techniques modulates the current
carrying the signal within the radio. In other words, modulation gets wireless dig-
ital information ready for transmission. Once completed, the digital signal can
then be actually transmitted over the air with another modulation technique, like
direct sequence or frequency hopping spread spectrum.
Communicating with 
Wireless LAN Technologies
The most effective forms of wireless communications today are produced by
using radio and microwave technologies. Because of licensing and cost issues, we
have chosen to focus on the wireless technology used in Cisco Aironet wireless
products, however, brief descriptions of other wireless technologies will be pre-
sented. In the remainder of this chapter we will discuss the core aspects of various
WLAN technologies and the advantages and disadvantages of each.
The technologies available for use in WLANs include infrared, microwave,
and spread spectrum radios.Two spread spectrum techniques are currently preva-
lent: frequency hopping and direct sequence. In the following section, we discuss
the reasons for the popularity of spread spectrum technologies over infrared and
microwave. In the United States, the radio bandwidth used for spread spectrum
communications falls in three bands (900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 5.7 GHz), which
the FCC approved for local area commercial communications in the late 1980s.
In Europe, ETSI, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, intro-
duced regulations for 2.4 GHz in 1994, and HiperLAN is a family of standards in
the 5.15–5.7 GHz and 19.3 GHz frequency bands.We begin by reviewing the
most common forms of WLAN technologies: Microwave, infrared, and spread
spectrum communications.
Microwave Technology
The complete electromagnetic spectrum includes many types of wavelengths we
have become familiar with, at least in name. First among these is visible light.Two
other types of wavelengths, just at either end of the visible spectrum, are infrared
and ultraviolet light.These are the wavelengths that bring us “night vision” tech-
nology and tanning booths, respectively.Another portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum we are becoming familiar with are frequencies called microwaves.These
exist below infrared frequencies, but above normal radio frequencies.
Microwave technology is not really a LAN technology. Its main use in
WLAN capacity is to interconnect LANs between buildings requiring microwave

dishes on both ends of the link.The dishes must be in line-of-sight to transmit
and collect the microwave signals. Microwave is used to bypass the telephone
company when connecting LANs between buildings or as a backup path in the
event of a telecommunications infrastructure outage.As a WAN technology,
microwave is used to replace traditional wired technologies, such as dedicated cir-
cuits offered by the telephone company, with a network of microwave dishes to
accomplish connectivity between businesses, cities and states. For example,Alaska
has one of the largest microwave WANs at its disposal. Microwave communica-
tion satisﬁed the WAN requirements in the geographical area due to the limited
availability of dedicated circuits for data transmission and environmental con-
straints in the state.
Many of the data communications services offered by major telecommunica-
tions companies are supported by microwave technology.Although it is a viable
alternative even in private communications, it has two drawbacks. First, microwave
communication requires FCC licensing. Once a license is granted for a particular
location, that frequency band cannot be licensed to anyone else, for any purpose,
within a 17.5 mile radius. Second, the cost of implementing microwave tech-
nology (tower/dish infrastructure) is higher than other options. On the other
hand, microwave communication is extremely resistant to interference.
Infrared Technology
The infrared spectrum has long been used for such items as television and VCR
remote controls. Over the past 10 years, infrared devices for home computers
have become extremely popular. Input devices such as wireless keyboards and
mice have introduced us to the freedom of working and playing without being
tethered to the computer.Typically, an infrared receiver is attached to the key-
board or mouse connector on a computer.The wireless keyboard or mouse has
an infrared transmitter built in. Because each wireless component manufacturer
designs their own transmitters, the keyboard or mouse operates at a proprietary
frequency. Keystroke or mouse movement signals are translated into an infrared
signal and are sent to the receiver. Many laptop computers now come with an
infrared port, which allows information from another laptop or infrared device to
be transferred to each other via infrared transmission.
Just like the infrared connection between the laptops, infrared LANs use
infrared signals to transmit data.These LANs can be set up using either a point-
to-point conﬁguration (line of sight) or a diffused conﬁguration where the signals
are reﬂected off some type of surface.The line of sight conﬁguration generally
offers the faster data rate of the two.

Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
The advantages and disadvantages of infrared are few, however, the severity of
the disadvantages are high in a WLAN scenario. Infrared’s best advantage is its
capability to carry a high bandwidth.The major disadvantage is its capability to
be blocked. Because infrared energy is a form of light, it can easily be obstructed.
Like light, it cannot pass through solid objects. Because infrared provides high-
speed connectivity it is sometimes used for point-to-point connectivity, but
infrared communication solutions are very expensive to implement. Because of
infrared distance and coverage limitations, many more infrared devices are neces-
sary to provide the same coverage area as radio wireless APs.
Spread Spectrum Technology
Most communication technologies we are familiar with—radio, television, two-
way radios—use what is called narrowband communications. Each station or channel
operates over a very thin slice of the radio spectrum. Because the station is
assigned that particular band, and the FCC ensures that no other broadcasters in
the local area use that same band through licensing, there is no interference.The
range of each station is limited, so the same frequency can be reused a great dis-
tance away without interference.
Because many devices might use the ISM bands in a local area, additional
technology is required to keep the various signals from interfering with each
other. Fortunately, a technology has been developed over the past ﬁfty years,
which permits such bandwidth “sharing.”This technology provides a way to
spread the radio signal over a wide “spectrum” of radio frequencies, minimizing
the impact of narrowband interference. In most cases, only small parts of the
transmission are corrupted by any interference, and coding techniques allow that
data to be recaptured.This technology is now generally known as spread spectrum.
Spread spectrum is a coding technique for digital transmission. It was devel-
oped for the military in the 1950s by engineers from the Sylvania Electronics
System Division under a veil of secrecy to avoid jamming and eavesdropping of
signals.Though developed and implemented by the U.S. military, the technique
was ﬁrst addressed by Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil. Lamarr, a famous actress
of Austrian descent in the 1930s and 1940s, and Antheil, a music composer,
patented the idea in 1940. Of course at the time it was not called spread spec-
trum.The original patent was called the Secret Communication System.The
system was designed to allow the Allies to have an extremely fast and secure
communication system during World War II.The idea was driven by Hedy
Lamarr’s personal experiences in World War II and fueled by her extreme desire
to contribute to the task of defeating Hitler. She engaged the help of close friend

and musician, George Antheil.Antheil assisted Lamarr with the solution to the
problem of synchronization and soon the patent for their Secret Communication
System was granted. Lamarr and Antheil never convinced the U.S. government to
use the idea, and soon it was all but forgotten.The patent license expired before
government and commercial implementation of the concepts occurred. In the
mid-1980s, the U.S. military declassiﬁed spread-spectrum technology, and the
commercial sector began to develop it for consumer electronics.Today, it’s an
increasingly important component of WLANs.
The military purpose of spread spectrum coding was to transform an infor-
mation signal so that it looked more like noise. Noise has a ﬂat uniform spectrum
with no coherent peaks and can be reduced or eliminated by ﬁltering.This made
interception of radio signals extremely difﬁcult.
The spread spectrum transmission technique modiﬁes the signal spectrum to
spread it out over a range of frequencies and increase its bandwidth. In other
words, instead of transmitting a signal continuously over one narrow frequency
band, the several parts are transmitted separately over a wide spectrum of radio
frequencies.
The new “spread” signal has a lower power density, but the same total power.
The expanded transmitter bandwidth minimizes interference to others because of
its low power density.A deﬁned, but random-appearing pattern of non-sequential
bands is used, with successive parts being transmitted over the next frequency
band in the pattern. On the other end, a receiver is conﬁgured to receive the sig-
nals in the same pattern.The radio receiver then reassembles the pieces into the
original signal. Because many distinct patterns can be developed, it is possible to
have multiple radios transmitting at the same time, but never at the same fre-
quency at the same time. In the receiver, the incoming signal is decoded, and the
decoding operation provides resistance to interference and multipath distortion.
The frequencies used consist of the ISM bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.
The ISM bands include the frequency ranges at 902 MHz to 928 MHz and at
2.4 GHz to 2.484 GHz, which do not require a FCC license. Spread spectrum is
currently the most widely used transmission technique for WLANs.
Two different spreading techniques are currently used, both using a coded
pattern of communication.A receiving unit is synchronized to use the same pat-
tern and successfully receive the transmission.Any other radio unit hears the
signal as noise because it is not programmed with the appropriate coding.The
two techniques are called frequency hopping spread spectrum and direct
sequence spread spectrum.All Cisco Aironet products use DSSS.

Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
Synchronization
An extremely important and difﬁcult part of designing a spread spectrum radio is
to ensure fast and reliable synchronization in the receiver.The receiver must cor-
relate the incoming signal and then demodulate it.The correlator removes the
spreading code and the demodulator recovers the information at baseband. Both
must be synchronous with the transmitted signal and usually lock up to the
incoming signal and track it.Acquisition time is the period taken to lock up the
receiver from a cold start and is an important measure of the receiver’s perfor-
mance. Other measures include the capability to synchronize in the presence of
interference and/or thermal noise and to remain synchronized over long periods.
Frequency Hopping
The ﬁrst type of spread spectrum developed is known as frequency hopping
spread spectrum (FHSS). Simply put, frequency hopping is the process of
jumping quickly from one frequency to another.A communications signal (voice
or data) is split into separate parts.This technique broadcasts the signal over a
seemingly random series of radio frequencies.A receiver, hopping between fre-
quencies in synchronization with the transmitter, receives the message.The mes-
sage can be fully received only if the series of frequencies is known. Because only
the intended receiver knows the transmitter’s hopping sequence, only that
receiver can successfully receive all of the data. Most vendors develop their own
hopping-sequence algorithms, which all but guarantees that two transmitters will
not hop to the same frequency at the same time.
Frequency hopping has two beneﬁts. Electrical noise as random electromag-
netic signals, which are not part of any communications signal, will affect only a
small part of the signal.Also, the effects of any other forms of radio communica-
tions operating in narrow bands of the spectrum will be minimized.Any such
interference that occurs will result in only a slightly reduced quality of transmis-
sion, or a small loss of data. Because data networks acknowledge successful receipt
of data, any missing pieces will trigger a request to transmit the lost data.
The FCC has made some rules for FHSS technologies.The FCC dictates that
the transmitters must not spend more than 0.4 seconds on any one channel every
20 seconds in the 902 MHz band and every 30 seconds in the 2.4 GHz band.
Also, the transmitters must hop through at least 50 channels in the 902 MHz
band and 75 channels in the 2.4 GHz band (Figure 2.7 illustrates this relationship
between frequency, power, and time for FHSS).A channel consists of a frequency
width, which is determined by the FCC.The IEEE 802.11 committee has drafted
a standard that limits FHSS transmitters to the 2.4 GHz band.

Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)
The other type of spread spectrum communication is called DSSS.This is cur-
rently the most common method used in WLANs.A direct sequence transmitter
spreads its transmissions by adding redundant data bits called chips to them. DSSS
adds at least ten chips to each data bit to protect the receiver from data loss. DSSS
does not split a data signal into pieces, instead, it encodes each data bit into these
chips. In other words, the transmitter sends the same piece of data attached to
several chips to provide redundancy. Usually, 11 to 20 bits are used for the chip,
depending on the application.An 11-bit chip is illustrated here:
0=10010010110
1=01101101001
After a ﬁxed number of chips are sent, they repeat themselves precisely.This
ﬁxed number of chips is also referred to as the chipping sequence, or Barker sequence.
A good spread spectrum code has low cross-correlation. In other words, very few
sequences of chips will be in common to other spread spectrum codes issued by
other radios in the same area.This results in minimum interference between
users, because a code receiver, using one particular code, can be reached only by a
transmitter sending the exact same code.

Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
Similar to a frequency hopping receiver, a direct sequence receiver must
know a transmitter’s spreading code in order to properly decode the data stream.
This spreading code is what allows multiple direct sequence transmitters to
operate in the same area without interference. Once the receiver has received a
transmission, it removes all the extraneous chips to produce the original length of
the signal and completes the demodulation process.
As you can see in Figure 2.8, the number of chips and the frequency used is
directly related to a signal’s capability to avoid interference.The raw data
throughput of direct sequence transmitters in the 2.4 GHz band is 11 Mbps. In
addition to other factors, areas of high interference can signiﬁcantly slow
throughput when using DSSS.
DSSS Channel Setup
For direct sequence WLANs, eleven total channels can be used for RF transmis-
sion (see Figure 2.9). Each channel is 22 MHz wide, and all channels combined
equal the entire spectrum that can be used for 802.11 WLANs—in this case, the
2.4 GHz range of the ISM bands.When designing WLANs, multiple channels
become an issue only when overlapping coverage is required, and this will be the
case in most designs.When two APs have overlapping coverage, each AP must be

using a different channel so that the client can distinguish the difference the
between the RF for each AP. Figure 2.9 illustrates that only three channels do
not overlap concurrently: Channels 1, 6, and 11.
Spectrum Technology Comparisons:
Frequency Hopping versus Direct Sequence
Frequency hopping radios currently use less power than direct sequence radios and
generally cost less. Direct sequence radios have a practical raw data rate of 8 Mbps
and frequency hopping radios have a practical limit of 2 Mbps. So if high perfor-
mance is key and interference is not a problem, go with direct sequencing. But if a
small, inexpensive portable wireless adapter for a notebook or PDA is needed the
frequency hopping method should be good enough.With either method of spread
spectrum the end result is a system that is extremely difﬁcult to detect, does not
interfere with other services, and provides large bandwidth for data.
Implementing a 
Wireless LAN Architecture
A complete WLAN architecture consists of several key devices and structures, not
completely deﬁned by IEEE 802.11 standards. In order to satisfy application and
user requirements, other components are necessary. Figure 2.10 depicts a wireless
system and the additional components that may be needed to complete it. Some

of the components may already be in place for your particular implementation.
In general, most sites already have Distribution Systems (DS).These DSs may 
be Ethernet,Token Ring, and so on, and may include WAN connectivity as well 
as LAN.
A good way to depict these functions is to specify the network’s architecture.
This architecture describes the protocols, major hardware, and software elements
that constitute the network.A network architecture, whether wireless or wired,
may be viewed in two ways, physically and logically.
As you see from the graphic, wireless systems contain both logical and phys-
ical components, many of which are not speciﬁed in the IEEE 802.11 standards.
Some of the components not addressed by the 802.11 standard are distribution
systems, connectivity software, such as wireless client drivers and utilities, and
communications protocols (for example,TCP/IP, IPX, and so on).
The OSI Reference Model
The physical and logical components of a wireless system implement the
Physical, Data Link, and Network layer functions of the OSI reference model to
satisfy the functionality needed within LANs,WANs, and MANs.

The OSI reference model provides an overview of computer networking.
Deﬁned by the ISO, the OSI reference model divides the concept of computer
networking into seven layers. Each layer performs a different function required 
to exchange data between two systems. Each individual layer supports the opera-
tions of the layers above it.Table 2.4 breaks out the layers, their names, and their
functions.

Description
Layer 7
Application layer
The Application layer deﬁnes the net-
working applications that are visible to
the computer user.
Layer 6
Presentation layer
The Presentation layer simpliﬁes the
format of data for the application. It
performs such tasks as compressing
text and converting images into bit
streams.
Layer 5
Session layer
The Session layer creates, controls, and
terminates sessions between net-
working applications.
Layer 4
Transport layer
The Transport layer establishes reliable,
end-to-end communication between
two network devices. It uses acknowl-
edgements and data retransmissions to
ensure the reliable exchange of data.
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
is an example of a protocol that oper-
ates at this layer.
Layer 3
Network layer
The Network layer provides routing of
data across a network. The Internet
Protocol (IP) is an example of a pro-
tocol that operates at this layer.
Layer 2
Data-Link layer
The Data-Link layer speciﬁes how data
travels between two networking
devices. It provides synchronization
between devices and error detection to
ensure that the data reaches its desti-
nation uncorrupted. Ethernet functions
at the Data-Link layer.

Layer 1
Physical layer
The Physical layer deﬁnes the actual
physical connection between two
devices. For example, Ethernet cabling
and the electrical signals that are trans-
mitted along the wire correspond to
Physical layer operation.
The Data-Link layer of the OSI model is divided into two parts: the Media
Access Control (MAC) sublayer and the Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer.The
IEEE 802.2 LLC standard deﬁnes LLC activity for most networking products.The
LLC provides link control between devices and is independent of the transmission
medium or MAC technique implemented by a particular network.Wireless systems
utilize the ﬁrst two layers of the OSI reference model (see Figure 2.11).

Logical Wireless System Components
Logical wireless system components are the functions and subsystems required to
perform networking in a wireless system. Not to be confused with the actual hard-
ware used in such environments, typical logical components are software-based. In
general, many of the logical functions required of wired networks, such as Ethernet
and Token Ring are also needed in a wireless system. Much of this has to do with
the standards upon which wired networks are built.The wireless systems must
comply with these standards in order to integrate with the wired networks.
Distribution System
The distribution system, also known as the DS, refers to the topology of the wired
network that you may connect to, to access services and applications. Obviously, if
all the network services and applications you require reside on directly accessible
wireless systems, there is no need for a DS.An example of a wireless system that
does not require a DS would be an ad-hoc network where wireless stations com-
municate directly and mutually access services and applications.A network distri-
bution system is absolutely necessary if such things as databases, applications, and
print services reside on systems accessible only from a wired network. Designers of
the 802.11 standard purposely avoided the deﬁnition of a particular distribution
system for connecting APs, allowing system designers the freedom to implement
802.11-compliant networks based on the unique requirements of each implemen-
tation.This gives us the ability to design the most effective and efﬁcient wireless
system for our scenarios.As a result, you need to decide what technologies and
products will constitute the distribution system if multiple APs are necessary to
extend the range of the complete wireless system.
In most cases, you can specify a wired LAN backbone to act as the distribu-
tion system.Typically, vendors sell APs capable of connecting to either IEEE-
compliant Ethernet or Token Ring LANs. In addition,WAN components may be
necessary to connect LANs separated by longer distances.The following are the
logical components of a wireless system and brief descriptions of each. Because
the logical components are part of current wireless standards, details of these
components can be found in the section entitled “Keeping Pace with Wireless
Networking Standards.”
Medium Access Technique
Medium access techniques facilitate the sharing of a common medium.This
component is speciﬁed in the IEEE 802.11 standard.
www.syngress.com

60
Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
Synchronization and Error Control
Synchronization and error control mechanisms ensure that each link transfers the
data intact.The Data Link layer of the OSI reference model is used to handle this
function of the logical wireless system. IEEE 802.11 speciﬁes the MAC to be
used for WLANs.
Routing Mechanisms
Routing mechanisms move the data from the originating source to the intended
destination.These mechanisms work at the Network layer of the OSI reference
model.
Application Interface
The application interface connects a device, such as a laptop computer or bar-
code scanner, to application software hosted on a server.An e-mail program on a
wireless laptop is an example of an application interface.These interfaces also
include your communication and connectivity software, such as TCP/IP and
wireless client drivers.
Physical Wireless System Components
To further your understanding of wireless architecture, you need to identify the
physical wireless system components used in various wireless implementations. In
this section, we list the general terms for the physical components in the WLAN
architecture and give a brief description of each. In addition, we give an overview
of each component’s place in the overall wireless scheme.
Medium
The medium is the physical component of the wired LAN backbone.This is part
of the wireless system’s DS. For example, copper cabling, coax cabling, and ﬁber-
optic cabling are all physical components of logical topologies which are, in turn,
deﬁned as the DS.
Access Point (AP)
An AP is a wireless radio.They are the center points in an all-wireless network, or
a connection point between a wired and wireless network. Multiple APs can be
placed throughout a facility to provide users equipped with WLAN adapters the
ability to move freely throughout an extended area while maintaining uninter-
rupted access to all network resources.
www.syngress.com

Wireless LAN Overview • Chapter 2
61
Antenna
The antenna, along with air, can be thought of as the medium for wireless net-
working, outside the DS. It is the physical component that radiates the modulated
signal through the air so that the destination can receive it.Types of antennas are
differentiated by their propagation patterns, gain, and transmission power.
Wireless Station
This is any appliance that interfaces with wireless medium and operates as an end
user device.The wireless station is the user’s interface to the wireless system.
Examples of wireless stations are laptop computers, desktop computers, and PDAs
with wireless network interface cards (radio cards) installed, radio bar code
readers, and wireless hubs (like Cisco’s Workgroup Bridge product).The wireless
hub allows the addition of wired network devices such as print servers or com-
puters with traditional wired network cards to attach to the wireless hub from
which the devices gain access to the wireless network.
Server
Though not necessarily directly attached to a wireless network, servers are
nonetheless a typical component in a wireless system. In many cases, wireless sta-
tions need to access servers for such things as print and e-mail services, ﬁle
sharing, and application access.
Keeping Pace with 
Wireless Networking Standards
As you have seen in previous sections, coordination of wireless technology and its
functions are key to the reliability and success of a wireless system. Many vendors
contributed and coordinated with standards organizations to create the hardware
and technology of today’s WLANs. Because of the resulting standards put forth by
this cooperation, we are able to provide inexpensive, efﬁcient, and reliable wireless
systems.
Standards organizations are groups of people interested in promoting and
coordinating rules for the measure of quantity, weight, extent, value, or quality of
a given technology or idea giving rise to a model or example of the idea or tech-
nology.This, in turn, allows others to build on the model or example and
improve the existing idea or technology, or in some cases, foster new ideas or
technologies. In the wireless networking world, standards organizations have had
www.syngress.com

Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
the welcome impact of allowing new wireless technologies to get from concep-
tion to consumer with unprecedented speed. Because the standards are used as a
base for the wireless technology most vendors employ, consumers reap the bene-
ﬁts of interoperability, reliability, and efﬁcient technology.
Wireless standards have been developed both in the United States and abroad
and the advances made using these standards are shaping the wireless industry con-
stantly. In order to fully understand wireless fundamentals, architecture, and design
considerations, you need to understand what the current standards are for WLANs
and who created those standards.We review the major standards organizations that
have contributed to the wireless technology employed today, with a focus on the
standard used in Cisco Aironet devices, and look at forthcoming wireless standards
that are in progress. In addition, we review some organizations that inﬂuence the
wireless market by providing interoperability and compliance testing.
Institute of Electrical and 
Electronic Engineers (IEEE)
IEEE is an association that develops standards for almost anything electronic
and/or electric. Far from being limited to computer-related topics, IEEE societies
cover just about any technical practice, from automobiles to maritime, from
neural networks to superconductors.With 36 Technical Societies covering broad
interest areas, more speciﬁc topics are handled by special committees that focus
on a particular technology or technologies to develop standards that will be used
to promote technological advancement.
The IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee develops LAN standards
and MAN standards.The most widely used standards are for the Ethernet family,
token ring,WLAN, Bridging, and Virtual Bridged LANs.All standards created by
this committee are designated 802. Note:The “80”in 802 refers to the year the
committee was formed and the “2” refers to the month in which the committee
was formed.Working groups and technical advisory groups within the committee
are designated by a dot-number (.#), to deﬁne the subtechnology for which they
are responsible. For example, standards listed 802.11 designate the WLAN
Working Group within the LAN/MAN Standards Committee. Letters after the
designations represent revisions or changes to the original standards for the
working group.These groups meet several times a year to discuss new trends
within their industry or to continue the process of reﬁning a current standard.
Prior to the adoption of the 802.11 standard, wireless data-networking ven-
dors made equipment that was based on proprietary technology.Wary of being

locked into a relationship with a speciﬁc vendor, potential wireless customers
instead turned to more standards-based wired technologies.As a result, deploy-
ment of wireless networks did not happen on a large scale, and remained a luxury
item for large companies with large budgets.
www.syngress.com
Additional Initiatives of the 
802 Standards Committee
802.1 LAN/MAN Bridging and Management  802.1 is the
base standard for LAN/MAN Bridging, LAN architecture, LAN
management, and protocol layers above the MAC and LLC
layers. Some examples include 802.1q, the standard for vir-
tual LANs, and 802.1d, the Spanning Tree Protocol.
802.2 Logical Link Control  Because Logical Link Control is
now a part of all 802 standards, this Working Group is cur-
rently in hibernation (inactive) with no ongoing projects.
802.3 CSMA/CD Access Method (Ethernet)  802.3 deﬁnes
that an Ethernet network can operate at 10 Mbps, 100
Mbps, 1 Gbps, or even 10 Gbps. It also deﬁnes that category
5 twisted pair cabling and ﬁber optic cabling are valid cable
types. This group identiﬁes how to make vendors’ equipment
interoperate despite the various speeds and cable types.
802.4 Token-Passing Bus  This Working Group is also in
hibernation with no ongoing projects.
802.5 Token Ring  Token Ring networks operate at 4 mps or
16 Mbps. Currently, there are Working Groups proposing 100
Mb Token Ring (802.5t) and Gigabit Token Ring (802.5v).
Examples of other 802.5 specs would be 802.5c, Dual Ring
Wrapping, and 802.5j, ﬁber optic station attachment.
802.6 Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)  Because MANs
are created and managed with current internetworking stan-
dards, the 802.6 Working Group is in hibernation.
802.7 Broadband LAN  In 1989, this Working Group recom-
mended practices for Broadband LANs, which were reafﬁrmed

in 1997. This group is inactive with no ongoing projects. The
maintenance effort for 802.7 is now supported by 802.14.
802.8 Fiber Optics  Many of this Working Group’s recom-
mended practices for ﬁber optics get wrapped into other
standards at the Physical layer.
802.9 Isochronous Services LAN (ISLAN)  Isochronous
Services refer to processes where data must be delivered
within certain time constraints. Streaming media and voice
calls are examples of trafﬁc that requires an isochronous
transport system.
802.10 Standard for Interoperable LAN Security (SILS)
This Working Group provided some standards for Data
Security in the form of 802.10a, Security Architecture
Framework, and 802.10c, Key Management. This Working
Group is currently in hibernation with no ongoing projects.
802.11 Wireless LAN (WLAN) This Working Group is devel-
oping standards for Wireless data delivery in the 2.4 GHz and
5.1 GHz radio spectrum.
802.12 Demand Priority Access Method  This Working
Group provided two Physical layer and Repeater speciﬁca-
tions for the development of 100 Mbps Demand Priority
MACs. Although they were accepted as ISO standards and
patents were received for their operation, widespread accep-
tance was overshadowed by Ethernet. 802.12 is currently in
the process of being withdrawn.
802.13  This standard was intentionally left blank.
802.14  Cable-TV Based Broadband Comm Network This
Working Group developed speciﬁcations for the Physical and
Media Access Control layers for cable televisions and cable
modems. Believing their work to be done, this Working
Group has no ongoing projects.
802.15 Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN)  The vision
of Personal Area Networks is to create a wireless interconnec-
tion between portable and mobile computing devices such as
PCs, peripherals, cell phones, PDAs, pagers, and consumer
electronics, allowing these devices to communicate and inter-
operate with one another without interfering with other
wireless communications.

The only way WLANs would be generally accepted would be if the wireless
hardware involved had a low cost and had become commodity items such as
routers and switches. Recognizing that the only way for this to happen would be
if there were a wireless data-networking standard, the IEEE’s 802 Group took on
their eleventh challenge. Because many of the members of the 802.11 Working
Group were employees of vendors making wireless technologies, there were
many pushes to include certain functions in the ﬁnal speciﬁcation.Although this
slowed down the progress of ﬁnalizing 802.11, it also provided momentum for
delivery of a feature-rich standard left open for future expansion.
On June 26, 1997, the IEEE announced the ratiﬁcation of the 802.11 stan-
dard for wireless local area networks. Because that time, costs associated with
deploying an 802.11-based network have dropped, and WLANs rapidly are being
deployed in schools, businesses, and homes.
As mentioned earlier, the primary reason wireless LANs were not widely
accepted was the lack of standardization. It is logical to question whether vendors
would accept a nonproprietary operating standard, because vendors compete to
make unique and distinguishing products.Although 802.11 standardized the
physical (PHY) media access control (MAC) layers, the frequencies to send/
receive on, transmission rates and more, it did not absolutely guarantee that dif-
fering vendors’ products would be 100 percent compatible. In fact, some vendors
built in backward-compatibility features into their 802.11 products in order to
support their legacy customers. Other vendors have introduced proprietary
extensions (for example, bit-rate adaptation and stronger encryption) to their
802.11 offerings.
www.syngress.com
802.16 Broadband Wireless Access  The goal of the 802.16
Working Group is to develop standards for ﬁxed broadband
wireless access systems. These standards are key to solving
“last-mile” local-loop issues. 802.16 is similar to 802.11a in
that it uses unlicensed frequencies in the unlicensed national
information infrastructure (U-NII) spectrum. 802.16 is dif-
ferent from 802.11a in that Quality of Service for voice/
video/data issues are being addressed from the start in order
to present a standard that will support true wireless network
backhauling.

66
Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
802.11
As in all 802.x standards, the 802.11 speciﬁcation covers the operation of the
MAC and PHY layers.As you can see in Figure 2.12, 802.11 deﬁnes a MAC
sublayer, MAC services and protocols, and three physical layers.
The three physical layer options for 802.11 are infrared (IR) baseband PHY
and two RF PHYs. Due to line-of-sight limitations, very little development has
occurred with the Infrared PHY.The RF physical layer is composed of FHSS and
DSSS in the 2.4 GHz band.All three physical layers operate at either 1 or 2
Mbps.The majority of 802.11 implementations utilize the DSSS method.
FHSS works by sending bursts of data over numerous frequencies.As the
name implies, it hops between frequencies.Typically, the devices use up to four
frequencies simultaneously to send information and only for a short period of
time before hopping to new frequencies.The devices using FHSS agree upon the
frequencies being used. In fact, due to the short time period of frequency use and
device agreement of these frequencies, many autonomous networks can coexist
in the same physical space.
DSSS functions by dividing the data into several pieces and simultaneously
sending the pieces on as many different frequencies as possible, unlike FHSS,
which sends on a limited number of frequencies.This process allows for greater
transmission rates than FHSS, but is vulnerable to greater occurrences of interfer-
ence.This is because the data is spanning a larger portion of the spectrum at any
given time than FHSS. In essence, DHSS ﬂoods the spectrum all at one time,
whereas FHSS selectively transmits over certain frequencies.
The 1997 completion of the IEEE 802.11 standard for WLANs was a ﬁrst
important step in the evolutionary development of wireless networking technolo-
gies.The standard was developed to maximize interoperability between differing
brands of WLANs as well as to introduce a variety of performance improvements
and beneﬁts.
The initial 802.11 PAR (Project Authorization Request) states,“...the scope
of the proposed [wireless LAN] standard is to develop a speciﬁcation for wireless

connectivity for ﬁxed, portable, and moving stations within a local area.”The
PAR further says,“...the purpose of the standard is to provide wireless connec-
tivity to automatic machinery and equipment or stations that require rapid
deployment, which may be portable, handheld, or which may be mounted on
moving vehicles within a local area.”
The resulting standard, which is ofﬁcially called IEEE Standard for Wireless
LAN Medium Access (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Speciﬁcations, deﬁnes
over-the-air protocols necessary to support networking in local area.
802.11 Topologies
The topology of a wireless network is dynamic; therefore, the destination address
does not always correspond to the destination’s location.This raises a problem
when forwarding frames through the network to the intended destination.
The IEEE 802.11 topology consists of components, called “sets”, to provide a
WLAN that allows transparent station mobility.The 802.11 standard supports the
following three topology sets:
■
Basic Service Set (BSS) networks  The basic topology set of 802.11
systems is the basic service set (BSS).The BSS consists of at least one AP
connected to the wired network infrastructure and a set of wireless end
stations (see Figure 2.13). BSS conﬁgurations rely on an AP that acts as the
logical server for a single wireless LAN cell or channel. Communications
between two end stations actually ﬂows from one station to the AP and
from the AP to the other station.

Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
■
Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS) networks IBSS networks
are also referred to as an independent conﬁguration or ad-hoc network.
Logically, an IBSS conﬁguration is very similar to a peer-to-peer home
or ofﬁce network in which no single node is required to function as a
server (see Figure 2.14). IBSS topology sets include a number of wireless
end stations that communicate directly with one another, with no inter-
vening AP or any connection to a wired network. It is useful for quickly
and easily setting up a wireless network anyplace where a wireless infras-
tructure does not exist or is not required for services, such as meeting
rooms in hotels, airports, or trade shows, or where access to the wired
network is barred (such as for consultants at a client site). Generally, ad-
hoc implementations cover a small (limited) area and are not connected
to any network.
■
Extended Service Set (ESS) networks  Extended Service Set (ESS)
topologies consist of a series of overlapping BSS sets (each containing an
AP), commonly referred to as cells.These cells are usually connected
together by some wired medium, what we referred to in our wireless
architecture section as a DS (see Figure 2.15).Although the DS could be
any type of network, it is almost invariably an Ethernet LAN. Mobile
end stations can roam between the APs, making seamless ESS-wide cov-
erage possible. Because most corporate WLANs require access to the
wired LAN for services (ﬁle servers, printers, Internet links) they will
operate in a BSS/ESS topology.
www.syngress.com
Figure 2.14 Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS) Network

Wireless LAN Overview • Chapter 2
69
These networks utilize a basic building block:The 802.11 standard referred to
as a BSS, providing a coverage area whereby stations of the BSS (or ESS) remain
fully connected.A station is free to move within the BSS, but it can no longer
communicate directly with other stations if it leaves the BSS/ESS.
The compelling force behind WLAN deployment is that with 802.11, users are
free to move about without having to worry about switching network connections
manually. If we were operating with a single infrastructure BSS, this moving about
would be limited to the signal range of our one AP.Through the ESS, the IEEE
802.11 architecture allows users to move between multiple infrastructure BSSs. In
an ESS, the APs talk amongst themselves forwarding trafﬁc from one BSS to
another, as well as switch the roaming devices from one BSS to another.
What makes the WLAN so unique, though, are the invisible interactions
between the various parts of the extended service set. Pieces of equipment on the
wired network have no idea they are communicating with a mobile wireless
LAN device, nor do they see the switching that occurs when the wireless device
changes from one AP to another.To the wired network, all it sees is a consistent
MAC address to talk to, just as if the MAC was another node on the wire.
Because multiple APs exist in this model, the wireless devices no longer com-
municate in a peer-to-peer fashion. Instead, all trafﬁc from one device destined
for another device is relayed through the AP. Even though it would look like this

Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
would double the amount of trafﬁc on the WLAN, this also provides for trafﬁc
buffering on the AP when a device is operating in a low-power mode.
802.11 Services
Nine different services provide behind-the-scenes support to the 802.11 architec-
ture. Of these nine, four belong to the station services group and the remaining ﬁve
to the distribution services group.
The four station services (authentication, de-authentication, data delivery, and privacy)
provide functionality equal to what standard 802.3 wired networks would have.
The authentication service deﬁnes the identity of the wireless device.Without
this distinct identity, the device is not allowed access to the WLAN.
Authentication can also be made against a list of MACs allowed to use the net-
work.This list of allowable MAC addresses may be on the AP or on a database
somewhere on the wired network.A wireless device can authenticate itself to
more than one AP at a time.This sort of “pre-authentication” allows the device
to prepare other APs for its entry into their airspace.
The de-authentication service is used to destroy a previously known station
identity. Once the de-authentication service has been started, the wireless device
can no longer access the WLAN.This service is invoked when a wireless device
shuts down, or when it is roaming out of the range of the AP.This frees up
resources on the AP for other devices.
Just like its wired counterparts, the 802.11 standard speciﬁes a data delivery
service to ensure that data frames are transferred reliably from one MAC to
another.We discuss this data delivery in greater detail in following sections.
The privacy service is used to protect the data as it crosses the WLAN. Even
though the service utilizes an RC4-based encryption scheme, it is not intended
for end-to-end encryption or as a sole method of securing data. Its design was to
provide a level of protection equivalent to that provided on a wired network—
hence its moniker Wired Equivalent Protocol (WEP).
Between the LLC sublayer and the MAC, ﬁve distribution services make the
decisions as to where the 802.11 data frames should be sent.As you will see, these
distribution services make the roaming handoffs when the wireless device is in
motion.The ﬁve services are association, re-association, disassociation, integration, and
distribution.
The wireless device uses the association service as soon as it connects to an
AP.This service establishes a logical connection between the devices, and deter-
mines the path the DS needs to take in order to reach the wireless device. If the
wireless device does not have an association made with an AP, the DS will not

Wireless LAN Overview • Chapter 2
71
know where that device is or how to get data frames to it.As you can see in
Figure 2.16, the wireless device can be authenticated to more than one AP at a
time, but it will never be associated with more than one AP.
As you will see in later sections dealing with roaming and low-power situa-
tions, sometimes the wireless device will not be linked continuously to the same
AP.To keep from losing whatever network session information the wireless
device has, the re-association service is used.This service is similar to the associa-
tion service, but includes current information about the wireless device. In the
case of roaming, this information tells the current AP the previous AP the wire-
less devices was associated to.This allows the current AP to contact the previous
AP to pick up any data frames waiting for the wireless device and forward them
to their destination.
The disassociation service is used to tear down the association between the
AP and the wireless device.This could be because the device is roaming out of
the AP’s area, the AP is shutting down, or any one of a number of other reasons.
To keep communicating to the network, the wireless device will have to use the
association service to ﬁnd a new AP.

5. Association.
As the station leaves AP 1's coverage area,
the following steps take place:
1. Station beacon signals indicate a
weakening of the signal to AP 1.
A search takes place for a new
AP on the same or different
channels. AP 2 is found.
2. A re-association request is sent
to AP 2 from station. AP 2
accepts request.
3. AP 2 sends MAC layer update
information (client synchronization,
traffic indicators, etc.) for station
to AP 1 over wired network.
4. Disassociation and de-authentication
acknowledgement is sent to AP 2
from AP 1.

Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
The distribution service is used by APs to determine whether to send the
data frame to another AP and possibly another wireless device, or if the frame is
destined to head out of the WLAN into the wired network.
The integration service resides on the APs as well.This service does the data
translation from the 802.11 frame format into the framing format of the wired
network. It also does the reverse, taking data destined for the WLAN, and framing
it within the 802.11 frame format.
CSMA-CA Mechanism
The basic access mechanism for 802.11 is Carrier Sense Multiple Access
Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) with binary exponential backoff.This is very
similar to the Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)
that we are familiar with when dealing with standard 802.3 (Ethernet), but with a
couple of major differences.
Unlike Ethernet, which sends out a signal until a collision is detected, CSMA/
CA takes great care to not transmit unless it has the attention of the receiving
unit, and no other unit is talking.This is called listening before talking (LBT).
Before a packet is transmitted, the wireless device will listen to hear if any
other device is transmitting. If a transmission is occurring, the device will wait for
a randomly determined period of time, and then listen again. If no one else is
using the medium, the device will begin transmitting. Otherwise, it will wait
again for a random time before listening once more.
802.11 DCF/PCF and RTC/CTS Mechanisms
To minimize the risk of a wireless device transmitting at the same time as another
wireless device (and thus causing a collision), the 802.11 working group designed
two functions known as DCF and PCF, employing a mechanism called Request
To Send/Clear To Send (RTS/CTS).
Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) is used by any of the component
topologies to determine when a station can transmit during periods of con-
tention on the network and is a best effort delivery system. If the channel being
used is sensed to be in an idle state, a speciﬁed “wait” period is initiated before
transmission actually occurs.
In PCF (Point Coordination Function), a single point in the network (usually
a network AP) acts as a centralized “trafﬁc cop,” telling individual stations when
they may place a packet on the network. In other words, the AP periodically
“beacons” each of its associated end stations, polling them to see if they have

anything to transmit.Time-sensitive applications, such as voice and video, use this
to permit ﬁxed, dependable rate transmissions.
In both DCF and PCF, RTS/CTS is used as the mechanism to perform these
functions. For example, if data arrived at the AP destined for a wireless node, the
AP would send an RTS frame to the wireless node requesting a certain amount
of time to deliver data to it.The wireless node would respond with a CTS frame
saying that it would hold off any other communications until the AP had com-
pleted sending the data. Other wireless nodes would hear the transaction taking
place, and delay their transmissions for that period of time as well. In this manner,
data is passed between nodes with a minimal possibility of a device causing a col-
lision on the medium.
This also gets rid of a well-documented WLAN issue called the hidden node. In
a network with multiple devices, the possibility exists that one wireless node
might not know all the other nodes that are out on the WLAN.Thanks to
RTS/CTS, each node hears the requests to transmit data to the other nodes, and
thus learns what other devices are operating in that BSS.
802.11 Data Acknowledgment
When sending data across a radio signal with the inherent risk of interference, the
odds of a packet getting lost between the transmitting radio and the destination
unit are much greater than in a wired network model.To make sure that data
transmissions would not get lost in the ether, acknowledgment (ACK) was intro-
duced.The acknowledgement portion of CSMA/CA means that when a destina-
tion host receives a packet, it sends back a notiﬁcation to the sending unit. If the
sender does not receive an ACK, it will know that this packet was not received
and will transmit it again.
All this takes place at the MAC layer. Noticing that an ACK has not been
received, the sending unit is able to grab the radio medium before any other unit
can and it resends the packet.This allows recovery from interference without the
end user being aware that a communications error has occurred.
802.11 Fragmentation
In an environment prone to interference, the possibility exists that one or more
bits in a packet will get corrupted during transmission. No matter the number of
corrupted bits, the packet will need to be re-sent.
When operating in an area where interference is not a possibility, but a reality,
it makes sense to transmit smaller packets than those traditionally found in wired
networks.This allows for a faster retransmission of the packet to be accomplished.
www.syngress.com

74
Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
The disadvantage to doing this is that in the case of no corrupted packets, the
cost of sending many short packets is greater than the cost of sending the same
information in a couple of large packets.Thankfully, the 802.11 standard has made
this a conﬁgurable feature.This way, a network administrator can specify short
packets in some areas and longer packets in more open, non-interfering areas.
802.11 Power Management
Because the whole premise of wireless LANs is mobility, having sufﬁcient battery
power in the mobile device (such as a laptop or PDA) to power the communica-
tions channel is of prime concern.The IEEE recognized this and included a
power management service that allows the mobile client to go into a sleep mode
to save power without losing connectivity to the wireless infrastructure.
Utilizing a 20-byte Power Save Poll (PS-Poll) frame, the wireless device sends
a message to its AP letting it know that it is going into power-save mode, and the
AP needs to buffer all packets destined for the device until it comes back online.
Periodically, the wireless device will wake up and see if there are any packets
waiting for it on the AP. If there aren’t, another PS-Poll frame is sent, and the unit
goes into a sleep mode again.The real beneﬁt here is that the mobile user is able
to use the WLAN for longer periods of time without severely impacting the bat-
tery life of their mobile device.
802.11 Multicell Roaming
Another beneﬁt to wireless LANs is being able to move from wireless cell to cell
as you go around the ofﬁce, campus, or home without the need to modify your
network services. Roaming between APs in your ESS is a very important portion
of the 802.11 standard. Roaming is based on the capability of the wireless device
to determine the quality of the wireless signal to any AP within reach, and decide
to switch communications to a different AP if it has a stronger or cleaner signal.
This is based primarily upon an entity called the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. In
order for wireless devices to determine the S/N ratio for each AP in the network,
APs send out beacon messages that contain information about the AP as well as
link measurement data.The wireless device listens to these beacons and determines
which AP has the clearest and cleanest signal.After making this determination, the
wireless device sends authentication information and attempts to reassociate with
the new AP.The reassociation process tells the new AP which AP the device just
came from.The new AP picks up whatever data frames that might be left at the
old AP, and notiﬁes the old AP that it no longer needs to accept messages for that
wireless device.This frees up resources on the old AP for its other clients.

Even though the 802.11 standard covers the concepts behind the communi-
cations between the AP and the DS, it doesn’t deﬁne exactly how this communi-
cation should take place.This is because there are many different ways this
communication can be implemented.Although this gives a vendor a good deal of
ﬂexibility in AP/DS design, there could be situations where APs from different
vendors might not be able to interoperate across a distribution system due to the
differences in how those vendors implemented the AP/DS interaction. Currently,
there is an 802.11 Working Group (802.11f) developing an Inter-Access Point
Protocol.This protocol will be of great help in the future as companies who have
invested in one vendor’s products can integrate APs and devices from other ven-
dors into their ESSs.
802.11 Security
One of the biggest concerns facing network administrators when implementing a
WLAN is data security. In a wired environment, the lack of access to the physical
wire can prevent someone from wandering into your building and connecting to
your internal network. In a WLAN scenario, it is impossible for the AP to know
if the person operating the wireless device is sitting inside your building, passing
time in your lobby, or if they are seated in a parked car just outside your ofﬁce.
Acknowledging that passing data across an unreliable radio link could lead to
possible snooping, the IEEE 802.11 standard provides three ways to provide a
greater amount of security for the data that travels over the WLAN.Adopting any
(or all three) of these mechanisms will decrease the likelihood of an accidental
security exposure.
The ﬁrst method makes use of the 802.11 Service Set Identiﬁer (SSID).This
SSID can be associated with one or more APs to create multiple WLAN seg-
ments within the infrastructure BSS.These segments can be related to ﬂoors of a
building, business units, or other data-deﬁnition sets. Because the SSID is pre-
sented during the authentication process, it acts as a crude password. Because
most end-users set up their wireless devices, these SSIDs could be shared among
users, thus limiting their effectiveness.Another downside to using SSIDs as a sole
form of authentication is that if the SSID were to be changed (due to an
employee termination or other event), all wireless devices and APs would have to
reﬂect this change. On a medium-sized WLAN, rotating SSIDs on even a bian-
nual basis could prove to be a daunting and time-consuming task.
As mentioned earlier in the station services section, the AP also can authenti-
cate a wireless device against a list of MAC addresses.This list could reside locally
on the AP, or the authentication could be checked against a database of allowed
www.syngress.com

76
Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
MACs located on the wired network.This typically provides a good level of
security, and is best used with small WLAN networks.With larger WLAN net-
works, administering the list of allowable MAC addresses will require some back-
end services to reduce the amount of time needed to make an addition or
subtraction from the list.
The third mechanism 802.11 offers to protect data traversing the WLAN was
also mentioned earlier in the section on station services.The privacy service uses a

Limitations of WEP
Recently, researchers at the University of California, at Berkeley, pub-
lished a document identifying security ﬂaws in the 802.11 security pro-
tocol (WEP) that “seriously undermine the security claims of the system”
and state that WEP is insufﬁcient for WLAN security. Articles about the
researchers’ ﬁndings have appeared in The Wall Street Journal and other
publications.
Speciﬁcally, WEP is susceptible to the following types of attacks:
■Passive attacks to decrypt trafﬁc based on statistical analysis
■Active attack to inject new trafﬁc from unauthorized mobile
stations, based on known plaintext
■Active attacks to decrypt trafﬁc, based on tricking the AP
■Dictionary-building attack that, after analysis of about a day’s
worth of trafﬁc, allows real-time automated decryption of all
trafﬁc
In general, the extent of vulnerability depends on whether static or
dynamic WEP is used. Unfortunately, many WLAN deployments use
static WEP keys that signiﬁcantly compromise security, as many users in
a given WLAN share the same key. Cisco has addressed these security
concerns through augmentation of 802.11b WEP by creating a per-user,
per-session, dynamic WEP key tied to the network logon, thereby
addressing the limitations of static WEP keys while maintaining ease of
administration. The Cisco recommended security solution for Aironet
implementations is covered in depth in Chapter 9.

RC-4 based encryption scheme to encapsulate the payload of the 802.11 data
frames, called Wired Equivalent Protocol (WEP).WEP speciﬁes a 40-bit encryp-
tion key, although some vendors have implemented a 104-bit key.As mentioned
previously,WEP is not meant to be an end-to-end encryption solution.WEP
keys on the APs and wireless devices can be rotated, but because the 802.11 stan-
dard does not specify a key-management protocol, all key rotation must be done
manually. Like the SSID, rotating the WEP key would affect all APs and wireless
users and take signiﬁcant effort from the network administrator.
Some network designers consider WLANs to be in the same crowd as
Remote Access Service (RAS) devices, and they claim that the best protection is
to place the WLAN architecture behind a ﬁrewall or a Virtual Private Network
(VPN) device.This would make the wireless client authenticate to the VPN or
ﬁrewall using third-party software (on top of WEP).The beneﬁt here is that the
bulk of the authenticating would be up to a non-WLAN device and would not
require additional AP maintenance.
The uses of 802.11 networks can range from homes to public areas (such as
schools and libraries) to businesses and corporate campuses.The ability to deploy
a low-cost network without the need to have wires everywhere is allowing wire-
less networks to spring up in areas where wired networks would be cost pro-
hibitive.The 802.11 services allow the wireless device the same kind of
functionality as a wired network, yet giving the user the ability to roam
throughout the WLAN.
802.11b
On September 16, 1999, the IEEE ratiﬁed a revision of the 802.11 standard,
called 802.11 High Rate (HR/DSSS) or 802.11b, that provides much higher data
rates, while maintaining the 802.11 protocol.The basic architecture, features, and
services of 802.11b are deﬁned by the original 802.11 standard as the revised
speciﬁcation affects only the physical layer, adding higher data rates and more
robust connectivity.
The key contribution of the 802.11b addition to the WLAN standard was to
standardize the physical layer support of two new speeds, 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps.
To accomplish this, DSSS had to be selected as the sole physical layer technique
for the standard because frequency hopping cannot support the higher speeds
without violating current FCC regulations.The implication is that 802.11b sys-
tems will interoperate with 1 Mbps and 2 Mbps 802.11 DSSS systems, but will
not work with 1 Mbps and 2 Mbps 802.11 FHSS systems. Because the 802.11b
standard has no provision for FHSS, most vendors chose to implement DSSS, as
www.syngress.com

78
Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
the ratiﬁed 802.11b (11 Mbps) standard.This makes migration from a 2 Mbps
802.11 DSSS system to an 11 Mbps 802.11b system very easy as the underlying
modulation scheme is very similar. 2 Mbps 802.11 DSSS systems will be able to
coexist with 11 Mbps 802.11b systems, enabling a smooth transition to the
higher data rate technology.This is similar to migrating from 10 Mbps Ethernet
to 100 Mbps Ethernet, enabling a large performance improvement while main-
taining the same protocol. However, there is no easy migration path from 1 and 2
Mbps FHSS systems to the 11 Mbps DSSS system.To migrate from FHSS sys-
tems to DSSS will require wholesale replacement of radios in areas where the
currently used FHSS is either no longer functional or productivity requirements
outweigh conversion costs.
802.11b WLANs use dynamic rate shifting, allowing data rates to be automat-
ically adjusted to compensate for interference or range issues on the radio
channel. Ideally, users connect at the full 11 Mbps rate. However when devices
move beyond the optimal range for 11 Mbps operation, or if substantial interfer-
ence is present, 802.11b devices will transmit at lower speeds, falling back to 5.5,
2, and 1 Mbps. Likewise, if the device moves back within the range of a higher-
speed transmission, the connection will automatically speed up again. Rate
shifting is a physical-layer mechanism transparent to the user and the upper layers
of the protocol stack.
There are many different devices competing for airspace in the 2.4 GHz
radio spectrum. Unfortunately, most of the devices that cause interference are
especially common in the home environment, such as microwaves and cordless
phones.As you can imagine, the viability of an 802.11b network depends on how
many of these products are near the network devices.
One of the more recent entrants to the 802.11b airspace comes in the form of
the emerging Bluetooth wireless standard.Though designed for short-range trans-
missions, Bluetooth devices utilize FHSS to communicate with each other. Cycling
through thousands of frequencies a second, this looks as if it poses the greatest
chance of creating interference for 802.11. Further research will determine exactly
what—if any—interference Bluetooth will cause to 802.11b networks.
These forms of interference will directly impact the home user who wishes
to set up a wireless LAN, especially if neighbors operate interfering devices. Only
time will tell if 802.11b will be able to stand up against these adversaries and
hold on to the marketplace.

802.11a
802.11a is one of the physical layer extensions to the 802.11 standard.
Abandoning spread spectrum completely, 802.11a uses an encoding technique
called Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM).Although this
encoding technique is similar to the European 5 GHz HiperLAN physical layer
speciﬁcation, which will be explained in greater detail later in the chapter,
802.11a currently is speciﬁc to the United States.
802.11a equipment will operate at 5 GHz and support up to a 54 Mbps data
rate.The FCC has allocated 300 MHz of RF spectrum for unlicensed operation
in the 5 GHz block, 200 MHz of which is at 5.15 MHz to 5.35 MHz (UNII),
with the other 100 MHz at 5.725 MHz to 5.825 MHz (ISM). In addition to the
frequency and bandwidth allocation, one key parameter that is regulated by the
various authorities is the allowable transmit output power.The transmit output
power is directly related with the range of coverage that a particular radio can
achieve.The 5 GHz spectrum is split into three working “domains.”The ﬁrst 100
MHz in the lower section is restricted to a maximum power output of 50 mW.
The second 100 MHz has a more generous 250 mW power budget, while the
top 100 MHz is delegated for outdoor applications, with a maximum of 1W
power output.
In contrast, 802.11b client cards can radiate as much as 1 watt in the United
States. However, most modern cards radiate only a fraction (30 mW) of the max-
imum available power.This is due mainly for reasons of battery conservation and
heat dissipation.Although segmented, the total bandwidth available for IEEE
802.11a applications is almost four times that of the ISM band’s 83 MHz of spec-
trum in the 2.4 GHz range, while the UNII and 5GHz ISM bands offer 300 MHz.
When the IEEE ratiﬁed the 802.11a and 802.11b wireless networking commu-
nications standards in 1999, its goal was to create a standards-based technology that
could span multiple physical encoding types, frequencies, and applications in the
same way the 802.3 Ethernet standard has been successfully applied to 10 Mbps,
100 Mbps, and 1 Gbps technology over ﬁber and various kinds of copper.
Like Ethernet and Fast Ethernet, 802.11b and 802.11a use an identical MAC.
However, whereas Fast Ethernet uses the same physical-layer encoding scheme as
Ethernet (only faster), 802.11a uses an entirely different encoding scheme, called
OFDM.
A drawback to using the 802.11b MAC is that 802.11a will inherit the same
inefﬁciencies resident in 802.11b wireless implementations.The 802.11b MAC 
is only about 70 percent efﬁcient. Currently your maximum throughput on an
www.syngress.com

80
Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
11 Mbps 802.11b wireless implementations are between 5.5 and 6 Mbps. So even
at 802.11a’s 54 Mbps, maximum throughput is closer to 30 to 35 Mbps when
factoring in driver inefﬁciencies and some additional overhead at the physical
layer. Unlike 802.11b, 802.11a does not have to transmit its headers at 1 Mbps, so
802.11a will gain some efﬁciency (about 5 percent) over 802.11b.
Because 802.11a and 802.11b operate in different frequencies, interoperability
is impossible.You have a clear migration path when you need more bandwidth,
but extensive redesign is necessary to move from 802.11b to 802.11a.
Coexistence of the two standards in a single environment is possible because
there is no signal overlap.As bandwidth needs increase, you can begin to deploy
802.11a gear right alongside your 802.11b installation, the range and coverage
will probably require that you install additional APs if you want to achieve the 
54 Mbps data rate.
Other Related Working Groups
Since the ﬁrst 802.11 standard was approved in 1997, several initiatives have taken
place to make improvements. Each task group, outlined next, is endeavoring to
improve the 802.11 standard, making it globally accessible, efﬁcient, and secure,
without having to reinvent the MAC layer of 802.11:
■
The 802.11d Working Group Concentrating on the development of
802.11 WLAN equipment to operate in markets not served by the cur-
rent standard (the current 802.11 standard deﬁnes WLAN operation in
only a few countries).
■
The IEEE 802.11e Working Group Providing enhancements to the
802.11 standard while retaining compatibility with 802.11b and 802.11a.
The enhancements include multimedia capability made possible with the
adoption of quality of service (QoS) functionality as well as security
improvements.What does this mean for a service provider? It means the
ability to offer video on demand, audio on demand, high-speed Internet
access, and Voice over IP (VoIP) services.What does this mean for the
home or business user? It allows high-ﬁdelity multimedia in the form of
MPEG2 video and CD quality sound, and redeﬁnition of the traditional
phone use with VoIP. QoS is the key to the added functionality with
802.11e. It provides the functionality required to accommodate time-
sensitive applications such as video and audio. QoS includes queuing,
trafﬁc shaping tools, and scheduling.These characteristics allow priority

of trafﬁc. For example, data trafﬁc is not time-sensitive and therefore has
a lower priority than applications such as streaming video.With these
enhancements, wireless networking has evolved to meet the demands of
today’s users.

European Telecommunications 
Standards Institute (ETSI)1
The European counterpart to IEEE; ETSI (the European Telecommunications
Standards Institute) was formed in 1988 by the European Commission.The
European Commission, formed of telecommunications vendors and operators,
wanted to deﬁne standards for the European market that would allow telecom-
munications to function as a single entity. In the beginning, ETSI focused its
standards primarily on the beneﬁt it would provide European citizens. Later, stan-
dards beneﬁting all markets were introduced. ETSI is a nonproﬁt organization
whose mission is to produce the telecommunications standards that will be used
throughout Europe.
ETSI has its headquarters based in the south of France.The institute unites
789 members from 52 countries inside and outside Europe, and represents
administrations, network operators, manufacturers, service providers, research
bodies, and users.Any European organization proving an interest in promoting
European telecommunications standards has the right to represent that interest in
ETSI and thus to directly inﬂuence the standards-making process.

Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
ETSI’s approach to standards making is similar to IEEE’s in many ways. It is
ETSI members that ﬁx the standards to function based on market drivers and
needs.Accordingly, ETSI produces voluntary standards, some of these may go on
to be adopted by the European Commission as the technical base for directives
or regulations, but voluntary standards are requested by those who subsequently
implement them, which means that the standards remain practical rather than
abstract.
Similar to IEEE’s model, ETSI’s organizational model is broken down into
various committees and working groups. It consists of a General Assembly, a
Board, a Technical Organization (a.k.a,Technical Bodies), and a Secretariat.The
Technical Organization produces and approves technical standards. It encompasses
ETSI Projects (EPs),Technical Committees (TCs), and Special Committees. More
than 3,500 experts are at present working for ETSI in over 200 groups.
The central Secretariat of ETSI has about 110 staff members. In order to pro-
mote and accelerate standardization, additional experts work on a full time basis at
the ETSI Headquarters.There are about 25 Specialist Task Forces (STFs) with
around 60 experts total.To date, over 5,000 ETSI deliverables have been published.
ETSI promotes the worldwide standardization process whenever possible. Its
Work Program is based on, and coordinated with, the activities of international
standardization bodies, mainly two groups within the International Telecommuni-
cation Union (ITU), the ITU-T and the ITU-R.The ITU is headquartered in
Geneva, Switzerland, and it is an international organization within which govern-
ments and the private sector coordinate global telecom networks and services.
Recently ETSI has coordinated it’s efforts in the WLAN arena with the IEEE.
ETSI’s project Broadband Radio Access Networks (BRAN) is being coordinated
with IEEE to further technological advancement by producing speciﬁcations for
high capacity WLANs for both mobile and ﬁxed wireless implementations.
In response to growing market pressure for low-cost, high capacity radio
links, ETSI established a standardization project for BRAN in Spring 1997. ETSI
BRAN is the successor of the former Sub-Technical Committee, RES10, which
developed the HiperLAN1 speciﬁcations.
The project prepares standards for equipment providing broadband (25
Mbit/s or more) wireless access to wire-based networks in both private and
public environments, operating in either licensed or license-exempt spectrum.
These systems address both business and residential applications. Fixed wireless
access systems are intended as high performance, quick to set up, competitive
alternatives for wire-based access systems.The speciﬁcations address the physical
(PHY) layer as well as the DLC layer (with medium access and logical data link

control sublayers as appropriate). Internetworking speciﬁcations that allow broad-
band radio systems to interface to existing wired networks, notably those based
on ATM,TCP/IP protocol suites, and UMTS, are or will be developed.
ETSI BRAN assists regulatory bodies with issues such as the requirements for
spectrum and the radio conformance speciﬁcations that will be required to
implement the new broadband radio networks.
To ensure overall coherence with other existing and emerging technologies,
close relationships have been or are being established with the ATM Forum, the
HiperLAN2 Global Forum, the IEEE Wireless LAN Committees 802.11a and
IEEE 802.16, the Internet Engineering Task Force, the MMAC-PC High Speed
Wireless Access Systems Group, the International Telecommunication Union
Radio sector (ITU-R), and a number of internal ETSI Technical Bodies.
ETSI BRAN currently produces speciﬁcations for four major wireless stan-
dard Areas, HiperLAN, and HiperLAN/2, which is a mobile broadband short-
range access network and HiperAccess, which is a ﬁxed wireless broadband access
network and HiperLink, which will provide short-range very high-speed inter-
connection of WLANs (see Table 2.5).

HiperLAN or High Performance Radio LAN, is a radio LAN standard designed
to provide high-speed communications (20 Mbps) between portable devices in
the 5 GHz range. It is intended to allow ﬂexible wireless data networks to be cre-
ated, without the need for an existing wired infrastructure. In addition, it can be
used as an extension of a wired LAN.The support of multimedia applications is
possible due to the higher bandwidth that this standard supports over IEEE’s
802.11 standard.

Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
HiperLAN/2
HiperLAN/2 is the next generation of HiperLAN WLAN technology that is
currently being developed by ETSI. It is an ATM-based wireless system, and the
new set of standards is incorporating many new features such as QoS,
Connection Oriented,Automatic Frequency Allocation, and High Speed
(exceeds 50 Mbps), which are new to HiperLAN.
HiperLAN/2 will give consumers in corporate, public, and home environ-
ments wireless access to the Internet and future multimedia, as well as real-time
video services at speeds of up to 54 Mbit/s.The system will be quick and easy to
install and provide internetworking with several core networks including the
Ethernet, RFC 1394, and ATM. HiperLAN/2 is able to operate at a speed up to
54 Mbps in the 5 GHz RF band. HiperLAN/2, in nature, is connection-ori-
ented, hence it is able to support to implement/support for QoS.
Another difference between HiperLAN/2 and HiperLAN/1 is the frequency
modulation scheme. HiperLAN/2 employs OFDM to modulate its data.The
advantages over OFDM over CSMA/CA, include higher data rate, less susceptible
to multiple path interference and co-channel interference.
The standard can support multibeam antennas (sectors) to improve the link
budget and to reduce interference in the radio network. It also deﬁnes a set of
protocols (measurements and signaling) to provide support for a number of radio
network functions, such as Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS), link adaptation,
handover, multibeam antennas, and power control, where the algorithms are
vendor-speciﬁc.The supported radio network functions allow cellular deploy-
ment of HiperLAN/2 systems with full coverage and high data rates in a wide
range of environments.The system shall automatically allocate frequencies to each
AP for communications.This is performed by the DFS, which allows several
operators to share the available spectrum by avoiding the use of interfered fre-
quencies.
To cope with the varying radio link quality (interference and propagation con-
ditions), a link adaptation scheme is used. It aims at keeping up a communications
link at low signal-to-interference ratios in order to maintain the QoS, and to trade
off between communications range and data rate. Based on link quality measure-
ments, the physical layer data rate is adapted to the current link quality.Transmitter
power control is supported in both the mobile terminal (uplink) and the AP
(downlink).The uplink power control is mainly used to simplify the design of the
AP receiver by avoiding automatic gain control at AP.The main goal of downlink
power control is to fulﬁll the regulatory requirements in Europe to decrease inter-

ference to other systems using the same 5 GHz band.The 5 GHz band is open in
Europe, the United States, and Japan.The current spectrum allocation at 5 GHz
comprises 455 MHz in Europe, 300 MHz in the U.S., and 100 MHz in Japan.
In parallel to the HiperLAN/2 standardization work, the Multimedia Mobile
Access Communications (MMAC) Association in Japan started to develop different
high-speed radio access systems for business and home applications at 5 GHz. One
of these systems for business applications in corporate and public networks is
aligned with HiperLAN/2 at both physical layer and DLC layer. In addition, the
PHY layer of IEEE 802.11 standard in the 5 GHz band is harmonized with that of
HiperLAN/2.With these alignments, the three communities succeeded to specify a
unique radio platform at 5 GHz, which supports the development of cost-efﬁcient
multimode terminals for world-wide high-speed communications.The ETSI
HiperLAN/2 functional speciﬁcations encompass the PHY layer, the DLC layer,
and the Convergence layers (CL) that perform service speciﬁc functions between
the DLC layer and the network layer. In other words, Speciﬁc Convergence sub-
layers are used on top of the HiperLAN/2 PHY and DLC layers to provide access
to networks such as IP,ATM, or UMTS.This makes HiperLAN/2 a multinetwork
air interface.
HiperAccess
The HiperAccess Standard Area produces standards for broadband multimedia
ﬁxed wireless access.The HiperAccess speciﬁcations will allow for a ﬂexible and
competitive alternative to wired access networks. It will be an interoperable stan-
dard, in order to promote a mass market and thereby low cost products. During
1999, signiﬁcant progress was made in the standardization process, for example, it
was decided that HiperAccess will be a point-to-multipoint system. HiperAccess
is targeting high frequency bands, especially it will be optimized for the 40.5 to
43.5 GHz band. For these frequency bands,TDMA will be used as multiple
access scheme, and a single carrier modulation scheme will be used.The creation
of speciﬁcations for frequencies below 11 GHz is currently under consideration.
ETSI BRAN, also known as ETSI Project BRAN or EP BRAN, is cooper-
ating closely with IEEE-SA (Working Group 802.16) to coordinate the interop-
erability standards for broadband multimedia ﬁxed wireless access networks.The
groups have appointed liaison ofﬁcers to each other, where the liaison ofﬁcer
from either party could attend all group meetings of the other and is provided all
group notices, and in addition, is eligible to provide input documents and to rec-
ommend document changes with the same privileges of a member. Furthermore,

copies of relevant working documents and drafts from either group will be made
available royalty-free to the other upon request.
HiperLink
This modiﬁcation of HiperAccess will provide short-range very high-speed inter-
connection of HiperLANs and HiperAccess, e.g. up to 155 Mbps over distances
up to 150 m. Spectrum for HiperLink is available in the 17 GHz range.As of this
writing, the work on this standard has not yet begun.
Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA)
To ensure that consumers can build interoperating 802.11 wireless networks, an
organization called the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA) tests
and certiﬁes 802.11 devices.Their symbol of approval means that the consumer
can be assured that the particular device has passed a thorough test of interopera-
tions with devices from other vendors.This is important when considering
devices to be implemented into your existing network, because if the devices
cannot communicate, it complicates the management of the network—in fact,
essentially you will have to deal with two autonomous networks. It is also impor-
tant when building a new network because you may be limited to a single
vendor.
They have announced the “wireless ﬁdelity” standard that is an awarded “seal
of approval” for those WLAN products that have successfully completed pre-
scribed interoperability testing.The Wi-Fi  seal (see Figure 2.17) is to provide
customers the assurance that products bearing this logo will work together.The
WECA group members include a growing number of the industry’s leading
WLAN manufacturers, including Cisco Systems.Wi-Fi has become synonymous
with 802.11 wireless technology in many articles related to the subject. However,
Wi-Fi is not a technology standard, it merely assures interoperability between
member manufacturers. In other words, you can have 802.11-compliant hardware
and still not be considered Wi-Fi.

WLAN Interoperability Forum (WLIF)
Extremely similar to WECA, the WLAN Interoperability Forum’s (WLIF) mis-
sion is to promote the use of WLANs through the delivery of interoperable prod-
ucts and services, at all levels of the market.The WLI Forum also bases its
interoperability testing on IEEE’s 802.11 standard.The popularity of WECA’s
standard has had signiﬁcant impact on the WLI Forum and its inﬂuence on the
wireless market has diminished rapidly.
Infrared Data Association
The Infrared Data Association (IrDA) is a standards organization comprised of a
consortium of leading U.S. and Japanese manufacturers of computers, communi-
cations equipment, and semiconductors, focused on developing standards for
infrared-based attachments for infrared wireless communication.Today, nearly all
consumer electronic devices that use infrared as a method of wireless communi-
cation are IrDA compliant. Most laptops sold are equipped with an IrDA-com-
pliant infrared transceiver, which enables you to communicate with devices such
as printers, modems, fax, LAN, and other laptops.Typical infrared devices use a
transmission method known as diffused infrared transmission whereby the receiver
and transmitter do not have to be aimed at each other and do not need a clear
line-of-sight. Range is up to about ten meters only (in-building) and speeds are
anywhere from 2400 bps to 4 Mbps.

Chapter 2 • Wireless LAN Overview
Summary
Radio technology is the basis for Cisco Aironet wireless LANs. It consists of elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds, radiation, frequency, and modulation to move information car-
rying radio signals through space.
An electromagnetic ﬁeld is generated by applying alternating electric current
(AC) to a conductive material such as a wire or antenna.The number of times
per second that the electromagnetic ﬁeld cycles or alternates is called frequency,
and it is measured in units known as Hertz. For example, if an electromagnetic
ﬁeld alternates 9,000 times per second, it would be measured as 9 KHz.
Frequency and wavelength are interrelated.As the frequency increases, the wave-
length of the signal decreases.The movement of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
through space is called electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation
allows radio signals to travel from a transmitting antenna to a receiving antenna.
Electromagnetic radiation travels at the speed of light or 186,000 miles per
second.This radiation becomes weaker or less powerful as the distance increases
from its source. Because all radio signals move at the speed, regardless of fre-
quency, the wavelength of a signal with a higher frequency passes a receiving
antenna more frequently.
Receiving antennas are typically passive, they intercept part of the electro-
magnetic radiation as it passes the antenna.The part of the signal that is inter-
cepted is ﬁltered of unwanted signals to isolate the intended signal for that
receiver.The intended signal is the signal transmitted at a predetermined fre-
quency from a transmitting antenna and received on that same frequency on a
receiving antenna. Once the isolated signal is received, it must be demodulated to
access the information or data being sent from the transmitting antenna that
modulated the signal to begin with. Modulation is the technique used to impress
information (data) onto the signal and determines the amount of information
that can be contained within it. In general, the more complex the modulation
technique is, the more information that can be carried in the signal. However, the
more complex a modulation technique is, the more time or latency is introduced
to de-modulate the signal. Complimentary Code Keying (CCK) is a phase mod-
ulation technique used by most 802.11b wireless devices, including Cisco Aironet
devices.
The wireless LAN technology used in most current WLAN devices is called
spread spectrum.There are two types of spread spectrum technology: direct
sequence and frequency hopping. Cisco Aironet devices use Direct Sequence
Spread Spectrum (DSSS), which uses a range of frequencies to “spread” the signal
www.syngress.com

Wireless LAN Overview • Chapter 2
89
out and a unique spread spectrum code from device to device to ensure that no
conﬂicts arise from multiple devices transmitting in the same area.The receiving
device must know the transmitting device’s spread spectrum code in order to
decode the transmission.
Wireless LAN architecture consists of both physical and logical wireless
system components.The logical components are the distribution system (DS),
medium access technology, synchronization and error control, routing mecha-
nisms, and application interface.The physical components are the medium, access
point (AP), antenna, wireless station, and server.
Cisco Aironet wireless LAN devices are designed based on industry standards
created by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE). Speciﬁcally
the 802.11 working group of the IEEE is responsible for generating the standards
to encompass all aspects of wireless local area networking. IEEE 802.11b is a rati-
ﬁed standard added to the original 802.11 standard to address a physical layer
change that supports higher speeds of 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps.The 802.11 stan-
dard deﬁnes the physical and data link components of a wireless local area net-
work.The standard also addresses WLAN security, power management, multicell
roaming capabilities, and other integral components of the WLAN.The European
community has similar wireless standards, developed by the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). Some of ETSI’s standards were
developed independently, whereas others were developed cooperatively with the
IEEE. ETSI’s standards encompass many of the same components addressed in
the IEEE’s standard.

Q: The clear beneﬁt of WLANs will be the ability to roam physically around an
area, as well as logically from one AP to another.What is the speciﬁed stan-
dard for how this is done, and does it integrate with existing login mecha-
nisms?
A: The IEEE standards working groups are developing a roaming model that
will provide the means to support the roaming of users from one wireless AP
to another.At present, most solutions require re-authentication when moving
from one wireless AP to another.Vendors who provide a managed roaming
capability have developed their own roaming management, which may or
may not interface with other WLAN vendor solutions.
Q: When will wireless speeds catch up to current wired speed technologies?
A: Formation of the newer 802.11a standard is driving increased wireless speeds
to the 50 Mbit range and are currently becoming available to the consumer.
Though this speed increase is welcome, it still is not up to the current 100
Mbit wired speed prevalent in today’s networks. Many factors, such as market
drivers, frequency allocations, and technology development, will be key to
bringing wireless speeds up to wired speeds.
Q: Why would I use ﬁber for my wired network in place of copper?
A: Fiber is commonly used in high-speed backbone connections and emerging
technologies such as Gigabit Ethernet and Dense Wave Division Multiplexing

backbone of the network may be ﬁber-based and user connections are
copper-based.

Chapter 3 • Cisco Wireless LAN Product Line
Introduction
As you saw in Chapter 2, the wireless local area network (WLAN) is exactly
what it sounds like, a network that is connected primarily through wireless tech-
nology. It provides all of the features of a conventional wired LAN (such as
Ethernet) without the need to have wired connections to each device. But that is
only half of the story;WLANs have the potential to revolutionize how network
connectivity is viewed. Using wireless technologies, individual users can connect
to the network without the need for cabling to be pulled to their desks.This not
only gives the users the ability to move around with their laptops and personal
digital assistants (PDAs), it also allows for easy migration of desktop machines
during the inevitable ofﬁce “reorganization.” Beyond the local user level, wireless
technologies also offer the capability to connect a remote workgroup without the
need to trench and install cabling or order carrier services such as a T1. If condi-
tions are correct, the Cisco WLAN technology set can connect this remote
workgroup at speeds up to 11 Mbps even if they are located miles away.
In addition to the potential of providing long-term infrastructure beneﬁts and
cost savings, you can also use WLANs to quickly bring up connectivity in the
event of a disaster or unexpected move. For example, if your company’s ofﬁce
space was ﬂooded, but the warehouse was spared, you can install Cisco’s WLAN
technologies in the warehouse and move the PCs into this space, thus giving
access to the network to all PCs within range.This alleviates the need to run new
cabling to support this temporary conﬁguration until the ofﬁce space is repaired.
This solution also allows for easy addition or relocation of machines as the needs
in this temporary ofﬁce space changes.
Once considered cost-prohibitive, sluggish, and proprietary, today’s WLAN
products are now reasonably high-speed (currently 11 Mbps but moving for-
ward), working toward a standards based, and priced for many businesses to con-
sider its use. Cisco Systems built itself on the fact that in modern ofﬁces every
worker needs to be connected to the LAN, and more often than not, to the
Internet. Cisco also realized that there are some issues with the traditional wired
network, such as distance limitations, or cost effectiveness where it may not be
possible or practical to cable the entire workspace for intermittent connectivity.
This is especially common in warehouses, public places, and in conference rooms.
In these instances, it makes a lot of sense to install a wireless network that can
support connectivity to all areas of your business. Cisco WLANs will allow you
to cover every inch of your site and allow users to be more productive.

WLANs have been available for several years now, but they were relatively
slow, most were unable to exceed the 1.5 Mbps throughput barrier.As such,
wireless was used only for small bandwidth applications, such as inventory-scan-
ning systems most warehouses and retailers use.This began to change when the
Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA) committee was formed.The
main goal of WECA was to create new products that were faster, more compat-
ible, and cheaper to deploy and maintain.They wanted to make wireless net-
working more practical for use in the modern technology world, and allow users
that were unable to connect before the chance to use this new technology.
One of the ﬁrst things WECA did was create a standard they called Wi-Fi, an
interoperability certiﬁcation, to verify interoperability and ease of deployment.
This, in conjunction with the “global” acceptance of the 802.11b standard, helped
reassure users that wireless equipment would function within their existing infra-
structure and be supported for the long term.
Cisco is one of the vendors that embraced this standard and worked on
making the Cisco Aironet series compliant with WECA standards.Though two
primary mediums exist for wireless data transport, infrared light (IR) or radio fre-
quency (RF), the one we focus on is RF. RF is more prevalent, can handle a
wider coverage area, is capable of higher bandwidth, and has a longer range. In
addition, the Aironet line of devices support a RF signal; speciﬁcally a signal in
the 2.4 GHz range.The 2.4 GHz frequency is the only range of the RF spec-
trum that is available (worldwide) for the use of unlicensed devices.
Overview of Cisco Wireless Systems
In November, 1999, Cisco purchased one of the leading companies in the ﬁeld of
wireless technology (Aironet Wireless Communications, Inc.) in an effort to catch
up to other vendors who already had a head start in the ﬁeld.Aironet was a
leading developer of high-speed WLAN products and played an important role
on the IEEE 802.11 working group.
Cisco WLAN Product Line
In this section, we discuss the various products in the Cisco WLAN product line.
Cisco makes a varied offering in the wireless arena.We talk about the differences
between product lines and what role each plays in your network.We discuss the
Cisco Aironet 340, 350, and several other products that are necessary to make
your WLAN function properly.

Chapter 3 • Cisco Wireless LAN Product Line
You can manage Cisco devices remotely, with Web browsers,Telnet sessions,
and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).Through these connec-
tions, you can also monitor statistics from the devices.You can also map the wire-
less access points (AP) to their associated clients, and monitor those clients.The
APs also allow you to control the throughput of trafﬁc through the WLAN using
Media Access Control (MAC) and protocol-based ﬁlters. If you have multiple APs
deployed in your network, you can also conﬁgure these devices at a central loca-
tion and manage them through the network.This allows you to maintain a con-
sistent policy throughout the network.
One of Cisco’s driving objectives is to create a seamless environment where
users can utilize their network while moving from ofﬁce to ofﬁce and from the
ofﬁce to the conference room. Users are able to use their mobile devices (PDAs,
handheld PCs, and notebooks) anywhere within range of the wireless network
without connecting via a cable of any sort. In addition, Cisco wanted to create a
solution for connecting a campus environment or even a metropolitan area
together in a reliable and relatively inexpensive manner.The result of this evolution
is two different solution sets. One geared toward the individual user and an ofﬁce
space environment and one geared toward building-to-building connectivity.
There are two main types of devices on a WLAN: the AP and the bridge.The
AP is a device that connects the wired LAN to the WLAN, and allows the data
to go from one media to the other.The APs connect to the wired LAN through
a hub or a switch and contain encryption and communication software, as well as
the radio transceiver.A second device is needed to operate with the AP:The
LAN adapter that is used by the client device.This NIC is usually a PC card that
works in your portable device or a card that is installed in your desktop PC.The
client device normally has some type of antenna that can interact with the AP.
The second wireless device type is a wireless bridge. Much like its wired
namesake, a wireless bridge is a WLAN device that connects two or more remote
networks into a single LAN.The Aironet wireless Ethernet bridge is designed to
support three connection types: 10Base2 (Thinnet), 10Base5 (Thicknet), or
10BaseT (twisted pair).As you will see, the Aironet 340 series bridges have
10Base-T,AUI and coaxial connection, but the Aironet 350 series devices have
only an RJ-45 connection.
Using WLANs for Individual User Connectivity
Seeing WLANs implemented in place of the conventional wired network is more
common today than ever before. In most cases, this transition is not all or
nothing. Usually, the WLANs are used in conjunction with the wired network.To

allow devices access to the wireless network, Cisco makes Personal Computer
Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) cards, Personal Computer
Interface (PCI) cards, and Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) client adapters.
These cards have the capability to talk directly to each other or can be used with
an AP. In this scenario,APs perform the same function a hub would perform in a
wired network.
As was mentioned before, this conﬁguration allows users the freedom to
remain connected to the network even when moving from place to place. In
addition, this conﬁguration allows for PCs to be placed in locations that are difﬁ-
cult to get cable run to, such as a factory ﬂoor, or an open space. Finally, the APs
allow for the use of pass-through DHCP services to allow existing DHCP servers
to handle requests, or in some cases can act as the DHCP server itself.
As with any new technology, you need to consider certain issues when using
a WLAN in an ofﬁce environment. First and foremost among these issues is secu-
rity.With a conventional wired network, you really did not have to worry about
someone walking into your ofﬁce, going to your Intermediate Distribution
Frame (IDF) and plugging his or her laptop into your network. However, in a
wireless environment, if you do not address security up front, someone can essen-
tially do just that.You can ﬁnd more detail on how to secure your WLAN in
Chapter 8.The second concern in using wireless systems is interoperability
between vendors. If you are just using a basic setup, interoperability between ven-
dors should not be an issue. However, many vendors provide proprietary solu-
tions to “enhance” their products.Therefore, be sure to do an appropriate amount
of research if you plan to implement a multivendor wireless solution. In addition
to these issues, the range and signal strength of the AP as well as each individual
station needs to be taken into account.
Using WLANs to Connect Campuses
As was stated earlier, the WLAN can be an effective alternative to traditional
copper and ﬁber conﬁgurations for connecting two buildings together or for
connecting to remote facilities in the same building.This is especially true if you
need to connect two locations that would require you to traverse an area that
cannot be easily accessed, such as a river or lake, a railroad right of way, or a
highway.A wireless bridge is an upfront investment that you can install in a small
amount of time and use almost immediately. Depending upon distance, the band-
width could be anywhere from about equal to a T1 to a little more than seven
times (11 Mbps) faster.Theoretically, using Cisco Wireless technology you can
span a distance of up to 25 miles. In reality, this distance is probably less than that,
www.syngress.com

98
Chapter 3 • Cisco Wireless LAN Product Line
and before attempting any wireless connection, you should test to ensure that the
signal strength is appropriate.
Because you are using a LAN technology, you have the same set of alterna-
tives when making connections between remote locations as you would in a con-
ventional LAN environment.That is you can either directly bridge two parts of a
subnet together to put the user devices in a single broadcast domain, or you can
connect the wireless bridges directly into router ports to create a point-to-point
Ethernet connection.
As was the case with the APs, using the bridges to connect campus buildings
can be a security risk, and you need to take appropriate steps to ensure that
“passers-by” cannot see your network trafﬁc or connect to the network. In addi-
tion to this concern, environmental issues can create more of a problem in a
building-to-building installation.Weather and other obstacles can affect the
overall signal quality, thus creating the potential for outages.
www.syngress.com
Third Generation Networks and Mobile Users
What are third generation (3G) networks? 3G networks are those that
are based on open standards that utilize Internet Protocol (IP). Cisco has
created a group that was speciﬁcally targeted to work with mobile
users, the Mobile Wireless Group (MWG). The MWG interfaces with
clients in an effort to address concerns that can arise from the deploy-
ment of wireless technologies. Mainly the MWG works on helping to
streamline the wireless network for optimal data trafﬁc transfer and
integrating the system with existing core technologies that are already
in place.
3G is also supported by the Mobile Wireless Internet Forum (MWIF)
and several other standards organizations. By using a common IP core
as the basis of 3G, it is able to scale efﬁciently and can be used by stan-
dard company implementations while transitioning from second gener-
ation networks. Second generation networks were considered
voice-centric, whereas 3G networks are considered to be more a multi-
service network that can support not only voice and data, but can also
carry multimedia through the deployment of a multivendor-based
packet infrastructure.

Cisco Aironet 3X0 
Series APs and Bridges
Three main pieces of hardware go into a successful wireless installation: a base
unit (AP or bridge), NIC cards (if you are using an AP), and an antenna.The base
units that Cisco offers are detailed in this section, and the NIC cards and
antennas are detailed in later sections.
Cisco Aironet 3X0 series APs and bridges consist of the Cisco Aironet 350
and Cisco Aironet 340 series. In this section, we discuss several of the features
that are inherent in both and several of the differences between these two plat-
forms.We also discuss the usage of Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) for
frequency bands and the authentication such as Remote Authentication Dial-In
User Service (RADIUS), which you can use so that your wireless network is
secure from outsiders.We also begin to discuss the Aironet series client software
in this section. For more information on the client software that is available for
APs and wireless bridges, see Chapters 5 and 6.
The Cisco Aironet 350 Series
The ﬁrst of the product line that we look at is the 350 series. Cisco has designed
the Aironet 350 series to meet the needs of mobile users and satellite ofﬁces so
that they can maintain connectivity and have the freedom to move around and
the ﬂexibility to grow. In this section of the chapter, we ﬁrst discuss the features
that are common to all of the 350 series product line and then discuss the indi-
vidual product types that are available.
Features Common to All 350 Series Devices
As previously stated, the 350 is designed to support a wide array of wireless
devices, such as PCs, PDAs, handheld PCs, printers, point of sale devices, manage-
ment and monitoring equipment, and just about anything else. Some of the items
that make the 350 so popular are that it has the highest transmit power (100 mil-
liwatt) in its class, is highly sensitive for receiving transmissions from other units,
can be powered inline, and allows for centralized security.
The Cisco Aironet 350 is IEEE 802.11b–compliant so that it will interoperate
with other vendor devices within your range of coverage. Because it is part of
Cisco’s offering, they have worked hard on integrating the wireless devices into
their network devices. One nice feature of the 350 platforms is that it comes

bundled with software that installs on a laptop, and you can use it to map out the
strength of the wireless signal in your environment.
The 350 can support a variety of features depending on the version of bridge
or access point (AP) ﬁrmware that you have installed, such as the following:
■
Accounting  This feature allows for collection of data from wireless
devices that are located on your network.You can also establish a collec-
tion center for this data and enable accounting on the bridge or AP by
using RADIUS servers located on the network.This feature is available
in ﬁrmware version 11.10T and above.

ture allows for the capability to add WEP keys for greater security.Three
advanced security features can enable you to enhance the security of
your wireless network that are built into these devices.They are WEP
key hashing, Broadcast WEP key rotation, and Message Integrity Check
(MIC).These features are available in ﬁrmware version 11.10T and
above.This is also covered more in-depth in Chapter 8.
■
LEAP (Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol) to
authenticate nonroot bridges  This feature will allow the nonroot
bridges to authenticate to the network so that they can receive and use
dynamic WEP keys.This feature is available in ﬁrmware version 11.10T
and above.This is also covered more in depth in Chapter 8.
■
Software Image Management (SWIM) tool  If you are also using
CiscoWorks 2000, you can also have advanced software management—
you can use this tool to enhance the level of management on your 
wireless network.The SWIM tool is located within the Resource
Management Essentials (RME) section of CiscoWorks 2000.The SWIM
allows you to manage AP and bridge ﬁrmware from a centralized loca-
tion.This feature is available in ﬁrmware version 11.08 and above.
■
Publicly Secure Packet Forwarding (PSPF) to block inter-client
communication PSPF enables you to prevent devices that are located
on the wireless network from unintentionally sharing data with other
devices that are located on the same network. PSPF will allow you to
give Internet access to the devices and disallow them from the network, if
you wish.When PSPF is conﬁgured, it will not allow client devices to
transmit directly to other clients that are located on the WLAN in a peer-
to-peer manner.You will most often see this feature enabled in campus

environments, such as college campuses, airport terminals, and coffee
houses.This feature is available in ﬁrmware version 11.08 and above.
There are also some features that are not dependant on the ﬁrmware revision
that you are using; the client software will also allow you to have the following:
■
Observation of the activity on the radio transmitter  This is
accomplished through the carrier test tool, which measures the amount
of radio activity (not radioactivity, as in nuclear fallout) on each frequency
that is used by the bridge or AP. Using this tool will allow you to con-
ﬁgure the bridge or AP to use the most efﬁcient frequency available.
■
Antenna alignment tool  This tool will assist you in the alignment of
your antenna so that you can receive the best signal quality between
your bridge or AP and other wireless devices.
■
Port Assignment  You can assign ports for speciﬁc use, so that you can
maintain consistency throughout your network environment.
■
Bridge location detection  This tool will assist you in ﬁnding the
location of a speciﬁc bridge that is located within the wireless network.
■
Bridge association limits  This allows you to limit the number of
devices that the bridge will accept.
■
Integrated network management  Cisco wireless devices can utilize
Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) to improve the efﬁciency of your net-
work monitoring. CDP will also allow you to browse other Cisco (and
miscellaneous) network equipment located on the network.
■
Security  You can conﬁgure your wireless bridge or AP to restrict
access to a group of users.You could encrypt the data with WEP.You can
also use EAP/LEAP with MAC-based authentication and use a
RADIUS server to control access to the network (you could then add a
backup RADIUS server for redundancy).
■
Filtering  You can create ﬁlters that will allow or prevent speciﬁc pro-
tocols to be used through the bridge or AP.You can also control the for-
warding of trafﬁc from the bridge or AP with unicast and multicast
ﬁltering.
■
Hot standby  You can assign a bridge to be the backup rugged AP, so
that you can provide redundancy and reliability in case of AP failure.
■
World mode  This setting allows for the connection of wireless devices
to occur no matter where in the world you are located (as long as there

is wireless coverage in that area).What this means is that a visitor from
Europe could travel to America, and the wireless device could associate
itself with a wireless bridge or AP and conﬁgure itself to work with the
correct channel settings.
■
Automatic load balancing  The bridge will automatically direct
client devices to an AP that will allow them the best connection.This is
accomplished through a number of factors, such as the transmission rate,
the signal strength, and the number of currently connected users.
■
Rugged APs  This allows you to conﬁgure the bridge as a rugged AP
for coverage purposes.

Cisco Aironet AP Safety
The FCC has adopted a safety standard for human exposure to radio fre-
quency (RF) electromagnetic energy that is emitted by FCC certiﬁed
equipment. The Cisco Aironet WLAN products are considered to be
within the uncontrolled environmental limits for these safety standards.
The proper operation for this radio device is outlined in the instructions
that you’ll ﬁnd in the manual included with the device and in the hard-
ware installation guide located on the Cisco Aironet AP and Bridge CD.
This guide recommends the following:
■You should not touch or move the antenna(s) while the unit
is transmitting or receiving data.
■You should not hold any component of the radio devices so
that the antenna is very close to or touching any exposed parts
of your body, especially the face or eyes, when transmitting.
■You should not operate the radio device near unshielded
blasting caps or in an explosive environment.
■You should not operate the radio or attempt to transmit data
unless the antenna is connected. If you try do use this device
without the antenna, the radio may be damaged.
■Be sure to adjust the antenna so that it is at least 8 inches
(20 centimeters) away from your body at all times.

The Cisco Aironet 350 APs are powered inline.This means that they receive
their power through Ethernet cables.This Ethernet cable can be up to 300 feet in
length.Therefore, you do not need a power cord for the unit.You can power the
350 in three ways:
■
A powered patch panel
■
A switch that is capable of inline power (the Cisco Catalyst 3524, 4000,
and the 6500)
■
A Cisco Aironet power injector (designed for the Aironet 350 line)
NOTE
The Cisco Aironet power injector is for use only with the 350 series
bridges and APs. If you use the injector with other Ethernet devices, you
could cause damage to them. Also, the injector is not rated for use in
places within a buildings environmental air space, like above a sus-
pended ceiling.
Individual 350 Series Device Features
The 350 series product line has three base models: APs, wireless bridges, and work-
group bridges. In general, you use APs to connect any wireless PCs, PDAs, or like
devices to the network. In most instances, the AP is used in combination with
existing wired infrastructure.The wireless bridges are used to connect disparate
parts of the network together.Whether that is to connect two different ofﬁce
spaces in the same building or to connect two buildings together, the concept is
still the same. Finally, the workgroup bridges are used to connect smaller remote
ofﬁces back to a central location.The workgroup bridge will allow for up to
eight Ethernet-connected (wired not wireless) devices to be connected via wire-
less to the central wired network. It should be noted that the workgroup bridge
only has one 10BaseT port, so if more than one device needs to connect to it; an
intermediary hub or switch will be needed.You would then connect this hub or
switch the port on the bridge allowing up to eight stations to access the wireless
connection.

Chapter 3 • Cisco Wireless LAN Product Line
350 Series AP
As was mentioned before, the 350 series AP is designed to connect individual
users using some format of wireless NIC card to the network.The AP then
allows this trafﬁc to be converted to travel across the wired LAN or to another
wireless segment. In addition, by using multiple APs together, users are able to
seamlessly travel between coverage areas.
The 350 series APs come in a normal plastic case model and a sturdier metal
case or “rugged” model.The rugged model is designed to be used in environ-
mental airspace or areas that require plenum-rated equipment.As such, the
rugged model has a wider range of operating temperatures, –4 to 131 degrees
Fahrenheit (–20 to 55 degrees Celsius), compared to the plastic case models, 32
to 122 degrees Fahrenheit (0 to 50 degrees Celsius).Also, if an inline power
injector is used, it is not plenum-rated and has an even smaller operating range,
32 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit (0 to 40 degrees Celsius).Therefore, you will need
to ensure the location of the power injector meets these requirements. In addi-
tion to the regular or rugged versions, you can also get APs with two nonremov-
able 2.2 dBi diversity dipole antennas or two external, removable 2.2 dBi dipole
antennas with RP-TNC connectors if you plan on installing you own antenna.
(Chapter 9 provides more information on RP-TNC connectors.)
In order to ensure that the uplink connection is not a bottleneck in the con-
ﬁguration, the 350 series APs are equipped with an auto-sensing 10/100BaseT
Ethernet uplink port.This uses standard RJ-45 connectors and UTP cabling. For
connecting to the wireless clients, the AP will communicate at either 1, 2, 5.5, or
11 Mbps depending on signal strength and quality. Depending on the speed of
the connection, the AP will use different modulation settings.These settings are
shown in Table 3.1, but in general, these modulation techniques are optimized to
ﬁt the signal characteristics that are present in their operating speed.As such, the
Differential Binary Phase Shift Keying (DBPSK) and the Differential Quadrature
Phase Shift Keying (DQPSK) modulation techniques are similar in structure and
are quite different from the Complementary Code Keying (CCK) technique that
is used for the 5.5 and 11 Mbps transmission. No matter which modulation tech-
nique is used, the wireless transmission with the APs; the methodology used for
the transmission is Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum. DSSS uses the entire fre-
quency band for transmission of the data, thus allowing for higher throughput
than if just one of the frequencies was used.As is the case with most wireless sys-
tems, the AP acts as a hub, and as such must deal with collisions.To do this, the
AP uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) as
the MAC protocol. For more information on the 350 AP, see Table 3.1.

CSMA/CD versus CSMA/CA
In an Ethernet environment, it is just a matter of fact that collisions
occur on a regular basis, and you need a way to deal with them. As you
are already aware, in a wired Ethernet environment, you can address col-
lisions by moving to a device that supports full duplex communication,
or if that is not a feasible option, by allowing the standard collision

control mechanism, Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision
Detection (CSMA/CD) standard to take care of the collision.
In a Cisco wireless setting, there is no option for full duplex com-
munication to eliminate the possibility of collisions, so that leaves a
manner of dealing with collisions to a separate methodology. The
methodology employed in a wired Ethernet setting, CSMA/CD, relies on
the fact that every station on segment can hear every other station on
the segment to determine if there is a collision. In a wireless setting the
AP is usually the only station that can hear and communicate to every
station on the wireless network. As you can see in Figure 3.1,
Workstation A can send and receive directly from the AP, as can
Workstation B. However, Workstation A does not have the signal
strength to send or receive any data directly from Workstation B. As a
result, using CSMA/CD in this instance would not work because
Workstation A could not tell if there was a collision with Workstation B
trafﬁc and vice versa.
To solve this problem, Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision
Avoidance (CSMA/CA) is used in the wireless environment. With
CSMA/CA the workstation that wants to transmit ﬁrst listens to see if
another station is transmitting. If the workstation senses that there is no
one transmitting it begins sending its packet. It is the receiver’s respon-
sibility to send back an ACK packet to the transmitter stating that the
packet was received. If the transmitting workstation does not receive an
ACK it assumes there was a collision (or error) and retransmits the
packet.

350 Series Bridge
Unlike the AP, the 350 series bridge comes only in the rugged, metal case, ver-
sion.As a result, all of the 350 series bridges are plenum-rated and as such can be
installed in environmental air space.They also inherit the larger operating tem-
perature range, –4 to 131 degrees Fahrenheit (–20 to 55 degrees Celsius).This
extended range also allows you to install them in appropriate National Electrical
Manufacturers Association (NEMA) enclosures outdoors. (You can ﬁnd more
information on NEMA enclosures in Chapter 9.) Note that because the 350
series bridges are powered by inline power through the Ethernet cable, the power
supply used in most cases will not be plenum-rated nor have the same operating
temperature range. Because the power supply can be up to 300 feet away; in most
installations this is not an issue.
In most cases, the bridges are used in a point-to-point conﬁguration, however
they do have the capability for point-to-multipoint conﬁgurations as well. No
antennas are supplied with the bridge; instead it comes with two RP-TNC con-
nectors that can be attached to an existing antenna.As was the case with the AP, the
only uplink port on the 350 series bridge is an auto-sensing 10/100BaseT Ethernet
port.Also similar to the 350 AP, the bridge uses DSSS as the wireless medium, and
can transmit at 1, 2, 5.5, or 11 Mbps depending on signal strength and quality.
CSMA/CA is used for the MAC protocol. Finally, the maximum range (depending
on antenna and environmental conditions) is up to 25 miles at 2 Mbps, or 18 miles
at 11 Mbps. See Table 3.2 for more information about the 350 series bridge.

If the workstation senses another workstation already transmitting,
it waits until that transmission is complete, then waits a set amount of
time to allow for the transmission of the ACK packet, and then waits a
random amount of time longer before beginning its transmission.

The 350 series workgroup bridge is speciﬁcally designed to connect a small number
(up to eight) of hard-wired attached Ethernet stations to an AP. Because the 350
series workgroup bridge has only one uplink port; if you need to connect more
than one device through it, you need to use an external hub or switch.Though the
wireless connection usually takes place within a building, it can also be done
between buildings. Figure 3.2 shows a typical workgroup bridge conﬁguration.

In many respects, the workgroup bridge is very similar to the other members
of the 350 series family. It uses DSSS as the wireless medium, uses CSMA/CA as
the MAC protocol, and can communicate at 1, 2, 5.5, or 11 Mbps. However,
there are a couple differences as well.The 350 series workgroup bridge does not
use inline power.The uplink port on the workgroup bridge is only a 10BaseT
uplink, not a 10/100BaseT uplink.This design characteristic was chosen due to
the limited number of workstations that it can support. In addition, because it is
in general designed for indoor use, the workgroup bridge comes only in a plastic
case model, therefore, it is not plenum-rated.Also, its operating temperature
matches that of the plastic case AP, 32 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit (0 to 50 degrees
Celsius).Two antenna options are available for the 350 workgroup bridge, a single
nonremovable 2.2 dBi dipole antenna, or two RP-TNC connectors with no sup-
plied antennas. For more information on the 350 series workgroup bridge, see

Chapter 3 • Cisco Wireless LAN Product Line
Features of the Cisco Aironet 340 Series
The 340 series of wireless devices closely resemble that of the 350 series. Because
the feature set that is available with the 340 series line is essentially the same,
please refer to the list in the earlier section “Features Common to all 350 Series
Devices.” One if the differences between the two product lines are that the 340
line has an additional device not included in the 350 product line. Called a base
station, this component is described in greater detail later in the section “The
Cisco Aironet 340 Series Base Station.” In addition, none of the 340 series prod-
ucts support the inline power that the 350 series products support. Other differ-
ences are covered in the sections detailing each product.
Individual 340 Series Device Features
All of the product groups for the 340 series products are detailed in the following
sections.The products that are available in the 340 line are APs, wireless bridges,
workgroup bridges, and base stations.The information on the NIC cards avail-
able, as well as the antenna options, are covered in subsequent sections.
The Cisco Aironet 340 Series AP
The design of the 340 series AP allows individual users to connect to the net-
work using some format of wireless NIC.The AP then converts this trafﬁc into a
format that allows it to travel across the wired LAN or to another wireless seg-
ment. In addition, by using multiple APs together, users are able to seamlessly
travel between coverage areas.
Like the 350 series APs, the 340 series AP use CSMA/CA as the MAC pro-
tocol for the wireless connection. It also uses DSSS as the wireless medium.
Transmission speeds are also the same at 1, 2, 5.5, or 11 Mbps using DBPSK,
DQPSK, and CCK modulation based on transmission speed. In addition, the 340
series AP comes with an auto-sensing 10/100BaseT Ethernet port for connecting
to the wired network.
There is no rugged version of the 340 series AP, and none of these APs are
plenum-rated. In addition, the operating temperature range matches that of the
plastic case 350 series AP at 32 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit (0 to 50 degrees
Celsius).All of the 340 series line of APs can be connected to 110-volt power
source, and a couple models also support 220-volts.Another difference between
the 340 series APs and the 350 series is that the 340 series does not support
TFTP for management purposes. It supports only Telnet, HTTP, FTP, and SNMP.
Three antenna choices are available for the 340 series AP.You can get a single

nonremovable 2.2 dBi diversity dipole antenna, two redundant nonremovable 2.2
dBi diversity dipole antennas, or two RP-TNC connectors with no antenna sup-
plied, if you plan to install you own antenna. Finally, though most of the 340 line
supports 128-bit, a few models support only 40-bit encryption, so if security is
important in your installation, be sure to verify the encryption level and other
security features before ordering. For more information on the 340 series APs,

As was the case with the 350 series bridge, the 340 series bridge is designed to
either connect multiple buildings in a campus or metropolitan area together or to
connect two LANs together that are in the same building. In most cases, you would
also install an external antenna to boost the signal that bridge sends and receives.

Chapter 3 • Cisco Wireless LAN Product Line
Most of the features of the 340 series bridge are the same as the 340 series
AP.Therefore, items such as data rates, wireless medium, MAC protocol, modula-
tion, and power are shown in Table 3.5 but not speciﬁcally discussed here. One
item that is different between the 340 AP and bridge is the uplink port.The 340
series bridge has support for 10Base2, 10Base5, and 10BaseT wired connections.
This allows you to easily integrate the 340 bridge into an older network that has
not been upgraded to 10/100BaseT Ethernet.You will also notice that that the
operating temperature range of the 340 series bridge, –4 to 122 degrees
Fahrenheit (–20 to 50 degrees Celsius), is close to that of the rugged version of
the 350 series bridge.This gives you the ﬂexibility to install the bridge in a loca-
tion that has higher temperature variations.The rest of the information regarding
the bridge is detailed in Table 3.5.

10BaseT RJ-45 connector, so if you want to use it to connect multiple devices,
you will need to also use a hub or switch as a concentrator for these devices. (This
concept is illustrated in Figure 3.2 in the 350 series section).The remaining details

The Cisco Aironet 340 Series Base Station
The Cisco Aironet 340 Series Base Station is designed to provide wireless con-
nectivity to the Internet for telecommuters and small ofﬁces. If you install a wire-
less client into a device, it can connect to a home or small ofﬁce wired network
through the Cisco Aironet 340 Series Base Station.
The base station can be connected to the Internet through a cable modem or
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) connection with an Ethernet RJ-45 port (see
Figure 3.3).The unit can support a recommended limit of approximately 10
simultaneous devices (but could be more or less, it depends entirely on bandwidth

users so that they can share computer peripherals and access the Internet with the
least amount of equipment.There is also a base station that has a 56K v.90 dialup
modem integrated within it.
The unit is also capable of performing Network Access Translation (NAT)
and Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) so that you can automati-
cally conﬁgure an IP address range for multiple users.This will allow all users of
the wireless network to share a single Internet connection and allow additional
users to be added without the complication and expense of readdressing the net-
work. However, the roaming feature that is available with APs is not available in
the base station. Complete details are shown in Table 3.7.

Cisco Aironet Wireless NICs
You would normally ﬁnd network interface cards, or adapters, installed inside
your desktop computer or server. In the case of portable and notebook com-
puters, the NIC is, more often than not a credit card-sized PCMCIA card that is
connected through a PCMCIA slot. Cisco makes NICs that support wireless net-
working, using radio technology to transmit a signal through the air, instead of
over a wired connection.These NICs offer the same functionality as a traditional
wired NIC, preparing data for transmissions from your PC to the network.
There are three major types of network cards:
■
Industry-Standard Architecture (ISA)
■
PCMCIA (also called PC Cards) for laptops and notebooks
■
Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)
With the PCI and ISA adapters, you can connect desktops to the network
without the need to run cables to each station.As your number of users grow, or
change locations within the network, you will be able to maintain connectivity
and therefore productivity.The users will not sacriﬁce performance, because the
11 Mbps should be sufﬁcient to handle many of the data-intensive applications
that the users need.
The PC adapters have dual internal antennas that will automatically select 
the strongest signal so that it can maintain the most efﬁcient connection.The
external antenna is designed for transmission from a ﬁxed system, and it is
designed to take up a small amount of space.The Cisco Aironet Client Adapter

is a ﬁxed solution that works in conjunction with 11 Mbps Cisco Aironet Series
APs and bridges.These adapters are designed for DSSS technology and operate at
2.4 GHz.All Cisco wireless client adapters comply with the IEEE 802.11b stan-
dard, so that they can ensure that your devices with work correctly with other
WLAN products using this standard.
In addition, many Cisco adaptors support a feature called world mode.When
an adapter is conﬁgured for this mode, it will automatically inherit channel con-
ﬁguration properties directly from the Cisco Aironet AP to which they associate.
This allows your user’s client adapter to work around the world while still
meeting local or regional standards without the need for any reconﬁguration.
Key features of the ISA NIC include the following:
■
IEEE 802.11b standard compliance
■
Supports the highest range and throughput performance
■
Transmits at up to 100mW
■
Supports 128-bit WEP RC4 encryption for data security

Cisco Aironet Antennas
Because every wireless deployment is going to have different considerations for
data transmission, you want to be sure that you have the maximum network cov-
erage and efﬁciency for your environment. Some of the considerations include
the construction of the campus, structure sizes, and inside partitions of ofﬁce
spaces.To accommodate these needs, many of the Cisco wireless products have
the capability to use an external antenna. Before going through the antenna
choices that are available, we need to examine a few terms  to better explain the
terminology used:
■
Decibel (dB) A decibel is the unit of measure for power ratios
describing loss or gain, normally expressed in watts.A decibel is not an
absolute value—it is the measurement of power gained or lost between
two communicating devices.These units are normally given in terms of
the logarithm to Base 10 of a ratio.
■
dBi value This is the ratio of the gain of an antenna as compared to an
isotropic antenna.The greater the dBi value, the higher the gain. If the
gain is high, the angle of coverage will be more acute.
www.syngress.com

118
Chapter 3 • Cisco Wireless LAN Product Line
■
Isotropic antenna  An isotropic antenna is a theoretical construct that
describes an antenna that will radiate its signal 360 degrees to cover the
area in a perfect sphere. It is used as a basis by which to describe the gain
of a real antenna.
■
Line of sight  Line of sight is an unobstructed straight line between
two transmitting devices.You will most often see the need for a line-of-
sight path for long-range directional radio transmissions. Due to the cur-
vature of the earth, the line of sight for devices not mounted on towers
is limited to 6 miles (9.65 km).
■
Signal attenuation (multipath fading) This is the reduction of signal
strength based on one of several factors: absorption, diffraction, reﬂec-
tion, and refraction.
■
Absorption occurs when an obstruction (such as trees) soaks up the
signal so that it is unable to reach the receiver that it is trying to
communicate with.
■
Diffraction is when a signal bends around an obstruction that has a
reﬂective quality (such as glass).
■
Reﬂection is when the signal bounces off a surface (such as a body
of water) causing distortion, and sometimes cancellation, of the
signal.
■
Refraction is the bending of the signal based on atmospheric varia-
tions (such as fog).
A number of different antennas are described in this chapter. Each was
designed to ﬁt speciﬁc needs and as such has differing characteristics that better
allow it to serve these needs. In addition to the antenna itself, a major factor in
the performance of the overall wireless system is the cabling and connectors that
attach the antenna to the AP or bridge. For more information on cabling and
connector choices, see Chapter 9. Each antenna is discussed in the following sec-
tions, with a summary provided in Table 3.8.
The sections that follow reference horizontal and vertical coverage of an
antenna.This refers to the transmission area of the antenna on the horizontal and
vertical axis. See Figure 3.4 for a diagram of horizontal coverage and Figure 3.5
for a diagram depicting vertical coverage.

Chapter 3 • Cisco Wireless LAN Product Line
Ceiling Mount Omni-Directional Antenna
This indoor medium range antenna is designed to provide 360-degree coverage
in an ofﬁce space environment. Speciﬁcally, the antenna has a 360-degree hori-
zontal coverage and a 38-degree vertical coverage. It is cylindrically shaped and is
9 inches long with a 1-inch diameter. It is light enough, 4.6 oz. (131 g), to be
hung from a drop ceiling and comes with a mounting bracket speciﬁcally for this
purpose. It has a three-foot pigtail of coaxial cable at one end that terminates in a
RP-TNC connector.The approximate range provided by the antenna is 500 feet
at 1 Mbps and 145 feet at 11 Mbps.
Mast Mount Omni-Directional Antenna
The mast mount is primarily a short-range outdoor antenna. Much like the
ceiling mount omni-directional antenna, the mast mount omni-directional
antenna has a 360-degree horizontal coverage and a 38-degree vertical coverage.
Though it is speciﬁcally designed for outdoor short-range point-to-multipoint
applications, it can also be used indoors if needed providing similar performance
to the ceiling mount omni-directional antenna.The mast mount antenna is cylin-
drical in design, 11.5 inches long and 1.125 inches in diameter. It has a three-foot
pigtail of coaxial cable at the end that terminates in a RP-TNC connector.The
approximate range provided by the antenna for an outdoor bridge conﬁguration
is 5,000 feet at 2 Mbps and 1,580 feet at 11 Mbps.
High-Gain Mast Mount 
Omni-Directional Antenna
This antenna is much like the mast mount omni-directional antenna described in
the preceding section. It is a medium range outdoor antenna that has a 360-
degree horizontal coverage and is designed to be fastened to a mast and used for
point-to-multipoint applications. However, the major performance difference
comes in the vertical coverage.The high-gain antenna has a vertical coverage of
only 7 degrees compared to a 38-degree vertical coverage for the normal mast
mount antenna. Because it transmits the signal at a smaller angle, more of the
energy of the signal is concentrated thus giving the antenna better range.
Speciﬁcally, the range of this antenna is 4.6 miles at 2 Mbps and 1.4 miles at 11
Mbps.This mast mount antenna is also cylindrical in design, like the previous
mast mount antenna, however at 40 inches in length it is about four times longer.
The diameter of the high-gain mast mount antenna is also slightly larger at 1.3

inches.The cable used as a pigtail on the antennas is a 1-foot RG-8 cable with an
RP-TNC connector on the end.
Pillar Mount Diversity 
Omni-Directional Antenna
This antenna is speciﬁcally designed to provide omni-directional service while
being unobtrusive. For indoor use, this medium range antenna has two RP-TNC
connectors on the end of a 3-foot Siamese coaxial cable.The two inputs allow
for the transmission of diverse signals in the event that there is a failure of one of
the transmissions.The exterior of the antenna is covered with a tan cloth and
when mounted with the mounting brackets that ship with it, it will sit approxi-
mately 6 inches from the wall. It has a rectangular shape and is 1 foot tall by 5
inches wide and 1 inch thick.The antenna has a 360-degree horizontal coverage
and a 30-degree vertical coverage.The approximate range provided by the
antenna is 500 feet at 1 Mbps and 145 feet at 11 Mbps.
POS Diversity Dipole Omni-Directional Antenna
All of the other antennas discussed in this section are speciﬁcally designed to
work with the APs or bridges, however, this one is designed to work with special
client adapters. Speciﬁcally, this antenna works with LMC adapters that have dual
MMCX connectors.These connectors attach to the antenna’s 3-foot pigtails (also
with MMCX style connectors) and allow for better signal transmission from the
workstation.The antenna provides 360-degree horizontal coverage, a 75-degree
vertical coverage, and a range of 350 feet at 1 Mbps and 100 feet at 11 Mbps.
Though somewhat irregularly shaped, the diversity dipole antenna has dimensions
of 7 inches long, 2.25 inches wide, and 6.5 inches tall.
Diversity Ceiling Mount 
Omni-Directional Patch Antenna
This small, 5.5 inches long by 3 inches wide by 1 inch thick rectangular antenna
was speciﬁcally designed to be unobtrusive in a normal ofﬁce environment. It
comes with a mounting bracket that allows it mount to a drop ceiling, thus
allowing for maximum coverage in a cubicle environment. In addition, it has
roughly the same range—350 feet at 1 Mbps and 130 feet at 11 Mbps—as the
standard dipole antenna that comes with some of the APs. It has two diverse

transmitting elements accessed via two 3-foot pigtails each with their own RP-
TNC connector.
Directional Wall Mount Patch Antenna
As opposed to all of the other antennas discussed up to this point, the wall mount
patch antenna is not omni-directional.The horizontal and vertical coverage area
for this antenna is 60 degrees.The main difference in installation between and
omni-directional and directional antennas is that an omni-directional antenna is
meant to be installed in the center of the area that you wish to cover while a
directional antenna is installed at the edge.The wall mount patch antenna is a
long-range (700/200 feet at 1/11 Mbps) indoor antenna for use with the AP
products, or can also be installed as a medium-range (2 miles/3,390 feet at 1/11
Mbps) outdoor bridge antenna. Speciﬁcally, this particular antenna is small, 5
inches square by .5 inches thick, and lightly colored so that it will blend in easily
to an ofﬁce environment. Mounting this antenna requires nothing more than
four screws to attach it to a wall. In addition, it has a 3-foot pigtail that termi-
nates in an RP-TNC connector for connecting the antenna to you AP or bridge.
In addition to the patch antenna, another version of this antenna available from
Cisco.This version has a larger vertical and horizontal angle (75-degree horizontal
and 60-degree vertical) for transmission and as such has a lower overall gain. It is
also appropriate for indoor or outdoor applications, and it has a range of 540 feet at
1 Mbps and 150 feet at 11 Mbps if used with an AP, or 1.1 miles at 1 Mbps and
1,900 feet at 11 Mbps if used with a bridge.The ﬁnal difference between the two is
that this antenna is slightly smaller being 1 inch narrower in width.
Diversity Directional Wall Mount Patch Antenna
As was the case with the previous patch antenna, this one also is a directional-
based antenna. It is designed primarily for indoor use and has a medium range
(550/170 feet at 1/11 Mbps). However it has the advantage of having two radi-
ating elements that each have their own 3-foot pigtail attached to them.This
allows you to take advantage of the dual RP-TNC connectors that are supplied
on many of the APs. Due to its compact size (rectangular 4.75 inches by 6.75
inches by 1 inch thick), it can easily blend into the surroundings when attached
to a wall in an ofﬁce environment.

Cisco Wireless LAN Product Line • Chapter 3
123
Yagi Antenna
The last two antennas we discuss in this chapter are speciﬁcally designed for out-
door use in a point-to-point conﬁguration.The ﬁrst of these is the yagi antenna.
Cylindrical in shape and relatively compact in size (18 inches long with a 3-inch
diameter), the signal from the yagi antenna comes out the end of the cylinder.
The yagi antenna is able to get its gain though limiting the horizontal and ver-
tical radiation pattern.With a 30-degree horizontal and 25-degree vertical pat-
tern, the yagi antenna is able to obtain a maximum range of 6.5 miles at 2 Mbps
and 2.0 miles at 11 Mbps.As was the case with most of the other antennas dis-
cussed here, the yagi antenna comes with a 3-foot pigtail with an RP-TNC con-
nector on the end.
Dish Antenna
Finally, the last antenna we discuss is the dish antenna. Similar in size (2-foot
diameter) and function to the small satellite dishes that are used for television
transmission, the dish antenna provides that longest range of any of the Cisco
antennas. Speciﬁcally, it has a maximum range of 25 miles at 2 Mbps and 11.5
miles at 11 Mbps.As is the case with any antenna, the dish antenna was able to
get its longer range by reducing the radiation angle. In this case, both the vertical
and horizontal radiation angles are the same at 12.4 degrees.This small area can
make aligning two dish antennas over a large distance a difﬁcult task if not done
with care.As is implied by the previous statement, the dish antenna is speciﬁcally
designed for point-to-point applications. Finally, you can connect the dish
antenna to your bridge via the attached 2-foot pigtail with RP-TNC connector.

Summary
The WLAN will and has redeﬁned the way people are connecting to the net-
work. It has allowed users to go outside of the normal boundaries of the ofﬁce
and allows you to be more dynamic with the deployment of your network. Go
to many of your local Starbucks coffee houses and you will ﬁnd that many of
them now support wireless networking, as do many of the major airports and
hotel chains. Soon you will not only be able to roam anywhere within you ofﬁce
or campus, but anywhere within your city, state, and country and still maintain
your connection to the network and to the Internet.
Wireless technology and its growth is very similar to Ethernet’s move to
prevalence in the network world.The Institute of Electrical and Electronic
Engineers (IEEE) originally deﬁned Ethernet as the 802.3 standard to provide a
platform that was widely available, interoperable, and allowed for high-speed data
transfer, and as time passed it has evolved into the technology that we know
today. Because the 802.3 standard is an open standard, users can choose from a
wide range of suppliers and vendors and still be certain that the equipment will
play well with other equipment.The same can happen with wireless—a tremen-
dous opportunity for growth exists if vendors want to continue on this path.
The IEEE 802.11b standard deﬁnes that wireless devices will operates at 11
Mbps at 2.4 GHz, which is used worldwide for unlicensed radio based trafﬁc.
The frequency band also allows for more growth within the band, so there
should be plenty of potential for growth with minor changes to the standard (not
like IP numbering needing classes that are deﬁned for nonroutable networks).You
can also use an optional modulation procedure that will allow you to double the
data throughput rate, as discussed in Chapter 2.To show that there is mobility (no
pun intended), you need only to see that the original wireless vendors worked
with the 900 MHz band frequency, but migrated to the 2.4 GHz band so that
they could improve the throughput of data.
In fact, the next step is the utilization of the 5 GHz frequency band that is
capable of support transmission speeds of 54 Mbps.A standard is now in place
(IEEE 802.11a) for equipment speciﬁcations so as to support this higher data
transmission rate. But it does not stop there; the next step is to utilize the 5.7
GHz band, which should handle 100 Mbps throughput for data transmission.As
you know, in the ﬁeld of technology, something faster is always going to be on
the horizon as users becomes more used to current data rates, and in time users
and applications will require more and more (speed, power, and so on). So you
can see that there is the expectation for more growth.

Chapter 3 • Cisco Wireless LAN Product Line
Because Cisco wireless devices function like hubs and switches, converging
data and transmitting it to other areas, the clients that are attached to the WLAN
APs and share the LAN (like a hub) can also be tracked as they move through
(roams) the LAN.This will allow you an added bit of security because you can
deny trafﬁc or clients from accessing the network, allowing for greater manage-
ability.
The WLAN consists of two main parts: the AP and the bridge. In general, the
AP is used to connect individual wireless users to the network.Whereas the
bridges are used to connect two or more portions of the network together,
whether inside a single building or between two buildings miles apart. Cisco’s
340 and 350 Series product lines contain both APs and bridges to accommodate
either of these needs. In addition these product also include some specialized
devices that allow for the connection of smaller groups or ofﬁces.These products
provide a myriad of services and features that allow you to get the most out of
your wireless installation.They allow for remote management as well as a central-
ized security policy. Most also support WEP, LEAP, and EAP to allow you to
better secure your network. If you are going to want coverage of a wide-area
nature, you will need to deploy more than one AP.As you will see in Chapter 4,
you will also need to do a site survey to see what you will need to support to get
the coverage you want.This site survey will usually take into account what the
building is composed of, what the layout of the space is, what is considered line
of sight, whether the signal will need to go through ceilings and ﬂoors, where
users are going to be, and so on.What you want to be sure of is that users will be
connected, even if they move from ofﬁce to ofﬁce, or anywhere on the campus.
This feature is called roaming. Roaming allows users to move through the cov-
erage zones, maintaining their connection as the transceiver transfers from one
AP to another.
The client adapter is then able to connect to the wireless AP so that it can
negotiate a connection speed that can maintain the highest level of signal quality at
whatever distance it can support.The Cisco series of devices includes a line of
client adapters (PCMCIA, ISA, and PCI), for connecting your desktop or notebook
to the WLAN.All client adapters are high-speed, long range, secure, and compliant
with 802.11b standards, and they offer a full set of tools for management.
The ﬁnal section of the chapter dealt with the antenna options available from
Cisco. Numerous types of antennas are available, each designed to ﬁt speciﬁc pur-
poses. Omni-directional antennas are designed to be placed in the center of the
desired coverage area and come in models to support both indoor and outdoor
functionality. Patch antennas are directionally based and are designed to be placed
www.syngress.com

Cisco Wireless LAN Product Line • Chapter 3
127
at the edge of the coverage area. In general, patch antennas are small in size and
unobtrusive in design so that they can go unnoticed in a normal ofﬁce environ-
ment. Finally, yagi and dish antennas are used for long-range, outdoor connec-
tivity.These antennas allow for two buildings to be connected even if they are
miles apart.
Solutions Fast Track
Overview of Cisco Wireless Systems
 The use of wireless systems is continuing to grow.They are being used
to connect users on a LAN in an ofﬁce environment as well as being
used to replace terrestrial carrier services such as T1 lines.
 Today, not only can PCs and laptops be connected to the WLAN, many
other devices such as PDAs, printers, point-of-sale terminals, and
scanners are also being connected.
 Cisco has a complete system for wireless connectivity.This includes APs,
bridges, client adapters, antennas, and related accessories.
Cisco Aironet 3X0 Series APs and Bridges
 Cisco has two main product lines for wireless connectivity the 340 and
350 series. Both have all the components that are needed to create a
successful WLAN installation.
 The 340 series product line includes,APs, bridges, workgroup bridges,
and base stations. Each of these products has design features that make it
better suited for one environment over another.
 The 350 series product line includes APs, bridges, and workgroup
bridges. Like the 340 series, each of these products has differing features
that make it better suited for a particular task, however, one advantage
the 350 series of products has over the 340 series is that most of the 350
series products support inline power over the Ethernet cable that is used
to uplink the device.

Cisco Aironet Wireless NICs
 PCMCIA NICs are designed speciﬁcally to allow laptop and small
mobile devices access to the wireless network.
 ISA NICs are designed to allow desktop machines access to the wireless
network. In general, ISA cards are used in older machines as most newer
model desktops are using PCI slots.
 PCI NICs are also designed to allow desktop machines access to the
wireless network.As computer manufacturers migrate more and more to
the PCI slot in their machines, this card will be used more often.
Cisco Aironet Antennas
 Omni-directional antennas transmit a signal 360 degrees, and as such,
should be placed in the center of the desired coverage area.You can use
these antennas to connect users to your APs or connect two or more
buildings together using wireless bridges.
 Because patch antennas are directional in nature, you should install them
at the edge of your coverage area.As was the case with the omni-
directional antennas, patch antennas come in conﬁgurations that allow
for indoor and outdoor functionality.
 Yagi and dish antennas are speciﬁcally designed to connect two building
together.They have the longest range of any Cisco antenna.

Q: The devices are only 300 meters apart, but trees are located in-between the
two buildings where the APs reside. Can Cisco Aironet wireless APs connect
through trees?
A: Yes, the signal will pass through trees, but you will need to calculate your db
losses correctly and take the trees into account.
Issues that will affect your loss calculation include the following:
■
The type of antennas on the units
■
The radios’ transmit power
■
The radios’ receive sensitivity
■
The distance between your antennas (known as free-space loss)
■
The “objects” in-between your antennas (trees, buildings, and so on)
■
An ampliﬁer, if you are using one
■
The cabling to the antenna
■

cables to the antenna
After you have used these points to calculate your signal loss and have a
positive db left over, you will be able to use your wireless device.
Q: How far can a wireless client communicate to an AP?
A: Client adapters can support 11 Mbps at a range of 400 feet (120m) in open
environments and 100 feet (30m) in typical closed/indoor environments.
Client adapters can support 1 Mbps at a range of up to 1,500 feet (460m) in
open environments and 300 feet (90m) in closed/indoor environments.

Q: How many users can a Cisco wireless AP support?
A: Depending on the available bandwidth and the applications you are using, a
Cisco wireless AP can theoretically support up to 20,000 addresses for ﬁl-
tering wireless clients. For example, a Cisco Aironet 340 Series wireless net-
work is equivalent to a shared 10 Mbps Ethernet LANs in the number of
users that it can sustain. If you are using typical applications, the number of
users per segment that would normally be used on a 10 Mbps wired segment
could also be implemented on an 11 Mbps wireless segment.You could also
add additional APs so that you can create additional network segments.
However, if you are using a Cisco network that operates at lower data rates,
less bandwidth is available.This means that fewer wireless clients can be sup-
ported. In an average environment, a Cisco AP can support 25–50 clients.

Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
Introduction
The design of your wireless system encompasses three speciﬁc stages or phases:
planning, designing, and site surveying. In addition to these phases, you must
combine a certain amount of knowledge, creativity, and skill to overcome design
obstacles.You must have knowledge and understanding of your organization’s
requirements for an implementation, infrastructure, wireless technology, and envi-
ronment.You will also need creativity to overcome business, political, and physical
barriers. Finally, you need skill to properly test and deploy your wireless design.
This chapter provides you with the information necessary to execute the dif-
ferent phases of a wireless network design, raise awareness of the various obstacles
you may encounter throughout all stages of your design effort, and provide
examples of designs for common scenarios.
The ﬁrst phase in your wireless design is the planning phase.This phase repre-
sents the initial possibilities of a wireless solution for a given business issue or sce-
nario.Wireless system feasibility testing begins in this phase and will continue
throughout all stages of your design.
Next, in the rough design phase you must apply the knowledge gained in the
planning stage to create a “blind” design.A blind design is your initial, untested
wireless system design.You will use the information gathered in the planning
stage to apply to this rough design.
The third and ﬁnal phase is the preparation and execution of a wireless site
survey.This phase allows you to eliminate any remaining variables in your design,
permits you to test the feasibility of the rough design you created in phase two,
and make revisions as necessary to present a complete, efﬁcient, and reliable wire-
less system design for implementation or approval.
Wireless Planning Considerations
The planning phase requires knowledge of the beneﬁts and limitations of wireless
networks, requirements for a wireless implementation in your business, and the
ability to analyze the feasibility of a wireless local area network (WLAN).
In order to properly plan a wireless system, you must ﬁrst identify the goal of
the potential system.We use a ﬁctitious company,Andromeda Manufacturing, to
help you understand what is required throughout all phases of the wireless system
design process.
Andromeda is a manufacturer of a tool destined for the retail market.Their
campus is located in a rural area, and the facilities that are farthest away are
www.syngress.com

www.syngress.com
approximately one mile from each other (see Figure 4.1).The president of the
company has asked you to provide solutions for three business requirements the
company has issued.
The ﬁrst of the three requirements is to provide data connectivity from the
administration facility to the manufacturing and warehouse facilities.This will
allow management at headquarters to gather production and shipping informa-
tion and to provide e-mail for the supervisors in the remote facilities.
The second of the three requirements is to provide a better solution to the
slow inventory process at the warehouse.The president has heard of a “wireless
way” to perform inventories more efﬁciently and would like you to investigate
this further.
Due to the poor quality of the telephone lines in the company’s locality, fre-
quent outages of the only data circuit the company owns is negatively affecting
production and the “bottom line.”This circuit is from the headquarters facility to
Research and Development (R&D).As the ﬁnal requirement issued, the president
would like an alternate solution to the existing unreliable circuit.
The three mandates from the president of Andromeda Manufacturing clearly
outline the goals and requirements of the business.You will need to investigate
possible solutions to achieve these goals. In the example, further investigation is
necessary before a rough design can be achieved. Such information as the type
and bandwidth of applications used in the facilities and the number of users in
each facility will all play a part in developing the wireless system designs for this
company.

Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
In the following sections, you’ll get to know the beneﬁts and limitations of
wireless LANs to aid in asking the proper questions to determine the feasibility
of a wireless system.
Wireless Beneﬁts and Limitations
Wireless LANs offer much in the way of productivity and convenience over tra-
ditional wired networks.Among these are mobility, implementation simplicity
and ﬂexibility, speed of installation and good scalability. Mobility is probably the
most popular reason organizations choose wireless systems.There is much to be
said for the other beneﬁts of wireless systems. Installing a WLAN system can be
fast and easy and can eliminate the need to pull cable through walls and ceilings.
Wireless technology allows the network to go where wire cannot go.WLAN sys-
tems can be conﬁgured in a variety of topologies to meet the needs of speciﬁc
applications and installations. Conﬁgurations are easily changed and range from
peer-to-peer networks suitable for a small number of users to full infrastructure
networks of thousands of users that can roam over a broad area.These advantages
and others have promoted wireless networking to a point that continues to move
on an upward curve.
As with any technology, wireless has its limitations. Depending on your busi-
ness, aesthetic, or technological requirements, wireless may or may not best suit
your needs.To determine if wireless will be an effective and successful solution in
your environment, you need to answer certain questions.
What Type of Data Will Be 
Traversing the Wireless Network?
The ﬁrst thing you should understand about wireless networks is the limitations
to speed and throughput inherent to the technology.Wireless networks are not
wired networks and as such technology has not sufﬁciently advanced to meet the
speeds and throughput we expect from wired networks. Because of this, you must
give consideration to the type of data being transmitted across the WLAN.
Current wireless technology supports 11 Mbps speed and approximately 5.5MB
throughput. For example, a wireless network may not be a good solution if the
implementation is meant to replace a FastEthernet network (100 Mbps network)
where 50 or more users are consistently sending and receiving large graphics ﬁles
(20–30MB+). Because of the large size of the ﬁles and the amount of trafﬁc, you
may wish to consider the wireless LAN implementation as a redundancy solution
and not a replacement solution in this scenario.As a redundancy solution, you
www.syngress.com

Wireless Network Design • Chapter 4
135
still have to deal with less performance, but the expectation set for a backup con-
nection would be that slow, inexpensive, and functional is better than hours or
days of downtime because a single link failed.
Application trafﬁc that is typically suited for WLANs includes any low- or
medium-bandwidth applications, such as e-mail,Web-based applications, network
printing, and ﬁle sharing. Of course, there are always exceptions to this guideline.
If the number of users in the previous scenario had been much fewer, say ﬁve
users, the impact of consistently sending those large graphics ﬁles would have
been acceptable on the wireless LAN. Conversely, if the number of users is
extremely high and the frequency in which the application sends network trafﬁc
is extremely high, even a low-bandwidth application, such as Web browsing, can
signiﬁcantly impact wireless LAN performance.You need to evaluate each wire-
less cell implementation individually.
NOTE
When gauging application trafﬁc for use on a WLAN, you need to take a
number of considerations into account: 
■
How many users will be associated to a single cell at any given
time?
■
How frequently will the application produce network trafﬁc?
■
Will the application trafﬁc that those same users will be utilizing
exceed the typical throughput per cell?
■
What types of applications will those users be expected to use
on the wireless LAN?
How Much Data Will Be 
Traversing the Wireless Network?
The amount of data traveling across your wired network can be prohibitive to a
WLAN implementation. Existing trafﬁc on a network may be more than the
wireless network can handle. If all the trafﬁc is necessary to the requirements of
the users on the wireless segment, you may to consider other alternatives for con-
nectivity, such as traditional wired technology.An evaluation of your current
trafﬁc as compared to the application and connectivity requirements of the
potential wireless users will be necessary.You can utilize a number of tools to
gather the trafﬁc information necessary for evaluation. Protocol and network 
analyzers, commonly called sniffers, will give you network trafﬁc information by
www.syngress.com

136
Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
protocol, Media Access Control (MAC) address, and network address.A good
sniffer will allow you to rank your trafﬁc in various ways and can allow you to
capture network information for detailed analysis. Other tools, such as Remote
Monitor (RMON) probes and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
traps, can assist you in gathering trafﬁc information as well.
What Is the Return On Investment 
for Your Wireless Implementation?
Calculating return on investment (ROI) can be extremely easy or extremely dif-
ﬁcult depending on your business and the intended use of the proposed wireless
system. ROI is the ﬁnancial point where the wireless system pays for itself and
over time saves money for your business over traditional methods of installation
and deployment.This point and the savings associated with it are highly variable
and contingent upon what is used to calculate it.We discuss ROI in detail in the
“Cost and Return on Investment” section later in this chapter. Sufﬁce to say, you
will need to know your current business model very well in order to answer this
question and in most cases, you will need to calculate this to get approval for
your implementation. Should the ROI be less than expected or accepted, a wire-
less system in your business may be ﬁnancially impractical.
How Does Mobility Factor into Determining 
if Wireless Is Right for Your Business?
Mobility is a great leveraging tool to gaining approval for a wireless system in
your business. Depending on how great the need for users to be mobile is in
your business, your design requirements must reﬂect it. Some organizations may
want a wireless system simply to allow their users the freedom to move about
while working, as a beneﬁt to working there or to reduce lost production due to
employee morale.This is not a high factoring mobility requirement.The organi-
zation may not be committed to this way of improving morale, because a wireless
implementation could have nominal or unproven beneﬁts. However, in the case
of a warehouse facility, paying either another company or its own employees
after-hours rates to perform inventories, mobility would be an enormous factor
in the requirements of the business. If mobility is one of the greater requirements
for your business, a wireless system may be just what the doctor ordered.We
cover mobility in more detail in the following section.

Does Your Business or Corporation Have Any
Restrictions That Would Prohibit You from
Implementing a Wireless LAN Solution?
Another key question you need to answer to determine if wireless is the way to
go in your environment is how important are such things as aesthetics? Pleasing
to the eye may not be a primary concern to a manufacturing facility, but a ﬁnan-
cial institution that serves the public may not be happy with antennas hanging
from the ceiling of their lobby. If restrictions are placed on the aesthetics to the
point that it affects the performance and functionality of the technology, wireless
will not be suitable for that environment.An example of this is a clothing manu-
facturer I once worked with that was constructing a new campus of buildings.
The client wanted wireless coverage in the entire interior of a building con-
structed with an open ceiling (no drop ceiling, just rafters and heating/cooling
ductwork).They restricted the placement of the antennas for the facility to a 6-
inch space between two metal heating ducts that ran the length of the building.
Needless to say, wireless coverage was less than optimal due to the interference
caused by the metal. Eventually they agreed to move the antennas to more suit-
able locations after convincing them antennas could be painted (without using
lead-based paint) to match the ceiling.
These are but a few of the most common questions you may need to answer
in determining the feasibility, up front, for a wireless system in your business or
organization. Due to the unique nature of every business and organization there
may, and likely will, be more questions to answer.
Asking these questions and several others pertaining to the business processes of
our ﬁctional company,Andromeda Manufacturing, revealed that the R&D users
produce very large CAD drawings that are electronically transferred daily to the
headquarters facility for approval and revisions.The ﬁles range in size from approxi-
mately 40MB to over 100MB each, and up to 20 to 30 transfers take place to and
from the facility daily. It is not expected that the CAD ﬁles will be sent to the
manufacturing or warehouse facilities when they are added to the network. In
addition, the Headquarters facility has four Apple Macintosh computers networked
into the LAN.They are used to design, create, and share marketing literature.This
literature will not be shared with manufacturing or the warehouse.Although 60
people are employed in the manufacturing facility, only the supervisors and man-
agers will have access to the network.The total number of users and network
printers to be added to the network in manufacturing will be approximately 10.
www.syngress.com

138
Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
The manufacturing facility currently runs two shifts daily starting at 6 A.M. and
ending at 11 P.M.All other facilities run ﬁrst shift only (8 A.M. to 5 P.M.).Total
number of users and network printers for the warehouse will be approximately 5 to
10. None of the facilities have any aesthetic restrictions.The information obtained
is noted and retained for use during the design process.
Mobility
Mobility is typically the primary purpose and one of the key beneﬁts of imple-
menting a wireless LAN.Wireless LAN systems can provide users with access to
real-time information anywhere in their organization.This mobility supports pro-
ductivity and service opportunities not possible with wired networks.Wireless
gives users the freedom to move about while performing their tasks without
being forced to go to, or remain at, a wired station.An example of this would be
small item inventory.The usual process requires users to count items in a small
bin and write the quantity down.The written quantity is then brought to some
device for input into the data system.This adds a lot of time and therefore, loss of
productivity, into the process. If the bins to be inventoried were within a wireless
coverage area, users could input the quantities directly into the system from the
site of the bin, therefore increasing productivity substantially.
There are limitations to the mobility of a wireless system. If a user strays to
the outside range of the wireless coverage area, he may have degraded perfor-
mance and reliability or worse, he may lose data.A good design will consider the
mobility of the users and try to compensate for user error.Training and setting
user expectations are the best ways to handle issues such as straying. In addition, a
design for mobility should include thorough testing to ensure that data rates are
acceptable at typical production speeds for highly mobile users.What are highly
mobile users? There are actually two types of users when discussing mobility:
mobile users and highly mobile users.
A mobile user is deﬁned as a user that moves within a wireless coverage area but
stop moving to input or retrieve data.They require portability for their data input
devices, such as a laptop on a cart or handheld bar code reader.A police ofﬁcer,
whose job is to check parking meters for violations, is a good example of this type
of user. If you were to apply their position to a wireless coverage area, they could
walk from meter to meter using data collection devices and portable printers.
Stopping at a meter that requires processing a violation, the police ofﬁcer can
input the violator’s automobile information and print the ticket, sending the infor-
mation directly into the police department’s data processing system. Once com-
pleted with this task, the police ofﬁcer moves on to the next meter.

Wireless Network Design • Chapter 4

A highly mobile user is a user that moves within a wireless coverage area and
continue to move while data input or retrieval takes place.A good example of
this:A data collection device is mounted to a forklift that moves throughout a
warehouse.A driver may scan a barcode and then enter the quantity as she is
driving away.
Determining if your users will mobile or highly mobile is important to your
design.Take the time to work with your customer to determine exactly what
mobility needs exist, and just as important, what the customer’s expectations are
for the mobility of their users.
Questions regarding the mobility of the users in the Andromeda
Manufacturing facilities revealed a dire need for mobility in the warehouse.
All other facilities did not have this requirement.
Throughput versus Data Rate and Load
Throughput and data rates do not equal each other in either a wireless or wired
network.Typical data throughput on an Ethernet network is about 60 percent of
the nominal capacity.Therefore, a 10 Mbps Ethernet network under typical load
would yield a throughput of 6 Mbps. Factors that affect nominal throughput on a
network include overhead, number of users, operating systems and so forth.A
wireless link has slightly greater overhead associated with it than a wired link and
therefore typically yields approximately 5.5 Mbps of throughput on an 11 Mbps
network (based on the use of Cisco wireless gear).
www.syngress.com
Operating Systems and Data Throughput
Different operating systems also affect the data throughput you can
expect to achieve in your wireless system. Whereas Microsoft operating
systems typically achieve 5.5 to 6 Mbps of throughput on an 11 Mbps
wireless network, Linux operating systems—using the same Cisco wire-
less hardware, the same client hardware, and positioned the same dis-
tance from the access point (AP), on the same wireless network—are
able to yield a typical throughput of 7 Mbps. This is due to the way each
of the operating systems handle network functionality, especially in
terms of network client drivers.
Designing & Planning…

140
Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
The load on an AP (the total number of potential clients) should be consid-
ered in any design. For design purposes, an 11 Mbps wireless network roughly
equates to a 10 Mbps Ethernet network in terms of the number of users the
wireless LAN can handle. One potential problem with wireless LANs is that the
number of clients is very dynamic because the freedom of a wireless system
allows any number of people to converge within an area.The actual number of
clients is limited by a table within the AP, Cisco APs have a table that will theo-
retically allow 2,048 clients.Although this is the maximum, it is not practical.
Keep in mind that wireless LANs are a shared infrastructure, and the more clients
on the AP, the less overall available bandwidth there is for each individual user.
Therefore the distribution of the clients among more APs in congested areas may
be required.The number of clients that can be handled by a single AP is a func-
tion of the applications supported, the data rate of the AP, and the desired perfor-
mance of the application by the customer. I have found that the number of users
per AP should not exceed 20 to 30 to maintain acceptable performance levels in
the average environment.This number will of course be higher or lower
depending on the applications, operating systems, and simultaneous usage of the
users on the network.
Cisco APs give you the ability to load balance users across APs to further
enhance performance in your wireless network. By placing two APs in the same
coverage area you have the ability to “balance” the load on any single AP in a
coverage area.This increases performance in your wireless system.
Expectations are everything in a wireless implementation. If the correct
expectation is set and accepted, your wireless implementation will be a great suc-
cess, and you will reap the beneﬁts of that success. One of the most important
expectations to set will be that of throughput in your wireless system. If your
environment has, for example, FastEthernet already in place, users are accustomed
to those speeds on their network and will notice the difference in performance
from the wired 100 Mbps network to the wireless 11 Mbps network. If you set
the expectation that throughput will not be at the accustomed speed, but will be
more like a 10 Mbps network, usually there is no problem when the wireless net-
work “goes live” in regards to performance. I like to compare speeds to T-1 wired
circuits, especially where Internet access over wireless will take place.When my
customer hears that they will have the same speed as their wired network
Internet access (typically my customers have a full T-1 or fractional T-1 to the
Internet) and that their wireless connection equates to about six T-1s.The expec-
tation is set and the client walks away feeling conﬁdent in their decision to go
wireless.

Cost and Return on Investment
Although the initial investment required for WLAN hardware can be higher than
the cost of wired LAN hardware, overall installation expenses and life-cycle costs
can be signiﬁcantly lower. Long-term cost beneﬁts are greatest in dynamic envi-
ronments requiring frequent moves and changes or in interconnections of LANs
where recurring circuit costs are eliminated.
We use the Andromeda Manufacturing scenario as an example of the process
involved to determine ROI for a wireless implementation over a wired solution.
In order to accurately determine whether a wireless solution for any one of
the Andromeda Manufacturing mandates will offer any signiﬁcant cost savings
over a wired solution, we must gather current costs used by the company to
achieve these goals and just as important, the cost to not achieve them.
Currently Andromeda spends $400 a month on the unreliable circuit that is
being used between their headquarters and the research and development facility.
Research indicates the company is losing approximately $15,000 a month
because of connectivity issues.This amount is based on lost man hours resending
information over the circuit as well as lost business due to the inability to get
new schematics approved, sent to manufacturing, and shipped to Andromeda
Manufacturing’s clients in a timely manner.
Company losses due to exceptionally long inventory processes at the ware-
house facility have been estimated between $3,000 and $5,000 a month.This is
based on information gathered from several competitors’ average inventory pro-
cess times, overtime paid, and production losses incurred for the average duration
of the inventory.
Savings in the estimated amount of $2,000 a month will be gained based on a
recent study of the methods of intercompany communications.These savings are
a result of minimizing supplies costs and ensuring accurate communications to
manufacturing and warehouse supervisors.This is to be accomplished by some
solution to reduce production and shipping ﬂaws from faulty “word-of-mouth”
directives and eliminate hard copy memos and reports.This gave rise to the
requirement for an e-mail solution from Andromeda’s president.
An additional $5,000 a month is estimated to be saved by the ability to
quickly identify and make production changes based on “real-time” information
being provided to management, instead of the weekly hard copy reports currently
used.This is related to the connectivity request from Andromeda’s president.
At this point, we must consider the possible solutions for each of the issues.
Keeping in mind the information previously gathered, we can consider rough

Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
wireless designs and compare them to other, more conventional, solutions with a
focus on monetary considerations. Because we do not have the precise require-
ments to implement any solution we are merely speculating to eliminate grossly
inefﬁcient solutions.
Adding additional recurring costs in the form of additional circuits to each
facility eliminates this as a possible connectivity solution, especially in light of the
circuit stability issues experienced by Andromeda Manufacturing.This leaves us
with basically two other connectivity alternatives: ﬁber or wireless. Because ﬁber
does not satisfy the mobility requirements of the warehouse, it is eliminated as a
possible solution to the inventory problem. However, at this point it is still a
viable solution for connectivity of all facilities, including the warehouse.
We must now compare the costs associated with using wireless versus ﬁber in
each remaining solution. Costs associated with a ﬁber installation depend greatly
on the type of ﬁber required. Single mode ﬁber and the hardware needed for it,
is usually much more expensive than multimode ﬁber.The main difference in the
two ﬁber types is the distances each can be used. Single mode ﬁber is used for
distances up to 14 kilometers (a little over 8.5 miles) and requires laser hardware
to provide the light through the ﬁber, where multimode ﬁber can only be used
to distances not exceeding 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) and typically uses light-emit-
ting diodes (LEDs) to provide the light necessary for functionality. In addition to
the type of ﬁber, installation costs can be steep for ﬁber as well. Fiber is usually
installed underground, requiring trenching services.Termination of ﬁber lines
usually is not a cost issue because it is not much more expensive than termina-
tion of traditional copper connections.
After considering the distances of the warehouse and manufacturing from the
headquarters facility, multimode ﬁber will be sufﬁcient if it is chosen as the con-
nectivity solution.The numbers of expected users at each of the facilities, the
applications to be used, and network trafﬁc expected does not justify the added
cost of a ﬁber solution over wireless for the warehouse and manufacturing facili-
ties. In addition, the railroad owns a section of track running between the ware-
house, manufacturing facility, and the headquarters facility and will not grant
permission to run ﬁber either over or under the tracks.This eliminates ﬁber as a
connectivity solution for these two facilities.
The research and development facility is another story. Fiber is the best solu-
tion for their requirements even though the number of users is not signiﬁcant.
The main reason for this is the type, size, and transfer frequency of the ﬁles
traversing the network. Because ﬁber offers much higher bandwidth than wire-
less, it proves to be the solution of choice in this scenario and can be easily cost

justiﬁed. Fiber eliminates the recurring costs associated with the circuit, improves
reliability, and provides more than adequate bandwidth for future growth.
We now know that to satisfy the requirements of our solutions in the most
efﬁcient and cost effective manner, we will likely implement a ﬁber solution to
the research and development facility, a point-to-multipoint wireless solution for
the warehouse and manufacturing facilities and an internal wireless solution for
the warehouse.
We now move on to creating the rough design for each solution.To do this,
however, we will need to understand the design considerations involved.The next
section in this chapter covers those design considerations.
Wireless Design Considerations
In order to create a design for a wireless system, you must consider common
wireless LAN transmission and reception impairments, such as attenuation, radio
frequency (RF) interference, and application and structural considerations.As you
will see, many of the design considerations in this section relate to point-to-point
and point-to-multipoint wireless implementations, which is mainly because wire-
less coverage in these implementations is not spread out over an area, but rather it
is focused to a speciﬁc point.This section explains various common types of
impairments and considerations that you may face in your wireless design and
testing efforts.
Attenuation
Attenuation is the decrease in strength of a radio wave; the strength decreases as
the distance from the antenna increases. It can be caused by the natural conduc-
tivity or resistance of all sorts of physical matter, but the greatest resistor to radio
waves is the Earth. Radiated energy from the Earth, and interference from trees
and buildings will cause attenuation of the signal’s ground waves, as radiated
energy and interference from water and dust particles in the atmosphere will
affect the signal’s sky waves.You must plan your design and equipment use based
on these factors affecting ground and sky wave propagation, such as transmitter
height, distance between transmitters, and solar radiation factors. Low-frequency
radio wave propagation utilizes propagation of both ground and sky wave trans-
missions and can be used at varying distances; high-frequency wave propagation
(3,000 kHz to 30 Mhz) relay more upon sky waves for transmission and may be
used at long distances (like 12,000 miles); and very high frequency wave propaga-
tion (above 30 MHz) is reliant upon line-of-sight direct wave transmission.
www.syngress.com

144
Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
Attenuation Due to Antenna Cabling
Loss due to antenna cable length must always be considered when designing your
wireless system. Cisco cabling produces 6.7 dBi of loss per 100 feet of cabling.
The reason for this is that the radio wave actually starts at the radio device.The
radiated energy traveling through the cabling from the radio device to the
antenna induces a voltage in the cabling, decreasing the strength of the wave as
the distance from the radio device to the antenna becomes greater.
Attenuation Due to Exterior Considerations
If you plan on coverage outdoors that is point-to-point or point-to-multipoint,
you will need to pay particular attention to considerations that are distance-
related. For example, Earth bulge will come into play only if you are imple-
menting a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint WLAN, whereas weather is a
consideration for any outdoor implementation.
As we have seen, all matter produces attenuation (loss) to some degree.
Because weather can produce rain, snow, or fog, all of which are matter, you also
need to consider weather in your wireless LAN design.
Researching any unusual weather conditions that are common to the site
location is important.These conditions can include excessive amounts of rain or
fog, wind velocity, or extreme temperature ranges. If extreme conditions exist that
may affect the integrity of the radio link, you should take these conditions into
consideration early in the planning process.
Rain, Snow, and Fog
Except in extreme conditions, attenuation (weakening of the signal) due to rain
does not require serious consideration for frequencies up to the range of 6 or 8
GHz.When microwave frequencies are at 11 or 12 GHz or above, attenuation
due to rain becomes much more of a concern, especially in areas where rainfall is
of high density and long duration.
The attenuation rate for snow is generally higher, due in large part to the size
of the particles of snow, or for that matter rain and fog as well, in comparison to
the wavelength of the signal. For example, a 2.4 GHz signal will have a wave-
length of approximately 125 millimeters, or 4.9 inches.A 23 GHz signal will have
a wavelength of approximately 0.5 inches.A raindrop approaches 0.25 of an inch.
At 2.4 GHz, rain or snow, even heavy rain or snow, should not have much of an
impact on your wireless system, however in a 23 GHz system, the wavelength is

reduced to half by this rain.At this size, the rain or snow becomes a reﬂective
surface and disperses the 23 GHz signal.
In most cases, the effects of fog are considered to be much the same as rain.
However, fog can adversely affect the radio link when it is accompanied by atmo-
spheric conditions such as temperature inversion, or very still air accompanied by
stratiﬁcation (layers of signiﬁcantly differing air temperatures).Temperature inver-
sion can negate clearances, and still air along with stratiﬁcation can cause severe
refractive or reﬂective conditions, with unpredictable results.Temperature inver-
sions and stratiﬁcation can also cause ducting, which may increase the potential
for interference between systems that do not normally interfere with each other.
Where these conditions exist, use shorter paths and adequate clearances.
Atmospheric Absorption
A relatively small effect on the wireless link is from gases and moisture in the
atmosphere. It is usually signiﬁcant only on longer paths and particular frequen-
cies.Attenuation (loss) in the 2–14 GHz frequency range is approximately 0.01
dB/mile.You may have to include atmospheric absorption in your design consid-
eration if you are planning on implementing a wireless system above 10 GHz
where atmospheric absorption is prevalent.There are some wireless systems on
the market today, licensed in the 23 GHz band that are signiﬁcantly impacted by
this type of loss.Antenna height has some impact on loss related to atmospheric
absorption because the density of the air decreases as altitude increases.Thus, a 23
GHz system with an antenna signiﬁcantly elevated over a similar implementation
at a lower elevation will suffer less from attenuation due to atmospheric absorp-
tion.Table 4.1 depicts attenuation due to atmospheric absorption versus path dis-
tance.Attenuation is listed as negative decibels, or –dB.

Multipath Distortion
Multipath distortion is caused, as the name implies, by the transmitted signal trav-
eling to the receiver via more than one path:A common cause of this is reﬂec-
tion of the signal from bodies of water, hills, or tall buildings. Figure 4.2 shows an
example of multipath distortion caused by reﬂection.The antennas are the same
height. In the worst case, the reﬂected signal arrives at the receiving antenna at
the same time as the intended signal, but out of phase with the intended signal,
both signals will cancel each other out, resulting in complete loss of data. Best
case, the reﬂected signal arrives a moment later than the intended signal causing
distortion and therefore reduced performance. Examples of reﬂective surfaces
include water, asphalt, ﬁelds, metal roofs, or any smooth, relatively ﬂat surface.
Dispersing extraneous radio waves is better than reﬂecting them. Examples of dis-
persal surfaces include rough rocky surfaces, shrubbery, trees, and so on. In a big
city, more people receive an echoed distortion of the wireless signal than receive
the actual signal, because the original signal bounces off buildings and the like.
The best way to reduce multipath distortion is to use a directional rooftop
antenna. For example, a directional antenna that will only pick up signals coming
from the direction of the transmitter and will reject reﬂections that arrive at its
sides or its back.A Yagi antenna is one example of a directional antenna that will
help you reduce or eliminate multipath distortion (see Figure 4.3).
It is also sometimes possible to mount the antenna so that the mounting struc-
ture screens it from the reﬂections but not from the wanted signal. By changing
the antenna height you can effectively reduce or eliminate the multipath signals by
dispersing the signals away from the receiving antenna (see Figure 4.4).

Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
Refraction
When a radio wave travels between two substances of different densities, the wave
will bend or refract because electromagnetic signals move slower through sub-
stances of greater density.This phenomena impacts a radio wave as it travels
through the atmosphere.The density of the Earth’s atmosphere decreases as alti-
tude increases.Therefore, the bottom of the radio wave travels through a denser
atmosphere than the top of the wave.This means the bottom of the wave will
move slower than the top of the wave, causing the signal to bend towards the
Earth’s surface and follow the curvature of the Earth, but at an arc radius approxi-
mately 1.33 times greater than the Earth’s arc radius (see Figure 4.5).
At night, the air cools, and much of the moisture in the air moves closer to
the Earth’s surface.The cool, wet air near the Earth is denser than the air higher
in the atmosphere, so radio signals can bend farther than they do in the daylight
hours.This is known as super refraction.
Other refraction phenomena, such as ducting or bending can also occur,
which you should be aware of for design purposes. Ducting happens when radio
waves are trapped in a high-density duct between two areas of lower density.
Bending is similar to super refraction, but it is not caused by atmospheric con-
ditions related to day or night. Instead, differences in air density in a horizontal
plane, like cooler air over a lake or ﬁeld and warmer air over a shore or highway
cause the radio waves to bend in the direction of the cooler, denser air over the
lake or ﬁeld.

Refraction is one reason why radio line-of-sight is not necessarily the same as
optical line-of-sight. Refraction is minimal for paths under 10 miles, with the
exception of hot, humid areas like the Southeastern United States.
Accounting for the Fresnel 
Zone and Earth Bulge
A main consideration of any point-to-point design is the Fresnel zone.An elec-
tromagnetic signal traveling between two antennas does not travel in a straight
line.The wave spreads out as it propagates.The individual waves that make up the
signal do not travel at a constant velocity.A pair of antennas deﬁne a three-
dimensional elliptical path for the radio waves that propagate between them.This
elliptical path is divided into several zones based on the phase and speed of the
propagating waves.These zones are referred to as Fresnel zones, pronounced “Fre
Nel” (the “s” is silent). Each Fresnel zone differs in phase by up to half a wave-
length, or 180 degrees.We think of this Fresnel zone commonly as line-of-sight
(see Figure 4.6). Radio line-of-sight is not the same as visual line-of-sight. In
visual line of sight, a direct line exists between two points, it is easy to think this
way between two antennas in a point-to-point design. However, radio line of
sight is not a straight line between the antennas, it is more of an ellipse. In a good
point-to-point design, this ellipse should be calculated to determine its size and
clear of obstacles to provide a good signal.
Because of the elliptical shape of the Fresnel zone, the antennas used in a
point-to-point design must be high enough to provide clearance of the Fresnel
zone’s radius at the midpoint.As the distance increases, you must concern yourself
with other factors, such as the curvature of the Earth, where line of sight

Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
becomes difﬁcult at 6 miles (for a 6-foot tall person) and disappears altogether at
16 miles (for two structures at 10 feet) because your clearance from the Earth at
the horizon point will have minimum clearance (see Figure 4.7). Paths over 20
miles are extremely difﬁcult to align and install, so take caution when recom-
mending these types of conﬁgurations.
Radio Frequency Interference
Radio frequency interference is extraneous energy that impedes the reception of
signals. It can be caused by a radio emission from another transmitter at approxi-
mately the same frequency.
When we talk about the frequency that an AP radio operates on, we really
mean its “center frequency,” because both the transmitter and receiver operate
within a band of frequencies that is several megahertz (MHz) wide.AP transmit-
ters will transmit strongest at frequencies very close to its center frequency, with a
decrease in signal strength as you move away from the center frequency. Similarly
the wireless AP receiver will be most sensitive to frequencies very close to its
center frequency, with a decrease in sensitivity as you move away from the center
frequency. Note that the center frequency of the receiver can be slightly different
than the center frequency of the transmitter and things will still seem to work
okay, but because power decreases as you move out from the center frequency,
range will be reduced.
The width of this band of frequencies around the center frequency is a major
factor in determining the effects of radio interference. If your receiver encounters
a second signal that is too close to its center frequency, and the two bandwidths
end up overlapping too much, interference will result.The closer the interfering

and visual line of sight is minimal at the horizon.

signal is to the receiver’s center frequency, the less power is needed to cause inter-
ference. In the extreme case, if somebody turns on their microwave oven and its
emanations are on exactly the same frequency as yours, you may drop down in
speed even if the signal is very weak. Conversely, if something is operating on a
frequency that is quite far away from the center frequency of your AP’s receiver,
it can still interfere if its signal is strong enough.
Interference from Radio Transmitters
Interference usually occurs when radio transmitters and electronic equipment are
operated within close range of each other. Interference is caused by the following:
■
Incorrectly installed radio transmitting equipment
■
An intense radio signal from a nearby transmitter
■
Unwanted signals generated by the transmitting equipment and not
enough shielding or ﬁltering in the electronic equipment to prevent it
from picking up those unwanted signals
Any signal other than the desired signal is called an unwanted signal, or spu-
rious radiation. Spurious radiation includes harmonic radiation, usually in the form
of standing or traveling waves. Use a spectrum analyzer, a calibrated ﬁeld intensity
meter, or a frequency-selective voltmeter to measure unwanted radiation.A spec-
trum analyzer is a device that measures the frequency components of a radio
signal. It provides a visual image of how the amplitude of a radio signal varies in
relation to its frequency. If adjusting the channel does not solve the problem
completely, you should permanently install a low-pass band ﬁlter in the trans-
mitter antenna feed line after all the other accessories.
Standing waves are a form of spurious radiation causing undesired effects that
occur when two or more waves of the same frequency are present at the same
time and do not travel away from their source.This may happen, for example,
when the transmitter, transmission line (antenna cabling), or antenna are not
properly matched to each other. Incorrectly terminated or damaged antenna
cabling is a typical source of standing waves.When this happens, the transmitted
signal to the antenna is reduced because the damaged cable is transmitting
unwanted signals.

Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
Harmonics
Harmonics occur when signals are produced at two or three times the station’s
operating frequency in addition to the desired signals (see Figure 4.8). If the har-
monics fall on another locally used frequency, such as an AP channel, they are
likely to cause interference. Figure 4.8 shows how a signal from some radio
device may interfere with an AP set to channel 1.
These undesired transmissions occur at multiples of the original frequency. In
the example, harmonics of Device A, which is transmitting at 804 MHz, may
occur at 1.608 MHz (frequency × 2) or 2.412 MHz (frequency × 3). In addition,
Device A’s second harmonic is reduced in power by roughly half of the origi-
nating signal’s power.The third harmonic’s power is roughly half of the second
harmonic and so on.
As you can see in Figure 4.8, the harmonic frequencies of some device
(Device A) could present a potential problem in your wireless design.Although
Device A’s second harmonic does not interfere with your AP’s frequency channel,
the third harmonic, although weaker in strength, can affect your transmission and
reception for your channel 1 AP.
Application Considerations
Applications play a signiﬁcant role in the determination of a wireless implemen-
tation. Due to the high bandwidth utilization of some applications, you may need

to modify or completely remove a wireless design as an infrastructure solution. If
the high bandwidth and/or high trafﬁc application is not necessary on the wire-
less system you intend to deploy, you should ﬁlter that application’s trafﬁc from
the wireless network by installing a router between the wireless segment and the
wired segment.
Graphics-intensive applications, such as desktop publishing and CAD pro-
grams, can have signiﬁcant impact on your wireless design depending on how the
applications are used on the network. For example, if these ﬁles are stored on a
shared network device such as a ﬁle server, there will be some network impact
each time a user stores or retrieves a ﬁle.Typically these ﬁles are large (20 MB or
more), if the number of users is large and/or they store or retrieve ﬁles fre-
quently, the impact on the network becomes greater.The same is true for ﬁle
transfer applications.To determine if the impact on the network is signiﬁcant
enough to justify changing or removing your wireless design, you should perform
a baseline of network utilization for the existing network.A device or program
known as a protocol analyzer can give you this information by monitoring the
number, type, and size of packets traversing the network over a period of time.
Network management programs, such as Ciscoworks and HP Openview, will also
give you this type of information.
Structural Considerations
Physical considerations are classiﬁed into two major groups of issues that can
affect wireless connectivity and performance.These issues are path fading and
propagation losses. Below these two groups are speciﬁc causes that produce either
propagation loss or path fading.We explain propagation losses and path fading
and then we explore common causes for each, keeping in mind their affect on
wireless design.
As we have discussed in Chapter 2, radio waves are propagated through space
at the speed of light.This speed is attained assuming that there are no obstruc-
tions for the electromagnetic wave to pass through.The reason for this is because
electromagnetic waves pass through different substances at different speeds.The
greater the density of the substance, the slower the wave propagates through it.As
an example, a radio wave will travel faster through the air than it will water and
faster through water than a concrete building.
Under normal circumstances, as the signal radiates out from an antenna and it
encounters objects within the environment, it will exhibit one or more of the
following reactions:The signal may penetrate the object, reﬂect off the object, or
be absorbed by the object.
www.syngress.com

154
Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
In most cases, all of these reactions will occur to varying degrees, depending
on the density and type of object encountered.This is the propagation of the
signal.The strength of the signal decreases as it propagates. Penetration, reﬂection,
and absorption all factor into the signal as it travels, each taking with it some
amount of signal strength.These actions not only weaken the signal, but they may
affect the direction in which the electromagnetic wave travels and the speed at
which it travels.
As the radio wave propagates through the Earth’s atmosphere and encounters
objects within the environment, the strength of the signal will decrease.Any dis-
tortion of a wave’s amplitude, phase, or direction can affect the strength of the
received signal.This is known as path fading.The strength of the received signal is
equal to the strength of the transmitted signal minus path fading.
As you can see propagation loss and path fading are very similar.The differ-
ence is really a matter of perspective. Receivers can suffer from path fading and
transmitters suffer from propagation losses. Ideally, because most wireless LAN
radios both send and receive, elimination or minimization of propagation losses
and path fading are extremely desirable.
Differing environments can have substantial structural considerations to work
around or overcome to successfully implement a wireless LAN solution.The fol-
lowing list takes a look at some of the common problems encountered in various
environments and the solutions or alternatives available for each.
■
Hospitals The most obvious issue that comes to mind in any medical
environment is compatibility of wireless networks with existing medical
equipment and, more importantly, medical diagnostic devices.
Another consideration is the need for many healthcare providers to
meet federal regulations in terms of their information systems. HIPAA
(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) is causing
a major reassessment regarding privacy and related issues in healthcare
information systems. Because of the lack of security in previously imple-
mented wireless LANs used in these organizations, data encryption is a
must for compliance in these facilities.
Structurally, hospitals offer a variety of radio frequency obstacles.You
should be aware of X-ray areas in particular, because most hospitals have
lead-lined or extremely thick walls surrounding these areas to prevent
X-ray bleed-through. Consider these areas “dead zones” to radio fre-
quency. If coverage is necessary in these areas, you will have to install
your antenna directly in each room requiring coverage. Full site surveys
www.syngress.com

Wireless Network Design • Chapter 4

are recommended for all areas of a hospital, and all equipment normally
used in the hospital should be on during the survey.
■
Warehouses Warehouses generally contain stock and rows of shelving.
This presents coverage problems due to the density of the stock items
and the metal construction of the shelving. Be sure to ﬁnd out what the
current stock levels are when performing your site survey. If the stock
levels are high, you will get a much more accurate picture of coverage in
your wireless implementation.The type of product that is stored in the
warehouse makes a difference as well. For example, a fully stocked ware-
house that contains only cases of empty plastic water jugs will have
better coverage with fewer APs than the same warehouse containing
cases of full plastic water jugs.
■
Metal construction In general, wireless LAN radio devices do not
penetrate metal construction very well, if at all. Keep this in mind when
designing your wireless LAN. In most cases, you will need to place
antennas in each area that is contained by metal construction.Your site
survey will aid you in verifying this requirement.
■
Other construction The materials used in construction of walls, pil-
lars, and supports can also cause radio frequency impairments and impair
coverage in a given area. Exterior walls tend to be thicker and contain
more reinforcement materials than interior walls and partitions. Rebar
(metal rods used to increase the strength of concrete construction) rein-
forced cinder block, or concrete walls and pillars can present a design
issue in most facilities that use them. In general, the denser the material,
the more difﬁcult it will be for radio waves to penetrate.
■
RF-producing devices In addition to the construction and applica-
tion considerations in your site survey and wireless design, you should
constantly be on the lookout for potential interference from other elec-
tronic devices.There many devices that can potentially cause interfer-
ence and require you to change your AP channel assignments.The most
common culprits are 2.4 GHz cordless phones and microwave ovens. Be
sure to have someone use these devices if they are inside a coverage area
in your design.This will help you to determine the best channel to use
on your AP.
Other potential interfering devices can be arc welding and telemetry
equipment, 2.4 GHz lighting systems, and Spectralink phone systems.

Spectralink phone systems are used to provide cellular phone coverage
within a company and is based on the IEEE 802.11b standard—the
same standard used for wireless LANs.
Andromeda Manufacturing Rough Design
Armed with the knowledge gained from this and previous sections, you are now
able to produce a rough design for the ﬁctitious company,Andromeda
Manufacturing.We number the prospective rough wireless designs for ease of
identiﬁcation.The following numbers will represent the following wireless
designs (also see Figure 4.9):
1. Point-to-multipoint wireless implementation from the headquarters
facility to the warehouse and manufacturing facilities.
2. Interior wireless implementation for the manufacturing facility.
The site survey will provide the details to placement and any conditions
affecting rough designs. It will verify the designs and provide all the detailed
information required to install the wireless equipment, ﬁnalizing the designs for
implementation.

Wireless Design 1
The goal of this rough design is to provide data connectivity back to the head-
quarters facility, allowing users in the manufacturing and warehouse facilities to
send and receive e-mail from all facilities and send “live” information of manufac-
turing production runs and warehouse shipping and receiving information.
To accomplish these goals a point-to-multipoint wireless implementation is
proposed. Based on information provided by Andromeda Manufacturing, the
rough design for this implementation will consist of one Cisco wireless bridge at
each of the three facilities. In addition, an exterior omni-directional antenna will
be placed at the headquarters facility and one directional antenna will be placed
on each of the two remote facilities.The remote facilities will send their radio
signals in a tight beam into the circular radio coverage (provided by the omni-
directional antenna) at the headquarters facility.This should provide reliable and
efﬁcient connectivity between the facilities.
Wireless Design 2
The goal of this rough design is to provide interior mobile coverage for inven-
tory users in the warehouse facility.This will allow users performing inventories
to input data directly into the data entry system as they inventory without having
to wait until they can access a ﬁxed terminal.
Interior wireless coverage is required throughout the warehouse, speciﬁcally
in the aisles between the rows of shelving.The warehouse manager has restricted
hardware placement to each far end of the facility (see Figure 4.10), therefore the
rough design calls for seven Cisco APs, four at one end of the warehouse and
three at the opposite end with directional antennas providing narrow coverage
between the racks and shelves, down each aisle.This will meet the requirement
for complete warehouse coverage while staying within the limitations mandated
by the warehouse manager.
Now that you have the rough designs created, you will need to verify those
designs, and in doing so, determine what changes, if any, will be required to make
the designs feasible.The wireless site survey will provide you with this informa-
tion. It will allow you to determine the antenna types required, cabling require-
ments for the APs, bridges and antennas, power requirements, and installation
locations of all hardware. In a nutshell, the site survey will give you the details
required for your designs.

environment while staying within the best practices of the wireless technology.
This is not always an easy task.As you have seen in previous sections, wireless
may not be the answer to your business needs, or the cost to work around some
business issue may outweigh the practicality of the installation.You will have to
be knowledgeable on the wireless equipment you are installing and the wired
equipment with which you may be interfacing, the physical environment, the
application considerations and the structural environment.
A site survey performed by you or a certiﬁed wireless professional, will verify
the feasibility of the initial (rough) design in the face of obstacles such as wired
connectivity limitations, radio hazards, and application requirements.The survey
will help you determine the number of APs needed throughout a facility to pro-
vide the desired coverage, and it will determine the placement of those APs,
detailing the necessary information for placement. Point-to-point surveys will
also provide you with detailed information for placement of both the bridge
units and antennas as well as determine feasibility of the link desired.With the
information gathered from a site survey, a site survey report can be generated to
assist you in “selling” the productivity and return-on-investment beneﬁts of wire-
less LANs to the decision makers in your company. For those who already under-
stand the beneﬁts of wireless, the successful wireless site survey will allow you to
properly install the wireless LAN and have efﬁcient, reliable wireless access.
In your site survey, whether interior or exterior, try to identify potential prob-
lems up front and discuss how these issues will be handled.This can potentially save
you a lot of time and trouble during the installation.You don’t want to discover
these issues during the installation or the “go live” period.A faulty or incomplete
wireless site survey can be detrimental to your business for a very long time.
In this chapter, we have covered many design considerations. Keeping those
design considerations in mind, we now discuss what is needed to prepare and
perform a site survey and the differences in performing exterior versus interior
surveys. Best practices for surveying are integrated into this section, in addition to
examples of creative approaches to speciﬁc issues.
Preparation
Preparation for your wireless site survey will provide you important information
needed to perform the survey and will guide you in your design process. In gen-
eral, ﬁnd out as much about the facility and business environment as you can
before the performing your survey.You will have enough to keep you busy
without having to worry about whether you are allowed in an area without
escort or interviewing to ﬁnd out what possible RF interference is in or around

the coverage areas.To this end, the pre-site survey questionnaire was created and
indeed, it will become your friend.The following section contains a sample ques-
tionnaire form; as you use this form, you may ﬁnd it useful to change or add sec-
tions to tailor this to your speciﬁc requirements.

Other Preparations
In order to perform a successful and complete wireless site survey, the following
items and/or services should be made available where applicable.
■
In-building surveys will require blueprints, CAD drawings, or if those
are not available, ﬁre escape drawings of the facility.These should detail
the location of ofﬁce spaces, cubicles, and equipment to scale.
■
Point-to-point surveys will require topographical maps of the area to
include all the facilities involved in the survey.
■
Provide a dedicated escort, if required, to allow full access to the facilities
being surveyed.
■
Provide facility identiﬁcation or badges, if necessary for full access.
■
Provide any facility guidelines or restrictions concerning equipment
mounting.
■
If the facility is a union facility, please provide a declaration of operating
equipment limitations, if any.
■
Provide information regarding asbestos construction, if applicable.
www.syngress.com

Wireless Network Design • Chapter 4
163
■
If the facility has been designated a historical site, please provide any
limitations or speciﬁcations for modifying the interior or exterior of the
building.
■
Be prepared to provide an Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) representative where regulations prohibit non-
OSHA certiﬁed personnel from access or installation.
■
Be prepared to provide qualiﬁed personnel to access facility rooftops for
the duration of any point-to-point survey.
If you do not ﬁll out the pre-site survey form yourself and plan on giving the
pre-site survey form to a customer or client, as is the case with larger organiza-
tions where Information Systems performs requests for other departments or
divisions, do not be surprised if many of the more technical questions go unan-
swered. Remember, your customer is not likely to know what Wired Equivalent
Protocol (WEP), rate shifting, or even what LAN or WAN is, so it will be difﬁ-
cult for them to know if they have it or need it.You will need to be prepared to
explain to the customer, in layman’s terms, what some of the various technical
questions are asking for.You will be in a much better position to survey and pro-
duce a survey report if you already have these questions answered.
It is not uncommon for a client to request 11Mbps coverage in all areas in
the questionnaire, but after your survey, they ﬁnd out how many APs are required
to provide that coverage and your customer then decides that 5.5 or 2 Mbps is
sufﬁcient for several of the areas. If you do not follow-up the questionnaire with
a meeting or phone call to discuss the answers you received, you may ﬁnd your-
self spending additional time to resurvey your coverage areas for the lower speeds.
By asking why your customer needs 11 Mbps coverage everywhere, for example,
you can ensure that you will survey an area only once.
Depending on your local laws and regulations, you may have other inquiries
that you will want to add to this questionnaire. In the United States, such things
as safety requirements and regulations may impede or hinder your site survey, so
you should be aware of these regulations and plan accordingly. OSHA will some-
times require you, through the business, to complete paperwork verifying your
understanding and compliance of speciﬁc or unique work safety requirements in
a given area.An example would be, surveys performed in a biohazard or chemical
manufacturing area, requiring body suits and/or masks.
During your installation, ﬁre codes for ofﬁce, manufacturing, healthcare, and
other facilities will need to be adhered to. Prior to your survey, you will need to

ﬁnd out if the facility contains ﬁrewalls. No, we are not talking about the ﬁrewalls
used in your business to keep out Internet intruders, we are talking about ﬁrewalls
used in building construction. In building construction, a ﬁrewall keeps a ﬁre from
spreading from one building or part of a building to another. Firewalls are used to
divide overall structures into allowable areas permitted by building code. Building
codes vary by locality and country. Firewalls can be difﬁcult to spot if you are not
looking for them, thus we have added them to the list of questions to be answered
prior to performing the survey. Because ﬁrewalls typically extend to the roof of
most buildings, it is important to determine during the survey, if you will need to
penetrate a ﬁrewall for any reason. During the survey, it is unlikely you will have
need to penetrate the ﬁrewall, but you may discover this need for your implemen-
tation. In the event that you must penetrate a ﬁrewall, procedures exist in your
locality for this. In the U.S., most of these procedures must be compliant with the
National Electric Code (NEC).You can usually obtain copies of the NEC from
local electrical suppliers. In my locality, penetration of a ﬁrewall requires a special
ﬁre-stop caulking to be applied around the penetration point and an inspection of
the work by local ﬁre authorities afterwards.
In addition to ﬁrewalls, another typical ﬁre code related question commonly
encountered is whether plenum cable is required for this facility. Plenum cable is
cable that is coated with a ﬁre-retardant coating (usually Teﬂon) so that in case of
a ﬁre, it does not give off toxic gasses and smoke as it burns.Twisted-pair and
coaxial cable are made in plenum versions. In building construction, the plenum
is the space that is used for air circulation in heating and air conditioning systems,
typically between the structural ceiling and the suspended ceiling or under a
raised ﬂoor.The plenum space is typically used to house the communication
cables for the building’s computer and telephone network(s).This impacts your
installation and design only if you must have either your antenna cabling or your
data cabling running through plenum areas of a facility to get to your APs and/or
bridges, and the facility requires plenum cabling. Knowledge of plenum cabling
requirements in your facility prior to the survey will help you determine how
you may have to cable your wireless gear for your design and implementation.
You do not want to cause undue strife by performing certain functions
during the site survey that union personnel are required to perform, such as run-
ning a man-lift to get to the ceiling of a facility.The questionnaire will help you
determine what coordination with other parties, if any, will be necessary to com-
plete the survey.
Another preparation to consider is the need for permits to work in and on
historical sites. Due to the nature of these sites, you must use extreme care to
www.syngress.com

Wireless Network Design • Chapter 4
165
ensure that you make little or no changes to the facility or site.You should con-
sider the differences required in surveying these sites as opposed to installing.
Permission from one or more authorities may be needed to allow the installation,
and even the survey, to occur.
Based on the preliminary information obtained from your questionnaire, you
should be able to form one or more rough designs that may accomplish the
desired coverage.You will use these rough designs to test during your site survey.
The last section of your questionnaire contains some very important requests.The
ﬁrst of these is the request to have blueprints, CAD drawings, or ﬁre escape
drawings of the facility and any obstacles, such as ofﬁces, cubicles, and equipment,
to be diagramed to scale.This is important for your preparation because without
it you cannot create any rough designs for anticipated coverage.To do this while
surveying takes a signiﬁcant amount of time and will force you to start your
testing with no predetermined designs to guide you through the creative aspect
of the survey.
The other extremely important request in the last section of the question-
naire pertains to escorts, badges, Ids, and in general, access to facilities or areas
needed to survey or areas you must go through to get to the survey areas. I know
there is nothing more frustrating than to wait 20 or 30 minutes to start surveying
a particular area because the security guard doesn’t know who you are and will
not let you into an area or facility, especially when you have just toted 50 pounds
of gear up three ﬂights of stairs (no elevator). Do this for several areas or facilities
and you may have blown several hours just to get into the place. Even if the
person with whom you deal with is aware that you are going to be surveying,
verify this ahead of time by speaking to the manager or security company in
charge of the actual areas you intend on visiting. If an escort is needed, conﬁrm
that they are actually at the location prior to going to the site.They may have
called in sick, or an emergency is preventing them from being there, in which
case the area or facility may not have someone else to escort you. In the case of
badges and IDs, this is usually a little easier provided that your company doesn’t
require “special” badges to get you into certain areas. If this is the case, you
should request the appropriate badge(s) as far ahead of time as possible and con-
ﬁrm that the badge is ready before you go to the area or facility requiring it.
One more thought on preparation: Understand that surveys are typically less
intrusive than the actual implementations of a wireless system.As you prepare to
survey, always keep in mind what it will take to actually take to install your
system and how this will affect production of services or goods in the particular
environment. Is the business a 24/7 shop? Does the business have a weekly or
www.syngress.com

166
Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
monthly business cycle that is critical? When and where can you  install the wire-
less system so that it will have minimal impact on the business? These are but a
few of the keys to the success of your implementation.
Infrastructure Awareness
In order to properly perform a site survey, you should make yourself aware of the
environment you are surveying.What types of media and infrastructure devices
are used in this environment? Will bleed-through of radio waves affect any sensi-
tive equipment in the area you are in? What about ﬂoors above and below you in
multiﬂoor facilities? Will you receive interference from or transmit interference to
any devices? Is there adequate power and network connectivity for your APs?
These questions are a good starting point for making yourself aware of the envi-
ronment in which you are surveying and in which you intend to install a wireless
system.
In the next section, we describe the common infrastructure items you should
aware of while preparing and performing a wireless site survey.
What Types of Network Media Are Used?
Be aware of the media types that encompass the network. Most networks likely
use some type of copper cabling, and many use ﬁber optic cabling for backbone
or longer runs.As you are surveying a facility and deciding on locations for your
APs or bridges, you should also be looking for ways to connect them to the net-
work.
The most frequently used cabling in today’s networks are Category 5 (Cat5)
or Category 5e (Cat5e) unshielded twisted pair (UTP). It consists of eight strands
of solid copper wires, grouped into four pairs. Each pair is twisted, at a speciﬁc
rate per inch, to create magnetic “shielding” when current is applied.This helps
UTP to avoid cross-talk or interference from the other strands.
In Category 5e UTP cabling, the four already twisted pairs of cable (as in
Cat5) are twisted together inside the cable sheath to provide additional (though
not complete) shielding from outside interference.This is why it is called
Category 5 enhanced. Cat5 and Cat5e are typically terminated with RJ-45 con-
nectors or punched down to a patch panel or wall jack. In an Ethernet topology,
Cat5 or Cat5e can be run a maximum of 100 meters or 328 feet.
The typical sheathing on UTP cabling is made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
PVC can melt, smoke, and give off toxic fumes in the event of a ﬁre.As we have
discussed in the preparation section, the alternative to PVC sheathing is plenum
www.syngress.com

Wireless Network Design • Chapter 4
167
cabling. Upon ﬁrst observation, plenum is exactly the same as normal UTP,
except the cable is much stiffer and harder to work with. In addition, the cable
will be marked with a code, for example “CMP”, which indicates a plenum
rated, unshielded cable.
The following are some common sheath (jacket) types and their ratings:
■
Teﬂon Plenum rated
■
FR-PVC Flame-retardant PVC
■
PVC Non-plenum PVC
The following are some common copper wire types for UTP:
■
CM Communications cables
■
CMP Communications plenum cable
■
CMR Communications riser cables that passes the UL1666 test
■
CM Communications cables that passes the UL15812 test
When calculating cable runs for either your wired network connection or
your antenna connection, always measure what the actual cable path will be, do
not measure a straight line from end to end because bends or turns in the cable
path can add signiﬁcantly to the cable length. In your design, this could mean
cable runs that are too long for your topology causing loss of data or bad perfor-
mance and will also throw off any estimates you may obtain from wiring con-
tractors or unnecessarily increase the cost of the implementation if you are
installing the wiring.
Do not run cabling at an angle; instead, try to run cabling as straight as pos-
sible using 90-degree turns where necessary to avoid obstacles.Avoid running
cable on top of ballasts in ﬂuorescent light ﬁxtures, because this will wreak havoc
by interfering in your data transmission through the cable.
Always calculate for service loops at both ends of your cable run. Service
loops give you or your wiring contractor some “play” in the cable in the event
the cable has to run around some unforeseen object or in case the cable must be
terminated numerous times. Service loops are usually an additional 10–15 percent
of the estimated cable length. For example, on a 200-foot run, an additional 20
feet to act as a service loop is typical.This would work out to 10 feet on each
end of the cable.

Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
If your design calls for ﬁber connectivity to the APs or bridges, you will
require a media transceiver because Cisco radios only interface the wired media
via an RJ-45 connection.
What Operating Systems,
Protocols, and Drivers Are Used?
Different operating systems can use different protocols on the local area network.
These protocols have different overhead and bandwidth requirements. Some are
more efﬁcient than others.Ask about the operating systems that are being used
for the clients and servers and ﬁnd out speciﬁcally what protocols are being used
in the current LAN and which ones will be required to traverse the wireless
LAN.The reason for this is to determine what protocols, if any, can be ﬁltered
from accessing the wireless LAN and thus increase performance.
Some drivers are not yet available or supported from Cisco. For example,
Cisco provides drivers for Macintosh operating system 9.x only. In addition,
Cisco PCI client adapters are not supported for use with Apple computers.
What Hubs Are Used?
Hubs may be 10,100 or 10/100 hubs.The Cisco APs have 10/100 auto-sensing
ports, and they will try to work on either port, but whenever possible you should
try to connect via a 100 Mbps–capable port.
What Switches Are Used?
Access points communicate with each other on Layer 2 of the OSI model.Access
points communicate with each other only if they’re going to have clients
roaming from one AP to another, in this situation those two APs would need to
be on the same broadcast domain. If for some reason two APs that are going to
have clients roaming between them cannot be on the same broadcast domain, the
Layer 3 devices must be conﬁgured to pass required packets for the APs to com-
municate with each other.
It is the client that determines if it will change APs, and, of course, the pre-
requisite is that the client has an encryption key for the new AP and a matching
service set ID (SSID) as well.The client uses three criteria to make this determi-
nation: signal strength, packet error rate, and AP load.
Switches have the capability for each port to be seen as a “virtual” LAN
(VLAN).VLANs may be grouped together to form larger VLANs. Switches are
designed for wired networks with stationary users.They were not designed to
www.syngress.com

Wireless Network Design • Chapter 4
169
handle mobile users. If the switch sees each port as a VLAN, and there are APs on
each port, the switch is not set up to handle users moving from one VLAN to
another.
Cisco APs are set up to work with these switch features.When a client roams
from AP1 to AP2,AP2 sends a multicast packet with the source address of the
roaming client.This packet is sent by the AP on behalf of the client and updates
the switch’s addressable memory.AP1 can then forward any packets that it has for
the client to AP2.
Your application may not be set up to handle a switched network.The appli-
cation may send out broadcast packets. If the client is connected to an AP that is
not on the same virtual LAN as the server(s), the broadcast may never reach their
destination(s)
A potential solution to this problem is to group the ports with the APs con-
nected to them with the ports the host is using to form a VLAN.This may or may
not work for you depending on requirements of the host to your wired clients.
Another solution is to network all the APs to the same hub the host uses.
Cable distance limitations may make this impossible. Still another solution may be
to network all of your APs together via hubs and have them connect to the same
hub the host uses.This is not a viable solution if the host is remote.This solution
may present problems for some people. Under the 802.3 standard, when using a
switch, you should not extend beyond two hops when using a 100 Mbps net-
work.Although the wireless link between the client and the AP is not considered
a hop, a remote host may be well past the two hop limit.
The ideal solution for switching across VLANs connected to APs is to install a
router or Layer 3 switch between the VLANs to perform routing across the
VLANs, thus providing the ability to deny or allow the appropriate trafﬁc
between VLANs.
What Routers Are Used?
Routers present problems similar to switches in that they stop broadcast packets
and may present a problem for the application or for clients trying to use DHCP.
Static routes conﬁgured in the router may be necessary if the users on the wire-
less segment intend to use a remote host.
What Bridges Are Used?
Bridges can also present challenges because of their tables. Most bridges used
today build dynamic tables. Some facilities may need to build their tables manu-
ally, sometimes by choice or sometimes because they are using older bridges.
www.syngress.com

170
Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
Because most IT personnel are not eager to work with these tables, you may
need to conﬁgure them in order for wireless LAN applications to work properly,
especially if they will be accessing a remote host.
How Is Power Supplied?
Cisco APs and bridges require power to function.The 340 series APs and bridges
use traditional power inputs; the 350 series APs and bridges utilize inline power.
Inline power consists of sending DC power over standard Category 5 UTP cable
up to 100 meters. Instead of requiring wall power,APs and bridge devices can
utilize power provided from Cisco line power-enabled devices, such as Cisco
Catalyst Switches and line power patch panels.You can also use a line power
injector, included with the Cisco 350 series APs and bridges, to provide the inline
power required from a traditional wall outlet.
During the site survey, you will need to look for methods of power for your
AP and/or bridge devices for the locations in your design requirements.Take
note of any areas that do not have power available and consider how you will
provide the power—traditionally or via inline power.A note on inline power; if
your design requires the wireless network to stay up in the event of a power
outage, inline power is much more efﬁcient than traditional power because you
can place an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) on the switch or line power
patch panel that is providing the power to the AP. Otherwise, UPS will be neces-
sary for each and every one of your AP or bridge devices, as well as the switches
or hubs they are connected to, to maintain connectivity to the network during
the power outage.
Preparing a Site Survey Kit
A site survey kit contains all the equipment necessary to evaluate, test, and record
the possible wireless designs and their implementation ramiﬁcations for a given
site.We discuss the different types of equipment you should have to perform a
site survey, when and where they are used, and we provide you with sources for
some of the more difﬁcult equipment to obtain.
Although not speciﬁcally listed in the following sections, note that you will
need a device, preferably a portable device, capable of running a Cisco wireless
client adapter and the Cisco client software and utilities in order to perform a
wireless site survey. I use a lightweight laptop computer with plenty of battery life
(I actually have two batteries). I use Windows 2000 as my operating system, but
you can equally use Linux,Windows 95, 98, or NT to run the client software.
www.syngress.com

Wireless Network Design • Chapter 4
171
Many of the sections list additional or optimal tools and equipment for a spe-
ciﬁc task.Your need for this additional or optimal equipment has much to do
with your role in wireless site surveys. Differentiation is made between a one-
time or limited site surveyor, for example, an information systems employee at a
company intending to implement wireless for themselves, and a surveyor who
intends to perform multiple surveys over time, as with a wireless consultant or
engineer.
NOTE
Your site survey kit should deﬁnitely be a portable unit. If you intend to
perform multiple surveys, as is the case with wireless engineers and con-
sultants, invest in foam equipment cases to protect your survey equip-
ment from damage due to weather and the various bumps and bangs of
moving your equipment around.
Often, site surveys are requested on very short notice, and the ability
to carry the carry the case in the trunk or backseat of a car, or check it as
luggage allows you to travel with your equipment and solves the
problem of your kit being lost or detained during shipping.
Using Client Adapters in the Survey
Cisco recommends that you survey with the wireless network adapter you intend
to use in your rough design.Therefore, if you intend to have desktop computers
act as wireless workstations in your design, you should use the PCI or ISA client
adapter to perform your site survey.This is not always practical, especially if the
intended workstations are large and bulky and are not located where they will be
located under the actual implementation.A combination of creativity and skill are
required in this scenario. Different client adapters can have differing types of
antenna connections, giving you a variable in the spread pattern of the antennas
between different client adapters. Receive sensitivity, maximum transmit power,
and typical indoor and outdoor ranges vary from the Cisco 340 series to 350
series client adapters producing several other variables to consider.
The best way to handle the desktop workstation scenario is to either provide or
request from your client a cart that has a desktop workstation with the client
adapter card you intend to use for the implementation.This gives you the ﬂexibility
to move about during your survey and eliminates from consideration many of the
variables related to using a client adapter that is not intended for the design.

Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
You can ﬁnd more information regarding client adapters and their speciﬁca-
tions in Chapter 8.
Using APs and Bridges in the Survey
Obviously the most critical component needed to perform a wireless site survey
is the radio devices themselves.You typically need only one AP for interior sur-
veys and two bridges for exterior surveys. Be sure to have your AP or bridge
console cable with you to allow you to conﬁgure the devices directly.The con-
sole cable for the AP and bridge is a straight-through cable with 9-pin male to 
9-pin female connectors. Previously, these console cables did not come with the
www.syngress.com
Surveying with LEAP as a Requirement
In order to conduct a proper wireless site survey that takes into account
Cisco’s Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) or stan-
dards-based EAP, you must have an authenticator capable of supporting
it on the network you are surveying. If you perform or expect to perform
multiple wireless site surveys, you should outﬁt your survey laptop with
Windows 2000 Professional Server and install IAS services conﬁgured for
Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) and EAP to allow
you test authentication against your design. Typically, LEAP and EAP do
not add signiﬁcant performance degradation, however, you should
survey with this conﬁgured and tested to ensure design functionality.
The following bullets list Cisco’s requirements for LEAP or EAP with
their equipment:
■The minimum Cisco client adapter ﬁrmware version required
for LEAP support is 4.13.
■Cisco AP ﬁrmware release 11.00 is the minimum version
required to support LEAP or EAP. Release 11.00 is the ﬁrst
version of ﬁrmware that enables the AP to be conﬁgured as
an EAP or LEAP authenticator.
■The AP requires an EAP authenticator. The RADIUS server
must support the type of authentication you are using (either
EAP or LEAP).
Designing & Planning…

Wireless Network Design • Chapter 4
173
APs or bridges, but are now being supplied. If you really prefer using the browser-
based conﬁguration tool over the console, set the IP address of your devices and
laptop to a network other than the subnet you are on to allow you to move from
subnet to subnet without reconﬁguring your laptop and radio devices each time.
For example, if the network in the facility you are surveying is 192.168.0.0, set
your laptop and APs for network 172.16.0.0 to prevent conﬂicts and allow you to
go to any subnetwork without reconﬁguring your laptop and AP.
Some conﬁguration will have to take place on your APs or bridges prior to
surveying.You should conﬁgure the devices exactly as they will be used in a
potential implementation. So if your design requires a wireless network that is
optimally 11 Mbps with rate shifting to 5.5 Mbps,WEP encryption, LEAP
authentication, and mandatory service set identiﬁers, conﬁgure your AP with
these parameters.All of these conﬁguration parameters are explained in detail in
Chapter 5.
You should always carry more than one AP with you when surveying.This
allows you to continue to survey in the event your AP fails for any reason. In a
previous survey, I dropped an AP from a ladder and had I not had a backup AP, I
would have had to reschedule the site survey while I waited for my spare AP to
be shipped.
Choosing Antennas for the Survey
There is no single antenna that is perfect for all wireless design applications.A
variety of antennas are offered by Cisco because the variety of wireless design
applications possible requires them.Your choice and placement of an antenna is in
many cases, dictated by your customer.Your customer may not want the antenna
to be visible; or it may be located in a high trafﬁc area requiring a low proﬁle
antenna. By carrying a variety of antennas, you will be prepared for any situation.
The minimum collection of antennas should include, but not be limited to,
the following:
■
2.2 dBi “Rubber Duckies” These are the rubber antennas that come
with your Cisco AP or bridge
■
5.2 dBi Ceiling Mount
■
5.2 dBi Mast Mount
■
5.2 dBi Ground Plane
■
5.2 dBi Diversity Pillar Mount
www.syngress.com

174
Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
■
6.0 dBi Patch
■
8.5 dBi Patch
■
13.5 dBi Yagi
If you will be performing site surveys where you are aware that you will be
using an antenna that is not in your kit, carry that antenna as well.Always survey
with the antenna you intend to use. Do not use a different antenna and attempt
to guess what the coverage will be.The reason you are performing the site survey
is to take the guesswork out of the installation.
Antenna coverage is one of the most critical factors in a wireless system
deployment because it applies directly to a client’s ability to roam and communi-
cate with the wired network.A large selection of antennas is required to handle a
variety of potential networks from warehouses, retail ﬂoors, outdoors, and ofﬁces.
Although you choose among a variety of antennas, only two versions exist:
■
Omni-directional  Provide a coverage pattern that is mostly circular
and is usually used for indoor implementations.The signal is strongest at
the center (nearest to the antenna) and gets weaker as the signal radiates
outward. Mast mount antennas are examples of omni-directional
antennas.
■
Directional  Frequently installed outdoors.The coverage area is similar
to a triangle, and it gets weaker as the signal extends outward.The cov-
erage area varies from antenna to antenna, and coverage can range from
12 to 65 degrees.Yagi and solid dish antennas are examples of directional
antennas.
Providing Battery Packs and Inverters for the Survey
When you perform your survey, you will need to provide power for your APs
and/or bridges.You will not be able to count on the site having the appropriate
power in the proper locations for every survey or part of a survey performed.
Therefore, you will need to provide some type of portable power. Because most
wireless radios, including Cisco APs and bridges, utilize AC power, you will need,
in addition to a battery pack, an inverter to convert the DC power of the battery
pack to AC.You should ensure that the battery pack provides you with enough
power for about eight hours or a days worth of surveying. It would not do to
have to reschedule your survey because your battery packs lost power in the
middle of your survey.
www.syngress.com

Wireless Network Design • Chapter 4
175
I have also had to use the battery pack to supply power to my laptop com-
puter during site surveys that extended beyond my laptop battery’s capacity.As
you can see, choosing the right number and capacity of your battery packs can be
crucial to your site survey.
There are several approaches to providing power for your APs for the pur-
poses of surveying.The most common approach is to purchase commercially
available battery packs and inverters.The downside to this is that you will have
two pieces of extra equipment to carry with you and hook up for each AP you
are surveying with, in addition to the cost of the equipment. If you are per-
forming a survey for your company, and you are fairly sure this will be the only
wireless implementation for some time, you may want to just rent several battery
packs and inverters for the period of the survey.
Some commercially available battery packs have inverters built in to them,
thus reducing the amount of equipment to carry.A company called Statpower
produces a line of mobile battery packs with inverters built in to them, called
xPower.The 21-amp-hour rated xPower300 will power one Cisco 350 series AP
for well over 12 hours, a larger 40-amp-hour version on wheels is also available.
Keep in mind that most inverters have only two outlets on them, so if you plan
on powering several devices, you should purchase some inexpensive ﬁve- or six-
outlet power strips to plug into the inverter outlets.
Remember, you are going to be carrying this equipment around, so weight
plays a factor in choosing your battery packs as well.The xPower300 battery
pack/inverter combination weighs about 18 pounds. Most of this weight is due
to the lead in the batteries themselves.The carrying handle, however, makes this
relatively easy to move about.
Another alternative for portable power is to build your own battery pack and
inverter combination.This requires good knowledge of electronics, but can be
affordably done and can accommodate not only the power components but also
the AP or bridge in one unit.
Providing Tools for the Survey
There are many other tools you should have in your site survey kit to aid you in
the successful completion of your wireless site survey. Some of the tools listed in
this section should be considered needs, whereas others can be considered “nice
to have” or wants.This section provides you with the extra items you will need
to perform your site survey and provide an explanation of their uses.
www.syngress.com

176
Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
NOTE
In addition to the tools and equipment needed for your site survey kit,
you need some speciﬁc tools for installation. Among these are a cordless
drill with a drill bit set containing both hole saw bits and dry core bits to
makes holes in masonry block and brick, in sizes up to two inches. These
are needed to penetrate interior and exterior walls for running antenna
cabling.
You will also require a caulk gun and clear silicone caulking to seal
the area around the cabling on the exterior holes. I sometimes use
expanding foam sealant for this.
You may also need to provide some quarter-inch plywood to serve as
backing for wall mounting APs and bridges.
■
Graph paper, ruler, pencil and sticky notes These simple, inexpen-
sive tools will probably be the most valuable tools you can have in your
site survey kit. Even if your client has provided you with scaled diagrams
of the survey area(s), you may still need to write down installation
and/or design notes during the survey or draw an area to scale on your
graph paper that is not on the client-provided diagram. Post-It or sticky
notes are also invaluable when you need to make notes on a diagram
that your customer may need back (and does not want changes written
on it); this allows you to copy the diagram with your notes on it.
■
Markers Once your AP, bridge, and/or antenna placement is deter-
mined in your site survey, you will need to mark their location for ease
of installation later. Location markers should be very bright, resistant to
dust, grease, and water, and be easy to remove when necessary.They
should be sturdy but temporary.
■
Surveyor’s tape This is probably the best solution for temporary
markers. It comes in a variety of colors and is inexpensive.You can tie,
tape, or pin it to just about any surface. I prefer the ﬂuorescent colored
surveyor’s tape. It is much easier to see when marking locations, espe-
cially in areas that are not well lighted. I usually carry two colors of this
tape at a minimum. One color is used to mark the location of the AP, or
bridge and the other is used as an antenna placement marker.

■
Measuring devices  In order for you or your customer to get accurate
installation costs, you will have to provide many measurements in the
site survey report.And these measurements need to be as accurate as
possible. If you guess the Cat5 run to be 300 feet, and it turns out to be
380 feet, the cost for this portion of the installation could be more than
anticipated.
Your kit should include a measuring wheel to allow you to accu-
rately measure cable distances. Of course, you can use more advanced
measurement devices, such as laser and ultrasonic range ﬁnders, but a
measuring wheel will give you the measurement detail you will need.
Vertical measurements, such as ﬂoor to ceiling distances, can be best
accomplished with a simple rope marked in ten-foot increments.
Note that counting structural features such as ﬂoor tiles, ceiling tiles,
or cinder blocks typically does not give accurate measurements of dis-
tance.This is because much of the time these structural elements are cut
or shortened to accommodate the site architecture and are therefore
unreliable for measurement.

installations, you will frequently need gain access to ceilings and roofs of
buildings.A ladder in most buildings will get you to the ceiling.
However, in warehouses where the ceilings are typically very high
(20–30 feet) and to reach rooftops that do not have interior access, you
will need some type of powered equipment such as a forklift with a per-
sonnel basket or a man-lift to give you access to these areas.This equip-
ment can be rented for a day or two or perhaps your customer may
already have this type of equipment for their facility.
In addition, you should purchase a safety harness for working in
these areas. Several different types of safety harnesses are available with
differing levels of protection. I recommend a full body harness and some
type of compatible lifeline or lanyard, preferably self-retracting to allow
ease of movement. For insurance reasons, some organizations do not
permit this type of work by anyone other than their own employees.
■
Digital camera A digital camera is a very useful tool in your site
survey kit. It will allow you to take pictures during your survey of the
coverage areas, antenna, and radio device placements, and it will allow
you to insert these directly into your site survey report after the survey.

Laser Laser pointers are used for point-to-point wireless site surveys to
determine precise line of site.This is one of the items I mentioned as
“nice to have.”The green lasers are the best to use because they are easier
to see than the red lasers.The highest power for a green laser allowed by
U.S. law is 5 milliwatts. Lasers are especially handy for aligning antennas
that are more than 1 mile away.The downside to using these lasers how-
ever, is in direct sun they are very difﬁcult to see.They work much better
during overcast or cloudy days and obviously very well at night.
■
Global Positioning System (GPS) Another “nice to have” item is a
GPS device.Although you can use the odometer in your car to get fairly
accurate distances between antennas in a point-to-point survey, a GPS
will give extremely accurate readings as well as altitude.A GPS can also
aid you in determining vehicle speeds in a highly mobile wireless instal-
lation and survey.
■
Spectrum analyzer A spectrum analyzer as used in a wireless site
survey is a device that allows you to monitor a speciﬁc portion of the
radio frequency spectrum to determine what interference, if any, is pre-
sent in the band of frequencies you intend to use for your wireless
implementation.
Though considered by some to be a necessary component in a wire-
less site survey, I consider the spectrum analyzer as a component to use if
you suspect interference from other sources, such as neighboring facilities.
Spectrum analyzers are very expensive and can range in price from
$5,000 to over $30,000.This a lot of money to invest for a one-time
survey; you can rent them instead from many companies. If I feel a spec-
trum analysis is warranted for a particular survey, I will rent the equip-
ment as necessary.
Bringing Temporary Mounting 
Equipment for the Survey
Your APs and/or bridges will need to be temporarily mounted in the survey
area(s). Because you will move them frequently, you should take care to mount
them as securely as possible without damaging the site.You may not be installing
an AP or bridge in the location you are surveying, so you do not want to unnec-
essarily damage a drop ceiling or I-beam by drilling holes in them.To this end,
you will need a variety of tools and equipment to “soft” mount the APs.
www.syngress.com

Wireless Network Design • Chapter 4

If you are a wireless consultant or engineer, carrying both AP and bridge
mounts in your survey kit is advisable to allow you to get the best ideas, during
you survey, for installation mounting of these devices.You should also carry
antenna mounts, for this same reason.
Both wireless consultants and one-time surveyors should also have in their
survey kits various alternative mounting solutions for equipment.You must again
be creative. Beam clamps, C-clamps, bar clamps, tie wraps, and Velcro are
common components in a good site survey kit.
During a wireless site survey, there is no bad mounting technique with the
exception of a mounting technique that does not properly secure the AP/bridge,
battery pack, and antenna. For safety and prudence, you should deﬁnitely double-
or triple-check the temporary mounting of all your equipment during the survey.
This protects your equipment from possible damage, but also eliminates the risk
of injury to you or others from falling APs and antennas.As an added incentive,
failure to ensure secure mounting of equipment, at a minimum, can result in a
loss of conﬁdence in you (the wireless professional), as your customer or peers
watch your expensive equipment shatter to pieces, after dropping 30 feet to the
ﬂoor of the facility.The following pieces of equipment will be essential for safely
mounting your equipment:
■
Tools and miscellaneous equipment A good socket set and driver
and bit set are invaluable for your site survey kit.These are used for
another piece of equipment I recommend: U-bolts. I use these to attach
to antennas to aid in the temporary mounting that is required for the
site survey. I have various U-bolt sizes ranging from one and one-half
inches to six inches to accommodate various antennas.Another good
tool for mounting antennas is a modiﬁed camera tripod for mounting
exterior antennas on roofs for exterior surveys.
■
Velcro Velcro is a good choice for strapping an AP to a beam or post as
long as the only weight the Velcro must bear is the radio device itself. I
typically use this for APs and antennas that do not have low-loss cable
connected to them.The cabling can add substantial weight to an AP or
antenna hanging from an I-beam 30 feet in the air.Velcro is typically not
strong enough to hold the additional weight.Also, replace your Velcro
regularly, because it tends to “wear out” over time and heavy usage.
■
Tape and other adhesive-based products I typically try to avoid
adhesive products of any sort when soft mounting equipment. It is fre-
quently difﬁcult to remove the adhesive “leftovers” when moving the
www.syngress.com

180
Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
equipment from place to place and solvents can remove paint and other
ﬁnishes as well as the adhesive.The only adhesive I carry is a removable
adhesive putty-like substance.This reusable adhesive has many brand
names, but it is usually blue or green in color. It is typically used to
attach pictures or posters to walls without damaging the wall ﬁnish. I use
only this removable adhesive to attach my location markers during site
surveys.This type of adhesive product does not leave glue residue when
removing the markers.
■
Tie wraps Tie wraps are a good, strong alternative to Velcro for soft
mounting your survey equipment.The only downside to tie wrap use is
that you normally must cut the tie wraps to free your equipment.This is
not too much of an obstacle because they are relatively inexpensive,
especially in bulk if you plan to perform many surveys.
■
Clamps My personal choice for soft mounting APs, bridges, and
antenna are clamps.They are easy to use and reuse, do not wear out
easily, and can be low cost. If you plan to perform surveys in many dif-
ferent environments, you will need a range of sizes to accommodate
whatever type mounting structure you may encounter. Beam clamps and
C-clamps are the most inexpensive, but they typically require both hands
to manipulate when mounting your equipment. I prefer the grip action
bar clamps that have become increasingly popular.You can generally
hold your AP or antenna in one hand and secure the clamp around
them using the other hand. Grip action bar clamps are very quick to
install and remove, fasten securely to even the most difﬁcult structures,
and because they usually have foam rubber grips on them, they do not
damage anything.
Performing an Interior Wireless Site Survey
There are speciﬁc methodologies for performing wireless site surveys, and these
methodologies differ depending on the type of survey you need to perform.
There are two main styles of surveys: the interior site survey, sometimes referred
to as an in-building survey, and the exterior or point-to-point /point-to-multi-
point survey.
You should complete certain steps regardless of the type of site survey you are
going to perform.You will want make sure your equipment is operational and
preconﬁgured prior to arriving at the site.You should ensure that your battery
www.syngress.com

packs and laptop batteries are all fully charged. If your customer is providing a
man-lift (from the pre-site survey questionnaire), call to be sure it is already on
site, available, and can reach the ceiling of the area you are about to survey.
The interior site survey requires you to understand cellular architecture,
roaming, and rate shifting.The following sections ﬁrst explain these interior site
survey components and conclude with the actual interior survey method.
Designing for Coverage
Each AP and antenna combination produces a single area of coverage. Each of
these single areas is referred to as a cell. Multiple overlapping cells are used to
provide wireless coverage for areas larger than a single cell alone can produce.
This is cellular architecture.
DSSS wireless LANs have 11 total channels that can be used for RF transmis-
sion. Each channel is 22 MHz wide, and all channels combined equal the entire
spectrum that can be used for 802.11b wireless LANs.When designing wireless
LANs multiple channels become an issue only when overlapping coverage (mul-
tiple cells) is required, and this is usually the case in most designs.
When two APs have overlapping coverage (they have a cellular architecture),
each AP must use a different channel so that the client can distinguish the differ-
ence the between the RF for each AP.The only three channels that do not
overlap concurrently are channels 1, 6, and 11.
Rate requirements also factor into the cellular architecture of a wireless cov-
erage area because the distance from an AP affects the data rate.The data rate
decreases as the coverage area increases until of course, you have no coverage at all.
Depending on the coverage rate required for a given area, you may need
more or less APs to fulﬁll the coverage requirements.As you can see in Figure
4.11, it will require many more APs conﬁgured at the 11 Mbps rate to cover a
speciﬁc area than to cover the same area with APs conﬁgured at the 2 Mbps rate.
Bandwidth is sacriﬁced for distance.
You can extend the coverage for a client by using an AP in repeater mode to
extend the coverage of an existing AP.The repeater AP does not have a wired
connection the network, instead, the client associates to the wired, root AP
through the AP acting as a repeater.This solution can provide additional coverage
when the wiring infrastructure is not available for another AP.There are limita-
tions to the use of repeaters to extend coverage.You cannot continuously add APs
in repeater mode to gain extremely long coverage areas. Repeater cells need 50
percent overlap with a wired AP cell. Each repeater loses approximately half its
normal coverage distance as they are added farther away from the wired root AP.
www.syngress.com

182
Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
For example, you may have about 200 feet of 11 Mbps coverage from a wired,
root AP.You add one repeater, and you gain an additional 100 feet of 11 Mbps
coverage.The next repeater you add will give you approximately 50 feet of addi-
tional coverage and so on. Eventually, adding an AP in repeater mode will give
you only nominal additional coverage at 11 Mbps.
Generally within buildings, the availability of Ethernet connections is fairly
predominant. Repeaters are typically used to extend APs from the building edge
to the surrounding outdoor portions or additional rooms of a building as a tem-
porary measure.As an example, the owner of a retail store may use APs in
repeater mode to extended coverage into the parking lot of their facility during
an outdoor tent sale.

Designing Seamless Roaming
When a client travels throughout a wireless cell (one AP coverage area), this is
called roaming.The smooth transition from one wireless cell to another (one AP
coverage area to another) is called seamless roaming.A large factor when designing
a wireless system is determining whether clients require seamless roaming.All
devices that require seamless roaming must be turned on when moving from
location to location. Seamless roaming is not required for devices that are turned
off before being moved. Several factors are involved when designing and sur-
veying for a wireless LAN that requires seamless roaming.You must ensure over-
lapping coverage for the entire roaming path, you must maintain a consistent
client IP address, and you must stay on the same subnetwork.
If a client is going to travel between more than one AP, coverage must exist
for the entire path.The IP address must be consistent within the coverage area
because the client will acquire its IP address at its starting point and use that
address throughout the path. If the IP subnet for each AP is located on separate
switches, and the switch is a Layer 3 switch or is separated from the other switch
by Layer 3 devices, such as a router, you should consider using switch trunking,
such as Inter-Switch Link (ISL) or 802.1Q to span the VLANs to ensure that a
single broadcast domain is used for all APs.
As we have discussed previously, multipath distortion can be a problem in RF.
The transmission between a client and an AP travels on radio frequency.Those
signals interact with the surrounding environment and can be deﬂected while in
transit to the AP. Under optimal conditions, the RF signals arrive at their destina-
tion in the same order in which they were sent.There is a good possibility that
some of the RF signals will reﬂect off surrounding objects and arrive out of
phase at the antenna, which causes the signals to cancel each other out and result
in inoperability.This scenario is very similar to TCP packets arriving out of order
within a wired LAN infrastructure.
If the RF between the two devices is strong, it can sometimes give the mis-
perception of good connectivity. Even if the signal strength is good, the signal
quality might be poor, thus causing trafﬁc performance to suffer. By adding a
second antenna to the AP, you can increase the area in which signals are received
and thus minimize, if not eliminate, the “dead path” and increase the signal
quality and performance. Using antennas in this way, with APs, is called antenna
diversity.The AP chooses the best antenna and uses that antenna to receive signals.
Only one antenna at a time is active; the active one is selected on a per-client
basis for the optimal signal. It applies only to a speciﬁc client.The AP can jump
back and forth between the antennas when talking to different clients.
www.syngress.com

184
Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
Cisco wireless network cards (client interfaces) can also use antenna diversity
because they have a diversiﬁed antenna built in to them or have diversiﬁed
antennas available externally.Whether using an AP or a client card, you can turn off
the diversity through the conﬁguration menu of both devices.Antenna diversity is
used to overcome multipath issues, not to increase the coverage area of an AP.
When conﬁguring APs for cellular coverage, the amount of overlap required
to allow a mobile client to seamlessly roam throughout the coverage area is
approximately 15 percent.The amount of this overlap depends upon how mobile
the users will be. In a highly mobile environment, the amount of overlap required
to allow the users to seamlessly roam may be higher than would normally be
required.Your site survey will allow you to determine how much overlap will be
necessary in your environment. Be sure to test this roaming capability in your
environment and especially in highly mobile user environments by performing
the roaming yourself as closely as possible to the actual use the wireless system
will see when in production.
Considering Rate Shifting
Rate shifting refers to the capability of the wireless client to negotiate the data rate
at which it sends and receives at any given distance from the AP.This is also
referred to as auto rate negotiation.As an example, a client negotiates the best speed
of 11 Mbps while in close proximity to an AP.As the client moves away from the
AP and the distance increases, the speed (rate) is renegotiated to allow for the
best possible signal quality.These rates shift down from 11 Mbps to 5.5 Mbps to
2 Mbps to ﬁnally 1 Mbps if the AP is conﬁgured to allow this rate shifting func-
tion. Cisco APs give you the ability to specify the rates that they will “shift to.”
For example, you may conﬁgure your AP to only allow rate shifting from 11
Mbps to 5.5 Mbps.This will have the effect that a client roaming away from an
AP will renegotiate its speed to 5.5 Mbps from 11 Mbps, but will lose its associa-
tion (and therefore connectivity) to the AP if they roam out of range of the 5.5
Mbps coverage instead of shifting down to 2 Mbps.
Performing the Interior Survey
In your interior wireless site survey, you will need to determine the coverage area
produced by the AP/antenna combination you chose in your rough design and
intend to use in your implementation.This is done by temporarily installing your
AP and antenna, then using your Cisco Aironet Client Utility (ACU) application
installed on a laptop computer with a wireless network card to verify the signal
www.syngress.com

185
rate (11, 5.5, 2, or 1 Mbps) in the area. If your customer has speciﬁed that they
require 11 Mbps coverage throughout the coverage area, you move your laptop
to the point where the 11 Mbps rate drops to 5.5 Mbps.This point where the
rate drops is the outer edge of your 11 Mbps coverage area and should be anno-
tated on a scaled drawing of the room or area.The scaled drawing of the room or
area may have been provided by your customer, or if it has not been provided,
you will need to draw this coverage on your graph paper in your site survey kit.
Typically, you will start by placing your AP/antenna combination in the corner of
the room or area (see Figure 4.12,A) and survey the coverage of that AP, making
a note of where the furthest point of coverage is from that AP.You will then
move the AP/antenna combination to the annotated point and survey the cov-
erage again. If you were to leave your AP in the corner for an implementation,
you would waste as much as 75 percent of your coverage cell radiating an area
outside the building or an area on the other side of a wall that does not require
coverage.You may need to move the AP several times in order to ﬁnd the best
placement and coverage pattern.
Once you have established this ﬁrst coverage cell, move to another corner of
the facility (see Figure 4.12, B) and repeat the process until you have surveyed the
entire area (see Figure 4.12, C and D). In larger facilities, you may need to repeat
these steps from the entire perimeter and/or center of the facility in order to ﬁll
in “gaps” in the coverage area.You must overlap your coverage cells in order to
have seamless roaming in the area.

Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
Once you have determined the best coverage for the entire area, it will be
extremely important for you to both annotate the AP and antenna placement on
your drawing and place markers from your site survey kit at these locations. Be
sure to photograph the area (with the markers in place) with your digital camera
before proceeding to a new survey area.
In addition to the locations, you should take into account that only three
non-overlapping channels are available and annotate the channel your AP is using
in each cell of coverage. Be sure to change the channel to the channel you intend
to use during the installation for each cell. For example, cell A in your rough
design may be using channel 1. In the same room, cell B is supposed to use
channel 6. Be sure to change your survey AP’s channel to 6 before surveying cell
B.This is done to ensure the accuracy of your site survey. It would be embar-
rassing to install the second AP only to discover that channel 6 has severe inter-
ference on it, drastically reducing the 11 Mbps coverage area for cell B, when you
could have identiﬁed and corrected this prior to installation had you not sur-
veyed the entire area on channel 1.
During your survey, you may discover that you have too much overlap in some
of your coverage cells. One or more APs may be providing too much coverage in
an area, but without them, there is too little coverage.At this point you have a few
choices.You can add more APs and use smaller antennas (lower dBi rated antennas),
or you may elect to use the same number of APs, but increase the coverage by
using larger antennas. Still another option is to change the power levels on one or
more APs, thus changing the size of the coverage cells.You may have to use some
combination of these options to properly achieve your coverage goals.
Using the Cisco Aironet Client 
Utility for Interior Site Surveys
You may ask yourself, how will I determine the point at which my coverage ends
during the survey? How can I tell if my signal strength and quality are acceptable
in a given area? What speed am I currently using? Cisco has conveniently pro-
vided you with the tool you will need to answer these questions.The tool is
called the Aironet Client Utility (ACU), which allows you to measure signal
quality, signal strength, rates, lost packets, and more.This section covers the use of
the ACU in terms of your interior site survey.You can also ﬁnd more informa-
tion on the ACU in Chapter 8.
Within the ACU are several screens giving you the ability to conﬁgure your
wireless client for power modes, SSID, and other parameters.Among these screens
www.syngress.com

187
is the site survey screen.You can use the site survey screen (see Figure 4.13) to
help determine the best placement or coverage (overlap) for your APs.The cur-
rent RF status is read from your Cisco wireless network card four times per
second to provide you with a gauge of the signal strength, beacons, overall link
quality, and the current AP association.The site survey screen also displays the IP
address of the associated AP, the name of the AP, and the frequency channel the
client is using to communicate with the AP. In addition, trends over time, in
graphic representations on the site survey screen indicate signal strength, beacons
received, and link speed (rate).
The site survey tool operates in two distinct modes: passive (the default) and
active.The passive mode does not initiate any RF network trafﬁc, it merely listens
to any RF network trafﬁc that the Cisco wireless network card hears.The active
mode (see Figure 4.14) will actively send and/or receive packets to or from the
associated AP, and update the Percent Complete, Percent Successful, Lost To
Target, Lost To Source, and Percent Retries accordingly.
Lost To Target indicates the number of packets that were not received by the
other device. Lost To Source indicates the number of packets that were lost on
the way back to your wireless network card. Packets may be lost due to interfer-
ence from other devices producing RF, because you are on the edge of the radio
reception range, or due to multipath distortion.

To set up the Active Mode, click Setup at the bottom of the page.To start
the Active Mode, click Start.To stop the Active Mode and return to Passive
Mode, click Stop (the Start button changes to the Stop button while the Active
Mode test is running). Otherwise,Active Mode will change back to Passive Mode
once the Percent Complete has reached 100 percent.
Overall Link Quality is an indication of the ability of the Cisco wireless net-
work card to successfully communicate with an AP. Ratings are Excellent, Good,
Fair, and Poor. It is derived from the current signal strength and current signal
quality.A result of Excellent indicates that both values are greater than 75 per-
cent; Good indicates that both values are greater than 40 percent, but one (or
both) is less than 75 percent; Fair indicates that both values are greater than 20
percent, but one (or both) is less than 40 percent; and ﬁnally, Poor indicates that
one or both values is less than 20 percent.When I perform a site survey, I have
found my overall link quality should be Good or Excellent for the implementa-
tion—anything less is unacceptable.
You also have the option to display the Signal Strength in dBm, the Signal
Quality as Noise Level (in dBm), and the Overall Link Quality as the Signal to
Noise Ratio.You can do this from the Preferences menu.

Figure 4.14 Active Mode Site Survey ACU Screen

The Active Mode Site Survey Setup page (see Figure 4.15) allows you to set
the parameters for the active mode.You can change the following parameters:
■
Destination MAC Address This parameter allows you to select the
AP, by MAC address, with which you will perform the active mode test.
The default MAC address is the address of the AP that you are currently
associated to via your wireless network card.The active mode test will
not roam to other APs, allowing you to determine the size of a single
cell.You should make sure the address in this ﬁeld is the AP you are cur-
rently using at that moment in your survey and not another survey AP
that just happens to be on in the area.
■
Number of Packets Sets the quantity of packets that will be sent.
■
Continuous Link Test Causes the active mode test to run repeatedly
until you click OK or Stop on the Site Survey page. (The test will loop
repeatedly for the number of packets that you speciﬁed).You should
choose to perform this test at least once per area you survey to provide
you with continuous feedback of your RF link as you survey. It will give
you information on expected loss over a period of time at any given
survey point.

■
Packet Size Sets the size of the packet to be sent.The packet size
should be set to the packet size that can be expected to traverse this
wireless segment when it is in production.
■
Data Retries The number of times to retry a transmission if an ACK is
not received from the destination.
■
Data Rates Sets the bit rate at which the packet will be transmitted.
No rate shifting will be performed.
■
Delay Between Packets Sets the delay (in milliseconds) between suc-
cessive transmissions.
■
Packet Tx Type Unicast—expects an ACK back from the destination
and retries can occur. Multicast—No packet retries.
■
Packet Success Threshold The percentage of packets that are not lost.
This parameter controls the red line on the “Percent Successful” his-
togram. Percentages greater than or equal to this value will show up as
green bars; percentages below this value will show up as yellow bars on
the Percent Successful histogram.
Watching Your Power Consumption
When using wireless network cards, power consumption while surveying
(roaming) is going to be an issue because devices within the laptop will use
power, and the laptop battery has a limited life.Three modes for power are avail-
able on Cisco wireless network cards:
■
CAM—Constant Awake Mode CAM is best for devices when power
is not an issue.This would be when AC power is available to the device,
and it provides the best connectivity option, and therefore, the most
available wireless infrastructure from the client perspective.
■
PSP—Power Save Mode Select PSP when power conservation is of
the utmost importance. In this mode, the wireless network card will go
to sleep after a period of inactivity and periodically wake to retrieve
buffered data from the AP.
■
FastPSP—Fast Power Save Mode FastPSP is a combination of CAM
and PSP.This is good for clients who switch between AC and DC power.
I typically choose to use FastPSP in my site surveys because I am usually able
to plug my laptop into AC power for short periods of time during the survey.

Setting Your Service Set IDs
Service set IDs (SSIDs) are required for clients to communicate to APs.You can
deﬁne three possible SSIDs on the client, although you can conﬁgure only one
on the AP.The most common conﬁguration within a corporation has the SSIDs
the same for all APs. SSIDs act as a password, allowing the client to gain access
into the infrastructure through the APs.The default SSID for the Cisco products
is “tsunami”; it is preconﬁgured in the shipping product. By default, the AP is
conﬁgured for “Allow Broadcast SSID to Associate = YES,” this means that clients
do not have to have an SSID conﬁgured to associate to the AP.The recom-
mended setting for SSIDs while surveying is to have the AP conﬁgured to “Allow
Broadcast SSID to Associate = NO”. If the AP and client SSIDs do not match,
the association between the two will not happen, and access will not be granted.
This will force you to conﬁgure your client with the matching SSID, but will
give you a more accurate survey because most organizations require SSIDs in
their wireless systems.
You can ﬁnd more information on SSIDs, power modes, and how to con-
ﬁgure them on your wireless client in Chapter 7.
Interior Survey Problems
Wireless site surveys are a process of trial and error. Experience is the best way to
overcome many of these problems, but this may not be possible for the one-time
surveyor. Most, if not all, problems encountered during your site survey are a result
of unexpected design, business, or environmental issues.You may ﬁnd yourself
trying option after option to force a solution to a problem.This is where frustra-
tion sets in.You may ﬁnd yourself working on a single thought process over and
over because you don’t want to start the survey over again. If you ﬁnd yourself in
this situation, take a break. Get a cup of coffee, go to lunch, just get away from the
problem for a bit and more times than not you will ﬁnd the solution to the
problem presents itself upon your return. If it does not, you really may need to
wipe the slate clean and start your survey over. By starting over, you will be aware
of the trouble spots in your survey and will be able to factor this knowledge in
when planning the layout of your APs again. Starting the survey over again and
designing the wireless LAN properly is always better than trying to force or use a
solution that may not provide the best coverage and performance.
Sometimes, the location of your APs may be dictated by available network con-
nectivity. For example, copper Ethernet cabling has a length limit of 328 feet. No
matter what the problem you encounter, there is almost always a way around it.

Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
Your customer may restrict antenna and AP placement to one or two walls of
a facility, as in the Andromeda Manufacturing design.We were able to work
around this problem and survey the area successfully by using directional antennas
to “shoot” coverage down the aisles of the warehouse.
Some business may want coverage in a large walk-in freezer in their facility.
Of course they didn’t tell you this until you came out to perform your site
survey. How will you handle this issue? The freezer is much too cold for the AP
to be placed in it without expensive heated enclosures. Is this the only solution
to the problem? You could mount the AP outside the freezer and install the
antenna (which can withstand the cold) inside to provide the coverage required.
You could even use antenna splitters to provide coverage both inside and outside
the freezer for an even more cost-efﬁcient solution to coverage.The only caveat
for your antennas is to not use both antenna connections on your Cisco AP to
provide this coverage (see Figure 4.16). Remember, when using antenna diversity
the AP uses one antenna or the other, never both.
Take caution when surveying multiﬂoor facilities because APs on different
ﬂoors can cause as much interference as if they were located on the same ﬂoor.
You can possibly use this bleed-through to your advantage in your design. During
your site survey, you may be able to penetrate ﬂoors and ceilings with a single AP
to provide coverage for ﬂoors above and below you by using a larger antenna.

Performing an Exterior Wireless Site Survey
Exterior site surveys are very different from the interior surveys.This type of
survey requires drastically fewer physical survey procedures but much more
thought and analysis than interior surveys. Much of this has to do with the nature
of point-to-point implementations. Unlike the interior site survey, exterior site
surveys are performed without the use of the ACU.This is because clients will
not directly associate with the bridges as they do with APs.The bridges simply
link two or more wired LANs together to provide connectivity. However, speciﬁc
steps and tools allow you to perform your survey.
Because you are usually attempting to transmit a signal over some distance,
signal attenuation (loss) is of signiﬁcant importance during your survey. Every
component used in an exterior survey produces some loss. Cabling, connectors,
splitters, the environment, and weather all affect the distance you may achieve
during your site survey.When performing this type of survey, signal attenuation
(loss) in your survey is of the highest importance, because the signal is not spread
around as in interior wireless implementations and therefore is not as forgiving of
interference and multipath issues.
Point-to-point and point-to-multipoint wireless implementations use bridges
rather than APs to achieve wireless connectivity.These bridges are designed to
interconnect two or more wired LANs, using narrow RF transmissions or beams
over distances up to 25 miles.As with the APs, the bridges will require a wired
connection to the network and either conventional power (340 Series) or inline
power fed directly through the RJ-45 interface on the bridge (350 Series).
The steps for performing this type of site survey consists of the following:
■
Link distance determination You will need to determine the dis-
tance of each site to be connected.This is the distance from a transmit-
ting antenna to a receiving antenna. If these distances are long, you may
wish to use the odometer in your car or a GPS to calculate this.You
may already have gathered this information to create your rough design.
■
Fresnel zone calculation The next and most complicated step in the
survey process, is to determine the radio line of sight for the wireless
link.This is done by calculating the wireless link’s Fresnel zone and pos-
sibly taking into account the curvature of the Earth (depending on link
distances). If you already have your link distances and building or tower
heights for your antennas, you can perform this step prior to arriving for
the site survey.

Calculating the Fresnel Zone
A bit of mathematics is required to calculate the size of the Fresnel zone
radius at its widest point (midpoint radius). The following formula (see
Figure 4.17) will allow you to calculate the radius in feet of the widest
point in your Fresnel zone:
where
d1 = the distance from the transmitting antenna (to the midpoint
in the path)
d2 = the distance from the receiving antenna (to the midpoint in
the path)
F = the frequency in gigahertz (GHz)
R = the radius of the ﬁrst Fresnel zone (at the midpoint)
For d1 and d2, it is usually much easier to determine the entire path
length and divide that by 2 to get the distance for d1 and d2. So a 7-
mile path length would have d1 and d2 values of 3.5 each.
Also you can replace the 72.1 parameter with 43.3 (60 percent of
72.1) to give you your 60 percent clearance factor right off the bat,
without having to calculate this later. Here is how I calculate my Fresnel
zone. I have a total path distance of 7 miles. I divide my 7 miles by 2 to
get my d1 and d2 values. In this case, it is 3.5. Multiplying 3.5 times 3.5
gives me 12.25. I then take my total path distance in miles (7) times 2.4
(my frequency in GHz) to produce a value of 16.8. I now divide 12.25 by
16.8 to get a value of .729. The square root of .729 is .854. I now mul-
tiply .854 times 72.1 to result in my midpoint Fresnel zone radius of
61.57 feet. I need 60 percent of this radius for a good link path, so I take
my radius value (61.57) times 0.6 to get my antenna height for this link,
which is approximately 36 feet.
Once you have calculated the Fresnel zone’s largest radius point,
you must then determine what obstructions, if any, obstruct the ellipse
more than 40 percent into the Fresnel zone (see Figure 4.18). If you have

Link Setup and Testing Once you have completed the previous tasks,
you will set up your wireless link based on your rough design.This will
entail determining antenna alignment, identifying cable lengths required,
power requirements, wired connectivity for the bridge unit, and available
infrastructure hardware (such as a switch for the wired connectivity to
the network).The testing portion encompasses veriﬁcation of connec-
tivity and determination of optimal performance factors such as signal
quality and strength and packet loss.You will use the tools built in to
your Cisco bridge to acquire this information.We cover more on these
bridge tools and conﬁgurations for point-to-point and point-to-multi-
point wireless implementations in detail in Chapter 6.
■
Link Impairment Identiﬁcation and Consideration You will need
to identify and consider all the design obstacles we covered earlier in 
the chapter (see the “Wireless Planning Considerations” section), with
www.syngress.com
more than this percentage of path interference, you will experience
transmission loss. Remember that the Fresnel zone should be clear of
obstructions all year round. Many a surveyor has been tripped up by
trees in their Fresnel zone. When surveyed in the fall or winter, the trees
did not have any leaves and therefore did not cause much, if any, inter-
ference with the signal. Summer arrives and they have to return to cor-
rect the antenna height because the leaves in the trees in the Fresnel
zone were so thick they caused noticeable interference. You should also
consider a tree that may be very close to 40 percent of your zone,
because it will grow and eventually hit this mark.

but the tree top encroaches more

special attention paid to possible link impairments and taller-than-esti-
mated trees, new building construction that may be in the path, and
potential reﬂection points (such as ﬂat, paved roads, pools, or other
bodies of water).These considerations, if any, will then need to be cor-
rected, and the solutions worked into your ﬁnal design.
Wireless Design Examples
The following examples of both interior and exterior wireless designs will help
guide you through some of the more common wireless implementations.
Warehouse Design Example 1
The example in Figure 4.19 shows a design for a warehouse in which wireless
coverage is the maximum concern for the customer.Automatic rate negotiation
www.syngress.com
Calculating Antenna Height
Calculating antenna height simply requires you to determine the Fresnel
zone radius and plan your implementation height so that your zone
clears any obstructions by no less than 60 percent. When planning for
paths longer than seven miles, the curvature of the Earth might become
a factor in path planning and require that the antenna be located higher
off the ground. To calculate the additional height due to curvature of the
Earth, use the following formula:
H=D2/8
where
H = Additional height of the antenna (in feet)
D = Distance between antennas (in miles)
For example, we have already calculated our midpoint Fresnel zone
and antenna height to be about 36 feet (for our 7-mile path). Now
because we are 7 miles apart, we must consider the additional height
required to compensate for the curvature of the Earth. By using the pre-
vious formula, we are able to determine that we will require approxi-
mately 6 additional feet to the antenna height to bring our total height
requirement to approximately 42 feet.

will be used because coverage is the primary concern and cabling is available to
all points in the store.The warehouse has a very high ceiling and the visibility of
antennas to the customers is not of concern; therefore, we chose a high-gain,
mast-mount antenna for the maximum coverage.
Warehouse Design Example 2
Here in Figure 4.20 is the same warehouse as described in the previous section,
but instead of using the high-gain, omni-directional antenna, we used the patch
antennas and one rubber dipole to provide coverage for the facility.With this
design, we were able to get identical coverage using different types of antennas
but with two less APs.

Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
One possible reason to use the patch antennas could be that cabling for wired
Ethernet is not available in the middle of the warehouse and is available only
around the edges of the facility.Therefore, the patch antennas in the warehouse
would increase coverage from the perimeter.
Warehouse Design Example 3
Figure 4.21 depicts the same warehouse except in this situation Ethernet wiring
is available only in the front of the warehouse. Racking extends all of the way to
the ceiling and runs with the aisles extending the length of the building. In addi-
tion to the changes in racking, the data closet is located near the right side of the
building.
Because the forklifts will need to extend very close to the ceiling height and
because the racking extends from ﬂoor to ceiling making it difﬁcult for the RF
coverage to leak through the racks, different antennas must be deployed.
We’ve decided to use the Yagi antenna with a small beam but long distance at
the front and a couple of dipole antennas to complete the storefront coverage.
Retail Design Example
Retail implementations often involve a large number of users sending data very
frequently. Stores are likely to do their inventorying at night.This can mean that
there will be a limited number of users during the normal store hours, which
does not tax the WLAN.

But when the inventory crew comes in at night, the customer expects that the
WLAN will be able to handle the demand.You need to work with the store man-
ager to determine how often they do inventory, how many data collection devices
will be used, and what the requirements are for their particular application.
Also ask if they will require coverage on the loading docks or inside the trucks
at the loading docks. Depending on the WLAN design, enough RF coverage may
be bleeding through to the outside of the buildings to accommodate this, but you
should not depend upon this unless you have factored it into your design.
Other concerns within the retail industry include the close proximity of the
store to other RF devices. Some stores may stock and demo RF devices in their
store.These may include satellite systems, baby monitors, or cordless phones.
Many of these may be 900 MHz, but some may also be 2.4GHz. In any case, you
shouldn’t install APs next to this type of equipment.Typically these devices have a
higher output than the APs.Also be aware that many stores use internal cordless
phone systems. Encourage them to use a system that operates on a different fre-
quency (900 MHz). It is far less expensive to replace a few cordless phones than
to try and design a WLAN around an existing phone system that interferes.
Retail stores may also be located in malls or strip malls where there may be
other users operating 2.4 GHz equipment. Examine this possibility before starting
the site survey.Talk with surrounding store managers about their systems. If other
systems are in the area, you will have to try and separate the stores by channel,
SSID, and so on.
The design shown in Figure 4.22 represents a retail store in which the cus-
tomer is concerned with maximum coverage at 2 Mbps because of third-party
interoperability with bar coding products that do not support auto negotiation.
Cabling is available throughout the store, but one concern is to make sure that
the antennas are well hidden from the browsing shoppers. For this reason, a
ground plane antenna is chosen so that it can be ﬂatly mounted on a drop-down
ceiling permitting the antenna to blend in and not be easily seen.
Education Design Example 1
The design shown in Figure 4.23 is for an educational environment that is very
similar to our warehouse environment with the exception of the walls between
the classrooms.We are able to provide enough coverage using the rubber dipole
antennas attached to the APs.The school is concerned that the students using the
APs could gain access to the production network, so the APs will be on a ﬁre-
wall. Connectivity for the teachers will be handled by Ethernet switches in the
wiring closets and Category 5 cable pulled into the classroom teaching stations.

Education Design Example 2
In education solutions, wireless is popular in higher education and colleges where
students require more mobile options. In the example shown in Figure 4.24,
we’ve chosen to locate the patch antennas directly outside the building, allowing
coverage in the courtyard for students who work outside.

Point-to-Point Design Example 1
The site-to-site design example shown in Figure 4.25 is for a point-to-point
connection where two buildings need to have a bridge link between them across
a freeway.The required distance is only half a mile, therefore the antennas need to
be mounted at 13 feet.This height will be exceeded because the buildings are
higher than that.
The cabling from the bridge to the antenna is 20 feet in building A and 50
feet in building B.This is not a signiﬁcant problem on the link because the dis-
tance is so short that it does not severely impact the design.
Patch antennas were chosen in this example because the beam is kept focused,
and there will be no interference from other companies. Distances at 11 Mbps in
this scenario allow you to go .81 miles; 2 Mbps rates allow you go 2.57 miles.
Point-to-Point Design Example 2
The design in Figure 4.26 shows a headquarters building within a metropolitan
area where three separate point-to-point links have been implemented. It is pos-
sible that the point-to-point links are required because of interference from other
companies using wireless LANs and point to multipoint is not an option. Each
building will receive greater bandwidth than used with point-to-multipoint

The design example shown in Figure 4.27 is in a rural area that requires a dis-

cable lengths are kept to a minimum to ensure the greatest possible distance.
This distance precludes the use of 11 Mbps, therefore, 2 Mbps will be used,
which is within the speciﬁcation.
Even though the possible distance of 2 Mbps is 50 miles, please be sure and
note that line-of-sight over 25 miles is difﬁcult to align.

Chapter 4 • Wireless Network Design
Summary
Your wireless design process has three stages or phases.They are the planning phase,
rough design phase, and wireless site survey. It is imperative that you carefully eval-
uate the requirements of your business, users, and applications in order to deter-
mine the feasibility of a wireless solution in your environment. Be sure to evaluate
the application trafﬁc that you may expect on the wireless LAN, the types of appli-
cations used and the number of users in a given cell. User expectations should be
set throughout your design and implementation processes to ensure the support
and success of your ﬁnal implementation. Establishing the expected performance of
your wireless LAN with your users will not only help you during implementation,
but also will ease support of your wireless LAN after the installation. Build a busi-
ness case for your proposed wireless implementation to include return on invest-
ment, productivity beneﬁts, and cost savings resulting from more efﬁcient processes.
A thorough wireless site survey and test of your initial wireless LAN design is
your best bet to ensure the success of your implementation.The site survey will
provide you with the information necessary to turn your initial design into a com-
pleted design that is ready for implementation. It will allow you to factor in previ-
ously unknown environmental variables, such as interference from other radio
frequency devices and obstructions, and it will allow you to verify coverage areas,
channel settings, throughput, antenna/radio placement, wired network availability,
and power requirements prior to a permanent installation.When performing your
wireless site survey, be sure to conﬁgure your radio devices (APs or bridges)
because they will be conﬁgured in the permanent installation.Try to use the same
radio devices and antennas that you plan to use in the permanent installation where
possible. Utilize a pre-site survey questionnaire to gather as much information as
possible about the intended wireless location.The more information you can gather
prior to your site survey, the better equipped you will be to perform it.
The right tools for the wireless site survey will make the process much more
efﬁcient. Be sure to include tools that will allow you to temporarily, but securely,
attach your APs and antennas. Include measuring tools for both vertical and hori-
zontal measurements and always bring along paper and pencil to take notes
during the survey.
A good understanding of attenuation and its common causes are an integral
part of your wireless LAN design and implementation.Take particular note of
metal obstructions, cordless phones, and microwave ovens for interior designs, and
weather, Earth curvature, and natural obstructions for exterior designs. Remember,
line of sight for exterior designs is not all that is needed for a point-to-point

implementation.The Fresnel zone, the elliptical path formed between two direc-
tional antennas, must be at least 60 percent clear of path obstructions to be consid-
ered for a point-to-point installation. Interior designs that require roaming, should
have at least a 30 percent overlap in the cells to allow for a smooth transition from
one coverage cell to another.
Every wireless LAN design and implementation will be different, based on
the requirements of the business, the geography, applications, obstacles, weather,
existing infrastructure and number of users.You should take this into account
when designing and site surveying. Do not assume anything.

Wireless Planning Considerations
 Ask yourself the questions necessary to determine if wireless is right for
your situation.
 Remember, throughput and data rate are not the same thing.You should
determine your company’s throughput requirements as a ﬁrst step in
planning your wireless solution.
 The difference between mobile and highly mobile users is of signiﬁcant
importance to your wireless design; be sure to identify this early in your
planning process.
Wireless Design Considerations
 An understanding of attenuation is extremely important in exterior
wireless implementations and surveys. Make sure that you understand
these considerations and keep them in mind when surveying.
 Make sure that you list all of the potential wireless issues you could face
when surveying. Multipath issues, construction materials, weather, and
application considerations should top your list.
 Make sure that your clients expectations are set by you, and be thorough
when asking questions to your organization’s representatives.

Wireless Site Surveys
 The pre-site survey questionnaire is an invaluable tool for preparing for
your site survey. Ensure you have most if not all of your questions
answered before you arrive on site to survey and call ahead of time to
ensure a smooth survey.
 The site survey kit will also serve you during installation, so make a
reasonable investment in the tools you will use.
 Always perform your survey with all hardware and conﬁgurations
settings as they will be in the potential implementation.This ensures “no
surprises” when it comes to actually installing your wireless system.
Q: Can I use an ampliﬁer to increase my power and distance?
A: Technically, you can achieve great distances with more power. However, in
the U.S., federal regulations prohibit you from using an ampliﬁer to increase
your signal unless it comes as part of a licensed package.
Q: Can I have ﬁve sites at 2 Mbps to a single 11 Mbps center site for better
throughput?
A: No, this will have the effect of limiting bandwidth to 2 Mbps for every client
who associates to any of the ﬁve APs.The bandwidth to the client cannot be
aggregated to achieve better throughput.
Q: Can I use a splitter and two antennas?
A: Yes, this will allow you to increase the reliability to receive and transmit data,
but it will not substantially increase the coverage area because your power
output will be split between antennas.

Chapter 5 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco 340 and Cisco 350 Series Access Points
Introduction
The installation and conﬁguration of the Cisco Aironet access points (APs) is rel-
atively simple for most administrators, however, there are some complexities that
arise as the installation becomes more complex or involves more APs. In addition,
the conﬁguration of the wireless “connections” between the APs and the clients is
a little more difﬁcult than following a simple 100-meter rule in wired Ethernet.
Interference from cordless phones, walls, partitions, microwaves and other hin-
drances can quickly complicate the wireless installation.
Aside from these differences, the general steps are very consistent with wired
installations. IP addresses, management, and documentation are all key to the suc-
cessful deployment of a wireless network.
Other challenges that may confront the designer of the wireless network
include security and management. Inclusive in this list is the need to control the
WEP keys should this security model be used—note that it is no longer recom-
mended because it may quickly be compromised, however, it is better than no
security at all. Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol/Extensible
Authentication Protocol (LEAP/EAP) management requires the use of a security
server running Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS), a pro-
tocol developed by Livingston Enterprises for transport of authentication and
conﬁguration information over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which
exchanges the keys to the receiver.This is still a WEP-based installation, but the
variance is that the key is no longer of unlimited duration. In WEP, the key is
stored in the network interface card (NIC), and loss of the NIC may require an
entire enterprise to change their WEP key. Please note that there are two WEP
standards—the 40-bit key speciﬁed in the Wi-Fi (802.11b) interoperability stan-
dard.This key length should interoperate with all vendors.The 128-bit key
length, which is only marginally more secure, is not always interoperable.
Note that although the Cisco APs can be conﬁgured as wireless bridges
between buildings, the more common installation is to service a small number of
mobile users in hotel, manufacturing ﬂoor, or ofﬁce-to-conference room
domains.This chapter, as such, focuses on the conﬁguration of the APs as they
relate to wireless 802.11b clients. It is noteworthy that the conﬁguration of the
APs as wireless bridges is quite simple once you gain a basic understanding of the
client conﬁguration process.Wireless NICs may also be conﬁgured for an ad hoc
conﬁguration.This setting is deﬁned under the Infrastructure Mode parameter.
Because this type of installation is also uncommon and very limited, it is only
mentioned in this chapter here.

Planning the Design of a Wireless 
Network for Today and Tomorrow
For some wireless network installations, the network administrator has
little to do other than place the AP on a desk and plug it in. A few con-
ﬁguration changes and a small ofﬁce can quickly communicate as if they
were all wired on a traditional LAN.
However, it is much more likely that your installations will have to
consider a number of factors because of its need to scale in the enter-
prise. These include the following:
■Upgrades to 802.11a
■Interference from 2.4 GHz cordless phones
■Antenna placement for range or appearance reasons
■The use of inline power in various installations
■Integration with SNMP and other management systems
■Frequency selection for capacity or interference reasons
■Security
■Secure Set Identiﬁer (SSID) management
■Wired Equivalent Protocol (WEP) management
■Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP)/EAP
management
■Integration with other vendors’ systems
This chapter covers the conﬁguration of the Aironet 340 and 350
series APs, including the Cisco 340 BSE, which is a ﬁxed-conﬁguration
Network Address Translation (NAT)-enabled AP. This section addresses
those elements that are not part of the main chapter.
One of the ﬁrst challenges in 802.11b is the limited bandwidth of
the system. With an effective data rate of approximately 6 Mbps
(depending on trafﬁc type, frame size, operating system, and other fac-
tors), it is clear to see that users could quickly perceive the shared model
of wireless networking as slow, especially if accustomed to 100 Mbps
switched Ethernet. The 802.11a speciﬁcation will increase throughput to
over 40 Mbps (the actual rate is 52 Mbps), however, the technology is

still shared between users. The design challenge is that 802.11a net-
works will likely have a much shorter range than their 802.11b counter-
parts due to the frequencies used by the two systems. As such,
placement and wiring of an 802.11b network with a single AP may lead
to an entire rewire of the wireless APs when migrating to 802.11a.
Designers would be better served by planning for an 802.11a installa-
tion and only installing 802.11b systems where required.
Interference from 2.4 GHz systems, including cordless phones, is
another challenge. Under 802.11a the frequency space is also free for
public use, so interference may remain a design concern. Today the 2.4
GHz range is becoming more popular, and conﬂicts with other systems
is a real issue. Again, companies may address this with bans on cordless
phones within their control, but this may not be sufﬁcient to prevent a
problem if another company nearby allows their use.
Many end-users may be concerned regarding the look of the
antennas for wireless networks, in addition to the potential health risks
that may be associated with them. For this reason, some companies may
implement guidelines to increase the distance between the closest user
and the antenna, and antenna selection may include directional systems
that radiate power in a single direction instead of in all directions.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in addition to the
European Telecommunications Standard and other groups, have estab-
lished minimum guidelines for the use of radio frequency equipment.
Cisco has taken these guidelines (presented in the form of FCC ET docket
96-8, ETS 300.328, and CEPT recommendation T/R 10.01) and docu-
mented the safe methods for working with radio frequency equipment,
including the Aironet products. These guidelines include never touching
the antenna during transmission or reception, always maintaining at
least eight inches between the body and the antenna, and not using the
antenna near the face or eyes. You can research this further on Cisco’s
Web site—as of this writing the URL was located at www.cisco.com/
univercd/cc/td/doc/product/wireless/airo_350/accsspts/ap350qs
.htm#xtocid271823.
Inline power can negate the need for running distinct power for
each AP. In ceiling installations, the ability to run power over the
Ethernet cabling is a huge advantage because the administrator does
not need to provide a second connection to supply power. Please note
that only the 350 series supports inline power, and that many of these
installations may use the rugged chassis option.
This chapter discusses this in greater detail; however, inline power
is rarely needed for non–large scale installations.

Installation of the 
Cisco 340/350 Series AP
The installation steps for the Cisco 340 and 350 systems are fairly straightforward
and include the following:
■
Determine the placement of the AP and select the antenna. Please refer
to the Cisco documentation for more information on this process and
the current options available.
■
Determination if inline power or plenum installation is needed for your
installation, noting that the 350 series provides for these needs.
■
Selection of the virtual LAN (VLAN) architecture for wireless networks,
as discussed later in this section.
■
Selection of IP addresses within that VLAN, including the assignment
methodology, including Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP).
■
Selection of the SSID values for your network.
■
Determine if WEP will be used and how you will manage the keys. Key
management is dependent on the use of RADIUS or static conﬁgura-
tion, discussed in this chapter.
■
The selection of using LEAP/EAP for WEP services, including the
installation and conﬁguration of a capable RADIUS server.
■
Selection of a channel for the AP. Note that in the U.S., there are only
three nonoverlapping channels that you may use, and you may need to
refer to the Cisco documentation for country-speciﬁc instruction.
■
Determination of the proper settings for management services, including
SNMP and Syslog.This will be speciﬁc to your network, but this section
presents how to conﬁgure the AP for interoperation.
■
Deciding how to integrate with virtual private networking (VPN) ser-
vices, including IPSec, to augment security.This is dependent on your
installation.
■
Deciding if access limitations on resources are warranted for your wireless
network.This may be via router access control lists (ACL) or VLAN ACLs
(VACLs).You may also choose to use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or other
security-conscious protocols.This is dependent on your installation.

(PSPF) to limit wireless device connectivity.This option is discussed in

Enterprise Installations of Wireless Networks
Many corporations have been slow to adopt wireless networking for two
very speciﬁc reasons. The ﬁrst is security, which is discussed elsewhere in
this chapter. The second is management. Quite simply, few wireless solu-
tions provide the level of network management integration that comes
with wired systems. Although this is changing quickly, the likelihood is
that network managers will need to manage wireless systems with a
degree of manual processes for both the AP and the user’s network
interface.
Unlike their wired counterparts, wireless networks require a minor
degree of configuration for correct operation. (Please note that
Windows XP and newer operating systems can change these conﬁgura-
tion requirements). In addition to a driver for proper operation, many
installations require the conﬁguration of the SSID at a minimum. This
parameter controls the domain of the AP when more than one AP exists
within the range of the receiver. An example of this would be two com-
panies, one on the fourth ﬂoor and on one the ﬁfth of a building, each
with its own wireless network. Because the natural behavior of a radio
network is to bond with the strongest signal, it is possible to have a
wireless NIC in company B attempt to speak with company A’s AP.
The SSID provides a simple mechanism for the administrator to con-
trol which APs bond with which NICs. It is easy to understand how early
users of wireless systems could mistake this with a security measure as
well. However, you will not make this error. SSIDs are transmitted in clear
text by the AP, and wireless network analyzers are widely available to
capture this information for misuse. In Windows XP, the operating
system includes this capability as well. The use of the SSID is recom-
mended; it can also control the installation of noncorporate APs, as

Speciﬁc Differences of the Cisco 350 Series AP
Using the Cisco 350 series APs has a few advantages. First, these devices can
operate at 100 millawatts (mW), which can greatly increase the range of 802.11b
compared to the Cisco 340’s 30 mW conﬁguration. Second, the Cisco 350 can
accept inline power, or powered Ethernet, which negates the need for a separate
power cord.The 350 is also available in a rugged chassis, which may be warranted
for your installation, including an in-plenum installation.
www.syngress.com
client adapters will be conﬁgured to associate with the SSID provided by
the corporation. It will not prevent a noncorporate AP from entering the
network, but it may prevent most users from bonding with an AP that
is within range but not on the wired network—an installation that could
be used to access the wireless workstations without needing physical
access to the corporate network
Installations are also challenged with the ﬁrst generation of key
management for the security model proposed with 802.11b. The Wired
Equivalent Protocol (WEP) is designed to provide a reasonable amount
of security for wireless users, however, in the protocol’s lifespan, secu-
rity experts have easily broken the encryption mechanism used. As such,
hackers can compromise a WEP installation in a fairly short amount of
time, yielding its security features relatively inadequate. Enterprises are
left with three options—use the protocol without augmentation; use
WEP in concert with SSL, VPN technology, or with LEAP/EAP; or abandon
WEP completely and use only alternatives in the wireless network. Many
installations already have WEP installed, which means that administra-
tors will need to integrate with existing systems. Of course, new instal-
lations may also have comparable issues where the administrator may
have limited alternatives to WEP, and, shortcomings aside, is left to use
the inadequate security afforded by WEP. Please note that LEAP/EAP
does not provide data encryption—they provide a mechanism for key
exchange and management. This can limit the duration when a com-
promised key can be used to decrypt data. A number of freeware tools
are available on the Internet for allowing non-expert users to be war-
drivers, or wireless LAN decoders. Simply put, if security is your concern,
do not rely on WEP, even with LEAP/EAP. The use of VPN IPSec or other
encryption protocols would be mandated.
Aside from this, the installation of a wireless network remains sim-
ilar to wired installations. However, you should always start small, as
opposed to removing all the Cat-5 in your campus, when introducing a
new technology such as a wireless LAN.

216
Chapter 5 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco 340 and Cisco 350 Series Access Points
In all other regards, the conﬁguration of the 340 and 350 is virtually identical.
Power Requirements
You can choose among three methods for powering the Cisco 350 Series APs—
the 340 platform cannot accept inline power, discussed later in this section.The
choice of which solution will work best for your particular installation will
depend largely on the budget and complexity of your speciﬁc circumstances, in
addition to the presence of legacy equipment or non-Cisco equipment.
By far the simplest installations will take advantage of the inline power
options, which are available on speciﬁc modules of the Catalyst series switches,
including the Catalyst 6000 (WS-X6248 with the WS-F6K-VPWR daughter
card), the 4006 (with the WS-X4148-RJ45V) and 3524-PWR-XL. Each of these
products supply power to the Cisco 350 series AP via the standard Ethernet
pins—1, 2, 3, and 6.The physical conﬁguration of this installation is shown in
Figure 5.1. Please note that this list of modules is not complete, and it is very
likely that Cisco will include this feature on new products, in addition to new
modules and line cards for existing products when possible.
For installations where only Ethernet cable is available to the AP, no electrical
wiring is present, and the existing hub or switch infrastructure does not support
inline power, users may select the WS-PWR-PANEL patch panel.This panel
connects in-between the switch or hub and the AP, and is better suited to instal-
lations that require a large number of powered Ethernet lines, such as IP tele-
phony.When a single link solution is required, administrators may opt for the
Cisco Aironet Power Injector.This is often used for in-the-ceiling installations.
The physical characteristics of the powered patch panel installation is shown in
Figure 5.2. Please note that all Ethernet powered solutions are limited to 300
feet, which should not present a problem for most installations within the 100-
meter rule for Ethernet.
Please refer to your local building codes for the speciﬁc requirements
regarding power distribution within your construction, including cable types, ﬁre

ratings, and other parameters.This is true for commonly referred to plenum 
installations in the raised ceiling, or for other enclosed areas, such as a raised ﬂoor.
Of course, the AP may also be connected to a standard wall outlet for power.
These installations use a “vampire,” or AC-to-DC converter transformer, and iso-
late the power channel from the data path. Figure 5.3 illustrates the connections
for this option; note that the Cisco 340 series is powered by this method only.
Vampires are also called power packs, or AC adapters.They are commonly black
boxes with prongs that enter the wall (AC power source) or a black box in the
middle of two connectors—the AC plug that enters the wall and the DC con-
nector (round, dual pole) that enters the electronic device.The term “vampire” is
common in the power industry as these devices draw power even when the host
device is powered off (note that they are warm to the touch), and they have two
“teeth”—the AC prongs.
Network Connectivity
Although conﬁguring a wireless network that never touches a traditional wired
network is entirely possible, the usability of such an installation is obviously lim-
ited.At a minimum, most users expect access to e-mail and other services, if not
complete connectivity to their servers and printers.
At the lower end, Cisco provides the Cisco 340 BSE/BSM APs, discussed
later in this chapter, for basic network connectivity to a dial-up line, DSL, or
cable Internet connections, or a small wired network.The more popular 340 and
350 APs provide much more usability for larger installations, including those most
commonly found in the enterprise.

Chapter 5 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco 340 and Cisco 350 Series Access Points
The Cisco APs support both 10 and 100 Mbps Ethernet connections, and the
installation should terminate on a switch port as opposed to an Ethernet hub.
This limits the collision domain to the wireless segment only and allows for
better control of Media Access Control (MAC) addresses and other security and
diagnostic options.
The only other challenge in network connectivity for wireless networks is
the selection of the IP addresses and broadcast domain—the three common
choices are as follows:
■
Place the AP on the current wired subnet This solution is quite
simple, and it allows for the quick placement of the AP on any port of
the switch.This solution has a few downsides, however. One is that no
easy methods exist for isolating a wireless connectivity problem from a
wired one—the installation appears quite transparent to the help desk
and other support staff until they ask for the user to identify the connec-
tivity option.Another issue is roaming within the wireless domain.
Frequently, until the installation of Windows 2000 and greater, changing
the IP address required a reboot or DHCP renewal. Placing multiple APs
within a building would potentially conﬂict with the address assigned to
the workstation.Also, some applications cannot change IP addresses
dynamically, yielding another challenge for the designer.
■
Create a second collision domain with a second subnet per AP
This solution is very good for single AP installations, but it may impact
scalability.The same challenges that existed in the ﬁrst solution remain—
the workstation will need to change IP addresses in any roaming conﬁg-
uration.
■
Place an overlay network or VLAN into the campus or building
that allows all APs to reside in one subnet This third option
addresses the problems mentioned in the ﬁrst two solutions, but it is not
without its own concerns. It eliminates the IP address swapping of the
ﬁrst two solutions and provides technical support with a single element
to monitor, however, it often fails to scale well in very large campuses
and metropolitan area networks (MANs).This is because most large net-
works and their administration, especially in highly redundant networks,
fail to administer all of the various protocols and timers that would be
needed to manage a Layer 2 topology that would scale to a large size.
This is not to say that it cannot be done, but one must ask what beneﬁts
arise in trying.A single Layer 2 design, which is a VLAN construction,

Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco 340 and Cisco 350 Series Access Points • Chapter 5
219
spreading over an entire campus will ultimately be limited by broadcast
trafﬁc, convergence, administrative control, and protocol conversions,
each of which should give one pause before embarking on such a path.
Administrators may wish to address the historical limitations with
spanning tree, a requirement for large Layer 2 deployments, by using
802.1w, MST, Port Fast, Uplink Fast, or other extensions or changes to
the historical 802.1d Spanning Tree Protocol.This can help, but, again, it
may not provide the desired beneﬁts for a growing wireless deployment,
especially when added to the complexities of router redundancy (Hot
Standby Routing Protocol [HSRP]) and routing protocols (Enhanced
Interior Gateway Routing Protocol [EIGRP], for example).These are
indeed improvements to Radia Perlman’s original spanning tree speciﬁ-
cation, which was never designed for large switched networks, but, again,
the advantages may be offset by the added complexities.
The designer should evaluate each installation considering the likely growth
that will inevitably occur and plan accordingly. Each solution will work, but, as
presented, each is also fraught with compromises.As noted elsewhere in this
chapter, there is little to differentiate wireless networks from their wired brethren,
and the same rules of broadcast and collision domains, in addition to support
models and administrative controls, are valid.As a designer, you ultimately need to
decide what model works for you and your organization.
Initial Conﬁguration of the 
Cisco 340 and 350 Series AP
The initial conﬁguration of the AP is fairly straightforward. Most administrators
prefer to use the console port to conﬁgure a starting conﬁguration for the device.
Afterwards, they may opt to use the Web-based interface to complete the work,
or they may ﬁnish the conﬁguration process from the console. However, Cisco
provides an alternate methodology for the conﬁguration.The primary solution is
the use of the IP Setup Utility, which operates at the data link layer to conﬁgure
a preliminary SSID and IP address.An easier alternative, depending on the instal-
lation, is to collect the IP address from the DHCP server and forgo the IP Setup
Utility—the administrator would then use the Telnet or Web interfaces to con-
nect to the AP.This section presents the IP Setup Utility and the console port
solutions as provided by Cisco.
www.syngress.com

220
Chapter 5 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco 340 and Cisco 350 Series Access Points
It may be warranted to note that some administrators will not conﬁgure an
IP address on the AP for security reasons, however, this is generally not a good
idea.The Web interface is much easier to use as a conﬁguration tool, and the
ability to monitor the AP and remotely administer it in-band should be sufﬁcient
to make the administrator want to conﬁgure an IP address on the AP. Because the
AP is not a router, the actual forwarding of packets is independent of the address
being conﬁgured, however, features such as LEAP and SNMP do require an
address.
IP Setup Utility
In order to simplify the initial conﬁguration of the AP, Cisco provides a network
application called IPSU, or IP Setup Utility.This program allows the adminis-
trator to determine the IP address of the AP if the AP was assigned an address via
a DHCP server. Otherwise, the utility is used to assign the IP address statically.
Please note that the utility is usable only if the workstation and AP are on the
same network. If the obtained address is 10.0.0.1, it signiﬁes that the AP has
reverted to a default setting and the DHCP request has failed.
In order to obtain an IP address, select the Get IP addr option on the right-
hand side of the screen, then input the MAC layer address, identiﬁed on the
bottom of the AP, and select the Get IP Address button.
To conﬁgure the IP address or SSID, the administrator will select the Set
Parameters radio button and then enter the values.The IPSU program is shown
in Figure 5.4.
Please note that IPSU will work only with a default AP—changes made to
the AP will preclude use of IPSU. In addition, to set the SSID you must assign an
IP address, even if that address is the same as the one already conﬁgured on the
device. Setting the IP address does not require an SSID.

221
Terminal Emulator Setup
The terminal emulator setup, or console port connection, is a quick and simple
method for conﬁguring the AP.This solution is particularly convenient when
there is no DHCP server on the network and the administrator wants to assign a
static IP address.
The console port is a standard DB-9 with a conﬁguration of VT-100, 9600,
N, 8, 1. Most terminal emulators support the port, including Windows
Hyperterminal.A straight-through connection is required.
The interface for the console port is the same as the Telnet interface, which is
based tightly on the Web interface engine within the AP.The Express Setup
screen is the most frequently used on the console port for conﬁguration issues.To
set the IP address of the Ethernet interface, the administrator would start typing
the word Address into the interface, for example.The system, by default, will
automatically guess the command and execute it after enough letters have been
entered.

powerful—note that it is used to restore the entire AP to its default conﬁgura-
tion, but that it is available only within the ﬁrst two minutes of powering the
device.There is also a recessed reset button on the back of the AP.
Web-Based Conﬁguration of 
the Cisco 340 and 350 Series APs
Using the Web interface is likely the most common methodology for conﬁguring
the AP.All of the system’s options are available from this interface, and the menu-
driven Telnet interface is difﬁcult to navigate by comparison.
This section presents the settings that administrators will need to change in
their installations, in addition to noting design and conﬁguration recommendations.
Conﬁguring the Cisco 340 and 350 Series APs
The conﬁguration process is simply a matter of reaching the proper screen and
altering the applicable settings.There is no IOS command structure to the AP—
conﬁgurations are prepared via a menu and navigation-based interface.
Please note that different versions of the AP software will alter the placement
and options available to the administrator.This section is written to present the
options available within the current version and generically deﬁne the options
regardless of placement.

224
Chapter 5 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco 340 and Cisco 350 Series Access Points
Conﬁguring the Web Interface
By default, the Web interface conﬁguration is adequate for most users. However,
in some instances, the administrator may want to disable the Web interface (con-
ﬁgured with the nonconsole browsing setting). Some administrators like to
change the network port for the Web interface to thwart limited network scan-
ners that examine only port 80 for Web servers. In Figure 5.5, the HTTP port
has been changed to 8000. Please note that the help interface engine is also con-
ﬁgured from this screen and that the reference is to a Web page on the Cisco
Web site.This allows Cisco to provide the latest information for the help system,
or it allows a company to provide customized help information to users and
administrators.The negative to this conﬁguration is that locating needed informa-
tion can be difﬁcult without a network connection.
Conﬁguring a Name Server
Most administrators will ﬁnd it unnecessary to conﬁgure a name server, but the
AP does provide for the option, as shown in Figure 5.6.The administrator can
deﬁne up to three Domain Name System (DNS) servers, in addition to the
domain information.
The Radio Hardware Setting
The AP Radio Hardware setting (shown in Figure 5.7) is one of the ﬁrst setup
screens that administrators will confront.This screen provides access to the SSID

setting and allows for conﬁguration of the SSID Broadcast feature.The default
radio channel is also selected from this screen.

Chapter 5 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco 340 and Cisco 350 Series Access Points
Please note that the default is for the SSID broadcast feature to be enabled.As
such, any wireless client can connect to the AP if they do not specify one.This
may not be desired.The default SSID is “tsunami”.
SECURITY ALERT
You need to consider the frequency selection as a radio consideration
only, and not a security methodology. Each AP transmits on each channel
with a broadcast message poll. This allows the clients to discover and
conﬁgure the frequency setting.
The SSID is a 32-character, case-sensitive ﬁeld that controls the APs and
client NICs that are allowed to communicate with each other.
As noted previously, the SSID is used to control which AP a workstation
client connects to. However, in some instances, the installation may beneﬁt from
having no SSID controls.These types of installations are increasingly common in
airports and other public places where a wireless domain is conﬁgured for trans-
parent public use and crossover from multiple APs is unlikely.
In addition to the SSID, this screen also allows the conﬁguration of the channel
to be used by the AP for communications to the clients or to each other, as is the
case with using an AP as a repeater.A repeater is an AP used to extend the range of
coverage in an area.They do not perform a load balancing function, and they are
not connected to the wired network.At ﬁrst appearance, one might deduce that 11
channels are available to the network.This is incorrect, because the channels’ fre-
quency ranges or spreads will overlap—the administrator technically should ﬁnd
only three channels available (channels 1, 6, and 11 in North America) with inter-
ference-free overlaps.This is not to say that overlap will occur with channels 2 and
9, for example, but selecting these two channels would restrict the administrator
from adding a third AP within the same radio coverage. Please also note that chan-
nels are country-speciﬁc, and limitations may exist for your installation.
NOTE
International limitations may restrict the channels that you can use in
your installation. Please refer to local regulations or the Cisco documen-
tation for more details.

The AP Radio Port Status Screen
The AP Radio Port status screen provides a veriﬁcation of the conﬁguration
selections made in the AP Radio Hardware Setting screen. Shown in Figure 5.8,
the screen displays detailed receive and transmit statistics in addition to the SSID
and operational radio data rates. Some installations artiﬁcially limit the acceptable
data throughput rates for administrative or performance reasons—for example,
allowing connections at only 11 Mbps so users do not become frustrated with
wireless networking, or 2 Mbps to increase the coverage and user experience
across the wireless domain.This screen is useful in determining if such policies
have been implemented for both initial setup and troubleshooting.
Setting the Time
The AP allows for three time-reporting methods.Accurate reporting of the time
can greatly assist troubleshooting and logging efforts.The ﬁrst of the three time set-
ting methods is actually not setting the time at all—the system begins tracking the
time based on the duration since startup.This is acceptable for very simple installa-
tions; however, enterprise installations will likely prefer more consistent tracking.
The second method is to set the time manually.As shown in Figure 5.9, the
time, time zone, and daylight savings settings are all conﬁgurable.This method
www.syngress.com
Figure 5.8 The AP Radio Port Screen

228
Chapter 5 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco 340 and Cisco 350 Series Access Points
works well, however, no provisions are given for retaining the time if power is
lost. If this happens, the AP will revert to the uptime method of time tracking.
The third method of setting time on the AP may be the best in a large enter-
prise.The AP can learn the time over the network via the Simple Network Time
Protocol (SNTP).This will be relearned upon a restart of the device, and all APs,
in addition to all other network resources, will have the same time—a signiﬁcant
advantage for troubleshooting. Note that SNTP time can be provided by the
Internet, a local time server, or a GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver.
Figure 5.10 shows the acceptance of the time set in Figure 5.9.The current
time is displayed in the upper right-hand corner.
User Accounts
AP administration can be controlled through the use of user accounts. Figure 5.11
shows the user account interface, which has been conﬁgured with an account for
user “rpadjen”.This user has permissions for each of the available options,
including writing changes to the AP, to conﬁgure the SNMP parameters, to
change the identity of the AP, including the IP address and network mask.The
user may also upgrade the ﬁrmware and administer other user accounts. By 
default there are no user accounts, and user management is disabled.

Setting the WEP Key
Cisco provides the Client Encryption Manager (CEM), which sets each of the
four slots available on the client adapter with the static WEP key.As noted earlier,
in the “Enterprise Installations of Wireless Networks” sidebar, use of the static
WEP key is not recommended for installations where security is important—the
key has been compromised by hackers in war driving case studies in as little as 
15 minutes.The time to compromise the WEP key is a function of the packets
captured and the software used to decode the key, as opposed to a processor-

Chapter 5 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco 340 and Cisco 350 Series Access Points
intensive effort where hardware makes a signiﬁcant difference in decode time.
However, use of WEP can dissuade casual hacking attempts.
Figure 5.12 shows the initialization screen for CEM.The default password is
“Cisco”, and it is case-sensitive.The CEM conﬁguration password can be
changed by the administrator from the Commands menu option.
Figure 5.13 shows the Cisco Encryption Manager summary screen.This
screen deﬁnes which key positions are already assigned, the length of the respec-
tive keys, and the capabilities of the hardware.
After selecting the menu option, the user or administrator can enter the static
key value.Typically only the administrator in large enterprises knows this value, if
they use WEP, and NICs are controlled and preconﬁgured for users. Determining
the WEP key value from the NIC is difﬁcult, although it is possible. Loss of a NIC
can quickly require changing all WEP keys in the network.This is another reason
for the interest in LEAP/EAP and 802.11i—new speciﬁcations for WLAN security.
The length of the key is determined by the number of bits involved—40-bit
WEP is shown in Figure 5.14 as a 10 hexadecimal value. Enter the value and
click OK.The software will write the value into NVRAM on the NIC.

The AP must also be conﬁgured with the identical key value, as shown in
Figure 5.15.These values may be 40- or 128-bit values, and the AP must be con-
ﬁgured for full encryption.
Speciﬁcally, the administrator will want to conﬁgure the key value ﬁrst.This
value, in the referenced ﬁgure, is a 40-bit key. Forty-bit values are 10 hexadecimal
characters in length, whereas 128-bit values are 26 hexadecimal characters. Please
note that the compromises of WEP-based security have rendered both key
lengths insecure.
Administrators will then set the transmit option, labeled Transmit With
Key.Although one may set four WEP keys, only one may be used at a time for

Chapter 5 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco 340 and Cisco 350 Series Access Points
transmissions.The authentication parameters are open and shared key, in addition
to the Network-EAP setting, which is used for EAP/LEAP conﬁgurations.The
open setting is slightly preferred to the shared key conﬁguration because shared key
transmits a clear-text query. However, either setting will allow for the use of WEP.
The encryption setting enables or disables the use of WEP, and you should
use caution in enabling the security feature—many administrators accidentally
disconnect themselves from the wireless network by not having the WEP key
conﬁgured and enabled on their wireless adapters.
Encryption may be set to on, off, or mixed.The on and off settings enable and
disable all WEP features.The mixed setting is to differentiate between bridge
communications and devices—turning the feature on means that the bridge will
communicate only with the AP via WEP, but all other resources can choose to
not use WEP. Mixed off is effectively the same as setting the value to off, because
WEP is not used for any communications. Note that the mixed settings are appli-
cable only when using an AP to connect to another AP, and the value for encryp-
tion is normally set to on or off only.
Accounting Setup
The Accounting Setup screen is used to deﬁne RADIUS servers and accounting
services for authentication logging (see Figure 5.16).Authentication is part of the
Cisco AAA (Authentication,Authorization, and Accounting) security model.

Hot Standby
Cisco provides the Hot Standby feature as a hardware redundancy system for APs.
As shown in Figure 5.17, the conﬁguration screen also provides a means for
determining the status of the hot standby feature. Please note that APs are Layer 2
devices, and, as such, hot standby operates on the MAC layer address and not the
IP, or network, address.
Publicly Secure Packet Forwarding
With the release of Cisco AP ﬁrmware release 11.08T, Cisco added the Publicly
Secure Packet Forwarding (PSPF) feature.This setting will likely be used in air-
ports, coffee houses, and other public use installations where the wireless network
needs to ignore its shared-media characteristics and follow a more secure
switched model.With this setting enabled, the wireless network works to block
each wireless client from the others—thus providing a degree of security for the
individual users.
Conﬁguration of PSPF is very straightforward once running the proper ver-
sion of ﬁrmware.As shown in Figure 5.18, the setting is a simple toggle switch,
labeled as Block ALL Inter-Client Communications (“PSPF”) on the
Association Table Advanced screen. Please note that this screen also controls the
timeout values for each device class in the wireless network.

Troubleshooting the 
Cisco 340 and 350 Series APs
Most troubleshooting in Cisco wireless networks involves the conﬁguration set-
tings of the overall network, including the WEP keys, SSIDs, and nonwireless set-
tings, including IP addresses. However, there are other elements at the physical
layer of 802.11b networks that warrant concern and attention when things don’t
work properly.
Figure 5.19 shows the Link Status Meter, which provides an efﬁcient means
to check two wireless characteristics.The ﬁrst is listed at the bottom of the appli-
cation with the line,“Your Cisco Wireless Adapter is Not Associated.”This line is
very telling for troubleshooting, although a number of potential causes exist:
■
The SSID is incorrectly set.
■
The AP is not powered.
■
The signal between the AP and the NIC is too weak to establish a 
connection.
www.syngress.com
Figure 5.18 Conﬁguring Publicly Secure Packet Forwarding

Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco 340 and Cisco 350 Series Access Points • Chapter 5
235
Once these settings and issues have been resolved, and the NIC is placed
within 10 feet unobstructed of the AP the screen should change to the relative
strength of the signal, as shown in Figure 5.20.
The ﬁgure shows an AP approximately 70 feet away from the respective note-
book, and separated by three walls.This distance and the obstructions weaken the
signal, but the quality of the signal is quite good.As such, this installation is
acceptable and should work for the user.
Please note that the Link Status Meter is a good tool to use for site surveys and
pre-installation documentation as well. Install an AP in a trial position and use the
notebook as a mobile meter to see where dead zones and other problems arise.

Chapter 5 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco 340 and Cisco 350 Series Access Points
If the Link Status Meter is not available, the PCMCIA (PC Card) NIC also
has two indicator lights that you can use for basic troubleshooting.The Status light
will blink at two-second intervals if the NIC is associated, and it will blink faster
when trying to acquire.The Activity light will blink when trafﬁc is present. If this
light shows activity, the Status light appears correct, and the Link Status Meter ver-
iﬁes this information, it is appropriate to examine the IP connectivity settings.
A common installation for WLANs is the use of DHCP. DHCP automatically
assigns the IP address of the host, which can greatly simplify workstation manage-
ment.As with wired networks, it is possible to have the host connect to the net-
work but not connect to the DHCP server for an address. In most Windows
systems, the IP address can be viewed with either the WINIPCFG or the
IPCONFIG command (Windows 95, 98 and Windows NT, 2000 and XP, respec-
tively).When the workstation cannot obtain an IP address, it may retain a previously
assigned address, announce a clear rejection of the DHCP request, or substitute a
locally assigned (host-based) IP address.The locally assigned address is always in the
169.254.0.0/16 address space, and, if when troubleshooting, the administrator sees
this address, it should be an indication that the DHCP process failed.
Another diagnostic tool is the Network Ports screen in the AP. Shown in
Figure 5.21, this screen reports the errors and trafﬁc volumes for both the
Ethernet and wireless interfaces of the network. Remember that both interfaces
are important to diagnose when researching a connectivity problem.
www.syngress.com
Figure 5.21 The Network Ports Screen

Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco 340 and Cisco 350 Series Access Points • Chapter 5
237
Each port also has a dedicated screen for interface statistics—the Ethernet-
only port statistics are shown in Figure 5.22. Note that some statistics, such as
underruns, are available only from the interface-speciﬁc screen.As with a wired
network, errors and discards are both signiﬁcant, as would be unusual trafﬁc pat-
terns based on expectations. Collisions, particularly on the Ethernet interface
conﬁgured for full duplex, should not occur, and would indicate a error or
duplex mismatch, just as with a wired network.
In addition to the reactive processes available in the Link Status Meter and
the Network Ports screen, the AP supports SNMP alarms and traps, as well as
Syslog messages.These are conﬁgured to integrate with your management
system, yielding an integrated solution.
The Event Notiﬁcations screen, shown in Figure 5.23, is used to conﬁgure
the SNMP and Syslog receivers.
In addition, the administrator can tune the system to provide additional infor-
mation regarding speciﬁc types of error conditions.The Event Handling Setup,
shown in Figure 5.24, controls this.
The event display setup also provides management services for error messages.
This is conﬁgured from the Event Display Setup screen, which is shown in
Figure 5.25.

The Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is a proprietary, SNAP-based protocol
that advertises Cisco hardware to attached systems.The protocol is often used to
verify physical layer connectivity because it is independent of Layer 3 services,
such as IP.Although conﬁguration of CDP is a fairly simple process, administra-
tors and designers should consider the security ramiﬁcations of enabling the ser-
vice. On trusted enterprise interfaces, it should always be enabled; however, on
unprotected Internet or untrusted connections, this service can provide too much
information that could be used in concert with other attack vectors (methodolo-
gies for compromising a system).The default settings transmit a CDP packet
every 60 seconds, with a three times hold time, or 180 seconds. In Figure 5.26,
the service has been disabled. Note that the wireless and Ethernet ports may be
individually selected for CDP services.

Chapter 5 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco 340 and Cisco 350 Series Access Points
Some problems with the AP may be resolved only with the installation of a
product upgrade.These ﬁles and the problems they resolve are listed on Cisco’s
Web site (currently www.cisco.com/kobayashi/sw-center/sw-wireless.shtml) and
the presentation of the ﬁles is shown in Figures 5.27 and 5.28. Cisco Connection
Online is the best source of bug listings and resolutions, and administrators
should review this information prior to installation to eliminate repeating known
problems with the wireless systems.
As shown in Figure 5.27, the Wireless Software page provides client drivers
and AP software for users. Please note that in addition to the Aironet 340 and
350 platforms (Aironet was the original manufacturer of the APs and was
acquired by Cisco Systems) the drivers and utilities include Linux,Windows,
Macintosh, and DOS resources.
In Figure 5.28, the current and recent versions are available for download.
This includes technical documentation and ﬁrmware. Please note that the
ﬁrmware version numbering system is comparable to the mainline IOS.The 340’s
current software releases, as of this writing, are 11.06, 11.07, and 11.10T.Versions
in the T train are new feature releases that may have more quality issues than
mainline releases, however, Cisco realizes that some customers need the new fea-
tures even with the added risk. Mainline IOS releases are generally more stable

and incorporate only those features that have undergone signiﬁcant production
testing.These releases are the only ones that can be categorized as “GD,” or gen-
eral deployment.This classiﬁcation is typically the most error-free of all releases.
File upgrades are well accounted for by the system, and although the tools are
less than ideal for upgrading hundreds of APs, they are well suited for the
upgrade of multiple systems.
The AP also has a useful summary display from the Aironet Client Utility,
under the Commands | Status menu option.As shown in Figure 5.29, this
screen provides a real-time view of the AP, its current signal level to the worksta-
tion running the software, and the ﬁrmware and other characteristics of the AP.
Web-Based Conﬁguration of 
the Cisco 340 BSE/BSM Series AP
The Cisco 340 BSM (Base Station AIR-BSM128) is a variant of the standard
Cisco 340 AP. It is ideally suited to installations with up to 10 users, and the
product features an integrated modem and ﬁxed antenna. (The nonmodem ver-
sion is the AIR-BSE128, and is suited to cable modem and DSL installations
only) The product supports WEP and incorporates a DHCP server. It is designed

Chapter 5 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco 340 and Cisco 350 Series Access Points
to provide single users or small groups with efﬁcient networking, and the device
terminates cable modems, digital subscriber line (DSL), or analog modem con-
nections. Please note that PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) is supported and is com-
monly required for DSL installations.
Conﬁguring the Cisco 340 BSE/BSM Series AP
The conﬁguration of the BSE and BSM models is somewhat different from the
other Aironet models. First, the conﬁguration of the device may be accomplished
only by use of the wireless interface.This is intended to be a security measure to
prevent unauthorized persons from accessing the AP from the Internet connec-
tion; however, it can lead to a more compromised system for a number of rea-
sons. First, the installation of any connection to the Internet should include a
level of ﬁrewall protection. Placing this outside of the AP is always a good idea to
protect both the AP and the computers connected to the wireless side of the
bridge.This, of course, is limited when using the built-in modem.The second is
that many users do not change the default SSID, which is “tsunami”.
Although we cannot stress enough that the SSID is not a valid security mea-
sure (it can be quickly discovered), it is recommended that this value be changed.
With the BSE and BSM APs, the SSID is the only default protection to restrict
access to the conﬁguration parameters.This is unlike the other Cisco APs,
which may also be conﬁgured with user accounts and passwords.
Many administrators will choose to use the Base Station Client Utility to
conﬁgure the BSE/BSM.The initial screen of this tool is shown in Figure 5.30.
www.syngress.com
Figure 5.29 The Series Status Screen

Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco 340 and Cisco 350 Series Access Points • Chapter 5
243
Note that the bottom line of the screen shows that the AP is associated with
the workstation—both the IP address (192.168.200.1) and the MAC address are
displayed.This requires that the workstation wireless adapter is conﬁgured with
the default SSID of “tsunami”.You can conﬁgure this without the client utility
by using the Control Panel, Network option, as shown in Figure 5.31.You can
also select the setting in the Client Utility.
To modify the settings, select the Base Station | Set Up Base Station
option, as shown in Figure 5.32.
This will take you to the Settings screen, as shown in Figure 5.33. Many of
the settings are already provided from the workstation conﬁguration, including
Computer Name and Network Name. Selecting Edit Base Station Settings
will allow modiﬁcation of the conﬁguration, including selection of the dial-out
modem. Note that the BSE/BSM always uses 192.168.200.0/24 and network
address translation for the wireless interface.The BSE/BSM is addressed as
192.168.200.1.

Chapter 5 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco 340 and Cisco 350 Series Access Points
The BSE/BSM also provides Web and Telnet interfaces for conﬁguration. No
passwords exist to protect the conﬁguration parameters, which makes the BSE/
BSM ill-suited for corporate installations.The product is well suited for home
installation and small ofﬁce/temporary installations.The Web and Telnet screens
are shown in Figures 5.34 and 5.35, respectively.

As of version 8.52, the NAT protocol on the BSE/BSM was not compatible
with VPN tunnels (IPSec).

Troubleshooting the

Troubleshooting the BSE and BSM models of the Cisco Aironet APs is compa-
rable to troubleshooting the standard AP models. Certain features are simpler to
eliminate—for example, the BSE/BSM does not support roaming or antenna
selection. In addition, such installations tend to be much smaller in diameter,
so the overall conﬁguration is much easier to review and isolate as it relates to
problems.

Summary
Cisco provides three 802.11b APs for different user communities.The Cisco 340
is designed to provide a wide range of wireless services; the Cisco 350 adds inline
power features and greater radio power for improved range.The simpler 340
BSM provides a reasonable home-ofﬁce solution with integrated Port Address
Translation and DHCP services.The integrated modem can greatly assist rapid,
small group deployments.
Conﬁguration of the Cisco 340 and 350 APs is a fairly straightforward pro-
cess.The initial installation considerations are quite similar to those of a wired
network; however, you should consider a site survey when considering deploy-
ments of more than a few APs.This will allow you to address such issues as the IP
addressing schema, roaming requirements, security, coverage issues, and antenna
placement. Once these considerations have been addressed, the installation of the
AP is virtually identical to those of a router or switch.
Cisco provides three methods for conﬁguring the AP.The ﬁrst is the use of
the IP Setup Utility to locate the IP address of the AP before conﬁguring it.The
second is the local console port, which allows conﬁguration via the command-
line interface.The third is to conﬁgure the AP via a DHCP server and deter-
mined IP address via Telnet or the Web interface. Many users ﬁnd the Web
interface to be easier in practice.
Conﬁguration of the 340 BSM is much more limited, however, the product
includes the option of using WEP and the SSID.The antennas are ﬁxed on this
system, however, and there is no console port. Conﬁguration is possible only via
the wireless interface, which is provided as a minor security feature.The default
SSID is “tsunami”, and it should be changed upon installation.
The conﬁguration of the AP, regardless of the methodology, is facilitated with
a solid documentation process. Unlike their wired counterparts, wireless networks
can include many additional conﬁguration details, including the SSID,WEP keys,
channel selection, antenna aiming and range, and power options—inline or out-
of-line. Each of these parameters is in addition to VLAN and IP address conﬁgu-
ration.Also, administrators may wish to deploy VPN technologies in addition to
their wireless network for additional security, or use LEAP/EAP to correct deﬁ-
ciencies in WEP.
Troubleshooting wireless networks requires skills in both traditional wired
technologies and the presumably new skills involved with wireless systems.
Common problems with wireless networks include radio interference, incorrect

Chapter 5 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco 340 and Cisco 350 Series Access Points
SSID values, and misconﬁgured WEP keys. Cisco provides tools for isolating each
of these problems as they occur.
In addition, the AP can integrate with the traditional wired management sys-
tems, including SNMP, Syslog, and CDP services.These tools can simplify the
challenges of bringing wireless networking into the enterprise environment;
however, they do not replace careful planning and training.

Q: How can 802.11b installations plan for upgrades to 802.11a?
A: Remember that the 5 GHz frequency range of the 802.11a standard reduces
the range of the wireless LAN compared to the 2.4 GHz 802.11b.As such, it
may theoretically require up to four times the number of APs to provide the
same 802.11b coverage under 802.11a.
Q: How can I secure an 802.11 installation?
A: If any single factor has limited the rate of adoption within wireless net-
working, it is security.WEP was defeated quite quickly and scanners rapidly
located installations. Currently, a WEP key can be cracked in about 15 min-
utes with simple hardware and software. Other elements of the 802.11 speci-
ﬁcation, including the SSID, were thought to be security functions, however,

Chapter 5 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco 340 and Cisco 350 Series Access Points
this was not their true intention. Cisco, along with other vendors, adopted
extra methods for augmenting the security of wireless LANs, including the
use of MAC address control and EAP, which exchanges keys via RADIUS.
The 802.11x speciﬁcation further adds to the security available in wireless
networks, as would unrelated solutions such as IPSec.
However, if the goal is to completely secure a wireless installation, a better
recommendation would be to overlay another technology or protocol.
Common considerations include the use of IPSec, or VPN technology, or SSL
Web services. Both of these standards provide excellent security over both
wireless and wired transports.
In the near future, new standards will be introduced.These solutions
include works by the 802.11 task group I, or TGi, which is working on the
802.11i speciﬁcation.The 802.11i standard may continue to use the RC4
protocol that was used in WEP v1 and WEP v2, and is, as of this writing,
mired in political and technical debate. Solutions using the newer Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES) and AES with Secure Remote Password (SRP)
may be available within 2002, which should greatly enhance the adoption of
wireless technology within a secure model.

Q: What can be done to increase bandwidth within a wireless LAN?
A: It is true that the 802.11b shared bandwidth of 11 Mbps can quickly become
a limitation of the technology.The 802.11g standard will increase this limita-
tion within the 2.4 GHz spectrum to greater than 20 Mbps. Of course, the
802.11a standard already provides over 50 Mbps, and vendor-speciﬁc imple-
mentations have improved upon this ﬁgure substantially.
A few tricks can improve performance within an existing 802.11b net-
work however. First, although there are 11 channels, or frequencies within the
speciﬁcation, only three can be used within a particular area.As such, by con-
trolling the channels for each of three APs, one could create a combined 33

Mbps wireless domain. Careful placement of antennas, including the use of
directional antennas, can further control the boundaries of a wireless network,
and thus, the number of nodes and the bandwidth available to each.
In addition, network designers are again looking to application control
and user demands in the design of the network.An all-PDA network, for
example, will likely require little in terms of total bandwidth. In a notebook
or tablet PC environment, you may need to provide additional services and
higher bandwidth applications. For these installations, you should consider
remote control terminal server technologies. In terms of bandwidth, these
installations require very little—typically less than 30 Kbps per user, regardless
of the applications in use.Although the entire cost of the network increases,
the security and support models for such an installation may warrant its
usage.
Q: What will be the impact of 3G cellular services and other long-distance solu-
tions on WLANs?
A: The answer to this question will be quite interesting and is simply unknown
at this time. Most likely, however, third generation cellular services will be
one part of a larger solution that includes wireless LAN technology. Phones,
PDAs, tablet PCs, watches, and pagers will all likely converge into various
hybrids that make use of the most effective technology. For example, a PDA
with cellular phone services will likely incorporate 802.11 WLAN, cellular,
and Bluetooth services, and it will automatically select the fastest and cheapest
available service for the needed function. It is unlikely that cellular public
networks will supplant WLANs, because control, privacy, and bandwidth will
remain differentiators.

Chapter 6 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges
Introduction
Wireless bridges are used as the intermediary connection between wireless net-
work segments.They provide a means of linking separate LAN components into
a logical whole. In this chapter, we discuss the use of traditional bridges within a
cabled environment, and we draw parallels to the operations of wireless bridges
within the wireless network.
In subsequent sections of the chapter, we discuss the overall architecture
layout of wireless bridges in point-to-point and point-to-multipoint mode and
look at environmental constraints that you should take into account when
bridging over a wireless connection.We take a close look at wireless bridge con-
ﬁguration from an operational and security perspective followed by event logging
and network testing and troubleshooting.
Within the Cisco Aironet wireless LAN family, two series of wireless LAN
components are available, namely the 340 series and the 350 series.All of the 340
and 350 series of components, including bridges, adapters, access points (APs),
and repeaters, are all interoperable.The basic difference between the two model
series relates to the power level output of the radio used.
The 350 series provides a more powerful radio transmitter that the 340 series.
The 350 transmitter can operate at power signal strengths up to 100 milliwatts.
The 340 transmitter is limited to power strengths up to 30 milliwatts. Depending
on the deployment requirements, lower powered 340 series wireless bridges may
suit the networking needs of most bridges located within short proximity to
other wireless components. For longer transmission distances or in areas where
radio signals are impacted by environmental factors, the more powerful 350 series
wireless bridge may be better suited. Selecting the right bridge for each speciﬁc
environment can be facilitated by testing the throughput of the wireless media
using the radio link test menu options as described later in this chapter.
Understanding the Role of 
Traditional Network Bridges
Before we take a look at how wireless bridges work, you need to understand
where the bridging concept came from.This understanding will help you have a
better perspective regarding why bridges are used and how to better integrate
their capabilities within the wireless network environment.
In traditional cabled networks, bridges are used to interconnect smaller net-
work segments together to form a larger contiguous network segment.This 
www.syngress.com

www.syngress.com
provides the means for network nodes such as servers and workstations to com-
municate over a shared network media link In addition, to providing a link
between smaller network segments, bridges are also be used to interconnect net-
work segments that use the same base network protocol but different media or
speed to create a single network.An example of this would be to interconnect a
TCP/IP network segment that operates at 10 Mbps over twisted-pair cable with
a TCP/IP network segment that operates at 100 Mbps using optical ﬁber.
Although these networks use different media speeds, a bridge can be used to
interlink the two segments to form a larger network capable of supporting com-
munications between any and all of the workstations on either of the segments.
This is often used to support LAN environments where a hybrid network is in
use to support the higher throughput requirements of servers and lower
throughput requirements of desktop stations.
Bridges operate at Layer 1 (the Physical layer) and Layer 2 (the Data Link
layer) of the ISO Protocol Stack (see Figure 6.1).
Bridges use a minimum amount of processing and are protocol transparent.
They often provide a more cost effective means of interconnecting network seg-
ments. Bridges generally perform three basic functions (see Figure 6.2): learning,
forwarding, and ﬁltering.
■
Learning Bridges can “learn” the addresses of network components
and their overall location based on either static conﬁgurations that are

manually entered by an administrator and/or intelligent routing proto-
cols that are used by the bridge to learn the network and/or packet
trafﬁc analysis. In learning mode, bridges can determine the location of
devices be it “local” for devices located on the local segment or
“remote” for devices not located on the local segment.While bridges
“learn” the network at a high level, they do not have a total under-
standing of the true topology of the entire network. Simply speaking
they know what is on the local network segment and what is not.
Figure 6.2 shows an example of a bridge learning the location of
workstations on each of its interfaces. Notice that on LAN#1 it has
identiﬁed two workstations (PC-L1A, PC-L1B), and on LAN#2 it has
identiﬁed to other workstations (PC-L2A and PC-L2B).
■
Forwarding Bridges have knowledge of the location of network
resources (local or remote) and as such, can forward data packets
intended for resources not located on the local segment on to the next
LAN segment for further transmission and address resolution.
In Figure 6.2, the ﬁrst LAN layout provides an example of packet
forwarding. In this example, workstation PC-L1B is sending a packet to
PC-L2A.The bridge identiﬁes that the packet destination is not on the
local interface and thus forwards the packet to the remote side, which in
this case is LAN#2 and where PC-L2A is located.
■
Filtering Bridges can also ﬁlter data packets originating and destined
for network resources located on the local segment.As such, the bridge
discards these packets and prevents the further communication of the
packets onto other LAN segments.
In Figure 6.2, the second LAN layout provides an example of packet
ﬁltering. In this example, workstation PC-L1A is sending a packet to PC-
L1B.When the bridge sees the packet, it identiﬁes that the packet destina-
tion is located on the local interface and thus does not forward the packet
to the remote side, and the packet remains on the local segment only.
Types of Network Bridges
Before we take a look at wireless bridges, we take a moment to review the various
types of bridges used over traditional cabled networks.As we noted earlier, bridges
are used to interlink various types of network segments and as such generally fulﬁll
one or more roles.As we describe each type of network bridge, we draw parallels
between the operations of each and how they relate to wireless bridges.

There are four major types of network bridges:

Transparent Bridges
Transparent bridges are conﬁgured on LANs where the same physical and MAC
level protocols of the datalink layer are used on both of the segment but where
transmission speed may vary. Over traditional cabled LANs, an example of this

Chapter 6 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges
would be an Ethernet LAN segment operating at 10 Mbps over twisted-pair
connected using a bridge to an Ethernet LAN segment operating at 100 Mbps
over twisted-pair.
Wireless bridges provide a similar functionality in that client-to-bridge and
bridge-to-bridge connections can be established over Ethernet of varying
throughputs (1 Mbps, 2 Mbps, 5 Mbps or 11 Mbps) depending on the type of
connection and environmental factors that can impact radio transmission and
reception.The wireless bridge provides the means to support connections
between wireless LAN segments operating at a different throughput rates.
Translating Bridges
Translating bridges are conﬁgured for LANs where each LAN segment is using
different physical and MAC level protocols.Translating bridges translate data
transmissions from one format to the other by manipulating the packet data so
that it corresponds to the frame structure of other media. Protocols used at the
Network layer and above still need to be compatible for proper communications
to occur between network devices.
An example of this would be to use a translating bridge to link an Ethernet
LAN and a token ring LAN to each other. In this example, network resources
located on the Ethernet LAN can exchange data with users on the token ring
LAN and the reverse is also true.
A note of caution:Translation bridges generally do not provide for frame seg-
mentation, and as such, you need to take care to ensure that the size of packets
transmitted by a host on one LAN will be supported by the networking proto-
cols of the other LAN. If you don’t account for this, invalid packets can be trans-
mitted over a LAN segment causing network issues, deterioration of network
services, and availability of the transmission media.
In most cases, wireless bridges are used on Ethernet-based networks.
Although the wireless LAN protocols are designed around the same 802.3 MAC
layer used by Ethernet networks, wireless protocols are provided with special
enhancements that are used to optimize the use of the radio network. Generally
speaking, the differences between the 802.3 MAC protocols used on wireless
LAN and Ethernet LANs are minimal, and wireless bridges are not required to
support MAC-level protocol translation.
Wireless bridges do, however, provide physical media translation, that is
bridging the cabled Ethernet LAN with the wireless Ethernet network.
www.syngress.com

Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges • Chapter 6
259
Encapsulating Bridges
Encapsulating bridges are used when similar LAN segments are interconnected
using a third intermediary LAN segment that is not similar to the others at either
end.An example of this would be bridging two Ethernet LAN segments using a
token ring LAN segment in-between. In this example, the encapsulating bridge
wraps Ethernet packets destined for the remote LAN into a token ring packet
and places them on the token ring.When the encapsulated packet arrives at the
remote bridge, it is unwrapped of its token ring envelope and is transmitted over
the Ethernet LAN segment.As with translating bridges, you need to take due
care to ensure compatibility of frame sizes over different network services.
Wireless bridges generally are not required to fulﬁll this function.
Source Route Bridges
Some network protocols allow network resources to specify the complete routing
instructions for each packet transmitted.The routing information is located
within Data Link layer and not the Network layer. Source Route bridges use this
routing data to determine the appropriate route for each packet.
Wireless bridges generally are not required to fulﬁll this function.
Comparing Traditional 
Bridges with Wireless Bridges
Cisco Aironet wireless bridges are similar to traditional wired network bridges 
in that they are standalone devices providing an interface between two types of
network segments: wired network segments and wireless network segments over
TCP/IP and Ethernet.As such, the wireless bridge is akin to a translating bridge,
providing an interface that allows devices and resources that are located on the
wired network segment to communicate and exchange data with devices and
resources that are located on the wireless network segment.The opposite is 
also true.
The wireless bridge is protocol independent in that it does not verify, analyze,
or modify packets that are to be forwarded.When the wireless bridge receives
multicast packets, it processes the packet based on the packet header regardless of
whether the protocol is recognized.When the wireless bridge receives packets
that are intended for its own use, such as network management packets and con-
ﬁguration sessions, the packet is examined and the protocol header is assessed. If
the protocol is recognized, the packet is processed.The wireless bridge supports
TCP/IP and SNMP conforming to the MIB-I and MIB-II standards.

Chapter 6 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges
The Cisco Aironet 340 and 350 wireless bridges use the Direct Sequence
Spread Spectrum (DSSS) radio transmission and modulation technique within
the 2.4 GHz Industrial Scientiﬁc and Medical (ISM) band. It supports transmis-
sion rates of up to 11 Mbps over a half-duplex radio channel, meaning it can
send or receive transmissions but not do both at the same time.
Cisco Aironet 340 and 350 wireless bridges can communicate with Cisco
Aironet APs and other Cisco Aironet wireless devices but not with wireless net-
working devices manufactured by other vendors.
Cisco Aironet 340 and 350 wireless bridges can be used in one of three modes:
■
Wireless bridge between two wired network segments (point-to-point)
■
Wireless bridge between three or more wired network segments (point-
to-multipoint)
■
Wireless bridge used as a repeater (repeater)
Cisco Aironet Wireless Bridge—Point to Point
You can use the Cisco Aironet wireless bridges as the interconnection point
between two wired network segments to form a larger contiguous network seg-
ment (point-to-point). In this mode, a Cisco Aironet wireless bridge is used to
communicate with another Cisco Aironet wireless bridge that is itself connected
to its own distinct wired LAN.While both units are conﬁgured with a matching
system Service Set Identiﬁer (SSID) or wireless LAN number, one of the units is
conﬁgured as the Root Node while the other unit is conﬁgured as a Remote
Node.The use of Root Nodes and Remote Nodes are covered in detail in the
section entitled “Initial Setup of the Cisco Aironet Wireless Bridge” found later in
this chapter.
Wireless radio signals broadcast and received by the Cisco Aironet wireless
bridge are used to “bridge” the physical the gap between the LAN segments.
Network resources located on one wired network segment can access network
resources located on the other wired network segment via the wireless network
bridge connection (see Figure 6.3).
This conﬁguration is useful for interlinking two wired LAN segments located
on different ﬂoors of a building or between different nearby buildings where tra-
ditional cabling solutions may not be feasible or are cost prohibitive.This amalga-
mation of wired LANs using wireless bridging is often referred to as a Virtual
LAN.This should not be confused with Virtual LANs or VLANs identiﬁers used
in switched network environments.

In Figure 6.3, notice how Bridge #1 is used to forward a packet from PC-
L1B to PC-L2A and how Bridge #2 is used to ﬁlter a packet that is sent from
PC-L2A to PC-L2B.
Cisco Aironet Wireless Bridge—Point-to-Multipoint
You can use the Cisco Aironet wireless bridge as the interconnection point
between three or more network segments (point-to-multipoint). In this mode, all
of the wireless bridges share the same SSID LAN number, but one of the wireless
bridges is conﬁgured as the Root Node while all of the other wireless bridges are
conﬁgured as Remote Node (see Figure 6.4).
In point-to-multipoint mode, the wireless radio signals transmitted by one of
the Remote Nodes is acknowledged and acted upon only by its parent node or
the Root Node. Signals received by Remote Nodes from the Root Node are
acknowledged and acted upon.All other communications are discarded.
Cisco Wireless Bridge—Repeater
When a Cisco Aironet wireless bridge is conﬁgured as a Remote Node, it is also
conﬁgured as a repeater.Although not a conﬁguration by itself, it is important to
note it as an operating distinction.As a repeater, it will rebroadcast any and all
communications from the Root Node or from a parent that is destined to a

bridge with a child relationship or that of a wireless bridge that has a child rela-
tionship with the remote bridges’ own child.This is effective in increasing the
range of the radio signals broadcast by the Root Node and for extending the
radio hop count of transmissions.
Wireless bridge repeaters can act as standard Remote Nodes with a con-
nected local wired LAN or as standalone repeaters with no local wired LAN
connections.
Installation of the 
Cisco Aironet Bridge Unit
The Cisco Aironet 340 and 350 wireless bridge consists of an antenna connector,
a 10Base2 network connector, a 10Base5 network connector, a 10BaseT network
connector, a DB-9 female console port connector, an Ethernet LED, a Status
LED, and a Radio LED.
Before powering up the wireless bridge, you should make the antenna, net-
work and console/serial port connections.

Installing the Antenna
The Cisco Aironet wireless bridge provides a connector port for an external
antenna on the back of the unit.You can use a low-loss antenna cable to extend
the distance between the wireless bridge and the antenna. Before deciding on
which type antenna to use, you should perform a wireless site survey to assess the
speciﬁc environmental factors that will impact the transmission and reception of
radio signals.The wireless site survey will provide guidance for the type and
placement of antennas and will help establish baseline metrics for the expected
sensitivity, range, and data communication rates.
Some of the key factors that will impact the selection and position of
antennas include the physical location of the wireless bridge with respect to
overall physical environment, power lines, the presence of obstructions, and the
types of materials through which the radio signals may have to propagate. Radio
signals can also be hampered by interference from other devices operating within
the 2.4 GHz frequency range, microwave ovens, electrical motors, and metal
objects within the vicinity of the antenna.
DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum)
DSSS is the acronym for Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum. In DSSS, the digital
data signal is inserted in a higher data rate chipping code according to a predeter-
mined spreading ratio.The chipping code is a bit sequence generally consisting of a
redundant bit pattern that incorporates the original bit pattern. Figure 6.5 is a
simpliﬁcation of how a statistical technique is used to create the chipping code
abstraction from the original bit sequence.
This technique reduces interference because if the original data pattern is com-
promised, the data can be recovered based on the remainder of the chipping code.
The longer the chipping code, the more likely it is that the original data can be
recovered. Long chipping codes have the drawback of requiring more bandwidth.
In general, a clear line of sight should be maintained between communicating
antennas (see Figure 6.6). Obstructions can attenuate signals thus limiting the
range of the wireless bridge. Directional antennas can also be used to focus the
radio signal strength in one direction.When sending signals outside, care should
be taken to ensure a clear line of sight is available between the wireless bridges.
This is especially relevant to the Cisco Aironet 340 wireless bridge transmitting in
the 2.4 GHz frequency.Although signals emitted at 2.4 GHz will pass thought
most solid objects such as walls, they do not pass through objects with a high
water content very well because 2.4 GHz signals are absorbed by water molecules

Chapter 6 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges
and causes these molecules to become excited, otherwise known as heated.This is
the same principle that makes microwave ovens work so well with “wet” food
and not very well with “dry” food.
In addition to line of sight considerations, you need to consider the Fresnel
zone when planning long-distance radio transmissions or transmissions that will
be outside of a building.The Fresnel zone refers to an elliptical area that wraps
the direct line of sight path above, below, and to either side (see Chapter 4 for
more detail on line of sight and the Fresnel zone).
Lastly, you should install a lightning arrestor to the antenna connector on the
wireless bridge when using antennas located outside a building.The lightening

arrestor will provide protection from voltage surges resulting from a lightning dis-
charge striking the antenna.
Additional information on the installation and use of antennas, lightening
arrestors, low-loss antenna connection cables, and other optional components are
covered in greater detail in Chapter 9 of this book.
Conﬁguring the Network Port
You can connect the Cisco Aironet wireless bridge to 10Base2 (Thicknet),
10Base5 (Thicknet), or 10BaseT (twisted-pair) Ethernet LAN segments.The
wireless bridge network connection can be used only by one type of network
segment at any given time. Segments that are connected to the wireless bridge
must conform to the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet speciﬁcation. If you’re connecting the
wireless bridge to a network other than an Ethernet segment, you can use a
third-party network bridge to interface the non-Ethernet network with one of
the Ethernet ports on the wireless bridge.
The wireless bridge’s 10BaseT network port can be connected to a hub. In
this conﬁguration, the wireless bridge will support up to eight devices connected
to the hub.When connecting to a hub using the 10BaseT network interface on
the wireless bridge using a standard straight-through twisted-pair cable, you
should use the hub’s cascade port to allow for the proper transmission of signals.
Some hubs use a cascade switch to activate one of the ports in cascade mode; this
again allows for the interconnection of two network devices using a standard
straight-through twisted-pair cable. If the hub does not have a cascade port or
cascade port switch, or when connecting to other end devices such as worksta-
tions and servers, you must use a cross-over twisted-pair cable.
LED indicators are provided on the back of the wireless bridge next to the
network interfaces indicating which is the active network interface along with
the data transmission activity in terms of when packets are being received or
transmitted (see Table 6.1).

nications protocol is set to 9600 Baud, no-parity, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (9600
8N1).The console port expects a terminal that is set as a DTE (Data Terminal
Equipment) device.
Once the initial conﬁgurations are completed, you can remove the console
connection, because it is not required to be present during routine day-to-day
operations.You can perform further conﬁgurations after the wireless bridge has
been assigned an IP address using Telnet, HTML, or SNMP from a remote host,
browser, or management station.
Applying Power
After you install and conﬁgure the antenna, network, and console port connec-
tions, you can apply power to the wireless bridge. Power is provided by an
external AC/DC power supply.The power connector is located on the side of
the wireless bridge next to the console port and the On/Off power switch.
When you depress the On/Off power switch to apply power, the LED indi-
cators for Ethernet, Status, and Radio ﬂash in sequence to verify operation of the
indicators. During operation, the Ethernet indicator is not active but becomes
active in the presence of network activity, speciﬁcally, the reception and transmis-
sion of packets over the Ethernet interface.The Status indicator should always be
on, providing a visual conﬁrmation that a radio association has been established.
The Radio indicator becomes active in the presence of radio activity, speciﬁcally
the transmission or receipt of packets over the radio interface.
For environments deploying Cisco Aironet 350 wireless bridges, you can also
provide power remotely over the Ethernet cable linking the bridge with a Cisco
Catalyst switch, from a Catalyst inline power patch panel, or from a Cisco power
injector. Providing power using one of these solutions eliminates the need to pro-
vide localized electrical power in difﬁcult-to-access areas where wireless bridges
may be located.
Working with Root and Non-Root 
Modes on a Wireless Bridge
When architecting a new wireless network, take care to deﬁne the overall wire-
less topology and how wired LAN segments will interface with the wireless net-
work via the wireless bridges.As part of this exercise, one of the wireless bridges
will be deﬁned as a Root Node bridge.This Root bridge will be considered the
starting point, top, or parent of the network tree.The Root bridge acts as the

Chapter 6 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges
focal point for all of the wireless trafﬁc generated over the wireless network, that
is, all of the wireless trafﬁc generated by each of the wireless bridges associated
with the SSID of the Root bridge will pass through the Root bridge. From a
network perspective, the Root Node bridge and all its Remote Node bridges
will appear as a single multiport bridge.
Generally speaking, the Root bridge is usually connected to the main wired
LAN or backbone of the wired network. Or, you can connect the Root bridge
to the LAN segment that will generate or receive the most wireless trafﬁc. Note
that only one Root bridge can exist.All other wireless network bridges and end
nodes will be considered subordinates or children of the Root (see Figure 6.7).
The default conﬁguration for wireless bridges is to have Root mode set to
active or “on.”When implementing wireless networks with more than one wire-
less bridge, you can permit only one bridge to remain the root, and you must
conﬁgure the other bridges to be Remote Nodes. Remote Nodes are also

referred to as repeater bridges. Repeater bridges can establish communications
with a Root bridge or other Remote/Repeater bridges. Root bridges can only
establish communications with Remote bridges and not to other Root bridges.
Information on how to enable and disable a bridge as a Root Node is provided
in the section entitled “Using the Cisco Aironet Wireless Bridge Radio Main
Menu” later in this chapter.
Overview of the Spanning Tree Protocol
The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) was ﬁrst created to assist in the deployment of
bridged networks. Speciﬁcally it is used to establish precisely one path between
any two nodes on the network even when alternatives are available. In complex
meshed networks using bridges, the connection between the source and destina-
tion nodes may have multiple paths over which to transmit the data.These alter-
nate paths are referred to as loops. Loops can be the cause of the duplication of
packets whereby available network throughput can be reduced, affecting the
overall network performance.
The spanning tree itself refers to all the network connections and bridges that
make up the complete bridged network.The tree originates at the Root bridge
and expands out to the farthest bridges.The Root bridge is determined by elec-
tion or by mandate when a hard-coded assignment is in effect.
Typically, interfaces that create loops are disabled or assigned a high-cost path.
When bridging network trafﬁc, the least-cost path is always the one used while
higher-cost alternatives are disregarded or available only in the event of a primary
link failure.This ensures that one and only one path is ever available (see Figure
6.8). End users usually are unaware that a speciﬁc path is being used versus another.
STP was originally developed by Digital Equipment Corporation and was
adapted by the IEEE 802 working groups.The Cisco Aironet wireless bridge sup-
ports the IEEE 802 STP implementation. For each network link and wireless
bridge belonging to the wireless network, STP provides the following:
■
Loop detection STP detects loops and eliminates redundant paths.
■
Automatic backup of paths Bridges with redundant paths are
assigned a backup role; that is, they are ready to be switched on in the
event of a primary link failure.
■
Administrative conﬁgurations Network Administrators can modify
the conﬁgurations established by STP to address special network
requirements. Special requirements can include increasing the STP path

cost of expensive network segments such as those being charged per
packet, or where the network link does not provide adequate facilities to
support the entire throughput demands.
■
Seamless interoperability LAN segments, servers, and end user work-
stations do not require special conﬁgurations to use bridged networks
implementing STP.
■
Bridging of non-routable protocols Some network protocols are
nonrouting. STP provides a bridged environment supporting these 
protocols.
After the resolution of the Root bridge, STP establishes the hierarchy of the
spanning tree via a series of bridge-to-bridge negotiations.The negotiations iden-
tify the primary interface to be used.Alternate path interfaces are either disabled
or assigned path costs equating to secondary, tertiary, and so on, availability in the
event of a primary link failure. Communications are passed between bridges
using Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs). BPDUs provide information on the

bridge ID, port ID, the Root bridge ID, and the Root path cost.The bridge ID is
determined based on the number of hops from the Root bridge.
When LANs are bridged by more than one bridge to other segments making
up the network, the bridge with the lowest path cost and bridge ID is selected as
the primary bridge and interface.The active loop interface is placed in a state
referred to as forwarding.The remaining bridges supporting the LAN places its
network interface in a blocked state. Blocked state ports respond only to BPDU
packets. Blocked ports can change their state to forwarding in the event of a pri-
mary link failure. Bridge link failures are identiﬁed by other bridges from the lack
of BPDU packet broadcasts from an active loop within the allotted time. In the
event of a Root bridge failure, a new Root bridge is identiﬁed and a new span-
ning tree is established starting from the new Root bridge.
BPDU packets consist of the following ﬁelds:
■
Protocol Identiﬁer Identiﬁes the use of STP.
■
Version Identiﬁes the STP version in use.
■
Message Type Not used.
■
Flag A one-byte ﬁeld that ﬂags the BPDU packet as a Topology
Change (TC) or Topology Change Acknowledgement (TCA).
■
Root ID Lists the Root bridge two-byte priority listing followed by its
six-byte ID.
■
Root Path Cost Identiﬁes the path cost from the bridge originating
the BPDU back to the Root bridge. Root path cost can be tailored.
■
Bridge ID Lists the two-byte priority listing followed by the six-byte
ID of the bridge originating the BPDU.
■
Port ID Identiﬁes the port from which the BPDU was sent. Port IDs
are used to identify multiport loops and facilitates the resolution of
loops.
■
Message Age Speciﬁes the total time since the Root bridge sent the
network conﬁguration BPDU packet from which the current BPDU
packet is based.
■
Maximum Age Speciﬁes a two-byte time value at which time, the
current BPDU should be deleted.
■
Hello Time Identiﬁes the time interval between Root bridge network
conﬁguration messages.
www.syngress.com

272
Chapter 6 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges
■
Forward Delay Identiﬁes the time delay that must elapse before
bridges can change from one state to another when a link becomes dis-
abled.An example would be changing the status of an interface from a
blocked state to a forwarding state. In this scenario, all of the appropriate
bridge interfaces on all affected bridges should be changed at the same
time to prevent partial network connectivity availability during a
changeover.
As we have noted earlier in this chapter, after a bridge establishes a given link,
it learns the MAC addresses of all the devices on each of its segment by analyzing
each of the packets received.The learned MAC address is stored within a
bridging table on the local bridge that identiﬁes the network interface where the
packet was received. Knowledge of this information is used to forward or ﬁlter
packets that are destined to MAC addresses seen on a speciﬁc interface. Over
time, the MAC address table is updated through an aging process.The aging pro-
cess discards MAC addresses that have not been seen over its interfaces over a
given period of time.
www.syngress.com
Enhanced Bridging and Switching Protocols
Recent enhancements in bridging and switching protocols now offer the
possibility to support concurrent loops to create a single logical multi-
link path. In essence, multiple loops are aggregated into a single logical
path providing the full bandwidth of all the links added together. This is
beneﬁcial for environments requiring more bandwidth than is available
in a single link and for environments requiring high availability for each
of its connections.
An example would be that of a bridged WAN link between two sites.
Multiple links may be made available for backup and redundancy. Under
normal bridging rules, only one link would remain active in a forwarding
state while the remaining links would be relegated to a blocked state. The
new protocol enhancements provide a capability to uniquely identify
these aggregated loops and allow for the transmission of trafﬁc over any
one of the segments. The multiloop paths are managed by the protocol to
ensure that one and only one active loop will transmits a given packet.

Initial Setup of the Cisco 
Aironet Wireless Bridge
This section discusses how to conﬁgure the Cisco Aironet wireless bridge using
the command-line interface and the command menu.The initial conﬁguration is
applied upon ﬁrst powerup.You need to conﬁgure the wireless bridge in order to
establish a baseline of operation.You accomplish this by connecting a terminal or
PC using a terminal emulation program to the Console interface.
You can perform the conﬁguration of the wireless bridge directly via the
command-line interface or by using the options menus.
Conﬁguring the Bridge Using 
the Command-Line Interface
The command-line interface provides a means to enter full commands with
options without navigating through the command menus.The command-line
interface is the command prompt displayed below the various menu windows
(see Figure 6.9). Commands are made up by combining various subcommands
available from the command tree structure and appending the value to be set for
that command followed by the Enter key.The command-line commands follow
the same syntax that is provided in the various command menus. Options are also
conﬁgured in the same way as listed in the various command menus. For addi-
tional information on speciﬁc command-line syntax and option conﬁgurations,
refer to the appropriate command menu section in this chapter.
Additionally, you can also use the command-line interface to navigate to sub-
menus by entering the command tree structure syntax that is directed to the
desired command menu.
Conﬁguring the Bridge 
Using the Command Menus
The console option menus are organized via a structure that can be expanded
into further submenus and subcommands. Commands are organized in operations
that conﬁgure the wireless bridge, display information about the settings, display
the statistics of operation, or test the system. Navigation of the menu structure is
accomplished by entering the menu option number associated with the com-
mand to be used or by typing the command at the command prompt located at
the bottom of the screen.To return to the previous menu, press Esc (Escape) on
www.syngress.com

274
Chapter 6 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges
the terminal keyboard.To return to the main menu directly from a lower sub-
menu, press = (equal sign) on the terminal keyboard.
Each of the menus displayed consists of a standard look and feel.At a min-
imum, the following are available:
■
A Title Line is displayed at the top of the screen indicating which menu
is being accessed.
■
An Option Number is listed to the left of the screen for each command
option available in that particular menu.
■
A Value entry is provided for each command indicating either the setting
for that option’s actual value or that the command will drill down to
another submenu Menu.
■
A Description entry provides basic information on the use of the 
command.
■
A command prompt at the bottom of the screen, where operational and
menu navigational commands are entered.
All commands, command-line commands, or menu commands, are acted
upon and saved in ﬂash memory immediately after pressing Enter or by entering
the menu option.Although you don’t need to perform further actions or enter

other commands in order to save a conﬁguration, you can remotely store wireless
bridge conﬁgurations for backup purposes and build version control.This is
referred to as a conﬁguration dump and is covered later in this chapter under the
section titled “Backing Up Wireless Bridge Conﬁgurations.”
Whenever the unit is powered up, the main menu is displayed (see Figure
6.10).The commands displayed are part of the ﬁrst level of the menu structure.
This menu structure is also presented when opening up a new Telnet or Web
conﬁguration session.
General Conﬁguration 
Recommendations and Notes
Note that, for troubleshooting and ease of conﬁguration, you should conﬁgure
wireless bridges while in close proximity to the other wireless network devices
that will share the same SSID.This will facilitate the conﬁguration of network
parameters while ensuring that strong radio signals are present.After you com-
plete the conﬁguration, you can then relocate the wireless bridge to its intended
installation point.
Note that when a Telnet session is active, access to the main menu via the
console port will be temporarily disabled. If a console connection is made while a
Telnet session is active, a message is displayed on the console indicating that a
Telnet operation is in progress and from which IP address.You can disconnect a
Telnet session from the console by pressing the Break key.When you perform a
Telnet session break, the conﬁguration menu is returned to the console interface
control.Take care to verify all active Telnet sessions before forcing a disconnec-
tion. Breaking a session can cause conﬁguration commands to be cut off mid-
stream or in a state of partial conﬁgurations, thereby rendering the operations of
that function or perhaps the entire wireless bridge as inactive or improperly con-
ﬁgured.This can also result in other system errors that could affect the operation
of the wireless network.
Performing the Initial Conﬁguration
This section walks you through the two most critical components to be conﬁg-
ured during initial powerup. Using the console port of the wireless bridge, we do
the following:
■
Assign the Radio parameters
■
Set the root parameters
www.syngress.com

276
Chapter 6 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges
■
Set the SSID
■
Set the data rate
■
Set the distance
■
Assign an IP address
Assigning the Radio Parameters
You must conﬁgure the Radio parameters of the wireless bridge before the wire-
less bridge can communicate with the other wireless network devices. Note that
resetting any of the radio parameters while the wireless bridge is in operation
will force a disconnect of all wireless communications and a reinitialization of the
wireless bridge in question.Active sessions on that bridge will also be terminated
and reinitialized.
Setting the Root Parameters
As discussed earlier, if you use two or more wireless bridges to create a wireless
network, one of the bridges must be set as Root, and the other bridges must be
set as Remote. Cisco Aironet 340 wireless bridges are conﬁgured as Root when
shipped from the factory.
To change the setting on remote bridges, select the Conﬁguration option
from the main menu, then select the Radio option, and lastly select Root.A
prompt will be displayed asking to verify that a change in the Root setting is to
be made.When using the terminal emulator connected to the console port,
pressing Y will toggle the setting from on to off and off to on.
Setting the SSID
The SSID is often referred to as the wireless LAN workgroup number or the
wireless cell number. It is a unique, case-sensitive, and up to 32-characters-long
identiﬁer that is appended to network packets.The SSID deﬁnes the name of the
wireless LAN workgroup and is used to authenticate and establish communica-
tions with other wireless bridges and wireless APs sharing the same SSID.The
wireless bridge discards all transmissions received from wireless devices not
sharing the same SSID.
To conﬁgure the SSID on the new wireless bridge, select the Conﬁguration
option from the main menu, then select the Radio option, and lastly select
SSID.At the prompt, enter the SSID that is to be associated with this wireless
www.syngress.com

Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges • Chapter 6
277
bridge.The SSID must be the same for all wireless network devices that you
intend to include within the same wireless network.
Setting the Data Rate
The Data Rate conﬁguration deﬁnes the minimum rate at which data will be
transmitted between itself and other wireless network devices such as other
bridges and APs.Wireless devices within the wireless workgroup can transmit
data to the wireless bridge at the minimum rate or at any other available rate.
Generally speaking, when a wireless bridge communicates with a Root bridge,
the rate used to communicate is the highest rate supported by both units and
supported by the media/environment at that time.
To conﬁgure the data rate on the wireless bridge, select the Conﬁguration
option from the main menu, then select the Radio option, and lastly select
Rates.At the prompt, enter the value for the rates. Be sure to select more than
one rate, so as to provide fail-safe supporting communications when the media/
environment changes due to weather, construction, or other potential interfer-
ence. If you select only one rate and cannot maintain it, wireless communications
will be terminated.
Setting the Distance
The travel distance of wireless signals between wireless bridges can be as short as
a few meter (10 feet or less), as in the case of bridging between the ﬂoors of a
building, or as far away as 40 kilometers (25 miles) when creating a large bridged
wireless LAN between segments located in different buildings. The propagation
delay of the radio signals can cause a transmitting bridge to assume that a com-
munication never reached its intended recipient.To counter this scenario, the
Root Node wireless bridge is conﬁgured with a distance parameter that adjusts
system timers responsible for network and transmission control on all of the
Remote Nodes under its control.
To conﬁgure the distance parameter on the wireless bridge, select the
Conﬁguration option from the main menu, then select the Radio option, and
lastly select Distance.At the prompt, enter the longest expected radio link in
terms of kilometers—not miles.
Assigning IP Information
The IP information is used to establish the network address of the wireless
bridge.This address is used to remotely communicate with the wireless bridge
www.syngress.com

278
Chapter 6 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges
using Telnet, HTTP, and SNMP.Although you can conﬁgure other IP informa-
tion to speciﬁcally tailor the operation of the wireless bridge, this section covers
only the basic conﬁguration required to support Telnet and HTTP remote man-
agement sessions.Additional conﬁguration options are discussed later in this
chapter.
To conﬁgure the IP address and other related settings, select the
Conﬁguration option from the main menu, then select Ident. Use the Inaddr
option to assign the IP address of the wireless bridge. Use the Inimask option to
conﬁgure the network subnet mask. Use the Gateway option to conﬁgure the
gateway address.
Some network conﬁgurations will require one or more of these IP address
conﬁguration ﬁelds to be deﬁned. Please refer to your network administrator for
the network conﬁguration information speciﬁc to your wireless network envi-
ronment.
After you enter the IP information, you can establish communications with the
wireless bridge by using Telnet and HTTP, as shown in the following sections.
Establishing Communications Using Remote Telnet Access
The menu style and options presented during a Telnet session will be similar 
to the ones presented during conﬁguration sessions established from the console.
Command menu navigation is similar to console-based command menu 
navigation.
To access the conﬁguration menu from the command prompt of a PC or
workstation, enter the following:
telnet <IP address of the bridge>
Establishing Communications Using Remote Web Browser Access
Although the menu style presented during a Web browser session will be dif-
ferent from the one presented during a Telnet or console session, the options pre-
sented under each menu will be similar. Each of the menu pages contain links to
command options.
To select a menu option, bring the mouse pointer to the option and click. By
default, submenus are not active in terms of conﬁguration, that is, to change any
displayed parameter, you must click Allow Conﬁg Changes ﬁrst.As mentioned
earlier, conﬁguration changes take effect immediately.As a precaution, click the
Disallow Conﬁg Changes once conﬁguration changes have been completed to
prevent accidental reconﬁgurations of the wireless bridge.

Operational Conﬁguration of 
the Cisco Aironet Wireless Bridge
After you deﬁne the initial conﬁguration , the wireless bridge will have the capa-
bility to establish elementary wireless communications with other Cisco bridges
and APs. In order to support additional networking and security requirements,
you may need to deﬁne advanced bridge conﬁguration options.
Using only the network capabilities that were conﬁgured on the bridge
during the initial setup, administrators can now access the bridge via one of three
types of connections:
■
Console
■
Telnet
■
Web browser
Console Access
You can establish console access by connecting a terminal or a PC running a ter-
minal emulation program to the console port on the wireless bridge.The menus
displayed are in the same format as those displayed during a Telnet session (refer
to Figure 6.9).
Telnet Access
You can establish Telnet access by initiating a Telnet session with the wireless
bridge by using the bridge’s IP address. (for example,Telnet 10.15.22.11, where
10.15.22.11 is the address of the wireless bridge).The menus displayed are in the
same format as those displayed during a console session (refer to Figure 6.9).

Chapter 6 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges
Web Browser Access
You can establish Web browser access by initiating a Web session with the wireless
bridge by using the bridge’s IP address. (for example, http://10.15.22.11, where
10.15.22.11 is the address of the wireless bridge).The top of each Web page pro-
vides links to submenu pages.The menu option displayed in each of the sub-
menus is similar to those displayed during console and Telnet session.The
formatting of information is provided within the main body of the Web page
instead of posting using a new screen (see Figure 6.10).
NOTE
Examples and screenshots presented for the remainder of the chapter
use the command-line menu format.
You can access advanced conﬁguration options from the wireless bridge main
menu by selecting Conﬁguration.
The Conﬁguration menu provides the submenus indicated in Figure 6.11. In
this section, we discuss each of the Conﬁguration menu submenus along with
each of the related parameters.

Chapter 6 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges
NOTE
Several of the options were discussed within the “Performing the Initial
Conﬁguration” section earlier in this chapter. These included SSID, root,
rates, and distance. They are not repeated here.
Conﬁguring the Basic Rates Option
The Basic_rates option (Radio menu option 4) is conﬁgured on the Root Node
bridge only and establishes the various supported rates within the wireless net-
work. Normal data communications trafﬁc will be transmitted as the highest sus-
tainable rate available; network control packets, broadcast packets, and multicast
packets are transmitted at the lowest transmission rate.
Conﬁguring the Frequency Option
You may conﬁgure the Frequency option (Radio menu option 5) on the Root
Node bridge only, and it is subject to radio regulations. By default, this option is
conﬁgured for “auto” and as such supports all of the frequencies available within
the local market radio jurisdiction.When initialized, the Root Node bridge will
assess the frequencies available and will select an appropriate frequency. In gen-
eral, you should leave this option at the default value, but you may change it to
address environmental interference within a speciﬁc frequency.
Conﬁguring the IEEE 802.11 Options
The IEEE80211 options (Radio menu option 7) menu provides conﬁguration
options over the radio protocols, power save, and other radio node management
functions (see Figure 6.13).The Default settings for these options are typically
appropriate for most environments.

Conﬁguring the Beacon Period Option
You can use the Beacon option (IEEE 802.11 menu option 1) to conﬁgure the
interval time between the broadcast of beacon packets over the network. Beacon
packets are like a pulse and are used to synchronize the wireless network and the
wireless nodes.While the default is generally appropriate for most environments,
you can use shorter beacon interval times to increase response times of devices.
Conﬁguring the Dtim Interval
The Dtim interval option (IEEE 802.11 menu option 1) is used to conﬁgure the
Delivery Trafﬁc Indicator Map settings.The 802.11 general MAC layer provides
power saving features using Trafﬁc Indicator Map (TIM) and Delivery Trafﬁc
Indicator Map (DTIM) “beacons”. Use of TIMs and DTIMs can greatly increase
the effectiveness of wireless LAN deployments using laptops. Power management
can save laptop battery life and therefore extend duration of network function-
ality when operating without a connection to an A/C power outlet.
TIMs are sent periodically by a wireless AP or bridge.TIMs provide a listing
of the identity of other wireless nodes with pending have trafﬁc pending.Wireless
NIC cards within the wireless node are set at a minimum, conﬁgured to wake
upon receiving at TIM.
DTIMs are similar to TIM s but with have broad-/multicast trafﬁc indication.
DTIMs are sent at lower frequency than TIMs, such as 1 DTIM every 5 TIMs.
The recommended power wake setting for NIC cards is at every DTIM.You can
also use other user-deﬁned or adaptive wake settings (see Figure 6.14).
The Cisco Aironet 340 wireless bridge provides a facility to conﬁgure the
interval using the Dtim menu option.
Conﬁguring the Network Management Extension Option
The Network Management Extension option (IEEE 802.11 menu option 3) pro-
vides for the communication of additional Cisco speciﬁc node and network man-
agement information within the management packets sent over the network.

These include enhanced bridge afﬁliations and communications path manage-
ment.Although most non-Cisco products generally ignore this additional infor-
mation, some products may attempt to interpret these extensions, causing errors.
In these cases, disable this option by setting it to “off.”

The broadcast SSID (IEEE 802.11 menu option 4), also referred to as no-SSID or
empty SSID, is used as a default means or last resort for establishing communica-
tions over a wireless network.This option allows for the conﬁguration of bridges to
support or disallow communications using the broadcast SSID. For security reasons,
you should deﬁne a SSID for the wireless network, and all clients should be
required to use the appropriate SSID when communicating over the network.As
such, this option should generally be disabled by setting it to “off”.
Conﬁguring the Request to Send/Clear to Send Option
You can use the RTS/CTS option (IEEE 802.11 menu option 5) to establish a
formal communications channel between nodes for the transmission of packets
meeting a size threshold. In essence, it is a means of preventing collisions and
ensuring that the broadcast medium is used as effectively as possible.When a node
is ready to send a packet meeting the predetermined size threshold, the wireless
bridge sends a small Request to Send packet over the network in order to obtain a

clear channel.The receiving node sends out a small Clear to Send packet over the
network, thereby declaring a quiet period from all the other nodes.The transmit-
ting node sends the packet and the network becomes available again.
This is effective in larger dispersed networks where wireless bridges may be
several radio hops away from a transmitting bridge or where a bridge may not be
within immediate radio range of another transmitting bridge (see Figure 6.15).
You can conﬁgure the option for packets ranging from 100–2,048 bytes.Take
care to understand the types and volumes of packet data being transmitted on a
regular basis in order to assess which setting is most appropriate for the given
environment.Also note that the lower the packet size threshold setting, the
greater the amount of RTS/CTS packets will be sent over the network.This will
result in lowered network availability for the transmission of actual data packets.

Conﬁguring the Privacy Option
You can use the Privacy option (IEEE 802.11 menu option 6) to establish an
encrypted communications channel between the wireless devices that make up
the network (see Figure 6.16).
Figure 6.16 Privacy Options Menu

■
Encryption option (Privacy menu option 1)  By default, this
option is conﬁgured to “off” and communications are not encrypted
between wireless bridges.When enabled, by changing the setting to the
“on” position, communications links are encrypted using the RSA RC4
symmetric encryption algorithm.A symmetric algorithm is an algorithm
in which the secret key that is used to encrypt the data is also used to
decrypt the data.This implies that the key installed must be the same on
all wireless nodes wishing to communicate using an encrypted channel.
As a result, key updates must be performed on all nodes as the same time
for encrypted communications to remain available.
Note that when set to “on,” a node will participate only in commu-
nications on an encrypted channel and will discard any received packets
that are not encrypted.You can conﬁgure the wireless bridge to support
an environment supporting both encrypted and unencrypted communi-
cations by selecting the “mixed” setting. From a security perspective, the
mixed setting is not recommended because rogue nodes can capture
both encrypted and unencrypted packets and perform cryptanalysis
operations to determine the secret keys in use.
■
Authentication Mode option (Privacy menu option 2)  This
option speciﬁes the type of authentication that is to be used by wireless
Remote Node bridges to authenticate to the Root Node wireless
www.syngress.com

Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges • Chapter 6
287
bridge.Two modes are available: open and shared key.The open mode
allows any Remote Nodes to authenticate to the Root Node.The
shared key mode uses a challenge response token to verify that the
Remote Node is to be allowed into the network.The challenge consists
of the Root Node sending a data token to the Remote Node and
requesting it be encrypted and returned back to the Root Node. If
decryption is successful, it is deemed that the Remote Node is a valid
Remote Node allowed to participate on the wireless network. It is
plainly assumed that the client obtained the keys via proper channels and
is not a rogue unit.
■
Client option (Privacy menu option 3)  This option is similar to
Authentication Mode option in that it is used for authentication pur-
posed and it uses the “open,”“shared-key,” and “both” options. It is used
only by wireless bridges that have also been conﬁgured to operate as
wireless APs.When operating in this mode, it speciﬁes the authentication
to be used by client nodes wishing to associate with a wireless bridge.
■
Key option (Privacy menu option 4)  The Cisco Aironet 340 wire-
less bridge, supports up to four programmed keys in each device. One of
the keys is used at any given time to set up the encrypted session. Each
of the four keys must be known to all devices sharing in the communi-
cations to ensure that data can be encrypted and decrypted by all nodes.
Note that the four keys must also be entered in the same order on each
of the wireless devices.
To enter a key, select the Key option.A prompt will be displayed
requesting the input of the key string. Key strings are made up of 10
hexadecimal characters for 40-bit keys and 26 hexadecimal characters for
128-bit keys. Key entry is repeated twice for each inputted key to guard
against mistyped characters.
■
Transmit option (Privacy menu option 5)  Once the keys are
entered, select the [TRANSMIT] option and select the desired key.You
don’t need to conﬁgure any “receive” option because knowledge of the
key is all that is required from the receiving station to decrypt messages.
Conﬁguring the Packet Encapsulation Option
Although in general, Cisco Aironet wireless bridges do not interoperate with
other wireless networking equipment from other vendors out of the box, you
www.syngress.com

288
Chapter 6 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges
can, under certain circumstances, modify the signaling and packet assembly of the
Cisco Aironet Bridge to support basic transmissions.You can accomplish this by
using the Packet Encapsulation option (IEEE 802.11 menu option 7).
In order for communications to successfully take place between equipment
from different wireless vendors, you need to have an understanding of the
vendor-speciﬁc packet encapsulation protocol being used.The encapsulation table
is used to conﬁgure the speciﬁc packet build settings meeting the communica-
tions requirements.This is an advanced function and you should thoroughly
investigate and test conﬁguration options prior to deployment.
When conﬁguring a Cisco Aironet 340–only network, you can ignore these
options and leave them to their default value of 802.1H.
Conﬁguring the LinkTests Options
The LinkTests menu options (Radio menu option 8) are discussed in the
Troubleshooting section later in this chapter.
Conﬁguring the Extended Options
The Extended options (Radio menu option 9) provide access to the various
radio parameters that may be modiﬁed under certain circumstances (see Figure
6.17). Generally speaking, you should leave these options at their default settings
unless environmental conditions or other network factors are causing faults
within the network.The default options listed are reﬂective of the type of appli-
cation the wireless unit is called to serve.

■
Bridge Mode option (Radio Extended menu option 1)  This
option establishes which types of communications will be supported by
the wireless node. In “bridge_only” mode, wireless bridges will be the
only type of unit allowed to communicate with this node. In
“access_point” mode, any and all wireless devices, including wireless
bridges and wireless nodes, will be allowed to communicate with this
node.“Client” mode, will cause this unit to act as a standalone radio
repeater and will not have any communications with other units.
■
Parentid option (Radio Extended menu option 2)  When wireless
nodes are activated, they engage into a listening mode where they auto-
matically determine a parent with which it will communicate.This is
part of the hierarchy or network tree that deﬁnes the network architec-
ture.Although this is an automatic process, circumstances may exist
where a wireless bridge that has been conﬁgured as “client,” should be
assigned a speciﬁc parent.This option allows for the manual deﬁnition of
a parent node on these bridges.
■
Parent Timeout option (Radio Extended menu option 3)  This
option is used to conﬁgure the timeout period to be elapsed when com-
munications with a parent is not available, before determining another
parent. By conﬁguring this option to the “off” setting, the wireless bridge
will communicate only with its associated parent and will never attempt
to deﬁne an alternate parent. Once the communications are re-established
with the parent, the wireless bridge re-associates itself to its parent.
■
Time Retry option (Radio Extended menu option 4)  This
option is used to deﬁne parameters affecting the retry timers of the
transmitters. It is used in concurrence with the Count Retry option. If a
packet cannot be transmitted to the intended recipient bridge, parent or
child, within the speciﬁed time a new association may be established. In
the case of the time retry counter exceeding the allowed retry time for a
parent bridge, a new parent bridge will be determined. In the case of the
www.syngress.com
Figure 6.17 Continued

Chapter 6 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges
time retry counter exceeding the allowed retry time for a child bridge,
the parent/child bridge relationship will be dissolved.
You can conﬁgure the Time Retry counter from 1 second to 
30 seconds.
■
Count Retry option (Radio Extended menu option 5)  This
option is used to deﬁne parameters affecting the retry counters of the
transmitters. It is used in concurrence with the Count Retry Option. If
a packet cannot be transmitted to the intended recipient bridge, parent
or child, within the speciﬁed retry count a new association may be
established. In the case of the retry counter exceeding the allowed retry
count for a parent bridge, a new parent bridge will be determined. In
the case of the retry counter exceeding the allowed retry count for a
child bridge, the parent/child bridge relationship will be dissolved.
You can conﬁgure the Count Retry counter from 0 tries to 64 tries.
A setting of 0 disables the Count Retry option. In this case, only the
Time Retry option is active.
■
Refresh option (Radio Extended menu option 6)  The Refresh
option is available on bridges operating as repeater bridges.You can view
it as a keep-alive option that ensures long periods of inactive communi-
cations with a parent are not the result of a loss in communication. In
essence, after a period of inactivity, the repeater bridge sends an empty
packet to the parent that is acknowledged by the parent.The Refresh
association interval is deﬁned in tenths of a second.
■
Roaming option (Radio Extended menu option 7)  The
Roaming Notiﬁcation Mode is used in scenarios where an associated
wireless node has the capability to roam within an environment and as
such re-associate itself to a new parent node.When this re-association
occurs, the parent forwards a notiﬁcation to the other wireless bridges
informing them of the new relationship.
When conﬁgured in “directed” mode, the bridge will interrogate the
new child and will attempt to determine the roaming node’s previous
parent. Once this has been determined, a packet is sent to the previous
parent announcing a change in afﬁliations.
Although “directed” mode generally works for most networks, cir-
cumstances may exist where it is more effective to broadcast the afﬁlia-
tion change to any and all wireless network devices.To activate the
general broadcast, set the Roaming option to “broadcast”.

■
Balance option (Radio Extended menu option 8)  The Load
Balancing option is used by Root Node bridges in conjunction with the
i80211 Extend options (Cisco-speciﬁc network management and control
options—see Extended Options earlier in this section) to communicate
load balancing conﬁgurations.The load balancing algorithm is used to
balance the parent/child associations between different Remote Nodes
based on trafﬁc loads, number of existing associations and other parame-
ters.You can conﬁgure this option to “off,”“slow,” or “fast”.The “slow”
option executes the load balancing algorithm and association assessment
every 30 seconds, whereas the fast” setting executes every 4 seconds.
■
Diversity option (Radio Extended menu option 9)  The diversity
option is used to inform the wireless bridge of the presence of two
antennas instead of one.When the option is set to “off,” the wireless
bridge operates as if a single antenna is present in the right antenna con-
nector on the back of the bridge.When set to “on,” the wireless bridge
is told that two antennas are present.
■
Power option (Radio Extended menu option 01)  The Power
Level option is used to reduce the broadcast power of radio transmitter
from full power down to 100 milliwatts or 50 milliwatts. In general, the
default setting is appropriate for most operations but can be reduced if
interference is caused within other devices.
■
Fragment option (Radio Extended menu option 02)  The
Fragment Size option is used to determine the largest packet size
allowed to be transmitted. Packets exceeding this size limit are rear-
ranged into smaller packets meeting the size restrictions.You can con-
ﬁgure the maximum fragment size for values ranging from 256 bytes to
2,048 bytes.
■
Options option (Radio Extended menu option 03)  The Options
option is used to activate additional wireless bridge peripheral acces-
sories, which are obtained separately. For information on these options,
refer to Chapter 9.

Conﬁguring the Ethernet Port
The Cisco Aironet wireless bridge provides an Ethernet port that can be used to
connect an Ethernet LAN.The Ethernet port conﬁgurations are deﬁned using
the Ethernet menu option (Conﬁguration menu option 2). See Figure 6.18.

3 – Port     [ auto ]       Port selection
Enter an option number or name, "=" main menu, <ESC> previous menu
■
Active option (Ethernet Conﬁguration menu option 1)  The
Active option is used to enable or disable the Ethernet port on the back
of the wireless bridge.The default setting is “on.”When installing a wire-
less bridge as a repeater only or in a conﬁguration where the Ethernet
port is not intended to be used, set the setting to “off.” Setting the
Active option to “off” disables all bridge activity from that port, low-
ering the overall processor load.
■
Size option (Ethernet Conﬁguration menu option 2)  The max-
imum frame size option can be used to extent the maximum frame size
limit from 1,518 bytes to 4,096. Don’t use this option unless operating an
application requiring this change. Reconﬁguring this option will require a
manual reboot of the wireless bridge before settings become active.
■
Port option (Ethernet Conﬁguration menu option 3)  This
option speciﬁes which Ethernet port is to be used.The “auto” setting
uses an active scan to determine the active port. If the port is connected
to an Ethernet card that is conﬁgured to perform this scan, use the
manual port deﬁnition setting to activate a speciﬁc port.
Conﬁguring the Network Identiﬁers
Network identiﬁers are used to deﬁne network address parameters, network ser-
vice, and other related conﬁgurations (see Figure 6.19).The network identiﬁers
are conﬁgured using Ident menu options (Conﬁguration menu option 3) In

Inaddr, Inmask, and Gateway (Ident menu options 1,2, and 3)
These settings were discussed in the initial installation section and relate
to the conﬁguration of the IP address of the wireless bridge, the network
subnet mask, and the predeﬁned network gateway.
■
Routing option (Ident menu option 4)  The routing menu conﬁg-
uration deﬁnes how IP packets will be routed and forwarded.
■
DNS option (Ident menu options 5, 6, and 7)  The Domain Name
Server conﬁguration option provides an input parameter for two DNS
addresses.You can obtain them from the local network administrator.
www.syngress.com

294
Chapter 6 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges
■
Name option (Ident menu option 8)  This options provide a string
input parameter of up to 20 characters in length giving the wireless
bridge an identity name.This name appears on all console port menus
and is used to identify the wireless bridge to all of the members of the
wireless network.
■
Location and Contact (Ident menu option 9 and 01)  These
options provide a ﬁeld to input of up to 20 characters per ﬁeld of wire-
less bridge manager contact information.This information is read by
SNMP management workstations.
■
Bootp_DHCP and Class Option (Ident menu option 02 and 03)
This option, set to the default “on” conﬁguration allows the wireless
bridge to request an IP address from a DHCP server or from a BOOTP
service.The Class option deﬁnes the class of DHCP option.
Console Management Access
Access to the console and remote management features (Conﬁguration menu
option 4) can be managed through the use of tables containing user privileges
and credentials information.When tables are in use, users who are authorized can
access the wireless bridge conﬁgurations options and services to which they are
cleared for, including Telnet, HTTP, FTP, SNMP, and TFTP, among others. Non-
authorized users are denied access.
You can deﬁne and manage users through an IP address or a MAC address
listing.You can create and maintain listings using the “Add,”“Remove,” and
“Display” menu options.To prevent any form of remote access, you need to set the
Remote menu option to “off.”When the Remote menu option is set to “on,” and
no entries are made within the right management tables, privileges are deemed to
be universally available, that is any user at any location can access the console.
Conﬁguring Passwords
To conﬁgure a password for a selected privilege, select the Conﬁguration option
from the main menu then select Console.The two deﬁned privileges are
■
RPassword
■
WPassword
Select the privilege for which a password is to be applied.To enter no password,
type none.To conﬁgure a password, enter a character string of at least 5 characters
www.syngress.com

Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges • Chapter 6
295
but less than 10 characters. Passwords are case-sensitive.A prompt will ask for a
conﬁrmation of the password.To conﬁrm a password, enter the chosen password
a second time.After you set the password, the system will monitor for incorrect
logins. Failing to enter the correct password at the prompt three consecutive
times will cause the wireless bridge to drop the connection.A log entry records
the failed login attempts.
SECURITY ALERT!
Note that passwords can be changed provided the active password is
known. Passwords cannot be changed or reset if forgotten! In the event
that a password is forgotten, the unit requiring a password reset will
need to be returned to Cisco for maintenance.
Conﬁguring Privileges
Note that privileges are conﬁgured directly from the main menu by selecting the
Privilege option (main menu option 7). Users navigating from a high privilege
level to a lower privilege level are not required to re-authenticate. Users navi-
gating from a low privilege level to a higher privilege level must re-authenticate
using valid credentials for that level.Three privilege levels are available:
■
Off privilege This option provides the access level available when a
user is logged off.With this conﬁguration enabled, they are able to view
the “privilege” and “help” entries of the main menu.You cannot pass-
word protect this privilege level.
■
ReadOnly privilege This option provides read-only access to all sub-
menu command options that display conﬁguration, statistics, and other
operational commands. Commands that can modify conﬁgurations are
not available for use.You can password protect this privilege level.
■
Write privilege This option provides read/write access to all available
menus and options.You can password protect this privilege level.
SNMP Support

conﬁgurations can be very involved in that information can be remotely obtained
from and conﬁgured for well over a hundred different variables on the Cisco
Aironet 340 wireless bridge.
This brief discussion provides basic conﬁguration instructions that can be
used to enable SNMP services on the wireless bridge. For NMS conﬁgurations
and a listing to the available variable, please consult the Cisco documentation.
To conﬁgure SNMP, select the Conﬁguration option from the main menu,
then select Console, and lastly select Communities.
■
Adding an SNMP Community To add an SNMP community on
the wireless bridge, select the “add” menu option from the Communities
menu.Available options include “Read Only Access,”“Any NMS IP
Address,” and “Any NID.”
■
Conﬁguring SNMP Community Access To conﬁgure speciﬁc
access rights and privileges to an SNMP community, select the “access”
menu option from the Communities menu and then select the appro-
priate option:“read” or “write.”The “read” option supports gets and get-
nexts SNMP requests from readable variables.The “write” options
supports set, gets, and get-nexts on all available variables.
The default conﬁguration is for all SNMP communities to have
“read” access only.
■
Displaying SNMP Communities To display a SNMP community on
the wireless bridge, select the “display” menu option from the
Communities menu.The display will consist of the SNMP community
name, access mode, NMS IP address, and NMS Node ID.
■
Removing an SNMP Community To Remove an SNMP commu-
nity on the wireless bridge, select the “remove” menu option from the
Communities menu and enter the name of the community to be
removed.
Conﬁguring the Time Service
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) (Conﬁguration menu option 7) can be used
to synchronize networked equipment.The Cisco Aironet wireless bridge allows
for the speciﬁcation of a time server and conﬁguration of related parameters (see
Figure 6.20).

Setting Up Association Tables
Association tables are used to deﬁne and manage the parent/child relationship
between Cisco Aironet wireless bridges and end node address information to per-
form trafﬁc routing, load balancing, and other management functions.Wireless
bridges acting as parents, can manage up to 2,048 subordinate entries. Entry
information provides details on the child node and client name, address, device,
and association type.You can manually edit table entries in order to map out a
predetermined wireless network tree.
A good example of the application of association tables is in the determina-
tion of trafﬁc routing over the wireless network. Using tables, a wireless bridge
can be made aware of the Root Node bridge, Remote bridges, and dedicated
repeaters. It can be aware of its parent and any child relationship other wireless
nodes will have with it.Table entries may also exist for end stations connected via
its own Ethernet port and those of other remote wireless bridges.

Chapter 6 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges
When a wireless bridge is handed a packet originating from its Ethernet
interface or via the radio transmitter, it attempts to determine the destination of
the packet. If the destination address is located on its own Ethernet interface, it
will forward the packet directly. If the destination address is located on the Root
Bridge, child bridge, or an associated dedicated repeater, the wireless bridge for-
ward the packet directly. If the location of the destination address is not known,
the wireless bridge will forward the packet to the Root Bridge for further trans-
mission over the LAN connection it has with the main LAN, and to all associated
parent bridges.

Summary option The Display Association Table Summary provides an
abbreviated listing of direct and indirect associations for the wireless
bridge.
■
Maximum option The maximum allowed number of child nodes
option provides a means to manually deﬁne the maximum number of
child nodes that can be associated with the wireless bridge.
■
Autoassoc option The auto association option enables the automatic
association of parent/child relationships and maintenance of association
lists on the wireless bridge. By default, the “on” setting conﬁgures the
wireless bridge to allow any wireless device requesting an association to
receive one.The “off” setting forces the veriﬁcation of nodes against the
predeﬁned static association list.
■
Add option The manually add association option provides a means for
administrators to manually add addresses to the association list.This is
useful in establishing an enhanced security policy where only predeﬁned
nodes are given the right to associate with a wireless bridge. It is also
useful in deﬁning an association tree and limiting access to services by
speciﬁc nodes.
■
Staletime option The backbone LAN node stale out time is used
within the association table of devices located on Ethernet LAN inter-
face.As a new address is added to the association table, a last seen
counter is started and reset every time a packet originating from that
address is received on the Ethernet LAN interface.
■
NIDdisp option The Node Address Display option is used to deﬁne
the display characteristics when displaying association table information.
Options can consist of “numeric” and “name.”The default “numeric”
option displays the association table information in numeric format only.

The “name” option provides a means for the wireless bridge to display
association table information based on the Organizational Unique
Identiﬁer.
Using Filters
Wireless network ﬁlters are used to manage and minimize wireless trafﬁc based on
predeﬁned trafﬁc types.They can be applied to Ethernet LAN originating trafﬁc
(to_radio option) or to both Ethernet LAN originating trafﬁc and wireless network
originating trafﬁc (both option).As such, you can use ﬁlters to block certain types
of packets and can reduce the amount unnecessary wireless transmissions.
When properly conﬁgured, ﬁltering can extend the life of battery-operated
wireless nodes by providing a means to ensure that all communications sent over
the radio transmitter are genuinely required.You should conﬁgure all wireless
bridges with the same ﬁlter sets to ensure a uniform management of all trafﬁc
types over the entire wireless network.
To conﬁgure the wireless bridge ﬁlters, select the Filter option (main menu
option 4) from the main menu (see Figure 6.22).

Conﬁguring the Multicast Option
The Multicast option provides a submenu where you can deﬁne and manage
multicast ﬁlters for each multicast address:
■
Default option The Default option establishes the ﬁltering to be applied
to multicast trafﬁc not originating from a deﬁned multicast address.
■
The “discard” option discards all multicast trafﬁc not originating
from a known address.
www.syngress.com

Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges • Chapter 6

■
The “forward” option conﬁgures the wireless bridge to forward mul-
ticast trafﬁc from unknown multicast addresses out onto the wireless
network.
■
The “accesspt” option conﬁgures the wireless bridge to forward mul-
ticast trafﬁc from unknown multicast addresses to APs and wireless
bridges only.
■
The “nonsps” option conﬁgures the wireless bridge to forward mul-
ticast trafﬁc from unknown multicast addresses to wireless devices
that do not operate in power saving mode.
■
Show option The display ﬁlters show option displays the deﬁned mul-
ticast ﬁlters.
■
Add and Remove options The Add and Remove options are used to
deﬁne and remove multicast ﬁlters to multicast addresses.Adding a mul-
ticast consists of entering a multicast address and deﬁning the type of
action to be performed when a multicast packet is received. Removing a
multicast ﬁlter consists of specifying which multicast address is to be
removed. Once removed, the default actions speciﬁed for unknown mul-
ticast addresses will be applied to this address.
■
Radio_Mcast option The Radio multicast ﬁlter option provides 
a means of managing multicast addresses received from the wireless 
network.
Conﬁguring the Node Option
The ﬁltering node address option provides a means of ﬁltering packets based on
source node addresses.You can deﬁne default actions for addresses not contained
within the table.You can populate the node address ﬁlters by using the IP address
of the node in question (see Figure 6.23).

■
Ethdst option The Ethernet destination address establishes the default
actions to be performed on packets originating from the Ethernet LAN
interface of the wireless bridge.
■
Raddst option The Radio destination address establishes the default
actions to be performed on packets originating from the wireless net-
work interface of the wireless bridge.
■
Source option The default source option is conﬁgured to the “off”
setting by default, meaning that packet ﬁltering is not active on source
addresses.Valid settings for this option include “off,”“forward,” and 
“discard.”
■
Add and Remove option The Add and Remove options are used to
deﬁne and remove ﬁlters to originating addresses.Adding an originating
address consists of entering an address and deﬁning the type of action to
be performed when a packet is received from that address. Removing an
originating address ﬁlter consists of specifying which address is to be
removed. Once removed, the default actions speciﬁed for unknown
addresses will be applied to this address.
■
Display option The display node address ﬁlters is used to display the
node address ﬁlter table entries.The display is similar to the association
display.The display provides the source address, the ﬁlter to be applied
and other related information regarding the node.
Conﬁguring the Protocols Option
The ﬁltering protocol option provides a means of ﬁltering packets based on the
encapsulation protocol used to wrap the packet.You can deﬁne default actions for
protocols not deﬁned within the table. Protocol ﬁltering can minimize the trans-
mission of protocol packets that are not used on remote wireless LAN segments.
Options are similar to multicast and source address ﬁlters.Applying protocol ﬁl-
ters can be a complex proposition and is outside of the scope of this chapter.

cator LED to turn amber through this option.You can specify severe
errors, all errors, and logging off to trigger the LED.
■
Statistics options The statistics parameter conﬁguration deﬁnes how
and when alarm conditions are to be triggered based on the wireless
bridge statistics.You can generate logs when statistics change more
quickly than speciﬁed or upon any changes within statistics, or you can
disable them entirely.
■
Network option Although the wireless bridge logs the roaming of
clients to and from its domain, the log network roaming option provides
a means to log to register the movement of wireless nodes between
other bridges.
■
BnodeLog option Although the wireless bridge logs all changes of
clients from its own domain, the log backbone option provides a means
to log changes to the backbone.
■

Chapter 6 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges
Network Menu Option
The Network options submenu provides network-based troubleshooting and
support tools.Tools include a facility to establish a Telnet session, ping, and ﬁnd a
wireless bridge.
Connect Option
This option is used to start a Telnet session with another remote wireless bridge
located on the wireless network. It is used to remotely access the console menu
on the remote wireless bridge in order to remotely support troubleshooting and
conﬁguration operations.
You can establish the Telnet connection by using the remote wireless bridge’s
IP address or in some cases MAC address provided the remote wireless bridge is
located on the same bridged wireless LAN.You must enable Telnet on the remote
wireless bridge for the connection to be established.
As we mentioned earlier, note that when a Telnet session is active, access to
the main menu via the console port will be temporarily disabled.This means that if
an administrator attempts to initiate a console session with the wireless bridge
while the Telnet session is active, a message will be displayed indicating that a
Telnet session is currently active and from which IP address it is originating.You
can interrupt the Telnet session from the console by pressing the Break key.
Once the Telnet session is terminated, management control of the wireless bridge
is returned to the console.
Before interrupting any active Telnet sessions, you should communicate with
the user originating the session to ensure that commands are not terminated
midstream or in a state of partial conﬁguration.A possibility exists that commands
that have not been completed could result in wireless bridge errors or errors in
the operation of the wireless network.
To close a remote wireless bridge Telnet session for the local wireless bridge
when conﬁguration and troubleshooting is completed, enter the Telnet escape
sequence. By default the escape sequence is conﬁgured for Ctrl+Z, but you can
change it using the Escape menu.
Escape Option
The escape menu option provides a means to reconﬁgure the Telnet escape
sequence from the default Ctrl+Z to another deﬁned string up to 10 characters
in length. Generally this is required only if the default escape character has an
alternate meaning on the host.To enter nonprintable characters, use the following:
www.syngress.com

Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges • Chapter 6
311
■
To enter an escape sequence using the Ctrl key, enter the caret (^) char-
acter. Example: Enter Ctrl+Z as ^z.
■
To enter an escape character using a three-digit octal character number,
precede the entry with a back slash. Example: \021.
■
To enter an escape character using a two-digit hexadecimal number, pre-
cede the entry with a string. Example: $4F.
Find Option
In locations where several bridges are co-located or in poorly lit locations where
it may be difﬁcult to visually identify a wireless bridge, you can use the Find
option to trigger the blinking of the amber LED indicators on the remote
bridge.Telnet to the desired remote wireless bridge and select the Find option.
Once you locate the bridge, disengage the ﬁnd setting by pressing Ctrl+C.
Ping Option
You can use the ping option to verify connectivity between wireless bridges and
other network devices.A standard ICMP echo request packet is sent to the
remote node every 3 seconds until a reply is received or until 5 ICMP echo
request packets have been sent.To stop the ping command, press Ctrl+C.
Linktest Menu Options
The linktest menu option is used to verify the operational quality of the wireless
network.To use the wireless bridge linkstate functions, select the Linktest option
from the Diagnostics menu. See Figure 6.27 for the Linkstest Menu, then read
on for a description of each option.

Enter an option number or name, "=" main menu, <ESC> previous menu
The ﬁrst option is the Strength option.You can use the signal strength test to
verify the carrier signal strength between nodes.The wireless bridge sends an
echo request to its parent and to each of the wireless nodes listed in the associa-
tion tables every second.An assessment of the overall signal strength is listed for
each node.The signal strength option is useful for testing the initial installation
and location of wireless bridges, antennas, and optional equipment.
Next is the Carrier option.The carrier busy test option is used to determine
the overall level of activity present and overall availability for each available fre-
quency.You can use it to help determine which frequency is most appropriate for
the intended wireless network, and you can also use it to investigate the presence
of radio signaling and jamming equipment.When a wireless bridge is performing
a carrier busy test, it does not perform any of the normal wireless bridge opera-
tions, and as a result, all associations and communications will be dropped.
The Multicast, Unicast, and Remote echo test options are used to test the
reception of packets on a remote wireless bridge from a local wireless bridge.
During this test, packets are sent using a Cisco proprietary protocol triggering
the remote node to send a reply regarding signal strength and other related
parameters.
■
You can use the Multicast option to verify and obtain metrics on the
wireless transmissions over a local wireless network. Like regular multi-
cast packets, the multicast test packets are sent over the network without
any acknowledgement or retries other than the test report added to the
test packet.The packet contains the time it was initially sent, and the
time it was received again at the point of origin.A signal strength
metric, expressed as a percentage of full power, provides the information
on the strength of the signal at each transient point on the network.

You can use the Unicast option to verify the path between the wireless
bridge and other nodes on the wireless and Ethernet segment.The same
error recovery considerations are applied to this packet as would normal
user packets.The information provided in the report packet provides
insight into network throughput and congestion along with the number
of retry attempts.
■
The Remote option provides a means of controlling a multicast link test
triggered on a remote bridge, from the local bridge console.The test is
the same as the standard multicast test.
The sixth through the ninth options are Destination, Size, Count, and Rate.
These echo parameter menu options provide a facility to perform echo tests on
wireless bridges:
■
The Destination option allows the input of the intended destination for
the echo test.Valid entries include the actual device infrastructure address
or the value “any.”The “any” value conﬁgures the wireless bridge to use
the ﬁrst usable entry on listed on its association table.
■
The Size and Count options conﬁgure the size and number of packets
to be sent.The default setting is conﬁgured to send 100 packets of 512
bytes.The packet size can be from 24 bytes to 1,500 bytes and the count
can be from 1 to 999.
■
The rate option speciﬁes the packet transmit data rate.The default
“auto” setting uses the maximum rate available.You can enter a speciﬁc
rate to provide for specialized test case scenarios.
Next is the Errors option.The viewing errors option provides access to the
radio error statistics generated during the test.
The Continuous option is the continuously running link test option, which
supports the repetition of tests.The value entered conﬁgures the time in seconds
between each test.A value of zero implies that tests are performed once and are
not repeated.
The Autotest option controls the automatic operation of a link test when a
repeater associates with its parent.The test uses the existing conﬁgured test
parameters to deﬁne the test options.The acceptable values include “off,” to con-
ﬁgure that a test is never triggered,“once” to conﬁgure that a test is to be trig-
gered only the ﬁrst time a unit associates with its parent and “always” where a test
is triggered every time a node associates with a parent.

Restart Option
The restart unit menu option (Diagnostics menu option 3) reboots the Cisco
Aironet 340 wireless bridge.The wireless bridge operates as it would if it had just
been powered up and all currently existing associations are lost.
Default and Reset Options
The return unit to default conﬁguration menu options (Diagnostics menu
options 4 and 5) provide a means to reset the wireless bridge to full factory
default using the “default” option or reset speciﬁc conﬁguration selections, such
as radio and ﬁlter, among others, back to factory default.
Loading Firmware and Conﬁgurations
The load option (Diagnostics menu option 6) displays a submenu that provides
options for loading updates to ﬁrmware and conﬁguration ﬁles from a remote
host into the local main memory of the wireless bridge (see Figure 6.28). Newly
downloaded ﬁles must be stored into local ﬂash memory before becoming active.
Files stored in the ﬂash memory of the bridge are retained during power down.
You can edit conﬁguration text ﬁles to act as command line input.These ﬁles
start with the string “! CONFIGURATION”. Commands that are to be exe-
cuted are listed line-by-line using the standard command-line syntax and option
settings.

Chapter 6 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges
Summary
This chapter provided detailed design and conﬁguration information on Cisco
Aironet wireless bridges.Wireless bridges operate at Layers 1 (Data Link) and 2
(Physical) of the OSI reference model and are used to interlink distinct LAN seg-
ments to form a single logical whole. Bridges can learn the location (local or
remote) of devices using static conﬁguration inputted by administrators, dynamic
conﬁgurations generated using intelligent routing protocols, and by analyzing the
ﬂow of trafﬁc over the various bridge interfaces. By knowing the location of
devices (local or remote), the bridge can forward or ﬁlter packets on various
interfaces thereby ensuring that required communications paths are available
while minimizing the trafﬁc ﬂow to the required minimum.
You can use wireless bridges to bridge cabled LAN segments over distances
ranging from a few feet to twenty or more miles.When establishing a wireless
bridge network, you need to consider two factors: line of sight and Fresnel
Zones. Line of sight refers to establishing a wireless path between two bridge
nodes with the minimum of obstructions.A good guideline is that if you can see
the target, you should be able to establish a good wireless connection.
The Cisco wireless bridge family is made up of two distinct series of compo-
nents, the 340 wireless bridge and the 350 wireless bridge.The main difference
between these two wireless bridge series revolves primarily around transmitter
power.The 340 series wireless bridge can transmit at up to 30 milliwatts whereas
the 350 series wireless bridge can transmit at up to 100 milliwatts.
Apart from this distinction and the inline power option (power obtained from
the Ethernet cable connected to a Cisco Catalyst switch, power patch panel or
power injector) available on the 350 series bridges, both bridges support the basic
three modes of operation: point-to-point, point-to-multipoint and repeater.
Point-to-point conﬁgurations refer to using two wireless bridges to interconnect
two LAN segments. In Point-to-point, one cabled LAN segment is bridged to
another cabled LAN segment using two wireless bridges. In this case, the wireless
network is used only to send trafﬁc between the two LANs.
In point-to-multipoint mode, three or more bridges are interlinked together
to form a larger LAN. One of the wireless bridges is conﬁgured as the Root
Node, whereas the others are conﬁgured as Remote Nodes.The Root Node is
used to identify the start for the network or root of the network tree.The identi-
ﬁcation of the Root Node is signiﬁcant to the deﬁnition of the Spanning Tree
Protocol and for the establishment of parent/child relationships between each 
of the bridges used in the point-to-multipoint conﬁguration.The parent/child
www.syngress.com

Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges • Chapter 6
321
relationship establishes a hierarchy between devices and deﬁnes rules for receiving
and transmitting communications between each node.
Wireless bridges conﬁgured as repeaters simply rebroadcast transmissions from
a wireless bridge for which it is acting as a parent and from the wireless bridge
that is acting as it own parent.
The quick installation and conﬁguration steps used during the initial setup of
the wireless bridge involve conﬁguring the wireless bridge from the console
interface (default setting 9600 8N1) to deﬁne the base antenna, radio, and
Ethernet port baseline conﬁgurations. Once complete, the initial conﬁguration
provides the wireless bridge with the basic conﬁguration required to establish ele-
mentary communications with other wireless bridges and for using the local
Ethernet port.
LEDs are provided to indicate association status, that is, if a connection is
established with the wireless LAN; operational status, transmission, and receipt of
packets over the wireless LAN; errors and warnings, if transmit or receive errors
are encountered; and lastly, bridge failure where errors with the ﬁrmware load
process occurred.
Once the wireless bridge is operational, you can access the bridge three dif-
ferent ways for additional conﬁguration: through the console interface, using
Telnet, and via a Web server interface.To enable Telnet, HTTP, and SNMP, you
must conﬁgure a local IP address, a subnet mask, and a gateway on the bridge
using the Ident setting under the Conﬁguration option from the main menu.
Although the interface access may be different, the menus displayed in each of
the access modes provided a consistent layout of features and functions. In addi-
tion, you can use the command prompt to speed up command input and menu
navigation. Remember that when a Telnet session is active, the console interface
is temporarily disabled.You can force a Telnet disconnect from the console using
the Break key.
The radio parameters options are used to conﬁgure the Root Node bridge
and for setting the SSID, data rate, and distance.The Radio menu is found in the
Conﬁguration menu selection. More advanced options available from the Radio
menu include options such as IEEE 802.11 conﬁguration options (Beacon,
DTIM), extended network protocols, privacy, and encapsulation used when inte-
grating multiple vendor solutions within a single wireless LAN.
Advanced Ethernet options are used to deﬁne the maximum frame size and
Ethernet port selection. Network identiﬁers are used to deﬁne DNS, DHCP, and
wireless bridge naming.

Chapter 6 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Aironet Bridges
Console management provides access to the wireless bridge to speciﬁc
administrative and support personnel with read and write privileges.You can
assign passwords to each privilege and class of administrative user by deﬁning
RPassword and WPassword. Use these passwords to secure access to the console
port.Take special care to remember the password settings because the only way to
recover lost password is to send the unit back to Cisco for factory reset. SNMP is
supported within the wireless bridge to provide remote management and sup-
port. Using the Conﬁguration Console Communities menu, administrators can
create, remove, and list SNMP communities.
You should deﬁne Network Time Protocol to ensure the proper operation of
the network and the synchronization of logged events over all the devices making
up the network. It is conﬁgured using the Conﬁguration Time menu options.
The Cisco wireless bridge uses association tables to deﬁne parent/child rela-
tionships between wireless bridges.Wireless bridges connections and relationships
can be resolved as connected, hierarchy, static, multicast ﬁlters, and node ﬁlters.
You can use ﬁlters to deﬁne the operation of the wireless bridge in multicast,
node address, protocol, and direction ﬁltering by using the Filter option from the
main menu.
Logs and statistics are used to record and identify error and severe error
events occurring within the wireless bridge. From these displays, you can review
network activity information relating to throughput, radio, Ethernet, map, and
ARP, among others.
The Diagnostics menu provides a facility to simplify troubleshooting activi-
ties. Network test tools available include Telnet, Ping, and Find. Linktest reports
can be used to indicate signal strength; wireless carrier state; multicast, unicast,
and remote echo tests; destination addresses; packet conﬁgurations, and test set-
tings. LED pattern displays on the wireless bridge provide a local display of link
test status and related error conditions when performing link tests.
The Cisco Aironet wireless bridge family can load and save ﬁrmware and
conﬁguration ﬁles.You can use the console interface to upload or download ﬁles
using Xmodem and Crc-xmodem ﬁle exchange protocols.You can establish an
FTP session over the cabled network Ethernet port to transfer ﬁles to and from a
remote agent or a server. Lastly, the Distribute option is available for the down-
load and installation of updated conﬁguration and ﬁrmware ﬁles between wireless
bridges over the wireless network using control management packets.You can
conﬁgure a local wireless bridge to accept or reject distributions based on the
Control settings deﬁned in the Diagnostics Load Distribution Menu. For envi-
ronments using centralized conﬁguration ﬁle management and distribution, use

Introduction
The Cisco Aironet client adapter cards are versatile wireless LAN adapters that
are used to establish network connections between the wireless client node and
other Cisco Aironet client nodes or Cisco Aironet wireless network access points
(APs).The Wireless LAN adapters are conﬁgured to operate in one of two net-
work modes: Infrastructure network mode or Ad Hoc network mode.
When used in the Infrastructure network mode, the cards provide networking
capabilities that establish and support communications between the wireless client
node and one or more Cisco Aironet APs.You can conﬁgure infrastructure clients
to communicate with all available wireless APs with preferred afﬁliations to spe-
ciﬁc wireless APs. Preferred afﬁliations provide network architects with the ability
to better plan and engineer wireless network deployment taking into considera-
tion issues of client node roaming and redundancy engineering.
Ad Hoc network mode provides wireless client nodes with the capability to
establish peer-to-peer network connections with other wireless client nodes.
When conﬁgured in Ad Hoc, infrastructure components are not required to
establish the network connection.Two or more workstations conﬁgured to access
the same wireless network is all that is needed.The primary use of Ad Hoc net-
work mode conﬁgurations is for peer-to-peer ﬁle exchange between wireless
clients over the wireless radio network.
The Cisco Aironet wireless LAN adapters support the use of one or more
security overlays to secure communications.These consist of Service Set ID
(SSID) identiﬁcation, preferred AP conﬁgurations, and Wired Equivalent Protocol
(WEP) session encryption.The WEP mode provides multiple modes of operation
to address different network communication security requirements, including 40-
bit and 128-bit cryptography and dynamic WEP key updates.
Lastly, the Cisco Aironet wireless LAN adapters can be installed in the wire-
less client node with or without the Aironet Client Utility (ACU).The ACU is
used by administrators and end users to conﬁgure the Aironet wireless LAN
adapter locally and to perform wireless network tests and general system diagnos-
tics.The ACU can also support centralized administration and distribution wire-
less client node conﬁguration ﬁles via a localized auto-installer. In this mode,
administrators can predeﬁne user conﬁgurations and issue them with the adapter
and the wireless LAN adapter card driver.
This chapter provides detailed information on the installation and conﬁgura-
tion of Cisco wireless LAN adapters, provides insight on option selections to sup-
port both Infrastructure network and Ad Hoc network modes of operations, and

describes the troubleshooting features that are available on the LAN adapter itself
and via the ACU.
Cisco Aironet Client Adapter Types
Cisco Aironet client adapters are available in several form factors.These include
PC Card, LM Card, PC Interface (PCI), and mini PCI card (see Table 7.1).The
support for multiple card form factors provides the capability to integrate a mul-
titude of end client devices within the wireless LAN environment.
Although distinctions exist regarding the type of physical interface used by
the wireless LAN adapter to connect to the client node device bus, all wireless
LAN adapters, with the exception of Mini PCI adapters, possess of the same basic
components.These include a wireless antenna, a network access card, status LEDs,
and the various system drivers.

forms. Note that the Mini PCI card does not have status LEDs
because it is generally installed within a device and the card
is not visible from the exterior.
Comparing the Cisco Aironet 340 and 
350 Series Wireless LAN Adapters
Two series of wireless LAN adapters are available for each of the form factors
listed in Table 7.1, namely the 340 series and the 350 series.The 340 and 350
series of adapter and infrastructure network components, such as wireless APs,

Chapter 7 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Wireless Network Cards
bridges and repeaters, are all interoperable.The basic difference between the two
model series relates to the strength of the radio used.
The 350 series provides a more powerful radio transmitter than the 340
series.The 350 transmitter can operate at power signal strengths up to 100 milli-
watts.The 340 transmitter is limited to power strengths up to 30 milliwatts.
Depending on the deployment requirements, lower powered 340 series wireless
adapters may suit the networking needs of most client nodes within short prox-
imity to each other or to the wireless infrastructure components. For longer
transmission distances or in areas where radio signals are impacted by environ-
mental factors, the more powerful 350 series wireless adapters may be better
suited. Choosing the right adapter for each speciﬁc environment can be facili-
tated by using the radio link test set provided with the ACU application.
Information on how to use the test suite is provided in the section entitled
“Client Adapter Diagnostics.”
WARNING
You should also consider user safety precautions when employing any
form of radio transmitter. Government guidelines on the use of and
exposure to radio transmitters are available from the Federal
Communications Commission. You can obtain reports via the Internet at
www.fcc.gov.
Apart from the model line difference between the 340 and 350 series adapter,
a distinction is also present within each of the model lines.The 341 and 351
model wireless LAN client adapters support 40-bit WEP encryption.The 342
and 352 model wireless LAN adapters support both 40-bit and 128-bit WEP
encryption.Table 7.2 provides a matrix of the capabilities of each adapter type.

Cisco Aironet Client Utility (ACU)
The Cisco ACU is the conﬁguration application that provides the interface to
conﬁgure the Cisco Aironet 340 and 350 Client adapters.Administrators can use
the ACU to create proﬁles for users with restricted access to conﬁguration
menus.Windows XP provides a capability to conﬁgure the client adapter directly
from the control panel menu.The Windows XP control panel conﬁguration
interface will not be discussed as part of this chapter.

Perform the ACU installation by inserting the application installation CD-
ROM and following the on-screen prompts.The ACU supports Windows XP,
ME, 2000, NT, 98, and 95, as well as Linux and MacOS 9. Once you install the
ACU and reboot the computer, the green LEDs will blink on the Aironet client
adapter.This will conﬁrm that the ACU installation was successful and communi-
cations with the Aironet Client adapter have been established.
Cisco Aironet Client Proﬁle Manager
The ACU Proﬁle Manager provides a facility through which you can deﬁne up
to sixteen different client proﬁles in order to support the varying wireless net-
work environments a client may be subject to during roaming.You can establish
distinct environment conﬁgurations to support corporate wireless LAN net-
working, public wireless network access, home wireless network access, and ad
hoc peer-to-peer networks.You can save and export conﬁguration proﬁles to
support remote backup in the event of system failure or to re-create installed

Creating a New Aironet Client Proﬁle
The create new proﬁle function is used to deﬁne Aironet LAN Adapter conﬁgu-
rations.To create a new client proﬁle, follow these steps:
1. Launch the ACU, accessed from the computer’s desktop or from the
application menu, and select the Proﬁle Manager icon located on the
menu bar (refer to Figure 7.1).
2. Click Add and input the name of the proﬁle that is to be conﬁgured.
3. Once completed, press Enter, and the proﬁle properties screens for the
new proﬁle will be displayed. If the default values are appropriate for the
new proﬁle, click OK.
You can change the conﬁgurations later to match the local wireless LAN
environment.
Using an Existing Aironet Client Proﬁle
Three modes of operation are available to the wireless client for selecting the
proﬁle to be used during a session.The ﬁrst is referred to as Manual Proﬁle
Selection. In this mode, you need to manually select the proﬁle to be used during
the wireless networking session from the list of available proﬁles provided in the
drop-down proﬁle list menu.
The second mode of operation is referred to as Auto Proﬁle Selection. In this
mode, the wireless client automatically chooses which proﬁle to use. If the wire-
less LAN client becomes disassociated from the wireless network for more than
10 seconds or longer than the time deﬁned in the Lightweight Extensible
Authentication Protocol (LEAP) conﬁguration, it will attempt to re-establish a
wireless networking session using an alternate proﬁle.
The third mode is called Allow Windows To Conﬁgure My Wireless Network
Settings, which is available only to Windows XP users.This option disregards any
ACU conﬁgurations and provides access to conﬁgurations deﬁned within
Windows XP. In most cases, the ACU would not be used or installed in conjunc-
tion with Windows XP for everyday wireless networking.The only beneﬁt to
installing the ACU on Windows XP platforms would be to access the advanced
troubleshooting and diagnostics functions available only from the ACU.

address changes in conﬁgurations or to create new proﬁles.To access an existing
proﬁle, select the requested proﬁle from the Proﬁle Manager proﬁle listing
drop-down menu and click Edit.The proﬁle properties will be displayed on the
main screen. Once you have reconﬁgured the proﬁle settings, you can save the
proﬁle and include it as a valid option for use with the Auto Proﬁle Selection by
clicking the Include Proﬁle in Auto proﬁle Selection checkbox. If you are
using LEAP, you can only include the proﬁle in the Auto Proﬁle Selection if it
has been saved with a LEAP username and password pair. Once the conﬁgura-
tions are complete, click OK to save the conﬁgurations.
Reconﬁguring Proﬁles with the 
Default Aironet Client Proﬁle Values
At times, you may want to reset a proﬁle to the original baseline client proﬁle
setting values.To accomplish this, select the proﬁle from the Proﬁle Manager
proﬁle listing drop-down menu and click Use Defaults.The system will prompt
for a conﬁrmation. Clicking Yes followed by OK will reconﬁgure the proﬁle
with the baseline option settings and save the proﬁle.

to save the proﬁle.You can change the Save As name if required. Click Save.The
ACU exports the proﬁle to the requested location.
Restricting Proﬁle Access to Administrative Users
The ACU installed on Windows XP, 2000, and NT operating systems supports
multiple classes of users.This means that the base operating system can make a
distinction between administrative users and non-administrative users (regular
users).As such, you can conﬁgure the ACU to support administrative rights for
administrative tasks involving proﬁles. In this mode, regular users are not allowed
to access proﬁle or conﬁguration functions within the local ACU.
To modify the administrative control of the ACU parameters, log in to the
system using an account with administrative rights and access the ACU. Select the
Preferences icon on the menu bar (see Figure 7.1). Deselect the Allow Non-
Administrator Users to Use ACU to Modify Proﬁles checkbox. Click OK
to save the conﬁguration. Regular users will not be able to use the ACU to
modify proﬁles or conﬁgurations.

The Client Name ﬁeld is where you set the name that is to be associated with
the Aironet LAN adapter.This name will be displayed within the Aironet wireless
AP connections displays and on peer-to-peer networked wireless nodes.The
client name is also used in cross-reference with wireless nodes Media Access
Control (MAC) address.The name you enter can be up to 16 characters in
length.The default value for the client name setting is empty.
Setting the SSID
The Service Set Identiﬁers are used to identify to which wireless networks each
client node is allowed to participate.The screen provides for up to three SSID
entries.The entry of multiple SSID settings provide client nodes with the capa-
bility to roam between wireless networks using a single proﬁle. Each SSID entry
can be up to 32 characters in length. Note that entries are case-sensitive.The
default value for the SSID setting is empty.When left to the default value, client
nodes will only be able to establish wireless network sessions with wireless APs
that have been conﬁgured with no SSID.

Chapter 7 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Wireless Network Cards
Setting Power Save Mode
The Power Save Mode setting is used to conﬁgure the power usage of the wire-
less adapter and the radio transmitter. Different “keep alive” and “status check”
packet modes are available for each of the power save modes.The Cisco Aironet
Client node supports three power save modes:
■
Constantly Awake Mode (CAM) The CAM mode is selected as the
default power save mode.This power save mode keeps the adapter and
transmitter constantly powered to keep transmission response times to a
minimum.This setting is best suited for wireless client nodes such as
desktop PCs that are attached to an AC power source.
■
Maximum Power Save (Max PSP) The Max PSP setting registers
the wireless client node within the AP node listing as operating in max-
imum power save mode.When client nodes are conﬁgured in this mode,
the associated AP will buffer communications so that they are bursty and
can provide a maximum efﬁciency in the use of the client node trans-
mission power usage. In this mode, clients poll the AP on regular inter-
vals between sleep mode to verify the presence of the AP and any
buffered transmissions.This mode is efﬁcient for battery powered devices
with limited communication requirements. Note that when the ACU is
launched on devices conﬁgured for Max PSP, the power save mode is
temporarily set to Fast PSP mode in order to support conﬁguration
communications with APs. Upon terminating the ACU, the device is
returned to Max PSP power save mode.
■
Fast Power Save (Fast PSP) The Fast PSP setting conﬁgures the
wireless client node to alternate between CAM and PSP mode in accor-
dance to the network data transmission demands.When a high data
throughput is required, the wireless client node reverts to CAM power
save mode.When the data throughput demands are low, the wireless
client node reverts to Max PSP power save mode.
Setting the Network Type
The Network Type conﬁguration setting provides a means to deﬁne the type 
of wireless network that is to be conﬁgured.Two types of wireless networks are
supported:
www.syngress.com

Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Wireless Network Cards • Chapter 7

■
Infrastructure The Infrastructure network type indicates that the wire-
less network the client node is using is eventually connected to a wired
Ethernet network via a wireless AP or a wireless bridge.A distinct
advanced conﬁguration parameter menu is provided speciﬁcally for client
nodes operating with network type set to Infrastructure. Infrastructure
clients cannot conﬁgure options reserved for Ad Hoc clients.
■
Ad Hoc The Ad Hoc Network type indicates that the wireless network
the client node is using is not connected to a cabled Ethernet network.
This network type is used when several wireless client nodes are creating
a wireless LAN between themselves or when they connect to a wireless
AP that does not have a cabled Ethernet connection.A distinct advanced
conﬁguration parameter menu is provided for client nodes speciﬁcally
operating with network type set to Ad Hoc.Ad Hoc clients cannot con-
ﬁgure options reserved for Infrastructure clients.

The ﬁelds available for conﬁgurations include the following:
■
Data Rate
■
Use Short Radio Headers
■
World Mode
■
Transmit Power
■
Data Retries
■
Fragment Threshold
These topics are covered in further detail in the following sections.
Conﬁguring the Data Rate
The Data Rate RF Network conﬁguration deﬁnes the data transmission rates
that will be supported by the wireless client node for communications with wire-
less APs or other wireless client nodes.When the wireless client node has been
conﬁgured for Infrastructure mode, you should conﬁgure the Data Rate setting
to Auto Rate Selection. For wireless client nodes that are conﬁgured for Ad Hoc
network mode, you should conﬁgure the Data Rate setting to a speciﬁc rate to
minimize data rate synchronization issues. By default, the Data Rate setting is
conﬁgured for Auto Rate Selection.
When you select Auto Rate Selection, the wireless client node will attempt
to communicate using the fastest rate available (11 Mbps) and will train down to
the fastest supported rate as required.
As a general observation, the 11 Mbps access rate provides the highest data
transmission rate, but the shortest transmission range.The 1 Mbps data rate pro-
vides the lowest data transmission rate but the greatest range.Access rates in-
between provide varying combinations of throughput and range (see Figure 7.4).

Choosing Radio Headers
The Use Short Radio Headers option box selection should match the
Preamble conﬁguration of the wireless AP. Short radio headers provide means of
transmitting packets in a more efﬁcient manner over the wireless network. Long
radio headers ensure maximum interoperability with wireless devices that do not
support short radio headers. By default, Short Radio Headers are enabled.
Setting World Mode
This option is available only when wireless client nodes are conﬁgured in
Infrastructure mode.This setting minimizes the client conﬁgurations required to
support roaming users traveling to countries approving differing radio transmis-
sion regulatory standards.
When a wireless client node and a wireless AP are both conﬁgured for World
Mode, the wireless client node will support the maximum transmitter power and
transmit frequencies supported by the AP. In essence, the wireless client node
observes to regional radio standards as communicated by the locally conﬁgured
wireless AP. By default, this option is not checked.
Selecting the Power Level
Each Cisco Aironet client adapter is conﬁgured with the maximum power output
supported for the local radio transmission regulatory standard.The Transmit
Power option provides a means of selecting the maximum power transmission
option available to the region or that best ﬁts the localized environment where
the wireless client node is located. For example, operating at higher power levels
increases radio range but also increases battery drain on mobile client nodes.
Operating at lower power levels decreases the radio range but also decreases bat-
tery drain (see Table 7.4).

Chapter 7 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Wireless Network Cards
Setting the Data Retries Value
The Data Retries slider and value box deﬁne the number of times a packet will
be retransmitted if it is not successfully received by the wireless AP or other client
node.The default setting for Data Retries is selected at 16, but you can con-
ﬁgure it between 1 and 128 to match the wireless network operating environ-
ment and application protocol requirement.
Selecting Maximum Packet Size
The Fragmented Threshold is to used establish the maximum packet size that can
be transmitted without being fragmented into smaller packets. Packet fragmenting
provides a means to lower the retransmission requirement of large packets that are
not successfully received by the intended recipient.This can save network time
and power use by forcing the retransmission of only the packet fragments that
have not been received. By default, the Fragment Threshold option is conﬁg-
ured for 2,312, but you can conﬁgure it between 256 and 2,312 depending on
the network requirements.

Client: Advanced (Infrastructure)
The advanced infrastructure conﬁguration screen provides any wireless client
node conﬁgured with a network type setting of Infrastructure access to the
advanced radio and wireless network parameters. Select it by clicking the
Advanced (Infrastructure) tab when displaying the System Parameters
screen (see Figure 7.5).
The advanced infrastructure screen provides access to infrastructure-speciﬁc
conﬁguration options.The ﬁelds available for conﬁgurations include the following:
■
Antenna Mode (Receive)/Antenna Mode (Transmit)
■
Speciﬁed AP
■
RTS Threshold
■
RTS Retry Limit
Each of these topics are covered in the following sections.

Antenna Mode (Receive)/Antenna Mode (Transmit)
The Antenna Mode selection box is used to deﬁne the antenna mode that is to
be used in the current infrastructure-based wireless environment.Three options
are available, including diversity, left antenna only, and right antenna only.Whereas
the left and right antenna options provide similar range and transmission/recep-
tion capabilities, the diversity option provides enhanced transmission/reception
for clients located in areas where wireless signals may be attenuated by the envi-
ronment, as in the case of obstructions or by long radio signal travel path.The
option you select should be the one that best addresses the wireless network
operational conditions.Three options are provided:
■
Diversity (Both) Conﬁgures the wireless adapter card to use both
antennas and use the packets that have been received with the best avail-
able signal.This is the default option for PC card, LM card, and PCI
mini card client adapters.This option is not available to PCI card client
adapter cards because they only have one antenna.
■
Right Antenna Only Conﬁgures the wireless adapter card to use only
the right antenna.This is the default option for PCI card client adapters.
This option is available to PC card, LM card, and PCI mini card client
adapters.

■
Left Antenna Only Conﬁgures the wireless adapter card to use only
the left antenna.This option is available to PC card, LM card, PCI card,
and PCI mini card client adapters.
Speciﬁed AP
The text box entries allow for the entry of four distinct preferred repeater AP
MAC addresses to which the wireless client node can interface.The APs you
enter should be only APs conﬁgured in repeater mode.The text boxes are empty
by default.This option is useful for creating a network layout where speciﬁc
wireless clients interface with speciﬁc APs to address even distribution of client
nodes among the available AP. In this example, multiple APs can be co-located
within a given area providing distinct wireless LANs to each user population.
RTS Threshold
RTS packets are used to establish a clear, open-channel window during which
the client is the only authorized data transmitter over the wireless LAN.A clear
channel is acknowledged by the AP, by sending a clear-to-send (CTS) packet over
the network.
Setting this parameter can help to bring order to a network experiencing
high packet collision rates.To conﬁgure this option, enter the minimum packet
size required before the wireless client node sends a request-to-send (RTS)
packet over the network. By default the parameter is conﬁgured for 2,312, but
you can set it between 0 and 2,312 to meet local wireless network requirements.
You can conduct testing by using link tests and troubleshooting tests to help
deﬁne the optimum conﬁguration for the client environment.
RTS Retry Limit
The RTS retry limit deﬁnes the number of times a wireless client node will
attempt to obtain a CTS from the AP before attempting to send the packet over
the network without receipt of a CTS packet. By default the parameter is conﬁg-
ured for 16, but you can adjust it between the values of 1 and 128 to address
environments where high network usage issues exist within congested areas.

antennas and use the packets that have been received with the best avail-
able signal.This is the default option for PC card, LM card, and PCI
Mini card client adapters.This option is not available to PCI card client
adapter cards because they have only one antenna.

adapters.
■
Left Antenna Only Conﬁgures the wireless adapter card to use only
the left antenna.This option is available to PC card, LM card, PCI card,
and PCI mini card client adapters.
RTS Threshold
The RTS threshold conﬁguration operates in a similar manner to the RTS
threshold setting available in Advanced Infrastructure settings. It deﬁnes the min-
imum packet size required before the wireless client node sends an RTS packet
over the network. RTS packets are used to establish an open-channel widow
during which the client is the only authorized data transmitter.A clear channel is
acknowledged by the receipt of a CTS packet over the network. Setting this
parameter can help to bring order to a network experiencing high packet colli-
sion rates. By default, the parameter is conﬁgured for 2,312, but you can set it
between 0 and 2,312 to meet local wireless network requirements.
RTS Retry Limit
The RTS retry limit deﬁnes the number of times a wireless client node will
attempt to obtain a CTS from the AP before attempting to send the packet over
the networking without receipt of a CTS packet. By default, the parameter is
conﬁgured for 16, but you can adjust it between the values of 1 and 128 to
address network throughput issues.
Wake Duration (Kµs)
The Wake Duration settings deﬁne the period of time a wireless client node
adapter will remain awake to receive an Announcement Trafﬁc Indication

Message (ATIM) packet after a beacon.The default setting is of 5Kµs.The param-
eter supports settings of 0Kµs (which must be used in CAM mode) and between
5Kµs and 60Kµs (when conﬁgured in Max PSP or Fast PSP). One kilo-
microsecond or 1Kµs is equivalent to 1024 microseconds or 1.024 milliseconds.
Beacon Period (Kµs)
The Beacon Period is used to deﬁne and synchronize the beacon timing periods
used between Ad Hoc wireless client nodes.The default setting is conﬁgured to
of 100Kµs.The parameter supports settings ranging from 20Kµs to 976Kµs.
Cisco Aironet Client Network 
Security Conﬁguration
The Client Network Security conﬁguration screen deﬁnes how the wireless client
node will establish a secure connection with an AP.The settings are not used in Ad
Hoc mode. Proper conﬁguration is critical to the secure operation of the wireless
network.You should use the maximum security setting whenever possible.
Note that the wireless client node and the wireless AP (in Infrastructure
mode) or other wireless clients (in Ad Hoc mode) must share the same conﬁgu-
rations settings for the security options to work and for communications to be
properly established. See Figure 7.7 for the available options.
www.syngress.com
Figure 7.7 Network Security Parameter Conﬁguration Tab

352
Chapter 7 • Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Wireless Network Cards
Conﬁgure the network security options by clicking the Network Security
tab from the System Parameters screen. Conﬁguration options entered on this
screen must match the conﬁgurations entered on the AP or client. Failure to do
so can result in an inoperative network or an open network. Chapter 5 provides
detailed information on the security options available on the AP.We review the
options in this section at a high level for chapter continuity.
Setting the Security Parameters
The static WEP keys are used to provide a basic level of security over the wire-
less radio link.As such, you should not consider them to be a complete security
solution.
Each proﬁle can have up to four distinct static WEP keys assigned within the
Network Security options of a proﬁle.WEP keys can be 40-bit or 128-bit.You
must conﬁgure APs for full encryption for WEP keys to be effectively used.WEP
keys must also be the same on all devices making up the wireless network. If a
node receives a packet encrypted with a WEP key that is not available locally, the
packet will be discarded.
You must enter WEP keys in the same sequence on all devices, that is,WEP
key number one on the AP must also be WEP key number one on the wireless
client. Once entered in the conﬁguration screen, static WEP keys are stored in an
encrypted format within the Windows Registry and are no longer readable from
the WEP key conﬁguration screen.WEP keys are downloaded to the wireless
LAN adapter card upon system bootup or card insertion.This implies that if a
wireless LAN card is lost or stolen, the WEP keys will not be available.You can
enter WEP keys as a hexadecimal value (numbers 0–9 and letters A–F) or as
ASCII text, meaning that the WEP key is made up of characters, numbers, and
punctuation marks.To enter a new WEP key, re-enter the value in the appro-
priate WEP key ﬁeld.
Authentication to the AP is performed using one of two methods: Shared
Key Authentication and Open Authentication. Shared Key Authentication speci-
ﬁes that the client can communicate only with APs that have the same WEP key.
As part of the shared authentication process, a packet is sent from the AP to the
client for encryption. Once the packet has been encrypted using a WEP key, the
packet is returned to the AP. If the AP can decrypt the packet, an acknowledg-
ment is sent back to the client indicating a successful authentication. Shared key
is not the recommended method of authentication due to security risks inherent
in the authentication method.The default setting is Open Authentication. It
www.syngress.com

Installation and Conﬁguration of Cisco Wireless Network Cards • Chapter 7
353
allows the client node to authenticate and attempt to communicate with APs
even it does not share the same WEP keys.
Allow Association to Mixed Cells
This option setting deﬁnes if the local wireless client node will be allowed to
associate with wireless APs having WEP security set to “Optional.” By selecting
the Allow Association to Mixed Cells, the local wireless client node will asso-
ciate with both APs that have WEP security conﬁgured to “Optional” and APs
that force WEP security. By deselecting the Allow Association to Mixed
Cells, the wireless client node will associate only with APs that have WEP secu-
rity enabled using one of the predeﬁned WEP keys.The default is for the param-
eter to not be enabled.
Client Adapter Auto Installer
The Aironet client LAN adapter auto installer is an executable application that
can install the ACU and conﬁgure the local Aironet client LAN adapter automat-
ically.The Auto Installer works under Windows XP, ME, 2000, NT, 98, and 95.
No Auto Installer is available at this time for the MacOS platform.
The Auto Installer application is named CWUAInst.exe and can run locally
on the device’s hard drive or remotely on a network drive.The Auto Installer
provides details regarding the installation of the ACU, ﬁrmware installation, appli-
cation ﬁle location, and the name of the wireless conﬁguration proﬁle to be used
during the client LAN adapter conﬁguration.The client proﬁle used during the
installation and conﬁguration must be present within the installation directory for
the auto installation process to complete successfully.The installation ﬁle is an
ASCII encoded ﬁle that can have an .INI or a .TXT extension.
A DOS-based conﬁguration ﬁle encryption utility is provided for the safe-
guard of the INI or TXT conﬁguration ﬁle.The utility encrypts the ﬁle by using
a scrambling algorithm that can be decrypted by the Auto Installer.The utility is
called EncryptIni.exe.The following provides an example for the syntax of the
EncryptIni.exe:
1. Select Start | Run.
2. In the Open prompt, type Command and press Enter.
3. Using the DOS commands, navigate to the directory where the
EncryptIni.exe and the conﬁguration ﬁles are located.
4. Type EncryptIni.exe <conﬁguration ﬁle name>.

Client Adapter Diagnostics
This section identiﬁes the client adapter diagnostics tools available from the ACU.
You can use these tools to troubleshoot the wireless connectivity between a client
and an AP and between two clients and for verifying that the wireless adapter is
functioning properly.
The ACU provides the following diagnostics capabilities:
■
Display current status and conﬁguration
■
Display transmit and receive statistics
■
Display graphic of client adapter radio link
■
Perform a radio link test
Conﬁguring ACU Diagnostics Preferences
Before performing any tests or obtaining wireless adapter conﬁguration informa-
tion, you should conﬁgure the Diagnostics preferences to ensure that displayed
information is meaningful.To do this, use the Preferences icon in the menu bar.
The preferences include settings for the screen refresh rate (1–60 seconds), signal
strength display (percent of maximum power or dBm milliwatts) and link status
meter options to display a graphical history of the last 50 signal transmissions (see
Figure 7.9).

Displaying the Current Status
The wireless client node adapter status display provides a synopsis of the active
conﬁguration and the current signal strength.As such, information regarding the
version number of the current ﬁrmware, default proﬁle, authentication type,
transmit power levels, data rate, and channel frequency are all listed.To view the
status of the wireless LAN adapter, click Status on the menu bar.The status
menu screen will be displayed indicating the current proﬁle in use and the hard-
ware settings, along with signal strength and signal quality (see Figure 7.10).
Displaying the Operational Statistics
You can view information on the number and types of packets transmitted and
received by the wireless LAN adapter from the Operational Statistics screen.To
display the operational statistics, select Statistics from the menu bar.The statistics
menu screen will be displayed indicating the current proﬁle in use and various
signal and data transmission statistics.The transmit and receive statistics are
obtained from querying the host. See Figure 7.11 and Table 7.6.
Generally speaking, the fewer the errors, the better the state of the overall
network.The best way to identify if the wireless network is experiencing prob-
lems is by identifying a baseline of operation once the network has been opera-
tional for a few days and running routine checks to compare the latest statistics

regions: Poor, Fair, Good, and Excellent:
■
Poor and Fair Signal Status Signals status identifying Poor to Fair
ratings indicate that the current location does not provide radio signals
than can sustain high data throughputs. High error and retransmission
rates can be expected from areas supporting Poor and Fair signal status.
You should move the wireless client node to an alternate location or
lower the access speed.
■
Good Signal Status  Signal status identifying Good ratings indicate that
the current location provides adequate radio transmission and reception to
support most high-throughput communications.A low rate of errors and
packet retransmissions can be expected from the current location.
■
Excellent Signal Status  Signal status identifying Excellent ratings
indicate that the current location provides optimum radio transmission
and signal reception to support high throughput communications with
very low error rates and packet retransmissions.
Performing a Radio Frequency Link Test
You can use radio frequency link test to send network pings to obtain metrics on
the performance of the radio network from the current wireless client node loca-
tion.When you perform this test from various locations, you can establish a radio

Summary
This chapter provided a practical exposition on the implementation of wireless
clients using Cisco Aironet 340 and 350 series client adapters.
Four form factors of wireless client adapter cards make up the Cisco Aironet
adapter family speciﬁcally the PC card, the LM card, the PCI card, and lastly the
Mini PCI card.The PC card form factor is a PCMCIA card that can be used in
external type II and III PCMCIA interfaces typically found on laptops, PDAs,
and other portable platforms.The LM card is also a PCMCIA card, but this one
is intended for devices that have internal type II or III PCMCIA interfaces.The
PCI card is intended for desktop computing platforms with PCI card support.
Lastly, the Mini PCI card is used on devices possessing internal type IIIa mini
PCI slots.
There are two series of Cisco Aironet wireless adapters: the 340 and the 350
series.The 350 series cards (Aironet 351 and 352) possess more powerful trans-
mitters capable of transmitting a signal with a signal power up to 100 milliwatts,
whereas the 340 series cards (Aironet 341 and 342) supported transmitters with
up to 30 milliwatts.The 3x1 (Aironet 341 and 351) support WEP encryption
modes of operation consisting of 40-bit keys, whereas the 3x2 cards (Aironet 342
and 352) support 40-bit and 128-bit WEP.
The Aironet Client Utility (ACU) is a GUI that provides a conﬁguration and
maintenance interface used to support all of the Aironet client adapters.The
ACU provided four informational sections consisting of the command bar, the
menu bar, the main screen, and the status bar.
The ACU can preconﬁgure and manage user proﬁles or identities used to
access one or more wireless LAN deployments.You can import and export use
proﬁles for backup and recovery purposes by using the Proﬁle Manager
Import/Export function.Widows XP, 2000, and NT operating systems have the
added capability to restrict access to the proﬁles to administrative users only by
using the Preferences options and deselecting Allow Non-Administrator
Users to User ACU to Modify Proﬁles.
Client name, SSIDs, type of power save modes, and network type are deﬁned
using the System Parameter screen.Three types of power save modes were avail-
able for the client, namely Constantly Awake Mode (CAM), Maximum Power
Save (Max PSP), and Fast Power Save (Fast PSP).
The RF Network Parameters are used conﬁgure the minimum data
throughput rates (1 Mbps to 11 Mbps), radio channels, transmit power, data
retries, and packet fragment threshold.The RF Network Parameters are also used

to select the use of Short Radio Headers and world mode activation for interna-
tional infrastructure network roaming.
The Advanced (Infrastructure) menu display is used to deﬁne the parameter
conﬁgurations speciﬁc to wireless LAN clients operating with APs.The conﬁg-
urable parameters for Infrastructure mode clients includes the selection of receive
and transmit antenna mode (the left, right, or both antennas) preferred APs,
Ready To Send (RTS) threshold, and retry limits.
The Advanced (Ad Hoc) menu display is used to deﬁne parameter conﬁgura-
tion speciﬁc to wireless LAN clients operating in a peer-to-peer network of
wireless clients. Receive and transmit antenna modes and Ready To Send (RTS)
threshold and retry limits are deﬁned in a similar way to Advanced
(Infrastructure)–based clients.Ad Hoc clients, however, are also provided with
access to conﬁgure the Wake Duration and Beacon Period in thousands of
microseconds.These settings are used by the client adapter to help to structure
the communications and operations of the peer-to-peer wireless network.
The Network Security screen is where you deﬁne wireless network security
conﬁgurations.The parameters conﬁgured on this screen select the WEP mode
(static or dynamic), the type of AP authentication scheme, and the WEP key
entry in hexadecimal or ASCII text.
The Aironet Auto Client Installer is used by administrators to install and con-
ﬁgure client wireless LAN adapter software and ﬁrmware without the need to
conﬁgure each option individually from menus.To initiate the Auto Installer, use
the CWUAInst <conﬁguration ﬁle name> command. LAN adapter conﬁguration
parameters are deﬁned in a standard text ﬁle. Client adapter diagnostics utilities
are used to verify and troubleshoot the operations of the network. Conﬁguration
preferences are available to deﬁne screen update times, status bar, and the percent
and dBm display modes for the signal strength indicator.The current status of the
client adapter can be displayed by selecting the Status option on the menu bar.
Adapter statistics can be displayed using the Statistics option.The Link Status
Meter is used to display a graph of the overall state of the wireless link.
Frequency Link Tests are used to obtain metrics on the performance of the radio
network.
Link integrity/power and link activity LEDs are used to display the opera-
tional status of the wireless LAN adapters. Color and blink patterns are used to
identify speciﬁc network, communication, and ﬁrmware errors.

Q: What is Message Integrity Check (MIC) and how is it used?
A: MIC is a protocol that prevents bit-ﬂip attacks on encrypted packets trans-
mitted between wireless clients and APs supporting MIC. MIC adds integrity
check bits the packet, rendering it tamper-proof. Encrypted packets that are
modiﬁed during transit by an attacker are identiﬁed as being tampered, and a
retransmit packet request is sent to the originating station.
Q: Where are the multiple proﬁles stored within Proﬁle Manager?
A: Proﬁles are stored within the Aironet client adapter registry entry. Registry
entries are organized by the type of radio transmitter selected—that is, 340
series or 350 series adapters.
Q: Are there any restrictions regarding the use of the Auto Proﬁle Feature?
A: You need to consider several points using Auto Proﬁle, the ﬁrst is that two or
more proﬁles must exist on the local client. Second, if a proﬁle is conﬁgured
to use LEAP authentication, it must have a user name and password associated
with it before being added to the Auto Proﬁle list. Lastly, when using LEAP
in conjunction with login scripts for a proﬁle conﬁgured in Auto Proﬁle,
ensure that network connectivity is fully established before the scripts are ini-
tiated. If the scripts are initiated prior to full network connectivity, the scripts
will not activate.
Q: How can I ﬁnd out if my network is operating properly?
A: All network deployments are different. Each has its own characteristics that
can be identiﬁed only by obtaining and reviewing operational baseline statis-
tics on a regular basis. Some wireless links cover short distances.When wire-
less nodes are within close proximity to each other, a strong signal is
expected, and a low number of errors should be indicated. For wireless links

Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
Introduction
There is not much indication of anything slowing down the creation and deploy-
ment of new technology to the world any time in the near future.With the con-
stant pressure to deploy the latest generation of technology today, little time is
allowed for a full and proper security review of the technology and components
that make it up.
This rush to deploy, along with the insufﬁcient security review, not only
allows age-old security vulnerabilities to be reintroduced to products, but creates
new and unknown security challenges as well.Wireless networking is not exempt
from this, and like many other technologies, security ﬂaws have been identiﬁed
and new methods of exploiting these ﬂaws are published regularly.
Utilizing security fundamentals developed over the last few decades, you can
review and protect your wireless networks from known and unknown threats. In
this chapter, we recall security fundamentals and principles that are the founda-
tion of any good security strategy, addressing a range of issues from authentication
and authorization, to controls and audit.
No primer on security would be complete without an examination of the
common security standards, which are addressed in this chapter alongside the
emerging privacy standards and their implications for the wireless exchange of
information.
We also look at how you can maximize the features of existing security stan-
dards like Wired Equivalent Protocol (WEP).We also examine the effectiveness of
Media Access Control (MAC) and protocol ﬁltering as a way of minimizing
opportunity. Lastly, we look at the security advantages of using virtual private
networks (VPNs) on a wireless network, as well as discuss the importance of con-
vincing users of the role they can play as key users of the network.
You’ll also learn about the existing and anticipated threats to wireless net-
works, and the principles of protection that are fundamental to a wireless security
strategy.And although many of the attacks are similar in nature to attacks on
wired networks, you need to understand the particular tools and techniques that
attackers use to take advantage of the unique way wireless networks are designed,
deployed, and maintained.We explore the attacks that have exposed the vulnera-
bilities of wireless networks, and in particular the weaknesses inherent in the
security standards.Through a detailed examination of these standards, we identify
how these weaknesses have lead to the development of new tools and tricks that
hackers use to exploit your wireless networks.We look at the emergence and

threat of “war driving” technique and how it is usually the ﬁrst step in an attack
on wireless networks.
Understanding Security Fundamentals
and Principles of Protection
Security protection starts with the preservation of the conﬁdentiality, integrity, and
availability (CIA) of data and computing resources.These three tenets of informa-
tion security, often referred to as “The Big Three,” are sometimes represented by
the CIA triad, shown in Figure 8.1.
As we describe each of these tenets, you will see that in order to provide for a
reliable and secure wireless environment, you will need to ensure that each tenet is
properly protected.To ensure the preservation of The Big Three and protect the
privacy of those whose data is stored and ﬂows through these data and computing
resources,The Big Three security tenets are implemented through tried-and-true
security practices.These other practices enforce The Big Three by ensuring proper
authentication for authorized access while allowing for nonrepudiation in identiﬁ-
cation and resource usage methods, and by permitting complete accountability for
all activity through audit trails and logs. Some security practitioners refer to
Authentication,Authorization, and Audit (accountability) as “AAA.” Each of these
practices provides the security implementer with tools which they can use to prop-
erly identify and mitigate any possible risks to The Big Three.
Ensuring Conﬁdentiality
Conﬁdentiality attempts to prevent the intentional or unintentional unauthorized
disclosure of communications between a sender and recipient. In the physical
world, ensuring conﬁdentiality can be accomplished by simply securing the phys-
ical area. However, as evidenced by bank robberies and military invasions, threats

Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
exist to the security of the physical realm that can compromise security and con-
ﬁdentiality.
The moment electronic means of communication were introduced, many
new possible avenues of disclosing the information within these communications
were created.The conﬁdentiality of early analog communication systems, such as
the telegraph and telephone, were easily compromised by simply having someone
connect to the wires used by a sender and receiver.
When digital communications became available, like with many technologies,
it was only a matter of time until knowledgeable people were able to build
devices and methods that could interpret the digital signals and convert them to
whatever form needed to disclose what was communicated.And as technology
grew and became less expensive, the equipment needed to monitor and disclose
digital communications became available to anyone wishing to put the effort into
monitoring communication.
With the advent of wireless communications, the need for physically con-
necting to a communication channel to listen in or capture conﬁdential commu-
nications was removed.Although you can achieve some security by using
extremely tight beam directional antennas, someone still just has to sit somewhere
in between the antennas to be able to monitor and possibly connect to the com-
munications channel without having to actually tie into any physical device.
Having knowledge that communications channels are possibly compromised
allows us to properly implement our policies and procedures to mitigate the
wireless risk.The solution used to ensure The Big Three and other security tenets
is encryption.
The current implementation of encryption in today’s wireless networks use
the RC4 stream cipher to encrypt the transmitted network packets, and the WEP
to protect authentication into wireless networks by network devices connecting
to them (that is, the network adapter authentication, not the user utilizing the
network resources). Both of which, due mainly to improper implementations,
have introduced sufﬁcient problems that have made it possible to determine keys
used and then either falsely authenticate to the network or decrypt the trafﬁc
traveling across through the wireless network.
With these apparent problems, those in charge of wireless network security
should utilize other proven and properly implemented encryption solutions, such
as Secure Shell (SSH), Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), or IPSec.

Ensuring Integrity
Integrity ensures the accuracy and completeness of information throughout its
process methods.The ﬁrst communication methods available to computers did
not have much in place to ensure the integrity of the data transferred from one
to another.As such, occasionally something as simple as static on a telephone line
could cause the transfer of data to be corrupted.
To solve this problem, the idea of a checksum was introduced.A checksum is
nothing more than taking the message you are sending and running it through a
function that returns a simple value which is then appended to the message being
sent.When the receiver gets the complete message, they would then run the mes-
sage through the same function and compare the value they generate with the
value that was included at the end of the message.
The functions that are generally used to generate basic checksums are usually
based upon simple addition or modulus functions.These functions can sometimes
have their own issues, such as the function not being detailed enough to allow for
distinctly separate data that could possibly have identical checksums. It is even
possible to have two errors within the data itself cause the checksum to provide a
valid check because the two errors effectively cancel each other out.These prob-
lems are usually addressed through a more complex algorithm used to create the
digital checksum.
Cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs) were developed as one of the more
advanced methods of ensuring data integrity. CRC algorithms basically treat a
message as an enormous binary number, whereupon another large ﬁxed binary
number then divides this binary number.The remainder from this division is the
checksum. Using the remainder of a long division as the checksum, as opposed to
the original data summation, adds a signiﬁcant chaos to the checksum created,
increasing the likelihood that the checksum will not be repeatable with any other
separate data stream.
These more advanced checksum methods, however, have their own set of
problems.As Ross Williams wrote in his 1993 paper,A Painless Guide to CRC
Error Detection Algorithms (www.ross.net/crc/crcpaper.html), the goal of error
detection is to protect against corruption introduced by noise in a data transfer.
This is good if we are concerned only with protecting against possible transmis-
sion errors. However, the algorithm provides no means of ensuring the integrity
of an intentionally corrupted data stream. If someone has knowledge of a partic-
ular data stream, altering the contents of the data and completing the transaction
with a valid checksum is possible.The receiver would not have knowledge of the
www.syngress.com

380
Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
changes in the data because their checksum would match and it would appear as
if the data was transferred with no errors.
This form of intentional integrity violation is called a “Data Injection.” In
such cases, the best way to protect data is to (once again) use a more advanced
form of integrity protection utilizing cryptography.Today, this higher level of
protection is generally provided through a stronger cryptographic algorithm such
as the MD5 or RC4 ciphers.
Wireless networks today use the RC4 stream cipher to protect the data trans-
mitted as well as provide for data integrity. It has been proven that the 802.11
implementation of the RC4 cipher with its key scheduling algorithm introduces
enough information to provide a hacker with enough to be able to predict your
network’s secret encryption key. Once the hacker has your key, they are not only
able to gain access to your wireless network, but also view it as if there was no
encryption at all.
Ensuring Availability
Availability, as deﬁned in an information security context, ensures that access data
or computing resources needed by appropriate personnel is both reliable and
available in a timely manner.The origins of the Internet itself come from the
need to ensure the availability of network resources. In 1957, the United States
Department of Defense (DoD) created the Advanced Research Projects Agency
(ARPA) following the Soviet launch of Sputnik. Fearing loss of command and
control over U.S. nuclear missiles and bombers due to communication channel
disruption caused by nuclear or conventional attacks, the U.S.Air Force commis-
sioned a study on how to create a network that could function with the loss of
access or routing points. Out of this, packet switched networking was created, and
the ﬁrst four nodes of ARPANET were deployed in 1968 running at the then
incredibly high speed of 50 kilobits per second.
The initial design of packet switched networks did not take into considera-
tion the possibility of an actual attack on the network from one of its own nodes.
As the ARPANET grew into what we now know as the Internet, many modiﬁ-
cations have been made to the protocols and applications that make up the net-
work, ensuring the availability of all resources provided.
Wireless networks are experiencing many similar design issues, and due to the
proliferation of new wireless high-tech devices, many are ﬁnding themselves in
conﬂict with other wireless resources. Like their wired equivalents, there was little
expectation that conﬂicts would occur within the wireless spectrum available for
www.syngress.com

Cisco Wireless Security • Chapter 8
381
use. Because of this, very few wireless equipment providers planned their imple-
mentations with features to ensure the availability of the wireless resource in case
a conﬂict occurred.
Ensuring Privacy
Privacy is the assurance that the information a customer provides to some party
will remain private and protected.This information generally contains customer
personal nonpublic information that is protected by both regulation and civil 
liability law.Your wireless policy and procedures should contain deﬁnitions on
how to ensure the privacy of customer information that might be accessed or
transmitted by your wireless networks.The principles and methods here provide
ways of ensuring the protection of the data that travels across your networks and
computers.
Ensuring Authentication
Authentication provides for a sender and receiver of information to validate each
other as the appropriate entity they are wishing to work with. If entities wishing
to communicate cannot properly authenticate each other, then there can be no
trust of the activities or information provided by either party. It is only through a
trusted and secure method of authentication that we are able to provide for a
trusted and secure communication or activity.
The simplest form of authentication is the transmission of a shared password
between the entities wishing to authenticate with each other.This could be as
simple as a secret handshake or a key.As with all simple forms of protection, once
knowledge of the secret key or handshake was disclosed to nontrusted parties,
there could be no trust in who was using the secrets anymore.
Many methods can be used to acquire a simple secret key, from something as
simple as tricking someone into disclosing it, to high-tech monitoring of com-
munications between parties to intercept the key as it is passed from one party to
the other. However the code is acquired, once it is in a nontrusted party’s hands,
they are able to utilize it to falsely authenticate and identify themselves as a valid
party, forging false communications, or utilizing the user’s access to gain permis-
sions to the available resources.
The original digital authentication systems simply shared a secret key across
the network with the entity they wished to authenticate with.Applications such
as Telnet, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and POP-mail are examples of programs
that simply transmit the password, in clear-text, to the party they are authenticating

Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
with.The problem with this method of authentication is that anyone who is able
to monitor the network could possibly capture the secret key and then use it to
authenticate themselves as you in order to access these same services.They could
then access your information directly, or corrupt any information you send to
other parties.They may even be able to attempt to gain higher privileged access
with your stolen authentication information.
www.syngress.com
Clear-Text Authentication
Clear-text (non-encrypted) authentication is still widely used by many
people today who receive their e-mail through the Post Ofﬁce Protocol
(POP), which by default sends the password unprotected in clear-text
from the mail client to the server. You can protect your e-mail account
password in several ways, including connection encryption as well as not
transmitting the password in clear-text through the network by hashing
with MD5 or some similar algorithm.
Encrypting the connection between the mail client and server is the
only way of truly protecting your mail authentication password. This will
prevent anyone from capturing your password or any of the mail you
might transfer to your client. SSL is generally the method used to
encrypt the connection stream from the mail client to the server and is
supported by most mail clients today.
If you just protect the password through MD5 or a similar cryptoci-
pher, anyone who happens to intercept your “protected” password
could identify it through a brute force attack. A brute force attack is
where someone generates every possible combination of characters run-
ning each version through the same algorithm used to encrypt the orig-
inal password until a match is made and your password is found.
Authentication POP (APOP) is a method used to provide password-
only encryption for mail authentication. It employs a challenge/response
method deﬁned in RFC1725 that uses a shared timestamp provided by
the server being authenticated to. The timestamp is hashed with the
username and the shared secret key through the MD5 algorithm.
There are still a few problems with this, the ﬁrst of which is that all
values are known in advance except the shared secret key. Because of
this, there is nothing to provide protection against a brute-force attack

To solve the problem of authentication through sharing common secret keys
across an untrusted network, the concept of Zero Knowledge Passwords was cre-
ated.The idea of Zero Knowledge Passwords is that the parties who wish to
authenticate each other want to prove to one another that they know the shared
secret, and yet not share the secret with each other in case the other party truly
doesn’t have knowledge of the password, while at the same time preventing
anyone who may intercept the communications between the parties from gaining
knowledge as to the secret that is being used.
Public-key cryptography has been shown to be the strongest method of
doing Zero Knowledge Passwords. It was originally developed by Whitﬁeld Difﬁe
and Martin Hellman and presented to the world at the 1976 National Computer
Conference.Their concept was published a few months later in their paper, New
Directions in Cryptography.Another crypto-researcher named Ralph Merkle,
working independently from Difﬁe and Hellman, also invented a similar method
for providing public-key cryptography, but his research was not published until
1978.
Public-key cryptography introduced the concept of having keys work in
pairs, an encryption key and a decryption key, and having them created in such a
way that generating one key from the other is infeasible.The encryption key is
then made public to anyone wishing to encrypt a message to the holder of the
secret decryption key. Because identifying or creating the decryption key from
the encryption key is infeasible, anyone who happens to have the encrypted mes-
sage and the encryption key will be unable to decrypt the message or determine
the decryption key needed to decrypt the message.
Public-key encryption generally stores the keys or uses a certiﬁcate hierarchy.
The certiﬁcates are rarely changed and often used just for encrypting data, not
authentication. Zero Knowledge Password protocols, on the other hand, tend to use
Ephemeral keys. Ephemeral keys are temporary keys that are randomly created for a
single authentication, and then discarded once the authentication is completed.

on the shared key. Another problem is that this security method
attempts to protect your password. Nothing is done to prevent anyone
who might be listening to your network from then viewing your e-mail
as it is downloaded to your mail client.
You can ﬁnd an example of a brute-force password dictionary gen-
erator that can produce a brute-force dictionary from speciﬁc character
sets at www.dmzs.com/tools/ﬁles.

Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
Note that the public-key encryption is still susceptible to a chosen-ciphertext
attack.This attack is where someone already knows what the decrypted message is
and has knowledge of the key used to generate the encrypted message. Knowing
the decrypted form of the message lets the attacker possibly deduce what the
secret decryption key could be.This attack is unlikely to occur with authentication
systems because the attacker will not have knowledge of the decrypted message:
your password. If they had that, they would already have the ability to authenticate
as you and not need to determine your secret decryption key.
Currently 802.11 network authentication is centered on the authentication of
the wireless device, not on authenticating the user or station utilizing the wireless
network. Public-key encryption is not used in the wireless encryption process.
Although a few wireless vendors have dynamic keys that are changed with every
connection, most wireless 802.11 vendors utilize shared-key authentication with
static keys.
Shared key authentication is utilized by WEP functions with the following
steps:
1. When a station requests service, it sends an authentication frame to the
access point (AP) it wishes to communicate with.
2. The receiving AP replies to the authentication frame with its own,
which contains 128 octets of challenge text.
3. The station requesting access encrypts the challenge text with the shared
encryption key and returns to the AP.
4. The access decrypts the encrypted challenge using the shared key and
compares it with the original challenge text. If they match, an authenti-
cation acknowledgement is sent to the station requesting access, other-
wise a negative authentication notice is sent.
As you can see, this authentication method does not authenticate the user or
any resource the user might need to access. It is only a veriﬁcation that the wire-
less device has knowledge of the shared secret key that the wireless AP has. Once
a user has passed the AP authentication challenge, that user will then have full
access to whatever devices and networks the AP is connected to.You should still
use secure authentication methods to access any of these devices and prevent
unauthorized access and use by people who might be able to attach to your
wireless network.
To solve this lack of external authentication, the IEEE 802.11 committee 
is working on 802.1x, a standard that will provide a framework for 802-based

networks authenticating from centralized servers. Back in November 2000, Cisco
introduced Light Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) authentication to
their wireless products, which adds several enhancements to the 802.11 authenti-
cation system, including the following:
■
Mutual authentication utilizing Remote Access Dial-In User Service
(RADIUS).
■
Securing the secret key with one-way hashes that make password reply
attacks impossible.
■
Policies to force the user to re-authenticate more often, getting a new
session key with each new session.This will help to prevent attacks
where trafﬁc is injected into the data stream.
■
Changes to the initialization vector used in WEP encryption that make
the current exploits of WEP ineffective.
Not all vendors support these solutions, so your best bet is to protect your
network and servers with your own strong authentication and authorization
rules.
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) was designed to provide authenti-
cation methods within the Point-to-Point-Protocol (PPP). EAP allows for the
integration of third-party authentication packages that use PPP. EAP can be con-
ﬁgured so that it can support a number of methods for authentication schemes,
such as token cards, public key, certiﬁcates, PINs, and on and on.
When you install PPP/EAP, EAP will not select a speciﬁc authentication
method at the Link Control Protocol (LCP) Phase, but will wait until the
Authentication Phase to begin.What this does is allow the authenticator the
ability to request more information, and with this information it will decide on
the method of authentication to use.This delay will also allow for the implemen-
tation of a server on the backend that can control the various authentication
methods while the PPP authenticator passes through the authentication
exchange.
In this way, network devices like APs or switches do not need to understand
each request type, because they will simply act as a conduit, or passthrough agent,
for a server on a host.The network device will only need to see if the packet has
the success or failure code in order to terminate the authentication phase.

Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
EAP is able to deﬁne one or more requests for peer-to-peer authentication.
This can happen because the request packet includes a type ﬁeld, such as Generic
Token, one-time password (OTP), or an MD5 challenge.The MD5 challenge is
very similar to the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP).
EAP is able to provide you with a ﬂexible, link-layer security framework (see
Figure 8.2), by having the following features:
■
EAP mechanisms are IETF standards–based and allow for the growth of
new authentication types when your security needs change:
■
Transport Layer Security (TLS)
■
Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
■
GSS_API (Kerberos)
■
Other authentication schemes (LEAP)
■
There is no dependency on IP, because this is an encapsulation protocol.
■
There is no windowing as this is a simple ACK/NAK protocol.
■
No support for fragmentation.
■
Can run over any link layer (PPP, 802.3, 802.5, 802.11, and so on).
■
Does not consider a physically secure link as an authentication method
to provide security.
■
Assumes that there is no reordering of packets.
■
Retransmission of packets is the responsibility of authenticator.

802.1x and EAP
One type of wireless security is focused on providing centralized authentication
and dynamic key distribution area. By using the IEEE 802.1x standard, the EAP,
and the Cisco Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) as an end-
to-end solution, you can provide enhanced functionality to your wireless net-
work.Two main elements are involved in using this standard:
■
EAP/LEAP allows all wireless client adapters the capability to commu-
nicate with different authentication servers such as RADIUS and
Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS+) servers
that are located on the network.
■
You implement the IEEE 802.1x standard for network access control
that is port based for MAC ﬁltering.
When these features are deployed together, wireless clients that are associated
with APs will not be able to gain access to the network unless the user performs
a network logon.The user will need to enter a username and password for net-
work logon, after which the client and a RADIUS server will perform authenti-
cation, hopefully leading to the client being authenticated by the supplied
username and password and access to the network and resources.
How this occurs is that the RADIUS server and client device will then
receive a client-speciﬁc WEP key that is used by the client for that speciﬁc logon
session.As an added level of security, the user’s password and session key will
never be transmitted in the open, over the wireless connection.
Here is how Authentication works and the WEP key is passed:
1. The wireless client will associate with an AP located on the wireless 
network.
2. The AP will then prevent all other attempts made by that client to gain
access to network until the client logs on to the network.
3. The client will supply a username and password for network logon.
4. Using 802.1x standard and EAP/LEAP, the wireless client and a
RADIUS server perform authentication through the AP.The client will
then use a one-way hash of the user-supplied password as a response to
the challenge, and this will be sent to the RADIUS server.The
RADIUS server will then reference its user table and compare that to
the response from the client. If there is a match, the RADIUS server
www.syngress.com

388
Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
authenticates the client, and the process will be repeated, but in reverse.
This will enable the client to authenticate the RADIUS server.
(If you are using LEAP, the RADIUS server will send an authentica-
tion challenge to the client.)
After authentication completes successfully, the following steps take place:
1. The RADIUS server and the client determine a WEP key that is unique
for the client and that session.
2. The RADIUS server transmits this WEP key (also known as a session
key), across the wired LAN to the AP.
3. The AP will encrypt the broadcast key and the session key so that it can
then send the new encrypted key to the client.The client will then use
the session key to decrypt it.
4. The client and AP then activates the WEP.The APs and clients will then
use the session and broadcast WEP keys for all communications that
occur during the session.
5. For enhanced security, the session key and broadcast key are regularly
changed at regular periods that are conﬁgured in the RADIUS server.
A more simpliﬁed version is included in Figure 8.3.

An Introduction to the 802.1x Standard
In order to better understand 802.1x, you must also understand the enhance-
ments of current IEEE 802.11b security products and features.The current IEEE
802.11b standard is severely limited because it is available only for the current
open and shared key authentication scheme, which is non-extensible.
Some of these requirements for the future security include the following:
■
The creation of new 802.11 authentication methods.
■
These authentication methods must be independent of the underlying
802.11 hardware.
■
Authentication methods should be dynamic because hard coding it
makes it difﬁcult to ﬁx security holes when they are found.
■
It must have the ability to support Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and
certiﬁcate schemes.
Project Authorization Request (PAR) for 802.1x
Currently, no standard mechanism allows access to and from a network segment
based only on the authenticated state of a port user.The problem is that network
connectivity allows for the anonymous access to company data and the Internet.
When 802-based networks are deployed in more accessible areas, you will need a
method to authenticate and authorize basic network access.These types of pro-
jects provide for common interoperable solutions that use standards-based
authentication and authorization infrastructures like those that are commonly
supporting schemes such as dial-up access already.
The Objectives of the 802.1x Standard
The IEEE 802.1x Working Group was created for the purpose of providing a
security framework for port-based access control that resides in the upper layers.
The most common method for port-based access control is to enable new
authentication and key management methods without changing current network
devices.
The beneﬁts that are the end result of this group are as follows:
■
There is a signiﬁcant decrease in hardware cost and complexity.
■
There are more options, which allows you to pick and choose your
security solution.
www.syngress.com

390
Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
■
You can install the latest and greatest security technology, and it should
still work with your existing infrastructure.
■
You are able to respond to security issues as quickly as they arise.
802.1x in a Nutshell
When a client device connects to a port on an 802.1x switch and AP, the switch
port can determine the authenticity of the devices. Due to this and, according to
the protocol speciﬁed by 802.1x, the services offered by the switch can be made
available on that port. Only EAPOL (see the following list) frames can be sent and
received on that port until the authentication is complete.When the device is
properly authentication, the port switches trafﬁc as though it were a regular port.
Here is some terminology for the 802.1x standard that you should familiarize
yourself with:
■
Port  A port is a single point of connection to the network.
■
Port Access Entity (PAE)  The PAE controls the algorithms and pro-
tocols that are associated with the authentication mechanisms for a port.
■
Authenticator PAE  The authenticator PAE enforces authentication
before it will allow access resources located off of that port.
■
Supplicant PAE  The supplicant PAE tries to accesses the services that
are allowed by the authenticator.
■
Authentication Server  The Authentication Server is used to verify
the supplicant PAE. It decides whether the supplicant is authorized to
access the authenticator or not.
■
Extensible Authentication Protocol Over LAN (EAPOL) The
802.1x deﬁnes a standard for encapsulating EAP messages so that they
can be handled directly by a LAN MAC service. 802.1x tries to make
authentication more encompassing, rather than enforcing speciﬁc mech-
anisms on the devices. Because of this, 802.1x uses Extensible
Authentication Protocol to receive authentication information.
■
Extensible Authentication Protocol Over Wireless (EAPOW)
When EAPOL messages are encapsulated over 802.11 wireless frames,
they are known as EAPOW.

Making it Come Together—User 
Identiﬁcation and Strong Authentication
With the addition of the 802.1x standard, clients are identiﬁed by usernames, not
the MAC address of the devices.This was designed to not only enhance security,
but to streamline the process for authentication, authorization, and accountability
for your network. 802.1x was designed so that it could support extended forms
of authentication, using password methods (such as one-time passwords, or
GSS_API mechanisms like Kerberos) and nonpassword methods (such as biomet-
rics, Internet Key Exchange [IKE], and smart cards).
Key Derivation Can Be Dynamic
You can also use per-user session keys, because the 802.1x standard allows for the
creation of them. Because you don’t need to keep WEP keys at the client device
or AP, you can dispense per-user, and/or per session–based WEP keys.These WEP
keys will be dynamically created at the client for every session, thus making it
more secure.The Global key, like a broadcast WEP key, can be encrypted using a
unicast session key and then sent from the AP to the client in a much more
secure manner.
Mutual Authentication
When using 802.1x and EAP, you should use some form of mutual authentica-
tion.This will make the client and the authentication servers mutually authenti-
cating end-points and will assist in the mitigation of attacks from man in the
middle types of devices.To enable mutual authentication, you could use any of
the following EAP methods:
■
TLS  This requires that the server supply a certiﬁcate and establish that
it has possession of the private key.
■
IKE This requires that the server show possession of preshared key or
private key (this can be considered certiﬁcate authentication).
■
GSS_API (Kerberos) This requires that the server can demonstrate
knowledge of the session key.

392
Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
NOTE
Cisco Systems has also created a lightweight mutual authentication
scheme, called LEAP (discussed later), so that your network is able to sup-
port operating systems that do not normally support EAP. LEAP also offers
the capability to have alternate certiﬁcate schemes such as EAP-TLS.
Per-Packet Authentication
EAP can support per-packet authentication and integrity protection, but this
authentication and integrity protection is not extended to all types of EAP mes-
sages. For example, NAK (negative acknowledgment) and notiﬁcation messages
are not able to use per-packet authentication and integrity. Per-packet authentica-
tion and integrity protection works for the following (packet is encrypted unless
otherwise noted):
■
TLS and IKE derive session key
■
TLS ciphersuite negotiations (not encrypted)
■
IKE ciphersuite negotiations
■
Kerberos tickets
■
Success and failure messages that use derived session key (through WEP)
www.syngress.com
Preventing Dictionary Attacks Using EAP
EAP was designed to support extended authentication. When you imple-
ment EAP, you can avoid dictionary attacks by using nonpassword-based
schemes such as biometrics, certiﬁcates, OTP, smart cards, and token
cards.
You should be sure that if you are using password-based schemes
that they use some form of mutual authentication so that they are more
protected against dictionary attacks.
Designing & Planning…

Cisco Wireless Security • Chapter 8
393
Possible Implementation of EAP on the WLAN
There are two main authentication methods for EAP on your wireless LAN: One
is EAP-MD5, and the other is to use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) with EAP-
TLS. EAP-MD5 has a couple of issues because it does not support the capability
for mutual authentication between the access server and the wireless client.The
PKI schemes also has drawbacks, because it is very computation-intensive on the
client systems, you need a high degree of planning and design to make sure that
your network is capable of supporting PKI, and it is not cheap.
Cisco Light Extensible 
Authentication Protocol (LEAP)
LEAP is an enhancement to the EAP protocol, and as you remember, the EAP
protocol was created in an effort to provide a scalable method for a PPP-based
server to authenticate its clients and, hopefully allow for mutual authentication.
An extensible packet exchange should allow for the passing of authentication
information between the client devices and the PPP servers.The thing is that
PPP servers usually rely on a centralized authentication server system that can
validate the clients for them.This is where a RADIUS or a TACACS+ server
usually comes into play.
This reason that the servers can work is that the servers have a protocol that
will enable them to pass EAP packets between the authentication server and the
PPP server. Essentially this makes the PPP server a passthrough or a relay agent,
so that the authentication process happens between the client and the RADIUS
server.The RADIUS server will then tell the PPP server the results of the
authentication process (pass/fail) that will allow the client to access the network
and its resources.
To make sure that all types of network access servers could be implemented
to validate clients to network resources, the EAP protocol was created. Because
we are talking about wireless connections though, the link between the AP and
the client is not PPP but WLAN.
When the 802.11 speciﬁcations were standardized, it allowed for the encryp-
tion of data trafﬁc between APs and clients through the use of a WEP encryption
key.When it was ﬁrst implemented, the AP would have a single key, and this key
had to be conﬁgured on each client.All trafﬁc would be encrypted using this
single key.Well, this type of security has a lot of issues. In current implementa-
tions that use EAP authentication, the client and RADIUS server have a shared
www.syngress.com

Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
secret; generally this is some permutation of a username and password combina-
tion.The server will then pass certain information to the AP so that the client
and AP can derive encryption keys that are unique for this client-AP pair.This is
called Cisco LEAP authentication.
The previous section discussed the implementation methods of EAP (EAP-
MD5, and PKI with EAP-TLS), and some of the issues that you can expect to
see when you plan to implement them. LEAP may be a better option because it
can offer mutual authentication, it needs only minimal support from the client’s
CPU, it can support embedded systems, and it can support clients whose oper-
ating system does not have the support for native EAP or allow for the use of the
PKI authentication.
LEAP authentication works through three phases: the start phase, the authenti-
cate phase, and the ﬁnish phase.The following sections show the process that the
client and AP go through so that the client can also talk to the RADIUS server.
Start Phase for LEAP Authentication
In the start phase, information (in packet form) is transferred between the client
and APs:
1. The EAPOW-Start (this is also called EAPOL-Start in 802.1x for wired
networks) starts the authentication process.This packed is sent from the
client to the AP.
2. The EAP-Request/Identity is sent from the AP to the client with a
request for the clients Identity.
3. The EAP-Response/Identity is sent from the client to the AP with the
required information.
Authentication Phase for LEAP Authentication
This sequence will change based on the mutual authentication method you
choose for the client and the authentication server. If you were to use TLS for
the transfer of certiﬁcates in a PKI deployment, EAP-TLS messages will be used,
but because we are talking about LEAP, it would go more like this:
1. The client sends an EAP-Response/Identity message to the RADIUS
server through the AP as a RADIUS-Access-Request with EAP exten-
sions.
2. The RADIUS server then returns access-request with a RADIUS-
challenge, to which the client must respond.
www.syngress.com

Cisco Wireless Security • Chapter 8
395
Cisco LEAP authentication is a mutual authentication method, and the AP is
only a passthrough.The AP in the authenticate phase forwards the contents of the
packets from EAP to RADIUS and from Radius to EAP.
The (Big) Finish Phase of LEAP Authentication
The steps for the ﬁnish phase are as follows:
1. If the client is considered invalid, the RADIUS server will send a
RADIUS deny packet with an EAP fail packet embedded within it. If
the client is considered to be valid, the server will send a RADIUS
request packet with an EAP success attribute.
2. The RADIUS-Access-Accept packet contains the MS-MPPE-Send-Key
attribute to the AP, where it obtains the session key that will be used by
client.
The RADIUS server and client both create a session key from the user’s pass-
word, when using LEAP.The encryption for the IEEE 802.11 standard can be
based on a 40/64-bit or 104/128-bit key. Note that the key derivation process
will create a key that is longer than is required.This is so that when the AP
receives the key from the RADIUS server (using MS-MPPE-Send-Key
attribute), it will send an EAPOL-KEY message to the client.This key will tell
the client the key length and what key index that it should use.
The key value isn’t sent because the client has already created it on its own
WEP key.The data packet is then encrypted using the full-length key.The AP
will also send an EAPOL-KEY message that gives information about the length,
key index, and value of the multicast key.This message is encrypted using the
full-length session unicast key from the AP.
Conﬁguration and Deployment of LEAP
In this section, we talk about the installation and requirements for a LEAP solu-
tion that consists of a client, an AP and a RADIUS server for key distribution in
your network.
Client Support for LEAP
You can conﬁgure your client to use LEAP mode in one of two modes:
■
Network Logon Mode In Network Logon Mode, an integrated net-
work logon provides for a single-sign on for both the wireless network
www.syngress.com

396
Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
as well as Microsoft Networking.This will provide users with a trans-
parent security experience.This is probably the most common method
of authenticating into the wireless network (or the wired network).
■
Device Mode In Device Mode, the wireless LAN stores the user-
name/password identiﬁcation, so that you can get non-interactive
authentication into the wireless LAN.You will often see this on wireless
appliances where the devices that can authenticate themselves through
these preconﬁgured credentials are enough security.
Access Point Support for LEAP
Access points can provide 802.1x for 802.11 Authenticator support. In order to
make this work, you need to take the following two steps in setting up 802.1x
authenticator support:
■
You need to conﬁgure the AP to use 40/64- or 104/128-bit WEP mode.
■
You must give the LEAP RADIUS server address and conﬁgure the
shared secret key that the AP and RADIUS server use, so that they can
communicate securely.
Conﬁguring your RADIUS server for LEAP
To conﬁgure the RADIUS server for authentication and key distribution users,
you will need to do the following:
■
You need to create the user databases.
■
You need to conﬁgure the APs as Network Access Servers (NASs).This
will enable users that are conﬁgured with Cisco-Aironet RADIUS
extensions on the NAS to use RADIUS. RADIUS requests from the AP
with EAP extensions are passed as described earlier.
Ensuring Authorization
Authorization is the rights and permissions granted to a user or application that
enables access to a network or computing resource. Once a user has been prop-
erly identiﬁed and authenticated, authorization levels determine the extent of
system rights that the user has access to.
Many of the early operating systems and applications deployed had very 
small authorization groups. Generally, only user groups and operator groups were
www.syngress.com

Cisco Wireless Security • Chapter 8
397
available for deﬁning a user’s access level. Once more formal methods for
approaching various authorization levels were deﬁned, applications and servers
started offering more discrete authorization levels.You can observe this by simply
looking at any standard back-ofﬁce application deployed today.
Many of them provide varying levels of access for users and administrators.
For example, they could have several levels of user accounts allowing some users
access to just view the information, while giving others the ability to update or
query that information and have administrative accounts based on the authoriza-
tion levels needed (such as being able to look up only speciﬁc types of customers,
or run particular reports while other accounts have the ability to edit and create
new accounts).
As shown in the previous authentication example, Cisco and others have
implemented RADIUS authentication for their wireless devices. Now, utilizing
stronger authentication methods, you can implement your authorization policies
into your wireless deployments.
However, many wireless devices do not currently support external authoriza-
tion validation. Plus, most deployments just ensure authorized access to the device.
They do not control access to or from speciﬁc network segments.To fully restrict
authorized users to the network devices they are authorized to utilize, you will still
need to deploy an adaptive ﬁrewall between the AP and your network.
This is what was done earlier this year by two researchers at NASA (for more
information, see www.nas.nasa.gov/Groups/Networks/Projects/Wireless).To pro-
tect their infrastructure, but still provide access through wireless, they deployed a
ﬁrewall segmenting their wireless and department network.They most likely
hardened their wireless interfaces to the extent of the equipments’ possibilities by
utilizing the strongest encryption available to them, disabling SID broadcast, and
allowing only authorized MAC addresses on the wireless network.
They then utilized the Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) on
the ﬁrewall, and disabled it on their AP.This allowed them to expressly deﬁne
which MAC addresses could receive an IP address, and what the lease lifetime of
the IP address would be.
The researchers then went on to turn off all routing and forwarding between
the wireless interface and the internal network. If anyone happened to be able to
connect to the wireless network, they would still have no access to the rest of the
computing resources of the department.Anyone wishing to gain further access
would have to go to an SSL protected Web site on the ﬁrewall server and authen-
ticate as a valid user.The Web server would authenticate the user against a local
www.syngress.com

398
Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
RADIUS server, but they could have easily used any other form of user authenti-
cation (NT, SecurID, and so on).
Once the user was properly authenticated, the ﬁrewall would change the ﬁre-
wall rules for the IP address that user was supposed to be assigned to, allowing
full access to only the network resources they are authorized to access.
Finally, once the lease expired or was released for any reason from the DHCP
assigned IP address, the ﬁrewall rules would be removed and that user and their
IP would have to re-authenticate through the Web interface to allow access to
the network resources again.
MAC Filtering
In order to fully discuss the advantages and disadvantages of MAC ﬁltering, let’s
have a short review on what a MAC address is.The term MAC stands for Media
Access Control, and forms the lower layer in the Data-Link layer of the OSI
model.The purpose of the MAC sublayer is to present a uniform interface
between the physical networking media (copper/ﬁber/radio frequency) and the
Logical Link Control portion of the Data-Link layer.These two layers are found
onboard a NIC, whether integrated into a device or used as an add-on (PCI card
or PCMCIA card).
What Is a MAC Address?
In order to facilitate delivery of network trafﬁc, the MAC layer is assigned a unique
address, which is programmed into the NIC at the time of manufacture.The oper-
ating system will associate an IP address with this MAC address, which allows the
device to participate in an IP network. Because no other NIC in the world should
have the same MAC address, it is easy to see why it could be a secure way to
equate a speciﬁc user with the MAC address on his or her machine.
Now, let’s look at an actual MAC address. For example, my laptop has a MAC
address of 00-00-86-4C-75-48.The ﬁrst three octets are called the organization-
ally unique identiﬁer (OUI).The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers
controls these OUIs and assigns them to companies as needed. If you look up the
00-00-86 OUI on the IEEE’s Web site (http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/
index.shtml), it will state that the manufacturer of this NIC is the 3Com
Corporation.
Corporations can own several OUIs, and often acquire additional OUIs when
they purchase other companies. For example, when Cisco purchased Aironet

Wireless Communications in 1999, they added the 00-40-96 OUI to the many
others they have.
Some other OUIs you could see on your WLAN might be the following:
■
00-02-2D Agere Communications (previously known as ORiNOCO)
■
00-10-E7 Breezecom
■
00-E0-03 Nokia Wireless

The remaining three octets in a MAC address are usually burned into the
NIC during manufacture, thus assuring that duplicate addresses will not exist on
a network.We say “usually” because this rule has a few exceptions. For example,
in some redundancy situations, one NIC on a machine is able to assume the
MAC address of the other NIC if the primary NIC fails. Some early 802.11
PCMCIA cards also had the capability to change their MAC address.Although
not necessarily easy to do, changing the MAC address gives a user the ability to
spoof the MAC address of another PCMCIA card.This could be used to circum-
vent MAC ﬁltering or be employed in a denial of service (DoS) attack against a
speciﬁc user.
Where in the Authentication/Association
Process Does MAC Filtering Occur?
When a wireless device wants to connect to a WLAN, it goes though a two-part
process called authentication and authorization.After both have been completed,
the device is allowed access to the WLAN.
As mentioned earlier, when a wireless device is attempting to connect to a
WLAN, it sends an authentication request to the AP (see Figure 8.4).This request
will contain the SSID of the target network, or a null value if connecting to an
open system.The AP will grant or deny authentication based on this string.
Following a successful authentication, the requesting device will attempt to asso-
ciate with the AP. It is at this point in time that MAC ﬁltering plays its role.
Depending on the AP vendor and administrative setup of the AP, MAC ﬁltering
either allows only the speciﬁed MAC addresses—blocking the rest, or it allows all
MAC addresses—blocking speciﬁcally noted MACs. If the MAC address is
allowed, the requesting device is allowed to associate with the AP.

Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
Determining MAC Filtering Is Enabled
The easiest way to determine if a device has failed the association process due to
MAC ﬁltering is through the use of a protocol analyzer, like Sniffer Pro or
AiroPeek.The difﬁculty here is that other factors besides MAC ﬁltering could
prevent association from occurring. RADIUS or 802.1x authentication, or an
incorrect WEP key could also prevent this.These of course are costly mechanisms
commonly seen in large corporate environments. Due to the costs involved with
setting up the higher forms of non-AP-based authentication, most small busi-
nesses or home installations will use MAC ﬁltering to limit access (if they use
anything at all).
MAC Spooﬁng
If you discover that your MAC address is not allowed to associate with the AP,
don’t give up.There are other ways into the network besides the front door.
First off, just because you can’t associate with the AP doesn’t mean you can’t
sit there and passively watch the trafﬁc.With 802.11b protocol analysis software,
your laptop can see all the other stations’ communication with any AP within
range. Because the MAC addresses of the other stations are transmitted in clear
text, it should be easy to start compiling a list of the MAC addresses allowed on
the network.
Some early runs of 802.11 PCMCIA cards had the capability to modify their
MAC addresses. Depending on the card and the level of ﬁrmware, the method to

change your MAC address may vary.There are sites on the Internet that can give
you more speciﬁc information on altering these parameters.
Once you have modiﬁed the MAC address, you should be able to associate it
with the AP. Keep in mind however, that if the device bearing the MAC address
you have stolen is still operating on the network, you will not be able to use your
device.To allow the operation of two duplicate MAC addresses will break ARP
tables and will attract a level of attention to your activities that is undesirable.The
advanced hacker we are discussing would realize this. In attempts to subvert the
security mechanisms, trafﬁc would be monitored to sufﬁciently pattern the
intended victim whose MAC address and identiﬁcation are to be forged in order
to avoid detection.
Ensuring Non-Repudiation
Repudiation is deﬁned by West’s Encyclopedia of American Law as “the rejection
or refusal of a duty, relation, right or privilege.”A repudiation of a transaction or
contract means that one of the parties refuses to honor their obligation to the other
as speciﬁed by the contract. Non-repudiation could then be deﬁned as the ability
to deny, with irrefutable evidence, a false rejection or refusal of an obligation.
In their paper “Non-Repudiation in the Digital Environment,”Adrian
McCullagh and William Caelli put forth an excellent review of the traditional
model of non-repudiation and the current trends for crypto-technical non-repu-
diation.The paper was published online by First Monday—you can ﬁnd it at
www.ﬁrstmonday.dk/issues/issue5_8/mccullagh/index.html.
The basis for a repudiation of a traditional contract is sometimes associated
with the belief that the signature binding a contract is a forgery, or that the signa-
ture is not a forgery but was obtained via unconscionable conduct by a party to
the transaction, by fraud instigated by a third party, or undue inﬂuence exerted by
a third party. In typical cases of fraud or repudiated contracts, the general rule of
evidence is that if a person denies a particular signature, the burden of proving
that the signature is valid falls upon the receiving party.
Common law trust mechanisms establish that in order to overcome false
claims of non-repudiation, a trusted third party needs to act as a witness to the
signature being afﬁxed. Having a witness to the signature of a document, who is
independent of the transactions taking place, reduces the likelihood that a signor
is able to successfully allege that the signature is a forgery. However, there is
always the possibility that the signatory will be able to deny the signature on the
basis of the situations listed in the preceding paragraph.
www.syngress.com

402
Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
A perfect example of a non-repudiation of submissions can be viewed by
examining the process around sending and receiving registered mail.When you
send a registered letter, you are given a receipt containing an identiﬁcation
number for the piece of mail sent. If the recipient claims that the mail was not
sent, the receipt is proof that provides the non-repudiation of the submission. If a
receipt is available with the recipient’s signature, this provides the proof for the
non-repudiation of the delivery service.The postal service provides the non-
repudiation of transport service by acting as a Trusted Third Party (TTP).
Non-repudiation, in technical terms, has come to mean the following:
■
In authentication, a service that provides proof of the integrity and
origin of data both in an unforgeable relationship, which can be veriﬁed
by any third party at any time; or
■
In authentication, an authentication that with high assurance can be
asserted to be genuine, and that cannot subsequently be refuted.
The Australian Federal Government’s Electronic Commerce Expert group
further adopted this technical meaning in their 1998 report to the Australian
Federal Attorney General as:
Non-repudiation is a property achieved through cryptographic
methods which prevents an individual or entity from denying
having performed a particular action related to data (such as mech-
anisms for non-rejection or authority (origin); for proof of obliga-
tion, intent, or commitment; or for proof of ownership.
In the digital realm, a movement is in place to shift the responsibility of
proving that a digital signature is invalid to the owner of the signature, not the
receiver of the signature, as is typically used in traditional common law methods.
In only a few examples does the burden of proof fall upon the alleged signer.
One such example is usually found in taxation cases where the taxpayer has made
speciﬁc claims and as such is in a better position to disprove the revenue col-
lecting body’s case.Another example would be in an instance of negligence. In a
negligence action, if a plaintiff is able to prove that a defendant failed to meet
their commitment, the burden of proof is in effect shifted to the defendant to
establish that they have met their obligations.
The problem found in the new digital repudiation deﬁnitions that have been
created is that they take into consideration only the validity of the signature itself.
They do not allow for the possibility that the signor was tricked or forced into
www.syngress.com

Cisco Wireless Security • Chapter 8
403
signing, or that their private key may be compromised, allowing the forgery of
digital signatures.
With all the recent cases of Internet worms and viruses, it is not hard to
imagine that one might be speciﬁcally built to steal private keys.A virus could be
something as simple as a Visual Basic macro attached to a Word document, or an
e-mail message that would search the targets hard drive looking for commonly
named and located private key rings that could then be e-mailed or uploaded to
some rogue location.
With this and other possible attacks to the private keys, it becomes difﬁcult,
under the common law position, for someone attempting to prove the identity of
an alleged signatory.This common law position was established and founded in a
paper-based environment where witnessing became the trusted mechanism utilized
to prevent the non-repudiation of a signature. For a digital signature to be proven
valid, however, it will need to be established through a fully trusted mechanism.
Thus, for a digitally signed contract to be trusted and not susceptible to repu-
diation, the entire document handling and signature process must take place
within a secured and trusted computing environment.As we will see in some of
the documentation to follow, the security policies and deﬁnitions created over the
years have established a set of requirements necessary to create a secure and
trusted computer system.
If we follow the deﬁnitions established in the Information Technology
Security Evaluation Certiﬁcation (ITSEC) to create a trusted computing envi-
ronment of at least E3 to enforce functions and design of the signing process and
thus prevent unauthorized access to the private key, the common law position for
digitally signed documents can be maintained. E3 also ensures that the signing
function is the only function able to be performed by the signing mechanism by
having the source code evaluated to ensure that this is the only process available
through the code. If these security features are implemented, it can be adequately
assessed that under this mechanism the private key has not been stolen and as
such that any digital signature created under this model has the trust established
to ensure the TTP witness and validation of any signature created, preventing any
possible repudiation from the signor.
One such example of a secure infrastructure designed and deployed to
attempt to provide a digitally secure TTP are the PKI systems available for users
of unsecure public networks such as the Internet. PKI consists of a secure com-
puting system that acts as a certiﬁcate authority (CA) to issue and verify digital
certiﬁcates. Digital certiﬁcates contain the public key and other identiﬁcation
information needed to verify the validity of the certiﬁcate.As long as the trust in
www.syngress.com

404
Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
the CA is maintained (and with it, the trust in the security of the private key),
the digital certiﬁcates issued by the CA and the documents signed by them
remain trusted.As long as the trust is ensured, then the CA acts as a TTP and
provides for the non-repudiation of signatures created by entities with digital cer-
tiﬁcates issued through the CA.
Accounting and Audit Trails
Auditing provides methods for tracking and logging activities on networks and
systems, and it links these activities to speciﬁc user accounts or sources of activity.
In case of simple mistakes or software failures, audit trails can be extremely useful
in restoring data integrity.They are also a requirement for trusted systems to
ensure that the activity of authorized individuals on the trusted system can be
traced to their speciﬁc actions, and that those actions comply with deﬁned policy.
They also allow for a method of collecting evidence to support any investigation
into improper or illegal activities.
Most modern database applications support some level of transaction log
detailing the activities that occurred within the database.This log could then be
used to either rebuild the database if it had any errors or create a duplicate database
at another location.To provide this detailed level of transactional logging, database
logging tends to consume a great deal of drive space for its enormous log ﬁle.This
intense logging is not needed for most applications, so you will generally have only
basic informative messages utilized in system resource logging.
The logging features provided on most networks and systems involve the log-
ging of known or partially known resource event activities.Although these logs
are sometimes used for analyzing system problems, they are also useful for those
whose duty it is to process the log ﬁles and check for both valid and invalid
system activities.
To assist in catching mistakes and reducing the likelihood of fraudulent activi-
ties, the activities of a process should be split among several people.This segmen-
tation of duties allows the next person in line to possibly correct problems simply
because they are being viewed with fresh eyes.
From a security point of view, segmentation of duties requires the collusion
of at least two people to perform any unauthorized activities.The following
guidelines assist in assuring that the duties are split so as to offer no way other
than collusion to perform invalid activities:
■
No access to sensitive combinations of capabilities A classic
example of this is control of inventory data and physical inventory. By
www.syngress.com

Cisco Wireless Security • Chapter 8
405
separating the physical inventory control from the inventory data con-
trol, you remove the unnecessary temptation for an employee to steal
from inventory and then alter the data so that the theft is left hidden.
■
Prohibit conversion and concealment Another violation that can
be prevented by segregation is ensuring that supervision is provided for
people who have access to assets.An example of an activity that could be
prevented if properly segmented follows a lone operator of a night shift.
This operator, without supervision, could copy (or “convert”) customer
lists and then sell them off to interested parties. Instances have been
reported of operators actually using the employer’s computer to run a
service bureau at night.
■
The same person cannot both originate and approve transac-
tions When someone is able to enter and authorize their own
expenses, it introduces the possibility that they might fraudulently enter
invalid expenses for their own gain.
These principles, whether manual or electronic, form the basis for why audit
logs are retained.They also identify why people other than those performing 
the activities reported in the log should be the ones who analyze the data in 
the log ﬁle.
In keeping with the idea of segmentation, as you deploy your audit trails, be
sure to have your logs sent to a secure, trusted, location that is separate and non-
accessible from the devices you are monitoring.This will help ensure that if any
inappropriate activity occurs, the person can’t falsify the log to state that the
actions did not take place.
Most wireless APs do not offer any method of logging activity, but if your
equipment provides the feature, you should enable it and then monitor it for
inappropriate activity using tools such as logcheck.Wireless AP logging should, if
it’s available, log any new wireless device with its MAC address upon valid WEP
authentication. It should also log any attempts to access or modify the AP itself.
Using Encryption
Encryption has always played a key role in information security, and has been the
center of controversy in the design of the WEP wireless standard. But despite the
drawbacks, encryption will continue to play a major role in wireless security,
especially with the adoption of new and better encryption algorithms and key
management systems.

406
Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
As we have seen in reviewing the basic concepts of security, many of the
principles used to ensure the conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of servers
and services are through the use of some form of trusted and tested encryption.
We also have seen that even with encryption, if we get tied up too much in the
acceptance of the hard mathematics as evidence of validity, it is possible to be
tricked into accepting invalid authorization or authentication attempts by
someone who has been able to corrupt the encryption system itself by either
acquiring the private key through cryptanalysis or stealing the private key from
the end user directly.
Cryptography offers the obvious advantage that the material it protects
cannot be used without the keys needed to unlock it.As long as those keys are
protected, the material remains protected.There are a few potential disadvantages
to encryption as well. For instance, if the key is lost, the data becomes unavailable,
and if the key is stolen, the data becomes accessible to the thief.
The process of encryption also introduces possible performance degradation.
When a message is to be sent encrypted, time must be spent to ﬁrst encrypt the
information, then store and transmit the encrypted data, and then later decode it.
In theory, this can slow a system by as much as a factor of three.
Until recently, distribution and use of strong encryption was limited and con-
trolled by most governments.The United States government had encryption
listed as munitions, right next to cruise missiles! As such, it was very difﬁcult to
legally acquire and use strong encryption through the entire Internet.With the
new changes in trade laws, however, it is now possible to use stronger encryption
for internal use as well as with communications with customers and other third
parties.
Encrypting Voice Data
Voice communications have traditionally been a very simple medium to intercept
and monitor.When digital cell and wireless phones arrived, there was a momen-
tary window in which monitoring voice communications across these digital
connections was difﬁcult.Today, the only equipment needed to monitor cell
phones or digital wireless telephones can be acquired at a local Radio Shack for
generally less than $100.
Most voice communication systems are not designed to ensure the privacy of
the conversations on them, so a new industry was created to facilitate those
needs. Originally designed for government and military usage, telephone encryp-
tion devices give people the option of encrypting their daily calls.A few of these
devices are starting to make their way into the commercial market.Although a
www.syngress.com

Cisco Wireless Security • Chapter 8

few are being slowed down by organizations such as the National Security
Agency (NSA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), who argue that it
will prevent their “legal” monitoring of criminal activities, consumer market
needs should eventually push these devices into the mainstream.
The Internet, being a communications network, offers people the ability to
communicate with anyone, anywhere. Because of this, it didn’t take long for the
appearance of applications enabling voice communications across the Internet.
Many of the early versions, like all budding technologies, did not offer any pro-
tection methods for their users.As a result, people utilizing Internet voice com-
munications programs could have their communications monitored by someone
with access to the data stream between parties. Fortunately, encryption is making
its way into some of these programs, and if you’re careful, you should be able to
ﬁnd one that uses modern tested and secure encryption algorithms such as
Twoﬁsh, a popular and publicly-available encryption algorithm created by Bruce
Schneier.
Encrypting Data Systems
Data networks have traditionally been susceptible to threats from a trusted insider.
However, as soon as someone connects their network to another entity, it intro-
duces possible security compromises from outside sources. Remember, all forms
of data communications, from simple modem lines to frame-relay and ﬁber-optic
connections, can be monitored.
Reviewing the Role of Policy
Good policy is your ﬁrst line of defense.A properly designed policy examines
every threat (or tries to) and ensures that conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability
are maintained (or at least cites the known and accepted risks).As we shall see,
policy deﬁnition begins with a clear identiﬁcation and labeling of resources being
utilized that will build into speciﬁc standards that deﬁne acceptable use in what’s
considered an authorized and secure manner. Once a basic standard is deﬁned,
you start building speciﬁc guidelines and procedures for individual applications
and services.
Many wireless manufacturers have responded to security threats hampering
their initial product versions by releasing upgrades to their software and drivers.
Your security policy should always require that all technology, either existing or
newly deployed, have the latest security patches and upgrades installed in a timely
manner. However, because the development and release of patches takes time,
www.syngress.com

408
Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
policy and its proper implementation tend to be the ﬁrst layer of defense when
confronting known and unknown threats.
A well-written policy should be more than just a list of recommended proce-
dures. It should be an essential and fundamental element of your organization’s
security practices.A good policy can provide protection from liability due to an
employee’s actions, or can form a basis for the control of trade secrets.A policy or
standard should also continue to grow and expand as new threats and technolo-
gies become available.They should be constructed with the input of an entire
organization and audited both internally and externally to ensure that the assets
they are protecting have the controls in place as speciﬁed in the standards, poli-
cies, and guidelines.
www.syngress.com
The Management Commitment
Management must be aware of their needed commitment to the secu-
rity of corporate assets, which includes protection of information.
Measures must be taken to protect it from unauthorized modiﬁcation,
destruction, or disclosure (whether accidental or intentional), and
ensure its authenticity, integrity, availability and conﬁdentiality.
Fundamental to the success of any security program is senior man-
agement’s commitment to the information security process and their
understanding of how important security controls and protections are
to the enterprise’s continuity.
The senior management statement usually contains the following
elements:
■An acknowledgment of the importance of computing
resources to the business model
■A statement of support for information security throughout
the enterprise
■A commitment to authorize and manage the deﬁnition of the
lower level standards, procedures, and guidelines

Cisco Wireless Security • Chapter 8
409
Part of any policy deﬁnition includes what is required to ensure that the
policy is adhered to.The prime object of policy controls is to reduce the effect of
security threats and vulnerabilities to the resources being protected.The policy
deﬁnition process generally entails the identiﬁcation of what impact a threat
would have on an organization, and what the likelihood of that threat occurring
would be. Risk analysis (RA) is the process of analyzing a threat and producing a
representative value of that threat.
Figure 8.5 displays a matrix created using a small x–y graph representing the
threat and the corresponding likelihood of that threat.The goal of RA is to
reduce the level of impact and the likelihood that it will occur.A properly imple-
mented control should move the plotted point from the upper right to the lower
left of the graph.
An improperly designed and implemented control will show little to no
movement in the plotted point before and after the control’s implementation.
Identifying Resources
To assess and protect resources, they must ﬁrst be identiﬁed, classiﬁed, and labeled
so that in the process of performing your risk analysis you are able to document
all possible risks to each identiﬁed item and provide possible solutions to mitigate
those risks.
Security classiﬁcation provides the following beneﬁts:

Supports the tenets of conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability as it per-
tains to data
■
Helps identify which protections apply to which information
■
May be required for regulatory, compliance, or legal reasons
In the public sector, the common categories utilized in the classiﬁcation of
resources are the following:
■
Public These are no-risk items that can be disclosed to anyone, as long
as they do not violate any individual’s right to privacy, and knowledge of
this information does not expose an organization to ﬁnancial loss or
embarrassment, or jeopardize security assets. Examples of public infor-
mation include marketing brochures, published annual reports, business
cards, and press releases.
■
Internal Use These are low-risk items that due to their technical or
business sensitivity are limited to an organization’s employees and those
contractors covered by a nondisclosure agreement. Should there be
unauthorized disclosure, compromise, or destruction of the documents,
there would only be minimal impact on the organization, its customers,
or employees. Examples of Internal Use information include employee
handbooks, telephone directories, organizational charts, and policies.
■
Conﬁdential These are moderate-risk items whose unauthorized dis-
closure, compromise, or destruction would directly or indirectly impact
an organization, its customers, or employees, possibly causing ﬁnancial
damage to an organization’s reputation, a loss of business, and potential
legal action.They are intended solely for use within an organization and
are limited to those individuals who have a “need-to-know” security
clearance. Examples of conﬁdential items include system requirements or
conﬁgurations, proprietary software, personnel records, customer records,
business plans, budget information, and security plans and standards.
■
Restricted These are high-risk critical items whose unauthorized dis-
closure, compromise, or destruction would result in severe damage to a
company, providing signiﬁcant advantages to a competitor, or causing
penalties to the organization, its customers, or employees. It is intended
solely for restricted use within the organization and is limited to those

with an explicit, predetermined, and stringent “business-need-to-know.”
Examples of restricted data include strategic plans, encryption keys,
authentication information (passwords, PINs, and so on), and IP
addresses for security-related servers.
All information, whether in paper, spoken, or electronic form should be clas-
siﬁed, labeled, and distributed in accordance to your information classiﬁcation
and handling procedures.This will assist in the determination of what items have
the largest threat, and as such, should determine how you set about providing
controls for those threats.
Your wireless network contains a few internal items that should be identiﬁed
and classiﬁed, however the overall classiﬁcation of any network device comes
down the level of information that ﬂows through its channels.While using e-mail
systems or accessing external sites through your wireless network, you will likely
ﬁnd that your entire network contains restricted information. However, if you are
able to encrypt the password, the classiﬁcation of your network data will then be
rated based upon the non-authentication information traveling across your wire-
less network.
Understanding Classiﬁcation Criteria
To assist in your risk analysis, you can use a few additional criteria to determine
the classiﬁcation of information resources:
■
Value Value is the most commonly used criteria for classifying data in
the private sector. If something is valuable to an individual or organiza-
tion, that will prompt the data to be properly identiﬁed and classiﬁed.
■
Age Information is occasionally reclassiﬁed to a lower level as time
passes. In many government organizations, some classiﬁed documents are
automatically declassiﬁed after a predetermined time period has passed.
■
Useful Life If information has become obsolete due to new informa-
tion or resources, it is usually reclassiﬁed.
■
Personal Association If information is associated with speciﬁc indi-
viduals or is covered under privacy law, it may need to be reclassiﬁed at
some point.

Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
Implementing Policy
Information classiﬁcation procedures offer several steps in establishing a classiﬁca-
tion system, which provides the ﬁrst step in the creation of your security stan-
dards and policies.The following are the primary procedural steps used in
establishing a classiﬁcation system:
1. Identify the administrator or custodian.
2. Specify the criteria of how the information will be classiﬁed and labeled.
3. Classify the data by its owner, who is subject to review by a supervisor.
4. Specify and document any exceptions to the classiﬁcation policy.
5. Specify the controls that will be applied to each classiﬁcation level.
6. Specify the termination procedures for declassifying the information or
for transferring custody of the information to another entity.
7. Create an enterprise awareness program about the classiﬁcation controls.
Once your information and resources are properly identiﬁed and classiﬁed,
you will be able to deﬁne the controls necessary to ensure the privacy and secu-
rity of information regarding your employees and customers. Many industries are
required, either by regulation or civil law, to ensure that proper policy is in place
to protect the security and privacy of nonpublic personal information.This rela-
tionship of policy, guidelines, and legal standards is shown in Figure 8.6.
Guidelines refer to the methodologies of securing systems. Guidelines are
more ﬂexible than standards or policies and take the varying nature of informa-
tion systems into consideration as they are developed and deployed, usually
offering speciﬁc processes for the secure use of information resources. Many
organizations have general security guidelines regarding a variety of platforms

available within them: NT, SCO-Unix, Debian Linux, Red Hat Linux, Oracle,
and so on.
Standards specify the use of speciﬁc technologies in a uniform way.Although
they are often not as ﬂexible as guidelines, they do offer wider views to the tech-
nology speciﬁed. Usually, standards are in place for general computer use, encryp-
tion use, information classiﬁcation, and others.
Policies are generally statements created for strategic or legal reasons, from
which the standards and guidelines are deﬁned. Some policies are based on legal
requirements placed on industries such as health insurance, or they can be based
upon common law requirements for organizations retaining personal nonpublic
information of their customers.
Policies, standards, and guidelines must be explicit and focused, and they must
effectively communicate the following subjects:
■
Responsibility and authority
■
Access control
■
The extent to which formal veriﬁcation is required
■
Discretionary/mandatory control (generally relevant only in government
or formal policy situations)
■
Marking/labeling
■
Control of media
■
Import and export of data
■
Security and classiﬁcation levels
■
Treatment of system output
The intent of policy is to delineate what an organization expects in the infor-
mation security realm. Reasonable policy should also reﬂect any relevant laws and
regulations that impact the use of information within an organization.
The System Administration, Networking, and Security Institute (SANS) offers
excellent resources for implementing security standards, policies, and guidelines.
You can ﬁnd more information on policy implementation at the SANS Web site
at www.sans.org/newlook/resources/policies/policies.htm.There you’ll ﬁnd

Addressing the Issues with Policy
Wireless users have unique needs that policy must address.The administrator
must take diligent care in creating effective policy to protect the users, their data,
and corporate assets. But just what is an effective policy for wireless users? Let’s
look at some common sense examples of good wireless policy.
First, wireless LANs are an “edge” technology.As such, policy should reﬂect a
standard consistent with end users attempting to gain access to network resources
from “the edge.” In the case of wired LANs, typically you would set some stan-
dard physical access restrictions.This type of restriction would protect the LAN
from certain types of attacks.You might also create group policy on the PC for
authentication and access restrictions to corporate domains, and so long as there
is no inside threat, the LAN is secured. (This scenario is unlikely in that disgrun-
tled employees are representative of a solid portion of network hacking/misuse.)
If you can’t physically access the media, you cannot break in. If you do not fur-
nish a valid username and password despite physical access, in most cases you
cannot break in. Certainly some other methods of attack exist so long as you
have physical access, but for all intents and purposes in this discussion, the typical,
aspiring hacker is locked out.This assists in implementing the more stringent rule
set as required by edge and remote access.
In a wireless environment, the rules change. How do you stop access to RF?
RF travels through, around, and is reﬂected off objects, walls, and other physical
barriers. RF doesn’t have the feature-rich security support that the typical wired
network has. Even though you can use the features of the wired Ethernet/IP
security model after you are connected to the LAN, what about the signal from
the AP to the client and vice-versa? Because of this access methodology, wireless
poses some interesting policy challenges.
You can overcome one of these challenges—ease of capture of RF trafﬁc—by
preventing the broadcast of the Secure Set Identiﬁer (SSID) to the world from
the AP. Much like the Network Basic Input/Output System (NETBIOS) in the
Windows world that broadcasts shares, the AP typically broadcasts the SSID to
allow clients to associate.This is an advertisement for access to what you would
like to be a restricted WLAN.Therefore, a good policy in the WLAN space is to
prevent the AP from broadcasting this information. Instead, set up the AP to
respond only to clients that already have the required details surrounding the
Basic Service Set (BSS).This means that when the client attempts to associate, the
AP challenges the client for the SSID and WEP encryption key information
before allowing access. Of course, there are still ways to capture the trafﬁc, but
www.syngress.com

Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
with this minor policy rule, the level of difﬁculty has been exponentially
increased from the default implementation.
This security policy works well in the WLAN space until a technically savvy,
but security ignorant, user installs a rogue AP because they wish to have their
own personal AP connected to the WLAN.This poses a strong threat to the
overall network security posture and must be prohibited.
What’s in a name? It’s imperative that you set in place a standard naming con-
vention and WEP policy to prevent the standard defaults from being utilized.You
wouldn’t want your password published to the world in a set of instructions on
how to access your PC, but that is exactly the case when speaking of WLAN
defaults.They are published, documented, and presented as the default settings of
the wireless space built from that speciﬁc hardware, and this is a good thing.
Without this information, you would not be able to implement the hardware.
However, to prevent unauthorized access, it’s critical that you do not leave the
default settings in place.A further consideration would be not using easily
guessed names such as the company name.This should be part of your security
policy for new hardware/software integration and goes toward assisting in the
mitigation of capturing RF trafﬁc.
With respect to roaming needs, these policies should not change from room
to room or AP to AP.A consistent rule set (more stringent than normally inter-
nally trusted users) should be put in place across all APs where users are likely to
roam while connected wirelessly.When choosing your AP, you can also add to
ease of use for your wireless users by getting hardware that supports true roaming
as opposed to having to lose connectivity momentarily while re-associating with
another AP.The temporary loss of connectivity could lead to account lock out
and the need to re-authenticate in upper layers.
Finally, strong authentication and encryption methods makes attacking the
access mechanisms even more difﬁcult, which is why the organization must include
the appropriate use of authentication and encryption in its policy. Use of RADIUS
or VPN solutions for authentication and tunneling sits nicely in the gap for the
added protection.These authentication tools even serve as a standalone security fea-
ture for open networks where disabling the SSID is not an option.
All in all, policy should reﬂect these general guidelines if you intend to secure
the WLAN access to corporate assets.We explore each in detail throughout this
chapter to give you the information you need to secure your WLAN. Don’t
make the mistake of using just one of these options. Instead, look at your security
policy as a tightly bound rope consisting of multiple threads. Each thread is
another layer of security. In this case, your security policy will remain strong
www.syngress.com

Cisco Wireless Security • Chapter 8
417
despite the failure of one or two threads.At no time do you want one solution to
be the only boundary between maintaining your valuables and losing them.
Implementing WEP
Despite its critics,WEP still offers a reasonable level of security, providing that all
its features are used properly.This means greater care in key management,
avoiding default options, and making sure adequate encryption is enabled at every
opportunity.
Proposed improvements in the standard should overcome many of the limita-
tions of the original security options, and should make WEP more appealing as a
security solution.Additionally, as WLAN technology gains popularity, and users
clamor for functionality, both the standards committees as well as the hardware
vendors will offer improvements.This means that you should make sure to keep
abreast of vendor-related software ﬁxes and changes that improve the overall
security posture of your WLAN.
Most APs advertise that they support WEP in at least 40-bit encryption, but
often the 128-bit option is also supported. For corporate networks, 128-bit
encryption–capable devices should be considered as a minimum.With data secu-
rity enabled in a closed network, the settings on the client for the SSID and the
encryption keys have to match the AP when attempting to associate with the
network, or it will fail. In the next few paragraphs, we discuss WEP as it relates to
the functionality of the standard, including a standard deﬁnition of WEP, the pri-
vacy created, and the authentication.
Deﬁning WEP
802.11, as a standard, covers the communication between WLAN components.
RF poses challenges to privacy in that it travels through and around physical
objects.As part of the goals of the communication, a mechanism needed to be
implemented to protect the privacy of the individual transmissions that in some
way mirrored the privacy found on the wired LAN.Wireless Equivalency Privacy
is the mechanism created in the standard as a solution that addresses this goal.
Because WEP utilizes a cryptographic security countermeasure for the fulﬁllment
of its stated goal of privacy, it has the added beneﬁt of becoming an authentica-
tion mechanism.This beneﬁt is realized through a shared key authentication that
allows the encryption and decryption of the wireless transmissions. Many keys
can be deﬁned on an AP or a client, and they can be rotated to add complexity
for a higher security standard for your WLAN policy.This is a must!
www.syngress.com

Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
WEP was never intended to be the absolute authority in security. Instead, the
driving force was privacy. In cases that require high degrees of security, you
should utilize other mechanisms, such as authentication, access control, password
protection, and virtual private networks.
Creating Privacy with WEP
Let’s look at how WEP creates a degree of privacy on the WLAN.WEP comes in
several implementations: no encryption, and 40-bit and 128-bit encryption.
Obviously, no encryption means no privacy.Transmissions are sent in the clear,
and they can be viewed by any wireless snifﬁng application that has access to the
RF propagated in the WLAN. In the case of the 40- and 128-bit varieties (just as
with password length), the greater the number of characters (bits), the stronger
the encryption.The initial conﬁguration of the AP will include the setup of the
shared key.This shared key can be in the form of either alphanumeric, or hex-
adecimal strings, and is matched on the client.
WEP uses the RC4 encryption algorithm, a stream cipher developed by
noted cryptographer Ron Rivest (the “r” in RSA). Both the sender and receiver
use the stream cipher to create identical pseudorandom strings from a known
shared key.The process entails the sender to logically XOR the plaintext trans-
mission with the stream cipher to produce the ciphertext.The receiver takes the
shared key and identical stream and reverses the process to gain the plaintext
transmission.
A 24-bit initialization vector (IV) is used to create the identical cipher
streams.The IV is produced by the sender, and is included in the transmission of
each frame.A new IV is used for each frame to prevent the reuse of the key
weakening the encryption.This means that for each string generated, a different
value for the RC4 key will be used.Although a secure policy, consideration of
the components of WEP bear out one of the ﬂaws in WEP. Because the 24-bit
space is so small with respect to the potential set of IVs, in a short period of time,
all keys are eventually reused. Unfortunately, this weakness is the same for both
the 40- and 128-bit encryption levels.
To protect against some rudimentary attacks that insert known text into the
stream to attempt to reveal the key stream,WEP incorporates a checksum in each
frame.Any frame not found to be valid through the checksum is discarded.All in
all this sounds secure, but WEP has well-documented ﬂaws, which we cover in
later sections. Let’s review the process in a little more detail to gain a better
understanding of the behind-the-scenes activities that are largely the ﬁrst line of
defense in WLAN security.

Cisco Wireless Security • Chapter 8
419
The WEP Authentication Process
Shared key authentication is a four-step process that begins when the AP receives
the validated request for association.After the AP receives the request, a series of
management frames are transmitted between the stations to produce the authenti-
cation.This includes the use of the cryptographic mechanisms employed by WEP
as a validation.
Strictly with respect to WEP, in the authorization phase, the four steps break
down in the following manner:
1. The requestor (the client) sends a request for association.
2. The authenticator (the AP) receives the request, and responds by pro-
ducing a random challenge text and transmitting it back to the
requestor.
3. The requestor receives the transmission, ciphers the challenge with the
shared key stream, and returns it.
4. The authenticator decrypts the challenge text and compares the values
against the original. If they match, the requestor is authenticated. On the
other hand, if the requestor doesn’t have the shared key, the cipher
stream cannot be reproduced, therefore the plaintext cannot be discov-
ered, and theoretically, the transmission is secured.
WEP Beneﬁts and Advantages
WEP provides some security and privacy in transmissions to prevent curious or
casual browsers from viewing the contents of the transmissions held between the
AP and the clients. In order to gain access, the degree of sophistication of the
intruder has to improve, and speciﬁc intent to gain access is required. Let’s view
some of the other beneﬁts of implementing WEP:
■
All messages are encrypted using a checksum to provide some degree of
tamper resistance.
■
Privacy is maintained via the encryption. If you do not have the key, you
can’t decrypt the message.
■
WEP is extremely easy to implement. Set the encryption key on the AP,
repeat the process on each client, and voilà! You’re done!
■
WEP provides a very basic level of security for WLAN applications.
www.syngress.com

420
Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
■
WEP keys are user deﬁnable and unlimited.You do not have to use pre-
deﬁned keys, and you can and should change them often.
WEP Disadvantages
As with any standard or protocol,WEP has some inherent disadvantages.The
focus of security is to allow a balance of access and control while juggling the
advantages and disadvantages of each implemented countermeasure for security
gaps.The following are some of the disadvantages of WEP:
■
The RC4 encryption algorithm is a known stream cipher.This means it
takes a ﬁnite key and attempts to make an inﬁnite pseudorandom key
stream in order to generate the encryption.
■
Once you alter the key—which you should do often—you have to tell
everyone so they can adjust their settings.The more people you tell, the
more public the information becomes.
■
Used on its own,WEP does not provide adequate WLAN security.
■
WEP has to be implemented on every client as well as every AP to be
effective.
The Security Implications of Using WEP
From a security perspective, you have mitigated the curious hacker who lacks the
means or desire to really hack your network. If you have enabled WEP as
instructed in the previous pages, someone has to be actively attempting to break
into your network in order to be successful. If that is the case, using the strongest
form of WEP available is important. Because WEP relies on a known stream
cipher, it is vulnerable to certain attacks. By no means is it the ﬁnal authority and
should not be the only security countermeasure in place to protect your net-
work—and ultimately your job!
Implementing WEP on the Cisco Aironet AP 340
As you can see in the following, the Cisco AP340 supports 128-bit encryption. It
is conﬁgured with either a HTTP connection pictured here, or a serial connec-
tion.The serial interface is cryptic and in no way intuitive. If you plan on admin-
istering many Cisco wireless devices, use the Web interface. In Figure 8.7, you see

Full Encryption and then 128 bit for the key size. Finally, select the WEP Key
radio button for the transmission key and type the string.
Exploiting WEP
There have been a number of well-publicized exploitations and defeats of the secu-
rity mechanisms at the heart of WEP, from weaknesses in the encryption algorithm
to weaknesses in key management.Although steps have been taken to overcome
these weaknesses, attackers are not suffering from a lack of networks to exploit.
The ﬁrst warnings regarding WEP’s vulnerability to compromise came in the
fall of 2000 when Jesse Walker published a document called “Unsafe at any Size:
An Analysis of the WEP Encryption.” In this document,Walker underscored the
main weakness of WEP—the fact that it reinitializes the encrypted data stream
every time an Ethernet collision occurs. Even though the 802.11 protocol
attempts to avoid them with CDMA/CA, collisions are a reality that will occur.
If someone is listening in on the wireless conversation, they capture the IV infor-
mation transmitted with each frame and in a matter of hours have all the data
needed to recover the WEP key.
www.syngress.com
Figure 8.7 WEP Conﬁguration on the Aironet

422
Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
Although many experts have made similar discoveries regarding this and other
ways to recover WEP keys, these were usually academic and only showed that the
potential for vulnerability existed.This all changed with the introduction of
AirSnort and WEPCrack. Both of these programs saw an initial release in the
summer of 2001, and moved the recovery of WEP keys from being a theoretical
to something anyone could do—if they had a wireless card based on the Prism2
chipset.
Security of 64-Bit versus 128-Bit Keys
It might seem obvious to a nontechnical person that something protected with a
128-bit encryption scheme would be more secure than something protected with
a 64-bit encryption scheme.This, however, is not the case with WEP. Because the
same vulnerability exists with both encryption levels, they can be equally broken
within similar time limits.
With 64-bit WEP, the network administrator speciﬁes a 40-bit key—typically
ten hexadecimal digits (0–9, a–f, or A–F).A 24-bit IV is appended to this 40-bit
key, and the RC4 key scheme is built from these 64-bits of data.This same pro-
cess is followed in the 128-bit scheme.The Administrator speciﬁes a 104-bit
key—this time 26 hexadecimal digits (0-9, a-f, or A-F).The 24-bit IV is added to
the beginning of the key, and the RC4 key schedule is built.
As you can see, because the vulnerability comes from capturing predictably
weak IVs, the size of the original key would not make a signiﬁcant difference in
the security of the encryption.This is due to the relatively small number of total
IVs possible under the current WEP speciﬁcation. Currently, there are a total of
224 possible IV keys.You can see that if the WEP key was not changed within a
strictly-deﬁned period of time, all possible IV combinations could be heard off of
a 802.11b connection, captured, and made available for cracking within a short
period of time.This is a ﬂaw in the design of WEP, and bears no correlation to
whether the wireless client is using 64-bit WEP or 128-bit WEP.
Acquiring a WEP Key
As mentioned previously, programs exist that allow an authenticated and/or unas-
sociated device within the listening area of the AP to capture and recover the
WEP key. Depending on the speed of the machine listening to the wireless con-
versations, the number of wireless hosts transmitting on the WLAN, and the
number of IV retransmissions due to 802.11 frame collisions, the WEP key could
be cracked as quickly as a couple of hours. Obviously, if an attacker attempts to
www.syngress.com

Cisco Wireless Security • Chapter 8
423
listen to a WEP-protected network when there was very little network trafﬁc, it
would take much longer to be able to get the data necessary to crack WEP.
Armed with a valid WEP key, an intruder can now successfully negotiate
association with an AP, and gain entry onto the target network. Unless other
mechanisms like MAC ﬁltering are in place, this intruder is now able to roam
across the network and potentially break into servers or other machines on the
network. If MAC ﬁltering is occurring, another procedure must be attempted to
get around this.This was covered earlier in the “MAC Filtering” section.
WARNING
Because WEP key retrieval is now possible by casual attackers, keeping
the same static WEP key in a production role for an extended period of
time does not make sense. If your WEP key is static, it could be published
into the underground by a hacker and still be used in a production
WLAN six months to a year later.
One of the easiest ways to mitigate the risk of WEP key compromise
is to regularly change the WEP key your APs and clients use. Although
this may be an easy task for small WLANs, the task becomes extremely
daunting when you have dozens of APs and hundreds of clients to man-
ually rekey.
Both Cisco and Funk Software have released Access Control servers
that implement rapid WEP rekeying on both APs as well as the end-user
client. Utilizing this form of software, even if a WEP key was to be dis-
covered, you could rest assured that within a speciﬁed period of time,
that particular key would no longer be valid.
Addressing Common Risks and Threats
The advent of wireless networks has not created new legions of attackers. Many
attackers will utilize the same attacks for the same objectives they used in wired
networks. If you do not protect your wireless infrastructure with proven tools and
techniques, and do not have established standards and policies that identify proper
deployment and security methodology, you will ﬁnd that the integrity of your
wireless networks may be threatened.

Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
Finding a Target
Utilizing new tools created for wireless networks and thousands of existing identiﬁ-
cation and attack techniques and utilities, attackers of wireless networks have many
avenues to your network.The ﬁrst step to attacking a wireless network involves
ﬁnding a network to attack.The ﬁrst popular software to identify wireless networks
was NetStumbler (www.netstumbler.org). NetStumbler is a Windows application
that listens for information, such as the SSID, being broadcast from APs that have
not disabled the broadcast feature.When it ﬁnds a network, it notiﬁes the person
running the scan and adds it to the list of found networks.
As people began to drive around their towns and cities looking for wireless
networks, NetStumbler added features such as pulling coordinates from Global
Positioning System (GPS) satellites and plotting that information on mapping
software.This method of ﬁnding networks is very reminiscent of a way hackers
would ﬁnd computers when they had only modems to communicate.They
would run programs designed to search through all possible phone numbers and
call each one looking for a modem to answer the call.This type of scan was typi-
cally referred to as war dialing; driving around looking for wireless networks has
come to be known as war driving.
NetStumbler.org created place that people can upload the output of their war
drives for inclusion in a database that can graph the location of wireless networks
that have been found (www.netstumbler.org/nation.php). See Figure 8.8 for
output of discovered and uploaded wireless networks as of January 2002.
Similar tools soon became available for Linux and other UNIX-based operating
systems, which contained many additional utilities hackers use to attack hosts and
networks once access is found.A quick search on www.freshmeat.net or
www.packetstormsecurity.com for “802.11” will reveal several network identiﬁca-
tion tools as well as tools to conﬁgure and monitor wireless network connections.
Finding Weaknesses in a Target
If a network is found without encryption enabled, which reports are showing to
be more than half of the networks found so far, the attacker has complete access
to any resource the wireless network is connected to.They can scan and attack
any machines local to the network, or launch attacks on remote hosts without
any fear of reprisal, as the world thinks the attack is coming from the owner of
the wireless network.
If the network is found with WEP enabled, the attacker will need to identify
several items to reduce the time it will take to get onto the wireless network.
www.syngress.com

Cisco Wireless Security • Chapter 8
425
First, utilizing the output of NetStumbler or one of the other network discovery
tools, the attacker will identify the SSID, network, MAC address, and any other
packets that might be transmitted in cleartext. Generally, NetStumbler results
include vendor information, which an attacker can use to determine which
default keys to attempt on the wireless network.
If the vendor information has been changed or is unavailable, the attacker can
still use the SSID and network name and address to identify the vendor or owner
of the equipment (many people use the same network name as the password, or
use the company initials or street address as their password). If the SSID and net-
work name and address has been changed from the default setting, a ﬁnal net-
work-based attempt could be to use the MAC address to identify the
manufacturer.
If none of these options work, there is still the possibility of a physical review.
Many public areas are participating in the wireless revolution.An observant
attacker will be able to use physical and wireless identiﬁcation techniques—such
as ﬁnding antennas,APs, and other wireless devices that are easily identiﬁed by
the manufacturer’s casing and logo.
www.syngress.com
Figure 8.8 Networks Discovered with NetStumbler (as of January 2002)

426
Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
Exploiting Those Weaknesses
A well-conﬁgured wireless AP will not stop a determined attacker. Even if the
network name and SSID are changed and the secret key is manually reconﬁgured
on all workstations on a somewhat regular basis, the attacker will still take other
avenues to compromise the network.
If easy access is available near to the wireless network, such as a parking lot or
garage next to the building being attacked, the only thing an attacker needs is
patience and AirSnort or WEPCrack.When these applications have captured
enough “weak” packets (IV collisions, for example) they are able to determine
the secret key currently in use on the network. Quick tests have shown that an
average home network can be cracked in an overnight session.This means that to
ensure your network protection, you would need to change your WEP key at
least two times per day, or keep your eyes open for any vehicles that look suspi-
cious (with an antenna sticking out the window, for instance) parked outside your
home or business for hours or days at a time.
If none of these network tools help in determining which default conﬁgura-
tions to try, the next step is to scan the trafﬁc for any cleartext information that
might be available. Some manufacturers, such as Lucent, have been known to
broadcast the SSID in cleartext even when WEP and closed network options are
enabled. Using tools such as Ethereal (www.ethereal.com) and TCPDump
(www.tcpdump.org) allow the attacker to sniff trafﬁc and analyze it for any clear-
text hints they may ﬁnd.
As a last option, the attacker will go directly after your equipment or install
their own.The number of laptops or accessories stolen from travelers is rising
each year.At one time these thefts were perpetrated by criminals simply looking
to sell the equipment, but as criminals become more savvy, they are also after the
information contained within the machines. Once you have access to the equip-
ment, you are able to determine what valid MAC addresses can access the net-
work, what the network SSID is, and what secret keys are to be used.
An attacker does not need to become a burglar in order to acquire this infor-
mation.A skilled attacker will utilize new and specially designed malware and
network tricks to determine the information needed to access your wireless net-
work.A well-scripted Visual Basic script that could arrive in e-mail (targeted
spam) or through an infected Web site can extract the information from the user’s
machine and upload it to the attacker.
With the size of computers so small today (note the products at www.mynix
.com/espace/index.html and www.citydesk.pt/produto_ezgo.htm), it wouldn’t
www.syngress.com

Cisco Wireless Security • Chapter 8
427
take much for the attacker to simply create a small AP of their own that could be
attached to your building or ofﬁce and look just like another telephone box.
Such a device, if placed properly, will attract much less attention than someone
camping in a car or van in your parking lot.
Snifﬁng, Interception, 
and Eavesdropping
Originally conceived as a legitimate network and trafﬁc analysis tool, snifﬁng
remains one of the most effective techniques in attacking a wireless network,
whether it’s to map the network as part of a target reconnaissance, to grab pass-
words, or to capture unencrypted data.
Deﬁning Snifﬁng
Snifﬁng is the electronic form of eavesdropping on the communications that
computers have across networks. In the original networks deployed, the equip-
ment tying machines together allowed every machine on the network to see the
trafﬁc of others.These repeaters and hubs, while very successful for getting
machines connected, allowed an attacker easy access to all trafﬁc on the network
by only needing to connect to one point to see the entire network’s trafﬁc.
Wireless networks function very similar to the original repeaters and hubs.
Every communication across the wireless network is viewable to anyone who
happens to be listening to the network. In fact, the person listening does not even
need to be associated with the network to sniff!
Sample Snifﬁng Tools
The hacker has many tools available to attack and monitor your wireless network.
A few of these tools are Ethereal and AiroPeek (www.wildpackets.com/products/
airopeek) in Windows, and TCPDump or ngrep (http://ngrep.sourceforg.net)
within a UNIX or Linux environment.These tools work well for snifﬁng both
wired and wireless networks.
All of these software packages function by putting your network card in what
is called promiscuous mode.When in this mode, every packet that goes past the
interface is captured and displayed within the application window. If the attacker
is able to acquire your WEP password, they can then utilize features within
AiroPeek and Ethereal to decrypt either live or post-capture data.

Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
Snifﬁng Case Scenario
By running NetStumbler, the hacker will be able to ﬁnd possible targets.As
shown in Figure 8.9, we have found several networks that we could attack.
Once the hacker has found possible networks to attack, one of the ﬁrst tasks
is to identify who the target is. Many organizations are “nice” enough to include
their name or address in the network name. For those that do not display that
information, we can gather a lot from their trafﬁc that allows us to determine
who they could be.
Utilizing any of the mentioned network snifﬁng tools, the unencrypted net-
work is easily monitored. Figure 8.10 shows our network sniff of the trafﬁc on
the wireless network. From this, we are able to determine who their Domain
Name System (DNS) server is, and what default search domain and default Web
home page they are accessing.With this information, we can easily identify who
the target is and determine if they are worth attacking.
If the network is encrypted, the ﬁrst place to start is locating the physical
location of the target. NetStumbler has the capability to display the signal
strength of the networks you have discovered (see Figure 8.11). Utilizing this
information, the attacker needs to just drive around and look for where the signal
strength increases and decreases to determine the home of the wireless network.

speciﬁc direction.An excellent source for wireless information, including infor-
mation on the design of directional antennas is the Bay Area Wireless Users
Group (www.bawug.org).
Protecting Against Snifﬁng and Eavesdropping
One protection available to wired networks was the upgrade from repeaters and
hubs to a switched environment.These switches would send only the trafﬁc
intended over each individual port, making it difﬁcult (although not impossible)
to sniff the entire network’s trafﬁc.This is not an option for wireless due to the
nature of wireless itself.
The only way to protect your wireless users from attackers who might be
snifﬁng is to utilize encrypted sessions wherever possible: Use SSL for e-mail
connections, SSH instead of Telnet, and Secure Copy (SCP) instead of FTP.
To protect your network from being discovered with NetStumbler, be sure to
turn off any network identiﬁcation broadcasts, and if possible, close down your
network to any unauthorized users.This will prevent tools such as NetStumbler
from ﬁnding your network to begin with. However, the knowledgeable attacker
will know that just because you are not broadcasting your information does not
mean that your network can’t be found.
All the attacker needs to do is utilize one of the network sniffers to monitor
for network activity.Although not as efﬁcient as NetStumbler, it is still a func-
tional way to discover and monitor networks. Even encrypted networks will
show trafﬁc to the sniffer, even if you are not broadcasting who you are. Once
they have identiﬁed your trafﬁc, the attacker will then be able to utilize the same
identiﬁcation techniques to begin an attack on your network.
Spooﬁng and Unauthorized Access
The combination of weaknesses in WEP, and the nature of wireless transmission,
has highlighted the art of spooﬁng as a real threat to wireless network security. Some
well publicized weaknesses in user authentication using WEP have made authenti-
cation spooﬁng just one of an equally well tested number of exploits by attackers.
Deﬁning Spooﬁng
One deﬁnition of spooﬁng is where an attacker is able to trick your network
equipment into thinking that the connection they are coming from is one of the
valid and allowed machines from its network.Attackers can accomplish this sev-
eral ways, the easiest of which is to simply redeﬁne the MAC address of your

wireless or network card to be a valid MAC address.This can be accomplished in
Windows through a simple Registry edit. Several wireless providers also have an
option to deﬁne the MAC address for each wireless connection from within the
client manager application that is provided with the interface.
There are several reasons that an attacker would spoof your network. If you
have closed out your network to only valid interfaces through MAC or IP
address ﬁltering, if an attacker is able to determine a valid MAC or IP address, he
could then reprogram his interface with that information, allowing him to con-
nect to your network impersonating a valid machine.
IEEE 802.11 networks introduce a new form of spooﬁng: authentication
spooﬁng.As described in their paper “Intercepting Mobile Communications:The
Insecurities of 802.11,” the authors identiﬁed a way to utilize weaknesses within
WEP and the authentication process to spoof authentication into a closed net-
work.The process of authentication, as deﬁned by IEEE 802.11, is a very simple
process. In a shared-key conﬁguration, the AP sends out a 128-byte random
string in a cleartext message to the workstation wishing to authenticate.The
workstation then encrypts the message with the shared key and returns the
encrypted message to the AP. If the message matches what the AP is expecting,
the workstation is authenticated onto the network and access is allowed.
As described in the paper, if an attacker has knowledge of both the original
plaintext and ciphertext messages, it is possible to create a forged encrypted mes-
sage. By snifﬁng the wireless network, an attacker is able to accumulate many
authentication requests, each of which includes the original plaintext message and
the returned ciphertext-encrypted reply. From this, the attacker can easily identify
the keystream used to encrypt the response message. She could then use it to forge
an authentication message that the AP will accept as a proper authentication.
Sample Spooﬁng Tools
The wireless hacker does not need many complex tools to succeed in spooﬁng a
MAC address. In many cases, these changes are either features of the wireless
manufacturers or easily changed through a Windows Registry modiﬁcation. Once
a valid MAC is identiﬁed, the attacker need only reconﬁgure his device to trick
the AP into thinking they are a valid user.
The ability to forge authentication onto a wireless network is a complex pro-
cess.There are no known “off the shelf” packages available that will provide these
services.An attacker will need to either create their own tool or take the time to
decrypt the secret key by using AirSnort or WEPCrack.
www.syngress.com

432
Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
If the attacker is using Windows 2000, and his network card supports recon-
ﬁguring the MAC address, there is another way to reconﬁgure this information.
If your card supports this feature, you can change it from the Control Panel by
clicking the System icon. Once the System Properties dialog box appears, select
the Hardware tab and choose Device Manager.Within the Device Manager,
under the Network Adaptors, you should ﬁnd your interface. If you open the
properties to this interface, you should have an Advanced tab. Many network
adaptors allow you to reconﬁgure the MAC address of the card from this area.
Now that the hacker is utilizing a valid MAC address, he is able to access any
resource available from your wireless network. If you have WEP enabled, the
hacker will have to either identify your secret key, or as you will see shortly, cap-
ture the key through malware or stealing the user’s notebook.
Protecting Against Spooﬁng 
and Unauthorized Attacks
Little can be done to prevent these attacks.The best protection involves several
additional pieces to the wireless network. Using an external authentication
source, such as RADIUS or SecurID, will prevent an unauthorized user from
accessing the wireless network and resources it connects with.
If the attacker has reconﬁgured her machine to use a valid MAC address, little
can be done, except the additional external authentication.The only additional
protection that you can provide is if you utilize secure connections for all host
services accessed by the network. If you use SSH and SSL, you can require valid
client certiﬁcates to access those resources. Even if a hacker were able to access
the network, this would keep her from accessing your critical systems.
However, note that even with this, and without utilizing either a dynamic
ﬁrewall or RADIUS WEP authentication, an attacker could be able to get onto
your network. Even if you protect your critical systems, the attacker will still have
access to all workstations on the network, as well as all networks that are con-
nected to the wireless network. She could then compromise those resources and
acquire the valid information needed to access your systems.
Network Hijacking and Modiﬁcation
Numerous techniques are available for an attacker to “hijack” a wireless network
or session.And unlike some attacks, network and security administrators may be
unable to tell the difference between the hijacker and a legitimate passenger.
www.syngress.com

Cisco Wireless Security • Chapter 8
433
Deﬁning Hijacking
Many tools are available to the network hijacker.These tools are based upon basic
implementation issues within almost every network device available today.As
TCP/IP packets go through switches, routers, and APs, each device looks at the
destination IP address and compares it with the IP addresses it knows to be local. If
the address is not in the table, the device hands the packet off to its default gateway.
This table is used to coordinate the IP address with what MAC addresses are
local to the device. In many situations, this list is a dynamic list that is built up
from trafﬁc that is passing through the device and through Address Resolution
Protocol (ARP) notiﬁcations from new devices joining the network.There is no
authentication or veriﬁcation that the request received by the device is valid. So a
malicious user is able to send messages to routing devices and APs stating that
their MAC address is associated with a known IP address. From then on, all
trafﬁc that goes through that router destined for the hijacked IP address will be
handed off to the hacker’s machine.
If the attacker spoofs as the default gateway or a speciﬁc host on the network,
all machines trying to get to the network or the spoofed machine will connect to
the attacker’s machine instead of where they had intended. If the attacker is
clever, he will only use this to identify passwords and other necessary information
and route the rest of the trafﬁc to the intended recipient.This way the end user
has no idea that this “man-in-the-middle” has intercepted her communications
and compromised her passwords and information.
Another clever attack that is possible is through the use of rogue APs. If the
attacker is able to put together an AP with enough strength, the end users may
not be able to tell which AP is the real one to use. In fact, most will not even
know that another is available. Using this, the attacker is able to receive authenti-
cation requests and information from the end workstation regarding the secret
key and where they are attempting to connect.
These rogue APs can also be used to attempt to break into more tightly con-
ﬁgured wireless APs. Utilizing tools such as AirSnort and WEPCrack requires a
large amount of data to be able to decrypt the secret key.A hacker sitting in a car
in front of your house or ofﬁce is easily identiﬁed, and will generally not have
enough time to ﬁnish acquiring enough information to break the key. However,
if they install a tiny, easily hidden machine, this machine could sit there long
enough to break the key and possibly act as an external AP into the wireless net-
work it has hacked.
www.syngress.com

434
Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
Sample Hijacking Tools
Attackers who wish to spoof more than their MAC addresses have several tools
available. Most of the tools available are for use under a UNIX environment and
can be found through a simple search for “ARP Spoof” at http://packetstormse-
curity.com.With these tools, the hacker can easily trick all machines on your
wireless network into thinking that the hacker’s machine is another machine.
Through simple snifﬁng on the network, an attacker can determine which
machines are in high use by the workstations on the network. If they then spoof
themselves as one of these machines, they could possibly intercept much of the
legitimate trafﬁc on the network.
AirSnort and WEPCrack are freely available.And while it would take additional
resources to build a rogue AP, these tools will run from any Linux machine.
Hijacking Case Scenario
Now that we have identiﬁed the network to be attacked, and spoofed our MAC
address to become a valid member of the network, we can gain further informa-
tion that is not available through simple snifﬁng. If the network being attacked is
using SSH to access their hosts, just stealing a password might be easier than
attempting to break into the host using any exploit that might be available.
By just ARP spooﬁng their connection with the AP to be that of the host
they are wishing to steal the passwords from, all wireless users who are attempting
to SSH into the host will then connect to the rogue machine.When they attempt
to sign on with their password, the attacker is then able to, ﬁrst, receive their pass-
word, and second, pass on the connection to the real end destination. If the
attacker does not do the second step, it will increase the likelihood that their
attack will be noticed because users will begin to complain that they are unable
to connect to the host.
Protection against Network 
Hijacking and Modiﬁcation
You can use several different tools to protect your network from IP spooﬁng
with invalid ARP requests.These tools, such as ArpWatch, will notify an adminis-
trator when ARP requests are seen, allowing the administrator to take appropriate
action to determine if indeed someone is attempting to hack into the network.
Another option is to statically deﬁne the MAC/IP address deﬁnitions.This
will prevent the attacker from being able to redeﬁne this information. However,
www.syngress.com

Cisco Wireless Security • Chapter 8
435
due to the management overhead in statically deﬁning all network adaptors’
MAC address on every router and AP, this solution is rarely implemented. In fact,
many APs do not offer any options to deﬁne the ARP table, and it would depend
upon the switch or ﬁrewall you are using to separate your wireless network from
your wired network.
There is no way to identify or prevent any attackers from using passive
attacks, such as from AirSnort or WEPCrack, to determine the secret key used in
an encrypted wireless network.The best protection available is to change the
secret key on a regular basis and add additional authentication mechanisms such
as RADIUS or dynamic ﬁrewalls to restrict access to your wired network once a
user has connected to the wireless network. However, if you have not properly
secured every wireless workstation, an attacker need only go after one of the
other wireless clients to be able to access the resources available to it.
Denial of Service and Flooding Attacks
The nature of wireless transmission, and especially the use of spread spectrum
technology, makes a wireless network especially vulnerable to denial of service
(DoS) attacks.The equipment needed to launch such an attack is freely available
and very affordable. In fact, many homes and ofﬁces contain equipment necessary
to deny service to their wireless network.
Deﬁning DoS and Flooding
A denial of service occurs when an attacker has engaged most of the resources a
host or network has available, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users. One of
the original DoS attacks is known as a ping ﬂood.A ping ﬂood utilizes misconﬁg-
ured equipment along with bad “features” within TCP/IP to cause a large
number of hosts or devices to send an ICMP echo (ping) to a speciﬁed target.
When the attack occurs it tends to use much of the resources of both the network
connection and the host being attacked.This will then make it very difﬁcult for
any end users to access the host for normal business purposes.
In a wireless network, several items can cause a similar disruption of service.
Probably the easiest is through a conﬂiction within the wireless spectrum by dif-
ferent devices attempting to use the same frequency. Many new wireless tele-
phones use the same frequency as 802.11 networks.Through either intentional or
unintentional uses of this, a simple telephone call could prevent all wireless users
from accessing the network.
www.syngress.com

436
Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
Another possible attack would be through a massive amount of invalid (or
valid) authentication requests. If the AP is tied up with thousands of spoofed
authentication attempts, any users attempting to authenticate themselves would
have major difﬁculties in acquiring a valid session.
As you saw earlier, the attacker has many tools available to hijack network
connections. If a hacker is able to spoof the machines of a wireless network into
thinking that the attackers machine is their default gateway, not only will the
attacker be able to intercept all trafﬁc destined to the wired network, but they
would also be able to prevent any of the wireless network machines from
accessing the wired network.To do this the hacker need only spoof the AP and
not forward connections on to the end destination, preventing all wireless users
from doing valid wireless activities.
Sample DoS Tools
Not much is needed to create a wireless DoS. In fact, many users create these sit-
uations with the equipment found within their homes or ofﬁces. In a small apart-
ment building, you could ﬁnd several APs as well as many wireless telephones.
These users could easily create many DoS attacks on their own networks as well
as on those of their neighbors.
A hacker wishing to DoS a network with a ﬂood of authentication strings
will also need to be a well skilled programmer. Not many tools are available to
create this type of attack, but as we have seen in the attempts to crack WEP,
much of the programming required does not take much effort or time. In fact, a
skilled hacker should be able to create such a tool within a few hours.When
done, this simple application, when used with standard wireless equipment, could
possibly render your wireless network unusable for the duration of the attack.
Creating a hijacked AP DoS will require additional tools that can be found on
many security sites. See the earlier section “Sample Hijacking Tools” for a possible
starting point to acquiring some of the ARP spooﬁng tools needed.These tools are
not very complex and are available for almost every computing platform available.
DoS and Flooding Case Scenario
Many apartments and older ofﬁce buildings do not come prewired for the high-
tech networks that many people are using today.To add to the problem, if many
individuals are setting up their own wireless networks, without coordinating the
installs, many problems can occur that will be difﬁcult to detect.
Only so many frequencies are available to 802.11 networks. In fact, once the
frequency is chosen, it does not change until someone manually reconﬁgures it.
www.syngress.com

Cisco Wireless Security • Chapter 8
437
With these problems, it is not hard to imagine the following situation from
occurring.
A person goes out and purchases a wireless AP and several network cards for
his home network.When he gets home to his apartment and conﬁgures his net-
work he is extremely happy with how well wireless actually works.Then all of a
sudden none of the machines on the wireless network are able to communicate.
After waiting on hold for 45 minutes to get though to tech support for the
device, the network magically starts working again so he hangs up.
Later that week the same problem occurs, only this time he decides to wait
on hold.While waiting he goes onto his porch and begins discussing his frustra-
tion with his neighbor. During the conversation his neighbor’s kids come out and
say that their wireless network is not working.
So they begin to do a few tests (still waiting on hold, of course). First the man’s
neighbor turns off his AP (which is generally off unless the kids are online, to “pro-
tect” their network). Once this is done the wireless network starts working again.
Then they turn on the neighbor’s AP again and the network stops working again.
At this point, tech support ﬁnally answers and he describes what has hap-
pened.The tech-support representative has seen this situation several times and
informs the user that he will need to change the frequency used in the device to
another channel. He explains that what has happened is that the neighbor’s net-
work is utilizing the same channel, causing the two networks to conﬂict. Once
he changes the frequency, everything starts working properly.
Protecting Against DoS and Flooding Attacks
There is little that you can do to protect against DoS attacks. In a wireless environ-
ment the attacker does not need to even be in the same building or neighborhood.
With a good enough antenna, the attacker is able to send these attacks from a great
distance away.There is no indication that there is any reason for the disruption.
This is one of the valid times to use NetStumbler in a nonhacking context.
By using NetStumbler, you can identify any other networks that might be con-
ﬂicting with your network conﬁguration. However, NetStumbler will not iden-
tify other DoS attacks or other equipment that is causing conﬂicts (such as
wireless telephones).

Summary
Only through a solid understanding of security fundamentals, principles, and pro-
cedures will you be able to fully identify today’s security risks. From this under-
standing, which is built upon “The Big Three” tenets of security (conﬁdentiality,
integrity, and availability, or CIA) come the basis for all other security practices.
The essential practices usually associated with security build upon the concepts of
“The Big Three,” which provide tools for actually implementing security into
systems.The ability to properly authenticate a user or process, before allowing
that user or process access to speciﬁc resources, protect the CIA directly. If you
are able to clearly identify the authenticated user through electronic non-repudia-
tion techniques usually found in encryption tools such as public-key encryption,
you can ensure that the entities attempting to gain access are who they say they
are. Finally, if you log the activities performed, a third party can monitor the logs
and ensure that all activity happening on a system complies with the policy and
standards deﬁned, and that all inappropriate activity is identiﬁed, allowing for pos-
sible prosecution or investigation into the invalid activity.
Following these practices, through the use of tested and proven identiﬁcation
and evaluation standards, you can fully understand the security risks associated
with any object. Once you know the risks, you can provide solutions to diminish
these risks as much as possible.
The standard solution is to create a formal security policy along with detailed
guidelines and procedures.These guidelines describe the actual implementation
steps necessary for any platform to comply with the established security procedure.
By using these standard methods to protect your wireless network, you should
be able to develop a clear and concise wireless security plan that incorporates the
needs of your organization’s highest levels.This plan will allow for the deploy-
ment of a wireless network that’s as secure as possible and will provide clear
exception listings for areas where the risks to your infrastructure cannot be fully
controlled.
Through a careful examination of the design of WEP, we identiﬁed signiﬁcant
weaknesses in the algorithm.These weaknesses, along with implementation ﬂaws,
have lead to the creation of many new tools that can be used to attack wireless
networks.These tools allow for the attacker to identify a wireless network
through war driving and then crack the secret key by passively listening to the
encrypted transmissions. Once they have access to the secret key, only those that
have deployed additional security measures will have some additional protection
for the rest of their infrastructure.
www.syngress.com

Cisco Wireless Security • Chapter 8
439
Even if you have a incident response plan and procedure deﬁned in your
security standards, if an attack is not known to be happening, there is little you
can do to mitigate or rectify the intrusion.The entire discovery and WEP-
cracking process is passive and undetectable. Only at the point of attacking other
wireless hosts or spooﬁng their attacking machine as a valid host does the attack
becomes noticeable. However, many installations do not implement system log-
ging, nor do they have standards and practices requiring monitoring of those logs
for inappropriate activity.
None of these actions will provide protection against one of the oldest attacks
known—theft.There is little you can do to protect your resources if critical infor-
mation, such as network passwords and access deﬁnitions, can be acquired by only
gaining access to notebooks or backups. High-tech criminals are creating custom
malware that can access this information through spam or disguised Web sites.
Although wireless networks are making computing easier and more acces-
sible, understanding the design and implementation weaknesses in 802.11 will
help you in preventing attacks.And at times when attacks are unavoidable, by
knowing how and where the attackers will come, you may be able to identify
when they are attempting to gain access and respond as deﬁned in your standards
and incident response practices.
Solutions Fast Track
Understanding Security Fundamentals 
and Principles of Protection
 “The Big Three” tenets of security are: conﬁdentiality, integrity, and
availability.
 Requirements needed to implement the principles of protection include
proper authentication of authorized users through a system that provides
for a clear identiﬁcation of the users via tested non-repudiation
techniques.
 Internal or external auditors can use logging or system accounting to
ensure that the system is functioning and being utilized in accordance to
deﬁned standards and policies.
www.syngress.com

440
Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
 Logging can also be the ﬁrst place to look for evidence should an attack
does occur. Ensure that logging is going to a trusted third-party site that
cannot be accessed by personnel and resources being logged.
 These tools are essential to protecting the privacy of customer, partner,
or trade secret information.
 Encryption has provided many tools for the implementation of these
security fundamentals.
 Encryption is not the deﬁnitive solution to security problems. For
example, a known secret key could be stolen, or one of the parties
utilizing encryption could be tricked or forced into performing the
activity, which would be seen as a valid cryptographic operation because
the system has no knowledge of any collusion involved in the generation
of the request.
MAC Filtering
 Media Access Control (MAC) ﬁltering is effective against casual attackers.
 MAC ﬁltering can be circumvented by changing the MAC address on
the client device.
 It is difﬁcult to determine if the lack of association is due to MAC
ﬁltering or other reasons like an incorrect Wired Equivalent Protocol
(WEP) key.
Reviewing the Role of Policy
 Once basic fundamentals and principles are understood, through the
creation of policies and standards an organization or entity is able to
clearly deﬁne how to design, implement, and monitor their
infrastructure securely.
 Policies must have direct support and sign-in by the executive
management of any organization.
 A properly mitigated risk should reduce the impact of the threat as well
as the likelihood that that threat will occur.
 A clear and well-deﬁned classiﬁcation and labeling system is key to the
identiﬁcation of resources being protected.
www.syngress.com

Cisco Wireless Security • Chapter 8
441
 Information classiﬁcation techniques also provide a method by which
the items being classiﬁed can then have the proper policy or standards
placed around them depending on the level or importance, as well as the
risk associated with each identiﬁed item.
 Some organizations are required by their own regulations to have clear
and well deﬁned standards and policies.
Implementing WEP
 To protect against some rudimentary attacks that insert known text into
the stream to attempt to reveal the key stream,WEP incorporates a
check sum in each frame.Any frame not found to be valid through the
check sum is discarded.
 Used on its own,WEP does not provide adequate wireless local area
network (WLAN) security.
 WEP has to be implemented on every client as well as every Access
Point (AP) to be effective.
 WEP keys are user deﬁnable and unlimited.You do not have to use
predeﬁned keys, and you can and should change them often.
 Implement the strongest version of WEP available and keep abreast of
the latest upgrades to the standards.
Addressing Common Risks and Threats
 By examining the common threats to both wired and wireless networks,
you can see how a solid understanding in the basics of security
principles allows you to fully assess the risks associated with using
wireless and other technologies.
 Threats can come from simple design issues, where multiple devices
utilize the same setup, or intentional denial of service attacks which can
result in the corruption or loss of data.
 Not all threats are caused by malicious users.They can also be caused by
a conﬂict of similar resources, such as with 802.11b networks and
cordless telephones.

Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
 With wireless networks going beyond the border of your ofﬁce or
home, chances are greater that your actions might be monitored by a
third party.
 Unless your organization has clear and well-deﬁned policies and
guidelines, you might ﬁnd yourself in legal or business situations where
your data is either compromised, lost, or disrupted.Without a clear plan
of action that identiﬁes what is important in certain scenarios, you will
not be able to address situations as they occur.
Snifﬁng, Interception, and Eavesdropping
 Electronic eavesdropping, or snifﬁng, is passive and undetectable to
intrusion detection devices.
 Tools to sniff networks are available for Windows (such as Ethereal and
AiroPeek) and UNIX (such as tcpdump and ngrep).
 Snifﬁng trafﬁc allows attackers to identify additional resources that can
be compromised.
 Even encrypted networks have been shown to disclose vital information
in cleartext, such as the network name, that can be received by attackers
snifﬁng the WLAN.
 Any authentication information that is broadcast can often be simply
replayed to services requiring authentication (NT Domain,WEP
authentication, and so on) to access resources.
 The use of virtual private networks, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), and
Secure Shell (SSH) helps protect against wireless interception.
Spooﬁng and Unauthorized Access
 Due to the design of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
(TCP/IP), there is little that you can do to prevent MAC/IP address
spooﬁng.
 Only through static deﬁnition of MAC address tables can you prevent
this type of attack. However, due to signiﬁcant overhead in management,
this is rarely implemented.
www.syngress.com

Cisco Wireless Security • Chapter 8
443
 Wireless network authentication can be easily spoofed by simply
replaying another node’s authentication back to the AP when attempting
to connect to the network.
 Many wireless equipment providers allow for end-users to redeﬁne the
MAC address within their cards through the conﬁguration utilities that
come with the equipment.
 External two-factor authentication such as Remote Access Dial-In User
Service (RADIUS) or SecurID should be implemented to additionally
restrict access requiring strong authentication to access the wireless
resources.
Network Hijacking and Modiﬁcation
 Due to the design of TCP/IP, some spoof attacks allow for attackers to
hijack or take over network connections established for other resources
on the wireless network.
 If an attacker hijacks the AP, all trafﬁc from the wireless network gets
routed through the attacker, so they are then able to identify passwords
and other information other users are attempting to use on valid
network hosts.
 Many users are easily susceptible to these man-in-the-middle attacks,
often entering their authentication information even after receiving
many notiﬁcations that SSL or other keys are not what they should be.
 Rogue APs can assist the attacker by allowing remote access from wired
or wireless networks.
 These attacks are often overlooked as just faults in the user’s machine,
allowing attackers to continue hijacking connections with little fear of
being noticed.
Denial of Service and Flooding Attacks
 Many wireless networks within a small space can easily cause network
disruptions and even denial of service (DoS) for valid network users.
 If an attacker hijacks the AP and does not pass trafﬁc on to the proper
destination, all users of the network will be unable to use the network.
www.syngress.com

444
Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
 Flooding the wireless network with transmissions can also prevent other
devices from utilizing the resources, making the wireless network
inaccessible to valid network users.
 Wireless attackers can utilize strong and directional antennas to attack
the wireless network from a great distance.
 An attacker who has access to the wired network can ﬂood the wireless
AP with more trafﬁc than it can handle, preventing wireless users from
accessing the wired network.
 Many new wireless products utilize the same wireless frequencies as
802.11 networks.A simple cordless telephone could create a DoS
situation for the network more easily than any of these other techniques.
Q: Do I really need to understand the fundamentals of security in order to pro-
tect my network?
A: While you are able to utilize the conﬁguration options available to you from
your equipment provider, without a solid background in how security is
accomplished you will never be able to protect your assets from the unknown
threats that will come against your network through either misconﬁguration,
backdoors provided by the vendor, or new exploits that have not been
patched by your vendor.
Q: Am I required by law to have a security policy?
A: If your organization is a video store, deals with children’s records, or is associ-
ated with the health care or ﬁnancial industries (and you are located in the
United States), you are most likely required by federal regulation to have a
deﬁned security policy, and in some cases you are required to have complete
third-party audits of your conﬁguration and policies. If you are not required

Q: Is 128-bit WEP more secure than 64-bit WEP?
A: Not really.This is because the WEP vulnerability has more to do with the

my network is secure?
A: You can make the assumption that your home network is more secure than if
it did not utilize these safeguards. However, as shown in this chapter, these
methods can be circumvented to allow for intrusion.
Q: Where can I ﬁnd more information on WEP vulnerabilities?
A: Besides being one of the sources who brought WEP vulnerabilities to light,
www.isaac.cs.berkeley.edu has links to other Web sites that cover WEP 
insecurities.
Q: Can my customers really sue me or my company for being hacked and
having their information leaked or misused?
A: In any situation, if you have an established trust with a customer to maintain
their information securely and someone breaks into the building or into their
corporate servers, a a customer can possibly pursue litigation against you if
you did not have any policies or procedures in place to address the risk asso-
ciated with this and other threats to the customer’s information.
Q: If someone can be forced into performing an activity, why should I bother
setting up complex security applications?
A: Without those applications in place, you would ﬁnd that it does not take
direct force to attack you or your information.There has always been the
possibility that threats could force individuals in key positions to reveal dam-
aging information and secrets, but there is a greater chance that someone will
trick a user into disclosing their password or some other security key. Proper
training and education are the best defenses in these situations.

Chapter 8 • Cisco Wireless Security
Q: I added a ﬁrewall to my design.Why should I also need both a policy and
external auditing?
A: Again, a ﬁrewall may protect you initially, but what do you do as technology
changes, or your staff is replaced? Policies and standards ensure that current
and future implementations are built in accordance to the deﬁnitions laid out
by the organization.Adding logging, as well as internal and third-party
auditing of the implemented resources helps ensure that the implementations
are built in accordance to policy, and that all activity occurring within the
environment is in compliance with your standards, guidelines, and policies.
Q: If I have enabled WEP, am I now protected?
A: No. Certain tools can break all WEP keys by simply monitoring the network
trafﬁc for generally less than 24 hours.
Q: Is there any solution available besides RADIUS to perform external user and
key management?
A: No, plans are available from manufacturers to identify other ways of per-
forming the user/key management, but to date nothing is available.

Chapter 9 • Cisco Aironet Accessories
Introduction
You have now designed your wireless installation, found the perfect spot for your
bridge, evaluated antenna solutions, and are ready to do begin the installation. But
wait, what are you going to use to attach the antenna to the roof? How are you
going to connect the antenna to the bridge? Do you have the right connectors?
Is there an appropriate power source nearby? Are you going to just set the bridge
on the ground or mount it on a wall? What are you going to do about lightning
protection?
All of these questions and more are addressed in this chapter. Speciﬁcally, we
also examine the mounting options for Yagi and dipole style antenna.We also look
at the functioning of the Cisco lightning arrestor with grounding ring and how to
properly incorporate this piece of safety equipment into your wireless solution.
At this point, we shift the focus from the antenna accessories and look at some
of the available options for the access points (APs) and bridges themselves.Though
the APs and bridges have been covered in detail in previous chapters, this chapter
looks speciﬁcally at the appropriate locations to mount these devices.We also look
at the options available for mounting both out of the box as well as add-on
mounting kits. In addition to the mounting options, we also examine the spare
power supplies that are available, including the inline power injector that is now
available for the 350 series bridges and APs.We then continue this section of the
chapter with a discussion of the use of the console port on the back of the AP or
bridge. Finally, we wrap up this section with a look at the various types of National
Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) enclosures and how they are used.
From the discussion on the accessories, we move on to look at the cabling
that you can use for connecting the APs or bridges to the antenna.We look at
the different types of cabling that is available and the merits of each. In addition
to the cabling, we also spend some time looking at the connectors that go on this
cabling. In this examination, we pay added attention to the Reverse Polarity
Threaded-Neill-Concelman (RP-TNC) connector, which is the most common
connector type used by Cisco on its wireless equipment.We conclude this section
of the chapter by looking at the use of bulkhead extenders.
The ﬁnal section of this chapter looks at the Radio Country options that are
available for Cisco wireless solutions.With the global economy becoming more
vital to the success of any company, Cisco needs to sell its products in numerous
different countries around the world. Because each country has speciﬁc regula-
tions as to the strength of signal that a wireless solution can use, as well as the
range in which it can operate, Cisco developed the Radio Country options to
www.syngress.com

www.syngress.com
differentiate the equipment and country in which it can be used. In addition to
the local restrictions, export restrictions are also placed on devices that have
greater than 128-bit encryption. Because many of the wireless components sold
by Cisco fall into this category, Cisco must be careful to obtain export rights
before shipping equipment to a particular country.
Antenna Accessories
As was mentioned in the previous chapters, one of the items that can greatly
increase the range and usability of a wireless system is an appropriate antenna. Now
that you have chosen an antenna for your given application, we need to look at the
accessories that are available for it. Speciﬁcally, we examine two types of accessories
in this section: lightning suppression and mounting kits.The speciﬁc mounting kits
that we look at are the Yagi articulating mount and the magnetic mount.
Yagi Articulating Mount
As the name implies, this mounting kit is for the Yagi antenna.As was covered
earlier, the Yagi antenna is a directional antenna and as such needs to be properly
aligned in order to function optimally.The Yagi articulating mount (shown in
Figure 9.1) allows for mounting of a Yagi antenna on either a ﬂat surface or a
mast.This mount then allows for both horizontal and vertical adjustment of the
antenna to assist in the alignment process. Proper use of this mount will also
allow the Yagi antenna to retain its wind rating of 110 miles per hour.
Cisco Aironet Accessories • Chapter 9

Chapter 9 • Cisco Aironet Accessories
Magnetic Mount
The magnetic mount adapter (see Figure 9.2) is a replacement mount for the
dipole antenna mount, which Cisco stopped selling in October of 2001.The
magnetic mount not only has a connection for the dipole antenna, it also has a
coaxial RG-58 pigtail that is approximately a foot long to allow for an easy con-
nection to in-house wiring. (See the “RG-58 and RG-8 Cabling” section later in
this chapter for more details on RG-58 cabling.) The mount that the antenna
attaches to is the jack end of an RP-TNC connector; the end of the pigtail is a
plug end of an RP-TNC connector. (See the “Connectors” section later in this
chapter for more details on RP-TNC connectors.) The base of the mount is
cylindrical and approximately 5.25 inches in diameter and approximately 2 inches
high without an antenna attached.The base houses a magnet that will ﬁrmly
attach the mount with antenna to a ﬂat metallic surface.The magnet is strong
enough to hold the antenna on a wall or even upside-down.The base has a thin
rubber coating to protect the surface on which the mount is installed.
Lightning Arrestor with Grounding Ring
When you are planning any wireless systems, you should always consider light-
ning protection.The protection plan you choose should not only cover the exte-
rior equipment but also the interior equipment.When you are developing this
plan, as with any business decision, cost is one of the driving factors.The costs
www.syngress.com
Figure 9.2 Magnetic Mount

Cisco Aironet Accessories • Chapter 9
451
involved include not only the equipment or protection itself but also the cost of
downtime that could result from not putting in the protection.
When installing exterior antennas, some simple steps, such as installing them
in areas that are less likely to be directly hit by lightning or the addition of
lighting rods, can go a long way to protect the antenna.Though prior planning
will reduce the possibility of a strike, additional protection such as the Cisco
lightning arrestor with grounding ring (see Figure 9.3) will assist in the protec-
tion of interior equipment should a strike occur.
The lightning arrestor is an inline device that connects to the coaxial cable
running between the antenna and the Cisco wireless device. It has a 50-ohm
transmission line and is equipped with a gas discharge tube that will create a con-
nection to ground in the presence of an electrical surge. Should such a surge
occur, this transition takes place in approximately 100 nanoseconds.The lightning
arrestor will provide protection for transient spikes of up to 5,000 amperes,
insuring that the surge to the equipment connected to the line is limited to a
maximum of 50 volts.
NOTE
The intention of the lightning arrestor is to protect equipment from
nearby lightning strikes. It does not provide protection from direct light-
ning strikes.
Installation of the lightning arrestor is relatively straightforward.As with most
inline devices, disconnect or power off any powered components connected to
the coaxial cable before beginning the installation.As far as where to install the
lightning arrestor, you should install it indoors, as close to the bulkhead as is con-
venient.You can also install the arrestor in a protected area outside, such as a cable
enclosure, if no indoor locations are appropriate. In addition to the connections
going to the antenna and the Cisco wireless device, you need to connect the
lightning arrestor to an earth ground (usually an 8-foot copper or steel rod,
placed 6 or 7 feet into the ground).You should make this connection with the
ground lug attached to the lightning arrestor and with at least a #6 copper wire.
Once these connections are complete, ensure the connections are sound, power
on or connect the equipment, and it is ready for use.

Chapter 9 • Cisco Aironet Accessories
Bridge and Access Point Accessories
We look at three major types of bridge and AP accessories in this section:
mounting kits, power supplies, and the serial conﬁguration cable.Whether you
are installing the AP on a plywood backboard, on drywall, or on a pole, the
mounting kits allow for the installation of the AP or bridge in numerous different
ways.When installing the AP or bridge be sure to choose a location that is free
from large metal structures (such as ﬁling cabinets or shelving), microwave ovens,
and 2 GHz cordless phones, because these items could interfere with the perfor-
mance of the AP or bridge.The spare power supplies described here are an inex-
pensive spare that are easy to replace—keeping one on-hand can help you
minimize the downtime of your wireless system.The ﬁnal accessory, the AP or
bridge serial cable, allows for the conﬁguration of the AP even when the network
to it is unavailable.
Bridge Mounting Kit
You can mount an AP or bridge several different ways.The easiest method is to
simply put a couple of screws into either a plywood backboard or drywall and
attaching the AP or bridge to them. Depending on the type of AP or bridge you
have, you will need either two or four screws and wall anchors to properly use
this approach.

If you have an AP with a plastic case, you need only two #6 metal screws and
two #6–#8 wall anchors.The ﬁrst step is to download the mounting template,
which you can retrieve from Cisco’s Web site at: www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/
doc/product/wireless/airo_350/350wgb/wgbrdgmi.htm.
Print the template and use it to determine placement of the holes for
drilling.After you print it, ensure that the template holes are indeed 4.75 inches
apart. Once you verify this, you can place the template in the location you wish
to mount the AP and mark the holes for drilling. If for whatever reason you
cannot retrieve the template, you can approximate the location you wish to
mount the AP or bridge and install the wall anchors and screws 4.75 inches
apart, in a horizontal or vertical conﬁguration depending on your particular
installation. Once you mark the drilling location, use a 3/16-inch bit to drill a 
1-inch deep hole for each wall anchor.Then install the wall anchors and screws,
making sure to leave a small gap between the wall anchor and screw head.You
can then position the mounting holes on the back of the AP or bridge over the
screws and slide it into place.
The design of the metal case APs and bridges use low smoke producing char-
acteristics and have enhanced ﬁre resistance.Though you still need to install these
APs and bridges indoors, the plenum-rated case gives you the ability to place the
AP or bridge in suspended ceilings and in other environmental air space.The
metal case also extends the operating temperature range of the AP or bridge from
the normal 32 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit (0 to 50 degrees Celsius) to –4 to 131
degrees Fahrenheit (–20 to 55 degrees Celsius). Mounting the metal case AP or
bridges requires four #6 metal screws, and four #6–#8 wall anchors.As was true
with the plastic case AP or bridge, the ﬁrst thing that you need for mounting of
the metal case AP or bridge is a template for drilling.You can retrieve the tem-
plate for the metal case installation at Cisco’s Web site at www.cisco.com/uni-
vercd/cc/td/doc/product/wireless/airo_350/accsspts/apmi/
apbrmnt.htm.
Once you retrieve and print it, you must verify that the centerlines on the tem-
plate are indeed 5.5 and 3.5 inches apart. If you cannot download the template, or
if it is not printing to scale, you can place the AP in the location you wish to install
use it to mark the locations to drill. Or you can draw a rectangle 5.5 inches long by
3.5 inches wide at the mounting location and drill at the corners of the rectangle.
Once you drill the holes, insert all of the wall anchors and the three screws that
correspond to the mounting holes in the AP or bridge leaving a small gap between
the head of the screw and the anchor. Finally, slide the AP or bridge over the
screws then install the fourth screw in the hole provided.

Chapter 9 • Cisco Aironet Accessories
If you have a more complex mounting issue than a ﬂat surface, another alter-
native is to obtain a Cisco 340 Series Bridge Mounting Kit (see Figure 9.4).This
kit contains a metal back plate that is approximately 7.25 inches by 4.75 inches
and has predrilled screw holes that will allow for the attachment of the 340 to
the plate.You can then fasten this plate to a ﬂat surface, or you can use some of
the other fasteners that come with the kit. Speciﬁcally, you can attach a set of
beam clamps to the metal back plate allowing you to attach the bridge to an 
I-beam or similar surface.Alternately, you can use the antenna clamp kit to attach
the back plate to a pole or mast that is up to 1.5 inches in diameter.
Bridge Slide Mount Kit
The bridge slide mount kit (see Figure 9.5) is another method that you can use
to attach the bridge to a ﬂat surface.This kit consists of a metal mounting plate
that has predrilled holes and notches cut in it, and a plastic mounting plate that
has tabs speciﬁcally designed to ﬁt in the metal plate. In addition, the kit comes
with four 8-32-inch by 5/16-inch mounting screws.You can use these screws to
attach the plastic plate to the back of the bridge. Following this, you fasten the
metal plate to any ﬂat surface in the area in which you wish to mount the AP or
bridge.With the bridge attached to the plastic plate, you can slide the tabs of the
plastic plate into the slots in the metal plate, and then lock it into place. Once

complete, you have securely mounted the bridge to the metal plate. In fact, the
ﬁrst couple of times you install or remove the bridge, you may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to
lock or unlock the tabs in place.

Figure 9.5 Slide Mounting Kit
Equipment Placement
When installing the Cisco AP, bridge, or any device for that matter, place-
ment of the device can greatly affect long term stability and consistent
service. In larger installations, with raised ﬂoor space speciﬁcally set
aside for networking and other technology equipment, this is not much
of an issue. However, in smaller installations where you put the net-
working equipment in a back closet that was chosen only because it had
a power source, some forethought can be invaluable.
In these smaller installations, one of the most important items in
choosing an installation location, is to try to keep the equipment out of
heavily traveled areas as well as away from doorways. In both of these
cases, there is a higher probability that the equipment will be bumped
or knocked off its mounting platform. The potential issue in a high
trafﬁc area is relatively easy to see, the more people that are walking by
Conﬁguring & Implementing…
Continued

456
Chapter 9 • Cisco Aironet Accessories

a location, the greater the probability that someone will accidentally
come in contact with the device. The reason to be careful when
installing by a doorway is twofold. First, as the door is opened and
closed, the wall to which the door is attached will vibrate slightly. If the
equipment is mounted to this wall, over time this vibration could affect
its performance. The second reason to be careful when installing around
a doorway, is similar to the issue with the high trafﬁc area. As people
come through a door, they can not necessarily see what is on the other
side, and if they are in a hurry and trying to avoid an obstacle, they could
run into the device or the mounting platform. Or, if they are struggling
to open the door while carrying something, an accident could happen.
Another issue with placement comes into play when networking
items are installed on a shelf. In many smaller ofﬁces, space is usually at
a premium. As a result, if there is room above, below, or around the net-
work equipment it will eventually be used by the ofﬁce staff for storage.
Such activity could not only have an immediate impact on the system by
disrupting power or a cable, it could have a delayed impact due to the
vents of the equipment being covered causing the device to overheat. To
alleviate this potential issue, either put the networking equipment in a
small enclosure, or if that is not an option, try to ﬁnd a shelf that is out
of the way and closely matches the dimensions of the equipment being
installed.
Finally, in many smaller ofﬁces, especially those in strip malls or
small, freestanding buildings, power ﬂuctuations can be a problem.
These can range from blackouts to power sags and power spikes. For
electrical equipment such as lights and fans, this ﬂuctuation does not
affect them in the long term. However, these ﬂuctuations can affect del-
icate networking equipment that is expecting clean uninterrupted
power. Therefore, if you are in a situation such as this, a small uninter-
ruptible power supply (UPS) may be of beneﬁt to you. Simply plug the
UPS into the building power and plug your networking equipment into
the UPS. The goal of this setup is not only to keep the network equip-
ment functioning in the event of a short outage, but also to condition
the power being supplied to the networking equipment. Though the
UPS may not fully condition the power, it will ﬂatten out the peaks and
valleys. In addition, many UPS units now come with management soft-
ware and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) capabilities.
This then gives you a simple tool to determine the overall power stability
in a new location or one that is having problems and can help you in
making a decision as to whether or not the expense is necessary. 
For example, when a new location is installed, put in the UPS unit and
Continued

As you can see, the value to using this solution comes in the ease of upgrades,
component replacement, or normal maintenance. Because you are able to remove
the bridge from the mount without any tools, you can easily take it down to
work on it. In addition, because the plastic plate attaches directly to the bridge, in
the event of a bridge replacement, you can easily attach this plate at your desk or
workbench then snap the entire component back into place when the replace-
ment is complete.
Access Point / Bridge Spare Power Supplies
One of the easiest and most inexpensive spare components to keep in your
inventory is a spare power supply for your AP or bridge. Having such a spare can
mean the difference between a minor short term outage and having a long-term
outage that has a major impact on your business.You have several options for
spare power supplies.You can obtain power supplies that ﬁt either 110 or 220
current depending on your need.
WARNING
Though newer power injectors have protection against supplying power
to a standard Ethernet port, older power injectors did not. Therefore, do
not plug a power injector into a standard Ethernet port because it could
damage the power injector as well as the network equipment.
The 350 series bridge and AP have another option: an inline power injector
(see Figure 9.6).The power injector is connected to both the to the AP or bridge
via a standard Category 5 UTP cable. In addition, another Category 5 UTP cable
is connected to the other side of the injector and runs to your hub or switch.
The Ethernet connection between the AP or bridge and your hub or switch is
made via this path. In addition to carrying the Ethernet signal to and from the
AP or bridge, the UTP cable connecting the AP or bridge to the injector also

software and monitor it for three to six months. If the power is solid,
and you see few or no sags or spikes, take the UPS out and move it to
another location where this ﬂuctuation is occurring. Contact your local
power company to resolve any problems and keep the UPS in place until
they are resolved.

Chapter 9 • Cisco Aironet Accessories
carries the power needed to run the AP or bridge.The power injector supplies
this power by utilizing the unused pairs in the Cat5 cable. Speciﬁcally, the nega-
tive current is sent on the cables on pins 4 and 5, and the positive is sent on the
cables on pins 7 and 8. By using the power injector, you are able to put the AP or
bridge in an area that is not near a power source.
In addition to the power injector, the 350 series products can also obtain
their power from inline power capable Catalyst 3524-PWR-XL switch or by
using an inline power patch panel.As was the case with the power injector, these
solutions also send the power via the Cat5 UTP cable.
Access Point / Bridge Serial Cable
You can establish remote conﬁguration of your AP or bridge by using,Telnet,
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP),Trivial File
Transfer Protocol (TFTP), or SNMP, depending on the device being accessed.
You can use the serial cable (see Figure 9.7) that comes with the AP or bridge, or
sold separately, for local access to the device.This cable is a straightthrough cable
that has a male DB-9 connector on one end and a female DB-9 connector on
the other.
Connect the male end of the cable to the AP or bridge and the female end to
the COM1 or COM2 port on your PC.Then using a dumb terminal emulator

(DTE), such as HyperTerminal, set the port settings for the appropriate COM
port to: 9600 bits per second, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, and set ﬂow con-
trol to Xon/Xoff. Once you set these and make a connection, you will be able to
access and manage the AP or bridge. For reference,Table 9.1 shows the standard
pinout and function of a PC serial port. Note that the pinouts and signal direc-

NEMA Enclosures
In areas where your bridge or AP is exposed to wide ranges of temperatures or is
likely to be exposed to weather such as rain, snow, and so on, you may need to
house the devices within a NEMA enclosure. In general, NEMA enclosures are
typically watertight boxes used to mount equipment outside to protect it from
the elements. NEMA enclosures are available that are heated and/or cooled.
Speciﬁcally, a NEMA enclosure is any enclosure that conﬁrms to the
National Electrical Manufacturers Association guidelines.Though NEMA deﬁnes
speciﬁcations for numerous types of electrical equipment, speciﬁcation 250-1997
describes the applications and feature available speciﬁcally for enclosures (with a
power rating under 1,000 volts).You can get an overview of these guidelines free
of charge from the NEMA Web site at www.nema.org. In addition to the
overview, you can purchase the entire speciﬁcation, as well as manufacturing
speciﬁcations at this site.This document divides enclosures into different types
according to the type of protection they are designed to provide.Table 9.2 gives a
summary of these types.

Because Cisco does not offer NEMA enclosures, if required for an installa-
tion, you will need to obtain a NEMA enclosure from another source. In general,
you can obtain these enclosures through your cabling or electrical supply vendor.
By going through them ﬁrst, they may be aware of enclosures that meet your
speciﬁcations and that are speciﬁcally designed for the cabling or equipment you
are using. If you are unable to obtain the type of enclosure you are looking for
through these sources, you can check national electrical or telecommunications
supply companies, such as Anixter (www.anixter.com). In addition, if you know
the speciﬁcs on the enclosure that you wish to purchase, try searching the
Internet search to ﬁnd a retailer that has exactly what you are looking for.

systems performance. Once you take the items outside your control (for example,
weather, line of site, and so on) into account, the design of a wireless system shifts
to items within your control.We have already looked at antenna choices; there-
fore, the next item to examine is how the signal gets to and from the antenna.
This communications occurs over cabling and through connectors and bulkheads.
Each of which we examine in the course of this section.
Cabling
It may seem strange that wiring can have an impact on a wireless system, but
choosing the wrong cabling could mean the difference between the success or
failure of your wireless system. Speciﬁcally, the cabling being referred to is the
cabling between the AP and the antenna.This cabling carries both the signals
from the AP or bridge to the antenna and from the antenna to the AP or bridge.
The cabling that is used in most installations for this purpose is coaxial, or
coax, cable (see Figure 9.8). Coaxial cable comes in many different varieties and
sizes, but all of these different types share a common construction. In the center
of a coaxial cable is a single conductor.This conductor may be solid, stranded, or
in some rare instance, a tube, and is usually made of copper. Surrounding this
conductor is a dielectric material that acts as an insulator. One common dielec-
tric that is used for this purpose is solid or foam-based polyethylene. On top of
this dielectric, a shielding layer is added.This layer can be a wire braid, a foil
wrap, a metal tube, or a combination of these items.Though a metal tube pro-
vides the best overall performance, the overall ﬂexibility of the cable suffers. In
many instances, a foil wrap is used in conjunction with a wire braid to allow for
cable ﬂexibility as well as good protection. Finally, an outer jacket is added to the
cable.A common material for this jacket is Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC).This jacket
protects the outer most conductor in the cable.
The signal on a coaxial cable travels on the center conductor of the coaxial
cable.The outer conductor, whether that be a wire braid, foil, or both, acts a
shield from outside interference as well as a ground for the cable.The dielectric
compound that separates the two parts acts as an insulator and ensures that the

Chapter 9 • Cisco Aironet Accessories
center conductor stays in or very close to the center of the cable.This combina-
tion of the outer conductive shielding and insulating material allows the cable to
carry signals with minimal interference and distortion.
The impedance of coaxial cable can range from 35 to 185 ohms, however, the
most common values are 50, 75, and 93 ohms. For use with the Cisco wireless
devices, you should use 50-ohm cable.This is because the Cisco wireless devices
are manufactured with 50 ohm components, and for most efﬁcient energy
transfer, all parts of a system; transmitter, cabling, and receiver should have the
same impedance values.
RG-58 and RG-8 Cabling
Though the origin of the acronym RG can not be determined for certain, the
general belief is that it was derived from U.S. military terminology and stands for
“Radio Grade.”This is because, the basis of the RG grading values is U.S. mili-
tary speciﬁcations, speciﬁcally MIL-C-17. From these general speciﬁcation, cable
manufacturing companies produce multiple different variations of these cables
that have different performance characteristics. Many characteristics can change
from cable to cable, including attenuation, shielding type and quality, dielectric
type and quality, ﬂexibility of the cable, bend radius, center conductor material,
shielding material, and outer cover material.All of these characteristics have an
impact on the overall cable performance.
The two most common cable types used for Cisco wireless systems are RG-
58 and RG-8. Both RG-58 and RG-8 are have 50-ohm impedance values,
matching the impedance that is found on the AP or bridge.Though very similar,
the major difference between RG-58 and RG-8 is the center conductor size.The
RG-8 center conductor is almost twice as large as the RG-58 center conductor
is. Because of this size difference, RG-8 cabling has better transmission qualities
for the frequency range that the APs and bridges use.Therefore, for longer runs
or runs that need to have a higher quality cable, RG-8 is preferred. However, in
some situations, the performances of standard RG-58 or RG-8 cabling will still
not meet the installation requirements. In these cases, you should look at the pos-
sibility of using specially designed low-loss or ultra low-loss coaxial cabling,
9913 Cabling
9913 cabling is a low-loss coaxial cable speciﬁcally designed and manufactured by
Belden cable. Due to its success, many other cable manufacturing companies manu-
facture their cable to the Belden 9913 speciﬁcations.This cable will perform sub-
stantially better than a normal RG-58 or RG-8 cable, but the RG-58 or RG-8

cable will cost less. However, you can easily justify the additional cost if you require
high performance or have a long run to the antenna.The cable itself is a 50-ohm
RG-8 coaxial cable and comes in two separate varieties, the 9913 and the newly
released 9913F.Though both of these cables are low-loss, and use the same outer
conductor design, there are some differences in how they are constructed.
The 9913 cable by Belden (See Figure 9.9) has a single copper conductor that
is 9.5 AWG (American Wire Gauge).The dielectric that is used is a semisolid
polyethylene in a helical construction. Due to this construction technique, the cable
has numerous air pockets. In an outdoor environment, in the event of a faulty ter-
mination or cable slice, there is a possibility for water to collect in these pockets
rendering the cable useless.Therefore, when using this cable outside, you should be
careful to keep the cable watertight. Finally, the outer coating of the 9913 is PVC.
By contrast, the 9913F (see Figure 9.10), also manufactured by Belden has a
stranded center conductor made up of 19 tightly wound cables to give an overall
conductor size of 10 AWG.The dielectric used in the 9913F is a nitrogen gas-
injected foam polyethylene.This process creates a solid dielectric layer with minimal
difference from the 9913 cable in attenuation loss at higher frequencies.The solid
dielectric also helps the cable stand up better in wet conditions.The ﬁnal difference
between the 9913 and the 9913F is that the outer sheath on the 9913F is made out
of Belﬂex, which was created by Belden for added ruggedness and ﬂexibility.

Transmission and Transmission Media Terminology
In the course of this chapter, as well as in the book, we have used some
terms in describing the characteristics of transmission media that were
not necessarily explained. Therefore, we wanted to take this opportunity
to further explain what some of these terms mean. For this discussion,
we focus primarily on the terms that affect cabling and connectors.
The ﬁrst of these terms that you hear quite often is decibels, or dB.
The dB scale is used to measure the power of a signal and is logarithmic
in nature. In general, every 3 dB increase in signal strength doubles the
power of a signal. For example, increasing the signal strength from 10
dB to 13 dB doubles the power of the signal. This can then be applied
to the transmit power ratings associate with the Cisco wireless devices.
For example, a 100 milliwatt transmit power setting translates to a 20
dBm (m standing for milliwatt) signal. A 50-milliwatt transmit power
setting translates to a 17-dBm signal. Moreover, the progression con-
tinues with the 20, 5, 2, and 1 milliwatt corresponding to 13, 7, 3 and
0 dBm respectively. You may also hear dB referred to as dBi. The “i” in
this case refers to comparing the signal to a theoretical isotope that radi-
ates energy equally in all directions. For example, an antenna that is
rated at 6 dBi will enhance the signal strength by fourfold.
The impedance of a cable has been described as the AC equivalent
to resistance. The speciﬁc impedance of any cable is determined at the
time of manufacturing. You can obtain the impedance value of a cable
or connector by examining the voltage and current characteristics of the
cable or conductor over the operating frequency range of the cable. This
information is then put into a formula that determines the overall
impedance of the cable. As was mentioned in the cabling section,
impedance should match across all components used in a system.
Another term that is used quite often is attenuation. This is nothing
more than the reduction of the amplitude of the electrical signal.
Attenuation is affected not only by material type, but also by length of
cable as well as the frequency at which the signal is transmitted. All
things being equal, a lower frequency signal will have a lower attenua-
tion of the length of a cable but will also be able to transmit less data.
Obviously, in your installations the lower the attenuation the better.
Finally, we discuss the term Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR).
Due to irregularities in cabling and connectors, the signal on a cable will

Connectors
Along with the cabling, one of the items that can have the largest impact on the
quality of the signal that the bridge or AP receives is the connector that is used.
Connectors are used to interface the cabling with the AP or bridge as well as the
antenna or bulkhead.As was previously discussed, the primary type of cabling
used to connect the AP or bridge to the antenna is coaxial.Therefore, for the
purpose of this book, we discuss only coaxial connectors. Because coaxial cable is
used for numerous applications, you can ﬁnd a wide variety of connectors,
coming in different shapes, sizes, and containing different characteristics.As was
the case with the cabling, you need to choose a connector that matches the
impedance of the system being installed and that is capable of handling the power
and frequency range of this system.When selecting a connector, you also need to
ensure that you use one that is appropriate for the environment in which it will
be installed. For example, you should not use a connector rated for indoor use in
an exterior installation. Some of the more popular types of coaxial conductors are
BNC, F, N, and TNC.
RP-TNC Connectors
As the introduction stated, there are many different varieties of coaxial connec-
tors, however, the Cisco APs, bridges, and accessories use primarily the RP-TNC
connector (see Figure 9.11).You may have noticed that the RP-TNC connector
was not in the list of popular types.This is because FCC regulations (part 15.203)
state that all wireless devices with removable antenna are required to have “non-
standard” connectors.The meaning of nonstandard has been debated, however for
our case, it means that Cisco APs, bridges, and antennas come with RP-TNC
connectors.
At ﬁrst glance, the design of the RP-TNC connector looks exactly like a
TNC connector.This is because it was based on the TNC design.The TNC con-
nector was ﬁrst made in the 1950s as an improvement upon the Bayonet-Neill-
Concelman (BNC) connector.The TNC connector is usually a little over .5

be reﬂected back onto itself. These reﬂections cause dips and peaks in the
amplitude of the signal. VSWR is simply a measure of the ratio of peak to
dip voltage. If there were no reﬂections in the cable the VSWR would be
1:1, however, not many devices are perfect, so when looking at devices,
one with a lower VSWR ratio has better transmission qualities.

Chapter 9 • Cisco Aironet Accessories
inches in diameter and has a threaded connection.The threads allow for a consis-
tent ﬁt that will not be easily compromised by movement or vibration.The TNC
as well as the RP-TNC connector can handle frequencies up 11 GHz, well
within the range used by Cisco wireless devices.
The difference between a normal TNC connector and a RP-TNC connector
comes in where the female and male contacts are located. Speciﬁcally, in a TNC
connector, the male contact is in the plug connector and the female connector is
in the jack. In the RP-TNC, the contacts are reversed. In this manner, it is
assured that equipment not suited for wireless use can not be accidentally con-
nected to an AP or bridge.
Bulkhead Extenders
Bulkhead extenders are cables that have a normal connector, such as an RP-
TNC, on one end and a bulkhead connector on the other. Because we have
already discussed normal connectors, we focus on the bulkhead connector at this
point.A bulkhead is nothing more than a mounting style of connector. Primarily
bulkheads are inserted through a premade panel or precut hole and secured by a
nut screwed onto the end of the connector. By installing a bulkhead, you are able
to attach a cable or antenna pigtail to a secure point that will not move around
and ensure a watertight ﬁt around the connector.You can use bulkhead extenders
to easily move a bulkhead connector to another location, such as onto another
panel or from the inside to the outside of an NEMA enclosure.This method-
ology allows for a watertight seal around the cable that can easily be relocated if
necessary.This seal is crucial in environments where sensitive electronic equip-
ment is installed in locations that are outside the normal operating speciﬁcations

of the equipment.The main bulkhead extender that Cisco sells for use with its
APs and bridges is a 60-inch extender (see Figure 9.12).This bulkhead extender
is made from RG-58 cable with RP-TNC connectors.The jack side of the RP-
TNC connector has the bulkhead connector on it.
Radio Country Options
Due to differing regulations in each country, different RF frequencies are allowed
to be used by wireless devices. In addition, because many of the items shipped
have encryption greater than 64-bit, special export regulations need to be fol-
lowed, or in some cases, certain products can’t be exported to particular countries
at all.To accommodate these needs, Cisco originally created an individual
country option or “Air Country” code for each country. For example the
country option for France was,AIR-05-FRANCE, the code for Italy was AIR-
18-ITALY, and the code for the US was AIR-01-US. In total, approximately 70
country codes were deﬁned.
To simplify stocking as well as customer support, Cisco decided to alter this
system. Speciﬁcally, the change was to group the countries into areas that all had
similar requirements.After analyzing the different products that each country
allows, it was determined that the countries fell into three different groups, the
Americas, Europe, and Japan (see Table 9.3).Though not all of the countries ﬁt
exactly in the groupings for their geographic area, most did. Cisco then changed
www.syngress.com
Figure 9.12 60-Inch Bulkhead Extender

470
Chapter 9 • Cisco Aironet Accessories
their part numbers to reﬂect these groupings as well as to indicate which prod-
ucts had greater than 64-bit encryption by adding information to the end of the
existing part number. For example, part number AIR-BR350-E-K9 still refers to
a 350 Bridge (part #AIR-BR350), however the “-E” means that it used the
“European” frequencies and power and the “-K9” means that the encryption is
greater than 64 bits.

Finally, to ensure that products were not being shipped to countries where
they are prohibited, Cisco created a product/country matrix showing which
products are approved for shipment to which country as well as the group that
each country belongs to.Table 9.4 contains information from some selected loca-
tions. Products that are approved for order and shipment to a country are marked
in the table as “Permitted.” Products that are not approved for order and ship-
ment to a country are marked in the table as “—.” If you would like a more

Chapter 9 • Cisco Aironet Accessories
Summary
By now, you should be well on your way to answering the questions posed at the
beginning of the chapter and completing your installation.The information cov-
ered in this chapter gave speciﬁc details on antenna accessories,AP, and bridge
accessories, cabling and connectors, as well as Radio Country options.
The antenna accessories covered in this chapter include mounting kits for
Yagi and dipole antennas, as well as a discussion on the appropriate use of the
lightning arrestor with grounding ring.The Yagi articulating mount allows for the
installation and position of a Yagi antenna because it can move on both the hori-
zontal and vertical plane. Because the Yagi antenna is a directional antenna, this
movement is critical to getting the antenna properly aligned.The magnetic
mount that you can purchase from Cisco is speciﬁcally designed for dipole
antennas.This magnetic base mount allows it to be easily installed, repositioned,
or removed from a metallic surface. Lightning protection is an important con-
cerns for any wireless installation.The lightning arrestor with grounding ring will
provide protection from nearby lightning strikes but not a direct strike. Due to
this care, should be taken when installing your antenna to ensure it is located in a
place that has a low likelihood of being directly struck by lightning.
Numerous accessories are available for the Cisco 340 and 350 series bridges
and APs.Though you can mount these APs on a simple ﬂat surface with nothing
more than a couple of screws, mounting kits are available that will allow for them
to be mounted on I-beams or on poles or masts. In addition, the Slide Mounting
kit will allow for the AP or bridge to be taken down for service or repair
without any tools. Once the service is complete, you can then remount it, once
again without the need for any tools.The serial cable that comes with the AP or
bridge is nothing more than a straightthrough cable with a male and female DB-
9 connector, which you can connect to the COM port of any PC to allow for
local access to the AP or bridge. NEMA enclosures come in many different varia-
tions that you can install to ﬁt just about any installation need.They can be
heated or cooled, if needed, and depending on type, provide different levels of
protection for the equipment.Though Cisco does not sell NEMA enclosures, you
can get them from your local cable or electrical supply dealer, from a national
electrical or cable supply company, or through an Internet search.
Cabling and connectors are an integral part of the overall wireless solution.
Speciﬁcally, the cabling and connectors connect the antenna to the AP or bridge.
The cabling is a coaxial cable that has a 50-ohm impedance. In most cases, the
speciﬁc type of cabling is either RG-8 or RG-58. In cases where you need

Cisco Aironet Accessories • Chapter 9
473
longer cabling runs or higher performance, you should use low-loss or ultra low-
loss coaxial cabling such as Belden’s 9913 and 9913F.You must use connectors to
attach the cabling to the antenna,AP, or bridge. In most cases with Cisco’s wire-
less solution, the connector of choice is the RP-TNC.The RP-TNC connector
is a normal TNC connector that has been modiﬁed to ﬁt FCC regulations.
Speciﬁcally the RP-TNC is still a threaded connector, but instead of the male
contact being in the plug end of the connector, it is in the jack end. Finally, we
examined bulkheads.A bulkhead is nothing more than a connector that has the
capability to be mounted to a surface. Usually, the bulkhead already has a cable
attached to it.This conﬁguration allows you to securely connect a cable to a jack
that will not move or drift over time while providing a watertight seal around the
connector.
In the ﬁnal section of this chapter, we looked at the Radio County options.
Due to differing international laws and restrictions on the use and implementa-
tion of wireless devices, Cisco developed the Radio Country options to differen-
tiate the type of product that is permitted in each country. Because of the
streamlining of this process, Cisco took over 70 different country speciﬁc options
and put each country into one of three categories: the Americas, Europe, and
Japan.This streamlined approach allowed Cisco to better track which feature set
goes in which country.Along with the restrictions applied in each country, Cisco
also must deal with export restrictions due to the 128-bit encryption on some of
their components.To deal with this issue, they created a table that shows which
device type is allowed by type and by country.A sampling of this table as well as
a link to the table itself is provided in the Radio Country section of this chapter.

 When installing your Yagi antenna, you can position the antenna
correctly by using the Yagi articulating mount, which adjusts on both
the vertical as well as horizontal planes.
 The magnetic antenna mount sold by Cisco is speciﬁcally used for
dipole antenna and is the replacement for the older style dipole mounts.
 Consider lightning protection when planning any wireless system.The
lightning arrestor with grounding ring can provide protection for the
interior equipment in the event of a nearby lightning strike.

Bridge and Access Point Accessories
 You can mount the Cisco 340 or 350 series AP or bridge to a ﬂat
surface with nothing more than a few screws and a template from the
Cisco Web site. However, if you have a unique mounting requirement or
want greater ﬂexibility, a number of mounting kits are available from
Cisco.
 Spare power supplies are available form Cisco that you can use as ﬁeld
replacements for existing power supplies.This includes the inline power
injector that allows power to be supplied to the 350 bridge or AP via a
Category 5 UTP cable.
 The serial cable used to conﬁgure the 340 and 350 series APs and
bridges is a straightthrough cable with a male and female DB-9
connector of the respective ends.
 NEMA enclosures can provide appropriate levels of protection for
wireless equipment that needs to be installed in locations that are not
suitable for electronic equipment.This can be due to excessive dust, dirt,
water, other foreign material, temperature range, or a combination of
these factors.
Cabling, Connectors, and Bulkhead Extenders
 There are a number of cabling options for connecting the AP or bridge
to the antenna. For longer runs or in situations where high performance
is required, you should use special low-loss cabling.
 The main connector used by Cisco in their wireless solution is the RP-
TNC connector.This allows for a secure connection between
components that will not be affected by normal movement or vibration.
 A bulkhead connector is a connector that can be attached to a ﬂat
surface or panel.This allows for a stable connection point for cabling
that will not require addition fasteners to keep it from moving or
drifting, while providing a watertight seal around the connector.

Radio Country Options
 Due to differing regulations in different countries, the frequency ranges
used for transmission of the Cisco APs and bridges vary based on the
destination country.
 The three main groupings of AP types are the Americas, Europe, and
Japan.The Americas version of the AP has 11 RF channels, the Europe
version has 13 RF channels, and the Japan version has 14 RF channels.
 Cisco must follow special export regulations when exporting equipment
that has greater than 64-bit encryption.As a result, not all of the Cisco
340 and 350 series product lines can be sold in every country.
Q: Where do I go to ﬁnd more information about the performance characteris-
tics of my speciﬁc cable and connectors?
A: The best place to start looking for this information is with the cable or con-
nector manufacturer.They should have detailed speciﬁcation sheets available
for each of their product lines.You can also talk to a cabling Value Added
Reseller (VAR). Many VARs have speciﬁcation sheets from a number of
manufacturers that they can provide you.
Q: Where can I ﬁnd more information on lightning protection?
A: We recommend reading two articles.These are both from a journal called
QST, which is published by the American Radio Relay League (AARL), the
national association for amateur radio.They cover a fair amount of informa-
tion by themselves but also give further references if you wish to get more
information on a particular subject.These articles (available online along with
other lightning protection material at www.arrl.org/tis/info/lightning.html)
are Mike Tracy’s “Lab Notes—Lightning Protection—Part 1”, QST, October

Hack Proofing Your Wireless Network
Traditionally, someone had to be sitting in front of your computer to read your docu-
ments, see your e-mail, and play with your settings. Today, however, someone can be
sitting in the office next door, a few floors up, or even in the next building, and have
the same abilities as if he were in front of your computer. Are you using an 802.11
or Bluetooth device on your computer? Are you using a PDA to communicate with
other systems or to get onto the Internet? Are you using a cellular phone to initiate a
network connection back to your office? Have you just set up the latest wireless
gateway at home? Are you planning on implementing a wireless solution in your
office? Then you need Hack Proofing Your Wireless Network.
