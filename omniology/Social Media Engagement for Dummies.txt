About the Authors
Aliza Sherman is a pioneer and visionary in the web industry who travels 
the world to speak to diverse audiences about the Internet, social media, 
mobile marketing, new technologies and applications, entrepreneurship, and 
women’s issues. She founded the ﬁrst woman-owned, full-service Internet 
company — Cybergrrl, Inc. — and the ﬁrst global organization for women — 
Webgrrls International. A serial entrepreneur, she also started one of the 
first social media marketing agencies and one of the first mobile marketing 
consultancies. Newsweek named Aliza one of the “Top 50 People Who Matter 
Most on the Internet” for her early Internet work, and Fast Company named 
her one of the “Most Powerful Women in Technology.” She is the author of 
ten books, most of them about business and the Internet. She and Danielle 
co-authored the book MOM, Incorporated.
Danielle Elliott Smith is a digital correspondent, host, storyteller, speaker, 
media trainer, and (most importantly), mom to two sweet and sassy small 
people — Delaney, 9, and Cooper, 7. In her “free time,” Danielle juggles work 
as the founder of ExtraordinaryMommy.com and DanielleSmithMedia.com, 
and she hosts and produces her lifestyle series, “Keeping Style in Your Life.” 
She also creates original content for the well-known online magazines Babble 
and SheKnows and shares vlogging and media tips for people wanting to jump 
on camera. An award-winning former television news anchor and reporter, 
she has covered everything from the red carpet at the Academy of Country 
Music Awards to the Vancouver Olympics Games and the NFL Pro Bowl in 
Hawaii. Danielle has been featured on the CBS Early Show, NPR, MSNBC, 
CNN, and Fox News and in USA Today, Publishers Weekly, and Pregnancy & 
Newborn. This is her second book; she had the pleasure of co-writing her first 
one, Mom, Incorporated, with Aliza.

Dedication
From Aliza Sherman: To my loving family: Greg, my Renaissance man 
husband, and Noa Grace, 6, who now knows why Mommy had her nose in a 
computer — again.
From Danielle Elliott Smith: To my extraordinary husband, Jeff, for holding 
my hand throughout this process. I couldn’t have done it without you. I’m 
one lucky girl. And to my sweet small people — Punky and Coop — thank you 
for inspiring me to live my passion and for proving to me that I truly can do 
both: be your mom and live this dream. I’m grateful for you every day.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
We’d like to thank our families and good friends, who have been supportive 
of us throughout the book-writing process.
Thank you to our team at John Wiley & Sons, Inc. — especially Nicole Sholly 
and Amy Fandrei, who guided us beautifully through this process and held 
our hands when we needed it. Many thanks also to Kathy Simpson, Rebecca 
Whitney, Amanda Graham, Joe Waters, and everyone behind the scenes who 
helped make this book a reality. A monumental thank you as well to Ellen 
Gerstein, who saw potential in us from the beginning and believed that this 
was our next book. Ellen, you and Amy were right.
We’d also like to thank our book agent, Jessica Faust, of BookEnds LLC.
Special thanks to the many folks from companies, big and small, who 
shared their stories and thoughts on social media engagement with us so 
generously, many of whom are now featured in this book. Your input was 
invaluable and so appreciated.
We’d especially like to thank the members of our communities in our favorite 
social networks — people who connect with us regularly and make our day. 
We are grateful for your support.
And you, our readers — thank you for choosing this book to guide you on 
your social media engagement journey. We hope that your journey into this 
digital space is an exciting one.

From Aliza Sherman: I couldn’t have completed this book without my 
co-author, Danielle, who jumped on this book-writing adventure with me 
back in 2011 to co-create MOM, Incorporated. The book journey was a new 
challenge for us both and one that I couldn’t have tackled without her by 
my virtual side, to talk me off the ledge and to infuse the contents with her 
incredible spirit. Cheers to you, my friend!
An extra-special thank you to my husband, Greg, my daughter Noa Grace, to 
my parents, Lucy and Mike Sherman, and my sister Leah. All five share the 
title of my Number One Fans and Supporters.
A big thanks to Chelsea, Angeles, Erica, Kelly, Annie, and Heather for keeping 
me on track from day to day, especially when I was eyebrows-deep in the 
manuscript for this book.
A heartfelt thanks to Terry Wheatley for her encouragement and sage advice. 
I’m so lucky to count her as mentor and friend.
From Danielle Elliott Smith: As with our last book, my biggest chunk of 
gratitude heads northwest, to snow-covered Alaska, where my co-author, 
Aliza, would sit, “Skype-ing” with me, chatting by phone, hopping into a 
Google+ hangout, and e-mailing document after document back and forth 
as we labored over this book. For your willingness to work with me on yet 
another book, and for more than that — your friendship — I am grateful.
I’m thankful for the many friends who built me up, and talked me down, as 
I worked my way through this project — especially Alli and Barbara. To the 
friends who have known me for decades and still keep coming back for more: 
Rose, Karin, Erin, Heather, Taralyn, and Eileen — I adore you deep in my soul. 
And to Ally, for your patience, hard work, sweet spirit, and ability to keep me 
on track — I couldn’t do it without you.
And finally, to my family. Mum and Dad: A blanket thank-you for being 
you — two people I love deeply. To Paula and Rick, for your never-ending 
support, for your ability to make me laugh, and for giving me your son, I’m so 
thankful. To Jeff, for believing in me when I didn’t, for sleeping on the floor 
of my office so that I’d feel inspired to write, for refusing (against your better 
judgment) to yell at me for writing all night, and for being the best daddy in 
the universe: I love you, and I’m forever grateful. Delaney and Cooper, your 
enthusiasm for everything I do is contagious. I want to be you when I grow 
up. Every day, you make me better. Thank you for believing in your mommy. 
You are one of the biggest reasons I now hold this book in my hands!

Introduction
Y

ou’ve probably heard that “business as usual” is no more. The way that 
people communicate, market, and sell has changed dramatically since 
the advent of social media marketing. We’re here to tell you that even though 
the tools are new and different — and seem to change regularly — you can 
definitely find out how to master them.
Every step of the way, we coauthors emphasize the best practices of online 
marketing, customer service, and genuine human communication. As a business 
owner, you benefit from knowing not only how Internet tools work but also 
how people use them and how you can leverage them to better reach the 
customers and prospects who matter the most to you and your business.
About This Book
Social Media Engagement For Dummies starts by shedding light on the funda­
mental principles of social media engagement — the ingredients that put the 
social in social media marketing. Effective social media engagement (or SME, 
as we often refer to it throughout this book) should provide tangible and 
measurable results for your business and boost your bottom line.
By mastering the techniques in this book, you strengthen your connections 
with potential customers. But don’t stop there: Convert potential customers 
to actual customers, and then use SME tactics to turn customers into active 
and passionate evangelists for your company.
This book is a practical, hands-on guide to social media engagement, and 
we speak from experience. We don’t only consult and teach others to engage 
well via social media — we also benefit daily as business owners ourselves, 
by avidly using social networks and social media tools and platforms. We use 
these tools to communicate our messages to our respective audiences and to 
connect with the people who read, listen to, and watch what we publish online.
We build relationships with our audiences and truly care about them. In turn, 
we are humbled to see that our audiences trust us and respond positively to 
what we say and do online. We are confident that you, too, can benefit from 
social media engagement.

SME strategies and tactics into your online marketing efforts. We’re results-
oriented, and we know you are, too.

personally blog.

networks.

customers to your business, and you want to turn all your customers 
into enthusiasts.

What You Don’t Have to Read
You don’t have to read this book sequentially, and you don’t even have to 
read all its sections in any particular chapter. You can skip sidebars and read 
only the material that helps you complete the task at hand, or you can start 
by reading only the sidebars, to access information that you can apply imme­
diately to your social media engagement efforts.
How This Book Is Organized
Social Media Engagement For Dummies is split into six parts. Think of the 
earlier parts of the book as introductions to theories, concepts, and tools; 
think of the latter parts as plans for turning concepts into actions. In this 
section, we briefly describe what you’ll find in each part.
Part I: The Basics of Social 
Media Engagement
We start this book with an overview of social media engagement, from under­
standing the concepts to using the tools. Part I begins by justifying your 
investment in social media engagement and explaining the concepts. We 
explain measurement and the value of engaging, and we introduce a variety 
of online tools for implementing social media engagement tactics.

Part II: Exploring the Elements 
of Social Media Engagement
Moving beyond the basics, Part II delves more deeply into the concepts of 
social media engagement, including building trust and credibility, creating 
connections, and understanding the importance of being present in social 
networking. We explain how to start, and participate in, online conversations 
and drive interactions that help you achieve your business goals.
Part III: Examining the Basic 
Engagement Tools
In Part III, we review online communications tools that you may already use 
and others that you may not be using yet. We outline how to use these tools — 
from the more traditional e-mail, forums, blogs, and websites to Facebook 
and Twitter — specifically for social media engagement.
Part IV: Engaging Through 
Additional Social Channels
We don’t stop with the popular social networks covered in Part III; in Part IV, 
we look at a few up-and-coming networks that are changing the way people 
engage online. We break down the ways that Pinterest, LinkedIn, Google+, 
and location-based networks (such as Foursquare and Instagram) provide 
opportunities for engagement in more ways that drive results.
Part V: Leveraging Audio and 
Video for Engagement
We’d be remiss not to mention multimedia options for social media engagement. 
In Part V, we cover ways to use audio and video to capture your audience’s 
attention and encourage interactions. We cap this part with a close look at 
YouTube features that facilitate engagement.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In typical For Dummies fashion, this book includes The Part of Tens to give 
you quick-reference guides to social media engagement. First, we fill you in

on common social media engagement mistakes that you definitely want to 
avoid. We finish this part with the stories of ten businesses that use social 
media engagement tactics successfully.
Icons Used in This Book
What’s a For Dummies book without icons to point you to helpful information 
that’s sure to help you along your way? In this section, we briefly describe 
each icon we use in this book.
	
The Tip icon points out helpful information that’s likely to make your job easier.
	
This icon marks an interesting, useful fact that you may want to remember for 
later use.

you’re not feeling technically minded, you can skip it.
Where to Go from Here
Like any For Dummies book, this one is written to ensure that you can dive 
into any section at any time and find useful information. Parts I and II offer 
an introduction to theories, concepts, and tools; Parts III, IV, and V lay out 
distinct road maps for turning concepts into actions. Don’t hesitate to skip 
around this book and refer to it often as a step-by-step guide to completing 
a task or simply as a refresher. Use the table of contents to find the chapters 
that can serve you immediately, such as a specific social network, or check 
the index to key in on a particular concept or task.

Explaining the Why, Who, and 
How of Social Media Engagement
In This Chapter
▶	Recognizing the benefits of social media engagement
▶	Identifying the many roles of social media
▶	Deciding how your organization can best use social media
S

ocial media engagement (SME) is the “stuff that happens” during your 
social media marketing campaigns. SME is an essential part of social media 
marketing. If you don’t connect with others in social networks — and if they 
don’t respond to you — you don’t have engagement. Without engagement, 
you’re simply broadcasting messages that fall on deaf ears. Nobody wants 
that to happen, right?
In this chapter, we help you start thinking about SME, including the benefits 
of engaging with customers. We outline who participates in SME. Hint: It isn’t 
just you. We also introduce concepts that explain how SME happens — or 
how it should happen — if you’re using best practices.
If you’re being thoughtful about the way you communicate with — and connect 
with — others online, you’ll have greater success in reaching customers via 
SME. But first you need to understand what it is, how it works, and what your 
role is in making it happen.
Seeking the Benefits of Social 
Media Engagement
When will it ever end? Technology changes constantly and so quickly that 
it feels like the moment you gain a new skill or figure out how to use a new 
online tool, everything changes again and your newly acquired skills seem 
obsolete. Let’s face it: Social media engagement seems to change daily.

Part I: The Basics of Social Media Engagement 
Simply put, social media engagement (often abbreviated as SME) is the pro­
cess by which online communications and the content you post online help 
you build connections with other people within online communities. Social 
media engagement involves the use of the tools of social media — social net­
works, for example — to build relationships with others that, ideally, result in 
some kind of reaction, interaction, or action.
You may be wondering why you should consider using SME. Maybe you’re 
satisfied with your current marketing strategies that involve concrete num­
bers and set dollar amounts. Maybe you’re buying advertising in traditional 
media such as print, television, or radio and even though you’ve witnessed 
its declining effectiveness over the years, it’s what you know.
Maybe you’re committed to advertising online with banner ads, skyscraper 
ads, and interstitial (pop-up) ads. Sure, the number of click-throughs on your 
ads has declined, but you chalk it up to people being busy with publishing 
their own content and being too distracted by Facebook and Twitter activity 
to pay attention the way they used to do.
You might even be concerned about losing control of your content or 
copyrights. Nobody fully controls information that’s published online. SME 
acknowledges and encourages not only the consumption of the information 
you put out there but also lets others interpret, remix (by adding their own 
ideas), and share it. You can still protect your copyrights and trademarks 
in social media as you have been doing over the past several years on the 
Internet. But in SME, you want people to spread your message, and you need 
to let them do it in their own ways.
Let’s face it: This isn’t your grandparents’ marketing campaign. The world 
of marketing online as you once knew it has changed drastically since social 
networks entered the scene, and it’s changing even as you read this chapter.
Keeping up with changing consumer needs
Today’s consumers are using the Internet for both personal and professional 
activities, and they’re savvier than ever about the way companies like yours 
are trying to reach them. Though they’re inundated and overwhelmed by bla­
tant advertising that tries to pull at their attention, they now tune out most 
ads, especially the ones that aren’t relevant to them.
Finding out how your customers use the Internet
To reach today’s consumers online, you must understand how they use the 
Internet, which sites they visit online, what they’re looking for, and how they 
behave. Spend time pinpointing your ideal customer’s online habits. A study 
in 2012 by Experian shows that more than 91 percent of adults who go online 
use social networks regularly:

 Chapter 1: Explaining the Why, Who, and How of Social Media Engagement
http://go.experian.com/forms/experian-digital-
marketer-2012
That number is up from 65 percent from earlier in the year, as reported by 
Pew Internet Research in April 2012:

Main-Report/Internet-activities-Those-already-
online-are-doing-more.aspx
Your customers and your prospects want you to be available to them when­
ever they go online. Just as they expect a search engine to give them instant 
results for information they’re seeking, consumers who go online to search 
for your company expect that you’ll have not only a website but also a pres­
ence on at least one of their favorite social networks.
	
Add social media icons representing the social networks where your company is 
present and participating, including links directly to each network so that visi­
tors to your website can connect with you in the way they prefer. In Figure 1-1, 
you can see that The Gap embeds social media icons in the footer of its website 
so that they appear on every page.

Knowing what customers want from you
Today’s consumer takes their expectations a step further than when they 
were limited in how they could respond to companies marketing to them: 
They expect you to
	
✓	Hear them when they praise you: People willingly post both positive 
and negative statements publicly about you, your products, services, 
or company on their favorite social networks. You need to listen.

12
Part I: The Basics of Social Media Engagement 
	
✓	Respond quickly: If someone comments about a company online, that 
person expects a response — and may instantly receive responses from 
their friends, fans, and followers. You want to be part of that conversation.
	
✓	Provide a forum for them: Calling a 1-800 customer service line is no 
longer the way consumers want to ask questions, air grievances, or lavish 
praise on a company. Your presence on a social network can provide 
customers with a new way to communicate with you. We realize that it 
may seem intimidating, but they want to communicate with you publicly.
	
✓	Offer communications choices: Consumers want multiple options for 
connecting with you. Offer them a variety of options based on their 
preferences.
In short, the very people whom you’re trying to reach — your target market — 
are expecting you to be present in major social networks and not only to lurk 
there but also to be ready to interact with them.
Humanizing your brand 
in the marketplace
You may have heard the word authentic tossed around in blog posts, articles, 
workshops, or lectures as an important aspect of social media engagement. 
We understand the term to mean real, as in genuine, honest, and transparent 
rather than fake, overly commercial, insincere, or shady. We state it this way: 
Be human.
“Of course, I’m human,” you say. “And so is my team. We’re all human.” We 
know that you’re human; however, you need to be human in social networks. 
Don’t subscribe to a regimented formula, set stringent restrictions, or auto­
mate every possible action to avoid investing the time and effort it takes to 
truly engage — and to be engaging — in social networks with your following.
Putting faces to names
Being human in social media engagement starts with people, involves people, 
and ends with people. No social network functions without people who love 
to use it connecting with other people through it. For example, the cable tele­
vision company Charter posts customer service hours on Twitter and shows 
the people behind the brand. Figure 1-2 shows how Charter features a photo­
graph of its social media specialist (whose Twitter handle is @CharterAbby) 
as its Twitter icon and a photograph of its customer service team on its 
Twitter page to come across as friendly and approachable.

Your main goal in SME is to be human, real, and responsive so that people 
want to connect with you and your company in the same networks where they 
connect with their family and friends.
Attracting and engaging people
You’re entering people’s inner circles when they let you into their content 
streams. These content streams are the new online spaces where people are 
paying attention. To stand out to followers and engage them, you need to:
	
✓	Attract their attention.
	
	News feeds on social networks move quickly, and most people now skim 
the feeds or reorder them to see only what they want to see from the 
people they know and like. Use strategic and relevant words and images 
to get them to notice.
	
✓	Entice them to come to you.
	
	You want people to click on your links or images to move them away 
from the main news feed and over to the source — your website, your 
Facebook Page Wall, or another place that you own where you can 
provide them with more detailed information.
	
✓	Compel people to take some kind of action.
	
	After people notice you and click through to the destination of your 
choice, give them something to do that is measurable — preferably, 
something that connects them with you for the longer term, such as sign 
up for your e-newsletter or like your Facebook Page.

14
Part I: The Basics of Social Media Engagement 
	
✓	Give people a reason to return.
	
	Based on where you’ve directed them, provide incentive for them to 
come back to you. If they’ve signed up for an e-newsletter, draw them in 
with your messages or invite them to one of your social networks to con­
tinue the conversation.
	
✓	Convince people to do business with you.
	
	 Continue providing value, be responsive, and interactive, and prove that 
they should stay in touch with your brand. Close the sale, but don’t look 
at the sale as the end of the road. Converting a fan to a customer is only 
the beginning of a longer-term relationship.
In the age of information overload online, social media impressions must be 
even more attractive and more constant and consistent to make a dent in 
someone’s attention. And it all begins with a human touch and with genuine, 
human connections made via social networks and other social media tools 
and platforms.
Strengthening connections with customers
Social media engagement requires you to create meaningful impressions 
to build awareness, gain trust, and increase customer loyalty. Social media 
engagement also provides your happy customers with the means to spread 
the word about how great you are to their friends, fans, and followings — 
all of whom may be potential customers for you. More than anything, well-
executed SME helps you close sales and then keeps the conversations going.
	
Consumers won’t be engaged if you give them the impression that you care 
only about sales. They’re interested in having a relationship with the brands 
they love, not in consuming commercial after commercial. For ongoing 
engagement, find interesting topics to talk about and share.
When you build your presence in social networks, keep in mind that people 
aren’t only connecting with you and your brand and its representatives by 
liking your Facebook Fan Page or following you on Pinterest — they’re also 
connecting with other people who like your brand.
By way of social networks, people can display their affinities — the things 
they like — in their feeds or content streams and on their profiles, pages, 
timelines, and walls. What they like is a reflection of who they are, and it con­
nects them with like-minded people for online interaction. You want people 
to show how much they like your brand, to display their connection to 
you, and, in turn, to expose your brand to their online connections. When a 
person likes a Facebook Page, the action appears in that person’s News Feed, 
and the Page icons for the brand are displayed on their timeline, as shown in 
Figure 1-3.

Provide people with a place to connect with you via Facebook, Twitter, 
YouTube, LinkedIn, and other social networks that are appropriate to your 
brand. Cultivate communities of engaged fans and followers — wherever 
you’ve built your company’s social media presences that feel welcoming to 
customers and prospects alike. By making strong and consistent connections 
with your customers, you’re laying the groundwork for turning customers 
into evangelists and avid ambassadors for your brand.
Tapping into new markets
Social media engagement includes using online networks and tools for out­
reach and interactions. The nature of many of the networks you use for 
engagement provides you with a built-in reach beyond your immediate audi­
ence. Some networks have features that amplify your messages and reach 
better than others.
For example, on Facebook when fans of your Page like, comment on, or share 
your posts, their friends can see signs of their interaction with your Page. You 
have the potential to increase your reach exponentially to your fans’ friends. 
On Twitter, if someone retweets your message, it’s amplified to people beyond 
your own following. It’s the same principle with Pinterest repins, YouTube 
thumbs-up votes, and LinkedIn or Google+ shares. Whenever people pass along 
the information they read, watch, or hear online from you, your content and 
brand gain more exposure.
One action that’s important to successfully expand your outreach is to publish 
content worth sharing and to regularly remind your followers that they can 
share the content you’ve put out there. Even more important to SME is to 
interact with your immediate audience in meaningful ways so that they’re 
more attentive, responsive, and willing to share.

Figure 1-4 shows how the stationery company TinyPrints hit the engagement 
jackpot with a post that received numerous likes, comments, and shares — 
clear signs that it was well-received and amplified by the company’s fans. 
This great content — in this case, promoting a bakery with a beautiful image 
of cupcakes — produces strong connections and a lot of sharing. This type of 
engagement activity can translate into exposure for your brand and growth of 
your fan base, including people you might not be able to easily reach directly.

The most popular social networks offer paid advertising options to reach 
highly targeted audiences. You can reach the right audience based on not only 
demographics but also their affinities, and in some cases, their connections to 
your friends, fans, or followers.
Reaping the rewards of an 
engaged community
An engaged community is attentive and responsive. That kind of attention and 
responsiveness can be leveraged for your business in many different ways:
	
✓	Customer feedback: Receive immediate input from your customers 
about their needs to better serve them or to identify business and mar­
keting opportunities.
	
✓	Market research: Ask your community to answer questions, take polls 
or surveys, and fill out questionnaires to produce on-the-fly market 
research that you can apply to your business.

✓	Brand ambassadorship: Provide exclusive perks and incentives to turn 
your brand evangelists into ambassadors for your company. A brand 
ambassador program requires a strategic plan and mutual benefit to 
work, but it starts with identifying your most engaged fans and followers 
in your social networks and paying attention to them.
	
Negativity ignored breeds more negativity. Don’t focus only on the people who 
say positive things about your brand and ignore the naysayers and critics. 
Look for opportunities to address unhappy customers and turn around their 
opinions.
A natural offshoot of SME and an engaged community is social sharing. When 
you’re interacting with your followers online and you’re publishing content 
that they in turn share with their connections, your content gets distributed 
within trusted networks.
People who receive your content from their friends are more likely to wel­
come it than if you push it out to them unsolicited. Spreading information 
by way of peers is far less commercial and can be much more intimate than 
using typical online advertising tactics.
Social engagement is not a “quick hit” or short-term folly. The best SME takes 
place over an extended period, building slowly, evolving as you go (to adapt 
to the responses from your online community and throughout), and helping 
achieve mutually beneficial goals.
Seeing How People and Organizations 
Engage with Social Media
Many people are involved in the exchanges that make up social media 
engagement. Every person goes online with different needs and different 
expectations. Knowing what motivates people as they use the Internet helps 
you better engage with them. Pinpointing your own motivations for being 
online and using SME to reach customers and prospects is also vital.
Not all roles in SME are set in stone. Both people and entities have presences 
online and in social networks and all of them contribute to the engagement 
process in different ways.

Part I: The Basics of Social Media Engagement 
Individual consumers
In today’s social web, individuals have more power than ever. Consumers 
are increasingly aware of the power they hold: A person with a blog can 
review products, build awareness of a brand, and drive sales. Someone can 
share their opinions about a brand on their favorite social networks and their 
thoughts can spread exponentially. 
New consumers expect more from you and your company, particularly if they’re 
your customer or a prospect. An individual in the mix of SME is looking for 
these qualities:
	
✓	Respect: Every person responds well to a respectful approach. A simple 
thank-you is a good place to start.
	
✓	Response: Someone who asks a question expects to receive an answer. 
	
✓	Rewards: Though everyone has a different concept of rewards or perks, 
people like to feel appreciated. 
If you’re worried that you’re at the mercy of individuals who can potentially 
make or break your company by publishing their opinions online, don’t 
panic: Understanding how people online act and react is a lesson in human 
psychology. Your own actions toward engaging others online should be 
thoughtful and positive to generate positive results. Throughout the book, we 
address all of these issues further.
Online communities
Online community is the collective, a virtual place, and the groups of people 
who fuel social media engagement. Your SME efforts cannot happen in a 
vacuum. The activities of SME happen within online communities, even com­
munities composed of only two people, such as you and someone else.
Social media platforms and tools convert an individual person into a network 
of people, interconnected as friends, fans, followers, or other types of con­
nections. Social networks link people to others whom they know personally, 
but just as often to people they don’t know. The connection between indi­
viduals in social networks may be another person or even a shared interest. 
Brought together, they form a community.
To move from broadcasting or publishing online into SME, someone else 
must be “present” to
	
✓	React: Reaction differs from network to network and can include super­
ficial responses such as liking or favoriting or clicking the thumbs-up 
icon. This requires the least amount of effort.

 Chapter 1: Explaining the Why, Who, and How of Social Media Engagement
	
✓	Interact: Interaction, which takes a little more effort than reaction, shows a 
certain degree of commitment such as repinning, retweeting, or commenting.
	
✓	Act: Action requires a higher level of effort from a fan than reaction 
or interaction. Action can mean having the confidence to share your 
content with others or providing detailed responses to your questions, 
furnishing contact and personal identifying information, or closing a 
transaction of some kind including a sale.
Without reaction, interaction, or action in response to what you “broadcast,” 
you don’t have social media engagement.
Online communities have been around as long as online tools have helped 
people congregate and communicate among themselves. Understanding the 
dynamics of online communities is critical to successful SME.
Your business
Any interaction has by definition more than one participant. In social media 
engagement, your company or organization can be one of the participants. 
“But a company isn’t a person,” you might say. True. Therefore, your chal­
lenge is to make your company — a corporate entity or the brand that repre­
sents it — more human and to understand some basic rules of engagement, 
both implicit and explicit.
To foster relationships by way of social media — even if you’re engaging via 
your business identity or brand — keep these principles in mind:
	
✓	People want to connect with people. You’re putting your company or 
organization on social networks; however, you and other company 
representatives need to be there interacting, person to person.
	
✓	Your brand needs a clear voice. Appropriate and effective communications 
online starts with basic branding guidelines to ensure that the way you 
participate in online conversations is consistent and in keeping with your 
brand personality. A clear brand voice is especially important when 
multiple people or third-party consultants or agencies are managing 
your social presences.
	
✓	You need your own rules of engagement. Every organization using SME 
needs both a set of internal guidelines and policies and external commu­
nity guidelines that spell out which content is allowed and not allowed 
in the social networks you use.
	
✓	You need a plan. For quality interactions, develop a game plan for whom 
you will engage, where you will reach them, and what you will do regularly, 
also considering what you want your followers to do. Use tools such as 
a social media calendar to schedule messaging in advance that dovetails 
with your overall goals. (See Chapter 5 for how to develop a social media 
calendar.)

Part I: The Basics of Social Media Engagement 
Publish social content that encourages social sharing. Think of the material 
you post online as the beginning of conversation, not simply content that you 
broadcast for others to passively consume.
To effectively draw the reactions, interactions, and actions that make SME 
work for you, get people talking — to you and to each other.
	
Survey your friends, fans, and followers online to understand why they connect 
with you, to determine what topics interest them, and to see what they expect 
to hear from you. Look for the intersections between what you need and what 
they need and focus on common areas for better engagement.
Your employees
Even if you’re the only person engaging via social media for your company, 
anticipate that employees or team members or assistants or even agen­
cies will, at some point, complete these tasks on your behalf. Spell out your 
ground rules for online engagement now rather than wait until you need to 
hand off the duties to someone else.
Your company’s internal guidelines for social media engagement will often 
look similar to the public guidelines you post for your online community to 
follow. That’s because the basic tenets of good community behavior work 
well regardless of the participants or environment.
This list describes some issues to address to cover the way your employees 
handle SME for your company:
	
✓	Frequency of participation: Even if you already have a posting schedule, 
you need guidelines to specify how online communities and conversations 
should be integrated into people’s day-to-day work.
	
✓	Approved content: Let your social media editorial calendar (see 
Chapter 5) be your internal guide for developing and publishing 
approved content.
	
✓	Tone of conversations: Your brand guidelines inform your messaging 
map (detailed in Chapter 5) to provide more than the visual elements 
of your logo — they also guide the personality, tone, and voice of your 
brand in social media, down to the key words and phrases to use online 
and the types of content to post, depending on who you’re targeting.
	
✓	Response style: Every social network and online communications tool 
has platform-specific ways to respond and interact. Spell out the way 
your team needs to respond, such as when to like people’s comments on 
Facebook or how to respond to a retweet on Twitter.
	
✓	Chain of command: Establish a clearly defined system to determine 
who’s in charge. If your organization has different team members, 
www.Ebook777.com

21
 Chapter 1: Explaining the Why, Who, and How of Social Media Engagement
specify who is an employee’s direct supervisor and which activities or 
actions need to be approved or considered by a manager.
	
✓	Policing process: Outline steps for removing inappropriate content or 
comments online, and spell out who has the power to delete material. 
Many social networks do not provide different levels of administrative 
access, so your rules and guidelines will dictate roles, responsibilities, 
and permissions.
To a certain degree, allow employees to use their best judgment when inter­
acting online. As long as everyone is aligned in terms of values, tone, and 
overall goals, your team should be able to respond and act as needed, espe­
cially if you — or their supervisors — aren’t available to respond promptly. 
Delays in responding can create a negative situation in social networks. 
Attentiveness and responsiveness can help avoid potential problems.
Address the likelihood that your employees use social media in their per­
sonal lives. Add to the employee handbook specific rules for content that 
your company allows and doesn’t allow for at-will employees about their 
behavior in social networks on their own time and within their own, “private” 
online networks.
We say “private” because nothing that’s posted online is truly private. Even 
the most locked-down Facebook or Twitter account or e-mail message can 
produce fodder that’s distributed across the Internet. After material is 
released from a secure computer onto the Internet, the reality is that it can 
potentially be revealed to the online world.
	
You aren’t immune to the dangers of careless online communications and 
inappropriate exchanges in social media. One mistake can snowball into an 
avalanche of trouble for your company. Watch what you say and publish 
online, and be a role model to your employees in terms of appropriate online 
behavior.
Setting Goals for Social Media 
Engagement
Social media engagement is an essential part of social media marketing — 
it’s the way you share content online in social networks and the way others 
respond to that content. SME consists of several parts, like pieces in a puzzle:
	
✓	Audience: The people you want to reach and engage
	
✓	Content: The type of information you put out there
	
✓	Reaction, interaction, and action: The ways people can respond to you
	
✓	Outcomes and measurement: The results of engagement

Part I: The Basics of Social Media Engagement 
SME is the “stuff that happens” during your social media marketing cam­
paigns, but also the way you do things to make that stuff happen. We’ve 
identified five goals of social media engagement. All these goals involve inter­
actions with people, as we discuss in the following sections.
Building trust and credibility
Online, as in life, you can build better relationships and have more positive 
outcomes in communications if the people who are communicating trust 
each other. Trust in the offline world is built over time, and trust in social 
media engagement is no different.
The need for transparency in SME is huge. More people have greater access 
to information about anyone and any company because of the Internet. 
Material that you previously could hide behind your company firewall can 
now become fodder in social networks in the blink of an eye. Even trusted 
brands risk tarnishing their reputations with missteps in how they communi­
cate and engage online as much as in how they behave offline.
Both trust and credibility are built on consistency and on follow-through, as 
we discuss in Chapter 4. Do what you say you’re going to do. If you ask for 
feedback, address head-on whatever you hear. If you “overhear” somebody 
complaining about your company publicly on a social network, be attentive 
and responsive. Sincerity and the human touch go a long way toward building 
trust and credibility and toward laying the foundation for your efforts in SME.
Being present with a human touch
Technology tools exist to automate many tasks, but still no substitute exists 
for actual human interaction. Even the best artificial intelligence software 
cannot fully replicate human sentiment, emotion, and sensitivity. Many 
aspects of social media engagement can be automated, but without the 
human element — the personality, emotions, reactions, and responses — 
engagement can fall flat or even utterly fail.
As we mention in Chapter 5, a major challenge of being present online is 
time. You may feel that you don’t have enough time to add engagement via 
social media to your lengthy to-do list. If you want to turn prospects into cus­
tomers, build strong and lasting relationships with customers, and convert 
happy customers into avid evangelists, you — and your team, employees, or 
representatives — need to personally engage regularly.
	
Use canned messaging and automated responses sparingly to supplement, not 
dominate, your presence in social networks. You cannot expect others to be 
present and to engage with you online if you aren’t there as well.

 Chapter 1: Explaining the Why, Who, and How of Social Media Engagement
Creating connections
You want more friends, fans, and followers in your social networks, but don’t 
think that amassing sheer numbers gets you closer to achieving your busi­
ness goals. Bigger numbers may look attractive on the surface, but if the 
wrong people help you accumulate them — individuals who aren’t in your 
target demographic and who aren’t interested in what you have to say — 
those “connections” are empty and meaningless.
For SME to be successful, you need to be connected with more of the right 
people — the individuals who willingly align themselves with your brand, who 
pay attention when you share content online, and who gladly pass along the 
content you’ve shared. To attract the right people, start by creating an online 
presence that reflects your brand and that is focused, attractive, interactive, 
and intrinsically valuable to the audience with whom you want to connect.
As you begin your outreach to gain friends, fans, and followers, follow the 
people whom you want to follow you. To boost your outreach, leverage the 
highly targeted advertising options on the most popular social networks to 
hone in on the right audience to build your fan base.
Social media engagement works best when you respect your connections and 
understand that their time and attention are valuable — and often stretched 
to the limits. Your connections in social media are only as strong as the effort 
you invest in obtaining and cultivating them over time. Without strong and 
attentive connections, you can’t have real or lasting engagement. For more 
on the importance of connections, see Chapter 6.
Sparking conversations
We may use the terms broadcasting or publishing or even sharing to describe 
sending information by e-mail, via the web and social networks, or by using 
mobile devices. When you’re participating in social media engagement, 
though, you’re conversing. Everything you post online should be thought of 
as the beginning of a conversation.
If you want to engage with others via SME, you have to be willing — and able — 
to be part of the conversation. Your engagement efforts begin, as always, with 
your business goals, who you’re trying to reach, and what you’re trying to get 
them to do. But then your challenge becomes converting your key messages 
into meaningful conversation starters and maintaining conversations to 
foster relationships with your connections.
	
A great way to start a conversation is by telling a story. Storytelling in SME is 
a powerful tool — you can do it by using words, images, audio, and video. Tell 
stories that are compelling enough for others to want to pass them along.

Part I: The Basics of Social Media Engagement 
Conversations are happening online all the time. Some of these conversations 
involve your brand — whether or not you’re part of them. Listen more to 
what is being said about you, and find appropriate ways to be a part of those 
conversations.
You can’t control all the conversations happening around your brand, but 
you can engage people who are talking about you outside of your networks, 
address their comments or concerns, and invite them to continue the conver­
sation in more direct ways including e-mail, website forums, social networks, 
and even by phone or in person if it makes sense.
Turn to Chapter 7 to see how to start and manage conversations in social media.
Driving interaction
The activity that goes hand in hand with sparking a conversation happens 
during the conversation and after it ends. You have business goals — we get 
that. You want people to take action, whether it’s to click on your web ad 
banner, sign up for a prize or content, contact you, or make a purchase. All 
these actions require deliberate effort — they don’t happen automatically. 
Any telephone salesperson who initiates cold calls can tell you that hang-ups 
and rejections are much more common than actual sales.
Social media engagement is both the warm-up and the marathon. Attracting 
more than a passing glance online and making a deliberate action to connect — 
to like or favorite your content — is only the first step in driving interaction. 
That one-time action of clicking the Like button doesn’t help you reach your 
goals.
Turn those quick-and-easy liking and favoriting actions into greater commit­
ments of time and trust — into comments and shares. You accomplish this task 
by executing a well-planned approach to content development and publishing, 
thoughtful outreach, consistent presence, meaningful conversation, and subtle 
and not-so-subtle encouragement. Give people a reason to continually interact 
with you. Understand what motivates your audience to interact. Social engage­
ment starts with you, but interactions aren’t only about you. (We dig into this 
topic in detail in Chapter 7.)

Media Engagement
In This Chapter

▶	Measuring social media engagement
▶	Assessing and improving engagement
W

e’re the first to admit that social media engagement can be challeng­
ing. As with any aspect of marketing, particularly newer ones that 
haven’t weathered the test of time, social media engagement has its pluses 
and its minuses. You have more opportunities than ever before to reach your 
customers in new ways and get closer to them, but you need to know about 
common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
In this chapter, we address the challenges and potential obstacles of social 
media engagement head on. We also provide an overview of how to measure 
your engagement activity with your audience, as well as how to assess how 
you’re doing. With careful examination of the results of your social media 
engagement tactics and campaigns, you will be better equipped to improve 
what you’re doing.
Considering the Downsides of Social 
Media Engagement
We don’t want to sound negative, but the truth is that social media engage­
ment (SME) isn’t always easy. From experience, we know that the greatest 
barriers to engagement can be the concerns and doubts that crop up when 
you’re exploring options. You can easily become caught up in the hype 
and the naysaying of SME and begin questioning whether you even need to 
engage with followers.

Part I: The Basics of Social Media Engagement 
People commonly question the worthiness of any new concept. Whether it’s 
a new technology or a new strategy that changes the norm, change can be 
difficult to accept. A common reaction to having to change is resistance or 
outright rejection. 
To nip negativity in the bud, tackle it head-on. Information is the best weapon 
to counteract naysayers, whether it’s a boss, a manager, a client, a colleague, 
or yourself. Arm yourself with the information you need in order to make 
sound decisions about incorporating SME into the marketing mix.
Managing the “time suck”
Social media engagement takes time, there’s no doubt about it. We wouldn’t 
be honest with you if we didn’t admit that fact. There’s a difference between 
making time and wasting time. To prevent the latter, add these components 
to your SME strategy and process:
	
✓	Goals: With SME, everything should start and end with your goals, and 
in your case, your business goals. SME can support many aspects of your 
business, but if you don’t keep your goals in mind, you risk wasting time.
	
✓	A plan: Social media engagement requires strategic thinking, and it 
benefits from a written plan that outlines how to implement engagement 
strategies and tactics.
	
✓	Guidelines: Follow best practices for SME, and craft guidelines tailored 
to your business. The guidelines should specify how frequently to pub­
lish content to your social networks, how much of it to automate, and 
how often to go online to check in directly with your community. See 
Chapter 4 for more details on developing SME guidelines.
	
✓	Systems: Your plan should include the systems you’ll implement to stream­
line messaging and engagement across all your social networks. A system 
might include the way you link networks — for example, whether you 
post Facebook updates automatically to Twitter.
	
✓	Tools: Implementing a system often requires the appropriate tools, 
such as a social media management (SMM) platform like HootSuite or 
Sprout Social to gather social networks under a single communications 
umbrella for efficiency and control.
	
Distraction is the enemy of social media engagement because it can lead you 
to wasting time and forgetting your business goals — the underlying reasons 
why you are engaging online in the first place. You can easily become dis­
tracted by all the messages, links, and information that appear in front of you. 
Stick to your plan, guidelines, and goals. Be disciplined about spending time in 
social networks.

 Chapter 2: Assessing the Impact of Social Media Engagement
Overcoming the barriers to entry
“It’s too hard.” We hear many people say that SME is just too difficult or too 
overwhelming to bother trying it out. We’re convinced that their hesitation 
stems from the common tendency to fear the unknown or to bite off more 
social networks than they can chew. 
Consume SME in bite-size pieces, and take the time to “chew on” information 
thoughtfully. Then digest it before you take the next bite. Don’t rush into all 
aspects of SME all at one time.
You don’t have to be everywhere all the time. And don’t feel compelled to set 
up a presence on a new social network before you’ve truly mastered the one 
(or ones) that you’re already using.
In the following list, we highlight common barriers and then suggest sensible 
ways to overcome them:
	
✓	“I don’t want to listen to people talk about their lunch.” The common 
misconception about social media engagement is that it consists of 
people posting online what they had for lunch (or something equally 
mundane). We’ll be honest with you — some people do post about what 
they’re eating. The majority of topics discussed in social networks, 
however, run the gamut from politics to products to personal moments 
in people’s lives. Publish useful content and connect with others online 
who do the same and your SME experience will be more valuable.
	
✓	“I don’t have a social media presence.” Although we assume that you 
already have at least one social networking account, if you don’t have one 
yet, we recommend setting up a Facebook Page as the first platform for 
your SME because of the variety of ways you can post and the potential 
for exponential reach via friends and friends of friends. Don’t invite 
anyone to your page at first, to give yourself time to familiarize yourself 
with its features and to post some initial content. (See Chapter 9 for 
specific information on preparing for Facebook engagement.)
	
✓	“I don’t have time.” Oh, that elusive 25th hour in the day we always 
think we need for SME. Social media engagement is about communica­
tions, a critical part of marketing and other aspects of doing business. 
Carve out time to engage in your social networks in the same way you 
carve out time for (or find help with) handling phone calls, responding 
to e-mail, or implementing other marketing tactics that require your 
attention and presence.
	
✓	“I’m afraid of backlash.” Publishing online for the whole world to see 
inevitably invites occasional negative responses from individuals ranging 
from people who have simply “woken up on the wrong side of the bed” 
to folks with legitimate gripes. Look at these responses as opportunities

Part I: The Basics of Social Media Engagement 
to “right wrongs” and win people over. See the later section “Dealing 
with potential backlash” for more tips.
	
✓	“I have no images.” Images aren’t mandatory components of SME, but 
they are attention-grabbing, shareable pieces of content. We’d be remiss 
to let you believe that images aren’t vital to engagement. If you sell 
products, chances are good that you have images, but you may offer ser­
vices or produce written or audio content. Though a lack of images isn’t 
a deal-breaker for engagement, you should identify or create relevant 
images that visually illustrate who you are, what you do, and what you 
want to express. Use a smartphone to take photos that convey a sense 
of place “in the moment” and showcase your brand personality and 
company culture. Consumers want to see people behind the brands.
	
When your own supply of images begins to thin, use stock photography to 
share with your online community. Stock photos don’t have to be stiff, fake, 
or cheesy. Check resources such as stock.xchng (www.sxc.hu), iStockphoto 
(www.istockphoto.com), and Flickr Creative Commons (flickr.com/
creativecommons) to find appropriate images that you can adapt to your 
needs. Figure 2-1 shows examples of stock photos that work — you can modify 
these royalty-free images to use as visual elements in your social networks.

images from

Surviving information overload
Social media engagement requires a lot of reading, analyzing, and report­
ing. On its own, the act of engaging exposes you to a tremendous amount of 
information that can be overwhelming to digest. We have a few tricks up our 
sleeves to help you reduce the potential overload and to handle the fire hose 
of content and conversations coming your way.

 Chapter 2: Assessing the Impact of Social Media Engagement
Develop the habit of using a consistent process of engagement. These steps 
outline one process we’ve tested (with time estimates) that works well if 
you’re struggling to handle too much information:
	
1.	Log in to your social network or social media management tool.
	
2.	Peruse your news feeds and messaging streams to see what topics 
other people are discussing and to gauge the mood of your audience.
	
	 Average time: 5 minutes. Set a timer, if necessary.
	
3.	Retweet, share, favorite, or otherwise engage with others as appropriate.
	
	 Average time: 5 minutes.
	
4.	Look for public mentions of your brand or direct questions or 
requests. Respond or forward messages to the appropriate team mem­
bers or to an assistant to help respond.
	
	 Average time: 5 to 10 minutes.
	
5.	Look for direct or private messages that aren’t forwarded to your 
e-mail account, and respond or forward messages to the appropriate 
team members or to an assistant to help respond.
	
	 Average time: 5 to 10 minutes.
	
6.	Log out, and get back to work.
Succeeding when SME is restricted
Every barrier to social media engagement 
can be overcome or circumvented by focus­
ing on strategic thinking and clear goals. Aliza 
had a client who, because of potential legal 
concerns, dictated restrictive guidelines for 
engaging on Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest. 
The client provided a narrow list of approved 
types of Twitter users to follow and restricted 
on Pinterest the repinning of images owned 
by other people. All photographs uploaded 
to Pinterest were required to have copyright 
notices on the images themselves. On Twitter, 
messaging had to be related to specific topics, 
events, and news, and retweets were allowed 
only when the source was verifiable and on an 
approved topic.
Aliza followed these initial steps to overcome 
the client’s reservations about SME:
	 1.	 Carefully outlined exactly which tactics and 
messaging were — and weren’t — allowed.
	 2.	 To build trust, she and her team followed all 
instructions to the letter.
	 3.	 Identified restrictions that could be lifted or 
at least loosened over time.
Despite initial limitations, the client has been 
able to leverage Facebook, Twitter, and 
Pinterest to create content-rich resources and 
build meaningful connections with its commu­
nity. They have since expanded their activities 
as they’ve received many positive responses 
from members of their online community.

Part I: The Basics of Social Media Engagement 
That’s 20 to 30 minutes per session — tops. Repeat these steps two to three 
times a day. You can get a lot accomplished with SME in about an hour a day.
At times, you may have reasons to deviate from a process. The more active 
your social networks become and the more your community members inter­
act with you, the more time and attention you should devote to build and 
maintain momentum.
After you’re spending more than an hour every time you monitor and manage 
your social networks and engage with your audience, look for additional 
ways to streamline, or turn to others for help. Follow these additional tips for 
managing information overload:
	
✓	Filter the conversations. Look for features within the social networks 
or tools you use to filter conversations so that you see the information 
that’s most important to your business. Use dashboard tools such as 
HootSuite (www.hootsuite.com), MarketMeSuite (www.marketme
suite.com), and SproutSocial (www.sproutsocial.com) to create 
columns or tabs of specific content streams, searches by hashtags, and 
other filtered criteria to home in on key conversations. Figure 2-2 shows

✓	Stay on top of it. After you gain momentum from your engagement 
efforts, maintain consistency and stay on top of the messages and inter­
actions. Develop a plan for covering your channels when you’re away so 
that you don’t return to the fallout from a failure to respond or to a glut 
of messages needing attention.
	
✓	Hire help. The larger the online community, the less likely one person 
can spend an hour a day handling the interactions. Spending signifi­
cantly more time than that can stand in the way of running your busi­
ness. Consider hiring an intern or a virtual assistant to help you with 
SME, even if she covers only weekends and evenings or simply directs 
queries to the appropriate team member.

 Chapter 2: Assessing the Impact of Social Media Engagement
	
Replace genuine interactions with genuine replies, not timed or canned mes­
saging. Though scheduling precrafted messages can be useful to lessen the 
burden of participating in your social media channels, you (or someone 
you’ve hired and trained) also need to pay attention and respond personally 
as frequently as possible.
In the end, spending all your time in social networks is unrealistic. When 
online community members point out your absence or delayed responses, 
simply admit that you’re human and that you’re doing the best you can. Thank 
people for their input and concerns. Then catch up as much as possible, 
continue to engage well, and identify areas where you can improve.
Dealing with potential backlash
Social media engagement involves humans. You’re human. Your team is human. 
All the people behind the avatars on all the social networks are human. Human 
beings are complex, emotional beings who can be sensitive and who may not 
excel at online communications. At some point, you and your company may 
experience negative, or even hostile, behavior from someone online.
Follow these steps to prepare for potential backlash and then handle it 
effectively:
	
1.	Pay attention.
	
	 Hone your “digital listening” skills by carefully monitoring your social 
channels and the web at large to hear the positive comments about you 
and your company — and the negative ones. 
	
2.	Assess thoughtfully.
	
	 Avoid the urge to panic and respond in a knee-jerk fashion. Instead, 
evaluate a person’s true meaning or motivation versus a person’s words. 
Misinterpreting a snarky comment as criticism, for example, can turn a 
non-issue into a crisis.
	
3.	Address negativity quickly.
	
	 Every minute counts when you’re faced with a negative comment in 
a social network. You may have many responsibilities to tend to, but 
someone who takes the time to complain about you or your company 
is often waiting for a response. Have a plan in place for crisis commu­
nications so that you know the options for responding. Use a rational, 
respectful tone in your response. Even an awkward response buys you 
time to further assess and address the situation.
	
4.	Acknowledge the person’s feelings and perceptions.

Part I: The Basics of Social Media Engagement 
	
	 After you review the situation and you’re ready to address the comment, 
understand that strong emotions may have prompted it. Use professional 
communications skills, and start your response with a statement to 
defuse those emotions, such as “I hear your frustration” or “We realize 
that the situation is challenging.” Don’t invalidate the person’s comments 
defensively — even someone who is incorrect deserves to be heard.
	
5.	Don’t complicate.
	
	 Here’s the difference between a well-handled social media engagement 
situation and a full-blown crisis: The former involves preparedness and 
sensitivity; the latter, defensiveness and overthinking. Don’t run every­
thing past hierarchies and committees in order to put a response on 
record.
	
6.	Be human.
	
	 Don’t reply unemotionally. Be frank with the other person and all mem­
bers of your online community who may be watching. People want to 
see a human response to a crisis, not an overproduced, formulaic, or 
canned reply. You may have to ask a lawyer or the legal department 
about admitting fault. But you can at least apologize that something has 
upset the other person.
	
7.	Take it offline.
	
	 Don’t carry out any crisis control entirely in public. Ask to contact an 
unhappy individual privately and work to resolve the issue one-to-one.
	
8.	 Be transparent.
	
	 The flip side of going private is not to conduct communications so 
secretly that people perceive a cover-up. Strike a balance between 
public and private engagement when the discussion gets heated.
	
9.	Fix the problem.
	
	 If someone attempts to bring a problem to your attention publicly, and 
it’s truly one that you can solve, admit it, address it, and fix it. If you 
can’t solve it, express empathy with the emotion being expressed. If 
nothing is truly wrong but someone perceives that it is, don’t dismiss 
those concerns. Take every exchange seriously, and do your best to 
resolve what you can or provide a resolution or consolation.
	
10.	Tell your story.
	
	 Telling your own story throughout the “fixing” process can help defuse 
an issue. Providing updates such as “We’re looking into that issue” and 
“We’ve taken care of that situation” lets anyone paying attention see that 
you’re attentive and responsive and taking care of the matter even when 
you’re behind the scene.

Avoiding inconsistent messaging
Marketers know that it takes at least five impressions before a sale is closed. 
In cold calling, this rule translates to five calls or meetings. In online marketing, 
this doesn’t necessarily mean five views of a banner ad. Seeing a company’s 
logo on a banner ad could be one of five impressions that etches a company’s 
Avoiding a viral video crisis
A classic example of the challenges of SME 
crisis control is what happened to the Alaska 
State Fair in 2010. During the fair, an individual 
carried a political protest sign on fair property. 
A video, produced by mobile phone, of the 
protestor being tackled and removed from fair 
property, was shown on YouTube. The fair’s 
online community erupted over what appeared 
to be an excessive use of force and a violation 
of free speech.
Using respectful, evenhanded tones to respond 
immediately on the fair’s Facebook Page, the 
fair’s social media team explained that fair 
officials were investigating seriously and con­
sulting law enforcement to determine what 
happened. This quick response pacified the 
fair’s online community while, behind the 
scenes, the fair consulted all parties involved — 
law enforcement officers, members of the 
media, and the fair’s public relations rep and 
social media agency, carefully revealing only 
confirmed facts to the public as they gathered 
details.
As the video reached more people worldwide, 
fewer of the angry posters on the Facebook 
Page were even familiar with the details of the 
event. Some individuals began creating new 
problems, posting angry, inappropriate com­
ments. The fair banned only a small number of 
Facebook fans and only those who resorted to 
foul language or violent threats, both of which 
were clearly outlined in their existing online 
community guidelines as violations of commu­
nity rules.
In time, the fair was able to communicate that 
the protestor was rightfully removed from the 
property because posted rules around the fair­
grounds stated that picketing wasn’t allowed. 
Neither did the video show the moments pre­
ceding the incident, where the protestor antag­
onized nearby families who had small children. 
Fair officials emphasized that the safety of 
families, children, and other fairgoers was of 
the utmost importance to them.
In a written statement published online, fair 
officials revealed that the person who was 
“protesting” had a history of encounters with 
law enforcement and was carrying a concealed 
weapon, though it wasn’t easily visible in the 
video. By hearing the facts as they unfolded, 
most of the fair’s online community members 
were satisfied that their concerns had been 
addressed. In the end, many fans of the fair 
praised the organization publicly on Facebook 
for handling the situation promptly and trans­
parently.
Remember: Negative posts and feedback online 
are opportunities to address an issue, solve a 
problem, convert an unhappy customer into a 
happy one, and conclude a situation in a posi­
tive light.

name into a consumer’s mind so they reach for that company’s product 
at the grocery store aisle. Another impression might be a reference from a 
friend in a social network while another might be a promoted post or tweet. 
Marketing messages need to be consistent from platform to platform.
Being consistent in your SME efforts is critical to building and maintaining 
your online reputation and the trust that develops from thoughtful interac­
tion in your social media channels. When you aren’t solely responsible for 
monitoring or managing your channels, you should ensure that the tone and 
messaging always align with your brand image and personality.
The more people involved in monitoring, messaging, and posting, the more 
chance for missteps unless you can keep everyone on the same page. This 
list describes elements to compose or set up and share with your team:
	
✓	Brand documents: Describe your brand personality, messaging tone, 
and other details that dictate how your brand is presented in social 
media channels.
	
✓	Social media engagement guidelines and policies: Spell out the do’s and 
don’ts of posting and responding online for all members of your team.
	
✓	A written Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document: Strategically 
answer common questions and situations that are raised in your social 
media channels and compiled with the help of your team.
	
✓	Terms of service or rules of behavior: Document these guidelines for 
your team, and post them publicly for your community members as 
well. Figure 2-3 shows community guidelines posted to a Facebook Page. 
You can post guidelines using a Facebook app maker, such as Woobox 
or Shortstack, or using Facebook Notes.
	
✓	Community policies: Add a privacy policy and security policy, and post 
them publicly.
	
✓	A team-oriented, social media management tool: Look for one that 
allows teams to work together to manage social channels, to assign tasks 
to team members, and to record outcomes, such as (on the high end) 
Radian6 (www.radian6.com) or (the more moderately priced) Sprout 
Social (www.sproutsocial.com), HootSuite, (www.hootsuite.com), 
or many others.
	
When you manage a community online in your social networks, clearly outline 
how you protect community members’ information that’s submitted via forms, 
surveys, registration, shopping cart checkouts, and other communications 
methods. Search for sample privacy and security policies at your favorite 
online search engine. Check with a lawyer or the legal department before post­
ing on your website and social channels.

Measuring the Value of Your 
Social Media Engagement
Consider what matters when measuring SME. We like to say, “It’s not quan­
tity, but quality, that matters in social media engagement.” Aliza is also fond 
of saying, “I’d rather have 100 friends, fans, or followers who care than 1,000 
who ignore me.” Look at everything you do online as a way to build bonds 
for the long term: Keep an eye on how the relationships start between you or 
your company and your customers and prospects as well as members of the 
public at large. When you share content, providing true value helps build a 
strong foundation for ongoing attention and interactions.
Determining what interactions 
are valuable
In advertising, costs and measurements are clear-cut, such as paying for an 
impression (Cost Per Thousand or CPM — the “M” actually stands for the 
French word for “thousand,” million) whenever an ad is viewed; paying for a 
click (Cost Per Click or CPC) whenever a viewer clicks on the ad; and paying 
for an action or a lead (Cost Per Action or CPA). Social media engagement 
requires metrics that are different from online advertising, because the 
mechanics of engagement involve a variety of activities and responses.

Part I: The Basics of Social Media Engagement 
With more interactions happening as you engage via social media channels, 
you have many more numbers to track and even more ways to interpret them. 
How do you determine which numbers are the most important to you and your 
company? Go back to your business goals, what you’re trying to achieve, and 
what you hope the target audience does in response to your actions. Then 
match up the numbers that reflect how people are responding to you and the 
actions they are taking with your goals. If you’re seeing activity in your social 
networks that you can tie directly to supporting your business goals, you’re on 
the right track. If not, re-evaluate what you’re doing. Also consider whether the 
goals you’re focusing on are best supported through SME.
Though the ultimate goal of a business is usually to make a sale or a transac­
tion, SME offers layers of value leading up to, and surrounding, an actual sale. 
All these seemingly ancillary aspects of engagement in your online channels 
help to build brand awareness, strengthen customer loyalty, and facilitate 
brand evangelism.
The benefits of SME may seem difficult to measure or even appear to be intan­
gible, but they eventually lay the groundwork for selling in more personal and 
lasting ways than advertising ever will. To reach the mobile consumer who’s 
now connected and engaged in social networking, look at the whole picture of 
how they communicate and how you can reach, and engage with, them.
	
Social media engagement is not a silver bullet to achieve every marketing 
objective or solve every communications challenge. Just because you’re 
reaching out to an online audience doesn’t mean that they’ll respond consis­
tently. Take the time to cultivate relationships and make genuine connections 
to see more tangible results.
Knowing which numbers to measure
The metrics you use to quantify your social media engagement vary from ser­
vice to service. However, this list describes some similar types of activities 
that take place across all of them:
	
✓	Attraction: Attracting a qualified, quality following is valuable. You can 
spend money to push messages to people via ads, but true engagement 
slowly and steadily builds the audience and connects with them over the 
long term. Measure the growth of your fan base by counting common 
metrics such as the number of friends, fans, and followers and by noting 
actual customers (or even likely prospects) if you can identify them.
	
✓	Interactions: You must become part of the conversation online to convert 
participation by your friends, fans, and followers into interaction. Seek 
out opportunities to reciprocate participation by liking, commenting on, 
and sharing comments and by praising others. Pay attention to mentions, 
requests, and queries, and respond promptly. Keep track of these interac­
tions, particularly the ones that move from social networks to other forms 
of communication such as e-mail — or even in-person encounters.

 Chapter 2: Assessing the Impact of Social Media Engagement
	
✓	Actions: Actions are concrete and measurable when marketing online, 
even in SME, but they require consistent nurturing to take place more 
than once. Count and track comments and shares as well as likes, 
retweets, repins, and favorites, and note increases or declines in those 
activities. Look for potential reasons for the ebbs and flows of these 
actions, and modify your engagement tactics to account for variables 
such as time zone differences and changes to social network features.
	
✓	Transformations: The magic of SME happens when your activities trans­
form others, such as turning a dissatisfied customer into a happy one or 
turning a happy customer into an evangelist for your brand. When these 
positive transformations happen, the ripple effect of the good news 
reverberates through your own networks into your customers’ networks 
and beyond. Record the transformations you witness or cause — and 
archive everything for your records.
	
✓	Transactions: As a marketer, your job is to help close the sale. Customers 
and prospects can carry out many types of transactions in addition to 
actual sales. Don’t discount activities such as taking polls, filling out 
surveys, listing contact information (and contact permission), and 
providing warm leads. Record all types of transactions that are closed 
throughout each week and month, and watch for trends. Look out for how 
different SME tactics translate into true transactions, including sales.
	
Use a tool such as Storify (www.storify.com) to track mentions of your 
brand in popular social networks, and arrange them chronologically or in an 
order that tells a story, as shown in Figure 2-4. The resulting visual compila­
tion of tweets and posts is perfect to create reports and to help demonstrate 
the impact of your SME efforts. Storify lets you compile an organized archive 
of social media messages from other contributors that are tied together based 
on a keyword or hashtag.

Setting benchmarks to evaluate progress
As with any measurement process, start with current numbers as benchmarks 
to establish a baseline or a starting point for analyzing growth in your SME 
activities. Record not only your numbers in any social networks and other 
social media tools you’re using but also more traditional measurements, 
including the tools described in this list:
	
✓	Traffic to your website: When you use the proper messaging, SME can 
drive traffic to your site.
	
	Benchmark: The number of visitors to your site
	
✓	Referrers to your website: One common measurement in web traffic 
analysis is the number of referrers, or sites that refer traffic to your 
website. Note whether you see an increase in traffic from Facebook or 
Twitter or another social media tool you use.
	
	Benchmark: The level of traffic that social networks drive to your site
	
✓	Marketing e-mail subscribers: If you’re using e-mail marketing to reach 
customers or you’re sending a regular e-newsletter, note the current 
number of subscribers and then the changes based on integrating e-mail 
marketing into your social media messaging and networks.
	
	Benchmark: The number of subscribers and even the number of times 
that your e-mail messages have been opened and shared
	
✓	Customer service inquiries: Note how many calls or e-mails you’re 
receiving, and then begin tracking how they’re handled in social net­
works. You may even receive fewer calls and e-mails, so be prepared for 
the shift to the customer relations aspect of SME.
	
	Benchmark: The number of customer service contacts and where they’re 
taking place
	
✓	Transactions: Whether a transaction involves people signing up for demos 
or consultations or actually purchasing products, the numbers should 
change because of SME. If not, reexamine how you’re encouraging 
people to transact.
	
	Benchmark: Current sales or other transactions
If you don’t set benchmarks that reflect how you’re meeting business goals, 
you cannot accurately measure the impact of your SME activities.
	
If you’re using a management-and-measurement tool, pay for a professional-
level subscription that lets you run reports and save them. Run reports at 
least monthly to track your progress, and then archive them. Check the num­
bers weekly if your networks experience a lot of activity or you’re altering 
your engagement tactics. Record your numbers daily, such as an increasing 
number of fans and followers. Figure 2-5 shows a sample reporting feature in 
HootSuite that helps you visually quantify the effectiveness of your SME efforts.

Reassessing to improve engagement
Social media engagement isn’t an exact science. As you measure your engage­
ment efforts, consider all the variables of being human and interacting with 
other humans. The core aspects of social media engagement involve human 
beings, and many variables can affect the interactions between people online, 
such as
	
✓	The time of day: You’ll reach different people in different parts of the 
country or world depending on the time of day you post.
	
✓	The time zone: If you are trying to reach your community “in the morning,” 
this could mean posting during your afternoon to reach someone in an 
earlier time zone.
	
✓	The day of the week: Every social network reports that their members 
use their service more frequently on specific days and usage patterns 
vary from network to network.
	
✓	A person’s mood: Not every message you post will be interesting to 
someone, and there are factors in an individual’s day that can make 
them more or less receptive to your message.
	
✓	A person’s attention span: Any of your posts might be too long or too 
complicated for some people.
	
✓	The level of information overload: If someone is overwhelmed by their 
social network news feeds, they may tune out your message.
You will eventually, and inevitably, see the ebb and flow of your engagement 
reflected in your SME statistics. Though you may be tempted to panic when­
ever you reach the end of a day with low engagement, be wise and look at 
data over the longer term, not simply during a single day or even a week.

Part I: The Basics of Social Media Engagement 
Look for trends in the engagement numbers, and read online reports about 
engagement trends on each social network and platform you use to interact 
with the audience. Don’t hold too strictly to the trends you read about — not 
all trend reports provide consistent figures. Use trends as food for thought, 
and then test the ones that seem relevant to you and your audience.
An example of inconsistent trend reporting is demonstrated by the difference 
between URL shortener bit.ly (bitly.com) stating that you should post to 
Facebook between 1 and 4 p.m. eastern time and especially Wednesdays at 3 
p.m. eastern time on Facebook but Buddy Media, on the other hand, stating 
that Wednesday is the worst day to post and that weekends are better. Who’s 
right? You have to read the entire reports to understand their methodolo­
gies. The more important answer is that the ideal posting time depends on 
your company and your audience.
Pay attention to your own brand’s SME trends to see how your particular 
audience reacts to your posts in social media. Map out optimal posting times, 
but remain flexible and ready to shift based on the response of your audience 
over time. Danielle has found mornings between 8 and 11 eastern time to be 
the time when people are most responsive to her online, but it’s more than 
the time of day that matters — it’s also the day of the week. Mondays are 
more active for her than Saturdays. Aliza discovered inadvertently that her 
random tweets after work hours draw an attentive and responsive audience 
as do later-night tweets around 10 p.m. eastern time. Exploring this trend 
further, she found that many of her followers who respond at those times are 
from Australia and New Zealand.
What works this month may not work well next month, because of variables 
that may be beyond your control. Even a slight tweak by Facebook to the dis­
play of your Facebook Page updates in other people’s news feeds can throw 
off your previous communications rhythm.
Because of all the shifts and changes in the tools you use for SME, you must 
measure consistently and over long stretches to get the information you need 
to continually improve how you engage online. Above all, be consistent but 
flexible to adapt to the constantly changing online landscape.
	
Don’t stress over the numbers as you watch them increase and decrease. These 
changes are commonplace. Don’t let declines bring you down. As in the stock 
market, your SME numbers will continually increase as long as you use the tools 
properly and can account for both losses and gains.

 Chapter 2: Assessing the Impact of Social Media Engagement
Leveraging success
We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again: Social media engagement starts 
with knowing your business goals, your audience, and the workings of 
the social networks you use. Knowing which SME strategies work for your 
company — and inspire the greatest number of reactions, interactions, and 
actions — helps you build on your successes.
Pay attention to the types of posts and messaging that work best for your 
audience. Then do more of what works and less of what doesn’t. It sounds 
simple, doesn’t it? It takes practice, but we know it’s possible. You can do it!
If you’re using several social networks for online marketing and engagement, 
you might be tempted to put all your eggs into the network basket that 
returns the best results. Though there’s wisdom in using the most powerful 
network most often, don’t ignore other networks outright. Look to leverage 
the best network by using these additional methods:
	
✓	Integrating: Merge your other social networks to post into the most 
successful one.
	
✓	Linking: Connect to your other social networks in posts on the most 
successful one.
	
✓	Converting: Implement an advertising budget on your best network.
Promote all your social networks on the most successful one, and enhance 
the best one by using the others. For example, if Facebook is your main social 
network, you can still use Instagram and set it up to post photos to your 
Facebook Page to add visual interest. Connecting social networks so that 
they feed into one another in an orchestrated way can make them all more 
effective.
Success with SME relies on not only your own actions but also the actions of 
others. Pay attention to the participants in your online community because 
their activities fuel the conversations and the amplification of your messaging. 
Pay attention to what works well for them, and do more of it.
	
People like to be appreciated and recognized. Offer online community perks, 
discounts, or other benefits for engaging with you and to show appreciation 
of their attention and interactions. Don’t attempt to bribe your community — 
buying loyalty is a short-term fix to inattentiveness or apathy. Instead, express 
genuine concern about community members and recognize their contributions.

hrowing out the old tools you’ve been using and jumping onto the band­
wagon to use a new and exciting communications and marketing technology 
can be tempting. You may feel like you have the capacity for only so many 
tools, so eliminating the old seems like a way to make room for the new.
This chapter lays the groundwork for our assertion that not all of the older 
communications tools you are using are broken. Even though it is common­
place to consider social networks as the main tools for social media engagement, 
understand that many of the tools you’ve been using online are part of the 
overall landscape of SME.
Considering Traditional Online 
Communications Tools
Before social networks existed, people communicated online in different 
ways. Electronic mail (e-mail) was used for sending direct messages to one 
person or to many people. Messages that could be read by groups of people 
morphed into forums, known as Usenet newsgroups, and eventually became 
the current form of online web-based forums. 
Throughout these fast technological changes, the way people communicate 
has changed in major ways. Social networks and other multimedia and social

Part I: The Basics of Social Media Engagement 
media tools and platforms are incredibly popular, but the use of traditional 
online communications tools still has a lot of value. E-mail, online forums, 
and websites can — and should — all be incorporated into your strategy for 
social media engagement (SME).
SME doesn’t take place on social networks solely on the web. Social engage­
ment aspects in a myriad of online and even mobile apps, tools, and networks 
should work in concert to help you connect and interact with the target market.
E-mail
You probably use either e-mail software on your computer, such as Microsoft 
Outlook, or web-based e-mail applications, such as Yahoo! Mail, Hotmail, 
or Gmail. For business communications, you might use a service, such as 
Google Apps, that includes e-mail.
Though e-mail doesn’t seem flashy or modern, it’s still the most important 
engagement tool now in use, and it can tie in with social networks more 
easily than ever. Figure 3-1 shows an example of an e-mail message with 
social media links or graphics in the signature file, which were embedded 
using the WiseStamp app (www.wisestamp.com).
	
Figure 3-1: 
Use social 
media links 
or graphics 
in an e-mail 
signature.
	
Far more people have e-mail accounts and use e-mail daily to communicate 
than use social networks. By some counts, more than 3.1 billion people 
have e-mail accounts (The Radicati Group, Inc., 2011; www.radicati.com). 
Compare that number to the largest social network, Facebook, and its bil­
lion or so users. Social networks are catching up to e-mail but, so far, haven’t 
eliminated the need for more direct correspondence that’s separate and 
apart from social networks.
If SME consists of reactions, interactions, and actions, e-mail clearly fits the 
bill. When you send out an e-mail, you and others can react, respond, inter­
act, and take actions such as these:

✓	Click a link to begin an online purchase.
E-mail is more than a message carrier: It’s a conversation starter as well as a 
multimedia and multifeatured communications tool to engage others beyond 
simple back-and-forth communications.
Even as you set up your social networking presences, don’t discount e-mail 
marketing. Any marketer can tell you that a database of fully vetted e-mail 
addresses is a valuable marketing asset. Many online marketing professionals 
report that e-mail is still the most effective way to connect and engage with 
others because of the contained nature of e-mail messages in an inbox and 
people’s habitual use of e-mail.
	
Do not force people to opt out of (or have to take a specific action to remove 
themselves from) your e-mails because you’ve subscribed them without their 
knowledge or permission, which can lead to negative feelings about your 
brand. The well-established e-mail marketing best practice of allowing people 
to opt in by giving express permission is still alive and well.
E-mail marketing tools of the past were intended to broadcast (in one direc­
tion only) messages to many recipients. E-mail marketing platforms now inte­
grate social media features to let recipients easily connect with you on social 
networks and not simply read your e-mail, delete it, and then forget about 
you. E-mail marketing tools also let you announce when you’ve sent a market­
ing e-mail or an electronic newsletter by autopublishing an update to your 
friends, fans, and followers on social networks.
You may already have an e-mail sign-up form on your website or blog. Add 
ways for people to provide you with their e-mail addresses in your social net­
works. For example, integrate an e-mail sign-up app into your Facebook Page 
using any of the popular e-mail marketing tools, such as Constant Contact 
(www.constantcontact.com) or MailChimp (www.mailchimp.com). 
Figure 3-2 shows you how MailChimp does it.

Online forums (groups)
When you have people gathering online to discuss common topics, you have 
the seeds for building online community. Where you have online community, 
you have the potential for actions, reactions, and interactions. None of these 
activities is exclusively an aspect of SME, but they’re common to all online com­
munities where people gather, including web-based online forums or groups.
Though people still congregate and interact within web-based forums, they 
now have these community-building options that are powered by social media:
	
✓	Facebook Groups, shown in Figure 3-3: Focus on discussions among 
members (despite their similar appearance to Facebook Pages and 
Timelines) and can feature members at the top of the page.
	
✓	LinkedIn Groups, shown in Figure 3-4: Facilitate information exchange, 
and networking among LinkedIn members — usually, professionals.
	
✓	Google+ Communities, shown in Figure 3-5: Build your audience on G+ 
through their Communities feature similar to LinkedIn Groups.
Most social networks provide you with the tools to create more contained, 
or even private, members-only forums for ongoing discussions. Facebook 
Groups offers two privacy levels: Private (others can see your group listing 
but you must approve requests to join) and Secret (your group isn’t listed 
publicly so you must invite others). LinkedIn has a single private level; you 
approve requests to join. In early 2013, Google+ introduced Communities that 
offer a privacy level for member approval. See Chapter 13 for more informa­
tion on Google+ Communities. Twitter lets you make your Twitter account 
private but does not offer a group feature.

Whether public or private, online forums and groups work well when several 
factors are present:
	
✓	A focused topic area or theme: Conversations in the best forums remain 
on topic.
	
✓	Like-minded or interested people: People join groups voluntarily based 
on their interests and needs.
	
✓	Strong community leadership: A good moderator keeps the discussion 
going with a light touch so that everyone feels welcome to the conversation.
	
✓	Clear community rules: Every group needs publicly posted guidelines 
that define proper behavior and spell out bad behavior.
	
✓	Fair policing: Many online communities police themselves, admonishing 
or removing individuals who post inappropriately, and others let mod­
erators ban people.
	
See Online Community Management For Dummies by Deborah Ng (John Wiley 
& Sons, Inc.) to get the nitty-gritty on managing an online community, whether 
it’s based within a social network or not.
A benefit of setting up a group in a social network such as Facebook or 
LinkedIn is that you can build an online space for people to gather that feels 
like a cohesive community. Building a community on a Facebook Page, for 
example, is challenging because of the way Facebook limits people from 
seeing your messages and from seeing other people’s posts on your Page. 
The limitations of Facebook Pages hinder group-wide discussions. On a Page, 
most community conversations take place in a disjointed manner within the 
comments of various Page updates.
People tend to Like a Facebook Page to show their affinity for a brand, though 
they may also want to interact. They join a Facebook Group specifically for the 
interaction among members. People connect with you on LinkedIn to add you 
to their contacts and likely don’t interact with you regularly. They join your 
LinkedIn Group to engage in dialogue — with you and with other members of 
the group. People are more likely to look forward to the conversations and 
respond in more depth when they join groups with the intention of participation.
Websites and blogs
You may not think of websites in relation to online community and social 
media engagement, because websites are often considered static destina­
tions and repositories of information rather than engagement tools.
Engagement isn’t only a means of attracting someone’s interest and attention, 
though a website can be attractive and attracting. To make a website more 
interactive, you have to add features to it beyond static HTML pages in order 
to turn a site visitor or reader into an active community member or customer.

 Chapter 3: Discovering Social Media Engagement Tools
To understand what drives people to interact and to know how the tools you 
have at your disposal provide for engagement, you should understand a little 
of the history of the tools we now use for SME. In the early days of the web, 
“interacting” on a website was limited to clicking an e-mail link.
Then came the guest book, a web-based submission form that posted a mes­
sage publicly on a web page under the guise of signing a guest book for the 
website owner. In some cases, people realized that others were signing the 
same website’s guest book at nearly the same time.
Even in those primitive days, people wanted to make contact and communicate 
with one another, so they began talking to each other by leaving comments 
to each other on web-based guest books and refreshing the pages until they 
saw responses.
Early on, people could share an article from a website with a friend via e-mail. 
Soon they could leave comments on articles. Then came blogs, and with 
built-in features such as comments. People commented on not only a blog­
ger’s content but also on one another’s comments. Blog comments weren’t 
feature-rich, but they turned websites into online communities.
Now you can build your website on a blog platform and instantly have an 
easier way to manage content and updates as well as embed more social fea­
tures into your site.
Comments on blogs are no longer confined to websites. Social commenting 
tools, such as Facebook Connect comments, and third-party software add-ons, 
such as Disqus (www.disqus.com) and Livefyre (www.livefyre.com), let 
people log in to your website to comment using their social media accounts or 
identities. Add social networking triggers to your site to increase the likelihood 
of people engaging with you — and with each other — when they visit.
Table 3-1 breaks down various ways to engage through websites and blogs.

No matter how many interactive tools and features you place on your website 
or blog, people are increasingly inclined to move the conversation to their 
favorite social networks. That’s why we encourage you to embrace social net­
working for stronger and more consistent engagement than your website can 
provide and to integrate your social networks into your site to make the tran­
sition to those networks easy and seamless. We talk more about how to make 
e-mail, forums, websites, and blogs even more engaging in Chapter 8.
	
Your website content may be interesting, and people might return to read it, 
but if you cannot engage site visitors in dialogue, they’re less likely to convert 
to prospects — they’ll be avid but inactive readers.
Engaging with Social Networks
Technology developments over the past decade have played a significant role 
in moving websites from static pages to basic online community hosts to full-
blown, interactive, and interconnected social networks. A social network is a 
website with technology on the back end and features on the front end that 
give people ways to connect to one another by acting, interacting, and reacting.
Investing a lot of time, attention, effort, and money into building presences 
and communities on social networks has glaring downsides. You’re compet­
ing for the time and attention of individuals whose attention is already frac­
tured. Today’s consumers, customers, and prospects can publish and build 
an audience and online community as easily as you can. All this publishing 
adds to the glut of information and messages that are already out there, often 
translating into noise. You’re trying to get the attention of individuals who 
may also be publishers, broadcasters, and leaders of their own communities. 
You’re also competing against all the other businesses clamoring to reach 
those same individuals. Worst of all, individual tech companies — with their 
own agendas, business models, and goals — own the social networks.
	
Every social network has different rules or terms of service dictating which 
behaviors the company behind the network allows. Pay attention to the rules 
as you plan how to use each network to achieve your own business goals.
The upside of participating in social networks is that a lot of people use them, 
so you have the potential to reach a great many customers and prospects — 
and the general public at large. If you use social networks well, you have an 
inside track to people’s interests and affinities. You have the chance to reach 
them and communicate with them on mutual ground and in the environment 
where they’re most comfortable. You can build and strengthen your brand and 
your relationships with the very people who can keep your company in busi­
ness. You can also reach even more people — exponentially more people — 
when your own connections share your information with their connections.

 Chapter 3: Discovering Social Media Engagement Tools
Facebook
Facebook claims to have a billion monthly active users (as of October 2012), 
and it has become one of the largest social networks in the world. Facebook 
offers several layers of public and private information depending on which 
features members use and on how members configure their privacy settings.
Interactions and conversations happen on Facebook in a number of ways:
	
✓	Status update: Post to the Wall of a Page, the personal Timeline, or a 
Group using text, photos, videos, or links.
	
✓	Comment, Likes, and Shares: React to posts by clicking Like, posting a 
comment, or sharing the post.
	
✓	E-mail: Private message one individual or many Facebook friends. Pages 
and Groups are limited in terms of how they can message individuals to 
prevent spamming. 
	
✓	Checkins: Use a smartphone to check into a Place on Facebook if a Page 
has been set up with an actual location, or to a Facebook public event 
within three hours of the event’s start time.
	
✓	Facebook chat: Instant message one individual or groups of people. 
If you’re using your personal Timeline on Facebook to market your business, 
you may be blurring the lines between your personal communications and 
business marketing. Facebook states in its Terms of Service that you cannot 
create a personal Timeline for a business and cannot use your personal 
Timeline for commercial purposes. 
We recommend that you create a Facebook Page for your professional pres­
ence on the network, and keep your personal Timeline, well, personal. We each 
have a personal Timeline and a Facebook Page, and we use them in different 
ways. Danielle is comfortable using her personal Facebook Timeline to share 
images and news from her personal life with her Facebook friends. As a media 
personality, she is in the public eye, and a portion of her brand is about family. 
Still, she doesn’t accept friend requests from everyone who asks. Figure 3-6 
shows Danielle’s Facebook Timeline, where she shares with a wide audience 
(several times a day) a blend of family-related posts and work-related posts. 
Danielle maintains two separate Pages for both her main sites but dedicates 
the bulk of her attention to her personal Timeline because it integrates both 
sides of her brand. Danielle’s Page for her website, Extraordinary Mommy, 
centers on the content from her blog at ExtraordinaryMommy.com. (See the 
leftmost image in Figure 3-7.) Danielle’s company page, Danielle Smith Media, 
focuses on industry-related news — social media, media training, and video 
tips. (See the rightmost image in Figure 3-7.)

Aliza joined Facebook before Pages were available, so she initially used her 
personal account as her professional Facebook presence. As more of her 
friends and family joined the network, she soon realized the value of using 
it to share more personal information; by that time, however, her Facebook 
friends consisted of many people she did not know personally. When 
Facebook introduced Pages, Aliza set one up to post her business news and 
technical tips. She finds it challenging to maintain both presences. Over time, 
she has tried to make her Timeline more personal and is now careful about 
accepting friend requests.
How you use Facebook should be a combination of your personal prefer­
ences and best practices and an understanding of how others use Facebook 
and Facebook’s Terms of Service. You also have to consider the tools that 
Facebook provides for you to use, and how you use the components for 
engagement. See Chapter 9 for details on how Facebook features work to help 
you better engage with others.

Read and understand the Facebook Terms of Service (www.facebook.com/
legal/terms). The site prohibits using a personal account or personal 
Timeline for commercial gain. The company created Facebook Pages to give 
businesspeople another option. Though many people violate these rules and 
haven’t gotten caught — yet — we recommend not taking chances.
	
Facebook has been known to close down personal accounts that violate 
its rules. Per Facebook: “You will not use your personal timeline for your 
own commercial gain (such as selling your status update to an advertiser).” 
Neither are you allowed to hold contests that require participants to use 
Facebook features as part of the contest.
Twitter
With more than 140 million users, Twitter is smaller than Facebook but has 
fundamentally changed how people communicate with one another. Twitter 
has impacted not only how individuals and companies communicate but also 
how people consume and report news. Nobody ever imagined that a service 
that limits messages to 140 characters could cause such enormous changes 
around the world.
Unlike Facebook, Twitter conversations are predominantly open to the public, 
unless you choose to make your Twitter account private. Most people go 
with the default public setting to share their updates — or tweets — with the 
world. Although private Twitter accounts are available, in order to engage 
easily and widely with others, your account must be public.
Twitter has its own way of organizing conversations and interactions on 
its network that can be confusing to new users. You can communicate on 
Twitter by posting one of these elements:
	
✓	Tweet: A publicly posted message to your Twitter stream that also 
appears in the streams of your followers.
	
✓	Retweet: A publicly posted message that repeats or restates an existing 
tweet from someone else that credits the originator and can be seen by 
your followers.
	
✓	@mention: A tweet directed to someone specifically that appears in 
their stream.
	
✓	Direct message (DM): A message sent to someone else privately if you 
follow them and they follow you back.
We both love Twitter and use it often. The shorter tweet lengths may not 
appeal to you, but they force you to be more concise and specific in your

messaging. In this day and age of text messaging and smartphone use, being 
able to adapt your communications style to accommodate the smaller 
screens of mobile devices is a good skill to have.
From its early days, Twitter has allowed programmers to use its application 
programming interface (API), the behind-the-scenes code that makes up the 
network. This openness allows applications to integrate easily with Twitter, 
including tools to monitor it, manage it, measure activity on it, and post cre­
atively to it. The same cannot be said about all social networks.
We both connect some of our other favorite social networks to Twitter, 
including Instagram and Foursquare. The image on the left in Figure 3-8 
shows a tweet from Danielle using Instagram; her Instagram account con­
nects to Twitter, so she has the option to tweet to her Instagram account 
the photos she posts via her smartphone. The rightmost image in the figure 
shows a tweet from Aliza using Foursquare; Aliza tweets her Foursquare 
check-ins sparingly, and she carefully provides context so that her Twitter 
followers have more to read than simply a place name with a link. (You can 
read more about Instagram, Foursquare, and other location-based services 
later in this chapter, in the “Location-based services” section, and also in 
Chapter 14.) We talk more about enhancing Twitter in Chapter 10.
Pinterest
Pinterest was touted as the fastest-growing social network of all time when 
it surpassed 10 million monthly unique visitors in January 2012. (ComScore, 
Feb. 2012) By October 2012, Pinterest was receiving nearly 25 million monthly 
unique visitors (Compete, Oct. 2012), surpassing the popular microblogging 
site Tumblr. Pinterest is hot!

 Chapter 3: Discovering Social Media Engagement Tools
Like Twitter, Pinterest is also changing the way we communicate, focusing far 
more on images than on text. Though Twitter challenges you to publish mes­
sages in 140 characters or fewer, Pinterest pushes you to find more visual 
ways to convey your messages and position your brand. There’s no denying 
that Pinterest is all about the visuals.
If you prefer to publish text content, Pinterest can work as a gateway to con­
tent residing on your website or blog or other sites. If you prefer to communi­
cate with your audience using only text, Pinterest may hold you back based on 
how most people prefer to use the network — looking at and sharing visuals.
Even though Pinterest users can comment on pins in a similar way to commenting 
on updates and photos on Facebook, fewer than 1 percent of Pinterest users 
(according to Repinly, a Pinterest directory) choose to comment. Knowing 
the limitations of certain social networks, and how people prefer to use them, 
are important factors in choosing which networks are right for you.
You can communicate and interact on Pinterest using these actions:
	
✓	Pin: A post of an image and video to the Pinterest stream and to your 
topic-specific boards with descriptions.
	
✓	Like: A favorable reaction to other people’s pins.
	
✓	Repin: Sharing other people’s pins to your followers.
	
✓	Comment: A response to pins, but used less often than Likes and Repins.
	
✓	Collaborate: Pinning with others using Pinterest’s group boards or 
secret boards.
Pinterest introduced business accounts in late 2012 for brands. The implied 
intention of these accounts was to eventually provide companies with metrics, 
advertising, and monetization options. In early 2013, Pinterest introduced 
metrics strictly for business accounts.
We both enjoy pinning, and we appreciate the power of Pinterest. We tend to 
focus most of our online marketing time and energy, however, on networks 
where we can engage more conversationally. Regardless, Danielle has many 
videos that are ready-made for pinning. Aliza likes to use Pinterest to publish 
bite-size pieces of advice culled from her many articles and blog posts that 
lead to the content source.
We’re both firm believers that pictures speak louder than words — but we 
would add that great-looking pictures speak louder than words. A poor image 
or video is a hindrance, and not at all helpful when it comes to Pinterest.
Figure 3-9 shows how Aliza uses a Pinterest board as a résumé specifically to 
highlight her work and related articles. Figure 3-10 shows a board of inspira­
tional quotes that perfectly complement Danielle’s overall mission and message.

LinkedIn
LinkedIn has been around since 2003 — several years before Twitter was 
launched, and available to the public several years before Facebook. In August 
2012, LinkedIn reached 175 million users. A laser focus on professionals and 
businesspeople sets LinkedIn apart from all other major social networks.
If you’re looking to reach a more business-minded audience — particularly 
for B2B marketing — LinkedIn is a useful tool. We go into a lot more depth in 
Chapter 12 about engaging via LinkedIn.
As with many social networks, LinkedIn has a number of basic ways to 
engage with others with a slant toward professional networking. You interact 
on LinkedIn using these methods:

Google+
Google+ (often abbreviated as G+) hit 400 million users in September 2012, 
according to Vic Gundrota at Google. Even though Wikipedia reports that 
only 100 million Google+ users are active, that’s still a lot of users.
Despite its large user base, Google+ can feel much more intimate than other 
major social networks. Google+ has a fast-moving stream, similar to Twitter, 
and it offers many of the same multimedia and interactive features as 
Facebook Pages. Yet Google+ conversations somehow manage to feel more 
interconnected than on Twitter and more cohesive than on Facebook.
Members of Google+ can communicate in a number of ways:
	
✓	Post to their G+ streams, whether the posts consist of text, photos, 
videos, or links.
	
✓	Add a +1 rating (similar to a Facebook Like) to posts or photos.
	
✓	Share a post from someone else in your stream.
	
✓	Comment on posts.
	
✓	Text-chat within Circles.
	
✓	Video-chat in Google Hangouts.
	
✓	Live-stream video by chatting in Google Hangouts on Air.
You can also target messages to specific groups by using Google+ Circles or 
groupings of connections and create as many circles as you want. Figure 3-12 
shows a circle consisting of writers and reporters using G+.

To become familiar with the features, try out Google+, and start with a personal 
account before expanding to a Google+ Business Page. Definitely reserve your 
G+ Page name now even if you don’t start updating it. In Figure 3-13, you can see 
that Red Bull posts photos and videos of extreme sports to its Google+ Business 
Page. See Chapter 13 for different ways to engage using Google+ including G+ 
Communities.

Incorporating Audio and Video Platforms
When you evaluate tools for social media engagement, you might not immedi­
ately consider audio or video. Listening to audio or watching video may seem 
at first glance to be passive activities. Granted, listening or watching doesn’t 
involve the typical two-way or multiple-way conversations of SME. Still, audio 
and video can play an important role in stimulating engagement.
As we’ve stated elsewhere in this book, actions, reactions, and interactions 
make up engagement. Both audio and video involve publishing content — in 
this case, multimedia files uploaded to or embedded into websites, blogs, 
or social networks. Most places where you can post or view digital audio or 
video online usually include ways for people to Like, Favorite, comment on, 
or share what they listen to or watch. These interactions happen either in a 
multimedia player or on the site where the content is uploaded.
Where you have content and where you have tools in place for responding 
to that content, you have the potential for engagement. Audio or video can 
attract attention and provide content to start a conversation — so audio and 
video cannot be left out of the SME equation.

Audiocasting or podcasting
Audiocasts are digital audio broadcasts on the Internet. You may also hear 
them referred to as podcasts because they’re often played on iPods. In 2012, 
29 percent of Americans had listened to a podcast (Edison Research).
	
Podcasts can refer to video in addition to audio. In this book, podcast refers to 
digital audio online, and video podcast refers to, well, digital video online.
Most podcasts are available for listening or for download entirely for free. 
Radio stations and radio production companies can produce podcasts in pro­
fessional studios with professional audio editors. Just as often, independent 
producers, marketers, and audio enthusiasts can produce podcasts too with 
varying degrees of production quality.
Some popular podcasts on the Apple iTunes store are This American Life and 
Freakonomics Radio and a number of NPR shows.
A podcast can be delivered on G+ by using these methods:
	
✓	Live streaming: Usually recorded
	
✓	Recording: Generally followed by broadcasting
	
✓	Embedding on a site, blog, or social network: For instant or on-demand 
play
	
✓	Archived on a network: For individual download or subscription
Podcasts are recorded in many lengths and styles. Some podcasts are pro­
duced similarly to radio shows with recorded intros and outros edited in 
after the content is recorded and even with music added. Sometimes, pod­
casts contain commercials. Podcasts can also be streamed or recorded live, 
even from a mobile device, and uploaded on the fly with no editing.
Aliza is a big fan of podcasting. Several years ago, she recorded nearly 100 
episodes of Digital Marketer for the Quick and Dirty Tips Network. Since 
then, she has self-produced various podcasts including Zen of Being Digital. 
Danielle, with her strong background in television news, gravitates toward 
video. A large portion of her brand revolves around self-produced videos 
hosted on her sites and her YouTube channel and around professionally pro­
duced pieces when she is hired as an on-site correspondent. That video, too, 
ends up on all her channels.
Don’t underestimate the power and portability of audio to connect with your 
audience. You can also engage your audience in audio conversations online, 
as we explain in Chapter 15.

 Chapter 3: Discovering Social Media Engagement Tools
Videocasting or video podcasts
A mere handful of years ago, we couldn’t confidently recommend using 
online video for digital marketing and SME. Bandwidth was still an issue for 
many people, and even with the fast-growing popularity of YouTube, consum­
ers were unable to easily watch video on their Internet connections. Oh, how 
things have changed in the past few years!
Millions of people now watch videos online daily. By the end of 2011, 182 mil­
lion U.S. Internet users watched online video content and viewed 43.5 billion 
videos. Google sites — YouTube in particular — was the number-one video 
site at that time, followed by Vevo and Yahoo! Sites (comScore). That’s a lot 
of video being watched and a lot of video being uploaded.
This list describes a few ways in which digital video that’s hosted online can 
benefit your engagement. You can use a well-produced video to
	
✓	Grab the attention of your audience: Video attracts attention. The Play 
button graphic on an image immediately compels action. (Click!)
	
✓	Enhance content: Video adds a dynamic dimension and an enhanced 
visual appeal to the content you publish.
	
✓	Embed content in other formats: Video can be easily embedded into 
websites, blogs, and social networks, providing richer content to consume.
	
✓	Inspire audience reaction: Most online video players incorporate social 
features, including the ability to Like or Favorite and comment.
	
✓	Share: Digital video is easy to share, especially when someone shares a 
link to the video online or within social networks. Gone are the days of 
e-mailing large video files to share with connections.
Also gone are the days of having to spend tens of thousands or hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to produce highly polished, professional videos. These 
days, a minimally produced video can be as popular as (or even more popular 
than) videos with expensive video production.
	
Don’t set out to produce a viral video (a video that is shared organically by 
thousands or millions of people). Too many factors are at work when a video 
goes viral to be able to plan an entire marketing strategy around producing one. 
Using video for SME is one tactic in a more complex online communications plan.
YouTube
The Grand Poobah of online video is undoubtedly YouTube. The latest 
statistics on its website state that more than 800 million unique users visit

Part I: The Basics of Social Media Engagement 
YouTube every month and watch more than 4 billion hours of video. Users 
upload 72 hours of video to YouTube every minute. In 2011, YouTube had 
more than 1 trillion views, or around 140 views for every person on Earth. 
And on and on it goes.
This list describes several winning features that make YouTube useful for SME:
	
✓	It’s free. You can’t beat free for hosting video files online, especially 
when files can be large and cumbersome.
	
✓	It attracts numbers. The sheer volume of members and viewers makes 
YouTube a natural choice for video hosting and engagement.
	
✓	It benefits from search engine optimization (SEO). The added benefit 
of how YouTube videos show up in Google searches makes your videos 
hosted there potentially much more accessible.
	
✓	It has tools that are easy to use. Editing and embedding video can seem 
complicated until you use basic tools such as the ones offered on YouTube.
	
✓	It has a number of community features. YouTube incorporates engage­
ment features into its site and video player, including the ability for 
anyone to Like, comment on, embed, e-mail, and share videos (as long 
as they’re signed into their Google account). The site also offers a video 
commenting option.
	
✓	It offers advertising options. YouTube offers a number of paid advertis­
ing options to give your videos a boost and exposure to more people for 
potential engagement.
YouTube isn’t the only free video-hosting site on the block. Vimeo, for example, 
offers a free membership level and provides good-quality video playback and 
an elegant video player. If you’re looking for the highest number of eyeballs 
on your video message — and potentially the highest number of interactions 
and shares for your video — YouTube is undeniably the right tool.
	
YouTube is considered the second-largest search engine in the world. (Google 
is first.) It doesn’t hurt that Google owns YouTube. Your videos on YouTube 
may therefore have a better chance of visibility than if they’re hosted on other 
video sites.
Aliza is just getting started with online video as a tool for social media 
engagement, but several of her clients use it regularly. Danielle has been 
using video successfully for a number of years in her own business. She has 
a large enough viewership that she can monetize her videos. Because her 
entire business revolves around content production — particularly video — 
and engagement with her audience via her multimedia content, making money 
from her videos on YouTube makes sense. You may not make money directly 
from your videos on YouTube; you can, however, achieve tangible business 
goals and boost SME by incorporating YouTube-hosted videos into your online 
marketing mix. See Chapter 16 for different ways to effectively leverage YouTube.

 Chapter 3: Discovering Social Media Engagement Tools
Recognizing Other Social 
Engagement Tools
Let’s face it: The world has gone mobile. Statistics from ComScore indicate 
that 234 million U.S. residents now use mobile devices. Smartphone use has 
increased 4 percent to 110 million (more than 1 billion worldwide, believe it 
or not). That means 47 percent of Americans are using smartphones.
Tablet computers are also becoming more commonplace. According to Pew 
Research Center, as of early 2012, 58 percent of American adults have desk­
top computers, 61 percent have laptops, 18 percent own e-book readers, and 
18 percent have tablet computers. Tablet computer ownership has increased 
more than 16 percent in less than two years.
The increase in mobile device use for accessing the Internet also changes 
the way people access websites. Check your website stats, and you’ll see an 
uptick in visits to your site from mobile devices and mobile versions of social 
networks such as Facebook.
The way people communicate changes continually with the rapid rise in smart­
phone use and the increasing popularity of tablet computers. Communications 
tools are more portable than ever, and social networks are all going mobile. 
People now have unprecedented access to the tools and platforms to reach 
out to, and engage with, their audiences, customers, and prospects — which 
means that they can be reached anywhere and at any time.
Mobile applications
A mobile application, or app, is a compact piece of software that runs on a 
mobile device — a table computer, a smartphone, or even a gaming device. 
The app can be a mobile version of a website or another online content or 
be a self-contained application with content that resides entirely on a mobile 
device. Mobile apps pack features and functionality into relatively small files 
with interfaces that fit the smaller screens of tablet computers, smartphones, 
and the like.
All the most popular web-based social networks have mobile versions that 
appear legible and clear on the smaller mobile screen. Many social networks 
offer their own mobile apps so that you can easily access their networks from 
your Android or iOS mobile device. Some web-based social networks with 
apps include Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Twitter, and YouTube.
Some of these popular social networks can also be accessed from third-party 
mobile apps such as HootSuite (www.hootsuite.com) that let you post 
to many of your networks from a single mobile device. All these dashboard

Part I: The Basics of Social Media Engagement 
tools for managing your social media also have web-based versions, and 
some even have desktop versions to make access to your social networks 
conveniently cross-platform. Without the mobile aspect, however, they 
would be missing a large and growing share of users as more people turn to 
their mobile devices to access and communicate online.
	
Mobile continues to grow at an astronomical pace. According to YouTube, 
its traffic from mobile alone tripled in 2011. More than 3 hours of video is 
uploaded to YouTube from mobile devices every minute. That’s powerful.
Location-based services
A subset of mobile applications are location-based services (LBSs). LBSs are 
social networks that are focused around places — actual physical locations — 
and they tap into the GPS in a smartphone or mobile device to offer features 
and functionality. Mobile is the operative word in LBSs — they offer ways to 
turn social media engagement on the web into social mobile engagement.
Though many LBSs are available, we mostly focus on Foursquare and Instagram 
because they have options and features either geared toward or useful for 
companies and brands. We both use Foursquare and Instagram practically 
daily in our own SME efforts. Danielle is especially adept at connecting with 
her community via Instagram. Aliza has helped numerous clients incorporate 
these and other LBSs into their day-to-day engagement activities and to 
enhance offline events with online conversations. We go into more detail 
about LBS engagement in Chapter 14.

Building Trust and Credibility

▶	Harnessing the power of listening and responding to your audience
▶	Constructing the foundation for a trusting relationship with your community
▶	Measuring the response to your messages
W

ithout trust online, you have nothing. In fact, you might have less 
than nothing. It’s better for you to have zero social media engage­
ment (SME) than to have massive but untrustworthy engagement. If building 
trust and credibility online isn’t on your agenda, slowly close this book now 
and prepare for your social networks to begin gathering digital dust.
Earning Trust in Social Media
Trust can develop in two ways:
	
✓	Your audience engages with you, already believing that you’re worthy of 
their trust. If this is the case, you’re in the clear unless or until you break 
that bond of trust.
	
✓	Your audience demands that you earn their faith.
If your following is the former, lucky you. Aim to continue building — not 
breaking — their trust. To deal with the latter, read the tips in the next few 
sections.
Making your message clear
Diving in to engage in the social media sphere without ever having given 
thought to how your brand should be viewed or the messages you should 
convey is dangerous — and even more so if your brand uses social media 
publicly as a team. Take the time to flesh out your messaging — not simply 
its content but also how you express it.

Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
Giving your team clear guidelines
Putting in place your official social media engagement guidelines presents 
a unified voice and begins the process of engineering the foundation of your 
audience’s conviction that you’re worth their time, energy, and — eventually — 
their dollars.
To set up SME guidelines, follow these suggestions:
	
✓	Do your homework. Dig a little. Find out who your audience is, where 
they spend their time, and what they’re already talking about. The more 
you know about them, the easier it is to tailor your message directly to 
them.
	
✓	State your mission. As a brand or a business, you should have already 
developed a mission statement. Now it’s time to make that statement 
relevant to your social media approach to guide your team as they begin 
to share your message publicly online. USA.gov calls its approach the 
“guiding principle” and reminds everyone working on its social media 
team that everything it does is “motivated by this principle.”
	
✓	Make them short and sweet. Your team doesn’t need guidelines the 
size of a novel. If your written guidelines are too long and complicated, 
your team won’t understand them, process them, remember them, or 
use them to engage. Guidelines that are succinct are easier to commit to 
memory and to follow with ease.
	
✓	Allow for experimentation. You can follow your guidelines — and you 
can also “color outside the lines.” Trusting that your team can effec­
tively use the information you give them, and expand on it, pushes your 
message to the next level of engagement.
Interacting authentically
We suspect that the word authentic raises your buzzword hackles, if you’ve 
heard it (as we have) time and time again in reference to social media. Yet 
the words real and genuine, though they mean the same thing, don’t seem to 
carry the same punch to relay the importance of the qualities of your brand 
when engaging with your community online. This list describes the brand 
qualities that create authenticity (and build trust) in social media engagement:
	
✓	Personality: Show some. Your audience engages because they feel 
invested in who you are as a brand or company. Are you fun and fearless 
or serious and savvy — or the one who brightens their day? Showing 
personality gives a glimpse of the people behind the brand.

69
 Chapter 4: Building Trust and Credibility
	
✓	Honesty: Nurture it. Honesty goes hand in hand with the trust you’re 
trying to build. When someone in your community asks a question, 
respond to the best of your ability — and be truthful. If you don’t know 
an answer, promise to find out. Trusting you, they’ll come back to learn 
more. Return with an honest answer.
	
✓	Transparency: Give your SME teams names and faces to create personal 
connections. The Kodak account on Twitter, for example, is run by the 
company’s chief blogger and social media manager, Jenny Cisney. It’s 
her face you see when you communicate with Kodak on Twitter, as 
shown in Figure 4-1. When people know that they can connect with an 
individual behind your brand, your brand becomes personalized.
	
✓	Ownership: Take responsibility for your mistakes — they happen. Your 
community will judge you far more harshly if you attempt to act as 
though they don’t. Owning up to praise is easy. Also respond openly to 
your customers’ questions, concerns, and criticisms. Your greatest crit­
ics can become your most outspoken fans when they trust that you hear 
them and respond honestly and transparently.
	
Use the word you when engaging in social media rather than refer to generic 
customers or people. Your audience prefers that you speak with them, not 
about them or at them. Make it personal.

Finding your brand’s voice
One step in conveying your personality online is finding your brand’s voice. 
If you’re building a bigger brand that involves many people behind the brand, 
you still need a unifying voice that everyone who posts online for your brand 
can use.
Figure 4-2 shows how CoverGirl uses Instagram to reveal its unique personality, 
by showcasing new makeup, trends, and events in keeping with its followers’ 
expectations.
	
Not every attitude translates well online, and yours may not be perceived the way 
you intend. If you personally are the brand, be careful about the personality you 
convey when interacting with others online. As you can see in Table 4-1, there’s 
a fine line between the quality you’re aiming for and how others might see it.

Contributing meaningfully 
to the conversation
Conversations are happening everywhere online, and many of them take 
place in social networks. Become part of those conversations in a way that 
makes sense to your brand and your business goals and to your audience.
Recommendations from friends and family, and even those from social net­
works, are referred to as earned media in the advertising world. According to 
Nielsen, of the consumers who were interviewed worldwide, 92 percent say 
that they trust earned media more than all other forms of advertising (www.
contentcurationmarketing.com/consumers-trust-earned-media-
more-than-paid-media-according-to-nielsen/).

According to ROI Research, of the users who were interviewed, 58 percent 
of Twitter users and 53 percent of Facebook users who were interviewed 
said that they’re likely to purchase a product after following a company or 
product in social media. Trust in a brand, and interaction with it in social net­
works, can translate into sales.
We cover online interaction in much more detail in Chapter 7. For now, follow 
these tips to start entering conversations in the right places and in the right 
ways:
	
✓	Investigate the topics that matter to your audience. Research to find 
out where they spend their time and what topics they care most about. 
See whether you can reach them on Facebook or Twitter, and whether 
they’re willing to read your content or respond to beautiful pictures, for 
example, on Pinterest or Instagram. A tool such as Followerwonk (www.
followerwonk.com) assesses your followers’ interests and creates a 
word cloud, a visualized series of words compiled of the most popular 
user-generated words or tags. The word cloud is for you to showcase 
those interests on your website or other social media platform. You can 
also ask current customers and prospects where they spend their time 
online and what they’re comfortable doing there.
	
✓	Build your social media presence. After you know where your audience 
interacts, go there. Create a Facebook Fan Page or sign up for Twitter or 
start a Pinterest account. Hire a writer to compose content for your blog 
or even for your social networks. Listen, respond, and start engaging. Let

your audience know that they matter to you from the moment they con­
nect with you.
	
✓	Continue asking questions. After you have established a presence in 
suitable networks and you’re building an audience, continue asking 
them questions. Prove to your audience that their thoughts and opin­
ions matter to you by asking them what they think and by listening to 
what they have to say.
Mabel’s Labels, a small business based in Toronto, Canada, established its 
footing firmly in the social media space by interacting daily with its customers. 
The company knew that, to be successful, its representatives had to discuss 
topics other than Mabel’s products. The business regularly asks questions 
of its followers, answers questions, and follows up on discussions the same 
as in face-to-face conversations. See an example in Figure 4-3 of how Mabel’s 
Labels asks questions.

 Chapter 4: Building Trust and Credibility
A meaningful conversation is one where the parties involved gain value from 
the exchange. Not every conversation is easy. Sometimes, events that are 
beyond your company’s control affect your business and your customers. 
Use your social networks to maintain the dialogue about what is happening 
as it happens so that your customers feel acknowledged and important.
Create an incentive
Asking questions isn’t the only way to inspire people in your online com­
munity to start talking. Sometimes, you need to do a little more to keep your 
customers curious, engaged, and interested in coming back to your online 
presence — and to keep them talking about you publicly to their friends, 
fans, and followings. Sure, people are often happy to describe their plans for 
New Year’s Eve, the foods they’re eating for breakfast, their favorite restau­
rants in San Diego, or the best parts of their day, but after they answer, they 
have no incentive to come back.
Make your audience feel like an important part of your brand, like they’re 
part of the family or part of your team.
Share quality content — yours and others’
Blasting content about your company, products, or services 24-7 is the same 
behavior exhibited by the kid in the front row in third grade, who continually 
raises his hand and shouts, “Me! Me! Me!” Surely your followers like you for a 
reason, but they want to know that you’re more than a one-trick pony. Here’s 
the key question to ask: Do you share quality content about any topics other 
than yourself or your brand?
To do so, move outside your brand sphere and look for compatible brands 
and individuals who can help you educate, inspire, and entertain your com­
munity. Take a look at Chipotle, for example — a chain restaurant that has 
quite a following. At this writing, the company has more than 2 million Likes 
on its Facebook Fan Page. Chipotle works with chefs who provide audiences 
with recipes and cooking instructions at events and align with organizations 
such as the Farmer Veteran Coalition to support good causes such as helping 
mobilize veterans to feed those in need across America (see Figure 4-4). The 
company posts updates to Facebook with content about these other individu­
als and organizations.

Listening carefully to your community
Broadcasting to your community and never stopping to listen to what they 
have to say in return makes it impossible, in the long run, for others to 
trust you. Think about the times you’ve had conversations with friends or 
colleagues and suddenly realized that they weren’t even listening to you. 
“Listening” online usually requires reading. Finding the most relevant infor­
mation to read — in this case, people’s opinions about your brand — starts 
by monitoring online conversations. Though we advise you throughout this 
book to be attentive and responsive in your own social networks, you also 
have to listen beyond them.
A variety of tools can help you better listen to your community and to the 
online community at large. In Parts III and IV of this book, we discuss the lis­
tening tools and techniques that are unique to the social networks Facebook, 
Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.

 Chapter 4: Building Trust and Credibility
Checking out conversations about you
Begin with one of the easiest and most comprehensive methods to monitor what is being said about 
you and your brand by setting up Google Alerts. To do so, go to www.google.com/alerts 
(see the figure), and then follow these steps:
	 1.	 Fill in the query field with the term you want to search for.
	
	 Type your business name, a common misspelling of your business name, the name of your 
company’s CEO, or the names of its products, for example. You can set up more than one alert.
	 2.	 Enter the result type for the term you’re searching for.
	
	 For the most comprehensive results, choose Everything. You can always hone in later.
	 3.	 Choose how often to notify you about a matching alert: as it happens, once a day, or once a 
week.
	 4.	 Specify the number of results you want: all of them or only the best.
	 5.	 Include your e-mail address so that you can receive alerts in your inbox.
	 6.	 Click the red Create Alert button.

Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
Responding promptly for greater impact
We know that it’s impossible for you to be online and monitoring your social 
networks 24 hours a day. Set a schedule for regular checks of your online 
communities to manage the conversations in an organized fashion. More 
important, in addition to setting alerts to hear what the online community is 
saying about you (see the nearby sidebar “Checking out conversations about 
you”), make the time to pay attention to your community so that you can 
hear what they’re saying to you and respond in a timely manner.
Check in regularly throughout the day to catch what is being said that 
doesn’t reach you by way of alerts. Go online during the periods when the 
largest number of people — including your customers and prospects — are 
present: early in the morning, midmorning, early afternoon, and early eve­
ning. Knowing your audience and interacting with them often can help you 
determine the best times to reach your own online community.
	
If you live and work on the east coast but your target market and most of your 
audience is based in California, adjust your timing for online content publish­
ing and interacting accordingly.
The timeliness of your responses is an important part of trust-building online. 
Leaving questions unanswered for days, weeks, or even longer leaves a bad 
taste in a customer’s mouth and can dissolve that person’s trust in you.
	
A timely response is even more important when you (or someone posting for 
you) make a mistake. Address mistakes as quickly as possible — it can mean 
the difference between a positive and negative impression of your brand.
Ramon de Leon owns several Domino’s Pizza franchises in the Chicago area. 
When a customer tweeted a complaint about receiving the wrong pizza, De Leon 
did more than fix the problem — he posted a tweet, as shown in Figure 4-5, to 
explain that the correct order was en route and that the store would “wow” 
her. Then he created a personalized video apology with his store manager. This 
video, which has been viewed more than 160,000 times, is a stellar example of 
social media follow-through.
Giving the audience what they want
After you have drawn your audience’s attention, you’re faced with the million-
dollar question: how to keep their attention and compel them to action? 
Crucial to solving this puzzle is how you follow through, though the answer 
starts with the foundation you lay. This list explains several reasons that 
people stay connected with you in social networks — why they click the Like 
button or share your posts:

✓	The content resonates with them. Your content makes them smile or 
laugh or moves them emotionally.
	
✓	The content originates from a source they trust. The content was 
shared by you, a friend or connection on a social network.
	
✓	The content reflects something about themselves. You may have pub­
lished the information, but they agree and react to it and share it to 
reveal a part of themselves.
	
✓	The content puts them in-the-know. People like to be the “first to know” 
or to have insider information on special promotions, contests, and 
other offers. Some also like to be the first of their friends to share this 
news within their own circles.
	
✓	Others respond. People like to have things in common with others, 
and when other people respond to your content, it invites even more 
responses that continue the conversation and build bonds.
	
✓	You respond. If people know that you’re right there to acknowledge 
them when they like or comment on your content, it’s incentive to 
respond again. People love to be noticed and to feel that they matter.
	
✓	You give perks. People like to be part of the “in crowd,” and beyond 
information, you can offer them discounts, coupons, and deals that they 
receive because they’re connected with you. Plus, they can pass along 
offers to friends to spread the good feeling all around.

Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
The better you know your audience, the more likely you are to post content 
that people feel connected to — and that they’ll respond to and engage in. 
Then it’s your turn to be responsive, to engage, and to follow through to 
build a stronger relationship and give others good reasons to trust you.
Building Trust in Traditional 
Online Marketing
Before Twitter, there was the e-mail newsletter. Before Facebook Fan Pages, 
businesses ran online banner ads. Traditional online marketing — like news­
letters, banner ads, and e-mail marketing — still exists and also requires a 
level of trust. Building a rapport between your brand and your customers 
and prospects builds your business and helps your brand thrive.
Engaging appropriately with the media
Emphasizing social media engagement doesn’t mean that you ignore the 
importance of the role of traditional media. Being mentioned in the media is 
still an important part of marketing, and press pages on company websites are 
filled, for good reason, with the logos representing media outlets such as Wall 
Street Journal, The New York Times, Oprah, Fast Company, Today, and CNN. 
Television, print magazines, and newspapers still exist and are still powerful.
These days, these media hits often happen because brands do more than 
send press releases and make cold calls to members of the press. Reporters 
and producers pay attention to social networks for potential news stories 
and to find news sources organically. Savvy brands can position themselves 
in social media to attract the media’s attention, and they can engage with 
members of the press by following them in social networks to engage them 
in dialogue, draw their attention to potential news stories, and provide 
resources including links.
Nurture relationships with your local media and even with national or inter­
national media. Find creative ways to suggest story ideas and to position 
yourself or someone from your team as a topical expert. Incorporate images 
and video into your online pitches via social media to attract attention. Work 
to build a reputation as a trustworthy and reliable source for quotes and 
news leads.
	
Strongly consider media training for whoever might be appearing on camera 
or acting as a company spokesperson. Being knowledgeable about your topic 
doesn’t compensate for a lack of polished media presence. Displaying poor 
skills in front of the camera can hurt your credibility and even make you look 
untrustworthy.

 Chapter 4: Building Trust and Credibility
Adding engagement to press releases
Traditional press releases are taking new forms because of social media. They 
can no longer simply make announcements and spew marketing language. A 
press release must now be part of the conversation in social networks.
With the growth of social media and publishing tools at everyone’s fingertips, the 
days of editors and producers serving as the gatekeepers of news have passed. 
Anyone can be a citizen reporter, creating and sharing news with friends, fans, 
and followers. This situation places reporters — and PR people — in precarious 
positions if they fail to adapt to the new ways of disseminating news.
Making your press release social is another way to become transparent. 
The more accessible your company news and information are to the general 
public, the greater level of trust and credibility you build. To give your press 
releases a better chance of being seen, and of bypassing the traditional chan­
nels of news publishing, you can
	
✓	Include links to your social networks: These links allow members of 
the media to engage with your company online. Include links within the 
press releases that lead to additional content, to even more multimedia, 
and especially to all the major social sharing networks.
	
✓	Share them on your blog and social networks: Putting this information 
on your platforms increases the opportunity for it being seen by your 
community and spread to other sources who might want to cover it.
	
✓	Add social sharing tools to every release: That way, readers can share 
them easily with their connections.
	
✓	Host them on the web: Most social-media–powered releases are now 
hosted on the web rather than e-mailed or faxed.
	
✓	Use short, catchy headlines: Headlines in press releases should make 
sense, be relevant to readers, and be crafted with search engine opti­
mization (SEO) in mind. A headline often becomes the content for your 
tweet or update with a link to the rest of the release.
	
✓	Make it multimedia: A press release should contain images (perfect for 
Facebook and Pinterest) and even embedded audio and video files. Since 
the releases are hosted on the web, embedding multimedia like this to 
enhance them is a breeze.
	
✓	Provide “tweetable” quotes: Content is consumed at a fast pace online. 
Pull out quotes and excerpts of your releases that have a maximum of 120 
characters so that they’re easily shared on social networks, especially 
Twitter.
When writing a press release, consider the story you’re trying to tell. 
Storytelling is an important part of engaging in social media. Start there and 
use the elements of storytelling to convert a press release from a static docu­
ment into a dynamic start of a conversation.

Just because your release is more “social” doesn’t mean that you should disre­
gard the best practices of press release writing. Good grammar, proper punc­
tuation, and addressing “the six W’s” of information-gathering — who, what, 
when, where, why, and how — are still essential parts of any well-written 
press release regardless of the distribution method.
	
Use social media release (SMR) tools such as PitchEngine (http://new.pitch
engine.com) and PressDoc (www.pressdoc.com) to easily build press 
releases on the web with embedded social features at an affordable price. These 
tools are specifically designed to bring journalists and social media together 
and offer stats so you can determine who has seen your press release.
Soliciting third-party endorsements 
the right way
Satisfied customers represent gold that’s waiting to be mined. The best way 
to have them endorse your brand? Ask. Don’t be afraid to request online 
reviews about you or ratings of your business, product, or service.
Make it worth the effort for people to praise you publicly. When a happy 
customer raves about you on a social network, be sure to express your grati­
tude. Share their kind words with your larger fan base. Find a creative way to 
say thank you.
Lead people to popular review sites so that their praise finds even more 
exposure, such as
	
✓	Yelp: www.yelp.com
	
✓	Google Places for Business: www.google.com/places
	
✓	Angie’s List: www.angieslist.com
Press releases: Not just for the Big News
David Meerman Scott, the author of The New 
Rules of Marketing & PR (John Wiley & Sons, 
Inc.), suggests that the rules for the modern 
press release have changed and encourages 
you to adjust right along with it. One piece 
of advice he gives is “Don’t just send press 
releases when ‘big news’ is happening; find 
good reasons to send them all the time.”
We agree with David that the formal press 
release, sent only occasionally to announce a 
company’s big news, is now defunct. Look for 
ways to tell your story often and to keep your 
stories “out there” as part of your daily online 
conversations. Your conversations with the 
media in social networks should be ongoing, 
not monthly or quarterly, when your calendar 
indicates that it’s time to send a release.

✓	Citysearch: www.citysearch.com
	
✓	Yahoo! Local: http://local.yahoo.com
Positive, unsolicited reviews from consumers at these review sites go a long 
way toward building your brand’s credibility. Controlling the content of 
reviews on public sites, however, is impossible.
	
Never fake a positive review for your own business in a social network or 
review site. If you get caught and called out publicly, you can instantly lose 
your credibility and the public’s trust. On a review site, you can be banned; 
on a social network, you can’t be banned for pretending to be a satisfied cus­
tomer, but the loss of trust isn’t even remotely worth any perceived benefit.
Assessing Trust and Credibility
You know that you’re trustworthy. You believe that you’re credible. But how 
does your community feel about you? Having a lot of friends, fans, and followers 
as well as likes, follows, and repins may seem to be tangible measurements of 
how people feel about your brand, but they may not tell the full story.
Be sure that the people who are connecting with your brand via social media 
are truly connecting with you — and will stay connected over the long haul.
Analyzing sentiment and impact
Understanding whether your community has a positive, negative, or neutral 
response to you and your brand can help you determine how to continually 
hone your social media engagement approach. How you measure up against 
competitors in the minds of your online audience is another important factor 
to assess. You can also benefit from identifying the key influencers who are 
driving the bulk of the online conversation about you and the general consen­
sus among the most vocal members of your community.
Many tools (either free versions or paid versions that offer free trials or free 
levels) can help you measure some less obvious aspects of social media 
engagement. Here are a few that we like:
	
✓	Sysomos (www.sysomos.com) has a social media monitoring tool, 
Heartbeat, that measures sentiment and helps track conversations by 
country, city, or state or by profession or gender. (Pricey.)
	
✓	SalesForceMarketingCloud (www.salesforcemarketingcloud.com) 
Formerly Radian6, SalesForce ties in to Google Analytics, Webtrends, 
and Omniture to gather statistics and determine which online thought

leaders are generating the most chatter about you and driving the great­
est amount of traffic to your sites. (Pricey.)
	
✓	PeopleBrowsr (http://rs.peoplebrowsr.com), a lower-cost alterna­
tive to the paid services, lets you search by topic, brand, or name. Use 
it to highlight as many as 1,000 days of Twitter conversations, and filter 
results by gender, sentiment, community, or location. In Figure 4-6, 
you can see sample search results for Danielle’s Twitter handle — 
@DanielleSmithTV. (Affordable with a 14-day free trial.)
	
✓	Simply Measured (http://simplymeasured.com) is fee-based, but 
you can have free reports e-mailed to you, including a free Facebook 
Competitive Analysis Report to see what other brands are doing well 
and a free Klout Audience Report to see how effectively you’re engaging 
with your followers on Twitter. (Paid but offers free reports.)
	
✓	Social Mention (www.socialmention.com) uses the tagline Like Google 
Alerts, but for social media. In seconds, this service measures the likelihood 
that your brand is being discussed in social media and whether the general 
sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. The results also indicate the 
possibility that the people who are talking about you will do so repeatedly 
and list the keywords being used in connection with your brand or name.

 Chapter 4: Building Trust and Credibility
Measuring the amplification 
of your messages
Hidden behind the noise of social media, competing for attention, is amaz­
ing content — your amazing content. Occasionally, you may feel as if you’re 
standing at the edge of the Grand Canyon, shouting your message, asking 
questions, and sharing an extraordinary story with only this response: an 
empty echo.
As we discuss earlier in this chapter, the key to hearing more than an echo is 
to listen. As you move from one social platform to another, as you share an 
image, as you ask a question, or as you dole out a slice of content that you 
know is special, you gauge the results.
Did your community like an image 84 times, comment 24 times, and share it 
2 times — yet no one responded when you asked whether they had plans for 
the weekend? The solution is easy: Share another image and try a different 
type of question.
Though some social networks provide you with insights into how well people 
are responding to your social media engagement efforts, a myriad of third-
party tools can help you measure response rates across your social networks 
or on the ones that lack built-in tools. Here are a few that we like:

To avoid having to simply notice the ebbs and flows of responses when you’re 
trying to engage, invest in the appropriate analytics tools to more accurately 
and consistently read how well you’re engaging. These tools can help you 
determine how to improve the way you engage and in turn improve the results 
of your engagement efforts.
As you respond, engage, and talk, your customers will see you as an individ­
ual, not an entity. You’re humanized. You gain credibility and trust. You win.

our presence in this online space determines your purpose, at least in 
the eyes of your audience. In this chapter, we discuss the many ways you 
can manage your online existence, set the expectations of your community, 
follow up on a regular basis, and create true connections. 
A human touch, pushing beyond the logo that defines so many brands and 
businesses to engage with the audience, captures the feeling that identifies you.
Setting Realistic Goals Up Front
“The start is what stops most people.”
—Don Shula
We suspect that Don Shula, the former Miami Dolphins football coach, might 
well have been referring to social media engagement (SME) when he spoke 
of the challenge of getting started. Faced with the head-spinning efforts of 
maneuvering a blog or Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, or 
another of the seemingly unlimited social media websites, being tackled by 
an offensive lineman might somehow sound more appealing.

Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
In football, no player can quarterback the team, tackle players, and receive 
passes all at the same time. In social media, certainly, neither you nor your 
team can master all the engagement skills and participate in all your social 
networks at one time. You need careful planning and a process to juggle all 
the activities of SME.
Regardless of human limitations, being present in social networks is critical 
to your success at engaging via social media. You — or your team members 
or representatives — should actively and directly engage with your online 
community members, friends, fans, and followers.
To see how to be not only present but also effective online, start by assessing 
your capacity and studying the competition, as we discuss in the following 
sections.
Assessing your capacity
When Danielle was following her first passion, television reporting, she 
accepted a job in a small market — Yuma, Arizona. A reporter embarking in 
this career usually operates as a “one-man-band.” Danielle had to play the 
role of reporter, photographer, producer, and news anchor. Her ability to 
truly master each of these jobs was limited not by lack of skill or desire but 
by being only one person with only so much talent or ability. But she learned 
over time exactly which tasks she could master and which ones to complete 
only acceptably so that she didn’t “burn out” on her profession.
Honestly evaluating your company’s capacity to handle every aspect of SME 
is important early on so that you don’t set yourself up for failure — and 
everyone who works with you. If you’re a one-person band for your brand’s 
SME, you have to be smart and selective about the tools you use, the way you 
use them, and the way you engage.
To set realistic expectations about your aptitude for engaging with custom­
ers and prospects in social media, consider these factors:
	
✓	Time: Determine how much time — daily, weekly, or monthly — you can 
invest in engaging in social networks.
	
✓	Resources: Outline the support system you have in place to do the work. 
Resources in SME usually refers to
	
•	People who handle the work
	
•	Tools and services you use to streamline the work
	
✓	Skills: Even if you have the people and the tools to engage, without the 
right skills or the capacity to develop those skills via training, no amount 
of resources will put you on the right track toward properly engaging 
with your audience online.

 Chapter 5: Demonstrating Your Online Presence to Maximize Engagement
	
Maintaining a poor social media presence is worse than having no presence. 
With an inactive presence, your audience assumes you are listening, but will 
fault you for the days and weeks of silence when their thoughts and questions 
go unanswered. Avoid the temptation to let tools that maintain your presence 
in social networks substitute for using them well based on best practices. 
Additionally, if you don’t know how to properly engage, your presence in your 
networks can fall flat or — worse — create a social media crisis. Research how 
best to use the resources at your disposal — or make time for proper training.
Evaluating the competition
You can learn a lot from watching and analyzing the best behaviors of com­
petitors. You need to know where you stack up in online reach, conversation, 
and engagement. Looking toward competitors for benchmarks is a common 
business practice.
Services such as Simply Measured (http://simplymeasured.com) compare 
and analyze you and your competition to determine who has the competitive 
edge. Simply Measured incorporates Facebook, Google+, Google Analytics, 
Instagram, Klout, Twitter, Vimeo, and YouTube. The analytics tool provides 
benchmarks for, and analysis of, how you and your competitors are faring 
across social networks in these areas:
	
✓	Engagement rate: This metric looks at your overall engagement and your 
competitor’s engagement, and at which percentage of the conversation 
is original from your brand versus an @reply to an existing conversation. 
The difference here is important in order to measure true engagement 
and not simply broadcast messages.
	
✓	Responsiveness: Members of your community want to know that they 
can trust you. (See Chapter 4 to gain their trust.) Gauge your level of 
responsiveness in relation to the other businesses in your industry. We 
don’t have to tell you that your customers expect you to reply when 
they reach out. You can generate reports that measure timeliness, 
response rate (as in the percentage of time you respond to an inbound 
tweet), and the length of the conversation.
	
✓	Reach: This term refers to the size and strength of your overall social 
presence in social networks, your fans and following, and their comments 
and likes, as compared to your competition.
Using a tool such as Simply Measured can help you identify realistic goals for 
your company’s responsiveness as an essential part of SME. The manner and 
timeframe of your responses to queries in your social networks can clearly 
reveal your commitment to being present.
Note how present the competition is in their social networks and how engaged 
they are within their online communities. Learn from their successes and their 
failures. Improve on what they do well, and avoid what clearly isn’t working.

Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
Recording your own statistics over time is important; however, don’t do it 
in a vacuum. Measure your engagement efforts against your competitors at 
least quarterly. Evaluating the competition isn’t a one-time endeavor.
	
Search online to find ratings or reports on your industry’s progress in SME. 
For example, the Vintank Brand Index measures how wineries are engaging 
on Facebook and Twitter and ranks them based on a number of factors, such 
as fan growth and interaction. Use these numbers to set goals for your own 
engagement activities.
Paying Attention to Demonstrate 
Presence
If you’re paying attention, you know when your brand is being talked about 
online. When you listen to what is being said, you know what your next steps 
should be to properly engage.
Too many companies allow comments and questions to remain unanswered 
or unacknowledged on their pages. Dozens of comments per day may seem 
close to impossible to handle, but making a commitment and demonstrating 
presence goes a long way toward proving to customers and prospects that 
you value them.
Being notified when you need to engage
To stay on top of those mentions or conversations that need your attention 
or review, put monitoring tools and practices into place. Even when you 
aren’t online, you need to be aware of what is being said to, and about, you.
We talk about the importance of listening in Chapter 4. You “listen” in social 
networks mostly by reading. You can read the streams of content that you 
see when you log in to social channels, but when you’re not there, set up 
alerts and notifications to let you know when you need to respond.
Setting alerts and notifications
Follow the strategies described in this list to set up alerts and notifications:
	
✓	Google Alerts (www.google.com/alerts): As we describe in a sidebar 
in Chapter 4, these free alerts notify you anytime a name or keyword 
you’ve chosen is found in news articles, on blogs, or in the Google 
search engine (so it includes some public posts from forums and social 
www.Ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.Ebook777.com
89
 Chapter 5: Demonstrating Your Online Presence to Maximize Engagement
networks). Simply fill out the alerts as we describe to make notifications 
arrive in your inbox.
	
✓	Twitter (https://twitter.com): The microblogging site allows snippets 
of conversation to happen 24 hours a day — 140 characters at a time. 
Your community will often use this tool to reach out with questions, 
thoughts, and concerns.
	
	You can use several tools to access Twitter. You can set some of these 
tools to notify you when designated keywords are mentioned in tweets, 
such as Echofon (www.echofon.com), TweetDeck (www.tweetdeck.
com), and HootSuite (http://hootsuite.com). You can customize 
columns in TweetDeck and HootSuite to keep track of other people, 
trending topics, and even groups.
	
✓	Facebook (https://www.facebook.com): This site has both a personal 
and professional use, allowing you to engage with your audience at any 
time to hear feedback, share news, and have conversations.
	
	Use the Pages Manager app for iOS to receive notifications for all pages 
you manage. You can also receive notifications of mentions and interac­
tions on your Facebook Page via e-mail and on your mobile device.
	
	From your Facebook Page, go to Account Settings and select Notifications, 
and then choose ways to be notified (in addition to on Facebook, where 
you receive all notifications). You can also choose to be notified by 
e-mail, with numerous options; by push notification (as described in 
the following section), depending on which mobile app you’re using to 
monitor Facebook; or by text, with additional breakdowns such as 
types of activities that trigger notifications and time frames for receiv­
ing them. You can read more about optimizing your SME on Facebook in 
Chapter 9.
See Chapter 4 for more options for listening tools that notify you and let you 
manage responses.
	
Set up multiple alerts so that you’re notified whenever your brand name is 
mentioned — even if someone misspells it or uses your Twitter handle or any 
other variable to mention you, your company, team members, products, ser­
vices, or related brands. Check out the nearby sidebar for more about setting 
and monitoring alerts.
	
Avoid falling behind or having to play catch-up. Missing important mentions 
exhibits weak customer relationships and a poor understanding of SME. 
Staying on top of alerts gives you time to respond and, if necessary, address 
team members to ensure that everyone is on the same page to properly 
respond.

Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
Increasing efficiency with push notifications
A push notification is the friendly signal that new interactions have taken 
place on one of your social platforms. These notifications typically arrive 
via mobile device and, depending on the settings, announce that you’ve 
been mentioned on Twitter or that someone has liked, or commented on, 
an update on your Facebook Page, for example. These notifications can also 
come from social media management (SMM) tools such as HootSuite.
A push notification prompts you to respond. To turn these notifications on or 
off on your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad, follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap the Settings button on the Home screen.
	
	 Small gears appear on the button.
	
2.	Tap the Notifications button.
	
	 It looks like a red circle in the middle of a black square.
	
3.	Scroll down and tap the applications that you want to place in the 
Notifications Center.
	
	 Apps in the Notifications Center are listed at the top, with others below 
them. You can toggle this setting on or off by tapping each app.
To turn on push notifications on an Android device, you manage them in 
an individual app’s settings. (An app may have notifications turned on by 
default.) In newer versions of the Android operating system, to disable 
unnecessary notifications so that you can focus on the ones that matter, 
simply tap and hold your finger on the notification the next time it pops up. 
From there, you’ll be directed to the app management screen to deselect the 
Show Notifications option.
Monitor this!
Set up alerts to monitor these items:
	
	 Name of your company
	
	 Common misspellings of your company’s 
name
	
	 Names of key employees
	
	 Main product names
	
	 Website name (if it’s different from the 
company’s name)
	
	 Other brand names associated with your 
company
	
	 Company’s Twitter handles
	
	 Company-specific keywords and hashtags
	
	 Industry-specific terms
	
	 Industry (or other) relevant keywords and 
hashtags
	
	 Names of primary competitors

 Chapter 5: Demonstrating Your Online Presence to Maximize Engagement
	
To be effective in SME and to demonstrate presence, avoid the impulse to 
respond immediately to every single notification. You should be able to see at 
least part of any comment being made in order to quickly assess its urgency 
and either respond quickly or put it aside to view later.
Responding to comments and following up
When you call a customer service line, you expect someone to answer the 
phone — even when you know that many customer service numbers are not 
manned 24/7. Even though the focus of SME is not to provide friendly phone 
calls or face-to-face interaction, your fans increasingly expect responsiveness. 
Somehow, SME promises more than a customer service call can deliver.
Because many companies are now responding effectively, consumers have 
increasingly high expectations. Rather than take traditional routes to praise 
and complain, they take to their social channels of choice — often, just to 
register frustrations about response times.
One brand that excels at “hearing” its customers in social networks and 
responding in a timely manner is Jockey. If you stop by its Facebook Page 
on any given day, you can see that questions, comments, and critiques are 
addressed individually — all of them.
Does Jockey have a perfect response or solution every time? No, but its cus­
tomers definitely value being heard. As you can see in Figure 5-1, a customer 
thanked the company for its response, even though it wasn’t the one she was 
seeking.

Four Canadian moms, determined to label every item that their children 
might ever lose — from clothing to sippy cups, and from school supplies to 
stationery — founded the company Mabel’s Labels. They relied heavily on 
social media engagement to build their brand and customer base.
From sponsoring giveaways to highlighting individual customers to inspir­
ing Wow-I’m-a-mommy! moments (see Figure 5-2), the founders make it more 
than their job to connect, respond to, and reconnect with their more than 
64,000 Facebook fans and more than 22,000 Twitter followers — it’s their way 
of life. They receive more than 60 comments to a single question, and 20 com­
ments deep, they respond to keep the conversation going.
Each connection, response, and follow-up you can make in your social channels 
solidifies your brand in a consumer’s mind.

Establishing a Presence Process
Listening, responding, following up — all these activities take a lot of time, 
but they also demonstrate your commitment to being present in your social 
channels. We know that being present around the clock isn’t a realistic 
option, so put in place strategic processes to ensure that your brand has

 Chapter 5: Demonstrating Your Online Presence to Maximize Engagement
presence even when the humans behind the brand aren’t sitting behind their 
computers or holding their mobile devices.
Your presence process can include messaging that’s precrafted and sched­
uled. When developing a plan that best serves your audience, allow your 
business goals to be your compass — and build from there. Whether you aim 
to increase brand awareness, build your audience, or sell a product, having a 
goal is only a start — you need a map to go along with that compass.
Before you embark on a vacation, you probably research to find the informa­
tion you need and study some maps. As you embark on SME activities, you 
can benefit from doing similar research and developing a road map to guide 
your communications in your social channels.
In the beginning stages, the process for maintaining a visible social presence 
includes these steps:
	
1.	Identify your goals, the audience, and the actions you want to drive.
	
2.	Assess your assets, such as the content you have (or that you can 
create) and the images and video at your disposal.
	
3.	Locate your audience online wherever they congregate, communicate, 
and connect.
	
4.	Choose the networks where you can best reach your audience.
	
5.	Build and design your presence (possibly in multiple locations), and 
create any additional assets to properly benefit from each network.
	
6.	Begin engaging strategically, by reaching out in the right way to the 
right people with the right messages.
To get the engagement right, you have to do some planning, by answering 
these basic questions: How will you engage with others? What will you say? 
How will you say it? Who will you address? Where and when?
Before you start engaging online, your planning process should include two 
components: a social media messaging map and a social media editorial 
calendar. Those two tools serve as guides to maintaining messaging that’s 
consistent, on-brand, and targeted while you’re in the midst of communicating 
across social channels.
Creating a messaging map
As a business, you should have already established your brand and defined 
your voice and personality. Having a clear brand identity that informs all your 
messaging is part of both traditional marketing and online marketing.

Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
With SME, a distinct character and an intrinsic understanding of the qualities 
of your brand guide the way you present yourself online. The words you use, 
the tone you adopt, the images you upload, and the way you respond to and 
interact with others defines the you that your audience knows and loves.
If you represent a brand, clearly specify the “personality” you use online. In 
most instances, companies use a brand personality that expresses a unified 
voice. Everyone on a company’s social media team adopts that same identity 
for consistency. In some cases, allowing individual team members to be iden­
tified or to stand out is part of an overarching strategy to convey the brand’s 
image.
A social media messaging map differs a little from other documents or tools 
that may be referred to as message maps. The document known as a social 
media messaging map is based on your brand qualities but also maps out 
these elements:
	
✓	Who you’re trying to reach
	
✓	What you want to say to them
	
✓	How to attract their attention and engage them in conversation
	
✓	What actions you want to drive
A messaging map that’s thoughtfully developed and clearly organized encour­
ages conversations between your brand and your audience while acting as 
the North Star to keep your messaging on track. The messaging map then 
leads into the development of a social media editorial calendar, where you 
and your team craft posts and tweets that can help you start, and continue, 
conversations in your social channels. Together, these tools keep you and 
your brand present, consistent, and engaged.
	
Rather than rehash PR messages, look for ways to be conversational, share 
valuable information, tell stories, and inspire followers to respond because 
what you’re saying in social networks is relevant to them. You can include 
marketing messages, but serve up more than commercials.
Developing a messaging map
Follow these steps to develop a social media messaging map:
	
1.	Describe your target market, audience, and tribe.
	
	 Specify who you’re trying to reach. Suppose that you’re a personal chef 
whose target is moms in their 40s. They’re working, they’re busy, they’re 
harried, and they want to save time — but they don’t want to sacrifice 
the health and needs of their families.

 Chapter 5: Demonstrating Your Online Presence to Maximize Engagement
	
2.	Break out the segments of your target audience.
	
	 Social networks have multilayered audiences. If they’re relevant to you, 
be sure to address them or at least acknowledge them. Vendors, the 
media, and other stakeholders are all separate categories, for example. If 
your main target is moms in their 40s, secondary targets might be their 
partners, women’s professional organizations, or websites and publications 
geared toward working moms and older moms.
	
3.	Get granular, by spelling out the demographics and psychographics of 
your core audiences.
	
	 Describe the market segments in detail. (What do they like? How do 
they spend their days? What are their personality characteristics?) A 
target mom in her 40s is likely a working mom who is juggling work and 
life issues, and who may be struggling with healthy eating and fitness or 
with not spending enough time taking care of herself. She is solutions-
oriented. She knows the ‘what’ when it comes to her problems, but 
struggles with the ‘how to fix it’ — this is where your brand enters with 
the answers.
	
4.	Identify the key interests of people in your market segments — the 
topics that resonate with them.
	
	 The typical mom in her 40s seeks bite-size content, a supportive commu­
nity, and time-saving tips, and she could use a little humor to brighten 
her day. She loves wine. She dreams of travel.
Taking a closer look at your target market is the first step in developing your 
social media messaging map.
	
Avoid making biased assumptions about your audience. You’re not trying to 
stereotype as you develop your social media messaging map. Instead, flesh 
out your version of the ideal customer. Ask questions every step of the way to 
get to know your audience better and to refine your messaging.
Crafting messages to achieve your goals
After you identify your audience and the topics they’re interested in, the next 
step in developing your social media messaging map is to craft some sample 
messaging, to refine its tone and wording. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Circle back to your goals.
	
	 Knowing and serving the audience is useful, but staying close to your 
goals is also important as you craft messages. To continue the example 
in the preceding section, suppose that you’re a personal chef targeting 
moms in their 40s. You want customers to hire you to prepare healthy, 
custom meals for themselves and their families. You also want satisfied 
customers to encourage their friends to hire you.

Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
	
2.	Establish what types of posts to use.
	
	 You can develop many types of messages based on the audience and on 
your goals. A mix of the following elements maintains fresh and relevant 
content: Announcements, Events, News, Special offers, Inspiration, and 
How to.
	
3.	Come up with specific topic themes for messages that serve both your 
audience and your goals.
	
	 Combine everything that you’ve already considered, and then get more 
creative. Review your message types to home in on content themes 
geared toward moms in their 40s, such as
	
a.	Announcements: This week’s menu
	
b.	Events: Healthy food and wine tasting
	
c.	News: Online articles about women and their health issues
	
d.	Special offers: Refer-a-friend discounts
	
e.	Inspiration: Inspiring quotes
	
f.	How to: Quick time-savers
	
4.	Craft sample messages geared toward each audience and goal.
	
a.	Announcements: Pinterest Menu Plan: 7 Meals in 30 Minutes or Less
	
b.	Events: Tweet: Join us for a Healthy food and wine tasting Thursday 
Evening from 6-8 (Include link to Facebook Event)
	
c.	News: Blog Post: 3 On-the-Go Breakfasts To Start Your Day Off Right 
(Can link from Facebook and Twitter)
	
d.	Special offers: VIP Refer-a-friend discounts for Facebook Friends only
	
e.	Inspiration: Quote: “Life is not merely being alive, but being well.” ~ 
Marcus Valerius Martialis
	
f.	How to: Video: Prepare healthy Snacks for your Kid’s Lunches (link 
on Blog, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest)
The content that results forms a grid specifying who you’re trying to reach and 
the types of messaging you’ll develop and post to reach them. Detail themes 
and topics that you’ll incorporate each week in order to show consistency.
When you’re consistent, your audience knows what to expect and becomes 
more inclined to participate. In fact, they’ll look forward to upcoming content. 
The sample messaging should indicate tone and voice, down to specific wording, 
as shown in the social media messaging map in Figure 5-3, which we created 
by using an Excel spreadsheet.

Tie your messaging to your goals. Flexibility (rather than rigidity) is impor­
tant, and being responsive to conversations in real-time is critical. Just don’t 
lose your overall focus.
A messaging map helps you build out a framework for an editorial calendar 
that includes specific types of messages — and the messages themselves. 
This calendar is the foundation of (and your guide to) communicating in your 
social networks.
Embracing the core themes of your social media messaging map gives you the 
perfect place to start when crafting the messages you share every day or week. 
Listening plays a major role in your daily engagement activities as well. Find a 
balance between marketing messages, responses, outreach, and interactions.
Developing a social media 
editorial calendar
Keeping up with the breakneck pace of social media can run you ragged. Is 
it time to tweet? Post to Google+? Pin a great-looking image? Publish a blog 
post? The social media editorial calendar is built on your goals and on the 
needs and desires of your audience. Working in tandem with the messaging 
map, the editorial calendar guides you to compose content that you’ll publish 
and share in your social networks, and some of this content can be scheduled.
We’re not recommending that you create formulaic or canned posts. We’re 
encouraging you to be strategic, remain on-message, and clearly focus so that 
your messaging is more effective. We’re giving you permission to schedule some 
messaging in advance to help alleviate the time pressures of being continually 
bound to your computer.

Experiment with easy-to-use and affordable social media management tools that 
let you schedule posts and tweets to a number of popular social networks, such 
as HootSuite, Buffer (http://bufferapp.com), and SproutSocial (www.
SproutSocial.com).
Creating a calendar
You can use a number of tools to develop an editorial calendar. Start simple 
with an Excel spreadsheet or, if you’re familiar with Google Docs (http://
docs.google.com), a Google spreadsheet (our favorite). Then you can 
easily share with others and collaborate. Another online shared option is 
Zoho Docs (https://www.zoho.com/docs).
Populating the calendar
Follow these steps to populate your social media editorial calendar:
	
1.	Create a quarterly (3-month) spreadsheet.
	
	 Adding more months to the spreadsheet can become unwieldy; using 
fewer than three months creates more documents to manage.
	
2.	Create weekly tabs to cover the months you’ve specified.
	
	 Give the tabs names to help you recognize the week, such as Dec10-16, 
Dec17-23, and so on.
	
3.	Make a Template tab for weekly messaging.
	
	This template serves as a baseline guide for subsequent weekly pages, 
to remind you of key topics and messaging.
	
4.	Add content columns.
	
	 Add these columns:
	
a.	Day/Date: The day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
and so on).
	
b.	Events: Online or offline events that also trigger messaging.
	
c.	Post Topic: Custom topics that you’ve created and types of posts 
that you’ve identified as interesting to your audience. In the exam­
ple above, Crafting messages to achieve your goals, you would dis­
tribute the following topics in this column (not all in a single day, 
but repeatable weekly):
	
		This week’s menu (every Monday)
	
		Healthy food and wine tasting (leading up to the event)
	
		Online articles about women and their health (one a day)
	
		Refer-a-friend discounts (a few times a week)

 Chapter 5: Demonstrating Your Online Presence to Maximize Engagement
	
		Inspiring quotes (one a day)
	
		Quick time-savers (one a day)
	
d.	Link: The location where you want to drive traffic. Most posts 
should have links — to your own content or to others’ content 
you’re sharing.
	
e.	Twitter/Facebook: Rows for precrafting a number of tweets per day 
and a spot for a post based on that day’s topic.
	
f.	Other Channels: Columns for additional channels as needed. Each 
channel has its own rhythm and content needs. If you’re publishing 
regular video, for example, add YouTube. If you’re trying to reach 
a more professional audience, add LinkedIn.
	
5.	Add repeatable messages to the Template tab.
	
	 These messages are vital to helping you achieve your goals, and they 
can be time sensitive, such as an upcoming or ongoing Hire Us event. 
Even if you’re repeating a message, revise the wording so that you don’t 
sound like a broken record. Also note how topics in the Post Topics 
column repeat weekly.
	
6.	Copy and paste the template into each week’s tab.
	
	Add the base template before filling in new content for each week so 
that you don’t accidentally paste over your work.
	
7.	Begin filling in the blanks with conversational messages.
	
	 Don’t rely solely on the core topics and messaging in your calendar. 
Come up with additional messaging that is complementary and relevant.
Managing the calendar
We recommend filling in the editorial calendar at least a week in advance. 
Repeatable topics and messaging can be carried out over weeks at a time. 
Evergreen content (or content that is always interesting to readers because 
it isn’t tied to a timeframe) can be moved around to accommodate more 
pressing messages. Look forward to what is happening, or to what you want 
to happen months from now. Keep holidays, special events, and seasons in 
mind if they affect your business.
	
Events that have fixed dates can immediately trigger messaging that leads up 
to the events and encourages people to register or to buy tickets. Craft this 
messaging as soon as you confirm the date, to ensure that they’re added to 
your calendar. Come up with 15 different ways to say, “Come to our event in 
September,” and then schedule those messages across your SME platforms 
during the weeks leading up to the event. This saves you from trying to 
remember every week and prompts your community to remember, purchase 
tickets if necessary, and then attend.

Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
Taking the time to plan strategically around the core content you will publish 
during the next few months or the next year supplies you with a roadmap. 
Stay flexible in order to adapt to your roadmap and improve it. Having a 
social media messaging map and a social media editorial calendar in hand 
gives you more of a framework for establishing your presence in your social 
media channels. These tools keep that presence consistent and fresh.
Over the past few years, we’ve developed a social media editorial calendar, 
in the form of a spreadsheet. You can access the starter template at http://
bit.ly/smesmcal. In Figure 5-4, you can see a section of a calendar that 
shows tweets and Facebook updates optimized for each social network.
	
Figure 5-4: 
A sample 
section of a 
social media 
editorial 
calendar.
	
Maintaining an editorial calendar for blog posts and campaigns is also useful.
	
Your community needs to hear from you in real-time. If you run your SME on 
autopilot, you risk turning off supporters and having them “unfollow” you. Use 
the calendar to plan ahead and to schedule some of your social media activity, 
but set time aside to regularly check in with fans and followers to reply to 
their queries, acknowledge their mentions, and engage with them. 
Setting a Schedule
Social media really never stops. You can jump into any of your channels at 
any time of the day or night and find others there, too. You can add a tweet, a 
+1, a repin, or a post at any time to reach someone.

 Chapter 5: Demonstrating Your Online Presence to Maximize Engagement
Just because you can do this, however, doesn’t mean that you should.
Scheduling helps you establish a consistent presence online while helping 
you to better manage your time as you communicate and engage online. Your 
community wants to know when they can expect to hear from you, and you 
want to have regular visibility in their streams at the times that make the 
most sense for them — and for you.
Determining how frequently to update
People don’t expect you to post around the clock, and — don’t worry — they 
certainly aren’t paying attention around the clock. Knowing when, and how 
often, to post requires some research and some observations as you engage.
Having an inconsistent social media presence is worse than having no pres­
ence. If your customers or prospects visit your Facebook Page or look you 
up on Twitter, only to find that you haven’t posted anything in the past year 
or so, they’ll likely think that you don’t care much about your social media 
customers.
After you’re using an editorial calendar and you have planned out portions 
of your social content, determine the best times of day for you to hop online 
to follow up. Plan to spend no more than 20 minutes at a time checking for 
replies, responding, and sending out in-the-moment messaging to drive 
engagement.
A fine line exists between updating too frequently and not often enough to 
make a blip on the busy radar of social networking.
	
To maintain a warm and attentive reception to your posts, share only relevant 
content that’s useful to the followers you’re trying to serve. Vet the content 
you post, especially if it originates from another source. Any content you pub­
lish or share should reflect your brand values. Providing value builds trust. 
See Chapter 4 for more on building trust so that the audience is receptive to 
your content.
Every social network is different in terms of how many posts per day is 
acceptable. Other variables in frequency include time zones and your goals. 
Given the many variables to posting frequency, Table 5-1 serves as a rough 
guideline. Modify these numbers based on your experiences over time.

If you’re focusing more heavily on one social network over another, increase 
your posting frequency over time on that network to best serve your audi­
ence and your goals. Posting three to five times on Facebook isn’t forbidden; 
however, it isn’t the best use of your time either. The people who have liked 
your page just may unlike you if you post too often.
	
No one can give you a single correct answer for how often to post. All the studies 
in the world are only snapshots of tiny segments of the online population, and 
they may not reflect what you know to be true about your own audience.
Figuring out the best times to engage
Many social media experts will tell you that the greatest level of engage­
ment on the four primary social platforms (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and 
Google+) occurs four times a day:
	
✓	First thing in the morning
	
✓	Lunch Time 
	
✓	Mid-afternoon
	
✓	Early evening
Other experts will tell you to avoid evenings and weekends, whereas others 
emphasize the benefit of posting during those times and days.
Knowing your audience tells you far more about the best days and times to 
post to your social channels than any report or expert’s opinion. If you’re

 Chapter 5: Demonstrating Your Online Presence to Maximize Engagement
reaching out to parents, determine whether they’re online and paying atten­
tion in the mornings while rushing to get their kids to school? On holidays 
when they’re traveling? At dinnertime?
You can find out more about your followers’ online habits over time by 
observing when they are more likely to respond. Shift the times on your 
posts until you hit the sweet spots. Ask followers what they prefer. Take a 
quick poll or survey specifically focused on their online habits and preferred 
destinations.
Depending on the time zone, it’s safe to say that most of the social channels 
where you’re trying to attract people’s attention will quiet down at night. 
This isn’t a hard-and-fast rule, but after you know the rhythms of your audi­
ence’s schedule, you’ll know when it’s safe to assume that people you’re 
trying to reach are asleep. We’re not suggesting that you discount someone 
with insomnia, but chances are good that your messages won’t generate the 
best outcomes at 3 a.m.
	
Base your posting timeframes more on your audience’s time zones than on 
your own if yours don’t match theirs. You might have to finagle your schedule; 
however, your goal is to reach the right people, not to put out well-crafted 
messages to the wrong audiences.
To get started, schedule your core messaging or arrange to be present in 
social media during “busy” times online:
	
✓	Early morning (7 to 9 a.m.): Many people quickly check in as they hurry 
themselves and their families out the door for the day.
	
✓	Lunchtime (11 a.m. to 1 p.m.): For people in the Midwest and on the east 
coast, it’s nearly lunchtime; on the west coast, it’s during the morning.
	
✓	Midafternoon (1 to 3 p.m.): An “after lunchtime” lull often occurs when 
people check in between tasks. Also, it’s lunchtime on the west coast.
	
✓	Early evening (7 to 9 p.m.): As people settle down after dinner on the 
east coast, west coast residents are winding down their day. If your 
target market is on the west coast, you can skip the first timeframe and 
add another one even later to tap into the post-dinner social networking 
surge for them.
If you find your audience engaging with you during the morning and midday, 
but you notice responses waning in the evening, make adjustments to your 
schedule. If you find the opposite to be true, adjust accordingly. Continue to 
be present whenever and wherever your community wants to see you.
	
If your audience is international, you have more schedule-finessing to do. 
Consider hiring an assistant closer to the time zones where your core audi­
ence is located to help present a live presence in your social media channels 
at the most suitable times.

Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
Deciding when to interact
How often you actively interact with followers can dictate your overall success 
with SME. A number of ways that you can interact are generally reactive or 
active. Here are some examples of reactive interaction:
	
✓	Respond to public messages directed at you, such as @mentions on 
Twitter or comments on your posts in Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, 
Google+, or other networks.
	
✓	Respond to direct or private messages, such as those on Facebook Page 
messages or direct messages (DMs) on Twitter.
	
✓	Respond to mentions that people make of you or your brand in social 
networks that you find via keyword or hashtag searches.
You can also interact more actively, by taking the initiative and reaching out 
to others, instead of waiting for them to mention or address you. Here are 
some active ways to interact:
	
✓	Share content from others such as retweets, repins, and post shares.
	
✓	Give kudos to others by linking directly to their content.
	
✓	Identify your target market or key influencers, follow them, and engage 
them in conversation.
Establish the best process for you by combining scheduled messaging and 
live responses with active engagement.
	
Don’t post the wrong content at the wrong time. Before you start posting live — 
or even if you have messages scheduled — take time to review topics being 
discussed, including trending topics, to avoid posting cheery content at the 
same moment that news is breaking of a natural disaster or national tragedy.
Replying to every greeting and query on your social media channels may seem 
impossible. Increased opportunities to engage with customers and prospects 
in social channels can be a good problem to have, but it may require that you 
ramp up resources to connect with others where they want to connect with you.
Social media engagement should be a fulfilling aspect of your online marketing 
efforts. Don’t plan every moment of every day. If you want to communicate and 
connect with someone, don’t be afraid to do it simply because it isn’t “on your 
calendar.”

Chapter 6
Creating Connections
In This Chapter
▶	Defining your short- and long-term goals
▶	Pinpointing your audience and how they behave online
▶	Giving your audience the floor
▶	Motivating the exchange of ideas between you and your audience
I

n this chapter, we tackle the importance of making contacts and con­
nections as part of your social media engagement (SME). With each new 
connection, you inch closer to reaching the place where you belong in this 
space. You want to be a part of the online community, not merely a company 
that people watch from afar, and you want your connections to produce truly 
positive outcomes.
The book you’re holding in your hands is one of many positive outcomes 
resulting from engaging in social media. Our own online connections and con­
versations on Twitter and Facebook led first to in-person meetings and then 
to our first joint book deal for Mom, Incorporated: A Guide to Business + Baby. 
If we weren’t active in social networks — cultivating real connections and 
building genuine relationships — this book deal (our second) would have 
never happened.
With every new engagement, you find not only what most interests and satis­
fies your audience but also how you can work with your audience for mutual 
benefit. Each time you engage online, you make your brand more accessible 
and available for something big to happen: real connections.
Starting with Your Connection Goals
Settle in and prepare to get your hands dirty. We know that we aren’t the first 
to preach that you should set goals and measure your progress. Establishing 
these goals determines not only where you’re going but also how to get there 
and who to take along for the ride. You’ve identified your audience and you 
know where they spend most of their time online. Now you need to draw 
more and more people into your conversations.

Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
The more vibrant your conversation, the more opportunities you create for 
yourself and your brand. We want you to set your SME goals, both short-term 
and long-term, so that your efforts to connect are grounded in a cohesive 
strategy with measurable outcomes.
Goals inspire you to shoot for the moon, to push past the limits of what you 
imagine you can accomplish, and to set reasonable milestones to track your 
progress. Plan to create at least two lists: short-term goals (the ones that you 
feel you can achieve more easily) and long-term goals (the ones that may 
seem slightly out of reach but that, with perseverance, can be reached).
	
Social media engagement focuses not on one-hit wonders but rather on a 
longer plan for interacting and connecting in order to continue the conversa­
tions and conversions. Your short-term goals should be to build toward your 
long-term goals.
Setting short-term goals
Align your short-term goals in social media engagement with your short-term 
business goals, as in these examples:
	
✓	Increase traffic to your website. You can achieve this goal within a few 
months of diligent engagement, and it can compel you to start leveraging 
your social media connections.
	
✓	Accelerate word-of-mouth communication. Though this method is a 
little more difficult to measure than web traffic, mentions that appear 
in social media — especially by social media influencers or people with 
larger or more loyal followings — can increase your brand exposure.
	
✓	Make specific actions happen. Whether you’re asking people to fill out 
a form or to sign up for a contest or attend an event, your connections 
should boost actions where you can see more immediate and tangible 
results.
Your goals, which are often reflected in your business plan and informed by 
your company’s mission statement, should infuse your presence online with 
purpose and define the way your company communicates and operates daily.

Here are some examples of measurable and achievable short-term goals to 
attract, build, and strengthen connections:
	
✓	Start an editorial calendar to produce more strategic content.
	
✓	Add a subscription form to your website, and when you reach 50 
subscribers, send a newsletter.
	
✓	Share your blog posts on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn to attract 
more attention.
	
✓	Create five new boards on Pinterest.
	
✓	Generate one or two Likes on every Facebook post.
	
✓	Produce a new video to upload to YouTube every week to attract atten­
tion and build your following.
Establishing longer-term goals
Start thinking about specific goals you want to set in order to push you, your 
brand, or your business into the next realm, as in these examples of longer-
term goals for your connections within the next six months:
	
✓	Increase traffic to your website by 50 percent.
	
✓	Receive five glowing reviews of your company in online forums.
	
✓	Double or triple the number of connections in your social media channel.
	
✓	Increase engagement in your social media channels by 10 percent.
	
✓	Increase revenue by 10 percent via direct referrals from Twitter and 
Facebook.
Set a specific time every quarter to assess your progress and (you hope) to 
celebrate wins.
If you’re reaching your long-term goals easily, head back to the drawing 
board and push harder. You should be working for your long-term goals, not 
merely resting on your haunches while watching the good ship of success 
sail into your harbor.
	
Saying thank you is powerful. As you reach goals, share your successes with 
your team. They deserve to know what they’ve done well — it motivates them 
to continue. The same is true for your audience: Let them celebrate your suc­
cess with you. Knowing that they have contributed by liking, commenting on, 
or sharing your content brings them back for more.

 Chapter 6: Creating Connections
Identifying Your Audience
After you determine that you want to create connections, labor over goal-
setting, and specify how you want your brand to evolve, you now know that 
you need the people — the audience — to make it happen. You need to find 
people who not only want to hear from you but also interact with your brand 
and share your brand messages with others.
Let’s do it together.
Determining who you’re trying to reach
Understanding who your audience is helps you find them online and deter­
mine the best ways to reach out to them to engage. If you sell kids’ sporting 
equipment, for example, you likely need an audience of coaches or parents 
(or both) who have young children. If you’re a florist wanting to specialize in 
weddings, your targets are likely brides and wedding planners. Recent sta­
tistics say that the average age of a bride in the United States is 25. Clearly, 
these audiences are unique.
Figuring out who you want to reach via your social media channels is a process 
that you may have already tackled while determining the target customers 
for your business. Use a combination of these factors to identify them:
	
✓	Demographics: Facts about individuals, including sex, age, education 
level, income level, and geographic location
	
✓	Psychographics: Psychological profile of people such as activities, 
actions, interests, behavior, attitudes, and values
	
✓	Online presence: Web locations where people have created platforms 
and are actively engaging with their own followings
Seek out the people who will be the most interested in your messages and 
content — the ones who are most likely to respond to you as you spend time 
engaging online.
Finding your audience online
Say that you sell kids’ sporting equipment, such as inline hockey skates and 
masks, sticks, aluminum bats, and catcher’s gear for baseball and also softball, 
football, and soccer cleats, goalie gloves — if a kid needs gear for sports,

Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
you sell it. You know you need to reach coaches and parents of young kids 
involved in sports. Here are some ways to find your audience, or (in marketing-
speak) your market segment:
	
✓	Search engines: Be specific about keywords and even geography. Search 
for kids sports in St. Louis, MO or coaches in St. Louis, MO or Parent, St. 
Louis. You’ll see sites and blogs to explore as well as forums, groups, and 
even people whose presence on social channels may be attracting your 
ideal audience. Coaches or even parents may have online presences that 
include their social media contact information listed right on their sites 
so that you can follow them on Twitter, for example, to establish an initial 
connection.
	
✓	Social media channels: Take advantage of search options on these 
channels at Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, and even Pinterest. 
Use a variety of keywords and keyword combinations such as sports, 
kids sports, sporting equipment, coach, kid coaching, and the names of 
individual sports or locations, such as St. Louis.
	
	The useful tool SocialBro (www.socialbro.com) can search the bios of 
people on Twitter and narrow them to specific locations. If someone is 
identified using the word coach in Missouri, for example, (and there are 
278 of them), the results may be people to connect with and reach out to.
	
✓	Online conversations: Seek out people who are talking about the topics 
that matter the most to you, such as kids and sports in St. Louis. Use a 
site such as Hashtags (www.hashtags.org) to search for people talk­
ing about St. Louis or individual sports or kids using particular hashtags.
Naturally, when you find all the “right” people, you still need to know more 
about them to determine whether a coach is the type you’re looking for and 
then see whether she is active online, and how she’s active, to identify your 
greatest opportunities for connecting.
Figuring out what your 
audience does online
Lace up your researching shoes. After you find your audience, you must 
determine what they’re doing with their time while they’re online, such as 
viewing images on Pinterest, quickly reading Facebook posts and clicking the 
Like button, or staying glued to job postings at LinkedIn. You need to know, 
for example, whether they would sit still to watch a 2-minute video or bolt 
after the first 15 seconds.
Research the activities of your audience
If your audience spends their time on Pinterest, check their Activity Feeds to 
see what topics catch their eye. If they’re active on Facebook but mostly skim 
www.Ebook777.com

111
 Chapter 6: Creating Connections
posts and click the Like button a few times, assess the topics they’re liking 
versus the ones they take the time to share. If someone is more active on 
LinkedIn, a more business-oriented approach makes sense. If they watch and 
share videos online, YouTube may be a source of valuable connections for you.
We often mention the importance of listening, yet it bears repeating: The 
people you want to reach will tell you — directly in their SME channels — 
where they are and what they’re doing. Whether they’re heading to the pool, 
coaching a Little League game, or shopping for a birthday gift, people are 
using their social networks to announce their day-to-day activities — often, 
for the whole world to see. These announcements can give you greater 
insight into your target audience.
All the updating and sharing that people do online tells you something about 
your audience — what interests them and where you can find them. You 
certainly can’t be everywhere, every day, but you can begin to narrow down 
the number of spots where they update, the times of day that they’re online, 
and the topics that truly interest them. With this information, you can create 
better connections.
	
Connecting is about people, not about software or applications. Take the 
time to read people’s bios and profiles and approach them to connect with 
no expectations or demands. Your technique — kindness, attentiveness, and 
interest — matters more in terms of your SME than the tools you use.
	
Use a personal account to research social networks where brands and compa­
nies have more limited views. Perusing only your own, personal connections 
can give you insights into how people who may fit your target audience are 
using social networks. And your personal contacts can also be some of your 
first connections as you spread the word about your business.
Use analytics tools
Use the free tools provided by Google Analytics as your guide to identify 
where your audience was online immediately before visiting your website or 
blog. This is a decent indicator of what they do online and which sources or 
platforms they trust to guide them to new content.
An alternative would be a site like Sumall.com (www.sumall.com), where all 
the math is done for you. You can view your daily, weekly, or monthly stats 
with only a few clicks — allowing you to track sales, your social media activi­
ties, and any trends. You can also have this data sent right to you. Sumall 
offers a free plan as well as paid versions.
Knowing that people come to your site from Facebook, Twitter, or Pinterest 
helps you to target your efforts to make connections. Track your analytics to 
see whether engaging on the appropriate networks drives even more traffic 
your way.

Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
Ask questions — and listen to the answers
Ask your current followers to keep you updated on what they’re doing or 
to gauge their interest in your products and services. Then listen to their 
responses to find ways to increase your connections with them by engaging 
in more interesting and relevant ways.
Creating a Space for Engagement
Building and cultivating a space built specifically for the purpose of engagement 
establishes you as a leader in your field. Your audience will grow to know 
your platforms are the place to go for quality dialogue, as well as a diversity 
of opinions.
Nurturing this type of open conversation requires your presence and your 
willingness to monitor the chatter for quality. In some cases, you can just ask 
for what you want, to encourage the interactions to happen. At other times, 
you must nurture the environment for the conversations to take place. Either 
way, be proactive and make things happen — don’t build your social network 
profiles and expect people to connect simply because you’re there.
Setting ground rules for participation
When you start conversations in any of your social media channels, especially 
when asking for opinions, you should also moderate the responses — pay 
attention, keep the conversations on topic, and join in whenever relevant. 
You should also supervise the conversations and remove any inappropriate 
material.
Set ground rules for people who are participating in your online community, 
to maintain positive and appropriate conversation topics. (See more about 
managing online communities apart from social networks in Chapter 8.)
Offering a forum for opinions
Knowing what your audience thinks, how they feel, and what motivates 
their daily activity helps you better serve them as well as convert them into 
customers and evangelists for your brand. Your social media channels are 
forums where you can interact with your audience and glean insights into 
their behaviors as consumers. You see what they think of your brand and 
help them connect with other like-minded individuals.

 Chapter 6: Creating Connections
The easiest way to dip your toes into community engagement is to ask people 
for their opinions. You can always get people talking if you give them the 
floor. People can be quite opinionated, so soliciting their thoughts can start 
the conversation.
Though you want people to give specific opinions about your business, you 
need to build both momentum and trust so that they feel comfortable telling 
you what they think and feel. Explore these opinion-based topics for starters:
	
✓	Noncontroversial current events: If you own a jewelry store, ask peo­
ple’s opinions on Valentine’s Day of the most romantic date for the occa­
sion or the most romantic way to propose. Eventually, the conversation 
can turn to jewelry as a natural progression originating from the commu­
nity rather than from you.
	
✓	Charitable causes: If you sell baby clothing, share a positive news article 
about an organization that distributes donated baby clothes to families 
in need. Ask people for their thoughts on this cause and what they might 
have in their own attics collecting dust that they would be willing to give 
to a similar local cause. Then your whole community can rally behind 
some good news and dedicated efforts in your company’s name.
	
✓	Ways to help others: If you offer math tutoring, ask your community for 
their best math tips, how to multiply or work with fractions. People love 
to show off what they know, and they can gain useful knowledge from 
their peers. Contribute to the conversation yourself and demonstrate your 
expertise, or compile the tips in a PDF file — giving everyone credit — 
to share for free with your community.
Look for ways that you can start and guide conversations to encourage 
participation and give and receive value from those interactions. Soliciting 
opinions is a helpful way to start.
	
A quick and easy way to solicit opinions is to ask questions in a poll. You 
can use various applications within social networks, such as polling apps in 
Facebook or LinkedIn Groups or polling apps from SurveyMonkey (http://
surveymonkey.com), Polldaddy (http://polldaddy.com), Wufoo 
(http://wufoo.com), and Pollcode (http://pollcode.com). Post poll 
results to keep the conversations going.
Showcasing what others know and do
You know what’s amazing? Building a community where people can share 
ideas to make everyone better, smarter, and more informed. Doing this 
requires more than simply publishing your content, however.

Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
We mention elsewhere that you need to talk about more than your company 
or the products and services that you’re trying to sell in social networks. 
Your SME efforts need to be about others, not just you.
You can showcase others as a meaningful part of your messaging and social 
media publishing and interactions in many ways:
	
✓	Interview people for your website, blog, or social channels.
	
✓	Solicit guest posts from your audience and partners.
	
✓	Highlight other people’s work.
	
✓	Praise and celebrate people’s achievements.
	
✓	Promote other people’s products or services that are compatible with 
yours.
	
✓	Share other people’s expertise with your following, giving those experts 
full credit.
Cultivate an online community where you give credit where credit is due, 
where you promote and recognize your community members, and where you 
generously devote part of your online messaging and content to showcase 
others.
	
When you behave generously and kindly in social networks, you’ll be 
rewarded with more likes, more follows, and more shares. People are more 
likely to gravitate toward brands that realize SME is more than a one-way 
street and that a person’s followers and connections have a treasure trove of 
stories worth sharing.
Getting the Engagement Ball Rolling 
Let’s be honest: Engagement isn’t exactly happening unless you create the 
atmosphere and then actually get the ball rolling. Initially, you’re talking, 
tweeting, podcasting, posting on Facebook, or adding people to your circle of 
friends on Google+, and you may only see a whisper or an echo in response, 
but it is your job to encourage your audience to reply. In order to create the 
valuable connections that lead to opportunities and success, you need for 
your audience to truly respond.
And for that, you often need to begin by asking.

 Chapter 6: Creating Connections
Asking for action
You’ve undoubtedly been told that you have to ask for what you want. The 
author and motivational speaker Shakti Gawain is quoted as saying, “You 
create your opportunities by asking for them.” She’s right.
You may think that you want more fans, more followers, more likes, more 
pins, more comments, or more shares. Yes, you want more engagement. But 
what you really want is to make connections and build relationships and then 
turn those relationships into mutually beneficial exchanges. You start by 
asking for connections.
Depending on the social network you’re using, you can boost connections by 
asking people to take various actions on your behalf:
	
✓	Like your Facebook Page or follow your brand: Spell out what connect­
ing with you provides, or offer an incentive.
	
✓	Encourage their own connections to connect with you: Offer an incen­
tive for people to invite their friends to connect, but also be valuable, 
useful, helpful, and interesting enough that people will want to spread 
the word.
	
✓	Like a post: Craft likeable content, and every now and then, request a 
‘like’ within your actual post. Don’t overdo it.
	
✓	Share or retweet your content so that you can make more connec­
tions: Post content worth sharing, but also ask others to share specific 
content strategically when it matters most.
In Chapter 8, we talk about increasing your e-mail sign-ups and prompting 
your subscribers to become fans. This happens, in large part, because you’re 
asking and encouraging them to do so. Every social network and online mar­
keting tool can be used to build your overall social media connections. Look 
for ways to cross-promote your social media channels.
On Facebook, you can ask your fans to follow you on Twitter to receive 
more frequent updates. On Twitter, you can ask followers to also like your 
Fan Page in order to receive more in-depth posts and special offers. On 
YouTube, you can add annotations to individual videos saying “Subscribe to 
my channel” or asking for a thumbs-up. Figure 6-3 shows how Danielle uses 
annotations regularly on her videos to encourage engagement. She asks for 
connections or actions, such as giving a thumbs-up at a specific point.
	
You risk alienating your current connections if you go overboard with 
requests. There’s a fine line between regularly asking people to follow you and 
asking so often that people become annoyed and start ignoring you.

Figure 6-3: 
Danielle 
adds anno-
tations to 
her videos.
	
	
You may make a request for a connection and fail to follow through by 
responding when your audience reaches out. For example, if your Facebook 
fans follow you on Twitter and then you miss the opportunity to interact with 
them there, you’ve just blown it — you’ve asked them to do something with­
out holding up your end of the deal. Don’t ask if you can’t follow through when 
people comply and connect.
Be clear about wanting people to connect with you. Show them, tell them, 
guide them, virtually hold their hands, walk them to your Like button and 
say “Click here.” Be direct, but also be creative, fun, and spontaneous. Create 
excitement.
Offering rewards for action
The photo-printing company Shutterfly wants more people to like its 
Facebook Fan Page, so it blatantly offers a surprise incentive to encourage 
people to connect, as shown in Figure 6-4.
Everyone who likes the Shutterfly page receives a special code for a free (not 
discount) product when they use the photo service — which may have con­
tributed to the site gaining more than a million Likes.
In addition to engaging regularly on its page to demonstrate attention and 
interest, Shutterfly is increasing connections with its audience by overtly tell­
ing people what they want — a Like — then thanking them for doing so with a 
special gift. Incentives can do wonders to increase connections.

Handling negative feedback
When you give people a platform to express themselves and share their opin­
ions, you may not always receive in return the positive feedback you want. 
Some people may be true fans, but others will see the platform as a place to 
air their grievances. Be prepared.
Providing a platform where everyone can express themselves comes with 
great responsibility. You must pay attention and be responsive. As we say 
repeatedly, any “bad” feedback is an opportunity to turn a negative into a 
positive.
Someone who has had a horrible experience at your restaurant and wants to 
share their thoughts will do so with or without you, in social media channels 
that you can control (ideally), such as on Facebook or in a LinkedIn Group 
or in other places where you have no control, such as a Twitter feed or 
Pinterest stream. We encourage you to continue asking for people’s opinions, 
even if you risk hearing information that’s difficult to accept.
	
You can’t solve every problem, and you can’t make everyone happy. But you 
can try. Make your best effort to address concerns expressed in social networks.

Seizing opportunities to do good
On Friday, December 14, 2012, the online and 
offline world held its collective breath as news of a 
tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut, trickled out. The 
senseless loss of 20 small children and six adults 
devastated a community, a nation, and the world, 
and many people learned of the details by way of 
moment-by-moment posts on social networks. 
The pain that everyone felt was expressed repeat­
edly on Twitter, Facebook, and other sites. People 
wanted to do something to help, but felt helpless. 
The weekend following the tragedy, one attentive 
and caring brand did something, and it all began in 
social networks.
Blogger Victoria Haller lost her six-year-old 
nephew, Noah Pozner, in the Sandy Hook school 
massacre. Noah’s funeral was held the Monday 
after the tragedy, and Victoria’s family wasn’t able 
to attend. The family had hand-written letters, 
including some from Victoria’s children — Noah’s 
cousins — that they and Noah’s parents wanted 
buried with the child. Victoria tweeted to JetBlue 
and another airline for help delivering the letters 
from her home in Washington state to Connecticut 
in time for the funeral. JetBlue responded imme­
diately and made it happen, flying the letters from 
Seattle to New York and then to Connecticut.
See the exchange between Haller and JetBlue in 
the figure. In the same exchange, JetBlue actively 
and sensitively responded to Victoria as well as to 
feedback from other people online. This quick and 
thoughtful action on the part of JetBlue created a 
moment, initiated by the brand, that many people 
will remember. JetBlue didn’t have to help. They 
didn’t have to respond when Victoria sent them 
a tweet. And yet they did. They took their online 
presence and created a meaningful, lasting con­
nection that reverberated throughout social net­
works and even in the press.

 Chapter 6: Creating Connections
Whenever you’re confronted with negative feedback, follow these steps:
	
1.	Review the context.
	
	When you see a negative comment, dig a little deeper to make sure that 
you understand what’s being said and why. Read conversation threads, 
and conduct searches on search engines to see whether you can find 
additional, related conversations.
	
2.	Acknowledge the feedback.
	
	After you gain a sense of the emotion — and the facts — behind a com­
plaint, address these issues in your response. Use acknowledgment 
statements such as “I understand your frustration” or “We realize that 
this situation is stressful.” Validate the other person’s feelings and per­
ceptions whether or not they’re accurate or shared by you.
	
3.	Address the issue promptly.
	
	Timeliness is essential when you’re handling and defusing negativity 
online. Every day, hour, or minute that you spend agonizing over your 
next action is valuable time wasted.
	
4.	Apologize.
	
	 When people are unhappy, a simple “I’m sorry” can do wonders to calm 
them. Even if you clarify the statement by saying, “I’m sorry that you feel 
that way — how can we help?” you’re showing that you care how they 
feel without admitting blame when it might not be your fault. Of course, 
if you’re at fault, admitting it is also important.
	
	If you’re upset, nervous, worried, or shocked or you’re experiencing any 
natural human emotions, gather your courage and express it in your 
response. People don’t want to hear overproduced, formulaic, or canned 
replies to their concerns.
	
5.	Share the feedback with your community.
	
	Explain what you’re doing every step of the way so that people see prog­
ress. Keep in mind, that the person complaining or venting isn’t the only 
one who sees what you have to say. The rest of your online community 
does, too.
Think of ways to go “above and beyond” 
because it’s the right thing to do, not because it 
will win you points in your social media engage­
ment. Using your social networks to find oppor­
tunities to help or give back or otherwise shine, 
with no expectation of acknowledgement or 
reward, can make the difference between run-
of-the-mill and superior engagement.
Remember: Avoid jumping on a tragedy in the 
news in an obvious, self-serving way — or be 
prepared for a damaging backlash. Pay atten­
tion, be sensitive, and never try to capitalize on 
trending topics inappropriately.

Some people complain simply because they want to be heard. Even using the 
phrase “We hear you” can diffuse anger when they realize that someone from 
your company is listening and responding.
	
When confronted with negativity about your brand online, you have the 
chance to respond in front of everyone who is listening. Your entire online 
community, and the public at large, potentially have a front-row seat to 
observe how you listen, clarify what happened, and apologize.

Driving Interaction
In This Chapter
▶	Laying the groundwork for interacting
▶	Adopting trending topics as conversation starters
▶	Advocating humor as a means of engagement
▶	Providing incentive for sharing
I

n earlier chapters of this book, we tell you how to help your brand build 
trust, maintain a social presence, and create connections as the core 
elements of social media engagement (SME). You can use a combination of 
these elements to then drive interaction, which is the topic of this chapter.
On the surface, as we initially discuss in Chapter 1, SME consists of reac­
tions, interactions, and actions. A reaction is a fan’s quick-and-easy response 
to the content you share by way of social media, such as liking and favorit­
ing. Interaction, which is ongoing (ideally), is the daily, back-and-forth com­
munication between you and the members of your online community, your 
customers and prospects, and even the public at large, if you cast a wide 
net. Interaction isn’t only the icing on the cake — it is the cake. An action — 
which requires the most effort on the part of your audience — is a definitive 
activity that takes place, such as when someone signs an online petition, fills 
out a survey, requests information, or buys a product. 
In this chapter, we tackle the icing and the cake: the actions that your com­
munity takes daily and then how to make interaction happen, how to inspire 
members to continue participating, and how to inspire your community to 
start that level of engagement with you.

Creating the Setting to 
Stimulate Engagement
Social media engagement is a continuous process of being present, connect­
ing, and sparking conversations. Everything you do at first sets the stage 
for meaningful interaction with your community that in turn leads them to 
action.
When you prepare your social media engagement strategies, and follow 
through on them, you’re setting the stage for — and then becoming an inte­
gral part of — the action, reaction, and interaction that follows. Engaging is a 
give-and-take proposition: It’s one part proactive and one part reactive, with 
a healthy dollop of heart and soul. You may be representing your company, 
but you’re a human being, even behind the brand and logo. To want to make 
the choice to engage, your community must feel a level of comfort with you. 
For them, it’s a choice — help them make the right one.
Moving past the what’s-in-
it-for-me? mentality
No one likes the person at the party who can’t stop talking about himself. 
One great temptation that you may have to work to overcome is the compul­
sion to share your product obsessively. Avoid the hard sell. Resist the urge 
to talk about “me-me-me.” Keep in mind that you do in fact have a product or 
service that you want people to buy: It’s you. Every time you push your ser­
vices or focus solely on your products (rather than on your community) or 
even forget about your audience entirely, you lose.
Social media is first and foremost social. Your fans on Facebook, for example, 
want to know that you’re more than a logo. The people following you on 
Pinterest want to see in your pins what you like, not simply your own prod­
ucts. On Google+, your community shares your content because they like 
what you have to say, not because they want to help you sell something. (We 
cover these three platforms in Chapters 9, 11, and 13, respectively.)
	
Eighty percent of the content you share as you engage on your social media 
platforms should showcase your personality, share other people’s contribu­
tion, or highlight content that you think your audience would find valuable. 
Reserve the remaining 20 percent for links to your own content.

 Chapter 7: Driving Interaction
Building a space where 
people feel comfortable
Consider the places you feel most at home, where you can kick your feet up, 
say what you mean, and mean what you say. These social media platforms or 
forums may help you experience a certain level of comfort knowing that you 
can speak your mind without judgment and feel that you’re valued.
Whether you’re creating a community on Facebook, responding to tweets on 
Twitter, or chatting with your circles on Google+, look to build a space that 
feels comfortable for your audience. Create a place where everyone can be
	
✓	Heard: Let people know that you’re listening and that you hear what 
they have to say. An environment that encourages open dialogue, 
answers questions, and offers valuable information creates a certain 
level of comfort.
	
✓	Human: Knowing that the live humans who are behind the brand care 
about the community matters to your supporters. Whether you’re 
chatting and answering questions, offering VIP incentives (described 
later in this chapter, in the section “Providing Additional Incentives for 
Sharing”), or responding to frustration, your audience wants to know 
that you have emotions as well.
	
✓	Humble: On any social platform that your brand manages, you have the 
opportunity to talk about any topic you want. Choose to make the topics 
of conversation more about your community than about you. Your fans 
will be honored that you focus on them, and they’ll be pleased that you 
avoid hard-sell tactics.
Certainly, it’s impossible to reach a level of perfection with everyone, but you 
should aim to create an environment that elicits enough comfort to encourage 
engagement.
	
A simple tip for getting your work shared beyond your current social media 
engagement platforms is this: Ask. Is it possible that getting people to share 
your message is simpler than you imagine? Engaging has always required 
strategy, planning, plotting, and reassessing, but sometimes, simply asking 
people to share, repost, retweet, or reblog prompts them to take that action.

Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
Inspiring others to pay attention and care
The social media landscape is chock-full of people, brands, and businesses 
vying for attention. Everyone wants a slice of the pie. The challenge lies in 
attracting the level of attention you want without having to take to the sky, 
for example, with a message banner trailing an airborne biplane. (Even 
using that method, you would have to persuade people to point their noses 
skyward — and away from their mobile devices!)
Your next steps are to do all the little things, which we describe in this list, 
that encourage your audience to engage with your content because it matters 
to them:
	
✓	Provide quality content. We can’t stress this point enough: Everything 
that you post online, on any of your platforms, must appropriately 
reflect your brand. If you provide thoughtful links, blog posts, and 
tweets, fans gravitate to you. Become known in your market as the go-to 
person or brand for useful and relevant information.
	
✓	Stimulate conversation. Ask interesting questions. Share funny stories. 
Inspire your community to contemplate a topic. To encourage dialogue, 
initiate a conversation — rather than send link after link into the wide 
open social media space. A compelling question or idea can motivate 
your community members to respond; a lonely link can turn them away 
from the conversation.
	
✓	Maintain visibility. The more present you are online, the more easily 
others can communicate with you regularly. If your community sees 
you and follows you on multiple platforms, and sees the quality content 
you’ve shared, they’re more likely — and able — to engage with you.
	
✓	Know when silence is golden. This statement may seem to be a direct 
contradiction of our advice in the second paragraph in this list, but 
it isn’t. We simply mean that you have to recognize when enough is 
enough. Don’t clog your platforms with unnecessary ramblings. Make 
every post, tweet, and video count. Your audience doesn’t need to be 
bombarded by news of every move that your brand makes or every 
meal that you’re consuming — unless those events properly reflect your 
brand. Trying to keep up with too much information can overwhelm 
your community, and rather than pay attention, they might even tune 
you out.
	
✓	Remember that kindness is king. This is important: Share relevant 
material from other people whom you trust and admire. Then not only 
do you strengthen relationships with others by praising them but your 
community also appreciates hearing this information from you — and 
you build your following in the process.

 Chapter 7: Driving Interaction
	
✓	Emphasize your brand. If your brand has a unique characteristic, 
embrace it. If your brand contributes to a particular cause, talk about it. 
If a popular celebrity wears your brand’s clothes, for example, show that 
person in a video. As shown in Figure 7-1, the soccer superstar David 
Beckham was featured in a video that the clothing store H&M released 
on Google+ (to much approval from the brand’s fans). Whether you 
create makeup tutorials, answer tax questions in early April, or special­
ize in dog training, embrace what you do well — and in your own way.

Starting Conversations
With the goal of inspiring dialogue as a starting point, consider the ways 
that you might strike up a conversation with a stranger at a party. You 
certainly wouldn’t walk up with your business card in your outstretched 
hand. You wouldn’t shout, begin the conversation with a monologue about 
your achievements in business, or say hello and then walk away — not if you 
hoped that the person would ever respond to you and interact with you.
Conversations about you happen online whether you’re there or not. Your 
goal is to be a part of them, by listening, starting related conversations, 
joining others, and doing so appropriately. Knowing what to talk about can 
be half the battle.

Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
Tapping in to trending topics
Finding universal themes that resonate with your audience can start the 
conversation. Current events and trending topics make for interesting fodder 
for dialogue with your community and fans. Be thoughtful in the way you 
discuss major world or national events when you engage online, and look for 
common ground with your audience to strengthen your connections.
	
Don’t talk about current events gratuitously, expect publicity, or turn your 
expressions of concern or support into sales pitches. Be sincere and use good 
taste when you start speaking about sensitive topics online. Keep the sales 
pitches separate lest you become considered both insensitive and opportunistic.
During the October 2012 disaster of Hurricane Sandy — a topic that was 
on everyone’s minds and trending on every social network — many brands 
punctuated their traditional platform messaging with thoughts and prayers 
and offers of assistance for people on the East Coast who were struggling. 
Delta Airlines, for example, offered condolences by way of its Twitter account 
to those affected by the storm, and it continued to respond to its community 
members who had questions about flights in the wake of the storm, as shown 
in Figure 7-2.
Trending topics can inspire creativity as you carry on conversations in your 
social media platforms. For example, February 22 is National Margarita Day. 
Who knew? But National Margarita Day was then a trending topic for two 
days in a row in 2013. For many businesses — restaurants, in particular — 
using the word margarita in their messaging helped make their message more 
visible.
	
Ask yourself: What are people talking about right now? Then join the conver­
sation — but only if it’s a fit for your brand. If it happens to be a particularly 
slow news day or you determine that the trending topics are too controversial 
or not reflective of your brand, head to Google Trends (www.google.com/
trends) to see what other topics are trending online.
Lighting a fire with hot-button issues
If you want to light a communication spark, tackle the truly hot-button issues 
of any given day. But be prepared for potential backlash, and above all, make 
sure that these topics align with the image of your brand.
If you decide to wade into the waters of politics, religion, or culture, you will 
most certainly see some responses. Not everyone will agree with you, and 
some may even be negative and unkind. If your brand wants to side with a 
political candidate, express an opinion about the resignation of a church or

 Chapter 7: Driving Interaction
government official, or take a stand on gun control, women’s rights, or same-
sex marriage, you will see a divide in your community. Some will staunchly 
support you, and others will fall away, unfollow, unsubscribe, or unlike.
	
Figure 7-2: 
The Delta 
Twitter 
feed, during 
Hurricane 
Sandy.
	
After you initiate a controversial conversation, follow these guidelines as you 
continue to engage:
	
✓	Stick to clearly worded statements. For example, rather than post an 
editorial opinion about a politician’s platform and stance on individual 
issues, you can make a positive, supportive statement that leaves no 
room for interpretation, like this: “Starwood Groceries is proud to sup­
port Gina Wonders for state senator, and we look forward to a bright 
future.”

128
Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
	
✓	Avoid insults. Insulting someone is never good form, especially in a 
public arena like social media. Doing so on hot topics invites a reverse 
attack. Yes, you want to start a conversation, but you don’t want to 
bring in the wolves.
	
✓	Refuse to argue. By engaging on a hot-button issue, some people will 
view your statements not as the beginning of a dialogue, but rather as 
an opportunity to start an argument. It’s you versus them. You may find 
yourself on the receiving end of an attack. Especially in social media, an 
argument can easily escalate rapidly. Walk away instead. The potential 
for damage to your reputation isn’t worth it.
	
✓	Accept differences of opinion. Recognize that not everyone will agree 
with you — that’s just fine. By opening the door to engage on a touchy 
subject, you’re inviting people to have an opinion about your opinion. 
Some will love you more for it, and others will decide that it isn’t their 
style. There’s no right or wrong. It’s perfectly acceptable for you and 
your audience to occasionally stand on different sides of the aisle.
	
You and the individuals who represent your brand should be careful to avoid 
sharing personal opinions about hot-button issues on company time. Be espe­
cially careful not to express personal opinions while using company accounts. 
Every tweet or post that’s shared from a company account is a direct reflec­
tion of your overall brand, and missteps can negatively affect your business.
Turning to humor
You like to laugh, and so do your fans. In an oversaturated social media 
world, humor stands out. The videos that make you laugh are almost always 
the ones with millions of views. The beautiful thing about making your cus­
tomers smile and laugh is that you grab their attention without spending a 
penny.
On December 12, 2012, Facebook, Google+, and Twitter feeds alike were inun­
dated with posts about the uniqueness of the day December 12, 2012 (12-12-
12). The monotony of the “12 posts” on every social network was broken by 
the good people at Sesame Street, with humor and a flashback to childhood, 
as shown in Figure 7-3. Well played, Sesame Street, well played.
In an example of the beauty of one brand responding to another brand with 
a solid sense of humor (rather than with snark), AMC Theatres commented 
on a tweet from Oreo about sneaking its version of the perfect snack into a 
movie theater. The response from AMC, shown in Figure 7-4, was nothing 
short of perfection.
You can’t help but smile as you read AMC’s response tweet to Oreo. That’s 
what humor does: It makes the brand — both of them, in fact — relatable.

When choosing humor as a means of sparking conversation, follow these 
suggestions:
	
✓	Be consistent with your brand. Ensure that your sense of humor 
matches the perception of your brand. Whether you’re trying to elicit a 
loud guffaw or a quiet giggle, it needs to match who you are as a com­
pany. If slapstick humor isn’t your forté, aim for a milder effect.
	
✓	Keep it clean. Witty humor is priceless. Tacky humor is worthless. You 
know which category you would rather be in.
	
✓	Avoid highly sensitive topics. Take race, gender, politics, and other 
possibly inflammatory topics off the table. Entertain your community 
and make them laugh rather than offend them. Running the risk of caus­
ing outrage with risky humor isn’t worth your time or trouble. (For 
details on broaching hot-button topics safely, refer to “Lighting a fire 
with hot-button issues,” earlier in this chapter.)

Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
	
✓	Use humor sparingly. Funny is wonderful, in fact, it’s brilliant, but you 
don’t need to be funny all the time. Well-placed humor that happens 
occasionally is enough to stimulate successful engagement with your 
community. Attempting humor daily can fall flat if you don’t have the 
talent to sustain it.

Building engagement by 
way of inspiration
To help your community to move from their initial reactions of liking, pin­
ning, and favoriting your content to a greater commitment, motivate them 
to engage with you on a deeper level by commenting, sharing, acting, or 
purchasing. To make this happen, you need to reach them via an emotional 
connection by tapping into trending topics or hot-button issues or turning to 
humor. 
Excitement, surprise, gratitude, laughter, and heartfelt sympathy can all 
move your community to act. Every time they share a post on Google+,

LinkedIn, or Facebook, comment on your blog, or retweet a tweet on Twitter, 
they’re giving their own, personal stamp of approval to you and your brand. 
That’s your goal.
In February 2013, Blood: Water Mission, a nonprofit organization with the 
goal of overcoming the HIV/AIDS and water crisis in Africa, began the 40 Day 
Water project, looking to inspire people online to drink only water between 
February 13 and March 30. The idea behind the project was to donate to 
the project the money saved by forgoing coffee, soda, wine, beer, and other 
drink options to help build wells in Uganda. The group made use of blogs, 
Facebook, and Twitter to share its goals and thank participants, as shown 
in Figure 7-5. By sharing an inspiring message, it aimed to involve more and 
more people in its campaign, tapping into people’s desire to do good deeds.

Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
Providing Additional Incentives 
for Sharing
Staying in touch with the human side of social media engagement keeps you 
grounded in providing value to other people and helps you determine the 
incentives you should offer to motivate your community to share. We’re not 
here to dictate to you what’s valuable, though we urge you to create and 
share content that you believe is of value.
Knowing what’s valuable to your audience starts with knowing your audi­
ence. We say it often: “Know your business goals, and know your audience.” 
What’s valuable to one community won’t necessarily be valuable to another, 
and vice versa.
To determine value, consider these factors:
	
✓	What your target market does online: Observe the people that you’re 
trying to reach — to see what they talk about and what they share — to 
understand their behavior and preferences. Do they prefer humor or 
human-interest stories that tug at the heartstrings? Do they publish con­
tent themselves or report it from other sources? Observation is a first 
step toward understanding.
	
✓	Reactions from your community: If you already have a following, ask 
questions not simply to get a reaction but to truly learn more about 
them. Gauging how you’re doing regularly helps you determine your 
next step.
	
✓	What best conveys your brand image: No doubt about it, you want your 
brand to be known for giving 100 percent effort, for listening carefully, 
and for providing quality customer service. Consider the qualities that 
are important to you and your brand — make sure that they’re front and 
center with every interaction in the online space. Allow these qualities 
to guide you in incentivizing your audience to engage with you.
	
✓	The actions you’re trying to make happen: For example, is your ulti­
mate goal to increase your fan base, to get people to start talking, to 
send traffic to your blog, to sell a service, or to encourage your commu­
nity to purchase a product? Knowing your goal helps you decide what 
your incentive should be.
	
Watch how your target market acts on your competitor’s Facebook page or 
on Twitter or any other social network when they aren’t interacting with you. 
See what your competitors do well to stimulate interaction. Always stay true 
to your own brand, mission, vision, and goals; however, don’t engage online 
in a vacuum. Adopt and adapt best practices that you observe when they’re 
relevant to your brand.

Offering freebies and discounts
Every social media engagement platform is a place where you can offer some­
thing special to each and every one of your fans: VIP status. By choosing to 
engage with you on Pinterest, Google+, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or even 
Instagram, your audience raises a hand to say, “I like you, and I want to know 
more about you.”
By connecting with you and following you in social networks, people are 
hoping for the inside scoop, for news that the average person doesn’t see, 
and for discounts or coupons like the one you see on the Sephora Google+ 
page, as shown in Figure 7-6.

Holding contests and sweepstakes
According to a recent online survey, a whopping 79 percent of Facebook fans 
are more likely to purchase from a brand they have already liked. So it’s no 
wonder that brands are making a concentrated effort to hold on to their 
audience.

Free ebooks ==>   www.Ebook777.com
134
Part II: Exploring the Elements of Social Media Engagement 
One of the best ways is to entice people to your page is by offering this type 
of discount or even to run a contest or sweepstakes to keep them engaged 
and coming back. Though contests or sweepstakes can be run on any social 
network, they do especially well on Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest. 
Before you set about holding one, ask questions to determine your goals: Are 
you looking to increase engagement with your current fans, grow your com­
munity, showcase a new product, or simply deepen brand awareness?
Following the laws and guidelines
This list describes a few legal and technical aspects to consider as you plan a 
contest or sweepstakes:
	
✓	Know the law. Know the difference between contests and sweepstakes. 
Every state has different laws specifying the types of contests you can 
run, even on the Internet, and these laws are handled by the attorney 
general’s office in each state. For example, if you hold a sweepstakes, 
you cannot ask contestants to do anything else, such as submit a photo­
graph as a critical part of entering to win — you submit a photograph to 
be judged in a contest.
	
	Be very careful about mixing random drawings with judged contests and 
vice versa. We aren’t lawyers, so we encourage you to check with yours 
before holding contests or sweepstakes online.
	
✓	Remember the rules. Whatever platform you choose, you must know the 
rules specifically about running contests. Are you allowed to hold them 
on the network? Can you announce your winner on your page when the 
contest ends? The Facebook terms of service, for example, state that 
you cannot hold contests on your page and that you must use a third-
party application to house your contest elements. Do not jeopardize 
your brand or your standing on any social network by breaking its rules.
	
✓	Choose an appropriate prize. As appealing as it may seem to offer a 
Kindle Fire or a brand-new iPad, giving one away will probably do noth­
ing to showcase you or your brand. The device that you choose as a 
prize should give your fans a feel for who you are and what you have to 
offer. The prize should give winners a taste of your company.
	
✓	Spread the word. Remember to share news about the contest on other 
platforms. If you’re asking people to “pin to win,” for example, you can 
still tweet about it and mention it on Instagram. The same advice holds 
true for Google+, YouTube, and Facebook.
www.Ebook777.com

135
 Chapter 7: Driving Interaction
For Facebook contests, the rules are quite specific about holding contests 
using a third-party app. Some popular apps for contests and sweepstakes 
include Wildfire (www.wildfireapp.com) and Strutta (www.strutta.com).
Setting the rules
For every contest or sweepstakes you run online, you should publish official 
contest rules. Usually, they’re composed by lawyers; however, you can use 
your favorite search engine to find templates online. These rules specify how 
the contest is run, its duration, who’s running it, the dollar value of prizes, 
who can enter and who cannot, including states where the contest cannot be 
held, and many other details that you should disclose.
On Pinterest, contests are visual and typically invite users to pin pictures, 
highlighting either the brand’s product or one that the user loves — or both. 
Girls Crochet Headbands ran a contest in January 2013; they posted photos 
of entrants and asked their fans to create a Pinterest board titled Girls 
Crochet Headbands Dream Football Outfit Contest, pin an entire outfit from 
the GCH site, and include at least one football-themed item. The sponsors of 
the contest listed official rules on the site and offered to answer questions on 
Facebook. A winner was chosen by the entire GCH staff.
Aligning your company with a cause
Nine out of ten consumers want brands to tell them the ways they’re support­
ing causes, according to the Cone Cause Evolution Study. (http://ppqty.
com/2010_Cone_Study.pdf) Why do they want to know? Because they 
often prefer to match their dollars with the brands that are “doing good” in 
the world on an ongoing basis. Your audience wants to know which causes 
are close to your company’s heart.
The Con Agra Foods Foundation has been a longtime advocate in the fight 
against child hunger. The cause is so important to the company that it has 
started its own campaign, Child Hunger Ends Here, which renews a few times 
annually with the support of its family of brands. The campaign has its own 
website, shown in Figure 7-7, as well as a Facebook page and YouTube and 
Twitter accounts.
In choosing to align with a particular cause, be sure to find one that fits 
authentically with your brand or business. Picking a cause just to sound 
good feels fake to you and to your community. Connecting with a cause isn’t 
a fad — it’s a commitment.

n some cases, you can be more effective by replacing some of your 
traditional online marketing tools with social networks. In other cases, 
you can serve your customers and prospects more effectively by sticking 
with the traditional or combining traditional with newer tools.
This chapter covers several traditional forms of online communications and 
marketing: e-mail newsletters, online groups, websites, and blogs. We detail 
how to incorporate these tools with social media features so you can make 
them a part of your social media engagement tool kit.
We also cover how to integrate traditional tools into your social networks 
wherever possible. We don’t want you to ignore what still works for you or 
what serves a very specific purpose because we know not everything needs 
straight social media alone.
Creating Social-Powered 
E-mail Newsletters
Gone are the days of plain vanilla text e-mails — or plain vanilla text anything 
online. Multimedia and social media features abound and can add oomph and 
interactivity to any message you send and share. Depending on your budget 
and your needs, you can choose from an array of e-mail marketing tools that 
can help you publish e-mail messaging to your subscribers.

Part III: Examining the Basic Engagement Tools 
At a minimum, professional e-mail marketing tools track e-mail opens and 
clicks. More and more, they also provide ways to entice your readers and 
social media followers to interact with you and share your e-mails with their 
connections on social networks. Though you can easily become enamored 
of social networks, none of them can provide the direct-push messaging that 
e-mail still provides.
Choosing an e-mail marketing tool
E-mail marketing is no longer about broadcasting. E-mail marketing services 
offer a wide and growing array of features to garner your business. You have 
choices — sometimes too many choices.
Deciding which features you need
Although social media engagement features aren’t the only criteria for 
choosing your e-mail marketing tool, using a solution that’s social media–
ready makes it easier for you to merge your e-mail activities with your more 
conversational social ones. Here are some basic features to look for:
	
✓	Social distribution: You need tools that let you easily share links to your 
e-mails to your social networks. The distribution tools should be built 
in with an option to announce each newsletter as it goes out or to easily 
post a link to your social networks.
	
✓	Social sharing: You should have one-click simplicity so your e-mail 
subscribers can seamlessly share your e-mail content onto their social 
networks.
	
✓	Social network integration: You need to be able to embed subscription 
forms for your e-mail newsletter into your Facebook Fan Page as an app. 
If the marketing tool you’re looking at doesn’t have this option, make 
sure the other features it offers are important enough to your business 
to have to deal with a work-around.

Putting out the word
Let people in your social networks know about your e-mail newsletter in 
several ways, including these:
	
✓	Provide social content. Use excerpts from your newsletters such as tips 
or facts that provide valuable content that your following will appreci­
ate and pass along. Include a link to your e-mail newsletter subscrip­
tion form to draw a clear line between the content and your e-mails. 
Example: “You can add an e-mail subscription form to your Facebook 
Fan Page using MailChimp’s app.” Include link here.
	
✓	Post conversation starters. Reference your e-mail in a post but don’t 
make it your main point. For example, you can say “Mobile apps are 
becoming increasingly popular as I mention in my upcoming weekly 
e-newsletter. What are your favorite apps?” Include a link to your e-mail 
subscription page.
	
✓	Publish promotional messages. Craft messages that clearly and suc­
cinctly promote your e-mail newsletter. Your followers won’t mind pro­
motional messages in your streams as long as the messages are clear 
and don’t dominate the conversation. You can couple it with a conversa­
tion starter (see the preceding item). Example: “In my last e-mail news­
letter, I talked about how to get more followers. How do you do this?”
	
✓	Offer calls to action. Sweeten the pot with a call to action that includes 
an offer. Example: “Subscribe to my e-mail newsletter this month and get 
my free handbook on QR code marketing.” Include link here.
	
✓	Encourage sharing. A simple message at the top or bottom of an e-mail 
that states “Feel free to pass this e-mail along” can be effective, but your 
message has to be worth sharing.
As you engage with others through social media, your immediate goals will 
change and adapt based on what is happening or being talked about at any 
given time. Your underlying goals should remain constant. So, although you 
may want more subscriptions to your e-mail newsletter in the future, you 
always want strong connections to continue the conversations with and 
better serve your customers and prospects.
Prompting subscribers to become fans
If people are subscribed to your e-mails but not following you in social net­
works, you want to drive them to connect with you in a social setting as well.

 Chapter 8: E-mail, Forums, Blogs, and Websites
Getting more of your friends, fans, and followers to subscribe to your e-mails 
requires a bit of finesse, however. In this new age of quick, fast, and easy, as 
well as information overload and overwhelm, convincing someone that she 
needs one more e-mail in her inbox can be a hard sell. The following sections 
present a few techniques that can help.
	
E-mail marketing and social media marketing should be complementary, not 
competitive. Don’t stop sending out a regular e-mail simply because you now 
communicate in social networks. Each communications and marketing tool 
has its strengths and weaknesses so using both well gives you a stronger set 
of tools.
Increase your visibility
Chances are you’re only sending out your e-mails on a weekly, bi-weekly, or 
monthly basis, so there are many days between messages when you aren’t in 
touch with your customers and prospects. To get more of your subscribers 
to follow you in social networks where you can connect with them daily or 
almost daily, make it easy for them to do so from your e-mails. Simply Stacie 
provides blogging tips in her e-mail, as shown in Figure 8-2, and provides 
ways for subscribers to connect with her on a variety of social networks.

newsletter.
	
Increase your reach
Make it worth someone’s while to be a subscriber as well as a fan or follower 
so you have multiple opportunities to reach him. You also need to give him a 
good reason to connect with you in other places such as
	
✓	Valuable content published more frequently
	
✓	Special offers reserved for Facebook fans or Twitter followers, for example
	
✓	A relevant community to participate in

Part III: Examining the Basic Engagement Tools 
Offer extra value
Everyone is motivated to connect with brands for different reasons. 
Providing additional value through social media and talking about it in your 
e-mails gives your subscribers incentive to connect with you more frequently 
in social networks.
Position your e-mails as a way to get exclusive content that your followers 
can’t get anywhere else. Just as you provide special offers exclusively for 
your social networks, assign some specifically for your e-mail subscribers. 
One way to make your e-mails more enticing is to provide your e-mail 
subscribers with first notifications of offers and events such as early-bird 
specials or first sneak peeks of new products.
Find out what subscribers want
Survey your subscribers to find out more about them, their interests, and 
what they expect from you and your e-mails. Check the last column in 
Table 8-1 to see which e-mail marketing services offer survey tools.
Driving more than clicks
You want to increase your clicks within your e-mail to drive actions, and 
there are many tips and tricks for getting more clicks. The e-mail marketing 
tool you use should provide reporting and analysis of how people are 
interacting with your e-mails.
You can increase clicks from your newsletter using some of the following 
techniques:
	
✓	Position of links: Links get more clicks when you place them toward the 
top and toward the bottom, but not at the bottom. Figure 8-3 shows the 
MailChimp click map displaying statistics for each link in an e-mail.
	
✓	Repetition of links: Important calls to action bear repeating toward the 
top and bottom of your e-mail.
	
✓	Visual links: Changing the font color or size or adding a clickable 
graphic can attract the eye and encourage a click.
	
✓	Contextual links: Adding links within useful information could invite a 
click.
	
✓	Conversational links: Although some people may argue with the use of 
the words Click Here to prompt someone to click a link, sometimes 
stating the obvious works.
	
✓	Social sharing links: Include easy ways to share your e-mail to social 
networks. (Refer to the icons shown in Figure 8-2.)

Figure 8-3: 
An example 
of click 
analysis 
within an 
e-mail.
	
People click links or share content when they feel the content is valuable. 
Valuable content is in the eye of the beholder. What’s important to you may 
not be to someone else. Getting to know your audience can get you closer to 
providing the type of content they want.
	
Review your e-mail newsletter stats in the weeks after you send it to gauge 
how people respond. Especially note which links get the most clicks and 
examine where links are positioned in an e-mail and the surrounding content. 
Find the sweet spots in terms of content and layout to make your e-mail more 
effective.
	
If you provide too much content or too many links in an e-mail, recipients 
won’t know where to click and might miss the links leading to the actions most 
important to you. Use links sparingly and repeat some of the most important 
ones so you get the results you want.
Participating in Online Communities
Social networks seem to be the dominant destinations for most people who 
are looking to connect and communicate with others, including brands, 
online. Believe it or not, engagement still takes place in online communities 
hosted on a variety of platforms besides social networks.
Entering the conversations in these communities is a form of online outreach 
and can be effective when done appropriately. Over time, however, these 
more closed or contained communities are more challenging to infiltrate, par­
ticularly with a commercial message. Forming your own online communities 
gives you the ability to interact freely.

Part III: Examining the Basic Engagement Tools 
Forming and growing an online community
Online communities are made up of people brought together by common 
interests. People participating in them express their opinions, interact 
with one another, and expect you to be present to respond to them as well. 
Communities tend to run through several common stages as they form and 
grow, as we discuss in this section. 
Formation: First impressions
You’ve built an online presence in a social network, you’ve populated it with 
quality content, and you have an ongoing plan for publishing more content. 
You’ve invited people to your network, and you’re trying to gain traction by 
eliciting responses from followers. At the moment, however, the numbers are 
small. Don’t panic: This situation is normal.
Infancy: Just watching
Your following is growing very slowly. People are only lurking, not contribut­
ing. Your analytics reports may show that people are consuming the content 
you’re publishing, but nobody is responding. (Crickets.) Don’t worry: Silence 
at this stage is common. Often, no one wants to be the first person to com­
ment. Seeding a few comments can break the ice.
Courtship: First interactions
You’ve seeded a few comments and likes (don’t overdo it), and you’ve 
received a few from community members. Recognize them. Thank them. 
Acknowledge their efforts. People like to be noticed. Pay attention to what 
catches their attention and what gets them to respond. Do more of it.
Participation: Superficial interactions
Clicking the Like or Favorite button or the thumbs-up icon or the heart is 
easy. You’re thrilled that people in your community are doing it, but keep 
in mind that it’s a fleeting action. Sure, the numbers look good when you 
advance from single digits to Like tallies in the double, triple, and quadruple 
digits, but at this stage these fast actions probably aren’t translating into 
tangible results. Look for ways to push engagement further.
Engagement: Deeper interactions
Hurray — you’ve received your first tangible and meaningful action! Someone 
has subscribed to your e-newsletter, responded to your question in detail, 
requested more information, provided his mailing address, or bought some­
thing. Whatever you’ve determined are positive and measurable results, 
you’re getting them now. People have moved beyond the easy click to 
meatier interactions and transactions.

Sample community guidelines for engagement
Your community guidelines should reflect your 
corporate culture and values. Here’s some 
language that can be used in your community 
guidelines. (We recommend that you have your 
lawyer review any rules or guidelines that you 
post online.)
We appreciate your participation in our online 
community; however, we reserve the right to 
remove inappropriate comments or posts. By 
inappropriate, we mean overly commercial, 
obscene, libelous, or rude or a personal attack.
Here are some more of our community rules:
	✓	Be kind. When in doubt, follow the golden 
rule: “Do unto others as you would have 
them do unto you.”
	✓	Be discriminating. Share only appropriate 
content or links to appropriate content.
	✓	Be honest. We cannot verify the truthful­
ness of every post, but we will not tolerate 
blatant deception.
	✓	Don’t spam. We like to promote what you 
do, but please do not use our forum and 
community to post blatantly commercial 
messages.
	✓	Add value. Look for ways to contribute in a 
positive way to the conversations that take 
place in our community.
Evangelism: Organic ambassadors
Your community is growing, and your community members are actively 
helping you spread the word. They’re sharing with their own networks the 
content that you’re putting out there. They’re consuming your content and 
then choosing to help you spread it. They’re inviting their friends to join your 
network, to pay attention to you, to like your page or follow you or connect 
with you. Congratulations! You’re in the zone of social media engagement.
	
See Online Community Management For Dummies, by Deborah Ng (published 
by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), for extensive details and examples of how to 
harness the power of online communities for your business.
Identifying the people you want to reach
As with all marketing, targeting your online marketing is essential. To avoid a 
scattershot approach to online outreach that inevitably yields few results and 
is difficult to track, follow these strategies:
	
✓	Know your market. Identify whom you’re trying to reach, including 
demographics and psychographics so you have a profile of the ideal 
prospect and customer.
www.Ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.Ebook777.com
148
Part III: Examining the Basic Engagement Tools 
	
✓	Find your audience. Learn what your targets do online, including the 
social networks they use. Also find out on what other sites and in what 
other forums they spend their time.
	
✓	Target your audience. Craft messaging particular to your target or 
segments of your audience and reach out to them where they gather.
With a clear picture of the people you’re trying to reach, you can engage with 
them beyond social networks. Although it may seem counterintuitive to talk 
about traditional online forums and social media engagement, engagement 
online doesn’t stop everywhere else on the web because social networks are 
on the scene. Sometimes you have to dig a little deeper and be a little more 
creative to find your target audience and engage them.
You can browse group listings on web-based group-hosting sites based on 
category, or search each of these sites for specific topics and keywords to 
find related groups and conversations.
	
Depending on whom you’re trying to reach or the conversation topics you’re 
seeking, you may have an easier time finding related groups by doing a wider 
search on Google first, then drilling down into specific groups where they’re 
hosted.
	
Even though many people are using social networks daily, that also means 
that many brands are clamoring to reach them in those busy, noisy spaces. 
Sometimes reaching out to people in other forums helps your messages stand 
out to attract their attention.
Crafting appropriate messages
To anyone familiar with communicating on social networks, web-based 
forums and groups may seem quaint and simplistic. For those who continue 
to use them, they are rich, vibrant, engaging, and valuable online communi­
ties. Reaching out to people, your audience specifically, where they are most 
comfortable consuming information and connecting is smart marketing.
Many of the web-based forums and groups lack all the bells and whistles of 
social networks. They also tend to feel a lot more cohesive and contained 
than faster-moving messaging streams that often don’t emphasize threaded 
messaging.
In crafting your messages, consider the following:
	
✓	Your business goals: These are the tangible and measurable results you 
hope to gain from engaging online.
	
✓	Your target audience: This means your target market consisting of pros­
pects and customers.
www.Ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.Ebook777.com
149
 Chapter 8: E-mail, Forums, Blogs, and Websites
	
✓	Actions you want others to take: Messaging can be combined with calls 
to action and embedded tools, or links to tools, that facilitate those 
actions.
	
✓	The forum you’re using: No amount of internal planning can compen­
sate for the different technical tools and dynamics inherent to each web-
based forum or social network.
	
	Knowing the way people communicate on each network helps guide 
your messaging. The messages you compose for social networks vary 
from network to network. Some of the aspects of your messaging that 
may need to change include
 
• Content: The words and tone of the message for both your audi­
ence and the tool you’re using
 
• Length: The number of words or characters dictated by the forum
 
• Frequency: How often you post or repeat messages based on the 
rhythm of how people tend to communicate within any given 
forum
 
• Presentation: How you’re able to present your message, including 
text-only, using links and, where possible, embedding images and 
multimedia
We detail in Chapter 5 how to develop a messaging map that guides the con­
tent you craft and post to Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. Even 
without the social media tools, a messaging map can help you craft more tar­
geted and appropriate messages.
	
Use a signature file with a few links to your website or key social networks so 
others can connect with you further. Most web-based forums and groups let 
you add a signature file in your account settings. Otherwise, include one or 
two links under your name each time you contribute to the conversation.
Entering conversations effectively
Whether you’re engaging with people within more contained web-based 
forums and groups or through their messaging streams on social networks, 
knowing how to properly step into a conversation without offending anyone 
is a skill.
Jumping into someone else’s conversation can be akin to interrupting. In the 
online world, it can also come off as creepy and invasive. Other than a few 
variables among forums, you can enter conversations that are already taking 
place online in better ways. Take these steps to avoid common mistakes:
	
1.	Search for keywords to find relevant conversations.
www.Ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.Ebook777.com
150
Part III: Examining the Basic Engagement Tools 
	
	 You can find conversations either by using the search tools provided by 
some of the web-based forums or through a Google search that can pull 
up conversations in public groups. If you’re an accountant, you could 
search for taxes, tax time, and small business tax to find appropriate 
threads.
	
2.	Listen to what’s being said.
	
	 When you find questions and comments around the topics you’ve pin­
pointed, read the threaded messages related to those topics. Gauge the 
sentiment. If people are ranting, you’re better off looking for a less vola­
tile dialog. If people are asking questions, this could be your in.
	
3.	Consider how you can contribute.
	
	 Answering questions is a tried-and-true way to insert yourself into some­
one else’s conversation in a meaningful and valuable way. If you have 
concrete and useful information to share that can help others, look for 
the places you can share your knowledge.
	
4.	Post an appropriate message.
	
	 “Appropriate” is in the eye of the beholder, but if you’ve done your 
homework and take steps to make sure your message is on-topic, useful, 
and courteous, chances are you can engage with others in a web-based 
forum without a negative incident.
After you post a message with the intention of entering an existing conversa­
tion, be attentive to any reactions or responses. Despite your careful con­
sideration and good intentions, your message may fall on deaf ears or ruffle 
some feathers. Be prepared to apologize if someone takes offense or to bow 
out politely if your message is not welcome.
Turning contacts into connections
Over time, you need to turn contacts you make 
in web-based forums into longer-lasting con­
nections. Many web-based forums and groups 
let you “friend” or otherwise connect with other 
members. Keeping connections going in these 
forums can be time-intensive. Encouraging 
others to “follow” or “like” you can be helpful 
to manage your resources, but realize that you 
could weaken those connections by trying to 
move them over to Facebook or Twitter.
Who you’re trying to reach and where you’re 
able to reach them can help you determine if 
you should seek them out in web-based forums 
versus — or in addition to — social networks. 
Although it may seem easier to use social net­
works with all their interconnected messag­
ing tools, discounting more traditional online 
forums could leave out a key segment of your 
target market. In some cases, web-based 
forums may be the only place you can effec­
tively reach your target.

 Chapter 8: E-mail, Forums, Blogs, and Websites
	
If you have or can hire the expertise to position your brand as the go-to 
source of useful and reliable information on a topic relevant to what you do, 
look to establish a presence and engage in online forums based around Q&As 
such as Quora (http://quora.com).
	
You’ll risk getting banned from web-based forums and groups if you seek out 
prospects and blast them with commercial messages. Read the group guide­
lines if they’ve published them. Listen to what others are saying, and contrib­
ute meaningfully to the conversations with relevant questions and responses.
Forming Your Own Groups and Forums
We’ll be the first to tell you that maintaining an online community for your 
business is hard work and very time-consuming. Cultivating online communi­
ties across your various social channels can be a full-time job, a real chal­
lenge for any business owner.
We’d be remiss if we didn’t at least acknowledge that you can use online 
groups and forums separate from social networks to form and nurture an 
online community for your business. Keep in mind that the main difference 
between an online community on a site that lets you host groups versus 
groups within a social network is the technical features they provide.
Social networks can provide group features with more interconnected ways 
to reach larger pools of people — friends of friends and other users of their 
network — while custom groups tend to exist more as islands with limited 
reach to a bigger user-base. If you’re looking for big growth, go the social net­
work route. If you’re looking for smaller and more contained, custom groups 
could fit the bill.
Evaluating the benefits of a custom group
Setting up your own custom group is a big undertaking, as is any kind of 
online community building. Having your own community can happen organi­
cally on your blog or in your social networks, although it more often requires 
a lot of time and attention on your part to stimulate the conversations to the 
point of growing into a cohesive community.
Having your own custom group online creates a more defined space where 
you can engage with others. The way you engage in groups online is in a 
much more direct way than engaging with others through social networks 
where the majority of people are passive followers who may or may not 
engage with you.

Part III: Examining the Basic Engagement Tools 
A custom group can benefit your company in many ways including
	
✓	Reaching a more captive audience for ongoing conversations
	
✓	Getting greater visibility for your posts
	
✓	Engaging in more in-depth dialog with others
	
✓	Strengthening relationships with your customers and prospects
	
✓	Being able to manage who is part of your online community
	
✓	Having a greater ability to guide and moderate conversations
	
✓	Delivering unique content to segmented groups
	
Even if you establish a group, you still need to promote your group to attract 
members. Use the online and offline marketing and promotional tools that 
you’d use to promote anything you do online, including mentions in your 
newsletter, e-mails, website, social networks, and even online ads. 
Choosing a group management tool
The tools you might use to build an online community outside of a social net­
work usually lack the interconnected features that provide exposure to your 
brand and help speed up growth of your following. For example, there are 
no “retweets” or “shares” within most of these web-based forums to a much 
wider audience.
Some of the sites that host groups and provide tools to manage your groups 
include
	
✓	Yahoo! Groups (http://groups.yahoo.com)
	
✓	Google Groups (http://groups.google.com)
	
✓	GroupSpaces (http://groupspaces.com)
	
✓	Ning (http://ning.com)
	
✓	BigTent (http://bigtent.com)
	
✓	Meetup (http://meetup.com)
Both Yahoo! Groups and Google Groups are offshoots of old-style e-mail lists 
and still provide an e-mail component as well as archived threaded messaging 
boards on the web. GroupSpaces is one of the services specifically developed 
for building groups online, and Ning offers even more bells and whistles, giving 
you features that let you create your own custom social network. Both BigTent 
and Meetup offer online forums for offline groups and organizations.

rately from social networks, Table 8-2 breaks down which of the popular

Now’s the time to pick up Online Community Management For Dummies, by 
Deborah Ng (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), for the nuts and bolts of building and 
running your online community regardless of where it’s hosted.
Building groups in social networks
Going old-school with your online community building tools can be beneficial 
to reach very specific audiences. If you want to cast a much wider net, you 
need platforms that offer more ways to reach more people. This is where 
social networks come in.
To get the cohesive and more intimate feeling of a group combined with 
social networking features, consider a few platform options. Facebook 
Groups and LinkedIn Groups are two top social networks that specifically have 
www.Ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.Ebook777.com
154
Part III: Examining the Basic Engagement Tools 
group-building options. Twitter doesn’t have a group feature. Technically, 
Google+ has Circles that group together individuals and messages but do 
not provide a fully-defined “place” to congregate. Pinterest offers group 
boards and secret boards (see Chapter 11), but these aren’t fully fleshed out 
community-building platforms. We discuss all these services in more detail in 
Chapters 9 through 13.
Enhancing Blogs and Websites 
for Engagement
When you think social media engagement, your static website probably isn’t 
the first thing that comes to mind. Of course, there’s always your blog. You 
might think the comments feature on your existing blog offers the possibility 
of engagement, especially if you get comments and then reply to those 
comments.
You may even start to recognize people who leave comments on your blog posts 
because they keep coming back. Some conversations may take place in the com­
ment sections of your blog, giving you the feeling that you’re building an online 
community. With all the options for connecting with others, your blog’s standard 
comments section is no longer enough to truly engage with your audience.
Facilitating sharing with 
social network widgets
Bridge the gap between your existing website or blog with your social net­
works using widgets. Widgets typically sit on your sidebar showcasing content 
from another location: Twitter, video from another site, even the weather.
Widgets are lines of code such as JavaScript that can be added to the HTML 
code of your website or blog to pull content in from other sites. When the 
content on those other sites is updated, the widget dynamically updates with 
that same content on your site.
For better social media integration, you can embed widgets in two main ways 
on your website or blog:
	
✓	Add social sharing features so your site visitors can easily share your 
content to their social networks.
	
✓	Pull in social network content onto your website or blog.
Each major social network provides free widgets for your site or blog, some 
of which can be easily customized in terms of size, shape, color, and features.

Expanding commenting with apps
You can add new life to your website or blog by adding social-powered tools 
so your sites and social channels are more interconnected. Social commenting 
tools such as Facebook’s Comments Box and third-party software add-ons such 
as Disqus (www.disqus.com) and Livefyre (www.livefyre.com) let people log 
in to your website to comment using their social media accounts or identities. 
Each social plugin offers some similar functionality, including integrating your 
website or blog comments with your social network conversations.
Facebook’s Comments Box can sync comments to your Facebook Fan Page 
and can spread the conversations to your site visitors’ Facebook friends. When 
commenting on your site, your visitors can opt to post their comments to their 
Facebook Timelines. Comments show Facebook users the most relevant com­
ments from their friends, friends of friends, and most active discussions.
You can add Disqus to your WordPress, Blogger, and Tumblr blogs or one 
built on Drupal to increase engagement. The Disqus add-on works with 
HTML5 and also using a JavaScript plugin. Using Disqus, you can add real-
time conversations to your site or blog instead of only the asynchronous 
messaging of standard comments. When a Disqus user is logged in, she can 
see when other Disqus users are also on your website and even watch in real-
time as others are typing comments. Disqus also has ratings and sharing fea­
tures; moderation tools and analytics; and Disqus Discovery so Disqus users 
can discover your content when they’re visiting other sites and blogs.

Livefyre also provides a social comments feature for your blog or website. 
Like Disqus, it provides live, real-time commenting and an administrative tool 
to moderate comments and control spam. Livefyre users can have profiles 
so you can get to know your site visitors and community members. They 
can tag their friends in comments to bring more people to the conversation. 
Livefyre’s SocialSync works similarly to Facebook’s Comments Box to tie

F

acebook may be one of the first sites you think of when you consider 
deepening your digital experience as either an individual or a busi­
ness. According to statistics on AllFacebook – the ‘Unofficial Facebook Blog’ 
(http://allfacebook.com/morrison-foerster-time-spent-face
book_b105616) an average user spends just less than seven hours a month 
on the site, updating their status, connecting with friends and family mem­
bers, liking pictures, and skimming for news from their favorite brands and 
businesses. This is more than any other platform. Facebook is the first online 
site that many users visit to start their day and the last one they click to in 
the evening before shutting everything down. What this means to you is that 
Facebook offers a huge, active potential audience — and huge rewards for 
any business that knows how to engage this audience.
In this chapter, we walk you through the best ways to deepen your relation­
ships with your community on Facebook, post quality content in your News 
Feed that draws the attention it deserves, and master the many specialized 
features in Facebook.
	
Every time we say Facebook Timeline, we’re talking about a personal or 
individual page, and every time we say Facebook Page, we’re talking about a 
brand, company, or business page. Also, though the term fan is no longer used 
by Facebook to refer to someone who likes your business page, we still refer 
to fans rather than “Likers” for simplicity’s sake. Got it?

Part III: Examining the Basic Engagement Tools 
Building Deeper Relationships 
on Facebook
As of September 2012, Facebook had more than 1 billion active users. (To 
put this figure in perspective, consider this fact: If Facebook was a country, it 
would be the third-largest in the world, after China and India.) Those 1 billion 
users include 11 million businesses with Facebook pages, all of which, like 
you, are striving to strengthen relationships with their communities.
Businesses use their pages primarily to
	
✓	Engage with customers: Generate conversation and become more than 
the logo. Ask your customers questions, and respond to customers 
whenever they ask a question or reply to yours.
	
✓	Share pictures and videos: Show and tell. Highlight events that are hap­
pening around you, with your company, or with your products. Give 
your audience a sneak peek behind the scenes of your company, and 
make them feel like a part of your tribe. In Figure 9-1, Lisa Lehmann, 
of Studio Jewel, regularly uploads photos of her jewelry — pieces that 
she’s working on now and the ones she has available for immediate ship­
ping (especially around holidays).
	
✓	Provide news and updates: Use Facebook as an opportunity to keep 
your community “in the know.” Share your newest product launches, 
company updates, and related industry or topical news that would be of 
interest to your fans and followers.
	
✓	Sell products: In addition to sharing news about your products, you can 
take the extra step to create an e-commerce option for your Facebook 
fans and followers and sell directly to them from your Facebook page. The 
National Retail Foundation found that more than 25 percent of Facebook 
users have purchased directly from a business page, and that number 
continues to grow with the introduction of Facebook Gifts (http://www.
facebook.com/about/gifts), a feature that lets Facebook members 
buy products for each other by way of the Facebook site.
	
	eBay Stores (http://stores.ebay.com), Etsy (www.etsy.com), 
Shopify (www.shopify.com), and a variety of other sites offer apps 
that can be linked directly to your Facebook page to offer a sales option. 
These apps plug directly into your business page so that the shop­
ping experience for your fans is seamless and they don’t have to leave 
Facebook to buy from you.
	
✓	Make community members feel special: Treat your Facebook commu­
nity as members of a special club. Make them the first to know about 
company news and product updates. Make them eligible for special con­
tests, giveaways, and discounts.

✓	Provide customer support and care: It’s your chance to turn every cus­
tomer into a raving fan by responding to queries and concerns directly 
and honestly.

Growing Your Page Community
Someone from your community who likes or comments on your Facebook 
business page obviously wants a connection with you. That person wants to 
feel special and to be acknowledged and to know that you’re paying atten­
tion. Clicking the Like button is an investment of their time and attention. 
They’re publicly endorsing your brand. Your fans are the people who want 
to know more about you and who are interested in connecting with the com­
munity you build — a community of people with shared interests whether 
it’s healthy, prepared food that’s delivered to your home or cowboy boots or 
photography.

Part III: Examining the Basic Engagement Tools 
Increasing follower loyalty
A recent study by www.socialmediaexaminer.com found that 51 percent 
of Facebook users said they’re more likely to buy from brands they follow. A 
person initially follows your brand on Facebook because he genuinely likes you 
or wants to learn more about you. If your brand is engaging, you can establish 
a connection with those prospects and help them feel that they belong. With 
increased engagement and responsiveness, you move from someone liking 
your brand with a click to increased brand recognition and loyalty.
Here are some of the best ways to create a loyal following from the commu­
nity at your page:
	
✓	Craft a plan. Determine your target market. Is your ideal audience made 
up of families who want to have their healthy food delivered? Or are you 
looking to reach moms with little girls? After you pinpoint who you want 
to reach, finding and attracting an audience to your page isn’t a short-
term process. Put in place a plan to help grow your page.
	
✓	Provide quality engagement. Everything you put on your page — every 
picture, every video, every status update — is a reflection of you and 
your brand. Aim for quality. Know that every post can be shared, so 
don’t slack off on paying attention to the information you publish. If your 
audience likes what you have to say, they’ll pass it on, and when they 
do, your name — your brand — will be attached. The more people share 
what you publish, the more exposure you receive to continue building 
your community.
	
✓	Establish trust. Your community consists of your people. Talk to them 
as though you respect them. Ask their opinions. Answer questions when 
they ask them of you. Every time you do something right, and every 
time you share, they not only return the good word about you but also 
spread it around.
	
✓	Be real. If you’re an authentic brand who is staying true to your values 
and vision, your community will notice. gDiapers, the “earth-friendly 
hybrid of diapers,” uses the Australian expression fair dinkum to 
describe its overall company culture and philosophy. Its employees aim, 
as part of their company mission, to be genuine and real with everyone 
they encounter, so it comes as no surprise to the company’s nearly 
47,000 Facebook fans when the brand chooses to support a specific 
charity with the sale of one of its products, as shown in Figure 9-2. gDia­
pers is sticking to its mission, and its fans take notice.
	
✓	Stick to a schedule. Consistency is vital to the success of your page. As 
with other SME platforms, it’s worse to establish a presence and stop 
posting than to never have a presence in the first place. Decide whether 
to post daily, twice a day, or more. Later in this chapter, we offer 
suggestions for optimum posting.

 Chapter 9: Facebook
	
✓	Listen and respond. One major benefit of having a business page is that 
it gives you the opportunity to connect with your audience, to let them 
know that they’ve been heard. The Kraft brand Lunchables has a policy 
of responding to every comment on its page (whether the comment is 
a compliment, question, or complaint) within four hours, but someone 
often manages to reply much sooner. See an example of this responsive­
ness in Figure 9-3.
	
✓	Track progress. Be diligent about whatever it is that excites your com­
munity. Do they share your pictures like crazy? Do they love to be asked 
their opinions? Or do you hear crickets (silence!) the more you add stan­
dard status updates? To better engage with your fans on their terms, do 
more of what they love.

Part III: Examining the Basic Engagement Tools 
	
✓	Take your time. You’re in this for the long haul. Building a community 
that you can be proud of requires a time commitment and a willingness to 
continually improve what you’re doing as you go.
Managing your community on Facebook is obviously a big job — for more 
information on best practices to create connections within your community, 
refer to Chapter 6.
When your audience and fans feel connected to you, they like the con­
tent you put on your page. When they enjoy the communication you have 
together, they like your page, and they like your pictures, your links, and 
your videos. When they trust you, when they feel heard, when they know that 
you’re listening — in essence, when they truly feel engaged — they go even a 
step further and share your brand with others.
Your goal is likely to attract more comments and more likes on your page, 
but what you really want are more shares — because they lead to more likes 
and comments. It’s one big circle of engagement.
Consider these tips for increasing your post likeability:
	
✓	Ask a question. Though it may seem to be a good idea to ask it at the begin­
ning of a post, we recommend that you ask it at the end of a short post. Ask 
the question after a link or accompanying a picture. One study by Buddy 
Media aimed at determining the keys to effective posts estimates that inter­
action increases by 15 percent when you add a question at the end of a 
post — and you may even see twice the number of comments.
http://michaellorinfriedman.com/wp-content/
uploads/2013/01/Strategies-for-
EffectiveWallpost_2012_Final.pdf
	
✓	Ask for what you want. If you want someone to comment, to caption a 
picture, to share your post, to like your page, or to respond in another 
way, simply ask. The maker of the KitKat candy bar told its fans to 
share — and share they did, as shown in Figure 9-4. Be direct and ask 
for what you want your fans to do. They were already visiting, already 
‘liking’ what they were reading or watching — you are simply asking 
them to say it out loud.
	
✓	Ask your community to fill in the blank. Would you believe that you’re 
four times more likely to draw a response to your post by creating a 
fill-in-the-blank scenario? An example is a chocolatier asking fans to com­
plete a sentence such as this one:
If I were a chocolate, ___ would be my flavor.

 Chapter 9: Facebook
	
	Filling in the blank would be fun for fans and an activity that they might 
like to share. Pair it with a mouth-watering photo of chocolates, and the 
company could have a viral post on its hands. Facebook users like to 
play games on Facebook — so let them do it on your page.
	
✓	Run a contest. Get your fans involved by inviting them to participate in 
a giveaway, sweepstakes, or contest. See Figure 9-5 for a look at the Got 
Milk tablet giveaway in the Sack the Soda contest on its Facebook page.

more than

Be careful about running contests on Facebook or you risk violating its terms 
of service. Facebook states that you must carry out contests on your page 
using a third-party solution. Popular tools include Wildfire (www.wildfire
app.com) for promotions and Rafflecopter (www.rafflecopter.com) for 
giveaways.

Promoting your business page 
with your personal Timeline
Naturally, your personal Timeline is a completely different animal from your 
Facebook page. Though your page is all-business-all-the-time, the Timeline 
has all your personal connections to friends, family, and interests. Some 
crossover likely occurs between the professional you and the personal you, 
but you need to decide how to handle that blurring line — and how often.
Determine whether and how you want to use your personal Timeline to 
promote your business page. Your personal Timeline can be an additional 
place to provide greater visibility to your business and potentially place your 
brand in front of a larger audience who may not have made the leap to like 
your business page.
Make the connection obvious between your personal Timeline and your 
business page by linking your personal Timeline to your professional page:
	
1.	Click Update Info.
	
2.	Click Edit Work and Education.
	
3.	Type the name of your Facebook page.
	
	The page name should show up along with other, similar ones.
	
4.	Select the correct page name.
	
5.	Click Done Editing.

165
 Chapter 9: Facebook
	
6.	Return to your personal Timeline page to confirm that the link has 
connected.
Use your personal Timeline to thoughtfully promote your page. Tag your page 
by using the @ sign and typing the name of your page, and then select your page 
so that the name becomes clickable (similar to the way you tag your friends).
From your Timeline, your friends can head over to your business page, if 
they’re interested, or even like the page without ever leaving your Timeline, 
because the Like button appears as soon as you hover the mouse over the 
link, as shown in Figure 9-6.

ness page,

Standing Out in the News Feed
In the grand field of Facebook content, it can feel like you’ve undertaken 
Mission Impossible to try to stand out in the crowd. The latest estimate from 
Facebook (late 2012) says that 2.5 billion pieces of content — pictures, status 
updates, and videos — are being shared every single day. 
http://gigaom.com/2012/08/22/facebook-is-collecting-your-
data-500-terabytes-a-day/
And, Facebook has adjusted its Pages algorithm so that businesses need to 
make even more of an effort to strive for visibility. (Talk about making mes­
sages multi-colored in a world of black-and-white!)

Part III: Examining the Basic Engagement Tools 
As we mention earlier in this chapter, you must consider your efforts on 
Facebook to be part of a long-term journey. A single post or a single status 
update doesn’t have the viral capability that a YouTube video might. In fact, 
more than 90 percent of the people who like your page initially don’t return 
to your page. It’s up to you to attract their attention in their News Feeds. 
It’s a combination of understanding Facebook’s EdgeRank, crafting the right 
kinds of posts, and playing all the right games to increase your noticeability.
Navigating EdgeRank
Quite simply, EdgeRank is the algorithm that determines what information 
appears in your Facebook News Feed. EdgeRank, naturally, ranks “the edge” 
that each piece of content — a picture, a video, a link, or a status update — 
has as it floats through the river of significant subject matter you may or 
may not want to see each and every day. The higher the EdgeRank, the more 
prominently placed your updates and content are in your fans’ daily feeds.
Three measurements make up the complex formula of EdgeRank: affinity 
which, in essence, is how often your content is liked, commented on, or 
shared; weight, which measures the quality of the engagement you receive — 
for example, ‘weighing’ comments as more important than likes; and 
time decay, which factors in how long your content has been online.
Your goal is to make Edge Rank work for you. You want Facebook to weigh 
your content as important enough to keep it regularly visible to your audi­
ence. This means you need to monitor if what you share is engaging enough 
to receive comments and likes. 
	
The combination of affinity, weight, and time decay determines the EdgeRank 
of a Facebook brand or business page. The higher the EdgeRank, the greater 
the page’s visibility in fans’ news feeds.
Crafting engaging posts
To master EdgeRank, find a way to attract attention to your brand page and 
posts. Work your way into the hearts and heads of your community to secure 
a greater edge. Surprise them, inspire them, delight them, make them laugh, 
teach them something new — you can even shock them, if it’s appropriate. 
Find different ways to convince people that what you have to say is worth 
liking, commenting on, and (especially) sharing.
According to PageLever.com, your page posts reach, on any given day, only 
3 percent to 7.5 percent of your fans. Though this number seems incredibly 
low, your priority is to increase the engagement from the fans who are seeing 
your content.

 Chapter 9: Facebook
Think about how often you post. Too much engagement is the number-one 
reason that the people who have liked you decide to hide you from their 
News Feeds or, in some cases, to unlike your page. If your community or your 
fans hide your content, as shown in Figure 9-7, that action decreases your 
EdgeRank, making it even more challenging for you to continue to appear in 
the News Feeds of your remaining fans. On the flip side, if you post too infre­
quently, you’ll quickly be forgotten.
	
Figure 9-7: 
Click the 
arrow to the 
right of any 
post to hide 
that content 
from your 
feed.
	
Start slowly, posting from one to three times a day, and change the frequency 
depending on how much engagement you receive as you post. Consider 
people’s emotions when you craft posts each day. Keep in mind that pictures 
and text updates are the posts that garner the most engagement.
The best way to create an engaging post is to opt for emotion, but be brief. 
Inspire your community. Don’t be afraid to throw in elements of surprise (to 
keep them intrigued). Most important of all, write posts from your heart. You 
aren’t making a sales pitch or requesting your fans’ opinions. A simple state­
ment describing how you feel at that moment humanizes your brand. When 
the fitness bar Zone Perfect did this at the end of 2012, it received positive 
fan reactions, as shown in Figure 9-8.
Sharing personal news and scenes from the real lives of the people behind your 
brand can often generate authentic reactions from your community. People love 
to know the names and faces of your brand representatives because it confirms 
that the reps are real people who are living real lives. Your brand becomes more 
relatable to your fans. The children’s clothing company Matilda Jane shared 
news of an employee’s new baby, as shown in Figure 9-9, and quickly received 
love and affection from the community on its Facebook page.

 Chapter 9: Facebook
	
In addition to photo posts and video posts, you can post links and text-only 
status updates. Though the Facebook EdgeRank has placed a priority on the 
most visual posts, experiment to determine what your audience notices. 
Mixing the types of posts you publish can be effective in attracting attention.
Adding visual elements to 
draw instant attention
As we often say, if you want your posts to be seen in someone’s News Feed, 
use a visual of some kind. In some instances, Facebook and EdgeRank have 
crowned the photo post as the king of engagement, at least as far as pages 
are concerned.
According to the same study mentioned previously by Buddy Media (in the 
earlier section, “Increasing follower loyalty”), photo posts are 39 percent 
more likely to receive some level of interaction. Plain-text status updates 
come in second, followed (distantly) by video and links.
In essence, use a picture! Here are some ways to leverage the photo post:
	
✓	Make basic photo posts. The basic photo post is the easiest to make 
and to recommend. Visually share highlights of what’s happening in 
your company’s world — whether a new product is launching soon, the 
people in your office are hard at work, or you’re showing scenes from a 
conference that you’re attending or the view outside your office door.
	
✓	Run caption contests. Share any basic photos and ask your community 
to caption the photo for you. If possible, share the pictures that have 
the most personality. Now your photo has dual purposes: It has higher 
EdgeRank because it’s a photo, and your engagement should jump even 
more if people approve of the idea of offering the caption.
	
✓	Ask for community pictures. Ask your community to send you 
pictures — preferably based on a theme that relates to your business. 
You can then share the pictures and tag the fans who submit them. (We 
talk more about tagging later in this chapter, in the section “Tagging 
photos and posts.”)
	
✓	Create and share your own images. Create your own funny or inspira­
tional photo to share. Use a personal photo combined with an inspira­
tional quote, for example, or head to a site such as www.someecards.
com for humor that’s being shared. To avoid copyright issues, however, 
create your own brand of funny.

Part III: Examining the Basic Engagement Tools 
	
If you have a picture to share, use your favorite search engine to find a quote 
to accompany it — whether it’s funny or inspirational. Then use a photo edit­
ing website such as PicMonkey (www.picmonkey.com) to add the text easily 
to the image without having to use an expensive photo editing program on 
your computer. Save the picture and post it on your Facebook page.
Reaching out to other pages
The last thing you want to do is spam someone, let alone other business 
pages; however, commenting thoughtfully on pages with similar interests can 
increase your own page engagement. The key is to find businesses that are 
complementary to (not competitive with) your own business and then like 
their pages while you’re using your business page (and not your personal 
account).
Interacting from your page on Facebook can be an effective and subtle way of 
gaining greater visibility and exposure to a new audience. When you’re using 
your Facebook business Page, regularly monitor your News Feed for the busi­
ness pages you’ve liked for relevant content that you can like, share, or com­
ment on. Your brand name then appears on the other business’ pages, so be 
intentional and thoughtful when you comment.
You don’t need to engage on other pages every single day, but add this task 
to your weekly rotation of engagement activities. If you have a team of people 
working on your brand, assign one person the responsibility of page-to-page 
engagement. The more visibility your page has, the more opportunities you 
create for liking and sharing.
	
Don’t do anything on someone else’s business page that you wouldn’t want 
them to do on yours, and don’t use a commercial tone to tell people to visit 
your page. Interact like a true fan, and be a good community member in their 
communities to gain exposure without offending anyone.
Determining post timing and frequency
Naturally, your head spins as you imagine all the factors you must consider 
as you craft your posts. You want them to be engaging. (Remember that 
visual posts are the key.) A bit of Goldilocks is hidden in this theory — not 
too much, not too little, but just right. Post too often and your community 
will run screaming from your content, unable to find the Hide Posts button 
quickly enough. Post once every few days and you will all but disappear from 
the News Feed.
Begin by posting once daily and work up to posting three or four times a day, 
depending, of course, on the amount of engagement you’re seeing from your 
www.Ebook777.com

 Chapter 9: Facebook
fans. Additionally, monitor your analytics to track your engaged users. (We 
tell you more about analytics later in this chapter, in the section “Analyzing 
Facebook interactions”).
In order to maximize your time and keep up with the appropriate frequency 
for posting on Facebook, be succinct, post both during the week and on 
weekends to reach all of your fans, don’t rely on third-party apps alone to 
post your content as Facebook’s algorithm prioritizes manual posts, and do 
use full links when you post so your audience can see where they are heading.
Driving traffic to your page 
with cross-posting
Consider the importance of driving traffic to Facebook from other locations. 
For example, cross-post from Facebook to Twitter to let your Twitter audi­
ence know about your Facebook page. Follow these steps to find the specific 
URL for an individual Facebook post in order to post it in other locations.
	
1.	Pick an individual post that you’ve already shared on Facebook.
	
2.	Click the time stamp on that post.
	
	You can find the stamp immediately under the name of your page, at the 
top of an individual post.
	
3.	Find the URL.
	
	When you click the time stamp, you can see the permanent link (every 
post has one) for that specific post.
	
4.	Copy and paste that URL to Twitter.
	
5.	Add some text to promote the post.
	
6.	Click send.
Congratulations — you’ve promoted a specific post from your Facebook page 
on Twitter.
Leveraging the Advanced 
Features of Facebook
Simply hearing the word feature can make a person think extra. Using the 
extras that Facebook has made available to boost your business page is 
bound to make you and your brand stand up and stand out — assuming that 
you know how to make the best use of them. Fortunately, that’s why we’re 
here.

Part III: Examining the Basic Engagement Tools 
With new features continually being introduced (Graph Search and Facebook 
Gifts are the latest that come to mind), you have many opportunities to 
increase engagement: You can add apps to your Timeline or business Page, 
use your mobile device, embed social widgets for greater visibility, and even 
pay for advertising.
Tagging photos and posts
Epiphanie Bags created its Facebook business Page back in 2009. Now more 
than 42,000 likes strong, the page is decorated with photos of the brand’s key 
products — a line of camera photo bags. The kicker is that most of the pic­
tures appearing on Epiphanie’s business Page aren’t ones shot by the brand 
but, rather, by customers and fans.
Inspire your customers to take their own pictures of your product and 
post them to your Facebook page, by way of a contest or simply by word of 
mouth. This is yet another way to encourage loyalty and engagement.
Typically, when a fan posts a picture and tags the brand by using the @ symbol 
(as is the case with Epiphanie), the photos appear not on the brand’s main 
page but rather on the right side of the page, under the Recent Posts by Others 
on Epiphanie. However, Epiphanie doubles up on engagement, showing off to 
their entire audience the pictures their fans have taken, by reposting the pic­
tures in their main News Feed and tagging the fan, as shown in Figure 9-10. Fans 
are rewarded for posting great-looking photos on their Timelines, and more 
people then engage in this activity to get the same recognition.
Epiphanie also shares posts from other blogs that talk about their bags. By 
doing this, they show extra appreciation to their fans, they share the kind of 
content (photos) that the Facebook EdgeRank algorithm focuses on, and they 
showcase their own product. It’s a win-win situation for everyone.
Scheduling posts for the greatest impact
We recommend that you’re as present and as engaged with your audience as 
possible — you must therefore be diligent about any decisions to schedule 
posts on your Facebook page.
Scheduling can be a good option to relieve the extra pressure of posting 
frequently, and it can encourage you to post consistently. Using the built-
in scheduling option in Facebook can help ensure that your EdgeRank isn’t 
negatively affected by using third-party apps to schedule your posts.

Here’s how to schedule a post using the Facebook scheduler:
	
1.	Fill in your post as you normally do, including text, links, photos, or 
videos.
	
2.	In the lower-left corner of the Update field, click on the tiny gray 
clock.
	
	 The clock feature lets you schedule, or even backdate, your post 
starting with the year.
	
3.	Enter the year, month, day, hour, and minutes — in 10-minute 
intervals — when you want the update to post.
	
	 See Figure 9-11 for an example.

4.	Click Schedule.
	
	 Your post is added to the activity log — which shows you all activity 
that has happened or is set to happen on your page. To check your 
scheduled posts, choose Edit Page at the very top of your page and then 
Activity Log — you’ll see scheduled posts and the dates and times that 
they’ll be posted.
	
Your post appears seamlessly on your page at the scheduled time. If you need 
to edit the post after it has been scheduled, you can go to the activity log by 
clicking on Edit Page at the very top of your page. The only setting you can 
adjust is the time that your post is set to “go live.” You can change the time 
by clicking on the arrow in the top-right corner of your scheduled post. If you 
suddenly notice a misspelling, for example, you have to delete the post and 
start the process over again.
Optimizing your page for search engines
When you’re trying to draw people to your Facebook page by creating amaz­
ing and engaging content, remember that a large percentage of the basic 
traffic you see on your site is based on good, old-fashioned search — that is, 
people find you based on what they type into a search engine. Your Facebook 
page should be optimized so that search engines can easily find you, a pro­
cess called search engine optimization. In case you’ve neglected a few basic 
principles while getting your page up and running, go back now and edit the 
following items to get more search bang for your buck:
	
✓	Choose a strong name. It’s basic advice, yet you can easily choose the 
wrong name. Picking a name that’s too generic makes it difficult to be 
found, just as choosing one that’s too wordy (such as Tom’s Sporting 
Goods — Football, Hockey, Baseball, Golf, and More!) can make your 
fans less likely to share your posts because it feels “too spammy.”

 Chapter 9: Facebook
	
	Google assigns the greatest importance to the first word in the title of 
your Facebook business page, so choose wisely.
	
✓	Create a customized vanity URL. After you have attracted at least 25 likes 
on your page, Facebook lets you choose your own, custom URL. As when 
you choose your brand name, choose wisely. If your business name has 
been taken, pick a name that indicates what your business is about. Go to 
http://facebook.com/username to select your page name, and care­
fully select your business page versus your personal Timeline.
	
✓	Use keywords carefully. Use keywords throughout your page, espe­
cially in permanent areas such as About Page, Company Overview, and 
Mission. All three of these content areas are indexed for search, mean­
ing that Google crawls or searches these pages for a way to identify you 
and allow your audience to find you.
	
✓	Link liberally. Link to your Facebook page from as many of your online 
social media platforms as possible, such as your website and blogs. 
Google places more importance on pages that have a greater number of 
inbound links.
	
✓	Add local information. It may seem silly to list your address and phone 
number when many of your sales may originate from online traffic, but 
it’s still wise to make yourself available for local search results.
	
	Addresses and phone numbers can increase the overall SEO of a site 
because Google indexes sites with specific information at a higher priority. 
Google refers to this information as NAP (Name, Address, and Phone) data.
If you have restricted your page access in any way (such as a liquor company 
restricting access by age or a company restricting geographical access, to visi­
tors only from the United States), your page won’t be seen by members of the 
general public on the web who aren’t logged in to their Facebook accounts.
If Facebook cannot verify the age or location or other restriction criteria, a 
person not logged in to Facebook always arrives at the Facebook home page 
and is prompted to log in. Your page isn’t visible to them until they’re logged 
in — and only if they meet the criteria based on the restrictions you set.
Graph Search
As of this writing, Graph Search isn’t available to all users or in languages 
other than English, but it does have the potential to change the game for 
small businesses. With its ability to hyper-search users based on interests, 
locations, and pages ‘liked’, businesses will be able to assess the fans of their 
competition: Who loves Nike in Dallas? Are they female or male? In their 30’s 
or 40’s? Avid runners or new to the sport? Additionally, Graph Search enables 
businesses to develop deeper connections with those fans who have liked 
their brands because they are true fans as compared to having a momentary 
interest.

rants, and narrow your hunt very specifically. Figure 9-12 shows how Graph

Advertising on Facebook
You may want to see more interaction with your fan base — and see it now. 
One quick and efficient way to make it happen is to explore the Facebook 
advertising options. You’ve likely been wringing your hands and working tire­
lessly to build your community in a completely organic fashion. If it’s working 
beautifully, by all means, keep it up; if you’re looking for a boost, however, 
the ad choices that Facebook presents just might be the route to take.
If you have 100 or more fans, you can pay to promote your posts or create 
specialized offers or discounts on products and services for your audi­
ence. The barrier for entry used to be 400 likes, but that number changed in 
January 2013.
A promoted post is more visible in the News Feed, making it easier for your 
audience to see. You can easily promote a post by clicking the Promote 
button underneath your status update. Facebook offers you a budget — usu­
ally beginning at $5 — and tells you, based on that amount, how many people 
you can expect to reach. You can choose to increase the budget, if you want.
Let’s take a look at the more advanced ad options:
	
1.	Head to www.facebook.com/advertising.
	
2.	Assuming that you already have a Facebook page in place, click 
Create an Ad.
www.Ebook777.com

 Chapter 9: Facebook
	
	At this point, Facebook asks what you want to advertise. You can see 
whether it will populate any pages you might have, so you can easily 
click on those — or enter a specific URL if you’re choosing to advertise 
an event, a website, or a destination outside of your Facebook pages.
	
3.	Choose your goal.
	
	 You may be looking to grow your audience by increasing the number of 
people who like your page, to ensure that your community sees the con­
tent you’re sharing, to promote a specific post, or to explore additional 
advanced options.
	
4.	Create the ad.
	
	Fill in the headline and text for the ad, and choose a picture or an avatar 
to accompany it.
	
5.	Target your audience.
	
	You can choose who you want to see your ad by state, age, or interest or 
by broad categories such as family status, DIY/crafting, or gaming.
	
6.	Set your price.
	
	Ah, yes — the final step concerns how much it costs. The beauty of 
this step is that you get to decide how much you’re willing to invest or 
budget. Facebook makes recommendations, but, ultimately, you decide. 
The amount that’s set is based on the cost per mille (CPM), or cost per 
million impressions. If you switch to the Advanced Pricing option, you 
can choose to be charged instead on cost per click. In this case, you can 
also set the budget.
	
	 The lowest bid available for cost per click (CPC) is one cent (.01); how­
ever, Facebook warns that choosing an amount this low isn’t likely 
enough for your ad or sponsored story to be seen. Choose an amount in 
the suggested range.
Jen Estes owns Manestream Studio, a full-service hair salon in St. Charles, 
Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. In making an effort to increase engagement 
on their Facebook page, Manestream changed the way they communicate 
with their fan base, by increasing the number of posts, offering incentives, 
and setting an advertising budget.
In one of Manstream’s first advertisements, they doubled up on their engage­
ment by offering a discount within the ad. In Figure 9-13, you can see the 
spike in their visibility and engagement in their statistics from the begin­
ning of January 2013. In the first series of sponsored posts, the number of 
likes they received increased by 12 percent, the number of people under the 
People Talking about This link increased by more than 400 percent, and their 
total weekly reach (the biggest jump) was more than 1300 percent.

When you purchase ads on Facebook, you have the option to select mobile-
only options to make your ad show up only when someone accesses 
Facebook from a mobile device. 
Embedding social widgets
Knowledge is power. Your goal is to make your business page known to 
others so that they find it, like it, and engage with you there or by way of 
your posts. As surprising as it may seem, some people don’t automatically 
assume that you have a Facebook presence, and still others may assume that 
you do but not take the time to look for you.
By integrating Facebook directly into your website, you drive traffic to your 
page. If you make this process easy by embedding a Facebook social widget 
(as Amy Porterfield did, as shown in Figure 9-14), people who already know 
and like you (they’re visiting your website and other social platforms, after 
all) are more likely to click the Like button to show your updates in their 
News Feeds or to scoot over to your page to explore how you engage with 
your audience.

Analyzing Facebook interactions
You may have invested hours, days, or even weeks planning your Facebook 
page strategy, and then implementing it and (you hope) watching your com­
munity begin to grow. The key is to pay attention to the correct metrics, to 
ensure that you’re doing more of the activities that help you progress and cut 
back on any activities that might stunt your social media growth.
Facebook keeps track of in-depth analytics for you — in a comprehensive 
way — and makes them available to anyone who is an administrator of your 
Facebook page. The public cannot see these details — only administrators 
have access to Facebook Insights. Your analytics include not only how many 
people are engaging with your content but who they are, where they live, 
how old they are, and what content grabbed their attention the most.
You can access Facebook Insights from the top-center of your page, in the 
Admin panel. Facebook curates — and displays in Facebook Insights — valu­
able data about your audience and your content, and how the two engage 
together. The three primary measurement categories are

✓	Engaged Users: The number of fans who engage with your content by 
clicking on it
	
✓	Talking About This: The number of fans who engage with you or your 
content by commenting on it or liking or sharing it
To become more efficient with your time and energy, you need to understand 
where your platform is succeeding and which areas of it might still need 
work. Facebook Insights can help you do that.
	
Set aside time weekly or biweekly to understand what is working for your 
Facebook page and to determine which parts need adjustments from day to 
day. Conduct a monthly analysis of your progress based on your Facebook 
Insights to see the big-picture view of what’s working and what isn’t.

W

e love Twitter. Is that a fair way to start this chapter? Sure, we’re 
slightly biased because we both can draw a direct link between 
our enthusiastic and regular use of this platform to a boost in our personal 
brands and a strengthening of relationships that have been invaluable to our 
careers and businesses. And Danielle has Twitter to thank for launching her 
career in this space as it was through conversations on this platform that she 
developed in-person relationships that led to some of her first correspondent 
work — including being sent to the Vancouver Olympics on behalf of P&G’s 
Thank You, Mom campaign in 2010. Thank you, Twitter.
On Twitter, you can engage with the people you need in order to move for­
ward in your business — and it happens in real time, 24 hours a day, seven 
days a week. You tweet via 140 character messages — sharing thoughts, 
quotes, inspiration, links and general conversation. This platform doesn’t 
break for Christmas or Hanukah, and it doesn’t stop when you get sick or 
experience a natural disaster.
In this chapter, we walk you through the best ways to maximize your time on 
Twitter and ensure that your community embraces — and interacts with — 
you and your brand. By knowing the best ways to engage, you measure your 
time in quality engagements, in actual conversations that members of your 
community find relatable. Whether you’re discussing the topics that matter 
the most to members of your community, offering incentives for them to 
visit your site, or simply proving that you’re more than a brand, they want to 
come to you as you ditch quantity for quality.

Engaging in Real-Time via Twitter
“I don’t care what a stranger had for lunch!” stresses Danielle’s father, 
through gritted teeth, summing up what seems to be an entire generation’s 
take on Twitter. Rather than deliberate the number of people who do, in fact, 
share what they ate for lunch (and the many more who do, in fact, appreci­
ate it), we do our best to explain to you why you might care what a random 
stranger had for lunch.
In social media engagement (SME), the people sharing their lunch plans, 
news of their children’s lost teeth, descriptions of their favorite wines, 
breathtaking pictures of storms rolling in, or quotes from a favorite poet are 
giving you a front-row seat to who they are, to what interests them, and to 
how you might engage them if you’re interested.
And any of these people just might be the connection you need, the customer 
you’re seeking, or the follower who will pay attention to what you have to say 
as well.
By far, one of the greatest benefits of Twitter is its real-time reach. If an earth­
quake strikes California, an uprising begins in the Middle East, the supply 
of the iPhone begins to run short, a beloved celebrity passes away, or your 
favorite restaurant runs a special, Twitter is the place to find the news first, 
as shown in Figure 10-1. The people who use Twitter are creating a space 
where they’re reporting what they see, acting as citizen journalists, engaging 
with each other, and creating business connections like never before.

 Chapter 10: Twitter
Understanding how individuals, brands, 
and small businesses use Twitter
According to Dictionary.com, engage means “to attract and hold fast.” 
Certainly this definition specifies how all of us would love for people in our 
digital spaces to respond to us and to the content we share.
We’re sure it doesn’t surprise you to read that you have a variety of ways to 
use Twitter successfully — and unsuccessfully — for social media engage­
ment. We want to highlight the most effective Twitter use strategies, all of 
which start with choosing to care about the people on the other end of your 
tweets: those you want to respond to you.
	
As people can do in traditional conversation, people who follow you on 
Twitter can sense when you’re being disingenuous. A quick look at your 
Twitter stream indicates whether you’re having conversations: Do you have 
any @replies (pronounced “at replies”)? In other words, are you having a con­
versation by using the @ and someone’s name? Or are you simply repeating 
your sales messages — broadcasting — and not using an @ in the hope that 
someone will “buy” whatever you’re selling?
Consider Twitter as an opportunity for you to find the people who share your 
interests and who will want to evangelize your message, and for whom you 
will want to do the same. Twitter is a give-and-take concept: For every mes­
sage you put out there, seek out the nuggets in other people’s content that 
you can to pass on to your community.
Sharing what you like to do
When you share good content, people want to follow you and connect with 
you. It’s human nature: People simply can’t help being drawn to others who 
capture their attention. Sharing can be as simple as letting people know your 
business-related interests — technology, the latest iPhone news, stocks, real 
estate tips, or how-to fashion tips.
Or you can use Twitter in a more personal way, by tweeting a song, movie, or 
wine recommendation, by sharing a recipe, or by letting people see photos 
from a recent vacation. The more conversational you are, the more you 
invite people to connect with you and to respond. The information you share 
should be in line with the image you want to project. Even a business can 
benefit from conveying a personal touch.

Beware of broadcasters who only spew forth links (typically, only to their own 
content) in the hope that someone will click. Their Twitter streams contain 
only promotional tweets and little to no conversation with individuals (and 
therefore no @ signs). To address an individual, you direct tweet by adding 
the @ sign before the person’s Twitter handle. For example, Danielle would 
tweet to Aliza like this: 
Writing Social Media Engagement for Dummies with you @AlizaSherman 
has been just as much fun as I imagined.
However, if Danielle was only broadcasting about this book repeatedly, she 
would use different versions of this tweet: 
Writing Social Media Engagement For Dummies has been a tough but 
rewarding process (www.amazon.com/Engagement-Dummies-
Business-Personal-Finance/dp/1118530195/ref=sr_1_1?ie=U
TF8&qid=1365029805&sr=8-1&keywords=social+media+engagem
ent+for+dummies)
Listening to determine who’s talking about you and your industry
Identifying who is mentioning you in the Twitter stream is an important task 
to address every day. Use Twitter search tools to locate customers who 
already have something to say about you, and make an effort to respond 
promptly. If someone praises you on Twitter, you have an excellent oppor­
tunity to express gratitude, to humanize your brand and to keep customers 
coming back. If someone tweets a critique, on the other hand, it’s also an 
opportunity: Let them know that you hear their concern and care enough to 
respond and that they matter to you and your business. In this day and age, 
consumers expect these interactions from brands.
Seeking and finding specific topics
Is your business selling wine? Graphical design work? Yoga classes? Leverage 
the myriad ways you can search on Twitter for the people who are already 
talking about these topics to find new people to follow, to join conversations 
with people who share your personal and business interests, and to connect 
to the people who are the ideal targets for your message.
For example, try searching for family vacation Florida if you’re a travel agent 
or a business owner who wants to target families as they arrive in your state. 
When you find a related conversation, join in — but avoid the hard sell. 
Rather than send a canned response with a pitch and a link to your site, seize 
the opportunity to create a relationship by asking questions: When is the 
family thinking about traveling? Where in Florida do they want to go? Have 
they been there before? Let them know that you’re happy to help them make 
decisions if they need it.

 Chapter 10: Twitter
Promoting your message
You have a business message that you want people to see. Eighty percent of 
the content you “promote” should be useful, informative, and engaging but 
not necessarily promotional, and the remaining 20 percent should consist of 
your marketing and sales messages. This way, your audience relies on you as 
a trusted voice in your field without feeling the push of a hard sell every time 
they hear from you.
Ideally, your followers rely on you as someone who curates and publishes 
worthwhile content. Aim to become a valuable resource for others, to be 
known as an expert in your business field.
If you’re posting five times a day, make one or two tweets promotional, or 
link to your own resources. Though it’s certainly acceptable to share good 
news, don’t overwhelm your audience with too much “me-me-me.”
	
To avoid the appearance of insincerity, avoid the humble brag: Though it’s 
certainly good for a laugh, it’s a tweeter’s way of boasting while feigning humil­
ity. One Twitter account exclusively retweets — a retweet occurs whenever 
a tweet is repeated by someone else — the tweets of people who head down 
this patchy road. In Figure 10-2, you can see what to avoid — and how not to 
appear insincere.

Adding a visual hook
Adding visual elements is an effective way to humanize you and your brand. 
Don’t simply tell the audience that you make to-die-for cinnamon rolls — 
show them. (Or in the case of homemade cinnamon rolls from Cedar Creek 
Center, make their mouths water, as shown in Figure 10-3.) Similarly, don’t 
tell your community that you’re planning three brand-new photo shoots this 
weekend — show them the highlights.
	
Figure 10-3: 
Can you see 
why these 
homemade 
cinnamon 
rolls from 
Cedar Creek 
Center in 
Missouri

effective 
tweet?
	
	
Add a see-what-I-mean image to your tweet! Telling everyone that a brand-new 
restaurant was packed on opening weekend sounds great. Showing them the 
line snaking out the door makes them wonder what they’re missing. Never 
underestimate the power of show-and-tell.
You can use any number of applications to upload photos to Twitter. The 
tools described in this list integrate with Twitter to help you enhance your 
tweets with images:
	
✓	Instagram: (http://instagram.com) Offers a popular image-sharing 
network with a highly engaged community. With Instagram, you can 
share pictures not only on Twitter but also on other social networks.

✓	Twitgoo: (http://twitgoo.com) Gives you another opportunity to 
share pictures easily. You can upload from your computer or directly 
from another app.
	
✓	Twitpic: (www.twitpic.com) Helps you easily share photos and videos 
on Twitter by giving you the option to upload directly from your phone 
or via an e-mail address.
	
✓	yFrog: (www.yfrog.com) Provides tools for sharing photos and videos 
on Twitter. Simply take pictures and send them.
Asking a question
When you ask a question, you raise a digital sign telling your community 
that you value their input. Questions also give you perfect opportunities to 
engage immediately in conversations to show that you’re listening and that 
you care.
Ask questions that encourage your community to talk about themselves, to 
give their opinions, or to show off their knowledge. Depending on the number 
of responses you receive, responding to each one may seem to be a daunting 
task, but don’t miss out on any opportunity to connect for fear of respond­
ing too much or too little. You’ll acquire the skills over time — and incorpo­
rate the tools — to help you manage responses from a growing community. 
See the later sections “Measuring Twitter engagement” and “Being ‘present’ 
even when you’re not” for information on specific tools that can help manage 
your Twitter communications.
Keep these concepts in mind when you tweet questions:
	
✓	Relevance matters. If you typically tweet about business, for example, 
stay on topic. Your community will know what to expect from you and 
be more willing to respond.
	
✓	Responsiveness reigns. If seven people respond to you, make it your 
mission to reply to all seven. If the size of your following and your typi­
cal engagement level mean that 75 people respond, you still need to be 
present and responsive. To manage the load, choose a handful of people 
to receive an individual response, reply to a group at once, retweet a 
few answers that resonate, and even send out the more general message 
“Thank you for all of your responses.” Your community needs to know 
that you’re listening and that you appreciate their feedback.
	
✓	Retweeting should be simple. If you limit questions to 120 characters, 
your followers can more easily retweet them the old-fashioned way — 
by adding the letters RT in front. Some may still opt to click the Retweet 
link; however, people will always choose the simplest method. See the 
upcoming step list for an easy, old-style retweeting option.

✓	Flexibility can expand your reach. Repeat a question at different times 
and intervals, for example, so that you can reach more members of your 
community. People use Twitter at varying times, so repeating questions 
increases your exposure and your opportunity to engage. You may even 
learn an important piece of information — the time of day that your 
community is most active — so that you can more strategically post 
messages.
You have several choices for retweeting directly from Twitter or from appli­
cations such as TweetDeck and HootSuite — two applications that connect to 
Twitter, allowing you to streamline your activity and follow multiple conver­
sations at one time. We discuss TweetDeck and HootSuite in more detail later 
in this chapter, in the sections “Being ‘present’ even when you’re not” and 
“Building connections via lists and columns.”
Follow these steps to make an old-style retweet (Aliza’s personal preference) 
from Twitter:
	
1.	Open the tweet you want to repeat.
	
2.	Copy the tweet by highlighting the text and pressing Ctrl+C.
	
3.	Paste it in the message area by pressing Ctrl+P.
	
4.	Move the cursor to the beginning of the text and type the letters RT (to 
indicate that this is a retweet).
	
5.	(Optional) To share your opinion, add quotation marks around the 
tweet or type a note or thought in front of the letters RT.
	
6.	Click Enter or Send.
	
	 This tweet (a repeat of someone else’s original tweet) will now originate 
from your account, with the other person’s Twitter username or handle, 
and will be visible to all your followers. Alternatively, you can click the 
Retweet button to send the tweet as a standard retweet (without com­
ment or opinion), as shown in Figure 10-4.
Check out Twitter For Dummies (written by Laura Fitton, Michael Gruen, and 
Leslie Poston and published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.) for more details on 
retweets and retweeting.
Conveying who you are on Twitter
When spending time engaging on Twitter, give your followers and potential 
followers a clear idea of your personality and intentions — who you are, what 
you do, and how and why you do it. Are you funny, serious, or silly? Do you 
intend to inspire, educate, or motivate? Are you in-the-know, the first of your 
friends or business associates to break news, or a thought leader with valu­
able information to share? Being clear about who you are helps the digital 
community connect with you and your message.

Retweeting

Being your authentic self
Authentic has become a bit of a buzzword in social media marketing. The 
term is used to describe many “wants” in life, such as an “authentic relation­
ship” or “authenticity” from businesses. Consumers want the real deal. The 
same is true of their digital presence in social networks.
These tips can help you “keep it real:”
	
✓	Allow your personality to drive your content. If you’re a no-nonsense, 
just-the-facts kind of person, your content should match that persona. A 
misplaced joke would confuse your followers.
	
✓	Maintain consistency. Suddenly tweeting 45 times a day when your 
followers are used to 5 or choosing to tweet about politics when you 
traditionally stick to business may catch your community off guard. We 
aren’t saying not to be yourself, but consider how your audience might 
respond to sudden deviations from the “you” they’ve come to know.
	
✓	Avoid the hard sell. Moving from a typical engaging conversation into a 
blatant sales pitch can be uncomfortable for your community. They will 
recognize a friendly “Hello!” that turns into this pushy question: “You 
know what you need?” And most won’t like it.

Part III: Examining the Basic Engagement Tools 
	
✓	Focus on your passion. Let your interests and the passion you feel for 
your mission or cause be the driving force behind the information you 
share. Speaking from the heart makes you attractive to followers. The 
sincerity of your conversation moves them to respond and to act on 
your tweets — and to share what you have to say with others.
Knowing your boundaries
Letting your personality and passion be your guide for tweeting doesn’t 
mean that you should forget how to behave in public. You’re sharing some of 
your interests, and you may have included personal information about your 
family, but some topics should be considered off limits, especially if you rep­
resent a business.
Avoid tweeting about these topics:
	
✓	Intensely personal situations: Examples are divorces, criminal proceed­
ings, and financial issues.
	
✓	Politics or religion: Avoid these classic argument-starters unless you’re 
already known for engaging in these areas.
	
✓	Libel: Defaming someone in a tweet can come back to haunt you.
	
✓	Hate speech of any kind: Just don’t do it.
If you represent a business, keep it in mind while you’re tweeting. As an 
employee, your tweets can be mistaken or interpreted as the opinions of your 
employers, so watch what you say. Overall, we recommend steering away 
from negative tweets unless it’s part of your brand to be snarky or snide or 
anything less than positive.
If you employ others, establish guidelines for your employees and contrac­
tors to determine what they should and shouldn’t tweet. Put the guidelines 
in writing, and ask staff to sign off on them. Clearly state the repercussions 
of violating the guidelines for Twitter or any other social network or public 
space online.
	
Don’t drink and tweet. Don’t party hard, take a picture, and tweet it. Twitter 
has no Do Over or Take Back button. Even if you press Delete seconds after 
you’ve mistweeted, someone somewhere may have taken a screen shot. What 
happens during your off-hours is best left untweeted. Put your phone away 
until the morning after. You’ll be grateful that you did.

 Chapter 10: Twitter
Devising a plan to keep up with 
fast-moving conversations
Twitter moves fast, and keeping up with it can be difficult. We would be lying 
if we told you anything else. We would also be lying if we told you it’s possi­
ble to keep up with 500 or 5,000 followers without dedicating time and paying 
attention. Quite simply, there’s no substitute for paying attention. Listening 
on Twitter is important. Listening attentively is as important as thoughtfully 
crafting the tweets you publish. Unless you know what is being said and who 
is saying it, it’s impossible to determine what to do next. That requires a plan.
Like any social media engagement you employ, Twitter requires planning, 
to keep up with the flow of conversation. If you’ve ever watched a Twitter 
stream flow past your eyeballs in real time, you know that your brain can 
barely register a single tweet before another batch of tweets has taken its place.
To create a master plan, follow these guidelines:
	
✓	Know who is in charge of your account. Decide whether one person or 
multiple people will keep up with your company’s account. Then a desig­
nated person or team can familiarize themselves with the flow of conver­
sation and develop a rapport with the people who engage with you the 
most. Your most frequent and interactive Twitter followers deserve the 
most attention, and someone who is familiar with your account comes 
to know these favorites.
	
✓	Schedule regular, uninterrupted “Twitter-time.” Set specific times 
during the day to engage and, if necessary, specific days during the week 
when interaction is at its peak. Avoid jumping online for five minutes, 
asking a single question, and then disappearing for the next six hours. 
Plan out specific time slots for Twitter engagement, and check back fre­
quently enough to respond when someone communicates with you.
	
✓	Prioritize responses. If you have only a certain amount of time on any 
given day, give top priority to people in your community who actively 
listen and engage with you. Reply to everyone who has tweeted to you, 
and take the time to reach out to a few new people who share your inter­
ests so that they know you’re paying attention. People like to be recog­
nized and feel that they matter. Outreach on Twitter can help you make 
that kind of connection.
	
To ensure that your account remains relevant and useful, “sweep” it periodi­
cally to uncover — and unfollow — dormant accounts and spammers. You can 
use Twit Cleaner (http://thetwitcleaner.com) or ManageFlitter (www.
manageflitter.com) to find out which of the people you follow haven’t 
tweeted in the past six months or more or who might be using Twitter as a 
spamming forum.

Part III: Examining the Basic Engagement Tools 
Measuring Twitter engagement
At the end of the day, yelling into an empty canyon ensures that the only 
response you receive is the echo of your own voice. And that, friend, means 
that you’re doing it wrong — stop and assess how you’re using Twitter. On 
the other hand, if you’re seeing an uptick in the number of people who follow 
you or the number of times your content is shared, responded to, or favor­
ited, or if your bottom line is moving in the right direction, continue doing 
more of what you’re doing. Measuring your engagement on Twitter helps you 
assess how this platform is affecting your success in this space.
This list describes several popular Twitter measurement tools:
	
✓	bitly: (https://bitly.com) Shortens links to allow for maximum 
reach — because your tweets can be easily shared. Each URL you 
shorten is specific to you and can be tracked for statistics. You can use 
bit.ly metrics to see how many people clicked a particular link and how 
often it was shared.
	
✓	Buffer: (http://bufferapp.com) Analyzes every tweet you send, tell­
ing you whether someone favorited it, retweeted it, or clicked the link. 
As a multipurpose app, it also schedules your tweets at optimal tweeting 
times.
	
✓	Tweet grader: (http://tweet.grader.com) Ranks the power of your 
Twitter profile against millions of others in your city and in specific 
categories. It’s particularly helpful in determining how you measure up 
against other tweeters in your local area.
	
✓	TweetReach: (http://tweetreach.com) Measures the number of 
accounts your tweets reach over a certain period and the tweets that 
received the most attention, and showcases the people who are most 
often sharing your content.
	
✓	Twitter Counter: (http://twittercounter.com) Allows you to 
closely track followers. You can see how many followers you’ve gained 
or lost on any given day. Noting the peaks and valleys of your following 
gives you insight into what may or may not have worked when you were 
tweeting. You can also use the search function to find and follow people 
in a specific category.
	
You may be tempted to try to use all these tools to measure engagement, but 
you will drown in data and numbers. Spend a little time exploring the benefits 
and limitations of each one as it applies to you and your business, and then 
choose the one or two that make the most sense for your specific needs.

 Chapter 10: Twitter
Making an Impact in the Twitter Stream
What you say in social networks matters to your business, and you hope it 
matters to the people who are following you. To fully engage with your com­
munity on Twitter and to capture your followers’ attention and keep them 
coming back for more, use wisely the 140 characters per tweet that you’re 
allotted.
Now we want to share ways to maximize your impact with each tweet: Gain 
more shares for your content, engage more deeply with followers, and grow 
a community that meets your expectations and helps you achieve tangible 
business goals.
	
Avoid “text speak” in your tweets, and use proper grammar and spelling to 
avoid sounding either careless or uneducated (or both). For starters, resist 
the temptation to replace the word you with the letter u (the extra time that 
you believe you’re gaining by not typing the other two letters won’t counter­
act the bad impression you’re creating) and, for the love of all things, remem­
ber the difference between your and you’re. (The former indicates possession, 
the latter is a contraction of you are.)
Crafting attention-grabbing tweets 
After you know how to measure the rate at which your tweets are being 
shared and how to see on which days you gained more followers than normal 
(find out how to keep track in Chapter 2), consider the following principles 
to maximize your Twitter social media engagement — and to maintain your 
authenticity:
	
✓	Know the numbers. You may already know that a tweet consists of 140 
characters or fewer. Deduct 20 characters from that total. Consider 120 
characters the new “magic number” for tweets. In addition to provid­
ing stellar content, make it easy for others to retweet you, by requiring 
little or no editing. Those 20 extra characters make room for the retweet 
(RT), such as when someone else “reshares” the tweet you have sent, 
your follower’s Twitter name, and maybe even a short comment. If 
someone uses the retweet link, the shorter tweets don’t matter — but 
you’re catering to those who might not.
	
✓	Shorten your links. Shortening links allows you to have more room 
within the 120-character limit and to track your tweets if you use a ser­
vice such as bit.ly.

Part III: Examining the Basic Engagement Tools 
	
✓	Add attention-grabbing headings. Extra! Extra! Think about the words 
that grab attention and use them in your tweets. Be concise and compel­
ling. Assume that you have one shot to grab someone’s attention — and 
that shot should lead to a click on your content.
	
✓	Play to people’s emotions. Consider the positive energy you can gener­
ate when you decide to include good news in your stream every week. 
Create a Twitter account that people want to follow for the good feel­
ing it brings into their day. Understand the power of people’s feelings. 
Humor makes us human and makes us laugh and feel connected. Share 
a picture of a baby panda, and people will probably fall all over them­
selves to pass it along. A good quote can evoke emotions, and many are 
frequently retweeted on Twitter.
	
✓	Use hashtags. Adding the hashtag (#) in a tweet includes it in the conver­
sation or search results related to that keyword. The hashtags you use 
identify you within a given community and make you visible to anyone 
following that topic. When you watch the #Emmys or the #WorldSeries 
or talk about #MS (multiple sclerosis) or #leukemia, you raise your vir­
tual hand to say, “I’m here” and “I want to be part of this conversation.” 
However, be careful not to use hashtags indiscriminately or to spam 
others.
	
	A hashtag is a keyword that starts with the hash mark or pound sign (#) to 
identify and group a conversation or a group of related tweets on Twitter. 
For more about hashtags, refer to Twitter For Dummies, written by Laura 
Fitton, Michael Gruen, and Leslie Poston (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).
	
✓	Promote others. Include other people’s content in your tweets, and 
give them credit to let them know that you’re listening and that you 
care enough about what they say to share it with your following. Giving 
kudos increases your own profile as well as those you retweet and ref­
erence. You become an authority based on the content you curate and 
recommend. Be someone on Twitter who provides quality content and 
who is willing to champion others.
Getting noticed is one thing — inspiring a reaction is your goal. Ideally, your 
followers monitor your progress online, but more than that, they share your 
wisdom with others. On Twitter, the holy grail of sharing is the retweet because 
it shows that a follower likes what you have to say enough to share it with their 
followers. A retweet says, I read this, loved it, and think you should too!
Leveraging links to get results
Engaging with your community on Twitter consists of equal parts showcasing 
the “real you” and building trust to work toward a goal by driving awareness 
of, and interactions with, your business. The interactions may be customers 
who purchase from you, but more often they’re word-of-mouth results as 
your followers spread the word about you or your company, brand, prod­
ucts, or services.

 Chapter 10: Twitter
One outstanding way to inspire people to click the links you tweet is to fea­
ture content that educates, motivates, or inspires. Share the content you 
create, such as blog posts or articles, and link to that content. Find and share 
content from others that is relevant to your business and that may be of 
interest to your followers.
When you share memorable and moving information, your community 
becomes a willing evangelist for you — spreading your message and carrying 
your content beyond your initial boundaries. They do this not only because 
they like what you have to say but also because they appreciate how you 
operate.
As your followers become accustomed to you sharing their content and the 
content of others in addition to your own, they begin to trust that what they 
Boosting your retweet potential
If your goal is engagement, it makes sense to 
reach as many people as possible with your 
message, thoughts, and conversation. The 
more engaging your initial tweet, the greater 
potential for your content to be passed along.
Follow these tips to inspire followers to retweet 
more of your tweets:
	✓	Limit tweets to 120 characters. Sure, Twitter 
gives you 140 characters at a time to express 
your thoughts, but limiting the length of a 
tweet slightly makes it easier to retweet.
	✓	Tweet important tweets more than once. 
You can even tweet critical messages sev­
eral times a day. Your followers who miss 
them the first time around will appreciate the 
extra opportunity to see your latest content.
	✓	Tweet breaking news. If you’re one of the 
first people to share about the latest earth­
quake in California, a politician’s gaffe, or a 
celebrity’s most recent escapade, your con­
tent is sure to be shared. The news should 
originate from a reliable source, however, 
before you pass it along — you don’t want 
to be caught sharing a rumor. Also, the news 
that you share should align with your image 
and be relevant to your audience.
	✓	Express gratitude. When people retweet 
your content, say “Thank you” to encour­
age them to come back for more. People 
love to be seen and heard on Twitter and 
on any other social network.
	✓	Schedule tweets during peak hours. Yes, at 
certain times during the day, more people 
are tweeting. Fewer people are on Twitter 
in the wee hours of the night — unless 
they’re in another time zone and you’re 
targeting an international crowd. People 
tweet differently during the workday versus 
the evening and weekend. According to 
research done by bitly, the peak hours for 
tweeting range between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. 
Monday through Thursday. When schedul­
ing tweets, consider the time zones of the 
people you’re trying to reach.
	✓	Tweet amazing content. Easy enough, 
right? You recognize good content when 
you see it and especially when you see 
the results: This content constitutes your 
most frequently retweeted messages (as 
we explain in the earlier section “Crafting 
attention-grabbing tweets”). Take note of 
the tweets you see most frequently shared.

see from you is quality content. When someone trusts your content, they 
pass those same links along to their own communities, amplifying your 
message.
Retweeting and @mentioning others
We agree that the overall goal on Twitter and on any social network is 
engagement. We also acknowledge that the “end goal” should be a tangible 
outcome that helps your business thrive, such as building a larger customer 
base or increasing your revenue. Though it may seem counterintuitive, you 
can build a stronger and better following by retweeting and mentioning 
others on Twitter, not by talking only about yourself.
The results of retweeting and @mentioning others regularly is that you
	
✓	Build trust: By retweeting relevant content, you build trust with follow­
ers. If they click a link and find it interesting, they’re more likely to click 
again the next time they see you sharing.
	
✓	Meet potential new followers: Retweeting content from someone who 
interests you is a way to let that person know that you’re online and 
paying attention. If they don’t respond to your retweet initially, you can 
begin a conversation with them based on that (or another) topic you 
shared.
	
✓	Convey gratitude: Clicking a link in a tweet is a passive way to say, “I 
find this information interesting” or “I appreciate this story.” It’s a way 
to thank the author of the link for sharing information that you find valu­
able or for being an online presence who enriches your digital space.
	
✓	Contribute to the success of others: Retweeting is a helpful way to say, 
“I think you’re doing something well.” Passing the link on to your own 
community adds your own, personal stamp of approval on it and allows 
you the privilege of adding (you hope) to another’s success.
	
✓	Recognize the value of conversation: It’s pretty darn difficult to have 
a conversation on Twitter if you never use the @ sign to talk to anyone. 
You should be using this symbol to reply to the people who have sent 
you tweets, to communicate with the people who are on your “must 
follow” lists, and to start conversations with people you find interesting.
	
If you send a message that starts with the @ sign, the only people who will see 
that message are the people who are following both you and the person you’re 
tweeting. To make that message visible to all your followers to include them 
in the conversation, place a word in front of the @ sign and the name — for 
example, “Thank you @AlizaSherman, for keeping me on track while writing 
our book.” If I remove the text thank you, a large percentage of my followers 
won’t see the tweet. Some people place a period (.) in front of the @ sign to 
achieve the same result, but that method is awkward and less personal.

 Chapter 10: Twitter
Being “present” even when you’re not
One key to successful social media engagement is, of course, engaging with 
others. We want to be realistic as well and make sure that you can manage 
your Twitter account. Making an impact on Twitter usually requires far more 
content than on most other social networks. What we’re about to tell you 
may seem to fly directly in the face of engagement, but we want you to know 
how to automate your tweets — some of your tweets, that is. Take everything 
in moderation, and automation is no exception. Don’t let the tips and tools 
described in this section replace the time you spend interacting; instead, 
they can help you share more — and more often.
	
Schedule tweets that contain the strategic messages you want to be sure to 
post, but that you may not remember to post. Make 80 percent of your tweets 
nonpromotional, and put automation to good use to schedule the remaining 
20 percent.
It’s impossible to be on Twitter all day. Yet sometimes in a 24-hour period, you 
would love for your content to reach the people who might be most interested, 
even though you’re busy with work and life. Even though you aren’t sitting in 
front of your computer or tweeting from your phone at any given time, your 
community may still be online and be receptive to your messages.
Scheduling tweets can come in handy and accomplish a number of goals:
	
✓	Maximize your exposure. Planning tweets to hit at different times 
during the day allows you to reach a wider audience. If you’re able to be 
online only at 8 a.m., your messages may not reach someone jumping on 
Twitter in the afternoon or evening. By scheduling a few messages to hit 
at various times of the day, you can get more exposure for your content.
	
✓	Maintain a consistent message. Scheduling tweets requires you to plan 
ahead. Planning ahead helps you stay on track with your messaging. 
Don’t hop online at odd hours and wonder, “What should I say now?” 
Scheduling tweets puts in place a system for you to be more thoughtful 
about your tweets.
	
✓	Remain visible. You’ve heard the saying “Out of sight, out of mind,” 
right? As clichéd as it sounds, you want to remain “top of mind” to your 
audience. The more you’re seen online with a consistent, relevant mes­
sage, the more likely people will notice your tweets and remember you. 
Even if they don’t engage with you immediately, you’re building your 
brand recognition.
	
✓	Save time. Automating some of your tweets should prevent you from 
jumping online 27 times throughout the day. You can focus instead on 
being productive and ensure that time-sensitive tweets are strategically 
placed to highlight events and activities without having to watch the 
clock. In theory, you can better manage your time knowing that a bit of 
the burden of frequent tweeting is lifted from you.

Part III: Examining the Basic Engagement Tools 
	
Scheduling tweets doesn’t let you walk away from Twitter and never have to 
engage. Even after you have set tweets in motion, you must set aside time to 
check in on your Twitter community. If people have referenced you in conver­
sation or shared your content, you can’t acknowledge them or respond if 
you’re never there. You’ll lose followers, or at least lose their interest and 
attention.
These popular apps can help you schedule tweets:
	
✓	TweetDeck: (www.tweetdeck.com) Schedule days in advance, at any 
point throughout the day, and maintain columns and categories of lists 
of people you don’t want to miss.
	
✓	HootSuite: (http://hootsuite.com) In addition to setting tweets in 
advance, save even more time with this bulk scheduler. It’s also inte­
grated with Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google+ (see more in Chapters 9, 
12, and 13, respectively).
	
✓	Buffer: (http://bufferapp.com) Run analytics to determine the best 
times of day for your tweets to post, and then schedule them accord­
ingly. This app offers free and upgraded (paid) versions.
	
✓	IFTTT: (https://ifttt.com) We call this app a miracle automation 
tool. Use If This Then That to send out tweets triggered by specific 
actions. For example, “If I share a new item in my Google Reader, post it 
to Twitter” or “If this person I follow tweets a link, retweet it.” The com­
binations of actions triggering tweets are seemingly endless.
Increasing Engagement 
via Twitter Features
Conversation is both a goal and a reward of being active on Twitter. When 
you tweet and someone else responds, you know that you’re being heard, 
that your message is relevant, and that the people who are following you are 
interested and attentive.
Of course, you want to keep those interactions alive and turn them into 
actions such as clicking your links and sharing your content. In addition to 
dedicating time and energy, you must be willing to try new strategies to con­
tinually improve how you use Twitter.
Giving kudos using Favorites
The Favorite link on Twitter serves several purposes. It’s a way for you to 
let someone you’re following know that you value her content. That person

 Chapter 10: Twitter
receives a notice every time you favorite one of her tweets. It’s a helpful way 
to make a connection. Similar to retweeting, favoriting carries your personal 
stamp of approval. However, unlike a retweet, which eventually drops off 
your Twitter stream, a favorited tweet remains on your Favorites list on your 
main Twitter page for all to see.
Many people use Twitter favorites as sort of a bookmarking function to save 
information that they want to read or access later. Though it’s handy, keep in 
mind that you’re saving those tweets in a publicly accessible archive that’s 
attached to your Twitter account.
	
If you favorite a tweet to save it for later reading and then decide that 
you don’t want it archived or displayed on your account, simply click the 
Favorited link (next to the star) to “unfavorite” it and remove it from the 
Favorites list.
	
If you haven’t used the favoriting feature in a while, look through the tweets 
you have saved to ensure that they’re an appropriate fit for you and your 
brand. If not, unfavorite them.
Building connections via lists and columns
Lists and columns on Twitter come in handy for not only the purpose of 
keeping track of the people you’re already following but also to create con­
nections and nurture new relationships. Start your Twitter list-making by 
aggregating (collecting) the names of people you must follow — whether this 
list consists of the people who engage with you the most, who are the best 
advocates for you and your business, or who simply share the content that 
you don’t want to miss.
	
Twitter lists can be public (by default) or private. Public lists should be based 
on topics or categories that make sense for you to share with others. Private 
lists are useful for helping you keep track without publicizing your intention to 
the world.
Creating lists and columns
No matter how many people you’re following, you cannot keep up with all of 
them. In your business, your goal is to create meaningful connections with 
potential customers, make contact with people who are influential in your 
field, and strengthen relationships with the people who already love you and 
your brand. Though it sounds like a lot of people, it still won’t be everyone 
who is following you.
One effective way to keep up with the people who matter the most to you and 
your business is to create lists and columns. You can create a list in Twitter 
to follow people whom you group based on a specific topic. Lists can be cre­
ated on any platform, including traditional Twitter (www.twitter.com). A

Helpful uses for the Favorites feature
The Favorites list on your Twitter page is more 
than an archive of tweets and articles you hope 
to read someday. It is a tool that allows your 
followers to learn more about you — what 
interests you, what you find worth starring, and, 
if used correctly, it can highlight what tweets 
of yours have been found noteworthy by your 
followers. 
	✓	Endorsements: If someone tweets 
something kind about you, writes an article 
about you, or quotes you in a media piece, 
favorite it. Use your Favorites list as a 
testimonial page for you and your company. 
When you favorite these types of tweets, 
your Favorites list becomes a supplement 
to your Twitter Bio.
	✓	Backgrounder: Keep track of the links and 
tweets that help tell your story and convey 
your message. This list is an additional 
guide for potential new followers to let 
them know more about you by the tweets 
you favorite.
	✓	Market Research: Pay attention to which of 
your tweets is a favorite of your followers. 
Every time your tweets are favorited, you 
strike gold. You’re being told, “I like what 
you’ve said,” and it’s your cue to do more 
of what resonates with your followers. 
Keep track of your tweets that others have 
favorited over time to determine what 
common denominators, if any, are making 
those messages more popular than the rest.
list is typically a way to group individual people by category: fitness, break­
ing news, parenting, social media, or real estate, for example. A list lets you 
follow a specific conversation and can help you access tweets from others 
based on a topic area. You don’t have to follow someone in order to place the 
person on a Twitter list, so lists also help you clear the clutter in your Twitter 
stream.
A column, on the other hand, is the traditional way to group followers on 
specific applications, such as TweetDeck and HootSuite. These two apps let 
you add individuals to columns, or delete them, to make it easier to keep up 
with conversations. Again, a column may be based on a category, or it can 
be dedicated to an individual. For example, Danielle might have a column on 
TweetDeck dedicated entirely to Aliza so that she never misses a tweet that 
Aliza sends out. But Danielle may also have a separate column that includes 
brilliant minds that she likes to follow — and Aliza would be one of them.
Both applications let you create lists based on whatever categories are rel­
evant to you, and they can help you hone in on specific conversations.
	
Create a category or list with a search for your company name, your Twitter 
username, and any common variation of your brand name in case people 
mention you without including your username or abbreviate or misspell your 
business name. Having these additional columns ensures that you see what 
is being said about you on Twitter and provides you with the opportunity to 
interact with the people who are talking about you.

Part III: Examining the Basic Engagement Tools 
Creating additional lists outside your obvious circles lets you discover 
people and form new connections. The thought leaders in your industry, 
for example, may be people with whom you want to connect. Follow them, 
add them to a public list to get on their radar, and then check the list to pay 
closer attention to what they’re sharing. Share their content or @mention 
them to get noticed and spark conversations.
Creating lists using third-party tools
Increase your online visibility by adding yourself to Twitter lists via third-
party applications. Many of these tools are organized by topic or location. 
The beauty of this strategy is that people who share your interests and 
search by proximity can discover you as easily as you can find them.
Here are a few of our favorite Twitter list tools:
	
✓	JustTweetIt: (http://justtweetit.com) Find Twitter users like you 
with a series of labeled categories. You can search yourself and list yourself.
	
✓	Listorious: (http://listorious.com) Search for people on Twitter 
by the topics they specify or by their cities or professions. Add yourself 
where relevant.
	
✓	Twellow: (www.twellow.com) By letting you click a map to locate 
people in nearby towns, this app connects you to people locally and by 
category. Like the others, you can list yourself and seek out people who 
you believe would be good connections.
	
✓	WeFollow: (http://wefollow.com) This Twitter directory is organized 
by tags and categories. Users list themselves in individual categories 
and are then displayed by their number of followers. An increase in 
followers can mean a moving up the list.
Getting personal with a 
direct message (DM)
Your followers have, presumably, some interest in engaging with you, so 
sending one of them a direct message — no links allowed — with a compliment 
about a post or with a customized thank-you message for a retweet or 
another form of praise can help you begin a more personal conversation.
	
You can send direct messages only to your followers. Use that trust wisely.
	
Do not use direct messages to send links to personal promotional pages, résu­
més, or bios, such as your Facebook page or sales pitch. You most certainly 
wouldn’t attach your business card to the outside of your coat and begin talk­
ing about yourself with every stranger you meet, so don’t do it online.

 Chapter 10: Twitter
The direct message has come under attack from an influx of spam. Hackers 
can worm their way into your account by using deceptive direct messages 
(DMs), like the one shown in Figure 10-5, and make everyone more wary of 
receiving them. For example, you receive what appears to be an inflamma­
tory DM suggesting that you’ve been spotted in some compromising pictures 
or that your site is under attack or an equally nerve-wracking circumstance, 
so you click the link and give the spammer access to your password and 
account. It’s the domino effect: The same message you received is then sent 
to many of your followers from your account. You can easily see how any DM 
with a link in it can become suspect. If you aren’t 100 percent sure, always 
reply to the sender first to verify that the link was sent to you intentionally. 
Your only defense is a strong offense: Do not open the link.
	
Figure 10-5: 
A spam 
tweet like 
this one 
is almost 
certainly 
hacker 
spam.
	
	
Never send an automatic direct message when someone begins following you. 
Even though you might be sending what you perceive to be a stab at initial 
engagement, a generic “Thank you for following me” message can come across 
as fake and spammy. People often unfollow the senders.
Attracting more followers 
with widgets and buttons
Adding followers can initially feel like Christmas morning. You eagerly 
explore information about each individual, assessing their compatibility with 
you by examining their avatars, their bios, the number of followers they have, 
and the number of people they’re following. When you start out on Twitter, 
you may even take the time to look at the nitty-gritty details — what have 
they had to say for the past week and who are they following.
Now you want more of what you already have: people who are engaged with 
you and with the messages you’re sharing. One way to encourage others to 
follow you on Twitter is to present them with the opportunity where they’re 
already finding your content: on your website, blog, and other social networks.

You can easily add any of these options on Twitter to increase your following 
and increase shares of your content by others:
	
✓	Follow button on your blog: Reminds your community to find and follow 
you on Twitter
	
✓	Sharing button on posts at your blog or website: Lets readers easily pass 
along your content to their communities, as shown in Figure 10-6
	
✓	Widget (Recently Tweeted) on your blog sidebar: Showcases your most 
recent tweets to engage your community in the latest conversations

Twitter now offers not only embeddable tweets but also fully customizable 
and interactive timelines. According to Twitter, your community can now 
follow and reply to you (or — gasp — unfollow you), and can even favorite 
and retweet your tweets, without leaving your website. When customizing an 
embeddable Twitter stream, you can specify the content you pull in as well 
as the size of the widget.
You can embed a custom Twitter stream based entirely on your company’s 
name or #hashtag or a conversation to showcase a specific campaign. In fact, 
with a widget like this one, you can customize the content and size of the 
widget. We can almost see the wheels turning as you think about the possi­
bilities for leveraging Twitter’s interactive timelines.

 Chapter 10: Twitter
Adding Twitter to Facebook 
(and vice versa)
Here’s a social media topic of great debate: should your Twitter and 
Facebook accounts be linked? It’s certainly possible to do so. If you link 
Twitter to Facebook, every time you tweet, the exact same message shows 
up on Facebook. Linking Facebook to Twitter makes every status update you 
post on Facebook automatically appear in your Twitter stream, truncated 
(shortened) to 140 characters.
Setting up these links can save you time, but not every short cut is neces­
sarily worth it. We don’t recommend linking Twitter to Facebook. Twitter 
moves so much more quickly than Facebook with far more messaging, and 
your Facebook followers will likely be turned off by the onslaught of messag­
ing. Also your tweets often contain symbols that aren’t found on Facebook so 
your updates on Facebook will look cluttered with the @ and # characters.
	
After you link Facebook to Twitter, you can’t switch it on and off per update. 
Be careful not to be repetitive by duplicating messages in both places in the 
same or similar timeframe. Linking Twitter and Facebook can be confusing so 
if you choose to do it, manage the process with care.
Consider that some people will follow you on both Twitter and Facebook. On 
one hand, if they see the same verbiage appear in both locations, you won’t look 
organized or “on the ball.” On the other hand, the chances of a person who fol­
lows you in both places seeing you cross post are slim. It isn’t likely that they’ll 
be on both Facebook and Twitter and paying attention to your messages on both 
at the same time. If they see your cross-posts on rare occasion, they’re unlikely 
to hold it against you if they like you and your content in general.
For the most part, people who connect with you in multiple places aren’t con­
necting with you in all those places at the same time. And though you will defi­
nitely have some crossover in your Twitter followers and Facebook friends or 
fans, not everyone will connect with you actively in multiple places.
	
If you’re sure that you want to link your Twitter account to post to Facebook, 
use Selective Tweets (https://facebook.com/selectivetwitter/). 
With this app, not all of your tweets post to Facebook — only the ones you tag 
with #fb.

Accessing Twitter on the go
With the constant go-go-go flow of tweets on Twitter, it shouldn’t surprise 
you that a large percentage of the platform’s users access the site from 
mobile devices. In September of 2011, Twitter announced that 55 percent of 
its traffic originated from mobile devices. However, according to Twitter CEO 
Dick Costolo (http://marketingland.com/twitter-400-million-
tweets-daily-improving-content-discovery-13581) the number 
jumped to a full 60 percent of its 140 million users during the summer of 2012.
The official Twitter mobile app is easy to navigate, and it’s a fairly reliable 
option for tweeting from your device. Though it lacks the special options that 
power users desire, it’s functional. Feel free to experiment with other mobile 
apps for tweeting. Table 10-1 lists options for Twitter mobile apps depending 
on the platform you’re using — Android or iOS.

Conversation is the key. Followers have no interest in engaging with a bot (an 
account masquerading as a real person) that gathers @ replies like trophies. 
This isn’t a game that everyone wins. When you genuinely engage with your 
community, they respond in kind.

P

interest is the fastest-growing social network and boasts a higher per­
centage of female users than the other popular social networks in the 
United States. Even if your target market is not predominantly female, you 
can still benefit from using Pinterest to build your brand and to drive traffic 
to your other sites and social networks. 
We both use Pinterest to build our personal brands as well as to enhance 
what we share on the other social networks we use. We have a Social Media 
Engagement board on our Pinterest profiles that we both contribute to. On 
this board, you can find images that link to articles and additional resources 
on the topic of social media engagement for ongoing learning and inspiration. 
Find our shared Pinterest board by going to http://bit.ly/engage
board. We also have a Pinterest account for our previous book, Mom, 
Incorporated (Sellers Publishing, Inc.), that we use as another means for con­
necting with our specific target audience, in this case, moms. 
In this chapter, you find out how to tap into the power of Pinterest to build 
on the ways you engage with your following and boost your efforts to attract 
an even larger following. For example, we show you how to pin, repin, like, 
and comment on other people’s pins to create connections and reach out to 
your target audience. You also find out how Pinterest users engage versus 
Facebook or Twitter users. (We cover Facebook and Twitter in Chapters 9 
and 10, respectively.)

Creating Connections by Incorporating 
Visual Elements
If a picture is worth 1,000 words, Pinterest is a valuable asset to your online 
marketing efforts. Pinterest’s main features are pins and boards. Pins are 
individual posts of images or video, and boards are the organized collections 
of pins based on categories or themes. The main ways to interact with others 
on Pinterest are to like, repin, or comment on their pins. Pinterest taps into 
the power of images and how they attract our eye or how they make us think 
of or feel something in an instant. 
Knowing how to create the right mix of pins and boards can be the key to 
maximizing the benefit of your Pinterest account.
Preparing your business account
Pinterest offers companies and brands the option to set up a business 
account instead of a personal Pinterest account. In the business section of 
its site (http://business.pinterest.com), it provides a number of case 
studies to get you started. As you set up a profile for your business account, 
Pinterest prompts you to verify your website, a feature also available on per­
sonal accounts. To verify your website, follow the instructions provided by 
Pinterest including placing a unique line of code Pinterest provides onto a 
page on your web server.
Although the features of business and personal profiles are virtually the 
same, the move toward business accounts makes way for new features that 
will benefit brands looking to use Pinterest for marketing and sales. As of 
early 2013, metrics are now a feature offered through business accounts. 
Other anticipated features include promoted pins and boards.
Expect Pinterest to add new features as it matures. To remain competitive 
and to grow, the company has to serve other businesses looking for more 
marketing and sales-oriented features to justify using the network.
	
If you’re already using Pinterest with a personal account, you can convert 
it to a business page by logging into your current account and going to 
http://business.pinterest.com. Click the large red button to “Join as 
a Business,” and your personal account information will populate the form. 
Select a business type from the drop-down menu at the top of the page, add a 
Contact Name, double-check the rest of the information, agree to the Terms of 
Service, and then click the Convert button at the bottom.

 Chapter 11: Pinterest
Setting up the right boards for your brand
If you set up your Pinterest account while the site was still in beta, Pinterest 
gave you a number of default options for your boards’ themes such as Books 
I’m Reading and For the Home. Pinterest no longer prompts you with board 
ideas, so it’s up to you to determine your board-naming strategy to attract 
attention and get followers.
Start with your goals, your audience, and the actions you want them to take; 
then craft board names tied directly to achieving your goals and communi­
cating a clear message. The think-through process for naming your boards 
should go something like this:
	
1.	What are my business goals?
	
	Suppose you run a consulting business and want to build your profile 
so people hire you. Outline business goals that are measurable and get 
more people to notice you such as “increase traffic to my website” and 
“get people to share my content.”
	
2.	Is my target audience on Pinterest, and if so, how are they using it?
	
	You should already be connected to your target audience through 
other popular social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. 
Survey them to see who is on Pinterest. Follow them and observe what 
they pin and how else they leverage Pinterest, such as on their websites. 
	
3.	How can Pinterest help me reach my target audience?
	
	 If you’ve located some of your target audience on Pinterest, interact 
with them to get noticed. Specify how you’ll use Pinterest to attract 
their attention, including leveraging Pinterest on your website and other 
social networks.
	
4.	How can Pinterest help me achieve my business goals?
	
	 If your goals are to increase traffic to your website and to get people to 
share your content, for example, identify the Pinterest activities and fea­
tures directly related to those goals. You can pin images and video from 
your website or link back to your website in pins you upload. Make sure 
your images are compelling so that people repin them and lead others 
back to your content.
	
5.	What topics or keywords are relevant to my business?
	
	 Identify the topics that are most relevant to you based on who you are, 
what you do, and how others might find you. If you’re a social media 
consultant, for example, your keywords should include consultant as 
well as your areas of expertise such as mobile, social media, and social 
networks. Don’t forget broader topics, in this case technology, marketing, 
and business.

Part IV: Engaging Through Additional Social Channels 
	
	 Use clear and related keywords when you name your boards to help 
attract more attention and ensure your Pinterest account shows up in 
relevant search results. Be creative but not too off-the-wall so your 
boards are easy to find.
	
6.	What board names best convey the topics that represent who I am, 
what I do, and what I want to communicate to others?
	
	 When coming up with board names, be creative but also remember 
your keywords. The keyword mobile can be a Make Me Mobile board, 
social networks becomes a Love Social Networks board, and marketing 
becomes a Marketing Tips for Your Business board. Let your personality 
shine through.
Choosing board types
After you come up with great board names, think about the types of boards 
you want to build. We have both made it a priority to include boards that 
highlight our brand messages as well as our personalities. On our Pinterest 
boards, you’re likely to see images that inspire the work we do as well as the 
items that interest us personally: wine, the beach, travel, the landscape of 
rural Alaska, technology, fashion, and our children.
You have various choices for the types of boards you can create on Pinterest:
	
✓	Content-themed: One common type of board represents a content 
theme such as travel, food, or home. Content-themed boards can be 
highly targeted or cover niche topics such as Travel with Kids, Gluten-
free Desserts, and Japanese Gardens. The pins on content-themed 
boards are visually related to a specific topic or theme and should lead 
to relevant source articles, blog posts, or sites. Figure 11-1 shows an 
example of a content-themed board: a wine-related crafts board curated 
by the Wine Sisterhood.

 Chapter 11: Pinterest
	
	Think of the various ways you can directly and indirectly convey your 
message through your boards. The Wine Sisterhood’s parent company 
develops and markets new brands of wine. The crafts it pins to its Wine 
Crafty board are not its own designs, but they are complementary to the 
company’s overall business and appealing to its target market.
	
✓	Event-related: Create an event-related board before an event to promote 
it and use the board during the event as a repository for images from the 
event to drum up awareness and engagement. After the event, add even 
more images and turn the board into a permanent visual archive of the 
event. Use links to the board and pins in posts on other social networks 
to bring people back to the archive.
	
	Figure 11-2 shows a board that documents a film festival where the docu­
mentary film Day in Our Bay was screened. The film’s producers pinned 
photographs live from the film festival that lead back to their website.
	
Figure 11-2: 
Documenting 
a film 
festival. 
	
	
✓	Visual-themed: This type of board is a little less straightforward, but 
really creative. With visual-themed boards, the way an image looks tends 
to be more important than what is represented in the image. Think of 
these boards as eye-candy focused on a common visual aspect in each 
image, such as shape (all triangular things) or color (chartreuse objects).
	
	Figure 11-3 shows a visually themed board with images of the unusual 
icosahedron shape. In this case, designer Sean Dougall devotes a 
Pinterest board to the very unusual icosahedron. The objects in the 
images are of different colors, textures, and sizes, but all contain the 
same complex shape. A visual-themed color board features objects and 
scenes having little more in common than that all are dominated by a 
particular color, such as the board shown in Figure 11-4. Monochromatic 
boards attract the eye and stand out from other boards.

Arranging boards for effect
The way you position your boards on your Pinterest account page can give 
others an immediate impression of not only your interests but also your 
brand image and personality. Rearrange your boards so that the ones you 
want to emphasize are toward the top. The upper boards tend to get the 
most attention and interactions. However, don’t neglect to put content onto 
the boards toward the bottom of your Pinterest page. 
	
Consider building boards purely for their visual impact, such as putting 
together rows or columns of boards to represent frames, borders, or 
separators. The pins on these types of boards are deliberately chosen to 
create specific colors or patterns. 
Put thought into all the types of boards you build. Highly targeted and 
focused boards help you better attract and reach your target audience as 
well as compel that audience to interact with you.

 Chapter 11: Pinterest
Pinning to clearly convey your messages
Knowing a picture can convey meaning, inspire action, or generate emotion, 
what words and thoughts are the images you pin conjuring up in people’s 
minds? When interacting on Pinterest, most users are going on instinct and 
gut reaction, responding to an instantaneous visceral feeling they get from an 
image. Although some pinners are more strategic, the majority of everyday 
Pinterest users are more emotional and less analytical about their pinning 
and repinning habits.
Given the limitations of how people use and interact with pins — and given 
that only a small percentage of users comment on pins — your chances 
of engagement start with clear, distinct images that communicate a mes­
sage. Not everyone will interpret the message you put on Pinterest through 
a pinned image in the same way. Your pin description therefore plays an 
important role in clarifying your message. The destination of your pin, or 
board, should also reinforce your message.
When you pin images and their corresponding content, think about what you 
want others to know about you or your brand. Your boards act as archives 
for your pins, but your pins are the active and current messages you post to 
the Pinterest stream, or pin feed, on a regular basis. You can pin videos — 
your own or other people’s — as well as images to your board. Look for ways 
to incorporate video into your Pinterest stream for increased interactivity.
	
When you upload your own pins, watermark them with a digital watermark or 
type a photo credit or your website URL directly onto each image. Don’t rely 
on the image description to provide your copyright or branding because these 
can be altered or deleted over time.
Move beyond the obvious content and image choices for your boards and 
think about where you want your boards to lead before you start pinning. 
You can modify the link on anything you pin to your boards. If you upload 
your own pins, where you link each image can lead people to the sites and 
social networks where you can further engage with them. Consider sending 
them not only to your blog or website, but to your Facebook or Twitter page 
for increased engagement.
Connecting using pins, repins, 
likes, and comments
According to stats reported regularly by Repinly, a company that provides 
a directory of popular content on Pinterest, Pinterest users are more likely 
to like or repin than they are to comment. The bulk of Pinterest activity is

Part IV: Engaging Through Additional Social Channels 
focused on pinning, repinning, and liking, so understand that most pinners 
may not be looking to enter conversations on Pinterest. Someone who is 
paying close attention to who is repinning her pins may be more likely to 
respond if you comment on her pin than someone focused on the pinning 
process.
To increase interactions on Pinterest, start with great images. Pinning and 
repinning build your boards and fill your Pinterest page with content. Pinning 
and repinning may also help you communicate with other Pinterest users; 
this is your way of inviting them to connect and interact with you. 
You reach out and cast a wide net when you pin. The quality of your pins 
may attract attention as they appear in the pin feed or add value to your 
boards. But repinning is a much more direct action to stimulate engagement 
on Pinterest. Through repinning you can
	
✓	Give kudos to another pinner. Pinterest users are notified of repins, so 
the act of repinning lets them know you liked what they pinned enough 
to share it on your own boards.
	
✓	Get the attention of your target market. When you identify Pinterest 
users who are your target market, a repin lets them know you exist, and 
they have the option to follow you.
	
✓	Build relationships with other Pinterest users. After you follow some­
one on Pinterest and he follows you back, repinning shows you’re 
paying attention and reminds him you’re there.
	
✓	Leverage other people’s images to communicate your message. When 
someone else has similar interests, tastes, or messages, repinning her 
images is an easy, effective way of displaying relevant content to your 
own following.
Liking someone’s pin requires less commitment than placing her pin onto 
one of your boards. Instead, the action of liking a pin shows up in your activ­
ity stream as well as in the stream of the person whose pin you’ve liked. 
Similar to other social networks, liking something someone else has posted is 
a way to get on her radar.
	
Clicking the Like button on someone else’s pin can be an impulsive act. Pause 
for a moment before liking someone else’s pin to consider how that pin 
reflects on your own brand image. Don’t agonize over the process of liking 
pins, but don’t like indiscriminately either. This is not a game of he or she with 
the most pins, wins. The effort you make reflects the “you” that you want your 
community to see.
You can comment on someone else’s pin, but also consider the content of 
that pin, where it leads, and the message in the description. All of these fac­
tors could reflect on your brand. Even though it’s visually driven, Pinterest is 
still considered a social network. Make the effort to reach out to your target 
market by actively liking and commenting.

Don’t get discouraged if nobody responds to your comments. Focus your 
energy on finding and pinning compelling and relevant images and strive to 
constantly increase repins of your pins.
Quantifying the value of Pinterest
As with any newer social network or online marketing tool, the longer and 
more frequently people and brands use Pinterest, the more case studies and 
data are published to quantify the power of pinning. 
	
As of this writing, Pinterest hasn’t yet opened its Application Programming 
Interface (API) widely to other programmers. A site’s API is the code that runs 
the functions of that site. When a site has an open API, other programmers 
can create their own tools that mesh with the main site.
Until Pinterest added its own analytics for business accounts, getting precise 
analysis of Pinterest stats was challenging. If you are still using a personal 
account, you can look at your website statistics and note new surges in traffic 
or interactions that you can then trace back to Pinterest. 
Some of the initial numbers you can examine on Pinterest to get a sense of its 
impact on your social media engagement include
	
✓	Number of followers: You can view your followers on your Pinterest 
account page. 
	
✓	Number of repins: As you receive e-mail notices from Pinterest regard­
ing actions taken on your account, keep a tally. Eventually, Pinterest will 
provide tools that calculate this number for you. 
	
✓	Number of likes: Again, tallying from Pinterest e-mail notices is the first 
way to arrive at this number. In the future, look for third-party services 
that calculate this for you in a more thorough report.
	
✓	Number of comments: Pinterest notifies you of comments on your pins 
in the same way it does repins and likes (through e-mail), which means 
more tallying for you to do until a tool is available.
You can see who has recently followed you as well as which pins they’ve 
repinned or liked by viewing your Pinterest Recent Activity stream that 
appears on the left side of your Pinterest Home page (your main view at 
Pinterest.com when you are logged in). Note which of your pins generate 
attention.
With a Pinterest business account, you can track more specific metrics 
including the following:
	
✓	Number of people pinning from your website. Make sure you have veri­
fied your website as instructed by Pinterest.

✓	Number of people seeing your pins or “Impressions.” Watch for activ­
ity trends on your account based on your own activities.
	
✓	Most repinned and most clicked pins. Gauge what is most popular 
amongst your followers and other pinners and optimize your pinning.
Pinterest sends regular notices to Pinterest users about recent account activ­
ity as well as a weekly summary e-mail that provides some cursory stats and 
trends, including how many people followed you the previous week. Look more 
closely at your followers to determine not only how many followers you’re 
gaining, but also what percentage of them are your target market. Figure 11-5 
shows a notification of activity by other people on a Pinterest account. 
Figure 11-6 shows part of a weekly summary by e-mail from Pinterest that 
includes the number of people who followed you in the previous week.

In addition to Pinterest analytics, you can track the performance of your 
pins by running a Pinterest pin campaign using a site such as Reachli (www.
reachli.com), a tool that adds metrics to your pins. You can measure 
your Pinterest influence and effectiveness with a tool such as Pinpuff (www.
pinpuff.com).
Track other numbers on your social networks that can help demonstrate 
how Pinterest is driving interactions. Keep an eye on referrers listed in your 
website traffic logs. If you’re not yet using it, set up Google Analytics on 
your website to better measure Pinterest traffic. Check your stats culled by 
third-party sites like the free Repinly (www.repinly.com) and the fee-based 
Piqora (www.piqora.com) to glean more data. Figure 11-7 shows a stats 
page from Repinly, which indicates Pinterest stats and a score calculating 
your popularity, activity, and influence on Pinterest. The top score is 100.

Pinpuff measures your popularity, influence, and reach on Pinterest, as 
shown in Figure 11-8. Every site that calculates scores for any other site uses 
its own formula for calculation, so comparing scores is similar to comparing 
apples to oranges. You can use these stats however, to get a sense of how 
you’re doing on Pinterest in a more general sense. But don’t get too caught 
up in the numbers.
Take note when Pinterest shows up in the top 20 referrers of traffic to your 
site. After you begin to see Pinterest listed as a referrer, continue to monitor 
how much traffic you receive on your website from Pinterest to see how your 
Pinterest efforts translate into actions and engagement.

Don’t get so caught up in the numbers that you overlook the overall value of 
the engagement you do get. You are strengthening relationships with custom­
ers and potential customers who are also avid Pinterest users and meeting 
them in a place where they are comfortable and content. Sometimes it’s dif­
ficult to measure relationships, and numbers don’t always reflect the power of 
those connections.
	
The statistics you can access about your Pinterest account are more valuable 
to you combined than looked at individually. Knowing who your followers are 
and how they interact gives you better insights into your Pinterest community 
and level of social media engagement.
Getting Noticed In People’s Pin Feeds
The opening of Pinterest’s floodgates caused a rush of new users, translating 
to many more pins. The more popular Pinterest becomes, the harder it is for 
your pins to stand out. 
Develop your own style and pick eye-catching images to start, then look for 
ways to modify what, how, and even when you pin to have more impact on 
engagement. You also want to keep your pinning frequent and consistent. 
We’re not saying become a Pinterest addict, but don’t pin as an afterthought. 
Really find a way to integrate Pinterest into your online activities.
	
Don’t limit pins to photographs — use graphics, too. You can generate a lot 
of successful interactions through Pinterest by pinning infographics — visual 
interpretations of information on any topic that’s made into a graphic for 
the web, as shown in Figure 11-9 — as well as images with quotes on them. 
Graphics with quotes like the one shown in Figure 11-10 are quite popular 
in social networks and can boost your Pinterest interactions by generating 
repins. Use infographics and quote images that are relevant to your brand 
messages.

Seeking and pinning winning images
Where do you find good pins? You may be tempted to start with or stick with 
your own images on Pinterest. In some cases, this may be a company guide­
line and limitation you have to work within. If it’s not company policy to pin 
only your own copyrighted images, your pin-able selection greatly increases. 
Start rubbing your hands together in eager anticipation.
	
Use the images in Pinterest’s Popular category as a gauge to see what’s gain­
ing traction with other pinners. Then search for similar types of images on 
the web to pin directly from their sources. Access the Popular page — or any 
other category page — using the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of 
any Pinterest page (to the left of the Search field).

Some of the initial places you can go for pin inspiration include
	
✓	Your Pinterest Home page: When you’re on Pinterest.com, the stream 
of pins you see by default are of the pinners you follow.
	
✓	The Popular category: See what’s getting the most repins and likes at 
any moment on the Popular category page, accessed from the drop-
down menu of categories on the upper-left side of your screen.
	
✓	Everything feed: Access the Everything category page to see pins from 
all Pinterest members as they are pinned.
	
✓	Trending on Pinterest: Access this information in your weekly Pinterest 
e-mails or through sites such as Repinly.
	
✓	Popular boards: Pinterest and Repinly both provide a list of popular 
boards each week via e-mail.
Pay attention to trending pins and popular boards through Pinterest busi­
ness analytics or Pinterest’s weekly e-mails coming straight from the most 
reliable source of data. Each e-mail contains a trending pin at the top, half a 
dozen popular boards from all Pinterest users, followed by Pins You’ll Love, 
highlighting nine popular pins from people you follow. The most popular 
pin of all time (so far), according to Repinly, is the Hasselback Garlic Cheesy 
Bread, from LaurensLatest.com, shown in Figure 11-11.

Use an RSS feed reader such as Feedly (www.feedly.com) to keep a close eye 
on popular pinners or some of your favorite or most relevant pinners. Use 
each pinner’s unique RSS feed URL. A user account feed is pinterest.com/
username/feed.rss and a specific board feed is pinterest.com/user­
name/board/rss. Replace username with the pinner’s actual username and 
board with your specific board name.

 Chapter 11: Pinterest
The idea behind picking effective pins is to attract attention, convey a mes­
sage, and compel others to interact with you and your Pinterest boards and 
pins. Keep going back to your goals and the image you want to project as you 
choose pins. 
Honing your repinning strategy
As with any social network, with Pinterest you’re combining publishing with 
individual interactions along with community management. Consider what 
your target audience is pinning and repinning as well as what is trending on 
Pinterest to find the sweet spot of what you should be pinning and repinning. 
Interacting on Pinterest should not happen in a vacuum.
	
Don’t forget your online manners. If you pin someone else’s images or repin 
someone else’s pins, be careful to follow these pointers: 
	
✓	Maintain the integrity of the links of the source material. Click each 
pin before repinning it to make sure it leads to the source website. 
Also check the credit in the pin’s description before you repin it. Add a 
source credit if it’s missing. Checking sources of repins takes more time, 
but also ensures you pin and repin quality, credited work. The extra 
effort saves you from repinning things that lead to error messages or 
Pinterest warning messages, or images that don’t clearly represent or 
lead to the source of the image. 
	
✓	Don’t deliberately change the destination link on someone else’s 
image or pin to your own URL. When pinning or repinning, switching 
destination URLs could be interpreted as a copyright violation. As long 
as you check to verify a pin leads to the appropriate source, leave the 
destination as-is when you pin or repin something.
By repinning other people’s pins, you move beyond publishing, which is a 
one-way action akin to broadcasting. Repinning can help start interactions 
with not only the people you follow on Pinterest, but also other pinners you 
identify on the network with whom you want to connect. 
	
De-clutter your Pinterest stream by following only the boards that are relevant 
to you and your audience. Go to the board you want to follow and click the 
Follow button instead of clicking Follow All when you first arrive on someone’s 
Pinterest profile. You might find that you want to keep an eye on her Women 
in Technology board, but could pass on her Cats and Dogs board. Be selective 
about the boards that fill your Pinterest stream.
Repinning someone you’re following or who is following you can keep you 
top-of-mind with him. We tend to pay attention to what is familiar and who

226
Part IV: Engaging Through Additional Social Channels 
we know. You can strengthen relationships with your Pinterest community 
by repinning their pins. You can also expand your Pinterest network by 
repinning others not in your immediate community.
You can find new people to pin in many ways, including
	
✓	The Popular Pinterest page: If someone has popular pins and pins rel­
evant to your interests, chances are you’ll want to follow them. Access 
the Popular page via the drop-down menu to the left of the Search field 
on the upper-left side of any Pinterest page.
	
✓	Your followers: People who are interested enough in you to follow you 
may be people you want to follow back. Click the Followers link at the 
top of your Pinterest account page to peruse your followers. Click and 
follow their boards that interest you or Follow All.
	
✓	The people who you follow are following: Click the Following link 
toward the upper-right side of your Pinterest profile page to see the list 
of who you’re following; then click the Following link on their profile to 
see who they follow. Chances are good that if you like them, you’ll like 
whoever they like.
	
✓	Who repins you: Because anyone can repin anyone else’s pins without 
having to follow them first, you can find new people to follow based on 
who is repinning you but not yet following you.
	
✓	Summaries of popular pins: Whether from Pinterest, Repinly, or other 
sources, listings or directories of popular pins, boards, and pinners can 
lead you to new people to follow.
	
Look for tools that can help you analyze the connections you make — or not 
make — through Pinterest. An iOS app from Innovatty called Followers on 
Pinterest for iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch shows you who is not following you 
back and who unfollowed you. You can also track new followers, find mutual 
friends, and view fans. 
Knowing how often and how much to pin
True social engagement is not an exact science. Human interactions ebb 
and flow. Although studies can show some patterns in online behavior and 
response, the days, times, and frequency of your pinning are unique to you 
and your audience.
To determine the pinning frequency for you or your team, start with these 
suggestions:
www.Ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.Ebook777.com
227
 Chapter 11: Pinterest
	
✓	Put a clear strategy and plan in place. Having a road map and guide­
lines for pinning make your efforts more effective.
	
✓	Assess your resources. Figure out how much time you have to 
implement pinning.
	
✓	Integrate Pinterest activities. The more you connect Pinterest with 
other networks, the more efficient your efforts become.
	
✓	Allot the time. Find the pinning rhythm that works for both you or your 
team as well as your audience. Identify the times when responses seem 
to be the highest.
	
✓	Adjust your attitude. Don’t think of pinning as yet another work task to 
tackle. Leverage the visual aspect of pinning to enhance your sites and 
social networks and increase engagement in new ways.
The key to effective pinning is to get to know your followers and serve them 
at the times they seem to be most active. You also want to get to know those 
who are in your target market but not already following you to determine 
when they’re active on Pinterest. You want to be visible to them so they can 
interact with you. 
	
Until Pinterest opens its API, you can’t schedule your pins. The moment it 
does, tools such as Repinly may offer this function. Then other social media 
dashboard tools such as HootSuite will add Pinterest scheduling to their 
features to remain competitive.
Pinning regularly keeps your pins in the pin feed and top of mind for your 
followers looking to find new content. Because the pin feed moves so quickly, 
pinning daily is a good practice. At any given time, pinning a handful of 
images or videos will cluster your pins for the greatest visibility. 
Pinning several times a day increases your ability to reach people who pin at 
different times. Again, by clustering your pins anytime you set to the task of 
pinning, you are more likely to attract attention than pinning a single image. 
On Pinterest, frequent pinning will prove beneficial far more than occasional 
pinning.
	
Avoid pinbombing your followers by pinning continuously over a long stretch 
of time. Although it’s tempting to go on a pinning jag when you have time or 
are in the mood, think of your pins flooding someone else’s pin feed as spam. 
Nobody wants to see only pins from the same person taking up their entire 
stream. If they are overwhelmed or turned off by your glut of pins, they’ll most 
likely unfollow you.

Leveraging Pinterest Features to 
Increase Engagement
Pinterest engagement methods are pretty straightforward and simple — pins, 
repins, likes, and comments. Pinterest also offers a few other features you 
can leverage to increase the interaction with your followers and other pinners. 
Adding hashtags to attract attention
Even though Pinterest users don’t comment on pins as much as they repin or 
like pins, one way to get your comments and pins noticed is to use Pinterest 
hashtags. Hashtags are keywords that group together similar information and 
consist of words with a hash mark or pound sign in front of them such as 
#social or #wine. 
Pinterest uses hashtags a little differently than Twitter. When you add 
hashtags to a pin’s description, the hashtags become clickable live links that 
lead to search results similar to Twitter. Unlike Twitter, clicking a hashtag 
on Pinterest generates search results of pins related to the keyword after 
the hashtag and not the results of the hashtag itself. There is no limit to how 
many hashtags you can use but avoid overdoing it or it could be a turnoff. 
Figure 11-12 shows an example of hashtag use on Pinterest.
	
Figure 11-12:

content of 
the pin or to 
your brand.

229
 Chapter 11: Pinterest
	
When you click a hashtag, the Pinterest search results URL contains %23 in 
front of a keyword. This is called a URL Encoded Character and it represents 
the # sign. When you search for a keyword without the hashtag, the search 
results contain some of the same pins but also some different ones. By using 
hashtags strategically, you can
	
✓	Group together similar pins. Hashtags bring together content you pub­
lish, making it easier for people to find more of your pins based on the 
same keyword.
	
✓	Add your pins to a stream of similar pins. When someone clicks a 
hashtag someone else has used that you’ve also used, your pins show 
up with her pins and other related pins.
	
✓	Increase your pins’ searchability. Your pins are more likely to show up 
when someone searches Pinterest for a hashtag or keyword you’ve used.
Getting noticed by tagging others
One way to draw people’s attention to your comment is to mention them in 
the comment in a way that triggers a notification to that person. Tag another 
Pinterest user by adding the @ symbol and that person’s username — similar 
to using the @ symbol in front of a username on Twitter. 
Type the @ symbol in your pin’s description or a comment you make on a pin 
followed by the first letters of the name of the person you’re tagging. A drop-
down menu of Pinterest users you follow appears based on the letters you 
type; you can then easily and accurately add his username. 
	
Mentioning others in your pin descriptions should be a genuine gesture and 
not a way to spam the people you follow on Pinterest. Be thoughtful about 
when and how you mention others in pins.
When you mention another Pinterest user you follow in a comment or pin 
description, her name with the @ symbol in front of it appears as a live link 
similar to Facebook tagging. The link is clickable directly to her Pinterest 
profile page. All the more reason to be thoughtful about who you tag in a pin 
because you’re aligning yourself with them and potentially driving traffic to 
them when others read your comment. In Figure 11-13, you can see that a tag 
of someone’s name on a pin becomes a live link that leads to her profile.

A Pinterest user you’ve mentioned in a pin receives a notification by e-mail 
that she’s been mentioned. Likewise, if someone else mentions you, you are 
notified. When that happens, it’s an open invitation to engage further, con­
tinue the conversation, and further strengthen your relationships with others 
in your growing Pinterest community.
Running a contest to increase interactions
One way to attract attention and boost participation through Pinterest is to 
run a contest or special promotion. Contests on Pinterest can vary widely, 
but most incorporate the pinning function. 
Judged contest: Threadless Valentine’s Day challenge
The t-shirt community Threadless held a Valentine’s Day–themed Pinterest 
contest that challenged people to build boards based on specific rules. The 
company asked users to create a Threadless Valentine’s Day Challenge board 
and fill it with gift ideas for a person they love. 
Part of the contest criteria was to pin ten images, five from Threadless.com 
and the other five from anywhere else on the web. The grand prize was $100 
in Threadless cash, the site’s online currency, and a $100 Amazon gift card. 
The company picked a winner, as shown in Figure 11-14, from more than 350 
submissions and not only received website traffic, branded pins, and interac­
tions with its Pinterest account but also garnered positive comments on its 
blog and in social networks.

Don’t run a contest online without posting official contest rules. You can find 
templates for contest rules on the web. At a minimum, state your privacy and 
security policies, how you’ll use the information given to you by entrants to 
the contest, and spell out each step of how the contest works. 
Sweepstakes: Wine Sisterhood Pin-to-Win
Wine branding company Canopy Management ran a contest over a number 
of months that required an offline component. Pinterest users and members 
of the Wine Sisterhood online community were encouraged to seek out the 
company’s new wine, aptly named Wine Sisterhood Wine. Only one nation­
wide retailer carried the wine at that time, so the Wine Sisterhood commu­
nity manager gave several clues about the retailer without specifically stating 
where the wine was carried. 
Women were encouraged to seek out the wines, take a photograph of the 
wine bottles on the store shelves with their mobile phones, and pin the image 
to Pinterest using the #winesister hashtag. To ensure all entries were found, 
rules included e-mailing the Wine Sisterhood with a link to the pin. The com­
pany repinned the pinned entries to a Pin-to-Win contest board, as shown in 
Figure 11-15.
Each month, the company’s social media manager randomly drew a winner 
from the submissions for a gift bag of Wine Sisterhood merchandise. The 
grand prize winner won a trip for two to Napa, California for the 2nd Annual 
Wine Sisterhood Gathering. The contest drove website traffic, Pinterest inter­
actions, and even foot traffic and branding for the retailer that carried the 
wine.

Inviting participants to group boards
Pinterest provides a way for pinners to add to group boards together for 
collaboration. You can add contributors to your boards at any time to start 
collaborating. Others can also invite you to their boards, and you can choose 
to accept their invitations to participate or ignore them. If you invite others 
to your boards, make sure they are people you trust or monitor the boards to 
ensure quality pins. 
Creating or participating in a group board on Pinterest can be beneficial in 
a number of ways. Collaboration is a productive way to engage with others 
as you work together to build a shared resource. Creative collaboration can 
be a team-building exercise and a way to bring different perspectives into a 
project. 
Pinterest e-mails all board contributors for every pin added to collaborative 
boards, which increases visibility and interactions. Collaborative boards can 
identify shared interests, reveal personalities, and foster stronger relationships. 
More than 70 people from all over the world participate in this collaborative 
board, as shown in Figure 11-16.
You can also create a secret board on Pinterest and invite up to three other 
people to it. The immediate benefit of a secret board is to collaborate pri­
vately with others such as your clients, vendors, or team members. You can 
also use secret boards on your own. Although you cannot turn an existing 
public board into a secret board, you can decide to make your secret board 
public at any time.
	
To invite others to a group board on Pinterest, you must follow at least one 
board from the person you invite. You can add names when you first create a 
new board to invite contributors or edit an existing board then invite others 
later while in Board edit mode to turn it into a group board.

A group 
board.
	
If you’re looking to build a niche community of fans or customers, a group 
Pinterest board provides a visual creative space to interact. However, a chal­
lenge of a group board is that the more contributors you invite, the harder 
it is to ensure quality. Also, if everyone receives notices of each pin from all 
contributors, at some point this can become overwhelming unless you filter 
those notifications. All the more reason to be selective about whom you 
invite to collaborate with you. 
	
Each person on a group board is only able to edit her own pins unless she cre­
ated the board. As the board creator, you can edit any pin, remove someone 
else’s pin if you deem it inappropriate, or remove a person as a collaborator. 
Each person, even a board creator, can only moderate comments on his own 
pins. If someone comments inappropriately on a collaborator’s pin, you can 
only report it to Pinterest.
Benefitting from Pinterest Integration
Pinterest is a vibrant community of users who communicate and respond 
through images. Build a strong following by being active and consistent with 
your pinning. Pinterest can also enhance your other online marketing efforts 
and social networking. Isolating Pinterest from other networks limits many 
opportunities to increase engagement both on Pinterest and on your site, 
blog, and other social networks. 
Inspiring others to pin your images
Take a look at your website through the eyes of a Pinterest enthusiast. 
Make sure your website is Pinterest-ready to add to your opportunities for 
engagement using Pinterest. Although you could choose to block others from

pinning images on your website, the more engaging approach is to make sure 
that your website contains compelling and pin-able images.
	
If you really want to block others from pinning the images on your website, 
add this code into the head of any website page: <meta name=”pinterest” 
content=”nopin” />. We don’t recommend that you do this unless you 
have a sound business reason to do so, such as a copyright issue with the 
images on your site that limits where and how you can distribute them or 
simply a desire to maintain more control over your images.
Some initial ways to ensure you have pin-worthy images on your site include
	
✓	Getting visual: Illustrate every article, blog post, or page with images, 
keeping in mind the types of images people enjoy pinning on Pinterest.
	
✓	Using large images: Embed images that link to larger versions at least 
600 pixels wide. Any height works on Pinterest, but thumbnails on 
boards appear as 192 pixels wide, so consider how the image looks in a 
smaller format as well.
	
✓	Making pin-specific images: Create images for your website made 
with the main purpose of being pinned. Create quote images or how-to 
images. Even if these types of images aren’t what you’d typically create 
to illustrate your content, the more your images look pin-able, the more 
likely people will pin them.
	
✓	Asking for pins: Encourage your website visitors to pin your image by 
overtly stating that your images are pin-able or asking them to pin them.
To further encourage your visitors to pin from your website or blog, install 
Pinterest widgets. Use the widget that adds a Pin It button to your website or 
blog so all someone has to do to generate a pin is click the button. 
Add a button on your website that lets people know you’re on Pinterest and 
requests that they follow you there. You can also install a widget that pulls in 
your most recent pins to display directly on your website or blog.
	
Create tall, skyscraper-style images combining a number of images stacked on 
top of one another to create a narrative. This popular type of image is often 
used for step-by-step how-tos such as how to create a paper peony. Figure 11-17 
shows how a tall, vertical image visually breaks down a step-by-step process.
	
Make complementary boards on Pinterest to correspond with other content 
you’ve created elsewhere. If you write a blog post on a particular topic, 
enhance that post with a board to be a visual archive linking to related 
material.

Figure 11-17:

Look for every opportunity to let others know that you’re pinning and that 
you want them to pin what you publish. Being clear about your intentions 
and your expectations on your website or blog about Pinterest invites others 
to engage with you through pins. Encourage your community to connect with 
you on Pinterest so they can follow along. Make it simple to pin images and 
video from your site with a single click.
Linking Pinterest to Twitter
Consider linking your Pinterest account to Twitter if you use Twitter fre­
quently as a platform for engaging your audience. Pinterest provides you 
with fresh content to tweet, and tweeting your pins can provide you with an 
additional source of potential Pinterest followers. By linking Pinterest and 
Twitter, you build your community and increase your opportunities for 
connection.
If you didn’t link Pinterest and Twitter when you first set up your Pinterest 
account, you can do it at any time by following these steps:
	
1.	Log in to Pinterest through the website (www.pinterest.com) or 
mobile app.
	
2.	Access your account settings by clicking your name in the upper-right 
corner of the Pinterest page you’re on and choosing Settings (if you’re 
on the website).

	 If you’re using the app, tap Profile➪click on the gear on the upper-left 
corner of your mobile screen and choose Account Settings➪Account 
Settings.
	
3.	Toggle the Twitter slider to On.
	
	 On the website, the slider is under Social Networks and next to Log on 
with Twitter. On the app, the slider appears under Twitter Settings. Cut 
the connection by toggling the slider to Off.
	
4.	Authorize Pinterest to access your Twitter account by accepting the 
permission request from Twitter that pops up on your computer or 
your mobile screen as Pinterest attempts to connect both accounts. 
	
5.	Save profile changes by clicking the Save Settings button on the 
website or clicking the Done button on the mobile app.
After you link your Pinterest account to Twitter, your pins do not automatically 
post to Twitter. When you click on your pins or anyone else’s pins, you’ll see 
a share arrow button on the upper-right corner of the pin to share on Twitter, 
Facebook, via e-mail or to grab the pin’s embed code.
	
Pin images that you capture on the fly using your smartphone and the 
Pinterest mobile app. Using the mobile app, you can choose to post your 
pins simultaneously to Twitter to increase their reach right before you post 
your pin.
A byproduct of tweeting your pins may be retweets of your pins on Twitter, 
but only if you manually tweet your pins from either Pinterest or Twitter. 
People who use Twitter and Pinterest are more likely to retweet a pin when 
they recognize the link in the tweet as a pin. When people search Twitter for 
Pinterest, your pins show up because the word Pinterest is in the URL of the 
link in your tweet.
	
Craft short pin descriptions if you plan to cross-post your pin to Twitter so the 
content fits in a tweet. At least put the most important text at the start of your 
description in case Twitter cuts off the rest.
People who don’t use Pinterest may retweet your cross-posted pin because 
of the message conveyed in the tweet. If you say you’re drooling over a 
chocolate Snickers cheesecake pin, even the most inexperienced Pinterest 
users on Twitter may click or share it. If they click the link in your tweet, they 
arrive at your pin and can now connect and interact with you on Pinterest.

Integrating Pinterest into 
Facebook Timelines
When you first set up your Pinterest account, you had the option of link­
ing it with Facebook. As with Twitter, by linking Pinterest to Facebook, you 
increase opportunities for people to see that you’re on Pinterest and to 
follow you and interact with you there. The current limitations with this fea­
ture however, is that Pinterest links with your personal Facebook Timeline 
versus your Facebook business Page. 
That said, if you use your Facebook Timeline for personal branding, Pinterest 
integration is a great way to enhance your Timeline. Linking Pinterest to our 
Facebook Timelines works for both of us because we reveal more personal 
aspects of our lives as part of our brands. Our Facebook friends are a mix of 
real-life friends as well as business colleagues. If a personal touch works for 
your brand, linking Pinterest to your personal Timeline is a no-brainer.
Choose the option to link Pinterest to your personal Facebook account or go 
even further and choose to Link to Timeline so your pins are automatically 
added as a status update. To link Pinterest to Facebook or unlink it, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Log in to Pinterest through the website (www.pinterest.com) or 
mobile app.
	
2.	Access your account settings by clicking your name in the upper-right 
corner of the Pinterest page you’re on and choosing Settings (if you’re 
on the website).
	
	 If you’re using the app, tap Profile➪click on the gear on the upper-left 
corner of your mobile screen and choose Account Settings➪Account 
Settings.
	
3.	Toggle the Facebook slider to On.
	
	 On the website, the slider is under Social Networks and next to Log on 
with Facebook. On the app, the slider appears under Facebook Settings. 
Cut the connection by toggling the slider to Off.
	
4.	(Optional) Add to Facebook Timeline by using the Post your activity 
to Timeline slider (on the website) or Publish to Facebook Timeline on 
the mobile app.
	
	 Choosing this step makes your pins and Pinterest activity appear 
prominently in your Facebook Timeline.

5.	Authorize Pinterest to access your Facebook account by accepting the 
permission request from Facebook that pops up on your computer or 
mobile screen as Pinterest attempts to connect both accounts. 
	
6.	Save profile changes by clicking the Save Settings button on the web­
site or clicking the Done button on the mobile app.
You can undo these connections at any time — switch the slider to Off.
	
Be careful not to spam your Facebook friends with pins. If you automatically 
cross-post, keep this in mind when you pin. Pins showing up frequently on 
Facebook can seem a lot more intrusive than frequent pinning directly to 
Pinterest. 
When you pin and post to your Facebook Timeline, your Facebook friends 
see that pin in their News Feeds. They can immediately like or comment on 
your pin directly from the feed or your Timeline. Your pins and likes also 
appear in your Activity panel on the right side of your Timeline.
	
For more details on how to link Pinterest to social networks, see the book 
Pinterest For Dummies (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).
You can also control the connection between Facebook and Pinterest on the 
Facebook side by going to your Account Settings on your Facebook Timeline 
and clicking Apps. Then click Edit next to the Pinterest app to remove the app.
Integrating Pinterest into Facebook Pages
Chances are you’re looking for ways to engage people on your company’s 
Facebook Page. You can provide new ways for your fans to interact leverag­
ing your Pinterest pins. As of this writing, you can’t directly integrate your 
Pinterest account into your Facebook Page through either Pinterest or 
Facebook. You can always post your pins as status updates. Or you can use a 
third-party application to add Pinterest to your Page.
	
Use an iframe app service that programs one HTML document inside another 
such as Woobox (www.woobox.com) or ShortStack (www.shortstack.com) 
to make a custom Facebook app for your Page featuring your pins. Services 
such as these allow you to embed your actual Pinterest page into Facebook 
using their software, usually for free. A third-party solution is a pretty good 
work-around for Pinterest’s limitation integrating with Facebook Pages. In 
Figure 11-18, Monogamy Wines enhances its Facebook Page by displaying its 
Pinterest boards within the Woobox Pinterest app.

At the time of this writing, Facebook blocks the ability to pin images from 
its site. You can bypass this restriction on your Facebook Page by using a 
third-party application called Pinvolve (http://apps.facebook.com/
pinvolve). Pinvolve creates a separate app on your Page that turns the 
images you’ve posted to your Page Wall into pin-able images. It also imports 
your Pinterest images and Instagram images into the same app. Using the 
Pinvolve app gives your Facebook fans new ways to interact with you and 
spread your messages by letting them tweet your posts in the free version or 
pin your Page posts if you are using Pinvolve Pro ($5 per month).

E

very business is built on relationships. Whether it’s relationships 
with your vendors, customers, employees, or the general public, your 
business runs and grows based on the relationships you form and cultivate 
over time. LinkedIn is focused on the professional relationships that you 
foster in business.
LinkedIn helps you first and foremost establish a professional presence 
online and build and strengthen the connections you have to other 
professionals. But its beauty is so much deeper than that; LinkedIn also 
offers you tools to showcase your business as well as create a platform to 
build a professional community.
What we like most about LinkedIn is that it doesn’t try to be everything to 
everyone. Even as Facebook’s popularity exploded, LinkedIn didn’t say, “To 
heck with focusing on business professionals. Let’s be a jack of all trades.” 
Sticking to its guns has made LinkedIn the most powerful business-oriented 
social network around.
Although LinkedIn can be useful for business-to-consumer (B2C) marketing, 
it’s especially useful for business-to-business (B2B) marketing and social 
media engagement.
Setting Up Your LinkedIn Profile
The value of LinkedIn begins with providing you the ability to build your 
professional résumé online and to connect with your business contacts. Your 
main presence on LinkedIn is your profile, essentially an enhanced résumé.

Creating a new public profile
First impressions count, so don’t scrimp on the information you add to your 
LinkedIn profile. LinkedIn offers a variety of features on your profile to show­
case your expertise and experience and allows you to interact with others. As 
you fill out your profile, LinkedIn prompts you to continue optimizing your 
profile until it’s 100 percent complete.
Your public LinkedIn profile (see Figure 12-1) is visible to anyone, even if 
they aren’t logged in to LinkedIn. You can control what parts of your profile 
are included in the public view in your settings, as we discuss in “Editing and 
enhancing your profile,” later in this chapter.
	
Figure 12-1: 
A LinkedIn 
profile.
	
Your LinkedIn profile consists of
	
✓	A snapshot: This text appears at the top of every profile and includes 
your name, location, current title, links to your websites, and a cursory 
view of past positions, education, and recommendations. Think of the 
snapshot as the elevator pitch of your elevator pitch — the ten-second 
glimpse of who you are and what you do.
	
✓	Your photo: Although optional, we highly recommend that you include 
a clear, professional-looking photograph of yourself on your LinkedIn 
profile to appear more accessible. A close-up headshot to your shoul­
ders with a friendly and relaxed smile is ideal and inviting to encourage 
others to interact with you.
	
✓	Activity: Publish status updates in the field at the top of the LinkedIn 
home page when you’re logged in to your LinkedIn account. Your

updates appear in your activity feed and are one of LinkedIn’s main 
engagement and community-building features. Although visible to you 
at all times, the activity feed is only viewable on your profile by others 
when they are logged into LinkedIn.
	
✓	Background: You can rearrange any of the Background sections to 
highlight one over the other. Background sections include
 
• Summary: Craft a professional 30-second elevator pitch for this 
section.
 
• Skills and Expertise: The key skills you add for yourself are 
displayed here along with endorsements from others. Once you 
approve endorsements, endorsers show up on your profile with 
tiny thumbnails of their LinkedIn profile photos next to each skill 
they’ve endorsed. Note that you can move the Skills and Expertise 
section higher or lower in your profile. We suggest keeping it 
higher on your profile to encourage additional endorsements.
 
• Experience: Like in a traditional résumé, detail your work experience 
in reverse chronological order, with the most recent appearing at 
the top.
 
• Education: List your educational background in reverse 
chronological order.
 
• Additional Information: This section consists of your Websites, 
Interests, Groups and Associations, and Honors and Awards. The 
more you add to this section, the more reasons people find to be in 
touch with you.
	
✓	Recommendations: You can display both recommendations from 
others about your work and your recommendations of others. See more 
about engaging through recommendations in “Giving and receiving 
recommendations,” later in this chapter.
	
✓	Connections: If you opt to make your LinkedIn Connections viewable by 
others, photos of some of your Connections appear on your profile with 
a link to all of them. Because of the emphasis on professional networking, 
showing your Connections helps facilitate contacts and introductions.
	
✓	Groups: Logos for some of the groups you’ve joined on LinkedIn signify 
your affiliations and link directly to the groups where you’re a member. 
Being a member of a specific group can encourage connections and 
interactions based on similar interests.
	
✓	Following: This section has links to news and companies you follow.

“Communicating through Your Company Page,” later in this chapter.

Part IV: Engaging Through Additional Social Channels 
Simply signing up for a LinkedIn account and entering your employment and 
education history isn’t enough to get noticed or to stimulate engagement 
with others. Look at every feature listed above as a potential starting point 
for engagement. Give people as many clues and cues as possible to showcase 
who you are and what you do and provide a variety of reasons and ways to 
connect. We provide some tips in the following section.
Editing and enhancing your profile
LinkedIn provides numerous ways for you to customize your profile even 
down to your communications preferences. In Edit mode, you can modify 
how you want others to contact you. You can also modify the types of con­
tacts that interest you such as career opportunities, expertise requests, or 
consulting ventures. The more options you provide, the more chances some­
one has to interact with you.
When you edit your public profile settings, opt to include more information 
rather than less to give others a variety of reasons to engage with you. Search 
engines index LinkedIn accounts, giving you yet another reason to add more 
information about yourself and your work to your profile.
	
When you first sign up for a LinkedIn account, choose your vanity or personal­
ized custom URL for your LinkedIn profile so you have a more branded link to 
provide others. Ideally, use your name, but if that’s already taken, add your 
company name, a relevant keyword, your location, or some other identifier 
such as http://linkedin.com/in/JaneDoeCEO or http://linkedin.
com/in/JohnDoeFL. You can also add your custom URL later, in Edit mode. 
To go to Edit mode, click the Edit link to the right of the current URL under 
your profile photo.
	
You can add links to videos, images, documents, and presentations through­
out your profile to attract more attention and encourage more interactions.
	
Enhance your LinkedIn profile by adding a link to a video, image, document 
or presentation. If you sign up for a free account at SlideShare and upload 
your PowerPoint presentations and PDF files, you can then embed them into 
your LinkedIn profile to add visual interest and demonstrate your expertise. 
LinkedIn supports files from many other multimedia websites including 
Pinterest for images, YouTube for video, and SoundCloud for audio. Adding 
presentations and documents into your profile provides richer engagement 
opportunities. See Figure 12-2 for an example of the SlideShare presentations 
embedded on a profile.

Reaching Out and Connecting 
with Your Peers
Although Facebook Pages can be effective B2C marketing tools and Twitter 
works well as both B2C and B2B outreach platforms, LinkedIn is definitely 
geared more toward both B2B marketing as well as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) net­
working. Your profile on LinkedIn is the hub for connecting with others, both 
your actual LinkedIn 1st-degree connections as well as your network of 2nd- 
and 3rd-degree connections.
LinkedIn offers specific features that help you interact with other members 
on LinkedIn or that help them reach out to you. Table 12-1 shows the differ­
ent LinkedIn features you can use for P2P engagement depending on if you’re 
actually connected with someone or not.

Part IV: Engaging Through Additional Social Channels 
You get the most value out of LinkedIn when you connect with people whom 
you actually know. LinkedIn works well for warm leads, but only when you’re 
connected to people who know and trust you and are willing to facilitate 
introductions to their connections that in turn expand your network.
Make sure you personalize the invitations you send through LinkedIn — or 
any other social network for that matter — to connect with you. Don’t rely on 
LinkedIn’s canned invitation message as your introduction or you risk seem­
ing impersonal or even lazy.
	
It’s against LinkedIn’s user agreement to invite people you don’t know to your 
network.
	
Don’t spam others, and don’t try to hide your intentions or you may offend 
others or violate the LinkedIn user agreement. Most people are wise to unso­
licited sales pitches couched as friendly greetings. Be clear and straightfor­
ward when contacting others on LinkedIn and on any social network.
Engaging in reciprocal interactions
Some of the key P2P engagement features on LinkedIn are reciprocal, such as 
these:
	
✓	Messages: You can send messages to your connections, and they can 
send messages in return.
	
✓	InMail: InMail is an internal e-mail system for LinkedIn members with 
paid accounts. You can send messages to people with whom you are 
not connected if you are a paid subscriber to LinkedIn, and they can 
respond to you. (LinkedIn pro accounts start at $24.95 per month with a 
discount when paid annually.)
	
✓	Recommendations: You can recommend a connection, and they can 
recommend you back. Making a sincere recommendation of someone’s 
work may result in a reciprocal recommendation. Don’t give kudos if you 
don’t mean it. See “Giving and receiving recommendations,” later in this 
chapter.
	
✓	Endorsements: The endorsement feature is a quick way to recognize 
someone’s skills. Your photo appears on his profile as an endorser once 
he approves your endorsement, so use this feature thoughtfully. The 
person you’ve endorsed is notified and can also reciprocate.
Other P2P engagement features on LinkedIn are handled via your home page 
where you can see updates such as posts by you and others and announce­
ments about your connections connecting with others, similar to your 
Facebook News Feed. We discuss engaging via your LinkedIn home page later 
in this chapter.

 Chapter 12: LinkedIn
Joining LinkedIn Groups
LinkedIn offers ways to connect with other people beyond your own con­
nections and their connections through LinkedIn Groups. Think of LinkedIn 
Groups as online forums where you can engage in professional networking 
while joining conversations on topics relevant to your interests. See Figure 12-3 
for an example of a LinkedIn Group home page.
Because LinkedIn has a professional focus, most LinkedIn Groups are ori­
ented toward business, career, and organizational topics. Many established 
real-world groups like professional networking organizations and trade asso­
ciations take advantage of these web-based groups to regularly engage with 
their members beyond the typical monthly in-person meetings.
Companies also use LinkedIn Groups to build communities, interacting with 
their business customers on a regular basis, such as banks offering advice to 
their small business clientele, or marketing companies engaging clients, ven­
dors, and prospects in dialog about marketing trends.
Voices.com, for example, is an online marketplace for voice-over talent. Its 
open LinkedIn group is a place where voice-over professionals can discuss 
industry trends, work opportunities, and learning resources, and also where 
company representatives can join to find voice-over talent for their business 
needs. Figure 12-3 shows the home page for the Voices.com group. If you are 
interested in topics related to the voice-over industry and were to join the 
group, you’d have the opportunity to network with a diverse group of profes­
sionals and have something in common with them. If someone was interested 
in hiring a voice-over professional, she could also join the group to find suit­
able talent.

Part IV: Engaging Through Additional Social Channels 
Finding pertinent groups
You can find groups by conducting a search on LinkedIn using the drop-
down menu on the upper-right side of the site. The default search category is 
People, so choose Groups from the menu options. You can search by topic of 
interest or by an organization or business name. Another way to find groups 
is to watch your LinkedIn updates and see when your connections join 
groups. The action of joining a group is an action that is broadcast to others 
unless you choose otherwise. If you see one of your connections join a group 
you can click the group name to check it out.
	
In the drop-down menu under the Groups section across the top of LinkedIn’s 
site, you can select Groups You May Like for some suggestions of groups 
based on content in your profile as well as groups in which some of your con­
nections are members. The more active groups rise to the top of the list.
Joining and participating in a group
To join a LinkedIn group, after you’re on the group’s home page, click the 
Join button. If it’s an open group, you are added as a member immediately. If 
not, you have to wait until the group moderator approves your request.
When you are a member of a LinkedIn Group, you can
	
✓	View what’s happening. In this view, you get a general overview of 
activity taking place in the group, including a slide show rotating recent 
posts at the top. Most Popular Discussions are listed under that.
	
✓	View the latest discussion. Choose to view this stream to see a list of 
only the group discussions in the order of more recent first. Use this 
view to participate in the most current discussions.
	
✓	Start a discussion. Similar to posting to any group, type in and submit a 
conversation starter in the blank field at the top of the home page of the 
LinkedIn Group.
	
✓	Start a poll. When starting a discussion, you have the option to embed 
a quick poll to group members. A quick poll is a great way to do quick 
research or start a conversation. The poll feature is supported only 
through Groups.
	
✓	Peruse the members list. You can see who is in the group, and the list­
ing is ordered based on your connection to other members with 1st-
degree connections at the top. You can also search the group members 
list.
	
✓	Follow and unfollow other members. By default, you follow members 
who are also your 1st-degree contacts in LinkedIn. You can also follow 
other members so you see their discussions on your home page, includ­
ing top influencers in the group who provide the most content.

✓	Read or add promotions. You, other members, or the group organizer 
can add promotional messages in this section, which is optional and 
controlled by the organizer.
	
✓	Post or peruse jobs. You, other members, or the group organizer can 
post job listings and discussions on the Jobs tab that automatically 
expire after 14 days.
	
✓	Search the group. You can search the group by keywords or view only 
polls, discussions, and manager’s choice based on content featured by 
the group organizer. You can also view group content by discussions 
you’ve started, discussions you’ve joined, and discussions you’re 
following.
	
✓	View group updates. This features the latest group activity, so you can 
see the most current conversations to join as well as who has recently 
joined.
	
✓	Review your group activity. This shows your most recent updates 
or actions in the group. Check this to get a sense of how much you’re 
engaging.
	
✓	Modify your settings. This includes receiving an e-mail digest of activity 
in the group to alert you when someone posts content or an action that 
could lead to engagement. You can also adjust your settings to allow 
messages from group members, increasing the likelihood of networking 
and business opportunities.
	
✓	Join a subgroup. Subgroups are optional additions to a LinkedIn Group 
to split members off into smaller groups more focused on specific 
topics.
Being part of a LinkedIn Group is similar to being part of any online commu­
nity. Follow the community guidelines, add value to the conversation, and be 
respectful to get the most value of your interactions within the group.
Communicating through 
Your Company Page
Company Pages are newer offerings from LinkedIn, and not everyone is 
leveraging these free tools yet. In the past, you could list your company in 
LinkedIn’s company directory, but these listings have been expanded to 
include a multipage presence. Figure 12-4 shows the PGAV Destinations 
Company Page, customized with a cover image; PGAV Destinations posts 
regular updates to the page ranging from company to industry news.

Creating a Company Page
LinkedIn offers Company Pages similar to Facebook Pages. Initially, busi­
nesses could list their companies for free in LinkedIn’s company directory. 
More recently, LinkedIn expanded a business presence on their service 
through Company Pages that showcase company news and information and 
include status updates.
A LinkedIn Company Page has the following sections:
	
✓	Home page: Visitors land on a main page when they click your company 
name in your profile or do a search on LinkedIn. The page is similar to 
Facebook’s Page Wall with a cover image, a way to post status updates 
with an update feed, as well as tabs for information about your company.
	
✓	Careers: You can post job openings on this tab. If you have team mem­
bers, they can update their LinkedIn profiles with your company name 
to appear on the Careers section as your employees.
	
✓	Products: You can list your products or services in this tab to give 
others more background about your company and what you offer.
	
To connect your LinkedIn profile (see “Setting Up Your LinkedIn Profile,” ear­
lier in this chapter) with your Company Page, edit your current employment. 
When you type in your company’s name, a pop-up menu appears with a list of 
companies with LinkedIn Company Pages. Choose your own company name 
to create a link from your profile to your Company Page. Your team members 
can do the same to appear on your Company Page.

 Chapter 12: LinkedIn
Making the most of your Company Page
Just as your audience can follow your LinkedIn Company Page for the latest 
news and job openings, you can do the same for your competition, keeping 
tabs on their progress, what they are doing well, and where you might take 
the lead.
Add your LinkedIn Company Page to your editorial calendar for social con­
tent and conversations. Cultivating an active Company Page is similar to cul­
tivating a community on a Facebook Page. It takes time, attention, consistent 
posting, and moderation. Posts to your Company Page should include valu­
able news and information that others want to read, act on, and share.
You can share updates beyond just your Company Page. When you post, you 
also see the option to share an update to one of the groups you belong to or 
to share the update via a message to specific connections.
Some of the other things you should share on your LinkedIn Company Page 
include company news (new products, services, or hires; open positions; dis­
counts, promotions, or sales), media coverage of your company (articles or 
articles in which you’ve been quoted), company content (slide presentations, 
white papers, or articles your company has published), and company conver­
sation (general questions; commentary on industry news and current events; 
and polls, surveys, and questionnaires).
The best content for your LinkedIn Company Page is any information that 
appeals to or is useful to your target audience. Include links in your posts 
to your website and include easy ways for people to contact you. Your 
Company Page should be a professional presence that stimulates business 
inquiries.
Stimulating Interactions 
through Updates
The LinkedIn home page (see Figure 12-5) that you see when you first log in 
to your account operates similarly to the Facebook News Feed. You can see 
posts from your connections on the service, and you can interact with them 
through their activities on LinkedIn. You can also post updates of your own.

Figure 12-5: 
The default 
LinkedIn

and your

connections.
	
Engaging with others on LinkedIn generates messages in your activity stream 
that act as signals to others to what you’re doing. These signals can also 
prompt additional interactions as you use LinkedIn each day.
Some actions that automatically post to your LinkedIn activity feed include
	
✓	When you like something someone has posted
	
✓	When you share something someone has posted
	
✓	When you connect with someone on the network
	
✓	When you post to another service that you’ve connected to LinkedIn
Optional actions that LinkedIn posts to your activity feed are when you make 
a recommendation, update your profile, or join a group.
Click on your name in the upper-right corner of your profile, and then click 
Settings. In Settings, you can choose to turn activity broadcasts on or off 
announcing to everyone actions such as when you change your profile, make 
recommendations, or follow companies. The Turn On/Off Your Activity 
Broadcasts and Select Who Can See Your Activity Feed options are under 
Privacy Controls. Selecting the check box turns activity broadcasts on, and 
deselecting it turns them off. Making activity broadcasts about your actions 
on LinkedIn public is a personal choice based on the image you want to proj­
ect to others.
	
At the top of your home page, LinkedIn recommends content that might be of 
interest to you. Check this section regularly to find relevant content that you 
can share with your connections.
	
Use LinkedIn Signal (www.linkedin.com/signal) to filter news updates 
to find the most relevant content to like, comment on, and share. You can 
filter by network, industry, company, time published, group, school, location, 
seniority, and update type. Relevance increases the potential for engagement. 
You can also search by keyword.

 Chapter 12: LinkedIn
Posting compelling content
Be proactive and strategic about what shows up in your news feed by post­
ing regularly to it. Post a combination of information about your professional 
work, news from your company, and industry news. Determining what to 
post to your LinkedIn activity feed should be based on
	
✓	Your professional goals
	
✓	Your audience — in this case, your connections
	
✓	The image you’d like to convey
	
✓	The actions you’d like others to take, such as reading your content, 
spreading your messages, contacting you, or hiring you.
To make your updates on LinkedIn more compelling, you can use links that 
expand with a preview and can include an image if the host website is set 
up properly. You can also attach files of your own to your updates including 
images, Word documents, PDFs, and PowerPoint slides. Control the appear­
ance, quality, and value of your LinkedIn updates by attaching your own files 
to them. Figure 12-6 shows how to enhance a post by attaching a Word file. 
The file then automatically converts to a PDF. 
	
Figure 12-6: 
You can 
attach a file 
to your post.
	
Click to attach a ﬁle.
	
Even if you post regularly to your Company Page, you most likely have far 
more connections through your own personal profile than your Company 
Page has followers, at least to start. Share what you post onto your Company 
Page to your personal profile to increase attention for your company’s news.
Posting updates through your Group or Company Page can help garner more 
attention for either of those features. If you post content within a public 
LinkedIn Group, it can show up in your activity feed and others can like it 
directly on the feed or share it from the feed. If they try to comment on it, 
however, they are led to the post on your Group’s page. To comment on the 
content, they have to join the Group. Even if they don’t join at that time, they 
still see your Group and can consider joining at a later date.

Part IV: Engaging Through Additional Social Channels 
Interacting with others in the feed
To interact with others based on what they share to their activity feeds, you 
need to keep an eye on your LinkedIn home page for updates. You can toggle 
your views to focus on particular topic areas and points of conversation. 
Look for news and activities that warrant a Like at a minimum or take more 
time to post comments on other people’s updates. If their content is compel­
ling, you can share it to your own feed.
By default, when you log in to your LinkedIn account, you see the most 
recent updates on your LinkedIn home page. You have the option to change 
what you see on your home page by clicking All Updates on the top-right side 
of the page, directly under the open field where you post your own updates. 
You can sort the content you see into different categories including top and 
recent posts; by source such as your company and co-workers or your con­
nections; and content you’ve shared, posted to groups or just your updates. 
You can even customize your content view based on only new connections, 
just job opportunities, or trending news.
Taking a proactive approach can show people that you’re paying attention. 
Your actions on other people’s content can get you noticed, and others may 
return the favor, amplifying your messages to their connections.
	
If you are handy with RSS feeds, you can generate an RSS feed for your 
Network Updates at the bottom of the drop-down menu under All Updates. 
Taking Advantage of More 
LinkedIn Features
Engagement happens more frequently when you know your audience and 
post the right kind of content that attracts their attention and gets reaction. 
Using the right tools on the right networks can also help you up your engage­
ment with your connections. On LinkedIn, you can consume information 
using various tools, but you can also provide information in a variety of ways.
Whether you’re giving recommendations to others, answering questions to 
showcase your expertise, or forming a LinkedIn Group to build and commu­
nicate with your targeted community, pick the tools that will best serve your 
audience and achieve your goals. Using these tools in combination can also 
be powerful, but don’t bite off more than you can chew.

 Chapter 12: LinkedIn
Giving and receiving recommendations
We talk about the value of giving kudos to others as a way of engaging in a 
valuable and meaningful way online. Recommendations are the LinkedIn ver­
sion of kudos that let you give and receive detailed recommendations from 
other LinkedIn members.
Recommendations are different from endorsements (see “Providing endorse­
ments,” later in this chapter) in that the former include a more in-depth 
description of you and your work from people with whom you’ve worked. 
Figure 12-7 shows sample recommendations. When you give someone a rec­
ommendation or endorsement, she has the option of featuring it on her pro­
file for others to see — or not.
	
Figure 12-7: 
Sample 
recommen-
dations.
	
Making a recommendation
To recommend someone, follow these steps:
	
1.	Go to the person’s profile who you’d like to recommend.
	
2.	Hover your cursor over the button with the upside down triangle to 
the right of the Send a Message button.
	
3.	Choose Recommend from the drop-down menu.
	
4.	Select the appropriate option for how you know the person you’re 
recommending:
 
• Colleague: You’ve worked with him at the same company.
 
• Service Provider: You’ve hired him to provide a service for you or 
your company.

256
Part IV: Engaging Through Additional Social Channels 
 
• Business Partner: You’ve worked with him but not as a client or 
colleague
 
• Student: You were at school when he was also there, so you were a 
fellow student or teacher.
	
5.	Fill in the recommendation form.
	
	 The form asks for the following specific information:
 
• Position you are recommending her for.
 
• Service category.
 
• Year you first hired her, if applicable. You also have the option to 
note if you’ve hired her more than once.
 
• Choose three attributes that best describe her. These include: 
great results, personable, expert, good value, on time, high integ­
rity, and creative.
 
• Fill in a written recommendation that’s specific but brief.
	
6.	Review your recommendation and make changes as necessary.
	
7.	Click the Send button to send it to the person you’re recommending.
	
Indiscriminately endorsing others can affect how others perceive you and 
could dilute the value of your recommendations. As with any kudos you give, 
your recommendation or endorsement of someone else also reflects on you, 
so do so with care.
Asking for recommendations
Asking for recommendations may feel uncomfortable, but on LinkedIn, it’s 
part of the typical networking process to seek recommendations from people 
who are familiar with your work. To ask for recommendations, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	In the LinkedIn navigation bar, hover your mouse over Profile and 
click Recommendations.
	
2.	Click the Ask for Recommendations link in the Recommendations 
section.
	
	In this section, you can also manage recommendations others have 
given you and peruse recommendations you’ve given to others.
	
3.	Choose a job position on your LinkedIn profile.
	
	You can also add a school you attended, if relevant, although most 
people recommend one another based on jobs.
	
4.	Enter which of your connections can provide information about your 
work in that position.
	
	You can add up to 200 connections.

5.	Edit the default request.
	
	 We highly recommend personalizing your request message rather than 
sending the canned version.
	
6.	Click Send to submit the request. 
	
	If someone recommends you, you will receive an e-mail from LinkedIn 
with the recommendation text.
	
7.	Click the link provided in the e-mail. 
	
	You will arrive at a page on LinkedIn where you can approve the recom­
mendation and add it to your profile or opt to keep it hidden.
Thanking someone who recommends you on LinkedIn is a nice touch.
	
Attract attention for your profile, your Company Page, or anything else you’d 
like to promote by advertising on LinkedIn. This is similar to how you’d adver­
tise on Facebook. Target your ads geographically and by occupation so you 
reach a targeted audience such as senior-level management at healthcare 
companies or managers at insurance agencies. Choose an image and text for 
your ad, and set your daily ad budget and the duration of your ad run.
Providing endorsements
Endorsements are different from Recommendations. Recommendations are 
longer form testimonials that you can request and then choose to put onto 
your profile. Endorsements are a quick and simple way of giving someone 
kudos for specific skills. Both require approval before they appear on a 
profile. When you give someone an endorsement on LinkedIn, your profile 
photo appears on his profile next to the skill you’ve endorsed, as shown in 
Figure 12-8.

Part IV: Engaging Through Additional Social Channels 
When you’re logged in to your LinkedIn account, you periodically see a 
prompt to endorse others with a single click. Each time you click to endorse 
someone, additional suggestions appear until you decide to stop. The ease of 
this particular LinkedIn feature has drawn some criticism from professionals 
who feel there’s no real weight or value in simply clicking to endorse some­
one without taking the time to add relevant context.
Forming and managing a LinkedIn Group
LinkedIn Groups are by default open to the public but can be made pri­
vate. Groups provide you with moderating tools to cultivate conversations 
between people with shared interests.
The main features of LinkedIn Groups are
	
✓	Discussion: The home page of your group is where the main discussions 
take place. 
	
✓	Members: You can choose to follow other members so you can see their 
updates on your home page.
	
✓	Promotions: Members can share news, links to articles, promote 
products or services, and post anything that isn’t a general topic for 
conversation.
	
✓	Search: Use this feature to find discussions on specific topics and also 
access the member search function.
	
✓	Jobs: This isn’t a default feature; however, you can add this feature to 
give members the ability to post job openings for the benefit of other 
members.
You can form subgroups within your LinkedIn Group to offer more granular 
discussions on specific topics. LinkedIn subgroups have similar features to 
the main group including discussions, jobs, and digest e-mails. You can find 
out more about the ins and outs of LinkedIn Groups in LinkedIn’s Help Center 
(http://help.linkedin.com).
Moderating a LinkedIn Group is similar to moderating any online community. 
You should have community policies in place and use the moderation tools 
at your disposal to keep the conversation appropriate and on-topic to pro­
vide the most value to your group members.
	
Naturally, we can cover only so much in one chapter, so we would be remiss 
if we didn’t tell you that Joel Elad explains LinkedIn extensively in LinkedIn 
For Dummies, 2nd Edition (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.). Check out a copy if you 
decide this social media engagement tool is going to be a priority for you.

 Chapter 12: LinkedIn
Gauging LinkedIn Results
Success with LinkedIn depends on using it often. Too many professionals set 
up their LinkedIn profiles and then sit back to wait for something to happen. 
If you connect with others thoughtfully, post regularly to your profile and 
Company Page, and also participate in a few LinkedIn Groups relevant to 
your business or industry, you’ll reap the networking and marketing benefits 
of LinkedIn. Determine how well you’re doing with LinkedIn through a combi­
nation of qualitative and quantitative metrics.
Tracking interactions
Although LinkedIn offers some concrete numbers depending on the features 
you use, you should also be tracking interactions including
	
✓	Connections: Instead of focusing on how many connections you’ve 
amassed, examine how many connection offers you’ve sent versus how 
many have been accepted. The more thoughtful you are about connect­
ing with people you know, the more likely they’ll accept your connection 
offer.
	
✓	Recommendations and Endorsements given and received: Track these 
manually. You will receive e-mail notices when others endorse or rec­
ommend you. For more information, see “Providing endorsements” and 
“Giving and receiving recommendations” earlier in this chapter.
	
✓	Links clicked: Track clicks on links you’ve used in your LinkedIn posts 
using a URL shortener like bitly (www.bitly.com) or a management 
tool like HootSuite (www.hootsuite.com). You may be posting, but 
gauge if people are responding to what you post.
	
✓	Number of mentions: Use LinkedIn Signal (www.linkedin.com/
signal) to search for your name, your company name, or any other 
keyword related to your company to see how many times others have 
posted about you.
Going mobile
You can access your LinkedIn account using the 
LinkedIn mobile app. You can peruse top news 
and recent updates; like, comment, and share 
updates from others; share your own updates; 
edit your profile; manage your messages; 
interact with your groups, jobs, and compa­
nies; all on the tiny screen of your smartphone. 
The app is available for iPhone, iPad, Android 
phones, BlackBerry, and Windows phones.

Part IV: Engaging Through Additional Social Channels 
	
✓	Number and quality of inquiries: You may be getting a lot of messages 
in your LinkedIn inbox, but are they quality inquiries or requests to con­
nect? Track how many of these connections are turning into real busi­
ness, but remember that it takes time to cultivate any connection.
	
With a paid version of LinkedIn, you can see who has viewed your profile and 
use this information to potentially follow up to do business. With the free ver­
sion, you can peruse a list of the people whose profiles others have viewed in 
addition to viewing yours. You cannot see who viewed your profile with a free 
account.
Analyzing engagement
In addition to scanning your own profile activity to get a sense of how pro­
active and interactive you are on LinkedIn and how responsive others are 
to you, here are some other numbers you can track to see how well you’re 
leveraging LinkedIn engagement features each week or month:
	
✓	Number of updates you’ve posted: Note how many people are liking and 
commenting on your updates.
	
✓	Number of updates from others you’ve shared: Share what others are 
posting as another way to connect with your network.
	
✓	Number of discussions you started in Groups: You should also partici­
pate in discussions started by others.
	
✓	Number of answers you’ve submitted: You should also pose questions 
in the Answers section.
Checking the business benefits
All of your effort is commendable, but you should also assess how well your 
LinkedIn presence is serving you and your company by tracking the following:
	
✓	Direct inquiries to do business: Although it’s nice to receive requests to 
connect, the more valuable inquiry is one to actually do business with you.
	
✓	Number of introduction requests passed along for you: Take advantage 
of one of the best ways to get warm leads and introductions to other 
LinkedIn members who can open new business opportunities for you.
	
✓	Number of introduction requests received: Especially note if these 
introductions lead to any solid business.
	
✓	Growth of your network: Expand your network thoughtfully so that 
each connection can potentially be a conduit for new business and 
genuine contacts.

Google+
In This Chapter
▶	Finding out how Google+ can help your business
▶	Getting started with Google+
▶	Interacting with other Google+ users
▶	Hanging out, circling, and building a community
T

his chapter explores the ever-expanding features of Google+, the social 
networking platform (also known as G+) developed by the big search-
engine company Google. Think of G+ as being a cross between Facebook 
and Twitter, providing the longer-form posting of Facebook with comments 
directly attached to posts, and the ability to group content as you can with 
Twitter Lists.
Trust us when we say Google is not satisfied being like Facebook or Twitter 
and is working nonstop to be different and better. At this writing (Global Web 
Index, January 2013), Google+ is the No. 2 social network, with an estimated 
343 million active users, compared with 693 million on Facebook and 288 mil­
lion on Twitter.
Checking Out the Benefits of Google+
Google wants to make sharing easy and natural no matter where you are 
online and its suite of online communications tools dominate the Internet. 
Google+ is still a work-in-progress, and the company seems to be pretty 
responsive to feedback from users regarding features. The main features of 
G+ are
	
✓	Profiles: Like all the other social networks we discuss in this book, G+ 
starts with your individual profile, including a photo, occupation, skills, 
and employment details. Google profiles are for individuals and contain 
many of the same features as other social network profiles, such as a 
photo, an About section, and a content stream. See Figure 13-1 for an 
example of a G+ profile.

Figure 13-1: 
A Google+ 
profile.
	
	
✓	Circles: A G+ Circle is a grouping of your connections. You can circle 
connections such as business contacts, work colleagues, or personal 
friends to direct your posts to specific people or to filter your home 
page content stream and see only posts from specific circles. 
	
✓	Communities: Like Facebook or LinkedIn groups, this newer feature is 
ideal for group discussions and collaboration.
	
✓	Photos: Upload, organize, share, and even edit images using the G+ suite 
of photo tools. G+ is a visual network, so photos are showcased nicely 
with a slide show feature.
	
✓	Events: Invite others to your event, and you can add the event to 
everyone’s Google Calendar.
	
✓	Hangouts: Organize face-to-face video conferencing with up to ten 
people, including screen sharing and Google Docs integration.
	
✓	+1: You can publicly recommend a page on the web by clicking the +1 
button that appears either on the site or on Google. +1ing — as Google 
refers to the action — is similar to clicking a “like” or “favorite” button.
We discuss all these features in this chapter.
Getting Your Feet Wet on Google+
Setting up a Google+ account starts with signing up for a Google account, 
which is your single access to all Google sites and tools. To sign up, you fill 
out a standard registration form in which you enter your name, a username, 
password, birthdate, and gender.
www.Ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.Ebook777.com
265
 Chapter 13: Google+
You are also asked to include your mobile number and current e-mail 
address, meaning something other than a Gmail account. If you already 
have a Gmail account, then you can log in to all Google products using that 
account, including Google+.
After you sign up and sign in, you’re ready to move to the next step: creating 
your profile.
Building your personal profile
When you first set up your G+ account, you are given a chance to fill in your 
profile. As with setting up a profile in any social network, we recommend fill­
ing out as much as possible from the start. You can also return to your pro­
file settings by clicking on the Profile icon to the left of your G+ Home page.
As you build your profile, you are prompted to enter the usual information 
such as an introduction or bio with a photo, your occupation, employment, 
education, and contact information. G+ also provides a field for a tagline and 
“bragging rights” or your accomplishments. You can control visibility for all 
elements of your G+ profile except Tagline and Photo.
	
To make your profile easier for people to find, make it visible in a search by 
selecting the Profile Discovery option. You should also be able to claim or 
change your custom Google+ URL in the same section of your profile.
The Google+ registration page also includes several optional fields: 
Relationship, Looking For, Birthday, and Gender. You can fill them out or not; 
it’s up to you. Make your choices based on what works for your public image 
as a representative of your company.
	
Google+ vanity or custom URLs for your personal G+ account or business page 
are rolled out by Google over time. If you don’t see a blue Claim URL button at 
the upper-right side of your page when you set it up, you might see it later. In 
the meantime, you can use a site like GPlus.to (http://gplus.to) to claim a 
shorter URL.
	
After you verify your website can be — or is — listed on Google’s search 
engine, add this line of code to your site:
<a href=“https://plus.google.com/[yourpageID]” rel=“publisher”>Find us on 
Google+</a>
To find your G+ page URL, go to your page and copy the web address straight 
from your browser address bar. Then link your website to your Google+ page 
by editing your profile and clicking Website, then adding your website URL to 
your G+ profile. Google does the rest.

Part IV: Engaging Through Additional Social Channels 
Setting up a Google+ business page
Although you may already have a personal presence on Google+ through an 
individual account, Google encourages you to set up a business page. A G+ 
page looks similar to a personal G+ profile, but is for a brand, organization, or 
company. You can have a company profile and post updates to your content 
stream. See Figure 13-2 for an example of a G+ page.
	
Figure 13-2: 
Beth’s 
Cafe in 
Seattle has 
a Google 
Local Place 
page.
	
Pages require a personal profile to “own” a business page, but the identity 
of the page owner remains hidden to page visitors. After you complete the 
initial page setup, you can add other managers, similar to Facebook Page 
administrators (admins).
Some main differences between G+ profiles and pages are
	
✓	Restricted circling and sharing: Pages can’t add people to circles until 
those people first add or mention the page. As an individual with a 
profile, you can circle anyone and any page. Also, pages can’t share to 
extended circles. They are limited to sharing to their direct circles.
	
✓	No instant chat: If you have enabled the instant chat function as an indi­
vidual on G+, you will see your connections who are currently online on 
the right side of your home page and can message them directly. Pages 
do not have access to individuals via chat.
	
✓	+1 restrictions: Pages can’t +1 content on the web, even if there is a +1 
button because it will always show up tied to your personal profile. Both 
profiles and pages can +1 content inside Google+, such as posts, photos, 
and videos.
	
	Pages contain the +1 button so people can endorse the page itself. On 
profiles, only content you post can receive +1s.

267
 Chapter 13: Google+
	
✓	Administration: Pages can have multiple managers. Profiles are for indi­
viduals so unless you give someone else access to your personal Google 
account, only you can manage your profile.
Think about your Google+ page as another way to increase your company 
presence online, giving you more opportunity to show up in relevant Google 
searches. Your Google+ page also enhances any advertising you’re doing or 
plan to do with Google.
Setting up an effective page
To create a new page on G+, you can either go to www.google.com/+/
business or click the Pages icon on the left side of your G+ Home page. To 
set up your page, you need to do the following:
	
1.	Choose an appropriate type of page.
	
	 If your business has a physical location where customers can frequent, 
for example, select Local Business or Place when setting up your G+ 
page to have your page show up in Google Maps. Google+ prompts you 
to enter your phone number so it can find you through your phone 
company listing. Other Main categories are Product or Brand; Company, 
Institution, or Organization; Arts, Entertainment, or Sports, and Other. 
	
2.	Choose a category.
	
	 When you select Company, Institution, or Organization, you then have 
to pick an appropriate category for your page such as Media, News and 
Publishing, or Travel and Leisure.
	
	 You can’t change your category after you create your page, so choose 
wisely.
	
3.	Add info and agree to Terms of Service.
	
	 Fill in your company name, a website, and specify whether your page 
content will be appropriate for all G+ users or restricted to specific ages 
such as over 18 or over 21. Alcohol companies must select Alcohol-
related. Select the check box to agree to Google’s Terms of Service, and 
then click the Continue button.
	
4.	Add your “story,” contact information, and change your images.
	
	 Enter a short statement — limited to ten words — about your company 
that gives people a clear first impression. This feature is not available to 
Local Pages. You’re also prompted to change your cover that appears at 
the top of your page as a banner.

	 Hover your cursor over the rectangular image at the top of your page 
and click Change Cover Photo. Click Upload on the left, then click Select 
a Photo From Your Computer if that’s where your photo resides. You 
can select photos and cover images that you’ve already uploaded to 
your page. Once uploaded, click your cover image and drag it to reposi­
tion it as needed. Cover image sizes can be as large as 2120 x 1192 pixels 
or as small as 480 x 270 pixels. 
	
	 Upload your page’s profile image that is 250 x 250 pixels. As with any 
social network, pick an image that best represents your company and 
looks good at a reduced size. This could be your company logo or 
another image consistent with your brand.
	
	 At any time you can return to Edit mode to continue modifying your pro­
file by clicking on the About tab on your company’s G+ Home page. The 
sections within the About tab — People; Story; Contact Information; and 
Links — are editable by clicking the Edit text link below each one.
	
5.	Add admins to your page to help handle page management.
	
	 Add admins on the Settings page: Click the gear button under the right 
corner of your cover image or in the drop-down menu in the upper-right 
side of your G+ page. Click Manage; then invite other page managers by 
entering their e-mail addresses in the open field and clicking the Invite 
button. You can also transfer page ownership from here.
Start posting to your content stream to attract attention. See “Posting multi­
media” later in this chapter.
	
If you don’t have a lot of people in your page’s circles yet, start circling strate­
gically. Since you have to wait until someone circles you back before they can 
see your posts, you should post an invitation to your new G+ page publicly 
through your personal profile for a wider reach. If you want a more targeted 
reach, send your announcement to specific circles of people within your 
personal profile. 
Getting Google authorship
You can verify that you’re the author of content 
on sites you either own, control, or where you 
have an e-mail address matching the domain of 
the website. The theory behind claiming author­
ship is that your name and photo could appear 
in Google Search when associated with the 
content where you are the verified author.
Note that Google is careful to state that claiming 
authorship doesn’t guarantee that your name will 
appear in Google Search. Still, if you’re publish­
ing content on the web, attaching that content to 
your G+ profile and vice versa can only improve 
how people find and connect with you.
To claim authorship, visit https://plus.
google.com/authorship.

 Chapter 13: Google+
Getting into the Flow of G+
As we mention earlier, Google+ is similar in certain ways to both Facebook 
and Twitter. A main difference among the three networks is that only G+ lets 
you filter streams of content by particular groups based on the circles you’ve 
created and the people and pages you’ve designated into those circles.
For a while, G+ was the only service to let you sort your contacts into groups 
to target the posts you published. Now Facebook lets you group your friends 
and then post targeting Public, Friends, Friends except Acquaintances, 
Only Me, and Custom. The Custom options on Facebook and G+ are similar, 
allowing you to name specific people to add or exclude from your targeting. 
Customizing and targeting your content is still a core aspect of Google+.
Leveraging long-form publishing
Google claims that you have no limits to the number of characters you can 
use in your posts on the service. Most people, however, still post shorter 
updates with just a few sentences. Others treat the G+ platform as an alterna­
tive to a blog, posting on average between 400 to 600 words. 
When you have more to say, you can do it on G+ easily. Only the first portion 
of your post shows up, but after someone clicks the link to read more, the 
entire post opens. Information designer and consultant Dave Gray created 
the long-form post shown in Figure 13-3, discussing G+ benefits such as long-
form posting.
	
Figure 13-3:

In terms of readability and people’s attention spans, more words aren’t 
necessarily more effective.

When you post, you can put an asterisk (*Aliza*) on either side of a word to 
make it bold, and underscore (_Danielle_) when you would like to italicize a 
word. Use these styles to help your text stand out in the G+ stream.
Posting multimedia
Just as visuals win on Facebook Pages, photos and videos are important to 
attracting attention, generating +1s and comments, and garnering those cov­
eted shares on Google+. Text alone as a post may disappear in someone’s 
content stream with so many eye-catching things to look at and react to as 
the stream moves by.
Photos and video
Author C. C. Chapman engages frequently on his Google+ profile and posts 
a variety of content from other sources including articles, blog posts, and 
video. He also provides links to his own blog posts and includes a lot of his 
own images in those posts. Figure 13-4 shows how he uses visuals.
	
Figure 13-4:

use of video

account

interest to

Documents
On G+, you aren’t limited to photos and videos. You can enrich your updates 
with your Google documents, spreadsheets, presentations, forms, PDFs, and 
any other file types supported in Google Drive. People in your circles can 
then open and interact with these documents directly in your stream without 
having to leave G+. You can set any file you want to share to Public On the 
Web or Anyone With the Link.

 Chapter 13: Google+
Slide shows
When you upload photos to G+, especially as photo albums, people can view 
your images as a slide show. Use high resolution images to take advantage of 
the bold and dramatic interface of the slide shows with your images appear­
ing in a large format on a black backdrop. See Figure 13-5 for an example of a 
G+ slide show on the web.
	
Figure 13-5: 
Google+ 
lets you dis-

albums in

format.
	
Interacting in the stream
Google+ enthusiasts will tell you that one of the things they love about the 
platform is how active their streams are and how much G+ users participate. 
Although we tend to agree with this, the truth is that your G+ stream is active 
only if many people have circled your page and if you are very active on the 
network.
When you first log into G+, you’re accessing as yourself — an individual — by 
default. You can easily access your page and use G+ as your page in several 
ways: Click the Pages icon on the left side of your G+ Home page and click 
Switch to Page. Or hover your cursor over the Pages icon to see a list of the 
G+ pages you’ve created. 
Another way to enter Page mode is on the upper-right side of your G+ screen; 
click the upside down triangle to the right of your profile photo and select 
your Page. The Manage Your Pages screen, shown in Figure 13-6, displays 
the pages you’ve created, as well as the pages you manage along with some 
cursory stats for each page. If you manage more than one G+ page, they all 
appear here. You can also create a new page from the Manage Your pages 
section.

Figure 13-6: 
The Manage 
Your Pages 
screen.
	
Once you are accessing G+ as your page, you can be active in a number of 
ways similar to individuals, including by
	
✓	Posting regularly: Whether you post text, photos, or videos, or whether 
you post your own content or links to other people’s content, developing 
a regular rhythm for posting on G+ is key to successful engagement. To 
get noticed, G+ requires more frequent posting than a Facebook Page, but 
not necessarily as much as needed on Twitter, although it couldn’t hurt.
	
✓	+1ing other people’s or pages’ posts: The +1 on Google+ is similar to the 
Like on Facebook. It’s a quick acknowledgement and positive endorse­
ment of content or a page.
	
✓	Commenting on other people’s or pages’ posts: Be thoughtful and 
noncommercial with your comments, adding to the conversation in an 
appropriate way.
	
✓	Sharing other people’s or pages’ posts: Share posts that your follow­
ing will appreciate and that reflect well on your brand. Sharing makes a 
more meaningful gesture that can lead to an actual connection.
	
✓	Targeting and tagging people and pages: Send posts into the streams of 
specific people or pages for greater custom targeting of your messages.
	
	By adding the + sign or @ sign in front of a person’s name or company’s 
name, you tag them so their name is a link in your post and the mention 
appears in their streams. They’ll also get a notification depending on 
how they’ve configured their notification settings. You can only @ men­
tion people who are on Google+. You can share your posts with people 
who aren’t members of G+ by entering their e-mail addresses after the + 
or @ signs.
	
If you are only a manager for a G+ page and not the creator, you won’t see the 
page show up when you hover over your Pages icon unless you’re operating 
as the page. You will, however, see all the pages you’ve created and the ones 
you manage on the Manage Your Pages section.

 Chapter 13: Google+
After you’re operating as your page, your personal identity isn’t visible when 
you post. When interacting as your page, you can do nearly everything you 
can as an individual G+ user with the exception of not being able to invite 
individuals to instant chat with your page. As a page, you can post, create 
photo albums, edit photos, and upload video.
Building your page audience
Building your page audience goes hand in hand with populating your page 
with content. As you reach out and direct people to your page, you want to 
make sure interesting content is there to prompt them to circle your page 
and engage with you. Like any presence you build in social media, you need 
to implement a combination of tactics to help people find your page, profile, 
or account while giving them compelling reasons to connect with you.
To start, fill out your page profile so your G+ page looks professional and 
complete. Add your company name, add images to customize it, fill out the 
About section to give people relevant information about your business, and 
provide more ways and reasons to connect with you.
Some other ways to get people to your Google+ page include
	
✓	Inviting others to G+: When your page is ready, post an invitation with 
a link to your page on your G+ profile as an update. Use a third-party 
social media management tool such as Hootsuite Pro to schedule 
regular — but not too frequent — posts to your personal G+ account 
reminding people that you have a business page.
	
✓	Embedding the G+ badge: Install the G+ badge on your website or 
blog so your visitors and customers can add your page to their circles 
directly from your site. The badge lets Google track your +1s from your 
own site and your G+ page, and higher +1s can have a positive effect on 
your Google rankings.
	
✓	Linking to your page: Look for places besides your website and blog 
where you can link to your G+ page, such as in your profiles on other 
social networks and in your e-mail signature.
	
✓	Sharing your page by e-mail: Expand your reach beyond G+ to build 
awareness of your page. Use your other channels and communications 
tools, including your e-mail newsletter, Facebook Page, Twitter account, 
and YouTube channel to announce the launch of your G+ page and 
repeat that message where and when appropriate.
	
✓	Sharing your page via social network posts: Pepper in occasional posts 
on your other social networks to let your audience know you have a 
page on Google+. Being connected to people in several places where 
they spend their time online can help you engage them.

Part IV: Engaging Through Additional Social Channels 
Although it may be tempting to circle everyone who circles you, note that 
some — or many — of those who have you in their circles may not be the 
appropriate audience for your page. For example, they may be in another 
country, and if your business serves only a local or U.S.-based clientele, those 
fans may not be a fit. Or if you’re trying to reach new moms for example, an 
older male executive may not be your audience. Take a look at their G+ post 
streams or their profiles to gauge if they’re the right audience for your page.
To further build your page circles, while in Page mode, search for keywords 
pertaining to your business. For example, if you’re a wine company, you can 
search for wine and find posts from people or pages you aren’t following. 
Circle individuals with care and thoughtfully comment on their posts. Follow 
other pages of companies that are complementary to your business.
	
You can choose to show or not to show the people and pages you’ve circled 
or who has circled your page on your page’s profile. To reveal or hide this 
information, go to the About section of your profile; then click Edit under the 
People section of your profile. Your choices include which of your circles to 
show and if the public or just your circles can see that. You can also view 
who has circled your page in this section and opt to make that list visible or 
hidden. Once you’ve saved your changes and leave the About section, you’re 
out of Edit mode.
Expanding Your Google+ Engagement
For all intents and purposes, using G+ as your company page is similar to 
using the network as an individual. You want to be friendly, attentive, respon­
sive, and interesting. The main difference between interacting as your page 
or as an individual is that you will probably want to be more strategic as your 
page and more aware of consistent messaging and branding. The more you 
reach out to others on G+, you’ll get a greater response and form stronger 
connections.
Circling your connections
Google is the first major social network to provide the ability to share your 
messages with specific audiences. As a page, you can create circles of your 
connections based on any criteria you want. Some examples of circles are 
team members, vendors, fans, competitors, and other relevant groupings. 
You can also manage the posts you see in your home page stream based on 
these circles. Figure 13-7 shows an example of the Circles page.
To be able to engage with others on Google+, you need to circle them and 
they need to circle you back. When you circle them, you see their posts in 
your content stream. If they don’t circle you back, they won’t see your posts.

275
 Chapter 13: Google+
In a way, circling is like following on Twitter. You can follow someone else 
and see her content, but until she follows you back, the communication is 
mostly one way.
	
Figure 13-7: 
Create and 
manage 
your page’s 
circles on 
your Circles 
page.
	
You can reach out to the people you follow by giving a +1 (like a YouTube 
Thumbs Up or Facebook Like) on their posts or commenting appropriately. 
By doing so, you’re getting onto someone’s radar, and your profile photo and 
name are visible to the other person. They can still however, choose not to 
circle you.
Connecting with groups in Hangouts
With your Google+ account comes the ability to participate in or organize 
a videoconferencing meeting with up to ten people called a Hangout. Pages 
have the same ability as individuals to create and participate in a Google 
Hangout. See Figure 13-8 for an example of a Hangout.
You can use Hangouts for virtual team meetings, tutoring, interviews, viewing 
YouTube videos with others, troubleshooting support, consulting, webinars, 
and presentations (to limited audiences).
Starting a Hangout
You can launch a Hangout easily by clicking the Hangout button on the 
upper-right corner of your G+ screen from the home page, your Page’s pro­
file, Explore (the area streaming popular content on G+), and Events and 
Communities (see more about Google Communities later in this chapter). 
You can launch a Hangout as a Page or as yourself as an individual. We 
recommend building your company’s brand and using Hangouts as a Page 
publicly. You can also initiate a more private Hangout amongst your internal 
team.

Take advantage of Hangout collaborative features including screen sharing,

After you are inside a Hangout, you can click the Add App button and view 
the various apps that you can add. You can also take screenshots of your 
Hangout using the Capture button to the left of your screen with the camera 
graphic.
	
If someone can’t join your Hangout through G+, you can call the person and 
conference her in. Just click the Invite button and then click the +telephone 
link. Calls to the U.S. and Canada are free through VoIP (Voice Over Internet 
Protocol) technology, which allows you to make calls over the Internet. 
International call rates are low, according to Google.
Scheduling Hangouts with Google Events
Use the G+ Events feature to promote your 
public Hangouts. You can also use Events to 
invite people to any online or offline event. 
If your event is offline, you can allow attend­
ees to contribute photos from the event to a 
shared photo album. If you or they are using 
the Google+ app at the party, you can also add 
photos to the shared photo album in real time.
You can schedule regular Hangouts and use 
Google Events to invite people to them and 
place them on everyone’s Google Calendar if 
they have a Google account.

Broadcasting interactively with Hangouts On Air
To take your hangouts to the masses, switch on the Hangouts On Air feature. 
This enhanced hangout option broadcasts your Hangout live to your Google+ 
profile or page stream, your YouTube channel, and your website or anywhere 
else you embed the viewer. Like regular Hangouts, Hangouts On Air include 
text chat so a broader audience can join the conversation and interact even 
if they are not participating via video. See Figure 13-9 for an example of a 
Google+ Hangout On Air viewed on YouTube.

To share your Hangouts more broadly, check the Enable Hangouts On Air 
button as you start a Hangout. While you are broadcasting, you’ll be able to 
see how many viewers you’ve gained. When you sign off the air, a recording 
of your public Hangout is automatically uploaded to your YouTube chan­
nel. The archived video also appears on your original G+ post when you 
announced the Hangout.
	
At the time of this writing, Pages could not participate or organize a Hangout 
on a mobile device. Both pages and profiles can start a Hangout from a com­
puter, but only individuals can participate in Hangouts through their mobile 
devices. If you want to start a Hangout for your page, connect to G+ via a 
computer.
Video is a powerful medium, and you can use live and archived Hangouts On 
Air for a variety of purposes where using video for public viewing by a larger 
number of people makes sense. Ideal uses for Hangouts On Air include pre­
sentations and webinars, live shows, town hall-style meetings, press confer­
ences, performances, and other events.

Part IV: Engaging Through Additional Social Channels 
Leveraging the power of +1
Google+ gives people a way to endorse web content and to give it their ver­
sion of “like” or “thumbs up” through their +1 buttons. The +1 button appears 
throughout Google’s suite of tools including Google.com search results; 
Google+ pages; and G+ posts including videos, articles, comments, and 
photos.
People can +1 your page directly or through the content you post to your 
page. In a more pervasive way, they can +1 your page if they see it on other 
sites on the web — either owned by Google or in the Google Display Network 
and through Google search results.
When someone is signed in to Google+ and then clicks the +1 button, Google 
includes annotations in search results that can show up for his connections, 
letting them know that he’s endorsed something. Similar to how Facebook 
shows people if their friends have liked the page of an advertiser right within 
an ad, Google shows people’s +1 activity to their connections.
As a business, the integration of the +1 button means that you can incorpo­
rate other people’s endorsements for your company and content into your 
advertising and outreach. As you promote your company, people can see 
when their connections have given your page or your content a +1.
You can leverage the +1 feature several ways, including
	
✓	Adding the +1 button to your website or blog: You can generate code 
for a G+ button for your business and embed it into your site or blog, 
allowing your visitors to add you without having to travel away from 
your site or blog. Google provides the code and graphics for a variety of 
+1 buttons for your website or blog; see Figure 13-10.
	
✓	Connecting your website and G+ account: Connect +1s for your website 
with +1s on your Google+ page and your Google ads. After you create 
your G+ page, add a line of code on your site to connect them so Google 
can begin tracking your combined +1s.
	
✓	Using social extensions: Social extensions let you link recommendations 
about your company and content from others to your AdWords cam­
paigns. When you connect your Google+ page to your ads, Google can 
show your customer endorsements for your business in combination 
with your ads. A +1 on your ad applies to your Google+ page’s +1 count. 
The reverse is also true, so +1s from your Google+ page are applied to 
your AdWords ads. Although AdWords campaigns cost money, any +1s 
you accumulate on your page or ad through your ad campaigns doesn’t 
cost anything extra.

Collaborating in Google+ communities
A new feature offered to companies with G+ pages is the ability to form an 
online community and invite others to participate in it. The community can 
be a place for discussion and to post photographs, events, and other content. 
Figure 13-11 shows an example of a G+ community with updates from members 
that can be +1’d, commented on, or shared — just like profiles and pages.
	
Figure 13-11: 
A G+ 
community.
	
The goal of communities is to bring together an affinity group for conversa­
tion and collaboration. Anyone can join other communities forming on G+ 
ranging from industry networks to cause-related groups. Communities take 
a lot of time to manage, whether you’re building one on your G+ or your 
Facebook Page, Twitter, LinkedIn, or any other social network.
G+ communities are similar to Facebook or LinkedIn Groups in that they are 
all geared toward deeper discussions among group members. Each is useful 
for bringing together like-minded individuals or actual clubs, organizations, 
www.Ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.Ebook777.com
280
Part IV: Engaging Through Additional Social Channels 
or groups that have already formed and are seeking an online forum where 
they carry out ongoing discussions.
The main difference that separates G+ communities from Facebook or 
LinkedIn is the ability to categorize discussion content. When you create 
your community, you can add discussion categories such as Photos, 
Reviews, Q&A, or Tips. As people post to the community, they can select the 
appropriate category and then anyone in the community can sort content by 
category. Other than this feature, G+ communities are more similar than not 
to Facebook and LinkedIn Groups.
To create a G+ Community, click the Communities button on the left side of 
your G+ screen. To attach it to your G+ Page, make sure you’re in page mode 
before clicking the Create Community button in the Communities section. 
You have the choice of creating a Public or Private community. If public, you 
can choose to let anyone join, or have a moderator approve before letting 
someone join. If private, you can either opt to hide it from searches, or allow 
it to be found but require that people ask permission to join.
Your community’s privacy setting cannot be changed after you choose Public 
or Private, so select with care based on the goals of your community.
After you set up your community, Google+ prompts you to
	
✓	Write a tagline. Make it short and compelling.
	
✓	Pick a photo. The optimal photo size is 250 x 250 pixels (like profile 
photos). Otherwise, you have to crop the image.
	
✓	Complete the About section. Google also encourages you to include 
community guidelines in the About section.
	
✓	Add a few discussion categories. The category feature is a major differ­
ence among G+ communities and Facebook or LinkedIn groups. You can 
pre-establish categories that community members can choose for their 
posts and more easily filter posts based on category.
After you create a community, Google+ immediately prompts you to invite 
others to it. If you’re acting as your page, you can invite only people in your 
page’s circles. After you create a community through your page, you can per­
sonally join the community (via your profile) and make yourself and others 
community managers; then you can invite people to the new community in 
your personal G+ circles. If you’ve formed the Community as an individual, 
you can also join the Community as your page and then give your page man­
ager status.
	
Managing a community takes a lot of time and attention. Not every company 
needs an additional community beyond the ones that organically form in 
social networks. Carefully consider if a more active community is right for you 
before embarking on more intensive community-building.

T

his chapter details how you can hold the power of community and social 
media engagement in the palm of your hand — literally. An amazing thing 
happened in the past decade: Our telephones became more portable and 
more powerful than you probably ever imagined. With smartphones, we’re 
carrying mini computers around, not to mention still and video cameras, 
audio recording devices, and myriad other tools that use a variety of software 
applications.
The increasing ubiquity of smartphones brings a seemingly endless supply 
of mobile applications you can download for free, or for a small fee, that 
perform many different functions. Some of those applications lead to social 
networks accessed primarily on mobile devices instead of through the web. 
These social mobile networks often use the GPS feature in smartphones as an 
integral part of their services. All of the popular web-based social networks 
that have corresponding mobile apps can also tap into your location coordi­
nates. In this chapter, we focus mostly on the social networks predominantly 
based in mobile apps, which we call location-based services (LBS).

Social mobile networks give you a whole new way to engage with your cus­
tomers and prospects. You may have been told that reaching others in their 
e-mail inboxes or through their favorite social networks on the web is a 
more intimate way to communicate and connect with them. Making contact 
through someone’s smartphone or other hand-held mobile device ups that 
intimacy even further.

Part IV: Engaging Through Additional Social Channels 
A location-based service is a social mobile network that ties directly into 
your mobile device’s Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates and uses 
your location to tag your photos and your posts. Location and place are an 
integral part of how these services work. Practically every social mobile net­
work prompts you to give permission to access your location to unlock func­
tionality tied to where you are at any given moment.
	
Using LBS means you can connect and communicate with others, combin­
ing both a physical location and a mobile device. Location plays a major part 
in the functionality of an LBS, so look for ways to tie in places to your social 
media engagement messaging and outreach.
Choosing an LBS (or two)
Here are some of the popular and newer social mobile networks that rely on 
or incorporate your location:
	
✓	Foursquare (https://foursquare.com): If you have a business with a 
physical location, you can claim the actual address on this service based 
on the GPS coordinates, allowing your customers to check in there. 
People nearby can discover your establishment and read tips or recom­
mendations. The service also includes gaming features and badges. It 
combines check-ins, tips, deals, and images. This service is available — 
and most commonly used — on smartphones: iPhones, Androids, 
BlackBerry, and Windows Phone.
	
✓	Path (https://path.com): This service aggregates check-ins, photos, 
videos, music, movies, and other moments that you create on Path or 
by importing content from other social networks. It emphasizes smaller 
connections — limited to 150 people — so it’s more suitable for 
communicating with niche groups. You can use this service on iPhones 
and Androids.
	
✓	Foodspotting (www.foodspotting.com): Use this app to take 
photographs of meals at eating establishments and to find places to eat 
by perusing snapshots of dishes served nearby. Even if you aren’t a res­
taurant, you can build your reputation by sharing great food images and 
reviews that tie back to your brand. This service is available for iPhones, 
Androids, BlackBerry, and Windows Phone.
	
✓	SCVNGR (http://scvngr.com): You can build games or challenges 
that others can play based around locations — think scavenger hunt. As 
a business, you can brand experiences that other people can enjoy. It’s 
available for iPhones and Androids.
	
	For a related suggestion, see the sidebar “Engaging with geocaching,” at 
the end of this chapter.

 Chapter 14: Location-Based Services
	
✓	Yelp (www.yelp.com): Yelp (see Figure 14-1) started as a web-based 
review site where users could leave reviews of businesses. Its mobile 
app also includes discovery of places nearby with the reviews. As a busi­
ness, you should review what people are saying about you. The app is 
available for iPhones, Androids, Windows, BlackBerry, and Palm.
	
Figure 14-1: 
Yelp is both 
a review 
website 
and a social 
mobile app.
	
	
In addition to LBS, you can market to and engage customers through their 
mobile devices in other ways. Near field communication (NFC) lets two devices 
(a data chip and a smartphone, for example) in the same area communicate 
with one another. And location-based advertising (LBA) uses geofencing, in 
which virtual boundaries trigger pop-up messages on people’s mobile devices 
when they are moving within specific locations. Learn more about these 
topics in the book Location Based Marketing For Dummies, by Aaron Strout 
(John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).
Setting up an LBS account
As a business, you can establish presences on LBS as an individual represent­
ing your company or a “personality,” as the company itself, or both.
	
We recommend that you set up both company accounts and personal 
accounts and limit the number of people who can post to your company 
account. In social media engagement, you want to infuse your brand with per­
sonality and presence so that people want to connect and interact with your 
company. Having a brand presence on LBS is a perfectly acceptable way to 
demonstrate aspects of your brand that can attract customers and prospects 
and deepen relationships.

Part IV: Engaging Through Additional Social Channels 
Personal accounts
Using an individual, personal account on any LBS is convenient and easy to 
set up. Also, people like to first and foremost connect with other people. A 
personal photo in a profile is much more approachable than a company logo.
	
If you go the individual route, you may end up with less company branding 
and some brand confusion. You also have to be careful not to use your per­
sonal account in a personal manner that may not properly reflect your brand 
image. If you want team members to participate on behalf of the brand, you 
don’t want them to use your personal account, but setting up multiple per­
sonal accounts for people who are supposed to represent your brand means 
more accounts to monitor.
Business accounts
Using an LBS as a company keeps your brand image consistent and carries it 
over into the new social mobile space. There is a lot to be said about brand­
ing consistency in social media engagement. Because most LBS are not set 
up specifically for companies, you may have to finesse some of the profile 
elements to convey the personality of the brand and not an individual person 
behind your brand.
	
Going the company or brand route can be problematic if you or your team 
members also have personal accounts on the same service. For the most part, 
LBS are not set up to accommodate multiple accounts on the same mobile 
device. In order to toggle between a personal and company account, you have 
to log out of one and log in to the other. You can get into some hot water if 
you forget which account you’re logged in to at any given time and post some­
thing inappropriate to your company account.
Making Connections with LBS
Although most LBS tap into your mobile device’s GPS, each one tries to dif­
ferentiate itself by using location data in different ways. Each service allows 
you to connect with others in the same way web-based social networks do. 
LBS have similar connection, conversation, and community-building features 
described throughout this book, such as profiles, friends, liking and favorit­
ing, and comments.
	
The difference between LBS and other types of smartphone apps that allow 
you to have a profile and connect with others is that it incorporates GPS as a 
basis for connection, discovery, and tagging posts to tie them to a place. Other 
social networks and mobile versions of social networks, such as Pinterest and 
LinkedIn, don’t make active use of location data.

 Chapter 14: Location-Based Services
Checking in to locations to engage others
The act of checking in to locations may seem like a strange activity, but 
millions of people do it every day as a way of connecting with others and 
announcing what they’re doing and where. Even if people are not actively 
checking in to a place using an app with a check-in feature, they might post 
from a location — your physical business location — and tag their post or 
even their photograph with GPS data. Many share these check-ins and geo­
tagged posts and photos on several social networks, including Facebook and 
Twitter.
People check in to locations for a variety of reasons:
	
✓	Letting their friends know where they are: When someone is frequent­
ing your establishment, encouraging them to check in can increase 
exposure to your brand and location.
	
✓	Organizing impromptu meet-ups with connections based on proximity: 
As a business, you can benefit from additional foot traffic when someone 
uses an LBS to gather others to your location.
	
✓	Broadcasting their activities as part of their general social network 
sharing: Check-ins share your location name, increasing your brand 
exposure.
	
✓	Leaving tips, kudos, or critiques of businesses they frequent: Use 
check-ins as a customer service and marketing tool by noting what 
people like or where they may have a complaint and taking action to 
improve their experiences.
	
✓	Accessing specials and deals from companies leveraging LBS market­
ing: Stimulate interactions with customers by tying deals and offers into 
popular LBS.
	
✓	Competing with their friends for status: This includes top positions on 
leaderboards, or badges, or kudos.
For details on how to use check-ins for promotions, see “Offering deals driven 
by check-ins,” later in this chapter.
	
GPS location isn’t highly accurate for indoor spaces. If you’re looking to create 
check-ins within an indoor space, ByteLights (http://bytelight.com) are 
LED lights that help feed data about a customer’s movement and activities 
within a confined space. The company’s technology claims one meter of accu­
racy, which is far closer than typical GPS provides.

Part IV: Engaging Through Additional Social Channels 
Discovering others nearby
Several LBS take professional networking to a whole new level using prox­
imity, or notifying you when people you know through social networks are 
nearby. Apps that point out proximity to people, places, and things are also 
known as geosocial discovery apps. 
Apps such as Banjo (http://ban.jo), Highlight (http://highlig.ht), 
and Sonar (http://sonar.me), all available for iPhones or Android phones, 
announce when people you might know are nearby. Highlight tells you when 
your Facebook friends and other Highlight users are physically close to you. 
Sonar uses data from your Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, and LinkedIn 
accounts while Banjo accesses data from Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, 
LinkedIn, Instagram, Vimeo, and Google to determine relevant connections. 
The app Here On Biz (http://hereon.biz/) taps solely into your LinkedIn 
account.
Using geosocial discovery apps can be helpful for real-world networking; 
you can meet social networking connections in person or meet friends of 
your connections through the serendipity of being nearby. Although you can 
link geosocial discovery apps to your company’s Twitter and Foursquare 
accounts, you can’t link them to your company’s Facebook Page or LinkedIn 
Company Page — only to your personal Facebook and LinkedIn accounts. 
Tying images to places 
through geotagging
Although some apps use active check-ins or automatically add geographic 
information to tie posts to physical locations, some also use geotagging to 
tie images, particularly photographs, to places. Some of these apps incorpo­
rate geotagging into main features on the service while others let you decide 
when to tie images to a location.
In addition to Foodspotting (mentioned earlier in this chapter), there are 
a number of LBS that center around geotagged photographs and content 
including
	
✓	Instagram (http://instagram.com): Instagram describes itself as 
“a fun and quirky way to share your life with friends through a series 
of pictures.” As a business, you can build a community by lifestreaming 
images to showcase your brand’s personality and provide a more inti­
mate look at your company. You can take photos, filter them, label them, 
and share them with your followers who can “like” them or comment 
on them. You can also integrate Instagram with other social networks 
www.Ebook777.com

287
 Chapter 14: Location-Based Services
as we detail later in this chapter. It’s available for iPhones and Android 
phones.
	
✓	Trover (www.trover.com): With this app, people find and explore 
places and hidden gems around the world. Even if you aren’t a company 
with a physical location or have anything to do with travel, you can 
create lists of local businesses as resource guides and build your brand 
and reputation on the network, exposing your brand to new people. It’s 
available for iPhone and Android.
	
✓	Wyst (http://wyst.it): Use this app to leave notes and photographs 
at specific locations to be accessed by others using the app when 
they’re in the vicinity. As a company, you can publish helpful notes 
around your local location or other places to build your brand and 
showcase your expertise. If you’re a business with a physical location or 
if being local is important to your business, this type of activity makes 
sense. Even if you’re traveling on business, you can “leave behind” vir­
tual posts for other Wyst users to find. It’s available for iPhone only.
As a business, you can use mobile photo sharing apps that use geotagging to 
tie images to your location or to tie your images to locations that others can 
discover in a search or when in close proximity to the location where your 
images are tagged.
	
Watch that you don’t accidentally reveal your location when you don’t mean 
to do so. As you set up social mobile networks on your smartphone or mobile 
device, make sure that you check settings and permissions within the app or 
on your phone to limit the use of your location data. Settings vary by each app 
and each type of phone.
Using LBS for Promotions
Not all LBS offer business features. Most are geared toward the individual 
user and aren’t tailored for companies or brands looking to engage with 
others through social mobile networks. Most LBS don’t offer separate or 
enhanced features for businesses like Facebook offers Facebook Pages, but 
they also don’t forbid companies from setting up personal accounts for their 
brands or businesses.
Most LBS don’t have features to accommodate companies or brands like 
LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Google+ offer with distinct Business Pages. Many 
newer social mobile networks tend to focus first on individual users to 
quickly build a large base that, in time, will be attractive to companies. 
Foursquare is an exception because it rolled out features to support compa­
nies fairly early in its development.

Part IV: Engaging Through Additional Social Channels 
	
Pushing messages to people on their mobile devices can come across as 
creepy or invasive. Make sure you get people’s permissions before adding 
them to your mobile or location-based marketing programs. Compiling your 
own mobile marketing list or using reputable LBS that people willingly join 
and are comfortable using reduces the chances that you’ll turn them off with 
your mobile actions.
Doing business with Foursquare
Foursquare offers businesses free tools for attracting, retaining, and reward­
ing customers.
Claiming your business
If you have a physical location for your business such as a retail store or 
restaurant, start by claiming your business on Foursquare at https://
foursquare.com/signup. Use Foursquare’s search function to check if 
your business is already listed. If so, you can claim it by clicking the Claim 
Here link under the text Do You Manage this Location? Follow Foursquare’s 
step-by-step instructions to claim your business.
If your business is not already listed, you can first add it while you are physi­
cally at your place of business and then follow the instructions to claim it.
Using Foursquare for business
After you have a claimed business location on Foursquare, you can update 
your listing and post updates from your location. You can also offer specials 
to attract customers and post events taking place at your location. Offer 
rewards to loyal customers — the mayors — who check in to your establish­
ment often. Only one person can be mayor of an establishment at a time.
As shown in Figure 14-2, Foursquare also provides analytics for your claimed 
business. You can see check-in activity, including number of check-ins and 
how many were broadcast to Facebook, Twitter, or both. You can also see 
information about the mayor of your location and top visitors. Foursquare 
also sends weekly e-mails with the most recent tips and photos submitted by 
your customers.
	
Change your specials often enough to keep repeat customers interested, and 
be clear about what you’re offering and how customers who check in can 
access or claim the offer.
Tell your customers that your business is on Foursquare and encourage 
them to check in. You can order a free window cling to put into your estab­
lishment’s window to signify that you’re on Foursquare. Foursquare also lets 
you set up events at your location so customers can check in to an event at 
your establishment.

Tapping into the power of Instagram
Instagram is a wildly popular social mobile network that, until the end of 
2012, existed only on smartphones. The value of Instagram’s super loyal user-
base and photo-sharing community was confirmed when Facebook bought 
the company for $1 billion. Photographs are a powerful part of online story­
telling, and we talk earlier in this book about how images are an important 
part of social content and social media engagement.
Sharing photos on popular networks
Use Instagram to take, filter, and share images on popular social networks 
in addition to the Instagram community. You can set up an account on 
Instagram as your company in the same way you’d set up a personal account.
As a business, you can use Instagram to tell stories about your company, 
product, or services. Some ideas for images you can post include
	
✓	Behind-the-scenes at your company headquarters or locations
	
✓	Events you host or attend
	
✓	Images from your business travels
	
✓	Product images
	
✓	Images that portray themes in line with your brand messages
	
✓	How-to or demonstration shots
	
✓	Images with quotes
	
You can use mobile apps such as Overgram for iPhone or Phonto for iPhone 
and Android phones to add text to your photos to create popular quote 
images. You can add text on top of photographs you’ve taken and post 
directly to Instagram. Other apps let you create text-only images for Instagram 
such as Whims for iPhone and TextCutie for Android.

See “Linking LBS for integrated posts,” later in this chapter, for a breakdown 
of other networks that you can connect to your Instagram account.
Using Instagram for promotions
In addition to tying Instagram into your social networks, you can incorporate 
the app and its photo-sharing capabilities into promotions and contests.
In early 2012, retailer Tiffany & Co. began a campaign called True Love In 
Pictures. People were invited to take photos of themselves with their signifi­
cant others. If they used Instagram to submit images, they were instructed 
to use the hashtag #truelovepictures and other hashtags. The company cre­
ated a microsite called WhatMakesLoveTrue.com as a destination about 
the art of romance. The site, shown in Figure 14-3, included a gallery of photo 
submissions. The site included filters that users could add to their own 
photographs as well as a tool to add photo captions and prompts such as 
“True love lasts forever when ________ #TimelessTrueLove.” The site also 
lets users send a Love Note with their images. Couples visiting the com­
pany’s New York City, London, and Tokyo stores could take pictures in photo 
booths at each location and upload to the website.
	
Figure 14-3: 
Tiffany & 
Co. posted 
users’ 
photos on 
a website 
created for 
a specific 
promotion.
	
	
Use the Statigram contest toolkit (http://statigr.am/instagram-
contest-toolkit) to organize, implement, and track a photo contest on 
Instagram. Tie the photo contest to a place, use a hashtag to tie the images 
together, and leverage the images on other social networks. Instagram users 
will spread the word about the contest and extend your brand to their follow­
ers simply by entering.

 Chapter 14: Location-Based Services
Linking LBS for integrated posts
Depending on the LBS you’re using, you can connect it to other LBS. Most 
services let you connect to other services, and then give you the choice with 
each post if you’d like to broadcast more widely.
Using one LBS to post to several others is a common way to cross-post to get 
more use out of the content you’re producing while engaging in social mobile 
networks. By providing your followers across multiple platforms with con­
tent, you create more touch points to stay top of mind with them. Although 
you may have some overlap of audiences, chances are most people won’t be 
on all the services you’re using. Even if they are, you’re reaching them in dif­
ferent ways on different services at different times.
Table 14-1 shows some of the most popular LBS and the services they can 
connect with for broader posting. Connecting to Facebook and Twitter 
is common; however, the connection to Facebook goes to your personal 
Timeline, not your Facebook Page. Two social networks that work well with 
many LBS are Flickr, a longstanding social network for photo sharing, and 
Tumblr, a multimedia blogging platform that continues to grow in popularity.

The apps that connect to Facebook are connecting with your personal 
Facebook Timeline and not your Facebook Page. You can still repurpose the 
images you take and upload to these services onto your Facebook Page. The 
most straightforward way is to upload the images you’ve taken for these ser­
vices that are also saved on your phone. You can also take a screenshot of 
some of your check-ins and posts and upload them to your Page.

Use the tools at IFTTT (If This Then That, http://ifttt.com) to link apps 
that aren’t typically linked. Use this website to create formulas or “recipes” that 
let you choose one social network, LBS, or website, and specify an action that 
will take place. An action could be when you post a photo to Instagram using 
the tag #social, it posts to your Facebook Page. For another example, when 
you check in on Foursquare with a photo, it’s posted to your Tumblr.
We talk earlier in this chapter about using Foursquare and Instagram for pro­
motions and customer loyalty programs. You can incorporate other LBS into 
promotions in similar ways. Some services build in tools that let you create 
deals or offers and tie them into your location. You can also tie rewards 
to actions that bring people to you through an LBS, such as “follow us on 
Instagram, and we’ll pick a random winner each month to receive these cool 
products.”
As long as you have a presence and a following, or connections in an LBS, 
or an audience primed and ready to join those services and engage with you 
on them, you have the potential to draw people in to participate in activities 
such as contests. When they participate, their actions can help spread the 
word about your brand and boost your outreach in new forums.
	
You can run online/offline promotions and activities using the mobile apps 
for popular social networks and tie them into your Facebook Page Timeline or 
Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, or Pinterest (and so on) accounts. The more popu­
lar the app, the more likely people already have it on their mobile devices, and 
you’ve skipped the extra step of asking them to download a new app.
Offering deals driven by check-ins
As we mention, not all LBS have set up specific features for companies or 
brands. Although most also don’t forbid you from creating a presence for 
your brand instead of for you as an individual, the limited features and sup­
port for businesses can be challenging if you’re trying to use the service for 
promotional purposes.
LBS rely on location, and when you create a promotion, you want to tie it to 
a place that either you own or can control, even for a short period of time. If 
you do not have a business with a physical location where others can visit 
and check in, you could still create a location or promotion at a trade show, 
conference, or other event as long as you plan for something with a short 
duration.
Tying your promotions to a more public space can be an interesting way to 
engage people who are using an LBS and pass through an area that you’ve 
tagged. Tagging spaces, however, could involve getting permission from the 
owners of the space. In most cases, however, tagging places with virtual data

 Chapter 14: Location-Based Services
such as offers and challenges should not create a conflict, although this fact 
may change as more people and companies use geotagging, geofencing, and 
geo-apps.
Table 14-2 lists LBS that do offer businesses ways to leverage the check-in 
feature to provide users with a special offer or experience.

Don’t tag your competition’s space. Although there are no legal precedents at 
this time about creating virtual tags or uploading photos, comments, or tips 
about your business at the location of your competitor, at the very least you’ll 
create bad blood. There may be no rules dictating ownership of GPS coordi­
nates, but use the Golden Rule when dropping geocontent in places you don’t 
own. Don’t do anything to someone else you wouldn’t want them to do to you 
and your space.
	
Newer deal and offer platforms are surfacing to leverage consumers’ greater 
comfort with marketing and commerce on their mobile phones. Some newer 
mobile platforms that let you create special offers for others include Gyft 
(http://gyft.com), Apple’s Passbook (http://support.apple.com/
kb/HT5483), and Google Wallet (http://www.google.com/wallet/).
Adding Mobile to Your Engagement Mix
Adding mobile marketing activities to your social media engagement can 
happen using other mobile tools and platforms in addition to LBS, so we 
cover just a few to round out your social mobile engagement mix. The main 
difference between LBS and other mobile marketing tools is community. LBS 
have features that let you build communities because they’re social networks 
on mobile platforms.
Other mobile marketing tools are not about forming communities but reaching 
your communities through their smartphones and mobile devices via texting 
or SMS, the phone’s web browser, or using other apps. A common benefit of 
LBS and other mobile marketing outreach is that it adds new ways of engaging 
with customers and prospects in more personal and intimate ways.

Reaching customers through 
SMS marketing
We talk about the importance of opt-in e-mail lists for marketing and engage­
ment with customers and prospects. Another type of opt-in or permission-
based list that you can explore is a mobile marketing list. Getting permission 
to send your customers or prospects text messages or SMS (short message 
service) is a forward-thinking move toward mobile marketing.
You can compile your mobile marketing list in a variety of ways including
	
✓	A sign-up form on your website
	
✓	Posts on Facebook leading to a Facebook app with a sign-up form
	
✓	Calls to action on your social networks leading back to a web-based, 
mobile-friendly form
	
✓	Signs at your business location using QR codes to lead to a form (See the 
next section for more information about QR codes.)
	
✓	Point-of-sale forms that customers can fill out
	
✓	Verbally requesting permission to sign up your customers
Retailer REI used a service offered by Placecast called ShopAlerts (http://
placecast.net/) to create location-based messaging and time-based mes­
saging pushed to customer mobile devices. Customers had to first provide 
their mobile numbers and give permission for REI to engage with them 
through SMS. Then Placecast helped REI build virtual boundaries near its 
stores that triggered messages to customers who had opted to receive texts. 
The messages helped drive customers to REI stores when they were nearby.
Food company Udi’s Gluten Free prompts customers to give it their mobile 
phone numbers in its contact form and includes a check box for receiving 
mobile updates with special offers and seasonal promotions on its site and 
shared on other sites and blogs, as shown in Figure 14-4.
	
If you create a mobile app for your location or business, you can include 
pop-up notifications that are triggered when people are close to particular 
GPS coordinates. For these notifications to work, people must first download 
your app, then give the app permission to tap into their phone’s GPS, then 
allow notifications. Once over those humps, you can push messages to them 
based on specific locations. You can also advertise on other people’s apps 
that sell push notifications as part of their advertising services.

Using QR codes for location-based 
marketing
QR codes or quick response codes were originally created by Toyota as two-
dimensional black and white bar codes for its inventory tracking system. 
Today, these codes can come in a variety of shapes and colors as long as 
they maintain the key “hotspots” of the code. The codes can represent text 
and numbers, including website URLs.
A QR code is read by a QR code scanner app that you download to your 
smartphone. After you scan a code, it can either trigger an action or lead 
to a destination site. You scan a QR code to go on a social network, access 
additional information and resources including videos, make a purchase 
or donation, or take other online actions that can be completed easily on a 
smartphone. 
QR codes can appear on a variety of real-world items and act as a bridge 
between the offline and online spaces. Using QR codes can help you interact 
with customers and prospects even when they aren’t necessarily online but 
still have their smartphone with them or easily accessible. Some of the places 
where you can place a QR code include product packaging, signage, clothing, 
and marketing collateral.
The key to successfully integrating QR codes into your marketing mix is to 
carefully consider the destination where the code leads and making sure it’s 
mobile-friendly. Even the actions you want people to take should be easy 
to do on a smartphone or the small screen of any mobile or Wi-Fi–enabled 
device. Don’t require too much typing or too much reading. Think fast, easy, 
one-click, short, and sweet.

Laptop Lunches uses a QR code on its cardboard packaging that wraps 
around its colorful plastic bento-style lunch boxes. The code leads to a very 
mobile-friendly site with images of bento-ware lunch ideas. The images are 
large, and the content is mostly visual without requiring much text to get 
the information across (as shown in Figure 14-5). At a glance, busy parents 
can get inspiration for their children’s lunches that fit perfectly into Laptop 
Lunches’ bento-ware.

Although it may seem clever to put a QR code on a billboard, keep in mind 
that the chances of someone in a car being able to scan the code from the 
road, much less do so safely, are slim. A QR code on a poster at the airport or 
on a bus or subway makes more sense because people have time to safely pull 
out their phones and fire up their QR code scanners.
When you use QR codes at physical locations, include a call to action. “Scan 
this code and be entered to win a prize” or “Scan this code to follow us on 
Facebook” may seem obvious, but most people need you to spell out for 
them why they should fire up their QR code scanner and scan your code. 
Also determine what QR code scanner you’ll use and recommend to your 
customers and prospects.

Some QR code scanners offer QR code services such as mobile landing sites 
for QR codes and custom-designed QR codes. Scan (http://scan.me) for 
iPhone, Android, and Windows Phone offers free mobile sites. Paperlinks 
(www.paperlinks.com) for iPhone offers a paid service for mobile sites and 
can provide custom-designed QR codes in a variety of shapes and colors that 
can also include your company logo or other objects or images in the code. 
Work with a designer skilled in QR code customization to ensure the design 
doesn’t interfere with the code scanning.
	
Don’t use QR codes that are too small to function or too dark to scan. Your QR 
code should be no smaller than 1-x-1 inch square and preferably larger. Make 
sure the background of your code is much lighter than the code itself for opti­
mal scanning.
Geolocating and geotagging
We’d be remiss if we didn’t mention how Facebook uses geolocation for its 
Facebook Places feature. Although this isn’t a main aspect of its overall ser­
vice, and Facebook is also a web-based network, its initial Places service was 
competitive to Foursquare in particular when it first rolled out, even though 
now it’s integrated with Pages. Plus, Facebook offers businesses options for 
reaching its customers through this feature, unlike many of the newer LBS.
Facebook Places lets users add a location to their posts so if they are at your 
place of business, they can tag their posts with the location. In the past, com­
panies could set up a Place on Facebook. Now the Place feature is combined 
with a company Facebook Page if you’ve designated your Page as a business 
establishment with a location. For people to be able to check in to your place 
of business, select Local Business or Place when setting it up and add your 
business address.
Even if you don’t have a Facebook Page, people can still check in to your 
location by adding a new location as they try to check in. Clearly, having your 
own Facebook Page facilitates this process and adds the number of people 
who have checked in to your location. Figure 14-6 shows this number next to 
number of Likes and people “talking about this.”
People can check in to Facebook Pages with locations when they’re nearby. 
Even if you’ve never made a Facebook Page for your business, people may 
still be able to check in there by creating a new location when they check in.
	
In addition to Facebook, you can use the mobile apps of other popular social 
networks to add location or geotagging to your posts and images including 
Twitter (Chapter 10), Google+ (Chapter 13), and Flickr (www.flickr.com).

Creating hybrid online/offline engagement
A natural fit for creating engagement that crosses from offline to online 
and back are applications like SCVNGR (mentioned previously) that tie to 
GPS coordinates linking to online content. The online content then leads to 
instructions for offline activities such as scavenger hunts, quests, and other 
challenges.
The key to successful hybrid online/offline mobile-powered campaigns that 
tie into your overall social media engagement is careful planning, including
	
✓	Your main goals and the goals of your campaign
	
✓	The audience you’re trying to reach
Engaging with geocaching
Another activity that combines GPS coordi­
nates and offline and outdoor activities is called 
geocaching. The concept of geocaching — 
also called “waymarking” — is that participants 
around the world hide and seek out contain­
ers called caches. Each cache is usually in a 
sturdy, waterproof container and at a minimum 
has a log book so each person who finds it can 
sign the log book before hiding it again. 
Often, people add other items to a cache: small, 
portable trinkets or items that can fit easily in 
the container. If someone removes something 
from the cache, it’s common that she replace it 
with something else for the next person.
Businesses can participate in this popular activ­
ity and engage avid outdoor enthusiasts and 
active individuals by creating and hiding your 
own caches, which could include branded or 
promotional items. Use a GPS coordinates tool 
such as GPS Compass, Free GPS for iPhone, or 
CacheSense and c:geo for Android to record 
the coordinates and provide them to others in a 
variety of places including social networks, on 
your website or blog, in forums for geocaching 
enthusiasts, and on offline signage.

Audio and Videocasting
In This Chapter
▶	Building your audience with audio
▶	Appealing to your community with multimedia
▶	Mastering the use of streaming video
Speech is power; speech is to persuade, to convert, to compel. It is to bring 
another out of his bad sense into your good sense. 
—Ralph Waldo Emerson
R

alph Waldo Emerson wasn’t talking about social media engagement or 
your desire to introduce your brand to a new audience when he first 
uttered these words in the mid-1800s, but there’s more than a kernel of truth 
in his words. Speech is powerful, whether you communicate in person or 
embrace multimedia and social media to share your message.
In this chapter, we discuss the deeper character and personality you give 
your brand by putting a voice, a face, or both to your business. Though it 
may seem that audio and video broadcasting don’t fall into the category of 
conversation, they do. Yes, you want your audience to listen, but when done 
right, audio and video online is much more than one-way communication. 
Let us explain how and why, and the best ways for you to use these tools to 
maximize your impact.
Enhancing Your Marketing with Audio
Quite simply, messages can be conveyed with multimedia in a completely dif­
ferent way than with the written, tweeted, or “Facebooked” word. By produc­
ing audio and video, you produce shareable content. Use audio, video, and 
combined forms of multimedia to grow your audience and to communicate in 
a memorable fashion.

Part V: Leveraging Audio and Video for Engagement 
Audio — and video, as we explain later in this chapter — is uniquely posi­
tioned to make content relevant to what matters most to your audience: 
them. You open up a dialogue, share valuable information, and encourage 
your community to react or act, just like you would be doing if you were 
using text.
With audio and video, however, you can do something the written word 
alone often can’t do: form a more personal connection. (In the case of video, 
you form a more face-to-face connection than words could ever do.)
You have a variety of options to reach your target audience. The most 
common are audiocasting, usually called podcasting; teleseminars; and 
webinars. Here are some of the marketing benefits of audio:
	
✓	Appealing: Online digital audio is reminiscent of radio, a familiar 
communications, informational, and entertaining medium. People are 
comfortable listening to audio.
	
✓	Popular: According to PodcastAlley.com, a podcast directory, more 
than 91,000 podcasts existed as of December 2012, and more than a 
quarter of the U.S. population has listened to at least one show.
	
✓	Low bandwidth: Although audio files require more bandwidth than 
text and images, they’re less intensive than video, making them easy to 
upload, host, access, and consume. Segments can be five to ten minutes 
or up to an hour, and usually require far less editing than video.
	
✓	Low cost: Audio can be very low-cost to produce. Because most 
podcasts and audio files are offered for free, they are attractive to your 
audience as valuable content they can listen to and share.
	
✓	Low production: Like online video, audio doesn’t require high-end pro­
duction value to be appealing. You don’t need to produce radio-quality 
audio to have a successful online podcast.
	
✓	Embeddable: You can embed audio files into your website or blog, or you 
can add them to — or link to them from — the social networks you use.
	
✓	SEO-friendly: The more places your audio is listed, archived, and 
tagged, the more opportunities people have to find you in search 
engines. A description of the audio you upload along with your name, 
topic, and business name is easily searchable and can help build your 
audience.
	
✓	Portable: After your audience downloads the audio, they can listen any­
where, anytime — in their cars, while they prepare dinner, as they finish 
that last bit of work, or spend time on the treadmill.
Audio lets you share your personality with others. People can hear the tone 
of your voice and other vocal inflections, creating a deeper connection with 
your audience in a different way than text. See Chapter 6 for more about con­
necting with your audience.

 Chapter 15: Audio and Videocasting
Using podcasts to build an audience
The term audiocast — or podcast as we call it from here on out — refers to digi­
tal audio content that you can listen to online through your web browser on 
your computer or download to a mobile device like an MP3 player or a smart­
phone. The ability to download a podcast makes listening on the go simple.
As we mention in Chapter 3, podcasts can be delivered in a variety of ways: 
live streaming that’s often recorded; recorded in advance and then broadcast 
later; embedded on a site or social network for instant or on-demand replay; 
or archived on a network like iTunes for individual download or subscription.
Deciding what — and how — to podcast
Podcasts can take the form of a radio broadcast, a seminar, a performance, 
an audiobook, you name it. Anything that can be published as text can also 
be produced as audio. And of course, any audio that can be recorded can be 
made into a podcast. We talk more about video podcasts later but for now, 
know that podcasts can be produced in audio, video, or both.
	
Before you decide what your podcast is about, download other podcasts first. 
Look at the list of popular podcasts, but also search for podcasts created by 
companies in addition to individuals to see how you might format a podcast for 
your business. Some of the most popular podcasts including TED Talks, NBC 
Nightly News, and The Today Show are all available via audio and video pod­
casts and can be listened to or viewed on your iPod, iPad, iPhone, or Apple TV.
	
People are often delighted to do audio interviews because they require very 
little physical preparation, don’t require travel, and can be done from any­
where by phone. Giving someone else the opportunity to share her knowledge 
on your podcast is a win-win for both of you.
	
If you’re looking for a little something extra, you can produce enhanced pod­
casts, especially audiobooks, that include photos, hyperlinks, and even chap­
ter marks. If someone downloads your enhanced podcast from iTunes, he sees 
everything he needs to navigate the chapters, hyperlinks, and artwork in a 
menu bar.
Getting a podcast off the ground
Getting started with a podcast is relatively easy. The low barrier to entry is 
one of the many reasons podcasts are quite popular. If you’re anxious to get 
started, you can begin with software like Apple’s GarageBand, a microphone 
for less than $100, and free online podcast-publishing software such 
as SoundCloud (http://soundcloud.com), Podcast Generator (www.
podcastgen.sourceforge.net), and PodOmatic (www.podomatic.com). 
These services provide all of the initial resources you need, including the RSS 
feed for submitting your podcast to iTunes (see the next section) that will be 
necessary once you feel you are ready for this step.

Part V: Leveraging Audio and Video for Engagement 
Distributing your podcast
When you’re ready to share your podcast, and you have used a podcasting 
service or tool to generate the feed, head to iTunes to submit it. Submitting 
your podcast to the iTunes Store starts with a valid iTunes account; then 
you must have your podcast RSS feed to start the submission process. Here 
are the steps to adding your podcast to iTunes for easy downloading and 
subscribing:
	
1.	Launch iTunes.
	
	If you don’t yet have iTunes, you can download a free version and sign 
up for a free account at http://apple.com/itunes.
	
2.	At the very top of the iTunes page, click Podcast on the navigation bar 
to go to the podcast section.
	
	 You must be logged in to your iTunes account.
	
3.	Click the Submit a Podcast link in the right-hand sidebar.
	
	 The podcast submission page appears.
	
4.	Enter the RSS feed URL for the podcast you’ve created and click 
Continue.
	
	 You can find the feed through the podcasting service you used. See 
Figure 15-1 for the submission screen.
	
	 The RSS feed you want to use when submitting your podcast to iTunes is 
an XML file. Although you can generate this file from scratch, it’s a long 
and tedious process. You’re better off using a podcast-publishing tool 
that generates this file.
	
5.	Fill in the submission form.
	
	 You are taken to a review page where iTunes prompts you to upload 
artwork and enter your name, the name of your podcast, a short 
description, a long description, and an iTunes category. Note that some 
podcasting services may prompt you in advance to add all of these 
things, or your RSS feed may already contain some or most of what 
iTunes needs. iTunes prompts you for missing information.
	
6.	Submit and wait.
	
	 Expect about one to two days of processing time for iTunes to approve 
your podcast.
	
7.	Market when ready!
	
	 After your podcast is live on iTunes, you can begin marketing it by shar­
ing a link to it on your website, blog, and social networks.
You can also publish your audio podcast to a WordPress blog. WordPress 
automatically generates an easy-to-find RSS feed that you can then use in 
iTunes. Just add /feed to the end of your blog URL. You can also create a feed 
by using a tool like Google FeedBurner (http://feedburner.com).

Growing your podcast audience
Here are some tips for growing your podcast audience: 
	
✓	Content is king. Creating shows that bring listeners back again and 
again is key. Think how-to’s, tips, and tricks. Content that can still be rel­
evant a year from now is your goal. You want your audience to be able 
to listen today, next week, or four months from now and still be moved.
	
✓	iTunes reviews are gold. Ask for feedback. And then ask again. The 
power of positive feedback cannot be underestimated. The reviews seen 
on iTunes will be some of the first impressions potential new listeners 
get of your podcast. You want good feedback and as much as possible. 
	
✓	Commitment matters. To hook your audience, you need to appear regu­
larly. Whether it is every Tuesday or Mondays and Fridays. But once you 
tell your audience what to expect from you, you must deliver.
	
✓	Spread the word. Yes, tell your fans on Facebook about your podcast. 
Yes, tell your audience on Twitter. Yes, shout it from the rooftops on 
Google+. But don’t forget the power of your e-mail list, as well. A regular 
announcement with a link can be extremely valuable.
	
✓	Popularity counts. That means you want popular guests: Tim Ferris, 
Seth Godin, and Scott Stratten are a good way to catch your audience’s 
attention, but don’t rely on the ‘big names’ alone to do the marketing for 
you. You must still publicize your podcast as you would any other show.

✓	Saying thank you is powerful. A small gesture can go a long way. Thank 
your community regularly for being a part of the work you do. Srinivas 
Rao from Blogcast FM believes in the personal touch of taking the time 
each day to acknowledge new subscribers. Remember that using audio is 
just one way to connect with your audience online; it isn’t the only way.
Publishing audio from a mobile device
Maybe creating a full podcast sounds too complicated for you. Maybe you 
want to give audio a shot, but don’t want to invest in any technical equip­
ment just yet. You can open dialogue between you and your community 
using audio easily and with minimal expense.
Reach into your pocket or purse and grab that smartphone or mobile device 
of yours. This little tool you’re holding, the one that makes social media 
engagement so accessible and portable, can be your perfect audio tool.
If you’re using an iPhone, tap the Voice Memo icon (looks like a microphone) 
that’s located in the Utilities folder. You can also download any number of 
apps that can get you started, like Audioboo (http://audioboo.fm) or 
Chirbit (http://chirbit.com, Figure 15-2). Both are available on iPhone and 
Android. Start with short bursts of audio that provide useful information to 
your audience. You can quickly record, save, and share them on the go. Later 
you can embed or add those segments to some of your social media platforms.

Adding audio to your social network
Although it’s indeed delightful — and in many ways sounds incredibly 
fancy — that your podcasts or other audio can live on iTunes for all the 
world to see, you don’t want to forget the many other opportunities to 
engage with your audience on your social networks.
To leverage the audio you’re producing, you can
	
✓	Share it. From your page on iTunes, you have the option to share to 
Facebook and Twitter, e-mail the show’s link to a friend, or simply copy 
the link so you can paste it elsewhere online. See Figure 15-3.
	
✓	Embed it. After you publish your podcast, you can use the embed code 
by placing it on your blog, Facebook, LinkedIn, or Google+. If you’re 
feeling sassy, you can even create a board on Pinterest focused entirely 
on your new series. You get the embed code on whichever site you used 
to host your actual audio content.
Business podcast hits 1 million mark using SME
Srinivas Rao launched Blogcast FM in 2010 after 
what he calls a “fortunate accident.” He began by 
creating audio interviews to satisfy his insatiable 
curiosity about people and their business suc­
cess, to provide insightful information for his audi­
ence, and as a way to drive traffic to his blog, The 
Skool of Life (www.theskooloflife.com). 
After about three months, a friend recommended 
that Rao spin the series into a regular podcast. 
As of the beginning of 2013, the podcast gets 
1 million downloads a month. You read that right — 
1 million.
Rao says his audience consistently uses three 
words to describe his show — actionable, 
insightful, and useful. The best thing about those 
three words from a marketer’s perspective is 
that they prove that his audience finds value in 
what they’re hearing. This level of engagement 
highlights the success of podcasts: Audiences 
don’t hesitate to come back or to share what 
they enjoy or find useful to their daily lives and 
business success.

Offering Teleseminars and Webinars
Webinars and teleseminars are other ways to engage your audience and offer 
meaningful, quality content. The difference between the two audio delivery 
forms is distinct. A teleseminar is an audio-only session or conference via 
phone or computer. A webinar incorporates visuals such as PowerPoint 
slides that require you to be in front of your computer to participate.
Seeing the benefits of webinars 
and teleseminars
Both of these options offer benefits to your business or brand:
	
✓	Trust: Build trust by offering your audience information and inspiration 
they need. If your audience trusts you, they’ll continue to rely on you for 
information and products.
	
✓	Expertise: Webinars and teleseminars highlight your expertise. Show off 
what you know. Answer the questions your community wants answered.
	
✓	Connection: Hearing your voice on a teleseminar — or even seeing your 
face if video is part of a webinar — allows your community to develop a 
connection with you. Whether you like it or not, it isn’t always the best 
product that wins. People are more likely to purchase from brands that 
get the connection factor. See Chapter 6 for more on connecting with 
your community.
	
✓	Growth: A growing customer base signals success. If attendees enjoy 
your webinar, share their experience, return and bring others with them, 
your community continues to grow.

 Chapter 15: Audio and Videocasting
	
✓	Revenue: It would be silly if we didn’t mention making money here, 
right? You can charge for teleseminars and webinars for what you show 
and tell. Building that trust and connection can pay off.
Although your decision to choose one over the other may come down to 
your preference, comfort level, and an assessment of the content you share, 
the distinct differences between the two may sway your opinion.
Choosing between webinars 
and teleseminars
Here are some distinct differences between webinars and teleseminars to 
help you decide which format is better suited for you.
	
Whichever you choose to produce, allow time at the end of the session for 
attendees to ask questions. Though it may be a slightly more complicated pro­
cess on a teleseminar, Q&A allows you to engage with your attendees. Note 
that some teleseminar systems allow attendees to “raise their hands” via a 
button on their phones to make Q&A more organized.
Advantage: Webinar
A webinar is the better choice when you need the following features:
	
✓	Show and tell: The visual aspect of the webinar — including slides, 
videos, images, charts, and even streaming video so you appear in the 
presentation — creates a personal connection between you and your 
audience. It’s a real seminar on the web.
	
✓	Real-time interaction: Attendees ask questions either verbally or via real-
time text chat. You, as the leader of the webinar, can poll your audience 
and ask them questions. Keep in mind though, unless your teleseminar 
has a web-based dashboard, it can be chaotic when attendees try to 
interact verbally.
	
✓	Networking: Without dashboards or web-based communications tools 
that let you and your attendees interact, teleseminars are more isolat­
ing experiences. Some webinar software even allows attendees to create 
their own profiles to facilitate personal branding and connecting.
	
✓	Technology showcase: Let’s face it — a webinar is simply a fancier tech­
nology. As a business or brand that can master this type of format, you 
show your clients you’re savvy.
	
✓	Feature set for attendees: In addition to slides, webinars can contain 
video clips or live streaming video, polling, and real-time text chat.

Part V: Leveraging Audio and Video for Engagement 
Advantage: Teleseminar
By contrast, a teleseminar can be a better choice in the following ways:
	
✓	Ease of use for attendees: To participate in a teleseminar, all someone 
has to do is pick up a phone and dial. The more technically capable 
could call in via their computers, but hands-down, teleseminars are 
much easier for attendees than webinars, which can require download­
ing and installing software to participate.
	
✓	Preparation time: Compared with the visuals needed to produce a qual­
ity webinar, including slides and possibly video, a teleseminar is purely 
audio based, so you spend less time preparing.
	
✓	Ease of access: To participate in a teleseminar, you need only a phone 
line, compared with a computer and internet connection for a webinar.
Equal advantage
Webinars and teleseminars are equal in the following ways:
	
✓	Cost: Both are low-cost to produce. Although, there’s a slight tip to tele­
seminars, which can include the cost of the phone call or the conferenc­
ing call system (depending on what system you use), but services for a 
high-tech webinar tend to be higher.
	
✓	Recording and replay: The good news is both teleseminars and webi­
nars can be recorded, archived, and replayed later.
Selecting the right tool
To get started with teleseminars or webinars, there are a variety of online 
options ranging from completely free to a regular monthly fee:
	
✓	FreeConference (www.freeconference.com).
	
✓	FreeConferenceCallHD (ww.freeconferencecallhd.com)
	
✓	InterCall (www.intercall.com)
	
✓	MeetingOnNow (www.meetingonnow.com)
	
✓	InstantConference (www.instantconference.com)
	
✓	Cisco WebEx (www.webex.com)
	
✓	GoToWebinar (http://gotowebinar.com)
	
Beware of extra or hidden costs. Read the fine print from each service to make 
sure that the pricing is straightforward and obvious. Also keep in mind that if 
you use your telephone instead of your computer to place calls, you may incur 
long distance fees or eat up your mobile phone minutes.

 Chapter 15: Audio and Videocasting
Getting More out of Multimedia
What? You want to know more about video, too? You are clearly a business 
owner after Danielle’s heart. It’s her favorite medium in the world of social 
media engagement. In talking about multimedia, we touch on video, but delve 
into it even more deeply in Chapter 16 when we go over YouTube.
A 2011 study by Frank N. Magid Associates (http://magid.com/sites/
default/files/pdf/metacafe.pdf) indicates eight of ten people on the 
web watch online video every week. Additionally, 46 percent are watching 
user-generated content instead of news, music videos, or television clips. This 
means they watch what you create, or they would be if you were creating it.
So get moving!
Conferencing with video
The number of platforms available for you to reach out and talk to your com­
munity, to interview experts, and to connect with those around you aston­
ishes even the most experienced in the social media space. It seems that 
there is a new way to engage almost weekly.
Videoconferencing is often on a considerably smaller scale than the telesemi­
nars and webinars we discuss earlier in this chapter. A more intimate use of 
video creates an opportunity to garner more face-to-face time with specific 
people. In the following sections, we cover a few of the most popular video­
conferencing products.
Skype
Skype (www.skype.com) first appeared in 2003, but video calls weren’t offi­
cially introduced until late 2005 and early 2006. Skype was originally created 
to allow free audio and video calls through the Internet using Voice Over 
Internet Protocol, or VoIP. Today, Skype is one of the most popular videocon­
ferencing tools, creating connections among family, friends, teachers, and 
students. Even companies use it for everything from meetings to interviewing 
job candidates to making presentations, without the associated travel costs.
In just the last two years, Skype’s usage has nearly doubled to more than 
700 million minutes every day — nearly half of those on video calls. It’s no 
wonder Skype interviews are now a regular sighting on news and entertain­
ment programs as a way for people in far-flung places to join the conversa­
tion. See Figure 15-4.

Skype has a screen-sharing feature so you can show someone else what’s on 
your computer screen. Use the screen-sharing feature to enhance your two-
way videoconference call and show something more clearly with visuals.
Skype videoconferencing is limited to two people in the free version or up to 
ten people in the paid version, and requires you to download the software. 
You can also access Skype via your mobile device to use videoconferencing 
as long as you have a video camera built into your device.
	
If you use a Mac, Call Recorder for Skype (www.ecamm.com/mac/call
recorder) lets you record videos on Skype to archive and let your audience 
replay later on your site, blog, or on your social platforms. This is a paid 
option. A popular PC solution for recording Skype calls is Pamela for Skype 
(http://Pamela.biz).
Google Hangouts
Skype isn’t the only solution in town. Google Hangouts, part of Google+, are 
another videoconferencing solution. You can chat face-to-face and hold a 
virtual meeting on Hangout for up to ten people entirely for free. You don’t 
have to download any software with Google Hangouts. Although you cannot 
access Google Hangouts via your mobile device, you can broadcast the entire 
thing to the world via YouTube using Hangouts On Air. See Chapter 13 on 
Google+ (www.google.com/+) for more details on Hangouts.
iMeet
Another virtual conferencing solution is iMeet (http://imeet.com), which 
offers phone conferencing; videoconferencing for up to 15 people at once; 
no software downloads; the ability to share a screen or upload, share, and 
collaborate on a document; and easy access from a smartphone. iMeet

subscriptions start at $19 per month, so you can see that different videocon­
ferencing solutions have a range of costs and features.
Engaging with live streaming video
Going live with video is a way of inviting the world around you — or your 
community specifically — to sit down and connect with you in real time. 
Some benefits include the chat commentary, the connection with the audi­
ence, and the ability to actually hear from your community.
For businesses, the benefits of live streaming video include
	
✓	Transparency: You can’t hide when you’re on live video. If an audience 
member jumps into the conversation to ask you a question — either 
via chat or when permitted on camera — you build trust by responding 
directly.
	
✓	Pure engagement: Live video gives you the opportunity to share infor­
mation in real time, ask questions, and to hear what your audience has 
to say. See Figure 15-5 for an example of engaging with live video.
	
✓	Expanding your stage: By opening yourself up to a live event, you are 
live everywhere. The world is your stage. This kind of exposure can 
grow your audience.

November 
2012, ABC 
News, 
Yahoo!, 
and Google

tion with 
moms 
about the 
Presidential 
Debates.
	
	
✓	Archiving Content: Most platforms allow you to record your live event 
for later use with the ability to embed the saved video on your site, blog, 
or social networks. Live video content doesn’t have to disappear, but 
can be repurposed and used to attract attention and generate revenue.

Part V: Leveraging Audio and Video for Engagement 
Tools for live streaming video include Google Hangouts (discussed earlier in 
this chapter), Spreecast (www.spreecast.com), Ustream (www.ustream.
com), Livestream (www.livestream.com), Veetle (http://veetle.com), 
and Qik (http://qik.com).
	
The moment you go live on a Google Hangout, your video is recorded and 
automatically saved to your YouTube account. Make sure you check the 
recording settings on whichever live video-streaming tool you use so you 
don’t lose the video you produce.
Showing on the go: Mobile video
Smartphones are now equipped with video, and many tablet computers also 
come with a camera and video capabilities. You can capture video on the fly 
wherever you are and upload quickly and easily to video-hosting sites includ­
ing YouTube (Chapter 16) and Flickr (http://flickr.com).
Mobile apps also make it easy to record and upload quick videos to online 
communities like video-based social networks:
	
✓	Magisto (www.magisto.com): A video community with the magical 
ability to transform videos you take into a completed project in min­
utes. This app was launched in early 2012, and in a year’s time had 
more than 15 million videos from 3 million users. You can share videos 
via Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or e-mail. This app is for iPhone and 
Android devices, and online.
	
✓	Viddy (http://viddy.com): If you like the Instagram photo commu­
nity, you’ll probably like Viddy. This app is a video community and con­
nects with your personal Facebook Timeline. It’s for iPhone only.
	
✓	Socialcam (www.socialcam.com): Another mobile video community 
site. Easily share video on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, e-mail, and by 
SMS. It’s available for iPhone and Android.
	
✓	Tout (http://tout.com): This video app is more like Twitter, allowing 
only 15-second video uploads. You can share on Facebook, Twitter, or 
embed the video widget on your site. It’s for iPhone and Android.
	
✓	Klip (http://klip.com): If Viddy is like Instagram and Tout is like 
Twitter, then Klip is like Pinterest. You can upload videos to Klip includ­
ing using URLs to your videos already on YouTube. You can also record 
from your smartphone or webcam. This app is for iPhone and Android.
	
✓	Vine (https://vine.co/): This app allows you to make 6 second 
video clips and post them to your social networks. The videos are cre­
ated only when the user is tapping the screen — giving the completed 
project a stop-motion effect. This app is currently available only for 
iPhones.

YouTube
In This Chapter
▶	Producing memorable, shareable content
▶	Increasing your number of subscribers
▶	Mastering the technical side of YouTube
▶	Building a community video experience
O

nline video: It isn’t simply the quickest way to learn “Gangnam Style” 
(to date, the most-watched YouTube video of all time, with 1.2 bil­
lion views and counting), to keep up on the latest Les Misérables Flash Mob 
Wedding video, or to view quirky cat videos. Video is an opportunity to con­
nect with your audience on a personal level — to make them laugh, to teach 
them something new, and to engage in some very basic, but honest, show 
and tell. In front of the camera, it’s just you and your viewing community.
We aren’t talking about creating a one-time hit video that drives clicks; 
instead, we’re talking about motivating a community to keep you in their 
video sights permanently. Reports say that two thirds of the world’s mobile 
data traffic will be video by the year 2016. Will you be along for the ride?
Using Video to Build Community
In 2011, the sixth year of YouTube’s existence, 48 hours of video were 
uploaded every minute. By 2012, 72 hours of video made their way onto 
YouTube every 60 seconds. So what’s happened in these past few years? 
You started watching. And your friends did. You shared what you loved. The 
brands you trust hopped in and started to broadcast. Then you began to 
share their content as well. YouTube is now a community-oriented platform 
and social network similar to some of the others we discuss in this book.
By now, you know a community cannot exist as a one-sided conversation. If 
your audience shows up and you’re nowhere to be found, they leave. If they 
appear and your content is inconsistent or irrelevant — same result — you’re 
on your own.

Part V: Leveraging Audio and Video for Engagement 
Although some of the same community-building basics apply — establishing 
a presence, building trust, listening carefully, and reacting accordingly (see 
Part II for a refresher) — YouTube has its own unique way of doing things. 
That’s what we discuss in this chapter. You want a community that isn’t 
expecting you to produce a video that entertains them for a few seconds, but 
is expecting content that continues to engage them so they never miss what 
you have to say.
Capturing your audience’s attention
We have a friend who runs a series of successful one-day conferences for 
beginning bloggers. Bloggy Boot Camp is the brainchild of Tiffany Romero 
and Francesca Banducci. Tiffany commands the room the moment she wants 
her audience’s attention by saying, “If you can hear me, clap once!” She 
pauses to wait for the response that always follows: a clap and then silence. 
She repeats, “If you can hear me, clap twice!” Two claps and another round of 
silence follow. Tiffany is to a live audience what you want to be to your online 
video viewers. The beginning of your video is your “clap.” From that moment, 
you have their full attention. Your goal is to keep it.
YouTube works best not for that single amazing viral video, but for the chan­
nels producing an amazing viewing experience for their communities on a 
regular basis. You want people to watch and to continue watching. Stopping 
by your channel is great, but staying for the stories you tell in each of your 
videos is the longer-term goal.
Think of YouTube as an opportunity to show and tell in a way you can’t 
with any other platform. According to Nielsen Wire, more than 147 mil­
lion Americans watch video on the Internet. Those are eyeballs you want. 
Consider these best practices to capture your YouTube audience’s attention:
	
✓	Create regular content. You must update your YouTube Channel 
regularly. It’s up to you whether you post a new video every Monday, 
Wednesday, and Friday, or only once a week. However, your audience 
must know what to expect from you, and you must stick by whatever 
commitment you decide to make. A YouTube Channel last updated six 
months ago might as well not exist.
	
	Post or share in plain sight when you plan to update your YouTube 
page — either in your banner or in your channel trailer — so your 
audience knows what to expect from you and when.
	
✓	Remember that first impressions rule. The first ten seconds of your 
video are crucial, as well as your screenshot (the picture visible when 
your video isn’t playing). Compel your audience to click Play and then to 
stay with you. Be funny and engaging, and give your audience a feel for 
what to expect. The first impression is more important than how long 
your video is.

 Chapter 16: YouTube
	
✓	Know that production value matters. If your audience cannot see you 
or hear you, they will click away instantly. It doesn’t matter how com­
pelling your content may be; you must ensure a certain level of quality. 
Lighting, sound, the framing of your shots, a still camera, and even some 
editing keeps people engaged.
	
	Use YouTube’s video editing tools to edit, make minor adjustments, or 
add some special effects to your video. You can trim videos to a specific 
length, combine multiple videos, add music from a library of approved 
songs, or even include custom special effects (www.youtube.com/
editor).
	
✓	Use annotations. Annotations are text content that you can lay over your 
video, including a link to any page within YouTube and a call to action. 
Annotations can prompt your viewers to subscribe to your YouTube 
Channel, such as your video, or link to another one of your channels. 
Keep annotations small and unobtrusive to offer a small nudge in the 
right direction. Figure 16-1 shows how to encourage a Thumbs Up by 
using an annotation. A Thumbs Up is a simple way for a viewer to say 
‘I like this video.’ 
	
	We cover annotations in more detail in “Using annotations and 
thumbnails,” later in this chapter.

Part V: Leveraging Audio and Video for Engagement 
	
✓	Make content meaningful. Your videos should answer a question, solve 
a problem, or make people laugh. You want your audience to look out 
for your videos and want to see more. Create content that is helpful, 
interesting, or intriguing in some way.
	
✓	Create playlists. To make it easy for your community to navigate your 
channel, group similar content in a YouTube video playlist. For more 
details, see “Creating a playlist,” later in this chapter.
	
✓	Buy an ad. You have several ways to buy advertising on YouTube, 
including Promoted Videos that show up on the right side of a similar 
video, and inline ads where your short video “commercial” appears 
before someone else’s similar video.
Optimizing your YouTube Channel
You want your audience to dig deep when it comes to spending time on your 
YouTube Channel. To entice them, you need to be branded, you need to be 
consistent, and you need to take advantage of all of the technical tools the 
platform puts at your disposal. You don’t need us to tell you that your main 
page on your YouTube Channel is one of the first impressions you make on 
your audience.
Here are some ways to use YouTube’s tools to optimize, or make the most of 
your channel and increase engagement:
	
✓	Brand your channel. You want people who visit your channel to know, 
without a doubt, they are visiting you or your business. When they click 
on your main page, everything they see, hear, and feel, reminds them of 
you, from the colors, to the verbiage to the pictures you choose to rep­
resent you.
	
	In early 2013, YouTube changed the look and feel of the main page, 
streamlining the change across all channels to ensure all pages would be 
equally visible and branded on all devices.
	
	The new One Channel option, shown in Figure 16-2, allows you to create 
a branded banner across the top of the page as well as a personalized 
trailer to welcome people who have yet to subscribe. Use these options 
to sell yourself. This is more than a typical bio; this is your chance to tell 
people why they should watch you as well as what to expect from your 
videos. You also have room to include links to all of your other social 
media engagement platforms. 
	
✓	Set expectations. In addition to telling your audience when you will 
update, tell them what to expect from your content. If you plan to do 
classes on selecting seasonal produce, for example, list this information 
in the short bio form on your YouTube trailer. The first 45 characters 
of your description are visible whenever a new viewer discovers your 
channel, even on a mobile device, so make them compelling.

banner is

showing her 
name, her 
face, and 
how fre-
quently she 
updates her 
channel.
	
	
✓	Prioritize playlists. Keeping your audience around as long as possible 
is a priority, so make your content as user-friendly as possible. Playlists 
let you group your videos together into categories such as recipes and 
business tips. We discuss playlists in “Creating a playlist,” later in this 
chapter.
	
✓	Feature other channels. We could simply say use good karma to boost 
engagement, because featuring other YouTube Channels on your page 
lets your audience know who in the online video space is in your com­
munity, who you recommend, and who recommends you. In the new 
One Channel layout (see Figure 16-2), the Featured channels you select 
show up on the right side of your YouTube channel’s page.
	
	Anytime people subscribe to your channel, some of your featured chan­
nels are also recommended to them. The same is true in the reverse: 
Anyone who features you is recommending you to new subscribers.
	
✓	Call your viewers to action. Tell your viewers what you need from them 
by including a call to action. This is as simple as asking your viewers to 
like or share your video or to subscribe to your channel by mentioning 
it in your video or using annotations (see “Using annotations and thumb­
nails,” later in this chapter). When viewers take any of these actions, 
these actions are broadcast to their viewers in your Channel Feed (see 
the next point), which is much like your Timeline format on Facebook. 
This, in turn, helps your audience to grow as you are then visible to a 
whole new set of eyeballs.
	
✓	Keep an active Channel Feed. Your Channel Feed is the pulse of your 
activity on YouTube. When you post, comment, or like a video, or sub­
scribe to a channel, those actions show up in your activity feed. If you’re 
extremely active on YouTube, consider adjusting your settings so you 
don’t overwhelm your subscribers.

Creating a playlist
Playlists (see Figure 16-3) make it easier for your viewers to find the related 
content from you. Because videos play right after the other, your audience 
sees more of your videos in one sitting.
	
Figure 16-3: 
Kellogg’s 
YouTube 
page has 
playlists 
highlighting 
Olympic 
athletes.
	
Creating playlists also makes your content more searchable because your 
videos can be discovered not only individually, but also as a collection. If you 
create a playlist called Salad Recipes, for example, the videos are optimized 
in search engines not only for each specific recipe video, but also as the 
entire playlist.
To create a playlist to increase views and engagement, follow these steps:
	
1.	Log in to your YouTube account.
	
2.	Click Video Manager in the top-right corner.
	
	 All videos you have uploaded appear.
	
3.	Click Playlists on the left side of your screen under Video Manager.
	
	 Any previous playlists you have created appear.
	
4.	Click the New Playlist button on the right side of the screen.
	
5.	In the Playlist Title and Description dialog box that appears, title your 
playlist and describe its content; then click Create Playlist.
	
6.	In the Editing Playlist box that appears, click Add Video by URL.
	
	A box to add the URL will appear mid-page.

 Chapter 16: YouTube
	
7.	Copy the URL of the first video you want to include in your playlist.
	
8.	Paste the URL of the video into the Video URL box and click Add.
	
	 You’ll see a green bar that says ‘Video successfully added!’.
	
9.	On the right side of the page, click Public and Allow Others to Embed 
this Playlist.
	
10.	Click Save.
	
	 All the videos you selected are grouped in a playlist and will play auto­
matically one right after the other when a viewer clicks on any within 
the grouped list.
Maximizing your subscriber base
There’s tremendous value in building your subscriber base and in increasing 
your community. The more subscribers you have, the more people who see 
each video as you post it and have the opportunity to share your video con­
tent. Sitting idly by and hoping people will stumble upon your channel is not 
the answer.
Fortunately, we do know a few tricks to help you increase your exposure and 
get more people to click Subscribe.
	
Don’t offer incentives to people to like your videos or subscribe to your chan­
nel. If you do, you’ll be in violation of YouTube’s terms of service and commu­
nity guidelines. You are certainly safe to ask or encourage people to like your 
videos or subscribe, but you can’t offer prizes or hold giveaways of any kind.
The three keys to building your subscriber numbers are consistency, strong 
content, and communication. Set a schedule and force yourself to stick to it. 
Your subscribers need to know what to expect from you. Posting weekly is 
optimal, but it’s more important that your audience have faith in your consis­
tency. Pepsi, for example, posts two to three times a week, depending on the 
time of year. This consistency, combined with quality content, made Pepsi 
one of the biggest brand channels of 2012, according to Digiday, a media 
company and digital media community.
Interacting with the YouTube community
You wouldn’t be reading this book if you didn’t place high importance 
on engaging with your community. Mastering that interaction with your 
YouTube audience requires a different set of tactics and practices from the 
other social networking platforms we discuss in this book:
www.Ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.Ebook777.com
324
Part V: Leveraging Audio and Video for Engagement 
	
✓	When people comment on your videos, reply. The three main reasons 
to reciprocate are
 
• You build relationships with members of your community.
 
• You show you value the feedback. If someone doesn’t like your 
video, he’ll often let you know. Anonymous feedback is not uncom­
mon. Consider the tougher criticism an opportunity to look for 
ways to improve what you do. However, do try to let excessive 
negativity roll off your back. You can’t take it too personally.
 
• The more frequently you comment, the more visible you are to 
your subscribers. Each time you reply to a comment, your video 
reappears in your subscribers’ feeds and your Channel Feed or 
home page.
	
	Consider responding to comments a few at a time so that your video 
reappears a few different times throughout the day on your subscribers’ 
main feeds. Not everyone is online at the same time, so this tactic allows 
a greater number of people access to your content on a regular basis.
	
✓	Be a commenter. Don’t simply wait for people to comment on your 
work. Take an active role in your community. Identify those creating 
valuable content. March your happy self out into the wide world of 
YouTube and start commenting on other individuals’ and brands’ videos 
and clicking Like or Thumbs Up. If they are seeing your name or brand 
for the first time, they will hopefully be intrigued enough to visit you, 
watch some of your videos, and subscribe.
	
✓	Subscribe. While you are out watching, liking, and commenting, 
determine which channels you would like to visit regularly and click 
Subscribe. Some of those channels may eventually be ones that you fea­
ture on your own channel.
	
✓	Remove offensive comments. You have no obligation to keep offensive 
comments visible on your YouTube Channel. Taking the time to remove 
every comment that you don’t love is a waste of your time, but true 
spam, hatred, personal attacks, or anything else offensive can easily — 
and should — be taken down. As administrator of your channel, you 
have the tools to moderate comments.
	
	Don’t let spammers hijack your YouTube Channel. Allowing spam and 
hateful words to take up real estate can turn fans away and lead people 
to believe you don’t care about your channel. Block commenters who 
are repeatedly offensive. You can also flag for spam or simply remove 
their comments (see Figure 16-4).

Standing Out on YouTube
Millions of people produce videos every day, and thousands of those videos 
are good. You watch them, smile, laugh, and cry; the video ends and you 
move on. Certainly not every video can be a viral video and, in fact, very few 
are. Setting out to create a viral video is a lesson in futility.
What you want for your video is the “Watch this!” factor, even if it isn’t 
shared a million times. Any sharing at all is the chance to expose new people 
to your brand. Any one person who likes what she sees can potentially reach 
dozens, hundreds, or thousands of others simply because she shared your 
video. When this happens, you want to understand the qualities of that 
shared video so your next video and the one after that keeps people sharing.
Producing video content that 
keeps people watching
You’ve had those days when you just can’t escape that video. You know the 
one. The one that everyone is sharing. That popular video of the moment is on 
Twitter; it’s dominating your Facebook feed; it’s the topic of conversation at 
the work cocktail party; and even your mother calls you to tell you about it.
In October 2012, nearly 8 million people watched the live YouTube stream of 
Felix Baumgartner jumping from a platform nearly 128,000 feet above Earth, 
becoming the first person to break the sound barrier outside a vehicle. That 
video holds the record for the most concurrent views ever on YouTube.

As Baumgartner crushed that barrier, so did sponsor Red Bull, which was in 
control of the event; its logo was visible every small step of the way. To date, 
the Red Bull Stratos playlist, with 23 videos, has 69 million views total, with 
just one of the videos in that list topping 32 million (see Figure 16-5).

What made this YouTube campaign such a success? It built suspense, it was 
live action, and it involved branding.
Another extremely successful YouTube campaign was Old Spice’s 2010 
Old Spice Guy campaign, which began with a video of actor Isaiah Mustafa 
wrapped in a bath towel and came fully to life as he responded by video to 
tweets from social media personalities across the country. The video cam­
paign was full of humor and quickly evolved into something extraordinary, 
garnering more than 236 million views on YouTube and more than 80,000 
Twitter followers in just two days. Old Spice had both a viral video and an 
astronomical increase in sales.
Mastering metadata
Suppose that your first few videos don’t go viral (and there’s a 99.9 percent 
chance they won’t). You need to work to bring your audience to your video 
and channel. Much like inviting people to your blog through search engine 
placement, or starting a conversation on Twitter, or posting something to 
Facebook, getting your video out there needs to start with you.

Because YouTube is the No. 2 search engine in the world, it makes sense to 
master the way people find you when they search online. This is where your 
title, tags, and description come in.
Your title, tags, and description, or metadata, are indexed in YouTube’s algo­
rithm based on content. Videos are found based on promotion, ads, search,

tool at https://adwords.google.com/o/KeywordTool.
Title
Titles are the first things viewers see, but they aren’t only first impressions. 
Video titles are also key to placement within the ranks of search, so they 
must be good. Here are some tips for titles:
	
✓	Grab viewers’ attention. Make the titles compelling and clickable.
	
✓	Maximize search potential. Choose keywords carefully and strategically.
	
✓	Be honest. Don’t mislead your audience with false titles or phrases.
	
✓	Put the topic first and the brand second. Begin with the subject or 
keywords and then include the brand or show title (see Figure 16-6).

✓	Follow up. Dig into any older videos you’ve published, and update titles 
for relevancy to gain additional views.
Tags
Tags help you categorize your videos, grouping your videos into the relevant 
topics online. Depending on how well you tag, you can determine if you’re 
linked to trending topics. Here are some guidelines for tagging your videos:
	
✓	Include a mix of broad and specific tags. Here’s an example of a broad/
specific mix: Politics, Presidential Debate Denver, Mitt Romney, Barack 
Obama, Election 2012.
	
✓	Add consistency. Have a standard set of tags for your channel that 
apply to every video you publish. For example: business advice, busi­
ness tips, and social media and business.
	
✓	Don’t go overboard. There is no must-have number of tags, but do rea­
sonably cover all areas of your topic.
	
	We’ve found that 15 tags is a good amount.
	
✓	Include the title. Make sure the title of your video is also in the tags.
	
✓	Use quotation marks. Put any phrases in quotes, such as “Mickey 
Mouse” and “Walt Disney World.”
	
✓	Prioritize. List your tags based on importance, with the first ones being 
the most relevant.
	
Don’t put tags where they don’t belong. If you do, you could hurt your search 
ranking or risk the removal of your videos. The only place to include tags is 
in the Tags metadata section. Don’t even think about putting them into the 
description or YouTube may penalize you.
Description
The first few sentences of your description matter most because they are the 
only ones fully visible when a viewer first clicks to your video. The descrip­
tion helps persuade a potential new viewer to watch. Here’s what you should 
include in your description:
	
✓	Keywords: Include keywords from title and tags but not your actual 
tags.
	
✓	Links: Include clickable links to other sites and social networks.
	
✓	Time codes: If the video is long, consider including time codes, or par­
ticular moments in the video — 1:22 or 3:16 — that point to certain high­
lights in the video to entice people to keep watching.

 Chapter 16: YouTube
Using annotations and thumbnails
Video annotations are text and picture overlays enhancing your videos to 
boost your subscribers, likes, viewership, and engagement. These lines 
of text that appear over your actual videos are exclusive to YouTube and 
prompt your viewers to like or click Thumbs Up for your content, keep them 
watching longer, and push them to other videos on your channel.
Best uses for annotations
Some of the most effective uses of annotations include
	
✓	Adding a Subscribe button
	
✓	Adding fresh content to old videos
	
✓	Encouraging a Thumbs Up or Like
	
✓	Asking a question to engage your community
	
✓	Linking to other videos or playlists on YouTube
	
✓	Highlighting certain moments or time codes in the video
When it comes to using annotations, use your best judgment. Don’t spam 
your viewers with too many, or they will feel pressured to do too much. They 
should be able to enjoy the experience of watching your video without feeling 
bombarded.
	
Make sure any annotations you use are legible, and try to avoid using the 
lower third of the video because most advertisements are placed there, so any 
annotations would be obscured.
Types of annotations
As for the actual types of annotations, you have a few options:
	
✓	Customize your annotations based on size, shape, or color.
	
✓	Determine whether to include a link.
	
✓	Add a speech bubble to add a little creativity to the video.
	
✓	Use a spotlight to highlight an area, making it clickable. The text is vis­
ible only when the viewer moves the cursor over it.
	
✓	Play with the different types of annotations to determine what strategy 
works best for you.

Part V: Leveraging Audio and Video for Engagement 
	
Adopt an annotation strategy: Use the same annotations in each video 
whether it’s a call to action for subscribers or likes, or a prompt for viewers to 
watch a previous favorite video. Repetition in marketing is critical, so repeat­
ing your annotations can help get them noticed and used.
Best uses for thumbnails
Another important element you should never ignore is the thumbnail for 
your video. The thumbnail shot of your video is a teaser for what your audi­
ence can expect of your video. Ideally, you want a shot that looks good both 
large and small. If you or someone else is in the video, you want a thumbnail 
in which you or she isn’t caught with closed eyes and mouth wide open. Your 
thumbnail should reflect the story you’re about to tell in the video. ConAgra 
Foods’ Child Hunger Ends Here campaign released a video by country band 
Little Big Town. Viewers are instantly drawn to the video by the thumbnail of 
the band performing (see Figure 16-7).
	
Figure 16-7: 
A perfor-
mance 
thumbnail 
draws 
viewers in.
	
	
Don’t upload a false image to entice viewers to watch. Showcasing something 
that doesn’t actually exist in your video leaves you with many, many disap­
pointed viewers who may leave negative comments.
Extending Your Reach with Video
Make your video work for you in more than one way. While the YouTube 
community is strong and spending time nurturing those relationships can be 
extremely important, you want the value of your video to live well beyond 
the walls of this platform. The more people viewing the video you create, the 
more your video engagement continues to grow. We’re talking about extend­
ing your power of your video to a larger audience. And while you’re out build­
ing your community in person, why not learn to do a little video on the go?

Embedding and integrating your videos
When your videos are posted to YouTube, your work isn’t done. Taking the 
additional time to embed those videos on other platforms can increase your 
reach exponentially. A good example is the Make it Count Nike video, shown 
embedded on Facebook in Figure 16-8. By taking the video from its home on 
YouTube and placing it in front of its Facebook audience, Nike started an 
entirely new conversation — generating hundreds of comments and thou­
sands of likes. By embedding the video in a new location, more fans saw the 
video and had a chance to talk about it.

Nike’s ad 
campaign 
was liked 
more than 
19,000 
times and 
received 
nearly 
700 com-
ments on 
Facebook.
	
YouTube makes it easy for you to embed your videos on virtually any 
platform — you can put them on your blog or Facebook, or share them on 
Twitter. You can even set up a board on Pinterest specifically to showcase 
your YouTube videos and pin videos straight from your channel.

To embed your videos, copy the URL from a specific YouTube video and 
paste it onto your Facebook Fan Page, into a tweet, or onto your blog post or 
web page. Grab the embed code by doing the following:
	
1.	Go to your YouTube Video.
	
2.	Beneath the video, click the Share button.
	
	 You will see a box that says Share This Video with a URL.
	
3.	To the right of Share This Video, click Embed.
	
	 A box with highlighted code appears.
	
4.	Copy the HTML code into the box.
	
5.	Paste the code into the HTML text portion of your blog post (or tweet 
or Facebook status).
Take the time to share your videos beyond YouTube for greater exposure so 
not only your current audience and community sees it, but also other people 
who may be seeing you for the very first time. These people are potential 
new subscribers and prospective customers.
Taking advantage of video responses
A creative way to join a conversation on YouTube and to increase the chance 
of people seeing your videos is to use the video response feature. Instead 
of posting a traditional comment, respond to a video with your own video. 
When you do this, you put yourself in front of a whole new community and 
gain more exposure for your video channel and your brand.
For example, say there is a hot debate about homeschooling, and you have 
an opinion. Plenty of videos pop up online on the topic. You want to add your 
voice to the conversation, so you do the following:
	
1.	Create your video response to a hot topic.
	
2.	Upload it to YouTube, including title, tags, and description.
	
3.	Find a video you would like to respond to with that video response.
	
4.	Click the Comment box as though you are going to type a comment.
	
5.	Below the Comment box, click Create a Video Response.
	
	 All the videos you have ever created will appear within a box that says, 
‘Select the video you want to respond with’.
	
6.	Choose the video you want to use and then click Use the Selected 
Video.

 Chapter 16: YouTube
You may occasionally see an approval notice that tells you your video will be 
posted after it has been approved by the Channel owner of the original video 
that inspired your response. Other YouTube users approve video responses 
automatically.
	
You can create video responses for your own content — this increases the 
chances you show up as a suggested video on the right-hand side of the 
screen for your own videos, thereby prompting viewers to check out more of 
your content.
Uploading video on the go
Maybe you want to take this whole YouTube business slowly or you’re not 
quite certain you want to invest in a brand new digital video camera. The 
good news is that you probably have a suitable video camera on your mobile 
phone! Chances are it’s all you need to get started. Both the iPhone and 
Android phones make it a snap to go from point, shoot, record, upload to 
publish in a matter of minutes. So, you can’t use the lack-of-camera excuse to 
hold you back from leveraging video to engage online.
On both platforms, you can follow the sharing options after you record a 
video. Both iPhone and Android will allow you to enter a title, tags, and a 
description; opt to make the video public or private; and publish directly to 
YouTube.
At this time, both Windows and BlackBerry phones do not have a way to 
automatically upload to YouTube.
Analyzing your impact
YouTube makes it easy for you to monitor your influence online. Stats in the 
back end of your YouTube Channel track everything from overall perfor­
mance to how many actual views your videos have received to how many 
minutes people spent watching your videos over the course of a month.
You can break down your analytics to the top ten most watched videos and 
find out at what point people stop watching certain videos — important infor­
mation to know. You can also learn where your audience is in the world, if 
they came to you from another YouTube video or from an external site, and if 
they are male or female. You can even see what percentage of your audience 
is watching from a computer versus a mobile device. See Figure 16-9 for an 
example of YouTube statistics.

know that’s the goal.

hat fun would it be if we failed to list the pitfalls you must avoid when 
wading into the wide and wonderful world of social media engage­
ment? There are many ways to plan how to do things well, yet just as many 
small (and big) ways to make a misstep. Plan ways to avoid making these ten 
mistakes as you plan your best strategy for engagement, and you’ll be well on 
your way to success.
Flying by the Seat of Your Pants
Sure, you’ve been engaging your entire life, but social media engagement is a 
whole new animal, and it requires a plan. Running out to sign up for Twitter, 
Facebook, or Google+ with no thought to how you will dedicate time to 
connect with your community or respond to them after they realize that 
you’re online would be disastrous. You must determine not only who will 
be in charge of your social media engagement but also which platforms are 
appropriate for your brand or business.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Take the time to put an action plan in place so that you’re prepared to 
engage with your audience and ready to respond when they reach out to 
you — because they will, and they want to know that you’re listening.
	
Operating without a plan can lead you down a path of missteps — one that 
can be detrimental to your business and brand reputation.
Using Too Much Automation
We understand that you may want to automate some content because you 
can’t sit in front of your computer 24 hours a day, and it’s certainly impos­
sible to be on all your platforms at any given time. Do too much automating, 
however, and your community will peg you as a robot. If they respond to 
your automated content and you never reply, they eventually give up.
Take the time to balance the pins, videos, Facebook and Twitter posts you 
share, and schedule specific slots during the day when you follow up on the 
chosen platforms to ensure that you’re engaging with your audience. The 
time you take to have a conversation, to respond, and to let your community 
know that you’re listening makes all the difference in making real connec­
tions with real people.
Broadcasting or Sharing 
Only Your Content
We know you’ve had the experience of meeting someone new who can’t help 
but talk on and on about himself. This behavior seems harmless at first . . . 
and then slightly annoying . . . and then intolerable. In terms of social media 
engagement, your audience is initially curious about you, but after being 
incessantly bombarded with your products and posts about how wonderful 
you are, they’re first bored and irritated, and then they become turned off by 
your self-centered attitude. They’ll deliberately make the extra effort to unfol­
low you while simultaneously signaling their action to all their friends.
Choose the alternative: Make your engagement a two-way street. Talk, share 
valuable content from other people, praise others, have conversations, and 
reply to comments and questions.
	
Your community is made up of people who care about how you treat them — 
not just what you offer as products or services.

 Chapter 17: Ten Social Media Engagement Mistakes to Avoid
Being Inconsistent
Suppose that you post five times on Monday and then post nothing again 
until Thursday. You post a video on Tuesday, update Google+ and Facebook 
on Friday, spend two hours on Pinterest on Sunday, and then disappear for a 
week, leaving questions unanswered and replies swinging in the social media 
wind. Your community of customers and prospects doesn’t know what to 
think of your erratic behavior. Do you want to engage or not? Inconsistency 
will grow old quickly, and your audience will disappear as they realize that 
they can’t rely on you to be present regularly. You’ll come across as though 
you’re not listening — and nobody likes to be ignored.
Instead, set a schedule. Choose the platforms that generate the most value 
for you and your brand, and then make a commitment to them. Make the time 
to engage. Consistency has its rewards, including stronger connections with 
others.
Lacking Personality
Human beings connect to other human beings. If people see you as simply a 
logo on a computer screen, it’s difficult for them to connect with you. Social 
media must be social. You’re naturally drawn to the people and relationships 
that make you laugh, that make you think, that bring out the best in you — 
as are your customers and prospects in social networks. Be personable. Be 
kind. Everything you say online reflects on you and your brand. Put someone 
at the helm of your brand engagement who is willing to push the envelope 
and able to come across as genuine, friendly, and approachable.
Keep in mind that you, as a brand or business, should determine ahead of 
time what brand personality will be reflected online: wise, witty, sharp, intel­
ligent, humorous, earnest, or informative. After you make that decision, go 
for it!
Ignoring Feedback
Your community uses your social media platforms as a way to tell you that 
they love you — but also that they’re disappointed in you. A simple thank-
you for a compliment can go a long way. Acknowledging positive comments 
says to someone that you’re listening, and being heard resonates with a 
person.

340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Alternatively, ignoring a customer’s negative feedback can be detrimental to 
your brand. Know that your community watches to see how you handle both 
the good and the bad. Burying or dismissing the bad makes you appear as 
though you have something to hide. Handle online negativity with care and 
concern. Deal out in the open (for the most part) with complaints that are 
made publicly. Others will see your good customer service in action, poten­
tially earning you a new, reinforced fan base and often turning a disgruntled 
customer into a happy and loyal one.
Give your community the opportunity to see you as a responsive brand with 
caring individuals behind the logo. You will be amazed at how closely your 
customer service interactions in social media are followed and even shared 
with others.
Assuming That Social Media Is Easy
Social media engagement, friends, is hard work. Creating a social media 
engagement strategy for your business or brand, putting it into action, moni­
toring it, engaging with your community, tweaking the plan, and ensuring that 
you’re present takes time and effort, and a lot of it. To assume that you can 
invest just a little bit of time — that you can “dial it in” in less than an hour or 
two a week — will be the death of your efforts. Social media engagement, as a 
way to build your business, isn’t a cakewalk. It’s an ongoing learning process 
that is ever-changing. Every day, you schedule, implement your plan, and 
modify the plan based on your successes — and then you have (you hope) 
the benefit of seeing your hard work pay off. But you definitely don’t have the 
luxury of sitting back and watching it happen for you.
Spamming
Spamming others is easily one of the worst errors you can make. Sending out 
link after link, e-mail after e-mail, or pin after pin of the same content or of 
commercials gets you nowhere. No one wants to be spammed by an endless 
stream of your sales pitches, or by your links or lists of why your audience 
simply must be following your every move. Always have your community’s 
permission to send them your information, and remember how easily they 
can opt out of receiving it.
	
Whether you spam e-mail inboxes with unrequested content or cram your 
social network feeds with one-sided announcements, nothing turns off a 
potential fan or customer more quickly than spam. Just don’t do it.

 Chapter 17: Ten Social Media Engagement Mistakes to Avoid
Posting the Same Content Everywhere
You can easily copy and paste your content from Twitter to Google+ to 
LinkedIn or cross-post the same content to all your social networks at one 
time by using a messaging tool. Your audiences on each platform deserve 
more than that, however. Fans who follow you on more than one network 
may quickly spot the repeats, making you appear lazy and unoriginal. Though 
the occasional cross-posting doesn’t signal the end of the world, take the 
time to tailor your content for each network: What engages well on Facebook 
may need to be tweaked for Twitter. Being specific to each network requires 
more work and more effort, but the difference in the level of engagement is 
noticeable.
Repeating Mistakes
Pay attention to what is happening when you’re engaging with your commu­
nity online. You’ll do some things well, such as post content that resonates 
with your audience, tweets that are retweeted, videos that are shared, and 
Instagram pictures that make your community giddy. And some of your mes­
sages will backfire, Facebook updates will fall flat, or employees will convey 
the wrong messages in your stream. Take note of what works, and do more of 
it. Note what didn’t work, and avoid repeating those same errors. Have a plan 
for recovering from errors, notice when they happen, respond immediately 
and take responsibility, and then learn from your mistakes.

Ten Businesses That Excel at 
Social Media Engagement
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding your audience’s needs
▶	Honing your social networking skills
▶	Adopting the right attitude online
▶	Leveraging content to attract attention
W

e evaluated several companies after speaking with a wide array of 
people and industry leaders who have tackled different platforms for 
social media engagement. Each company featured in this chapter has identi­
fied the channels where they have the most success and where they regularly 
engage with their communities for the best results. 
These businesses all have a few characteristics in common: They create 
plans that work for their brands, they diligently monitor their activities, they 
adjust whenever necessary (based on the results they see), and they engage.
Wine Sisterhood
www.winesisterhood.com, www.facebook.com/winesisterhood
Women can join the conversation at the online community Wine Sisterhood 
(based in Napa, California) to discuss wine, food, travel, style, and enter­
taining. The group’s mission is to entertain, educate, inform, and inspire 
women, and they do so on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Tumblr, 
Foursquare, and (more recently) Google+. 
Tips
	
✓	Know your audience, and know what inspires them to respond. Wine 
Sisterhood realizes that humor goes a long way with their female audi­
ence and that quirky products or wine crafts are true crowd-pleasers.

✓	Become more visual. Wine Sisterhood emphasizes visual elements 
(rather than plain-text quotes or links) on its page.
	
✓	Distribute duties to better manage the load. Two team members, in 
two time zones, monitor comments and Facebook messages on the 
Sisterhood’s Facebook Page several times a day, and they make a point 
to respond within 24 to 48 hours to all inquiries and requests.
Avoid this pitfall: Ignoring what your fans want. Whenever the Wine 
Sisterhood deviated from light-hearted and quick-witted Facebook posts and 
presented a more serious tone, their interactions dipped, with only a few 
exceptions, such as posts about major events (Hurricane Sandy, for exam­
ple). Knowing its audience and delivering more of what they want maintains a 
high level of interaction and actions on Facebook.
Gauge positive results: Without a doubt, Facebook has delivered the great­
est amount of traffic to its website and driven a good portion of its online 
wine-club registrations and online and offline wine sales. As of this writing, 
the company was gearing up to incorporate an online shop of wine-related 
and lifestyle products directly into its Facebook Page in addition to a social 
media-powered e-commerce site.
Mabel’s Labels
www.mabelslabels.com, www.facebook.com/Mabelhood
Created by four Canadian moms with an eye for beauty and a mind for busi­
ness, Mabel’s Labels produces durable “labels for the stuff kids lose.” In its 
tenth year, the company has grown from working in one person’s basement 
to a 14,000-square-foot commercial space with 40 employees. Though the 
company started on Twitter, its Facebook community is 60,000 strong and 
growing. And now Pinterest has become a priority as well. For the brand, 
choosing one person to maintain its social media was crucial — it now pres­
ents a unified voice across all platforms as it continues to grow — recently 
making the move into Target stores. 
Tips
	
✓	Avoid using social media as a sales tool. Be involved in conversations. 
Don’t push your products — that’s boring. If you engage with your com­
munity, they’ll buy your products.
	
✓	Use social media engagement as a customer service tool. Though many 
brands delete negative feedback, use it instead as an opportunity to 
solve the problem publicly and gain a new fan base. Use the critique to 
show your customers that you don’t hide behind mistakes — you’re will­
ing to fix them.

 Chapter 18: Ten Businesses That Excel at Social Media Engagement
	
✓	Don’t waste time “toe-dipping.” People are talking about your brand 
and products. Either you’re part of the conversation or you aren’t. If 
you’re nervous, begin by joining the conversation and then move to a 
second when you’re comfortable.
Avoid this pitfall: Not being mindful of saying or doing something that 
would damage your brand. Julie Cole, cofounder of Mabel’s Labels, puts it 
eloquently: “Social media is the voice of your brand. Every time you engage, 
you’re either contributing to your brand or contaminating it.”
Gauge positive results: Mabel’s Labels keeps an eye on its links, Facebook 
likes, comments, shares, and overall statistics, but its true return on invest­
ment (ROI) comes in the form of in-person relationships. Cole registers hugs 
at conferences and events as indications that its social media engagement 
efforts are truly successful.
Girls Crochet Headbands
www.girlscrochetheadbands.com, www.facebook.com/girls
crochetheadbands
The online boutique Girls Crochet Headbands (GCH) is filled with girls’ fash­
ion accessories, including bloomers, tutus, and headbands. Since 2008, it 
has served more than 2 million customers, a number that continues to grow 
because of the company’s presence on Facebook (its preferred social media 
space). In mid-2012, GCH hired Shelly Kramer and her company,V3 Integrated 
Marketing to help it rebrand and create its new digital strategy, putting in 
place a social media team that also understands the brand — and engages 
daily with the GCH community. In the first seven months, the GCH Facebook 
community more than doubled, by using not only product promotions, cou­
pons, and contests but also true conversation. Many posts are liked hundreds 
of times (and shared by the dozen). 
Tips
	
✓	Don’t assume that you can follow only one formula. Don’t follow a 
posting “regiment,” such as four tweets a day, three personal posts and 
one promotional post on Facebook. Treat your brand page much like 
you treat your personal page — engage honestly and authentically, and 
post a variety of content.
	
✓	Build a community team that understands social media and your 
brand. GCH’s social team is not only comprised of people who get social 
media, but they are interested in the brand itself. Many are moms (as 
are the clientele), so the voice used to connect with the audience is 
genuine.

✓	Post on weekends. Social media isn’t a 9-to-5 job. By ignoring the week­
end, you miss an important opportunity to engage with potential fans 
and followers.
Avoid this pitfall: Getting started with social media engagement before you 
know what success looks like to you and your brand. You first have to ask 
why you even want to engage on social media. For Girls Crochet Headbands, 
customer service is a fundamental aspect of engagement — at least 50 per­
cent of customers’ questions are directed to its Facebook page — so one 
driving motivation to exist in that space is to engage with its customers and 
answer questions.
Gauge positive results: Though Pinterest and Twitter definitely attract atten­
tion from the social media team at Girls Crochet Headbands, if the group’s 
efforts were split into a pie, Facebook would grab the largest slice. The team 
focuses its attention not only on the platform where its customers spend 
the bulk of their time but also on the one that generates the highest level of 
traffic and percentage of sales. For GCH, the winner in that department is 
Facebook.
Ramon DeLeon, Marketing Mind 
behind 6-Store Domino’s Pizza 
Franchise, Chicago
www.twitter.com/Ramon_DeLeon
Ramon DeLeon, has always worked passionately to prioritize the use of 
common sense in business and to strive to wow his customers. His unique 
characteristic is that he knows exactly what his customers need to hear at 
any given moment. Ramon engages with them daily (some would say hourly) 
on Facebook, but mostly on Twitter, even creating videos when necessary. 
He and a store manager once responded this way to a tweet from a cus­
tomer who was disappointed in an order: They first refunded her money and 
replaced the order, and then they apologized — in a video that has since 
been viewed thousands of times. Ramon, known for using (appropriately) the 
hashtag #ramonwow on Twitter, offers advice in the form of the acronym he 
lives by: RAT — Be Real, Be Accessible, Be Transparent.
Tips
	
✓	Be real: When you engage with your community, you need to focus on 
being you at all times — that’s who your audience wants to get to know.

 Chapter 18: Ten Businesses That Excel at Social Media Engagement
	
✓	Be accessible: You must have the proper tools (smartphones and apps, 
for example) to ensure that you’re available and listening whenever your 
audience reaches out.
	
✓	Be transparent: Recognize that whatever you say can be used against 
you. Anything that you add to the social media space is open for scrutiny.
Avoid this pitfall: Wasting time without acting. The social media space is a 
busy one, and you can easily busy yourself with trivial tasks. Ramon explains: 
“Things are happening — don’t wait. Don’t let your job get in the way of your 
career. Done beats perfect. Trust yourself, and trust your instincts.”
Gauge positive results: Ramon measures the success of his social media 
engagement by the number and quality of responses he receives from cus­
tomers online and by the measurable moments of success in his stores. In 
early 2013, he received an award for leading sales in the Midwest region, and 
four of his six stores were in the top ten in the Chicago Area. 
Cabot Creamery Cooperative
http://cabotcheese.coop, http://pinterest.com/cabotcheese
Based in Montpelier, Vermont, Cabot Creamery is owned by more than 1,200 
dairy farm families, located in rural communities throughout New England 
and upstate New York. The farmers own and operate four facilities to pro­
duce award-winning, all-natural cheeses and dairy products, including the 
“world’s best Cheddar.” Cabot engaged on Pinterest early on, then suddenly 
website traffic coming from Pinterest spiked as the new social network 
grew in popularity. Pinterest proved to be a perfect partner for showcas­
ing the lives of the Cabot farm families and the allure of the rural Northeast 
(especially Vermont) — and for featuring delicious recipes created using 
Cabot products. The Cabot cooperative honors community, and cooperation 
anchors its social strategy on behalf of the farmer-owners. 
Tips
	
✓	Appreciate. Appreciate your fans honestly, by pinning, sharing, and 
commenting on their content.
	
✓	Connect. Nurture and build authentic, ongoing relationships with your 
followers. (Cabot’s consumers are active in social media.)
	
✓	Connect even more. Use Pinterest as a vivid platform to deepen connec­
tions with consumers and content creators from other platforms by pin­
ning content from their sites.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Avoid this pitfall: Trying to follow all your fans, all the time. Cabot has 
always followed all its fans in return for following the company. Team 
members realized early on, however, that they could follow specific (and 
pertinent) Pinterest boards in order to review and savor fans’ recipes and 
content — and then share only the most complementary content.
Gauge positive results: Pinterest is the perfect platform to showcase the farm 
families who own Cabot, their cows, and (of course) their mouth-watering 
food. Pictures truly tell the full story, and quickly. The Pinterest community, 
which has grown continually and steadily, has become a helpful source of 
traffic to and from the Cabot recipes. Pinterest also affords a two-way path to 
bloggers and other content creators who enhance the farmers’ products and 
purpose.
Nylabone
www.nylabone.com, www.facebook.com/Nylabone, https://plus.
google.com/+nylabone
Putting their company on the cutting edge of social media is a priority for 
the folks at Nylabone, which has been entrenched in social media since early 
2009. They began with Facebook and have now even adopted the brand-new 
platform Vine. The social media team strives to cover all its bases by devel­
oping a presence on any social media site where customers are spending 
time. Though Facebook is where they see their greatest level of engagement, 
they believe it is important to embrace new social media platforms that 
have less “noise” and where it’s more cost effective to develop a community. 
For example, though Google + is one of the newer platforms, Nylabone has 
established a strong presence there, noting the opportunity to reach their 
customers and take advantage of the special features: Hangouts, Circles, and 
Adwords. 
Tips
	
✓	Observe results, and respond accordingly: Ideas that you believe will 
be hugely successful sometimes aren’t, and less appealing ideas can 
turn into gold. Be adaptable, and be fearless in applying new content 
ideas.
	
✓	Add value: Ask “What value does my content provide to a consumer 
following our brand?” For example, it may be entertainment, education, 
current events, coupons, or giveaways. Give people a reason to follow it 
by offering interesting and valuable content! (Don’t post only about your 
own products or services.)

 Chapter 18: Ten Businesses That Excel at Social Media Engagement
	
✓	Follow our 70-20-10 rule for dedicating time on social media: Spend 70 
percent on entertaining your community with interesting and compelling 
content (as just described); 20 percent on asking consumers to share 
their photos or stories and thanking them for engaging with your brand 
(always respond to their questions!); and 10 percent on marketing your 
products and services. A small amount of obvious promotion is fun and 
inviting as long as it aligns with the theme of your content.
Avoid this pitfall: Inadvertently upsetting your online community. Do lots of 
industry research and figure out what the controversial topics are and try to 
avoid posting about those issues. Develop a Crisis Strategy for your brand 
so you know exactly how to deal with an issue (should any arise) in a timely 
manner. Addressing a negative post or situation can create a new positive 
relationship with your online community.
Gauge positive results: Nylabone measures SME in a variety of ways. They 
track online leads via brand community growth on Facebook, Twitter, other 
social media sites, and its e-mail marketing lists. Additionally, they measure 
success based on brand impressions, customer engagement, website refer­
rals and conversions, and online coupons/offer redemption. Beyond that, 
they hope to gain a better understanding of their target market, gauge cus­
tomers’ product needs, connect with brand advocates, and generate a posi­
tive brand image.
MomBiz
http://mombiz.com, http://mombizcoach.com, www.blogtalkradio.
com/mombizcoach
The coaching and training company known as MomBiz serves the global 
community of moms who are business owners. As the MomBiz Coach, Lara 
Galloway helps mom-entrepreneurs figure out how to survive motherhood, 
and even thrive in it, by creating and running businesses they love. For more 
than four years, the MomBiz Solutions Show podcast has provided informa­
tion about successfully running a business that suits women’s strengths, 
skills, and priorities. MomBiz uses Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, 
Pinterest, and podcasting. 
Tips
	
✓	Market and promote your podcast. To encourage your audience to 
look forward to hearing about a topic, let them know in advance that 
you plan to discuss it. Galloway uses e-mail newsletters, Twitter, and 
Facebook and Facebook groups to alert people to upcoming topics.
www.Ebook777.com

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
	
✓	Ask your readers, listeners, and followers what they want to know 
about a topic. For example, if Lara talks about the difference between 
blogging for fun and blogging for business, she asks clients about the 
topic and incorporates their answers into a podcast.
	
✓	Archive and leverage your podcast. When your podcast is complete, 
archive it and post it to your blog, your Facebook Page, and your other 
social networks and highlight some of the material you covered. Ask 
more questions to generate discussion so that people will listen to your 
podcast and give feedback.
Avoid this pitfall: Recording a podcast in a robotic voice, devoid of nuance. 
Rather than read a perfectly crafted script, let your audience hear you speak 
in a conversational style and even occasionally stumble over a word or 
phrase or make a mistake.
Gauge positive results: About 80 percent of Galloway’s clients find her by 
way of her social media channels, especially Twitter and Facebook and her 
podcast on BlogTalkRadio. (Most clients have listened to every archived 
show from the past four years.) The podcast helps Galloway attract highly 
qualified — and even ideal — clients.
Blendtec
www.Blendtec.com, www.willitblend.com, www.youtube.com/
blendtec
The Blendtec blender is the brainchild of Tom Dickson, a curious and inven­
tive man who tirelessly demonstrates his product (while always working to 
improve it). This flair for show-and-tell is a natural fit for his company’s foray 
into social media: YouTube. (It also engages heavily on Facebook, Twitter, 
and Pinterest.) The Will It Blend series — which showcases the marvel of his 
blender devouring products from crowbars to iPads and from glow sticks 
to golf balls — has garnered more than 80 million views (counting only the 
top ten blends!). A series of Blendtec recipes on YouTube has branched 
into other platforms featuring an entire social media team. On Pinterest, its 
recipes drive people to the company’s website, and its Twitter feed offers 
product-support articles and recipe tips and tricks. The team’s philosophy is 
to provide fans and customers with what they want, when they want it, and 
how they want it. 
Tips
	
✓	Provide the content that your audience wants — and can use. By 
showing your community how your product works — and how well — 
you encourage them not only to buy, but to come back to your channels 
for inspiration. Think recipes and new products.

 Chapter 18: Ten Businesses That Excel at Social Media Engagement
	
✓	Provide excellent customer service. In the age of social media, people 
often forego phone calls to ask questions on Facebook or Twitter.
	
✓	Strategize your engagement based on the platform you’re using. For 
example, because Facebook posts reportedly have a longer life span 
than tweets do, try to post there twice a day; on Twitter, tweet between 
four and ten times a day.
Avoid this pitfall: Not finding out what your community wants from you. 
Blendtec gives customers more of what they want by listening to their feed­
back. They go the extra mile by allowing their fans on social media to evalu­
ate new ideas. Blendtec then gains a sense of what its community believes 
will be awesome content.
Gauge positive results: The Blendtec team looks at the goals they have for 
the specific platforms. They know that its fans on Facebook are more likely 
to click a link and purchase a product from the site than its Twitter followers, 
so its Facebook strategy includes support and additional links; on Twitter, 
on the other hand, it focuses on providing information and support for cus­
tomers and potential customers, including supplying links to its blog. For 
Blendtec, success means providing customers and potential customers with 
the content they want.
Chobani
http://chobani.com, http://instagram.com/chobani
Though Chobani, an American brand that makes Greek-style yogurt from 
natural ingredients, is active on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, Vine, 
Tumblr, Foursquare, Yelp, and LinkedIn, the company uses Instagram to 
capture snapshots of followers using its products, for sharing sneak peeks 
into new products, and for looking behind the scenes at Chobani. They like to 
show that the company focuses on more than yogurt.
Tips
	
✓	Monitor hashtags. Chobani monitors several hashtags, including #cho­
bani, #nothingbutgood, #greekyogurt, and #tastereal to ensure that it 
stays on top of relevant conversation.
	
✓	Engage, engage, engage. To show fans that the company is listening, 
Chobani engages with every post as it relates to the brand by liking or 
commenting on fan photos that mention @chobani or that use a relevant 
hashtag. Fans feel special when the company likes the images they post.
	
✓	Plan content for engagement. Chobani invests a significant amount of 
time and thought in its online content. The digital team makes unique 
Chobani creations and parfaits at its regular “creation hour” so that fans

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
can see unique ways to spice up their Chobani yogurt. The company often 
reposts great-looking fan images and holds regular, Chobani-branded gear 
giveaways to give back to the community and increase engagement.
Avoid this pitfall: Being disingenuous in social networks. The best lesson 
Chobani learned on Instagram (and it applies to all social media platforms) 
is to be personable and genuine and show fans that you’re human. Engage 
in conversations that are the most relevant to you and your brand so they 
match your brand’s image and personality.
Gauge positive results: Chobani’s best successes happen when it engages 
with unhappy customers. Its immediate, intimate responses keep fans coming 
back for more — and quickly clear up concerns or misconceptions while pos­
sibly building fans for life.
AJ Bombers
http://ajbombers.com, http://foursquare.com/ajbombers
AJ Bombers, a family-style burger restaurant with locations in Milwaukee 
and Madison, Wisconsin, uses many of the major social networks (primarily, 
Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, Instagram, YouTube, and Tumblr) to engage 
with its guests — connecting with them even while they’re dining at the res­
taurant and promoting to them when they’re nearby. 
Tips
	
✓	Speak your customers’ language. Know your audience.
	
✓	Focus on the community. Keep the community of your customers in 
mind when building your customer base. AJ Bombers thinks of itself as 
“one of the crowd,” and invites customers to be part of their crowd.
	
✓	Highlight the actions of your biggest fans. Cultivate engagement from 
your most enthusiastic customers, and recognize them publicly.
Avoid this pitfall: Assuming that everyone knows about a particular social 
network. In its first large-scale Foursquare promotion, four staff members were 
placed in a “Foursquare training area,” where any customer who wanted to load 
the app to a mobile device could do so and learn the basics of how to check in. 
This effort was the key to the enthusiastic participation of many other guests.
Gauge positive results: AJ Bombers creates events incorporating Foursquare 
badges and then entices customers to its restaurant to gain access to the 
badges on their own Foursquare accounts. One Sunday event was centered 
around the Foursquare Swarm badge. Promoting the event in its social net­
works and restaurant location drew 161 people to check in and earn the 
badge. And, sales for the day increased by 110 percent.
