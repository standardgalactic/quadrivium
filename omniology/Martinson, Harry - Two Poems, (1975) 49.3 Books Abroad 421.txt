ham Jay Smith. What one single member of the Academy has done in a few months 
to introduce (primarily) British and American poets to a wider audience in Sweden 
stands in marked contrast to the efforts of dozens of American critics who over 
roughly the same period have covered the work and personalities of - Ingrid Bergman 
and Liv Ullman! Fair exchange, gentlemen!

Out at Sea 
HARRY MARTINSON 
Out at sea one feels a spring or a summer merely as a passing breeze. 
Sometimes in the summer the drifting Florida sea-weed blooms, 
and on a spring evening a spoon-bill stork flies in towards Holland. 
The Cable Ship 
On latitude 15 degrees North, longitude 61 degrees West, 
between Barbados and Tortuga, we fished up the Atlantic cable, 
held up our lanterns 
and pasted fresh rubber over the wound in its back. 
When we put our ears to the injured spot, 
we heard how it hummed inside. 
One of us said: 
"It is the millionaires in Montreal and Saint Johns who are speaking 
about the price of sugar from Cuba and the lowering of our wages." 
In a circle of lanterns we stood there long and thought, 
we patient cable fishermen, 
then we lowered the mended cable 
down to its home in the sea.
