RIPv2
RIPv2
• Simplest of all dynamic protocols for PE-CE routing
• VRF configuration done under the address family for the 
VRF (identical to BGP)
• Commands applied to the global RIP process can be 
inherited by the VRFs
– version
– passive-interface default
• MP-BGP can carry the RIP metric between VPN sites by 
setting the MED equal to the RIP hop count.
• Avoids sub-optional routing and/or routing loops
• Single command under the VRF RIP process
–
redistribute bgp <as-number> metric transparent

EIGRP
EIGRP
•
Configuration identical to RIP and BGP for VRFs
•
The autonomous system number can be manually set using the 
autonomous-system <as number> command under the EIGRP VRF 
routing process
•
Commonly the same AS number is used between PE routers
– Internal EIGRP routes from one VPN site will be learned as internal 
routes in other VPN sites
– External EIGRP routes do not change between VPN sites
•
Different AS’s can be used between the PE routers
– Internal EIGRP routes from one VPN site will be learned as External 
EIGRP routes
– External EIGRP routes do not change between VPN sites
•
BGP MEDs and extended communities are used to carry the AS 
number, route type, and EIGRP metric values
– Automatically done by the PE routers

EIGRP (cont)
EIGRP (cont)
• Sub-optional routing and/or routing loops can 
occur due to the fact the EIGRP metric is not 
altered when sent from PE to PE via MP-BGP
• To overcome this issue the BGP cost community 
is used to compare EIGRP learned routes with 
MP-iBGP routes based on their metric and not 
the administrative distance between iBGP and 
EIGRP
• The BGP cost community is advertised to iBGP
and confederation peers
• No configuration is required

EIGRP Site of Origin
EIGRP Site of Origin
•
Speeds up routing convergence when “backdoor” links are used 
along with mutual redistribution on the PE routers
•
Prevents EIGRP routes from being learned from one VPN site to a 
PE, onto another VPN, and finally back to another PE
•
SoO feature must be supported by all PE and CE routers
•
If the SoO value in an EIGRP update is the same the value 
configured under for the VRF site map on the receiving interface the 
update is dropped
•
Configuration is applied inbound on the PE router’s interfaces and 
the CE/C router’s backdoor link interfaces

OSPF PE
OSPF PE--CE Routing
CE Routing
• Running OSPF as PE-CE implies redistribution 
of OSPF and BGP
– Traditional OSPF to IPv4 Unicast BGP redistribution 
does not preserve OSPF route information
• OSPF to MP-BGP redistribution defines 
encoding of OSPF info as BGP extended 
community
– Preserves OSPF route type
• Originating area
• LSA type
• E1 or E2 for external and N1 or N2 for NSSA
– Preserves OSPF router-id
– Defines OSPF “domain-id”

OSPF Domain
OSPF Domain--ID
ID
• Domain-ID encodes where route was originated 
from
• When domain-id matches on VPN sites the 
MPLS network is treated like OSPF area 0 (AKA 
“Superbackbone”)
– OSPF routes from VPN site 1 seen as inter-area on 
VPN site 2
• When domain-id is different OSPF routes from 
VPN site 1 seen as external on VPN site 2
• Domain-ID inferred from process-id
– Can be manually set with domain id process level 
command

OSPF Sham Links
OSPF Sham Links
• Even if domain-ID matches and area is the same 
on both sides routes are seen as LSA 3 between 
VPN sites
• If a backdoor link running OSPF exists between 
VPN sites it will always be preferred
– Intra-Area
– Inter-Area
– External
– NSSA External
• OSPF “Sham Link” can be used as a virtual-link 
over the MPLS network
– Routes learned via MP-BGP redistribution can be 
seen as intra-area routes

OSPF MPLS VPN Notes
OSPF MPLS VPN Notes
• If the PE router's OSPF process ID’s do not 
match the intra-area routes learned via MP-BGP 
will be External Type-2
• If the PE router's OSPF process ID’s do match, 
or the process ID’s do not match but their 
domain-id's do match, the intra-area routes 
learned via MP-BGP will be inter-area
• If a sham-link is used, the intra-area routes 
learned via MP-BGP remain intra-area and the 
OSPF cost is 0 across the sham-link
• External OSPF routes will always be learned via 
MP-BGP as external

• Overrides an eBGP peer router’s AS 
number with the local router’s AS number 
in the as-path for a prefix
• If the allowas-in feature is not used the 
eBGP peer would drop the prefix due to 
the standard BGP loop-prevention 
mechanism
• Commonly used on the PE router

BGP SoO
SoO
• Basic theory similar to EIGRP SoO
• Used to prevent routing loops when dual homed 
PE to CE routing is being used along with the 
as-override feature
• BGP SoO is also useful when the as-override or 
allowas-in options are being used which means 
that the as-path loop prevention may not be 
reliable
• If a VPNv4 route is received with the same SoO
value used for the PE-CE peering, the route will 
not be installed into the VRF routing table or 
advertised to the CE
