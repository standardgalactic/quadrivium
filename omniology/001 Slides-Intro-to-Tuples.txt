Tuples
●
Tuples are another type of ordered sequence of items. Tuples are very similar to lists, and 
like lists support indexing and slicing;
●
A tuple is an immutable sequence. This is the key difference between tuples and lists.
●
To create a tuple we use parentheses and commas to separate elements.
>>> tuple4 = (1,2,3)
>>> tuple4
(1, 2, 3)
>>> my_tuple = (1, 4.5, 'python', [1,2,'a'], ('a',1))
>>> my_tuple
(1, 4.5, 'python', [1, 2, 'a'], ('a', 1))
>>> my_tuple[3]
[1, 2, 'a']
>>> my_tuple[0] = 7
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#2>", line 1, in <module>
    my_tuple[0] = 7
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
