SHELVING AND STORAGE  
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
Making storage space can be as simple as putting a hook on 
a wall, or as complex as a total loft conversion. Most jobs 
are a matter of a little imagination and some basic DIY skills.
  
 
 
Keep your fingers clear when nailing and screwing and 
especially when working with saws and chisels. Sharp tools 
are safer to use than blunt ones, so keep them in good 
working trim. Wear eye protection when necessary and be 
sure ladders are stable and safe. Dust is dangerous to the 
lungs so wear a mask when sanding.  
  
 
 
'A place for everything and everything in its place' - it's an 
old saying and it makes a lot of sense. 
 
2  - Planning the work  
Always plan for the major items to be stored first and decide 
how much space to allocate to them. Also, decide if you 
want freestanding units or built-in shelves and cupboards.  
 
 
 
When planning a complete room or floor of a house, make 
up your plan to scale on graph paper. This will give you an 
accurate idea of what's possible to achieve maximum 
storage capacity and ease of access.  
 
 
 
Items such as books in bulk which might cover a whole wall 
can act as soundproofing on an interior wall or as additional 
insulation on an outside one.  
 
 
 
Items can either be stored out of sight behind solid doors or 
displayed on open shelves or in glass-fronted cabinets.  
 
 
 
Plan your storage to allow for additional items to be added in
the future. It seems you can never have enough space.  
 
 
 
The height and positions of cupboards and shelves will 
depend a lot on how often you use them. In the kitchen this 
is particularly important since most articles are in regular 
use. There are also regulations relating to shelving and other
aspects of kitchen design, so it helps to be familiar with 
them. This information is available, free of charge, from your
local council.  
 
3  - Using redundant space 

Probably the easiest way to 
gain storage space in the 
home is to use the unused 
areas of the building itself. 
One of the most common of 
these is the area below a 
staircase. This is easily 
turned into storage for 
household items such as 
brushes and brooms. It can 
be simply shelved out and le
open- fronted (1) or cover
in as a complete cupboard.

Fireplaces are redundant in 
many homes and they can b
removed quite easily. You 
may need to employ a b
to ensure that no structura
damage is done to the house 
and to see that an air flow is 
maintained. The space gained
makes a useful storage area 
and can often remain a focal
point in the room (2).  
 
 
 
The alcoves on either side of a chimney breast can also be 
simply shelved out to create some very useful areas for 
storage. These are particularly useful as wardrobe spaces in 
the bedroom, either for freestanding units or built-in ones. 
Built-in wardrobes can be made to utilise all the available 
space to its fullest. Really deep alcoves can also be walk-in 
wardrobes or can even be used to house shower units.  
 
 
 
Check to see if space can be 
gained by removing a door o  
by re-hanging it to open the 
opposite way (3). Floor space
may also be gained by using 
a sliding door in certain 
situations. Sometim
of these solutions can free u
a lot of space along a wall.

This is the one place where 
you really can't have storage 
in the middle of the floor 
area, but the walls and roof 
space provide excellent 
alternatives (8). 
 
You don't have to consider 
how things look on the walls 
of a garage, so you can use 
the whole area to its best 
advantage.  
 
Store larger items such as 
heavy containers, mowers 
and bicycles at ground level. 
Fit shelving to store other 
items. Keep most items 
above floor level, both to save space and to make picking 
them up easier.  
 
 
 
Remember to keep regularly-used items at eye level and 
within easy reach.  
 
 
 
Many of the mechanical items stored in garages are either 
heavy or dirty and oily. One useful heavy-duty shelving 
system is scaffolding. If you have the space, one or two 
sections of tower scaffold can be used to make a sturdy 
frame that you can clad out in sawn timber.  
 
 
 
Long items such as ladders can be stored in the roof area, or
if you have a flat roof, they can be hung from the ceiling or 
wall by some of the large hooks available.  
 
 
 
If you do find you have sufficient floor area to accommodate 
a chest freezer this will free up the kitchen space. Services 
permitting, the washing machine and tumble dryer could 
also be usefully stored out here. If you want to use the 
garage as a workshop but are tight on space, use a folding 
bench that can be hung on the wall well out of the way when
not in use.
