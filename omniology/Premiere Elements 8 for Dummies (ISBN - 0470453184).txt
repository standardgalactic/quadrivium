Author’s Acknowledgments
So many people helped me complete this project that I hardly know where to 
begin. First and foremost I wish to thank my family for allowing me to work 
two full-time jobs as I completed this updated edition Premiere Elements 8 
For Dummies. My wife, Christa, has been my entire support staff, head cheer-
leader, creative advisor, and inspiration throughout my entire writing career. 
She was the one who urged me to start writing for a small motorcycle maga-
zine in 1995, and that endeavor has led to so many great adventures and chal-
lenges in the years since. I owe everything to Christa.
My undying gratitude also goes out to my two very favorite movie subjects, 
Soren and Cole Underdahl. Not only do my boys take direction well, but they 
are also incredibly intelligent and look great on camera! I also received help 
both on-screen and behind the scenes from Ryan Holbrook, as well as James 
Singleton and his band, Komakazies.
I wish I could take full credit for the quality and content of Premiere Elements 
8 For Dummies, but many other kind folks contributed to this work to make it 
what it is. I’d like to thank Amy Fandrei for giving me the opportunity to give 
Premiere Elements 8 For Dummies a much needed update, my project editor 
Rebecca Huehls, my technical editor Dennis Cohen, my copy editor Debbye 
Butler, and the many other folks at Wiley who toiled to make this one of the 
best references on Adobe Premiere Elements to be found.
I had help from some industry people, including Andy Marken and many fi ne 
folks at Adobe who invited me to help develop this excellent video-editing 
tool. I’ve been on the user side of Adobe software for a long time, and I am 
honored to contribute to their testing and development programs as well.

Introduction
B
ack in the Dark Ages — a mere decade or two ago — most video edit-
ing was conducted in specialized TV and movie production facilities 
with equipment that cost millions of dollars. Then in 1993, Adobe released a 
program called Premiere. Adobe Premiere introduced the ability to edit video 
on conventional desktop computers, a revolutionary idea at the time. This 
dropped the cost of video-editing systems from millions of dollars down to 
mere thousands.
Years went by, and new technologies entered the picture. Prices continued 
to plummet, and more and more video professionals switched to editing on 
desktop computers. This switch created a growing market of users — and 
new competition for software manufacturers to produce programs like Adobe 
Premiere, Apple Final Cut Pro, Avid Xpress, and Pinnacle Edition, all of which 
cater to professional-consumer (or prosumer) users. 
Meanwhile, consumer video hobbyists started editing their own movies too, 
using low-cost (or even no-cost) programs like Apple iMovie, Pinnacle Studio, 
and Windows Movie Maker. These programs, combined with high-quality, 
affordable digital camcorders, turned the rarified moviemaking profession 
into a hobby enjoyed by millions of people.
Adobe kept updating Premiere over the years, and when the name changed 
to Adobe Premiere Pro in 2003, it was only a matter of time before they also 
released a more affordable non-Pro version. Adobe Premiere Elements was 
that version. Premiere was a pioneer in desktop video editing, and Adobe’s 
many years of experience showed in the high quality of Premiere Elements. 
The latest versions of Premiere Elements support modern high-definition 
camcorders, including those that use tapes, hard drives, DVDs, or flash 
memory for video storage. 
Now that there are two versions of Adobe Premiere — Pro and Elements — 
you must decide which version is for you. When I spoke with one of Adobe’s 
marketing people during the development of the first version of Premiere 
Elements, he suggested that the difference boils down to this: If you are get-
ting paid to edit video, you should use Premiere Pro. If you’re editing video 
for fun, use Premiere Elements. 
This viewpoint seems simplistic to me for two reasons. First, even a video 
hobbyist can appreciate some of the extra features in Premiere Pro. But 
second, and more important, Adobe Premiere Elements is so powerful that 
you probably can use it to make movies that others would buy. In fact, I have 
actually used Premiere Elements for paid, professional video-editing projects.

Premiere Elements 8 For Dummies 
Ultimately, the choice of whether to buy Adobe Premiere Pro or Premiere 
Elements boils down to price. Adobe offers Premiere Elements at a remark-
ably low retail price of under $100 in the United States, and Premiere Pro 
costs about $700 more. Although Premiere Pro does offer some extra fea-
tures, it is not seven times better than Premiere Elements. 
Adobe Premiere Elements allows you to get serious about your video-editing 
hobby without having to spend serious money. When it comes to video-
editing programs, Premiere Elements truly gives you more for less.
Why This Book?
Despite the low price, Adobe Premiere Elements is an advanced program. 
Premiere Elements 8 For Dummies is an advanced reference to this program, 
but like Premiere Elements itself, this book doesn’t come with an advanced 
price tag. I realize that you want to get right to work with Premiere Elements, 
so I wrote this book to provide easy-to-follow instructions, as well as real-
world tips and tricks to help you work smarter and better.
Needless to say, you’re no “dummy” — otherwise, you wouldn’t be reading 
this book and trying to figure out how to use Adobe Premiere Elements cor-
rectly. Video editing is fun, and my hope is that you’ll find this book fun to 
use as well. I include instructions on performing the most important video-
editing tasks — along with lots of graphics so that you can better visualize 
what I’m talking about. You’ll also find tips and ideas that you just won’t find 
in the dry, cryptic help files that Adobe delivers with the program.
Premiere Elements 8 For Dummies doesn’t just help you use the Premiere 
Elements program. If you’re new to moviemaking, you’ll find that this book 
helps you choose a good camcorder, shoot better video, publish movies 
online, and speak the industry techno babble like a Hollywood pro.
Foolish Assumptions
I hope you don’t mind, but I made a few basic assumptions about you while 
writing this book. First, I assume that you have an intermediate knowledge of 
computers and the Windows operating system, and that you are ready, will-
ing, and able to take on the challenge of movie editing. 
Because you’re an intermediate user, I assume that you know how to locate 
and move files around on hard drives, open and close programs, and perform 
other such tasks. I also assume that you have Windows XP or later, because 
that’s a system requirement for the Adobe Premiere Elements software. 

3
 Introduction
 
Early versions of Adobe Premiere were developed mainly for Apple Macintosh 
PCs, and the latest versions of Premiere Pro are available for Windows or Mac. 
Unfortunately, Premiere Elements is still a Windows-only program as of this 
writing. 
Another basic assumption I’ve made is that you might not be an experienced 
video editor (not yet, anyway). I explain the fundamentals of video editing 
in ways that help you immediately get to work on your movie projects. Most 
of the coverage in this book assumes that you’re producing movies as a 
hobby or a student. You may even be testing the waters of professional video 
editing by doing wedding videos and such, but you can’t yet afford a profes-
sional-grade program like Premiere Pro. Your video projects might include 
vacation travelogues, birthday parties, or even amateur fictional movie 
productions.
Conventions Used in This Book
Premiere Elements 8 For Dummies helps you get started with Premiere 
Elements quickly and efficiently. The book serves as a reference to this pro-
gram, and because Premiere Elements is a computer program, you’ll find this 
book a bit different from other kinds of texts you have read. The following are 
some unusual conventions that you encounter in this book:
 
✓ Filenames or lines of computer code will look like THIS or this. This 
style of print usually indicates something you should type in exactly as 
you see it in the book.
 
 The display format for the timecode (the unit for measuring time 
in video) is hours;minutes;seconds;frames. The timecode 
01;33;20;03 represents 1 hour, 33 minutes, 20 seconds, and 4 frames 
(the frame count begins with 0).
 
✓ Internet addresses will look something like this: www.dummies.com. 
Notice that I’ve left the http:// part off the address because you 
almost never have to type that into your Web browser.
 
✓ You will often be instructed to access commands from the menu bar 
in Premiere Elements and other programs. The menu bar is that strip 
that lives along the top of the Premiere Elements program window and 
usually includes menus called File, Edit, Project, Clip, Timeline, Marker, 
Title, Window, and Help. If (for example) I tell you to access the Save 
command in the File menu, I use arrows that look like this: Choose 
File➪Save.
 
✓ You’ll use your mouse a lot. Sometimes you have to click something 
to select it. This means that you should click once with the left mouse 
button after you put the mouse pointer over whatever it is you’re sup-
posed to click. I specify when you have to double-click or right-click 
(that is, click once with the right mouse button).

4
Premiere Elements 8 For Dummies 
 
✓ Another mouse-related task you often have to perform is the classic 
click-and-drag. For example, I often ask you to click-and-drag a video 
clip from one window to another. To click-and-drag an item, hover the 
mouse pointer over the item and then hold down the left mouse button. 
While holding down the button, move the mouse pointer to a new loca-
tion. Release the mouse button to drop the item on the new location.
How This Book Is Organized
I took all the chapters of Premiere Elements 8 For Dummies and put them in 
a bucket. I stirred that bucket with a stick and then poured the chapters out 
on the floor. This was how I decided which order to place things in, and I 
think that it has yielded a book which is pretty well organized. The chapters 
of Premiere Elements 8 For Dummies are divided into five major parts, plus an 
appendix. The parts are described in the next sections.
Part I: Laying the Groundwork
Adobe Premiere Elements is an advanced program, and if you’re new to video 
editing, many parts of this program may seem unfamiliar. Part I helps you 
get started with your moviemaking adventure by introducing you to Adobe 
Premiere Elements. You begin by touring the Premiere Elements program and 
getting familiar with its tools and basic features. If you’ve never edited 
a movie before, Chapter 1 gets you started right away on your first movie 
project — you can complete it from start to finish in the first chapter. 
Because Premiere Elements is just one of many tools that you use to make 
movies, I spend time helping you prepare your production studio. I also 
show you how to prepare Premiere Elements for use with a variety of media 
formats. Chapter 3 introduces you to the fundamentals of video technology, 
which you’ll need to be familiar with as you create your movies. Chapter 4 
shows you how to start new movie projects in Premiere Elements. The last 
chapter in Part I shows you how to capture video from a digital camcorder 
onto your computer, and I show you how to import and manage other kinds 
of media as well.
Part II: Editing Video and Sound
After you’re comfortable with Adobe Premiere Elements, you are ready to 
get right to work. Chapters 6 and 7 take you through the most common and 
important video-editing tasks, and in Chapter 8, I show you how to work with 
audio and add just the right soundtrack to your movies. 

5
 Introduction
Part III: Special Touches and 
Advanced Techniques
Adobe Premiere Elements is far more advanced than any other program in its 
price range. The chapters in Part III show you how to use the more advanced 
features that come with the software. I show you how to add graceful transi-
tions between clips, improve colors and lighting in video images, create com-
positing effects with blue screens, create and customize special effects, and 
add titles in your movies. 
Part IV: Finishing and Sharing 
Your Movies
Moviemaking is a highly expressive art form. The chapters in Part IV show 
you how to share your artistic expression. First, I show you how to put the 
finishing touches on your movie projects and make sure that they’re ready to 
share with others. Next, I show you how to share your movies on YouTube 
and the Internet, and I show how to burn your movies to DVD or Blu-Ray disc.
Part V: The Part of Tens
I wouldn’t be able to call this a For Dummies book without a “Part of Tens” 
(really, it’s in my contract). Actually, the Part of Tens always serves an 
important purpose. In Premiere Elements 8 For Dummies, this part gives me a 
chance to show you ten advanced video-editing techniques that you can use 
in Premiere Elements, ten moviemaking tips and secrets used by the pros, 
and ten gadgets and programs that will help you make better movies.
Appendix
Video editing is a technical subject with a language all its own, so at the end 
of Part V, I’ve provided a glossary to help you quickly decrypt the alphabet 
soup of video-editing terms and acronyms.

Premiere Elements 8 For Dummies 
Icons Used in This Book
You’ll see some icons in the margins of this book. The text next to these 
icons includes information and tips that deserve special attention and some 
of them may warn you of potential hazards and pitfalls you may encounter. 
Icons you’ll find in this book are easy to spot:
 
Although every word of Premiere Elements 8 For Dummies is important, I some-
times feel the need to emphasize certain points. I use Remember to occasion-
ally provide this emphasis.
 
Tips are usually brief instructions or ideas that aren’t always documented but 
can greatly improve your movies and make your life easier. Tips are among 
the most valuable tidbits in this book.
 
Heed warnings carefully. Some warn of situations that can merely inconve-
nience you; others tell you when a wrong move could cause expensive and 
painful damage to your equipment and/or person.
 
Computer books are often stuffed with yards of techno babble, and if it’s 
sprinkled everywhere, it can make the whole book a drag, and just plain dif-
ficult to read. As much as possible, I’ve tried to pull the deeply technical stuff 
out into these icons. This way, the information is easy to find if you need it, 
and just as easy to skip if you already have a headache.
Where to Go from Here
If you’ve always wanted to be in pictures, this is your time. Video editing 
is the hot topic in computer technology today, and you’re at the forefront 
of this multimedia revolution. If you still need to set up your movie studio 
or need equipment, I suggest that you start off with Chapter 2. If you aren’t 
quite ready to start editing yet, you may want to spend some time in Chapter 
3, which offers an introduction to moviemaking. Otherwise, you should go 
ahead and familiarize yourself with Adobe Premiere Elements, beginning with 
Chapter 1.

Part I

Groundwork

In this part . . .
D
igital video and editing programs have been around 
for a few years now, and the high-def camcorders, 
powerful PCs, and great programs like Adobe Premiere 
Elements have never been more affordable.
This part of Premiere Elements 8 For Dummies begins your 
moviemaking adventure by exploring Adobe Premiere 
Elements and finding out just what this program can do. It 
also looks at what’s needed for your personal video pro-
duction studio and helps you configure Premiere 
Elements do help you with your moviemaking magic.

Premiere Elements
In This Chapter
▶ Introducing Adobe Premiere Elements
▶ Taking the grand tour
▶ Making your first movie
H
ome movies have been around for more than half a century. But until 
recently there wasn’t much you could do with home movies except 
pop a tape in your VCR (or feed film into your projector) and watch raw, 
unedited footage. Movie editing was reserved for elite professionals with 
access to expensive studio hardware. But a revolution has taken place in 
recent years, a revolution that is putting the moviemaking arts within reach 
of almost anyone. The revolution has occurred in three phases:
 
1. Mega-powerful computers with huge hard drives have become both 
available and downright affordable. This has changed the rules of video 
editing, because almost any modern PC can edit video.
 
2. Affordable digital camcorders came onto the market, making it easy for 
anyone to collect high-quality video. New high definition (HD) camcord-
ers deliver video quality that even the pros could only dream about just 
a few years ago. 
 
3. High-end video-editing programs like Adobe Premiere Pro and Apple 
Final Cut Pro brought pro-caliber video editing to desktop computers, 
and simpler programs like Apple iMovie and Windows Movie Maker 
made editing software affordable. 
I hesitate to call Adobe Premiere Elements the next step in the video-editing 
revolution, but it’s definitely a step forward. Premiere Elements delivers 
about 90 percent of the power of high-end programs like Adobe Premiere 
Pro for a retail price of less than $100. Since its first release in 2004, Premiere 
Elements has been the value leader in video editing. 
This chapter introduces you to Adobe Premiere Elements by showing you 
what this program is designed to do and what it has to offer. You get a tour

of Premiere Elements to help you find your way around this feature-packed 
program; I even guide you through your first movie project!
What Is Adobe Premiere Elements?
You already know that Adobe Premiere Elements is a video-editing program. 
But what does that mean? It means that using Adobe Premiere Elements, you 
can quickly take video from your digital camcorder, delete and rearrange 
scenes, add special effects and credits, and then export your movie to a DVD 
or the Internet. 
You can find lots of video-editing programs on the market, even at the $100 
price point of Adobe Premiere Elements. But several important features set 
Premiere Elements apart from the others:
 
✓ Easily import video from almost any digital camcorder, including the 
latest high-def cameras. 
 
✓ Automatically enhance the picture and sound quality of your movies, or 
fine-tune the quality by using pro-style editing tools.
 
✓ Analyze video to detect and identify shaky or blurry images. Smart 
Tagging offers face detection, motion tracking, and other content 
recognition.
 
✓ Use up to 99 separate video tracks for advanced edits and compositing. 
Find out about compositing video tracks in Chapter 11.
 
✓ Add and edit up to 99 audio tracks to your program. Use SmartMix to 
automatically adjust the volume of soundtrack music to better comple-
ment narration and other audio tracks. 
 
✓ Create advanced, professional-style titles and add still graphics to your 
movie projects. Then you can animate these titles and graphics.
 
✓ Apply effects and transitions, which can be used in any video track.
 
✓ Add royalty-free background music by using SmartSound.
 
✓ Preview edits immediately, in real time, without having to render effects 
first. (Rendering is a time-consuming finalization process.)
 
✓ Upload movies directly to YouTube, or export them in Web-friendly 
formats like Flash, QuickTime, and Windows Media.
 
✓ Create interactive DVD menus and burn your movies to DVD or Blu-Ray.
 
✓ Integrate Premiere Elements with Adobe Photoshop Elements to quickly 
burn your still-image collections onto slideshow DVDs.
Even these hefty capabilities are only a smattering of what you can do with 
Premiere Elements. It’s one of the most versatile programs you’ll ever use.

 Chapter 1: Feeling at Home with Premiere Elements
Taking the Grand Tour
Adobe developed Premiere Elements on the foundations of Premiere Pro, 
and one of their primary design goals was to make Premiere Elements much 
easier to use, especially if you don’t have any experience with video-editing 
programs. Still, even though the user interface has been simplified, I wouldn’t 
call Premiere Elements a “dumbed-down” version of Premiere Pro. Little has 
been left out — you are probably going to have more options than you need. 
And the quality of the tools is great; the basic aspects of a high-quality video-
editing program are all there. In short, I think that video newbies and veter-
ans alike will feel right at home with Premiere Elements.
Launching Premiere Elements 
for the first time
When you first launch Premiere Elements, you see the welcome screen 
shown in Figure 1-1. To launch Premiere Elements and get started, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Start button to open the Start menu, and choose All 
Programs➪Adobe Premiere Elements.
 
 Most of the welcome screen is dedicated to advertising Photoshop.com 
membership (Photoshop.com is an online photo and video hosting site 
offered by Adobe; visit Chapter 15 for more about this service). 
Where’s the Mac?
As this book goes to press, Premiere Elements 
is compatible only with computers running 
Windows XP or later. If you have a Macintosh, 
you might consider running Premiere Elements 
on your Mac by setting up your Mac to dual-boot 
in either Windows or the Mac OS. Boot up your 
Mac using Windows, and then install and use 
Premiere Elements just like you would on any 
compatible Windows PC. Apple’s Boot Camp 
helps you configure your Mac for dual-booting. 
For help, Switching to a Mac For Dummies, 2nd 
Edition, by Arnold Reinhold, guides new Mac 
users with Windows-only programs in the art 
of running those programs on a newer Mac.
In any case, Premiere Elements will abso-
lutely not run on an older Mac with a PowerPC 
processor. Premiere Elements must be run on 
a processor that supports the SSE2 instruc-
tion set. The Intel processors in current Macs 
support SSE2, but older PowerPC processors 
do not.

2. If you have a membership, use the log-on box in the lower-left corner 
of the screen to sign in to Photoshop.com. Otherwise, just ignore the 
log-on box for now. 
 
 On the left side of the welcome screen are three important buttons:
 
• Organize: Click this to launch a handy tool for organizing your 
media. I describe the Elements Organizer in Chapter 5.
 
• Open Project: Click here to open a previously created project. 
 
• New Project: You’ve probably already figured out that this is 
where you click to start a new project. 
 
3. Go ahead and click New Project to start a new project and continue 
your tour of Premiere Elements. Enter a project name in the dialog 
box shown in Figure 1-2; any name will work for now. Click OK to 
open the Premiere Elements workspace.

 Although the exact appearance varies, you see at least the three funda-
mental panes that make up the Premiere Elements interface — the Task 
pane, the Timeline/Sceneline, and the Monitor, as shown in Figure 1-3. 
These panes are explained in greater detail in the following sections.

The exact appearance of your workspace depends upon the current screen 
resolution setting on your computer, but the basic appearance should resem-
ble Figure 1-3. 
Getting to know the Task pane
The upper-right section of the Premiere Elements screen is called the Task 
pane. It’s called the Task pane because you’ll use this area for almost every 
moviemaking task in Premiere Elements. Tasks are organized into tabs along 
the top of the Task pane. When you click a tab, a row of buttons appears 
showing subtasks (see Figure 1-4). Click one of these buttons to view a list of 
related tasks. The tabs on the Task pane are:
 
✓ Organize: This tab is a good place to start. Here you can get media from 
your camcorder, import files on your hard drive, organize media files, 
and review files that are used in your current project. 

14
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
 
✓ Edit: When it’s time to perform video edits, this tab is where you find 
tools to add transitions, titles, special effects, themes, and more.
 
✓ Disc Menus: If you plan to share your movies on disc, navigation menus 
should be an important part of your project. This tab is where you 
design and modify disc menus. 
 
✓ Share: If you want to share your movies on YouTube, DVD, Blu-Ray, 
iPod, videotape, or various other digital formats, use this tab. Premiere 
Elements supports almost any means of sharing video except carrier 
pigeon and telepathy.

Trying out Sceneline and Timeline
The heart and soul of Premiere Elements is the strip along the bottom half of 
the screen. This area is called the Sceneline or Timeline, depending on your 
view mode. Use the buttons in the upper-left corner of the window to switch 
between the Sceneline and Timeline. Each one is useful for different tasks: 
 
✓ Sceneline: This mode offers a simplified view of your project and is a 
good place to start working. Simply drag and drop clips from Organizer 
into Sceneline to put scenes in the order you want them. You can also 
quickly add transitions and soundtrack music in Sceneline. I show you 
how to use Sceneline later in this chapter. 

15
 Chapter 1: Feeling at Home with Premiere Elements
 
✓ Timeline: When you’re ready to spend a little more time fine-tuning 
your project, switch over to Timeline. Timeline allows you to add titles, 
trim unwanted portions of clips, add special effects, and make other 
advanced adjustments. Most of the tasks in this book use Timeline 
rather than Sceneline.
Timeline is shown in Figure 1-5. I can’t completely explain Timeline here. That 
could fill a chapter all by itself. (In fact, it does — Chapter 7.) However, I do 
want you to know that by using Timeline, you can
 
✓ Figure out where you are in the project by using the Timeline ruler.
 
✓ Use the Current Time Indicator (CTI) to set the current playback and 
editing location in Timeline.
 
✓ Control aspects of a clip directly. For example, you can change the 
timing of video effects or adjust audio levels. (Chapter 8 shows you how 
to work with audio; flip to Chapter 12 for more on working with effects.)
 
✓ Use the Zoom control to zoom your view of Timeline in and out.
 
✓ Move clips by simply dragging and dropping them to new locations in 
Timeline. If your clip calls for effects and transitions, you can add them 
by dragging them to Timeline as well.

Monitoring the Monitor
Imagine trying to edit video without being able to look at it. Would it be pos-
sible? Perhaps. Beethoven did compose his epic “Ninth Symphony” while 
completely deaf. But most of us aren’t Beethovens and we need to directly 
experience our work. Thankfully, Premiere Elements makes sure that you can 
always see exactly what your movie looks like as you work on it. Monitor is 
where you 

16
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
 
✓ Play through clips after you add them to Sceneline or Timeline. As you 
play each clip, you decide which portions to keep in the movie by set-
ting In points and Out points. When you set In and Out points, only the 
portions of the clip between those two points remain in your movie. 
 
✓ Play through your edits to view transitions and effects in real time.
As shown in Figure 1-6, Monitor has standard playback controls like Play, 
Rewind, and Fast Forward. It also has specialized playback controls, which I 
show you how to use in Chapter 6.

Commanding the interface
 
Adobe Premiere Elements is fairly advanced and has some unique interface 
features that can confuse even experienced computer users at first. Here are 
some helpful tips for using Premiere Elements more effectively:
 
✓ Find your missing Taskbar: If you have set up Windows to auto-hide the 
Taskbar (the bar at the bottom of the screen with the Start button and 
clock), you’ll find that it doesn’t want to reappear when you’re working 
in Premiere Elements. If you run into this problem, reveal the Taskbar 
either by pressing the Windows key on your keyboard (this opens the 
Start menu), or press Alt+Tab to switch to another program. 
 
✓ Resize windows: As shown in Figure 1-3, the Premiere Elements pro-
gram screen is divided into three main parts: the Monitor, the Task 
pane, and the Sceneline/Timeline. To resize any of these parts, simply 
click-and-drag the border between the parts. For example, if you need to 
see more of the Timeline, click-and-drag its top border up to expand the 
Timeline and shrink the Task pane and Monitor. 

17
 Chapter 1: Feeling at Home with Premiere Elements
 
 Choose Window➪Restore Workspace to quickly reset all the borders 
back to their default positions. 
 
✓ Use the Window menu: If you ever have a hard time finding a certain 
program window (“How do I open the Narration tool again?”), open the 
Window menu on the Premiere Elements menu bar. The Window menu 
gives you quick access to all windows and tools in Premiere Elements. 
Making Your First Movie
Sometimes the best way to get to know a program is to just dig in and get 
your hands dirty with it, actually putting its features to use as the designers 
intended. If you have a digital camcorder handy with video already recorded, 
and you have installed Adobe Premiere Elements on your computer, you’re 
ready to start making movies. 
 
If you’ve never used Premiere Elements or even edited a movie on your com-
puter, the following sections should serve as a good introduction.
Starting your first project
Your first step in making a movie is perhaps the most obvious one. Launch 
Premiere Elements, and when the welcome screen appears (refer to Figure 
1-1) click New Project. Enter a name for your project in the New Project 
dialog box — any old name will do, as long as it’s something you will remem-
ber later — and click OK. Premiere Elements creates your project and opens 
to the basic Premiere Elements screen. Wasn’t that easy?
 
Premiere Elements works with both standard and high-definition digital cam-
corders. When you create a new project, you should choose project settings 
that match the format used by your camcorder. See Chapter 4 for more on 
changing project settings. 
Capturing video
After you’ve created a new project in Premiere Elements, you need some 
source footage to work with. For now I assume that you have a digital cam-
corder and you’ve already recorded video that you want to edit. The process 
of getting video from the camcorder into your computer is called capturing. 
To capture video, follow these steps:
 
1. Connect your digital camcorder to your computer.

18
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
 
 You should use either a FireWire (IEEE-1394) or USB 2.0 port. If you’re 
not sure which one to use, see Chapter 2 as well as your camcorder’s 
documentation. Premiere Elements can capture video from almost any 
digital camcorder or camera. 
 
2. Turn the camcorder on to Play mode.
 
 If Windows automatically opens a window stating that a digital video 
device was detected, click Cancel to close the window.
 
3. Click the Organize tab in Premiere Elements, and then click Get Media.
 
 A list of device types appears.
 
4. Click the button that most closely matches your camera. 
 
 If you have a hard drive–based high-definition camcorder, for example, 
click the AVCHD option. (See Chapter 2 for more on different types of 
camcorders.) The window you see next will vary depending on the type 
of device you have. If you have a DV or HDV tape-based camcorder, you’ll 
see a Capture window that looks a lot like the Premiere Elements Monitor 
window. If you have a DVD, hard drive, or memory card-based camcorder, 
you see a Media Downloader window like the one shown in Figure 1-7. 
 
 For the sake of simplicity, I’m going to assume for now that you are cap-
turing from a DVD, hard drive, or memory card-based camcorder. See 
Chapter 5 for complete instructions on capturing video from tape-based 
camcorders and other devices. 
 
Figure 1-7: 
The Media 
Downloader

certain 
types of 
camcorders.
 

19
 Chapter 1: Feeling at Home with Premiere Elements
 
5. Select your camera in the Get Media From menu. 
 
 If your camera doesn’t appear in the Get Media From menu, make sure that 
the camera’s power is turned on and that you clicked the correct type of 
device in Step 4. After powering the camera on, choose Refresh List. 
 
6. Accept the default location and file naming options for now, and click 
Get Media. 
 
 A dialog box appears, showing you the copying status for the video files. 
If you want to fiddle with the filenames or saving location, pay a visit to 
Chapter 5. 
You now see a collection of video clips in the Organizer window, as shown in 
Figure 1-8. These are the video clips that you captured from the camera, and 
they are ready to be used in a movie project.
 
Figure 1-8: 
Captured 
video clips 
show up in 
the Media 
window.
 
Assembling the movie
After you’ve captured some video, turning your footage into a movie is easy. 
(Of course, I’m skipping the fancy stuff that you can do, using later chapters 
in this book.) Follow these steps:
 
1. On the Organize tab, click the Project button. 
 
 Your video clips are listed on the right side of the Premiere Elements 
screen. If Premiere Elements imported all your video as one gigantic 
video clip, picking and choosing scenes won’t be easy. Use Premiere’s 
Scene Detect feature, which I describe in Chapter 5.

20
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
 
2. To preview a clip, double-click it.
 
 The clip opens in a Preview window. Click Play to start playing the clip, 
and click the Close (X) button to close the Preview window when you’re 
done.
 
3. Click Sceneline to reveal the Sceneline, as shown in Figure 1-9.
 
4. Click-and-drag some clips and drop them on the Sceneline, as shown 
in Figure 1-9.
 
 The order in which clips are placed in the Sceneline is the order 
in which they will play in your finished movie. You can insert clips 
between clips that are already in the Sceneline. To remove a clip, click it 
once to select it and press Delete on your keyboard.
 
5. Click Play in the Monitor window to preview the movie you have put 
together in the Sceneline.

output your raw clips as-is, but the movie will lack panache. How do you 
make a stylish movie without spending a lot of time and energy on editing? 
InstantMovie to the rescue! Premiere Elements includes a cool feature called 
InstantMovie that automatically applies some predefined transitions, titles, 
background music, and other effects that enhance and stylize your movie. To 
apply an InstantMovie theme, follow these steps: 
 
1. Click the Edit tab, and then click the Themes button. 
 
2. Scroll through the list of themes, shown in Figure 1-10, and click a 
theme to play a small preview of it.
 
 If you don’t see any themes in the list, they might not be installed on 
your computer. If you have a Premiere Elements installation disc, use 
the setup program on that disc to install themes. If you purchased a 
download version of Premiere Elements, visit www.adobe.com and click 
the “Your Account” link near the top of the screen to log on and down-
load Premiere Elements Content files.

preview it.
 
 
3. Click a theme to select it, and then click Next in the lower-right corner 
of the Organizer. 
 
4. Enter Opening and Closing titles, as shown in Figure 1-11. 
 
 The opening title appears at the beginning of the movie and should be a 
short, general title. The closing title usually contains ending credits.

5. Click the arrow next to Music, and choose what kind of background 
music you want:
 
• Theme Music: This option automatically generates some royalty-
free background music with the SmartSound tool. 
 
• My Music: Select this option and click Browse if you have a spe-
cific song that you want to use. 
 
• No Music: If you don’t want any background music, choose this 
option.
 
6. Adjust the slider to decide whether the music or the regular clip audio 
should be louder. 
 
 Moving the slider closer to My Clips (shown in Figure 1-11) makes the back-
ground music softer so that viewers can hear the movie clip’s audio better.
 
7. Click the arrow next to Duration and decide whether the movie 
should be adjusted to match your music, to last a certain duration, or 
to simply use all video clips. 
 
8. Click the arrow next to Theme Content and decide which parts of the 
theme you want to use. 
 
 For example, if you applied your own special effects to clips and you 
don’t want the theme’s effects to replace your own, remove the check 
mark next to Replace Existing Effects. 
 
9. When you’re done making adjustments, click Apply. 
 
 You may be asked to confirm a couple of the changes that InstantMovie 
will make. Accept those changes and let InstantMovie work its magic.

When it’s done, click Play in the Monitor window to see your finished 
InstantMovie. 
Uploading your movie to YouTube
After you’ve put together a basic movie in Sceneline and made some edits (or 
applied an InstantMovie theme), Premiere Elements helps you quickly upload 
your finished movie to YouTube. YouTube is the Internet’s most popular 
video-sharing site, and Adobe has partnered with YouTube to make sharing 
your movies simple. Best of all, you don’t have to worry about converting your 
movie to any special format because Premiere Elements and YouTube take 
care of that conversion for you. To upload your movie, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Share tab, and then click Online under the sharing options.
 
2. In the screen that appears, shown in Figure 1-12, choose YouTube. 
 
 Note the size and duration of your movie listed next to File Size/
Duration. The maximum size and time limit allowed by YouTube is listed 
underneath. If your movie exceeds these maximums, you’ll either need 
to shorten it or upload it in chunks. See Chapter 15 for steps to output 
only certain portions of your finished movie. 
 
3. Click Next.
 
4. In the next screen that appears, enter your YouTube user name and 
password to log on to YouTube. 
 
 If you don’t have a YouTube account, click the Sign Up Now link and 
follow the instructions on YouTube’s Web site to create an account. 
 
5. Enter a Title and Description for your movie.
 
 The title and description are mandatory when uploading to YouTube. 
The Tags and Category fields are also mandatory, but you can just 
accept the default choices there for now. 
 
6. Click Next. 
 
7. Choose whether you want to publicly share your movie, and then 
click Share. 
Your movie is automatically rendered and uploaded to YouTube. Needless 
to say, you need an active Internet connection to complete the upload, and 
the upload time varies depending on your movie size and Internet connec-
tion speed. When the upload is finished, a message appears saying, “Share 
Complete!” On the screen, click the link to view your movie on YouTube, as 
shown in Figure 1-13. You can also click a link to e-mail your movie’s link to 
friends and family.

I
f you want to make great movies today, there are two things you abso-
lutely need: A camcorder and a computer. A good camcorder helps you 
shoot high-quality video footage, and a computer helps you turn that foot-
age into a movie worth watching. And when you’re done making your movie, 
you’ll also need your computer to share the movie on DVD or the Internet. 
When I wrote the first edition of this book a few years ago, making camcorder 
recommendations was easy: My best recommendation was a digital cam-
corder using MiniDV tapes. The hard part came when it was time to recom-
mend a computer, because back then a lot of PCs still couldn’t handle video 
editing. 
Today the situation is reversed. Video-friendly PCs are cheap and widely 
available, but selecting the right camcorder can be a confusing task. Do you 
need standard- or high-def video resolution? Should you choose a camera 
that records to tape, DVD, flash memory, or a hard drive? What are all these 
crazy technical terms like AVCHD and IEEE-1394, and why should you care? 
This chapter guides you through the daunting process of selecting a good 
camcorder. I also help you pick a good computer for video work (some 
choices are still better than others), and I show you some other useful things 
like USB hard drives and Blu-Ray disc burners.

26
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Choosing a Computer for Video Editing
Your computer probably spends most of its time sending e-mail, playing 
music, storing photos, and browsing the Internet. If your computer seems 
bored by this stuff, maybe it needs a more challenging assignment. Enter 
video editing! Nothing exercises your PC’s processor, memory, and hard 
drive quite as intensively as video editing. The next couple of sections walk 
you through what you must have and what would be nice to have if your 
budget allows. 
Stuff you need
If you’ve already purchased Adobe Premiere Elements, you can check the 
side of the box for the minimum system requirements. Rather than reprint 
the minimum system requirements for running Premiere Elements, I’m going 
to list the features that you truly want in a video-editing PC. At the very least 
you want a computer with:
 
✓ Windows XP, Vista, or 7: Sorry Mac users, but Premiere Elements is 
Windows-only.
 
✓ 3 GHz+ processor: You can get away with a 1.7 GHz or faster processor 
if you work only with standard-def video, but for working with high-
definition video and Blu-Ray, you need a 3 GHz or better processor.
 
 Processor speeds much above 4 GHz are less practical for personal 
computers because they consume a lot of electric power and produce 
too much heat. Multi-core processors, which combine two or more pro-
cessor cores on a single CPU (central processing unit), offer significant 
performance gains at lower GHz speeds so your computer can process 
video efficiently without turning into a thermonuclear space heater. 
 
✓ 3GB+ RAM: Lots of random access memory (RAM) is important, so get 
as much as you can afford. Windows XP users can probably get away 
with only 2GB of RAM because XP won’t hog up your graphics card the 
way Vista and 7 do; but no less than 2GB if you plan to work with high-
def video. 
 
✓ 300GB+ hard drive: Nothing gobbles hard drive space like digital video. 
As with RAM, get the biggest hard drive you can afford.
 
✓ FireWire (IEEE-1394) and USB 2.0 ports: Get a computer with both 
FireWire and USB 2.0 ports to ensure fast, easy video transfer from your 
camcorder to the hard drive.

27
 Chapter 2: Equipping Yourself for Moviemaking
 
✓ A good video card with dedicated video RAM: Many computers share 
some system RAM with the video card (also called graphics card or dis-
play adapter). If possible, choose a computer that has a good quality 
video card with at least 256MB of dedicated video RAM. The video card 
should also have a DVI port for better-quality connections to LCD moni-
tors and HDTVs.
 
✓ 19-inch (or bigger) LCD monitor: The Premiere Elements program 
window needs a lot of screen space. If your monitor is too small, you’ll 
have to squint to see the postage stamp–sized video picture.
 
✓ A DVD burner: If you want to share your movies on DVD, you’ll need a 
DVD burner. Most new computers come with DVD burners, but always 
double-check those specs just to be sure. 
Stuff you’d like
In the preceding section, I outline the features that your video-editing com-
puter really needs to perform the most basic video tasks. If your computer 
has all the features mentioned in the preceding section, you’ll be able to use 
Adobe Premiere Elements just fine. 
But what’s the fun in getting by with just the bare minimums? If you’re seri-
ous about editing video, you’ll want some serious tools for the job. The ideal 
video-editing computer has
Can I use a laptop?
Yes, you can edit video with a laptop, but I don’t 
recommend it.
You can buy some pretty-high-performance 
laptops these days, and there’s no denying the 
convenience of a powerful PC that fits in your 
backpack. Some high-end laptops are even 
touted as being multimedia powerhouses, with 
video-friendly features like FireWire ports and 
big hard drives.
But if you’re looking for the best possible video-
editing computer for your money, a laptop 
usually isn’t the top choice. Most portable 
computers have shortcomings, which make 
them less than ideal for video work. These 
shortcomings include smaller display screens, 
integrated video memory, and processors that 
are optimized for long battery life and heat dis-
sipation rather than performance. Most laptops 
also have slower 5400 RPM hard drives (most 
desktops have 7200 RPM drives) that can lead 
to performance problems when you try to cap-
ture or edit video. Generally speaking, desktops 
are both more affordable and better suited for 
video editing.

28
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
 
✓ A Blu-Ray burner: Want to share your videos in HD? The easiest way is 
to burn your movies onto high-definition Blu-Ray discs, and for that you 
need a Blu-Ray burner. Some new PCs come with Blu-Ray burners, or 
you can buy an aftermarket burner for under $300. Premiere Elements 
supports Blu-Ray burning; visit Chapter 16 to find out how.
 
✓ A dual-DVI 3D video card: Premiere Elements works best with a video 
card that has at least 512MB of dedicated video RAM, as well as support 
for Direct 3D and OpenGL 2.0 technologies. Choose a card that has mul-
tiple DVI outputs so that you can hook up multiple monitors. 
 
 Some video cards come with a breakout box that includes analog video 
outputs. These analog outputs may include S-Video, component, or com-
posite video connections. An analog video breakout box is really handy 
for video editing because you can easily connect a TV monitor to your 
computer. TV monitors give you a more color-accurate preview of how 
your video will look on a TV. 
 
✓ Dual monitors: If you have a video card with dual-DVI outputs, it makes 
sense to connect a separate monitor to each of those outputs. Placed 
side by side, these dual monitors behave like one giant desktop that 
basically doubles your digital workspace. The Premiere Elements pro-
gram window needs a lot of screen space and really benefits from dual-
monitor configurations. 
 
✓ A second hard drive dedicated to video: If your computer has only one 
hard drive, that drive needs to do a lot of multi-tasking as it runs the 
Windows operating system and Premiere Elements, while at the same 
time trying to feed up large audio and video files for editing. If you can 
move your video to a separate (but still internal) hard drive, the perfor-
mance and reliability of Premiere Elements will be greatly improved. For 
tips on media for storing video longer term, see “Storage options” later 
in this chapter.
 
 If you want the ultimate hard-drive performance, choose a system with 
multiple hard drives and RAID 0 support. RAID stands for Redundant 
Array of Inexpensive Disks, and basically makes two or more hard drives 
behave as one. A RAID 0 configuration (sometimes called a striped disk 
array) is recommended by Adobe when working with high-def video.
 
✓ A dedicated, offline computer: The pros edit video on dedicated work-
station computers with no extra software, no anti-virus software, and no 
connection to the Internet. Anti-virus software is crucial for any Web-
connected PC; unfortunately, security software and other utilities use up 
a lot of memory and processing power that could be dedicated to video 
editing. If you can afford it, keep one computer for Web browsing, e-mail, 
and other fun stuff, and dedicate another, better computer exclusively 
to video editing in Adobe Premiere Elements.

 Chapter 2: Equipping Yourself for Moviemaking
Comparing Video Cameras
Affordable digital camcorders first started to appear around the turn of the 
millennium. Although the consumer digital video market has had about a 
decade to mature, the product choices you face are as diverse and confusing 
as ever. First you have to choose between standard or high definition, and 
if you go with high-def, you have to consider the various HD image formats 
(720p, 1080i, and 1080p) and file formats (HDV, AVCHD, Blu-Ray, and others). 
Then you have to decide whether you want a camera that records your video 
onto tape, DVD, flash memory, or a hard drive. All these choices are enough 
to make your head spin! This section is your guide to the most important 
choices you need to make when you select a new camcorder. For an overview 
of video basics, such as how video cameras work or worldwide video broad-
cast standards, check out Chapter 4. 
 
Always check the price and availability of blank media before you buy any 
camcorder. If blanks are unavailable or too expensive, your camcorder could 
become virtually useless in a few years.
Surveying camera features
No single piece of gear is more precious to a budding videographer than a 
good video camera. Most modern video cameras are actually camcorders 
because they serve as both a camera and a recorder. Early video cameras 
used to connect to separate VCR units that were hung by a strap from the 
videographer’s shoulder. Bulky.
Whether you choose a standard- or high-def digital camcorder (I recommend 
high-def; see the next section “Defining high-def video” to see why), you 
should consider the following basic features on any camcorder:
 
✓ Image sensor: The part of the camera that actually picks up light and 
turns it into a video image is the image sensor. Modern camcorders use 
either a charged-coupled device (CCD) or a complementary metal-oxide 
semiconductor (CMOS) sensor instead. Both CCDs and CMOS chips offer 
similar quality and performance, so don’t worry about which one your 
camcorder has. Some more expensive cameras have three CCD or CMOS 
chips, one each for recording red, green, and blue light waves. So-called 
three-chip cameras cost upwards of $1,000 and record richer, more 
natural colors. Three-chip cameras are nice to have but not absolutely 
necessary for the amateur videographer. 
 
 As you shop for a camcorder, you may notice some three-chip, standard-
def camcorders that cost the same (or even less) than some single-chip 
HD camcorders. A high-def camera is the better choice because it offers 
more obvious quality gains and is less likely to be obsolete next year. 

30
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
 
✓ Audio: For better sound quality, the camcorder should have some 
provisions for connecting an external microphone. Most camcorders 
have a standard mini-jack connector for an external mic, and some high-
end camcorders have a 3-pin XLR connector. XLR connectors — also 
sometimes called balanced audio connectors — are used by many high-
quality microphones and PA (public address) systems. Alternatively, the 
camcorder’s manufacturer may offer custom microphones that use an 
accessory shoe on the camera. 
 
✓ Batteries: Make sure that spare batteries are readily available at a 
reasonable price. Buy plenty of extra batteries when you buy your 
camcorder. If you’ll be doing long “on location” shoots, also consider a 
battery charger that plugs into a car’s accessory power socket. 
 
✓ Digital Video connections: Most digital camcorders use either a 
FireWire or USB 2.0 port for capturing video from the camcorder onto 
your computer. FireWire is also called IEEE-1394 or i.Link by some 
camera manufacturers. Premiere Elements supports both FireWire and 
USB 2.0 capture, but make sure that your computer and camcorder have 
matching ports.
 
✓ Manual controls: Auto focus and automatic exposure controls are great, 
but as you get more serious about shooting video, you may want more 
control over these features. The easiest manual focus and exposure 
controls are ones that are manipulated by a ring around the lens body. 
Tiny little knobs or slider switches on the side of the camera are more 
difficult to use.
 
✓ Storage media: If the camera uses removable storage media such as 
MiniDV tapes, SD cards, or DVDs, make sure that extra media is afford-
able and widely available. 
 
✓ Filter threads: In Chapter 18, I recommend that you use lens filters to 
protect your camcorder’s lens and improve your video images. But you 
can’t easily use filters if your camcorder doesn’t have filter threads in a 
standard size such as 37mm or 52mm. Some of the cheapest camcorders 
cut costs by eliminating filter threads in front of the lens. 
 
✓ Zoom: You might see “400× ZOOM” splashed across the side of the 
camera. Such huge numbers usually express digital zoom, which is (in 
my opinion) virtually useless. Check the fine print next to the digital 
zoom figure and you should see a figure for optical zoom. Optical zoom 
is something you can actually use, and most mass-market digital cam-
corders offer around 10× to 25× optical zoom.
Defining high-def video
If you’re getting a camcorder, buy a high-definition camera if you can afford 
it. As the name implies, high-def cameras record more detailed images than 
standard-def cameras. Standard-definition cameras and TVs are quickly 

31
 Chapter 2: Equipping Yourself for Moviemaking
becoming obsolete. Buying a new standard-def camcorder makes sense only 
if your budget is tight and you plan only to share low-res videos on YouTube 
or other online places. Remember, you can always “downsample” HD video 
to standard definition, but you can’t turn standard-def video into HD. 
Now that you’ve decided to buy an HD camera, your choices are as clear as… 
mud. High-def camcorders come with several different formats and options 
to consider. Table 2-1 lists the common HD video resolution formats (see 
Chapter 4 for a more detailed explanation of resolution, frame rates, and 
scanning format).
Table 2-1 
HD Video Resolution Formats

25 or 30 fps
Interlaced
1080p
1440 x 1080 or 1920 x 
1080
25 or 30 fps
Progressive
 
Most HD camcorders allow you to choose between 720p and 1080i or 1080p 
recording. Although it’s tempting to always choose the higher 1080 resolu-
tions, if you’re recording a subject with a lot of fast-moving action — your 
kids’ soccer game, for example — the faster frame rate of 720p will capture the 
action with less blur. 
In addition to resolutions and frame rates, HD camcorders also record in a 
variety of file formats. The most common formats are
 
✓ AVCHD (Advanced Video Codec High Definition): This format is used 
on HD camcorders that record video to DVD, flash memory, or internal 
hard drives.
 
✓ HDV (High Definition Video): This format is used on HD camcorders 
that record video to MiniDV tapes. 
Both formats offer high recording quality, although HDV cameras are slightly 
better due to a higher level of compression than used on most AVCHD cam-
eras. And as of version 7 of Adobe Premiere Elements, both AVCHD and HDV 
formats are fully supported. 

32
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
 
Some HD camcorders offer a 24p “cinema” mode that records video at 24 fps 
(actually 23.976 fps in many cases) with progressive scanning. This frame rate 
is meant to mimic the motion characteristics of cinematic film, which shares 
the 24 fps frame rate. Adobe Premiere Elements can capture 24p video, but it’s 
converted to 30 fps during import. This means that cinema mode is of little 
use to you when using Premiere Elements. If you want to make cinema-style 
movies, step up to Adobe Premiere Pro, which fully supports 24p.
Considering tape-based camcorders
Until recently, most digital camcorders used the MiniDV tape format. MiniDV 
was (and is) a good choice because the tapes are affordable, reliable, long 
lasting, and widely supported by video-editing programs. HDV camcorders 
record high-def video onto MiniDV tapes, so it remains a current and viable 
technology. HDV cameras also usually offer slightly superior video qual-
ity compared to AVCHD cams, due to lower image compression. But many 
people don’t like having to rewind tapes, and tape-based camcorders tend to 
be a little bigger and bulkier.
Other digital tape formats have come and gone. MicroMV was a short-lived 
proprietary tape format offered by Sony. Sony also championed the Digital8 
format, which recorded digital video onto Hi-8 tapes. MicroMV camcorders 
are not compatible with Adobe Premiere Elements, but Digital8 cameras are 
compatible. 
As of this writing, most tape-based consumer camcorders use MiniDV tapes. 
Tape-based HDV camcorders record high-definition video onto the same 
MiniDV tapes used by standard-def digital camcorders. These HDV camcord-
ers are a good choice, but they are no longer the only choice for serious 
videographers. 
 
Some professional-grade camcorders use proprietary tape formats such as 
Panasonic’s DVCPRO HD and Sony’s XDCAM. HDV is supported by Adobe 
Premiere Elements, but DVCPRO HD and XDCAM aren’t.
Reviewing disc-based camcorders
Some camcorders record video into standard or mini (3-inch diameter) 
recordable DVDs. On the surface this seems like a good idea because every-
one has a DVD player, right? 
Unfortunately, this is a case where reality doesn’t necessarily match up with 
perception. Before you can play a DVD recorded by your camcorder in a reg-
ular DVD player, you have to finalize the disc in the camcorder. Finalization is 
a long and sometimes confusing process, and after a disc is finalized, you can 

33
 Chapter 2: Equipping Yourself for Moviemaking
never record more video onto it. Furthermore, 3-inch mini DVDs can only be 
used in your computer if you have a tray-loading DVD drive; mini DVDs aren’t 
compatible with slot-loading drives. I’ve helped enough people through the 
frustration of trying to use DVD-based camcorders that I can safely say con-
venience is not an advantage of this format.
That’s not to say that DVD-based camcorders don’t have advantages. Blank 
recordable DVDs are cheap, and newer versions of Premiere Elements sup-
port most disc-based camcorders. Table 2-2 describes the features of the 
three most common types of disc-based camcorders currently available.

Most high-def camcorders that record to DVDs use the AVCHD format. This 
format is supported by Adobe Premiere Elements, but it isn’t supported by 
most DVD players. Even if you finalize a disc in your AVCHD camcorder, it 
probably won’t play in standard-definition or Blu-Ray DVD players. Some 
Blu-Ray camcorders are available, but Premiere Elements can’t import video 
directly from these cameras. 
Selecting hard drive and flash 
memory camcorders
Many new camcorders eschew video tapes and discs in favor of other storage 
methods. Digital video is really just data, so camcorder makers are increas-
ingly turning to storage media traditionally associated with computers and 
other digital devices like MP3 players and still-photo cameras. Table 2-3 lists 
some of these formats, along with their pros and cons. 
Many AVCHD cameras tout “Full HD” capability and a maximum resolution of 
1920 x 1080. In theory this resolution seems superior to HDV’s maximum res-
olution of 1440 x 1080, but in practice AVCHD cameras use aggressive image 
compression that yields marginally inferior image quality compared to HDV.

Some camcorders offer a combination of internal memory and removable flash

camcorders that use the AVCHD file format. 
Selecting Gear for Video Capture, 
Storage, and Sharing
So you have a fantabulous new computer that is ready to edit video at blaz-
ing speeds. And you have a brand-spanking-new high-def camcorder ready 
to shoot amazing footage. Don’t worry: You aren’t done spending money just 
yet. You still have a lot of cool — and really important — gear left to buy. 
The next few sections introduce you to items that make video editing a little 
easier.
 
If you’re serious about videography — or even if you just want to make your life 
easier and improve the quality of your home movies — check out Chapter 19 for 
ten essential moviemaking extras.
Capture hardware
A digital camcorder and a powerful computer equipped with Adobe Premiere 
Elements won’t do you much good if you can’t get video from the camcorder 
into the computer. For this, you need capture hardware, so called because it 
captures audio and video into your computer.
FireWire (IEEE-1394) devices
FireWire is a high-speed interface developed by Apple Computer and first 
released in 1996. FireWire is actually Apple’s trademark name for the technol-
ogy officially known as IEEE-1394, named for the international standard to 

35
 Chapter 2: Equipping Yourself for Moviemaking
which it conforms. Sony and a few other companies call the interface i.Link. 
Many digital camcorders — especially tape-based camcorders — have a 
FireWire interface. Although Apple originally developed FireWire with digital 
video in mind, the IEEE-1394 interface is also used by other devices, including 
external hard drives, disc burners, and networking devices.
A FireWire interface makes capturing digital video really easy. You just con-
nect a cable between the FireWire port on your computer and the FireWire 
port on your camcorder, and then capture video by using Premiere Elements. 
It’s easy because all Premiere Elements really has to do is copy digital video 
data from the camcorder onto your hard drive.
 
Why is the process of getting video from a camcorder tape onto your hard 
drive called capturing rather than just copying? Digital video is often recorded 
onto a camcorder tape in an endless stream of data. The tape doesn’t contain 
data files like those found on a computer hard drive. When you capture video, 
you are basically taking a chunk of the video data and capturing it into a file 
that can be stored on your hard drive and used by your software programs 
(including Premiere Elements). 
Many new Windows-based PCs come with FireWire ports, but some don’t, so 
double-check your own PC. You should see a 6-pin FireWire port that resem-
bles Figure 2-1. If you don’t see one, you can purchase a FireWire expansion 
card from an electronics retailer. Installing a FireWire card in your PC has 
two indispensable prerequisites:
 
✓ A vacant expansion slot in your computer
 
✓ PC hardware expertise

If you aren’t familiar with expansion slots and don’t have experience with 
hardware upgrades, consult a professional PC technician. If your computer is 
still under warranty, don’t even look at a screwdriver until you’ve reviewed 
the warranty terms to determine whether — and how — upgrades should be 
performed.

Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
USB 2.0 devices
Virtually all Windows PCs sold in the last several years have USB 2.0 ports. 
USB 2.0 is an upgrade to the original USB (Universal Serial Bus) specification. 
Premiere Elements cannot capture video from tape-based camcorders by 
using a USB 2.0 port, but you can use USB 2.0 to get video from DVD or flash-
based camcorders.
 
Connect your camcorder directly to a USB 2.0 port on your computer; not to a 
USB hub. USB hubs are often slower and less reliable than the USB ports built 
in to your computer. 
Analog video capture devices
Do you have a bunch of old home movies on VHS, 8mm, or Hi-8 tapes that 
you’d like to capture and use? The video stored on those older tape formats 
is analog. Analog video is a bit trickier than digital video because it must 
be digitized before you can work with it on your computer. Capture cards 
are available to help you do this bit of magic, but keep in mind that Adobe 
Premiere Elements cannot directly capture video from an analog capture 
card. Fortunately, analog capture cards almost always come with their own 
video capture programs to help you convert the analog video to AVI or MPEG 
files. As I describe in Chapter 5, you can easily import AVI or MPEG files into 
Premiere Elements for editing.
 
Whatever capture card you decide to use, review the specs carefully before 
you make a buying decision. Many FireWire cards are marketed as “video cap-
ture cards” even though they can capture video only from digital camcorders.
Another solution may be an external video converter that sits on your desk-
top and connects to your computer’s FireWire or USB 2.0 port. The benefit of 
a video converter that connects to a FireWire/USB port is that you can cap-
ture video directly into Premiere Elements, because as far as Adobe Premiere 
is concerned, the video streaming in from the port is digital video. Video con-
verters are described in more detail in Chapter 19.
Storage options
Video files consume lots and lots of storage space. This presents a challenge 
as you try to figure out the best way to reliably archive all your footage. The 
best solution is to archive copies in multiple formats. Archive and storage 
options include
 
✓ Tape: If your camcorder uses MiniDV/HDV tapes, I strongly recommend 
that you not reuse tapes and instead archive used tapes in a safe storage 
location. Tapes tend to deteriorate after about ten years, and if you ever 
get rid of your MiniDV camcorder, you may lose the ability to play back 
the tapes.

37
 Chapter 2: Equipping Yourself for Moviemaking
 
✓ DVD: Recordable DVDs are cheap and easy to store, and the technology 
to play DVDs is likely to be around for a while. There is disagreement as 
to how long DVDs last. Estimates range from as little as a decade to as 
long as 100 years. Blu-Ray discs have the same advantages as DVDs, but 
with greater storage capacity. 
 
✓ External hard drives: An external USB or FireWire hard drive is a good 
place to archive footage that you plan to use again in the near future. 
External drives can be easily moved from one computer to another. But 
the lifespan of hard drives (external and internal) is short, so this should 
not be counted on as a long-term archiving solution. 
 
 Although external drives are good for short-term storage, video should 
be copied back to your computer’s internal hard drive before you edit 
it in Premiere Elements. USB and FireWire ports can present a speed 
bottleneck as you try to perform advanced video edits. 
 
✓ Internal hard drives: Your computer’s internal drive is the best place 
to store video that you’re currently editing. But it’s the worst place for 
long-term storage because hard drives are notoriously short lived, and a 
full hard drive deteriorates your computer’s overall performance. 
 
✓ The Internet: If you upload a movie to YouTube, it’s there forever, right? 
Maybe. YouTube was just born in February 2005, which wasn’t very long 
ago. Things change fast online, and what’s here today may or may not 
be there tomorrow. Web server space can serve as a useful backup, but 
don’t rely on it as your only archive source.
Blu-Ray burners
One way to share high-def video is to record it onto high-definition Blu-Ray 
discs. But to do this you need a Blu-Ray burner, and your audience must have 
Blu-Ray players. Earlier in this chapter, I recommend that if you’re buying a 
new computer, choose one that includes a Blu-Ray burner as well as a stan-
dard DVD burner. If your computer doesn’t have a Blu-Ray burner, you need 
to add one. 
 
Although you may see a Blu-Ray logo on the front of your computer’s disc 
drive, double-check the computer’s specs to make sure that it’s actually a 
Blu-Ray recorder, and not just a Blu-Ray player. Some drives can play Blu-Ray 
discs and record regular DVDs, but they can’t record Blu-Ray discs.
Several companies, including Lacie, LG, Lite-On, Pioneer, and Sony, make 
both internal and external Blu-Ray burners for under $300. Internal drives 
usually cost less money, but they require some computer hardware upgrad-
ing expertise and there could be warranty ramifications if you modify your 
computer. External burners cost a little more, but they are usually much 
easier to install and use.

H
igh-def camcorders and Blu-Ray discs are the hot video technolo-
gies today, but home movies aren’t exactly a new concept. Portable 
hand-cranked 16mm film cameras first appeared in the 1920s, and in 1932 
Kodak introduced the 8mm film format. By the 1950s, 8mm film cameras 
had become downright affordable, and the milestones ticked by with every 
passing year. Home movie cameras sprouted zoom lenses in the late 1950s; 
in 1964, Kodak introduced the Super 8 format, with its easier-to-handle film 
cartridges; in 1973, a magnetic audio recording system was added to Super 8 
cartridges.
Despite many advances, film-based movie cameras still had important disad-
vantages. The film had to be developed before it could be viewed, and watch-
ing movies required special movie projectors and a projection screen (or a 
big blank wall). In 1976, JVC introduced the VHS videotape format, and by the 
1980s most home movie enthusiasts had replaced their antiquated film cam-
eras with video camcorders. Digital video camcorders appeared in the 1990s, 
and the rest, as they say, is history.
While movie camera technology has evolved steadily over the last 85 years 
or so, home movie editing is still a relatively new concept. Sure, you could 
always “edit” your old film movies by cutting and splicing the film with a 
razor blade and cellophane tape. And home videos could be edited by cre-
atively juggling the pause and record buttons on a VCR and camcorder. But 
professional-style movie editing wasn’t really practical for the low-budget 
enthusiast until about the year 2000. That’s when digital camcorders prices 
became semi-affordable, and it’s also when the average consumer was finally 
able to afford a personal computer powerful enough to edit video.

Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
If you’re new to video, this chapter is for you. Here I introduce you to digi-
tal video technology, and I help you sort through the confusing morass of 
high-definition formats and terminology. This chapter also introduces you 
to video technologies and concepts to help you make more effective use of 
Adobe Premiere Elements.
What Is Digital Video?
Computers, as you probably know, aren’t very intelligent. They don’t under-
stand the serene beauty of a rose garden, the mournful song of a cello, or 
the graceful motion of an eagle in flight. Computers only understand ones 
and zeros. And yet, we force computers to show us pictures, play music, and 
display moving video. Humans perceive light and sound in infinitely variable 
waves. These waves are analog data. For a computer to understand this data, 
it must be converted into the language that computers understand: ones 
and zeros. This conversion process is called digitizing. Digital video is (you 
guessed it) video that has been digitized.
To fully understand the difference between analog and digital data, suppose 
that you want to draw the profile of a hill. An analog representation of the 
profile (see Figure 3-1) would follow the contour perfectly, because analog 
values are infinitely variable. A digital contour of that same hill would not be 
able to follow every single detail of the hill because, as shown in Figure 3-2, 
digital values are made up of specifically defined individual bits of data.
 
Figure 3-1: 
Analog data 
is infinitely 
variable.
 

41
 Chapter 3: Introduction to Moviemaking
 
Figure 3-2: 
Digital data 
contains 
specific 
values.
 
It could be said that a digital recording will always be theoretically inferior to 
an analog recording because the analog recording can contain more values. 
But the truth is that major advances in digital technology mean that this 
“limitation” really doesn’t matter. Yes, a digital recording must have spe-
cific values, but modern recordings have so many unique values packed so 
closely together that human eyes and ears can barely tell the difference. In 
fact, casual observation often reveals that digital recordings appear to be of 
higher quality than analog recordings. Why?
 
One of the problems with analog recordings is that they are highly susceptible 
to deterioration. Every time analog data is copied, some of the original data is 
lost. This phenomenon is called generational loss and can be observed in that 
dark, grainy copy of a copy of a copy of a wedding video that was first shot 15 
years ago. But digital data doesn’t have this problem. A one is always a one, 
no matter how many times it is copied, and a zero is always a zero. Likewise, 
analog recordings are more susceptible to deterioration after every playback, 
which explains why your vintage Meet the Beatles LP pops, hisses, and has lost 
many of its highs and lows over the years.
When you consider the implications of generational loss on video editing, you 
begin to see what a blessing digital video really is. You will constantly be copy-
ing, editing, and recopying content as you edit your movie projects — and with 
digital video, you can edit to your heart’s content, confident that the quality 
won’t diminish with each new copy you make.
Video Basics
Before getting into a detailed description of what video is, take a look at 
what video is not. Video is not film. What’s the difference? In film, an image 
is captured when chemicals on the film react with light. In modern video, 

42
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
an image is captured by a sensor called a charged-coupled device (CCD) or 
a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS). The image sensor is a 
sort of electronic eye that records the image digitally. Many “films” today are 
actually shot by using high-def digital video, even though they are output and 
distributed to movie theaters on film.
Converting light to video
Little Jenny picks a dandelion on a sunny afternoon. She brings the fluffy 
flower to her lips and with a puff, the seeds flutter gently away on the breeze 
(they land in the neighbor’s immaculate yard and spawn dozens more of the 
unappreciated yellow flowers). As this scene unfolds, light photons bounce 
off Jenny, the dandelion stem, the seeds, and anything else in the shot. Some 
of those photons pass through the lens of your camcorder. The lens focuses 
the photons on transistors in the light sensor. The transistors get excited, 
and this excitement is converted into data which is then digitally recorded by 
the camcorder. This process is repeated approximately 30 times per second.
 
The prehistoric ancestors of modern camcorders (those portable video cam-
eras of about 25 years ago) used video-pickup tubes rather than image sen-
sors. Tubes were inferior to CCD or CMOS sensors in many ways, particularly 
in the way they handled extremes of light. With pickup tubes, points of bright 
light (like a light bulb or reflection of the sun) bled and streaked across the 
picture, and low-light situations were simply too dark to shoot.
Reviewing analog video standards
Several new terms have entered the videophile’s lexicon in recent years: 
NTSC, PAL, HDTV. These terms identify a variety of broadcast television 
standards. Until the advent of digital HDTV broadcasting, you could find 
three main broadcast video standards throughout the world: NTSC, PAL, and 
SECAM. Table 3-1 gives technical details for each standard and lists where 
they were used. The important thing to know about these standards is that 
NTSC video was not compatible with PAL televisions, and vice versa, so make 
sure that you export movies that use the local standard for your audience.
All three video standards listed in Table 3-1 are interlaced. This means that 
the horizontal lines are drawn in two passes rather than one. Every other line 
is drawn on each consecutive pass, and each of these passes is called a field. 
On a PAL display, which shows 25 fps, there are actually 50 fields per second.

Mastering HDTV formats
When digital HDTV came along, the world hoped that it would once and for 
all end the problem of incompatible video standards. Alas, countries still 
couldn’t agree on the details, particularly frame rates. And so digital broad-
casting has caused the list of worldwide video standards to grow from three 
to four. They are listed in Table 3-2.

Adding to the confusion surrounding digital TV are the various technical 
details supported by each format. Resolutions can range from just 480 hori-
zontal resolution lines up to 1080, and the frame rate can be 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 
50, or 60 frames per second. And among the various resolutions and frame 
rates, digital TV can use interlaced or progressive scanning. 
It seems like a lot to remember! Fortunately, most HDTVs support all the 
common resolutions and frame rates. And manufacturers have standardized 
on several common resolutions for HDTVs and HD camcorders. The most 
common resolutions are

44
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
 
✓ 480i: 480 lines, interlaced, 25 or 30 fps. If you have a standard-definition 
digital camcorder, it probably uses this resolution. 
 
✓ 720p: 720 lines, progressive, 50 or 60 fps. The high frame rate makes 
720p great for sports or high-action video.
 
✓ 1080i: 1080 lines, interlaced, 25 or 30 fps. Higher resolution makes this 
good for shots with lots of detail, but interlacing makes it less ideal 
for fast-moving subjects. Confusingly, some vendors call this format 
1080i60, because there are 60 interlacing fields but only 30 actual frames 
per second. 
 
✓ 1080p: 1080 lines, progressive, 24, 25, or 30 fps. Progressive scanning 
makes 1080p superior to 1080i for fast motion, although 720p still offers 
a higher frame rate. High-def Blu-Ray discs use 1080p, sometimes (but 
not always) with a 24 fps frame rate to mimic film. 
The many aspects of aspect ratios
Different moving-picture displays have different shapes. The screens in 
movie theaters, for example, look like long rectangles, whereas older TV and 
computer screens were almost square. The shape of a video display is called 
the aspect ratio. 
The aspect ratio of a typical television screen used to be 4:3. This means that 
for any given size, the display was four units wide and three units high. To 
put this in real numbers, if you measure a 4:3 display and find that it’s 40 cm 
wide, you should notice that it’s also 30 cm high. If a picture completely fills 
this display, the picture is also said to have an aspect ratio of 4:3.
 
Different numbers are sometimes used to describe the same aspect ratio. The 
4:3 aspect ratio is sometimes expressed as 1.33:1. Likewise, the 16:9 aspect 
ratio is sometimes expressed as 1.78:1. But do the math and you’ll see that 
these different numbers still equal the same basic shape.
Most new TVs now come in a widescreen format. The aspect ratio of a wide-
screen TV picture is 16:9. This aspect ratio is now standardized in all world-
wide HDTV systems. Most movies are now distributed in a widescreen format 
as well. If you watch a widescreen movie on a 4:3 TV screen, you will see 
black bars — sometimes called letterbox format — at the top and bottom of 
the screen. Widescreen movies are popular because they more closely match 
the aspect ratio of the movie-theater screens for which the movies were 
originally shot. Figure 3-3 illustrates the difference between the 4:3 and 16:9 
aspect ratios.

 Chapter 3: Introduction to Moviemaking

mon image

ratios.

Whatever aspect ratio you shoot video in — 4:3 or 16:9 — you will need to 
be aware of your video’s aspect ratio as you edit your movies. This becomes 
important when preparing still images for use in movies, or when choosing 
settings for a new movie project.
Understanding timecode
A video image is actually a series of still frames that flash rapidly on the 
screen. Every frame is uniquely identified with a number called a timecode. 
The location and duration of all edits that you perform on a movie project 
use timecodes for reference points, so a basic understanding of timecode is 
critical. You’ll see and use timecode almost every time you work in Adobe 
Premiere Elements. Timecode is usually expressed like this:
hours:minutes:seconds:frames
Thus the 14th frame of the 3rd second of the 28th minute of the 1st hour of 
video is identified like this:
01:28:23:13
“But wait,” you say. “Why is the 14th frame noted with the number 13?” The 
frame portion of a timecode starts with zero and counts up from there. In 
video with a 25 fps frame rate (such as PAL or SECAM), frames are counted 
from 00 to 24. In video with a 30 fps frame rate (such as NTSC), frames are 
counted from 00 to 29. 
“Hey!” you exclaim. “Zero to 29 adds up to 30 fps, but Table 3-1 says that the 
frame rate for NTSC video is 29.97.”

46
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
You’re an observant one, aren’t you? As mentioned earlier, the frame rate 
of NTSC video is 29.97 fps (refer to Table 3-1). NTSC timecode actually skips 
frame codes 00 and 01 in the first second of every minute — except for every 
tenth minute. Work it out (let’s hear it for calculators!), and you see that this 
system of reverse leap-frames adds up to 29.97 fps. This is called drop-frame 
timecode. In Premiere Elements and most other video-editing systems, drop-
frame timecode is expressed with semicolons (;) rather than colons (:) 
between the numbers.
 
Why does NTSC video use drop-frame timecode? Back when everything was 
broadcast in black and white, NTSC video was an even 30 fps. For the conver-
sion to color, more bandwidth was needed in the signal to broadcast color 
information. Dropping a couple of frames every minute left enough room in 
the signal to broadcast color information, while at the same time keeping 
the video signals compatible with older black-and-white TVs. (Clever, those 
earthlings . . .)
Decoding codecs
To deal with the massive bandwidth requirements of video, digital video is 
compressed by using compression schemes called codecs. The term codec is 
short for compressor/decompressor. High-def video uses an MPEG codec to 
compress video down to about 3MB per second (depending on the resolution 
and frame rate; mileage may vary; please drive responsibly). 
Why do codecs matter to you? Premiere Elements enables you to choose from 
a variety of codecs when you output movies for a variety of uses (see Part IV 
for more on preparing movies for distribution). For example, video for the 
Internet needs a codec that compresses the data more, while outputting for 
DVD or Blu-Ray means less compression to maintain picture and sound quality. 
Usually, Adobe Premiere automatically picks a codec for you based on your 
output options, but it’s good to know what codecs are and how they work.
The nonlinear editing method
My grandfather is a tinkerer. Over the years, he has tinkered with wood, old 
lawn mowers, and even 8mm film. He wasn’t content to simply shoot home 
movies with his old 8mm film camera, so Grandpa actually edited his source 
footage into interesting films. He performed edits by cutting the 8mm film 
with a razor blade and then splicing scenes together in a different order, 
using cellophane tape (Scotch tape) to hold the splices together.

47
 Chapter 3: Introduction to Moviemaking
The process described above is what professional video editors call linear 
editing, and once upon a time all motion pictures were edited this way. It’s 
linear because you perform all your edits in order in a line, from begin-
ning to end. Linear editing is terribly inefficient. If you dub a program and 
then decide to perform another edit, subsequent video usually has to be 
redubbed. 
What is the alternative? Nonlinear editing, of course! As the name implies, 
nonlinear edits can be performed in any order. Nonlinear editing is made pos-
sible by the miracle of computer programs like Premiere Elements. Suppose 
(for example) that you have a program in which Scene 1 is followed by Scene 
2, as shown in Figure 3-4. But later you decide that you want to squeeze in 
another scene — call it Scene 1.5 — between Scenes 1 and 2. In Premiere 
Elements, you simply click-and-drag Scene 1.5 into the Sceneline or Timeline 
between Scenes 1 and 2. As shown in Figure 3-5, Premiere Elements automati-
cally moves Scene 2 over to make room for Scene 1.5.

Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Shooting Better Video
Editors have always been called upon to create movies that are worth watch-
ing. But an editor can wield only so much magic. If you want to make a great 
movie, you need to start with great source footage, because there is only 
so much improvement that an editing program like Premiere Elements can 
do. And if you don’t think “great” video footage is possible (yet) with your 
entry-level equipment and novice talents, think again! You can improve your 
techniques enough to make your results a lot more watchable. The following 
sections offer simple tips to help you shoot video like the pros.
Planning the shot
Modern camcorders are so simple that they encourage seat-of-the-pants 
videography. And by all means, if you see a UFO flying overhead, please just 
grab your camcorder and start shooting! But for most situations, you can 
plan many aspects of the shot to achieve the desired results in your final 
edited movie:
 
✓ Make a checklist of shots that you need for your project. Even when 
you’re recording events like a family vacation, take the time to get estab-
lishing shots of signs and panoramas. While you’re at it, make an equip-
ment checklist, too.
 
✓ Survey the shooting location. Position yourself to record the action, 
and make sure that passersby won’t trip over your tripod legs. 
 
✓ Talk to property owners or other responsible parties. Make sure that 
you have permission to shoot; identify potential disruptions (wandering 
livestock, air traffic near an airport, scheduled mud-wrestling matches — 
the usual).
 
✓ Bring more charged batteries and blank tapes or memory cards than 
you think you’ll need.
Composing the shot
Like a photograph, a great video image must be thoughtfully composed. Start 
by evaluating the type of shot you plan to take. Does the shot include people, 
landscapes, or some other subject? Consider what kind of tone or feel you 
want to achieve. Figure 3-6 illustrates how different compositions can affect a 
shot. In the left-hand shot, the camera looks down on the subject, as is often 
the case when video is taken of children. In the right-hand shot, the camera is 
held level with the subject. This might mean that you have to bend over, but 
the shot is much more interesting and flattering.

49
 Chapter 3: Introduction to Moviemaking
 
Your camcorder’s LCD screen swivels for a reason! If you swivel the screen to 
face up, you can more easily hold the camera at chest or waist level for more 
pleasing shots. Some prosumer camcorders have handles to make waist-level 
video shooting easier.
 
Figure 3-6: 
Composition 
affects 
how your 
subject is 
perceived; 
the left-
hand shot is 
much more 
flattering. 
Panning effectively
Another important aspect of composition is panning, or moving the camera. 
A common shooting technique that snapshot enthusiasts use with home cam-
corders is to pan the camera back and forth, up and down, either to follow 
a moving subject or to show a lot of things that don’t fit in a single shot. 
This technique is called firehosing and is generally discouraged. Firehosing 
screams “Amateur!” and can be disorienting to the viewer. Practice these 
rules when panning:
Dressing your cast for video success
Most of your video “shoots” will probably be 
pretty informal affairs, where you basically 
record an event that was scheduled to happen 
whether you brought your camcorder or not. 
Thus, you may have a hard time convincing 
all who are attending that they should dress 
appropriately for video. But there definitely are 
some types of clothes that work better than 
others in video — and if you have any control 
at all over what the people in your video wear, 
make these suggestions:
 ✓ Avoid clothes with lots of thin parallel 
lines or stripes. Thin parallel lines (like 
those you’d find on coarse corduroy or 
pinstripe suits) don’t get along well with TV 
screens; they create a crawling or wavy 
visual effect called a moiré pattern. 
 ✓ Limit the use of very bright shades of red 
and blue. Red is especially problematic 
because it tends to bleed into neighboring 
portions of the video image. This doesn’t 
mean everyone in your movie should 
wear dark, drab colors, however. Black is 
another good color to avoid. Ideally, your 
subjects’ clothing should be bright enough 
to lend some interest, but contrasts with 
the background somewhat so they don’t 
get lost in the video image.

50
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
 
✓ Pan only once per shot.
 
✓ Start panning slowly, gradually speed up, and slow down again 
before stopping.
 
✓ Slow down! Panning too quickly — say, over a landscape — is a 
common mistake.
 
✓ If you have a cheap tripod, you may find it difficult to pan smoothly. 
Try lubricating the tripod’s swivel head. If that doesn’t work, limit tripod 
use to stationary shots. Ideally, you should invest in a higher-quality 
tripod with a fluid head for smooth panning. See Chapter 19 for help 
with choosing a tripod.
 
✓ Keep the camera level with the horizon. A tilting horizon is very 
disorienting.
 
✓ If you’re shooting a moving subject, try moving the camera with the 
subject, rather than panning across a scene. This reduces out-of-focus 
issues with the camera lens, and it also helps to keep the subject in 
frame.
 
Like all the other video shooting tips in this book, the advice given on panning 
should be taken as guidelines, not hard-and-fast rules. Valid exceptions do 
exist; for example, imagine shooting video of your kid’s soccer game. As you 
keep the camera on a moving subject, you’ll naturally end up panning back 
and forth multiple times. If the shot ultimately looks right to you, that matters 
more than standard videography advice from a book.
Using (not abusing) the zoom lens
Most camcorders have a handy zoom feature. A zoom lens is basically a lens 
with an adjustable focal length. A longer lens — also called a telephoto lens — 
makes faraway subjects appear closer. A shorter lens — also called a wide-
angle lens — allows more of a scene to fit in the shot. Zoom lenses allow you 
to adjust between wide-angle and telephoto views.
Because the zoom feature is easy to use and fun to play with, amateur videogra-
phers tend to zoom in and out a lot. I recommend that you avoid zooming during 
a shot as much as possible. Overuse of the zoom lens disorients the viewer, and 
it creates focal and light problems whether you’re focusing the camera manually 
or using the auto focus option. Zoom-lens tips include the following:
 
✓ Avoid zooming whenever possible. Consider your purpose before 
you touch that dial. Wide-angle shots often provide the audience with 
a better view of the overall scene and action. Zooming in too much can 
make otherwise great scenes feel claustrophobic.

✓ If you must zoom while recording, zoom slowly. You may need to prac-
tice a bit to get a feel for your camera’s zoom control.
 
✓ Consider repositioning the camera instead of using the zoom lens to 
compose the shot. Wide-angle shots usually provide greater depth of 
field. This means that more of the shot is in focus if you’re zoomed out. 
If you shoot subjects by zooming in on them from across a room, they 
may move in and out of focus. But if you move the camera in and zoom 
the lens out, focus will often be less of a problem.
Lighting the shot
Light can be subdivided into two basic categories: good light and bad light. 
Good light allows you to see your subject, and it flatters the subject by expos-
ing details that you want shown. Shadows aren’t completely eliminated, but 
the shadows don’t dominate large portions of the subject either. Bad light, 
on the other hand, washes out color and creates lens flares — the reflections 
and bright spots that show up when the sun shines across the lens — and 
other undesired effects.
Shedding some light on the subject
How do you light video shots effectively? Remain ever aware of both the good 
light and the bad. If you don’t have control over lighting in a location, try to 
compose the shot to best take advantage of the lighting that is available. Here 
are additional lighting tips that may come in handy:
 
✓ Bounce intense lights off a reflective surface. Light reflecting from a 
surface, such as a white wall or sheet, is more diffused, providing more 
flattering lighting than shining bright light directly on the subject.
 
✓ Use multiple light sources of varying intensity. Light on the front of 
the subject brings out facial details, while light from above and behind 
(called key lighting) highlights the subject relative to the background. 
 
✓ Watch for backlight situations. Backlighting occurs when your subject 
appears in front of a bright background, such as an open window, as 
shown in Figure 3-7. This is one of the most common lighting mistakes 
in video and photography. If you can’t avoid backlit shots, one solution 
may be to increase the exposure setting on your camera. Unfortunately, 
this can cause the background to be overexposed and washed out, as 
shown in the bottom left of Figure 3-7. The automatic backlight compen-
sation features in many camcorders cause this problem. A better solu-
tion is to put extra light on the foreground subject, as I’ve done on the 
bottom right in Figure 3-7. Now I have good exposure of both my subject 
and the background.

✓ Shield your lens from bright light sources, particularly the sun. 
Intense light can reflect on the lens glass and cause flares that only show 
up later on video. If your camera lens doesn’t have a black hood, you 
can use your hand or black tape to make a temporary shield (check the 
viewfinder to ensure that your shield doesn’t appear in the shot).
 
✓ Check your camera’s documentation. Your camcorder might include 
built-in features to help you deal with special lighting situations, such as 
sporting events or a sun-washed beach.
 
✓ Use lens filters. A neutral-density filter, for example, reduces light in 
bright outdoor settings, reducing depth of field and making colors 
appear more vivid. A polarizing filter controls how reflective surfaces 
(like water or glass) appear, and reduces haze on landscape shots. See 
Chapter 18 for more on using lens filters.
Controlling exposure
Cameras with automatic exposure control have been around since the 1950s, 
and all modern camcorders can detect light and set exposure automatically. 
Automatic exposure usually works pretty well, but there will be times when 
you’ll want to adjust exposure manually for a more pleasing shot.
 
Exposure is actually determined by two things: the size of the aperture in the 
lens, and the shutter speed. The aperture opens or closes to let in more or 
less light, much like the pupil in the human eye. Smaller numbers such as f1.8 
indicate a large aperture opening, while larger numbers like f16 or f22 mean a 
smaller, almost pinholelike aperture. The shutter opens and closes at varying 

53
 Chapter 3: Introduction to Moviemaking
speeds to change how long the light sensor is exposed. Shutter speeds are 
expressed in fractions of a second, so “100” means 1/100th of a second.
Every camcorder is different, so you’ll need to spend time studying your cam-
era’s manual to find out exactly what settings are available and how to use 
them. Still, most camcorders offer four common exposure control modes:
 
✓ Automatic (A): This mode usually means that everything is set automati-
cally and no manual controls are available. This is the boring, “play it 
safe” mode for using your camera.
 
✓ Program (P): This is similar to Auto mode, but there are usually sub-
options for things like sports, portraits, or the beach. Choose the sub-
option that best matches what you plan to shoot, and the camera will 
choose exposure settings that work best for your video.
 
✓ Shutter Priority (TV): In this mode, you manually set the shutter speed 
and the camera automatically adjusts the aperture to match. Shutter 
speeds of 1/30 or slower usually result in blurry, jerky video.
 
 If your video image includes a TV or computer screen, you may notice 
that the screen appears to flicker in your recorded video. Increase the 
camcorder’s shutter speed to 1/90 or higher to eliminate the flickering.
 
✓ Aperture Priority (AV): In this mode, you manually set the aperture, and 
the camera automatically adjusts the shutter speed to match.
Knowing how to use the P, TV, and AV modes on your camcorder is great, 
but they all still involve automatic exposure control. What if your video 
subject is still too dark or too bright? In that case, use the Exposure (EXP) 
setting to manually increase or decrease the exposure value (EV) to get the 
desired light levels.
 
More advanced prosumer camcorders usually also offer a Manual (M) mode 
where you set both the shutter speed and aperture manually. This gives you 
the greatest level of control over exposure, but many consumer-level cam-
corders lack a fully Manual mode.
Exposure controls don’t just affect how much light is in your video images — 
they can also change the entire character of your subjects. Adjusting the size 
of the aperture gives you control over depth of field. Small apertures such 
as f11 or f16 give a broad depth of field, meaning that more of the shot is in 
focus. Large apertures like f1.8 or f2 yield a shallow depth of field, making 
the subject in focus and the background blurry. In Figure 3-8, I shot video of 
a hummingbird. I used a large aperture to shorten the depth of field, which 
blurs the background and makes the bird stands out better.

depth of

the back-

Shooting the shot
Perhaps the most important tip I can give you before you shoot your video 
is this: Know your camera. Even today’s least-expensive digital camcorders 
are packed with some pretty advanced features. For example, most digital 
camcorders include image stabilization, in-camera effects, and the ability to 
record 16-bit stereo audio. But these advanced features won’t do you much 
good if they aren’t turned on or are configured improperly. Spend a few 
hours reviewing the manual that came with your camcorder and practice 
using every feature and setting.
All modern camcorders include automatic exposure and focus control. But 
no matter how advanced this automation may seem, it isn’t perfect. Get 
friendly with the manual exposure and focus controls on your camera (if 
it has them) and practice using them. (I describe how to manually control 
exposure in the preceding section.) If you always rely on auto focus, inevi-
tably your video will show the queasy effects of the focus “hunting” for the 
right setting during some shots — especially if you shoot moving subjects or 
in poor light. If your camera has a manual focus mode, you can avoid focus 
hunting by turning off auto focus.

C
omputer software designers work hard to make sure that their pro-
grams are easy to use. When you open a new program for the first time, 
you often see a tutorial or a wizard screen that helps you get started without 
adjusting a lot of settings or mastering a bunch of cryptic menu commands. 
Adobe Premiere Elements is easier to use than pro-oriented video-editing 
programs, but you should still spend time configuring Premiere Elements 
before you start working.
Premiere Elements is an advanced program that accommodates a variety 
of editing styles, and you can configure Premiere Elements to use your pre-
ferred style. I recommend that you review the Premiere Elements options to 
ensure that your movie comes out right. And with that in mind, this chapter 
helps you configure Premiere Elements for making movies your way, take 
charge of important program and project settings, and get familiar with 
useful options.
Adjusting Premiere Preferences
Adobe Premiere Elements offers a plethora of settings, and you could easily 
spend a day or two sorting through them all. Some settings are immedi-
ately relevant to your work; others won’t be used until you perform more 
advanced work. The next few sections show you key settings that help you 
effectively use Premiere Elements on a daily basis.

Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Setting up your scratch disks
I hear some of you scratching your heads. “What in the Wide, Wide World 
of Sports is a scratch disk?” A scratch disk is the disk on which you store all 
your video stuff. When you capture video onto your computer, you capture 
it to the scratch disk. Likewise, many transitions, effects, and edits must be 
rendered — that is, they are actually applied to the clips — before those clips 
can be exported as part of a movie. The rendered clips are stored as preview 
files on the scratch disk. The scratch disk is your Premiere Elements storage 
place — your video data bucket, so to speak.
If your computer has just one big hard drive, you don’t necessarily have a 
separate scratch disk. Your scratch disk may actually be a folder on your 
main hard drive. But if you can get a separate hard disk to use exclusively as 
a Premiere Elements scratch disk, I strongly recommend it. Because big and 
fast hard drives are so cheap these days, there is almost no reason to not 
have a separate hard drive dedicated to serve as your scratch disk.
 
A scratch disk must be both big and fast. Those digital video files can take up 
a lot of space, and if your disk isn’t fast enough, you’ll drop frames during ren-
dering and when you try to burn DVDs. I recommend a 7200 RPM internal hard 
drive. See Chapter 2 for more on selecting hard drives.
You can choose different scratch disks and folders for different types of 
files. Premiere Elements always uses the location you specify. To set up your 
scratch disks, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Premiere Elements menu bar, choose Edit➪Preferences➪
Scratch Disks.
 
 The Scratch Disks section of the Preferences dialog box appears, as 
shown in Figure 4-1.
 
2. Use the Captured Video and Captured Audio menus to adjust the 
scratch disk settings for the video and audio that you capturewith 
Premiere Elements.
 
 When you capture movies from a camera, video deck, or other source, 
the location specified in the Captured Video menu is where the video 
files are stored. The default location for all scratch disks is a setting 
called Same as Project — which means the same location where you 
save your project file when you create a new project. If you have a sepa-
rate hard drive that you want to use as a video scratch disk, choose 
Custom from the drop-down menu next to each item, and then click 
Browse to choose a specific drive and folder. In Figure 4-1, I have chosen 
the custom location D:\Video for all my scratch disk locations.

57
 Chapter 4: Revving Up Premiere Elements
 
3. Choose a scratch disk for previews and other files used by Premiere 
Elements from the Video Previews, Audio Previews, and Media Cache 
drop-down menus.
 
 Whether you want to preview or export part or all of your project, 
Premiere Elements usually must render several preview files. Just as 
with Captured Video and Captured Audio, the default location for these 
preview files is Same as Project, which as the name suggests is the 
folder where your Premiere Project (.PREL) file is saved. You can select 
a different folder if you want.
 
4. Choose a scratch disk location in the Disc Encoding drop-down menu.
 
 When you burn a DVD, Premiere Elements needs a wide-open expanse of 
hard drive space in which to build the DVD image. This process is called 
disc encoding, and you should select an encoding scratch disk that is fast 
and has lots of free space.
 
5. Click OK when you’re done adjusting your Scratch Disk settings.
 
 The Preferences dialog closes. From now on, whenever you capture 
audio or video, it’s stored in the locations that you specified in the 
Scratch Disk settings.
 
Figure 4-1: 
Configure 
your 
storage 
space by 
using the 
Scratch 
Disks 
settings.
 
 
If your computer is part of a network, you can choose network drives on other 
computers when you set up your scratch disks. However, I strongly recom-
mend against using network drives as scratch disks. Most networks are not 
fast enough or reliable enough to adequately handle large video files without 
dropping frames and causing other problems.

Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Reviewing other options
Premiere Elements has many options and preferences that you can fiddle 
with to make the program work the way you want it to. The Preferences 
dialog box (refer to Figure 4-1) lets you quickly jump to different groups of 
settings by simply clicking a category in the list on the left side of the dialog 
box. To open the Preferences dialog box, choose Edit➪Preferences, and then 
choose any item from the submenu that appears. Preferences are organized 
into the following groups:
 
✓ General: The most important General settings are the Default Duration 
settings for video and audio transitions — these determine how long 
a transition takes when you first apply it to an audio or video clip. Of 
course, you can always adjust the duration for any transition; you may 
find it useful to change the default settings. The duration for video tran-
sitions is expressed in frames, and the default duration for audio transi-
tions is expressed in seconds.
 
✓ Audio: The main option you see here is called Play Audio While 
Scrubbing. This option has nothing to do with listening to music while 
washing dishes (sorry, dish-washing advice is beyond the scope of this 
book). Moving slowly or frame by frame through a video clip in Premiere 
Elements is called scrubbing. You’ll scrub video a lot as you identify 
exact locations for edits. But because you aren’t playing at full speed, 
you may find that audio sounds funny or even annoying while you scrub 
video. If so, deselect the Play Audio While Scrubbing check box. The 
other important options to review here are SmartMix options. SmartMix 
automatically adjusts the levels of main and background audio to give 
the perfect mix of dialog, soundtrack music, and other audio elements. I 
show how to use SmartMix in Chapter 8. 
 
✓ Audio Hardware: If you have multiple audio input/output sources on 
your computer, you can tell Premiere Elements which ones to use by 
setting the Audio Hardware preferences.
 
✓ Audio Output Mapping: If your computer has multiple speakers, click-
and-drag the speaker icons here to map sound to different speakers. 
 
✓ Auto Save: Choose whether Premiere Elements automatically saves your 
projects, and control how often those auto-saves occur. I recommend 
that you keep the default settings, which automatically save your work 
every 20 minutes. This way, you won’t lose hours of work simply because 
your dog tripped over the computer’s power cord; at most you’ll lose 20 
minutes of work. And remember, you can manually save your work at any 
time by clicking Save on the Premiere Elements toolbar.
 
✓ Capture: Here you can tell Premiere Elements to abort video capture 
if any frames are dropped. (I recommend that you leave the Report 
Dropped Frames option checked; if frames get dropped, you’ll want to 
know.)

59
 Chapter 4: Revving Up Premiere Elements
 
✓ Device Control: Set control options for your video-capture and output 
hardware here. (See Chapter 5 for more on working with device control.)
 
✓ Label Colors: Do you like to color-code your work? Then you’re in luck, 
because Premiere Elements lets you apply color-coded labels to all kinds 
of program elements such as video clips, audio clips, titles, and other 
types of media. Use this preferences group to choose label colors.
 
✓ Label Defaults: Different types of media and elements are given different 
colored labels by default. Control those default colors here.
 
✓ Media: The media cache stores files that Premiere Elements creates 
during editing, such as audio preview files and video indexing files. Stick 
with the default settings here; if you want to change the storage location 
for media files, use Scratch Disk preferences.
 
✓ Scratch Disks: Determine where the video files for your project are 
stored on your computer. (See the preceding section for more on adjust-
ing Scratch Disk settings.)
 
✓ Stop Motion Capture: Adjust settings related to stop motion video 
capture here. See Chapter 17 for more on using Stop Motion Capture in 
Premiere Elements. 
 
✓ Titler: The Adobe Title Designer includes a font browser that lets you 
preview the appearance of fonts. The preview usually just shows the let-
ters Aa in various font faces. If you don’t like those letters, choose differ-
ent letters in the Titler preferences.
 
✓ Web Sharing: Premiere Elements has built-in YouTube support, but 
Adobe wants to keep its options open for the future. Keep the 
Automatically Check for Services option enabled to allow Premiere 
Elements to periodically check for new video sharing sites that have 
partnered with Adobe to be supported directly by Premiere Elements. 
Click Refresh to manually check for new services.
 
✓ User Interface: Does the Premiere Elements program window look too 
dark? Use the slider control here to adjust the window’s brightness.
Customizing Premiere Elements
Premiere Elements users share something in common: We’re all individuals! 
This means you probably want to personalize Adobe Premiere to make it 
better suit your needs. We don’t all have the same work habits, and what 
works for me may not be ideal for you. The programmers at Adobe have 
given you quite a bit of control over some of Premiere Elements’ windows. 
You can even customize keyboard commands.

60
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Arranging the workspace
If you don’t like the default arrangement of the Premiere Elements work-
space, you can easily customize it. This capability is especially useful if your 
computer has a high-resolution display or multiple monitors. To play around 
with the Premiere Elements workspace, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Window➪Show Docking Headers.
 
 Docking headers appear at the top of the Monitor, Task pane, and 
Timeline/Sceneline windows (the header for the Timeline/Sceneline 
says My Project). You can hide the docking headers by choosing 
Window➪Hide Docking Headers, but you may find that the headers are 
pretty useful. 
 
2. Click the header menu in the upper-right corner to choose window-
specific options.
 
 The header menus — shown in Figure 4-2 — are unique to each indi-
vidual window in Premiere Elements, and they contain useful window-
specific commands. I frequently refer to the header menus throughout 
this book.
 
3. To move a window, click and hold on the header and drag the 
window to a new location.
 
 The capability to tear off windows (as I’ve done with the Monitor 
window in Figure 4-2) from their default locations is especially useful if 
your computer has multiple displays. Move the Monitor window over to 
your second monitor and then click-and-drag the corners of the Monitor 
to make it bigger. This allows you to see a full-size preview of your video 
while leaving lots of working space in the rest of Premiere Elements. A 
secondary display is also a good place to put the History and Info win-
dows, which I show you how to use in Chapter 7.
 
 After you tear off a window from its default location, you can close the 
window by clicking its Close ( X ) button in the upper-right corner. For 
example, if you’re organizing and tagging video clips (see Chapter 6) you 
can tear off and close the Timeline window to give you more working 
space in the Monitor and Organizer. 
 
4. To revert back to the default Premiere Elements workspace, choose 
Window➪Restore Workspace.

Modifying the Timeline
Throughout this book, I show the Timeline with default view settings. 
However, you can adjust some useful view options by using a couple of dif-
ferent tools. If the Sceneline is currently shown, click the Timeline button to 
open the Timeline. (The Sceneline doesn’t offer many customization options.) 
Timeline customization tools include:
 
✓ The Header menu: Open this menu in the upper-right corner of the 
Timeline. Here you can choose Track Size and select a new size for 
tracks from the submenu. Or you can choose Add Tracks to add audio 
or video tracks to the Timeline. A dialog box appears, enabling you to 
add tracks to the Timeline. I show you how to work with Timeline tracks 
in Chapter 7. Premiere Elements supports up to 99 video tracks and 99 
audio tracks in a single Timeline.
 
 The Timeline header menu also includes an option called Snap. Snap 
is kind of handy sometimes because when you click-and-drag a clip or 
other item to the Timeline, the item automatically snaps into place on 
the edit point or next to an adjacent clip. If you find this behavior annoy-
ing, choose Snap from the Header menu to disable the Snap option.
 
✓ The Set Display Style button for video tracks: Click this button on the 
track header for a video track to toggle between display styles. The 
default setting for video tracks only shows the first frame of the clip as a 
thumbnail at the beginning of the clip. In Figure 4-3, I’ve chosen the dis-
play style that shows a visual progression of frames across the clip. 

62
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
 
✓ The Set Display Style button for audio tracks: Click the Set Display 
Style button on the track header for an audio track to toggle between 
audio view options. When the line on audio tracks is yellow, waveforms 
of the left and right channels of the audio clip appear in the background. 
A waveform is a visual line-graph representation of the audio levels in an 
audio clip. Moving the line adjusts audio volume, also called gain.
 
✓ The Zoom slider: Use this slider, located at the top of the Timeline 
window, to zoom in or out on the Timeline. The plus (+) and minus (–) 
keys on your keyboard also let you quickly zoom in or out.

Customizing keyboard commands
Adobe Premiere Elements follows the same basic design paradigm as most 
other modern software programs. The Premiere Elements workspace is 
designed as a GUI (graphical user interface, often pronounced “gooey”), which 
means that program elements are laid out graphically. You navigate program 
windows and execute editing commands by using the mouse to click buttons, 
drag and drop items, and choose menu items. You can do almost anything in 
Premiere Elements with a mouse.
Still, don’t throw away that keyboard just yet. Many Premiere Elements users 
find that the mouse just doesn’t have enough buttons to quickly perform 
important actions. Thankfully, many common commands are accessible 
by using keys on the keyboard. In fact, Adobe worked hard to ensure that 
Premiere Elements uses some of the same industry-standard keyboard com-
mands as other professional editing programs. An example is the use of J, K, 
and L to reverse, pause, and play video, similar to the shuttle controls used 
by many other professional video-editing programs.
To view some of the most common keyboard commands in Premiere 
Elements, choose Help➪Keyboard (sorry, you’ll have to use the mouse for 

63
 Chapter 4: Revving Up Premiere Elements
this one). A help page at Adobe’s Web site opens with links to keyboard 
shortcut lists. If you want to customize keyboard commands, choose 
Edit➪Keyboard Customization. The Keyboard Customization window 
appears, as shown in Figure 4-4. 
This window has two drop-down menus at the top. The first drop-down menu 
lets you choose a set of keyboard commands. The default set is the Adobe 
Premiere Elements Factory Defaults (which you can return to anytime by 
choosing it from the Set menu). The second menu displays different items for 
which you can set your own keyboard shortcuts. The choices in this menu are
 
✓ Application: The majority of keyboard commands can be found here. 
Virtually all Premiere Elements program commands can be found in the 
Application group.
 
✓ Windows: This group contains commands that are specific to the 
various windows in Premiere Elements.

Scroll down the lists to see the keyboard shortcuts assigned to each 
Premiere Elements command. To change a command, click the shortcut in 
the Shortcut column and type a new shortcut. If your new shortcut is already 
used by another command, that fact is noted at the bottom of the window.
If you make a lot of changes, I recommend that you save your keyboard-
command set. To do so, click Save As and give your command set a descrip-
tive name like Keyboard Commands. Afterward, your custom keyboard-
command set is available as a choice in the Set menu.

Installing Plug-Ins for Premiere Elements
One of the things I really like about Adobe software — from the ubiquitous 
Acrobat Reader all the way up to Premiere Elements — is that the company 
designs its programs so that new features can be added through the use of 
plug-ins. Some third-party software companies get pretty creative with the 
capabilities they add. Plug-ins for Premiere Elements can add new special 
effects, video transitions, video export options, advanced title appearance 
options, image filtering tools, and more. Adobe provides a list of select plug-
ins for Premiere Pro and Premiere Elements online at
www.adobe.com/products/plugins/premiere/main.html
When you obtain a Premiere Elements plug-in, make sure that the plug-in is 
designed to work specifically with Premiere Elements (some plug-ins listed 
on Adobe’s third-party plug-ins page are only for Premiere Pro). Installation 
instructions should be provided by the publisher. Ideally, the plug-in comes 
with a setup program or installer that takes care of everything for you. Keep 
in mind, however, that many plug-in publishers assume that you know a thing 
or two about how Premiere Elements is installed and configured on your 
system. Therefore, you may not receive installation instructions, and you 
may need to do some manual installation procedures. Oh, joy!
 
Don’t worry. The main thing to know is that all plug-ins for Adobe programs 
are stored in a program-specific plug-ins folder somewhere on your hard 
drive. When you obtain a new plug-in, often you’re expected to copy the plug-
in file to that specific folder manually. Of course, it helps to know where the 
folder is. No problem. The folder should be right about here:
C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Premiere Elements\Plug-ins
 
Make sure that Premiere Elements is completely closed before you install a 
new plug-in. If Premiere Elements is running when you try to install a plug-in, 
the program may crash and you may lose unsaved work. 
Again, carefully read the documentation that comes with the plug-in (there 
might be a Readme file) for specific installation instructions. After you place 
the plug-in file in the folder mentioned here, it should be available the next 
time you open Premiere Elements. For example, if the plug-in adds a new 
transition, look for that transition to appear as an option in the Transitions 
group on the Effects tab when you restart Premiere Elements.

 Chapter 4: Revving Up Premiere Elements
Optimizing the Windows 
Operating System
Premiere Elements can weave some seriously high-tech movie magic, but 
Premiere Elements is only as capable as the computer on which it runs. If 
your PC can’t keep up, you won’t be able to truly harness Adobe Premiere’s 
power. To optimize Windows and your PC for the performance, check the 
following:
 
✓ Make sure that your PC exceeds the system requirements I outline in 
Chapter 2. Premiere Elements needs lots of RAM, a good video card, and 
a fast hard drive. 
 
✓ Do some hard drive housekeeping. Try to keep at least 50 percent of 
your hard drive available as free space. A full hard drive performs slowly 
and may not be able to keep up with high-def video. Back up large files 
to an external hard drive or a DVD to clear space, and empty the Recycle 
Bin. About once per month, click Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪
System Tools➪Disk Defragmenter and run Defragmenter to optimize the 
hard drive’s performance. 
 
✓ Close other programs. E-mail, Web browser, music player, and other 
open programs use up RAM and processor cycles that should be 
devoted to Premiere Elements. Those distractions also use up creative 
juices you should be saving for your movies! When you’re working on 
your videos, close everything except Premiere Elements. 
 
✓ Disable animations. Windows Vista and 7 come with window and menu 
animations that look cool, but they also detract from system perfor-
mance. Choose Start➪Control Panel, open the System icon, and then 
click Performance in the lower-left corner. Click Adjust Visual Effects 
to open the Performance Options window shown in Figure 4-5. Select 
Adjust for best performance, and then click OK.
 
✓ Disable superfluous startup items. Every time you restart your PC, lots 
of unnecessary utilities and tools launch and run in the background, 
under the guise of “helping” you. Some of these tools — such as anti-
virus programs — are actually pretty important. But others — media 
players, extra toolbars, and so on — are just a big waste of RAM. To dis-
able undesirable startup items, choose Start➪Run, type msconfig, and 
click OK. In the System Configuration dialog box that appears, click the 
Startup tab and remove check marks next to items you don’t recognize, 
as shown in Figure 4-6. Click OK, and then restart your computer to dis-
able the unchecked items. If you want any of the Startup items back, 
open System Configuration again and simply re-check the items. 

66

 If you experience persistent performance problems, you can also disable 
anti-virus and security programs, but do this only as a last resort. If you 
disable your anti-virus and Internet security, first disconnect the net-
work or modem cable that connects your computer to the Internet. 
Make sure that security is restored before you reconnect to the online 
world.

 Chapter 4: Revving Up Premiere Elements
Starting New Projects
An ancient proverb says, “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single 
step.” I believe that whoever wrote this proverb — thousands of years ago — 
must have been an Adobe Premiere Elements user. The journey of movie 
editing often feels like a thousand miles because there are so many creative 
possibilities that you never want to stop editing. And of course, this editing 
journey must begin with a single first step: creating a new project. The next 
section shows you how to create a new project. I also show how to customize 
project settings so that your new project matches the source footage from 
your camera. 
When you first launch Adobe Premiere Elements, you see a welcome screen. 
The easiest way to create a new project is as follows: 
 
1. On the Welcome screen, click the New Project button. 
 
 The New Project dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-7. 
 
Figure 4-7: 
Give your 
new project 
a filename.
 
 
2. Give your project a name, and choose a location in which to save the 
project file. 
 
 The default location for project files is a special Premiere Elements sub-
folder of your Documents folder. 
 
3. Take a look at the Project Settings noted in the New Project window, 
and then click OK or Change Settings, depending on what you see. 
 
 If they match the video you plan to capture and work with, click OK 
to create the project. But if the Project Settings are incorrect — or if 
you just aren’t sure — click Change Settings to open the Setup window 
shown in Figure 4-8. Here you find presets for different kinds of projects.
 
• PAL or NTSC: When you first install Premiere Elements, the setup 
program asks where you live and decides what your default video 
standard should be. As I describe in Chapter 3, if you live in North 
America, your default video standard should be NTSC. Many other 
parts of the world use PAL video systems instead.

68
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
 
• Camera recording format: Check the documentation for your cam-
corder to see what format it uses. The four basic categories are 
AVCHD (used by most high-def camcorders that use hard drives, 
flash memory, or DVDs); DV (standard-def camcorders that use 
MiniDV or Digital8 tapes and have a FireWire interface); Hard Disk, 
Flash Memory Camcorders (most tapeless standard-def camcord-
ers); and HDV (MiniDV tape-based high-def camcorders). 
 
• Camera settings: Some SD camcorders (and most HD camcorders) 
can record video in widescreen format (16:9). (See Chapter 3 for 
more on aspect ratios.) If you recorded widescreen video and want 
to produce your movie in widescreen format, choose a widescreen 
preset in Premiere Elements. If you have an HD camcorder, choose 
a preset that matches your recording mode, such as 1080i or 720p 
(again, Chapter 3 describes these modes in detail).
 
The video standard and screen aspect ratio settings for a Premiere Elements 
project can’t be changed after the project has been created. You must use the 
correct preset to start your project if you need to work with widescreen video 
or a foreign video format. 
If none of the presets seem to match your source video — suppose, for exam-
ple, you plan to work primarily with Web cam or VGA (640 x 480) video — you 
can create a custom preset as described in the next section.

project pre-
set here.
 
Reviewing and Changing Project Settings
When you click the New Project button to create a new project in Premiere 
Elements, default settings are automatically applied to your project. These 
settings describe the format of your movie project, specifying such things as 
the size of the video picture, the number of frames per second, and the default 
appearance of some of the Premiere Elements program windows when your 
project opens. Some of these settings can be changed, and some cannot. 

69
 Chapter 4: Revving Up Premiere Elements
To review project settings for an open project, choose Edit➪Project 
Settings➪General. The Project Settings dialog box appears, as shown in 
Figure 4-9. The Project Settings dialog box includes three categories of 
options. Click a category in the list on the left to review options on the right. 
The options in each category are described in the following sections.
 
Figure 4-9: 
Create your 
own custom 
preset here.
 
General settings
General project settings (refer to Figure 4-9) in the Project Settings dialog box 
determine the basic audio and video format for your project and other set-
tings of a, well, general nature. Important General settings include
 
✓ Playback Settings: Click the Playback Settings button to open the 
Playback Settings dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-10. The settings in 
this dialog box control how your media plays on a video device con-
nected to your computer, such as a camcorder. Playback settings are 
divided into three basic categories:
 
• Realtime Playback: As you edit video, you constantly play it back 
to see how your edits look. If you select the Desktop Video Display 
During Playback check box, video from your project will play both 
in the Premiere Elements window and on your external device, if 
the device happens to be connected to your computer and turned 
on. In Chapter 14, I explain the benefits of previewing video on an 
external monitor. 
 
 Also choose whether you want audio to play back on your com-
puter’s audio hardware (Desktop Audio) or your external device 
(External Device Audio). 

70
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
 
Figure 4-10:

box controls

project is

on external 
hardware.
 
 
• Export: If you have more than one camcorder or video-recording 
device connected to your computer, select the one you want to 
use for video export from the External Device drop-down menu. 
 
• 24p Conversion Method: If you’re working with 24p footage (see 
Chapter 2 for more on 24p shooting), select a conversion method 
for that footage here. 
 
 Some HD camcorders have a cinema mode that records HD video at 
24 frames per second (fps), the same frame rate as cinematic film. 
Premiere Elements converts 24p footage to a standard frame rate 
of 25, 30, or 60 fps by using either the Repeat Frame or Interlaced 
Frame pull-down method. The Interlaced Frame method provides 
the smoothest motion, but it can introduce interlacing artifacts 
(called combing because it creates fleeting lines that look like comb 
teeth). The Repeat Frame method avoids interlacing artifacts, but 
you may observe motion flaws when some frames are repeated. 
 
✓ Display Format (under Video): This menu controls how timecode 
is displayed while you work in your project. (See Chapter 3 for a 
detailed explanation of timecode.) If you’re working with NTSC digital 
video, I strongly recommend that you keep the 30 fps Drop-Frame 
Timecode setting.
 
✓ Title Safe Area: As I explain in Chapter 13, most standard-def TVs cut 
off portions of a video image at the edges of the screen. This problem is 
called overscan. To make sure that titles don’t get cut off by overscan, 
this setting enables Premiere Elements to temporarily display Title Safe 
margins in the Monitor window. The margins are just lines that appear 
over the video image to show which parts of the image may get cut off 
by TV overscan. Don’t worry: The lines aren’t permanent and won’t 
show up when you export your video; they’re just there to help you 
while you work. You can adjust the size of the Title Safe Area.
 
✓ Action Safe Area: This setting is similar to the Title Safe Area and is 
designed to ensure that important action on the screen isn’t cut off by 
overscan. The Action Safe Area is usually a little closer to the edges of 
the screen than the Title Safe Area.

71
 Chapter 4: Revving Up Premiere Elements
 
✓ Display Format (under Audio): Control how audio appears in the 
Premiere Elements timeline by using this menu. I find that the Display 
Audio Samples option is easiest to work with.
A bunch of other settings appear in the General Project Settings, but you 
can’t change them. These settings include the Editing Mode, Frame Size, 
Timebase, Audio Sample Rate, and more. Adobe Premiere Pro allows you 
to change those settings, but in Premiere Elements, the fields are provided 
merely for informational purposes. 
Capture settings
Capture settings control the default source from which you capture video. 
The choices available depend on your system’s hardware. The Capture 
Format menu gives you three options:
 
✓ DV Capture: Choose this for SD capture, using a FireWire/IEEE-1394 port.
 
✓ HDV Capture: Choose this for HD capture, using a FireWire/IEEE-1394 
port.
 
✓ WDM Capture: Choose this for capturing any video, using a USB port.
Video Rendering settings
As you edit a project and add transitions and effects to your video, Premiere 
Elements must apply your edits by using a process called rendering (build-
ing preview files for video). When Premiere Elements renders your work, 
it creates temporary files on your hard drive that allow your edits to play 
properly. Video Rendering settings control the format of these render files. 
Premiere Elements doesn’t allow you to change the format of render files, but 
that isn’t exactly a huge tragedy in my opinion, because render files are only 
temporary files anyway. The Video Rendering options screen does contain 
two check boxes that you can adjust: 
 
✓ Maximum Bit Depth: Enable this option to render previews with the 
maximum possible bit depth for better image and color quality. Preview 
quality will be improved, but render file sizes will be larger. 
 
✓ Optimize Stills: If your project has a lot of still images, choose this 
option to reduce rendering time. Optimizing stills could cause playback 
problems, however. If you encounter problems when the stills play, dis-
able optimization.

72
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Saving a Project
Saving a project in Adobe Premiere Elements is pretty straightforward. Just 
choose File➪Save from the menu bar and you’re done. As with most Windows 
programs, pressing Ctrl+S on your keyboard quickly saves your project. Or 
better yet, just click the toolbar button that looks like a floppy disk. That’s 
the Save Project button. If you want to save the project with a different name, 
choose File➪Save As, and if you want to save a backup copy of your project 
file, choose File➪Save a Copy.
You probably could have figured out how to save a project on your own, so 
why this section? One of the interesting things about Premiere Elements is 
that although video files tend to be very large, project files are actually quite 
small. Indeed, the project file for a 30-minute movie may be smaller than 50 
kilobytes (KB). This is because the project file doesn’t contain any actual 
audio or video. But the project file does contain
 
✓ Edit points that you create
 
✓ Pointers to the original source clips
 
✓ Information about effects that are applied to the project
 
✓ The layout of Premiere Elements windows from the last time you worked 
on the project
 
Because Premiere Elements project files are so small, it’s a good idea to fre-
quently save backup copies of a project. This way, you can easily go back to 
an earlier version of your project if you don’t like some of the changes that 
you’ve made. 
So where are all the big files? Not only do the source files for your audio 
and video take up a lot of disk space, but the process of rendering work for 
playback or output creates huge render files as well. All these big files live on 
your scratch disk. I explain how you find and specify a scratch disk earlier in 
this chapter.

Chapter 5
Capturing and Organizing 
Your Media
In This Chapter
▶ Capturing video to edit
▶ Importing video, audio, and other media
▶ Organizing your multimedia files
I
f you have a word processing program like Microsoft Word, you simply 
launch the program and start typing to compose something new. 
Likewise, you can open most graphics programs and start drawing freehand 
to create a new picture. But Adobe Premiere Elements is different, because 
you can’t just open the program and create a movie from nothing. To really 
put Premiere Elements to use, you must capture video from your camcorder 
and import other kinds of media such as music and photos.
This chapter guides you through the process of capturing audio and video, 
using Premiere Elements, whether you’re capturing video from your digital 
camcorder or importing it from another source. This chapter also shows you 
how to organize your media. Organization becomes increasingly important as 
you build a collection of dozens or even hundreds of video clips, audio clips, 
still images, and more.
Capturing Video
Before you can make movies in Premiere Elements, you have to capture or 
import video from your camcorder. What’s the difference between capturing 
and importing video? They’re slightly different processes that depend on the 
type of camera you have: 

74
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
 
✓ Capture: Capturing is what police do to fugitives from justice. It’s also 
what you do with video that has been recorded onto a tape. Premiere 
Elements can capture video from DV camcorders that use MiniDV or 
Digital8 tapes, or MiniDV-based high-def (HDV) camcorders. The process 
of getting video from tapes and turning it into files on your computer’s 
hard drive is called capturing. Recording live images from a Web cam is 
another form of video capture. 
 
✓ Import: Importing is the process of buying goods produced overseas, 
and it’s what you do with video from tapeless camcorders. Tapeless 
camcorders may use DVDs, hard drives, or memory cards to store digi-
tal video. Because the videos are already saved as files on your camera, 
those files simply need to be imported onto your computer’s hard drive.
 
Don’t worry too much about the difference between capturing and importing; 
it won’t be on the test later! For the sake of simplicity, I often use the term 
“capture” to refer to the process of getting video from any digital camcorder, 
as well as digital still cameras, cell phones, and Web cams. 
To start capturing video from your camera, launch Premiere Elements and 
start a new project as described in Chapter 4. Then follow these basic steps:
 
1. Connect your camera to your computer’s FireWire or USB 2.0 port.
 
 Check your camera’s documentation if you aren’t sure which port 
to use. 
 
2. Turn the camera on to Playback or VTR mode.
 
 Make sure that the camera has a charged battery. Some cameras must 
be plugged into AC power for video capture. 
 
 Windows will probably detect your camera as soon as you turn it on, 
and a dialog box will appear asking you what you want to do. It’ll prob-
ably ask you if you want to capture video or make a DVD by using 
Windows components rather than Premiere Elements. Click Cancel to 
close the dialog box. 
 
3. In Premiere Elements, click the Organize tab in the Task pane, and 
then click Get Media.
 
 A list of device types appears, as shown in Figure 5-1.
 
4. Click the button that most closely matches your camcorder.
 
 What happens next depends on the type of camera you have. If you 
have a tape-based camcorder, you should click “DV Camcorder” for a 
standard-definition camera, or “HDV Camcorder” for a high-definition 
unit. Now visit the next section, “Capturing video from DV or HDV 
tapes,” for your next steps. If your camcorder uses DVDs, a hard drive, 
or memory cards, or if you want to get video from a still camera or cell 
phone, see the section titled, “Copying video from tapeless cameras.” 
Visit “Capturing Web cam video” if you have a Web cam. 

75
 Chapter 5: Capturing and Organizing Your Media
 
Figure 5-1: 
Choose your 
camera for-
mat to start 
capturing.
 
 
As I describe in Chapter 4, video capture (particularly from tapes) requires a 
lot of system resources. Before you start capturing, close all other open appli-
cations, disable unnecessary Windows startup utilities, and make sure that 
your scratch disk has plenty of empty space. 
Capturing video from DV or HDV tapes
If your digital camcorder stores video on tapes (either MiniDV or Digital8), 
the process of transferring that video onto your computer’s hard drive is 
called capturing. Premiere Elements supports capture from three different 
types of tape-based digital camcorders:
 
✓ MiniDV: This tape format — sometimes also called DVC — was first 
developed for digital camcorders in the 1990s and is the most common 
camcorder tape format today. Most MiniDV camcorders have FireWire 
ports for video capture. Some MiniDV cameras have USB 2.0 ports, 
but FireWire is required for capture in Premiere Elements. Standard-
definition MiniDV-based camcorders use the DV codec. 
 
✓ HDV: This is simply a high-definition video codec that records onto 
MiniDV tapes. 
 
✓ Digital8: These camcorders record digital video onto Hi-8 tapes. Digital8 
camcorders have FireWire ports and use the DV codec, so in Premiere 
Elements they work exactly like MiniDV cameras. 

76
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
 
If your camera uses Sony’s short-lived MicroMV tape format, I have some bad 
news: Premiere Elements doesn’t support MicroMV. If you own a MicroMV-
based camcorder, use Sony’s included software to capture video, and then 
export it in MPEG2 format for easy import into Premiere Elements. 
Setting up device control
If you connect your DV or HDV camcorder to a FireWire or USB 2.0 port, 
Premiere Elements should recognize it automatically. But as with all things 
in the computer world, what should happen and what does happen aren’t 
always the same thing. Before you try capturing video from a DV or HDV cam-
corder, I recommend that you manually configure Device Control in Premiere 
Elements. Device Control allows Premiere Elements to take control of and 
synchronize with your camcorder. To enable Device Control:
 
1. Connect your DV or HDV camcorder to your FireWire or USB port with 
an appropriate cable, and turn the device on to playback mode.
 
2. In Premiere Elements, choose Edit➪Preferences➪Device Control.
 
 The Preferences dialog box appears, displaying Device Control options.
 
3. In the Devices menu, choose DV/HDV Device Control for FireWire 
devices.
 
4. Click Options.
 
 The Device Control Settings dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-2.
 
5. Choose the appropriate video standard (NTSC or PAL) from the Video 
Standard drop-down list.
 
 See Chapter 3 for more on video standards.
 
6. Choose the brand of your camcorder from the Device Brand menu.
 
7. Choose a type or model number from the Device Type menu.
 
 If your DV device isn’t listed, click Go Online for Device Info. Premiere 
Elements checks Adobe’s online hardware database and updates as 
necessary.
 
8. Choose a format from the Timecode Format menu.
 
 I recommend that you keep the default or Auto Detect setting. See 
Chapter 3 for a detailed explanation of timecode formats. 
 
9. If you see the word Offline next to the Check Status button, click 
Check Status to see if Premiere Elements can detect your camera.
 
 If the Offline mode remains, make sure that the camera is turned on to 
playback mode, the battery is charged, and your FireWire/USB cable is 
properly connected.
 
10. Click OK twice to close the dialog boxes when you’re done.

Capturing video
Your computer is ready to capture video. The camcorder is turned on and 
ready. Premiere Elements is ready. What about you? If you’re ready to cap-
ture video, follow these steps:
 
1. Connect all the necessary cables, turn on your hardware, launch 
Premiere Elements, start a new project, and perform all the other pre-
paratory steps described earlier in this chapter.
 
 As described earlier in this chapter, click Organize and then click Get 
Media to open the list of device types (refer to Figure 5-1).
 
 If you want your captured video to be stored in a particular folder or 
hard drive, choose Edit➪Preferences➪Scratch Disks and adjust scratch 
disk settings as described in Chapter 4.
 
2. Click either DV Camcorder or HDV Camcorder.
 
 Choose DV if you have a standard-definition MiniDV or Digital8 cam-
corder; choose HDV if you have a high-def camcorder. 
 
3. Type a name for your video clips in the Clip Name field.
 
 The Clip Name field is located in the upper-left corner of the Capture 
window. You can give a descriptive name to your clips, or you can just 
accept the default name. 
 
4. Decide whether you want to capture video straight to the Timeline.
 
 The right side of the Capture window has options, and one of them is 
called Capture to Timeline. If you keep this option enabled, your captured 
video will be automatically dumped onto the Timeline when you’re done. 
This is helpful if you just want to make a movie quickly, but if you want to 
pick and choose scenes later, uncheck the Capture to Timeline option.
 
5. Enable the Split Scenes option if you want Premiere Elements to auto-
matically detect scenes.
 
 This feature creates separate clips for each scene on the tape and makes 
editing a lot easier later. I recommend that you leave the Split Scenes 
option enabled.

78
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
 
6. Enable the Auto-Analyzer.
 
 Auto-Analyzer is one of the coolest features of Premiere Elements. When 
you’re done capturing, Premiere Elements analyzes your clips and then 
labels them with tags that tell you if the clips are in focus, if they include 
faces, whether the video is shaky or in focus, and other things. Auto-
Analyzer adds a lot of time to the capture process, but if you aren’t in a 
hurry, I recommend that you keep this feature enabled. The information 
that Auto-Analyzer provides will be useful later. 
 
7. Use the controls located beneath the viewer section of the Capture 
window to review the tape.
 
 To identify the exact frame at which you want to start capturing, use the 
left- and right-arrow keys on your keyboard. Figure 5-3 details the vari-
ous playback controls. The Step Back and Step Forward buttons enable 
you to move back or forward a single frame at a time. 
 
8. Click Capture to start capturing video.
 
9. Click Pause to stop capturing.
 
 When you stop capturing, Premiere Elements reviews your captured 
video to detect clips and analyze content, if you enabled those features. 
A progress bar tells you how long the analysis will take.

10. Close the Capture window when you’re done capturing.
When the capture job is done, your clips are loaded into the Organizer, and if 
you opted to capture directly to the Timeline, clips are placed there too. Visit 
Chapter 7 for more on deleting and moving clips in the Timeline.
Troubleshooting DV configuration mishaps
If you got hung up on Step 7 in the preceding section, there is probably some-
thing wrong with your DV device, your computer, or both. If your camcorder 
doesn’t respond to the playback controls in the Capture window, follow 
these troubleshooting tips:
 
✓ Close and restart Adobe Premiere Elements: While you’re at it, restart 
your computer, too. Make sure that the camcorder’s power is turned on 
to playback mode before you restart Premiere Elements.
 
✓ Double-check the physical connection to your computer: Is the 
FireWire cable properly installed and secure? The small ends of FireWire 
cables, which connect to camcorders, are prone to slipping out; I run 
into this problem even during professional video projects.
 
✓ Be sure that the DV device recognizes the FireWire connection: The 
display or viewfinder on your camcorder may show an indication such 
as “DV IN” if the connection is detected.
Dealing with dropped frames
The most common problem to afflict the video capture process is the infa-
mous dropped frame. If something in the computer gets choked up during 
capture, Premiere Elements may miss, or drop, one or more frames. Dropped 
frames create unacceptable quality problems for captured clips in Premiere 
Elements, because essential digital data is gone — poof.
But how do you know whether a frame has been dropped? Glad you asked. 
If you finish capturing a clip and a Properties dialog box appears, that is a 
bad sign. Review the statistics in this dialog box. If you see a line that says, 
This movie appears to have DROPPED FRAMES, you almost certainly 
dropped frames during capture — and that usually means that you have to 
redo the capture.
Determining the cause of dropped frames can be challenging, but here are a 
few possible causes:
 
✓ A timecode break: A timecode break on the tape can confuse Premiere 
Elements into thinking it dropped frames when it really didn’t. Timecode 
breaks often occur when you reuse tapes by recording new footage over old 
footage you no longer want. When you reach the end of the new recorded 
footage, the timecode may change and thus confuse Premiere Elements. If 
you have been reusing tapes — not something I recommend — you might 
want to consider this as a possible cause of dropped-frame reports. 

80
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
 
✓ A hard drive error: The most common cause of dropped frames is that 
the hard drive can’t maintain the required data rate during capture. 
Usually this isn’t a problem on computers that match even the minimum 
system requirements for Adobe Premiere Elements, but it isn’t beyond 
the realm of possibility either. Common causes include
 
• Programs other than Premiere Elements were open during capture.
 
• The hard drive has not been defragmented recently.
 
• Another computer was trying to access the hard drive over your 
network (if you have one) during capture.
 
 If your hard drive does appear to be the culprit, you can try to correct 
the problem by methodically repreparing your computer for capture as 
described earlier in this chapter. Close unneeded programs, defragment 
your hard drive, buy more RAM, or consider upgrading your drives. If 
your capture card came with its own capture software, you may want to 
try using that software to capture, and then import the captured clips 
into Premiere Elements for editing.
 
✓ A problem with the DV device: If your Date Rate/Sec graph is a straight 
line but frames are still dropped, the cause is more likely your DV device 
or the tape. 
 
If you have a separate hard drive used primarily for video capture, and you 
have a network, make sure that the hard drive isn’t shared with your net-
work. To check, right-click the drive in My Computer, and then choose the 
Sharing and Security option from the menu that appears. In the dialog box that 
appears, disable sharing if the drive is shared, and then click OK. 
Copying video from tapeless cameras
Early versions of Adobe Premiere Elements only supported camcorders that 
used MiniDV and Digital8 tapes. But tapeless video cameras are increas-
ingly popular, and Adobe has flowed with the changes. The latest versions 
of Premiere Elements support nearly all digital camcorders, including those 
that record video on DVDs, hard drives, or solid-state memory. You can even 
import video shot with digital still cameras and cell phones.
 
Solid-state memory is just a fancy technical term for data storage media that 
doesn’t have any moving parts. This includes built-in flash memory as well as 
removable memory cards like SDHC cards. 
Tapeless cameras make the capture process a lot easier. With tapes, you 
have to play the video in real time while your computer records it to files. 
But with tapeless cameras, the video is already saved into files, so all you 
have to do is copy those files from the camera to your hard drive. Follow 
these easy steps:

81
 Chapter 5: Capturing and Organizing Your Media
 
1. Connect the camcorder to your USB 2.0, turn it on to video playback 
mode, and prepare your computer as described earlier in this chapter.
 
2. In Premiere Elements, click Organize; then click Get Media, and 
choose the type of camera you have.
 
 Choose DVD if you have a DVD-based camcorder (including miniature 
DVDs), or AVCHD or other hard disk/memory camcorder for most other 
tapeless camcorders. You can also choose Digital Still Camera or Mobile 
Phone and Players from the list of device types. The steps for importing 
video from those devices are the same as for importing from other tape-
less camcorders. 
 
3. In the Media Downloader that appears, shown in Figure 5-4, choose 
your camera in the Get Media From menu.
 
 If your camera isn’t listed, make sure that it’s connected and turned on. 
You may need to adjust settings on the camcorder itself to specify PC 
output; check the camera’s documentation to be sure. 
 
Figure 5-4: 
Choose your 
camera.
 
 
4. Select a subfolder option for your video in the Create Subfolders 
menu.
 
 The default option creates separate folders for each date on which video 
was shot. This option is useful, but only if your camcorder’s internal cal-
endar and clock are set correctly. 
 
5. Click the Advanced Dialog button. 
 
 The advanced Media Downloader dialog — shown in Figure 5-5 — lets 
you preview clips before you capture them. For some reason, Adobe 
thinks this step is optional, but I think it’s pretty important.

7. Click Get Media to import media from your camera.
 
 When the import is complete, clips appear in your Organizer and are 
ready to use.
 
8. After the import is finished, close Premiere Elements, and then open 
My Computer or Windows Explorer.
 
 Choose Start➪My Computer (Windows XP) or Start➪Computer 
(Windows Vista or 7) to open My Computer.
 
9. Right-click the icon for your camcorder, and then choose Eject from 
the menu that appears, as shown in Figure 5-6.
 
 The Eject command ensures that the camcorder can be safely discon-
nected from your PC. Although this step may seem unnecessary, failure 
to “Eject” the camera from Windows could cause data corruption and 
loss on the camera’s memory.
 
10. Turn off the camcorder’s power and disconnect the USB cable.
Some camcorders use SD memory cards for storage, and many computers 
have built-in SD card readers. You may be tempted to simply insert your SD 
cards directly into the card reader to try to copy video, but that may not 
work too well. Use the camcorder and the Media Downloader to ensure that 
your clips are imported properly and stay organized in Premiere Elements.

Capturing Web cam video
If you have a Web cam connected to your computer, Premiere Elements can 
record directly from that camera. Capturing video from a Web cam is a lot 
like capturing video from a tape-based camcorder. You should close other 
open programs to make sure that your computer runs efficiently. Then you 
can start to capture: 
 
1. Connect the Web cam to your computer’s USB port and make sure that 
the camera is powered on. 
 
2. In Premiere Elements, click Organize, click Get Media, and then click 
Webcam or WDM Device. 
 
3. In the Capture window that appears (refer to Figure 5-3), make sure 
that the video image is framed the way you want it to appear.
 
4. Give your clip a name in the Clip Name field.
 
 Entering a clip name for Web cam video is important, because Premiere 
Elements can’t automatically generate a name based on information 
from a camcorder. 
 
5. Click Capture to start recording, and click Pause when you’re done.
That’s it! You can now plop your smiling mug (or whatever your Web cam 
was pointed at) into your movies.

Importing Media Files
There is no doubt in my mind that all the video you record with your cam-
corder is indescribably perfect just the way it is. But, if I may be so bold, 
wouldn’t it be even better if you enhanced it a bit with music, or perhaps 
illustrative stills? Good, I’m glad you agree. Premiere Elements can import all 
kinds of media, even video produced by other applications. Supported for-
mats include
 
✓ Video: 264, 3G2, 3GP, ASF, AVC, AVI, DV, FLM, M1V, M2P, M2T, M2TS, 
M2V, M4V, MOD, MOV, MP2, MP4, MPD, MPE, MPEG, MPG, MPV, MTS, 
SWF, TOD, VOB, WMV
 
✓ Audio: AAC, AC3, AIF, AIFF, M2A, M4A, MOV, MP3, MPA, MPE, MPEG, 
MPG, WAV, WMA
 
✓ Still graphics: AI, BMP, CR2, CRW, DIB, DNG, EPS, GIF, ICB, ICO, JFIF, JPE, 
JPEG, JPG, MRW, NEF, ORF, PCT, PCX, PIC, PICT, PNG, PRTL, PSD, PXR, 
RAF, RAW, RLE, TGA, TIF, TIFF, VDA, VST, WMB
You can import any format in this list and use it in your Premiere Elements 
projects, although cell phone videos in the 3GP or MP4 formats require you 
to have Apple QuickTime installed. (A free QuickTime download is available 
at www.apple.com/quicktime; if you have an iPhone or iPod, you already 
have QuickTime.) The following sections show you how to import audio from 
an audio CD or another source and how to prepare still graphics for use in 
Premiere Elements. After you’ve done that, you can move to the last section, 
which describes how to actually import files (stills or not).
 
Importing files of any kind (still images, video, or audio files) that don’t belong 
to you can get you in hot water if you don’t have permission from the originator 
or owner of the files. I’m no copyright expert, so the best I can do is advise 
you that if you have any questions about whether you’re using files inappro-
priately, err on the side of caution. For general information about copyright 
and the Internet, check out www.whatiscopyright.org. For more specific 
information about technology law in the United States, check out www.
bitlaw.com. 
Capturing audio clips
If you want to use audio from a music CD, you have to first rip the track(s) 
you want onto your hard drive by using third-party software. Adobe Premiere 
Elements can easily import AAC, MP3, and WMA files. You can rip CDs into 
one of these formats, using many common media player programs such as 
iTunes or Windows Media Player. To rip WMA files with Windows Media 
Player, follow these steps:

85
 Chapter 5: Capturing and Organizing Your Media
 
1. Place an Audio CD in your CD-ROM drive and launch Windows Media 
Player by choosing Start➪All Programs➪Windows Media Player.
 
2. In Windows Media Player, click Rip.
 
 After a few moments, a list of tracks on the current audio CD appears. 
Usually Windows Media Player automatically identifies the album, songs, 
and artist by using an online music database, but if your musical selec-
tions are more obscure, Media Player displays the songs as Unknown. 
You can manually enter song names, the name of the artist, and other 
information about the song if you want. 
 
3. To manually enter a song or artist name, click the field, wait for a 
second, and then click again. Type a name. 
 
 Entering a descriptive name and artist name for the song helps you find 
it later.
 
4. Use the playback controls to play the tracks and identify songs that 
you want to copy.
 
5. Place check marks next to each song that you want to copy. 
 
6. Click Start Rip at the top of the Windows Media Player window. 
 
 Windows Media Player shows the copying in progress. When the desired 
files are copied to your hard drive (Windows Media Player displays the 
message, Ripped to Library), go ahead and close Windows Media 
Player.
 
7. In Premiere Elements, click Organize, click Get Media, and then click 
PC Files and Folders.
 
8. Browse to the folder containing the song that you copied.
 
 Unless you’ve changed Windows Media Player’s default settings, the 
copied songs appear in the My Music folder of your Documents folder. 
Folders are automatically created to organize music by artist and album.
 
9. Choose the song you want to import and click Open.
 
 The imported song appears in the Adobe Organizer.
 
When you import a song, Premiere Elements converts the song so that it has 
the same sample rate and number of channels as your project. The converted
version is saved as a copy in the Premiere Elements media cache (see 
Chapter 4 to find out where the cache is located). This audio conversion is 
called conforming, and you’ll see a Conforming… message in the Premiere 
Elements status bar at the bottom of the screen during the process. But don’t 
worry: Conforming your favorite punk rock tracks will not make the music 
conformist. 

86
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
Preparing still images for your movie
Using still photos in your movies seems like a simple enough task, but it 
isn’t. Still photos can get distorted when they’re used in videos, appearing 
stretched or squished. Either that, or they don’t fit the whole screen and 
have to be “letterboxed.” The reason for this is that pesky matter of image 
aspect ratios I talk about in Chapter 3.
Fortunately, changing your still photos to the correct aspect ratio is easy 
if you have an image-editing program like Photoshop Elements. To resize 
images in Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, follow these steps:
 
1. Determine the image aspect ratio of your project.
 
 Standard video images have an aspect ratio of 4:3, while widescreen 
images are 16:9. All the high-definition presets in Premiere Elements are 
16:9 widescreen. See Chapter 4 for more on selecting project presets.
 
2. Open the image in Photoshop and save it as a Photoshop document 
(PSD) before performing any edits.
 
 Make sure that you save a new copy of the image so that the original 
is preserved. Photoshop documents can be imported directly into 
Premiere Elements. If you have a different image-editing program, save 
the document in TIFF format.
 
3. Find your project format in Table 5-1, and then decide which image 
size you want to use.
 
 The sizes in the Small column of Table 5-1 should be considered mini-
mums. Images that are smaller than these minimums will appear pixi-
lated in your videos. In most cases, it’s safe to use the Small size, but if 
you want to use any of the image panning and zooming effects described 
in Chapter 17, select a size from the Medium or Large columns instead. 
Large sizes allow more zooming.
 
4. In Photoshop, choose Image➪Image Size.
 
 The Image Size dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-7.
 
5. Make sure that the Resample Image option is checked, and choose 
Bicubic from the Resample options menu.
 
6. In the Pixel Dimensions section of the Image Size dialog box, choose 
Pixels from the drop-down menu, and then make sure that both 
the width and height exceed the dimensions you want to use from 
Table 5-1.
 
 If either dimension is under the size you want to use, select a smaller 
dimension from the Small or Medium columns of Table 5-1 instead. 

87
 Chapter 5: Capturing and Organizing Your Media
 
Figure 5-7: 
Adjust 
the size of 
your still in 
Photoshop 
before 
importing it 
into a video 
project.
 
 
 If you’re working with high-definition video, you need to start with 
higher resolution still graphics. The dimensions for the Small high-def 
image size listed in Table 5-1 require that you start with an image that is 
approximately 3 megapixels. You’ll need a 7 megapixel image to achieve 
the Medium size, and the Large size requires about 12 megapixels. 
 
7. Enter a new width or height from Table 5-1.
 
 For example, if you’re using the Small size for high-def widescreen, enter 
1920 for the width, but make sure that the height isn’t below 1080. If the 
height is below 1080, enter 1080 for the height. The width should still 
exceed 1920.
 
8. Click OK to close the Image Size dialog box.
 
 The image should shrink down to the new dimensions.
 
9. Choose Image➪Canvas Size.
 
10. In the New Size section of the Canvas Size dialog box, select pixels in 
width and height menus.
 
 At this point, one of the measurements — width or height — should match 
the size you want from Table 5-1, while the other measurement is bigger. 
 
11. Change the Width and Height so that they both match the size you chose 
in Table 5-1, and then click OK to close the Canvas Size dialog box.
 
12. Click Proceed in the warning message that appears.
 
 The image is cropped down to the appropriate size.
 
13. Choose Filter➪Video➪NTSC Colors.
 
 The NTSC Colors filter ensures that the colors in your still graphic are 
compatible with video displays. You may notice that some colors appear 
less saturated after using this filter, but the NTSC Colors filter is neces-
sary to prevent other problems in your movies. Photoshop doesn’t offer 
a PAL Colors filter, but the NTSC Colors filter should be adequate for 
images destined for PAL video.
 
14. Save and Close the image.

You can do a lot of cool things with still photos in Premiere Elements, like zoom

advanced techniques that help you bring still photos to life in your movies.
Importing stills and other media
Importing still graphics, audio files, and other neat things into Premiere 
Elements is really easy. If you’re importing a still image into a project that is 
based on NTSC or PAL video, first adjust the image size as described in the 
preceding section. Then follow these steps:
 
1. In Premiere Elements, click Get Media on the Organize tab, and then 
click PC Files and Folders.
 
 The Add Media dialog box appears.
 
2. Browse to the file that you want to import.
 
 Note that All Supported Files is selected in the Files of Type menu by 
default. If you want to search for files of only a certain type, choose the 
desired type from this menu.
 
 You can also import an entire folder into Premiere Elements. Browse 
to the folder you want to import, and then click Add Folder in the Add 
Media dialog box.
 
3. Select the file and click Open.
 
 The imported file appears in your Organizer.

89
 Chapter 5: Capturing and Organizing Your Media
If the file you want to import doesn’t show up in the Add Media window — 
and you’re certain that you’re looking in the correct folder — the file may be 
of a type that isn’t supported by Premiere Elements. (To double-check, see 
the “Importing Media Files” section earlier in this chapter for my list of sup-
ported file types.)
Keeping Your Media Organized
When most people think of Adobe Premiere Elements, they think mainly of 
video, but this is truly a multimedia-rich program. You’ll no doubt work with 
many different kinds of media in Premiere Elements — audio, video, still 
graphics, and even text. You’ll wind up using files from all over your com-
puter, and possibly even your network. Keeping track of all this media stuff 
can be a challenge, but Premiere Elements can help in several ways:
 
✓ Tags: You can apply tags to any piece of media in Premiere Elements. 
These tags may tell you that the clip includes people, places, events, 
or other tags that you create. Tags can tell you at a glance if a clip has 
problems like poor lighting or shaky video, and you can rate clips from 
one to five stars. Best of all, Premiere Elements can analyze your clips 
and apply many tags automatically, saving you hours of work reviewing 
and evaluating every clip in your library. 
 
✓ Organizer: The Organizer window displays nontechnical details of clips, 
such as tags and ratings. You can sort and filter clips by date, tags, rat-
ings, or media type. 
 
✓ Edit window: If you’re the kind of person who likes to read spec sheets, 
you’ll appreciate the Edit window. Like the Organizer, the Edit window 
lets you sort or filter clips by media type, and you can organize clips 
into folders. But the Edit window also shows you technical details about 
each item, including the frame rate, duration, and more. 
 
The first time you launch the Premiere Elements Organizer, you are asked if 
you want to specify the location of media you want organized. If you already 
have some videos, pictures, music, or other media that you want to use in 
Premiere Elements, click Yes. Browse to a folder containing media, click 
the folder name once to select it, and then click Get Media. The Organizer 
searches for and imports compatible media in the selected folder. 
Using the Organizer
As you work in a project, any media that you import or capture is added to 
your Organizer. The Organizer, shown in Figure 5-8, displays a lot of informa-
tion about your clips. Key functions you can perform in the Organizer include

90
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
 
✓ Filter clips by album: Use the Albums menu to show only clips from 
a specific album. Premiere Elements creates separate albums for each 
new project, and you can also create your own albums. (I show you how 
to create albums later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Filter clips by tag: Under Keyword Tags, place check marks next to tags 
you want to display. I show you how to tag clips in the next section.
 
✓ Apply and use ratings: You can rate clips from one to five stars by 
simply clicking the appropriate star under a clip. Then use the Ratings 
option at the top of the Organizer to filter clips by rating. 
 
✓ Change the thumbnail size: Use the thumbnail slider to change the size 
of thumbnails to show more or fewer clips on-screen.
 
✓ Sort by date: Click the Date menu, and then enter a date range if 
you only want to see clips from a certain time period. Use the Media 
Arrangement menu to sort clips by newest or oldest first. 
 
✓ Show/hide details: Deselect the Details check box at the top of the inter-
face if you don’t want to see details under each clip icon. Hiding details 
lets more clips fit on the screen.

 Chapter 5: Capturing and Organizing Your Media
 
Click Show All to remove filters and redisplay all clips. This truly does show 
all your clips from all your projects, so you may need to refilter a bit after 
clicking Show All. 
Tagging your clips
For years, I mentally subdivided my media clips into categories. I tried to 
remember which clips showed soccer games, which ones showed people, 
and which ones showed holidays or school events. Adobe must have been 
reading my mind because they created an excellent tagging system that 
means users no longer have to remember which clips fit into what categories. 
As I show earlier in this chapter, Premiere Elements can analyze clips and 
apply many tags automatically during video capture. You can also use 
automatic tagging later, and you can manually change tags or create your 
own. You can then use these tags to categorize, review, and sort clips in the 
Organizer, as shown in Figure 5-9. Some important things to know about tags 
in the organizer include
 
✓ Tag icons: A tag icon under a clip means that the clip has been tagged, 
either manually or automatically. With larger thumbnails, the tag icon is 
purple and appears under the clip, as shown in Figure 5-9. If you make 
the thumbnails smaller, the tag icon turns yellow and appears on top of 
the clip thumbnail. 
 
✓ Tag ToolTips: Hover the mouse pointer over a tag icon to reveal a 
ToolTip, as shown in Figure 5-9. The ToolTip lists tags assigned to that 
clip. 
 
✓ Tag categories: Click the arrow next to SmartTags on the right side of 
the Organizer, and use the check boxes next to each SmartTag category 
to filter clips. If a category has an arrow next to it, click the arrow to 
reveal subcategories. You can, for example, filter your media so that you 
only see clips that are high quality, in focus, with dialog, and panning 
quickly to the left. Alas, it isn’t yet possible to view only clips that are 
high quality, in focus, with dialog, panning to the left, and shot on the 
second Tuesday of the month during a lunar eclipse. Maybe in the next 
version of Premiere Elements. 
As you can see, SmartTags are pretty, uh, smart. The next few sections show 
you how to apply and use tags, as well as how to create new albums to help 
keep clips organized.

Adding SmartTags automatically
Premiere Elements can intelligently analyze your clips. Premiere Elements 
detects quality issues such as dark or blurry video, and it also detects the 
content. For example, Adobe Premiere can detect human faces in clip, and 
even distinguish between close-ups, long shots, or large groups of people. 
To automatically apply SmartTags, first select the clips you want to tag in the 
Organizer. You can select a single clip, click-and-drag around a group of clips, 
or press the CTRL key on your keyboard and click on individual clips. Each 
selected clip has a blue border. Then right-click the selected clip (or clips) 
and choose Run Auto Analyzer, as shown in Figure 5-10. At this point you can 
probably go take a coffee break. SmartTagging takes awhile, especially if you 
selected a lot of clips. 

93
 Chapter 5: Capturing and Organizing Your Media
 
Figure 5-10: 
Apply 
SmartTags

cally.
 
 
You may notice a button on the right side of the Organizer called Start People 
Recognition. This feature recognizes individuals in images. When you first run 
it, the Organizer finds a face and then asks you, “Who’s this?” Type in “Jane 
Smith” and the software searches for and finds other images showing Jane. 
Cool, huh? Unfortunately, People Recognition only works with still images, not 
video. Adobe isn’t trying to tease us; they just include this feature because the 
Organizer is shared by both Premiere Elements and Photoshop Elements. 
Applying your own keyword tags
The SmartTag feature in Premiere Elements saves you a lot of work, but there 
is only so much that a computer program can do. Fortunately you can add 
tags to or remove tags from your clips — even tags of your own creation. 
When you use the Organizer, notice the four additional tag categories listed 
directly under SmartTags: People, Places, Events, and Other. These tags 
aren’t SmartTags because they aren’t applied automatically by the Organizer 
software, but don’t call them dumb tags because they’re applied manually by 
you (and like I say in this book’s intro, you’re no dummy). 

94
Part I: Laying the Groundwork 
The four categories of manually applied tags are overly broad. You can create 
your own subcategories and tags, and even create whole new categories. To 
create and apply your own tags, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Organizer, click the green plus (+) sign under Keyword Tags 
and choose New Category.
 
2. Type a name for your new category in the Create Category dialog box 
that appears.
 
3. Click Choose Color, and then use the color picker to choose a tag 
color.
 
4. Choose a category icon, and then click OK to create the category.
 
 To create subcategories, click the green plus (+) sign in the Organizer 
and choose New Sub-Category. Enter a name for the subcategory in the 
dialog box that appears, and decide where you want to create the sub-
category by using the Parent Category or Sub-Category menu. 
 
5. Click the green plus (+) sign again, and choose New Keyword Tag. 
 
6. In the Create Keyword Tag dialog box that appears, choose a category 
in the Category menu, and then type a name for the new tag. 
 
 In Figure 5-11, I am creating a tag called Single Bird within the 
Hummingbirds category, which I also created.
 
 The Create Keyword Tag dialog box includes a button called Place on 
Map. Unfortunately, as of this writing, the map feature only works for 
still photos because the Organizer is shared with Photoshop Elements. 
Some still cameras automatically assign locations to photos by using a 
built-in GPS function, and the Organizer can use that data.
 
7. To apply a tag to a clip, click-and-drag the tag from the Keyword Tags 
menu and drop it directly on the clip.
 
Figure 5-11: 
Tags can 
be tied to 
geographic 
locations.
 

95
 Chapter 5: Capturing and Organizing Your Media
When you apply a tag to a clip, a little tag icon appears with the clip details. 
To remove a tag, right-click a clip’s tag icon, and then choose the tag you 
want to remove from the context menu that appears.
 
Although the Auto-Analyzer that applies SmartTags is pretty powerful, you 
can manually apply SmartTags as well. Simply click-and-drag tags from the 
SmartTags category and drop them on clips, just like with keyword tags. 
Creating new albums
Whenever you create a new project in Premiere Elements, a new album is cre-
ated for all the media you capture or import into that project. These albums 
are handy because — as shown earlier in this chapter — you can easily view 
the albums of other projects while you work in Premiere Elements. 
Although albums are normally associated with specific projects, you can 
create new albums if you wish, and then add files to those albums either 
manually or automatically. To create a new album:
 
1. In the Organizer, click the green plus sign (+) under Albums and 
choose New Smart Album from the menu that appears. 
 
2. In the New Smart Album dialog box that appears, type a name for the 
new album in the Name field. 
 
3. Under Search Criteria, select search options. 
 
 Choose a search criteria in the first criteria menu. You can search based 
on almost any imaginable criteria, including tags, filenames, map loca-
tions, media types, video formats, and much more. The remaining fields 
and menus vary, depending on what you choose in the criteria menu. 
Figure 5-12 shows examples of several different types of search criteria. 
 
4. Click the Add Additional Criteria button to add more criteria. 
 
 In Figure 5-12, I have created four search criteria. The first two specify 
files from a couple of video projects. The third criteria searches for clips 
that have a Hummingbirds keyword tag. The fourth criteria searches 
for any clips that have Sledding somewhere in the filename.
 
5. Choose whether clips in the album must meet one or all of the search 
criteria.
 
 In Figure 5-12, I’ve selected the first option, which means that clips can 
meet any of the criteria. If I only want clips that meet all four criteria, I 
would choose the second option. The options work like the OR and AND 
search commands used in Boolean searches.
 
6. Click OK to create the album.
To manually add a clip to an album, click-and-drag the album from the 
Albums list and drop it on a clip in the Tagging window.

Managing clips in the Task pane
 
The Adobe Organizer lives up to its name because it does a great job of help-
ing you organize all your media files. But the Organizer is really a separate 
program from Premiere Elements, and sometimes you don’t want to launch a 
second program. The Premiere Elements Task pane gives you access to useful 
tools to help you quickly gather info about your clips.
Open a project in Premiere Elements, click the Organize tab in the Task pane, 
and then click the Project button. You see a window similar to Figure 5-13, 
listing details for all the clips associated with your current project. This 
includes video clips you have captured, as well as other imported media files. 
The Project view gives access to some useful features:
 
✓ View detailed information about clips. The Project view indicates 
whether clips have already been used in your movie (and if so, how 
many times). It also lists the media type, frame rate, and duration.

97
 Chapter 5: Capturing and Organizing Your Media
 
✓ Organize clips into folders and subfolders. Click the New Folder button 
at the bottom of the Task pane, and then type a name when the new 
folder appears. Click-and-drag clips into folders to organize them.
 
✓ Click New Item to quickly create a title, black video, bars and tone, 
color matte, counting leader, or a SmartSound audio file.
 
 I show you how to add titles to your movies in Chapter 13. Black video, 
bars and tone, color mattes, and counting leaders are elements that you 
often add to the beginning or end of a video for technical purposes. I 
briefly explain these technical elements in Chapter 14. SmartSound is a 
handy soundtrack creation tool that I describe in Chapter 8.
 
✓ Add comments to your video clips. In Figure 5-13, you can see that 
I’ve added comments to a couple of clips. For example, next to the clip 
00024.MTS I’ve added the comment, Post game huddle. I may find 
this information useful later.
 
✓ In List view, click a column head to sort clips by that heading.
Using the Organizer rather than Premiere Elements
If you look at the upper-right corner of the 
Organizer, you see four tabs called Organize, 
Fix, Create, and Share. In this chapter, I mainly 
show you how to use the features on the 
Organize tab. These tabs give you access to 
a surprising array of editing and sharing fea-
tures, although not all of them apply to video. 
The Fix tab, for example, provides tools for 
cropping and improving still photos, but none of 
the features found on this tab work for video. 
The only video-related button on the Fix tab 
is the Edit Videos button, which launches 
Premiere Elements.
The Create tab is also primarily intended for 
working with still photos, with options for 
making prints, calendars, photo books, and 
slideshows. The Instant Movie and DVD with 
Menu buttons both launch Premiere Elements. 
I show how to use the Instant Movie feature 
in Chapter 1, and DVD creation is covered in 
Chapter 16.
The Share tab is a little more versatile, with 
sharing options that apply to both still photos 
and video. The options are self-explanatory, 
with most of them simply launching Premiere 
Elements. The Online Album button helps 
you share photos and videos online by using 
Photoshop.com or another Web service, and 
the E-mail Attachments and Photo Mail but-
tons launch your e-mail program. Chapter 15 
describes your online sharing options, as well 
as the implications of sending large video files 
through e-mail.

V
ideo editing can be broken down into three basic 
steps: Capture, edit, and export. The chapters in this 
part of Premiere Elements 8 For Dummies cover the first 
two steps. First, you start by creating new movie projects. 
Then you find out how to capture video from your digital 
camcorder and how to import other kinds of media.
When you have some media to work with, I show you how 
to perform basic editing to turn your media into a basic 
movie. I also cover adding transitions between video 
clips, and I show how to work with music and other audio.

Chapter 6
Trimming and Editing Video Clips
In This Chapter
▶ Reviewing your clips
▶ Setting In points and Out points
▶ Marking your place with clip markers
▶ Fine-tuning your clips
L
ike plays, movies are made up of scenes you put together in a certain 
order so that the show makes sense and is enjoyable to watch. Before 
you can turn scenes into a movie in Premiere Elements, you need to identify 
which scenes you want to use. Each scene — called a clip in video-editing 
parlance — should be previewed for both video and audio content. After you 
decide to use a clip, you then determine which portions of that clip you want 
to keep. Sometimes you may want to leave virtual sticky-notes on scenes to 
remind yourself later of an important spot in the scene. 
After you’ve captured some video as described in Chapter 5, this chapter 
leads you through the next steps — previewing your video clips, selecting 
portions of clips to use in projects, and performing other tasks to make your 
clips ready for use in your movies.
Reviewing Your Clips
Clips that you capture or import into Premiere Elements all wind up on the 
Task pane and in the Organizer (see Chapter 5 for more on capturing and 
organizing clips). Clips come in many flavors: video, audio, still graphics, 
titles, and more. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. (For more on working 
with titles, see Chapter 13.)

102
Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
Getting the details on your clips
The Premiere Elements Task pane displays thumbnail images of clips, but 
not much else. It also usually displays every clip you’ve ever captured or 
imported, making it harder to find just the clips associated with your current 
project. To view basic details about clips in your current project, click the 
Project button on the Organize tab. A list of clips appears, displaying details 
such as the media type, frame rate, and clip duration. If you need even more 
technical detail about a clip, right-click a clip and choose Properties from the 
menu that appears. A Properties window appears, as shown in Figure 6-1. The 
Properties window lists some important clip details, including:
 
✓ File path: You know the files are somewhere on your hard drive, but 
where exactly are they? The File Path field tells you the exact folder in 
which a clip resides.
 
✓ Image size: Does the frame size of the video clip or still image match 
your project? Clips that you imported into Premiere Elements may not 
have the same frame size as clips that you captured from your cam-
corder. For example, if you import a clip with the frame size 320 x 240, 
the image quality of that clip may appear blocky and pixilated when 
it’s inserted into a project that consists mainly of standard- or high-
definition video.
 
 You should also be wary of mixing standard- and high-def video in the 
same project. If you use a standard-def clip with an image size of 720 
x 480 in a high-def project with a size of 1920 x 1080, the lower-quality 
standard-def clips will stick out like sore thumbs. 
 
✓ Frame rate: Does the frame rate for all your video clips match? If you 
mix frame rates in a single project, jerky video may be the sad result. 
 
 If you have a clip with a frame rate that doesn’t match the rest of your 
video, import that clip into a new Premiere Elements project. Place the 
clip in the Timeline and export it as an MPEG or AVI file with a frame 
rate that matches your original project. Then import the new clip into 
your original project. 
 
✓ Pixel aspect ratio: A pixel aspect ratio of 1.0 means that the pixels are 
square. A number above or below 1.0 indicates rectangular pixels. NTSC 
video often has a pixel aspect ratio of 0.9, and PAL footage usually has 
a pixel aspect ratio of 1.067. So-called full HD video with an image size 
of 1920 x 1080 usually has square pixels (1.0) in either NTSC or PAL for-
mats. I explain pixel aspect ratios in Chapter 3. 
 
 As with image size and frame rates, avoid mixing video clips with dif-
ferent pixel aspect ratios in the same project. Still images used to be 
problematic too, but newer versions of Premiere Elements automati-
cally compensate for mismatched pixel aspect ratios in still images. (See 
Chapter 5 for more on preparing still images for use in your movies.)

 Chapter 6: Trimming and Editing Video Clips

ties to get 
detailed 
information.
 
 
The Properties dialog box, shown in Figure 6-1, is for a clip recorded by an 
AVCHD tapeless camcorder. If you view properties for a clip from a tape-based 
camcorder (either standard or high-def), the Properties dialog will also show a 
Data Rate Analysis graph for the clip. In most cases, this graph is just interest-
ing to look at, but if your captured video doesn’t play back smoothly and you 
suspect dropped frames, check the clip properties. Dips in the clip’s Data Rate 
Analysis graph indicate dropped frames, whereas a straight line indicates no 
dropped frames. See Chapter 2 for more on camcorder formats, and Chapter 5 
for tips to prevent dropped frames during video capture. 
Previewing clips
When you view a list of clips in the Task pane, the thumbnail images that 
appear show only one frame of the clip. You need to play the whole clip to 
see what it contains. After you preview the clip, you can decide whether 
you want to use that clip (the whole thing or just small chunks of it) in your 
movie. 
Previewing a clip is pretty easy. Just double-click it to open the clip in a sepa-
rate Preview window like the one shown in Figure 6-2. The Preview window 
includes the following controls:
 
✓ Playback controls: Like the controls on a VCR or DVD player, these let 
you play, pause, rewind, or fast-forward the clip. Use the Step Back or 
Step Forward buttons to move a single frame at a time. 

104
Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
 
✓ Clip timeline: This is like a ruler that represents the clip as it plays from 
beginning to end. The clip timeline shows timecode in hours, minutes, 
seconds, and frames (see Chapter 3 for more on timecode). Color coding 
is used on the clip timeline to show In and Out points, which I explain 
later in this chapter. 
 
✓ Current Time Indicator (CTI): The CTI shows where the current video 
frame is along the clip timeline. The CTI moves as you play a clip, and 
you can click-and-drag the CTI to move it. The CTI is an important edit-
ing tool that I refer to often throughout this book. 
 
✓ Current timecode: This lists the current timecode of the CTI. Click-and-
drag left or right on the timecode to shuttle the video backward or for-
ward. Or click once on the timecode and type a new number to quickly 
jump to a specific location. 
 
✓ Clip duration: No big surprises here; this shows the duration of the clip. 
If you set In and/or Out points as described later in this chapter, the 
duration shrinks to reflect the duration between the In and Out points 
rather than the whole clip.

If you want to reveal safe margins in the Preview window (shown in Figure 6-3), 
right-click the video picture and choose Safe Margins from the menu that 
appears. As I explain in Chapter 13, safe margins help ensure that titles and 
important action appear properly on different TVs and displays. Action that 
happens outside the larger safe margin is too close to the screen edge and 
may not be visible on some TVs.
Edit faster using the keyboard
 
The Preview window gives you a lot of options for playing, pausing, and 
moving around in your clips. But the more you work with video, the more 
you will find that clicking buttons with a mouse pointer is not an efficient way 
to work. You’ll start to wish for an easier way. Good news! There is an easier 
way: keyboard shortcuts. Professional video editors rely heavily on keyboard 
shortcuts when they edit video, because those shortcuts make life easier. As 
you play with the Preview window, practice these handy keyboard shortcuts:
 
✓ J, K, and L: These three keys are good friends who live next to each 
other on your keyboard, and you’ll want to move in next to them, too. 
Press L to play forward. Press L again to double the speed. Press L again 
to double the speed again. Keep pressing L to make your video play for-
ward so fast that all the action is a blur! Press K to pause playback, and 
then get ready for something really cool: Press J. The J key works just 
like the L key, but in reverse. 
 
✓ Spacebar: The spacebar is not where astronauts order cocktails. Press 
the spacebar to play or pause your clip. 
 
✓ Left and right arrows: The left- and right-arrow keys are, if anything, 
even more important and valuable than the J, K, and L keys. Press the 
left-arrow key to step back one frame, and press the right-arrow key to 
step forward one frame. 
 
 The arrow keys are the best way to position the CTI on the exact spot 
where you want to make an edit. 
 
✓ Home and End: There’s no place like home, except at the beginning 
of every video clip. Press Home to jump to the beginning of a clip, and 
press End to jump straight to the end.
 
✓ Q and W: After you set In and Out points (see the next section of this 
chapter), press Q to move to the In point and W to go to the Out point.
 
✓ I and O: In the next section, I show you how to use In and Out points. 
Press I to set the In point at the current CTI location, and press O to set 
the Out point.

Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
Working with Clip Markers
In a perfect universe, there would be peace on Earth, we’d all be eating free 
rainbow stew, and every clip of video would start and end at exactly the right 
time. Alas, this world isn’t quite perfect yet. But at least with video you can 
provide the illusion of perfection by using In points and Out points. In and Out 
points are critical in video editing because they let you control which por-
tions of a clip appear in the video program and which portions don’t appear. 
The following sections serve up steps for perfecting your clips by using In 
points, Out points, and other markers.
Setting In and Out points
The In point is the spot where the clip begins playing in the project, and 
an Out point is, of course, the spot where you want to stop using the clip. 
Setting In points and Out points on a clip is pretty easy, and Premiere 
Elements gives you a couple of different methods to choose from. Before you 
get started, you need to understand a few basics to make your editing go 
smoothly:
 
✓ I strongly recommend that you set In and Out points on a clip before you 
insert it into your project’s Timeline. You can adjust In and Out points 
later in the Timeline, but that process is a little more cumbersome.
 
✓ In general, do not set the In point at the very beginning of the clip if 
you can avoid it. The main reason for not doing so is to facilitate transi-
tions between clips. Transitions — described in Chapter 9 — are ways 
to smooth out or dress up the changes between scenes in a movie. 
Suppose (for example) you want to apply a Cross Dissolve transition to 
the beginning of a clip, and you set it to last for one second — during 
this one-second period, the preceding clip fades out and the new clip 
fades in. By default, Premiere Elements facilitates such a transition by 
using the “extra” material just beyond the In and Out points of the adja-
cent clips.
 
✓ As with In points, Out points should not be set at the very end of a 
clip if you can avoid it. As with In points, this gives some leeway for 
transitions.
When you’re ready to set In and Out points, follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click a clip in the Task pane to open it in a Preview window, 
as described earlier in this chapter. 
 
2. Use the preview controls to position the CTI where you want to set an 
In point or Out point. 
 
3. Mark the point in your desired spot.

107
 Chapter 6: Trimming and Editing Video Clips
 
 Premiere Elements provides a couple of methods for setting these points 
(see Figure 6-3 for control locations):
 
• In the Preview window, click the Set In Point or Set Out Point 
button.
 
• Press I (In point) or O (Out point) on your keyboard.
 
 After you’ve marked In and Out points on a clip, the duration of your 
marked clip portion appears to the right of the playback controls. As 
you can see in Figure 6-3, I have set In and Out points to select just over 
nine seconds of this clip.

Using clip markers
In points and Out points usually get all the attention in books like this, but 
you can use other markers in your clips as well. Markers come in handy 
because they can serve as virtual sticky-notes, marking specific events or 
spots in a clip. To set a marker at the current position in the clip, right-click 
the CTI (refer to Figure 6-2) and choose Set Clip Marker from the menu that 
appears. A submenu offering several different kinds of markers appears. 
Different kinds of markers include

108
Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
 
✓ In, Out: These are your basic In points and Out points, as described in 
the preceding section.
 
✓ Video In/Out, Audio In/Out: Use these if you want audio and video to 
go in or out at separate points. Figure 6-4 shows that I am setting a sepa-
rate audio Out point so that the audio from this clip continues to play 
for another five seconds after the video Out point. You might use this 
technique to insert an audio track (or narration that explains the scene), 
while several different video or still images appear on-screen.
 
✓ Unnumbered: If you want to mark only a single spot in the clip, add an 
unnumbered marker. I like to use these to mark the location of visual 
events, which I later match with an audio soundtrack.
 
✓ Next Available Numbered, Other Numbered: Use numbered markers 
if you want to set more than one marker in the same clip. Choose Next 
Available Numbered if you just want Premiere Elements to select a 
number automatically. For example, if you’ve already set markers named 
Marker 1 and Marker 2, Premiere Elements uses the name Marker 3 
when you choose Next Available Numbered. Choose Other Numbered if 
you want to set a specific number yourself.
 
Figure 6-4: 
You can set 
separate 
In and Out 
points for 
audio and

When you right-click the CTI, you see two other options in addition to the Set 
Clip Marker. You can choose Go to Clip Marker or Clear Clip Marker. Choose 
Go to Clip Marker to open a submenu of markers that you have already set. 
Click one of the markers to jump directly to that location.

109
 Chapter 6: Trimming and Editing Video Clips
If you want to delete a marker, right-click the CTI and choose Clear Clip 
Marker. Select an option from the submenu that appears. As you can see, you 
can clear the current marker, all markers, In points and Out points, or spe-
cific numbered markers.
Changing the Speed and 
Duration of Clips
What is a clip, really? When you see a list of clips in Premiere Elements, 
you’re looking at references to actual files on your hard drive. When you set 
markers on clips or perform edits, you’re not editing the original files; you’re 
actually editing the references to those files in Premiere Elements. This is 
important because it leaves the original source file undisturbed for future 
use. It also saves storage space because you don’t have multiple copies of 
the same material all over your hard drive.
You can even duplicate clips without eating up extra disk space. Duplicate 
clips come in handy when you have a really long clip containing a lot of mate-
rial, some of which you might use in different parts of your project. 
To duplicate a clip, right-click it in the Organizer or the Task pane and 
choose Duplicate. A copy of the clip appears. If you want to give the copy a 
more useful name, right-click it and choose Rename.
You can also change the speed or duration of a clip without affecting the 
original source file. The next couple of sections show you how to change the 
duration and speed of clips in Premiere Elements.
Adjusting clip duration
The duration of a clip is determined by the length of time between the In 
and Out points for the clip. For audio or video clips, I usually recommend 
that you adjust the duration of the clip only by setting In and Out points (as 
I describe earlier in this chapter). However, when you are working with still 
images or titles (I explain how to create titles in Chapter 13), you may want 
to change the duration of the clip. You can safely change the duration of a 
title or still image and not worry about playback speed, because the clip isn’t 
moving to begin with. (If you want to change the speed of audio or video 
clips, see the next section in this chapter.)

110
Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
You can set the duration of a still clip by entering a numeric duration value. 
The duration of a still clip determines how long the picture plays when it’s 
inserted in a movie. To adjust the duration of a clip, follow these steps:
 
1. Select a clip in the Task pane.
 
2. Choose Clip➪Time Stretch.
 
 The Time Stretch dialog box appears. As you can see in Figure 6-5, when 
you adjust the duration of a still clip, some options that pertain only to 
audio and video clips (Speed, Reverse, and Audio Pitch) are unavailable.
 
3. Enter a new duration for the clip in the Duration field.
 
 Clip duration is expressed in the same format as timecode, so it looks 
like this:
hours:minutes:seconds:frames
 
 To enter a new duration, either type a new number or click-and-drag left 
or right on the timecode number. As you drag the mouse pointer left, 
the duration decreases. As you drag the mouse pointer right, the dura-
tion increases. 
 
4. Click OK when you’re done.
 
 The clip in Figure 6-5 is set to play for exactly five seconds.
Avoiding repetitive stress injuries with the 
Preferences dialog box
Do you ever feel like you keep repeating your-
self? Do you find yourself performing the same 
redundant tasks? Do you ever get the feeling 
that you do the same thing over and over? And 
again and again? Before you form any habits 
that might lead to a repetitive stress injury, 
try adjusting the default settings in Premiere 
Elements to save yourself a lot of repeated 
effort.
Take still graphics, for example. If you use 
a lot of stills in your movie projects, you may 
find that you adjust the duration repeatedly 
for each still — by the same amount almost 
every time. Premiere Elements has a default 
duration for still graphics, and you can adjust 
that default if you want. To do so, choose 
Edit➪Preferences➪General, and locate the 
Still Image Default Duration field. The default 
duration for a still image is 150 frames, which 
works out to about five seconds in NTSC video, 
or six seconds in PAL video. If that doesn’t 
work for you, simply enter a new number in the 
Default Duration box, using the frame rate of the 
video that you work with as a guide. To find out 
what other Adobe Premiere Elements prefer-
ences can be adjusted, check out Chapter 4.

111
 Chapter 6: Trimming and Editing Video Clips
 
Figure 6-5: 
Set the 
duration of a 
still clip 
by using 
timecode.
 
 
You can also adjust a clip’s duration in the Timeline. See Chapter 7 for more 
on changing the duration of clips in the Timeline.
Changing playback speed
Besides adjusting the duration of a clip, you can also adjust the speed at 
which it plays. Speed adjustments can give you a fast motion or slo-mo effect. 
Before you dismiss speed adjustment as gimmicky, consider some useful 
applications of this feature:
 
✓ Fix holes: You can adjust the length of the clip without reshooting it. If 
you have a specific period of time in your project that a clip must fill, 
but the clip is shorter than the gap, slow the clip down slightly.
 
✓ Fix bad pans: You can use speed adjustments to correct shots that are 
too slow or too fast. For example, if you aren’t happy with the speed at 
which the camera pans across a scene — say, across a landscape — adjust 
the speed of the clip to speed up or slow down the pan as desired.
 
✓ Set the tone: You can use speed adjustments to change the mood or feel 
of a shot. If an action scene doesn’t seem quite as exciting as you would 
like, speed it up just a bit. Conversely, if two lovers are bounding across 
a grassy meadow toward each other’s embrace, slow it down to increase 
the drama.
 
✓ Create an audio effect: You can create interesting voice effects by 
adjusting playback speed of audio clips. A faster speed makes the voice 
sound small and wacky (like Alvin and the Chipmunks), and a slower 
speed makes the voice sound large and ominous (like Darth Vader).
Just be aware of the potential negative effects of speed adjustment. While 
moderate speed adjustments to video may be imperceptible to the eyes 
of most viewers, even slight speed adjustments to audio tracks are almost 
always immediately obvious.

112
Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
Also, you may find that your video doesn’t seem to play smoothly when you 
slow it down or speed it up. When you slow down a clip, Premiere Elements 
must duplicate some frames so the clip still fills the required duration. When 
you speed up a clip, some frames are removed. Choose your speed-change 
percentage carefully to ensure that frames are added or removed evenly. 
Table 6-1 lists percentages that will give reasonably smooth speed changes in 
Premiere Elements. If you plan to change the speed of a clip, use one of these 
percentages for the smoothest possible playback.
Table 6-1 
Safe Speed-Change Percentages for Video Clips
Safe Slow-Motion Speeds
Safe Fast-Motion Speeds
50%
100%
33.33%
200%
25%
300%
20%
400%
16.67%
500%
If you do a little math, you can see a pattern in the speed-change percentages 
in Table 6-1. If you turn all the Safe Slow Motion percentages into ratios, you 
would see that they all start with the number one. The 50% speed gives a 
ratio of 1:2, which means that every single frame turns into two frames when 
Premiere Elements adjusts the speed. With a speed change of 25% (1:4), each 
frame becomes four frames. Likewise, all the Safe Fast-Motion percentages 
end with 1 when converted to ratios. The 200% speed gives a ratio of 2:1, and 
the 300% speed gives a ratio of 3:1.
Adjusting the speed of a clip in Premiere Elements is pretty easy. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Select a clip on which you want to adjust the speed.
 
 You can choose a clip in the Task pane, or one that has already been 
edited into the Timeline. I recommend that you work with a duplicate of 
the original.
 
2. Choose Clip➪Time Stretch.
 
 The Time Stretch dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-6.
 
3. Enter a new percentage number in the Speed field.
 
 To make the clip play at double its original speed, enter 200. To make 
the clip play at half its original speed, enter 50. The duration of the clip 
is adjusted automatically, based on your percentage change. Again, I 
strongly recommend that you use a percentage from Table 6-1.

113
 Chapter 6: Trimming and Editing Video Clips
 
Figure 6-6: 
Changing 
the play-
back speed 
of your clips 
is easy.
 
 
4. If you want the clip to play in reverse, place a check mark next to the 
Reverse Speed option.
 
 This option can be handy if you’re going for a “fast rewind” look for 
the clip.
 
5. Place a check mark next to Maintain Audio Pitch to, er, maintain the 
audio pitch of the clip.
 
 This is another one of those really cool features that sets Premiere 
Elements apart from lesser video-editing programs. If you maintain the 
audio pitch, you can make speed adjustments to video without making 
the accompanying audio sound like Alvin and the Chipmunks or Darth 
Vader (see my earlier comment on this subject). This feature is espe-
cially handy if you want to maintain with a clip ambient sounds such as 
crashing waves or chirping birds. Experiment with this setting, trying 
the clip with and without the Maintain Audio Pitch setting enabled. Play 
the clip each way and see how this option affects the audio.
 
6. Click OK to close the Time Stretch dialog box.
 
7. Play the clip to preview your speed changes.

Making Movies with the Timeline
In This Chapter
▶ Doing simple edits by using the Sceneline
▶ Adding audio and video tracks to the Timeline
▶ Editing clips into the Timeline
▶ Moving clips and deleting blank spaces in the Timeline
▶ Splitting clips
▶ Creating DVD chapter references and other markers
▶ Going back in time and undoing mistakes
C
onsider all the tools of the trade for a painter: brushes, scrapers, a pal-
ette, containers of paint, and cleaning supplies. All these tools are nec-
essary, but ultimately the painter’s entire work centers around the canvas, 
where the tools are put to use to create a work of art. 
The Timeline is your canvas in Premiere Elements. The other parts of 
Premiere Elements — the Task pane, the Monitor, the Capture window, and 
others — all serve crucial purposes, and that purpose is to put together 
movies in the Timeline. This chapter shows you how to turn your clips into 
movies worth watching, using the Premiere Elements Timeline. Here I show 
you how to insert clips in the Timeline, move clips around and modify them, 
and how to insert DVD chapter references and other markers in the Timeline. 
I also show you how to undo mistakes that you make in the Timeline — don’t 
feel bad; it happens to all of us — or even revert to previous versions of a 
project. 
The Premiere Elements Timeline is indeed a powerful canvas, but sometimes 
you may find that you don’t need all that power. If you just want to throw 
some clips together and output a basic movie fast, Premiere Elements also 
offers the Sceneline. The Sceneline doesn’t allow a lot of fine-tuning of your 
movies, but it is easy and fast to use. The first part of this chapter shows you 
how to use the Sceneline rather than the Timeline. 

116
Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
Working Quickly on the Sceneline
Remember all that spare time you used to have? If you’re like me and free 
time on your calendar is a distant memory, you’ll appreciate the Sceneline. 
The Premiere Elements Timeline offers a lot of editing power, but if you’re in 
a hurry, the Sceneline is quicker and easier to use. 
Even if you aren’t in a hurry, you may find that the Sceneline is a good place 
to start any movie project. You can use the Sceneline to pick and choose 
which clips you want to use in your movies, and then fine-tune those clips 
later by using the Timeline. When you add clips to the Sceneline, they are 
automatically added to the Timeline. The next couple of sections show you 
how to make movies in just a few minutes by using the Sceneline. 
 
The Sceneline and Timeline share the horizontal space at the bottom of the 
Premiere Elements program window. You can view either the Sceneline or the 
Timeline, but not both. Click the Sceneline button in the upper-left corner of 
the Timeline/Sceneline area to reveal the Sceneline. 
Dropping clips on the Sceneline
To start using the Sceneline, first capture or import video clips as described 
in Chapter 5. When you have clips to work with, click the Sceneline button in 
the upper-left corner of the Timeline/Sceneline window. Adding clips to the 
Sceneline is pretty straightforward:
 
✓ Add clips automatically by using InstantMovie. I show how to use 
InstantMovie in Chapter 1. 
 
✓ Click-and-drag clips to the Sceneline, as shown in Figure 7-1. On the 
Task pane, click the Organize tab and then click the Media button. Drag 
clips from the Task pane and drop them in the Sceneline in the order 
you want scenes to appear in the finished movie. 
 
✓ Click-and-drag clips between existing clips to insert them. You can also 
click-and-drag clips left or right in the Sceneline to change the order in 
which they will play in the finished movie. 
After you add clips to the Sceneline, click the Play button in the Monitor to 
preview the movie. If you’re happy with the results, you can export your fin-
ished movie to DVD or the Internet as described in Part IV of this book. If you 
want to trim some clips or make other changes, see the next section.

Editing Sceneline clips
If you plan to do a lot of editing in your movie, the Sceneline isn’t the best 
place to do it. The best place for editing is the Timeline. But if you have only 
one or two clips you want to trim, you can do it in the Sceneline. Here’s how:
 
1. In the Sceneline, click the clip you want to trim to select it. 
 
 The selected clip appears in the Monitor and has a blue border in the 
Sceneline. A small time ruler appears at the bottom of the Monitor. Black 
lines indicate the beginning (In point) and end (Out point) of the current 
clip (see Figure 7-2). The Current Time Indicator (CTI) shows the current 
playback location. 
 
2. Click-and-drag an edit point in the Monitor to trim the clip. 
 
 To trim the beginning of the clip, click-and-drag the edit point at the 
In point. To trim material from the end of the clip, click-and-drag 
the edit point at the Out point. In Figure 7-2, I am moving the edit 
point at the In point to trim some video from the beginning of the clip.

You can also quickly add transitions between clips in the Sceneline. Simply 
right-click one of the arrows between clips in the Sceneline, and then select a 
transition from the menu and submenus that appear. See Chapter 9 for more 
on working with transitions. 
Making Sense of the Timeline
As I mention in Chapter 3, video is considered a linear medium because when 
you watch video, one scene follows another from start to finish. You can 
think of a movie as being laid out along a line through time. When you create 
a movie in Adobe Premiere Elements, the Timeline is the primary tool you 
use to assemble the various elements of your movie. Here you lay out all the 
different scenes and portions of the movie in order from start to finish (as 
shown in Figure 7-3).

As you can see in Figure 7-3, the Timeline shows a lot of useful information 
and is easy to navigate. Key features of the Timeline include
 
✓ Track headers: Tracks are layered atop each other, with video and 
audio tracks paired together, as shown in Figure 7-3. Additional audio 
tracks for narration and soundtrack music can be found at the bottom 
of the Timeline. Scroll bars on the right side of the Timeline allow you 
to scroll through the various tracks. Each video and audio track has a 
header on the left side of the Timeline. The track headers remain vis-
ible even as you scroll the Timeline. Track headers contain important 
controls (described in the following section). The Premiere Elements 
Timeline can have up to 99 separate video tracks, as well as 99 unique 
audio tracks. I show how to add Timeline tracks later in this chapter.
 
✓ Ruler and CTI: Your current location in the Timeline is indicated by the 
CTI (Current Timecode Indicator) and Timeline ruler. When you play the 
Timeline, the CTI moves to show your location. The CTI’s current time-
code is shown in the bottom-left corner of the Monitor window.
 
✓ Work Area bar: The light gray bar just below the Timeline ruler is the 
Work Area bar. This bar covers your entire project by default, but you 
can resize the Work Area bar so that it only covers part of your project. I 
show how to do this — and explain why you might do this — later in this 
chapter.
 
✓ Zoom and scroll controls: Use the zoom slider near the top of the 
Timeline to zoom the view in or out. You can also use the plus (+) and 
minus (–) keys on your keyboard to zoom in or out. Use the scroll bar at 
the bottom of the Timeline to scroll left or right.

120
Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
Adding and renaming Timeline tracks
Tracks are perhaps the most important feature of the Premiere Elements 
Timeline because they allow tremendous versatility and control over the 
sound and pictures in your project. For example, one audio track might con-
tain the sound that goes with a certain video clip, a second audio track may 
contain background music, and a third may contain voice-over narration. 
With multiple video tracks, you can perform special compositing effects, 
picture-in-picture effects, overlay titles, and more. 
Adobe Premiere Elements allows you to have up to 99 separate video tracks, 
as well as 99 audio tracks. Although it is difficult to imagine what you might 
do with 99 video tracks, it’s definitely better to have too many tracks than 
not enough. Many other affordable video-editing programs give you only one 
or two tracks to work with, severely limiting your creative control over movie 
projects. Premiere Elements is limited only by your imagination. 
If you need more tracks in your Timeline than those already present, you can 
add them by following these steps:
 
1. Choose Timeline➪Add Tracks.
 
 The Add Tracks dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7-4.
 
2. Enter the number of tracks you want to add under Video Tracks or 
Audio Tracks (as appropriate).
 
3. Choose an option from the Placement menu.
 
 In most cases, you’ll want to just stick with After Last Track.
 
4. Click OK to close the dialog box and add your tracks.
You can also add, delete, or rename tracks by right-clicking a blank area of 
any track header in the Timeline. You may find it handy to give some tracks 
more descriptive names, to better reflect what you put in that track. Track 
names won’t appear in the final movie, so you can choose any name that you 
find useful as you edit.

You can 
have up to 
99 video 
and 99 
audio tracks

121
 Chapter 7: Making Movies with the Timeline
 
Do you have empty, unused tracks taking up space in your Timeline? If so, 
right-click a track header and choose Delete Empty Tracks from the menu that 
appears. Only empty tracks can be deleted. If a track won’t delete itself, scroll 
back and forth through the project to check the entire length of that stubborn 
track. Chances are there’s a clip hiding somewhere on that track.
Working with the Work Area bar
As you look at the Timeline, you’ll notice a light gray bar near the top of the 
Timeline, just underneath the Timeline ruler. This bar is called the Work Area 
bar, and by default it spans the entire length of your movie project. However, 
you can shrink the Work Area bar so that it covers only part of your project, 
as shown in Figure 7-5. 
When you resize the Work Area bar so that it covers only part of your proj-
ect, Premiere Elements only renders effects, transitions, and other edits that 
are covered by the Work Area bar. You may want to shrink the Work Area 
bar if you want to export only a portion of your movie project, for example. 
As I describe in Chapters 14 through 16, when you export your movie project, 
you can choose to export the entire project or just the area spanned by the 
Work Area bar. 
To change the size of the Work Area bar, click-and-drag on either end of the 
Work Area bar. After you adjust the Work Area bar, hover the mouse pointer 
over the Work Area bar to view details like the new duration, as shown in 
Figure 7-5.

Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
Using Timeline tools
Somewhere in a garage, closet, basement, or shed, you probably have a tool-
box full of tools. In Premiere Elements, you find editing tools on a toolbar in 
the upper-left corner of the Timeline, as shown in Figure 7-6. To use a tool, 
simply click it on the toolbar. The available tools are:
 
✓ Selection tool: Use this tool to select clips for click-and-drag edits, or 
to perform ripple edits (described later in this chapter) to lengthen or 
shorten clips. You can also activate the Selection tool by pressing V on 
your keyboard.
 
✓ Time Stretch tool: Use this to change the playback speed of a clip. See 
the section on changing clip speed later in this chapter. To activate the 
Time Stretch tool, click the Time Stretch toolbar button, shown in Figure 
7-6, or press X on your keyboard.
 
✓ Properties: Click a clip in the Timeline to select it, and then click the 
Properties toolbar button. Important clip controls and properties 
appear in the Organizer. These controls and properties are used for vari-
ous advanced edits described throughout this book.
 
✓ Smart Trim mode: I hesitate to call other programs “dumb,” but 
Smart Trim mode is one of the features that definitely makes Premiere 
Elements a smart choice. Smart Trim quickly identifies which portions 
of your clips are most interesting and have the best image quality. 
Clips are then trimmed — either manually by you or automatically by 
Premiere Elements — down to just the best video. I show how to use 
Smart Trim mode later in this chapter.
 
✓ Motion Tracking mode: This feature identifies moving subjects in 
video, and then tracks the motion of those subjects. The applications 
for motion tracking are as limitless as your creativity. You could use 
motion tracking to put a clip art speech bubble over a person, cover up 
an airplane flying across an otherwise unblemished sky, or apply special 
effects to moving objects. I show how to use Motion Tracking mode in 
Chapter 12.
 
When you perform edits in the Timeline, the mouse cursor changes to show 
the tool that is currently active. Sometimes you may see a red slash across 
the mouse pointer when you try to perform some edits. If you see a red slash 
on the mouse pointer, this means you can’t use the currently selected tool on 
whichever clip happens to be under the pointer.

Adding Clips to the Timeline
Before you start assembling stuff into the Timeline to make your movie, make 
sure that you’ve marked In points and Out points for your clips. (Chapter 6 
explains how.) After you’ve completed that process, you can start putting 
clips in the Timeline. The following sections show you how to add clips to the 
Timeline, and then figure out what to do with those clips after they’re there.
 
The bottom portion of the Premiere Elements program window toggles 
between the Sceneline (described earlier in this chapter) and the Timeline. 
Click the Timeline button in the upper-left corner of the Timeline/Sceneline 
window to reveal the Timeline.
Inserting clips
A lot of the work you do in Adobe Premiere Elements requires you to simply 
drag and drop items onto new locations. So it won’t surprise you that adding 
clips to the Timeline requires the same technique. After you have set In 
and Out points for a clip, the easiest way to add that clip to the Timeline 
is to simply drag and drop it from the Task pane to the Timeline, as shown 
in Figure 7-7. You can drop clips on the Timeline before setting In and Out 
points, but I find it easier to set those points first.

124

tab to the

Drop clip in a Timeline track
Premiere Elements provides two other methods for placing a clip in the 
Timeline as well. These editing methods — called insert and overlay — are 
usually more precise and efficient ways to place clips in the Timeline at 
exactly the desired location. Each type of edit is a little different:
 
✓ Insert edit: The incoming clip is inserted at the current location of the 
CTI (Current Time Indicator). Clips that fall after the CTI are moved over 
to make room. Figure 7-8 shows an insert edit. I inserted a clip showing 
some people between two landscape shots.
 
✓ Overlay edit: The incoming clip is inserted at the current location of 
the CTI, but instead of moving subsequent material over, the new clip 
simply replaces the old material. Figure 7-9 shows an overlay edit. My 
close-up shot of people sledding has replaced a portion of the wide land-
scape shot. A cutaway scene such as this is a good time to use overlay 
edits.

125

Figure 7-9:

An important thing to keep in mind about insert and overlay edits is that in 
Premiere Elements they can only insert clips into the Video 1 track. To per-
form an insert or overlay edit, follow these steps:
 
1. Use the Preview window to set In and Out points for a clip (as 
described in Chapter 6).

126
Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
 
2. Place the Timeline CTI at the exact location where you want the 
incoming clip to start.
 
 Use the left- and right-arrow keys to fine-tune the location of the CTI, one 
frame at a time. Alternatively, press Page Up to move to the preceding 
edit point in the Timeline, or press Page Down to move to the next edit 
point.
 
3. Click once in the Preview window to make that window active.
 
4. Choose Clip➪Insert or Clip➪Overlay to perform an insert or overlay 
edit.
 
 The clip is inserted into track Video 1 of the Timeline.
 
You can also quickly perform insert or overlay edits by using keyboard short-
cuts. To do an insert edit, press the comma (,) key. To perform an overlay 
edit, press the period (.) key.
The clip is added to the Timeline. Using this method of placing clips in the 
Timeline is usually more precise than dragging and dropping because you 
can pick an exact location for the edit by using the CTI. Dragging and drop-
ping clips can seem downright clumsy by comparison.
 
Premiere Elements analyzes your clips for potential quality problems, 
such as poor lighting or shaky video. If you add a clip to the Timeline and 
Premiere Elements thinks your clip could be improved, you are asked if 
you want to automatically fix quality problems. If you click Yes, Premiere 
Elements automatically applies fixes such as image stabilization or color 
correction. I describe how to improve your video images — either manually 
or automatically — in Chapter 10.
Moving clips in the Timeline
After you have some clips in the Timeline, it’s time to move them around. 
Moving a clip is so easy that you’ve probably already figured out how: You 
simply click-and-drag clips to new locations. You can drag clips back and 
forth in a track, or drag them to a different track altogether.
 
If you’re trying to move a clip in very small increments, you may get frustrated 
by the tendency of clips to snap to the nearest adjacent clip edge or to the 
CTI. To disable this snapping, choose Timeline➪Snap to remove the check 
mark. This disables the snap-to-edges feature. Click Timeline➪Snap again to 
enable snap-to-edges.

127
 Chapter 7: Making Movies with the Timeline
Performing ripple edits
No hip waders required. Honest. One of the changes you can make to clips 
in the Timeline is to make them longer or shorter. This kind of edit is called 
a ripple edit and basically just changes the In point or Out point for the clip. 
Consider the diagram in Figure 7-10. I want to trim material off the end of Clip 
B, so I perform a ripple edit on the Out point for Clip B.
 
Figure 7-10: 
A ripple edit 
changes the 
duration of a 
clip.

You can trim a clip to a smaller size by using a ripple edit, or you can extend 
the length of the clip. However, if you want to make the clip longer, the origi-
nal source clip must contain sufficient material. For example, suppose you 
started out with a clip that was five seconds long. In the Monitor window, 
you cut one second off the end of the clip before editing it into the Timeline. 
Using a ripple edit, you can add some or all of that second you trimmed off, 
but nothing more. To perform a ripple edit, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose the Selection tool in the Timeline.
 
2. Hover the mouse pointer over the edit point of the clip you want to 
ripple.
 
 The mouse pointer changes to a bracket facing toward the affected clip.
 
3. Click-and-drag the edit point.
 
 As you drag the edit point, a ToolTip appears next to the mouse pointer 
showing how much material you are adding or removing.

128
Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
Deleting gaps in the Timeline
As you move, delete, and reorganize clips, you’ll wind up with gaps in your 
Timeline. You may be tempted to try filling the gaps by using any number 
of difficult methods: dragging over each subsequent item in the Timeline 
(a time-consuming endeavor that can mess up any advanced edits you’ve 
already made), pecking around for an alternate clip, or, inserting a black 
matte with the word “Intermission” splashed across it (yeah, you meant to 
leave the space blank).
A better idea is to simply delete the Timeline gap and automatically shift all 
subsequent material ove r. Ahh, genius! The great thing about deleting gaps 
is that Premiere Elements can automatically shift all clips in all tracks. This 
is important if you’ve done a lot of editing later in the Timeline that involves 
titles, compositing, or other effects that involve multiple Timeline tracks. 
To properly delete a gap, right-click the undesired void in the Timeline and 
choose Delete and Close Gap from the little menu that appears, as shown in 
Figure 7-11. If you don’t like right-clicking, click the void once with your left 
mouse button, and then choose Edit➪Delete and Close Gap.
Why did slip, slide, and roll edits slip, 
slide, and roll away?
If you have used Adobe Premiere Pro or an 
earlier version of Premiere such as Adobe 
Premiere 6, you may be familiar with several 
other editing methods in addition to ripple edits. 
Other editing methods include roll edits, slip 
edits, and slide edits. Unfortunately, as part of 
Adobe’s efforts to simplify Premiere Elements, 
these editing methods were removed. 
Three-point edits and four-point edits didn’t 
make the cut either. These editing methods 
are favored by many video-editing profession-
als who edit video on a daily basis and need 
advanced editing tools and features to work 
efficiently. I’ve always been a big fan of three-
point edits myself, but I have to admit that they 
can be a little complicated to do at first. If you’re 
a video-editing professional and you absolutely 
need to be able to do three-point edits, roll 
edits, and other such techniques, you’ll need to 
step up to Premiere Pro.

 Chapter 7: Making Movies with the Timeline

Selecting clips in the Timeline
Most of your editing is probably done one clip at a time. You can also select 
and work with multiple clips in the Timeline, a feature that often comes in 
handy. For example, if you want to select a portion of your movie and move 
it somewhere else, you can select all the clips in that section and then click-
and-drag them to the new location. Premiere Elements gives you two meth-
ods for selecting multiple clips:
 
✓ Hold down the Shift key on your keyboard and click individual clips to 
select them. This method works best when selecting noncontiguous 
clips. Premiere Elements differs from other Windows programs, which 
usually use the Ctrl key for selecting noncontiguous items. 
 
✓ Click-and-drag a box around the clips you want to select, as shown in 
Figure 7-12. This method works best when selecting contiguous clips.

Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
Splitting clips
If you want to buy a soft drink from a vending machine, a $20 bill is probably 
too large a denomination. You’ll need to make change. Likewise, you’ll some-
times find that you need to make change (so to speak) with clips in Premiere 
Elements. To split a clip in the Timeline, follow these steps:
 
1. Place the CTI on the exact frame where you want to split a clip.
 
 You can use the left- and right-arrow keys to move forward and back a 
single frame at a time.
 
2. Click the clip you want to split to select it.
 
 The selected clip turns purple in the Timeline.
 
3. Click the Split Clip button in the Monitor window.
 
 The Split Clip button is in the lower-right corner of the Monitor and it 
looks like scissors. What was a single clip just a moment ago is now two 
clips, as shown in Figure 7-13. 
 
 If you’re a fan of keyboard shortcuts, press Ctrl+K to quickly split the 
currently selected clip at the CTI. If you prefer to use menu commands, 
choose Timeline ➪Split Clip.

Changing playback speed
If you watched much TV in the 1970s, you probably remember a series 
called The Six Million Dollar Man. The show revolved around a former test 
pilot named Steve Austin (played by Lee Majors) who, after a horrific plane 
crash, was rebuilt by using cybernetic enhancements (we assume that those 
enhancements cost about $6 million, including installation). The cybernet-
ics gave Steve super strength and speed, abilities he used to fight crime and 

131
 Chapter 7: Making Movies with the Timeline
battle the forces of evil. Several times in each episode, Steve Austin would 
run somewhere. In order to show that Steve was running inhumanly fast, we 
would see the hero running . . . in slow motion. (It seemed to make sense at 
the time.)
Video technology has progressed a great deal since the ’70s, but few com-
puter-generated special effects provide the same dramatic effect as slo-mo 
video and some well-chosen music. Changing the speed of your own clips in 
Adobe Premiere Elements is an effective (yet often overlooked) visual effect 
you can apply to video. You can adjust the speed of clips in the Timeline to 
create your own fast- or slow-motion effects. 
Premiere Elements gives you two methods for changing the speed of clips in 
the Timeline. The old-fashioned way involves entering numbers in a dialog 
box, like this:
 
1. Select a clip in the Timeline for which you want to adjust the playback 
speed.
 
2. Choose Clip➪Time Stretch.
 
 The Time Stretch dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-14.
 
3. Enter a new percentage in the Speed field.
 
 If you want to slow the clip down, enter a rate that is below 100%. If you 
want to speed it up, enter a rate above 100%. Leave the Duration field 
alone for now.
 
4. Click OK.
The other method for changing playback speed is to use the Time Stretch 
tool in the Timeline. This tool is located in the upper-left corner of the 
Timeline, next to the Razor tool. Click this tool and then click-and-drag on the 
edges of clips in the Timeline. As you stretch and squeeze clips with the Time 
Stretch tool, you change their playback speed. This method doesn’t give you 
precise control over the rate of the time change, but it does come in handy if 
you have a specific block of time to fill. 
If you ever decide to restore the clip to its original playback speed, simply 
open the Time Stretch dialog box, described earlier in this section, and reset 
the Speed to 100%. 
 
You may need to experiment a bit with the rate that you choose. In Figure 
7-14, I cut the speed of the clip in half to 50%. You may find that some speed 
changes result in rough or jerky playback. (See Chapter 6 for specific recom-
mendations on speed changes that should provide smoother playback.)

Using Smart Trim mode
You’ve probably noticed by now that video editing can eat up a lot of your 
time. Sure, fine-tuning your movie masterpieces is fun, but as editing hours 
turn into days, your personal hygiene suffers, your boss leaves messages 
wondering when you’ll be coming back to work, and friends express concern 
about your “Video-editing problem.” 
Smart Trim mode is a new feature in Premiere Elements that helps you make 
better movies without letting the video-editing process take over your life. 
Smart Trim identifies portions of your video clips that have quality prob-
lems, and then recommends which sections of bad quality video should be 
trimmed. You can even let Premiere Elements do the trimming for you if 
you’re in a hurry. To use Smart Trim mode:
 
1. Click the Smart Trim mode button on the top of the Timeline. 
 
 Blue crosshatch boxes appear over portions of video that have quality 
problems, as shown in Figure 7-15. These areas can be trimmed manu-
ally by you, or automatically by Smart Trim.
 
 Smart Trim mode works only on clips that have been analyzed by 
Premiere Elements. See Chapter 5 for details on how to analyze clips 
when you capture or import video. 
 
2. Hover the mouse pointer over a trim area to see a summary of quality 
problems.
 
 In Figure 7-15, Smart Trim has identified a portion of video that is 
blurred, shaky, and has poor contrast. 
 
3. Preview the video identified by Smart Trim.
 
 Smart Trim is smart, but it isn’t intelligent. Even though some video may 
have quality problems, you should review the video to make sure that it 
doesn’t show something really important. Hastily shot video of Bigfoot 
may be shaky and blurry, but if that’s your only Sasquatch footage, you 
probably want to keep it. 

133
 Chapter 7: Making Movies with the Timeline
 
4. Right-click a trim area, and then choose Keep to keep the video, or 
choose Trim to get rid of it.
 
 If you choose to keep the video, the blue crosshatch disappears and the 
video clip remains intact. If you choose to trim the video, the trim area 
is removed from the Timeline.

Smart Trim Options
Suggested trim area
You can fine-tune Smart Trim if you feel that the trim suggestions are too 
aggressive (or not aggressive enough). Follow these steps:
 
1. With Smart Trim mode enabled, click the Smart Trim Options button 
at the top of the Monitor window. 
 
2. In the Smart Trim Options dialog box that appears, shown in 
Figure 7-16, adjust the options to your liking as follows:
 
• Quality level: Use the Quality Level slider to increase or decrease 
how sensitive Smart Trim is to quality issues. 
 
• Interest level: Smart Trim doesn’t just look for quality problems. It 
can also analyze clips based on content. For example, if your video 

134
Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
clip starts with an empty stage that is eventually filled by people, 
Smart Trim can identify the less interesting parts of the clip (the 
empty stage shots) and recommend them for trimming. 
 
• Mode: Finally, choose either Manual or Automatic under Mode. If 
you choose Automatic, Smart Trim automatically trims clips for 
you. I recommend that you use Automatic Smart Trimming only 
when you’re in a hurry. 
 
3. Click Save to close Smart Trim Options.

Using Timeline Markers
In Chapter 6 I show how to add markers to clips. You can also add markers to 
the Timeline. Markers can be extremely helpful as you work in the Timeline. 
You can use markers as reference points for key events, visual indicators as 
you edit, or cues for items such as Web links or DVD scene references. 
Clip markers that were added to a source clip before it was added to the 
Timeline appear directly on that clip in the Timeline. Markers that are added 
only to the Timeline appear on the Timeline ruler, as shown in Figure 7-17.

Markers can serve various purposes. In Figure 7-17, I have added markers to 
indicate where specific visual events occur. You can use markers as refer-
ences for later editing. For example, if you decide to add some audio and you 
need to time the audio to match certain visual events, you can use Timeline 
markers to line up the audio and video. To add a marker to the Timeline, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Move the CTI to the location where you want to place a marker.
 
 If necessary, use the left- and right-arrow keys on your keyboard to 
move frame by frame to the correct location.
 
2. Choose Timeline➪Set Timeline Marker➪ and then choose a marker 
from the submenu that appears.
 
 You can choose to set an unnumbered marker, the next available num-
bered marker, or choose Other Numbered and create a marker with a 
specific number. 
 
 The only real difference between numbered and unnumbered markers 
is the way they appear on the Timeline ruler, so it’s a matter of personal 
preference whether you use numbered markers, unnumbered markers, 
or a combination of both.
The marker now appears on the Timeline ruler. Pretty easy, huh? If you ever 
want to get rid of a marker, simply choose Timeline➪Clear Timeline Markers 
and choose an option from the submenu to sentence a marker to the elec-
tronic ether. Choose Timeline➪Go to Timeline Marker to quickly jump to a 
specific marker.
Using disc menu markers
Premiere Elements includes a special kind of marker called a disc menu 
marker, and as the name implies, these markers are designed to be used in 
movies that will be recorded to DVD or Blu-Ray discs. They can also serve as 
chapter markers if you export your movie in QuickTime or Windows Media 
format. Menu markers come in handy for several reasons:
 
✓ When you create a DVD or Blu-Ray disc layout in Premiere Elements, the 
Scene Selection portion of the disc menu uses the scene references that 
you create.
 
✓ When you watch the disc in almost any DVD or Blu-Ray player, you 
can quickly jump from scene to scene by pressing the Next Scene and 
Previous Scene buttons on the player’s remote control. This feature also 
works for QuickTime and Windows Media videos. 

136
Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
 
✓ You can use menu markers to automatically stop playback or return the 
viewer to the disc menu. 
 
✓ Menu markers serve as visual milestones between major scenes on the 
Premiere Elements Timeline. 
Creating menu markers
You can create menu markers manually. I recommend creating menu markers 
at the beginning of major events or sections of your movie. To create a menu 
marker, follow these steps:
 
1. Place the CTI where you want to place a marker. 
 
2. Choose Disc➪Set Menu Marker.
 
 A Menu Marker dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-18.
 
3. In the Menu Marker dialog box, enter a name for the marker in the 
Name field. 
 
 This name should be simple and in plain language, because viewers will 
see this scene name in the disc’s scene selection menu.
 
4. Choose a type from the Marker Type menu. 
 
• A scene marker is the most common type of menu marker and 
simply marks the beginning of a new scene. 
 
• A main menu marker is similar to a scene marker, but it suggests a 
more important location. Also, when you use this kind of marker, 
Premiere Elements places a button linking to this marker in the 
disc’s main menu (as opposed to placing it in the scene selection 
menu). Some DVD players call the main menu the Title menu. 
 
 Use Main Menu markers if your movie project actually contains 
several unique “mini” movies that are meant to be viewed 
separately. 
 
• A Stop marker is usually placed at the end of a movie or wherever 
you want playback to stop and the main menu to reappear.
 
5. Select a thumbnail image for the marker by clicking and dragging left 
or right on the timecode under the Thumbnail Offset control until you 
see a scene that would make an appropriate thumbnail.
 
 The disc’s scene selection menu includes thumbnail images for each 
scene, and by default, the thumbnail is always the first frame of the 
scene. Often, the first frame of a scene doesn’t provide a good visual 
summation of the contents of the scene. In Figure 7-18, I have offset the 
thumbnail by 46 seconds.

Automatically generating menu markers
If you’re in a hurry, you can let Premiere Elements automatically generate 
menu markers for you. To do so, choose Disc➪Generate Menu Markers. 
The Automatically Set Menu Scene Markers dialog box appears, as shown in 
Figure 7-19. You have several options:
 
✓ At Each Scene: This option sets a marker at every scene. In most cases, I 
don’t recommend this option, because creating a menu marker for every 
single clip in your movie is probably overkill. Choose this option only if 
your movie consists primarily of a few long, unedited clips.
 
✓ Every x Minutes: You can automatically generate markers at specific 
time intervals. Use this option if your movie contains several hours of 
riveting footage of grass growing or paint drying.
 
✓ Total Markers: If you want to quickly create a few markers — say, five or 
six — choose this option and enter a number. Premiere Elements auto-
matically creates markers and spaces them evenly.
 
✓ Clear Existing Menu Markers: Place a check mark next to this option if 
you want to get rid of the markers that you created earlier. Only do this 
if you know that the markers you created earlier are worthless.
Click OK to close the dialog box and automatically generate DVD markers.

Undoing Mistakes
Have you ever wished for a second chance to go back and undo life’s mis-
takes? With Premiere Elements, going back in time is easy! If you make a mis-
take while editing your movie, you can quickly undo the mistake by choosing 
Edit➪Undo. The Edit menu lists the last action that was performed next to 
Undo so you know exactly what you’re undoing. You can also quickly undo 
an action by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Z.
Did you change your mind again? Perhaps that “mistake” wasn’t such a bad 
thing after all. If you want to redo the mistake that you just undid, choose 
Edit➪Redo (or press Ctrl+Shift+Z).
In addition to the beloved Undo/Redo commands, Premiere Elements offers 
two additional tools to help you undo mistakes. The History panel displays a 
complete editing history of your project, and Premiere Elements also offers 
the ability to revert back to an earlier version of a project. 
Using the History panel
One of the more useful features in Premiere Elements is the History panel, as 
shown in Figure 7-20. The History panel is hidden by default, but you can dis-
play it at any time by choosing Window➪History.
The Premiere Elements History panel is even more forgiving than the Undo/
Redo feature. It shows you a list of the last 100 edits you’ve made, in order, 
with the most recent edit at the bottom of the list. To move back in history, 
click an item in the list and then click the Trash bin icon at the bottom of 
the panel. When you click OK to confirm the action, you undo the selected 
item — and all actions following it. If you want to clear the history, click the 
right-facing arrow in the upper-right corner of the History panel and then 
choose Clear History.

Reverting to previous versions
Sometimes your creative juices flow like a river and every edit you make just 
enhances the magic of your movies. Other times it seems like every change 
causes a train wreck. If you’ve ever said to yourself, “This movie looked better 
before I started editing today,” then the Premiere Elements Revert feature is 
here to help. To quickly get rid of all the edits you have made during the cur-
rent session, choose File➪Revert. When you click Yes to confirm the action, 
every edit you made since the last time you saved the project is discarded. 
The only problem with the Revert option is that if you recently chose 
File➪Save to save your work, you may not be able to revert back very far. 
Fortunately, the Auto-Save feature may be able to help: 
 
1. Choose File➪Open Project.
 
2. In the Open Project dialog box, double-click the Adobe Premiere 
Elements Auto-Save folder to open it.
 
 If you don’t see this folder, choose your Documents folder in the Look 
In menu and then navigate to Adobe\Premiere Elements\8.0\Adobe 
Premiere Elements Auto-Save.
 
3. Locate the backed-up .prel file for your current project, and then 
click it to select that file. 
 
 Premiere Elements numbers auto-save files sequentially. If your proj-
ect is named “SuperMovie,” you should see auto-save files called 
“SuperMovie-1,” “SuperMovie-2,” and so on. Higher numbers represent 
more recent versions. 
 
4. Click Open to open the auto-saved project.
If the version that opens isn’t the one you’re looking for, repeat the steps 
above and open an earlier version of the same project.

Adding Sound to Your Movies
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding audio fundamentals
▶ Recording good-quality audio
▶ Working with audio in the Premiere Elements Timeline
▶ Syncing your video to the beat of the music
▶ Making the best use of audio effects and transitions
M
ost people think of movies as just moving pictures. When you edit 
your video clips together in a movie project, you probably spend 
most of your time working with the visuals by placing video clips in the 
Timeline, adding transitions, and even using a special effect or two. The 
audio portion of a movie is, sadly, often given the afterthought treatment.
Fortunately, you are reading this chapter, which means that you care about 
audio and you know that it matters. Many video experts claim that audiences 
are more forgiving of flaws and mistakes in video images, while poor-quality 
audio is immediately noticeable and off-putting. This speaks volumes (pun 
intended) about the importance of audio. 
If you really want to create high-quality, well-rounded movies, you need to 
spend time tweaking audio levels, smoothing audio transitions between clips, 
and maybe adding narration or a musical soundtrack. This chapter intro-
duces you to the basics of audio and shows you how to work with audio in 
your Premiere Elements projects. I also show you how to use the great audio 
tools that come with Premiere Elements. Those tools include SmartSound, 
which automatically generates royalty-free soundtrack music to match your 
project, as well as a beat-detecting tool that automatically synchronizes 
video clips to music beats. Another cool feature is called SmartMixer, which 
automatically adjusts the volume of different tracks to make sure that nar-
ration or other important audio isn’t drowned out by a soundtrack or back-
ground audio. 

142
Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
What Is Audio?
Consider how audio affects the feel of a video program. Honking car horns on 
a busy street, crashing surf and calling seagulls at a beach, a howling wolf on 
the moors: These sounds help identify a place as quickly as images can, if not 
quicker. If a picture is worth a thousand words, well-done audio can be worth 
a thousand pictures.
Understanding sampling rates
For more than a century, humans have been recording sound waves by using 
analog devices, ranging from wax cylinders to magnetic tapes. But nowadays 
most audio is recorded digitally, just as with many modern video recordings. 
Because a digital recording can only contain specific values, it must approxi-
mate a continuous stream of sound. A digital recording device samples a 
sound many times per second. The more samples per second, the more 
closely the recording approximates the live sound.
The number of samples per second is called the sampling rate. As you might 
expect, a higher sampling rate provides better recording quality. CD audio 
typically has a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz — that’s 44,100 samples per second — 
and most digital camcorders record at a sampling rate of 48 kHz. DVD movies 
also use an audio sampling rate of 48 kHz.
When you create a new project in Premiere Elements, the project always has 
a sample rate of 48 kHz, but when you export your project, you can some-
times choose a lower sample rate.
 
You may have to use a lower sample rate when exporting a movie for the Web 
because a small file size is usually more important than DVD-quality audio, 
especially when you’re dealing with iffy and often-changing Internet connec-
tion rates. Higher audio sampling rates during export usually mean much 
larger movie files.
Delving into bit depth
A term you’ll hear bandied about in audio editing is bit depth. The quality of 
an audio recording is affected by the number of samples per second, as well 
as the amount of information (or bit depth) in each of those samples. More 
bits equal more information. Many digital recorders and camcorders offer 
a choice between 12-bit and 16-bit audio; set your camcorder to the 16-bit 
audio setting whenever possible.

143
 Chapter 8: Adding Sound to Your Movies
Conforming audio
 
When you first import audio into Adobe Premiere Elements — whether 
you’re importing music from a CD or capturing audio and video from a DV 
tape — Premiere Elements conforms the audio to match the audio settings 
of your project. For example, when you start a new project in Premiere 
Elements, it always has an audio sample rate of 48 kHz (see Chapter 4 for 
more on starting a new project). But suppose you want to import audio 
from a music CD, which has a sample rate of 44.1 kHz. When you import 
that audio, Premiere Elements automatically converts the CD audio to 48 
kHz (the sample rate of your project).
When you first import audio that doesn’t conform to the project, Premiere 
Elements automatically starts creating conformed audio files. Conformed 
audio serves two important purposes:
 
✓ Audio quality remains consistent throughout your project.
 
✓ Conformed audio files are essentially rendered audio files, meaning that 
audio effects and other edits can be previewed in real time.
You may notice that some audio files won’t play immediately after you 
import or capture them. That’s because Premiere Elements isn’t done con-
forming the audio. The process happens quickly, so you shouldn’t have to 
wait long. 
 
Conformed audio files are almost always huge, using up a lot of disk space. 
For example, when I recently imported a three-minute MP3 file, the resulting 
conformed audio file was 70MB, even though the original MP3 file was less 
than 3MB. If you’re trying to clean up old files and recover some disk space, 
you may want to delete the conformed audio files left over from old, finished 
projects. Happily, if you decide to work on that project again later, Premiere 
Elements can automatically regenerate conformed audio files.
Making Better Audio Recordings
Recording great-quality audio is no simple matter. Professional recording stu-
dios spend thousands or even millions of dollars to set up acoustically supe-
rior sound rooms. You probably don’t have that kind of budgetary firepower, 
but whether you’re recording your sister’s wedding or a YouTube documen-
tary on the history of yodeling, you can get nearly pro-sounding results if you 
follow these basic tips:

144
Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
 
✓ Use an external microphone whenever possible. The built-in micro-
phones in modern camcorders have improved greatly in recent years, 
but they still aren’t ideal. They often record undesired ambient (or 
background) sound near the camcorder, such as coughing or chatting 
audience members; some mics even pick up the mechanical whirring 
sounds from the camcorder’s tape drive. If possible, connect an external 
microphone to the camcorder’s mic input. Chapter 19 provides recom-
mendations on finding a good-quality microphone.
 
✓ Eliminate unwanted noise sources. If you must use the camcorder’s 
built-in mic, be aware of your movements and other possible causes of 
loud, distracting noises on tape. Problem items may include a loose lens 
cap banging around, your finger rubbing against the mic, wind blowing 
across the mic, and the swish-swish of those nylon workout pants you 
decided to put on this morning.
 
 When you’re recording audio in your studio (also known as your office), 
be aware of ambient noise. Subtle sounds like the cooling fans inside 
your computer, air rushing through heating ducts, and someone playing 
video games in the next room all create ambient noise that will show up 
on audio recordings. If you’re using your computer to record narration, 
you won’t be able to do much about the computer’s fans, but if you have 
other computers in the room, you should shut those down.
 
 Do not try to disable the cooling fans in your computer, not even for just 
a few minutes! Modern computer processors run so hot that they can be 
ruined in mere seconds if they aren’t properly cooled.
 
✓ Try to minimize sound reflection. Audio waves reflect off any hard sur-
face, which can cause echoing in a recording. Hanging blankets on walls 
and other hard surfaces is one way to significantly reduce reflection. If 
the floor isn’t carpeted, cover it with blankets as well.
 
✓ Obtain and use a high-quality microphone. A good mic isn’t cheap, but 
it can make a huge difference in recording quality. A high-quality mic 
may be worth the investment if your project necessitates it. 
 
✓ Watch for trip hazards. In your haste to record great sound, don’t forget 
that your microphone cables can become a hazard on scene. Not only 
are loose wires a safety hazard to anyone walking by, but if someone 
snags a cable, your equipment could be damaged as well. If necessary, 
bring along some gaffer tape (or duct tape) to temporarily cover cables 
that run across the floor.
Working with Audio in Your Movies
Premiere Elements offers two important tools to help you work with audio. 
These tools — accessible in the Window menu — include

145
 Chapter 8: Adding Sound to Your Movies
 
✓ Audio Meters: Choose Window➪Audio Meters to open the meters, as 
shown in Figure 8-1. Audio Meters help you measure sound levels in 
your audio.
 
✓ Audio Mixer: Sometimes your movie will have multiple audio tracks. 
Besides the main audio that goes along with your video, you may add 
narration, background music, or additional layered audio/video tracks. 
To fine-tune which tracks are louder and which are less prominent, click 
Mix Audio on the Timeline or choose Window➪Audio Mixer. I show you 
how to use the Mixer later in this chapter. 
I like to use a lot of different audio tracks in a project. If you like to use a lot 
of audio too, I suggest that you try to insert each new audio element on a 
different track. This trick gives you greater flexibility when you make adjust-
ments to things such as volume. Different bits of audio get recorded at differ-
ent levels, and you may find that one audio clip is too loud whereas another 
is not loud enough.
 
Figure 8-1: 
The Audio 
Mixer and 
Meters 
make audio 
work easy.
 
 
When you look at audio tracks in the Timeline, you’ll notice a graph that visu-
ally illustrates the waveform of the audio track. The waveform shows two 
sets of waves (called channels) for stereo audio files. Waveforms are handy 
because large spikes show you where loud noises occur in audio tracks, 
whereas flat lines indicate quiet sections of audio.

146
Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
Adjusting audio volume
When adjusting volume — also sometimes called gain — for an individual 
audio track, keep an eye on the audio meters. You can open the meters by 
choosing Window➪Audio Meters. The volume of audio in movie projects is 
measured in Volume Units (VU), and the meters show you a VU measurement 
of audio. If the meters reach 0, you’ll probably get audio distortion in the final 
program. If 0 is reached, the red indicator at the top of the VU meter lights up.
 
The audio meters in Premiere Elements may appear similar to the volume 
meters on a tape deck or other recording device you’ve used before. If you’ve 
ever recorded audio on an analog tape deck, you probably made sure that the 
audio levels got above 0 and into the red zone of the VU meter once in a while, 
but that the average volume stayed below 0. When you’re working with digital 
audio, 0 is the maximum volume level you can have before distortion occurs. 
That’s why if you look at the Audio Meters, you notice that the VU meter 
scales stop at 0.
Besides watching for audio peaks that are at or above 0, you should also keep 
an eye on the average audio levels. The VU meters dance up and down quite 
a bit as you play the project, and you should adjust volume so the average 
levels are between –12 and –18 on the VU meter.
When you adjust the volume of an audio clip, you can adjust the overall 
volume for the entire clip, or you can adjust specific segments throughout 
the clip. To adjust volume for a whole clip at once, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the audio clip in the Timeline and choose Clip➪Audio 
Options➪Audio Gain.
 
 The Clip Gain dialog box appears.
 
2. Click-and-drag left on the dB number to reduce gain; click-and-drag 
right to increase gain.
 
 Alternatively, click Normalize. Doing so automatically adjusts the gain to 
the highest possible level without creating distortion. To reset the clip 
to its original gain level, restore the gain value to 0 dB (decibels).
 
3. Click OK to close the dialog box.
In addition to adjusting the overall volume of an audio clip, you can also 
adjust volume at individual points within the clip. Here’s how:
 
1. Click an audio clip in the Timeline to select it.
 
2. Move the CTI to a spot in the Timeline where you want to start adjust-
ing volume.

147
 Chapter 8: Adding Sound to Your Movies
 
3. Click the Add/Remove Keyframe button.
 
 A round keyframe appears along the yellow volume rubberband.
 
4. Move the CTI to a new location in the clip, and click the Add/Remove 
Keyframe button again.
 
 Repeat this step to create additional keyframes.
 
5. Click-and-drag on keyframes to move the volume rubberband.
 
 Moving the rubberband up increases volume, and moving it down 
decreases volume. In Figure 8-2, I have adjusted the volume rubber-
bands on two audio clips so that one fades out as the other fades in. The 
effect is barely noticeable to the listener and provides a seamless audio 
experience for the sequence. Also notice that audio waveforms appear 
on audio clips in the Timeline.

Use volume 
rubber-
bands to 
dynami-
cally adjust 
volume

 Add/Remove Keyframes
Click and drag rubberbands to adjust volume
 
If you adjust the volume rubberbands upward on any audio clips, make sure 
that you play the clip by using Audio Meters and keep an eye on the VU 
meters. If the audio levels exceed 0, you need to reduce volume a bit.
Setting audio In and Out points
When you first start putting a movie together, you begin by sorting through 
your captured video clips to decide which clips you want to use. For each 
clip, you also decide which portions of the clip you want to use. As I show in 
Chapter 6, you do this by setting In points and Out points for the clips. 
Usually when you set an In point or Out point for a clip, you set them for both 
audio and video. However, you can set separate In points and Out points for 
audio and video. Why? Consider the video clip in Figure 8-3. In this clip, the 

148
Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
subject throws a bowling ball down a bowling lane. My plan is to cut from 
this clip to the clip in Figure 8-4, which shows a ball traveling down the bowl-
ing lane and hitting some pins. 
 
Figure 8-3: 
This video 
clip will be 
shown first.
 
The audio portion of this bowling sequence presents an interesting editing 
challenge. I want the sequence to play the sound of one bowling ball rolling 
all the way down the lane and hitting the pins. To do this, I’m going to use the 
audio recorded with the clip in Figure 8-4 rather than the clip in Figure 8-3. 
This means that when I edit the clip in Figure 8-4 into the Timeline, I’m going 
to have to set separate In points for the audio and video. To set separate In 
points for audio and video, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the clip with the desired audio in the Preview window.
 
 Again, see Chapter 6 for more on opening clips in the Preview window 
and setting In points and Out points. 
 
2. Find the point where you want to start using the audio portion of the 
clip, and make sure that the CTI in the Preview window is stopped on 
that point.
 
3. Right-click the CTI and choose Set Clip Marker➪Audio In.
 
 An audio In point is set.
 
4. Move the CTI to the spot where you want to start taking video.

149
 Chapter 8: Adding Sound to Your Movies
 
5. Right-click the CTI and choose Set Clip Marker➪Video In.
 
 Separate In point markers for audio and video appear in the ruler, as 
shown in Figure 8-4. 
 
6. Repeat the above steps to set Out points for audio and video.
To set the same In point or Out point for both audio and video, simply click 
the Set In or Set Out buttons at the bottom of the Preview window. 
 
Figure 8-4: 
This 
video clip 
contains 
the audio I 
will use in 
the whole 
sequence.
 
Unlinking audio and video in the Timeline
When you add a clip containing both audio and video to the Timeline, the 
audio and video tracks for that clip are usually linked together. This means 
that when you click the audio portion of a clip, you select both the audio and 
video portions. Usually this is a handy function, but sometimes you may want 
to unlink the two and edit them individually. For example, you may decide 
that you want to delete or ripple edit (see Chapter 7 for more on ripple 
edits) the audio portion of a clip, while leaving the video portion of the clip 
alone. To unlink audio and video for a clip, select that clip in the Timeline 
and choose Clip➪Unlink Audio and Video. You can now select the audio and 
video portions of the clip individually.
 
A visual clue tells you which clips are linked and which ones are not: Linked 
clips have underlined names in the Timeline. The names of unlinked clips 
aren’t underlined.

Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
Mixing audio
When you bake chocolate chip cookies, you have to use just the right mixture 
of flour, butter, sugar, chocolate chips, and other ingredients. If you get the 
mix wrong, those cookies might not taste very good. 
Similarly, if you don’t get the audio mix just right, the end product will be 
unsatisfying. If your movie contains multiple audio tracks with narration, 
soundtrack music, and other sources, use the Premiere Elements Audio 
Mixer to make sure you’re blending each track in the proper amounts. 
Fortunately, the new SmartMix feature makes mixing audio tracks easier than 
ever. SmartMix analyzes your audio tracks and mixes the audio automatically 
so important sounds — such as narration — aren’t drowned out by less criti-
cal sounds — such as soundtrack music. Follow these steps to use the Mixer:
 
1. Choose Window➪Audio Mixer to open the Mixer. 
 
 You can also choose Audio Mixer from the Audio Tools menu on the 
Timeline.
 
2. Position the Mixer so that you can see the Monitor and Timeline win-
dows, as shown in Figure 8-5.
 
3. Click the arrow next to SmartMixer to expand the SmartMixer con-
trols, as shown in Figure 8-5. 
 
4. Choose whether each audio track should be in the Foreground, 
Background, or Disabled.
 
 Foreground tracks have priority and are louder than Background tracks. 
Choose Disabled if you do not want SmartMix to disable a track. 
 
5. Click Apply in the SmartMixer.
 
 SmartMix analyzes your audio tracks, making Foreground tracks louder 
and Background tracks softer when potential conflicts are detected. 
Audio keyframes (reference points for effects; see Chapter 12 for more 
on using keyframes) are automatically applied, as shown in Figure 8-5.
 
6. Play the movie to hear the changes made by SmartMix.
 
 If you’re happy with the changes applied by SmartMix, you’re done! 
Close the Mixer. But if you want to fine-tune the audio mix, or if you just 
prefer to do all your mixing manually, continue with the next steps. 
 
7. Place the CTI at the beginning of the section of your movie that you 
want to mix, and then click Play in the Monitor.
 
 I recommend that you listen through the whole section first, and listen 
for which parts of the audio are too loud and which are too soft.

151
 Chapter 8: Adding Sound to Your Movies
 
8. Click-and-drag a slider up to increase the volume of a track, or down 
to decrease the volume.
 
 Premiere Elements automatically creates audio keyframes in the audio 
track to adjust the track’s volume dynamically while the Timeline plays.
 
 To avoid audio distortion, I recommend that you reduce the volume 
of tracks that you want to be less prominent rather than increase the 
volume of tracks that should be more prominent. Watch the audio level 
meters in the Mixer to ensure that audio levels aren’t getting into the red 
portion of the scale. Red means distortion.
 
9. Click Pause in the Monitor and close the Audio Mixer when you’re 
done mixing audio.
The Mixer also lets you adjust balance dynamically, which would be helpful 
in the unlikely scenario where you want to suppress or enhance a sound that 
is audible in one side of a stereo track but is not audible in the other side.

Narrating Your Movies
The great thing about video is that you can show people what happened, 
not just tell them about it. But sometimes you need to tell them about it too, 
and that’s where narration comes in handy. Premiere Elements has a built-in 
recorder to help you quickly record narration. Here’s how you use it:
 
1. Plan your narration.
 
 If your narration will consist of more than one sentence, write a script. 
Play the movie and practice your narration a few times before recording 
it to make sure that you have your timing perfected. 
 
2. Connect a microphone to your computer.
 
 See Chapter 19 for microphone recommendations. If you have multiple 
microphones (for example, a built-in mic and an external mic), click the 
Mic Source button (it looks like a microphone) in the Narration dialog 
box and select the desired mic.
 
3. Choose Add Narration in the Audio Tools menu on the Timeline.
 
 The Record Voice Narration dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 8-6.
 
4. In the Timeline, move the CTI to the beginning of the section you want 
to narrate.
 
5. Test your microphone to make sure it’s working.
 
 You should see the green audio meter in the Narration window move up 
and down as you talk.
 
6. Decide whether you will mute the movie’s audio while you record.
 
 If you want to hear the movie’s audio while you record narration, plug in 
some headphones and uncheck the “Mute audio while recording” check 
box. If you unmute audio and it plays through your computer’s speakers 
while you record, your recording will be ruined by feedback.
 
7. Click the Record button.
 
 A three-second countdown begins, after which the movie starts to play. 
Speak to record your narration.
 
8. Click Stop when you’re done recording.
 
 A new narration clip appears in the Narration track of the Timeline. If 
you aren’t happy with the recording, click the Delete button (it looks like 
a trash can) and start again at Step 4.

Adding a Soundtrack
In the beginning there were silent movies. Of course, they weren’t really 
silent because the theater almost always played music (live or recorded) 
to complement the mood and tempo of the movies. Even with the advent of 
talkies in the 1920s and ’30s, soundtrack music has remained a crucial movie 
element. The next few sections show you how to automatically generate 
soundtrack music, using the SmartSound tool that comes free with Premiere 
Elements.
 
You don’t have to use SmartSound for your soundtracks. You can also 
import and use songs in MP3, WMA, or other formats. See Chapter 5 for a 
list of compatible file types and instructions on how to import them. After 
you’ve imported an audio file into Premiere Elements, click-and-drag it to 
an audio track in the Timeline — you can use the Soundtrack track or any 
other open audio track if you want. Just keep in mind that music produced 
by others is protected by copyright law and should only be used for your 
personal enjoyment. 
Generating a SmartSound soundtrack
You want to add some music to your movies, but you can’t afford to hire 
John Williams and the London Symphony Orchestra to produce your 
soundtrack. Enter SmartSound, a tool that comes free with Adobe Premiere 
Elements. SmartSound automatically generates high-quality, royalty-free 
soundtrack music that almost perfectly matches the length of your movie. 
To use SmartSound, edit your movie together and get it to a point where you 
consider it mainly finished. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Decide how much time you want to fill with soundtrack music.
 
 If you want the soundtrack to span your entire movie, make a note of the 
movie’s length.

154
Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
 
2. On the Timeline, choose Audio Tools➪SmartSound.
 
3. Review and accept the SmartSound license agreement that appears, 
and then complete the registration information as requested.
 
4. In the SmartSound Quicktracks window that appears, click the Click 
Here to Select Music! option.
 
5. In the SmartSound Maestro window that appears, shown in Figure 8-7, 
choose a music style and review the music choices listed in that style.
 
 You can also filter the results by intensity.
 
6. Click a song in the list to review details about it on the right of the 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-7.
 
Figure 8-7: 
SmartSound 
offers a

of music 
styles.
 
 
7. Click the Select button in the lower right to select the song. 
 
8. In the SmartSound dialog box (see Figure 8-8), enter the desired dura-
tion of the song in the Length field.
 
 The final song duration may not match exactly, but it should be close. 
The song may start to sound a little repetitive during long plays. 
 
9. Click Play to preview the song.
 
10. Choose an option in the Variations menu to hear a slightly different 
variation of the song.
 
 If your soundtrack will be more than a few minutes long, try creating 
separate shorter versions of the song — but with different variations — 
to use in different parts of your movie.

155
 Chapter 8: Adding Sound to Your Movies
 
11. When you’re happy with the song, click OK, and then name and save 
the new soundtrack file.
 
 The new soundtrack song appears in the Soundtrack track of the 
Timeline. Click-and-drag the song left or right to move it to a new loca-
tion in your movie.

Detecting audio beats
Dancers carefully choreograph their moves to synchronize with music beats. 
Video producers also often synchronize video edits to music beats, and 
Premiere Elements has a cool feature that automatically detects music beats 
to create “snap-to” markers in the Timeline. You can then use these markers 
to make Timeline edits in perfect time to the beat. 
You can use beat detection with SmartSound soundtrack music, or with your 
own songs that you import into Premiere Elements. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click an audio clip in the Timeline to select it.
 
 The clip should contain the musical beats you want to detect.
 
2. Choose Audio Tools➪Detect Beats on the Timeline.
 
3. In the Beat Detection Settings dialog box that appears, adjust these 
settings:
 
• Minimum time between beats: The default time is two seconds. 
This is a pretty good default because two seconds may be about 
right for some short clips. 
 
• Difference: Premiere Elements detects beats by measuring differ-
ences in volume. Increasing the Difference setting means Premiere 
Elements looks for greater differences before creating markers. 

156
Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
 
• Window: Premiere looks at volume differences over a specific 
period of time. The default time is 100ms (milliseconds), which 
is one-tenth of a second. Increase the Window setting to make 
Premiere Elements analyze music over longer time periods. 
 
 Usually, it’s best to just accept the default beat-detection settings. 
However, if you find that Premiere Elements creates too many markers 
to be useful, try increasing the Difference and Window settings so that 
Premiere Elements is more selective about what it thinks is a beat.
 
4. Click OK to close the settings dialog box and begin detecting beats.
 
 When the detection process is complete, a bunch of musical notes 
appear along your Timeline, as shown in Figure 8-9. These notes are 
the beat markers. If there are too many (or not enough) beat markers, 
repeat Steps 2 and 3 and change the detection settings. When you rede-
tect beats, previous beat markers are replaced.
 
5. Click-and-drag edit points in the Timeline to match the beats.
 
 When you get close to a beat marker, the edit point snaps to the beat 
marker, as shown in Figure 8-9.
 
To get rid of an unwanted beat marker, right-click the offending marker and 
choose Clear Beat Marker from the menu that appears. You can also choose 
Clear All Beat Markers if you decide you don’t want any beat markers.

Using Audio Effects and Transitions
Adobe Premiere Elements comes with a valuable selection of audio effects 
and transitions. To access the list of audio effects, click the Edit tab and 
then click Effects. Video effects are shown by default (see Chapter 12 for 

157
 Chapter 8: Adding Sound to Your Movies
more on working with video effects), so click the down arrow next to Video 
Effects and choose Audio Effects from the menu that appears. To view audio 
transitions, click Transitions on the Edit pane, click the arrow next to Video 
Transitions, and choose Video Transitions. (I show you how to use video 
transitions in Chapter 9.) The following sections describe audio effects 
and transitions available in Premiere Elements. I also show how to use the 
Dynamics effect.
Reviewing Premiere Elements 
audio effects
Premiere Elements comes with a good selection of audio effects that help you 
improve and modify audio clips. Some of these effects can make audio seem 
distorted or surreal; other effects help you repair audio problems. Audio 
effects offered in Premiere Elements include
 
✓ Balance: Controls balance between the left and right channels in a 
stereo clip.
 
✓ Bass: Provides control over bass response in the clip. Bass sounds are 
the deeper, low frequency sounds in an audio clip.
 
✓ Channel Volume: Allows you to control the volume of stereo channels 
independently.
 
✓ Delay: Echoes the clip. Echoes the clip.
 
✓ DeNoiser: Removes unwanted background noise during quiet parts of 
the clip. By removing audible pops and hisses, this effect works kind of 
like the Dolby noise reduction found on audio cassette tape players.
 
✓ Dynamics: A good one-stop tool for audio improvement. This effect 
helps reduce distortion and eliminate unwanted background noise. Use 
the AutoGate setting to set up a virtual gate that eliminates all sound 
below a specific volume, thus eliminating quiet background noise while 
keeping the louder sounds that you want to keep. I show how to use the 
Dynamics effect later in this chapter.
 
✓ Fill Left: Moves the audio completely to the left stereo channel.
 
✓ Fill Right: Moves the audio completely to the right stereo channel.
 
✓ Highpass: Removes lower frequencies from the audio clip.
 
✓ Invert: Inverts the audio phase (or delay) between the left and right 
audio channels in a stereo clip. For example, if the audio in the left chan-
nel is slightly delayed behind the right channel, the Invert effect inverts 
the phase so that the right channel (rather than the left) is delayed.

158
Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
 
✓ Lowpass: Removes higher frequencies from the audio.
 
✓ Notch: Removes sound at a frequency you specify. Use this effect if the 
audio clip has a constant hum caused by a nearby power line or a flaw in 
the recording device.
 
✓ PitchShifter: Adjusts pitch in an audio clip. For example, if you speed up 
a clip and as a result the voices have an unnaturally high pitch, you can 
use this effect to make the voices sound more normal.
 
✓ Reverb: Makes the audio clip sound as if it’s being played in a large hall 
or room.
 
✓ Swap Channels: Swaps the left and right stereo channels, if for some 
reason you decide that the sound in the right channel should be on the 
left, and vice versa.
 
✓ Treble: Provides control over treble (the higher frequency sounds) in 
the clip.
 
✓ Volume: Allows you to adjust volume with an effect rather than the 
Audio Mixer or the volume rubberbands.
A complete course on how to use each effect would take up nearly another 
whole book (each effect differs considerably from the others). Some gen-
eral instructions are in order, however: To apply an audio effect to a clip, 
simply drag it from the Effects window and drop it onto your audio clip in the 
Timeline. Depending on which effect you chose, you can manipulate audio 
effect settings by using the Effect Controls window (right-click the clip in the 
Timeline and choose Show Properties from the menu that appears); you can 
also adjust the effect dynamically by using keyframes (see Chapter 12 for 
more on working with effect keyframes). Make sure a clip is selected in the 
Timeline if you want to view its controls in the Effect Controls window.
Using audio transitions
One of the most common reasons for adjusting volume on a clip (at least, in 
my experience) is to fade a clip in as it begins and fade it out as it ends. When 
done well, fading sound in and out is barely perceptible to the viewer. This 
fading — called cross-fading — takes a distinct “edge” off the transition as a 
loud noise gradually starts or stops. I like to apply audio transitions to fade 
between virtually all audio clips in a project, even though I usually don’t use 
video transitions between every video clip. 
 
The idea behind audio transitions is to make the audible transition between 
clips virtually imperceptible, and audio transitions can do that.

159
 Chapter 8: Adding Sound to Your Movies
The process of fading in or out between clips has never been easier. Premiere 
Elements provides two audio transitions that you can apply to audio clips 
to quickly fade them in or out. If two clips are adjacent, the transition cross-
fades the two clips. There are two Cross Fade transition effects available in 
Premiere Elements:
 
✓ Constant Gain: Audio fades in or out at a constant, linear level.
 
✓ Constant Power: Audio fades in a manner that sounds linear to the 
human ear, although from a purely mathematical standpoint, it is not 
linear.
I use the Constant Power transition most often, but you may want to experi-
ment to get the best results for your projects. To apply a transition, simply 
drag and drop it from the Edit pane to the edge of a clip or a spot between 
clips. As you can see in Figure 8-10, audio transitions appear in the Timeline 
much like video transitions.

sitions make

Fine-tuning audio dynamics
Your camcorder usually records audio along with video. This audio will 
be important to most of your movie projects, but unfortunately, you often 
don’t have much control over ambient noise and other things that affect 
sound quality. For example, recently I shot video of my kids playing soccer. 
I want to keep the sounds of the game — kids kicking the ball, cheers from 
the crowd, whistles from the referee — but I want to eliminate the dull back-
ground noise coming from a nearby highway. 

160
Part II: Editing Video and Sound 
Dynamics effect to the rescue! The ambient sound I want to eliminate is 
relatively constant but quiet. The Dynamics effect helps eliminate unwanted 
noise while enhancing the quality of the audio that remains. To use the 
Dynamics effect, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Effects window if it isn’t already open (click Effects on the 
Edit pane, and then choose Audio Effects).
 
2. Click-and-drag the Dynamics effect from the Effects window and drop 
it on the audio clip in the Timeline that you want to adjust.
 
3. Right-click the clip in the Timeline to select it, and then choose Show 
Properties in the menu that appears.
 
4. In the clip properties that appear on the Edit pane, click the arrow 
next to Dynamics to expand the controls for the Dynamics effect, and 
then click the arrow next to Custom Setup.
 
5. Use the Monitor to play the clip and listen for audio problems that you 
want to fix.
 
 Use the J, K, and L keys on your keyboard to control playback. The J key 
plays the Timeline in reverse, K pauses playback, and L plays forward. 
 
6. To eliminate quieter background noise, place a check mark next to 
AutoGate (as shown in Figure 8-11) and fine-tune AutoGate settings.
 
 Click-and-drag left or right on the adjuster knobs to modify the AutoGate 
settings. Constantly play the clip backward and forward as you make 
adjustments to see how your adjustments affect the sound. 
 
7. Use the Compressor to increase quieter sounds and/or decrease 
louder sounds.
 
 The Compressor is sort of the opposite of the AutoGate, so you’ll usually 
use one or the other. Again, experiment to get the desired sound. 
 
8. Use the Expander to increase the difference between soft and loud 
sounds.
 
 The Expander is sort of like the AutoGate, but it softens rather than 
eliminates quiet background noises. Use the Expander if you find that 
AutoGate is too harsh.
 
9. Use the Limiter to get rid of distortion or soften loud noises.
 
 Really loud noises may become distorted (or just plain annoying). The 
Limiter limits the maximum volume of a clip, so it softens the loudest 
noises without affecting quieter sounds. In my soccer game video, I used 
the Limiter to soften the cheers of spectators who were close to the 
camera, while maintaining game sounds at their regular level. 
 
10. Click Done when you’re finished fine-tuning your clip’s audio 
dynamics.

A
nyone with a DVD recorder and a cable can dub desirable bits of video 
from a camcorder to disc. This is movie editing at its most basic; it’s 
also inefficient and crude. By using a program like Adobe Premiere Elements, 
you can fine-tune your edits frame by frame, apply your own musical 
soundtrack, dub in narration, and add special effects. 
In previous chapters I show you how to capture video onto your computer’s 
hard drive, sort through clips, pick out the parts you want to use, and assem-
ble those clips in the Timeline. If you’ve done those things, you’re ready for 
the next step in your video-editing adventure: dressing up your project with 
transitions between scenes. You can use Premiere Elements to add transi-
tions that fade in or out, pull open like a stage curtain, spiral down into a 
vortex, and more. Transitions provide visual breaks between scenes that 
help the viewer understand changes in the movie’s setting or mood. This 
chapter shows you how to choose, apply, and customize transitions.
Checking Out the Transitions Library
One of the trickiest aspects of movie editing (for me, anyway) is making clean 
transitions between clips. Sometimes the best transition is no transition at 
all, but a simple, straight cut from one clip to the next. Other times you need 
a fancy transition, say, one that rotates the old clip into a vortex — spinning, 
spinning toward the center until it’s a tiny black dot in the middle of the 
screen — and then it disappears entirely. Most of your transitions probably 
fall somewhere in between.

166
Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
Adobe Premiere Elements comes with more than 100 unique video transi-
tions that you can use in your projects. These transitions are subdivided 
into 16 categories and range from simple dissolves to complex 3D motion 
effects. The following sections describe the transitions in each category. To 
find these categories, click the Edit tab, and then click Transitions (or choose 
Window➪Transitions). Use the category menu (see Figure 9-1) to view a cat-
egory of transitions, or choose Show All and scroll down the list to see all the 
available transitions. The transition categories include
 
✓ 3D Motion: This category consists of ten transitions that apply various 
kinds of three-dimensional motion to one clip as it disappears to reveal 
the next one. Most of the transitions here involve getting the exiting clip 
to swing like a door or spin in a spiral. Figure 9-1 shows the Doors transi-
tion, where the incoming clip appears to close in from either side like a 
pair of doors.

167
 Chapter 9: Using Video Transitions
 
✓ Dissolves: My favorite transition, the Cross Dissolve, can be found in the 
Dissolve category. It’s my favorite not because it is fancy but because 
it’s not. The Cross Dissolve is subtle; one clip blends smoothly into the 
next. It’s softer than a straight cut — and if I want the program to be 
about what’s in the clips (and not about fancy transitions), this is the 
one I choose. You’ll notice that Cross Dissolve is also the most common 
transition used in professional video products as well. Cross Dissolve is 
just one of seven Dissolve transitions available with Premiere Elements.
 
✓ GPU Transitions: If your computer has a powerful dedicated video 
card as I recommend in Chapter 2, you can use the five GPU transitions 
offered by Premiere Elements. These transitions leverage the graphics 
processing unit (GPU) in your video card to display advanced visual 
effects. Figure 9-2 shows the Sphere GPU transition, which wraps the 
outgoing clip around a 3D sphere that then rolls off the screen. 
 
✓ Iris: The seven Iris transitions are all variations on a theme of one clip 
starting as a point in the middle and growing to fill the screen. Different 
Iris patterns include circles, squares, stars, diamonds (I know, it’s start-
ing to sound like a breakfast cereal!), and more. Like many transitions, 
Iris transitions can be customized by changing the shape and quantity of 
irises in the transition.
 
✓ Map: The Channel and Luminance Map transitions can be customized 
to use colors from incoming and outgoing clips to create interesting 
blended images. The Map transitions work best when you heavily cus-
tomize their settings. (I show how to customize transitions later in this 
chapter.)

Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
 
✓ NewBlue transitions: The four NewBlue categories contain a total of 29 
snazzy transitions from NewBlueFX, a third-party developer of transi-
tions and plug-ins for Premiere Elements and other editing programs. If 
you want a highly individualized movie, check out some of the NewBlue 
transitions such as Magic Carpet, Bouncing Cubes, or Wave.
 
✓ Page Peels: The five Page Peel transitions simulate the turning of a page 
or opening of a book. Use these to make the transition from your “Once 
upon a time . . . ” screen to the story!
 
✓ Picture Wipes: This category contains three specialized transitions 
called Stars, Travel, and Wedding. These transitions incorporate themed 
graphics. 
 
✓ Slides: The Slide category is a descriptively named group that contains 
12 transitions. All the transitions in this group are variations on sliding 
a clip one way or the other. These subtle transitions are also among 
my favorites. Slide transitions are similar to Wipe transitions, which I 
describe later.
 
✓ Special Effects: The Special Effects category contains six advanced and 
varied transitions that apply various combinations of color masks and 
distortions while moving from one clip to the next.
 
✓ Stretches: The five transitions found in the Stretch category are pretty 
cool, even though technically some of them squeeze rather than stretch 
the clip image during transition. In Figure 9-3, the outgoing image is 
squeezed down a funnel, using the Funnel transition.
 
✓ Wipes: Wipe style transitions have been around for a while: One clip 
appears from the edge of the screen and appears to wipe over the pre-
ceding clip like a squeegee. Wipe transitions differ from Slide transitions, 
because in a wipe the outgoing image remains static while the incoming 
image wipes over it. In Slide transitions, the incoming image slides in 
while the outgoing image slides out. Premiere Elements includes no less 
than 17 Wipe transitions.
 
Figure 9-3:

169
 Chapter 9: Using Video Transitions
 
✓ Zooms: There are four Zoom transitions, and as you would imagine, they 
all simulate different camera zooms. An outgoing transition can zoom 
out into the distance where it disappears, or the camera may appear to 
zoom in on the incoming clip.
 
When automakers choose paint color names, they tend to go crazy. What 
you and I might call Pink becomes Moulin Rouge or Indian Ceramic in car 
brochures. Fortunately, Adobe Elements keeps things simple by assigning 
descriptive names to video transitions. Slides slide, wipes wipe, and zooms … 
well, you get the idea. Still, if you aren’t exactly sure what Iris Diamond does, 
hold your mouse pointer over the transition. The transition’s icon plays a 
small preview of the transition so you can easily see what it does. 
Using Transitions Effectively
With so many unique transitions to choose from, selecting just the right one 
can be challenging. When you consider that most transitions can also be fine-
tuned and customized, the endless possibilities may have already started 
your head spinning. So how do you choose? Because video production is 
such a creative and personal endeavor, I couldn’t possibly recommend a per-
fect transition for every situation. I do, however, have a few basic transition 
rules to follow as you develop your own editing style:
 
✓ Use transitions sparingly. You don’t need to apply a transition between 
every single clip in your Timeline. That’s too much. I try to save transi-
tions for changes of scene. Simple changes to the camera angle or posi-
tion in the same scene (for example) usually don’t warrant a transition. 
Watch a typical feature-length movie and you’ll probably see just a small 
handful of simple transitions, even though the movie may be a couple of 
hours long.
 
✓ Keep ’em short. Later in this chapter, I show you how to control the 
length of a transition. Most transitions should be short in duration, usu-
ally one second or less.
 
✓ It’s all about the pictures. Editing can help shape the mood and flow of 
a movie, but ultimately the focus of your project is the video content. 
The desire to show off your editing skills with fancy transitions can be 
tempting — but generally speaking, transitions should complement and 
enhance the video images, not overpower them.
 
 Thinking of the mood you want to set may help you narrow down your 
transition choices. For example, you want to avoid transmogrifying the 
scene with a high-tech Distortion transition if you’re editing a movie that 
celebrates your grandparents’ golden wedding anniversary. Remember, 
ultimately the movie is about your grandparents, not your incredible 
movie-editing abilities. 

170
Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
 
✓ Follow your inspiration. You should be familiar with the various transi-
tion styles that are available in Premiere Elements, even the ones you 
seldom, if ever, use. In a moment of late-night, caffeine-induced inspira-
tion, it might come to you: “This is the spot for that fancy, spinning, 3D 
transition!” 
Premiere Elements also offers a couple of audio transitions. In this chapter, I 
talk mainly about video transitions, so for more on working with audio transi-
tions, slide, peel, or dissolve your way over to Chapter 8.
Incorporating Transitions 
into Your Movies
The tricky part of adding transitions to a movie project in Adobe Premiere 
Elements, in my opinion, is choosing a transition that looks good without 
detracting from the overall flow of the project. In the preceding section, I 
talk about choosing an effective transition. In this section, I show you how to 
actually put some transitions to use.
Finding transitions to use
If you’re new to video, you may be surprised by how many different transi-
tions are possible between two clips. As I mention previously in this chapter, 
Adobe Premiere Elements comes with more than 100 built-in transitions, and 
you can add even more through third-party plug-ins.
Premiere Elements stores all its transitions under the Edit tab of the 
Task pane. Click the Edit tab, and then click Transitions, or choose 
Window➪Transitions. A list of transitions appears (refer to Figure 9-1). 
Transitions are divvied up into 16 subcategories, which I describe earlier in 
this chapter.
Applying a transition
The software designers at Adobe must really like drag-and-drop because, as 
with so many other editing actions in Premiere Elements, drag-and-drop is 
the best way to apply a transition. Simply choose a transition and drag 
it from the Edit pane to the desired spot on the Timeline, as shown in 
Figure 9-4.

171
 Chapter 9: Using Video Transitions
 
Figure 9-4: 
Drop 
transitions 
between 
video clips 
in the 
Timeline.
 
Drag transition from here . . .
Drop transition here.
 
When you add a transition to the Timeline, the In and Out points of adjacent 
clips are automatically extended to facilitate the transition. Thus, each clip 
needs some unused frames that were trimmed off when you edited the clip 
into the Timeline. For example, if a transition lasts one second, the preceding 
clip must have at least a half-second of trailing material, and the following clip 
must have a half-second of leading material. Keep this in mind when you set In 
and Out points as you edit clips into the Timeline (see Chapter 6 for more on 
setting In and Out points).
If the clips lack sufficient leading or trailing material, you are somewhat lim-
ited in how you can position the transition. The default method in Premiere 
Elements is to drop it so that the transition evenly overlaps both adjacent 
clips, as shown in Figure 9-5. In the figure, the transition is 30 frames long, 
which means that 15 frames are added onto the end of the outgoing clip and 
15 frames are added to the beginning of the incoming clip. 

172
Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
 
Figure 9-5:

Transition
Outgoing clip
Incoming clip
If neither clip has enough material, Premiere Elements won’t let you drop the 
transition right on the edit line — your Timeline won’t look neat and pretty 
like Figures 9-4 and 9-5. Instead, Premiere Elements may only allow you to 
drop the transition entirely on one clip or the other. You may even see a 
warning message advising you that some frames will be repeated. 
If you find yourself in a situation in which you have too little media to accom-
modate a transition, you have a couple of options:
 
✓ Skip using a transition at this point in your movie. Maybe this problem 
is a sign that you don’t really need a transition. 
 
✓ Shorten the length of the transition. If the clips have some leading and 
trailing material, but not quite enough for the current transition length, 
you might be able to make the transition work if you make it shorter. I 
show you how to adjust transition duration later in this chapter.
 
✓ Shorten the length of the clip(s). Choose the Selection tool in the 
Timeline (see Chapter 7 for more on ripple edits) and drag the edges of 
the leading and trailing clips until you’ve trimmed about half a second 
from each clip. Because a ripple edit basically trims material off the clip 
and changes the In and Out points, this should create enough leading 
and trailing time to facilitate the transition.
 
If you want to apply a transition between two clips, those clips must be in the 
same Timeline track. Fortunately, Adobe Premiere Elements allows you to use 
transitions in any video track. Many other consumer-oriented video-editing 
programs allow you to use transitions in only one track.
Fine-tuning transitions
More often than not, you just plop a transition down on the Timeline and use 
it as it sits. Sometimes, however, you may want to fine-tune the transition. 

173
 Chapter 9: Using Video Transitions
You can change the length of a transition by clicking-and-dragging on either 
side of the transition. For example, you can shorten the duration of a transi-
tion to speed it up, or lengthen the transition if you want it to occur more 
gradually. To change the duration of a transition, first click the Selection tool 
in the upper-left corner of the Timeline (the Selection tool looks like a single 
large arrow), and then click-and-drag one side of a transition to lengthen or 
shorten it.
You can also modify the duration of a clip by using the Edit tab. After 
you apply a transition, double-click the transition in the Timeline to open 
transition controls, as shown in Figure 9-6. You can also open the transi-
tion controls by clicking the transition once to select it, and then choosing 
Window➪Properties. 
The default duration for most clips is one second, but you can make the 
transition as short or long as your source clips and common sense allow. To 
adjust the duration of a transition using the Edit tab, enter a new number in 
the Duration field. You can also click-and-drag left or right on the Duration 
field to adjust the time. In Figure 9-7, I have changed the duration of the tran-
sition to 25 frames, which is a little less than one second in NTSC video.

Figure 9-7 shows a number of different controls in the Effect Controls 
window. Some key settings and features include
 
✓ Split-track Timeline: Click the Show Timeline button in the Edit pane 
(refer to Figure 9-6) to reveal a small Timeline window showing just the 
current transition. If you’ve used older versions of Adobe Premiere, you 
may notice that this looks similar to the split-track Timeline that was 
used in the old A/B Editing workspace, found in Adobe Premiere 6.5 and 
earlier. 
 
 The split-track Timeline shown in Figure 9-7 is useful because it shows 
how much leading and trailing material is available for each clip. You 
can roll-edit the transition in this Timeline by dragging it back and forth. 
 
✓ Alignment: Use the Alignment menu under the Duration field to control 
alignment of the transition. By default, a transition uses the Center at 
Cut setting, but you can also make the transition start or end at the loca-
tion of the original cut between clips if you want to change the starting 
or ending frames of the transition.
 
✓ Preview window: Click the Play button above the preview window in the 
upper-left corner to see a visual representation of the transition. Some 

175
 Chapter 9: Using Video Transitions
transitions, such as slides or wipes, allow you to change direction — simply 
click the arrows around the edges of the preview window to change the 
transition’s direction. Some transitions have arrows around the preview 
window because they are directional transitions. Click an arrow to change 
the transition’s direction. 
 
✓ Start/End controls: The Start and End boxes represent the outgoing clip 
(Start) and the incoming clip (End). Use the slider controls underneath 
these boxes to change where the transition starts or ends.
 
✓ Show Actual Sources: If the Start and End boxes aren’t clear enough for 
accurate editing, deselect this option to replace the clip thumbnails with 
a giant “A” (for the outgoing clip) and “B” (for the incoming clip). 
 
✓ Reverse: Enabling the Reverse option can reverse the direction of many 
transitions.
 
✓ Other options: Some transitions have additional options which will be 
listed under Reverse. Some common options include borders and edge 
smoothing (called anti-aliasing). Experiment with other options to cus-
tomize the appearance and function of your transitions.
More than 100 transitions come with Premiere Elements, all with different 
settings to adjust, so your Effect Controls window may not look exactly like 
Figures 9-6 or 9-7. Play around a bit to find the transitions and combinations 
of settings that work best for you!
 
Some transition options allow you to specify a color for transition elements 
(such as borders). To choose a color, click the color swatch to open the Color 
Picker window. When you choose a color in the Color Picker, watch out for 
a yellow triangle with an exclamation point in the upper-right corner of the 
window. If you see the warning icon, it means that the color you chose won’t 
appear properly on video equipment in your area (NTSC or PAL). In that case, 
your best option is to choose a different color.
Changing the default transition
Premiere Elements knows that a lot of people have one type of transition 
that they use most of the time. It just so happens that the transition I use 
most often — the Cross Dissolve — is also the default transition in Premiere 
Elements. But if you want to set yourself apart from the crowd, you may want 
to change the default transition in Premiere Elements. 
Setting the default transition comes in handy when you use Premiere 
Elements to create slideshows from still photos. (I describe how to create 
a slideshow in Chapter 17.) If the Cross Dissolve is not your favorite transi-
tion, I won’t hold it against you. In fact, I’m even willing to show you how to 
change the default to your favorite transition. To set a new default transition, 
follow these steps:

176
Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
 
1. Open the Edit tab, and then click Transitions.
 
 Alternatively, choose Window➪Transitions. The list of transitions 
appears. The current default transition has a gray border around it. 
 
2. Locate the transition that you want to use as your default transition.
 
3. Right-click the transition and then choose Set Selected as Default 
Transition in the menu that appears, as shown in Figure 9-8.
 
 Your new default transition should now have a gray border around it. 
 
You can also change the default duration for transitions. Choose 
Edit➪Preferences➪General. Enter a new value next to Video Transition Default 
Duration. The default duration for video transitions is one second (30 frames for 
NTSC video, 25 frames for PAL), but you can change it to any length you want. 
This default duration applies to all transitions, not just the default transition.

Improving and Repairing 
Video Images
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding video color
▶ Correcting colors
▶ Adjusting brightness and contrast
▶ Stabilizing shaky video
A
nyone who has used a camera — be it a still camera or a camcorder — 
has probably learned some hard lessons about light and color. A scene 
that looks brilliant to human eyes often turns out dull and imperfect when it’s 
photographed. You’ve probably experienced this before; pictures you take 
are too dark, colors look weird, or brilliant colors get washed out by bright 
sunlight. Managing light and color is one of the trickiest aspects of photogra-
phy and videography.
When you shoot video, you can take advantage of the available light and 
color by using tips and techniques that I suggest in Chapters 3 and 18. But no 
matter how hard you try to follow the rules of photography and videography, 
you’re going to wind up with video clips that appear less than perfect when 
you view them on a TV screen or computer. Don’t feel bad — it happens to 
the best of us. Even when I shoot professional video with broadcast-quality 
cameras under controlled studio lighting, I still spend a fair amount of time 
post-processing my videos. Post-processing is just a fancy way of saying that 
I use special tools in Adobe Premiere (Pro or Elements) to clean up the final 
appearance of colors and light in my movies. This chapter shows you how to 
use the color-correction tools in Premiere Elements to improve the quality of 
your video images. I also show you how to stabilize shaky video footage by 
using the Stabilizer effect.

Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
Understanding How Video Color Works
Remember back in the old days when many personal computers used regular 
televisions for monitors? In the early 1980s I had a Commodore 64 hooked 
up to a 13-inch color television set. As PC monitor technology improved, the 
notion of connecting computers to TVs fell out of vogue. Modern computer 
monitors offer incredibly high resolution and color accuracy compared to 
most televisions, even digital high-def TVs. 
 
After decades of high-quality PC monitors, people are once again connecting 
their computers to TVs. Many new HDTVs have VGA and DVI inputs, allowing 
easy PC connections. This makes sense for media center PCs used for playing 
photos, music, and Internet media on a home theater, but for video editing 
and other traditional PC tasks, it isn’t a good idea. Even the most expensive 
1080p TVs deliver inferior resolution, brightness, and color accuracy com-
pared to modern computer monitors. This means that you shouldn’t use a TV 
as your computer’s primary monitor. But it’s also why using a TV as a second 
preview monitor is important for movies destined for TV viewing; images that 
look great on your PC monitor may have color issues on a TV.
Another big difference between computer monitors and TVs is the way they 
render color. Computer monitors utilize what is called the RGB color space. 
RGB stands for red-green-blue, meaning that all the colors you see on a com-
puter monitor are combined by blending those three colors. Digital TVs, on 
the other hand, use the YCbCr color space. YCbCr stands for luminance, chro-
minance (blue), and chrominance (red). Analog TVs use the YUV (luminance-
chrominance) color space. This tells you two things:
 
✓ Y = luminance? Whoever’s in charge of video acronyms can’t spell.
 
✓ Brightness in video displays is treated as a separate component from 
color. Luminance is basically just a fancy word for brightness, and chro-
minance means color in non-techie speak.
I could go on for pages describing the technicalities of the YCbCr color space, 
but there are really two important things you need to know about color: 
 
✓ Some RGB colors may not show up properly on TVs. This is an issue 
mainly when you try to use JPEGs or other computer-generated graph-
ics in a video project, or when you adjust the colors of a video image 
by using effects and color settings in your video-editing program. The 
RGB and YCbCr color spaces are fairly similar, but some RGB colors 
definitely won’t appear properly on YUV monitors. RGB colors that don’t 
translate perfectly to YUV are often said to be illegal or out of gamut. You 
won’t get arrested for trying to use them, but they will not look right. 

179
 Chapter 10: Improving and Repairing Video Images
 
 Generally speaking, illegal colors are ones with RGB values below 20 or 
above 230. Graphics programs can usually tell you RGB values for the 
colors in your images. Some graphics programs (including Adobe 
Photoshop and Photoshop Elements) even have special filters that help 
you filter out “illegal” TV colors from your images. In Photoshop 
Elements, open your image and choose Filter➪Video➪NTSC Colors to 
remove out-of-gamut colors from the image.
 
✓ Video colors won’t look exactly right when you view them on a com-
puter monitor. Because you’ll probably do most of your video editing 
while looking at a computer monitor, you won’t necessarily see the same 
colors that appear when the video is viewed on a TV. In other words, as 
you use the video filters in Premiere Elements to adjust colors, keep in 
mind that the changes you see on your computer screen don’t necessar-
ily reflect how the video will look when you output it to DVD. If possible, 
connect an external video monitor to your computer, as I describe in 
Chapter 19. Using an external video monitor allows you to more prop-
erly preview the final colors of your video.
Correcting Video Color
Correcting and changing colors in video is much more of an art than a sci-
ence. Every video camera has unique characteristics, every scene is lit dif-
ferently, and every project has special color needs. I guess this is my way of 
saying that you won’t find a magic formula here to help you make each and 
every video clip look perfect. When you want to adjust video colors, trial-and-
error is an inevitable part of the process. But the following sections can help 
you start using the color and lighting effects available in Adobe Premiere 
Elements. 
Surveying color and light effects in 
Premiere Elements
Most consumer-oriented video-editing programs now enable you to adjust 
color and lighting in video clips. Usually such a tool chest consists of a few 
slider or dial controls that mimic the adjustment knobs on old TVs, with con-
trols for color, tint, brightness, and contrast. Adobe Premiere Elements goes 
above and beyond with a collection of advanced color and lighting effects 
that give you capabilities formerly found only in expensive, professional-
grade programs. 

180
Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
To view the selection of effects that Premiere Elements offers up, choose 
Window➪Effects, or click the Effects button under the Edit tab. Video Effects 
are divided into 19 categories, and you can scroll down the list of effects on 
the Edit pane to view the entire selection. You can find the effects that come 
in handy for fixing light and color in the Adjust and Image Control categories. 
The Adjust effects that will help your video images include
 
✓ Auto Color: This effect quickly adjusts color and contrast by limiting the 
range of blacks and whites in the image based upon its midtones. Use 
this effect to quickly improve color in high-contrast images.
 
✓ Auto Contrast: This effect adjusts contrast without changing the overall 
color cast of the image. If you don’t like what Auto Color does to the 
colors in your video image, try Auto Contrast instead. 
 
✓ Auto Levels: This effect adjusts all color levels to soften shadows and 
highlights, but it can change the overall color cast of the image. This is 
my favorite effect for making subtle color and light corrections to my 
video images. 
 
✓ Brightness and Contrast: This effect does exactly what the name 
implies. If you just want to adjust the brightness or contrast of a clip, 
this effect can do the job. 
 
 Before you choose the Brightness and Contrast effect, you may want to 
experiment with the Auto Levels, Shadow/Highlight, and Color Balance 
(HLS) effects. Those effects can also fix brightness and contrast prob-
lems, often with more favorable results.
 
✓ Channel Mixer: This effect dynamically mixes color channels in the 
image, and is most useful when converting an image to a black-and-white 
or sepia-tone look. In Chapter 17, I show how to make new video look 
like old-fashioned film using the Channel Mixer effect.
 
✓ Image Control: You can manually adjust the brightness, contrast, hue, 
and saturation of any video clip in Premiere Elements, but the Image 
Control effect makes these adjustments automatically. This is a good 
catchall effect to use if you want to improve video images in a hurry.
 
✓ Shadow/Highlight: Use this effect to improve the appearance of heav-
ily shadowed subjects, or to soften extreme highlights in the image. Use 
this effect if you find that the Auto Levels effect unfavorably changes the 
color cast in the image.
 
The Adjust category also includes two gimmicky effects: Lighting Effects and 
Posterize. These two effects stylize the appearance of video images, but ignore 
those for now because they don’t do true image correction. 

181
 Chapter 10: Improving and Repairing Video Images
In the Image Control category, check out these effects:
 
✓ Black & White: This effect removes color from your video image and 
turns it to grayscale. Technically you could call this effect gimmicky, 
but it is useful for dream or flashback sequences. Alternatively, you may 
want to try desaturating the colors by using the Channel Mixer effect.
 
✓ Color Balance (HSL): This effect allows you to adjust hue, saturation, 
and lightness in the image. It is similar to the Hue/Saturation controls in 
Adobe Photoshop and Photoshop Elements. 
 
✓ Color Balance (RGB): You can make direct changes to the levels of red, 
green, and blue in the image by using this effect.
 
✓ Color Match: This is one of the most powerful effects in Premiere 
Elements, and can match colors between video clips. I show how to use 
the Color Match effect later in this chapter.
 
✓ Color Pass: This effect removes all but one color from a video image. 
Use this effect to place special emphasis on a particular object by 
making everything except that object grayscale. The Color Pass effect 
works best if the object contrasts strongly with the background. Say you 
have footage of a red balloon against a blue wall: Turn everything else 
grayscale to make the red balloon burst with color.
 
✓ Color Replace: Use this effect to replace one color in a video image with 
another. 
 
✓ Gamma Correction: This effect adjusts the brightness of midtones in an 
image without affecting shadows or highlights. I show how to use the 
Gamma Correction effect in the following section.
 
✓ Tint: This effect modifies only the color tint of the image. Use this to 
change the overall color cast of the image.
Making color adjustments
In the preceding section I list the various effects you can use in Premiere 
Elements to fix and repair color and lighting in your video images. In all, you 
will find at least 15 different effects to use, each with varying degrees of util-
ity. Instead of explaining how to use them all, this section focuses on two 
effects that, in my opinion, are most likely to yield good results with the least 
amount of fiddling. You might experiment with other effects and find that 
they work quite well for you. But if you are new to color correction, the fol-
lowing two sections will help you get started. 

182
Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
 
As you correct colors and light, keep in mind that sometimes less is more. I 
don’t mean less light, but rather less editing. Color correction should be done 
sparingly, or else colors can start to look artificial and cartoonish. Fortunately, 
Premiere Elements encourages creative experimentation because color cor-
rections and other edits don’t make permanent changes to your video clips. If 
you don’t like your changes, simply delete the offending color effect from the 
clip, or use the Premiere Elements History palette (Window➪History) to step 
back in time and undo your edits. 
 
The following sections show how to apply color and light changes to an entire 
video clip. However, you can also apply changes to only portions of a clip, 
or have your changes vary as the clip plays. If you don’t want to apply your 
adjustments to the whole video, you must use effect keyframes. I show how to 
use effect keyframes in Chapter 12.
Improving color and light with Auto Levels
When people are new to color correction, a common mistake is to assume 
that dull, lifeless images need more color saturation or adjustments to spe-
cific color channels. More often than not, a hazy or muddy-looking video 
image can be brought to life by simply tweaking the levels of the image. 
 
When talking about images — be they video or still — the term levels refers 
to the amounts of blacks, whites, and midtones in the image. This is called 
the tonal range of the image. The best-looking pictures have a balanced tonal 
range that includes both true blacks and true whites. 
Many video images lack proper tonal range. The problem can be subtle, and 
is often imperceptible to the untrained eye. But once levels are tweaked and 
the tonal range is improved, almost anyone can see an immediate improve-
ment. To fine-tune the levels of your video images, follow these steps:
 
1. Locate a clip you want to improve, and place the CTI on a representa-
tive frame so that it’s displayed in the Monitor. 
 
2. On the Task pane, click the Edit tab and then choose Effects. 
 
3. Under Adjust, click-and-drag the Auto Levels effect and drop it on the 
clip in the Timeline that you want to adjust. 
 
 After you drop the effect, the clip is selected in the Timeline. Auto Levels 
automatically evaluates the clip and applies subtle levels adjustments. 
You may decide that you like the automatic adjustments, in which case, 
you can stop right here. But if you want to make your own fine adjust-
ments, proceed with the following steps. 
 
4. At the bottom of the Edit pane, click the Edit Effects button.
 
 Alternatively, choose Window➪Properties. Clip properties and controls 
appear in the Edit pane. 

183
 Chapter 10: Improving and Repairing Video Images
 
5. Locate Auto Levels in the list of clip controls, and then click the arrow 
to the left of Auto Levels. 
 
 The Auto Levels controls expand, as shown in Figure 10-1.
 
6. Click-and-drag the Black Clip and White Clip sliders left and right to 
make adjustments.
 
 Note how your changes affect the video image in the Monitor. Be subtle! 
Remember that video images may look different when they’re viewed on 
a TV or compressed for Internet viewing. Images that look richly colored 
on your PC monitor may be too dark when viewed elsewhere. 
 
7. Preview the entire clip in the Monitor window.
 
 Do your changes look okay across the entire clip? In some cases, auto-
matic level corrections can fluctuate wildly throughout a clip, causing 
an unpleasant color-strobing appearance. If you see rapid fluctuations, 
increase the Blend With Original setting until the strobing is eliminated. 
 
8. Choose Done at the bottom of the Edit tab when you finish making 
changes.
 
 Remember, err on the side of making only minor, subtle levels 
adjustments.

Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
Reading histograms
Ask anyone who has ever made a PowerPoint 
presentation: Graphs are cool. If “Sales are up” 
sounds like good news, it looks like even better 
news when you say it with a graph. 
Recently, some genius realized that even photos 
and video images can be represented by graphs. 
An image histogram charts the tonal range of the 
image. The tonal range describes the relative 
levels of blacks, whites, and midtones in the pic-
ture. The figure below shows what a histogram 
looks like in Photoshop. Advanced digital still 
cameras — and even some video cameras — 
can also display histograms. 
Histograms can be displayed in Photoshop and 
Premiere Pro. Premiere Elements doesn’t dis-
play histograms, but it’s still good to understand 
what histograms illustrate. Darker light values 
are represented toward the left of the histo-
gram, and lighter values are toward the right. 
Midtones are shown in the middle. 
The histogram shown here is for an image with a 
relatively even tonal distribution, but notice the 
lack of values near the black end of the scale. 
An image that looks hazy and dull often lacks 
true black values, like this one, and increasing 
the Black Clip level in Premiere Elements can 
reduce the hazy appearance and improve the 
overall quality of the image. 
Levels adjustments are tricky if you can’t view 
a histogram. If you need to make more precise 
levels adjustments of your video, you’ll need to 
step up to a more advanced video-editing pro-
gram like Premiere Pro. 
The Auto Levels effect won’t fix images that are badly over- or under-
exposed, but it can improve most clips that fall somewhere in between. I per-
form levels adjustments on almost every video clip I shoot because they’re 
easy to make and provide obvious results. 
 
Effects can be copied from one clip to another. This is handy with the Auto 
Levels effect because it helps you maintain an even light and color appear-
ance across the entire project. When you’re done making adjustments, click 
the effect’s name in the clip properties window and press Ctrl+C to copy the 
effect. Select another clip in the Timeline, and then press Ctrl+V to paste the 
effect to the other clip. Repeat for other clips as needed. 
Fixing poor exposure with Gamma Correction
In the preceding section, I explain how the Auto Levels effect can improve the 
tonal range of any image. For images with basically good exposure — not too 
dark, not too bright — Auto Levels is the best effect to use. But if you have 
more problematic images, you may want to try Gamma Correction instead. 

185
 Chapter 10: Improving and Repairing Video Images
Consider the image in Figure 10-2, where the subject has just stepped out 
of a dark cave into sunlight. When the subject steps into the sun, his face 
becomes too bright and detail washes out of the image. This is not an exam-
ple of exceptional videography, but it is the kind of thing that inevitably hap-
pens when you shoot your own video, especially outside, where you have 
almost no control over lighting.
 
Figure 10-2: 
This clip 
presents a 
tough
 lighting 
situation.
 
To improve the detail and appearance of the dark cave walls in the back-
ground, you could simply increase brightness of the whole video clip, but 
then the subject’s face will turn into even more of a washed-out white blob 
than it already is. Instead, you should brighten the midtones — in my exam-
ple, the cave walls — without affecting the highlights — the subject’s face — 
or shadows. 
Gamma Correction to the rescue! Find the Gamma Correction effect in the 
Image Control category. As with other effects, simply click-and-drag the effect 
from the Edit pane and drop it on the clip you want to adjust. Then use clip 
properties to adjust the Gamma Correction settings.
The baseline setting for the Gamma Correction effect is 10, but in Figure 10-3, 
I have adjusted the control to 7. This adjustment has dramatically improved 
the appearance of the cave in the background, without exacerbating the 
already too bright face of the subject in the foreground.
 
The Gamma Correction effect is especially useful for adjusting light when the 
image looks okay on your computer screen but is too dark or too light when 
viewed on a TV.

Matching Colors with the 
Color Match Effect
Another helpful image enhancement tool provided with Adobe Premiere 
Elements is the Color Match effect. This effect helps you match the colors 
in one video clip with the colors in another video clip. This effect is helpful 
when you have two scenes that were shot with different lighting conditions 
(or even different cameras) and you want to maintain a common look for 
both clips. 
The Color Match effect uses two clips. The sample clip is the clip that has the 
colors or lighting that you like. The target clip is the clip you want to make look 
more like the sample clip. To use the Color Match effect, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Effects on the Edit tab, or choose Window➪Effects.
 
2. Drag-and-drop the Color Match filter from the Image Control category 
to the target clip.
 
3. Make sure that the target clip is selected, and click Edit Effects under 
the Edit tab.
 
4. Click the arrow next to Color Match to expand the Color Match 
options on the Edit pane.
 
5. In the Timeline, place the CTI (Current Time Indicator) somewhere in 
the sample clip.
 
 Ideally the CTI should be stopped on a frame of video that shows repre-
sentative colors that you want to match, as shown in Figure 10-4. 

187
 Chapter 10: Improving and Repairing Video Images
 
 You can use the left- and right-arrow keys on the keyboard to move 
frame-by-frame through a clip. Make sure that the target clip remains 
highlighted in the Timeline, however, so that the Color Match controls 
are still visible under the Edit tab.
 
6. On the Edit pane, choose a method from the Method menu under 
Color Match.
 
 HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) is the most common method used 
for color matching, but you can also choose RGB (red, green, blue) or 
Curves if you want.
 
7. Choose what you want to match using the check boxes at the bottom 
of the Color Match settings.
 
 If you’re using the HSL matching method, you can choose whether you 
want to match hue, saturation, or lightness individually. For example, 
you may find that each clip is adequately lit, but that one has better 
color hue or saturation than the other. In this case, disable the Match 
Lightness option. If you’re using the RGB or Curves matching methods, 
you can choose whether to match red, green, or blue individually.

from the target clip.
 
 Choose a color from a sample point in the target clip. For example, in 
Figures 10-4 and 10-5, I picked spots on a soccer player’s uniform that 
should be about the same color in each clip.

As with many other color-correction tasks, the Color Match filter requires a 
great deal of trial-and-error to achieve the right look.

Stabilizing Shaky Footage
The best way to fix shaky footage is to not shoot shaky footage in the first 
place. As I recommend in Chapters 3 and 18, use tripods, keep the camera 
level with the horizon, and avoid fire hosing (for example, panning back and 
forth wildly across a scene). 
Wouldn’t it be nice if you could always use perfect videographic technique! 
Perfection is, of course, impossible. Everyone who has ever wielded a video 
camera has ended up with some shots that were a little shaky. Modern 
camcorders have built-in image stabilization, but that feature can only do 
so much. If you have shaky footage that you’d like to fix, Premiere Elements 
can help. The Stabilizer effect helps you correct minor shakes in your video. 
Here’s how to use it:
 
1. Click Effects on the Edit pane, or choose Window➪Effects.
 
2. Near the bottom of the list of effects, click-and-drag the Stabilizer 
effect and drop it on a shaky video clip in the Timeline.
 
3. Click Edit Effects on the bottom of the Edit pane to open effect 
controls. 
 
4. Play the clip in the Monitor to preview it, and watch for problems 
such as the black bands shown in Figure 10-6.
 
 The Stabilizer effect works by zooming in slightly on the image, and then 
panning back and forth across the remaining image to make it appear 
smooth and stable on-screen. But if it pans too much, you see black 
bands on the sides, top, or bottom of the image, as shown in Figure 10-6.
 
5. If you see large black bands during playback, place a check mark next 
to Limit To Zoom. 
 
 Stabilization is reduced when you enable the Limit To Zoom option, but 
in most cases the black bars are more objectionable than a little bit of 
camera shake. 
 
6. Click Done when you finish adjusting the Stabilizer effect.

Compositing and Animating 
Video Clips
In This Chapter
▶ Creating blue-screen effects with Videomerge
▶ Using keys for more precise compositing
▶ Animating clips and objects across the screen
▶ Tracking moving objects in video
You can hardly watch a movie or TV show today without seeing impos-
sible scenes. These scenes may involve superheroes flying among 
skyscrapers in a major metropolis, giant monsters chasing hapless humans 
through a jungle, or even a TV weatherman hovering in outer space as he 
describes the swirling weather patterns down on planet Earth (just off the 
coast and poised to ruin your weekend, of course). Scenes like these are cre-
ated using a bit of movie magic called compositing.
Guess what? You don’t have to be a Hollywood movie mogul with a multi-
million-dollar budget to use compositing. With some simple videography 
tricks and Adobe Premiere Elements, you can create composite scenes with 
the best of ’em. In this chapter, I show you how. This chapter also shows 
you how to use the powerful animation features that come with Premiere 
Elements; these features allow you to move video scenes, titles, and other 
graphics across the screen. The last section in this chapter shows you how 
to use Motion Tracking mode in Premiere Elements. This mode tracks moving 
objects in video images, and then lets you apply effects, clip art, or mattes to 
those objects.

Compositing Video Clips
Modern movie viewers have come to expect sophisticated visual illusions — 
starships flying into a space battle, lovers standing on the bow of a long-gone 
ocean liner, or a weatherman standing in front of a moving weather-satellite 
graphic. Compositing is a tool to make such scenes possible. 
 
Fundamental to the process of compositing is the careful layering of images. A 
subject is filmed in front of a solid-colored background — usually a blue or 
green screen — and then the image of the subject is superimposed over a dif-
ferent background. Premiere Elements includes all the tools you need to make 
your own compositing effects, and thanks to the new Videomerge effect, com-
positing is now easier than ever. 
Shooting source footage
Compositing works best if you start with good source footage. In my pro-
fessional video studio at work, we use a fabric blue screen illuminated by 
expensive lights designed specifically for pro video. But you don’t need a pro-
caliber budget to do compositing; in the examples shown in this book, I used 
a roll of cheap vinyl picnic table covering from a local party store. 
Shooting a subject against a solid-colored background is easier said than 
done. The backdrop needs to be as smooth and evenly lit as possible. Here 
are some techniques you might use:
 
✓ Use the sky as your backdrop. Position the camera low and shoot 
upwards at your subject. Unless there are clouds, you can be sure that 
the sky is evenly lit, and your subject isn’t going to cast shadows on it. 
 
 When you use the sky as a background, make sure that backlighting 
doesn’t cause your subject to be too dark. As described in Chapter 3, 
you can compensate for backlighting by putting additional light on the 
foreground subject. 
 
✓ Shoot against a solid-colored wall. An interior wall in your home might 
work, so long as that wall doesn’t have fancy wallpaper or trim. 
 
✓ Use a solid-color background material. The color should contrast with 
the subject. In Figure 11-1, I’ve shot my cat in front of a blue tablecloth.

Merging clips with Videomerge
Adobe knows that sometimes you don’t care about the technical complexi-
ties of moviemaking. You know what edits you want to make, and you want to 
make them fast. Videomerge is a new feature in Premiere Elements that helps 
you do compositing quickly. Videomerge is pretty easy to use:
 
1. Put a background clip in the Video 1 track of your Timeline. 
 
 The background clip is what you want to appear behind your subject. 
The background might show the beach, outer space, or a soccer game.
 
2. In the Timeline, position the CTI (Current Time Indicator) where you 
want the compositing effect to begin.
 
 The background clip should appear in the Monitor.
 
3. In the Task pane, find the clip you want to use as the overlay clip. 
 
 The overlay clip contains the subject that you want to superimpose over 
the background.
 
4. Click-and-drag the overlay clip and drop it on the video image in the 
Monitor.
 
5. Choose Yes in the Videomerge dialog box.
 
 Videomerge identifies the predominant background color in the overlay 
clip and makes it transparent. The overlay clip is inserted into the Video 
2 track in the Timeline, as shown in Figure 11-2.

6. Make sure the overlay clip is selected in the Timeline, and then 
choose Window➪Properties.
 
 Properties for the overlay clip appear on the Edit tab.
 
7. Click the arrow next to Videomerge to expand Videomerge settings.
 
8. If parts of the background aren’t as transparent as you would like, 
place a check mark next to Select Color.
 
 When you enable Select Color, the overlay clip’s background appears.
 
9. Click the eyedropper tool to select it, and then click somewhere on 
the overlay clip’s background.
 
 If the background color is uneven, choose a color that is near the middle 
of the range of background colors. You may need to try clicking in a few 
different areas before you find a Videomerge color that works best. 
 
10. Choose Soft, Normal, or Detailed in the Presets menu.

195
 Chapter 11: Compositing and Animating Video Clips
 
 Soft makes Videomerge more forgiving of uneven background color. Use 
Detailed if Videomerge is causing some subject detail to disappear. In all 
other cases, choose the default setting of Normal.
 
11. Adjust the Tolerance slider to fine-tune the Videomerge sensitivity.
 
 Watch the video image in the Monitor as you make adjustments, to see 
how the image is affected.
 
12. Click Done at the bottom of the Edit tab when you finish adjusting 
Videomerge.
 
The traditional way to do video compositing is to use effects called keys. A 
key identifies a specific color (or range of colors) in a video image, and then 
makes that color transparent. Underlying video clips show through in the 
transparent areas. Keys provide more advanced control over compositing 
than Videomerge. If you find that Videomerge doesn’t work quite as well as 
you hoped, try using keys as described in the next section.
Using keys for precise compositing
Videomerge makes compositing easy, but it’s pretty basic. If you want 
more precise control over compositing, you can use one of the pro-quality 
keys that comes with Premiere Elements. To view a list of the keys, choose 
Window➪Effects, or click Effects on the Edit tab. Premiere Elements’ keys are
 
✓ Alpha Adjust: This key works a lot like the opacity controls (described 
later in this chapter); it’s for still graphics that have an alpha channel. 
Use this key to adjust opacity of the whole graphic, or to ignore, invert, 
or mask the picture’s alpha channel.
 
✓ Blue Screen: Use this key when you’ve shot video with the subject in 
front of a blue screen. The blue screen must be well lit and brilliant for 
this key to be effective. Shadows reduce the effectiveness of this key.
 
✓ Chroma: Chroma is just a fancy word for color. This key enables you to 
key out (for example, remove) a specific color or range of color. With 
some fine-tuning, you can use this key with almost any clip.
 
✓ Mattes: Use matte keys (such as Garbage Matte) to manually remove 
undesired objects from video images. An easier way to do this is to use 
Motion Tracking mode, which I describe later in this chapter. 
 
✓ Green Screen: This key works just like the Blue Screen matte except it 
uses (surprise) green rather than blue. 
 
✓ Luma: The Luma key is sort of like the Chroma key, except that instead 
of keying out a specific color, it keys out a specific brightness.

196
Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
 
✓ Non-Red: This key works like the Blue Screen and Green Screen keys, 
but it keys out both blue and green screens. Try this key if you get rough 
edges (called stair-stepping) with the Blue or Green Screen keys.
 
✓ RGB Difference: The RGB Difference key is basically a less-powerful 
chroma key. Videomerge (described earlier in this chapter) is basically 
an RGB Difference key. 
Applying a key to a clip is pretty easy. Follow these steps:
 
1. Place an overlay clip in track Video 2 or higher. 
 
 Video 2 and higher-numbered tracks are all superimpose tracks because 
that’s where you superimpose images over the background. 
 
2. Click the overlay clip to select it, and put the CTI on the clip.
 
3. Choose Window➪Effects to open the list of Effects.
 
4. Drag-and-drop a key from the Edit tab to the overlay clip.
 
5. Choose Window➪Properties to open the clip properties.
 
 The key you applied in Step 4 appears in the properties list.
 
6. Click the arrow next to the key to expand its controls.
 
 If the key uses color information — like the Chroma key, for example — 
you may need to choose a base transparency color. If you don’t need to 
choose a base color, skip to Step 8.
 
7. Click the eyedropper next to Color in the key controls, and then click 
a color in the Monitor that you want to key out.
 
8. Adjust any other settings that may be available.
 
 Each key is different, so experiment with the settings to achieve the best 
result. In Figure 11-3, I adjusted the Similarity and Blend settings.
 
Here’s how keys work: The key recognizes certain colors, such as the special 
shades often used in blue or green screens. Anything in the video that matches 
this shade — including that wacky blue tie your subject is wearing — is made 
transparent by the key. Everything else is placed on a virtual “glass slide” and 
superimposed over the background. Pretty slick, eh?

Adjusting clip transparency
Compositing usually means making portions of a video clip transparent by 
using Videomerge or a key. But you can also make an entire video clip more 
transparent. Another way of saying more transparent is less opaque. If you 
can see through a clip, it’s transparent. If you can’t see through the clip, it’s 
opaque. In the jargon of Premiere Elements, you adjust opacity rather than 
transparency. To adjust the opacity of a clip, follow these steps:
 
1. Add a clip to the Video 1 track in the Timeline.
 
 Video 1 is the background layer that shows through when you make 
superimposed clips transparent.
 
2. Add a clip to a superimpose track, as shown in Figure 11-4.
 
 Video 2 and higher tracks are all considered superimpose tracks.
 
3. Click the clip that you want to adjust, and position the CTI over it.
 
 The clip is selected, and its image appears in the Monitor.

198
Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
 
4. Make sure that the words Opacity:Clip Opacity appear next to the 
clip’s name in the Timeline.
 
 If you see the word Motion instead, click Motion and choose 
Opacity➪Clip Opacity from the drop-down menu that appears. A black 
line appears across the clip. This is the Opacity rubberband.
 
5. To make the clip transparent, drag the Opacity rubberband down. 
 
 As you drag the rubberband down, the clip becomes more transparent. 
As you drag it up, it becomes more opaque.
 
You can adjust opacity over time using keyframes. See Chapter 12 for more on 
controlling opacity, keys, and other effects by using keyframes.

Animating Video Clips
I know what you’re thinking — Why do I need to animate a video clip in which 
the subjects are already moving? You may not need to animate the actual sub-
jects in the video, but you can move the video image across the screen. For 
example, a small picture-in-picture image could sail across the screen to give 
a hint of action that will happen later in the movie. But wait — there’s more. 
You can move a clip across the screen along a fixed path or a zigzag pattern, 
rotate clips, and distort clips. To begin animating a clip, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the clip in the Timeline that you want to animate to select it, and 
make sure that the CTI is somewhere over the clip.
 
 Just about any clip that you animate should be in a superimpose track — 
that is, the clip should occupy any track above Video 1.

199
 Chapter 11: Compositing and Animating Video Clips
 
2. Choose Window➪Properties to open the properties window for the 
selected clip.
 
3. Click the right-pointing arrow next to the Motion heading to expand 
the Motion controls.
Now you’re ready to start animating the video clip. The next couple of sec-
tions show you how to use the clip Motion controls in Premiere Elements. 
You can use the Motion controls to move or resize video clips.
Resizing a clip with Motion controls
Motion controls give you command over the size and position of clips. To 
adjust basic Motion controls, click a clip’s image in the Monitor, and then 
click-and-drag corners of the video image to resize it (see Figure 11-5). To 
move the clip, click-and-drag the circle in the middle of the clip. For more 
precise control, use these controls under Motion in the clip properties:
 
✓ Position: The position of the clip is expressed in pixels along an X (hori-
zontal) and Y (vertical) axis. Zero for the X axis is the left edge of the 
screen, and zero for the Y axis is the top of the screen. The default posi-
tion for any clip is right in the middle. 
 
✓ Scale: The default scale for any clip is 100, which means it takes up the 
whole screen. Reduce the scale to shrink the image size.
 
✓ Scale Width: If you remove the check mark next to Constrain 
Proportions, you can adjust height and width independently. With 
Constrain Proportions unchecked, the Scale control adjusts height, and 
the Scale Width control adjusts width. Just keep in mind that adjusting 
height and width independently distorts the video image.
 
✓ Rotation: Use this control to rotate the clip. Click-and-drag left or right 
on the clock-style rotation control to spin the image on its axis.
 
✓ Anchor Point: All the other controls work off the clip’s anchor point, 
which is usually in the center of the clip. Adjust this control to move the 
anchor point to the corner or any other part of the clip.
 
✓ Anti-flicker Filter: If you notice flickering lines at the top or bottom of a 
resized image, adjust the Anti-flicker Filter slider to correct the problem.

Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
Moving clips across the screen
As you play with the Motion controls, you’ll quickly see how easy it is to 
change the on-screen position, size, and orientation of a clip. But what if you 
want the clip to move across the screen after you’ve shrunk it? To do this, 
you must use effect keyframes. Effect keyframes are reference points used by 
Premiere Elements to define the starting and ending points for effects and 
other changes. I explain keyframes in greater detail in Chapter 12, but to con-
trol motion with keyframes, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the clip you want to animate in the Timeline to select it.
 
2. Move the CTI to the beginning of the selected clip.
 
 The easiest way to do this is to first position the CTI somewhere over 
the clip, and then press Page Up on your keyboard.
 
3. Choose Window➪Properties to reveal the clip properties, if they 
aren’t open already. 
 
4. Click the Show/Hide Keyframes button (see Figure 11-5) to reveal a 
mini-timeline for the clip.
 
5. In the Motion controls for the selected clip, click the Toggle Animation 
button next to the control you want to animate.
 
 For example, Figure 11-5 shows the Position and Scale controls being 
animated.
 
6. Adjust the Scale, Position, and any other Motion controls you want to 
change.
 
 These settings represent what the clip looks like and where it’s posi-
tioned at the start of the animation.
 
7. Click the Timeline window to make it active, and press Page Down to 
move the CTI to the end of the clip.
 
8. Adjust the Scale, Position, and any other Motion controls for the clip.
 
 These settings represent what the clip looks like and where it’s posi-
tioned at the end of the animation.
 
 Premiere Elements automatically creates keyframes at the beginning and 
end of the clip and automatically calculates how the clip should move 
and change to steadily go from one keyframe to the next. 
 
In Figure 11-5, the animation in the clip begins on-screen in the lower-right 
corner, and the clip then expands to full size to fill the screen. You can add 
additional keyframes along the clip’s path to make more dynamic changes.

Tracking Moving Objects
You’re watching a video clip and realize, “The only thing that would make 
this scene better is a silly hat.” You could reshoot the scene and make your 
subject wear a silly hat, but that’s a lot of work and silly hats are expensive. 
An easier solution is to use Motion Tracking mode in Premiere Elements. 
Motion Tracking mode identifies moving objects in video images. You can 
then apply effects or clip art images that move with those objects across the 
screen. To use Motion Tracking mode, follow these steps:
 
1. Position the CTI over a clip containing objects you want to track, and 
click the clip to select it. 
 
 Motion Tracking mode works only on analyzed clips. See Chapter 5 for 
more on auto analyzing clips. 
 
2. Click the Motion Tracking mode button on the Timeline. 
 
 Yellow boxes appear around moving objects in the video image, as 
shown in Figure 11-6. 
 
3. Click the box around the object you want to track. 
 
 The box turns blue, and a list of clip art appears in the Task pane. 

202
Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
 
4. Find a piece of clip art you want to use, and drag and drop it onto the 
blue box in the Monitor. 
 
5. Use the handles to move and resize the clip art. 
 
6. Click Add Object above the Monitor. 
 
7. Play the Timeline to preview the motion tracking effect. 
If you aren’t happy with the result, select the clip art clip in the Timeline and 
fine-tune its size and position by using Motion controls and keyframes, as 
described earlier in this chapter. Motion Tracking mode can also be used to 
apply effects to certain areas of a video image. For example, if your Old West 
scene is spoiled by an airplane flying in the background, use Motion Tracking 
mode to apply a garbage matte that hides the airplane.

▶ Putting a picture in a picture
A
dobe Premiere was first released in 1993, making it one of the first 
video-editing programs for desktop computers. Many competitors 
have come onto the market over the years — Adobe Premiere Elements now 
shares the stage with other affordable moviemaking programs like Pinnacle 
Studio, Microsoft Windows Movie Maker, and others.
Not all video-editing programs are created equal, however. Many programs 
offer special effects, but few offer the quality and variety available with 
Adobe Premiere Elements — over 90 professional-grade effects. And you can 
add even more effects available from third-party vendors. What’s more, each 
effect in Premiere Elements is fully customizable, giving you full creative con-
trol over the intensity and timing of each effect. 
Effects can help you improve video quality or add special touches that amaze 
and astound your audience. Effects can be added to any video clip, and the 
changes they make aren’t permanent so you can remove them if you change 
your mind. Although this book can’t cover all 90 effects in detail, this chapter 
does show you the basics of using effects — including the brass-tacks specif-
ics of using several common effects.
Surveying Effects
Adobe Premiere Elements comes with more than 90 effects. Some effects may 
not seem immediately useful, but you may be surprised someday to find that 
a seemingly obscure effect suddenly comes in handy. You can get a look at 

204
Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
all the effects Premiere Elements serves up by choosing Window➪Effects, or 
clicking the Edit tab in the Task pane and then clicking Effects. Video effects 
are organized into 19 categories. (See Chapter 8 for information about audio 
effects.) The following sections provide an overview of the effects available 
to you in Premiere Elements.
 
Just like transitions and other edits, video effects are meant to enhance the 
content of your movie, not showcase your editing skills. Choose and use 
effects carefully — and only when they serve your editing style.
Adjust
The ten effects in the Adjust category let you tweak levels of color and light. 
They can be useful for fixing color- and light-related problems in your video 
clips. I describe most of the Adjust effects in Chapter 10. One effect that I 
don’t cover in Chapter 10 — the Extract effect — removes all trace of color 
from a clip, as shown in Figure 12-1. This effect can be used to create an inter-
esting background for a title screen.
 
Figure 12-1: 
The Extract 
effect 
removes all 
color from 
a clip.
 
Blur & Sharpen
You find five effects in the Blur & Sharpen effects category, including the 
following:
 
✓ Antialias: This effect blends edges together through an anti-aliasing pro-
cess. Anti-aliasing blends colors in adjacent pixels to reduce the “stair-
step” appearance that sometimes happens to curves in digital images. 
Sometimes anti-aliasing smoothes the appearance of the image; other 
times it just makes the whole image look blurry.

205
 Chapter 12: Adding Special Effects to Your Movies
 
✓ Fast Blur: Use this effect to soften outlines to simulate disorientation, or 
to suggest speed by “unfocusing” parts of the video image. 
 
 
A blur effect can be used like a transition to make it appear that the 
camera starts out blurry and then focuses in on the clip. This technique 
can be effective when simulating the view of a person who is waking up 
from a slumber or coma. Use keyframes (described later in this chapter) 
to make the image start out blurry and then gradually come into focus.
 
✓ Gaussian Blur: This effect is similar to Fast Blur, but it also removes 
noise (specs or visual “static”) from the image. Gaussian Blur can’t blur 
an image quite as much as the Fast Blur effect.
 
✓ Ghosting: This effect creates ghost images of moving objects on-screen, 
and can often be used to place increased emphasis on the path of 
motion. 
 
✓ Sharpen: This effect sharpens images that appear too soft or slightly 
out-of-focus. Be careful when using this effect on clips with a lot of 
motion — moving objects may appear to have blocky edges.
Channel
The Channel category contains only the Invert effect. This effect inverts 
colors in a clip so that the image looks like a photographic negative. Use this 
effect to add a psychedelic or “sci-fi” look to a video image.
Distort
The Distort category contains ten effects that bend, twist, exaggerate, or oth-
erwise distort your video images so that they look like they are being viewed 
through a fun-house mirror. The Distort effects include
 
✓ Bend: The video image is bent both horizontally and vertically in a 
series of waves. The waves move as the clip plays, giving viewers the 
impression that they are viewing the scene from underwater. 
 
✓ Corner Pin: The video image is pinned to a corner, hence the name. Use 
Corner pin to make the video image appear to be on a different plane 
from the viewing screen. 
 
✓ Lens Distortion: This effect distorts the image to look like it is being 
viewed through the bottom of a soda-pop bottle or another distorted 
lens. 

206
Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
 
✓ Mirror: Give the appearance that part of your video image rests on a 
mirror or reflecting pool with this effect. You can adjust the angle and 
center point of the reflection.
 
✓ Polar Coordinates: If the Bend or Lens Distortion effects don’t pro-
vide quite enough distortion for your tastes, try this effect. Pixels are 
adjusted to give the appearance of extreme image distortion, like por-
tions of the video image are being pulled like taffy.
 
✓ Ripple: Similar to the Bend effect, this effect adds ripples to the video 
image, like ripples in water. 
 
✓ Spherize: This effect makes it appear as though you are viewing the 
video through a thickly curved lens. 
 
✓ Transform: Use this effect to turn or skew the image in the two-dimen-
sional plane.
 
✓ Twirl: Twirl the video image into a vortex.
 
✓ Wave Warp: This effect warps and waves the video image as it plays. 
Generate
When the Sun or a bright light reflects on a camera lens, it causes a bright spot 
called a lens flare. Usually, photographers and videographers try to avoid lens 
flares, but if you want to add a simulated lens flare to your video — flares can 
enhance the feeling of being in a hot desert, for example — use the Lens Flare 
effect found in the Generate category.
GPU effects
The graphics processing units (GPUs) in most modern video cards allow 
advanced visual effects. The three GPU effects in Premiere Elements take 
advantage of the power in modern GPUs to display visually complex effects 
like water ripples, page curls, or lens refraction.
Image Control
The eight effects in the Image Control category change the way color is 
viewed in your clips. They can remove a color (or range of colors) from a 
clip, convert a color image to black-and-white, or adjust the overall tint of the 

207
 Chapter 12: Adding Special Effects to Your Movies
image (which you will find useful if, for example, you want to transform an 
ordinary outdoor scene into an alien landscape). Chapter 10 shows you how 
to use the Image Control effects in greater detail.
Keying
The effects in the Keying effects category allow you to control transparency in 
clips and perform compositing effects such as blue screening. (See Chapter 11 
for more on using keys in your video projects.)
NewBlue effects
NewBlue is a third-party video content and effects developer that provides 12 
snazzy effects for use with Premiere Elements. Divided into three categories, 
the NewBlue effects make otherwise complex edits easy. The Old Film effect, 
for example, simulates the look of old movies, complete with monochrome 
colors and fake film scratches (thin vertical lines that show up in the film 
image).
Perspective
The four effects you find in the Perspective category add a three-dimensional 
feel to your clips. They include
 
✓ Basic 3D: This effect turns and tilts your image on a plane. You can 
move the corners of the video image to give the appearance that the 
image is on a plane that is not parallel with the viewing screen.
 
✓ Bevel Alpha: If an image doesn’t fill the entire screen, use this effect to 
smoothly bevel the edges of the image. 
 
✓ Bevel Edges: This is similar to Bevel Alpha effect, except that the edge 
bevels are rectangular rather than softly rounded. 
 
✓ Drop Shadow: A drop shadow sometimes comes in handy behind titles 
or picture-in-picture windows. 
Pixelate
The Pixelate category contains only the Facet effect, which modifies the 
pixels in your video image to create a textured appearance.

Render
The two Render effects allow you to simulate the look and feel of real light. 
The Render effects are
 
✓ Lightning: The Lightning effect is kind of cool because it creates realistic 
lightning on-screen. Simulated lightning created by this effect is much 
safer to work with than the real thing.
 
✓ Ramp: This effect creates a color gradient on the screen. Adjust the 
Blend With Original setting to make the original video image show 
through the gradient. This effect is of limited use, though you may find 
it helpful when you want to put titles on the screen and want to slightly 
soften or darken the background image without totally hiding it.
Stylize
The ten effects in the Stylize effect category create a variety of image 
modifications:
 
✓ Alpha Glow: If your image includes a masked alpha channel (usually a 
still graphic from Adobe Photoshop Elements with a transparent layer), 
this effect creates a glow around the alpha channel.
 
✓ Color Emboss: This effect creates an embossed appearance to the clip 
without changing any of the clip’s original colors. This usually gives the 
video image a cartoonish appearance.
 
✓ Emboss: The image is given an embossed appearance, and most color 
information is removed. 
 
✓ Find Edges: Major edges in the image are identified and replaced with 
black lines, and the rest of the image information is discarded. This 
effect works well for creating backgrounds for title screens.
 
✓ Mosaic: The image is blurred in a block pattern for a pixelated 
appearance. 
 
✓ Noise: Do not attempt to adjust the transmission! This effect adds artifi-
cial video noise to the image, as if the viewer has poor antenna 
reception.
 
✓ Replicate: Duplicate a single video image, as shown in Figure 12-2.
 
✓ Solarize: This effect blends the image with its negative. It is similar to 
the Invert effect, except that you can adjust the blend along a scale from 
zero (normal) to 100 (full negative). 

209
 Chapter 12: Adding Special Effects to Your Movies
 
✓ Strobe Light: Flash your video image on and off, using this effect. Just be 
careful not to give your audience members seizures!
 
✓ Texturize: This effect applies the apparent texture from one clip to 
another clip.

Time
In the Time category, you can find two effects. The Echo effect creates visual 
echoes (or a double-image) of a picture. Look here also for the Posterize 
Time effect, which modifies the apparent frame rate of a clip. Use this effect 
to make it look like you are a cable news channel correspondent broadcast-
ing via video phone from the other side of the world.
Transform
The nine effects in the Transform category transform the view of your clip in 
a variety of interesting and sometimes humorous ways:
 
✓ Camera View: Use this to simulate various camera angles and views. 
 
✓ Clip: This basic effect trims off portions of the video image. This may 
come in handy if you want to create a black bar on the side of the screen 
to insert some bulleted points.
 
✓ Crop: This effect is similar to the Clip effect, but it adds the zoom 
feature, which appears to zoom the image off the edge of the screen.

210
Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
 
✓ Edge Feather: Use this effect to create a feathered frame around the 
edge of your video image.
 
✓ Horizontal Flip: The image is flipped horizontally.
 
✓ Horizontal Hold: This effect simulates TV horizontal-hold problems. 
 
✓ Roll: The image appears to roll horizontally across the screen.
 
✓ Vertical Flip: The image is flipped vertically.
 
✓ Vertical Hold: Use this effect to simulate TV vertical-hold problems. 
(Just imagine your friends banging on their old TVs trying to figure out 
why the vertical hold is messed up!)
Video Stabilizer
If the video you recorded is shaky and jittery and you aren’t going for an 
earthquake look, you can use the Stabilizer effect to smooth out some of the 
video shakes. I show how to use the Stabilizer in Chapter 10. 
Videomerge
Videomerge is basically an RGB (red-green-blue) difference key that helps 
you easily do compositing effects like the ones I describe in Chapter 11. 
Usually Videomerge is applied automatically when you perform certain kinds 
of edits. Chapter 11 shows you what those certain kinds of edits are.
Taking Control of Visual Effects
To apply an effect to a clip, drag the effect from the Task pane and drop it on 
a clip in the Timeline. (Choose Window➪Effects to open the list of effects.) 
You can also adjust attributes of an effect by using the Task pane. To reveal 
effect controls, click the clip in the Timeline to select it and then choose 
Window➪Properties. The effect controls appear, as shown in Figure 12-3. Key 
features of the effect controls include
 
✓ On the left side of the effect controls, next to each effect’s title, is a tiny 
eye. To disable an effect, click the eye to remove it. You can see the eye 
displayed in Figure 12-3 next to the Camera View effect.
 
✓ Each effect has its own unique controls. Click the right-pointing arrow 
next to an effect control to view more specific controls. The Camera 
View effect, for example, enables you to adjust longitude, latitude, and 
more.

211
 Chapter 12: Adding Special Effects to Your Movies
 
✓ To enable keyframing so that the effect can change over the duration of 
a clip, click the Toggle Animation button, as shown in Figure 12-3. I show 
you how to use keyframes in the next section.
 
✓ The effect controls window can display a keyframe viewer, which, as you 
can see in Figure 12-3, looks like a miniature Timeline, complete with its 
own CTI (Current Time Indicator). To reveal the keyframe viewer, click 
the Show/Hide Keyframes button, as shown in Figure 12-3. 
 
✓ To add a keyframe for a control at the current location of the CTI, click 
the Add/Remove Keyframe button. Use the arrows on either side of any 
Add/Remove Keyframe button to move the CTI to the next (or previous) 
keyframe.
 
✓ Some effects have Color Pickers. For example, if you’re using the Camera 
View effect, shown in Figure 12-3, you use the Color Picker to choose a 
fill color for the background after the camera view has been modified. In 
Figure 12-3, the current background color is white. 
 
 
Some Color Pickers have eyedroppers next to them. Eyedroppers are 
used to choose a color from the video image in the Monitor. To use an 
eyedropper, click the eyedropper icon, move the mouse pointer over 
the desired color in the video image, and then click on the color. Your 
desired color is selected when the mouse button is released.

Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
Using Keyframes
Effects can have a variety of, er, effects on clips in Premiere Elements. 
You can blur, recolor, distort, and more. You can apply an effect so that it 
changes the clip uniformly across its entire duration, or you can customize 
the effect so that it changes over time. To make an effect change as it plays, 
you need to tell Premiere Elements what those changes will be and when 
they should happen. You do this by using reference points called keyframes. 
Premiere Elements automatically extrapolates changes from one keyframe to 
the next.
 
The types of keyframes I talk about in this chapter are effect keyframes. Video 
codecs (the compression/decompression schemes used to shrink video file 
sizes) use compression key frames. Although the names sound familiar, the two 
terms refer to very different things. (See Chapter 15 for a more detailed expla-
nation of compression key frames.)
After you have applied an effect to a clip, you can adjust that effect using 
keyframes. To set keyframes, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Timeline, locate the clip you want to modify.
 
2. Select the clip, and then open the effect controls for the clip 
(Window➪Properties) if they aren’t already open.
 
3. Click the Show/Hide Keyframes button to open the keyframes viewer.
 
4. Click the Toggle Animation button next to the name of the effect.
 
 The Toggle Animation button enables the use of keyframes for the effect. 
If Toggle Animation is disabled, the effect is applied evenly across the 
entire clip.
 
5. Move the CTI in the keyframes viewer to the exact frame where you 
want to set a keyframe.
 
 You can move the CTI using the playback controls in the Monitor 
window, or you can use the J, K, and L keys on your keyboard. Use the 
left- and right-arrow keys to move a single frame at a time.
 
6. Click the Add/Remove Keyframe button next to an effect control.
 
 You need to add a keyframe for each control that you want to change. 
For example, if you apply the Camera View effect (refer to Figure 12-3), 
and you only want the camera view to change after the clip has played 
for a few seconds, set all the controls to their defaults at the first key-
frame. At the second keyframe, adjust the Longitude, Focal Length, 
Distance, and Zoom controls to the desired settings. These changes 
cause the clip to play normally from the beginning until it reaches the 
first keyframe. At that point, the camera angle starts to morph until it 
gets to the settings you specify at the second keyframe. 

213
 Chapter 12: Adding Special Effects to Your Movies
 
7. Set additional keyframes as desired.
 
 Don’t forget to use those Previous and Next Keyframe buttons. They 
provide an easy way to move from keyframe to keyframe. If you want 
to remove a keyframe, simply move to the keyframe and click the Add/
Delete Keyframe button to remove the check mark. 
 
If you apply multiple effects to a clip, each effect gets its own keyframes. Thus, 
if you set a keyframe for one effect, don’t assume that it applies to the other 
effects on that clip as well. To view the keyframes for an effect, click that effect 
in the clip properties to select it.
Removing Effects
You’ll probably change your mind about some of the effects you apply 
to your clips. Don’t worry; this is perfectly natural. A lot of video editing 
involves good ol’ trial-and-error. You’ll try an effect, you won’t like it, and 
then you’ll try something else. To get rid of an effect, click the clip in the 
Timeline to select it, and then choose Window➪Properties to reveal the 
effect controls. You have two options for removing effects from a clip:
 
✓ Temporary disability: You can temporarily disable an effect by click-
ing the little eye next to the effect’s listing in the effect controls. This 
is a handy option because your effect settings are preserved. Disabled 
effects are not applied when the movie is rendered or output.
 
✓ Permanent leave: To delete an effect from a clip, click its title in the 
effect controls and then click the Trash can button at the bottom of 
the Task pane. Don’t worry! The effect is not deleted from Premiere 
Elements; you’re only removing it from the current clip.
Working with Effect Presets
When Adobe decided to create an “Elements” version of Premiere, the 
goal was to create a program that is easier to use than Premiere Pro. This 
included the effects editing process, because let’s face it: Adjusting multiple 
effect controls and setting keyframes can be complex and time consuming. 
To make it easier to use and modify video effects, Premiere Elements comes 
with a collection of effect presets. Presets are preprogrammed effect set-
tings that perform common tasks like panning across still images or creating 
picture-in-picture (PiP) effects. Instead of spending minutes or even hours 
fine-tuning motion controls, keyframes, and other settings, you just drop a 
predesigned preset onto the clip. Presets are timesaving tools that even vet-
eran video professionals appreciate. 

214
Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
Using a preset is easy. Just drag and drop a preset from the Effects window 
to a video clip, just like any other effect. Preset settings are applied automati-
cally, but you can still fine-tune those settings if you want. 
Surveying effect presets
You can find Effect presets in the Effects window under the Task pane’s Edit 
tab (Window➪Effects). In the menu in the upper-left corner of the list of 
effects (by default it says Video Effects), choose Presets. Like standard video 
effects, effect presets are organized into several categories. They are
 
✓ Bevel Edges: The two presets in this category quickly bevel the edges of 
the video image, providing a beveled picture frame appearance.
 
✓ Blurs: The Fast Blur In preset causes the clip to begin extremely blurry. 
The picture quickly comes into focus and the clip plays normally to the 
end. Fast Blur Out is similar, but the image blurs at the end of the clip.
 
✓ Color Effects: These 13 presets quickly apply color changes to a clip. 
For example, if you want to quickly give a radically red tint to the clip, 
apply the Hyper Tint Red preset. The Increase Saturation preset quickly 
increases color saturation to improve clips that are sun washed or oth-
erwise lack color depth.
 
✓ Drop Shadows: Drop shadows can be used behind picture-in-picture 
windows, still graphics, titles, and other things. Premiere Elements 
includes eight drop-shadow presets. 
 
✓ Horizontal Image Pans: If you’ve used Apple’s iMovie (available only for 
Macs), you may be familiar with the Ken Burns effects that come with 
that program. The Horizontal Image Pan presets in Premiere Elements 
are similar to Apple’s Ken Burns effects. They help you pan across still 
images that would otherwise sit static and lifeless on the screen. Movies 
by renowned documentarian Ken Burns often use this technique. The 
historical subject matter of Burns’s films usually requires many still 
images, and panning slowly across those images restores a sense of 
dynamic motion that viewers expect from video.
 
✓ Horizontal Image Zooms: Similar to the image pan presets, the 
Horizontal Image Zoom presets zoom in or out on an image. I especially 
like to use these presets on titles. Titles that zoom in or out of view are 
very cool when they aren’t overdone.
 
✓ Mosaics: These two presets are much like the Blur presets, but the 
image “mosaics” in or out rather than blurs.

215
 Chapter 12: Adding Special Effects to Your Movies
 
✓ PiPs: PiP stands for picture-in-picture, and these are my favorite presets. 
I show you how to use PiP presets later in this chapter.
 
✓ Solarizes: As I mention earlier in this chapter, the Solarize effect blends 
an image with its negative. The two Solarize presets make a clip “solar-
ize” in or out as it plays. 
 
✓ Twirls: Do you want a video image to twirl into view or twirl out in a 
vortex? Apply one of the Twirl presets to quickly create this effect.
 
✓ Vertical Image Pans: These presets are just like the Horizontal Image 
Pans, but they pan vertically rather than horizontally.
 
 
Maybe you’re wondering if you can combine vertical and horizontal 
zooms or pans to create diagonal effects. It sounds like a good idea, 
but — alas — it doesn’t work. These presets change motion settings, so 
when you apply one preset it displaces motion settings made by another 
preset. A diagonal effect requires manual adjustment of existing presets. 
Play with it if you have a few hours to spare.
 
✓ Vertical Image Zooms: Yep, you guessed it. Vertical Image Zooms are 
just up-and-down versions of the left-and-right Horizontal Image Zooms. 
Saving your own presets
If you have your own custom effect settings that you like to use on a regular 
basis, you can save those settings in a preset of your own. For example, if 
you apply a horizontal image pan preset to an image and then fine-tune the 
Motion settings so that the image actually pans diagonally, you may want to 
save your own “diagonal pan” preset. To save a preset, follow these steps:
 
1. Adjust your effect settings the way you like them.
 
2. In the effect controls, right-click the name of the effect you want to 
save and choose Save Preset from the menu that appears.
 
3. In the Save Preset dialog box that appears, enter a descriptive name 
for the preset in the Name field.
 
4. Choose a Type setting for the preset.
 
 Your options are Scale, Anchor to In Point, and Anchor to Out Point. 
Anchor to In Point means that the effect will begin at the clip’s In point. 
Anchor to Out Point means the preset will be applied to the end of the 
clip. Scale simply scales the effect to encompass the entire clip. 

216
Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
 
5. Enter a description for the preset in the Description field. 
 
 This information is important because several months from now you 
may forget exactly what this preset does — even if you have given it an 
exciting and descriptive name.
 
6. Click OK to save the preset and close the dialog box.
When you save your own preset, the preset is added to the Effects window 
on the Task pane. Choose Window➪Effects, and then choose My Presets in 
the menu in the upper-left corner of the effects list. Drag-and-drop presets to 
clips to apply them, just like any other effect or preset.
Using Some Common Video Effects
Lots of effects are available with Premiere Elements, and unfortunately I don’t 
have room to describe them all in detail. What I can do is provide detailed 
instructions on how to apply a few common video effects. You can adapt the 
techniques described here when using many other effects.
Stylizing video images
I like to think of each movie project as a delicious recipe. Every recipe starts 
with a main ingredient, which in the case of a movie is your video footage. 
Like a salmon filet, video footage may be pretty good all by itself, but it can 
be enhanced with some creative seasoning. Video effects are like seasonings; 
you don’t eat fresh dill or ground pepper alone, but add just the right season-
ings to your source footage, plus a liberal splash of creative juices — butter 
and lemon juice for salmon — and the finished product will be delectable!
If you’re hungry now, go grab dinner or a snack. When you’re done, consider 
the cinematic spice rack in Premiere Elements, which holds almost 100 video 
effects. But like ketchup and salmon, some things don’t go well together. 
Choose effects that contribute to the desired feel of your movie. Remember, 
you’re trying to make a great movie, not show off your editing skills. 
Many video effects help you stylize the video image. Consider the way color 
tints affect the look and feel of movies like The Matrix or 300. Subtle color 
casts can give the film a dreary tone (as in The Matrix) or suggest the look of 
a graphic novel (as in 300). You can stylize the color of your movies by using 
the Colorize effect, one of the NewBlue effects that comes with Premiere 
Elements. To use the Colorize effect, follow these steps:

217
 Chapter 12: Adding Special Effects to Your Movies
 
1. Open the Effects window by choosing Window➪Effects, and scroll 
down to the NewBlue Art Effects Elements category.
 
2. Click-and-drag the Colorize effect and drop it on a clip in the Timeline.
 
3. Make sure that the clip is selected in the Timeline, and then choose 
Window➪Properties.
 
 The effect controls for the selected clip appear in the Task pane.
 
4. Locate the Colorize effect in the list of clip properties, and click the 
right-pointing arrow next to Colorize to expand the list of controls, as 
shown in Figure 12-4.
 
 If you don’t see Colorize or other controls on the Task pane, click the 
clip in the Timeline to make sure that the clip is selected.
 
5. Click the color swatch next to Color A, and then choose a color in the 
Color Picker that appears. 
 
 Color A will be the predominant color tint appearing in the video clip. 
After you choose a color, click OK to close the Color Picker. 
 
 
Alternatively, click the eyedropper next to the color swatch in the effect 
controls, and then select a color somewhere in the Monitor’s video 
image. 
 
6. Click the color swatch next to Color B, and then choose a color in the 
Color Picker that appears. 
 
 Color B will be the secondary color used in the clip. All other color will 
be removed from the clip. In the example shown in Figure 12-4, I have 
selected red as Color A and blue as Color B, effectively eliminating green 
from the image. Considering that the original scene had a lot of green in 
the foliage and ground cover, this effect gives the image an almost other-
worldly appearance while still seeming natural. 
 
7. Click-and-drag the Strength sliders for Color A and Color B to achieve 
the desired color intensity. 
 
 As with most video effects, this is where you’ll spend a lot of time exper-
imenting.
 
8. Play the clip and watch for visual problems.
 
 With the Colorize effect, one problem you may encounter is large areas 
that seem to have no color at all. Adjust the strength sliders or the Color 
A and Color B colors until the video image looks how you want it.

Disorienting your audience
Suppose a subject in a movie is sick or disoriented. What is the best way to 
communicate this to the audience? You could have someone in the movie 
say, “Hey, you don’t look well. Are you sick?” Then the unwell person can 
stumble and fall down. That may be effective, but an even better way to 
convey a feeling of illness or confusion is to let your audience see through 
the subject’s blurry and distorted eyes.
You can begin by shooting some footage from the subject’s point of view. 
Hand-hold the camera and let it move slightly as you walk. You probably 
don’t need to exaggerate the movement, but the camera shouldn’t be tripod-
stable either. As you shoot, pan across the scene — but not too quickly — as 
if the subject were looking around the room, confused by his surroundings. 
Occasionally you may want to dip the camera slightly left or right so the 
video image appears to tilt. A tilting video image has a strong disorienting 
effect on the viewer.
Now that you have footage to work with, you can perform the real magic in 
Premiere Elements. One effect that can provide a feeling of illness or disorien-
tation is Fast Blur (found in the Blur & Sharpen category). Use keyframes to 
adjust camera blur throughout a clip, as if the subject’s vision were moving 
in and out of focus. Another good one is Ghosting (also in the Blur & Sharpen 
category). Ghosting produces ghost images of moving objects. Similar to 
Ghosting is the Echo effect, found in the Time category, which is used in 
Figure 12-5. Echo gives you a bit more control over the number and timing of 
echoed images.

219

Flipping video
Do you ever wish you could produce a mirror image of a video clip, or maybe 
rotate and change its orientation on the screen? Such modifications are easy 
with Premiere Elements. Effects that you can use to flip video can be found in 
the Transform category of video effects. These effects include two classics:
 
✓ Horizontal Flip: This effect flips the video left to right, as shown in 
Figure 12-6.
 
✓ Vertical Flip: This effect flips the video top to bottom.
 
When flipping video, watch out for letters and numbers that appear in the 
frame. Backward or upside-down letters stick out like sore thumbs (or rude 
gestures) when your audience views the movie.

Creating a picture-in-picture effect
Your TV might have a picture-in-picture (PiP) feature that allows you to watch 
your favorite show in a small window while your significant other watches 
another show on the main screen. (See Figure 12-7.) Picture-in-picture effects 
can also be handy in your movies. For example, if you’re interviewing a star 
soccer player, you may want to show the interviewee in a small window while 
the action of a soccer game appears in the main screen. Premiere Elements 
has presets that make picture-in-picture effects easy to accomplish. 
 
Figure 12-7: 
The picture-
in-picture 
clip should 
be placed in 
a superim-
pose track.
 
Before you can create a picture-in-picture effect, you must set up the video 
clips properly in your Timeline. Place the main background image in the 
Video 1 track. Then place another clip in Video 2 or a higher video track, as 
shown in Figure 12-7 (remember, tracks Video 2 and higher are also called 
superimpose tracks). After you have placed the picture-in-picture clip in a 
superimpose track, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Effects list in the Task pane by choosing Window➪Effects.
 
2. Choose Presets in the menu in the upper-left corner of the Effects list, 
and then scroll down to the PiP categories. 
 
3. Scroll to a 25% or 40% PiP category, as appropriate.
 
 The 25% PiP presets create picture-in-picture clips that are 25% of their 
original height and width, and the 40% PiP presets create images that 
are 40% of their original height and width. 
 
 Presets are also divided into LL (lower-left), LR (lower-right), Motion 
(these move from one orientation to another), UL (upper-left), and UR 
(upper-right) categories.

221
 Chapter 12: Adding Special Effects to Your Movies
 
4. Find the preset that best matches the effect you want to create, and 
click-and-drag it to the clip in the superimpose track. 
 
 In Figure 12-8, I am using the preset PiP 25% LR Scale Out. The image’s 
height and width will be reduced to 25%, and the image will be posi-
tioned in the lower-right corner of the screen. At the end of the clip it 
will scale down to a point and disappear.
 
Picture-in-picture effects are cool, but always consider how your audience will 
view the movie. Will most of your audience view it on YouTube or an iPod? If 
so, the smaller viewing screen may turn picture-in-picture windows into tiny 
little postage stamps, especially 25% PiPs. Picture-in-picture works best when 
the audience will view the final movie on a large TV.

Adding Titles to Your Movies
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing the rules for effective titles
▶ Creating, adding, and tweaking titles
▶ Making rolling and scrolling titles
▶ Adjusting your titles’ appearance
I
n a rush to get to the pictures, folks who are new to video editing often 
overlook the importance of good audio (see Chapter 8). The same could 
also be said of titles — the subject of this chapter. Titles are the words that 
sometimes appear on-screen to tell your audience things such as the name 
of your movie, who made it, who starred in it, who paid for it, who made the 
titles, and who baked cookies for the cast. Titles can also clue the audience in 
to vital details — where the story takes place, in what time period, and even 
what time of day or year — with minimum fuss. And, of course, subtitles can 
reveal what the characters are saying if they’re speaking a different language.
Adobe Premiere Elements includes powerful tools to help you add titles to 
your movies. Few affordable video-editing programs offer the creative con-
trol and power over on-screen text that you get with Premiere Elements. In 
this chapter, I show you how to create attractive and functional titles with 
Premiere Elements, as well as show you how to integrate those titles into 
your projects.
Creating Basic Titles
Sure, you can think of titles as just words on the screen. But think of the 
effects, both forceful and subtle, that well-designed titles can have. Consider 
the Star Wars movies, which all begin with a black screen and the sentence, “A 
long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away . . .” This simple title screen quickly and 
effectively sets the tone and tells the audience that the story is beginning. 

224
Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
Before you start adding titles to your movies, you should know some impor-
tant Do’s and Don’ts about working with titles. The next section lists rules to 
follow when creating titles. Subsequent sections show you how to configure 
Premiere Elements for title editing, and I show you how to create titles and 
modify their appearance. 
Important title formatting rules
If you’ve ever worked in print or Web design, you’ve probably spent some 
time changing the size, color, style, and font of text. You may know the gen-
eral rules for text on the Web or in print: Use dark text on light backgrounds; 
use serif typefaces for large bodies of text; don’t use too many different type-
faces on a page.
Video has text rules too, although they differ considerably from print. One 
of the things you must take into consideration when creating text for video 
is the effects that interlacing can have on text. Interlacing (explained in 
greater detail in Chapter 3) is found on NTSC and PAL standard-definition TV 
screens, as well as on 1080i high-def displays. Interlacing causes thin lines 
to flicker or crawl on-screen. To prevent this headache (literally), make sure 
that you follow these important guidelines:
 
✓ Do make sure that all the lines in your text are thicker than 1 pixel. 
Lines that are only 1 pixel thick will flicker on interlaced TV displays.
 
✓ Don’t use serif typefaces in video, especially for smaller text. Serif 
typefaces — such as Times New Roman — have those extra little strokes 
at the ends of characters, while sans serif typefaces — like Arial — do 
not. Those little strokes in serif typefaces are often thin enough to cause 
interlacing flicker. The text you’re reading right now uses a serif face, 
while the text in the caption for Figure 13-1 uses a sans serif face. To 
be on the safe side, always carefully preview your titles on an external 
video monitor and check for flickering or other appearance problems.
 
✓ Do not assume that dark text is better. In print and on the Web, dark 
text over a light background usually looks best because it provides good 
contrast. Although adequate contrast is important in video, light text on 
a dark background usually works better. 
 
 
The best possible combination for video is white text on a dark 
background. 
 
✓ Do experiment with shadows and graphics. Simpler isn’t always better. 
If the background of the video clip is light or has mixed color, you can 
use shadows or graphics to create a dark background just for your titles.
 
✓ Do stay within the boundaries. Always keep your titles inside the Title 
Safe Margin. Not only does this prevent text from running off the screen 
on TVs that overscan the image, but it also means that your text isn’t 
running right up against the edge of the screen.

225
 Chapter 13: Adding Titles to Your Movies
Revealing the safe margins
One of the first things you should do before creating titles is make sure 
that the safe margins are visible. To do so, choose Window➪Show Docking 
Headers. In the docking header for the Monitor window, click the header 
menu (see Figure 13-1) and choose Safe Margins from the menu that appears. 
Two margins appear on the Monitor display, as shown in Figure 13-1. They are
 
✓ Title Safe Margin: The inner margin is the Title Safe Margin. All your 
titles should stay inside the Title Safe Margin. 
 
✓ Action Safe Margin: The larger outer margin is the Action Safe Margin. 
Important action in the scene should be inside the Action Safe Margin.
 
The Safe Title and Safe Action Margins are especially important if you’re pro-
ducing a movie that will be viewed on TV screens. Most TVs overscan images 
(they allow some of the video image to be cut off at the edges of the screen). 
Overscan is most prevalent on older analog TVs, but overscan is encountered 
on digital displays as well. Keeping your text inside the Safe Title Margin 
ensures that words won’t be cut off by overscan. It also improves readability, 
the same reason that margins are used when printing text on paper.

Inserting default titles
After you have edited together video clips and revealed the safe margins, you 
can start adding titles. To add a basic title, move the Timeline CTI (Current 
Time Indicator) to a location where you want to add a title, and then choose 
Title➪New Title➪Default Still. (You can also choose Default Roll or Default 
Crawl. I show you how to create rolling and crawling titles later in this chap-
ter.) Then start typing. 
When you’re done typing, click the Selection Tool (it looks like an arrow) 
and click-and-drag the finished title to a new location, as shown in Figure 13-2. 
Move the title to a place where it doesn’t cover important elements of the 
video image, but remember to keep the title inside the Safe Title Margin. 
Don’t get too picky at this point; you’ll probably move the text again later 
after you adjust the text attributes. Click Done if you’re happy with the title, 
or go to the next section if you’d like to improve the title’s appearance.

Click-and-drag title
 
If you want long lines of text to automatically wrap to a new line when space 
runs out, right-click the text and choose Word Wrap from the menu that 
appears.
Setting text properties
You can adjust the attributes of the text in your titles to make them more to 
your liking. For example, you can pick a font that’s consistent with the proj-
ect’s style (and is easy to read), pick a color that contrasts adequately with 
the background, adjust the size and scaling of the text, and more. 

227
 Chapter 13: Adding Titles to Your Movies
To adjust text properties, activate the title Selection tool (refer to Figure 13-2) 
and click the text object once to select it. Then adjust the text attributes by 
using the menus and controls shown in Figure 13-3. The options include
 
✓ Font menus: Choose a different font in the Font menu, and then 
specify whether you want to use boldface, italic, or other styles in the 
Formatting menu.
 
✓ Text size: Click-and-drag left or right on the number to change the text 
size. 
 
✓ Leading: Leading is the vertical space between lines of text. It’s called 
leading because printing press operators used to place strips of lead 
between text lines. Click-and-drag left or right on the leading number to 
increase or decrease the vertical space between multiple lines of text. 
 
✓ Kerning: Kerning controls the horizontal space between characters. 
Click-and-drag on the kerning number to increase or decrease spacing. 
 
✓ Alignment: Click one of the alignment buttons to align the text left, right, 
or centered.
 
If you spend a lot of time tweaking text appearance, click Save Style, enter a 
name for your new text style, and click OK. You can then easily apply the style 
to other titles, which helps you maintain a consistent appearance throughout 
your movie.

Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
Coloring and shadowing text
If you want to apply a different color and perhaps a drop-shadow to some 
text, Premiere Elements provides a great deal of control, although the tools 
aren’t easy to find. To change the color of text or apply a drop-shadow, right-
click the title text in the Monitor and choose Color Properties from the menu 
that appears. A Color Properties dialog box like the one shown in Figure 13-4 
appears. With this dialog box, you can control several important text 
attributes:
 
✓ Color: Use the Color Picker at the top of the Color Properties dialog box 
to select colors for text fill and stroke.
 
✓ Stroke: Stroke is an outline around text characters. A thin stroke often 
greatly enhances the appearance of text. Click the Stroke Color button 
(next to the Fill color) to pick a color for the stroke, and then adjust the 
Stroke Weight to change the thickness.
 
✓ Gradient: In addition to solid-color text, you can also make text that is 
a color gradient. Choose a gradient style from the Gradient menu and 
pick colors for the gradient in the controls that appear. Depending on 
the type of gradient you choose, you can usually adjust the angle of the 
gradient as well.
 
Figure 13-4: 
Fine-tune 
the appear-
ance of 
your text.
 
 
✓ Drop Shadow: Place a check mark next to this option if you want your 
text to have a drop-shadow. You can then modify the drop-shadow’s 
appearance as follows:

229
 Chapter 13: Adding Titles to Your Movies
 
• Angle: Adjust this setting from 0 to 359 degrees to precisely set the 
angle of the drop-shadow. 
 
• Distance: The distance should be greater than 0, but it shouldn’t 
be so great that the shadow makes the text appear blurry and dif-
ficult to read.
 
• Softness: Use this setting to soften the shadow’s appearance.
Click OK to close the Color Properties dialog box and apply your changes.
 
A shadow can help offset text from the video image somewhat, especially if 
the title appears over a light-color or busy background.
Using styles
If a title template seems too fancy and manually adjusting title attributes 
is too time consuming, try using one of the predesigned styles available in 
Premiere Elements. Various styles are available in the Text Styles area when 
you edit titles (refer to Figure 13-3). To apply a style to text that you have 
already typed, simply click the text object to select it, and then click a style 
in the Text Styles list. The style is automatically applied to the text.
Styles can be thought of as starting points. Even if one of the styles doesn’t 
exactly match what you need, choosing one that is close can still save you a 
lot of time. After you’ve applied the style, you can always fine-tune attributes 
such as color, size, and shadows. 
Making a rolling or crawling title
Titles are often animated in video productions. Text can fly onto the screen, 
crawl along the bottom like a stock ticker, or scroll from bottom to top as 
you roll the credits at the end of your movie. You can animate text using one 
of two methods:
 
✓ Animate the title clip in the Timeline by using the animation tools that 
come with Premiere Elements. (For more on animating titles and other 
clips in the Timeline, see Chapter 11.)
 
✓ Use the title animation tools built into Premiere Elements.
The second method is the less complex of the two, so it’s a good general 
choice. To create animated titles, follow these steps:

230
Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
 
1. In Premiere Elements, choose Title➪New Title➪Default Roll or Default 
Crawl.
 
 Rolling titles roll vertically (often from bottom to top), while crawling 
titles crawl horizontally (usually from right to left).
 
2. Type the text for your rolling or crawling title, and format the text as 
described in the preceding section.
 
 Don’t worry if your text runs off the screen in the Monitor. It’ll roll or 
crawl into view when the movie plays.
 
3. Select the title that will roll or crawl, and then choose Title➪
Roll/Crawl Options.
 
 The Roll/Crawl Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-5.
 
Figure 13-5: 
Use this 
dialog box 
to create 
titles that 
roll or crawl 
across the 
screen.
 
 
4. If you want the rolling or crawling title to begin off-screen, select the 
Start Off Screen option. If you want the title to end out of view, choose 
the End Off Screen option.
 
 In Figure 13-5, I’ve selected the Start Off Screen option, which means the 
titles will appear from the right and crawl left into view. I’ve left the End 
Off Screen option unchecked, however, which means that the titles will 
stop scrolling when the end of the text appears.
 
5. If you want the title to remain static for a while before it starts to roll 
or crawl, enter a time in frames in the Preroll field.
 
 If you enter 15 in the Preroll field, the title appears on-screen for 15 
frames before it starts to roll or crawl off the screen. This field is not 
available if you choose the Start Off Screen option.
 
6. If you want the title to roll or crawl on-screen and then stop, enter a 
time in the Postroll field.
 
 Like Preroll, Postroll is measured in frames. In Figure 13-5, I’ve entered a 
Postroll value of 30 frames, which means the titles will roll up the screen 
and then stop, staying in view for 30 frames, which is about one second. 

231
 Chapter 13: Adding Titles to Your Movies
 
7. If you want the title to gradually increase speed as it starts to move or 
gradually decrease as it stops, enter times in the Ease-In and Ease-Out 
fields.
 
 Like Preroll and Postroll, Ease-In and Ease-Out are expressed in frames. 
If you enter an Ease-In time of 15 frames, the title starts moving slowly 
and gradually builds up to full speed within 15 frames.
 
8. If you are creating a crawling title, choose whether you want the title 
to crawl Left to Right or Right to Left.
 
9. Click OK when you’re done.
 
 The Roll/Crawl Options dialog box closes.
You can scroll in the Monitor to see all the contents of your titles. To preview 
the actual roll or crawl, simply click Play in the Monitor. Premiere Elements 
dynamically adjusts the speed of the roll or crawl based on the length of 
the clip in the Timeline. The entire title rolls or crawls past, whether you 
have the title set to play for five seconds or five minutes in the Timeline. 
Obviously, the more time you give the title to play, the slower it rolls by. To 
quickly increase the amount of time that a title plays in the Timeline, choose 
the Time Stretch Tool in the Timeline and then click-and-drag an edge of 
the title to change its duration. (See Chapter 7 for more on using the Time 
Stretch Tool.)
Using Title Templates
One simple way to start creating titles is to use one of the built-in title tem-
plates. Premiere Elements comes with dozens of predesigned templates that 
can save you oodles of time when you’re creating complete titles. To use a 
title template, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Edit tab to bring it to the front, and then click Titles. 
 
 A list of title templates appears in the Edit pane. 
 
2. Choose a template category from the category menu, as shown in 
Figure 13-6. 
 
 You can further refine the display to templates from a specific design by 
using the subcategory menu, if you want.
 
3. Scroll through the list and find a template that you like.
 
 
The template icons are sort of small, so if you want to see a bigger pre-
view of a template simply double-click it. The template opens in a larger 
preview window.

232
Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
 
4. To use a template, click-and-drag it from the Edit pane to a video track 
on your Timeline.
 
 In Figure 13-6, I have dropped a title template from the “Topo” subcat-
egory onto my Video 2 track. See Chapter 7 for more on working with 
video tracks.
 
5. If you are asked if you want to apply Videomerge to the title, click Yes 
or No. 
 
 Some titles have solid or semitransparent backgrounds. If you enable 
Videomerge, the background is made partially transparent. This makes 
the title blend in better with the video, but it also makes some title 
design elements harder to see. 
 
6. Edit title text, as shown in Figure 13-6.

 Chapter 13: Adding Titles to Your Movies
Adding Graphics to Titles
In addition to inserting text into your movies, you can also draw some basic 
graphics and shapes in your titles. The drawing tools can serve a variety of 
useful purposes, including
 
✓ Drawing a line under text, thus making the text stand out a bit more on 
the screen. This is often done when identifying a speaker or subject on-
screen. 
 
 
Drawing a line with Premiere Elements title-drawing tools gives you 
more control over the size and appearance of the line than simply using 
the Underline text formatting option.
 
✓ Adding a solid-colored box behind the text to create adequate contrast 
between words and the background image.
When you’re editing titles, you can find the drawing tools along the right 
side of the Monitor window. Their functions are pretty self-explanatory; 
simply click a tool and then click-and-drag the shape on-screen. Use the Color 
Properties button to adjust colors and other attributes of the objects you 
draw. In Figure 13-7, for example, I’ve drawn a line underneath a row of text 
using the Line tool, and created an oval using the Rounded Rectangle tool to 
provide a contrasting background for the title. 
 
Figure 13-7: 
Subtle 
graphics 
can make 
your text 
much more 
readable.
 
You may want to adjust several other attributes of your graphics as well. 
When you select a graphic object using the Selection tool, the Title menu 
(located on the main Premiere Elements menu bar) provides access to a 
couple of important options:

234
Part III: Special Touches and Advanced Techniques 
 
✓ Arrange: If you want objects in a title to overlap with other objects 
(say, for example, you want text to appear over a background graphic), 
you need control over which objects are arranged on top of others. To 
move an item forward or back relative to other objects in the title, select 
that item and choose Title➪Arrange. Then select an option from the 
submenu that appears. In Figure 13-7, I created a black, rounded, rectan-
gular background graphic for the text and chose Send to Back from the 
Arrange menu to ensure that the graphic was behind the words.
 
✓ Opacity: By default, all graphics you create in a title are opaque, which 
means you can’t see through them. You can reduce the opacity of graphic 
objects, thereby making them more transparent. To adjust opacity, select 
a graphic object and choose Title➪Transform➪Opacity. Enter a percent-
age less than 100 to make the object less opaque. In Figure 13-7, I placed a 
black oval behind the text. An opaque black oval looked like a heavy black 
blob — but with its opacity reduced to 60 percent, the background oval 
gained some subtlety. Now it still helps the text stand out, but it doesn’t 
completely blot out the action going on in the video image.
Adjusting Titles in the Timeline
When you add a title to a movie project, the title is usually added to an over-
lay track, which is Video 2 or higher. This is because titles usually appear 
over other video. The default length for titles in Premiere Elements is five 
seconds, but in some cases you may want to change how long the title 
appears. You can also make titles fade in and out, or change other aspects. 
Some things you can do with titles in the Timeline include
 
✓ Change the duration of your title. Click-and-drag the edge of the title 
clip to increase or decrease its duration. See Chapter 7 for details on 
changing the duration of clips in the Timeline.
 
✓ Fade a title in or out. Double-click a clip in the Timeline, and then scroll 
down to “Fades” under Text Animation options in the Edit tab, as shown 
in Figure 13-8. Premiere Elements offers various fading options for titles; 
click a fade to preview it. When you find a fade option you want, click it 
once to select it and then click Apply.

Finishing and 
Sharing Your 
Movies

In this part . . .
T
he ultimate goal of video editing is to make movies 
that other people will enjoy. The chapters in Part IV 
of Premiere Elements 8 For Dummies show you how to pre-
pare and share your movies. I show you how to make sure 
your movie is ready for “prime time,” and then I show you 
how to share your movies on the Internet, YouTube, DVD, 
or Blu-Ray.

Chapter 14
Wrapping Up Your Movies
In This Chapter
▶ Casting a critical eye on your finished movies
▶ Exporting audio files and still images
▶ Saving high-quality AVI files
▶ Creating movies for iPods, PSPs, and videotape
A
s you work on more movie projects, you may find that you have a really 
hard time finishing a movie project. Some clip always lasts a few frames 
too long, or an effect keyframe isn’t in exactly the right spot, or a title font 
doesn’t look exactly right. There’s always something — no matter how minis-
cule — that could be improved upon. Moviemaking is like that. But at some 
point, you have to give up tweaking your masterpiece and decide that it is 
“good enough.”
Before you can actually stick a fork in your movie and call it done, you have 
a few tasks to perform to finalize the movie and get it ready for output. You 
should sit back and preview the whole thing, of course. You need to make 
sure that the project is rendered and ready for output. This chapter helps 
you put the finishing touches on your project and shows you how to export 
audio or still images from Premiere Elements. I also show you how to export 
movies for certain video devices like iPods, PSPs (PlayStation Portables), and 
tape-based camcorders.
Previewing Your Movie
I could start and end this section by simply telling you to click Play in the 
Monitor window to preview the current project. As an “oh-by-the-way,” I 
could also mention that the effects and edits should be rendered before you 
export them. Rendering is the process of building preview files that incorpo-
rate your edits.

240
Part IV: Finishing and Sharing Your Movies 
Thanks to the powerful real-time capabilities of Adobe Premiere Elements, 
rendering usually isn’t necessary for simply previewing your edits. But ren-
dering should be done before you export your movie to tape, DVD, or the 
Internet.
Any portion of a movie that needs to be rendered — but isn’t yet — shows a 
red line under the Work Area bar, as shown in Figure 14-1. A green line means 
that you have already rendered a section that needed it. To render the unren-
dered portions of the Timeline, choose Timeline➪Render Work Area (or just 
press the Enter key on your keyboard).
 
Figure 14-1: 
The Work 
Area bar 
shows por-
tions of your 
project that 
should be

Red bars indicate areas that need to be rendered
Work Area bar
Of course, there’s more to previewing your project than simply rendering the 
Timeline and clicking Play. Consider carefully what you are actually preview-
ing when you play a movie. Here are some ways to get the most out of pre-
viewing your project:
 
✓ Watch the whole program from start to finish. You may be tempted to 
periodically stop playback, make a few tweaks, and then click Play again. 
This is fine, but to get a really good sense of the flow of the project, 
watch the whole thing from start to finish — just as your audience will. 
Keep a notepad handy and jot down notes if you must.
 
✓ Watch the program on an external television monitor. If you plan to 
export your movie to tape or DVD, previewing on an external monitor 
helps you ensure the best color and image reproduction. 
 
 
Whatever export format you use for your movie — whether it’s a high-
quality Blu-Ray disc or a highly compressed file for the Internet — make 
sure you preview the exported movie before you share it with others. 
Export settings can be tricky, and you may find that the audio output or 
other aspects of the final file are unacceptable. And of course, always 
preview the file on the target hardware. Video files for iPods, for exam-
ple, often don’t play correctly on PCs even though they look great when 
played on an iPod. 

241
 Chapter 14: Wrapping Up Your Movies
 
✓ Have trusted third parties review the project. Moviemakers and writers 
are often too close to their creations to be totally objective; an outside 
point of view is helpful. I worked hard to write this book (for example), 
but my work was reviewed by various editors who provided invaluable 
feedback. Movie projects benefit from similar reviews. 
Exporting Audio Only
Many people think of Adobe Premiere Elements as a video-editing pro-
gram, but you can also edit and export a plain old audio file with Premiere 
Elements, too. Formats you can export to include AAC, MP3, QuickTime, 
Windows Media Audio (WMA), Windows waveform (WAV), and others. 
 
Exporting audio files from Premiere Elements is one way to create custom 
ringtones for your mobile phone. Check the documentation for your phone 
to find out if custom ringtones are supported, and if so, what format is used. 
Then use Premiere Elements to export an audio file in the necessary format. 
Making final additions to your video
Movies and videos often have some elements 
that you may take for granted (or never con-
sider at all). Broadcast engineers use special 
video elements to help adjust video equipment. 
These include counting leaders and color bars 
and tone. A third element seems like nothing at 
all: black video. Do you need these elements? 
Not necessarily. Unless you’re producing video 
for a local public-access cable TV channel or 
other broadcast outlet, you probably don’t need 
bars and tone or a counting leader. But they 
can sometimes come in handy, and when used 
creatively they can lend a cool Hollywood feel 
to your movies. Black video is more commonly 
useful, because it can come in handy for short 
visual breaks in your project. 
To create black video, bars and tone, or a count-
ing leader, click the Organize tab in the Task 
pane, and then click Project. Click the New Item 
button in the upper-right corner of the Project 
screen to reveal a menu of choices. Select an 
item in the menu, such as Black Video. A five-
second black video clip appears in the list of 
clips, and you can then click-and-drag the clip 
to the Timeline to use it. 
The best way to figure out how to use the other 
things in the New Item menu is to just play with 
them. Create color bars or a counting leader, 
and add them to your projects as desired. The 
Universal Counting Leader is mainly useful for 
lending a retro film look to your movie, but the 
Bars and Tone element can be used to calibrate 
audio speakers and TV monitors.

242
Part IV: Finishing and Sharing Your Movies 
If you want to export audio in QuickTime or WMA format, see the sections 
in Chapter 15 on exporting movies in those formats. When you export the 
movie, you can choose to export only audio if you want. If you just want to 
quickly export audio in AAC, MP3, or WAV format, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Share tab on the Task pane, and then click Personal 
Computer.
 
 The Export Audio dialog box appears.
 
2. Scroll down the list of formats and click Audio. 
 
3. Choose a format in the Presets menu. 
 
 The Presets menu contains options for four basic formats:
 
• AAC: This format is supported on iPods and a few other media 
players. The High Quality preset delivers better audio quality, 
while the Medium Preset reduces quality but cuts the file size in 
half. AAC offers a good balance of compression and quality, but it 
isn’t as widely supported as MP3. 
 
• AIFF: This is a lossless audio format used to store CD-quality audio 
on Macintosh computers and many professional audio-editing 
applications. Unless you know that you need AIFF files, consider 
exporting Windows Waveform audio instead. AIFF files are large 
and not supported by most portable media players. 
 
• MP3: This ubiquitous format is supported by all modern comput-
ers and digital media players. There are three quality presets so 
you can choose between better quality or smaller file size.
 
• Windows Waveform: This lossless format stores CD-quality audio 
on Windows computers. WAV files are compatible with most 
Windows applications, but the files are big and not supported by 
most portable media players. 
 
4. Enter a name in the File Name field.
 
5. Click Browse and choose a location in which to save the file.
 
6. Place a check mark next to Share Work Area Bar Only if you want to 
share only part of the Timeline.
 
 You can export the entire Timeline or just the range covered by the 
Work Area bar. See Chapter 7 for more on using the Work Area bar.
 
7. Click Advanced to open the Export Settings dialog box.
 
 Options in the Export Settings dialog box vary, depending on the format 
you chose in Step 3. Figure 14-2 shows options for MP3 files.
 
8. Choose Stereo or Mono next to Channels.
 
 Stereo improves audio quality but inflates file sizes.

9. Choose an Audio Bitrate.
 
 Higher bitrates mean better audio quality and (surprise!) bigger file 
sizes. For MP3 and AAC files, even the most casual listener will notice 
the reduced audio quality found in bitrates below 128 Kbps. 
 
10. Click OK to close the Export Settings dialog box.
 
11. Back in the Task pane, click Save to export the audio file.
Capturing Still Images from Your Movie
Premiere Elements lets you export still images from your movies, which 
comes in handy for a variety of reasons. For example, you may want to dis-
play stills from the movie on a Web page, or use stills as background images 
in DVD menus. Just keep in mind that stills extracted from video are usually 
of lower quality than stills shot with a conventional still-photo camera. Even 
frames extracted from high-def video have less than two megapixels of reso-
lution. To export a still image from Premiere Elements, follow these steps:

244
Part IV: Finishing and Sharing Your Movies 
 
1. Move the CTI in the Timeline to the exact frame that you want to 
export.
 
 
You can use the J, K, and L keys on your keyboard to control playback. 
Press K to pause playback, and then use the left- and right-arrow keys to 
step forward or back a single frame at a time. 
 
2. In the Task pane, click the Share tab and then click Personal 
Computer.
 
3. In the list of sharing options that appears, click Image. 
 
4. Choose an export format from the Presets menu.
 
 The available export formats for still frames are GIF, JPEG, Targa, and 
TIFF. TIFF provides the highest quality, but JPEG and GIF are more 
Web-friendly. If you have an image-editing program like Photoshop 
or Photoshop Elements, I recommend that you export in TIFF format. 
Otherwise, export to JPEG if you plan to use the image directly on the 
Web. Targa is an older image format still in some video-editing applica-
tions, but it has inferior color bit depth compared to TIFF or JPEG.
 
5. Enter a filename in the File Name field, and click Browse next to Save 
In to choose a location in which to save the file.
 
6. Click Save.
 
7. Choose a location and name the file, and then click Save.
 
 The still image is saved. The still image also shows up in your media 
lists on the Organize tab of the Task pane.
You may need to edit still images exported from video, especially if the image 
comes from interlaced video. Fast-moving objects in the image may show 
combing. This is a term that describes the horrid horizontal distortions that 
occur in an image that has been interlaced. Also, if the video comes from a 
rectangular-pixel video image, it may appear stretched or squeezed on com-
puter screens. Adobe Photoshop Elements and other photo-editing programs 
usually have de-interlacing filters to help you remove combing.
 
If you want poster-quality promotional shots of your movie, bring a high-
quality still camera along with you during a video shoot and use it to take pic-
tures of the scenes or subjects in the movie.
Saving AVI Files
Besides making movie editing easy, Premiere Elements also makes it easy to 
record your movies to DVD, YouTube, or various other viewing modes. You 
can also export your movies directly to an AVI format file.

245
 Chapter 14: Wrapping Up Your Movies
 
AVI is short for Audio-Video Interleave and is also sometimes called Video for 
Windows. It has been a common Windows multimedia format for many years. 
When you capture standard-def video from a tape-based camcorder, the cap-
tured video footage is stored on your hard drive in AVI format. High-def video 
and video captured from flash, disc, or hard-drive–based camcorders is cap-
tured in the camera’s native MPEG format.
AVI files are usually too big to share online. (See Chapter 15 for Web-friendly 
sharing formats.) But AVIs are useful as full-quality archive copies, and they 
can be used by other video programs. To export your movie in AVI format, 
follow these steps: 
 
1. Click the Share tab, and then click AVI.
 
2. Choose a preset in the Presets menu.
 
 The Presets menu contains four DV presets offering choices of NTSC or 
PAL, and standard (4:3) or widescreen (16:9) aspect ratios (see Chapter 
3 for more on aspect ratios). In addition to DV, there are presets called 
Microsoft AVI and Uncompressed AVI. Which one you choose depends 
on a couple of factors:
 
• DV presets: Choose NTSC or PAL depending on your local broad-
cast standard, and choose standard or widescreen depending on 
the aspect ratio of your movie. All the DV presets output video in 
standard definition, and widescreen presets letterbox the video 
image to fit in a 4:3 video image. The DV presets are best if you ulti-
mately plan to view the movie on a TV. 
 
• Microsoft AVI: This is a good preset to use for general archiving 
purposes. The output is similar to the DV presets, but you can cus-
tomize the pixel aspect ratio and other settings.
 
• Uncompressed Microsoft AVI: This preset is also intended for 
archiving. By default, it uses square pixels and progressive scan-
ning. Use this preset if you feel that you have unlimited storage 
space; otherwise, the Microsoft AVI preset is adequate.
 
 
If small file size is a priority, I recommend that you use the QuickTime, 
Flash, or Windows Media formats described in Chapter 15.
 
3. Enter a filename, and click Browse to choose a location in which to 
save the file. 
 
4. Click Advanced.
 
 The Export Settings dialog box appears. Depending on which preset you 
use, you may be able to change the frame size, frame rate, color depth, 
and other settings to yield a smaller file size. 
 
 Keyframe Options (under Advanced Settings) are available only if you 
are exporting in Microsoft AVI format. Rendering keyframes control how 
Premiere Elements compresses video. The default setting of 15 frames is 

246
Part IV: Finishing and Sharing Your Movies 
usually adequate, but if your video images don’t contain a lot of move-
ment, you may want to increase it to 30 frames. If your video contains 
many fast-moving images, setting keyframes every 10 frames offers 
better video quality — and larger file sizes. 
 
5. Click OK to close the Export Settings dialog box.
 
6. Click Save. 
 
 The movie is rendered and exported. Depending on the size of the 
movie, rendering and output may take awhile.
Exporting to Digital Devices
Decades ago, visions of the future predicted hover cars, vacations in space, 
and wristwatch TVs. Well here we are in the 21st century and we’re still wait-
ing for our hover cars, and outer space tourism is reserved for those who 
can afford to pay more than $20 million for a rare flight on a Russian Soyuz 
rocket. Although I don’t see a lot of wristwatch televisions, modern media 
players and mobile phones are making handheld portable video a reality. 
Whether you’re bored at work or stranded at the spaceport, if you have a 
portable phone or device that can play video, Premiere Elements can prob-
ably export video for your device. Supported formats include
 
✓ Apple iPods and iPhones: Video-capable devices from Apple use a 
unique video format based on the H.264 codec (a video compression 
scheme). Options include a 640 x 480 high-quality format (best for larger 
devices like the iPhone or iPod Touch) or a 320 x 240 medium-quality 
format (best for smaller iPod devices). Premiere Elements can also 
output audio-only Podcast files. 
 
✓ Creative Zen: This format option exports a good-quality 320 x 240 
Windows Media file. Even if you don’t have a Zen, this format is a good 
choice for many different brands of digital media players that can handle 
Windows Media Video. 
 
✓ Microsoft Zune: Microsoft’s Zune players play Windows Media Audio 
and Video. This format option in Premiere Elements is similar to the 
Creative Zen option, except for slightly better audio quality and superior 
compression for smaller file sizes. 
 
✓ Pocket PC: The term “Pocket PC” is rather ambiguous, because this 
option simply outputs a small (240 x 176) video image in a highly com-
pressed format. It can be played on Pocket PCs, yes, but these videos 
can also be played on many WMV-capable media players. For that 
matter, most Pocket PCs running a modern version of the Windows 
Mobile operating system can play videos output for the Creative 
Zen, too. 

247
 Chapter 14: Wrapping Up Your Movies
 
✓ Smartphone: Smartphones are like Pocket PCs that also happen to be 
phones. The Smartphone output option in Premiere Elements produces 
a tiny 224 x 128 video image in Windows Media format. 
 
✓ Sony PSP: PlayStation Portable (PSP) devices from Sony use a special 
H.264-based video format that is similar to (but not exactly like) the 
formats used by Apple iPods and iPhones. PSP video files have a good-
quality 320 x 240 image size, and the files even have the same .MP4 file-
name extension as iPod files. But iPod and PSP files are not compatible, 
so make sure you output the correct format for your target audience. 
 
✓ Mobile Phone: Smartphones aren’t the only mobile phones that can 
play video. Many non-smartphones (dumb phones?) can play video. 
Mobile phone video uses the .3GP filename extension and provides a 
teensy little 176 x 144 video image. Be sure to send your audience magni-
fying glasses so they can actually see the movie. 
The next couple of sections show you how to export movies for iPods, 
iPhones, and personal media players such as the Creative Zen. I don’t need 
to show you how to export videos for each format, because the process is 
almost the same for each format. The process for making iPod and iPhone 
movies is similar to the process for Sony PSP and mobile phone videos, while 
the steps for personal media player files work equally well for Creative Zens, 
Microsoft Zunes, Pocket PCs, and smartphones.
Making iPod and iPhone movies
If you want to have the coolest portable media player, you need to get an 
iPod or iPhone. The only problem is that everyone else has an iPod, too. So 
how do you outcool the cool people? When everyone else is just listening to 
iMusic, you can be watching your own personal iVideos!
 
Apple iPods and iPhones use a special H.264 video codec that provides excel-
lent playback quality and small file sizes. The file extension is MP4. In theory, 
videos that you export from Premiere Elements using the iPod output format 
should play on any device that can play MP4 videos; however, I have found 
that iPod videos often will only play properly on an iPod or iPhone.
The steps for exporting smartphone and PSP videos are very similar to the 
process for producing iPod videos. iPhones and iPods use exactly the same 
format, of course. To export an iPod video, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Share tab, and then click Mobile Phones and Players. 
 
2. Choose Apple iPod and iPhone in the list of devices that appears.
 
 If you’re outputting a movie for PSPs or mobile phones, choose one of 
those options instead. 

248
Part IV: Finishing and Sharing Your Movies 
 
3. Choose an iPod/iPhone preset in the Presets menu. 
 
 The high-quality preset creates a movie with a 640 x 480 image size. This 
preset is best for devices with larger screens, such as the iPhone and 
iPod Touch. The medium-quality preset gives an image size of 320 x 240, 
which is better for smaller-screened iPod devices. 
 
 
The high-quality preset produces file sizes that are about 30 percent to 
40 percent larger than medium-quality movies. In the example shown in 
Figure 14-3, my 18-minute movie will be about 146MB at high quality or 
111MB at medium quality. Both presets offer CD-quality audio. 
 
4. Give your movie a name in the File Name field. 
 
 In Figure 14-3, I have named my movie “McDowellCreekFalls.” 
 
Figure 14-3: 
Choose an 
iPod preset 
and name 
your movie.
 
 
5. Click Browse and choose a location in which to save the movie. 
 
 Strictly speaking, choosing a location for your movie is optional. But I 
recommend that you manually choose a location so that you’ll easily be 
able to find the movie later. 
 
6. If you want to fine-tune output settings, click Advanced. 
 
 The Export Settings dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-4. It’s 
usually best to just accept the default settings with the high- or medium-
quality presets. However, if you’re trying to reduce file sizes, there are a 
couple of settings you can adjust:
 
• Frame Rate: On the Video tab, reduce the frame rate to 15 frames 
per second (fps). This will drastically reduce the playback quality, 
but if you need a smaller file size and the video doesn’t contain a 
lot of fast action, you may find that a reduced frame rate is a rea-
sonable sacrifice. 

249
 Chapter 14: Wrapping Up Your Movies

• Video Bitrate Settings: Scroll down on the Video tab to reveal 
bitrate settings. Choose VBR, 2 Pass in the Bitrate Encoding menu 
to make the compression more efficient (this will also cause the 
export to take a longer amount of time). Slide the Target and 
Maximum Bitrate sliders left to reduce the overall video bitrate 
(and thus image quality). 
 
• Basic Audio Settings: If your movie’s audio quality is less critical, 
click the Audio tab. Change the Output Channels menu to Mono, 
reduce the Frequency to 32 kHz, and choose Low or Medium in the 
Audio Quality menu. 
 
• Audio Bitrate Settings: Scroll down the Audio tab and click-and-
drag the Bitrate slider left to reduce the audio bitrate. 
 
 
Don’t change anything on the Multiplexer tab. If you change settings on 
that tab, the video format will be incorrect and your movie won’t play 
properly on iPods. Click OK to close the Export Settings dialog box. 

250
Part IV: Finishing and Sharing Your Movies 
 
7. Review the output settings and estimated file size shown on the Share 
tab, and then click Save to begin exporting your movie. 
 
 Premiere Elements renders and exports the movie. This may take awhile 
depending on the length of your movie and the complexity of your edits. 
 
8. When the movie is done exporting, open iTunes, choose File➪
Add File to Library, and then browse to your exported MP4 file. 
 
 Use iTunes to copy the movie to your iPod or iPhone. Visit Chapter 15 if 
you want to share your iPod-format movies on the Internet. 
Creating videos for personal media players
A lot of portable media players and devices can play video. Every device is 
different, and I can’t cover every brand and variation here. But many smart-
phones and media players support video playback using some variation of 
the Windows Media Video (WMV) codec. The Creative Zen, Microsoft Zune, 
Pocket PC, and Smartphone output options in Premiere Elements all output 
Windows Media in a variety of quality and size settings. To output video in 
one of these formats, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Share tab, and then click Mobile Phones and Players. 
 
2. Choose a format that most closely matches the target device.
 
 In the example here, I am exporting a movie for Pocket PCs. 
 
3. Choose an output preset in the Presets menu.
 
 Some formats — such as the Zen and Zune players — let you choose 
your local broadcast standard (NTSC or PAL; see Chapter 3 for more on 
broadcast standards). The Smartphone format lets you choose between 
portrait or landscape picture orientations. Videos are usually landscape, 
but many smartphones have portrait-shaped video screens. 
 
4. Give your movie a name in the File Name field. 
 
5. Click Browse and choose a location in which to save the movie. 
 
 You can just accept the default location, but I recommend that you man-
ually choose a location so you can easily find the movie later. 
 
6. If you want to fine-tune output settings, click Advanced. 
 
 The Export Settings dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-5. Here 
you can adjust settings to balance between movie quality and file size:
 
• Video Bitrate Settings: To improve compression efficiency, on the 
Video tab, choose two encoding passes and then select Variable 
Constrained in the Bitrate Mode menu, as shown in Figure 14-5. 

251
 Chapter 14: Wrapping Up Your Movies
 
Figure 14-5:

right bal-
ance of file 
size and

• Frame Rate: On the Video tab, reduce the frame rate to 10 fps to 
reduce file size, or increase it to 25 or 30 to improve quality. 
 
• Audio Bitrate Settings: To improve compression efficiency, 
choose two encoding passes, and then select Variable Constrained 
in the Bitrate Mode menu. 
 
• Basic Audio Settings: Choose a lower-quality option in the Audio 
Format menu, and slide the Peak Audio Bitrate slider left to reduce 
quality and file size. 
 
7. Click OK to close the Export Settings dialog box. 
 
8. Review the output settings and estimated file size shown on the Share 
tab, and then click Save to begin exporting your movie. 
 
 Premiere Elements renders and exports the movie. This may take awhile 
depending on the length of your movie and the complexity of your edits. 

252
Part IV: Finishing and Sharing Your Movies 
 
9. When the movie is exported, use Windows Media Player or another 
program to sync the movie to your Pocket PC or media player. 
Recording Movies to Tape
Before you think that videotapes are old fashioned, consider that most pro-
quality camcorders — including high-definition cams — still use tapes. Digital 
videotapes are cheap, reliable, and can be archived for many years. If you 
have a tape-based digital camcorder, you can output finished movies from 
Premiere Elements directly to tape. After the movie has been recorded to a 
tape in your camcorder, you can then archive the tape, use the camcorder 
to transfer the movie to a VHS tape, or connect the camcorder to a TV for 
playback. The following sections show you how to export finished movies to 
a tape-based camcorder. 
 
If you want to export a movie directly to an analog VHS tape (remember 
those?), your options are somewhat limited. One option is to connect a VHS 
VCR to your computer with an analog video converter (see Chapter 19 for 
more on video converters). Follow the steps described in this chapter to 
export a movie to tape, and manually set the VCR to record the output from 
your computer. 
Getting ready for tape output
Before you export your movie to tape, you should make sure that your movie 
is actually ready. Naturally, you should review the project and all of your 
edits. Because any movie you export to tape will be viewed primarily on 
broadcast-style TVs, you should also check the following:
 
✓ Is the movie compatible with the appropriate broadcast standard? See 
Chapter 3 for more on video standards. Review settings in the General 
Project Settings (Project➪Project Settings➪General). 
 
✓ Has the movie been rendered? Effects, transitions, and other edits 
should be rendered before you record to tape. If you see any red lines 
at the top of the Timeline, click the Timeline to make it active and press 
Enter. Premiere Elements renders all your edits. 
 
✓ Is your computer optimized for export to tape? Your computer must 
be able to play the movie flawlessly in real time. To make sure that your 
computer is ready, do the following:

253
 Chapter 14: Wrapping Up Your Movies
 
• Turn off extra programs. Make sure all unnecessary programs 
are closed, including your e-mail program, MP3 jukebox, and Web 
browser. Every open program uses up memory and processor 
resources that should be devoted to video export.
 
• Disable programs that run in the background. Disable memory-
resident programs such as antivirus programs and any programs 
that have icons in the Windows system tray (the area in the lower-
right corner of the screen, next to the clock). You should be able 
to close or disable most of these items by right-clicking them and 
choosing Close, Disable, or Exit from their respective menus. (Just 
don’t forget to turn that antivirus program back on when you’re 
done exporting!)
 
• Disable screen savers and power-management settings to ensure 
that they don’t kick on in the middle of a long export operation. 
If you’re working on a laptop, make sure that it’s plugged in to wall 
power so that it doesn’t hibernate or run out of battery power in 
the middle of export.
 
• Defragment your hard drive. A recently defragmented drive 
ensures efficient operation during video capture and export.
 
✓ Is your hardware connected? Connect the camcorder to the computer’s 
FireWire or USB 2.0 port, and turn the camera on to player mode. 
 
✓ Do you have a new, blank tape? It’s best to use a brand-new, blank tape 
for export. This prevents timecode breaks and other problems that may 
cause your movie to play poorly or not at all. 
 
✓ Have you previewed your project on a TV monitor yet? Previewing 
your movie on a real TV monitor can help you identify problems such as 
weird colors or titles that get cut off at the edge of the screen.
Exporting your movie to tape
After you have prepared your movie, computer, and camcorder for export to 
tape, you’re ready to begin the actual export process. If you are exporting to 
a device that has device control (such as a digital camcorder; see Chapter 2 
for more on device control), follow these steps:
 
1. Connect your recording device (your camcorder or DV deck) to your 
computer and turn it on.
 
 Make sure that the camcorder is turned on to VTR (Player) mode, and 
not to Camera mode.

254
Part IV: Finishing and Sharing Your Movies 
 
2. Click the Share tab, and then click Tape.
 
 The Export to Tape dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-6.
 
3. Make sure that a check mark is placed next to the Activate Recording 
Device option.
 
 The only time you would disable this option is if you’re exporting video 
through a video converter connected to your computer’s FireWire port. 
(I describe video converters in Chapter 19.)
 
Figure 14-6: 
Make sure 
that the 
Activate 
Recording 
Device 
option is 
selected.
 
 
4. If the tape already has a timecode on it, select the Assemble at 
Timecode option and specify a timecode where you want recording to 
begin.
 
 Start the recording at about the ten-second mark on your tape.
 
5. Enter the number of frames, if any, that you want to delay before the 
movie starts playing.
 
 Some devices need a delay between receiving the record command and 
the actual movie.
 
6. Enter the number of frames that you want to preroll the tape in the 
Preroll field.
 
 Preroll allows the reels in the tape deck to spin up to the correct speed 
before recording begins. I recommend at least five seconds (150 frames 
for NTSC video, 125 frames for PAL video) of preroll.
 
7. Place a check mark next to Abort After.

255
 Chapter 14: Wrapping Up Your Movies
 
 Of course, you can tell Premiere Elements to stop export after only 2 or 
3 or 50 frames have been dropped, but even one dropped frame is an 
unacceptable quality problem. If you have trouble with dropped frames 
during capture, review the earlier sections of this chapter and Chapter 4 
to make sure your computer is ready and that it meets the specs for run-
ning Premiere Elements.
 
8. Click Record.
 
 Your movie is recorded on the tape. The camcorder will automatically 
stop when the recording process is complete.

M
aking movies with Adobe Premiere Elements is so much fun that it’s 
easy to forget the most important part: Sharing your movies with 
others. Entertaining and informing others is one of the main reasons for 
manipulating raw video clips into interesting and creative movies.
You can share your completed movies with the world in many different ways. 
This chapter shows you how to share your movie projects in the online world 
of the Internet. I help you identify some of the special problems involved with 
putting movies online, help you choose a player program for your movies, 
and show you how to export your movies in a variety of Web-friendly formats 
directly from Adobe Premiere Elements. I also show you how to upload your 
movies to YouTube.
Archiving Movies on Photoshop.com
I’ll never forget the first time I left a vinyl record sitting next to a window in 
direct sunlight. I came back a few hours later and the record was warped 
beyond repair. Ruined! If only I had a backup!
Today most media is stored on computer hard drives rather than on vinyl 
LPs. Computers don’t warp if you leave them out in the sun, but the digital 
age has made us no less vulnerable to data loss. An unexpected hard drive 
failure can mean that all your stored music, photos, and movies are gone for-
ever. But if you have a Photoshop.com membership, you can use this service 
from Adobe to back up photos and videos online. Follow these steps:

 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Movies Online
Uploading Your Movies to YouTube
Today, digital video and the Internet go together like Kirk and Spock. But 
back in the early days of digital video and the online world, the relationship 
was more like Spock and Dr. McCoy, which is to say challenging and com-
plex. If you wanted to share movies online, you had to pay for dedicated Web 
server space, and you needed knowledge of how to build and maintain Web 
sites. Then in 2005 along came YouTube, and online video was revolution-
ized. YouTube introduced several important innovations:
 
✓ Free Web server space: There’s no charge to upload videos to YouTube, 
and watching videos is free too.
 
✓ Simple upload interface: You don’t need to be a trained Internet engi-
neer to use YouTube. The upload page uses simple options to help you 
upload any video file from your computer. 
 
✓ Flash video conversion: You can upload videos to YouTube in almost 
any common video format. YouTube automatically converts your videos 
to the Adobe Flash format. The Flash Player browser plug-in from Adobe 
is free, and it’s installed on nearly all modern computers.
Because you have Adobe Premiere Elements, there’s even more good news: 
Premiere Elements can upload your videos directly to YouTube. The only 
limitations — besides good taste and the YouTube terms of use — are that 
videos you upload can be no longer than ten minutes and no larger than 
100MB. 
 
YouTube is a tremendous information resource, but certain kinds of informa-
tion can be controversial or even illegal in some countries. A few countries 
have blocked access to YouTube at various times, and certain kinds of videos 
may be blocked in some countries. Likewise, some corporate networks block 
YouTube videos. Keep in mind that in rare cases your intended audience 
won’t be able to watch your YouTube videos.
Creating a YouTube account
Uploading videos to YouTube is free, but you must have a YouTube user 
account. You can create an account in Premiere Elements during the upload 
process, or you can visit the YouTube Web site directly and create an 
account at any time:

260
Part IV: Finishing and Sharing Your Movies 
 
1. Visit www.youtube.com, and click the Sign Up link in the upper-right 
corner of the Web page.
 
 An account creation page appears.
 
2. Enter a valid e-mail address, and provide a password.
 
 Create a password that is at least eight characters long and includes 
numbers, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters. The e-mail address 
you enter must be valid because YouTube will send you a confirmation 
e-mail as part of the account creation process.
 
3. Provide a unique user name.
 
 Click the Check Availability link to see if your user name is available.
 
4. Enter other requested information, and review the Terms of Use and 
Privacy Policy files.
 
 YouTube asks for your general location, date of birth, and gender. Make 
sure that you review the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy links carefully.
 
5. Click Create Account.
 
6. Open your e-mail account and click the Confirm your email address 
link in the YouTube confirmation e-mail.
 
 If you don’t receive a confirmation e-mail, check the anti-spam settings 
for your e-mail program or account to make sure that the confirmation 
e-mail isn’t erroneously sent to spam prison.
Uploading the movie
You can upload virtually any video file on your computer to YouTube by vis-
iting www.youtube.com, logging in to your account, and finding the Upload 
link on the YouTube Web page. But why go to all that hassle when you can 
easily upload YouTube videos right from within Premiere Elements? When 
you’re done editing your movie in Premiere Elements, make sure your com-
puter is connected to the Internet. Then follow these steps: 
 
1. Click the Share tab, and then click Online in the list of sharing options 
that appears.
 
2. Click YouTube in the list of online sharing choices.
 
 
Review the file size and duration of your movie on the Share tab. 
Premiere Elements limits YouTube file sizes to less than 100MB and 
durations to ten minutes or less. If your movie is longer than ten min-
utes, you either need to break it up into segments and upload each one 
separately, or do more editing to shorten the movie’s duration. If you 
really need to share a longer movie, you may need to share the movie 
using another method, which I describe later in this chapter.

3. Choose an option in the Presets menu.
 
 If your movie has a 4:3 aspect ratio (see Chapter 3 for more on aspect 
ratios), choose Flash Video for YouTube. If your movie has a 16:9 aspect 
ratio, choose Flash Video for YouTube (Widescreen).
 
4. Click Next, and enter your YouTube account name and password.
 
 Place a check mark next to Remember Me to make logging in easier.
 
5. Click Next again, and enter a title and other descriptive information 
about your movie, as shown in Figure 15-2.
 
 This is the information that YouTube users will see when they watch 
your movie. It also helps the YouTube search engine find your movie.

6. Decide whether you want to share your movie with the public.
 
 If you choose Yes, anyone can find and view your video on YouTube. If 
you choose No, you can still share your video with select friends, but 
those friends must log in to a YouTube user account, and you have to 
manually allow them to view your video in your YouTube account con-

 Premiere Elements renders your movie in the Flash format and then 
uploads it to YouTube. The rendering and upload process may take 
awhile, depending on the complexity and length of your movie.

262
Part IV: Finishing and Sharing Your Movies 
When the movie finishes uploading, a screen appears with a link to your 
video at the YouTube Web site. You can e-mail that link to other people to 
share your video. If you go to YouTube and find that your movie isn’t yet 
ready for playback, don’t worry. The video needs to be processed by the 
YouTube server before it can play, which usually takes a few minutes.
Creating Web-Friendly Video Files
YouTube provides an easy way to share your movies online, and you can’t 
beat the price (it’s free). But YouTube isn’t your only option, and Premiere 
Elements can output movies in the most popular Web-friendly video for-
mats. These formats include Adobe Flash, Apple QuickTime, and Microsoft 
Windows Media Video.
Sharing video online presents technical challenges that you need to know 
about. The good folks who built the foundations of the online world many 
decades ago envisioned it as a staging ground for efficient global information 
exchange, but sharing full-motion video over the Internet wasn’t part of the 
original plan. Video, and especially streaming video, is at odds with the fun-
damental design of the Internet for two key reasons:
 
✓ Bandwidth: High-speed broadband Internet connections have become 
far more commonplace in recent years, but the term “high speed” is 
relative. Large video files can still take awhile to download, and some of 
your audience members may not have the patience to sit around wait-
ing for downloads to finish. Large movie files can also quickly eat up the 
monthly bandwidth allotment for your Web server space, especially if 
your movies become popular with other Internet users.
 
✓ Packet delivery: Data is transmitted over the Internet in packets rather 
than in steady streams. This makes data transfer over the Internet reli-
able, but not fast.
 
Data is broken into packets for transmission over the Internet. These pack-
ets travel many different pathways to the destination, where they are reas-
sembled in the correct order to form a Web page, e-mail message, or any other 
file that is shared online. Contrast packet delivery to, say, a radio or televi-
sion broadcast, which transmits data in a continuous wave. Packet delivery 
is reliable because it doesn’t require an unbroken connection between the 
sender and receiver. Confused? Imagine you want to give your phone number 
to someone across a crowded room. You could try yelling across the room 
(a broadcast), but the receiver might miss a number or two because of the 
crowd noise. A more reliable method would be to write your number on a 
piece of paper and send it across the room via messenger. The paper method 
is slower, but at least you know the recipient will get the correct phone 
number.

263
 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Movies Online
So what’s the point of all this technical discussion about bandwidth and 
packets? Video for the Web must be highly compressed, the frame size must 
be reduced, and you must accept some sacrifices in quality. Video can be dis-
tributed over the Internet in one of two ways:
 
✓ Download: Users download the entire movie file before it is played. 
Most current video player programs can start to play the movie before 
it is all downloaded. The program calculates when enough of the movie 
has been received so that playback can begin and continue without 
interruption. This is called progressive playback or progressive download, 
and it does a fair job of mimicking streaming video.
 
✓ Stream: The movie plays as it downloads to the user’s machine. Some of 
the video is buffered (portions of the data are temporarily stored in com-
puter memory) to provide uninterrupted playback. The predominant 
formats for streaming video are Apple QuickTime Streaming, RealMedia, 
and Windows Media Streaming Video. In each case, special server soft-
ware is required to host streaming media.
Regardless of which distribution method you choose, the export process 
for the movie from Adobe Premiere Elements is still the same. You export 
the movie as a file that resides on your hard drive. Whether that file is later 
streamed is determined by whether you use streaming server software on 
your Web server. See Chapter 19 for more on choosing a Web server.
Choosing player software
Distributing your movie digitally actually means 
distributing it as a file — so you have to make 
sure that your intended audience can open that 
file. With Premiere Elements, you have three 
basic choices: Flash, QuickTime, or Windows 
Media. 
First, remove Adobe Flash from consideration. 
Although Flash is used by YouTube and other 
video-sharing Web sites, it isn’t conducive 
to hosting videos on your own Web site. That 
leaves you with the Apple QuickTime and 
Microsoft Windows Media formats. Yes, that’s 
right: Apple versus Microsoft. Which one is 
best?
Having worked extensively with both the 
QuickTime and Windows Media Video formats, I 
can tell you that neither format has a clear tech-
nical advantage. Both offer small file sizes and 
good quality. The most important consideration 
boils down to what software your audience has. 
QuickTime is preinstalled on all Macintosh PCs, 
and Apple offers a free QuickTime player for 
Windows. Likewise, Windows Media Player is 
installed on all Windows PCs. Microsoft doesn’t 
directly offer Windows Media Player for Macs, 
but a free QuickTime plug-in called Flip4Mac 
(available on both Apple and Microsoft Web 
sites) lets Mac users watch Windows Media 
Video.
QuickTime or Windows Media? Go with your 
gut. Use the format that you like best. If your 
audience complains about the format you put 
on your Web site, that will also be a good indi-
cation of what they prefer. 

264
Part IV: Finishing and Sharing Your Movies 
 
You may want to produce a lower-quality movie for people who are impatient 
or have slow dialup connections, and make a higher-quality movie for folks 
with fast broadband access. You may also want to offer versions for several 
different players. For example, you can offer both Apple QuickTime and 
Windows Media versions. Face it: Some people are very touchy about using 
software from certain companies.
Saving an Apple QuickTime movie
Apple QuickTime is popular for sharing movies online because it provides 
a good balance of file size and quality. Before you can export to QuickTime 
format, you must have QuickTime Player 6 or later installed on your 
computer. To download QuickTime, visit www.apple.com and click the 
Downloads link. Once QuickTime is installed, exporting a QuickTime movie is 
simple. When you’re done editing your movie, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Share tab, and then choose the Personal Computer option.
 
2. Scroll down the menu at the top of PC sharing options and choose 
QuickTime, as shown in Figure 15-3.
 
3. Choose a preset from the Presets menu.
 
Figure 15-3: 
Choose a 
QuickTime 
preset here.
 

265
 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Movies Online
 
 When you choose a preset, a description of the preset appears at the 
bottom of the Share tab. The presets offer different combinations of 
frame size, frame rate, and audio frequency to suit a variety of band-
width needs. The highest quality preset is the LAN preset, which has a 
frame size of 640 x 480, a frame rate of 29.97 fps (NTSC) or 25 fps (PAL), 
and an audio frequency of 44 kHz, which is roughly CD-quality. The 128K 
Dual ISDN preset shrinks the picture size to 320 x 240, cuts the frame 
rate to 15 fps, and reduces audio quality to 16 kHz. If neither of the pre-
sets matches your needs, click the Advanced button to customize export 
settings. I describe advanced QuickTime settings in the next section.
 
4. Enter a filename for your movie in the File Name field.
 
5. Click Browse and choose a location in which to save the movie.
 
6. Click Save.
 
 When you click Save, Premiere Elements begins to render and save the 
movie. A Rendering progress bar appears to let you know the progress 
of the export. The progress bar also estimates the remaining time; 
saving the file might take awhile, especially if this is a long project. 
Choosing advanced QuickTime settings
When you export a QuickTime movie, you may want to customize your 
export settings rather than use a preset. To customize the settings, click 
Advanced on the Share tab when you export a QuickTime movie (see the pre-
ceding section for the basic steps of saving a QuickTime movie). The Export 
Settings dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 15-4. Click the tabs in the 
Export Settings dialog box to access advanced Video and Audio settings.
When you’re done adjusting settings in the Export Settings dialog box, click 
OK and continue saving your movie as described in the preceding section. 
The next few sections describe advanced QuickTime export settings in detail. 
Adjusting QuickTime video settings
QuickTime videos are videos, so it makes sense that advanced video settings 
are the first thing you see when you open the Export Settings dialog box. The 
QuickTime video settings are pretty easy to sort through. Review these set-
tings on the Video tab of the Export Settings dialog box:
 
✓ Codec: This is the compression/decompression scheme used to com-
press the movie to a smaller file size (see Chapter 3 for more on codecs). 
There are many choices in the Codec menu, but for online use, the H.264 
codec is usually best. If people have a hard time playing your QuickTime 
movies — jerky playback is one common problem — try using one of the 
Sorenson codecs instead. 

266
Part IV: Finishing and Sharing Your Movies 
 
✓ Quality: This setting controls how the video image is compressed. It 
should come as no surprise that higher quality results in larger file sizes. 
 
✓ Frame Width/Height: These boxes control the size of the video image. 
Try to maintain the aspect ratio of 4:3 to prevent distorting the video 
image (16:9 widescreen videos will be letterboxed in QuickTime Player). 
Chapter 3 explains aspect ratios. Larger video sizes mean larger files. (Is 
there an echo in here? Is there an echo in here?)
 
✓ Frame Rate: Broadcast-quality video usually has a frame rate of 25 or 
29.97 frames per second (fps). You can save file size and bandwidth by 
using a frame rate of 12 or 15 fps. To ensure smooth playback, choose a 
frame rate that is one-half or one-third of the original frame rate.
 
✓ Field Order: For online movies, you usually choose None (Progressive). 
However, if you find that the movie you output has combing or other 
interlacing problems, choose Upper or Lower. Some experimentation 
may be necessary. I explain interlacing in Chapter 3.
 
✓ Pixel Aspect Ratio: Square Pixels is the most common choice here, 
but if your video image appears stretched or squeezed you may need 
to choose one of the rectangular pixel options. Choose the option that 
matches the format of your original source footage.
 
✓ Set Bitrate: Place a check mark next to Set Bitrate and adjust the Bitrate 
slider to change the video bitrate. A higher bitrate means higher video 
quality, and of course, larger file sizes.
 
✓ Set Key Frame Distance: Compression key frames help video compress 
more efficiently. A longer interval between key frames often reduces file 
size and quality. Enable the Set Key Frame Distance check box to change 
the interval between compression key frames.
 
✓ Frame Reordering: This option makes compression a lot more efficient, 
but it may also cause playback problems for some people, especially 
those who have older versions of QuickTime. 
 
Despite the name similarity, compression key frames are entirely different 
from effect keyframes. A compression key frame is a picture of the entire 
video image. When video is compressed, a key frame might only occur once 
every one, five, or even ten seconds. All the frames between those key 
frames — the in-between frames are called delta frames — contain information 
only about things in the video image that have changed.
Adjusting QuickTime audio settings
Apple QuickTime’s audio settings are simple. You can choose an audio codec 
from the Codec menu (the AAC codec works well), select mono or stereo 
output, and specify a frequency. A frequency of 44 kHz provides CD-quality 
audio, but keep in mind that high-quality audio can inflate file size in a big 
hurry. 

267
 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Movies Online
 
Figure 15-4: 
Customize 
the size and 
quality of 
the video 
image.
 
 
If your exported files are too big, start here to whittle down the file size. A 
simple reduction of the audio frequency, as well as switching from Stereo to 
Mono, can make a big difference in the file size.
Exporting Windows Media
Another Web-friendly export option in Adobe Premiere Elements is Windows 
Media. This export option produces Windows Media Video (WMV), an effi-
cient export format for online media. WMV-format video supports progres-
sive download (also called hinted download), which means it starts to play as 
soon as a sufficient amount of data has been received to ensure continuous 
playback from start to finish. Windows Media Player is free and preinstalled 
on all Windows PCs, and a free program called Flip4Mac is available on the 
Apple and Microsoft Web sites to allow Macintosh users to view unprotected 
WMV files as well.

268
Part IV: Finishing and Sharing Your Movies 
Exporting Windows Media video is a lot like exporting QuickTime movies. To 
export Windows Media video, follow these steps:
 
1. When you’re done editing your movie, click the Share tab.
 
2. Choose the Personal Computer sharing option.
 
 Even though your ultimate plan might be to share it online, don’t choose 
the Online option. The Online option gives you access only to Flash 
video formats. 
 
3. Scroll down the menu at the top of PC sharing options and choose 
Windows Media, as shown in Figure 15-5.
 
4. Choose a preset from the Presets menu. 
 
 When you choose a preset, a description of the preset appears at the 
bottom of the Share tab. The presets offer different combinations of 
frame size, frame rate, and audio frequency to suit a variety of band-
width needs. The highest quality presets are the HD 1080i and 720p 
presets (available only if you’re working with a high-def movie). These 
presets offer essentially broadcast quality playback, but the files sizes 
are usually way too big for online use. The highest quality Web-friendly 
preset is Local Area Network (LAN), which includes a frame size of 
640 x 480, a frame rate of 30 fps (NTSC) or 25 fps (PAL), and an audio 
frequency of 44 kHz, which is roughly CD-quality. Contrast this with 
the lowest-quality preset, which is the DialUp 56K Modem preset. This 
preset has a frame size of 176 x 144, a frame rate of 10 fps, and 16 kHz 
audio. Obviously, the LAN preset gives much better playback quality, 
but it also yields a much bigger file size. In Figure 15-5, I have chosen the 
Cable Modem/DSL preset, which falls somewhere between the LAN and 
DialUp presets in terms of quality and file size. 
 
 If none of the presets exactly match your needs, click the Advanced 
button to customize your export settings. I describe advanced Windows 
Media settings in the next section.
 
 As with QuickTime, presets that offer a higher frame rate, a larger frame 
size, or greater audio quality tend to produce larger movie files. To cus-
tomize your Windows Media export settings, click Advanced. I describe 
advanced settings in the following section.
 
5. Enter a filename for your movie in the File Name field.
 
 If you plan to export your movie in several different sizes to accommo-
date a variety of online viewers, make sure that the filename reflects the 
preset used for this version. For example, if one version of a movie shot 
at a jazz festival uses the Cable Modem/DSL preset, you might name the 
file JazzFestDSL. A second version which uses the 56K Modem preset 
might be called JazzFest56K.

269
 Chapter 15: Sharing Your Movies Online
 
6. Click Browse and choose a location in which to save the movie.
 
7. Click Save.
 
 When you click Save, Premiere Elements begins to render and save the 
movie. A Rendering progress bar appears to let you know the progress 
of the export. The progress bar also estimates the remaining time; 
saving the file might take awhile, especially if this is a long project. 
 
Figure 15-5: 
Choose a 
Windows 
Media 
preset.
 
Customizing Windows Media settings
The Windows Media export presets should cover most of your needs, but if 
you’re the kind of person who likes to tinker, click Advanced on the Windows 
Media sharing screen. This gets you under the hood, which looks like Figure 
15-6. The Export Settings dialog box has tabs for Video settings, Audio 
Settings, and Audiences. Try not to scrape your knuckles on these settings:
 
✓ Video Codec: Several Windows Media codecs are available on the 
Video tab. You can choose older versions of the Windows Media codec 
(such as 7 or 8) to make your movie compatible with older versions of 
Windows Media Player. If a user tries to view a Windows Media Video 9 
movie with Windows Media Player 7 or 8, the movie may play improp-
erly or not at all. Windows Media Player 9 has been available since 2003, 
so there’s usually no reason to use an older codec.

270
Part IV: Finishing and Sharing Your Movies 
 
✓ Allow Interlaced Processing: The Video settings also allow you to 
specify interlaced processing. Choose this if your exported videos have 
interlacing-related combing (see Chapter 3 for more on interlacing) or 
other interlacing-related problems. 
 
✓ Bitrate Settings: Next to Encoding Passes, choose Two Encoding Passes. 
This choice increases the time it takes the movie to export, but it also 
helps the movie compress more efficiently. Choose One Encoding Pass 
only if you’re in a hurry to export the movie. For the Bitrate Mode, the 
Variable Unconstrained option is your best bet for efficient compression 
and higher quality. 
 
✓ Frame Width/Height: These boxes control the size of your video image. 
Try to maintain the aspect ratio of 4:3 (16:9 widescreen videos will be 
letterboxed in Windows Media Player) to prevent distortion of the video 
image. See Chapter 3 for more on aspect ratios. Remember, larger video 
sizes mean larger files.
 
✓ Frame Rate: Broadcast-quality video usually has a frame rate of 25 or 30 
frames per second (fps). You can save file size and bandwidth by using 
a frame rate of 12 or 15 fps. To ensure smooth playback, choose a frame 
rate that is one-half or one-third of the original frame rate.
 
✓ Pixel Aspect Ratio: Square Pixels is the most common choice here; how-
ever, if your video image appears stretched or squeezed, you may need 
to choose one of the rectangular pixel options in this menu. Choose the 
option that matches the format of your original source footage.
 
✓ Keyframe Interval: Compression key frames help video compress more 
efficiently. A longer interval between key frames often reduces file size 
and quality. Adjust the Keyframe Interval to change the interval between 
compression key frames.
 
✓ Average Video Bitrate: Adjust this slider to change the average video 
bitrate. Surprise: Higher bitrates yield better quality and larger file sizes. 
 
✓ Audio settings: As with video, you can choose a specific audio codec 
and bitrate settings on the Audio tab. 
 
✓ Audiences: On the Audiences tab, you can choose whether the exported 
movie will be compressed or uncompressed. 
 
 You should always choose Compressed unless file size is absolutely not 
a concern. When is it not a concern?
When you’re done reviewing and adjusting Windows Media export settings, 
click OK to close the Export Settings dialog box. Continue saving and export-
ing your Windows Media movie as described earlier in this chapter.

Burning Your Movies to Disc
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding DVD standards and technologies
▶ Getting your movies ready for DVD and Blu-Ray
▶ Recording your movies onto DVD and Blu-Ray discs
I
n 1997, a new medium for distributing video came onto the market. That 
new medium was the Digital Versatile Disc, more commonly known as 
DVD. DVDs packed full-length, high-quality movies in digital format onto com-
pact laser discs that were the same size as audio CDs and CD-ROMs. In 2003, 
DVDs surpassed VHS videotapes as the most common movie distribution 
method, and today DVDs are the world standard for video recording. 
Standard DVDs support only standard-definition video. That brings us 
to the next step in video storage evolution: the high-definition DVD. You 
might remember the Great High Def Format War, which began in 2006 when 
the competing HD DVD and Blu-Ray formats were released to the public. 
Fortunately the only guns and explosions in this war were the ones in action 
movies recorded to HD DVD and Blu-Ray. HD DVD format was the casualty, 
and Blu-Ray the victor. Blu-Ray discs can store and play high-def movies. If 
you have a high-def camcorder, Blu-Ray discs allow you to easily share high-
def movies with others. Blu-Ray players are increasingly affordable, and Blu-
Ray disc burners are starting to appear in some PCs. 
If your computer has a DVD or Blu-Ray burner, Adobe Premiere Elements is 
ready to put that burner to use. This chapter shows you how, with just a few 
mouse clicks, you can burn your Premiere Elements movie projects onto DVD 
or Blu-Ray, complete with navigation and scene menus. But first I introduce 
you to the fundamentals of DVD and Blu-Ray technologies. 

274
Part IV: Finishing and Sharing Your Movies 
Decrypting Video Disc Standards
One of the nice things about VHS tapes was that when you recorded a movie 
onto a tape, you could be sure that it would play in any VCR. It was also easy 
to understand the storage capacity of a tape. A tape labeled T-120, for exam-
ple, held 120 minutes of NTSC video. 
Alas, video discs are a little more complicated. Although most DVD play-
ers can play the discs you record yourself, some players are flaky and have 
trouble with homemade discs. And the storage capacity on a blank disc is 
usually listed computer-style (gigabytes) rather than human-style (minutes). 
If a blank DVD says it can hold 4.7GB, how many minutes of video is that, 
exactly? The next few sections answer common questions about video discs.
 
DVD and Blu-Ray discs are often called optical discs. No, they can’t take the 
place of your reading glasses. They’re called optical discs because data is read 
optically, using a laser beam. VHS tapes, MiniDV tapes, and computer hard 
drives store and read data magnetically rather than optically.
How much video can you cram on a DVD?
A standard recordable DVD has a theoretical capacity of 4.7GB (actually 
4.38GB in practice), which works out to a little over two hours of high-quality 
MPEG-2 video (MPEG-2 is the codec used by DVD video). Two hours is an 
approximation; as I show later in this chapter, quality settings affect how 
much video will fit on a disc. If you’re willing to sacrifice some quality, you 
can squeeze a lot more video onto a disc.
Some DVDs are double-sided or have multiple data layers, allowing them to 
hold more than 4.7GB. Table 16-1 lists the most common DVD capacities.

 Chapter 16: Burning Your Movies to Disc
You’ve probably seen double-sided DVDs before. They’re often used to put 
the widescreen version of a movie on one side of the disc, and the full-screen 
“pan-and-scan” version on the other. Double-sided discs require special man-
ufacturing processes, so (for now) you can’t easily make double-sided DVDs 
in your home or office.
Double-layer discs also used to require a special manufacturing process. 
Early double-layer discs were actually glued together (I’m not making this up) 
with a special transparent glue applied in “clean rooms” by technicians clad 
in white lab coats. Double-layer DVD burners and discs became available in 
2004, and most new computers now come with double-layer DVD burners — 
sometimes called DVD-R DL burners. So if you buy some recordable DVD-R 
DL discs, you can record discs that will hold 8.5GB. Wearing a white lab coat 
is optional. A double-layer disc can hold about 4 hours of video at the highest 
DVD quality, or about 16 hours of video if you ramp the quality back to about 
what you get on a VHS tape. 
 
The capacities listed in Table 16-1 assume standard-size DVDs, which are 
about 12cm in diameter. Some companies offer miniature recordable DVDs, 
and of course, these smaller discs also have a smaller capacity. For example, 
Verbatim’s 8cm miniature DVD-R discs hold about 1.4GB of material.
How much video can you cram 
onto a Blu-Ray disc?
Blu-Ray discs (BDs) have a lot in common with DVDs. Both types of discs are 
round, flat, and 120mm in diameter. They’re both optical storage discs, and 
they can both have multiple layers. Most Blu-Ray players can also play stan-
dard DVDs (and audio CDs, too). Alas, BDs do not work in standard-def DVD 
players. 
Blu-Ray discs and DVDs may look alike, but BDs are a generation ahead tech-
nologically. A single-layer BD-R can hold 25GB of data, which is almost three 
times as much as a double-layer DVD. A double-layer BD can hold 50GB of 
data. A variation of BDs is the 80mm BD-R Camcorder disc, which is used in 
special Blu-Ray disc camcorders. In Chapter 2, I generally recommend against 
disc-based camcorders. Table 16-2 lists the capacities for Blu-Ray discs.

Reading the DVD/BD alphabet soup
When it comes to buying a drive to record your own discs, you’re going 
to see a lot of similar — yet slightly different — acronyms thrown around 
to describe the various formats that are available. The basic terms you’ll 
encounter are
 
✓ DVD-R (DVD-Recordable): Like a CD-R, you can record onto this type of 
disc only once. DVD-Rs hold 4.7GB of data. 
 
✓ DVD-R DL (DVD-R Dual Layer): These are also one-time-use discs, but 
dual-layer discs can hold 8.5GB of data.
 
✓ DVD-RW (DVD-ReWritable): You can record onto a DVD-RW disc, erase 
it later, and record something else onto it.
 
✓ DVD-RAM (DVD-Random Access Memory): These discs can also be 
erased and reused repeatedly. DVD-RAM discs are compatible only with 
DVD-RAM drives, which makes this format pretty useless for movies.
 
✓ BD-R (BD-Recordable): These 25GB discs can be recorded only once, 
and can be played only in Blu-Ray drives and players. 
 
✓ BD-R DL (BD-R Dual Layer): Like BD-Rs, these can be recorded only 
once, but two recording layers yield a capacity of 50GB. 
 
✓ BD-RE (BD-R Erasable): These BD discs can be erased and reused. 
As you shop for DVD burners, notice that some drives say they record DVD-R, 
whereas others record DVD+R. The dash (-) and the plus (+) aren’t simply 
a grammatical curiosity. The -R and +R formats are unique standards. If you 
have a DVD-R drive, make sure that you buy DVD-R blank discs. Likewise, 
if you have a DVD+R drive, you must buy DVD+R blank discs. Fortunately, 
most manufacturers now offer dual-format DVD burners that can handle both 
DVD-R and DVD+R discs. These drives are sometimes marked as DVD+/-R 
drives.

 Chapter 16: Burning Your Movies to Disc
Getting Your Movie Ready for Disc
A great feature of DVDs and BDs is consistent high-quality playback, whether 
the movie has been played once or a hundred times. Optical discs store data 
digitally, so they don’t suffer from generational loss. (See Chapter 3 for a 
detailed explanation of generational loss.)
Viewers expect very high quality from DVD and Blu-Ray movies. They’re 
more likely to buy high-quality TVs so that they can watch their movies on 
crisp, bright displays. Viewers also expect DVDs and BDs to be easy to use, 
with features like scene markers and navigation menus. This means you’re 
going to have to make an extra effort to prepare your movies for disc:
 
✓ Make image quality superb. Spend time improving the colors and light-
ing in your video images. Chapter 10 shows you how to fix lighting prob-
lems, improve colors, stabilize shaky video, and more.
 
✓ Use effective scene markers. If you create scene markers in the Timeline 
when important new scenes begin, the movie will be easy to navigate in 
a DVD or Blu-Ray player. Viewers can click the Next Scene or Previous 
Scene button on their remotes to quickly jump between scenes. I show 
you how to add scene markers in Chapter 7.
 
Premiere Elements stores and edits your video at full quality. Both standard 
and high-def projects can be recorded to DVD. If you plan to record Blu-Ray 
discs, start with high-def footage from an HD camera. 
What are VCDs and SVCDs?
A few years ago, DVD burners and blank 
DVD-Rs were still sort of expensive, and not 
everyone had made the switch from VCRs to 
DVD players. An alternative was to record a 
VCD (Video CD) or SVCD (Super VCD) on 700MB 
CD-Rs. A VCD could hold about 60 minutes of 
lower-quality video, and an SVCD could hold 
about 20 minutes of DVD-quality video. 
Premiere Elements can’t record VCDs or SVCDs 
directly. Third-party programs like Nero Burning 
ROM can create such discs, but why bother? 
Your computer almost certainly has a DVD 
burner, and almost everyone in your audience 
now has a DVD player too. Furthermore, these 
days DVD-Rs are often cheaper than CD-Rs, so 
VCDs don’t save you any money. You may still 
hear some people mention VCDs or SVCDs, but 
these formats are now just a historical footnote 
and really aren’t worth your time.

Recording DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs
Until a few years ago, recording your own DVDs was complex and time con-
suming. Adobe wanted to eliminate most of that complexity from Premiere 
Elements, so the company created a special Disc Menu workspace to help you 
prep your movies for disc. To open this workspace, click the Disc Menus tab in 
the Task pane or choose Window➪Disc Menus. The process for creating DVDs 
and Blu-Ray discs is the same; it just depends on what kind of burner you 
have in your computer. The following sections show you how to choose a 
menu template, customize your menus, and record your disc. 
Choosing a menu template
If you’ve ever watched a movie on DVD — I’m probably not going out on a 
limb here — you’re probably familiar with disc menus. Menus are graphical 
screens that appear on your TV. Using the remote control for your DVD or 
Blu-Ray player, you select a link in the main menu to play the movie, or you 
can go to submenus for scene selection or special features. 
Creating menus from scratch can be time consuming, but not with Adobe 
Premiere Elements. Premiere Elements comes with a nice selection of menu 
templates to help you quickly and easily create attractive, easy-to-use menus. 
When you first open the Disc Menus workspace (Window➪Disc Menus) you 
see a list of menu templates. The templates are divided into 16 categories 
with themes like Travel, Seasons, Happy Birthday, and Sports, which is 
shown in Figure 16-1.
 
You don’t have to choose a template. Premiere Elements can also create an 
“auto-play” disc with no menus. An auto-play disc automatically starts playing 
your movie as soon as it is placed in the player. To create an auto-play disc, 
skip the Disc Menus tab and go right to the Share tab. Later in this chapter, I 
show how to burn discs using the Share tab.
To select a disc menu template, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Disc Menus tab to bring it to the front. 
 
2. Choose a category from the Theme menu.
 
 In Figure 16-1, I’m selecting a template from the “Sports” category.

 Chapter 16: Burning Your Movies to Disc

3. Scroll down the list of templates and click a template to select it.
 
 In Figure 16-1, I have chosen a template named “Soccer Action.” 
Previews of both the main menu and scene menu are displayed.
 
4. When you have chosen a menu, click Apply to apply the template to 
your project.
 
 Alternatively, you can click-and-drag the template to the Monitor 
window. DVD menus are automatically generated for your project, and 
the menus appear in the Disc Menus box under the Monitor, as shown 
Figure 16-2.
 
After you customize your menus, you may decide that you don’t like the 
template that you originally chose. Not a problem! Simply return to the Disc 
Menus tab and choose a new template. 

280

Customizing menus
When you create disc menus using a Premiere Elements template, the tem-
plate inserts default text and links that you may want to edit. The default text 
is usually generic and may not be relevant to your project. For example, in 
Figure 16-2, the main menu has the title Movie Title Here. If that name 
is too ironic and edgy for you, you may want to change it. The following 
sections show you how to customize your disc menus.
Changing menu text
To change text in a menu, double-click it. A Change Text dialog box appears, 
as shown in Figure 16-3. Enter your new text and click OK. The new text 
appears in the menu, as shown in Figure 16-4.
 
Figure 16-3: 
Enter new 
text for disc 
menus here.
 

281
 Chapter 16: Burning Your Movies to Disc
 
Unfortunately, Premiere Elements doesn’t allow you to change the size or 
alignment of text, so be careful not to enter too much text in the Change Text 
dialog box. If you enter too much text, the words will flow off the screen or 
possibly obscure other elements on the menu.
 
Figure 16-4: 
Personalize 
your menus 
with cus-
tomized text.
 
Modifying scene selection menus
You should also take a look at your scene menus, which is where viewers 
can select specific scenes in the movie. The number of scene menus for your 
project depends on
 
✓ How many scene markers are in your Timeline: Premiere Elements 
considers each scene marker the beginning of a new scene. 
 
✓ How many scenes per page are supported by the template: Different 
template designs allow different numbers of scenes on each page. The 
template in Figure 16-4 allows three scenes per page, so a second page 
accommodates the five scenes in my project.
Customizing your scene menus is an important part of the menu-creation 
process because link names may overlap, or a scene’s thumbnail image may 
not be exactly what you want. To view your scene selection menus, click a 
scene’s menu at the bottom of the Monitor window.
Moving and resizing links
If you don’t like the arrangement of the links in your scene menus, you can 
easily move or resize them. Click a scene link once to select it, and then click-
and-drag it to a new location. Click-and-drag a handle at the corners or sides 
of a link to resize it, as shown in Figure 16-5. 
 
As you move and resize links, be careful to avoid links that overlap each other. 
Overlapping links can make the scene menu essentially unusable. Overlapping 
links are outlined in red. Move or resize links until all the red lines are gone.

links must

overlapping links.
Click and drag handles
to resize a link.
Click a scene menu to change it.
Changing link thumbnails
You normally create scene markers (Chapter 7 describes them) at the begin-
ning of scenes. By default, the thumbnail image on a scene link is the first 
video frame of that scene, but sometimes the first frame doesn’t properly 
illustrate the scene’s contents. 
To change the thumbnail (also called the poster frame) for a scene marker, 
double-click the scene link in the Monitor. In the Menu Marker dialog box, 
click-and-drag left or right on the timecode under the Thumbnail Offset 
window. Keep dragging until you find a frame that would make a good 
thumbnail. In Figure 16-6, I have chosen a frame that is three seconds 
(00;00;03;00) ahead of the scene’s first frame. Click OK to close the Menu 
Marker window when you have selected a good thumbnail.
Removing links
You may decide that some of your scene menu links are superfluous, espe-
cially if you created the markers a long time ago. Don’t worry; removing 

283
 Chapter 16: Burning Your Movies to Disc
scene links from your menus is easy. Just double-click the offending link in 
the Monitor window, and click Delete in the Menu Marker dialog box that 
appears. The scene is removed from your scene menus.

Adding a stop marker
Have you thought about what will happen when your movie ends? When 
your movie is over, ideally the DVD’s main menu appears. To make sure this 
happens automatically, insert a stop marker at the end of your movie if you 
haven’t done so already. Adding a stop marker is easy. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click somewhere in the Timeline window to make it active.
 
2. Press the End key on your keyboard.
 
 This moves the CTI to the very end of your project. 
 
3. Choose Disc➪Set Menu Marker. 
 
 The Menu Marker dialog box appears.
 
4. Choose Stop Marker in the Marker Type menu.
 
5. Click OK to close the Menu Marker dialog box.

284
Part IV: Finishing and Sharing Your Movies 
Previewing your disc
When you have all your menus set up the way you want them, take a few 
moments to preview your disc. To generate a preview of your project, 
click Preview in the Monitor window. A Preview Disc window appears. This 
window is a fully functional mock-up of the final disc, complete with the same 
controls found on a typical DVD remote. When you preview your disc, the fol-
lowing things are important to check:
 
✓ Do the menus look as attractive as you’d hoped? If not, consider choos-
ing a new template.
 
✓ Click every scene link in the scene’s menu. Does each scene seem to 
start at the correct place? If some of the scene links don’t link to the 
right places, you may need to move markers in your Timeline. 
 
✓ Click Play Movie in the main menu, and then click the Next Scene button 
to jump to the next scene. Continue clicking Next Scene to review each 
scene marker. Are the scenes spaced at appropriate intervals? You may 
need to add or remove scene markers in the Timeline. 
 
✓ Play the final scene in the movie until it ends. Does the movie return to 
the main menu when it ends? If not, make sure that you’ve placed a stop 
marker at the end of the movie, as described in the preceding section.
When you’re done previewing your disc, click the Close (X) button in the 
upper-right corner of the Preview Disc window. If you make any more 
changes, make sure that you preview the revised project.
Burning your disc
When you have previewed your disc and you’re certain that it’s ready to go, 
you’re ready to — drum roll, please — burn the disc. Don’t worry; you don’t 
need matches and a burning permit! The term burn is often used in place of 
“record” when you record stuff onto DVDs and Blu-Ray discs. 
 
Before you start burning your disc, keep in mind that the encoding and burn-
ing process can take many hours. For this reason, I usually burn discs near the 
end of a workday. You can click Burn and let the disc burn overnight, when 
you don’t need to use the computer for anything else. Encoding — which 
Premiere Elements does automatically before the actual disc is burned — 

285
 Chapter 16: Burning Your Movies to Disc
requires a lot of computer memory and processing resources, so make sure 
that you close noncritical programs before you start to burn.
To burn a disc in Premiere Elements, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Timeline➪Render Work Area. 
 
 It’s a good idea to make sure that transitions, effects, titles, and other 
edits in the Timeline are rendered before you burn a disc.
 
2. When rendering is complete, click the Share tab and then click Disc.
 
3. Click DVD or Blu-Ray, depending on the type of disc you’re burning.
 
 You can only burn DVDs if your computer has a DVD-R drive. You’ll need 
a BD-R drive to burn Blu-Ray discs.
 
4. In the Burn To menu, choose whether you want to burn to a disc or to 
a folder.
 
 Usually you burn a disc, but you can also create a disc image in a folder 
on your hard drive. That image can be recorded to a disc by using other 
software such as Roxio Easy CD Creator or Nero Burning ROM. 
 
5. Enter a name for the disc in the Disc Name field.
 
 In Figure 16-7, I have named my disc SpringSoccer.
 
6. If you have more than one burner on your computer, make sure that 
the correct burner is selected in the Burner Location menu.
 
 If you have an external DVD burner connected to your computer’s USB or 
FireWire port, but the burner doesn’t show up in the Burner Location menu, 
make sure that the external burner is properly connected and the power is 
turned on. Wait several seconds, and then click the Rescan button.
 
7. Choose how many copies you want to burn. 
 
 You may want to burn a single test disc first, and then burn multiple 
copies later when you know that the first disc burned just fine.
 
8. Insert a blank recordable disc in your burner drive.
 
 If you see a yellow asterisk icon and the words Media Not Present 
next to the Status indicator, make sure that you have inserted your 
blank disc and click Rescan. After several seconds, you should see 
Ready next to the Status indicator, as shown in Figure 16-7.

9. Choose a Preset. 
 
 If you’re burning a standard-def DVD, you have to make two choices:
 
• NTSC or PAL: Choose a preset that matches your local TV stan-
dard. (See Chapter 3 for more on TV standards.) 
 
• Aspect ratio: If your movie uses a 16:9 widescreen ratio, choose a 
widescreen preset. If you’re recording high-def video to a standard-
def DVD, choose a widescreen preset because HD video is almost 
always widescreen. Aspect ratios are covered in Chapter 3.
 
 If you’re burning a Blu-Ray disc, you have three choices to make:
 
• NTSC or PAL: Choose a preset that matches your local TV standard.
 
• Resolution: Choose a resolution that matches your source footage. 
If your footage is from an HDV camcorder, the resolution is prob-
ably 1440 x 1080. Many AVCHD camcorders record footage at 1920 
x 1080, which is the resolution of so-called “Full HD.” See Chapter 2 
for more on camcorder formats.
 
• Codec: You can burn your Blu-Ray disc using either the H.264 or 
MPEG-2 codec. H.264 compresses video more efficiently, but if 
your H.264 discs don’t play in some Blu-Ray players, try using the 
MPEG-2 codec instead.
 
10. Choose a quality setting.
 
 Usually I recommend leaving the Fit Contents to Available Space option 
checked. Premiere Elements automatically detects how much space is 
available and burns your movie at the highest quality that will fit. You 

287
 Chapter 16: Burning Your Movies to Disc
can disable this option for DVDs and manually choose a quality level 
by using the Video Quality slider. Drag it left to cram more video on the 
disc, or drag it right to maximize the image quality. The quality slider 
isn’t available when burning Blu-Ray discs.
 
 Pay attention to what is listed next to the Space Required indicator. If 
you are burning to a folder, make sure that the amount of space shown 
in the Space Required indicator will fit on whatever kind of media you 
plan to use when you burn the movie onto a disc.
 
11. When you are ready to burn the disc, click Burn.
 
 The Burn Progress window appears. Remember — burning can take a 
long time. The longest part of the process is encoding, which is where the 
movie is converted into the format used by DVD and Blu-Ray players. 
 
12. When the burn process is complete, click Close to close the Burn 
Progress dialog box.
 
 When the burn process is complete, make sure that you test your disc in 
as many players as possible. 
 
Some players won’t play certain DVDs or BDs. If you find that your discs 
often don’t play properly, try a different brand of blank discs, or try burning 
the disc by using different software, such as Nero Burning ROM or Roxio Easy 
CD Creator.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
M
ost people love top-ten lists. Most people have ten 
fingers. Coincidence? I don’t think so. If you’ve 
ever read a For Dummies book, you know what this part is 
all about. The chapters in this part provide top-ten lists to 
help you find useful stuff by tens — ten advanced editing 
techniques in Premiere Elements, ten secrets of movie-
making, and ten pieces of software and hardware you just 
won’t want to do without.
At the end of this part is an appendix. Unlike the appendix 
that is part of the human anatomy, the appendix of 
Premiere 8 Elements For Dummies serves an important 
function. Throughout this book, and indeed through your 
entire adventure in video editing, you will encounter an 
entirely different language referring to video editing and 
technologies. You encounter new terms like interlacing or 
pixel aspect ratio and countless acronyms like NTSC and 
NLE. Thus, this glossary serves as a dictionary of video-
graphy lingo.

A
dobe didn’t design Premiere Elements for professional video editors. 
Premiere Elements is primarily aimed at video hobbyists, people who 
have digital camcorders and want to turn their raw video into fun, personal-
ized movies. But Premiere Elements brings a level of pro-caliber video-editing 
capabilities heretofore unseen in affordable video-editing programs, and I 
think it’s only natural that you’ll want to use this better software to make 
better movies. 
Moviemaking is an art, and as with any art there’s no single formula or magic 
technique to guarantee a great movie. At least with Premiere Elements your 
creativity probably won’t be limited by the software. Premiere Elements has 
so many features and capabilities that you’ll probably come up with editing 
tricks and techniques all your own. But if you lack inspiration at the moment 
or just want to practice more advanced techniques, this chapter is for you. 
Here I’ve collected some (ten, to be precise) advanced editing techniques 
that didn’t quite seem to fit anywhere else in the book.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Creating Cinematic Slideshows
Once upon a time — back before Flickr.com, before PowerPoint presenta-
tions, and way before digital cameras — the slideshow was a time-honored 
tradition for sharing vacation photos. You’d invite all your friends and family 
over, close the curtains, dim the lights, and fire up your slide projector. Your 
audience was enthralled (or bored) by your narrated photo presentation. 
Most people don’t shoot slides anymore, and the bulb in your slide projector 
probably burned out 15 years ago. But it’s still possible to enthrall (or bore) 
your friends with personalized slideshows. Premiere Elements can help you 
create a slideshow that, when burned onto a DVD, can be viewed on any TV. 
In Chapter 7, I show you how to put clips — both video and stills — into the 
Timeline. The most basic way to create a slideshow is to drop a series of still 
images in the Timeline, add some transitions (Chapter 9) and titles (Chapter 13),
and burn the finished “movie” to a disc (Chapter 16). Creating a slideshow 
manually is time consuming, so I recommend that you instead use the 
SlideShow feature in the Adobe Organizer. Here’s how:
 
1. Launch Premiere Elements, and click Organize on the splash screen.
 
2. In the Organizer, choose File➪Get Photos and Videos➪From Files and 
Folders.
 
3. Browse to the still images you want to use in your slideshow, select 
the desired images, and click Get Media.
 
 The still images are imported into the Adobe Organizer.
 
4. In the Organizer, select the photos you want to use in the slideshow.
 
 Ctrl+click or Shift+click to select multiple photos.
 
5. Click the Create tab on the right side of the Organizer, and then click 
Slide Show.
 
6. Choose slideshow settings, and then click OK.
 
 You can choose the length of time images play, the length and style of 
transitions, the background color, and more. Choose Apply Pan & Zoom 
to All Slides to add motion and visual appeal to the slideshow. 
 
7. In the Slide Show Editor that appears, as shown in Figure 17-1, click a 
slide in the slideshow Timeline to customize that slide. 
 
 Under Extras, click the Titles or Narration buttons to add those elements, 
or click-and-drag graphics to an image. In Figure 17-1, two animals and a 
frilly shirt have been added to the slide. You can also enable or disable 
Pan & Zoom for individual slides, or change the background color.
 
8. Click a transition in the Timeline to open transition controls. 
 
 You can change the duration or style of each transition.

 It may take a few minutes to export the slideshow. 
Bringing Still Photos to Life
When motion pictures first appeared in the 19th century, some people prob-
ably thought it meant the end of still photography. But still photos have stub-
bornly refused to go away, and you may find that you sometimes want to use 
photos in your movie projects. 
The problem with still photos is that they’re just so, well, still. To help still 
photos fit in better with your movies, I recommend adding some subtle pan-
and-zoom effects. Slowly zooming or panning across an image makes that 
image come alive and feel more natural in your movie. To pan or zoom, click 
the Edit tab on the Task pane and then click Effects. In the categories menu, 

294
Part V: The Part of Tens 
choose Presets, and then choose one of the following categories from the 
subcategories menu. The pan and zoom subcategories are
 
✓ Horizontal Image Pans: These presets pan horizontally left-to-right or 
right-to-left across the image.
 
✓ Horizontal Image Zooms: These zoom in or out on the image along a 
horizontal plane.
 
✓ Vertical Image Pans: These presets pan vertically up or down the image.
 
✓ Vertical Image Zooms: These zoom in or out on the image along a verti-
cal plane.
Drag and drop an image pan or zoom preset to a still image in the Timeline, 
just like any other effect. These presets modify the image’s Motion settings. 
As with most effects, you may have to experiment to get just the desired 
effect. And of course, preview your edits carefully.
Making Stop-Motion Video
If you love to make movie magic, stop-motion video should definitely be 
in your spell book. Stop-motion video is one of the oldest special effects 
techniques in all of moviemaking, and it’s used to create a variety of visual 
illusions. Remember those claymation shows like Gumby and Frosty the 
Snowman you used to watch when you were a kid? Stop-motion animation 
was used to make the clay figures in those shows appear to move on their 
own. Stop-motion video can also be used to speed up something that would 
otherwise happen very slowly, such as the blooming of a flower. 
Premiere Elements makes it easy for you to create your own stop-motion 
video. To make your stop-motion idea successful, follow these steps:
 
1. Plan the video shoot carefully. 
 
 You may be tempted to try to shoot a series of still photos, but I recom-
mend that you just use your video camera and record video instead. 
You can then select individual frames later in Premiere Elements. 
Important elements for a successful stop-motion video shoot include:
 
• Use a tripod. This is absolutely mandatory for successful stop-
motion video capture. When you shoot, be extremely careful not to 
bump the tripod or move the camera. Tiny camera movements will 
be jarringly obvious in the final stop-motion video. See Chapter 19 
for tips on choosing a tripod.
 
• Maintain constant lighting. If you’re shooting a blooming flower 
outside, you probably don’t have any control over the sun. But 
watch out for shadows or other lighting changes because they will 
appear as flashes in your stop-motion video. 

295
 Chapter 17: Ten Advanced Premiere Elements Techniques
 
• Let the camera roll. Don’t try to stop recording between each 
“frame” of stop-motion video. Just record video as normal. This 
saves time and minimizes the risk of bumping the camera. If you 
need to stop and restart recording, use the camera’s remote 
control.
 
• Clear your schedule. Even if you use five frames from every 
minute of video (an ambitious goal), one hour of recorded video 
will yield only about ten seconds of stop-motion video. 
 
2. Open the video capture window, as described in Chapter 5.
 
3. At the top of the Capture window, choose Stop Motion, and then click 
Create New Stop Motion in the Capture window. 
 
4. Place a check mark next to Time Lapse, click Set Time, and then 
choose an interval for capturing frames. 
 
 Time lapse capture works well if you want to capture frames automati-
cally at regular intervals. 
 
5. Click Play to start playing the video, and click the Grab Frame button 
whenever you want to grab a frame. 
 
 I recommend that you leave the Onion Skinning option enabled. This 
option overlays a ghost image of the preceding frame over the video 
as it plays. Onion skinning helps you maintain continuity and proper 
smooth motion as you capture your stop-motion video. 
 
6. Click Stop, and close the Capture window when you’re done capturing 
frames. 
 
7. Click Yes when you are prompted to save the images as a video file, 
and then enter a name for the file.
Premiere Elements creates an AVI video file of the frames you captured, 
and it appears as a video clip in the Organizer. You can then drop it into the 
Timeline and edit it just like you would with any other video clip. 
Making Two Clips into One Scene
Have you ever wondered if you have an evil twin somewhere in the world? 
With some simple videography tricks and Adobe Premiere Elements, you can 
easily make your evil twin a visual reality, as shown in Figure 17-2. No human 
cloning is necessary for this effect. You shoot the two scenes quickly, and 
then edit them together as a single scene in Premiere Elements. 
To make this effect work, you first shoot one-half of the image, and then 
shoot the other half. This gives two clips that will be combined to make a 
single scene. One clip is placed in track Video 1, and the other clip — call 
it the overlay clip — is placed in track Video 2, as shown in Figure 17-2. 

296
Part V: The Part of Tens 
You then apply the Crop effect to the overlay clip so it only covers half the 
screen. Notice in Figure 17-2 that I have cropped 44.6% off the right side of 
my overlay clip. To apply the Crop effect, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Edit tab, and then click Effects.
 
2. Scroll down to the Transform category of video effects.
 
3. Click-and-drag the Crop effect from the Edit pane to an overlay clip in 
the Timeline.
 
 An overlay clip should be in track Video 2 or higher.
 
4. Click the overlay clip in the Timeline to select it.
 
5. Click Edit Effects at the bottom of the Edit pane.
 
 Alternatively, right-click the overlay clip in the Timeline and choose 
Show Properties from the menu that appears.
 
6. Expand the Crop effect options, as shown in Figure 17-2.
 
 When you select the Crop effect, handles appear around the corners of 
the video image in the Monitor.
 
7. Click-and-drag a corner of the video image to crop it.

297
 Chapter 17: Ten Advanced Premiere Elements Techniques
When you crop a video image in an overlay track, video images in underlying 
tracks show up in the cropped area. To make the “seeing double” effect suc-
cessful, follow these simple rules:
 
✓ Use a tripod. A tripod is absolutely mandatory to make this effect work. 
You won’t be able to hold the camera steady enough by hand, and a jig-
gling camera ruins the results.
 
✓ Don’t move the camera between shots. The camera must remain abso-
lutely still between each clip. If you have to reposition the camera, or if 
someone bumps it, reshoot both scenes. If your camcorder has a remote 
control, use it to start and stop recording so that even the slight touch 
of your finger doesn’t move the camera.
 
✓ Shoot the “before” and “after” scenes quickly. If you’re shooting 
outdoors, shadows and lighting can change quickly. Even subtle light 
changes will be apparent when you edit the two scenes together later. 
So stop reading and start shooting. Now!
 
✓ Don’t disturb the rest of the scene. If your subject moves a chair or 
picks up an object between the “before” and “after” shots, the scenes 
will appear inconsistent when edited together.
Freeze-Framing Video
Have you ever watched those old “Road Runner” cartoons where Wile E. 
Coyote attempts to chase down the Road Runner? You probably remember 
a scene that appeared early in each cartoon — Road Runner would momen-
tarily freeze, and its scientific name (Acceleratii Incredibilus or something 
along those lines) would appear on the screen. 
You can add momentary freeze-frames to your video as well. To momentarily 
freeze a frame of video in the middle of a clip, and then make it play again, 
follow these steps:

Recalling the Golden Age of Cinema
Motion pictures have been around for well over a century now. You can pay 
homage to the history of cinema by using some “old” (or at least old-looking) 
footage in your movie projects. Thankfully, creating old-looking footage 
doesn’t require a trip to some dank film vault deep beneath a Hollywood 
studio. You can easily simulate old-fashioned film by following these tips:
 
✓ Beware the anachronism! Pay attention to your subjects and the scene. 
For example, cowboys of the Old West didn’t carry cell phones at their 
hips, nor was the sky filled with condensation trails left by jet airplanes. 
Remove objects from the scene that don’t fit the period you are trying to 
simulate, and make sure that the background doesn’t depict modernity.
 
✓ Remove color from the clip. Perhaps the easiest way to convert a color 
image to grayscale is to use the Black & White filter in the Image Control 
category of Video Effects (click Effects on the Edit tab), although I prefer 
to use the Color Balance (HLS) effect. Adjust the saturation level to –100 
to desaturate all colors in the clip. See Chapter 10 for more on adjusting 
video color. 
 
 One advantage of using the Color Balance (HLS) effect is that you can 
use keyframes to change the effect in the middle of a clip.
 
 Grayscale is just a fancy way of saying black and white. Grayscale is a 
more technically accurate term because black-and-white video images 
are actually made using various shades of gray.
 
✓ “Weather” the video image. Film tends to deteriorate over time, so if 
you’re trying to simulate old footage, you should simulate some of that 
deterioration. Use the Noise effect under Stylize to add some graininess 
to the video image. Video effects are described in Chapter 12.
 
✓ Reduce audio quality and if possible use a mono setting. Audio record-
ings made 75 years ago did not use 16-bit stereo sound. To reduce qual-
ity, reduce the sampling rate of the audio when you export your movie 
(see Chapters 14, 15, and 16 for more on movie export settings). 
 
 Alternatively, you may want to go for the “silent movie” effect and not 
record any audio at all. Just use an appropriate musical soundtrack and 
insert title screens for dialogue.
 
✓ Use the Old Film effect. One of the NewBlue effects (see Chapter 12) 
that comes with Premiere Elements is the Old Film effect. If you don’t 
feel like spending a lot of time manually aging your video images, simply 
click-and-drag this effect to your clips. It instantly adds 75 years to any 
video image.

Working with Mattes
TV screens are usually rectangular, and so most video images are rectangu-
lar, as well. But you can make a video image of virtually any shape you want 
by using mattes. Matte is simply a fancy name for a solid-colored screen or a 
screen with a monochrome shape. To use mattes, follow these steps:
 
1. In a graphics program such as Photoshop Elements, create an image 
file with the shape you want to use for your matte.
 
 I recommend creating a matte with just two contrasting colors (black 
and white provide the best contrast). Also, follow the guidelines I give in 
Chapter 5 for creating still images for use in movies. Save the image as a 
PSD (Photoshop Document) file.
 
2. Choose File➪Get Media From➪PC Files and Folders, and import the 
matte image.
 
 I describe how to import media into Premiere Elements in Chapter 5.
 
3. Add the matte image to an overlay track in the Timeline, and click Yes 
when you are asked if you want to apply Videomerge to the clip.
 
 Overlay tracks are tracks Video 2 or higher. In Figure 17-4, I have 
inserted a matte image that is shaped like a soccer ball.

ball matte

Video 2.
 

301
 Chapter 17: Ten Advanced Premiere Elements Techniques
 
4. Make sure the CTI in the Timeline is somewhere on the overlay clip so 
that it appears in the Monitor window, as shown in Figure 17-4.
 
5. Right-click the matte clip in the Timeline and choose Show Properties 
from the menu that appears.
 
6. In the effect controls that appear, click the arrow next to Videomerge 
to expand Videomerge settings.
 
7. Place a check mark next to Select Color.
 
8. Click the eyedropper icon under Select Color, and then click a portion 
of the matte that you want to make transparent.
 
 The selected color becomes transparent, as shown in Figure 17-4.
 
9. Click-and-drag the tolerance slider to fine-tune the matte’s appearance.
 
10. If desired, place a check mark next to Invert Selection.
 
11. Choose Done to close the clip properties and save your changes.
Adding a Lens Flare
Camera lenses, whether in still cameras or camcorders, are made of glass 
and are designed to collect light. Despite advanced lens coatings, those glass 
lenses can still reflect light when they’re supposed to be collecting it. This 
phenomenon is especially common when the sun shines directly onto a cam-
era’s lens. Intense sunlight causes sharp reflections called lens flares. 
Generally, lens flares are to be avoided. Higher-quality camcorders often 
incorporate large lens hoods to prevent lens flares. But sometimes a lens 
flare can be used for dramatic effect. Consider many recent movies that 
feature computer animation. Faux lens flares are often used to make the ani-
mated image seem more real. And in real video images that are washed out 
from too much sun, you can add manufactured lens flares to accentuate color 
and detail. Or you may want to add a lens flare to a properly lit desert scene 
simply to draw attention to the fact that the sun is blazing brightly overhead. 
To add a lens flare, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Timeline, move the CTI to a frame where the sun appears or 
where you would otherwise like the sun to appear to appear.
 
2. Click the Edit tab, and then click Effects.
 
3. Click-and-drag the Lens Flare effect (in the Generate category) to a 
clip to which you want to add a lens flare.
 
 A fake lens flare appears on your video image.

302
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
4. Click Edit Effects on the Edit tab, and then click the arrow next to 
Lens Flare to open Lens Flare effect settings.
 
5. Click Lens Flare to select the effect. 
 
 A circle with cross hairs appears in the middle of the lens flare in the 
Monitor window, as shown in Figure 17-5.
 
6. Click-and-drag the cross-hairs to reposition the lens flare.
 
 Notice that as you move the center of the lens flare around the screen, 
the fake reflections move and adjust as well.
 
7. Adjust the brightness of the flare, using the Flare Brightness slider.
 
8. Choose a lens type, using the Lens Type menu.
 
 Each lens type gives a slightly different lens flare appearance. 
Experiment with each one, as well as with the Brightness slider and the 
flare center to achieve just the right look.
 
9. Adjust the Blend With Original slider to reduce the flare’s intensity.
 
 This is a setting that calls for experimentation.
 
10. Click Done when you are done fine-tuning your lens flare.
 
Figure 17-5:

Controls

303
 Chapter 17: Ten Advanced Premiere Elements Techniques
 
If the camera’s view pans across a scene, the lens flare should appear to 
“move” with the lens. Use keyframes to change the position of the lens flare as 
the clip plays. I show how to use effect keyframes in Chapter 12.
Taking the Hum Out
As I point out in Chapter 8, audio is too often overlooked when editing 
video. One common editing problem is constant-frequency humming that 
sometimes occurs in audio recordings. The humming may be caused by 
interference from a fluorescent light or other electric device, or a flaw in the 
microphone or recording device. 
Whatever the cause, if you have an audio recording with an annoying hum, 
Premiere Elements has a tool that may help you remove that hum. That tool 
is the Notch effect, which can be found in the list of Audio Effects on the Edit 
tab (click Effects on the Edit tab and choose Audio Effects from the category 
menu). The Notch effect removes all audio at or near a given frequency 
within the clip. Here’s how to use it:
 
1. Click and drag the Notch effect to the humming clip, and then click 
Edit Effects at the bottom of the Edit tab to open the Effect Controls. 
 
2. Expand the Notch controls.
 
3. Adjust the Center slider to find the frequency causing the hum. 
 
 If the hum comes from a poorly shielded power cord, adjust the Center 
slider to 60 Hz if you live in an area that uses NTSC video, or 50 Hz if 
video equipment in your area uses PAL. 
 
4. Adjust the Q slider to broaden the frequency range of the sound that 
is removed. 
 
 Be careful not to broaden the range too much or the audio quality will 
diminish considerably. 
A Zoom with a View
As I mention in Chapter 18, constantly zooming in and out with your cam-
corder’s zoom lens is one of the most common mistakes made by amateur 
videographers. But sometimes zooming can have a desirable dramatic effect, 
especially when you want to show that the emphasis of the scene is sud-
denly shifting to a single point. Often, you realize that a shot or scene calls 
for a zoom effect only after you’ve shot your video and are using Premiere 
Elements to edit and fine-tune the project. 

304
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Adobe Premiere Elements can come to your rescue! Using the Camera View 
effect, you can quickly zoom in on a specific point in a video image. The 
Camera View effect is located in the Transform category of the Video Effects 
folder (click Effects on the Edit pane and scroll down to the Transform cat-
egory). Here’s what you do to zoom in:
 
1. Click-and-drag the Camera View effect to a clip, and then click Edit 
Effects at the bottom of the Edit tab.
 
2. Expand the Camera View effect, and then adjust the Zoom slider. 
 
 The default zoom level on the slider is 10. 
 
3. To zoom in, drag the Zoom slider to the left. 
 
 Use keyframes (see Chapter 12 for more on controlling video effects 
using keyframes) to change the level of zoom as the clip plays.
 
You can zoom out on video images as well by using the Camera View effect, 
but keep in mind that as you zoom out, the edges of the video screen will 
become empty. Choose a fill color for the empty areas, using the Fill Color 
control. Black works best most of the time. And if you zoom in on a video 
image, the picture may start to look pixilated and blocky.

H
ave you ever watched a movie and wondered, “How did they do that?” 
Moviemakers have been perfecting their art and developing new tech-
niques for over a century, and they’ve gotten pretty good at what they do. If 
you watch a “Making of . . .” documentary, you may get the impression that 
modern moviemaking is all about fancy computer animation effects and mas-
sive budgets, but even the biggest blockbuster projects still rely on many 
time-honored and proven techniques. 
In this chapter I show you ten tips and secrets of videography that won’t 
break the bank or require you to get a degree in computer animation. Here I 
show ten techniques to help you to shoot better video, record better audio, 
and more. 
Keep Your Camera at the Ready
“I wish I had my camera!”
Have you ever said that? If so, then you already know the importance of keep-
ing a camera with you at all times and having it ready to go. Some of history’s 
most important video recordings were not part of formal video shoots; they 
were shot by people who just happened to be in the right place at the right 
time with a camera. 

306
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Fortunately, keeping a video camera handy has never been easier because 
modern camcorders — especially ones that use flash memory for storage — 
can be extremely small and lightweight. Video can also be recorded with other 
devices such as digital still cameras and cell phones. 
Your camcorder isn’t your only piece of video gear, although it is the most 
important. Here’s a check list of items to have for almost any video shoot:
 
✓ Camcorder, owner’s manual, and remote control (if your camcorder 
has one)
 
✓ Extra charged batteries and spare blank tapes, discs, or memory cards
 
✓ Lens cleaner and lens filters
 
✓ Tripod
 
✓ Black gaffer tape (available from photo/video shops)
I usually keep all these items in my camcorder bag so that if I have my cam-
corder, I have all my filters and spare batteries too. If you’re going on a more 
formal video shoot, you may also want to bring:
 
✓ Lights, extension cords, reflectors, clamps, and backdrops
 
✓ AC adapter and/or battery charger for your camcorder
 
✓ Microphones and headphones
 
✓ Scene checklist
Balance Your Whites
Your fancy new camcorder features advanced image stabilization, high-def 
recording, crystal-clear audio, and is small enough to fit in your pocket. With 
all these advanced features, you would think it could at least record the color 
white correctly. Think again!
One thing modern camcorders still can’t control is ambient light. Different 
light sources such as fluorescent lights, tungsten lights, or the sun greatly 
affect how whites and other colors appear in photos and video recordings. 
Colors that look warm and natural to your eye may appear gray and cold in 
your video.
To avoid unnatural color casts in your video, manually set the white balance 
on your camera. Some cheaper camcorders don’t let you manually set white 
balance. Check the camera’s documentation to see if and how to set white 
balance. If your camcorder doesn’t allow you to manually set white balance, 
see the “Use Video Filters” section later in this chapter for information about 
color-correction filters. 

307
 Chapter 18: Ten Videography Tips and Secrets
If you can manually set white balance, follow these basic steps whenever you 
prepare to shoot in a new setting:
 
1. Find a nonreflective solid white surface.
 
 A letter-size sheet of white printer paper works great. Some people 
might tell you that you need a photo-specific white balance reference 
card. Such a card may indeed be a more perfect shade of white, but even 
in my professional video studio we use sheets of paper borrowed from 
the local office printer.
 
 Make sure that the white surface is actually white! Some white printer 
paper actually has a grayish tint, especially if it is recycled. 
 
2. Set up your lighting.
 
 Whenever possible, you should white balance using exactly the same 
lighting that will be present when you shoot video. This avoids color 
and light inconsistency caused by different kinds of lighting.
 
3. Hold the flat white surface several feet in front of your camera. 
 
4. Zoom the camera in so that the white surface fills the entire 
video image. 
 
5. Activate your camera’s manual white balance setting. 
 
 Again, check the camera’s documentation to see if white balance can be 
set, and if so, how to do it. 
Expose the Highlights
As you shoot video, pay special attention to the highlights. I’m not talking 
about the most exciting parts of the video action — although you should pay 
attention to those too — I’m referring to the brightest areas of your video 
image.
Why pay attention to the highlights? If your video image is overexposed — 
that is, the camera is capturing too much light — the highlights will be blown-
out white blotches, as shown in Figure 18-1. Color and details in blown-out 
highlights are lost, a problem that becomes especially apparent when view-
ing high-definition video on a HDTV. 
Most camcorders set exposure automatically, but unfortunately, auto-exposure 
frequently leads to blown-out highlights. If your camcorder lets you manually 
adjust exposure, use that adjustment to turn down the exposure when you 
see blown-out highlights. It may seem like some parts of the video are under-
exposed, but when it comes to high-def video it is usually better to be slightly 
underexposed rather than overexposed. 

308

images.
 
 
Some more-advanced camcorders offer an advanced exposure metering tool 
called a zebra pattern. The camcorder detects overexposed areas and shows a 
zebra-stripe pattern over those areas in the viewfinder or on the LCD screen. 
(Don’t worry; the zebra stripes aren’t actually recorded with your video.) If 
your camcorder can show zebra patterns, enable this handy feature and leave 
it on at all times. 
Shade Your Lens
You may have noticed that pro-style video cameras usually have big hoods in 
front of the lens. The purpose of these hoods is to prevent glare or lens flares 
caused when a bright light source (such as the sun) reflects on the lens sur-
face. A tiny speck of dust on the front of your lens can turn into a giant ugly 
spot on your video image if sunlight hits it just right. 
Consumer camcorders usually don’t have lens hoods, but making your own 
hood is easy. Obtain some flat black gaffer tape from your local photo and 
video specialty shop, and use a couple of strips of tape to construct a tempo-
rary shade around your lens on sunny days. Zoom your lens out to its widest 
angle, and then check the camera’s viewscreen to make sure that your make-
shift hood isn’t visible in the corners of the video image. 

309
 Chapter 18: Ten Videography Tips and Secrets
For a more permanent solution, check with your camcorder’s manufacturer 
to see if an accessory lens hood is available. If your camcorder has filter 
threads in a standard size such as 37mm, you may be able to buy aftermarket 
hoods that attach directly to the filter threads. 
 
Is your camcorder’s LCD screen hard to see on bright, sunny days? Construct 
a shade for the LCD screen by using strips of black gaffer tape. You can make a 
reusable shade with black-painted cardboard and gaffer tape, and then secure 
it to your LCD screen with rubber bands.
Use Video Filters
Say you’re making a movie showing the fun people can have when they’re 
stuck indoors on a rainy day. Such a movie wouldn’t be complete without 
an establishing shot to show one of the subjects looking out a window at the 
dismal weather. Alas, when you try to shoot this scene, all you see is a big, 
nasty, glaring reflection on the window.
Reflections are among the many video problems you can resolve with a lens 
filter on your camcorder. Filters usually attach to the front of your camera 
lens, and change the nature of the light passing through it. Different kinds of 
filters have different effects. Common filter types include
 
✓ Polarizing filter: This type of filter sometimes features an adjustable 
ring and can be used to reduce or control reflections on windows, water, 
and other shiny surfaces. Polarizing filters are also useful for panoramic 
landscape shots. They eliminate haze so that those far-off mountains 
show up more clearly in your images. 
 
✓ Neutral-density (ND) filter: This filter works kind of like sunglasses for 
your camcorder. It reduces the amount of light that passes through the 
lens, preventing overexposure in very bright conditions.
 
 Because a ND filter reduces the amount of light going through the lens, 
the camcorder’s aperture or iris must open wider. Wider aperture set-
tings improve color saturation, and they reduce the picture’s depth-of-
field, which is the range of things in the image that are in focus. A bigger 
depth-of-field (caused by a smaller aperture) keeps more of your image 
in focus, but sometimes you may prefer a shallower depth-of-field to blur 
a distracting background. 
 
✓ Soft filter: A soft filter softens details slightly in your image. This filter 
is often used to hide skin blemishes or wrinkles on actors who are more 
advanced in age.
 
✓ Star filter: Creates starlike patterns on extreme light sources to add a 
sense of magic to the video.

310
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Many more kinds of filters are available. Check with the manufacturer of your 
camcorder to see whether the company also offers filters specially designed 
for your camera; check the camcorder’s documentation to see what kinds 
of filters can work with your camcorder. Many camcorders accept standard 
37mm or 58mm threaded filters, regardless of the manufacturer. 
 
When you buy a new camcorder, always try to choose one with filter threads 
in front of the lens. Many cheaper camcorders don’t have filter threads, and 
some have fake threads that can’t actually be used for anything because 
they’re tapered. 
Avoid Auto-Focus Hunting
Auto focus has been a standard camcorder feature since the 1980s. Auto 
focus is a boon because it usually eliminates the need to manually focus your 
images, leaving you free to focus (get it?) your attention on other aspects of 
your video shoot. 
But camcorders are machines, and machines don’t always get things right. 
You’ve probably experienced the maddening problem of auto-focus hunt-
ing, where your subject goes in and out of focus unpredictably. Hunting is 
especially problematic in low-light shooting situations. Suppose, for example, 
you’re shooting a school play. In the dark auditorium, many camcorders will 
hunt back-and-forth between the action on the stage and the backs of peo-
ples’ heads in the audience. 
The only way to truly avoid auto-focus hunting is to turn off auto focus. 
Check your camcorder’s documentation to see how to do it. If you’re lucky, 
the camcorder has a focus ring around the lens to help you easily adjust 
focus manually. Otherwise you may have to resort to slider switches or 
arrow buttons on the camera’s control panel. The easiest way to set focus 
manually is to let auto focus adjust to the desired subject. When the focus is 
set the way you want, disable auto focus. 
 
Many camcorders give three focus options: Auto-Focus, Manual, and Infinity. 
On most consumer camcorders, the Infinity setting works for pretty much any-
thing over 15 to 20 feet away. 

311
 Chapter 18: Ten Videography Tips and Secrets
Use (But Don’t Abuse) the Zoom Lens
If every camcorder owner makes a single mistake, it’s zoom-lens abuse. On 
most camcorders, the zoom feature is easy and fun to use, encouraging us 
to use it more than is prudent. Constantly zooming in and out is disorienting 
and creates a video image that just looks, well, amateur. Here are some gen-
eral zoom-lens guidelines to follow on any video shoot:
 
✓ If possible, avoid zooming in or out while you’re recording. Try to 
adjust zoom before you start recording.
 
✓ If you must zoom while recording, try to zoom only once during the 
shot. This will make the zoom look planned rather than chaotic.
 
✓ Consider the merits of actually moving the camera closer to your sub-
ject rather than zooming in or out.
 
✓ Most cameras have variable zoom speeds. Move the zoom slider a little, 
and it zooms slowly. Move the slider a bit more, and it zooms faster. 
Unfortunately, the zoom slider is usually tiny and hard to control. If you 
must zoom while recording, check your camcorder’s settings to see if 
you can turn off variable zoom speed and set a slower speed. Slower 
zooms are more visually pleasing than fast zooms. 
 
✓ Practice using the zoom control. Zooming slowly and smoothly is usu-
ally preferable, but it takes a practiced hand on the control.
 
If you have a difficult time using the zoom control smoothly, try taping or 
gluing a piece of foam to the zoom-slider button on your camcorder. The foam 
can help dampen your inputs on the control.
Hear Your Video
Ambient noise is the general din that we don’t usually think much about 
because it surrounds us constantly. Ambient noise might come from chirp-
ing birds, an airplane flying overhead, chattering bystanders, passing cars, a 
blowing furnace, the little fans spinning inside your computer, and even the 
tiny motor turning the tape reels in your camcorder. Although it’s easy to 
tune out these noises when you’re immersed in them, they can be very loud 
and ugly when they are captured in your audio recordings.

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
If you’re recording outdoors or in a public gathering place, you probably 
can’t do much to eliminate the actual sources of ambient noise. But wherever 
you are recording, you can take basic steps to manage ambient noise:
 
✓ Use a microphone. I know, this is about the millionth time I’ve said it, 
but a microphone placed close to your subject can go a long way toward 
ensuring that the sound you actually want to record is not totally over-
whelmed by ambient noise. 
 
✓ Wear headphones. Many camcorders have headphone jacks. If you plug 
in a set of headphones, you can listen to the audio that is actually being 
recorded, and possibly detect potential annoyances at the beginning of 
shooting — before they become actual problems.
 
✓ Record and preview some audio. Record a little bit of audio and then 
play it back. How does it sound? This preemptive strategy helps you 
identify ambient noise or other audio problems. 
 
✓ Shield the camcorder’s mic from wind. A gentle breeze may seem 
almost silent to your ear, but the camcorder’s microphone may pick it 
up as a loud roar that overwhelms all other sound. If nothing else, you 
can position your hand to block wind from blowing directly across the 
screen on the front of your camcorder’s mic. 
 
✓ Minimize sound reflection. Audio waves reflect off hard surfaces, which 
can cause echoing . . . echoing . . . in a recording . . . in a recording. Hang 
blankets on walls and other hard surfaces to reduce sound reflection.
 
✓ Turn off fans, heaters, and air conditioners. Air rushing through vents 
creates a surprising amount of unwanted ambient noise. If possible, tem-
porarily turn off your furnace, air conditioner, or anything else with fans 
(including computers and game consoles) while you record. Listen for 
other noise sources, too, such as lawn mowers and leaf blowers. 
 
✓ Turn off cell phones. You know how annoying it is when someone’s 
cell phone rings while you’re trying to watch a movie; just imagine how 
bothersome it will be when you’re making a movie! Make sure that you 
and everyone else on the video shoot turns those things off. And I do 
mean off, not just silenced. Some cell phones emit electromagnetic inter-
ference when they receive data or text messages, and that interference 
may be picked up as loud buzzing on audio recordings.
 
✓ Warn everyone else to be quiet. If other people are in the building or 
general area, ask them to be quiet while you are recording audio. Noises 
from the next room may be muffled, but they still contribute to ambi-
ent noise. And of course, resist the urge to chat with off-camera people 
while you record; even your faint whispering will be recorded.

Deal with the Elements
You may, at times, deal with extremes of temperature or other weather con-
ditions while shooting video. No, this section isn’t about making sure the 
people in your movies wear jackets when it’s cold (although it’s always wise 
to bundle up). I’m more concerned about the health of your camcorder right 
now, and several environmental factors can affect it:
 
✓ Condensation: If you quickly move your camera from a very cold envi-
ronment to a very warm environment (or vice versa), condensation can 
form on or even inside the lens. Avoid subjecting your camcorder to 
rapid, extreme temperature changes.
 
✓ Heat: Don’t leave your camcorder or tapes in a roasting car when it’s 
105 degrees out. Consider storing tapes in a cooler (but not the one 
holding your lunch). Your videotape cooler shouldn’t contain any food 
or liquids. Simply placing the tapes in an empty cooler helps insulate 
them from temperature extremes.
 
✓ Water: A few drops of rain can quickly destroy the sensitive electronic 
circuits inside your camcorder. If you believe that water may be a prob-
lem, cover your camcorder with a plastic bag, or shoot your video at 
another time, if possible.
 
✓ Wind: Even a gentle breeze blowing across the screen on your cam-
corder’s microphone can cause a loud roaring on the audio recording. 
Try to shield your microphone from wind unless you know that you’ll be 
replacing the audio later during the editing process.
Another environmental hazard in many video shoots is the sun — that big, 
bright ball of nuclear fusion that crosses the sky every day. The sun makes 
plants grow, provides solar energy, and helps humans generate Vitamin D. 
But like all good things, the sun is best enjoyed in moderation. Too much 
sunlight causes skin cancer, fades the paint on your car, and overexposes 
the subjects in your video. Earlier in this chapter, I describe how to use lens 
hoods and video filters to deal with some sun-related problems. Other tips 
for shooting in bright sunlight include:
 
✓ If possible, position your subject in a shaded area. Shade allows you 
to take advantage of the abundant natural light without overexposure. It 
also helps your subjects avoid squinting.
 
✓ Avoid backlit situations. Even if your subject is in shade, you can have 
problems if you shoot video at such an angle that the background is 
very bright. This is the recipe for creating a severely backlit situation; 

314
Part V: The Part of Tens 
your subject will appear as a black shadow against a brightly glowing 
background. Shoot subjects against a more neutral or dark background 
whenever possible.
 
✓ Wear sunscreen. Your video image isn’t the only thing you should pro-
tect from the sun!
Shoot Multiple Angles
If you have access to multiple cameras, enlist some helpers to shoot video of 
the same event from multiple angles. At a school play, for example, it might 
be nice to have footage of the play, as well as some shots showing audience 
reactions to key scenes. Likewise, when you’re shooting an activity such as 
bicycling or snowboarding, it would be cool to show first- and third-person 
perspectives of the same scene. Later, Premiere Elements makes it easy to 
combine multiple shots into one exciting movie. 
It is possible to fake multiangle video shoots by shooting multiple occur-
rences of the same activity and then editing them together later. But if you 
have more than one camera, take advantage of them! And this doesn’t mean 
that you have to spend thousands of dollars on two brand-new high-def 
camcorders. Instead:
 
✓ Keep that old camcorder. After you buy a new HD camcorder, it’s 
tempting to put your old camcorder on Craigslist or eBay. But you’ll find 
that it’s probably not worth very much money, so why not just keep it 
and let your kids or friends use it? The alternate views you get will prob-
ably be far more valuable than the camera itself. 
 
✓ Invest in a helmet cam. In Chapter 19, I describe a new generation of 
ultra-portable video cameras that are available. They are often called 
helmet or bullet cams, and some can be purchased for as little as $100. 
 
✓ Use a still camera or cell phone. Yes, still cameras and cell phones usu-
ally record pretty low-quality video, but they’re small, they can provide 
some interesting video angles, and you probably already own one.

I
don’t know about you, but I consider myself a gadget hound. As such, 
videography is a great hobby to pursue because there are definitely 
lots of video-related gadgets to play with — and new technologies are being 
developed every day. There are fancy camcorders and accessories, cool mul-
timedia programs, and even some nifty add-ons for your computer. But I don’t 
want to kid you — digital photography, editing, and multimedia technologies 
are among the more expensive technologies out there, so you have picked a 
rewarding (but expensive) hobby to pursue.
If you have money burning a hole in your pocket and you want to find out 
what kind of gear you need to be a more serious video enthusiast, this chap-
ter is for you. In this chapter I show you hardware and software that help you 
create, edit, and share video more effectively — and more expensively.
Adobe Premiere Pro
I know what you’re thinking. This is a book about Adobe Premiere Elements, 
and I’m already trying to up-sell you into a more expensive program. Not 
really; Adobe Premiere Elements is a great program, especially considering 

316
Part V: The Part of Tens 
its very low price. But at some point you may decide that you need even 
more capabilities than those offered by Premiere Elements. And if you decide 
to turn your videography hobby into a profession, you may find that you 
need more-advanced editing features and broader format compatibility than 
what Adobe Premiere Elements offers.
Adobe Premiere Pro is your next logical step up, for two important reasons. 
First, because Premiere Elements is based on Premiere Pro you won’t have a 
steep learning curve if you upgrade to Premiere Pro. If you know how to use 
Premiere Elements, you can get right to work in Premiere Pro. Also, Adobe 
usually offers upgrade discounts, so as a registered Premiere Elements user 
you can probably get a better price on Premiere Pro than you could if you 
switch to a competing program like Apple Final Cut Pro or Avid Xpress (both 
of which are also great programs, by the way). 
What does Premiere Pro offer over the basic Premiere Elements? Here are a 
few key features:
 
✓ Multiple Timelines: The Premiere Pro Timeline allows you to create and 
use multiple sequences. Each sequence is like a separate timeline. You 
can use these multiple timelines to create alternate versions of a project, 
or use them to manage subsections of large projects. Sequences can be 
linked together in a process called nesting. 
 
✓ Multiple Camera Editing: If your project calls for multiple camera angles 
of a single scene, Premiere Pro makes it easy to import, synchronize, 
and edit video from multiple camera sources. 
 
✓ Advanced Color Corrector: Premiere Pro incorporates an advanced, 
professional-grade color correction tool that gives you precision 
control over the color and light in your video images. Also included 
are broadcast-style video scopes such as a waveform monitor, vector-
scope, and YCbCr parade. These scopes help you more precisely 
measure the color and light in your video images.
 
✓ Audio Mixer: The more you work with video, the more you realize the 
importance of great audio. Premiere Pro incorporates an advanced 
audio mixer to give you greater control over your audio. Premiere Pro 
supports 5.1 channel surround sound audio tracks, and you can easily 
pan 5.1 audio by using the Premiere Pro audio mixer. 
 
✓ Batch Capture: Video capture can be a time-consuming process, but in 
Premiere Pro you can create batch lists, which automate much of this 
process.
 
✓ Broad Format Support: Premiere Elements is designed to work with 
the most common types of digital video, but Premiere Pro can handle 
additional formats, such as analog video, 24p, and some professionally 
oriented formats. You also have more precise control over your output, 
so you can tweak your exported movies to match requirements dictated 
by online and broadcast media solutions. 

317
 Chapter 19: Ten Essential Extras for Moviemaking
 
✓ Integration with After Effects, Soundbooth, and Encore: Premiere Pro 
works seamlessly with other professional-grade video products from 
Adobe, including Adobe After Effects, Soundbooth, and Encore. After 
Effects is the industry standard for advanced visual-effects editing, while 
Soundbooth gives you pro-caliber audio mixing and editing capabilities. 
Encore is a professional-grade DVD authoring program that gives you far 
more creative control over menus and other DVD features than what is 
found in Premiere Elements.
Adobe Premiere Pro offers other advantages over Premiere Elements as well, 
including even more effects and transitions, and additional output options. If 
you decide to move up to Premiere Pro, make sure that you also move up to 
Adobe Premiere Pro For Dummies, by Yours Truly (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Audio Recorders
I know, I know, your camcorder records audio along with video, and it’s 
already perfectly synchronized. So what’s the point of a dedicated audio 
recorder? Well, you may need the capabilities of an audio recorder in many 
situations. Take, for example, these three:
 
✓ You may want to record a subject who is across the room — in which 
case, have the subject hold a recorder (or conceal it so it’s off-camera), 
and attach an inconspicuous lavalier microphone. (See the section on 
microphones later in this chapter.)
 
✓ You may want to record only a special sound, on location, and add it to 
the soundtrack later. For example, you might show crashing waves in 
the distant background, but use the close-up sound of those waves for 
dramatic effect.
 
✓ You can record narration for a video project, tweak it till it suits you, 
and then add it to the soundtrack of your movie.
Recording decent audio used to mean spending hundreds or even thousands 
of dollars for a DAT (digital audio tape) recorder. However, these days I 
think the best compromise for any moviemaker on a budget is to use an MP3 
player with an internal or external microphone. The internal microphones 
in most MP3 players are pretty pathetic, but if you use a good external 
microphone, you can achieve CD-quality results. Belkin, Griffin, Macally, and 
XtremeMac all make iPod-compatible stereo microphones. 
Another option is a MiniDisc player/recorder that records CD-quality audio 
in WAV format. Pop the MiniDisc into your computer’s tray-loading CD-ROM 
drive (MiniDiscs don’t work in slot-loading drives) and you can easily import 
it into a Premiere Elements project. Countless MiniDisc recorders are avail-
able for less than $200 from companies that include Aiwa, Sharp, and Sony.

318
Part V: The Part of Tens 
If you frequently need to record studio-quality audio, I recommend a profes-
sional digital recorder that uses hard drives or flash memory to record audio. 
Marantz, Roland, Sony, and many others offer professional audio recording 
devices for under $1,000.
Microphones
Virtually all digital camcorders have built-in microphones with 48-bit stereo 
sound-recording capabilities, but you’ll soon find that the quality of the audio 
you record is still limited primarily by the quality of the microphone you 
use. Therefore, if you care even a little about making great movies, you need 
better microphones than the one built into your camcorder.
 
Your camcorder should have connectors for external microphones, and your 
camcorder’s manufacturer may offer accessory microphones for your specific 
camera. Accessory cameras may mount on your camcorder’s accessory shoe, 
connect to a microphone port, or offer wireless connectivity. 
One type of special microphone you may want to use is a lavalier microphone —
a tiny unit that usually clips to a subject’s clothing to pick up his or her voice. 
You often see lavalier mics clipped to the lapels of TV newscasters. Some 
lavalier units are designed to fit inside clothing or costumes, although prac-
tice and special shielding may be required to eliminate rubbing noises. You 
You also need a slate
If you use a secondary audio recorder during a 
video shoot, one of the biggest challenges you 
may face is synchronizing your separate audio 
and video recordings. Professionals ensure 
synchronization of audio and video by using a 
slate — that black-and-white board that you 
often see production people snapping shut on 
camera just before the director yells, “Action!”
The slate is not just a kitschy movie prop. The 
snapping of the slate makes a noise that can 
be picked up by all audio recorders on-scene. 
When you are editing audio tracks later, this 
noise will show up as a visible spike on the 
audio waveform. Because the slate is snapped 
in front of the camera, you can later match the 
waveform spike on the audio track with the 
visual picture of the slate snapping closed on 
the video track. If you’re recording audio with 
external recorders, consider making your own 
slate to ease audio-video synchronization. You 
can easily make a slate, or you can buy one for 
less than $10 from a video equipment supplier 
such as www.bhphotovideo.com. 

319
 Chapter 19: Ten Essential Extras for Moviemaking
may also need to coach your subjects to sit still so that the lavalier mics can 
pick up their voices more effectively.
You might also use a condenser microphone to record audio. Some prosumer 
(or professional-consumer) camcorders come with large, boom-style condenser 
mics built in. Although these are nice, if you want to record the voice of a 
subject speaking on camera, such mics may still be inferior to a handheld or 
lavalier mic.
 
Microphones are generally defined by the directional pattern in which they 
pick up sound. The three basic categories are cardioid (which has a heart-
shaped pattern), omnidirectional (which picks up sound from all directions), 
and bidirectional (which picks up sound from the sides).
If you’re in the market for a new mic, here’s where you should look:
 
✓ A good place to look for high-quality microphones is a musicians’ supply 
store. Just make sure that the connectors and frequency range are 
compatible with your camcorder or other recording device (check the 
documentation). 
 
✓ You may also want to check with your camcorder’s manufacturer; it 
may offer accessory microphones specially designed to work with your 
camcorder. 
 
✓ The Internet is always a good resource as well. One especially good 
resource is www.shure.com, the Web site of Shure Incorporated. Shure 
sells microphones and other audio products, and the Web site is an 
excellent resource for general information about choosing and using 
microphones.
Video Converters
You have a hot computer for video editing, and you want to capture analog 
video. What are you going to do? You have many, many solutions, of course. 
You could install an analog video capture card, but a good one is expensive 
and installing it means tearing apart your computer. Plus, Premiere Elements 
can’t capture video using an analog capture card, meaning you’ll have to use 
different software with your analog video capture card. 
A simpler solution may be to use an external video converter — usually a box 
that connects to your computer’s FireWire or USB 2.0 port. The box includes 
analog inputs so you can connect an analog VCR or camcorder to the box. 
The unit itself converts signals from analog media into DV-format video, 

320
Part V: The Part of Tens 
which is then captured into your computer — where you can easily edit it 
using Premiere Elements.
 
If you have worked with analog video a lot, you’re probably aware that each 
time you make a copy of the video some quality is lost. This is called genera-
tional loss (see Chapter 3 for more on this subject). Video converters like the 
ones described here don’t present any more of a generational-loss problem 
than a standard video capture card: After the signal is converted from analog 
to digital, generational loss is no longer a problem until you output the video 
back to an analog tape again.
Most converter boxes can also be useful for exporting video to an analog 
source. You simply export the DV-format video from Premiere Elements, and 
the converter box converts it into an analog signal that you can record on 
your analog tape deck. Among other advantages, this method of export saves 
a lot of wear and tear on the tape-drive mechanisms in your expensive digital 
camcorder. Features to look for in a video converter include
 
✓ Analog output
 
✓ Broadcast standard support (NTSC or PAL)
 
✓ Color-bar output
 
✓ Multiple FireWire and analog inputs/outputs
Video converters range in price anywhere from $20 to $300 or more. Visit 
your local consumer electronics store to see what’s available. I recommend 
products such as the ADS Movie Capture Xpress (about $50), Pinnacle Studio 
MovieBox (about $125), or the Canopus ADVC-55 (about $200). 
Multimedia Controllers
Manipulating some of the playback and editing controls in Premiere Elements 
with a mouse isn’t always easy. Sure, there are keyboard shortcuts for most 
actions, and you may find yourself using those keyboard shortcuts quite a 
bit. In particular, I find that controlling playback with the J, K, and L keys is 
a lot easier than using the mouse; and using the arrow keys to frame forward 
or back is vastly superior to clicking the Next Frame and Previous Frame but-
tons in the Monitor window.
Useful though the keyboard may be, an even better way is to control 
Premiere Elements with an external multimedia controller, such as the 
ShuttleXpress or ShuttlePRO v. 2 from Contour Design. The ShuttlePro, 
shown in Figure 19-1, costs about $100 and features 13 buttons and a 2-part 

321
 Chapter 19: Ten Essential Extras for Moviemaking
dial control in an ergonomically designed housing. The overall design of the 
ShuttlePro is based on professional video-editing controllers. The dials can 
be used to shuttle forward and back in your video, and the various buttons 
control various other program features. The unit plugs into a USB port, which 
can be found on virtually any modern computer. If you do a lot of video edit-
ing, you can save a lot of time and effort by using a multimedia controller. 
Find out more about multimedia controllers online at
www.contourdesign.com
 
A less expensive version of this controller, the ShuttleXpress, is also avail-
able from Contour Design. The ShuttleXpress is about half the price of the 
ShuttlePro and also works great.

Lights and Accessories
One of the biggest obstacles you encounter as you try to shoot better video 
is light. You need to shed enough light on your subjects so that they’re 
clearly visible, but you don’t want so much light that highlights get blown 
out. Modern camcorders have pretty good light sensitivity, but if you pay 
attention to the pros, you’ll notice that they usually set up additional lighting 
for their video shoots. (Check out Chapters 3 and 18 for video lighting tips.) 

322
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Professional light systems for photo and video work are ideal, but they’re 
also breathtakingly expensive. If your budget is tight, here are some more 
affordable lighting options: 
 
✓ Visit your local hardware store and buy some low-cost halogen shop 
lights. These throw a lot of light and usually come with adjustable 
stands or clips so they can be easily mounted to stationary objects.
 
✓ To diffuse or change the color of your light, place transparent or translu-
cent plastic sheets in front of your lights. Transparent sheets are called 
gels, and translucent sheets are called scrims. They can be purchased 
cheaply at better photo and video supply stores. Alternatively, use 
colored document protectors from your local office supply store. Use 
wooden clothespins to clip gels and scrims in place. 
 
 Check your gels and scrims frequently to make sure that they aren’t 
getting overheated by the lights. And most important, never leave your 
scene lighting turned on and unattended. Lights generate a lot of heat 
and can become a fire hazard. 
 
✓ Find out if your camcorder manufacturer offers an accessory light that 
mounts directly on your camera. If the camera-mounted light is so bright 
that your subjects squint and their faces turn to white glares, soften the 
light with a diffusing scrim. 
 
✓ For more-subtle lighting effects, bounce light off white or foil-covered 
poster board. Umbrella-style light reflectors can be purchased from 
photo supply stores for under $20. 
Tripods and Other Stabilization Devices
The need for image stabilization will probably become apparent the first time 
you watch your footage on a large TV screen. No matter how carefully you 
try to hold the camera, some movement is going to show up on the image. 
Of course, at times, a handheld shoot makes the most sense, but many other 
times, a totally stable image is best. To get that stability, you need a tripod.
Tripods are generally available for as low as $20 at your local department 
store. Alas, as with so many other things in life, when you buy a tripod you 
get what you pay for. High-quality video tripods incorporate several impor-
tant features:
 
✓ Stout, braced legs: Strong legs give the tripod its stability, especially 
during panning shots. Braces at the base or middle of the tripod’s legs 
enhance stability. Weaker tripods introduce subtle vibrations into the 
video image that perceptibly degrade your image quality. 

323
 Chapter 19: Ten Essential Extras for Moviemaking
 
✓ High-tech materials: You’ll soon get tired of lugging a 15- to 20-pound 
tripod around with your camera gear. Higher-quality tripods usually use 
high-tech materials (including titanium, aircraft-quality aluminum, and 
carbon fiber) that are both strong and lightweight, making the gear less 
cumbersome to transport and use.
 
✓ Bubble levels: Built-in bubble levels help you ensure that your camera 
is level, even if the ground underneath the tripod isn’t.
 
✓ Fluid heads: High-quality tripods have fluid heads to ensure that pans 
will be smooth and jerk-free.
 
✓ Counterweights: The best tripods have adjustable counterweights so 
the head can be balanced for your camera and lens (telephoto lenses, 
for example, can make the camera a bit front-heavy). Counterweights 
allow smooth use of the fluid head while still giving you the option of 
letting go of the camera without having it tilt out of position.
For a tripod with all these features, you can expect to spend a couple of hun-
dred dollars (if not many hundreds of dollars). If that kind of money isn’t in 
your tripod budget right now, try to get a tripod that incorporates as many 
of these features as possible. Budget at least $75 to $150 for an entry-level 
tripod that offers adequate vibration damping and a basic fluid head. 
Tripods aren’t the only stabilization devices available. You may also want to 
keep a monopod handy for certain occasions. As the name suggests, a mono-
pod has only one leg (just as tripods have three legs, octopods have eight, 
and . . . never mind). Although by definition (and by design) a monopod 
inevitably allows some camera movement — you have to keep the camera 
balanced on the monopod — you can still get more stability than you’d have 
if you simply hold the camera without any stabilization device. Some mono-
pods double as walking sticks. 
For moving shots, you may want to try a mobile stabilizer such as a Steadicam 
(www.steadicam.com). Devices like the Steadicam use a system of weights 
and harnesses to keep the camera remarkably stable even as the operator 
moves around a scene.
Mass Storage
In 1996, I spent $200 on a 1.6GB drive. It seemed massive at the time, but that 
drive would only hold about six or seven minutes of digital video if I were still 
using it. Today, $200 can buy 1,000 times as much storage space! And you’ll 
need it, because digital video gobbles hard drive space in a hurry. 

324
Part V: The Part of Tens 
As I mention in Chapter 2, you should use your computer’s internal hard 
drives for video editing. But for storage of completed projects, I recommend 
an external drive that connects to your computer’s FireWire or USB 2.0 port. 
Many are now available with capacities at or above 1TB (terabyte). One tera-
byte will hold about 75 hours of full-quality digital video. External hard drives 
improve your life in a couple of ways:
 
✓ By offloading large video files to an external drive for storage, you free 
up space on your internal drives. Internal drives perform better when 
they have lots of free space.
 
✓ Big video files can be easily transferred from one computer to another. 
Simply unplug the external drive from one computer and plug it into 
another!
 
Hard drives are not reliable long-term storage devices. I recommend that you 
back up your video on multiple DVDs. If your camcorder uses MiniDV tapes, 
don’t reuse the tapes; instead, archive them to preserve your original taped 
source footage. 
Helmet Cams
Would you like to give your audience a first-person perspective of the action? 
You can capture some interesting shots with a mini-camera small enough to 
be mounted on a helmet, a remote-control car, or any other moving object. 
The term “helmet cam” comes from videographers who mount these tiny 
cameras to their helmets and then go for a heart-pumping ride on a motorcy-
cle, bicycle, snowboard, shopping cart, or any other form of extreme-sports 
conveyance. 
Helmet cams have been available for a while, but most older designs used 
analog video connections that had to be connected to a camcorder for 
recording. Unfortunately, many digital camcorders no longer have analog 
inputs, so the older style helmet cams might not work for you. 
Instead, look for a self-contained camera that records VGA-quality or better 
video onto internal flash memory. Such cameras are available for under $200 
from companies such as GoPro and Oregon Scientific. The video quality 
won’t be high-def, but if you make the action exciting enough your audience 
won’t care!

325
 Chapter 19: Ten Essential Extras for Moviemaking
 
If you want better video quality you may need to step up to a more expensive 
wired-cam that connects to a camcorder. Just make sure that the camera you 
want is compatible with your specific camcorder. Helmet cam manufacturers 
usually provide camcorder compatibility lists on their Web sites. 
Web Space
The Internet seems like a natural place to share your movies with others, 
but video files are often very big, and that means problems if you’re trying 
to find an online home for your movies. Video sharing sites like YouTube are 
often the best solution, but if you want to avoid all the advertising banners 
and random links to other peoples’ videos, you may want to get Web space of 
your own. 
Many low-cost Web hosting options are now available. For example, as of this 
writing, GoDaddy.com (www.godaddy.com) offers a Web hosting plan which 
provides 150GB of Web server space and 1,500GB of monthly data transfer 
for under $7 per month. This type of account offers enough space and band-
width to support typical online movie hosting for personal use. The down-
side is that with many Web hosting services you have to know how to create, 
upload, and maintain Web pages.
When looking for online Web space, consider the following features:
 
✓ Storage space: Get a lot more space than you think you’ll need. 10GB 
may sound like a lot, but if you get serious about online video sharing 
you can gobble that space up surprisingly fast.
 
✓ Bandwidth: Usually listed as “monthly data transfer,” the bandwidth is 
just as important as the total space. If you put a 50MB movie online and 
it is downloaded by ten people, those downloads will use up 500MB of 
bandwidth. Make sure that you have more than enough monthly band-
width, and read the fine print to find out whether and how you will be 
charged for exceeding your monthly bandwidth allotment (believe me — 
you will be charged). While you’re reading that fine print, see if there are 
daily bandwidth limits as well as monthly limits.
 
✓ Cost: Some Web sites offer free storage space, but these so-called “free” 
sites also usually also require visitors to view annoying ads and pop-up 
windows. Pay sites usually don’t have ads or pop-ups, because you have 
to, um, pay for the site. Review the plan details carefully to make sure 

326
Part V: The Part of Tens 
that your pay plan doesn’t also subject users to pop-up windows and 
ads. If the site charges setup fees or lots of other obscure service fees, 
consider looking elsewhere because lots of choices are available. 
 
✓ Reliability: Is the site reliable? Will you be stuck with hidden charges? 
Will the site fold in a few days or weeks? Talk to friends about Web host-
ing services they use, and check Web sites such as www.tophosts.
com or www.findmyhosting.com for consumer reviews and feature-by-
feature comparisons of various Web hosting services.
 
✓ Extras: Does the service include extra e-mail addresses or affordable 
domain name registration? Can you upload movie files using a simple 
Web browser page, or will you have to figure out how to use FTP soft-
ware and other Internet technologies?

Glossary
analog: Technology that records data as waves with infinitely varying values. 
Analog recordings are usually electromechanical, so they often suffer from 
generational loss. See also digital, generational loss.
aperture: The size of the opening behind a camera lens. Like the iris in a 
human eye, a large aperture lets in more light and a small aperture lets in less 
light. The aperture’s size is expressed as an F-number, with lower numbers 
like f1.8 indicating a large aperture opening and higher aperture numbers like 
f16 indicating a small aperture opening. See also depth of field.
aspect ratio: The shape of a video image as determined by its width com-
pared to height. Older TV screens had an aspect ratio of 4:3, meaning that 
the screen is four units wide and three units high. Most HDTVs use a “wide-
screen” aspect ratio of 16:9. Image pixels can also have various aspect ratios. 
See also HDTV, pixel.
ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee): The digital broadcast-
video standard used in North America. See also DVB, NTSC, PAL, SECAM.
AVCHD (Advanced Video Codec High Definition): The recording format of 
high definition camcorders that record video onto hard drives, flash memory, 
or DVDs. See also DV, HDV, MiniDV.
bars and tone: A video image that serves the function of the “test pattern” 
used in TV broadcasting: Standardized color bars and a 1-kHz tone are 
usually placed at the beginning of movie projects. The test pattern helps 
broadcast engineers calibrate video equipment. The format for color bars is 
standardized by the SMPTE. Adobe Premiere Elements can generate bars and 
tone. See also SMPTE.
bit depth: A unit of measurement for color and sound quality. The amount of 
data that a single piece of information can hold depends upon how many bits 
are available. Bit depth usually measures color or sound quality. A larger bit-
depth number means a greater range of color or sound.
Blu-Ray: A high-definition optical storage disc that is the same size and shape 
as a standard DVD. Blu-Ray won the high-def format war to become the de 
facto standard for high-definition movie distribution. See also DVD, HD DVD.

capture: The process of recording digital video or other media from a cam-
corder or VCR tape onto a computer’s hard drive.
CCD (charged-coupled device): The unit in many camcorders that interprets 
light photons and converts the information into an electronic video signal. 
CCDs are also used by digital still cameras. See also CMOS.
chrominance: A fancy word for color. See also luminance.
clip: One of various segments making up the scenes of a video project. You 
edit individual clips into the Premiere Elements Timeline to form complete 
scenes and a complete story line. See also timeline.
CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor): The unit in some newer 
camcorders that interprets light photons and converts the information into 
an electronic video signal. CMOS sensors are also used by some digital still 
cameras. See also CCD.
coaxial: Cables used to carry a cable TV signal. Coaxial connectors are round 
and have a single thin pin in the middle of the connector. Coaxial cables 
carry both sound and video. Although most TVs and VCRs have coaxial con-
nectors, digital camcorders usually do not. Coaxial cables usually provide 
inferior video quality when compared to component, composite, HDMI, and 
S-Video cables. See also component video, composite video, HDMI, S-Video.
codec: A scheme used to compress, and later decompress, video and audio 
information so that it can be passed more efficiently over computer cables 
and Internet connections to hard drives and other components.
color gamut: The total range of colors a given system can create (by com-
bining several basic colors) to display a video image. The total number of 
individual colors that are available is finite. If a color cannot be displayed 
correctly, it is considered out of gamut.
color space: The method used to generate color in a video display. See also 
color gamut, RGB, YUV.
component video: A high-quality connection for analog and digital video. 
Component video splits the video signal over three separate cables, color-
coded red, green, and blue. Component video provides superior video qual-
ity to coaxial, composite, and S-Video connections, but is inferior to HDMI. 
Component video can carry high-definition video signals. See also analog, 
coaxial, composite video, HDMI, S-Video.
composite video: A connection for analog video, typically using a single 
video connector cable (color-coded yellow). The connector type is some-
times called an RCA connector, and is often paired with audio cables that

 Glossary
have red and white connectors. Composite video is inferior to S-Video, HDMI, 
and component video because they tend to allow more signal noise and 
image artifacts. See also analog, coaxial, component video, HDMI, S-Video.
DAT (digital audio tape): A digital tape format often used in audio recorders 
by professional video producers.
data rate: The amount of data that can pass over a connection in a second. 
The data rate of DV-format video is 3.6MB (megabytes) per second. High-
definition video data rates can vary from 2.4MB to 3.6MB per second.
depth of field: The range of a video image that is in focus. With a broad 
depth of field, much of the video image is in focus. A shallow depth of field 
means the subject is in focus and the background is blurry. Smaller lens aper-
tures give broader depth of field. See also aperture, shutter speed.
device control: A technology that allows a computer to control the play-
back functions on a digital camcorder (such as play, stop, and rewind). For 
example, clicking Rewind in the program window on the computer causes the 
camcorder tape to actually rewind.
digital: A method of recording sound and light as data made up of discrete, 
binary values (expressed as ones and zeros). See also analog.
Digital8: A standard definition digital camcorder format that uses Hi-8 tapes. 
See also digital, DV, MicroMV, MiniDV.
driver: Pre-1980, the person in control of a car or horse-drawn carriage. Post-
1980, a piece of software that allows a computer to use a piece of hardware, 
such as a video card or a printer.
drop-frame timecode: A type of timecode specified by the NTSC video stan-
dard, usually with a frame rate of 29.97 fps (frames per second). To maintain 
continuity, two frames are dropped at the beginning of each minute, except 
for every tenth minute. See also timecode.
DV (Digital Video): A standard format and codec for digital video. Digital 
camcorders that include a FireWire interface usually record DV-format video. 
See also codec, FireWire, HDV.
DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting): The digital broadcast-video standard 
used in most of the world except North America. See also ATSC, NTSC, PAL, 
SECAM.
DVCAM: A professional-grade version of the MiniDV digital-tape format devel-
oped by Sony. DVCAM camcorders are usually pretty expensive. See also 
digital, DVCPro, MiniDV.

DVCPro: A professional-grade version of the MiniDV digital-tape format 
developed by Panasonic. Like DVCAM camcorders, DVCPro camcorders are 
usually expensive. See also digital, DVCAM, MiniDV.
DVD (Digital Versatile Disc): A category of optical disc that allows capaci-
ties from 4.7GB (gigabytes) up to 17GB. Virtually all modern computers 
can record single-layer (4.7GB) DVDs, and many can also record dual-layer 
(8.5GB) DVDs.
field: One of two sets of scan lines in an interlaced video frame. Each field 
contains every other horizontal resolution line. Immediately after one field 
is drawn on the screen, the other is drawn in a separate pass, resulting in a 
complete image. See also frame, interlacing.
FireWire: Also known by its official designation IEEE-1394, or by other names 
such as i.Link, FireWire is a high-speed computer peripheral interface stan-
dard developed by Apple Computer. FireWire is often used to connect digital 
camcorders, external hard drives, and other devices to a computer. FireWire 
has contributed greatly to the affordability of modern video editing.
frame: A single still image in a sequence of many that make up a moving pic-
ture. See also frame rate.
frame rate: The speed at which the frames in a moving picture change, mea-
sured in frames per second (fps). Video images usually display 25 to 30 fps, 
providing the illusion of movement to the human eye. Slower frame rates 
save storage space, but can produce jerky motion; faster frame rates produce 
smoother motion but use up more storage space.
gamut: See color gamut.
gel: A translucent or colored sheet that is placed in front of a light to diffuse 
the light or otherwise change its appearance. See also scrim.
generational loss: A decrease in the quality of an analog recording with every 
generation (copy) of the recording that is made. Each copy (especially if it’s 
a copy of a copy) represents a later, lower-quality generation of the original. 
See also analog.
grayscale: The proper name of a black-and-white picture or video image. 
Black-and-white images are actually made up of varying shades of gray.
HD DVD (High Definition DVD): A high-definition optical storage disc that 
was a competing format to Blu-Ray, but Blu-Ray eventually won industry sup-
port. See also Blu-Ray, DVD.

331
 Glossary
HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface): A digital interface technology 
used by many high-definition TVs, disc players, and cameras. HDMI provides 
the best quality connection between high-definition devices. See also coaxial, 
component video, composite video, FireWire, S-Video.
HDTV (High Definition Television): A set of broadcast-video standards that 
incorporates resolutions and frame rates higher than those used for tradi-
tional analog video. HDTV usually offers 720 or 1,080 horizontal lines of reso-
lution. See also NTSC, PAL, SECAM.
HDV (High Definition Video): The recording format of high-definition cam-
corders that record video onto tapes. Most HDV camcorders use MiniDV 
tapes. See also AVCHD, DV, MiniDV. 
IEEE-1394: See FireWire.
i.Link: See FireWire.
interlacing: The production of an image by alternating sets of scan lines 
on-screen. Most video images are actually composed of two separate fields, 
drawn on consecutive passes. Each field contains every other horizontal res-
olution line of a video image. Each field is drawn so quickly that the human 
eye perceives a complete image. See also field, progressive scan.
jog: See scrub.
lavalier: A tiny microphone designed to clip to a subject’s clothing. Lavalier 
mics are often clipped to the lapels of TV newscasters.
luminance: A fancy word for brightness in video images. See also 
chrominance.
MicroMV: A short-lived digital camcorder tape format developed by Sony for 
ultra-compact camcorders. See also digital, Digital8, DV, MiniDV.
MiniDV: The most common tape format used by tape-based standard and 
high-definition digital camcorders. See also digital, Digital8, DV, MicroMV.
moiré pattern: A wavy or shimmering artifact that appears in video images 
when tight parallel lines appear in the image. This problem often occurs 
when a subject wears a pinstriped suit or coarse corduroy.
NLE (nonlinear editor): A computer program that can edit video, audio, or 
other multimedia without confining the user to an unchangeable sequence 
of frames from beginning to end. NLEs let you edit the work in any order you 
choose. Adobe Premiere Elements is one example of a video NLE program.

NTSC (National Television Standards Committee): The analog broadcast-
video standard used in North America, Japan, the Philippines, and elsewhere. 
See also ATSC, DVB, PAL, SECAM.
overscan: What happens when a TV cuts off portions of the video image at 
the edges of the screen. Most standard TVs overscan to some extent.
PAL (Phase Alternating Line): An analog broadcast-video standard used in 
Europe, Australia, Southeast Asia, South America, and elsewhere. See also 
ATSC, DVB, NTSC, SECAM.
pixel: The smallest element of a video image, abbreviated from picture ele-
ment. Still images are usually made up of grids containing thousands, even 
millions, of pixels. A screen or image size that has a resolution of 640 x 480 is 
640 pixels wide by 480 pixels high.
progressive scan: A scan display that draws all the horizontal resolution 
lines in a single pass. Most computer monitors use progressive scan displays. 
See also interlacing.
render: To produce a playable version of an altered video image. When you 
apply an effect or other change to a video image, Premiere Elements figures 
out how each frame should look after the change. The rendering process 
applies these changes. Usually, the rendering process generates a preview 
file that is stored on the hard drive. See also transition.
RGB (red-green-blue): The color space (method of creating on-screen colors) 
used by computer monitors; all the available colors result from combining 
red, green, and blue pixels. See also color space, YUV.
sampling rate: The number of samples obtained per second during a digital 
audio recording. When audio is recorded digitally, the sound is sampled 
thousands of times per second. 48-kHz audio has 48,000 samples per second.
scrim: A semitransparent or opaque screen that is placed in front of studio 
lights to dim or diffuse the light. See also gel.
scrub: To move back and forth through a video project, one frame at a time. 
Some video-editing programs have a scrub bar located underneath the video 
preview window (also called the jog control). See also shuttle.
SECAM (Sequential Couleur Avec Memoire): An analog broadcast-video 
standard used in France, Russia, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and elsewhere. 
See also ATSC, DVB, NTSC, PAL.
shutter speed: The length of time (expressed in fractions of a second) that 
the camera’s image sensor is exposed to light. A shutter speed of 100 means 
that light is gathered for 1/100th of a second. See also aperture.

333
 Glossary
shuttle: To roll video images slowly forward or back, often to check a detail 
of motion. Professional video decks and cameras often have shuttle controls. 
Some video-editing programs also have shuttle controls. See also scrub.
slate: The black-and-white hinged board that moviemakers snap closed in 
front of the camera just before action commences. The snapping noise helps 
synchronize video and audio recordings made by separate machines.
SMPTE (Society for Motion Picture and Television Engineers): The organiza-
tion that develops standards for professional broadcasting equipment and 
formats. Among other things, the SMPTE defines standards for bars and tone, 
counting leaders, and timecode.
standard definition: Non-high-definition digital video. Standard-definition 
digital video usually has 480 horizontal lines of resolution. See also HDTV.
S-VHS: A higher-quality version of the VHS videotape format. 
S-Video: A high-quality connection technology for analog video. S-Video con-
nectors separate the color and brightness signals, resulting in less signal 
noise and fewer artifacts. Some digital camcorders include S-Video connec-
tors for analog output. Analog capture cards and S-VHS VCRs usually have 
S-Video connectors as well. See also analog, capture, coaxial, composite 
video, component video, HDMI, S-VHS.
timecode: The standard system for identifying individual frames in a movie or 
video project. Timecode is expressed as hours:minutes:seconds:frames 
(as in 01:20:31:02) or 1 hour, 20 minutes, 31 seconds, and 3 frames. This 
format has been standardized by the SMPTE. Non-drop-frame timecode uses 
colons between the numbers; drop-frame timecode uses semicolons. See also 
drop-frame timecode, SMPTE, timecode break.
timecode break: An inconsistency in the timecode on a camcorder tape. See 
also timecode.
timeline: The working space in most video-editing programs, including 
Adobe Premiere Elements. Clips are arranged along a line that represents 
the duration of the movie project. The left side of the timeline represents the 
beginning of the movie, and the right side represents the ending. The timeline 
may include multiple video tracks, multiple audio tracks, transitions, effects, 
titles, and other features. See also clip.
title: Text that appears on-screen to display the name of the movie or give 
credit to the movie crew. A subtitle is a special type of title, often used to 
show translations of dialogue spoken in foreign languages.
transition: The method by which one clip ends and another begins in a movie 
project. A common type of transition is when one clip gradually fades out as 
the next clip fades in. See also clip, render.

USB (Universal Serial Bus): A computer-port technology that makes it easy 
to connect a mouse, printer, or other computer peripheral. Some digital cam-
corders have USB ports. Connected to a computer’s USB port, these cameras 
can often be used as Web cams. Most computers built after Spring 2002 use 
a faster version of USB called USB 2.0. Adobe Premiere Elements cannot cap-
ture video from a tape-based camcorder that is connected to a USB port, but 
it can use USB to download video from most tapeless camcorders.
video card: This term can refer to either of two different kinds of devices 
inside a computer: The device that generates a video signal for the com-
puter’s monitor; or the card that captures video from VCRs and camcord-
ers onto the computer’s hard drive. Some hardware manufacturers refer to 
FireWire cards as video cards because FireWire cards are most often used to 
capture video from digital camcorders. See also capture, FireWire.
waveform: A visual representation of an audio signal. Viewing a waveform on 
a computer screen allows precise synchronization of sound and video.
YCbCr: An alternative acronym for the YUV color space. See also YUV.
YUV: The acronym for the color space used by most TVs and digital cam-
corders. For some obscure reason, YUV stands for luminance-chrominance. 
See also chrominance, color space, luminance, RGB.
zebra pattern: An overexposure warning feature found in some high-end 
camcorders. A striped pattern appears in the viewfinder over image areas 
that will be overexposed unless the camcorder is adjusted to compensate.
