Introduction
Joseph W. Matiko and Stephen P. Beeby
1.1  Background and Motivation
Energy harvesting refers to the conversion of ambient energy that is present in 
the environment into electrical energy to provide a power supply typically for 
autonomous wireless systems. Energy harvesting will become a key technol­
ogy underpinning the Internet of Things (IoT) where the supply of power to 
distributed devices is a significant challenge. Energy harvesting, also known 
as power harvesting or energy scavenging, is identical in concept to renewable 
energy generation for high-power electrical grid applications. The pressure to 
reduce carbon emissions has seen a proliferation in renewable energy sources 
across the globe, be it large-scale solar farms or wind turbines. The key differ­
ence to renewable systems is the scale of power delivered and the environments 
in which they are situated. Renewable energy generation supplies gigawatts of 
power and the solar panels and turbines are typically located at the optimum 
position to capture the maximum amount of energy (e.g., offshore wind tur­
bines). The challenges associated with renewable energy sources are largely lo­
gistical and economic. Large amounts of power need to be distributed over large 
distances, often in harsh environments, and the network as a whole has to be 
able to deal with periodic fluctuations in energy supply due to ambient weather 
conditions. 
Energy harvesting is concerned with small-scale energy supply, typically 
of the order of microwatts or milliwatts, that is sufficient to power small auton­
omous sensor systems. These autonomous systems are miniature, stand-alone 
electronics systems that may perform a wide variety of operations depending 
upon the application. The simplest example is a wireless sensing node that 

2 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
monitors its surroundings and may provide an input into a larger system or net­
work. Given the additional functionality of the autonomous system, its location 
may be governed by, for example, the requirements of the sensor rather than the 
ambient energy available to power itself. The inherent small size of the autono­
mous system will also place size and form constraints on the energy harvester, 
and this, in turn, affects the amount of electrical energy that can be generated. 
The autonomous system will then have to deal with the periodic nature of the 
power supply that varies depending upon the availability of the ambient energy 
source. Therefore, the energy harvester itself becomes just one component in a 
power supply system that typically includes power management circuitry and 
energy storage. 
A mature commercial example of the technology is provided by Perpe­
tuum Ltd., which has developed wireless sensors for industrial condition moni­
toring and rail applications. In both cases, the Perpetuum vibration energy har­
vester converts the vibrations of the equipment or train wheels into electrical 
energy, which is stored and then periodically used to monitor the vibrations 
of the machine or wheel bearings (see Figure 1.1). This is an elegant solution, 
the very vibrations measured to determine the condition of the machinery can 
be used to power the sensors performing the measurement. In both cases, the 
energy harvesting part is the key technology that enables a retrofitted, mainte­
nance-free wireless sensor solution that can be installed in a just a few minutes.
This book is concerned with the application of energy harvesting in 
buildings. There is a range of different energy sources within any typical indoor 
environment. Solar energy (light), thermal energy (heat), and kinetic energy

bration and temperature sensors, microprocessor and wireless transmitter (see http://www.

Introduction

(motion) are three examples that we can envisage as possible sources for har­
vesting electrical energy from a typical indoor environment. There is also the 
potential to harvest energy from ambient radio waves that we are all surrounded 
by in any typical urban environment. Whatever the energy source, it is unlikely 
to be consistent and may well vary depending upon the specific location and 
the time of day. In each case, key technical questions need to be addressed and 
the answers to these define the challenge for that particular application. The 
first question is availability of supply. Is the source always available? Does it 
vary in intensity? Can multiple energy sources be harvested? The next question 
is economic. Is it a cost-effective solution or could a battery be used? When 
considering the economic angle, the ongoing maintenance cost of battery solu­
tions needs to be compared against the likely higher capital cost of the energy-
harvesting solution. Finally, we have practicalities such as the size constraints 
for the harvester and system that it is powering. Given the size constraints and 
energy sources available, can the harvester deliver sufficient energy to meet the 
requirements of the load electronics to be powered? Given the likely variability 
in supply, does the application allow the load electronics to operate flexibly and 
accommodate variations? Does the harvesting process affect the energy source?
We have mentioned batteries and this remains the “elephant in the room” 
(an idiom for an obvious truth that is going unaddressed). That is, why can’t 
we just use batteries for everything? Batteries have many advantages. They are 
relatively convenient to use and are low-cost, self-contained energy supplies 
with reasonable energy densities. Batteries can be primary (single use) or sec­
ondary (rechargeable; these could be used with an energy harvester to provide 
an energy storage solution). Primary batteries offer higher energy densities than 
secondary, but their supply of energy is finite and they will need replacing. The 
drawbacks are therefore associated with additional maintenance and cost bur­
den presented by the need to change batteries, not to mention the environmen­
tal consequences of their disposal. In large-scale distributed deployments with 
many autonomous electronic nodes, it can be prohibitively expensive to replace 
batteries. The need to be able to access the node to be able to change the battery 
can also limit its position. Batteries are not suitable for embedded or inacces­
sible locations and this may mean the sensor node cannot be positioned in the 
best place. One example case study to which we can point is battery-powered, 
data-logging equipment used across the gas distribution network in the United 
Kingdom. These are found inside equipment cabinets across the network, in 
some cases in remote locations, and are exposed to a wide range of temperatures 
that leads to batteries tending to fail en masse in winter. This is an additional 
maintenance burden at a time when the network is at its busiest and is a real 
inconvenience. The specialist batteries themselves are $64 (£50) and the cost of 
replacement exceeds this.

Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
Energy harvesting in buildings is of interest because it can provide a long-
term “fix-and-forget” power supply for applications in buildings and negate the 
need for batteries entirely. However, buildings are not short of power. Surely, 
the mains electrical wiring can be used? Again, this is application-dependent. 
The cost and disruption of accessing the mains circuits in buildings can be pro­
hibitive and the presence of cables and wires can be unsightly, unsafe, and very 
expensive. Wireless systems that may be simply retrofitted are highly attractive.
1.2  Home and Building Automation 
Home and building automation is a growing industry and has several facets. 
Building automation systems (BAS), also called building management systems 
(BMS), use a combination of sensors, controllers, and actuators to automati­
cally monitor and control the environment within the building. Such systems 
can be used to control the lighting, heating, ventilation, and air condition­
ing (HVAC), security and access, fire alarm systems, central plant (e.g., wa­
ter and electrical systems), and, in dwellings, home entertainment systems and 
appliances. 
The motivation for using BAS is largely economical, as they can optimize 
the control of centralized systems and monitor energy consumption, natural­
ly with the objective of reducing energy use. A simple example of this is the 
monitoring of room occupancy and automatically turning lights and heating or 
air conditioning off. Other benefits include improved control of the building 
environment leading to a more comfortable environment with the opportu­
nity for providing a more personalized individual room control. In addition to 
cost savings by reducing energy consumption, improved user comfort also af­
fects staff performance and behavior. It has been shown that improved comfort 
can increase productivity and reduce absenteeism [1]. BAS can also be used to 
monitor the condition of building equipment and infrastructure leading to im­
proved reliability and efficiency and reduced maintenance costs. Such buildings 
provide more attractive accommodation commanding higher rentals and also 
provide the opportunity for flexible billing of tenants based on more accurate 
data regarding use of facilities. Security and fire alarm systems can improve 
the response to alerts, reduce false alarms, reduce personnel costs, and improve 
safety.
The global energy consumption of buildings (residential and commercial) 
accounts for between 20% and 40% of total energy consumption in developed 
countries and HVAC systems in the United States account for 50% of building 
consumption and 20% of total consumption [2]. Government policies around 
the world are being developed to reduce consumption and improve energy ef­
ficiency in buildings. In the European Union, for example, it is a statutory 

 
Introduction 
5
requirement for all buildings (homes and commercial and public buildings) to 
have sand energy performance certificate when built, sold, or rented [3]. BAS 
are recommended by organizations such as the Carbon Trust as a method for 
reducing the energy consumption of buildings. Just as low-power lighting such 
as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has already reduced energy consumption in 
buildings, BAS will play an important role in further reducing energy use in all 
aspects of the operation of a building.
Central to the BAS are the capturing of data and monitoring of the en­
vironment, which involve a variety of sensors. Example sensors include tem­
perature (internal and external), humidity, illumination level, electrical load 
monitoring, occupancy detection, gas sensors (e.g., carbon monoxide), smoke 
detectors, vibration sensors (for condition monitoring plant equipment), and 
door or window position. These sensors are connected to the BMS controllers 
and other input/output devices by an appropriate bus that includes all physi­
cal connections (wires, optical fiber, and so forth), communications protocols, 
and associated software. A range of protocols exist in the BMS sector including 
BACnet, KNX, LonWorks, and Modbus. Typical commercial systems enable 
interoperability, which allows devices from different manufacturers to be used 
and combined. 
1.2.1  Wireless BAS
This book is concerned with energy harvesting, which implies that connec­
tion between devices must be wireless. The main factors to be considered when 
choosing the type of BAS (wired or wireless) are usually cost and capability. In­
stallation costs in both instances comprise parts and labor, which are influenced 
by the size of the project. Wired system components are generally cheaper than 
wireless, but installation costs are much higher. Wireless systems are simpler to 
install with no cabling costs and much less labor required. One receiver mod­
ule can operate with numerous wireless sensors, and this is typically the most 
cost-effective solution for installations with four or more sensors. For example, 
a modest BAS including 12 wireless sensors would cost approximately 50% 
less than a wired system [4]. Even ignoring cost advantages, wireless solutions 
can typically complete with wired solutions in performance. Wireless sensors 
are connected in a network using various communication standards such as 
ZigBee, 6LoWPAN, Wi-Fi, WirelessHART, EnOcean, and ISA100.11a. These 
networks provide flexibility and redundancy enabling signal transmission even 
if nodes start to fail. The plug-and-play capability enables wireless solutions to 
be easily expanded and upgraded. The only case when wired systems become 
the favored option is when signal integrity is essential. 
It is clear that wireless sensors are attractive for the reasons given above 
(i.e., ease of retrofitting and flexibility in locating the devices). Such devices can 

6 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
be placed in inaccessible locations such as inside HVAC air ducts, but in such 
locations it becomes very difficult to change a battery, hence the motivation for 
energy harvesting. ����������������������������������������������������������
Wireless sensors for BAS are widely available and some al­
ready incorporate the energy-harvesting capability to provide power. Examples 
of wireless sensors for BAS include temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, elec­
trical current, light, occupancy, and position (e.g., windows being open). 
Despite the advantages of wireless systems, the limitations of battery pow­
er are obvious and commercial self-powered devices powered by energy har­
vesting do exist. The company at the forefront of this is EnOcean, which was 
spun-off from Siemens AG in 2001. EnOcean harvests energy from motion 
(from the press of a switch), light, temperature, and electrical current in wires 
via a clamp to power wireless sensors for building applications. The company 
supported the IEC/ISO standards organization to create the IEC/ISO 14543-
3-10/11 wireless communications standards using the 868-MHz (Europe), 
902-MHz (United States and Canada) and 928-MHz (Japan) frequency bands 
to cover worldwide applications. The EnOcean Alliance was formed in 2008 
by building sector companies employing the EnOcean wireless standards. The 
full range of products available from members of the EnOcean Alliance can be 
found at the Alliance Web site [5] (Figure 1.2). The list is dominated by wireless 
network-related products employing the EnOcean wireless standard and the 
wireless light switch that is powered by the motion of the rocker switch when 
pressed by the user.
1.2.2  Wireless Home Automation 
Wireless systems for home automation are naturally similar to those for com­
mercial BAS (e.g., heating and lighting control), but there are some additional 
applications that should be noted. Wireless operation can greatly simplify the 
installation of home security systems, for example, and numerous commercial 
systems exist. Typically these are a combination of wireless battery-powered sen­
sors for motion detection and window or door position, with wired installation 
being required for higher-power sensors and devices such as cameras and sirens. 
Again, battery-powered, wireless sensors for monitoring air quality are avail­
able. These include carbon monoxide, volatile organic components (VOCs) 
and carbon dioxide. Even pathogens in the air such as E. coli can now be de­
tected by the Nuwave LU45 wireless pathogen sensor, although the power con­
sumption of the “wireless” device (1A at 12V equaling 12W) makes battery 
power impractical. Wireless technology is also used to interconnect multiroom 
entertainment systems and stream media around the home, but battery-pow­
ered components are limited to Bluetooth speakers that are smaller and less 
powerful than the mains powered equivalents.

1.3  The Scope of the Book
This book is concerned with the applications of energy harvesting in buildings 
and will explore in detail energy sources that are available and potential ap­
plications that could exploit these energy sources. Methods for capturing and 
converting these energy sources will be described along with estimates of the 
amount of energy that can be harvested from each source within a typical built 
environment. The book discusses various case studies in more detail to demon­
strate the potential of energy harvesting in the built environment. The future 
of energy harvesting in applications such as smart homes and IoT will finally 
conclude the book.
This intended readership of the book is graduate researchers and practic­
ing engineers and scientists interested in energy harvesting and BAS. Wherever 
possible, we have assumed that the reader has no detailed specialist knowledge 
of the field, but does have an appropriate technical background to follow the 
core underlying engineering and scientific principles. In view of this, the book 
will also be suitable for senior undergraduates and graduate-level students who 
wish to gain insight into the multidisciplinary and cross-disciplinary area of 
energy-harvesting systems and their application in buildings. 
This topic is rapidly evolving and it can be difficult to ensure that the con­
tent of the book is up-to-date at the time of publication. For the latest advances 
within the field, the interested reader is advised to review the literature, includ­
ing the following journals and conferences that now include energy harvesting 
and wireless sensor networks in building applications.

Energy Harvesting in the Built 
Environments
Joseph W. Matiko, Neil Grabham, Stephen Beeby, and John Tudor
2.1  Introduction
Energy harvesting is the conversion of ambient energy present in the environ­
ment into electrical energy [1, 2]. In the literature, the term “energy scaveng­
ing” is also used with the same meaning. Typically, energy harvesting relates to 
the conversion of small amounts of ambient energy for use in powering small, 
low-power, electronic devices. Ambient energy sources present in a building, 
and suitable for harvesting, may be: light, heat, vibration, movement, radio 
waves, electromagnetic fields, and airflow. In most cases, the energy that is har­
vested is wasted energy with no specific use [3]. 
Energy harvesting has attracted much interest in the research community 
because of its potential use as a power supply for low-power wireless sensor 
networks [4] and low-power electronic systems. These low-power electronic 
systems are ubiquitously used in built environments for applications such as 
the Internet of things (IoT), home automation, building management systems, 
ambient assistive living, and wearable devices. As these technologies are adopted 
both in existing buildings and in new residential and commercial buildings, the 
use of wireless sensors is increasing and is expected to increase further in the 
future. 
Wireless sensors can be powered from the mains if it is available in loca­
tions where sensors need to be installed. However, if the mains is not available, 

12 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
then extra cost may be incurred to extend the mains to the sensors’ location. 
This also reduces the freedom of deploying sensor nodes in preferred locations 
in built environment and defeats the purpose of wireless communication. Be­
cause of this, some wireless sensors are powered by batteries. For some applica­
tions, batteries could be a good power source; nevertheless, for some applica­
tions, particularly those applications that require high transmission duty cycles, 
batteries may require regular replacement and hence may not be an ideal choice. 
Therefore, there are several reasons why energy harvesting can be considered, to 
augment, or as an alternative to, a battery. One of these reasons is to reduce the 
maintenance costs and time necessary for battery replacement ���������������
[5, 6]���������
. In com­
mercial buildings, thousands or even ten thousands (and in exceptional cases 
hundreds of thousands) of electronic devices are already being deployed for 
various applications. Similarly, in smart homes and residential building, tens or 
hundreds of electronic devices are being deployed. Therefore, it will be increas­
ingly more expensive and time-consuming to regularly replace depleted batter­
ies as the number of these devices increases. Another reason is to overcome the 
problems related to the lifespan of the device that may be limited by the lifespan 
of battery. For devices in which it is difficult or impossible to replace batteries 
(e.g., implanted sensors on assisted people), device lifespans are limited by the 
lifetime of the batteries. By using energy harvesting, the lifespan of these de­
vices can be prolonged. The final reason is related to keeping our environments 
green, increasing usage of batteries will raise concerns on how to carefully dis­
pose of and recycle depleted batteries without causing detrimental effects to the 
environment. Batteries contain toxic metals such as mercury, cadmium, lead, 
nickel, zinc, and lithium, which have detrimental effects to the environment 
and to the human body [7] if not carefully handled, and various studies have 
already indicated that some countries are not handling battery recycling care­
fully and this has led to negative effects for both people and environments [8].
An alternative to batteries for wireless sensors can be achieved by using 
energy-harvesting technologies to power them. Therefore, energy-harvesting 
technology has a potential application in this area, either to replace batteries 
or to prolong the life of rechargeable batteries. In this chapter, suitable energy-
harvesting sources for powering sensors in the built environment are discussed. 
This includes surveying available energy harvesting sources and the amount of 
energy that can be harvested from these sources and then quantifying the over­
all amount of energy that can be obtained in the built environment for power­
ing wireless sensors for various applications. Finally, the chapter covers energy 
sources available from the human body suitable for powering wearable devices. 
This is because built sensors will increasingly interact with wearable sensors to 
provide access to distributed mobile sensor platforms and these have the same 
constraints and challenges with regard to energy.

2.2  Energy-Harvesting Sources in Built Environments
In this section, various energy-harvesting sources available in the built environ­
ment are discussed. Also, the state of the art of energy harvesters reported in the 
literature is given.
2.2.1  Energy Harvesting from Light Sources
Photovoltaic energy harvesting obtains electrical energy from ambient light, 
either from natural sunlight or artificial light, using solar cells which are also 
known as photovoltaic cells. Photovoltaic energy harvesting is the most com­
mon method of harvesting energy [9] and is now a well-established technology. 
The amount of energy harvested depends on the intensity and spectral content 
of the light falling on the surface of the solar cell, the incident angle of the light, 
and the size, sensitivity, temperature, and type of solar cells used.
There are two categories of solar cells available in the market: solar cells 
specifically designed to harvest electrical energy from indoor light and those 
designed for harvesting electrical energy from the outdoor environment. To 
compare the relative performance of indoor and outdoor specification solar 
cells, nominal power densities, provided by the manufacturer, are given in Ta­
ble 2.1 for a typical indoor specification solar cell (SCHOTT Solar ASI OEM 
Indoor [10]) and a typical outdoor specification solar cell (SCHOTT Solar ASI 
OEM Outdoor [11]) under a range of illumination conditions. The 125,000 
lux natural sunlight figures are for an incident solar power of 100 mWcm−2, 
which represents a bright, clear, sunny day; this incident solar power is convert­
ed into lux using the following approximation: 1 mWcm−2 ≈ 1,250 lux [10]. 
SANYO also produces a range of cells suitable for use under artificial lighting 
sources, both these cells and the SCHOTT Solar devices are fabricated using 
amorphous silicon, which has a greater sensitivity at the lower intensities and 
wavelengths encountered when using artificial lighting as the energy source.
While this comparison suggests that an indoor specification device is the 
correct choice for use under natural light, it must be noted that indoor modules

Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
are specified for continuous use only up to light levels of the order of a few 
thousand lux. Continued operation at higher illumination levels may cause 
damage to the modules; therefore, care must be taken when selecting the type 
of solar cell for a specific application.
A U.K.-based company, G24 Innovations Limited, is manufacturing 
and developing third-generation, thin-film photovoltaic modules using dye-
sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). This is a low-cost, thin-film solar cell technology 
based on a semiconductor formed between a photosensitized anode and an 
electrolyte. Unlike silicon-based solar cells, DSSC-based solar cells are manu­
factured from low-cost materials and they are semiflexible and this allows instal­
lation of solar cells on nonflat surfaces. For applications that do not require the 
flexibility of the DSSCs, it is currently preferable to use rigid silicon-based solar 
cells as these have higher efficiencies. 
Researchers are using photovoltaic energy harvesting to power wireless 
sensor networks. A typical example is an autonomous wireless sensor network 
for sensing light, temperature, and humidity for environmental management 
in buildings that was reported by Wang et al. [12]. The network, consisting of 
62 wireless sensor nodes, was deployed in an office building. The nodes were 
powered using indoor solar cells and the measured parameters transmitted to 
the gateway through a 2.4-GHz ZigBee wireless link.
Also, standalone solar powered wireless sensor nodes for wireless sensor 
networks are commercially available. Some examples are: 
1.	 Energy harvesting wireless sensor modules such as the SMT310 from 
EnOcean. These are specifically designed for building applications 
[13] such as window contacts, temperature, and humidity sensors. 
2.	 The MSP430 Solar Energy Harvester Development Tool from Texas 
Instruments consisting of a MSP430F2274 microcontroller, CC2500 
2.4-GHz wireless transceiver and a solar module.
Table 2.2 shows an example of a number of commercially available solar 
panels that can potentially be used as photovoltaic energy harvesting in built 
environments.

This section has given a brief overview of photovoltaic energy-harvesting 
technology and power levels in the built environment. The reader is referred to 
Chapter 3 for the practical case study of a solar energy harvester.
2.2.2  Energy Harvesting from Thermal Sources
This section gives a brief overview of the thermoelectric energy-harvesting 
technology, surveying energy-harvesting sources, energy harvesters, and energy 
sources in built environments. The reader is referred to Chapter 4 for a more 
in-depth analysis of the topic. 
Thermoelectric energy harvesters, based on the Seebeck effect in semi­
conductor junctions, are used to convert a temperature gradient into electri­
cal power. By using differing combinations of serial and parallel connection 
of the junction pairs, the output voltage and current of the harvester can be 
adjusted. Typically, a series connection is used to maximize the output voltage, 
at the expense of current, to permit usable voltage levels to be reached at lower 
temperature gradients. The basic configuration of a thermoelectric generator is 
illustrated in Figure 2.1.
The voltage (electromotive force) (Voc ), which can be generated by this 
basic thermoelectric generator depends on the temperature difference between 
the hot side and the cold side (ΔT ), the total number of thermo-couples (n), 
and the Seebeck coefficient (αsb) as shown in (2.1).

The most common thermoelectric devices are bulk-fabricated thermo­
electric energy harvesters that are made from individual p and n-type semi­
conductors assembled onto ceramic plates to form a number of connected pn 
junctions. The type of materials used to fabricate p and n-type elements are an 
importing aspect of the performance of the thermoelectric energy harvester. 
For room-temperature applications, the best combination is n-type bismuth 
telluride (Bi2Te3) and p-type antimony telluride (Sb3 Te3) p-n junctions. The 
ceramic plates support the electrical interconnection of the semiconductor ele­
ments and also serve as the device’s thermal interface; an example is the thermo­
electric generator range of devices produced by Marlow Industries [14] shown 
in Figure 2.2.
These are unpackaged devices fabricated on ceramic substrates and are 
rated for use up to 250°C. To use such a device, it is necessary to mount it onto 
the thermal source and to provide heat sinking to the colder side of the device 
to maintain the thermal gradient across the harvester. The device shown in Fig­
ure 2.2 is the TG 12-4-01 L and is 30 × 34 × 3.5 mm in size and can produce 
4.05W of power at its maximum continuous operating temperature of 230°C 
with a temperature gradient of 180°C. 
Other example thermoelectric devices are the microfabricated devices pro­
duced by Micropelt [15]. These devices have been microfabricated to increase 
the junction density, permitting operation from lower thermal gradients as a 
higher number of thermal junctions can be incorporated into a given volume 
than can be achieved with the bulk-fabrication process. These harvesters are 
available as just the thermoelectric element, as integrated evaluation units, or as 
custom-designed solutions to fit the end-user requirements. The actual energy-
harvesting element has a hot side area of either approximately 8 mm2 or 14 
Figure 2.2  Thermoelectric energy harvester from Marlow Industries Inc. [14].

mm2 depending on the device selected [16]. This provides a size advantage over 
the bulk-fabricated devices, which typically have hot-side areas of 400 mm2 and 
above. An example of a microfabricated device with the harvesting elements 
exposed is shown in Figure 2.3(a). The complete device with its mounting sur­
face and heat sink is shown in Figure 2.3(b). The thermoelectric generator has 
dimensions of 20 × 34 × 2.2 mm with 127 thermocouple junctions and it can 
generate a maximum power of 8.5 mW at a maximum temperature gradient of 
ΔT = 30°C.
Apart from the advanced development of commercial thermoelectric gen­
erators, researchers have been working to further develop and test the usability 
of these thermoelectric generators. For example, Lu and Yang [18] reported a 
thermoelectric generator prototype wireless sensor node, which could generate 
up 150 mW at a temperature gradient of 34°C; the hot side was at 55°C and 
the cold side was 21°C. The thermoelectric generator had dimensions of 30 × 
34 × 3.2 mm and was used to replace the batteries required to power a ZigBee-
based automatic radiator valve. An example of typical commercially available 
thermoelectric generators is shown in Table 2.3.
2.2.3  Energy Harvesting from Periodic Kinetic Sources
Kinetic energy harvesting is the conversion of ambient mechanical energy, typi­
cally in the form of vibration, into electrical energy. Within this section, har­
vesters designed to operate from a periodic source, such as the vibration of a 
motor, are discussed. The reader is referred to Chapter 7 for a more in-depth 
analysis of the topic.
The amount of electrical energy that can be harvested from mechanical 
vibration depends on the vibration level, the frequency of vibration, and the 
size of the harvester. If the harvester is modeled as a typical inertial, linear gen­
erator, the maximum electrical power (Pe) that can be extracted from it can be 
calculated mathematically as given in (2.2) [20]:

vesting element and (b) the mounting surface and heatsink. (Courtesy Micropelt GmbH [17].)

where m is the mass of the generator in kilograms, a is the peak acceleration 
in ms−2, ω (=2πf ) is the angular frequency in rads−1, and QOC is the open-
circuit quality factor. A thorough description and mathematical derivations of 
this model can be found in [20, 21].
Assuming that the vibrational acceleration is sinusoidal in nature, the root 
mean square (RMS) extractable electrical power (PeRMS) can be found by sub­
stituting the peak acceleration level in (2.2) with the RMS acceleration level to 
give (2.3).

Most kinetic energy harvesters to date convert vibrations into electrical 
energy using one of the following transduction mechanisms �����������������
[2, 22]����������
: electro­
magnetic, piezoelectric, or electrostatic. Electromagnetic transduction is based 
on the principle of induction which arises from the relative motion of a con­
ductor moving through a magnetic flux. Piezoelectric transduction is based on 
mechanical stress applied to piezoelectric materials. Electrostatic transduction 
utilizes the relative movement between electrically isolated charged capacitor 
plates to generate electricity. The source vibrational energy is typically an un­
wanted side effect that can be usefully damped by energy harvesting. 
For periodic vibrations, vibration energy harvesters are commercially 
available such as the piezoelectric Volture manufactured by Midé [23] and the 
electromagnetic (EM) devices manufactured by Perpetuum [24]. The Midé 
Volture containing a piezoelectric-based harvesting element is shown in Figure 
2.4. The dimensions of this device are 50.8 × 38.1 × 0.5 mm and it can generate 
maximum power of 9.23 mW. An example of the EM devices manufactured by 
Perpetuum is shown in Figure 2.5, which is the PMG FSH50 with a diameter 
of 68 mm, a height of 63.3 mm, and AN output power of 20 mW.

Energy Harvesting in the Built Environments

These devices are typically designed to harvest vibration energy at a spe­
cific frequency and are mechanically tuned to be resonant at this frequency. 
In the case of mains electricity powered motors, the vibration spectra typically 
have peaks at multiples of the primary mains frequency (50 Hz or 60 Hz). It 
is important to note that devices tuned to harvest from a motor supplied by a 
50-Hz supply will not work effectively with vibration from a 60-Hz supplied 
motor and vice versa.
Researchers have also reported kinetic energy-harvesting devices. Xing 
and Sun [25] demonstrated a vibration energy harvester that had two solenoids 
fixed on two sides of a spring-supported hard magnet pair. The harvester had 
an open-circuit output voltage of 2.52V, a maximum output power of 610.62 
mW, a power density of 20.84 mWcm−3 at frequency of 42 Hz, and an accelera­
tion of 49 ms−2. Lei et al. [26] reported a vibration energy harvester; the device 
consisted of a rectangular permanent magnet, a planar copper spring, and a 
wire-wound copper coil and generated a maximum output power of 205.38 
µW across a load resistance of 252Ω at a resonance frequency of 124.2 Hz with 
acceleration of 4.9 ms−2. Aktakka and Najafi ���������������������������������
[27]�����������������������������
 reported a piezoelectric in­
ertial harvester that can harvest vibrational energy in all three dimensions. The 
device had a volume of 6.5 cm3 and could harvest 53 µW of power from an 
acceleration of 0.49 ms−2. Table 2.4 shows some of the reported kinetic energy 
harvesters in the literature and their power densities.

Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
2.2.4  Energy Harvesting from Intermittent Kinetic Sources
When the available kinetic energy results from intermittent human activity, 
such as opening doors, there are electromagnetic-based harvester devices avail­
able to exploit these sources. A typical example is the Kaba PowerLever [28] 
energy-harvesting device that can harvest energy from the action of turning 
a door handle. This energy is typically used to power security control devices 
within the lock and the lock mechanism itself. The energy harvester consists 
of an electromagnetic dynamo that is driven through the gearing to increase 
the revolutions of the generator from one operation of the door handle. An­
other example of energy harvesting from doors is the NRG+ Tourniket revolv­
ing door from Boon Edam, which has a generator incorporated into the door 
mechanism [29]. When the door is rotated, the pivot of the door turns a gen­
erator that harvests energy from the rotation. The energy-harvesting technology 
is used for two purposes: first, it is used to control the rotational speed of the 
door; and second, the energy harvested is stored in a supercapacitor and then 
used to illuminate the door with LED lighting.
A number of groups are researching energy-harvesting floors for applica­
tion in buildings. Wu et al. [30] and Pisharody [31] have reported different 
approaches to implementing floor mat harvesters based on the use of a piezo­
electric material to convert the impact of the foot into electrical energy. The 
energy generated from the floor mat developed by Wu et al. was used to drive 
a wireless transmitter module to detect the user’s current position in a build­
ing. The output from the floor mat developed by Pisharody was used to charge 
two Ni-Cd batteries that were connected in parallel. Similar designs have been 
reported by Bischur and Schwesinger [32] and Kumar et al. [33].
The development of commercial products is ongoing, with devices cur­
rently developed by Pavegen ������������������������������������������������
[34]��������������������������������������������
 and Sensitile �����������������������������
[35]�������������������������
. The Pavegen energy-har­
vesting device was demonstrated at the London 2012 Olympics where 12 har­
vesters were installed on a temporary footbridge connecting West Ham station 
to the Olympic park. During the Olympics and Paralympics, it was estimated 
that the devices would receive 12 million footfalls and harvest a total of 72 MJ 
of energy ��������������������������������������������������������������������
[36]����������������������������������������������������������������
, which is 21 kWh of energy. The energy harvested from the foot­
steps was used to power 12 LED spotlights. The third generation of the Pavegen

harvester is shown Figure 2.6. The device can harvest 5W of continuous power 
from footsteps.
Within buildings hallways, stairs and entrances are the areas that experi­
ence a higher volume of footfalls. If energy harvesters are integrated into floor 
mats and doormats and installed in these areas, energy can be collected from 
these footfalls. A typical stairway in a house has 12 stair steps; using the steps 10 
times each day provides 120 footsteps per day. An energy harvester, such as the 
POWERleap from Sensitile, harvests 5J per step [38], giving 1.2 kJ of energy 
per person, per day, which equates to a continuous average of 14 mW of har­
vested power per day. This may be sufficient to power a low-power electronic 
device in the built environment, depending on the power consumption and 
duty cycle of the device.
A mechanical energy harvester already widely used in buildings, shown in 
Figure 2.6�����������������������������������������������������������������
,����������������������������������������������������������������
 is the ECO-200 from EnOcean, their energy harvester-based wire­
less technology is in use in over 250,000 buildings worldwide [39].
The operation of a light switch causes an electromagnetic bistable arma­
ture to move from one position to another, thus harvesting the mechanical 
energy. A common application of this harvester is self-powered wireless light 
switches, such as the PTM250 universal switch insert �����������������������
[40]�������������������
. The harvested me­
chanical energy powers a wireless transmitter, which sends a control signal to 
a mains powered receiver connected to the light to turn it on or off. A similar 
device is manufactured by Lightning Switch [41], although this device uses 
piezoelectric transduction to harvest the mechanical energy from the switch 
operation. Table 2.5 shows examples of intermittent energy-harvesting devices 
and their estimated harvested energy per operation.
2.2.5  Energy Harvesting from Electromagnetic Waves
Electromagnetic energy harvesters convert electromagnetic waves available in 
the environment into electricity. In the literature, electromagnetic-wave energy

a triangular floor tile, and (b) an example of an energy-harvesting floor with one energy har­
vester supporting six vertices of six floor tiles [37].

Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
harvesters are also referred as radio frequency (RF) energy harvesters, as RF is a 
subset of electromagnetic waves and is colloquially known as radio waves. The 
electromagnetic wave can be the result of emissions from radiation emitting 
devices such as: mobile base stations, Wi-Fi routers, satellite communications, 
radio, and TV transmitters. The amount of energy harvested depends on the 
RF-to-dc conversion efficiency and the amount of RF power received by the 
harvester, which in turn depends on the transmitted power (PTX), the gain 
of the transmitting antenna (GTX), the gain of the receiving antenna (GRX), 
and the distance from the RF source to the harvester (R). This relationship is 
given in (2.4) [43] where η is the RF-to-dc conversion efficiency, PDC is the 
harvested power and λ is the wavelength of the transmitting frequency.

This equation assumes free-space propagation but in a building the 
amount of received power will be significantly less. The dc power (PDC) from 
RF energy harvester is estimated to decrease by a factor of 100 by moving 10m 
away from the RF source [44]. This suggests that PDC depends on the distance 
between the RF harvester and the RF source due to RF path loss.
The electromagnetic energy source can be already present in the target 
environment, such as telecommunication transmissions, or a dedicated source 
specifically provided for harvesting. In the case of a specifically provided energy 
source, the target device is not harvesting unwanted energy, but is simply be­
ing transferred from the source to the target; in this section, both existing and 
specifically provided electromagnetic sources will be considered. The main elec­
tromagnetic wave sources in buildings are given in Table 2.6:
1.	 Computer networking RF sources: Wi-Fi routers are commonly used 
to provide Internet access in many buildings; one or more routers are 
installed in a building depending on the size of the building. Electro­
magnetic waves from these routers and other routers in the neighbor­
hood can be found in most rooms, with signal strength depending on 
the distance to the router. In many cases, these electromagnetic signals

Energy Harvesting in the Built Environments

can be harvested and converted into usable electrical energy without 
significantly deteriorating the communication between the router and 
other devices unless the harvester is placed within a few centimeters 
of either the router or the receiving device. Similarly, Wi-Fi-enabled 
portable devices such as laptops, tablets, and smart phones transmit 
electromagnetic waves when they are operated. The radiated power 
from these devices is significant in proximity, but lower than that from 
the Wi-Fi routers. Also, most laptops, tablets, and smart phones have 
a Bluetooth transmitter and receiver for short-range communication. 
When in operation, these devices generate electromagnetic waves at 
2.4 GHz; however, the transmitted power level is usually kept as low 
as possible. Within Europe, the maximum effective isotropic radiated 
power from these devices is limited to 100 mW [45]. Examples of the 
dc output power from a rectenna that can be harvested from these 
sources is 76.35 µW at distance of 40 cm away from Wi-Fi router and 
1.74 µW at 2.4m away [46]. 
2.	 Radio and television broadcasting: These transmitters operate from 88 
to 108 MHz for FM radios, 175 to 230 MHz for digital audio broad­
casting, and 470 to 854 MHz for TV broadcasting. The transmitting 
antennas of these broadcasting stations radiate a significant amount of 
power in the form of electromagnetic waves. For example, the U.K. 
communication regulator Ofcom shows a list of all TV broadcasting 
stations across the United Kingdom and their corresponding effective 
radiated power (ERP). The ERP ranges from 40W up to 20 kW [47] 
at the transmitter. The broadcasting stations are spatially distributed 
to provide coverage across the country. This means that electromag­
netic waves are readily available in buildings and can be converted 
into electricity by using suitable energy harvesters. Empirically, powers 
ranging from 18 µW to 65 µW can be harvested from digital broad­

casting TV stations and about 8 µW to 85 µW can be harvested from 
analog TV broadcasting stations [48].
3.	 Mobile telecommunications: For mobile communications, the Glob­
al System for Mobile Communications (GSM) standard has now 
evolved to the 4G system, and in the near future 5G will be deployed. 
The mobile and broadband service providers distribute the base sta­
tions in most areas to provide network coverage for their customers. 
Electromagnetic waves from these base stations are commonly avail­
able at 900 MHz (also known as GSM900 because of the operating 
frequency band) and 1,800 MHz (GSM1800) in Africa, Europe, the 
Middle East, and Asia, and at 850 MHz (GSM800) and 1900 MHz 
(GSM1900) in North America and South America. Base stations have 
transmission powers ranging from 20W to 50W depending on the 
operating frequency, the power class number, and the size of the cell 
(the area served by one base station). However, the received signal 
strength within a building is relatively low, in the range of milliwatts 
[49], because of the free-space path loss, attenuation, absorption, and 
scattering. Calls and text messages made and sent from mobile com­
munication devices result in the generation of electromagnetic waves 
that are transmitted to base stations. These waves and scattered waves 
can be collected and converted into electricity.
Researchers have conducted measurements to quantify the level of RF 
power density from various sources discussed above. A typical example is a city-
wide RF spectral survey that was conducted within greater London, United 
Kingdom, by the Imperial Collage London to identify RF power density levels 
suitable for ambient harvesting within a semi-urban environment and the result 
of this survey is well documented in [51].
A typical electromagnetic energy harvester consists of an antenna for con­
verting electromagnetic waves into an alternating electric current and a rectifier 
circuit for converting the alternating current into direct current. However, ad­
ditional circuits such as RF filters, voltage multiplying circuits, and coupling 
circuits are usually also incorporated.
To give indicative power densities expected from RF energy harvesters, 
four RF harvesters reported by Piñuela et al. �������������������������������
[50]���������������������������
 from Imperial Collage Lon­
don are shown in Table 2.6. 
There are no commercial devices targeted at harvesting electromagnetic 
waves already present in the market. However, several researchers have reported 
such ambient electromagnetic energy harvesters. Nintanavongsa and Muncuk 
[51] reported a two-stage RF energy harvester operating at the 915-MHz band, 
with one stage being optimized to work at low input RF power (~−20 dBm) 
and the other at high RF input power (~20 dB). The prototype produced 10 

 
Energy Harvesting in the Built Environments 
25
µW at 10 dBm and 37 µW at −6 dBm, with efficiencies of 10% and 14.73%, 
respectively. Shao et al. [52] reported a dual-band RF energy harvester, which 
produced 1.2-V dc for −19-dBm RF input power at 900 MHz with 12% con­
version efficiency and 1.05V for −18-dBm RF input power at 2 GHz with 8% 
conversion efficiency. Kitazawa et al. ����������������������������������������
[53]������������������������������������
 reported a multistage RF to dc con­
version circuit for harvesting RF power from a mobile base station operating 
in the 800-MHz band. The conversion efficiency ranged from 0.8% to 19.7%, 
as a function of the power from the base station. For example, at −5 dBm in­
put RF power, the prototype generated 970 mV at a conversion efficiency of 
19.7%. Takhedmit et al. [54] developed a prototype that could harvest 850 mV 
and 3-V dc from −15-dBm and −5-dBm input RF power, respectively, in the 
2.5-GHz band. Olgun et al. [55] reported a planar rectenna for use in the 2.45-
GHz band with a conversion efficiency between 8% and 70% depending on 
the input power level. RF-to-dc power conversion efficiencies ranging from 1% 
to 20% and from 30% to 60% have also been reported in [57, 58] respectively. 
It is worth noting that the efficiency of an RF energy harvester is given by the 
ratio of the average dc output power into the storage element (e.g., battery or 
supercapacitor) to the RF power received by the antenna. This efficiency is 
dependent on the RF input power and it tends to increase with an increase in 
input power as low RF input power is likely to completely drop within rectify­
ing circuit of the harvester and results into poor efficiency.
Deliberate transmission of electromagnetic waves for harvesting is being 
used by companies such as WiTricity ��������������������������������������
[58]����������������������������������
 and PowerCast �������������������
[59]���������������
 and is common­
ly known as wireless electricity. They have developed commercial products that 
transmit electricity wirelessly to charge electronic devices such as phones. How­
ever, like other RF transmissions, the transmitted power decreases rapidly with 
distance (by a factor of 1/r2) and this causes a power loss between the transmit­
ter (power broadcaster) and the harvester. Additional losses occur in the internal 
circuitry of the harvester during the conversion process. For example, Vullers 
et al. [60] reported that a transmitted power of 100 mW reduced to harvested 
powers of 1.5 mW, 20 cm away from the transmitter and 200 µW, 2m away.
2.2.6  Energy Harvesting from Inductive Power Transfer
This section gives a brief overview of the inductive power transfer technology; 
the reader is referred to Chapter 5 for a more in-depth analysis of this topic and 
practical case study.
When an electric current flows through a cable, the electromagnetic fields 
around it emanate into the surrounding environment. Electrical energy can be 
harvested from these electromagnetic fields if the harvester is located within 
the field; for example, energy can be harvested from cables running from wall 

26 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
sockets to appliances. Clearly, a limitation with this method is that energy can 
only be harvested when there is a flow of current through the cable.
Harvesting energy from electromagnetic waves emanating from current 
currying conductors has been investigated by a number of researchers. Leland 
et al. [61] developed and tested devices that could be coupled to magnetic fields 
surrounding wires carrying ac. The devices had two functions: harvesting en­
ergy for wireless sensor nodes and passive, proximity-based current sensors. In 
energy harvesting operation, the devices generated 208 µW of power into a 
419-kΩ load resister when coupled to a space heater cable carrying 9.4A, and 
345 µW into a 419-kΩ load when coupled to a 13-A current. Taithongchai 
and Leelarasmee [62] reported an adaptive electromagnetic energy harvesting 
circuit that generated 58 mW from a single electric conductor carrying a 65-A 
line current. Despite the 65-A ac in this experiment being larger than the 13-A 
ac in the experiment by Leland et al. ���������������������������������������
[61]�����������������������������������
, the power difference is very pro­
nounced, and this is likely to be caused by magnetic field cancellation in the 
two current-carrying conductors in Leland’s experiment. Bhuiyan et al. [63] 
presented a coupling device that could deliver 10 mW of dc power into a 50Ω 
load, with a load current of 14.03 mA when coupled electromagnetically to 
a nearby ac-carrying conductor carrying 13.5A. Gupta et al. [64] conducted 
experiments with various off-the-shelf inductors and current-carrying conduc­
tors and concluded that up to 1 to 2 mW of power can be harvested from stray 
electromagnetic waves generated from a pair of ac-carrying conductors carry­
ing a current of 8.4A. The author identifies the limitation that the magnetic 
field strength decreases exponentially with distance from the current carrying 
conductor, so the harvester must be located in proximity to the conductor for 
effective energy harvesting.
2.2.7  Energy Harvesting from Airflow
This section gives a brief introduction to the energy harvesting from various air­
flow sources in built environment, energy harvesters reported in the literature, 
and typical power levels and power densities. The reader is referred to Chapter 
6 for a more details and case studies on this topic.
Many buildings are equipped with air conditioners that cause airflow 
within the area for the purpose of changing the air temperature to a level that 
is comfortable for the occupants. Typically, the average indoor airflow speed 
is 0.3 ms−1 [65] and it ranges between 2 ms−1 to 4 ms−1 near to wind sources 
(e.g., air ducts) ���������������������������������������������������������������
[66]�����������������������������������������������������������
. The airflow can be harvested and there are three main ap­
proaches to harvesting energy at small scales from airflow. The first approach, 
and the most widely used method, uses axial flow turbines. Small-scale air­
flow turbines consist of a propeller system that is forced to rotate by the air­
flow. The rotation, via a gearing system, drives a transducer, which is usually 

 
Energy Harvesting in the Built Environments 
27
electromagnetic-based. This transducer converts the mechanical rotations into 
electricity. The functional block diagram showing the conversation of airflow 
speed into electricity is shown in Figure 2.8, where Pwind is the airflow power, 
PT (CpPwind) is the mechanical power, and Pelec (= ηgenPT) is the electrical power.
Typically, the harvested energy depends on the wind speed, air density, 
and the sweep area of the wind turbine blade as given in (����������������������

where PT is the mechanical harvested power in W, ρ is the air density in kgm−3, 
A is the sweep area of the wind turbine blade in m2, v is the wind speed in ms−1, 
and Cp is the power coefficient. It is worth noting that, in 1919, Albert Betz 
concluded that a wind turbine cannot convert more than 59% of the kinetic 
energy of the wind [69] into electricity. 
The mechanical power given in (2.5) can be converted by the generator

Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
An example of a miniature wind turbine that could be used, for example, 
in an air conditioning duct within a building is the device described by Howey 
et al. [70], shown in Figure 2.9. 
The device has a 2-cm-diameter rotor blade located within a shroud that 
serves the dual purpose of guiding the airflow through the turbine and hous­
ing the axial flux permanent magnet generator. The device components were 
fabricated using a range of techniques including rapid prototyping, machining 
and flexible printed circuit board (PCB) technology. The miniature turbine 
was tested in a wind tunnel with wind speeds between 3 and 10 ms−1 and the 
electrical load on the output of the turbine was varied to find the maximum 
extractable electrical output power at each wind speed. At a wind speed of 3 
ms−1, the extractable power from the generator was 80 µW, at 7 ms−1 the ex­
tractable power was 2.5 mW, and at 10 ms−1 the extractable power was 4.3 
mW. Over the wind speed test range of 3 to 7 ms−1, the overall device efficiency 
varied from 0.61% to 1.52 %, with the maximum efficiency at a wind speed of 
6 ms−1. However, the authors identify parts of the device where the design has 
not been fully refined and where there is potential to reduce losses and improve 
the overall device conversion efficiency.
An example of a commercially available miniature turbine is the HYmini 
handheld turbine [71], which has a ~6.5-cm-diameter turbine combined with a 
Li-ion polymer battery to store the energy harvested. The whole device, includ­
ing the storage battery, has dimensions of 134 × 87.5 × 33.5 mm. The device 
is specified to operate for wind speeds in the range of 4 to 18 ms−1 and it is 
anticipated that the unit be mounted onto a moving person or a moving object 
such as a bicycle.
The second approach to harvesting from airflow is based on air-driven 
vibrating transducer ribbons, which derives from the Aeolian harp, a musical 
instrument consisting of strings stretched lengthwise across two bridges; wind 
can blow across the strings to produce sound. The sound amplitude depends

Energy Harvesting in the Built Environments 
29
on the strength of the wind passing over the strings and can range from a barely 
audible hum to a loud scream. Energy harvesters using this approach consist 
of a vibrating ribbon placed in the air stream and excited by the impact of the 
air. Coupled to the vibrating ribbon is a transducer, which converts the result­
ing movement into electricity. Potential transducers to convert the mechanical 
kinetic energy to electrical energy are based on electromagnetic, electrostatic, 
or piezoelectric principles. Humdinger [72] has produced a range of different 
scale wind belts based on this principle. Its smallest version, having a vibrating 
ribbon with dimensions of 7 × 120 mm and housing of 13 × 3 × 2.5 cm3, is 
reported to produce an ac output power at 70 Hz ranging from 200 µW at a 
wind speed of 3.5 ms−1 to 5 mW at 7.5 ms−1 [73]. For powering the wireless 
sensor node in buildings, the harvesters based on this technique could be scaled 
down further, although the levels of harvested energy can be expected to de­
crease significantly. 
The third approach to airflow harvesting is based on flapping airflow gen­
erators [74, 75], and an example of energy-harvesting device using this principle 
is described by Zhu et al. [66], who used oscillations of a cantilever facing into 
the direction of airflow. A wing was attached to the free end of the cantilever 
to cause the cantilever to oscillate. A bluff body was placed upwind of it, which 
led to the production of vortices within the airflow. By appropriate design and 
placement of the bluff body and tuning of the cantilever structure, the system 
could be made to resonate. An example of this device configured for operation 
in the horizontal plane is shown in Figure 2.10; the harvester is mounted so that 
the airflow is perpendicular to the face of the bluff body impacting the bluff 
body prior to the wing, so in the figure the direction of airflow is from the bot­
tom right to the top left.
The energy harvester has overall dimensions of 14.1 × 10 × 5.5 cm 
and is designed to be utilized within heating, ventilation, and air condition­
ing (HVAC) ductwork. The transduction mechanism, used to convert the 
Figure 2.10  Horizontal airflow energy harvester from Zhu et al. [66].

Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
mechanical oscillation to electrical energy, is a pair of moving magnets attached 
to the wing and a fixed coil, as shown in Figure 2.10. In tests in office HVAC 
ducting, typical air flows of 2 to 4 ms−1 occurred, from which the harvester 
produced output powers of 90 and 573 µW, respectively.
Other small-scale wind energy harvesters includes that reported by Myers 
et al. [76] with output dc power of 5.0 mW at a wind speed of 4.5 ms−1 and 
with dimensions of 7.62 × 10.16 × 12.7 cm3 and the other one is [76] with an 
output dc power of 5.0 mW at wind speed of 4.5 ms−1 and with dimensions of 
7.62 × 10.16 × 12.7 cm3; another one is the device reported by Carli et al. [77] 
with an output power of 10 mW at a wind speed of 4.4 ms−1 and with diameter 
of 6.3 cm and height of 7. 5 cm (= volume of 233.82 cm3).
Power densities of some of airflow energy harvesters reported in the litera­
tures are shown in Table 2.7.
2.2.8  Hybrid Energy Harvesting
Hybrid energy-harvesting systems are used to harvest energy from two or more 
ambient energy sources. Harvesting energy from several sources should increase 
the total amount of energy available and provide contingency in case the energy 
from a single source is not sufficient or available. Tan et al. [78] reported an 
optimized hybrid energy harvesting system that harvests energy from indoor 
ambient light and thermal energy using only one power management system to 
condition the combined output power from the two energy sources. An average 
electrical power of 621 µW was reported at an average indoor solar irradiance 
of 1,010 lux and a thermal gradient of 10K. This result was achieved by harvest­
ing from the two sources simultaneously and also by operating the photovol­
taic harvesting efficiently through the use of maximum power point tracking. 
This high efficiency, combined with the use of shared, highly-efficient, energy 
management electronics, leads to a higher overall energy conversion efficiency, 
ranging from 80% to 94% over a range of load resistances of 50 to 330 kΩ. It 
should be noted that this efficiency is much higher than the actual efficiency 
of both photovoltaic cells and thermoelectric generator. As illustrated in Figure 
2.11, this is the efficiency of the hybrid energy converter and it is obtained us­

ing its output power (Po), and the input output power from the photovoltaic 
(PPV) and thermoelectric generator (PTEG), for example, efficiency, η = Po/
(PPV + PTEG) × 100%.
A similar hybrid energy harvester that integrates photovoltaic and ther­
moelectric harvesters was reported by Suzuki et al. �����������������������
[79]�������������������
. The combined pho­
tovoltaic and thermoelectric module was fabricated using organic material on 
flexible film; however, the efficiency of the hybrid device when operating in 
photovoltaic mode is 4.9  10−4 % and 2.1 × 10−2 % quoted by the authors for 
the percentage of energy converted. Colomer-Farrarons et al. [80] developed a 
hybrid harvester that used six solar cells, each having a dimension of 22 × 7 mm 
and an efficiency of 17 % (indoor environment at 1,500 lux); two piezoelectric 
generators, each having dimension of 50.8 × 38.1 mm (operating at 1 ms−2 and 
80 Hz); and electromagnetic induction using a planar rectangular antenna of 
30 × 15 mm (operating with a carrier frequency of 13.56 MHz and located at 
a distance of 25 mm from an RF source transmitting at 200 mW). The maxi­
mum combined power harvested from the three sources was 6.4 mW.
2.2.9  Summary of Energy Levels in Built Environments
Table 2.8 gives a typical range of power that can be obtained from various 
surveyed energy sources in the built environment. It also gives typical power 
densities reported in the literature.
The result in Table 2.8 shows that thermoelectric and periodic kinetic en­
ergy harvesters can provide power up to 4W and 611 mW, respectively. This is 
higher than the power expected from airflow, photovoltaic, and electromagnetic 
with maximum powers of 10 mW, 665 µW, and 85 µW, respectively. From this 
result, it can be seen that thermoelectric and periodic kinetic harvesters can pro­
vide sufficient amounts of power for continuous operation of wireless sensors 
within built environments. Airflow and photovoltaic energy harvesters can also 
be used to charge energy storage devices for duty-cycled operation of wireless

Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
sensors in the built environment. However, energy harvesting from electromag­
netic waves is much lower and it will not practically produce sufficient power 
for wireless sensors in the built environment.
While the literature review shows that some of the energy-harvesting 
technologies can provide sufficient power for the application, further energy 
measurement is required to quantify and verify the amount of energy that can 
be harvested from various energy sources in the built environment. 
2.3  Empirical Energy Measurements in the Built Environments
This section gives a summary of empirical energy-level measurements that were 
taken in residential and commercial built environments. The measurement re­
sults give a broad picture of typical energy levels from various energy sources 
available in the built environments and possible values of ambient energy levels 
that can be harvested. The details of measurement settings, assumptions, and 
calculations can be found in [81].
2.3.1  Energy Levels in Residential and Commercial Buildings
A thorough survey performed within residential and commercial buildings (the 
details and raw data are in [81, 82]) identified potential energy sources, and the 
ambient energy levels from these sources were used to estimate the amount of 
electrical power that can be harvested from these sources. A summary of these 
energy sources and their corresponding range of typical ambient energy levels, 
as well as the corresponding estimated output dc powers, are presented in Table 
2.9.
The most practical energy-harvesting source identified within the build­
ings surveyed is light due to its widespread availability. The typical light inten­
sity from the measurements carried out ranges from 100 to more than 1,000 
lux, assuming a photovoltaic size of 3 × 3 cm2, a range of approximately 25 to 
306 µW, respectively, of output power is available. However, the light intensity

varied very much based on the type of the building and the use of the particu­
lar area. The intensity can be as low as 0 lux, in rooms that have limited light 
sources and can exceed 1,000 lux in a well-illuminated built infrastructure.
Thermal sources are available in the form of heating pipework and radia­
tors in both commercial and residential buildings. Within the domestic loca­
tions, temperature differences with respect to ambient air temperature (typi­
cally 21°C) ranging from 10°C to 40°C were measured from the surface of 
the radiators and hot water pipes. These temperature differences can give dc 
powers in the range of 1 to 10 mW. However, the energy from these sources is 
only available when the radiators are turned on or when hot water is flowing 
through the pipes.
Periodic kinetic energy sources that are available in residential building 
are mainly in the form of vibrations from microwave, refrigerator, washing ma­
chine, central heating boiler, tumble dryer, and other appliances. Commercial 
buildings are also fitted with central boiler/heating systems and some have mi­
crowaves. Most of these units generate vibrations with accelerations in the range 
of 2.45 × 10−2 to 2.82 ms−2 and have vibrational frequencies in the range of 
43.1 to 162.3 Hz. The estimated output power ranges from 8.08 × 10−3 to 68.7 
µW. The major disadvantage of harvesting energy from these sources is that the 
energy availability is dependent on the intermittent usage of the units. 
The received signal strength of electromagnetic power is in the range of 
−72 to −29 dBm, which gives a dc output power ranging from 27 pW up 
to about 1 µW, assuming a conversion efficiency of 70% for the harvester. 
The main advantage of harvesting power from electromagnetic sources is that 
the power is usually continuously available because most communication 
base stations and TV and radio transmitters operate continuously. However, 
the effective power from these transmitters decreases exponentially with dis­
tance from the source. This leads to low-power levels, which are sufficient for

communication purposes, but in many cases unusable for practical energy-har­
vesting applications.
Energy can be harvested from airflows where these are available with suf­
ficient velocity, necessitating location of the harvesting device in locations such 
as within HVAC air circulation ducting, where a predictable airflow is available, 
for comfort reasons many other airflows within occupied building spaces are 
avoided. From the air speeds measured, it was estimated that based on numeri­
cal calculations the output power can range from 0.9 to 324 mW at airflow 
speeds of 1 to 10 ms−1, respectively. Again, however, the power will only be 
available to harvest from these sources when the air circulation units are in 
operation.
2.3.2  Comparison of Power Levels Reported in the Literature and Those Obtained 
Imperially
Comparing the power levels from the energy harvesting sources obtained em­
pirically and those obtained from the literature (see Table 2.8), it is clear that 
there are some similarities. For conveniences, the power level from Tables 2.8 
and 2.9 are shown in Table 2.10.
Despite the power level differences shown in Table 2.10, generally the 
literature and empirical results show that power levels from airflow and thermal 
energy-harvesting sources is higher compared to other energy sources. This is 
followed by photovoltaic, periodic kinetic, and electromagnetic waves. There­
fore, the type of the energy source to be used for a specific wireless sensor ap­
plication in built infrastructure has to take into consideration factors such as 
energy level, availability, size, and type of the harvester. 
2.4  Energy-Harvesting Sources on the Human Body

complete without discussing energy harvesting on the human body. This is be­

cause body area networks and wearable devices and sensors are an integral part 
of the wireless sensor network in the built environment. These wearable sensors, 
like any other wireless sensors, require power and therefore this calls for an in­
vestigation into energy harvesting on the human body. A significant amount of 
research has been done to investigate and quantify the amount of energy that 
can be harvested on various parts of human body. In this section, a brief survey 
of advances in energy harvesting on the human body is given and energy levels 
from various energy harvesters and their power densities are discussed.
Energy can be harvested from the human body for powering wearable 
sensors and sensors constituting a body area network. Energy can be harvested 
from body heat, breathing, blood pressure, arm motion, typing, and walking 
or through user actions such as winding or pedaling ��������������������������
[84]����������������������
. Most recent develop­
ments of energy harvesting sources on the human body are discussed next.
Several researchers have reported energy harvesters for harvesting energy 
from body heat. Kim et al. �����������������������������������������������������
[84]�������������������������������������������������
 reported a flexible thermoelectric generator in­
tegrated into a t-shirt. The prototype consisted of 12 thermocouples connected 
by conductive thread over an area of 6 × 25 mm2. Each thermocouple had a 
diameter of 4 mm and a thickness of 0.6 mm. The prototype was tested on the 
chest with a skin temperature of 32°C in environments with cold (5°C) and 
hot (25°C) ambient temperatures. The output power from the harvester was 
8.1 nW and 146.9 nW in the hot and cold environments respectively. Similarly, 
Leonov [85] integrated 16 thermoelectric generators into a shirt; each generator 
had a round hot plate with a diameter of 3 cm, a 5-mm-thick thermopile with 
256 thermocouples and a cold plate with dimensions of 40 mm by 30 mm by 1 
mm. The harvester was tested on people while sitting, walking, and cycling and 
it generated powers ranging from 0.5 mW to 5 mW in ambient temperatures 
between 27°C and 15°C, respectively. 
Researchers have also reported harvesters inserted into shoes to generate 
energy during walking. Almusallam et al. �����������������������������������
[86]�������������������������������
 reported screen-printed piezo­
electric shoe-insoles, with 8 elements in the sole. Each element was able to 
provide 2V (open circuit voltage). Details of both output power and harvester 
dimensions were not given. More recently, Zhao and You ����������������������
[87]������������������
 reported a piezo­
electric energy harvester embedded into a shoe that could provide an average 
power of 1 mW during walking at a frequency of roughly 1 Hz. 
Other harvesters have been developed to be mounted on various parts of 
the body or placed inside backpacks and rucksacks. Rao et al. [88] presented 
a functional vibration energy harvester which had a cylindrical structure with 
6.3-cm height and 3.8-cm diameter, leading to a total volume of 70 cm3 and a 
total weight of 81g. The harvester was tested by mounting it on the ankle, wrist, 
and arm when jogging, walking, and cycling. The maximum average power was 
obtained when the harvester was mounted on the ankle with 234 µW, 67 µW, 
and 34 µW when jogging, walking, and cycling, respectively. Saha et al. [89] 

36 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
reported an electromagnetic-based energy harvester with a cylindrical structure 
with 5.5-cm height and 1.8-cm diameter (volume ≈ 14 cm3). The prototype 
generated 0.3 to 2.46 mW when placed inside a rucksack that was worn during 
walking and slow running. 
Other reported energy harvesters on the human body include those har­
vesters driven by breath air flow from a mask [90] and typing forces [91]. 
Energy harvesters for harvesting energy from human body sources and 
their corresponding power densities are shown in Table 2.11.
2.5  Conclusions
The discussion of energy-harvesting technology applied to the built environ­
ment was presented in this chapter. The literature survey in this chapter shows 
that power levels that can be harvested from thermoelectric, periodic kinetic 
energy, airflow, photovoltaic, and electromagnetic wave harvesters are 4W, 611 
mW, 10 mW, 665 µW, and 85 µW, respectively. Based on energy levels reported 
in the literature and empirical measurement results presented in this chapter, it 
is obvious that thermoelectric and periodic kinetic energy harvesters produce 
high-level energy as compared to the other types. It is possible to power wireless 
sensors from these energy sources; in addition, airflow and photovoltaic energy 
harvesters can also be used to recharge storage devices for powering wireless sen­
sors in built environment. However, the energy levels harvested from electro­
magnetic waves are much lower compared to other energy sources investigated. 
In terms of energy availability within built environments, electromagnetic 
energy is likely to be available most of the time because most electromagnetic 
energy sources such as television broadcasting stations, radio stations, WiFi, 
and mobile communication base stations operate continuously. Based on this, 
electromagnetic energy duty cycle is likely to be about 100%. This is followed 
by photovoltaic energy sources that are likely to be available by 67%, thermo 
energy sources by 38%, airflow by 29%, and finally periodic kinetic energy 
sources by 8%. This energy availability is summarized in Table 2.12.

Energy Harvesting in the Built Environments

This chapter has also highlighted energy sources on human body; some 
surveyed energy sources on the human body produce sufficient energy for pow­
ering wearable sensors. For example, the thermoelectric energy harvester re­
ported by Leonov [85] can produce up to 667.7 mW of power, this is sufficient 
to power some wearable devices in the market. However, care must be taken on 
the selection of the type of the harvester and location of sensors to be powered. 
For instance, there is the challenge of connecting wires from a harvester located 
in a shoe insole to power a sensor integrated in a wristband.

Solar Cell-Powered Sensor Node for 
Emotion Monitoring Systems in Ambient-
Assisted Living Environment
Joseph W. Matiko, Russel Torah, Stephen P. Beeby, and John Tudor
3.1  Introduction
This chapter presents a case study of solar cell-powered sensor node for emotion 
monitoring in built environment. An overview of ambient-assisted living envi­
ronment is presented, and the motivation of monitoring emotions of assisted 
people is given, followed by design, prototyping, and performance evaluation of 
solar cell-powered sensor node for real-time monitoring of emotion of assisted 
people. 
3.1.1  Overview of Ambient-Assisted Living
Globally, the average life expectancy was 48 years in 1950, 62 years in 1980, 
and 69 years in 2010 [1], and it is expected to raise to 76 years in 2050 and 
81 years in 2100. This shows that human life expectancy has been increasing 
steadily from one generation to the next and as a result, the proportion of peo­
ple 65 years of age or older is increasing. In Europe, for example, it is projected 
that the proportion of people 65 years of age or older will increase from 17.1% 
in 2008 to 30.0 % in 2060 with the number of people older than 65 years pro­
jected to increase from 84.6 million to 151.5 million [2]. Similar increases are 
expected in other countries. Consequently, as the population of elderly people 
increases, two main challenges arise. The first challenge is a significant increase 

44 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
of public spending to support elderly people. For example, across the countries 
belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) [3], in 2010, 60% of health care expenditure was on people younger 
than 65 years of age. However, it is projected that, in 2060, an average of 60% 
of expenditure within OECD countries will be directed to people older than 65 
years of age [4]. The second challenge is the increase of dependency ratio (the 
number of persons 65 years of age and older divided by the number of persons 
15 to 64 years of age, multiplied by 100). It is projected that the dependency of 
elderly people in Europe will rise from 25.0 % in 2010 to 53.5 % in 2060 [2] 
due to the volatility of their health and their inability to perform some of the 
basic daily living activities.
As a way of addressing the highlighted challenges associated with an in­
creasing population of elderly people, research on ambient-assisted living (AAL) 
aims to extend the time during which elderly people can live independently 
in their preferred environment by providing support derived from informa­
tion and communication technologies [5]. A substantial amount of research 
has been done in the area of AAL, including monitoring the activities of daily 
living ��������������������������������������������������������������������������
[6],����������������������������������������������������������������������
 which could help to assess the well-being of elderly people in assis­
tive environments, fall detection and prevention [7], providing mobility and 
assistance [8], and assistive robotic systems [9]. Due to the importance of AAL, 
the European Union formed an AAL Joint Programme [10] in 2007 and it has 
funded over 150 research projects from 2008 to 2013 across 22 participating 
countries in Europe [11]. 
The technologies that enable ambient-assisted living include sensing, 
reasoning and processing, acting and interacting, communication, and inter­
action [12]. Therefore, the ambient-assisted living system consists of assistive 
devices, sensors, wireless sensor networks, computer hardware, computer net­
works, software applications, and databases ������������������������������������
[13]��������������������������������
 that are collectively intercon­
nected to exchange information and provide support to elderly people within 
the ambient-assistive environment. The assistive environment could either be a 
typical house or a dedicated care home for elderly people or people with special 
needs. Ambient-assisted living can be tailored to assist the occupants within the 
assistive environment in carrying out activities of daily lives and hence improve 
their autonomy and quality of life.
The research in ambient-assisted living is primarily aimed to make elderly 
people increase their autonomy and assist them in carrying out the activities of 
daily life and hence improve their quality of life. Quality of life, in this con­
text, can be defined as physical, mental, and social well-being [14]. Emotion 
monitoring can be used as a way of assessing the well-being of people [15] and 
their quality of life [16]. Research has shown that emotions are associated with 
the body immune system; people who typically report experiencing negative 
emotions are at greater risk of disease than those who typically report positive

emotions ���������������������������������������������������������������������
[17]�����������������������������������������������������������������
. Furthermore, people with a more negative affective style (nega­
tive emotional state) have a weaker immune response than those with a more 
positive affective style (positive emotional state) [18]. In the literature, it has 
been reported that people who frequently experience positive emotions live 
longer and healthier lives �����������������������������������������������������
[19]�������������������������������������������������
. Therefore, real-time emotion detection over ex­
tended periods can be used as a tool to evaluate and monitor the quality of life 
of people in an ambient-assisted environment. 
Research has also shown that it is possible to detect emotions from indi­
viduals’ facial expression and tone of voice. However, these detection methods 
can be deceived by individuals using misleading facial expressions or by chang­
ing the tone of speech [20], which may be a problem in some applications. 
Emotions can also be detected from physiological signals originating from the 
peripheral nervous system, such as galvanic skin response and skin temperature, 
as well as biopotentials such as the electrocardiogram (ECG) ������������������
[21]��������������
 and the elec­
troencephalogram (EEG) [22], which originates from the brain.  
In this chapter, our case study focuses on emotion detection from EEG 
signals. Studies on EEG signals from the human brain have shown that there is 
a connection between brain activities and emotions. It has been reported that 
the right hemisphere of the brain is more active during negative emotions (low 
valence) and the left hemisphere is more active during positive emotions (high 
valence) [23]. This has been supported by experimental results in the literature. 
For example, results reported in [24, 25] suggest that the alpha wave of the left 
hemisphere decreases with positive emotions and that of the right hemisphere 
decreases with negative emotions. Therefore, such brain asymmetry can be used 
to detect emotions from EEG signals.
3.1.2  Energy Harvesting-Powered Wearable EEG Devices
A few wearable EEG recording devices powered by energy harvesting have been 
reported in the literature. Leonov and Vullers [26] reported a two-channel 
EEG [see Figure 3.1(a)] powered by 10 thermoelectric generators attached on 
a stretchable headband, each with surface area of 1.6 × 4 cm2. The thermoelec­
tric generators were located at the forehead because this location provides high 
heat flow on large area. In addition, it is free from thermally isolating heat. At 
22°C, the harvester was able to generate about 2.5 mW. However, as the au­
thors pointed out, the drawback of this system is that, at low ambient energy, 
more power is generated, but this causes rapid heat flow which exceeds the 
sensation of discomfort and therefore the harvester turns into uncomfortably 
cold object. For example, at 19°C, the harvester produced 3.7 mW, but the 
sensation of the cold became too annoying to the wearer. Another drawback 
is the size of the harvester. Although the authors did not state the thickness of 

46 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
the harvester, it is clear from Figure 3.1(a) that this harvester is obstructive and 
impinges the wearer comfort. 
Van Bavel et al. [27]����������������������������������������������
 reported an improved design combining thermo­
electric and photovoltaic energy harvesters, with reduced size, in the form of a 
standard headset [see Figure 3.1(b)]. The hybrid harvester was composed of two 
sections of thermoelectric harvesters, one on the left side and the other on the 
right side of the head; each had an external area of 4 × 8 cm2 made of high-effi­
ciency silicon photovoltaic cells. The thermoelectric generators had a thermally 
conductive comb-type structure specifically made to eliminate the thermal bar­
rier between the skin and thermopiles caused by the wearer’s hair. The hybrid 
harvester provided more than 1 mW on average. This improved design provides 
a relatively small wearable EEG device that is less obtrusive. However, if worn 
for prolonged period, the comb-type structure of the thermo-generators might 
make the wearer uncomfortable. In addition, the headset design structure is not 
suitable for an EEG device, which aims to detect EEG from electrodes posi­
tioned at the forehead because access is prohibited. 
Dementyev and Smith [28] reported a low-power EEG circuit powered 
by radio frequency (RF) [see Figure 3.1(c)]. The prototype used radio frequency 
identification (RFID) for communication and for power harvesting. The har­
vester converted received RF energy deliberately transmitted by the RFID read­
er into electricity to charge the storage capacitor, which, in turn, used to power 
a single-channel EEG circuit that required 112.68 μW of power. Although the 
authors did not mention either the RF transmitted power or the RF conversion 
efficiency of the harvester, they concluded that this design is not robust because 
of the uncertain energy supply and it is suitable in the situation where the sub­
ject is stationary. In addition, it has the limitation of power transmission range 
of 2.6m that may limit mobility within the built environment or requiring the 
installation of several RF power transmitters. 
At the moment, there are few energy harvesting-powered wearable EEG 
devices reported both in the literature and in the market. As the technology in 
Figure 3.1  Wearable EEG: (a) with thermal energy harvesting [26], (b) with thermal-photovol­
taic energy harvesting [27], and (c) with an antenna for receiving radio frequency power [28].

wearable devices, three-dimensional (3-D) printing, electronics, and wireless 
communications advances, more energy harvesting-powered devices that are 
comfortable to wear are expected to increase in the market.
3.1.3  Energy Harvesting in the Context of Ambient-Assisted Living
Deploying an autonomous wireless sensor network in an assistive environment 
minimizes the maintenance cost and complements the primary goal of the 
ambient-assisted living. The use of autonomous wireless systems in an assis­
tive environment is attractive because, in some cases, it avoids the need to use 
cabling and the disruption associated with its installation. Sensor nodes in a 
wireless sensor network (WSN) have limited available energy and they use their 
energy for sensing, computation, and communication. However, they are often 
limited by the reliance on battery power [12]. As a result, batteries will need to 
be either recharged or replaced after a certain time, depending on the energy 
consumption of sensor nodes. Replacing or charging a battery is often cumber­
some [29], particular for elderly or disabled people and over time, the cost of 
maintaining the WSN increases. As ambient-assisted living is targeting to re­
duce the cost of supporting elderly people, it is essential that the WSN within 
assistive environment should be implemented in such a way that it reduces the 
maintenance cost.
3.2  Case Study: Wearable Emotion Sensor Node Powered by 
Energy Harvesting
3.2.1  System Overview
The headband presented in chapter consists of the following parts: (1) EEG 
front end that consists of active electrodes and an EEG amplifier, (2) a wireless 
microcontroller, and (3) an energy harvester. The active electrodes are used for 
detection of EEG signal from the scalp, which is then amplified by the EEG 
amplifier before it is being converted into digital form by an analog-to-digital 
converter integrated into the wireless microcontroller. The wireless microcon­
troller is used to preprocess and classify emotion in real time and then transmit 
the detected emotion wirelessly to the computer. The energy harvester is used to 
convert ambient light energy into electricity for powering active electrodes, the 
EEG amplifier and the wireless microcontroller. Figure 3.2 shows the system 
overview and interaction of building parts of the headband.
3.2.2  EEG Electrodes
The EEG electrodes used in this case study were designed by Paul et al. [30]. 
Each electrode consists of a buffer amplifier integrated within the electrode 

48 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
and the entire electrode is screen printed on one side of a textile. This design is 
shown in Figure 3.3.
As shown in Figure 3.3(a), an interface layer is printed to provide a 
smooth flat base on which subsequent layers can be printed. This is followed by 
a printed conductive layer to realize tracks to provide circuit connections for the 
buffer amplifier. Three lines are used to supply the power and a signal path to 
and from the electrode. Electronic components (a 10-nF capacitor, 100-Ω resis­
tor, 200-kΩ resistor, and TLC 727 operational amplifier) were then attached to 
the printed circuit layout using silver-loaded epoxy adhesive. After the compo­
nents were attached, the circuit was then encapsulated with a stencil printed di­
electric to prevent electrical contact between the buffer amplifier circuit and the 
conductive encapsulation, as shown in Figure 3.3(b). Finally, the electrode was 
covered with a stencil printed conductive encapsulation composed of carbon-
loaded rubber, which creates an electrical connection between the skin surface 
and the electrode surface, as shown in Figure 3.3(c). More details about the 
printing process and inks used can be found in [30]. 
3.2.3  EEG Amplifier
Typically, raw EEG signals have amplitude ranging from 10 μV to 100 μV 
when measured on the scalp [31]. Therefore, it is necessary to amplify these 
signals to a suitable level for conversion from analog to digital form. To achieve 
this, a low power EEG amplifier was implemented to amplify signals from the 
EEG sensors before converting into digital form. The designed EEG amplifier 
has two channels and each channel has a low-power precision instrumentation 
amplifier (IA), INA333 [32] from Texas Instrument, passive highpass filter, op­
erational amplifier, MCP6044 [33] from Microchip, followed by another pas­
sive highpass filter, and finally a third-order lowpass filter. Both INA333 and 
Figure 3.2  System block diagram.

 
Solar Cell-Powered Sensor Node 
49
the MCP6044 were selected because they operate with a single-supply voltage 
at a low voltage of 1.8V with low current (50 μA for INA333 and 0.6 μA/
Amplifier for MCP6044). This electronic design was adopted from the open-
source, low-cost EEG project [34] with slight modifications to minimize power 
consumption.
The instrumentation amplifier is used to attenuate the power line noise by 
means of high common mode rejection, thus avoiding attenuation of EEG sig­
nal by providing a higher input impedance than human skin. The EEG signal 
once amplified by the instrumentation amplifier is then highpass filtered with a 
cutoff frequency of 0.16 Hz to filter out any dc offset to avoid overdriving the 
next stages. The signal is then amplified with an adjustable gain ranging from 
8 to 350 and then is highpass filtered again. Finally, the signal is filtered with 
the third-order Butterworth lowpass filter with a cutoff frequency of 49 Hz to 
mitigate the antialiasing effects resulting from the analog-to-digital conversion.

Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
3.2.4  Wireless Microcontroller
An Atmega 256RFR2 [35] was used in this case study as a wireless microcon­
troller. This is an 8-bit system on chip wireless microcontroller that supports 
both ZigBee [36] and IEEE 802.15.4 [37] communication protocols and it 
has low power consumption. Figure 3.4 shows the EEG amplifier connected 
to the wireless microcontroller; this configuration of the EEG front end and 
the wireless microcontroller will now be referred to as the wireless sensor node 
throughout this chapter.
On a typical wireless sensor node, more than 40% of energy is consumed 
by the transceiver during data transmission [26]. Unlike typical sensors such 
as temperature sensors, wearable EEG sensor nodes potentially consume sig­
nificant energy because many EEG signal samples have to be collected, for ex­
ample, for a duration of 1 second, as at least 128 samples need to be collected 
and transmitted from each EEG channel for emotion detection. Therefore, to 
reduce the energy consumption of the wearable EEG sensor node, EEG sig­
nal preprocessing and emotion detection were performed on board and only 
the detected emotions were transmitted wirelessly. This was achieved by im­
plementing a real-time emotion detection system using artefact removal and 
emotion classification algorithms. A reader is referred to [38, 39] for in-depth 
discuss of these preprocessing and classification algorithms.
The average current drawn by the wireless sensor node and four active 
electrodes was 9.94 mA over a 2-second period during signal acquisition from 
two EEG channels, signal processing, data transmission, and sleeping. Other 
electrical specifications of the sensor node are given in Table 3.1.
3.2.5  Energy Harvester Design
An energy harvester was designed using commercially available solar panels, 
Schottky diodes, super capacitors, and a power management chip. Four flexible 
solar panels, SP4.2-37 [40] from PowerFilm, were used, each with dimensions 
Figure 3.4  EEG amplifier-attached ATMEGA256RFR2-based board.

 
Solar Cell-Powered Sensor Node 
51
of 37 mm by 84 mm. At full sunlight, one solar panel can supply a voltage of 
4.2V and a current of 22 mA. Solar panels were connected in a series-parallel 
combination, as shown in Figure 3.5, to increase both the charging voltage and 
current (series connection increases the output voltage, and parallel connection 
increases supply current capacity). 
In low light conditions, the voltage generated by the solar panels can be 
lower than the voltage stored in the super capacitors. This will cause the super 
capacitors to discharge through the solar panels. Therefore, Schottky diodes 
D1 and D2 were used to prevent this. In practice, those solar panels receiving 
lower light levels will have higher internal resistances than those in higher light 
levels and this will reduce the flow of current from them. Therefore, diodes

Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
D3 through D6 are used to bypass any panel that might have a higher internal 
resistance. 
Three super capacitors were used to store the energy harvested by solar 
cell. Each super capacitor has a capacitance of 3.3 F with a maximum voltage 
of 2.5V, and they are connected in series as shown in Figure 3.5. This makes 
a capacitor bank with equivalent capacitance of 1.1F (series connection) with 
a maximum voltage of 7.5V. To avoid damaging the capacitors, this capacitor 
bank should not be charged beyond the maximum rating of 7.5V. The solar 
panel combination can supply a maximum charging voltage of 8.2V at full sun­
light. However, for an indoor environment, they are unlikely to supply a voltage 
beyond 7.5V and the power management unit will not allow the capacitor bank 
to charge beyond 5.05V. 
The power management unit (PMU) used in this energy harvester is an 
LTC3588 from Linear Technology, which supports input voltages from 2.7V 
to 20V and selectable output voltages that can be set to 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V, or 3.6 
V; it can supply up to 100 mA of continuous output current. The PMU output 
voltage is 0V when its input voltage (e.g., from a storage device) is below 3.67V. 
Its output voltage will be the selected output voltage when its input voltage is 
above 5.05V. For this application, the PMU’s output voltage was set to 3.3V as 
a supply for the wearable EEG sensor node. Therefore, the PMU supplies 3.3V 
to the wearable EEG sensor node as soon as the voltage in the storage device 
(i.e., the supercapacitors reaches 5.05V). As the supercapacitor bank discharges 
and their voltage falls below 3.67V, the PMU output voltage drops to 0V, thus 
switching the wearable EEG sensor node off until sufficient energy can be har­
vested to increase the supercapacitor bank voltage above 5.05V again. 
For this specific application, the wearable EEG sensor node was always 
connected to the output of the PMU and this prevented the super capacitor 
bank from charging above 5.05V. This caused the maximum charge in the su­
per capacitor bank to always remain below 70% of its capacity and this further 
protected the capacitor bank form charging beyond 7.5V. 
3.2.6  Integration of Electrodes and Energy Harvester on the Headband
EEG electrodes and the energy harvester were integrated on an elastic headband 
shown in Figure 3.6.
The elastic headband serves two functions: (1) to provide force on the 
electrodes that increases the stability of the electrode contact with the skin and 
hence reduces the artifacts, which result from electrode movements; and (2) to 
enable the headband to be stretchable and hence fit people with various head 
circumferences. The maximum length of the headband was 60 cm, which is 
more than the average circumference of the human head (53.4 ± 0.8 cm for 
females and 56.9 ± 2.7 cm for males [41]). On one side of the headband, four 

 
Solar Cell-Powered Sensor Node 
53
flexible solar panels, supercapacitors, and the PMU were attached. On the other 
side, five EEG electrodes printed on fabric and then, sewn on another fabric, 
were attached (see Figure 3.6). The total weight of the headband with the en­
ergy harvester integrated was 165g.
3.3  Results and Discussion
3.3.1  Energy-Harvester Testing Results
The evaluation of the performance of the energy harvester was performed by 
first characterizing two solar panels connected in series and then into a variable 
load resistance. This determined the output voltage and current of the solar 
panels at load resistances ranging from 30Ω to 1 MΩ. The measurements were 
carried out in a laboratory fitted with fluorescent lights. To determine the per­
formance of the energy harvester at various light levels, the measurement were 
taken at different locations within the laboratory, with average light levels of 
135, 658, and 800 lux with standard deviations of 1.42, 2.26, and 17.65 lux, 
respectively. The measurement results are shown in Figures 3.7 and 3.8.
Second, the performance of the entire energy harvester was evaluated 
while connected to the load of the wearable EEG sensor node. The superca­
pacitors were fully discharged before starting the voltage measurements to de­
termine the charging time. The capacitors were charged by solar panels at light 
level of 870 lux up to 5.05V before discharging down to 3.67V through the 
Figure 3.6  Headband with solar panels, energy storage, power management unit, and active 
electrodes.

load. Figure 3.9 shows the charging and discharging cycles of supercapacitors 
and the output supplied from the PMU to the wearable EEG sensor node.
The experimental results show that the supercapacitor’s initial charging, 
from 0V to 5.05V, takes 6,684 seconds (just under 2 hours) at an average am­
bient light of 870 ± 20 lux at room temperature. This charging time decreases 
to 1,654 seconds (about 30 minutes) when charged from 3.67V, which is the 
minimum voltage at which the PMU disconnects the load from the harvester. 
Details of one charging and discharge cycle shown in a rectangular shape in 
Figure 3.9 are shown in Figure 3.10.
As the lower graph of Figure 3.10 shows, the PMU supplies current to 
the load once the voltage stored in the supercapacitors reaches 5.05V. Then 
supercapacitors discharged are through the load for 176 seconds. During this 
discharge cycle, the wearable sensor node performs the following 2-second se­
quence: signal acquisition for 1 second, signal processing to detect emotions for 
158 ms, and transmitting the detected emotion for 15 ms and then the sleep 
mode for 827 ms. This 2-second sequence is repeated until the supercapacitors 
are discharged to 3.67V, at which point the PMU switch off the supply current 
to the wearable EEG sensor node, thus switching it off.
The energy stored in supercapacitors during charging from 3.67V to 
5.05V can be estimated as

where I is the current drawn by the load, V is voltage applied to the load, and 
t is the time. The energy difference (847 mJ) is due to energy loss within the 
supercapacitors due to leakage current, equivalent internal resistances, and the 
energy loss in PMU due to conversion efficiency.
The energy given in (3.2) was consumed while the wearable EEG sensor 
node was sensing, processing and transmitting detected emotion at intervals of 
2 seconds. If the intervals are increased to 30 seconds, then the sleeping time 
of the wearable EEG sensor node is increased to 28.827 seconds (28 seconds + 
827 ms) and the average current consumption drops to approximately 0.7 mA 
(9.94 mA × 2 seconds/30 seconds). Therefore, the same energy given in (3.2) 
will be used for the duration of 2,499 seconds as given in (3.3):

The time given in (3.3) is longer than the total charging and discharge 
time shown in Figure 3.10, meaning that the harvested energy under the same 
light conditions is sufficient to enable continuous emotion detection at 30-sec­
ond intervals without requiring charge cycles during which the device is not 
active.
3.3.2  Real-Time Emotion Experiment Results
A real-time emotion monitoring experiment was set up to further test the 
performance of the wearable headband. Two sensors on the headband were 
positioned at Fp1 and Fp2 to record the EEG signal from the left and right 
hemispheres of the human head. A reference sensor was positioned at T4 and 
another sensor for the driven right leg was positioned at T3 as defined by the 
10-20 international standards of electrode placement on the human head. Fp1 
and Fp2 are located on the forehead, above the left and right eyes, respectively. 
These positions were selected because they have no hair which might affect the 
conductivity between the electrode and skin contact. T3 and T4 are located 
near to the left and right ears, respectively. These sensors were connected to the 
wireless microcontroller via the EEG amplifier, previously shown in Figure 3.3. 
The wireless microcontroller is designed to process and transmit the detected 
emotion to the computer through a wireless sensor network. 
In the experiment, 12 subjects (5 female and 7 male) participated and 
each subject was requested to wear the headband and sit in front of a computer 
screen. A sequence of 24 pictures was semirandomly selected to avoid repeating 
the same picture and selecting pictures for inducing the same type of emotion 
from a pool of 40 pictures and was displayed on the screen. Twelve of these 
pictures were used to induce positive emotions and the other 12 were used to 
induce negative emotions. These pictures were obtained from the Geneva affec­
tive picture database ����������������������������������������������������������
[42],�����������������������������������������������������
 which is a collection of more than 700 picture stim­
uli for inducing emotions managed by the University of Geneva. Each picture 
was displayed for a duration of 5 seconds, and within this time, the EEG signal 
from two channels was recorded for 1 second as emotion responses last for just 
a few milliseconds [43]. This was followed by a rating page, where the subject 
selected the type of emotion (positive or negative) that the stimuli induced. Af­
ter rating, a blank screen was displayed for 5 seconds; any duration longer than 
1 second is sufficient [43] to reset the subject’s emotion [20] before displaying 
the next stimulus. This experimental protocol is detailed in Figure 3.11.
As Figure 3.11 shows, the rating of emotions are induced after the picture 
stimulus is displayed. Therefore, the EEG recording, which is performed when 
the picture stimulus is displayed, does not interfere with signals generated dur­
ing emotion rating (e.g., while using mouse to click the rating button, or finger 
movements).

58 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
To enable real-time emotion classification, the first 16 pictures were used 
to automatically train the algorithm, followed by 8 pictures that were used to 
classify emotion. Twelve subjects participated in the experiment and the result 
is shown in Figure 3.12 for every subject. An average classification accuracy of 
90% ± 9% was obtained from the empirical experiment from all subjects. 
3.4  Conclusions
This chapter has presented a headband integrated with active electrodes and 
solar panels. The fabricated electrodes have the advantage of easy integration to 
the wearable headband as they are fabricated on a fabric and do not require the

application of gel, which is time-consuming to apply and can cause skin irrita­
tion to some people.
Empirical results show that the solar panels integrated onto the headband 
can harvest sufficient energy for electronics integrated into fabricated active 
electrodes as well as the designed EEG amplifier used to amplify EEG signals 
and the wireless microcontroller used to process and detect emotions. The solar 
panels can harvest and store 6,620 mJ of energy in the supercapacitors for 1,654 
seconds, and this energy can be used by the headband for 176 seconds while 
detecting emotions at intervals of 2 seconds. If the emotion detection interval 
is increased to 30 seconds, the same energy will be sufficient for continuous 
emotion detection. 
As a proof of concept, the solar powered headband was used in real-time 
emotion detection experiment. The experiment was conducted to evaluate the 
performance of headband and classification algorithm has shown that a clas­
sification accuracy of 90% ± 9% can be achieved for subject dependent clas­
sification. This result is higher than our previously reported results in [39] using 
the same algorithms due to mitigation of subject intervariability by training the 
classifier from individual subjects at the beginning of each experiment. We be­
lieve that the wearable headband presented in this case study can be used as an 
effective tool for real-time emotion monitoring, particularly for evaluating well-
being and quality of life of assisted people in ambient-assistive environments.
Having proved the concept, further research is required to reduce the 
overall size of the headband by reducing the size of the electronic components 
used. The electronic components used in this work were deliberately selected 
to have a large footprint to increase the chances of successful implementation 
and testing of the headband prototype. Reducing the overall size of these com­
ponents will produce a more comfortable self-powered wearable headband for 
emotion monitoring and other related applications.
In conclusion, this chapter has demonstrated the potential of harvesting 
indoor light energy for powering low-power electronics system including wear­
able devices. As a number of applications of sensors in building infrastructure 
increases, solar powered electronic systems are expected to increase. This will be 
achieved because solar cells are becoming cheaper and more efficient. In addi­
tion, energy required for electronics systems is progressively getting lower due 
to advances in semiconductor technology. These will result into solar powered 
autonomous systems both for indoor and outdoor applications.

Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting and 
Power Management Circuit Design

4.1  Introduction
Thermoelectric energy-harvesting technology is a promising method that con­
verts the industrial or ambient waste heat into electricity. In industrial scenarios, 
such as production line, pipeline, and machine-monitoring applications, heat 
or temperature difference can often be found and potentially used as energy 
sources for electronics in many cases. With wireless sensors and other Internet 
of Things (IoT) devices moving towards milliwatt or even microwatt ultralow 
power consumption in recent years, harvested energy from temperature dif­
ferences are becoming more likely a reliable energy source to power these IoT 
devices. 
This chapter introduces the thermoelectric energy-harvesting materials, 
structures, and devices and power management circuit design. The thermo­
electric energy-harvesting techniques introduced in this chapter are limited to 
low-temperature applications (<200oC). The harvested power is on the scale of 
milliwatts for typical wireless sensor power supply scenarios. 
4.2  Thermoelectric Device
Thermoelectric energy harvesting is based on the Seebeck effect [1]. This basic 
thermoelectric effect describes a phenomenon that generates voltage difference 
when temperature gradient is applied across two series-connected dissimilar

Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
materials. In terms of application, the Seebeck effect (electricity generation) 
is far less used than the reverse thermoelectric effect, the Peltier effect, which 
converts the electricity energy into the temperature difference [2]. Peltier cool­
ing is a very common thermal control method widely used in central processing 
unity (CPU) and integrated circuit (IC) cooling, but Seebeck electricity genera­
tion has only rediscovered its usage in recent years due to the development of 
energy-harvesting technologies [3]. 
The structure of a typical vertical thermoelectric generator (TEG) module 
is illustrated in Figures 4.1 and 4.2. When a temperature difference is applied 
cross the P-N types of TEG couple, voltage potential is generated on the TEG 
couple. From the structure of TEG, it is easy to observe that no moving part is 
needed in Seebeck electricity generation. This advantage significantly reduces 
the maintenance cost of such a power supply system. The simple structure of 
TEG is scalable to the microelectromechanical system (MEMS) and nanoscale.
The voltage generated from a P-N pair is determined by the temperature 
difference and Seebeck coefficient.

where TH is the hot side temperature and TC is the cold side temperature. Cur­
rently, a typical commercial-off-the-shelf TEG module features a ZT around 0.6 
to 0.7 in room temperature. This was achieved by Bi2Se2-xTe3 type material in 
the late 1960s [4]. MEMS and nano-TEGs have been proposed in recent years. 
Although the MEMS-based TEG adopts material similar to that used in con­
ventional machined TEG, due to the large numbers of the thermo-couples, the 
voltage output of MEMS-based TEG increases significantly [5]. Designated for 
powering miniaturized wireless sensor nodes, the TEG module and its heat sink 
are inherently small in the form factor. The temperature difference available on 
a conventional heat sink in such condition is also small (<10°C from a <100°C 
heat source). With a relatively low temperature difference and limited thermo­
couple size, further power conditioning is essential to the energy-harvesting 
system design [6].
For a single pair of thermo-elements, the output power can be expressed 
as

Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
The thermoelectric modules are devices designed for thermoelectric ener­
gy generation. In most cases, thermoelectric module consists of a large number 
of thermo-elements to increase the voltage and power output. The number of 
thermo-elements within a TEG ranges from tens and hundreds in conventional 
machined TEGs to several thousands in the MEMS-based TEGs. Different 
from single pair of thermo-elements, several practical factors need to be consid­
ered in thermoelectric module.
The first factor is the increased number of thermo-elements. To include 
several hundreds or thousands of thermo-elements, the layout shown in Figure 
4.3 is commonly used in TEG designs. The connection of the P-element and 
the N-element is through metal contact layers. Copper contact layers are most 
frequently used for their low resistivity. 
The copper contact layers are arranged as shown in Figure 4.3 to achieve 
series connections.
The second factor is the ceramic thermal substrate and thermal interface 
layer. On both sides of the thermo-elements, a thin layer of ceramic is used to 
physically support the thermo-elements and metal contacts. To obtain enough 
structural strength to avoid physical damage to the device, the thickness of the 
ceramic layer normally exceeds 0.5 mm. With a total thickness higher than 
1 mm (two substrates, one on cold side, one on hot side), the impact on the 
Figure 4.3  Thermoelectric module typical structure and key parameters.

heat transfer on the thermo-elements is no longer negligible. With a signifi­
cantly reduced thermo-element height (10 to 100 µm) as shown in Figure 4.4, 
the impact on the MEMS-based TEG is particularly obvious [7] (the substrate 
thickness is more than 10 times larger than the thickness of thermo-elements, 
for example, substrate = 500 µm and thermo-elements = 20 µm). 
The third factor is the increased internal electrical resistance. With the 
large number of thermo-elements and metal connect layers, the internal resis­
tance of the TEG also increased. Both the thermo-elements electrical conduc­
tivity and metal contacts conductivity are important to the output power. The 
main parameters of TEG are summarized in Table 4.1.
The temperature variation in a steady-state (heat transfer q is constant) 
TEG module is shown in Figure 4.5. When the heat transfer on the substrate is 
considered, the definition of thermo-elements temperature difference changed. 
The more accurate estimation of temperature difference on the thermo-ele­
ments is the T
Δ
′ value on the inside of the substrates.
Based on the heat transfer, the relationship between T

when considering the case with MEMS (and nanowire/tube) thermo-elements 
used in TEG, the thickness of thermo-elements L will decrease significantly 
while the substrate thickness LS remains at the same scale as that in a bulk 
material-based design. This effect may substantially reduce the output voltage 
on TEG as shown in the voltage output in (4.9). Although a high number of 
thermo-elements N will be available in MEMS-based TEG design, the internal 
resistance will be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the convention­
ally machined TEG.  
4.3  Thermoelectric Energy-Harvesting Power Management
Power management of thermoelectric energy harvesting is an important part of 
the energy-harvesting power supply system. In this section, the thermoelectric-
related power management concepts and methods are introduced.
4.3.1  Power Management System Structure
The main focus of managing the TEG-supplied power is to change the low-
voltage, unregulated power into higher voltage and regulated output for the 
IoT device. Two types of power management circuits are suitable for this type of 
application: charge pump converter and boost converter (or other topologies) 
step-up dc-dc switching regulator. 
In addition to the step-up dc-dc converter, energy storage units, such as 
supercapacitor and/or rechargeable battery, provide the energy buffer for the 
wireless sensor node. To supply the wireless sensor node with stable output 
voltage, a voltage regulator, such as a buck converter or low-dropout device 
(LDO), is used. Figure 4.7 shows a typical power management circuit for TEG 
or a low-voltage solar cell.
4.3.2  Charge Pump Converter
Charge pump converters use ceramic or electrolytic capacitors as the energy 
storage unit to transfer energy and create a target voltage at the output. Charge 
pumps are often good choice for powering an application that requires low 
power and low voltage with a good simplicity. By using a capacitor as energy 
storage instead of the inductive energy storage element, the charge pump con­

verter has the advantages of a small circuit board area and lower cost. However, 
it also brings the issues in related to the limited output/input voltage ratio and 
capacitor voltage change rate.
A typical charge pump circuit (in a voltage doubler configuration) is 
shown in Figure 4.8. It integrates switches, control circuits, and an oscillator 
(clock) so that the switches S1, S4 and S2, S3 work alternately. By closing S1 
and S4, the current I charges fly the capacitor, CFLY, in the first half-cycle as 
shown in Figure 4.9. The voltages on CIN and CFLY are equal to VIN.
Figure 4.7  Typical thermoelectric energy-harvesting power management system structure.
Figure 4.8  Single-stage charge pump circuit in a voltage doubler configuration.

72 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
In the second half-cycle, S2 and S3 close while S1 and S4 open as shown 
in Figure 4.10. This connects CFLY and CIN capacitors in series on the same po­
larity, which “doubles” the input voltage VIN. This double voltage is connected 
in parallel with COUT and gives a VOUT = 2 × VIN.
In Figure 4.8, the charge pump circuit does not feature an output regula­
tion circuit, and the switching frequency remains constant for all loads. Thus, 
the output-voltage variation depends strongly on the load. Instead, regulated 
charge pumps shown in Figure 4.11 can provide a stable output voltage from a 
varied input supply, which is ideal for thermoelectric operated devices.
This type of regulated charge pump circuit overcomes the lack of regula­
tion by adding linear regulation circuit or charge-pump modulation circuit. 
Figure 4.9  Charge pump circuit first half-cycle.
Figure 4.10  Charge pump circuit second half-cycle.

	
Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting and Power Management Circuit Design 
73
Linear regulation offers the lowest output noises. Charge-pump modulation 
(which controls the switch resistance) offers more output current for a given die 
size (or cost), because the IC need not include a series pass transistor.
The Seiko Instruments S8821 and S882Z (block diagram shown in Fig­
ure 4.12) charge pumps are typical ICs that can be used for thermoelectric en­
ergy harvesting for its low-voltage, step-up conversion. For S882Z, the minimal 
input voltage is as low as 0.3V, which is the typical voltage value for many TEG 
modules output voltage. The small-form factor capacitors can be used for this 
IC, which significantly reduces the PCB board size. For applications require 
compact form factor, charge pump-based thermoelectric energy-harvesting so­
lution is necessary.
However, the efficiency of charge pump, especially for a multiple-stage 
charge pump, in the TEG application is limited. For example, the Seiko Instru­
ments S882Z has a measured maximum conversion efficiency of 35% when the 
input voltage is 0.35V. The IoT device often has a supply voltage between 2.5V 
to 5V. The step-up conversion ratio (output and input voltage ratio) is between 
7 and 15 for a 0.3-V TEG device output. For IC designs, it is also challenging 
to design a multiple-stage charge pump (>10 stages) with good conversion ef­
ficiency, due to the stage efficiency loss aggregations.
4.3.3  Step-Up DC-DC Switching Regulator
An inductor-based switching regulator is able to provide a >90% efficiency in 
many application scenarios. A switching regulator rapidly switches a series de­
Figure 4.11  Charge pump circuit with regulated output voltage.

74 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
vice on and off. The switch’s duty cycle sets the amount of charge transferred to 
the load. This is controlled by a feedback mechanism similar to that of a linear 
regulator. Switching regulators are efficient because the series element is either 
fully conducting or switched off because it dissipates almost no power. Switch­
ing regulators are able to generate output voltages that are higher than the input 
voltage or of opposite polarity, unlike linear regulators.
There are many types of topologies can be found in switching regulators 
design. For thermoelectric energy-harvesting applications, the main require­
ment is to step up the TEG output voltage to a useable voltage for the wireless 
sensor node and other IoT devices. This type of application meant that the 
main needs are the step-up conversion and impedance matching for maximum 
power transfer. For step-up conversion, many types of dc-dc converter topolo­
gies such as boost, buck-boost, and fly-back converters can perform a voltage 
boost operation.
Most commonly used topology in this application is the boost topology. 
The structure of typical boost converter is shown in Figure 4.13. During the 
initial high period of the square wave applied to the MOSFET gate at startup, 
Q1 is switched on. Current flows through L1 and voltage across L1 are VL (pos­
itive: left to negative: right) and energy transfers are from CIN to L1. During 
Figure 4.12  Commercially off the shelf charge pump IC.

	
Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting and Power Management Circuit Design 
75
this time, MOSFET conducts, placing a short circuit from the right side of L1 
to the negative input supply terminal. Therefore, a current flows between the 
positive and negative supply terminals through L1, which stores energy in its 
magnetic field. There is virtually no current flowing in the remainder of the 
circuit as the combination of D1, COUT, and the load represents a much higher 
impedance than the path directly through the heavily conducting MOSFET. 
When the control voltage applied to MOSFET gate is low, the MOSFET 
is switched off. As the MOSFET is rapidly turned off, the sudden drop in cur­
rent causes L1 to produce a back electromotive force (e.m.f.) in the opposite 
polarity to the voltage across L1 during the on period to maintain the cur­
rent flowing. This results in two voltages, the supply voltage VIN and the back 
e.m.f. (VL) across L1 in series with each other. The resulting current through D1 
charges up COUT to VIN +VL minus the small forward voltage drop across diode 
D1 and also supplies the load. 
A variation of this type of boost converter is to use synchronous switching 
where, instead of using diodes that simply respond to the voltage polarity across 
them, it is controlled by synchronized MOSFETs that perform the switching 
and controls the polarity. The use of the synchronous switch can improve the 
conduction loss performance previously caused by the diode forward voltage 
drop. In a higher-voltage system, such an impact is not as obvious as in a low-
voltage system. For the load voltage (wireless sensor supply voltage) around 
3.0V, the voltage drop on the diode (0.3V to 0.7V) is at least 10% to 20% of 
it. The conduction loss due to diode forward voltage drop is wasted during the 
process.
In addition to the main boost converter, the impedance of the TEG out­
put and power management circuit input must be matched, so the maximum 
power transfer can be achieved. Figure 4.14 shows a maximum power point 
tracking method, which dynamically controls the impedance matching. 
It consists of two parts: maximum power point (MPPT) control circuit 
and pulse with modulated (PWM) generation circuit. The MPPT control cir­
cuit is a logic circuit that calculates how to adjust the duty cycle of the main

boost converter power MOSFET based on input voltage (in some cases both in­
put voltage and current). Various methods are available to perform the calcula­
tion, such as the perturb-and-observe method and the incremental conductance 
method using a microcontroller, as well as the fractional open-circuit voltage 
method using comparators as the control logic circuits. The PWM waveform 
generators create the optimized duty cycle for impedance matching. 
4.4  Conclusions 
Thermoelectric energy harvesting provides an alternative to photovoltaic and 
vibration energy-harvesting techniques. In this case, thermoelectric energy har­
vesting is for the applications of wireless sensors and IoT. The continuous trend 
of lower-power consumption in microcontroller units (MCU), radio frequency 
(RF), and sensor ICs increases the possibility of using energy-harvesting tech­
nologies including thermoelectric energy harvesting (EH). TEG modules, with 
no moving part, have a long lifetime and consistent performance and are ideal 
choices of energy-harvesting sources when a constant temperature difference is 
available. TEG modules have seen a rapid development in recent years, espe­
cially in terms of MEMS and nanotechnology-based devices. However, these 
modules may need several years before they are commercially competitive when 
compared to the mechanical machined TEG modules. 
TEG module power management circuits feature a main function of volt­
age step-up operation. Charge pump and boost type dc-dc converters are prac­
tical power management ICs suitable for this application. Low-power design 
methods, such as the synchronized switch, are able to enhance the efficiency 
of these ICs. In addition to the converter, impedance matching or maximum 
power point tracking methods can improve the energy transfer efficiency. In the 
future, thermoelectric energy harvesting may move towards a miniature TEG 
device through the technology development path of MEMS and nano-TEGs. 
It also started to show a trend towards further integrated, multisource, universal 
energy-harvesting power management IC design.

Inductive Power Transfer and Case Study

5.1  Introduction
Inductive power transfer (IPT) is a promising new approach to the powering 
of remote wireless sensors [1]. IPT technology is already commercially avail­
able for the wireless charging of mobiles devices by placing them on a charging 
surface [2, 3], and high-power systems have been applied for charging of elec­
tric vehicles when they are being parked over a certain charging spot [2]. This 
chapter will investigate some of the design challenges faced when using IPT for 
wireless sensor networks in which the air gap between the transmit and receive 
coils is significantly larger (up to 10m) than for typical IPT applications. 
IPT can deliver significantly more power than ambient energy harvesting 
[e.g., heat, motion, light, and radio frequency (RF)] in many remote-sensing 
scenarios. Despite significant research volume over the last decade, energy har­
vesting in forms other than solar has struggled to realize the required power 
densities to enable true autonomous powering of wireless sensors [4]. Recently, 
ambient RF harvesting has been studied and found that power levels in the 
dense urban environment of London, exhibited no more than a few tens of 
nW/cm2 [5]. Far-ﬁeld power transfer using radiating electromagnetic ﬁelds 
from a dedicated transmitter suffers either from a poor efficiency or a limited 
beamwidth, hence requiring active tracking of the remote device. The regula­
tions limit RF transmit power to significantly lower levels than for inductive 
powering, for reasons of safety and interference with other communications 
systems. An example of a far-field system can be found in [6], where hundreds 
of microwatts could be transmitted over a distance of 1m. Contrastingly, in the

long-range IPT case study, it will be shown that milliwatts can be transferred to 
a load up to 7m from the transmitter.

5.2  Inductive Link Theory 
5.2.1  Principle of Operation of an Inductive WPT System
Figure 5.1 illustrates the principle of operation behind an inductive WPT sys­
tem. The system, in its simplest form, consists of two coils: a transmitting coil 
and a receiving coil. An ac from a power source flowing into the transmitting 
coil will lead it to generate an alternating magnetic field according to the Biot-
Savart law. If the receiving coil is located in the vicinity of the transmitting coil, 
then a certain fraction of the generated alternating magnetic field will enter the 
secondary coil and will induce a voltage across its terminals according to Fara­
day’s law of induction. By then, connecting a load across the terminals of the 
secondary will result in electric current flowing into the load. Hence, power has 
been transferred wirelessly from the power source to the load.
Figure 5.2 shows the general block diagram of a WPT system. Each block 
of the system will be discussed in the following sections.
5.2.2  Modeling and Circuit Theory of Inductive Links
Faraday’s law of induction states that the voltage induced (v) in a coil with 
certain number of turns (N) due to a time-varying magnetic flux (j) that is 
perpendicular to the coil (Figure 5.3) is

It can be found that the mutual inductance M would have the same value 
if the secondary coil the total magnetic flux was generated by the secondary coil 
due to a current flowing in it [7].
The mutual inductance indicates the strength of the magnetic flux that is 
coupled between the primary and secondary coils in comparison with their self-
inductances. The strength of the coupling is usually represented by a parameter, 
k, which is referred to as the coupling coefficient. The coupling coefficient is 
defined as the ratio of the mutual inductance to the self-inductances of the two 
coils, that is,

The coupling coefficient approaches zero when there is no or little cou­
pling between the coils. This occurs, for instance, when the two coils are com­
pletely separated from each other by a large distance or they could be oriented 
such that their axes are orthogonal to each other. The coupling coefficient ap­
proaches unity when there is maximum coupling between the two coils. This 
occurs, for instance, when the two coils are brought into proximity with each 
other.
5.2.3  Coil Construction and Quality Factor 
An inductive powering system operates as a transformer but has at least a part 
of the core removed to enable mobility. The corresponding reduction in cou­
pling factor and hence efficiency can be mitigated to some extent by operating 
the secondary at resonance and choosing an optimal load [8]. Ferromagnetic 
material can be included in the coil design to shape the field and enhance the 
coupling factor at the expense of size, weight, cost, and reliability. Given a set 
of constraints for the coil dimensions and a required transmission distance, the 
link efficiency is often the key parameter that the designer is trying to maxi­
mize, especially for kilowatt applications such as in an electric vehicle charging. 
Parameters such as tolerance to misalignment, shielding, choice of frequency 
and voltage, and current transfer ratios can also be of importance and can have 
a direct effect on the coil design.
Figure 5.5 defines the coil geometries for a typical wireless charging setup 
in which coil 1, of radius r1, transfers power to coil 2, of radius r2, over a dis­
tance x. The link efficiency of an inductive charging system is defined as the 
power delivered to the ac secondary load divided by the power input to the 
primary coil. With the secondary operating at resonance and with the optimal 
load for maximum efficiency, the link efficiency, η, is given by [8]

The coupling factor between air core coils drops to only a few percent 
once the distance between the coils becomes equal to the coil diameter. Hence, 
achieving efficient inductive power transfer over distances further than about 
one coil diameter is very challenging. The powering of remote sensors over 
several meters will thus be inherently inefficient (e.g., the case study long-range 
power transfer system is 0.01% efficient at 6m). Despite most of the energy 
being lost, maximizing link efficiency is still key to meet International Com­
mission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) safety regulations for 
a certain required receiver power. Generally, coupling factor enhancing materi­
als are used to mitigate the rapid decrease in k with distance at the expense of 
weight and cost. In a long-range system, this gives little benefit due to the large 
air gap. An alternative approach is to drive air-core coils at megahertz frequen­
cies where the Q factors are significantly improved.

(5.13)
where w is the angular frequency, L is the coil inductance, and rL is the series 
resistance. For an air-core multiturn circular loop, the losses, represented by rL, 
are due to the internal resistance of the conductor, enhanced by the skin and 
proximity effects, and radiation. These are frequency-dependent such that there 
is an optimal frequency for maximizing the Q given a set of coil dimensions 
(number of turns, N, loop radius, r, and conductor radius, a) [10]. (The loss 
models for cored coils are more complex as the losses of the core must also be 
taken into account.)
The resistive loss, rL, increases with the square root of frequency and, tak­
ing into account only the skin effect, it can be approximated as:

The inductance remains almost constant with frequency assuming opera­
tion significantly below the self-resonant frequency because it is mainly deter­
mined by the external inductance of the coil. At low frequency, the radiation 
resistance is negligible but increases with frequency to the power four such that 
the maximum coil Q corresponds to the point at which the radiation begins to 
dominate over the internal heat loss as shown in Figure 5.7. Up until this point, 
the Q increases with the square root of frequency and for a helix coil, taking 
into account only losses due to skin effect, the Q can be can be approximated by

For air-core coils of typical dimensions’ tens of centimeters to 1m, the 
optimal frequency is in the low megahertz region. In the case of asymmetric 
coils, this optimal frequency is mainly determined by the larger of the two coils, 
as this will begin to radiate at a lower frequency. Equation (5.16) also shows 
that increasing the conductor radius improves the Q factor. This can be done 
without a prohibitive increase in cost or weight, taking advantage of the skin 
depth being only tens of microns at these frequencies hollow copper pipes for 
the coil conductors. Q factors of over 1,000 can be achieved using the tech­
niques in [11].
However, designing power electronics to operate efficiently at these fre­
quencies is a significant challenge and requires the use of soft-switch converters. 
Fortunately, recent years have also seen wide bandgap semiconductors become 
available that can switch quickly, have low conduction loss, and handle large 
voltages and currents enabling the more efficient operation of high-speed reso­
nant converters.
5.2.4  Resonant Coupling
The amount of power that can be transferred from the primary coil to the 
secondary coil at a certain frequency depends of the reactance of the secondary 
coil’s self-inductance and the load connected to it. If a fixed ac source is used 
to drive the primary coil, then the real power delivered to the secondary coil 
will be inversely proportional to the total impedance of the secondary coil [8]. 
The power delivered can be increased if the impedance of the secondary coil 
is reduced or eliminated. This can be done by connecting a capacitor (Cs ) in a 
Figure 5.7  Q versus frequency for 3-turn coil of 10-cm radius.

88 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
series or parallel connection with the coil and the load as shown in Figure 5.8. 
The reactance of the capacitor should be set such that the total impedance of 
the secondary coil side is purely resistive and equal to the load resistance. For a 
series-tuned lossless secondary coil, the value of Cs is given by

The choice between using series or parallel tuning depends on the frequen­
cy of operation, the secondary coil’s self-inductance, and the load resistance. 
5.2.4.1  Load Optimization
In Section 2.3, it was indicated that in a practical WPT system the primary and 
secondary coils are not lossless and therefore have certain Q factors that depend 
on their frequency of operation, their geometries, and how they are construct­
ed. As a result, the link efficiency will vary depending on the load resistance. As 
initially indicated in (5.11), it is possible to find an optimum value for the load 
resistance such that the link efficiency is maximized at certain coupling coef­

secondary.

ficient. The derivation of the equations for finding the optimal load resistance 
is explained in detail in [8] for a mid-range WPT system (k > 0.01). It should 
be noted that the optimal load resistance for a long-range system, which can 
be described by having a coupling coefficient below 0.01, begins to approach 
output impedance of the secondary coil. The maximum power transfer opera­
tion occurs when the load resistance is equal to the output impedance of the 
secondary coil.
5.3  Primary-Side Coil Drivers
5.3.1  Introduction
Primary-side coil drivers are electronic circuits that drive the primary or trans­
mitting coil of an inductive link with sinusoidal current to generate an alter­
nating magnetic field. Because in most electrical systems the electrical energy 
is supplied from a dc voltage source, such as a battery or rectified mains, a dc/
ac inverter is required to create a sinusoidal current. IPT systems may require 
large amounts of power to be converted and transferred at high efficiencies. The 
conversion of a dc voltage to an ac voltage is not an ideal process and certain 
amount of power is lost. Consequently, the dc/ac inverter in an IPT system can 
be one of the major contributing factors in reducing the overall efficiency. As 
a result, when designing the dc/ac inverter, one should try minimize its losses. 
This would imply that a switched-mode inverter should be used since theoreti­
cal efficiency is 100%. 
The coils in an IPT system are generally operated at either series or paral­
lel resonance; therefore, the current produced by the dc/ac inverter has to be 
sinusoidal. This would require the use of passive networks consisting of capaci­
tors and inductors. The switching frequency of the dc/ac inverter is chosen to 
be equal to or near or the resonant frequency or a harmonic of the passive 
networks. The switching of the inverter produces a series of voltage or current 
pulses. The pulses are passed to the passive networks, which filter out most of 
the pulses’ unwanted frequency components. 
In practice, the efficiency of a switched mode is far from being 100%. 
One of the common loss mechanisms in switched-mode circuits is the switch­
ing losses. These losses can be minimized by ensuring the switches of the in­
verter are turned on and off at either or both zero-voltage and zero-current. This 
can be done by carefully choosing the values of the passive networks’ compo­
nents, the switching frequency, and its duty cycle. A typical efficiency range for 
multimegahertz switched-mode inverters with zero-voltage switching (ZVS) or 
zero-current switching (ZCS) is between 85% and 95%.
There is extensive ongoing research in developing switched-mode dc/ac 
inverters that are capable of achieving good efficiencies and multimegahertz 

90 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
switching frequencies. Most of the inverters that can be found in the literature 
have been classified into classes depending on the switching conditions of the 
voltages and currents developed across the switches at turn-on and turn-off. It 
can be concluded that the majority of the inverters that have been used in IPT 
systems are based on two topologies: Class D and Class E. This section will 
review some of the Class D and Class E inverters, their principle of operation 
will be described, and brief mathematical will analysis will be performed. Dif­
ferent circuit configurations for the Class D topology will also be presented and 
discussed.
5.3.2  Definitions
The following definitions are associated with the modeling and analysis of the 
inverters that will be presented in this chapter.
5.3.2.1  Switching Frequency
The switching frequency refers to the frequency at which the switches are 
turned on and off. It can be either supplied from an external signal source such 
as a function generator or generated using an oscillator. Because the switching 
signal is the main driving or forcing signal of the converter, the fundamental 
frequency components of all other voltage and current signals in the converter 
will be equal to it. The symbol ω is used to refer to this frequency and has the 
units in radians per second.
5.3.2.2  Resonant Frequency
To create resonance, the load network of an inverter should consist of at least 
one capacitor (C ) and one inductor (L), in addition to the load resistance (RL ). 
Therefore, the resonant frequency, denoted by ωo, in radians per second of the 
inverter with series RLC load network is

nant frequency. Different modes of operation can be obtained by operating

the inverter at switching frequencies above, below, and equal to the resonant 
frequency.
5.3.2.3  Loaded Quality Factor 
The loaded quality factor, denoted by QL, is defined as the ratio of the maxi­
mum energy stored in the resonant network to the amount of energy dissipated 
in the load  per one cycle of the switching frequency of the inverter. In a series 
RLC network QL is equal to

and for a parallel RLC network QL is equal to

(5.22)
The loaded quality factor in inverters is used as an indication of the mag­
nitude of the harmonics in the output voltage or output current waveforms in 
the load network. A load network with a large loaded quality factor will have 
one dominant harmonic component where its magnitude is significantly larger 
than the rest of the harmonics. Whereas a lower loaded quality factor load net­
work would have a number of harmonics that have relatively small differences 
in their magnitudes. 
5.3.2.4  Power-Output Capability 
The power-output capability, denoted by cp, of an inverter can be defined as 
the ratio of the output power delivered to the load (Pout) produced to the prod­
uct of the maximum voltage and maximum current of the inverter’s switches. 
The power-output capability is given by

(5.23)
The power-output capability of an inverter can be used as an indication 
of cost. For a given output power, an inverter with a low power-output capabil­
ity may require a higher number of switches with relatively large voltage and 
current ratings, whereas an inverter with a high power-output capability may 

92 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
require switches with lower voltage and current ratings. Therefore, the higher 
the power-output capability of and inverter, the lower the implementation cost 
and vice versa. 
The power-output capability can also provide an indication of the effi­
ciency for a certain output power when comparing different inverter topologies 
and configurations with the same number of switches. A higher power-output 
capability means that the inverter will deliver power to the load with lowest 
voltage and current stresses across its switches and hence the power losses that 
are dependent on voltage and current of a switch, such as the switching losses, 
are reduced. Consequently, the efficiency can be higher for inverters with a 
higher power-output capability.
�5.3.3  Class D Inverters
The Class D topology of inverters is one of the most widely used topologies 
when designing dc/ac inverters due to its simple principle of operation, reduced 
implementation and construction costs, and its ability to maintain a high-pow­
er efficiency over a wide load range. Therefore, it has been extensively used as 
the primary coil driver in IPT systems and standards such as the Qi and A4WP 
standards [12]. Class D inverters consist of a pair or more of switches operating 
in a complementary manner and an RLC load network. The switches’ main 
function is to chop voltage or current into a square wave that drives the load 
network. The switching frequency can be equal to, above, or below the resonant 
frequency of the load network. Class D inverters have theoretical efficiency of 
100% because they can achieve either ZVS or ZCS and therefore can be further 
classified into the following two groups.
5.3.3.1  Class D Voltage-Fed Inverters 
The inverters in this category are powered directly from a dc voltage supply 
and employ a series RLC load network. The switches chop the input dc voltage 
into a series of voltage pulses that are then applied across the load network. The 
current flowing in the load network will be near sinusoidal, and its harmonic 
content will depend on the loaded QL of the load network and the ratio of the 
switching frequency to the resonant frequency of the load network. The invert­
ers in this category have the ability to achieve ZCS only at certain modes of 
operation, which will be subsequently discussed.
5.3.3.2  Class D Current-Fed Inverters
The inverters in this category are powered directly from a dc supply and em­
ploy a parallel RLC load network. The switches chop the input dc supply into 
a series of current pulses that drive the load network. The voltage created across 
the load network will be near sinusoidal and its harmonic will depend on the 

 
Inductive Power Transfer and Case Study 
93
loaded QL and the ratio of the switching frequency to the resonant frequency of 
the load network. The inverters in this category have the ability to achieve ZVS 
only at certain modes of operation that will be subsequently discussed.
5.3.3.3  Class D Voltage-Fed Inverters
Figure 5.9(a) shows the basic circuit of a Class D voltage-fed inverter in its 
simplest form and Figure 5.9(b) shows its equivalent circuit. The circuit is also 
referred to as the half-bridge Class D inverter and is one of the most common 
inverter circuits used to IPT systems that operate at frequencies up to 6.78 
MHz. The voltage stress across the switches are the lowest compared to other 
inverter configuration and topologies, its component count is also the lowest, 
and the output voltage across the load RL is constant an independent of the 
loads resistance. 
The circuit consists two switches Q1 and Q2 that operate in a comple­
mentary manner and a series RLC load network. The inductance in the load 
network could represent the transmitter coil’s inductance, consequently this 
configuration does not have any magnetic core requirements and this further 
simplifies its implementation and improves its performance. The switches 
commonly used are N-channel MOSFETs as shown in Figure 5.9. The source

terminal of the lower MOSFET Q1 is reference to ground, whereas the source 
of the upper MOSFET Q2 is floating. Therefore, Q2 will require either a boot­
strap driver circuit or an isolated pulse transformer to be driven.
Despite its numerous features and advantages, this particular configura­
tion may become less efficient for switching frequencies beyond 10 MHz. This 
is because the inductive and capacitive parasitics become more significant at 
higher switching frequencies and will result in degradation of the inverter’s per­
formance and overall efficiency. Additionally, the generation of the gate drive 
signals and achieving the correct switching times become practically difficult to 
implement. 
The basic circuit configuration in Figure 5.10(a) is also widely used in 
numerous applications other than IPT such as dc/dc, audio amplifiers, and 
electronic ballasts. Due to its popularity, many researchers and engineers refer 
to this configuration when mentioning the Class D inverter. Therefore, the 
description and analysis of this configuration will be considered in this section.
5.3.3.4  Analysis
Because this is the commonly used inverter circuits, a brief mathematical analy­
sis will be given here. More mathematical analysis and details can be found in 
[13]. 
Referring to the equivalent circuit in Figure 5.9, the analysis begins with 
the assumption that the switching frequency is close to the resonant frequency 
of the series RLC load and network and the load QL is above 10. As a result, 
the current in the network can be assumed to be sinusoidal which can be rep­
resented as

where f is the amplitude of the load network’s current and  is its phase relative 
to the switching signal of switch Q1. The switching of Q1 and Q2 produces a 
square-wave voltage that alternates between Vi, when Q1 is on and Q2 is off, and 
0V, when Q1 is off and Q2 is on. Therefore, the input voltage (Vn) to the load 
network can represented by

and the maximum voltages across both switches is equal to the input voltage .
By using Fourier series, the voltage across the load network can also be 
represented as

5.3.3.5  Modes of Operation
Figure 5.11 shows the voltage and current waveforms for the Class D half-bridge 
inverter. Depending on the ratio of the switching to the resonant frequency, dif­
ferent modes of operation can be obtained, some of which can achieve ZVS.

below resonance, and (c) operation above resonance.

 
Inductive Power Transfer and Case Study 
99
Referring to Figure 5.11(a), it can be noticed that when the switching 
frequency equals the resonant of the load network, the currents in both switches 
at the moment when they are turned on and off are zero. More specifically, the 
current values of switch Q1 when it is turned on at ωt = 0 and when it is turned 
off at ωt = π are both zero. Similarly, the current values of switch Q2 when it is 
turned on at ωt = π and when it is turned off at ωt = 2π are zero. Consequently, 
the inverter in this mode achieves ZVS and has a theoretical efficiency of 100%.
In practice, operating the Class D half-bridge inverter at exactly its reso­
nance frequency may not be feasible, especially at switching frequencies in the 
megahertz region. The inverter is likely to operate either above or below its reso­
nance frequency. Referring to Figure 5.11(b), when the switching frequency is 
below the resonant frequency, the load network is capacitive the current is has 
a leading phase angle. As a result, the current in the switches is not zero when 
they are either turned on or off. In most cases the implemented switches are 
N-channel MOSFETs that have a body diode. MOSFETs have certain turn-on 
and turn-off times and their body diode has a reverse recovery time. To inves­
tigate the effects of these times on the inverter, let us look in further details at 
the time when Q1 begins to turn off and Q2 begins to turn on, which occurs 
at ωt = π. The current in Q1 at this time is negative. During the turn-off time 
of Q1, the current in it will gradually divert from its drain channel to its body 
diode. As Q2 completes its turn-on time, the current in the body diode of Q1 
will divert again to the drain channel of Q2. Once the current in the body diode 
of Q1 reaches zero and the load current becomes positive, the reverse recovery 
effect takes place. This causes a current to flow from the dc voltage supply 
through the body diode of Q1 and the drain channel of Q2. During the reverse 
recovery time, the dc voltage supply is effectively shorted to ground; therefore, 
a large current spike will flow through both switches. This current spike causes 
an increases power loss and can sometimes lead to permanent damage of the 
switches. As a result, the operation of the inverter below resonance should be 
avoided [13].
Referring to Figure 5.11(c) when the inverter operates above the resonant 
frequency, the load network is inductive and its current has a lagging phase 
angle. As a result, the current in the switches is not zero when they are either 
turned on or off. The effect of the MOSFET’s turn-on and turn-off times and 
its body diode’s reverse recovery time can also be investigated at ωt = π when 
Q1 begins to turn off and Q2 begins to turn on. The current in Q1 is positive at 
this time. During the turn-off time of Q1, its drain channel current begins to 
divert to the body diode of Q2. As Q2 completes its turn-on time, the current 
is diverted again from its body diode to its drain channel. The reverse recov­
ery effect of Q2’s body takes place; however, here the dc voltage supply is not 
shorted because Q1 has turned off. Consequently, no current spikes are gener­
ated and therefore no power is lost. The only power losses that occur here are 

100 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
due to turn-off times and conduction losses. Nevertheless, these power losses 
are relatively low and the inverter in this mode can achieve a high efficiency. 
Efficiencies can range from 85% to 95%.
�5.3.3.6  Class D Voltage-Fed Push-Pull Inverters
The voltage across the load network in the basic Class D configuration varied 
from 0 to Vi. The output power can be quadrupled by using a second nega­
tive dc voltage source (−Vi ) as shown in Figure 5.12(a). This configuration is 
referred to as the Class D push-pull because the voltage across the load network 
is pulled from one rail and pushed to the other rail. Figure 5.12(b) shows an 
alternative configuration that can be used when a second dc voltage supply is 
not only available. The dc input voltage is applied to the center-tap of a trans­
former with 1:1:1 turns ratio. The switching of Q1 and Q2 results in an induced 
voltage induced in the secondary winding that has an amplitude of 2Vi. The 
configuration in Figure 5.12(b) can operate at much higher switching frequen­
cies than that of Figure 5.12(a) because both switches are ground reference; 
therefore, the gate driver and the switching signals are less complex and simpler 
to implement. However, both configurations are limited in power due to the 
Figure 5.12  Class D push-pull circuit configurations: (a) practical circuit, (b) alternative con­
figuration, (c) H-bridge configuration, and (d) equivalent circuit.

 
Inductive Power Transfer and Case Study

requirement of a negative dc supply in Figure 5.12(a) and a transformer in 
Figure 5.12(b). The power-output capability for both configurations is 0.1592.
Figure 5.12(c) shows another configuration referred to as the Class D 
full-bridge or H-bridge. This configuration also presents 2Vi voltage across the 
load network without the need for a negative supply or a transformer. However, 
a second pair of switches is required; hence, the power-output capability is now 
halved to 0.0796. The maximum switching frequency in the H-bridge configu­
ration is limited due to additional requirements to generating the switching 
signals and their associated timings. This configuration is often for high-power 
inverters that operate at hundreds of kilohertz.
The same analysis method that was used in the Class D half-bridge can 
be applied for all of the configurations in Figure 5.12. The voltage and current 
waveforms and the discussion about the modes of operation are similar. 
5.3.3.7  Class D Current-Fed Inverters
Class D inverters can also be current-fed by using a current source or plac­
ing a radio-frequency choke (RFC) after a voltage source. As mentioned in 
the introduction, the load network in current-fed inverters is a parallel RLC 
network and the voltage across it is approximately sinusoidal. Figure 5.13(a) 
shows the circuit diagram of a basic Class D current-fed inverter. Switches Q1 
and Q2 switch the input current Ii between the load network and ground; this 
is equivalent to a square-wave source as shown in Figure 5.13(b). This particular 
configuration is not commonly used as Q2 is floating and can be difficult to 
drive and control. Nevertheless, its equivalent circuit forms the basis for analyz­
ing all current-fed inverters.

The switching of Q1 and Q2 produces a square-wave current that alter­
nates between Ii , when Q2 is on and Q1 is off, and 0 when Q2 is off and Q1 is 
on. Therefore, the input current (In) to the load network can be represented by

By comparing (5.36) and (5.49), it can be noticed that for the Class D 
current-fed inverter delivers up to 24 times the power than the half-bridge Class 
D inverter for the same input voltage and load. However, this means that Class 
D current-fed inverter can be less efficient due to the large currents in the cir­
cuit and consequently the ohmic losses are significant.
Figure 5.11 shows voltage and current waveforms when operating at reso­
nance for the Class D current-fed inverter. It can be noticed that the switches 
achieve ZVS. The power-output capability for this particular configuration is 
0.1592.
5.3.3.9  Class D Current-Fed Push-Pull Inverters
In a similar way to voltage-fed push-pull configuration, the Class D current-fed 
inverters can be used in a push-pull configuration. The Class D current-fed 
push-pull inverter configuration is similar to its voltage-fed push-pull coun­
terpart in terms of construction and principle of operation. Figure 5.14 shows 
two possible configurations, both utilizing RFC chokes to produce a constant 
dc. It should be noted that these push-pull configurations have the same output 

104 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
power as the basic current-fed configuration. This is because the dc driving the 
parallel load network alternates between +Ii /2 and –Ii /2. In Figure 5.14(a) the 
input dc Ii is split in two by the coupled inductors as it enters the load network. 
The coupled inductors each have an inductance of L. In Figure 5.14(b) the load 
network is fed from two current sources via two chokes connected to a single 
dc voltage source. The voltage and current waveforms are shown in Figure 5.15.
The Class D current-fed inverters in general require several large mag­
netic components such as the RFC chokes. Therefore, the inverter’s maximum 
power and switching frequency are limited by the magnetic cores losses in these 
components. In addition, the maximum voltage developed across the switches 
is about three times more than the input voltage. 
5.3.4  Class E Inverters
Class E inverters were first introduced by the Sokals in 1975 [14]. It its basic 
form shown in Figure 5.16(a), the Class E inverter consists of a single switch, a 
shunt capacitor C1 and a series RLC output load network. Capacitor C1 effec­

inductor and (b) using a two chokes and a single inductor.

 
Inductive Power Transfer and Case Study

tively absorbs the output capacitance of the switch and any parasitic capacitance 
in the circuit. Therefore, the Class E inverter can cope with circuit parasit­
ics without degrading its efficiency and performance, unlike other topologies 
were they become limited in their performance as the circuit parasitics become 
predominant. Not only can the Class E inverter operate at ZVS, but also the 
voltage across the switch has a zero slope at the instant at which it is turned 
on. This is referred to as zero-voltage derivative switching (ZDS). Due to this 
feature, the switch can be softly switched on resulting in lower switching losses 
and allowing the inverter to operate efficiently at switching frequencies above 
Figure 5.15  Voltage and current waveforms of the Class D current-fed inverter.

106 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
10 MHz. Therefore, Class E inverters are one of the most commonly inverters 
in IPT systems [11, 15].
However, Class E circuits have complex principle of operation and are 
not simple to design and implement. Also, Class E circuits are mostly load-
dependent; they can only achieve ZVS and ZDS for fixed load value. They are 
not able to maintain ZVS and ZDS once the load varies from its design value. 
As a result, the efficiency and output will degrade accordingly. Class E circuits 
also have higher-voltage stresses and therefore have a lower power-output capa­
bility than other topologies.
5.3.4.1  Analysis
The modeling and analysis of Class E circuits are well documented in the litera­
ture [13, 16]. Here, we will cover the common analysis method used to describe 
the behaviour of the basic Class E inverter [Figure 5.16(a)] and to derive the 
values of its components to achieve ZVS and ZDS.
We begin by first laying out a set of assumptions:
1.	 The transistor and its body diode form an ideal switch whose on resis­
tance is zero, off resistance is infinity, and switching times are zero.
2. The inductance Lf is high enough such that the input current Ii is dc.
3.	  The loaded quality factor of the RLLC2 branch is high enough such 
that the output load current Io in it is sinusoidal with a frequency equal 
Figure 5.16  A typical Class E inverter circuit: (a) practical circuit and (b) equivalent circuit.

 
Inductive Power Transfer and Case Study 
107
to the switching frequency. The resonant frequency of the branch is 
higher than the switching frequency and therefore is inductive.
4.	 The shunt capacitance C1 is assumed to be constant; the switch’s out­
put capacitance and parasitic capacitance are absorbed by C1.
The equivalent circuit in Figure 5.7(b) can be created based on these as­
sumptions. The analysis will be based on a 50% duty cycle operation as it will 
result in highest power-output capability; Class E inverters can be operated at 
other duty cycle values. The switch will be on for the period 0 ≤ ωt < τ, and off 
for the period π ≤ ωt < 2τ. The output current is sinusoidal, that is,

From the above equations, it can be found that the maximum switch volt­
age is 3.562 times the input voltage, and the maximum switch current is 2.862 
times the input current. Figure 5.17 shows the voltage and current waveforms.
To proceed with the analysis, we turn our attention to the load network 
consisting RL, C2, and L. The load network can be represented as shown in Fig­
ure 5.18. It still consists of the load resistance RL, inductance L is now split in 
two, L1 and L2, such that L2 and C2 are now resonant at the switching frequency 
and L1 is a residual inductance. The total voltage across L2C2 is zero. The volt­
ages across RL and L1 can be found by calculating the in-phase and the phase-
quadrature components of the switch voltage at the fundamental frequency, 
respectively, as follows

5.4  Secondary Coil Receivers 
5.4.1  Introduction
In the modeling and analysis of inductive links in Section 5.2 the load was 
modeled as a pure resistor. However, most applications and loads today require 
Figure 5.18  Circuit representation of the output load network.

112 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
a dc voltage to operate. Therefore, a rectifier is required to convert the induced 
ac voltage at the secondary coil to a dc voltage. Similar to inverters, rectifiers 
can also be one of the sections of an IPT system were a significant amount of 
power is lost. 
A particular requirement for rectifiers in IPT is that the rectifier needs 
to present a linear load to the secondary coil to maximize the link efficiency. 
All the inverters that have been presented in previous section require a linear 
ac load (or a load impedance) to operate efficiently; therefore, a rectifier that 
presents a nonlinear load to the inductive link will have a negative impact on 
the performance of the primary coil driver and can prevent it from operating at 
optimum switching conditions. 
This section will first begin by discussing the issues associated with using 
the traditional half-wave and full-wave rectifiers. Then Class D and Class E 
rectifiers will be presented and discussed to show their improved performance 
and better suitability in IPT systems 
5.4.2  Half-Wave and Full-Wave Rectifiers
We begin first by looking at the half-wave and full-wave rectifiers. Figure 5.19(a) 
shows a half-wave rectifier connected to secondary coil of an IPT system. The 
secondary coil is parallel tuned so as to create a voltage source. Figure 5.19(b) 
shows the equivalent circuit. The diode in the half-wave rectifier will conduct 
during the positive part of the ac voltage signal and is reverse biased during the 
negative part blocking the ac voltage. Consequently, the voltage across the load 
appears as half sinusoids. These pulse sinusoids need to be filtered in order to

practical circuit, and (b) equivalent circuit.

provide a flat dc voltage. Hence a large capacitor (Co), in the order of tens of 
microfarads, is added to average the pulses into a constant dc voltage.

In full-wave rectification not only is the positive part of the ac input volt­
age passed to the load, but also the negative part is converted to into a positive 
voltage and is passed to the load as well. This doubles the frequency of the pulse 
sinusoids, and therefore the full-wave rectifier requires a smaller filter capacitor 
compared to that of the half-wave rectifier. Figure 5.20(a) shows a widely used 
full-wave rectifier circuit for an IPT system with a parallel tuned secondary 
coil. The rectifier circuit is referred to as the bridge rectifier and consists of four 
diodes. Only two diagonally opposed diodes conduct for during each positive 
and negative half-cycles of the input voltage. Figure 5.20(b) shows the equiva­
lent circuit of the full-wave rectifier. The average output dc voltage is given by

Note that the average output dc voltage is twice as that of the half-wave 
rectifier because the number of the pulse sinusoids is doubled. Figure 5.21 
shows the voltage waveforms comparing half-wave and full-wave rectification.
To determine the suitability of using the half-wave and full-wave rectifiers 
in an IPT system, it is necessary to look into their input current waveform. Fig­
ure 5.22 shows the typical input voltage and current waveforms of the full-wave 
rectifier. Due to the presence of the large output filter capacitor, the full-wave 
rectifier draws current only when the instantaneous voltage supply exceeds the 
dc voltage across the filter capacitor. Consequently, the input current is in the

practical circuit, and (b) equivalent circuit.

soidal and have a rich harmonic content, and hence the current total harmonic

distortion (THD) will be large, which means that the voltage supply will oper­
ate at a low-power factor. A lower-power factor can detune the inductive link 
and therefore degrade the system’s efficiency. The power factor compensation 
method can be used at the expense of complexity and cost. Power factor ratios 
between 0.5 and 0.7 are expected for full-wave rectifiers [17]. In addition, the 
reflected impedance of the rectifier with a high THD as seen by the primary coil 
driver may be complicated, and in some cases, nondeterministic making the 
design and optimization of the complete system difficult. As a result, it is neces­
sary to use rectifiers that have a higher-power factor and a draw current at a low.
5.4.3  Receiver Impedance Emulation 
In the case of a long-range system where coupling between the transmitter and 
the receiver is extremely weak, the optimal load is simply the conjugate match 
of the receiver’s resonant tank at the operating frequency [1]. 
The load impedance changes depending on the current draw of the sensor 
node leading to reduced efficiency and a potential collapse in power available 
to the load. Switch-mode dc-to-dc converters can be controlled to emulate a 
desired impedance so that the optimal load is always presented to the output of 
the rectiﬁer in the receiver. An open-loop converter control scheme is preferred 
as the power consumption requirements can be minimized. Both the buck-
boost converter [Figure 5.23(a)] and the ﬂyback converter [Figure 5.23(b)] can 
be used for an open-loop impedance emulation circuit [18], which is to be 
inserted between the bridge rectiﬁer and the sensor node.
5.4.3.1  Buck-Boost Topology
A buck-boost converter operating in discontinuous conduction mode and with 
open-loop control (i.e., ﬁxed duty cycle) can act as an impedance emulator. Any 
excess power not consumed by the sensor node can be stored in a secondary 
cell, while the cell can also be used to power the sensor node and the impedance 
emulator receive power available is less than required for the sensor node. The 
input impedance of the buck-boost converter for a particular input voltage, Vi, 
is given by
Figure 5.23  The dc/dc converters for load emulation: (a) buck-boost, and (b) flyback.

Because Vi /Vo is likely to be large for resonant receivers, the required duty 
cycle is impractically short due to the large step-down ration. Another issue 
with the buck-boost impedance emulator is the negative output voltage. 
�5.4.3.2  Flyback Topology
A ﬂyback impedance emulator offers an alternative approach that does not suf­
fer from these drawbacks. The expression for emulated resistance is the same 
as that in (5.71), but with the buck-boost inductor L replaced by the primary 
inductance of the ﬂyback transformer. The flyback circuit remains in discon­
tinuous mode only if the current in the secondary winding of the transformer 
can return to zero during the MOSFET off-time

5.5  Safety Issues in IPT
A key aspect in wireless power transfer, in which the public rightly takes a keen 
interest, is ensuring safety when the system is energized. In this case, safety 
could refer to the ability of a human to be present in the vicinity of the IPT 
system, as well as the operation of the IPT system not to interfere with other 
electronic equipment (e.g., communications). Regulations exist for both hu­
man exposure and for equipment electromagnetic compatibility, although they 
differ from country to country.
In order to ease compliance with radiated electromagnetic emissions, 
high-frequency IPT systems usually operate in one of the industrial, scientific, 
and medical (ISM) radio bands (e.g., 6.78, 13.56, or 27.12 MHz), and the 
choice of band will depend on the size of the transmit and receive coils and the 
required power levels. In a system designed for powering wireless sensors, where 
there will likely be one large transmit coil and multiple much smaller receive 
coils powered from the magnetic field, the operating frequency will be deter­
mined by the geometry of the larger (transmit) coil. This is because the larger of 
the coils (the transmitter) will radiate at a lower frequency than the receive coils 
and thus the highest frequency prior to radiation (where the Q-factor is high­
est) is set by the larger coil (see Section 5.6). Compliance with the conducted 
EMC regulations can be overcome by using sufficient common-mode filtering 
and unity power factor rectifier configurations on the transmit side, allowing 
the systems to comply to, for example, EN 61000.
5.5.1  Human Exposure Limits
The safety for human exposure is one of the first questions asked by the general 
public (and indeed by those versed in technical matters) when demonstrating 
inductive power transfer and, due to the nature of powering sensors in build­
ings via IPT, is particularly important as human exposure will, to a large extent, 
be unavoidable. Limits for human exposure to RF EM waves are described by 
several different bodies worldwide and, although based on the same basic prin­
ciples, the recommendations from each standards association differs, leading to 
different recommendations and laws being adopted in different countries. 
The World Health Organization [19] refers to the guidelines set by both 
the IEEE [20] and ICNIRP [21]. The two types of health effects that the stan­
dards documents take into account are tissue-heating effects and nontissue-
heating effects such as nerve and muscle stimulation. Both the IEEE and IC­
NIRP describe what are called basic restrictions, that is, fundamental values 
of electric field strength and specific absorption rates (SARs) inside the hu­
man body that should not be exceeded. As these levels are difficult to measure 
(because they need measuring inside the body), the IEEE and ICNIRP both 

118 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
recommend a set of derived limits for the environment in which the person 
is situated (called reference levels by ICNIRP). If these reference levels are not 
exceeded, the basic restrictions should also not be violated. The derived limits/
reference levels are specified in terms of independent values of the electric and 
magnetic field strengths rather than as a simple incident power density and 
although the basic restrictions specified in IEEE and ICIRP are the same, the 
derived limits/reference levels differ, with the ICNIRP standards being stricter.
The ICNIRP recommendations have been adopted into the new Euro­
pean Union (EU) Electromagnetic Fields Directive [22], which member states 
had to transcribe into law by July 2016. The terminology in the EU directive 
is different from that of the ICNIRP, in that the EU calls the basic restrictions 
exposure limit values (ELVs) and the reference levels are known as action levels 
(ALs). At the frequencies of interest for IPT systems, the ELVs require that the 
SAR is kept below 10 W/kg in the head and trunk, 20 W/kg in the limbs, and 
below 0.4 W/kg averaged across the whole body. The ELVs also require that 
internal electric fields be lower than 3.8 × 10–4 f V/m (where f is in hertz). A 
summary of the ICNIRP 1998 reference levels (adopted by the EU as ALs) for 
the E and B fields is given in Figures 5.24 and 5.25. As can be seen in the fig­
ures, the general trend is for E- and H-field strength requirements to decrease 
as frequency increases. This means that, in general, high-power IPT systems 
operate at lower frequencies, while low-power systems can operate at higher 
frequencies (which, in turn, allows the use of more compact passive compo­
nents, which is advantageous, especially for powering wireless sensors). In the 
case study presented in Section 5.6, a 2-MHz excitation is used, whereas the 
Figure 5.24  1998 ICNIRP E-field reference levels. (Redrawn from [21].)

 
Inductive Power Transfer and Case Study 
119
emerging technologies for wireless vehicle charging tend to operate at around 
100 kHz. 
Failure to meet the reference levels (ALs in EU terminology) does not 
mean a system cannot be compliant with the regulations as it is the basic re­
strictions (ELVs in EU terminology) which must not be violated. These can 
obtained be by simulation. Examples of systems that do not necessarily meet 
the reference levels but do meet the basic restrictions are discussed in [23].
5.6  Case Study: Long-Range Inductive Power Transfer 
Using the principles laid out above, a long-range inductive power system for 
charging wireless sensors was designed and tested at Imperial College London 
[1, 24]. Using a 1-m planar transmit coil transmitting 98W, a 170-mm planar 
receive coil was able to receive over 3 mW at 6m and over 70 µW at 10m. Recti­
fication, impedance emulation, and power throughput control via a 434-MHz 
RF link were all implemented and are described next.
�5.6.1  Magnetics Design and Measurement
Figure 5.26(a) shows the 1m × 1m, 2-turn square coil made out of hollow 28-
mm copper plumbing pipe used as the transmit coil for the long-range system. 
It is envisaged that the transmit coil could be embedded in a wall or ceiling and 
can therefore be reasonably large. It was chosen to operate at 3 MHz where the 
Q-factor of such a coil was simulated using the EM simulator, CST Microwave 
Studio, to be almost 3,000.
Figure 5.25  1998 ICNIRP B-field reference levels. (Redrawn from [21].)

120 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
The challenge is to maximize the Q-factor of miniaturized receiver coils 
suitable for remote wireless sensors. Coil parameters (turns, turn spacing) were 
optimized for Q in CST and using empirical models before construction. Hav­
ing designed, simulated, manufactured and measured a number of different 
coils, a 170-mm Litz wire square planar coil, shown in Figure 5.26(b) alongside 
an alternative 20-mm design, was chosen as the receive coil. It was measured 
to achieve a Q of 280 compared to a Q of 97 for the 20-mm coil. Using Litz 
wire rather than solid wire was shown in measurement to improve the Q by 
about 1/3. The 170-mm receive coil was constructed using a three-dimensional 
printed ABS former loaded with 3 overlayed parallel connected Litz wires.
A Class E inverter was designed to drive the 1-m transmit coil. The 170-
mm receive coil was placed at distances ranging from 2m to 10m from the 
transmit coil in one interval, always on axis, in a large laboratory with the coils 
located far away from any boundary and with no objects placed between the 
coils. Magnetic ﬁeld readings were taken using a 50-mm Aaronia PBS1 mag­
netic ﬁeld probe and Agilent FieldFox Handheld spectrum analyzer for an in­
put dc power into the Class E inverter of 98W. The probe was orientated such 
that the component of the ﬁeld in the direction of displacement was measured. 
To measure the received power for the system, the receive coil was ﬁrst tuned to 
resonate at the transmit frequency of 3-MHz coil using high-Q American Tech­
nical Ceramics capacitors and then impedance-matched with a 51-kΩ 1206 
surface mount resistor. The receive coil was then positioned at the locations at 
which the magnetic ﬁeld probe readings had previously been taken at the same 
98-W dc power input to the Class-E inverter. The voltage at the load was then 
measured to determine the power transferred to the load, using a Fluke 190 
Scopemeter connected to the tuning capacitors, via a short stub of coaxial cable

driver and (b) 170 mm × 20 mm Rx coil.

to avoid adding additional loop area to the receive coil. These measurement 
results are shown in Figure 5.27.
The laboratory contained a number of nonremovable conductive objects, 
such as the ﬂooring (steel-backed) and the bench supports (steel bar), causing 
the magnetic ﬁeld strength readings to be greater than would be expected from 
simulation at 6m and beyond. It is shown that milliwatts of power can be re­
ceived at 7m from the transmit power.
5.6.2  Receiver Electronics
To power a sensor node, the received power must be rectified. Some method of 
providing an impedance match is required. The receiver circuit, shown in Fig­
ure 5.28, consists of a full-bridge rectifier and impedance emulator to perform 
these functions. A 434-MHz wireless link is used for power throughput control. 
A 3.7-V Li-ion con cell is used for energy storage. The 170-mm planar receive 
coil represented by LRX and RRX is parallel-tuned to resonance using CRX 
and is then connected directly to the input of the rectifier.

122 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
5.6.2.1  Flyback Converter
The ﬂyback converter was chosen as the impedance emulator and was designed 
for a switching frequency, f = 19 kHz, L1 = 140 mH, L2 = 1.6 mH, and duty 
cycle δ = 0.24, which resulting in an emulated impedance of 92.3kΩ, which is 
close to the optimal load presented to the rectiﬁer. As n = 9.35, the maximum 
duty cycle is 0.386, which means that the ﬂyback circuit will remain in discon­
tinuous conduction mode.
Due to the extremely low magnetic coupling, the optimal impedance to 
be presented to the rectiﬁer is high (around 100 kΩ), causing the received cur­
rent to be very small (hundreds of micro-amperes). In reality, the emulated 
impedance is not perfectly constant with variations in input voltage due to 
parasitic oscillations in discontinuous conduction mode (Figure 5.29). The em­
ulator performance was adequate, achieving an impedance within +20/50% of 
the optimal value. Figure 5.30 shows the efficiency of the impedance emulator 
with input voltage.
5.6.3  Transmitter Power Control
Transmitter power modulation was implemented to prevent damage to the re­
ceiver electronics as the sensor gets close to the transmit coil through overvolt­
age. VRECT is measured by a microcontroller in the sensor node and trans­
mitted via a 433-MHz frequency-shift keying (FSK) wireless data link to a

microcontroller at transmitter. The measured VRECT value is used to control 
the voltage of the dc power supply to the Class E inverter, VCC, to modulate 
the input power to the transmitter. The control algorithm maintains VRECT 
close to 50V. The control method is as follows: if VRECT is greater than 55V, 
then VCC is decreased by 10V, if VRECT is less than 45V, then VCC is in­
creased by 2V, up to a maximum voltage which is limited by the voltage block­
ing capability of the MOSFET in the Class E inverter. A hysteresis band for 
VRECT (between 45V and 55V) is used to prevent frequency ﬂuctuations in 
input power.
5.6.4  System Results
Figure 5.31 shows the post-emulator received power against distance from the 
transmit coil. The received power is constant at around 30 mW up to 3m as the 
power is modulated, but beyond 3m the transmit power saturates at 163.3W 
and the received power decreases. The receiver electronics and feedback system 
consumes 3.1 mW. The receiver is power neutral at 4.75m and at 5m, received 
power falls to 2 mW.
5.7  Conclusions
In this chapter, the fundamental operation of inductive power transfer has been 
described, including the basic equations of operation for the inductive link, as 
well as the operation of several circuit options for driving the link and acting as 
a secondary side rectifier. It has been shown that while IPT is normally regarded 
as a very short-range solution, for charging devices such as mobile phones and 
electric vehicles, over less than 1-coil diameter, at low received power levels, 
powering wireless sensors is feasible. A system capable of powering a 17-cm 
receive coil from a 1-m transmit coil at several meters with received power lev­

Airflow Energy Harvesting
Andrew S. Holmes
6.1  Introduction
Small-scale energy harvesting from fluid flows is a relatively new and undevel­
oped field. The first devices were reported in the early 2000s, and there has 
been a steady but modest growth in activity since then. The earliest devices 
were based on turbines, which is unsurprising given that turbines are so well 
established on a large scale. However, turbines are relatively complex devices, 
and there are performance and reliability penalties associated with scaling them 
down to a small size. These considerations have led to the investigation of vari­
ous simpler devices based on flow-induced oscillation. These alternative devices 
are all based on principles well known from large-scale engineering, some of 
which have already been applied to power generation on a large scale. Most 
publications have been concerned with the design and/or demonstration of a 
particular class of device, rather than being aimed at any specific application, 
and this is a reflection of the relative immaturity of the field. 
The vast majority of flow energy harvesting devices reported to date have 
been aimed at free-stream applications, where the harvester is placed in an un­
bounded flow, or at least a ducted flow where the device is small compared to 
the duct cross-section. Such devices are more easily and widely deployable than 
devices that can operate only inline within a pipe or duct. The task of a free-
stream energy harvester is to extract kinetic energy from the flow that intercepts 
it and convert it to electrical form with the highest possible conversion efficien­
cy. For a fluid of density ρ, flowing at speed U0, the power flow per unit area 
normal to the flow is given by 1

, and the output power of a free-stream 
energy harvester of cross-sectional area A can be expressed in the form:

Here CP is the power coefficient, which represents the fraction of the fluid 
power that is extracted as raw mechanical power, and η represents the efficiency 
with which this raw mechanical power is converted to electrical output power. 
The combined term ηCP will be referred to in this chapter as the overall effi­
ciency. It should be noted that this terminology is not universal; for example, 
often the conversion efficiency η is absorbed into the power coefficient so that 
CP describes the overall performance. However, when discussing device perfor­
mance in detail, it is helpful to separate the different contributions to overall 
efficiency.
From basic energy and momentum conservation laws, it can be shown 
that the power coefficient CP has a theoretical maximum value of 16/27 = 
0.593 [1]. This result is referred to as the Betz limit after Alfred Betz, who first 
derived it about 1920. The most efficient airflow-harvesting devices, which are 
large-scale turbines, can approach this limit, routinely achieving CP values of 
around 0.5. However, as will be shown in this chapter, miniaturized harvesters 
invariably offer much lower performance, rarely achieving values above 5%. 
Fortunately, even at the relatively low flow speeds encountered in most applica­
tions, the power density in the flow can still be sufficient for a small harvester 
to yield useful levels of power. For example, based on (6.1) and assuming that 
ρ = 1.2 kg/m3, a harvester with a cross-sectional area of 10 cm2 and an overall 
efficiency of 5% will generate between 0.8 mW and 15 mW for flow speeds in 
the range 3 to 8 m/s, as might be encountered in a main air-conditioning duct 
[2]. Such a device could provide power for a wireless duct sensor assuming low 
duty-cycle operation and short-range transmission. 
This chapter reviews progress to date in the area of small-scale airflow 
harvesting, focusing on the operational principles of the various device types 
and the prototype devices that have shown the most promising performance. 
Potential applications in the built environment are also discussed. 
6.2  Airflow Harvesting in Buildings
Opportunities for airflow harvesting inside buildings are relatively limited. In­
door environments are generally kept as free as possible from drafts as this is 
most comfortable for the occupants. Some airflow will inevitably occur as a 
result of people moving around and entering/leaving the space, and also as a 
result of convection induced by thermal gradients, but the flow speeds involved 
tend to be far too low to excite any form of airflow energy harvester. Higher 
flow rates can be produced near electrical equipment with forced air cooling, 

 
Airflow Energy Harvesting

for example, desktop computers. However, it is difficult to see any motivation 
for energy harvesting from such sources because there is always mains power 
available nearby. Similar considerations apply to other portable electrical de­
vices containing fans or blowers.
One important area in which indoor airflow energy harvesting could 
make a significant impact is the enhancement of heating, ventilation, and air-
conditioning (HVAC) systems to improve energy efficiency. According to fig­
ures published by the U.S. Department of Energy [3], buildings account for 
about 40% of total primary energy consumption in the United States, and 
around 43% of the total building energy consumption is used for space heating 
and cooling (2015 data). Consequently there is a strong incentive to improve 
the energy efficiency of HVAC systems where possible. 
Modern office buildings tend to have centrally managed HVAC systems 
with multiple thermal zones that can be independently controlled. It has been 
shown that substantial reductions in energy consumption can be achieved in 
such buildings if the environmental control in each zone takes account of the 
occupancy [4]. Although this seems like an obvious approach, most buildings 
are actually operated on a static occupancy schedule, where environmental 
control is activated according to a fixed timetable based on normal occupancy 
hours. This can be very inefficient in scenarios where occupancy is irregular, for 
example, in an office building where people work flexible hours.
In order to implement occupancy-based HVAC control, it is necessary to 
monitor the occupancy of individual zones, and one potentially attractive solu­
tion to this problem could be to deploy wireless occupancy sensors powered by 
airflow harvesting at the HVAC ports/grilles in each zone. Figure 6.1 shows one 
possible architecture for such a system, in which the additional wireless sensors 
for occupancy monitoring are shown in gray. The system is a typical variable air 
volume (VAV) one in which chilled air is supplied to multiple zones by a com­
mon air handling unit (AHU). The AHU takes in recycled air from the build­
ing, exchanges it with fresh air as necessary, and heats or cools it to the required 
temperature before redistributing it to the building. Environmental control in 
each zone is effected by a dedicated VAV box that uses dampers to control the 
flow into the zone, reheating the air as required. The VAV boxes and AHU are 
linked to a central energy management system (EMS) via a wired network (e.g., 
Ethernet), and the wireless occupancy sensors also have access to this network 
via base stations. It is important to note that the only additional hardware items 
required for occupancy monitoring in the system of Figure 6.1 are the airflow-
powered occupancy sensors and the base stations. This means that potentially 
such a system could be upgraded with very little capital expenditure. 
Figure 6.1 also shows an airflow-powered wireless sensor embedded 
within the main duct, and this is another important potential application for 
such devices. Many HVAC systems, particularly older ones, would benefit from 

130 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
having more sophisticated control based on information gathered by multiple 
sensors distributed across the duct network. Such sensors might be monitoring 
multiple properties of the airflow, including temperature, pressure, flow rate, 
and air quality (e.g., carbon dioxide level). Communication between sensors 
could, for example, be via a peer-to-peer radio network, with reradiating devices 
(either passive or flow-powered) providing connection to the building wireless 
network. HVAC ducts have been shown to provide an excellent conduit for 
radio signals [5], and this would reduce the power budget associated with data 
transmission. 
It is important to establish the power levels that are likely to be available 
in the above application scenarios. Considering first the duct sensor, Table 6.1 
shows typical flow rates for main and branch ducts in buildings intended for 
public or industrial use [6]. Assuming a device cross-section of 30 cm2 (<5% 
obstruction in a 1-foot-diameter duct), an energy harvester with an overall ef­
ficiency of only 2% will generate ~0.6 mW of power at the lowest flow speed 
of 2.5 m/s. While relatively low, this level of power is reasonable as an average 
supply power for a duct sensor because of the low data rate required that allows 
low-duty-cycle operation of both sensor and radio. 
The occupancy sensor is more challenging several reasons. First, the flow 
speeds encountered at HVAC grilles are generally lower than in the ducts, as 
indicated by Table 6.1. This will reduce the available power and lower the re­
quired start-up or cut-in speed. Second, because the sensor is visible when in­
stalled, it should be as compact as possible. Even at 2.3 m/s, a device with a 
smaller cross-section of 10 cm2 and 2% efficiency will generate only ~150 µW, 
which calls for a very low-power sensor implementation. 
It is worth noting that the airflow at the grille can vary significantly de­
pending on the type of air-conditioning system. For example, Table 6.2 shows 
Figure 6.1  Possible large building HVAC scenario in which airflow-powered wireless sen­
sors are used to reduce HVAC energy consumption through monitoring of occupancy.

airflow measurements recorded in a university building at different distances 
from several types of self-contained air-conditioning unit [7]. This is clearly not 
relevant to the control of a centralized HVAC system, but it could be of interest 
for other types of ceiling-mounted sensor (e.g., security sensors).
To summarize, the HVAC application, which appears to be the most 
promising for indoor environments, calls for compact airflow energy harvesters 
with very low cut-in speed and, ideally, overall efficiencies of at least a few per­
cent. The following sections will review progress towards these goals.
6.3  Microturbine Airflow Harvesters
In terms of overall efficiency, turbines are the best-performing devices for ex­
tracting mechanical power from a fluid flow. Furthermore, wind turbine tech­
nology at larger scales is very well established, and turbines with diameters 
ranging from ~100m down to ~1m are commonplace. Miniaturization of the 
classical wind turbine was therefore a natural starting point for the development 
of smaller-scale airflow energy harvesters, and the earliest devices were indeed 
of this type.
Wind turbines can be divided into two major categories according to 
whether the rotation axis is horizontal or vertical [8]. Vertical axis turbines have 
the advantage that they can accept wind from any direction; they do not need 
to be pointed into the wind. However, they are less efficient than horizontal axis

turbines. The following discussion will be confined to horizontal axis turbines 
because all experimental data reported to date for turbine-based energy harvest­
ers has been for devices of this type. 
The basic structure and operational principles of a horizontal axis tur­
bine will be familiar to most readers. A typical large-scale turbine consists of 
a three-bladed rotor coupled to an electrical generator via a suitable gearing 
mechanism, as shown in Figure 6.2(a). The rotor blades are aerofoils, and it is 
the aerodynamic lift produced by the blades as the wind flows over them that 
generates torque and output power. To illustrate this in more detail, Figure 
6.2(b) shows a cross-section through a blade at an arbitrary radius r. The wind 
is incident on the blade with a relative velocity W, which is the resultant of axial 
and tangential velocity components U0(1 - a) and Wr(1 + a′). Here U0 is the 
free-stream wind speed, far from the turbine, and Ω is the turbine rotation rate. 
The parameters a and a′ are referred to as the axial and tangential induction 
factors; these account for the axial deceleration of the wind as it approaches the 
turbine and for the rotation or swirl induced in the wind by its interaction with 
the rotor [9]. 
The flow of air over the blade produces aerodynamic lift and drag forces 
FL and FD per unit length as indicated in Figure 6.2(b). It is customary to ex­
press these forces in the form:

where c is the blade chord (distance between leading an trailing edges) and CL,

A common approach to the design of turbines is to assume that the aero­
dynamic forces can be calculated using static lift and drag coefficients as would 
be obtained for a stationary aerofoil in a wind tunnel. This is a gross simpli­
fication but allows progress to be made without the need for computationally 
intensive numerical analysis that takes full account of the complex three-dimen­
sional (3-D), unsteady flow. In the blade element momentum (BEM) method 
[9], which is the most commonly used design tool, the flow through the turbine 
is treated as a series of annular stream tubes that do not interact. The induc­
tion factors are determined at each radius by applying basic conservation laws, 
allowing evaluation of the torque contributions and hence the total torque. 
Finally, the shaft power is obtained as Pshaft = Wt.
Turbines suffer an inevitable loss of performance when scaled down in 
size, and to understand the reasons for this, it is helpful to make use of dimen­
sional analysis [10]. The key parameters in turbine design are known to be the 
shaft power, the rotational speed, the free stream flow speed, the rotor diameter 
D, the roughness of the machine surfaces ε and the fluid properties (density ρ 
and kinematic viscosity ν). These seven variables can be combined to form the 
following four nondimensional groups:

The parameter CP is the power coefficient, as defined earlier in (6.1), λ 
is the tip speed ratio (TSR) which represents the ratio of the peripheral rotor 
speed to the free-stream flow speed, ReΩ is the rotational Reynolds number [1], 
and εrel is the relative roughness.
The functional relationship between CP, λ, ReΩ, and εrel will be scale in­
variant for any geometrically similar series of turbines. Consequently, if a par­
ticular design can be scaled down while keeping λ, ReΩ, and εrel constant, CP 
will also be invariant and performance will be maintained. In practice, however, 
downscaling normally leads to reductions in λ and ReΩ, and an increase in εrel. 
The most important consideration is that in order to maintain ReΩ constant, it 
is necessary for the rotation speed to scale as W ∝ 1/D2, and this is unsustain­
able beyond a certain point because of limitations imposed by the bearings. 

134 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
The reduction in Reynolds number with downscaling has a detrimental 
effect on the power coefficient, primarily because of an increase in viscous drag 
losses. The lift-and-drag coefficients are functions of the blade shape, the angle 
of attack [the angle α in Figure 6.2(b)] and the chord Reynolds number (Rec 
= Wc/v)). Although the lift coefficient shows only a weak dependence on Rec 
at low angles of attack, the drag coefficient increases markedly at low Reynolds 
number, significantly reducing the lift-to-drag ratio. For example, typical values 
for CL/CD might be ~100 in a large scale turbine (Rec > 106) and <10 in a centi­
meter-scale device (Rec ~103). From (6.3), it can be seen that this is expected to 
have a negative effect on the available torque in small turbines. 
In spite of the negative effects of scaling, miniature turbines, at least down 
to the centimeter scale, can achieve overall efficiencies of around 10%. This was 
first demonstrated by Federspiel and Chen [11], who combined a 10.2-cm-di­
ameter fan rotor with a brushless DC motor operated as an AC generator. The 
resulting device could deliver 8 mW at a 2.5-m/s flow speed, corresponding to 
an overall efficiency of ηCP = 10.4%, and 28 mW at 5.1 m/s (ηCP = 4.3%). 
Other devices based on off-the-shelf components were subsequently demon­
strated by Rancourt et al. [12], Xu et al. [13], and Carli et al. [14]. The key 
parameters for these devices can be found in Table 6.3. 
Although most of the devices reported have employed an electromagnetic 
(EM) generator for power extraction, a few have used other power extraction 
methods. For example, Myers et al demonstrated a piezoelectric windmill in 
which a set of three 12.7-cm-diameter rotors was coupled via a crank mecha­
nism to an array or piezoelectric cantilevers [15]. More recently, Perez et al. 
reported a much smaller (4-cm diameter) turbine with an electret-based elec­
trostatic generator around the periphery of the rotor [16]. 
The smallest free-stream turbine harvester reported as of 2016 was the de­
vice developed by Howey et al. [17]. This device, which was aimed specifically 
at duct monitoring, consisted of a shrouded axial turbine with an axial-flux

permanent magnet (AFPM) generator built into the shroud (see Figure 6.3). 
The AFPM generator consisted of a fixed stator coil, fabricated as a multilayer 
flexible printed circuit, sandwiched between two rotor-mounted rings of neo­
dymium-boron-iron (NdBFe) magnets. The rotor diameter was 2.0 cm, and 
the total frontal area including the shroud was 8.0 cm2. The rotor was sup­
ported on jewel bearings. The turbine had a cut-in speed of 3 m/s and could 
deliver between 80 µW and 2.5 mW for flow speeds in the range of 3 to 7 m/s 
[see Figure 6.4(a)]. The overall efficiency at the upper end of this range was 
1.5%. The maximum efficiency was lower than for the other devices in Table 
6.3. However, this is to be expected given the smaller device size. The overall 
efficiency was found to be strongly affected by bearing losses, particularly at 
Figure 6.3  Microturbine harvester developed by Howey et al. (a) schematic cross-section, 
and (b) photograph with British pound coin for scale (photo from [17]).

low flow rates. Figure 6.4(b) shows the distribution of the shaft power between 
the load (Pout), the generator coils and the bearings at different flow rates. At 
the minimum operating speed the bearings were found to consume 73% of the 
shaft power. 
6.4  Oscillating Airflow Energy Harvesters
Energy harvesters based on flow-induced oscillations tend to be relatively simple 
in construction compared to microturbines, and they do not require bearings. 
As such, they offer potential advantages in terms of both manufacturing costs 
and long-term reliability. This section briefly reviews the operating principles 
involved and gives examples of practical devices reported in the literature. 
6.4.1  Devices Based on Vortex Shedding
Vortex shedding is an unsteady flow phenomenon that occurs when a fluid 
flows past a bluff body; that is, one for which both transverse dimensions are 
either comparable to or larger than the length in the direction of flow. At ex­
tremely low Reynolds numbers, the flow around such a body will be unsepa­
rated, with the layer of fluid nearest the body following its profile from front to 
back. However, as the Reynolds number is increased, the pressure gradients on 
the downstream side will no longer be sufficient to keep the boundary layers on 
either side in contact, and they will become detached, trailing downstream and 
forming the boundaries of the wake. 
The innermost layers of the detached flow have a tendency to turn in­
wards and roll up to form vortices behind the body. Taking the circular cylinder 
as a typical example, up to a certain Reynolds number a pair of stationary vorti­
ces will form in the near wake. However, as the Reynolds number is further in­
creased, the wake will become unstable and one of the vortices will break away 
and be carried downstream. This initiates a periodic process in which vortices 
are shed alternately from one side of the body and then the other, as illustrated 
in Figure 6.5. This characteristic pattern of staggered vortices is known as a 
vortex street. For a circular cylinder, regular vortex shedding is observed for 
Reynolds numbers above ~45, except in the transitional range (3 × 105 < ~Re 
< 3 × 106) where the transition to turbulence in the boundary layer can disrupt 
the regular shedding pattern [18].
The vortex shedding frequency, which represents the rate at which pairs 
of vortices are shed from a stationary body, is typically expressed in the form:

where U0 is the free stream flow speed, D is a characteristic dimension of the 
bluff body (the diameter in the case of a circular cylinder), and S is a dimen­
sionless parameter known as the Strouhal number. The Strouhal number for 
any given form of bluff body is a function of Reynolds number, defined in this 
context as Re = U0D/v. However, generally this function is relatively weak over 
a wide range of Re. For example, for a circular cylinder it is found that S = 0.2 
± 0.01 for Reynolds numbers in the range 300 < ~Re < 105 [19]. This range 
encompasses the flow regimes likely to be found in any small-scale airflow en­
ergy harvester. For example, a 1-cm-diameter cylinder in an airflow of 1 to 10 
m/s will have Reynolds numbers in the range 660 < Re < 6,600 (assuming ν = 
1.51 × 10–5 m2/s for air). The variations of S with Re for some other prismatic 
bodies can be found in [18].
The vortex-shedding process leads to fluctuations in the surface pressure 
experienced by the bluff body, resulting in oscillatory lift and drag forces that 
are normal and parallel to the flow and have frequencies of 1× and 2× the vortex 
shedding frequency, respectively. If the body is compliant and/or mounted on 
an elastic suspension, then it will undergo forced oscillations that may become 
large in amplitude if the vortex-shedding frequency is close to a mechanical 
resonance frequency and the damping is sufficiently low. In most situations, 
engineering structures are designed with a view to eliminating, or at least mini­
mizing, such vortex-induced vibration (VIV). However, in recent years, it has 
also been recognized that VIV can be exploited as a mechanism for electricity 
generation both on a large scale [20] and on smaller scales [21]. 
Figure 6.6(a) shows the electromechanical model for the simplest class of 
energy harvester based on vortex-induced vibration. It comprises a bluff body 
mounted on a single-axis spring suspension that allows only transverse vibra­
tion. The system damping, represented by a dashpot, includes both structural 
damping and electrical damping by the transducer that extracts electrical power. 
For the purposes of this discussion, both damping mechanisms are assumed to 
apply viscous-like damping, where the damping force is proportional to velocity.
The equation of motion for the system in Figure 6.6(a) is of the form:

According to (6.9), the resonant amplitude should be inversely propor­
tional to the level of damping, and this does indeed apply when the damping is 
strong and the vibration amplitude small. However, this relation breaks down 
for lighter damping and larger oscillation amplitudes because significant in­
teraction occurs between the body motion and the fluid. The periodic motion 
of the body has the effect of strengthening the vortex-shedding process and 
synchronizing it along the length of the body [22]. Furthermore, the frequency 
of vortex shedding can shift to the mechanical resonance frequency, a phenom­
enon known as lock-in. Figure 6.7 shows typical variations of actual vortex-
shedding frequency (denoted fv) and vibration amplitude with flow speed for 
a relatively lightly damped system. The plots shown are based on experimental 
data for an elastically suspended cylinder in an air stream [23]. The x-axis is the

As the flow velocity increases from zero, the shedding frequency is initially 
proportional to flow speed, as expected from (6.5), and there is little vibrational 
response because the excitation is outside the resonant band. However, as the 
shedding frequency approaches the resonance frequency, the system becomes 
locked in. This occurs where Ur ≈ 1/S, with S = 0.2 being assumed in the plot. 
The shedding frequency remains locked to the resonance frequency throughout 
the lock-in band, and the vibrational response passes through a maximum near 
the center of the band. Eventually, lock-in is lost and the shedding frequency 
reverts to the normal value as defined by (6.5). 
From an energy-harvesting perspective, it is of interest to know how much 
power can be extracted by the electrical damper and delivered as electrical out­
put power. Assuming sinusoidal oscillation at the resonance frequency, the total 
power flowing into the damper and transducer combined is:

where L is the length of the bluff body. If the reduced damping coefficients for

ss + se, and the transducer has a conversion efficiency he, the output power will 
be Pout = he(se/sr)Pd. Taking the device cross-section for the purposes of power

To optimize the performance in terms of power coefficient, it is neces­
sary to maximize (6.12) with respect to damping and flow speed. The resonant 
nature of the relationship between y0 and Ur (see Figure 6.7) is such that the 
optimum working point will always be close to the peak in the amplitude versus 
flow speed response, although it will be shifted slightly to lower Ur by the cubic 
term in the denominator. 
In the limit of very light damping, the peak oscillation amplitude satu­
rates because the motion of the body disrupts the vortex-shedding process. In 
this regime, based on (6.12), the power coefficient is expected to increase with 
electrical damping. In contrast, at higher damping levels, (6.9) applies so that 
y0 ∝ 1/sr and CP is expected to fall with increasing electrical damping once this 
damping mechanism becomes dominant. Between these two regimes, there is 
an optimum electrical damping level that maximizes the power into the trans­
ducer. If the functional form for the variation of peak amplitude with damping 

 
Airflow Energy Harvesting 
141
is known, then the maximum achievable power coefficient can be calculated for 
any given level of structural damping. 
Unfortunately, predicting the variation of peak oscillation amplitude with 
damping is not straightforward. Vortex shedding is inherently a 3-D process 
and so accurate numerical modeling requires 3-D solvers that are computation­
ally intensive [24]. Analytical models have been developed [22, 25], but these 
invariably rely on experimental measurements for calibration of model param­
eters. Furthermore, up to now, the models available cannot fully take account 
of Reynolds number and mass ratio effects. This is a particular problem for 
airflow harvesting because, although there have been many experimental stud­
ies of VIV, most have been at a relatively high Reynolds number and in water 
where the mass ratio is generally much lower than in air.
Among the experimental studies of self-excited VIV, an early one carried 
out by Feng [23] stands out as being particularly relevant to airflow harvesting. 
Feng made measurements for a 3-inch-diameter cylinder mounted on a spring 
suspension in a wind tunnel. The system included an electromagnetic damper 
that could be used to vary the damping factor, so it was effectively a vortex-
shedding energy harvester, although it was not developed as such. The mass 
ratio was mr = 195 and the minimum achievable damping factor (with no EM 
damping) was ζ = 0.00103, giving a structural reduced damping coefficient of 
σs = 2.52. The peak oscillation amplitude under these conditions was y0/D ≈ 
0.53, and this occurred at Ur = 6.28. With the EM damping set at σe = 1.02, 
a peak amplitude of y0/D ≈ 0.40 was obtained at Ur = 6.11. Substituting these 
values into (6.12), assuming ηe = 1, gives an overall efficiency of 2.9%. This is 
the highest ηCP value extracted from Feng’s data, although it is not necessarily 
the highest that could have been achieved with σs = 2.52. 
The results of Feng suggest that it should be possible to achieve power co­
efficients of at least a few percent with a self-excited VIV airflow harvester, and 
some progress towards this goal has been made in recent years. For example, 
Akaydin et al. [26] demonstrated a device comprising an aluminum cantilever 
with a cylindrical bluff body attached to the tip. The cylinder was 203 mm in 
length and 39.6 mm in diameter and made of paperboard for low mass. Electri­
cal damping was implemented by PZT (lead zirconate titanate) piezoelectric 
patches attached on either side of the cantilever near the root. Figure 6.8 shows 
schematic views of the device and a photograph of the prototype installed in a 
wind tunnel. The prototype harvester had an exceptionally low cut-in speed of 
around 0.9 m/s and delivered a maximum output power of 100 µW at a 1.19-
m/s flow, corresponding to an overall efficiency of 1.2%. The response (power 
versus flow speed) had a single peak with a FWHM of 0.44 m/s or 37% of the 
center flow speed.
Figure 6.6(b) shows an alternative approach to energy harvesting by VIV 
in which the bluff body is fixed, and the oscillating cross-flow associated with its 

142 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
vortex street excites a secondary structure in its near wake. The secondary struc­
ture is shown as an aerofoil on a spring suspension, although it need not take 
this precise form. Interestingly, although the setup is more complicated than the 
one in Figure 6.6(a), most VIV airflow harvesters demonstrated to date have 
been of this wake-excited type. One of the earlier designs was that of Pober­
ing and Schwesinger [27], in which the secondary structure was a piezoelectric 
cantilever attached directly to the leeward side of the bluff body. The bluff body 
was of a rectangular cross-section with chamfered corners on the windward 
side, and the frontal area was L × D = 11.8 × 10.4 mm2. The device could de­
liver 108 µW at a flow speed of 45 m/s, corresponding to an overall efficiency of 
only 0.0016%. A similar device with a more compliant PVDF (polyvinylidene 
fluoride) piezoelectric cantilever was demonstrated more recently by Wen et al. 
[28]. This had a frontal area of 33 × 12 mm2 and could deliver 1 µW at a 2-m/s 
flow (ηCP = 0.053%).
One factor thought to be contributing to the relatively low efficiencies 
seen in the devices of Pobering and Wen is the splitter plate effect. It is well 
known that attaching a thin plate to the leeward side of a bluff body disrupts 
the vortex shedding process by reducing the interaction between the separating 
flows on the two sides of the body [18]; indeed, this is one of the approaches 
used traditionally to suppress vortex shedding in larger structures. Separating 
the secondary structure from the bluff body, as in Figure 6.6(b), is therefore ex­
pected to be beneficial, and several groups have demonstrated energy harvesters 
adopting this approach. A notable example is the device of Weinstein et al. [29], 
shown in Figure 6.9(a). The bluff body was an acrylic cylinder (D = 2.5 cm, L 
= 11 cm) and the secondary structure was a PZT cantilever (bender) that was 
fixed at the downstream end and had a balsa wood fin attached at its upstream 
end. The purpose of the fin was to maximize the oscillating lift force due to the 
Figure 6.8  Self-excited VIV energy harvester of Akaydin et al.: (a) top and side schematic 
views; and (b) prototype harvester installed in a wind tunnel. Photo from [26].

vortex-induced cross-flow. The device was self-contained, with the bluff body 
and secondary structure being mounted in an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene 
(ABS) frame. To maximize the power at a given flow rate, the resonance fre­
quency of the secondary structure was tuned to the vortex-shedding frequency 
by attaching weights to the fin. The harvester could operate at flow speeds 
down to 2 m/s and, with retuning, could deliver output powers from 100 µW 
to 3 mW for flow rates in the range of 2 to 5 m/s. The overall efficiency at the 
upper end of this range was 1.7%. Figure 6.9(b) shows the response of a device 
tuned for operation at 4.7 m/s. The FWHM is ~18% of the center flow speed; 
this is somewhat narrower than the FWHM achieved by the self-excited device 
of Akaydin et al. where there was presumably a strong lock-in effect. Other 
wake-excited VIV devices have been reported with lower overall efficiencies 
(see, for example, [21, 30]). Basic studies have also been done on the interac­
tions between shed vortices and a flexible beam [31].

6.4.2  Devices Based on Galloping and Flutter
Galloping and flutter are related phenomena that arise from feedback between 
the motion of a compliant (or elastically supported) object and the fluidic forces 
that act upon it. They occur spontaneously when the motion-dependent fluidic 
forces are of a destabilizing nature and of sufficient magnitude to overcome 
the stabilizing effect of damping. The term galloping is applied to bluff bodies, 
while flutter is reserved for streamlined bodies such as aerofoils or thin plates. 
This section briefly reviews the origins of both effects and how they have been 
applied in energy harvesters to date. For a more detailed discussion of funda­
mentals, the reader is referred to [18, 32]. 
The origins of galloping can be understood with the aid of the model in 
Figure 6.10, which shows a bluff body on a single-axis elastic suspension, im­
mersed in a uniform cross-flow. The body is assumed to be moving downward 
with a speed y so that the relative velocity W of the incoming flow is as shown 
in the velocity triangle to the left of the figure. 
In general, the body will be subject to fluidic lift and drag forces (FL and 
FD in Figure 6.10), which will vary in both magnitude and direction as the 
body moves. It is typically assumed that these forces can be calculated using the 
normal static lift and drag coefficients, as might be obtained by measurements 
in a wind tunnel. This amounts to assuming that the timescale associated with 
any oscillation (~1/fn) is long compared to the fluid transit time across the body 
(~D/U0) or, equivalently, that Ur >> 1. Under these conditions, other fluid 
dynamic effects such as vortex shedding will occur at a frequency well above the 
oscillation frequency and will be averaged out. As a rule of thumb, quasi-static 
analysis is generally deemed to be applicable for Ur > 20.

by convention, the vertical displacement y is measured downwards from the rest position.

The coefficients ai depend on the body shape and flow conditions; values 
for some common body cross-sections can be found in [18]. For the purposes of 
this discussion, it is necessary to consider only the first few terms in the series. 
The first term is a static force that has no effect on dynamics. However, the 
second term is proportional to y and hence represents a velocity-type damp­
ing force, the effect of which will be to modify the damping so that the overall 
damping coefficient becomes:

If the linear coefficient a1 is positive, then at a certain threshold flow 
speed the overall damping coefficient will become negative and the system will 
go unstable. Any slight perturbation will then cause galloping oscillations to 
develop at the resonance frequency. The reduced flow velocity Urg at the onset 
of galloping is obtained by setting d ′ = 0 in (6.15), which gives:

The linear coefficient is given by a1 = –(∂CL/∂a + CD), so in order for a1 
to be positive, it is required that ∂CL/∂a < 0, that is, the lift force must decrease 

146 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
with increasing angle of attack (note that CD is always >0). The value of a1 
for any particular bluff body will depend on its orientation, and also on the 
Reynolds number, and with the notable exception of the circular cylinder, for 
which CL = 0, any form of bluff body can be made to gallop under the correct 
conditions. 
According to the quasi-static model, galloping oscillations, once initiated, 
will grow in amplitude until nonlinear terms in (6.14) cause the average power 
input from the fluid to exactly balance the average power into the damper. A 
case of particular interest is where only the linear and third-order terms are 
included (with a1 > 0 and a3 < 0), and the damping is weak. In this case an 
approximate solution can be derived for the equation of motion [18], and this 
predicts limit cycle oscillations with amplitude:

According to this equation, the power into the damper (proportional to 
amplitude squared) is expected to rise monotonically with flow speed above the 
galloping threshold, showing a quadratic dependence on Ur. Further analysis 
shows that the variation of power coefficient with flow speed is expected to 
show a single maximum at Ur = 2Urg, tending to zero at high flow rates [33]. 
The quasi-static model is oversimplistic and cannot be used to make reli­
able quantitative predictions when the oscillation amplitude is large. Neverthe­
less, it does predict certain key features of galloping behavior that are observed 
in practice, in particular, the existence of a threshold and divergence of the 
oscillation amplitude at high flow speeds. For example, Figure 6.11 shows the 
effect of changing the tip body shape on the self-excited harvester of Akaydin 
et al. (as shown in Figure 6.8) [34]. It can be seen that with a circular cylinder, 
which will not gallop, the response shows a single peak characteristic of vortex-
induced vibration. In contrast, the I-shaped bodies showed only galloping-type 
responses, presumably because their narrow width in the direction of flow re­
duced the driving forces due to vortex shedding. With a D-shaped body, both 
types of oscillation are evident and the galloping threshold is sufficiently low 
that the two regimes appear to overlap. The galloping oscillations for the D-
cylinder design grew very steeply with flow speed, and testing was stopped at 
3 m/s because of concerns over potential damage to the piezoelectric elements. 
The output power at 2.75 m/s was 2 mW, corresponding to an overall efficiency 
of 2%. 
Several other groups have investigated self-excited harvesters with non­
circular tip bodies. For example, Sirohi and Mahadik demonstrated a device 
with a triangular body (L = 251 mm, D = 40 mm) supported at each end by a 

 
Airflow Energy Harvesting 
147
piezoelectric cantilever [35]. The device was presented as a galloping harvester 
although its response, which occurred over the range of 3.6 m/s to 6 m/s, was 
more characteristic of VIV. The reported maximum output power, at 5.2 m/s, 
was 26.5 mW, corresponding to an overall efficiency of 3.2%. Other investiga­
tions into the effect of the tip body shape have also been carried out [36]. 
As mentioned above, an isolated cylinder on an elastic suspension will not 
gallop because its static lift coefficient is zero. However, galloping-type oscilla­
tions may occur when two cylinders are placed in tandem. This wake gallop­
ing phenomenon has been studied extensively in the context of power cable 
bundles [37]. When the separation between the cylinders is large (many diam­
eters), the behavior of the downstream cylinder is reminiscent of VIV, albeit 
with a higher Ur at onset because of the reduced flow speed in the wake of the 
upstream cylinder. However, at lower separations, strong interaction between 
the two cylinders can lead to quite different behavior. Most importantly, a sig­
nificant widening of the lock-in range can occur. Jung and Lee demonstrated a 
prototype harvester exploiting this principle [38]. Their device was based on a 
pair of 5-cm-diameter, 85-cm-long cylinders. The upstream cylinder was fixed 
while the downstream one was mounted on a spring suspension with an EM 
damper for power extraction. The results were interesting in that cut-in speeds 
below 1 m/s could be achieved at the same time as operation up to 5 m/s. 
A more compact device based on oscillations in the wake of a bluff body 
was reported by Zhu et al. [39]. As shown in Figure 6.12(a), the device com­
prises an aerofoil, mounted on a cantilever behind a cuboid bluff body. An EM 
damper comprising a fixed coil between two wing-mounted magnets provides 
power extraction. Because of its proximity to the bluff body, the aerofoil ex­
periences a lift force that is strongly motion-dependent, and under the correct 
conditions limit cycle oscillations develop.

The harvester in Figure 6.12 was aimed specifically at HVAC applica­
tions, and separate variants were produced optimized for vertical and horizon­
tal ducts. Figure 6.12(b) shows the measured response of the horizontal flow 
device, which had a frontal area of 10 cm × 5.5 cm. The cut-in speed was 1.5 
m/s, and the output power varied from 90 µW at 2 m/s (ηCP = 0.34%) to 3.3 
mW at 8 m/s (ηCP = 0.2%). The vertical version, which was similar in size, had 
a higher cut-in speed of 2.5 m/s, but achieved a higher maximum efficiency of 
0.96%. Smaller devices based on the same working principle, but with piezo­
electric transduction, have since been reported [40, 41]. 
The term flutter encompasses a range of oscillatory effects relevant to 
aerodynamic structures. In the context of aerofoils, it is usually discussed with 
Figure 6.12  Oscillating wing energy harvester developed by Zhu et al. (horizontal flow ver­
sion): (a) prototype device and (b) output power versus flow speed. (From: [39].)

Equations (6.18) and (6.19) are coupled inertially through the terms in

The dependencies of Fy and M on y and θ might be expected to result 
in linear and torsional galloping. However, the first derivatives are such that 
aerofoils are stable against torsional flutter and prone to linear galloping or stall 
flutter only at high angles of attack. Two other potential modes of instability 
are important: divergence and classical flutter. The first of these arises from the 
dependence of M on q, which under certain conditions reduce the effective tor­
sional stiffness to zero. This can arise only when aerodynamic center is upstream

of the rotation axis, as in Figure 6.13. The second is a coupled motion in which 
linear and torsional oscillations occur at the same frequency. 
Building on work carried out in the 1980s aimed at large-scale power 
generation [42], several groups have explored the use of classical flutter for en­
ergy harvesting [43, 44]. For example, Bryant and Garcia [44] investigated a 
simple device comprising a polymer flap (NACA0012 aerofoil, 13.6-cm span, 
6.0-cm chord) attached to a stainless steel cantilever via a revolute joint. Power 
extraction was via PZT patches near the cantilever root (see Figure 6.14). The 
device was tested in a wind tunnel with the aerofoil at the downstream end 
and oriented with its span in the vertical direction. The harvester had a cut-in 
speed of 1.9 m/s and an output power of 1.6 mW at 2.6 m/s, corresponding to 
a power coefficient of 1.49% (including the pk-pk oscillation amplitude in the 
frontal area). The output power fluctuated with flow speed rather than increas­
ing monotonically, varying between 0.85 mW and 2.2 mW for speeds up to 
8.7 m/s. The authors developed a sophisticated model of the device, taking into 
account unsteady aerodynamic effects, and were able to obtain excellent agree­
ment between predicted and measured results.
Two other familiar forms of flutter have been investigated for energy har­
vesting on the small scale: flutter due to transverse flow across a tensioned rib­
bon or belt, and the flag-like flapping of an untensioned flexible plate. A range 
of energy harvesters based on the first of these principles was developed by the 
company Humdinger Wind Energy LLC under the name Windbelt [45]. The 
smallest device in the range, shown schematically in Figure 6.15, was palm-
sized (total device cross-section, 37 cm2) and could generate 0.2 mW at 3.5-m/s 
flow (ηCP = 0.21%) and 5 mW at 7.5 m/s (ηCP = 0.53%). It consisted simply 
of a polymer/fiber composite belt with attached magnets that interacted with 
adjacent copper coils for power extraction. Larger devices based on the same 
principle have since been demonstrated by Fei et al. [46].
Figure 6.14  Flutter-based harvester of Bryant and Garcia.

 
Airflow Energy Harvesting 
151
The simplest flow energy harvesters to have emerged to date are based on 
the flag-like flapping of flexible membranes. This mode of flutter arises spon­
taneously in a flexible plate above a critical flow velocity [47], although it may 
be encouraged by the presence upstream of a bluff body. Small-scale energy 
harvesters based on flapping piezoelectric membranes were first proposed in 
the context of hydropower generation and were dubbed “energy harvesting 
eels” [48, 49]. A number of groups have since demonstrated similar devices for 
airflow harvesting. These have included designs employing piezoelectric poly­
mer membranes [50] and metal plates with attached piezoelectric patches [51]. 
More elaborate “flapping leaf” designs comprising a polymer piezoelectric flap 
(“stalk”) with a triangular “leaf” attached have also been demonstrated [52]. 
Mostly these devices have shown relatively low overall efficiencies (<0.1%). A 
notable exception is the harvester of Perez et al., which is shown schematically 
in Figure 6.16 [53]. The flapping element in this device is a gold-metallized 
PVDF membrane (50 mm long, 15 mm wide, 25 µm thick). Although the 
membrane is of PVDF, power extraction is not piezoelectric; rather it is elec­
trostatic, based on the variable capacitance between the membrane and the top 
and bottom plates. The plates are covered with polarized PTFE electret layers to

provide a pre-charge and eliminate the need for an external priming source. A 
device with a spacing of 3 mm between the plates had a cut-in speed of 10 m/s 
and could deliver 480 µW at a 15-m/s flow speed, corresponding to an overall 
efficiency of 0.54%. 
Table 6.4 summarizes the key characteristics for some of the oscillating 
airflow energy harvesters highlighted in this section. The table includes one 
example from each of the main device types discussed. Comparing it with Table 
6.3, it can be seen that the overall efficiency values are lower than for microtur­
bines; on the other hand, several of the devices have cut-in speeds below 2 m/s.
6.5  Discussion
Of the small-scale airflow energy harvesters that have been demonstrated to 
date, those based on miniature turbines have consistently shown the best per­
formance in terms of overall efficiency, with many achieving values in the range 
of 5% to 10%. Little effort has been devoted to optimal turbine design for these 
devices, so there is almost certainly room for performance improvement. The 
cut-in speeds have been on the high side in most cases (3 m/s or higher), but 
the results of Perez et al. [17], with a cut-in speed of 1.5 m/s, show that this is 
not a fundamental limitation even for relatively small devices. The cut-in speed 
is generally limited by bearing friction, and a major challenge is to identify low-
cost bearing technologies that provide sufficiently low starting friction while at 
the same time offering long-term reliability. The overall cost of manufacturing is 
also a concern for miniature turbines because of their relatively high complexity.

Airflow Energy Harvesting

The oscillating harvesters demonstrated have performed less well in terms 
of overall efficiency, with the best-performing devices achieving values in the 
range of 1% to 3%. However, many have achieved cut-in speeds below 2 m/s. 
Comparing the various different types, devices based on galloping or a combi­
nation of galloping and vortex-induced vibration appear to be potentially the 
most versatile in that they can respond over a wide range of flow speeds. Wake 
galloping devices of the kind demonstrated by Zhu et al. [39] also perform well 
in this respect. Flapping devices are attractive in principle because of their ex­
treme simplicity, with the most basic device consisting of just a metalized piezo­
electric flap. However, they tend to have relatively high cut-in speeds, and effi­
cient transduction is challenging because of the nature of the flapping response.
Regarding the HVAC scenario identified in Section 6.2, several of the 
energy harvesters discussed in this chapter could be deployed immediately in 
duct-monitoring applications. However, virtually all are much too large to be 
used outside a duct. For deployment in a room, for example, on an HVAC grill, 
a compact device is needed with a low profile. If oscillating harvesters are to be 
deployed in such applications, smaller devices will need to be developed that 
are short in the direction of flow, and this will require new device topologies. 
Downscaling is likely to be accompanied by some loss of performance, so the 
challenge will be to realize smaller devices that can still generate useful levels of 
power.

Vibration Energy Harvesting
Dibin Zhu
7.1  Introduction
Vibrations widely exist in the ambient environment. They are either conse­
quences of natural phenomenon, such as wind, or by-products of human activi­
ties, such as machinery, in human-made surroundings that provide the setting 
for human activity, also known as the built environment. In most circumstanc­
es, vibrations bring human beings some very unpleasant experiences, such as 
dizziness, headaches, or even nausea. Therefore, great efforts have been made to 
reduce vibrations in the built environment [1, 2]. However, vibrations can also 
be regarded as a form of kinetic energy that can potentially be converted into 
other forms of energy such as electrical energy and benefit our daily life. Such 
technology is called vibration energy harvesting or vibration energy scavenging.
Vibration energy harvesting concerns the conversion of wasted or unused 
ambient kinetic energy in the environment into small amount of electrical en­
ergy (from microwatts to milliwatts). This technology, as a new power source 
for small wireless electronic systems such as wireless sensors, has attracted in­
creasing attention in the past 20 years [3–6]. It aims to significantly extend 
the lifetime of batteries, which are the most common power sources for wire­
less electronics systems, or to replace the battery completely. This feature is of 
particular interest in some applications in the built environment. For example, 
wireless systems in some cases need to be deployed in harsh or remote environ­
ments. Therefore, it is difficult to access the wireless systems and replace or 
recharge their batteries. Also, if a large number of wireless devices need to be de­
ployed across a large area, replacement or recharging of batteries for all wireless 

158 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
devices is very costly. It is preferred for those wireless systems to have localized 
power supplies in such applications.  
Apart from vibration energy harvesting, there are other energy-harvesting 
techniques that can also be possible energy sources for wireless devices in the 
built environment [7], for example, photovoltaic [8], thermoelectric [9], and 
airflow energy harvesting [10], as well as wireless power transfer [11]. These 
energy-harvesting techniques have already been described in previous chapters. 
This chapter will focus on vibration energy-harvesting techniques and their ap­
plications in the built environment. 
The chapter is structured as follows. Vibration sources in buildings are 
first reviewed followed by discussion on potential applications for vibration 
energy harvesters in buildings. After that, modeling of vibration energy harvest­
ers including linear and nonlinear systems will be presented. Typical design 
procedures and performance evaluation methods will then be described and 
discussed. At last, three practical cases including a commercial kinetic energy 
harvester for building applications and two wireless sensor systems powered by 
vibration energy harvesters will be studied before the conclusion of the chapter. 
7.2  Vibration Sources in the Built Environment
Vibration in buildings is mainly produced by machinery in building manage­
ment systems [mainly heat, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems] 
as well as household appliances such as washing machines, freezers, and boilers.
7.2.1  HVAC
Vibration presented in the HVAC system is mainly from HVAC equipment 
such as fans, pumps, and compressors and normally contains wideband vibra­
tion spectrum. For rotating equipment, the main vibration frequencies are shaft 
rotation frequency (SRF) and blade passage frequency (BPF) as well as their 
harmonics and intermodulations. SRF and BPF are defined as:

RPM
SRF =
	
(7.1)
	
BPF
NB
SRF
=
×
	
(7.2)
where RPM is the rotation speed (revolutions per minute) and NB is number 
of blades.

 
Vibration Energy Harvesting 
159
For motors, the main frequencies are motor rotation frequency (MRF) 
which is identical to SRF and motor windings frequency (MWF) as well as their 
harmonics and intermodulations. MWF is given by:
	
2
m
MWF
f
=
×
	
(7.3)
where fm is the mains frequency (50 Hz for Europe and 60 Hz for the United 
States).
Table 7.1 summarizes vibration frequency ranges of different sources in 
HVAC systems. According to (7.1) and (7.2), vibration frequencies in HVAC 
systems are largely dependent on rotation speeds of HVAC equipment and they 
are likely to change from time to time when the flow rate inside HVAC ducts 
requires to be adjusted. Therefore, vibration in HVAC systems is likely to have 
broadband spectra.
7.2.2  Household Appliances
Figure 7.1 shows vibration spectra of some household appliances such as a 
chest freezer, microwave, combined boiler, tumble dryer, and washing machine 
when they are in operation. Vibration data shown here is downloaded from the 
Energy Harvesting Network Data Repository [13]. Vibration accelerations in 
three directions were collected using a PCB Piezotronics 354C03 tri-axial ac­
celerometer. The vibration spectra shown below were obtained by performing 
fast Fourier transform (FFT) on the respective time waveforms. Details on how 
these spectra were obtained can be found in [13].
It can be found in these spectra that vibration on almost every house­
hold appliance contains more than one peak. These peaks occur at the mains 
frequency (50 Hz in these cases as measurements were taken in the United 
Kingdom) and its harmonics. Figure 7.2 shows peak frequencies as a function 
of time. It was found that vibration peak frequencies (shown using horizontal 
white lines) from these appliances do not change much during their operation.

7.2.3  Summary
Vibration in buildings is mainly caused by machinery, such as HVAC equip­
ment and household appliances. Its vibration frequencies are strongly related 
to either the rotation speed of the motor or the mains frequency. In the former 
case, as the rotation speed of the motor depends on the usage of equipment, the 
vibration frequency is unpredictable and very likely to change occasionally. In 
the latter case, although the mains frequency cannot change in a particular area, 
vibration peaks also occur at its harmonics. Therefore, it can be concluded that 
vibration in buildings typically has a broadband spectrum that contains mul­
tiple peaks. Methods to design vibration energy harvesters for this application 
will be introduced later in this chapter.
7.3  Potential Applications
The main application for vibration energy harvesters is to power wireless sen­
sors. For vibration energy harvesters working in HVAC systems, there are po­
tentially two types of applications. First, self-powered wireless sensors such as 
acoustic sensors, temperature sensors, and strain gauges can be deployed to 
monitor condition of HVAC equipment such as fans, pumps, and compres­
sors. Data can be wirelessly transmitted to the central control unit to achieve

real-time condition monitoring. This can significantly reduce maintenance cost 
of the HVAC system. Second, wireless sensors such as pressure, temperature, 
humidity, and air-quality sensors powered by vibration energy harvesters can be 
deployed inside HVAC ducts to provide a real-time airflow profile. They can 
provide vital information to the building management system and enable intel­
ligent control of HVAC systems.
Vibration energy harvesters working on household appliances can be used 
as self-powered sensors that monitor energy usage of these appliances. As dis­
cussed in Section 7.2, vibration frequencies from household appliances do not 
change much during operation. Therefore, the energy that can be generated is 
mainly a function of time. This means that the more energy that the energy 
harvester can generate, the longer the appliance is operated and thus the more 
energy it consumes. In this case, the vibration energy harvester is only used 
to power a microcontroller and wireless module. The module monitors the 
amount of energy that the harvester generates and then analyzes and transmits 
the data of energy usage to the control unit. Such data can be used as a part of 
the smart meter system either to provide end user with real-time energy usage 
or to record overall energy usage for utility companies.

Figure 7.3 shows a generic model of a linear vibration energy harvester, which 
consists of a seismic mass, m and a spring with the spring constant of k. When 
the harvester vibrates, the mass moves out of phase with the harvester housing. 
b is the damping coefficient that consists of the mechanically induced damping 
(parasitic damping) coefficient bm and the electrically induced damping coeffi­
cient be, that is, b = bm + be. y(t) is the displacement of the harvester housing. To 
simplify the analysis, y(t) is assumed to be a sinusoidal input. z(t) is the relative 
motion of the mass with respect to the housing.
It is assumed that the mass of the vibration source is much greater than 
that of the seismic mass in the harvester and the vibration source is unaffected 
by the movement of the harvester. Then the movement of the mass with respect 
to the housing can be expressed using a typical second-order differential equa­
tion as:

where m is the mass, ζT is the total damping, Y is the tip displacement of the

various Q-factors (

). Output power in all cases is normalized to the 
maximum output power when Q is 200. It can be found that the energy har­
vester with a higher Q-factor (i.e., lower damping factor) has greater maximum 
output power at the resonant frequency. However, the output power drops sig­
nificantly if the operating frequency shifts away from the resonance. When the 
Q-factor is lower (i.e., the damping factor is higher), the peak output power 
decreases while the bandwidth of the energy harvester increases. In other words, 
the harvester becomes less sensitive to vibration frequency shifts at the expense 
of reduced maximum generated power.
When the energy harvester is at resonance, that is, ω = ωr, the total avail­
able power reaches maximum and is given by:

7.4.2  Transduction Methods for Vibration Energy Harvesters
A vibration energy harvester normally has one transducer to convert displace­
ment of the inertial mass or mechanical stress into electrical energy. Main 
transducers used in vibration energy harvesting include electromagnetic, piezo­
electric, and electrostatic. The former two are widely used. Therefore, in this 
section, focus will be on the electromagnetic and piezoelectric transducers.
7.4.2.1  Electromagnetic Transducer
The electromagnetic transducer is based on Faraday’s Law. Either the magnet 
or coil is attached to the resonator while the coil or magnet is placed on the 
harvester housing. During the operation, the relative movement between the 
magnet and coil induces an electric current in the coil. The electrically induced 
damping factor, ζe, is:

and Rc are load and coil resistances, respectively.
Substituting (7.13) into (7.8) and considering a = Yω2 lead to the expres­

7.4.2.2  Piezoelectric Transducer
Piezoelectric transducers consist of piezoelectric materials that convert me­
chanical energy into electrical energy. Piezoelectric materials (notably crystals 
and certain ceramics) are able to generate an electric potential in response to 
applied mechanical stress. The electrical polarization is proportional to the ap­
plied strain. Most common materials in piezoelectric energy harvesting include 
lead zirconate titanate (PZT) [15], polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) [16], and 
macro-fiber composite (MFC) [17]. Piezoelectric energy harvesters typically 
work in either 33 mode or 31 mode. In the 33 mode, both force and polar­
ization of the material has the same direction, such as the compression of a 
piezoelectric block that has electrodes on its top and bottom surfaces. In the 31 
mode, the applied force is in the direction perpendicular to the poling direc­
tion, an example of which is a bending beam that has electrodes on its top and 
bottom surfaces. Although the 31 mode has a lower coupling coefficient than 
the 33 mode, structures working in the 31 mode normally have higher stress 
and therefore potentially higher output power. Therefore, most piezoelectric 
energy harvesters have a structure such as cantilevers or double-clamped beam 
that works in the 31 mode. 
A model of the cantilever-based piezoelectric energy harvester was de­
veloped by Roundy et al. Only some key conclusions are presented here and 
detailed derivation can be found in [18]. The output power, P, of such a piezo­
electric energy harvester at resonance is given by:

7.4.3  Broadband Vibration Energy Harvesters
As shown in Figure 7.4, maximum power can be generated by a linear vibra­
tion energy harvester if its resonant frequency matches the ambient vibration 
frequency. Linear energy harvesters are usually designed to have high Q-factors 
for better performance. Therefore, their generated power drops dramatically if 
these two frequencies do not match. Most reported vibration energy harvesters 
are designed to work only at one particular frequency [4]. However, in most 
applications, such as building, moving vehicles, human movement, and wind-
induced vibration, the vibration frequency changes regularly. Thus, the efficien­
cy of linear energy harvesters with one fixed resonant frequency is significantly 
reduced since they do not always operate at resonance. This severely limits the 
practical deployment of linear vibration energy harvesters. There are two main 
solutions to increasing operational frequency range of vibration energy harvest­
ers [6]. These are frequency tuning and bandwidth widening. 
7.4.3.1  Frequency Tuning
For the first solution, a certain frequency tuning mechanism is applied to the 
energy harvester, either mechanically or electrically, so that its resonant fre­
quency can be adjusted. Mechanical tuning methods are realized by altering the 
mechanical properties of the vibration energy harvester. Practical mechanical 
tuning methods include moving the center of gravity of the inertial mass on 
the harvester [19], varying spring stiffness [20], and straining the mechanical 
structure [21]. Such methods normally consume a significant amount of power 
compared to the generated power. Electrical tuning methods are achieved by 
altering the electrical damping of the energy harvester via its electrical load [22]. 
These methods only require a small amount of energy to electronically select 
electrical loads for the energy harvesters and, therefore, consume much less en­
ergy than mechanical tuning methods. To achieve automatic frequency tuning, 
a closed-loop frequency tuning systems as shown in Figure 7.5 can be deployed 
to monitor the vibration frequency and implement the frequency tuning ac­
cordingly [23]. All these methods require extra energy to implement the tuning 
mechanism. Thus, they are also called active tuning methods.
To evaluate a tuning method, one important criterion is whether the en­
ergy harvester can generate positive net energy with a particular tuning method. 
As illustrated in Figure 7.6, t is the period of time from one vibration frequency 
change to the next vibration frequency change. Poff-resonance and Pin-resonance are 
output power of the energy harvester when it works off and in resonance, re­
spectively. tin-resonance is the time when the energy harvester operates in reso­
nance. Ptuning and ttuning are the power and time required to implement the 
tuning mechanism, respectively. The energy gain as a result of the frequency 
tuning, Eg, is given by:

(7.20)
The net energy, Enet, is defined as the difference between the energy gain 
from the frequency tuning and energy consumed in tuning, that is, Enet = Eg 
– Etuning. Positive net energy means that the energy harvester benefits from the 
frequency-tuning mechanism and generates excessive energy for powering elec­
tronic devices. However, if the net energy is negative, the tuning mechanism

Vibration Energy Harvesting

becomes unnecessary. To generate positive net energy, the tuning mechanism 
should consume the lowest possible power and be implemented in the shortest 
possible time. Furthermore, the energy harvester should operate at resonance in 
the longest possible time and the power gain by the tuning mechanism should 
be as high as possible. In other words, the tuning mechanism must be imple­
mented with a minimum duty cycle. Therefore, the frequency tuning mecha­
nism is not suitable for all applications. The most suitable scenario for this 
technique is where vibration frequency does not change very frequently so that 
the in-resonance harvester has enough time to accumulate enough energy to 
implement the tuning mechanism and produce excessive energy to power other 
electronics such as wireless sensors.
Other criteria to evaluate a frequency tuning mechanism are that the tun­
ing mechanism should achieve a sufficient operational frequency range and a 
suitable degree of frequency resolution. In addition, the tuning mechanism ap­
plied should not increase the damping within the effective tuning range and 
should be applicable to automatic frequency tracking. The selection of the 
frequency-tuning mechanism is largely dependent on applications. All above 
criteria must be carefully considered to design an efficient mechanism to im­
prove the performance of vibration energy harvesters in frequency-varying 
circumstances.
7.4.3.2  Bandwidth Widening
The second solution to increasing operational frequency range of vibration en­
ergy harvesters is to employ structures that have broadband response, such as 
Duffing’s nonlinear structures [24, 25], bistable structures [26, 27], and har­
vester arrays [28, 29]. This solution uses the intrinsic broadband response of 
mechanical structures to achieve increased operational frequency range. Hence, 
it does not consume energy. However, as there is no control mechanism in­
volved, it is difficult to alter the response of the structure once it is fabricated. 
Therefore, the design of such structures is more complex than design of tuning 
mechanisms. A detailed analysis of both Duffing’s nonlinear and bistable energy 
harvesters can be found in [30].
Duffing’s nonlinear structures can have either a hardening or softening 
spring which has the effect of shifting the resonant frequency upwards or down­
wards as shown in Figure 7.7. The bandwidth of this structure increases as 
the damping ratio, the nonlinearity, and the input acceleration increase. For a 
hard nonlinearity, this approach will only produce an improvement when the 
excitation frequency changes from a lower frequency to a higher frequency. For 
a soft nonlinearity, this approach will only produce an improvement when the 
excitation frequency changes from a higher frequency to a lower frequency. 
However, it is very difficult to predict how vibration frequency may change 

174 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
in some applications. Therefore, practical applications of Duffing’s nonlinear 
energy harvesters are limited.
A bistable structure consists of two equilibrium positions as A and B in 
Figure 7.8. When the bistable structure is excited by an external force, the in­
ertial mass, or a shuttle, travels between the two equilibrium positions as long 
as the input energy is greater than the threshold energy. In other words, if the 
external excitation is high enough to overcome the threshold, the shuttle can 
travel between the two equilibrium positions at any frequency. In other words, 
operation of a bistable energy harvester is independent of excitation frequency 
if the excitation amplitude is high enough.
An energy harvester array consists of multiple energy harvesters that have 
different resonant frequencies. The overall power spectrum of the harvester array 
is the superposition of all power spectra of each individual harvester. Therefore, 
the harvester array has a broadband response as shown in Figure 7.9. However, 
in cases where only a few vibration peaks are present, not all energy harvesters 
contribute to the overall output, which makes them volume-inefficient. Further­
more, when more than one energy harvester contributes to the overall output, it 
is likely that the outputs of these individual energy harvesters are out of phase. 
Therefore, if they are connected directly and fed into one power-conditioning

Vibration Energy Harvesting

circuit, they can cancel each other to some extent and reduce the overall output 
power. To solve this problem, each energy harvester should have its own power-
conditioning circuit, which increases the complexity of the circuit design.
7.4.4  Scaling Effect of Vibration Energy Harvesters
Recent development in microelectromechanical system (MEMS) sensors and 
microfabrication process has seen growing research in the area of micro-scaled 
vibration energy harvesters [31]. These miniature devices can potentially be in­
tegrated into chip sized sensors and wireless modules to provide localized power 
supply. In order to design effective energy harvesters to meet such requirements, 
it is crucial to understand scaling effects for vibration energy harvesters. As most 
reported vibration energy harvesters consist of a cantilever structure [4], this 
section will focus on scaling effects of cantilever-based vibration energy harvest­
ers. However, conclusions drawn in this section also apply to vibration energy 
harvesters with other mechanical structures. 
7.4.4.1  Resonant Frequency

Figure 7.12 compares the tuning ratios of various scaled cantilever beams

tion, when the structure is scaled down, it can be tuned to a higher resonant

frequency under the same tensile force. In other words, a smaller structure re­
quires less tensile force to achieve the same tuning ratio. This means that tuning 
the resonant frequency of a MEMS-scale vibration energy harvester consumes 
less energy than tuning a macro-scale vibration energy harvester.
7.4.4.3  Output Power
The output power of a vibration energy harvester can be estimated using (7.12). 
In the first scenario, it is assumed that both excitation acceleration, a, and open-
circuit quality factor, QOC, remain unchanged when the energy harvester is 
scaled. If the energy harvester is scaled by a factor of n (the structure is scaled 
up when n > 1 and the structure is scaled down when 0 < n < 1), its output 
power, Pe_sa can be derived by substituting (7.24) and (7.26) into (7.12) and is 
given by:

It can be found that under the same excitation acceleration, the output 
power of the scaled energy harvester is proportional to the scaling factor to the 
power of four. This means that MEMS vibration energy harvesters can generate 
much less output power than macro-scaled energy harvesters under the same 
excitation acceleration. 
The output power of a vibration energy harvester can also be estimated 
using (7.10). In the second scenario, it is assumed that both excitation am­
plitude, Y, and mechanical damping, ζm, factor remain unchanged when the 
energy harvester is scaled. If the energy harvester is scaled by a factor of n (the 
structure is scaled up when n > 1 and the structure is scaled down when 0 < n < 
1), its output power, Pe_sy can be derived by substituting (7.24) and (7.26) into 
(7.10) and is given by:

tude of the MEMS vibration energy harvester is relatively small compared to 
that of the macro-scaled energy harvester. 
7.5  Design and Evaluation of Vibration Energy Harvesters
7.5.1  Design Procedure of Vibration Energy Harvesters
Figure 7.13 shows a typical design flow diagram for vibration energy harvest­
ers. Vibration data for the particular application should be acquired first. The 
vibration data is then analyzed thoroughly in both frequency (using FFT) and 
time domains. Based on the characteristics of the vibration, a suitable type of 
vibration energy harvesters can be selected. Based on the analysis in the previ­
ous sections in this chapter, the selection process for vibration energy harvesters 
is summarized in the flow diagram shown in Figure 7.14. Once the type of the

vibration energy harvester is determined, the energy harvester can be designed 
using either analytical methods or computational simulation in both mechani­
cal and electrical domains. After the design process, the practical device can be 
fabricated and tested. Evaluation methods of vibration energy harvesters will be 
described in Section 7.5.2. Experimental results will then be compared with the 
design specifications and decisions will be made on whether the design needs to

7.5.2.1  Typical Evaluation Method
To date, the most common method used to characterize a vibration energy har­
vester is to excite the energy harvester under sinusoidal vibrations with various 
frequencies around the resonant frequency of the energy harvester [4]. During 
the experiments, the output voltages of the energy harvester, V, across various 
resistive loads, R, are measured and its output power, P, can be calculated by:

Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
The optimum resistive load is the electrical load connected when the out­
put power reaches maximum. This method provides indication of the maxi­
mum power that can be transferred to the electrical domain (i.e., the maximum 
usable power).
The energy harvester can also be evaluated by rectifying its output to 
charge an energy storage device, such as a supercapacitor. The charging rate 
reflects the amount of output power the energy harvester can generate, that is, 
the faster the energy storage device can be charged, the more power the energy 
harvester can produce. This method cannot necessarily indicate the maximum 
output power that the harvester can generate. However, it is closer to the practi­
cal application scenario. After all, in most cases, output of the energy harvester 
needs to be stored before it can be used to power the load electronics.
Exciting the vibration energy harvester under a sinusoidal signal is the 
most straightforward way of evaluating its performance. This method is ideal 
for applications where only one frequency peak is present in the vibration spec­
trum. However, in most practical applications, the vibration spectrum usually 
contains more than one peak at different frequencies [13, 33]. In these scenar­
ios, this simple evaluation method cannot provide accurate evaluation of linear 
vibration energy harvesters.
7.5.2.2  Performance of a Linear Vibration Energy Harvester Under Excitations with 
Multiple Peaks
A previous study shows that vibration peaks at frequencies other than the reso­
nant frequency can reduce output power of a linear energy harvester [34]. Con­
sidering there are two peaks in the vibration spectrum as shown in Figure 7.15, 
one peak is at the resonant frequency of the linear energy harvester, fo, and has 
an amplitude of G(fo). The other peak is at frequency, fi, and has an amplitude 
of G(fi). This peak is defined as the interference peak and its frequency is called 
interference frequency. Figure 7.16 shows the time signal of the vibration with 
a spectrum as in Figure 7.15. The vibration spectrum looks reasonably simple, 
Figure 7.15  Vibration containing two peaks, the resonant frequency of the vibration energy 
harvester, fo, and the interference frequency, fi.

 
Vibration Energy Harvesting

but the time signal is much more complex. This makes it more difficult to 
predict the performance of vibration energy harvesters under such excitations.
Research in [34] also shows that when a linear vibration energy harvester 
is excited under such an excitation, its output power reduces more as the ampli­
tude of the interference peak increases. Furthermore, the greater the difference 
between the resonant frequency and the interference frequency, the more reduc­
tion in output power will be. Therefore, it is recommended that when design­
ing a linear vibration energy harvester for multiple-peak broadband vibrations, 
the energy harvester should be designed to match to the lowest possible peak 
frequency. 
7.5.2.3  Case Study
In this case study, a piezoelectric linear vibration energy harvester was tested un­
der vibration taken from a PZL-SW4 helicopter. Its output was used to charge 
Figure 7.16  Time signal of the vibration having two tones: (a) signals of the two example 
tones and (b) combined signal.

184 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
capacitors and the charging rate was compared with that when excited with a 
sinusoidal vibration at the resonant frequency. 
Figure 7.17 shows the vibration spectrum taken from the vertical stabi­
lizer on a PZL SW-4 helicopter [34]. Data was taken when the helicopter was 
flying horizontally at 200 km/h and at an altitude of 1,000m with an outside 
air temperature of 10.5°C. The main rotor rotational speed was 103% where 
100% = 7.288 Hz. There are six main peaks in the spectrum below 100 Hz as 
listed in Table 7.2.
Figure 7.18 shows the piezoelectric linear vibration energy harvester used 
in the test. It has a bimorph structure and was fabricated using screen print­
ing technology. The energy harvester has a T-shape cantilever to reduce its tip 
displacement. Details of the energy harvester can be found in [35]. Its resonant 
frequency can be tuned by adjusting the cantilever length to match the vibra­
tion frequency before installation. In this application, the resonant frequency 
of the energy harvester was tuned to around 67.5 Hz to match Peak 4 in the 
vibration spectrum shown in Figure 7.17. 
Figure 7.19 shows the test circuit. The ac voltage generated by the energy 
harvester is rectified using a bridge rectifier. The rectified dc voltage then charg­
es a storage capacitor. To protect the storage capacitor from overcharge, an over­
voltage protection circuit was deployed to limit the maximum voltage across 
the storage capacitor. A voltage detector, Torex XC61C, was used to monitor 
the capacitor voltage. When the capacitor voltage reaches the threshold voltage

of the detector, the detector outputs a high level that turns on the MOSFET, 
M, and the storage capacitor is discharged through a 1-kΩ resistor. When the 
capacitor voltage drops below the threshold voltage of the detector, the detector 
outputs a low level that turns off the MOSFET, M, and the storage capacitor 
can be charged.

Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
In the first test, the energy harvester was excited under a sinusoidal vibra­
tion of 0.41gpk (1g = 9.8m·s–2) at 67.5 Hz, which matches Peak 4 in Figure 
7.17 and is also the resonant frequency of the energy harvester. In the second 
test, the energy harvester was excited under the vibration with the spectrum as 
shown in Figure 7.17. In both tests, output of the energy harvester was used to 
charge two storage capacitors, 100 µF and 90 mF, respectively. Charging plots 
were logged as shown in Figure 7.20 for comparisons. 
Results showed that the capacitors were charged more quickly when ex­
cited at the sinusoidal vibration than when excited at the practical vibration. 
Furthermore, when the load capacitance became larger, the final voltage was 
lower. This is because the resonant frequency of the energy harvester decreases 
slightly with the increase of the capacitive load. As the excitation frequency did 
not change, it did not match the changed resonant frequency of the energy 
harvester. Therefore, its output power is reduced.
7.5.2.4  Summary 
Both output power and voltage of energy harvesters that are designed to work 
at one frequency will be reduced when excited under vibration with peaks at 
multiple frequencies. The reason for this is as follows: Although all peaks in the 
frequency domain are clearly separated and do not interfere with each other, the 
waveform in the time domain is actually the superposition of sinusoid wave­
forms with various frequencies. As these waveforms are not always in phase, 
they may partially cancel each other and thus the output is reduced when ex­
cited under vibration with multiple peaks compared to that under pure sinu­
soidal vibration. 
In summary, when evaluating performance of energy harvesters, it is rec­
ommended that harvesters should be tested under practical vibrations to get 
a better understanding of their performance because a basic fixed sinusoidal 
excitation is likely to exaggerate output powers.

7.6  Case Study
At the moment, vibration energy harvesters are mainly used in structural health 
monitoring in industry and transportation. However, their application in 
buildings has not been investigated extensively. To date, the only commercial 
vibration energy harvester for building applications is available from EnOcean 
GmbH [36]. It is not a traditional type of vibration energy harvesters as men­
tioned in the previous sections in this chapter. The operation of this harvester

quency of 67.5 Hz; 2: Excited at practical vibrations).

Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
is based on mechanical impact, such as a click of button. In addition to the 
EnOcean energy harvester, two more cases of wireless sensors used in structural 
health monitoring powered by vibration energy harvesters will be presented. 
Although they were not designed for building applications, they have demon­
strated the possibility of converting ambient vibrations into electrical energy 
and using such energy to power wireless sensors. Likewise, it is feasible that 
electrical energy can be converted from vibration presenting in buildings and 
power wireless nodes. Therefore, these examples can be regarded as benchmarks 
for future self-powered wireless sensors for building applications. 
7.6.1  EnOcean ECO 200 Energy Converter
EnOcean GmbH has commercialized a kinetic energy converter ECO 200 [37] 
in which mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy. It was reported 
that one clicking of the mechanical spring can generate a minimum useful elec­
trical energy of 120 µJ, which is sufficient to enable three transmissions from 
the EnOcean transmitter module PTM 330. Existing applications for this self-
powered module include a battery-less wireless light switch, BMAC London 
Buses, BSC Computer Mouse Traps, Eltako window/door switches, Hoppe 
window/door switches, SEMD cable harnesses in automobile, and Aiphone 
(Japan) nurse calling systems. A list of more comprehensive applications of this 
device can be found in [38].
7.6.2  A Credit Card-Sized Wireless Sensor
The self-powered wireless sensor (also called smart tag) has dimensions similar 
to a credit card (i.e., 85 × 55 × 3 mm). Its low-profile feature enables it to be 
fabricated within a composite material and thus embedded in the structure of 
an aircraft to monitor structural health and transmit measurement data wire­
lessly to the base station during the flight.

The layout of the smart tag is shown in Figure 7.22(a). It consists of a 
screen-printed, thick-film, piezoelectric energy harvester [35], its power-con­
ditioning circuit, a supercapacitor for energy storage, sensors including an ac­
celerometer (ADXL 345 [39]), a temperature (TMP 112 [40]), and a pressure

sensor (MPL115A2 [41]) as well as a wireless module (CC2430 [42]). All com­
ponents are sealed in a thin box for protection as shown in Figure 7.22(b). 
Figure 7.23 shows the system diagram of the smart tag. The ac output 
from the piezoelectric energy harvester is first rectified by a bridge rectifier to 
charge a supercapacitor (Cap-XX 0.55F [43]). A cold start circuit [44] is used 
to make sure that there is sufficient energy to enable measurement and trans­
mission before activating the system. Once the capacitor voltage reaches the 
threshold voltage, the cold start circuit enables the step-up voltage regulator 
(TPS61097 [45]) and the system is activated. The power-conditioning circuit 
is shown in Figure 7.24. All sensors communicate with the microcontroller unit 
on the I2C BUS.
When the system was activated, the microcontroller turned on only some 
basic functions to allow sensors to measure and transmit the data to the micro­
controller. Once the measurement data was received, it then switched on the 
radio frequency (RF) transmitter to wirelessly transmit data to the base station 
and then the microcontroller was switched to sleep mode and waited to be 
activated.
In the test, the smart tag was excited under a sinusoidal vibration of 67.5 
Hz and peak vibration amplitude of 0.4 g (3.9 m∙s−2). The vibration frequency

matches the resonant frequency of the energy harvester. Figure 7.25(a) shows 
time sequence of the system when the threshold voltage is 2V. It is found in the 
test that the overall operating time for the system to finish measurement and 
transmission of data is 284 ms in which 90 bits of data are transmitted as shown 
in Figure 7.25(b). 
This case study shows that a low-cost, thick-film, piezoelectric energy 
harvester can be used to power conventional off-the-shelf low-power sensors 
and wireless modules relatively straightforwardly. It is worth mentioning that 
using intelligent impedance matching mechanisms [46] can improve efficiency 
of power-conditioning circuits. However, all these methods require additional 
energy. It is therefore not practical for low-power energy harvesters generating 
output power of a few hundred microwatts at the current state of development. 
7.6.3  Perpetuum Battery-Free Rail-Monitoring System
Perpetuum Ltd. [47] has developed a battery-free wireless sensor node that is 
powered by the Perpetuum vibration energy harvester. The wireless module 
can be easily mounted next to the train wheel as shown in Figure 7.26. When 
the train is running, the vibration energy harvester converts ambient vibration 
into electrical energy. The electrical energy is used to power the wireless sensor 
that monitors the condition of axle bearings. The data can be transmitted over 
a long range through General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) networks. Relative 
information can be accessed via remote a Web site to achieve real-time condi­
tion monitoring. The condition monitoring process is shown in Figure 7.27.
As all wireless sensor nodes are powered by the energy generated from 
the ambient vibration, they require no maintenance once installed and can last 
much longer than traditional battery-powered sensors. In addition, real-time 
condition monitoring enables improved rail safety and a significant reduction 
in operating costs by “moving from a ‘Fail and Fix’ environment to a ‘Predict 
and Prevent’ system” [47].
7.7  Conclusions
Vibration, as a kind of kinetic energy, can be converted into electrical energy by 
a vibration energy harvester to power small electronic devices, such as wireless 
sensors. In buildings, vibration normally occurs in two scenarios: machinery 
in building management systems, for example, equipment in HVAC systems, 
and household appliances such as washing machines, freezers, and boilers. Vi­
bration frequencies in the HVAC systems are largely dependent on the rota­
tion speed of the equipment while those in household appliances are mainly 
the mains frequency and its harmonics. Therefore, vibration spectra in both 
scenarios contain more than one vibration peak and are thus broadband. Tra­

Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
ditional linear vibration energy harvesters cannot always work in these applica­
tions because previous research has shown that performance of linear vibration 
energy harvesters can be worsened if they are excited under broadband vibra­
tions. Vibration energy harvesters with a wide operational frequency range such 
as frequency tunable vibration energy harvesters, harvester arrays, Duffing’s 
nonlinear, and bistable energy harvesters can be considered in these scenarios. 
The selection of vibration energy harvesters depends dominantly on practical 
applications. Therefore, vibration profiles in both time and frequency domains 
need to be studied to choose the most suitable type of vibration energy harvest­
ers. A flow diagram showing how to choose suitable vibration energy harvesters 
is provided in this chapter.
It is worth mentioning that the performance of vibration energy harvest­
ers is also strongly related to their physical dimensions. A fundamental model

shows that output power of a vibration energy harvester is proportional to its 
mass. In addition, when a vibration energy harvester is scaled, its resonant fre­
quency is inversely proportional to the scaling factor and its output power is 
proportional to the scaling factor to the power of four if the acceleration level 
remains the same. This means that the smaller the vibration energy harvester 
is, the higher its resonant frequency and the lower its output power are. The 
decision on the practical size of the vibration energy harvester should be made 
based on both power requirement and space available. Furthermore, it is recom­
mended to use practical vibrations when evaluating performance of a vibration 
energy harvester because a basic fixed sinusoidal excitation is likely to exagger­
ate output powers.   
Vibration energy harvesters do not normally contain expensive or rare 
materials as in thermoelectric energy harvesters. Therefore, their manufactur­
ing cost is relatively low. With mass production, the unit price of commercial 
vibration energy harvesters, such as EnOcean ECO 200, has now been reduced 
to below $10, which is compatible to traditional power sources such as bat­
teries. Furthermore, vibration energy harvesters consist of robust mechanical 
structures that require very minimum maintenance after installation. They are 
resistant to dusts that are common in the built environment and are detrimental 
to solar cells. Comparing to other energy-harvesting devices, the lower manu­
facturing and maintenance cost of vibration energy harvesters makes it a more 
promising solution to powering low-power electronic devices such as wireless 
sensors. However, due to the limitation of the vibration sources in buildings 
and the physical restraints of the vibration energy harvesters, it is not possible 
to use them to power more power-hungry devices such as small electric motors. 
These devices can be powered using solar energy harvesters [48] and thermal 
energy harvesters [49] instead.   
In conclusion, vibration energy-harvesting technology has been demon­
strated successfully in powering wireless sensors both in the lab and commer­
cially. Although they have not been widely used in buildings yet, with further 
development of novel vibration energy-harvesting techniques and low-power 
electronics, it is very promising that wireless sensors powered by vibration en­
ergy harvesters will have more applications in buildings, especially as an impor­
tant part of intelligent building management systems.

The Future of Energy Harvesting in 
Buildings 
Joseph W. Matiko and Stephen P. Beeby
8.1  Future Trends in Energy Harvesting 
There are clear applications for energy harvesting in buildings and with the 
emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) gave a significant future in the 
practical application of the technology. Making buildings more secure, more 
comfortable, more connected, and more energy efficient will be a significant 
application for the IoT and therefore for energy harvesting. It is also fair to say 
that applications, specifically in buildings, are unlikely to drive developments 
in energy harvesting. There are two main reasons for this. First, as we have seen 
in this book, the available energy harvesting sources are application-dependent 
and in some application scenarios the choices can be quite limited. It is clear 
the opportunities for solar and radio frequency (RF) harvesting are widespread 
and inductive power transfer (IPT) hardware similarly could also be incorpo­
rated readily into rooms. Other sources such as thermal and kinetic harvesting 
will not be quite so ubiquitous and will be more limited to certain locations. 
However, as discussed below, there are many application locations where kinetic 
energy and thermal energy harvesters can be applied and they will provide a 
valuable option for powering IoT devices in practice.
The second, and more significant, reason has to do with the philosophy 
and approach in the building industry. On the whole, the building industry 
is quite conservative and the adoption of new technologies can be slow and 
difficult to make happen. This stems in part from the business case; the conse­
quences of unreliability and poor performance could be costly for contractors 

200 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
and, as a result, the industry is very risk-adverse. The uptake in wireless tech­
nologies, IoT and therefore energy harvesting in buildings is likely to be driven 
by technology-aware architects, their clients, and/or the building occupiers who 
actually benefit from the functionality that the wireless systems provide. For ex­
ample, improved environmental control will lead to a more comfortable work­
ing environment leading to improved productivity and reduced absenteeism, 
a great benefit to the occupier, but not really a concern of the contractor who 
actually built the building.  
Nonetheless, we saw in Chapter 2 that many energy sources are present 
in typical built environments and the energy densities that are available are suf­
ficient at present to power autonomous wireless systems. However, energy den­
sity is only one consideration; the prevalence of the energy source must also be 
considered. For example, of the various energy-harvesting techniques covered, 
solar harvesting may not have the highest energy density but will be often be the 
first choice, with light being present in the majority of applications. RF power is 
also generally ubiquitous within buildings but levels of power available will vary 
widely across locations. There is considerable ongoing research in both of these 
topics aimed at improving materials, assembly processes, and circuit designs to 
increase the amount of energy harvested. These avenues of research are yielding 
improvements and, at the same time, the energy consumption of electronics 
and sensor systems is falling. The resulting reduction in the gap between the 
energy supplied and energy consumed will benefit all applications of energy 
harvesting, including those in buildings. IPT could also readily be incorporated 
into buildings in the future and, as ongoing research progresses towards increas­
ing efficiency leading to increased power levels and transfer distances, this could 
also be a viable option. Advances in kinetic and thermal energy harvesting will 
also enable these to become more widely used in future. The following sections 
briefly discuss the research challenges in each of the energy-harvesting technol­
ogy areas and looks at the future capabilities of the technologies.
8.1.1  Photovoltaic Research 
Solar research is largely driven by the renewables sector targeting wavelengths 
and intensities experienced outdoors in sunlight. Cost is also a key driver, with 
the cost of silicon-based technologies in particular being a factor in restrict­
ing adoption. Research into new solar technologies such as perovskite photo­
voltaics, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) and organic photovoltaics offer the 
potential to be lower-cost, thin, flexible, and suitable for a wider range of il­
luminating light sources potentially making them attractive for indoor applica­
tions. In terms of efficiency, a multicrystalline silicon cell is around 21% and 
the more expensive and less common single-crystal silicon cell is roughly 25% 
efficient. Of the newer, nonsilicon-based technologies, DSSCs have reached ap­

 
The Future of Energy Harvesting in Buildings  
201
proximately 12% and have started to become available commercially. They are 
well suited to indoor light conditions and can be fabricated in thin translucent 
sheets that can be placed between two panes of glass, hence making windows 
and building facades potentially energy harvesters. The long-term stability of 
DSSCs remains a concern and this is the focus of much ongoing research. The 
story is similar for organic solar cells with some commercial cells being available 
and a maximum efficiency of 11.5%. Perovskite cells look very promising hav­
ing demonstrated 22% efficiency in the laboratory but these are yet to be trans­
ferred into production. Perovskite cells are receiving the maximum research 
attention out of all the solar technologies, but it will be 2019 at the earliest 
before cells will be available in meaningful numbers. In summary, photovoltaic 
(PV) efficiencies will continue to edge up, costs will fall, and small-scale energy-
harvesting applications will benefit from these advances.
8.1.2  RF Energy Harvesting
RF harvesting is attractive because nowadays we are surrounded by radio waves 
and these do not fluctuate significantly through the day or disappear at night. 
However, the available power does vary depending upon the proximity to the 
RF source with attenuation being described by the Friis transmission equation. 
To give an idea of the variation in power densities available, a city-wide RF 
spectral survey was carried out across London by Imperial College London [1]. 
Readings were taken outside all 270 London Underground stations. Results 
demonstrated that digital television (DTV), GSM900, GSM1800 and 3G are 
the highest contributors but power levels vary from over 1 µW/cm2 down to 
sub-nW/cm2. Considering potential RF harvester performance, it has been es­
timated that more than 220 of the surveyed locations are suitable for ambient 
RF energy harvesting [2]. This survey was performed outdoors and RF power 
levels indoors are more difficult to predict with RF propagation being affected 
by building design and layout, the construction materials used and even the 
proximity of furniture and other equipment. Another consideration is the effect 
of using the RF energy harvesters, which could lead to areas of poor RF recep­
tion for some communication devices. One way around this is to deliberately 
broadcast RF power at a particular frequency and this could be further im­
proved using beam steering to focus on particular sensor node locations. Care 
has to be taken to ensure that humans are not subject to RF power levels above 
the prescribed maximum limits that vary depending upon the country. 
For every RF harvester-powered system, the antenna is a key component 
and this must be impedance matched with the receiver circuit to maximize 
the energy captured. Antennas and circuits must be carefully codesigned for 
each application. The received energy must then be rectified and potentially 
multiplied to obtain a useful dc voltage. Energy may be buffered in a storage 

202 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
capacitor depending upon the requirements of the application. Bringing the 
systems together and maximizing power conversion efficiency and ultimately 
overall systems efficiency while also considering other parameters such as mini­
mizing the sensitivity (the minimum power required by the receiver circuit to 
function) is a complex engineering challenge with many avenues for ongoing 
research. Given the ubiquity of ambient RF and the interest in the IoT, the mo­
tivation for improved circuit, system, and antenna designs is evident.
8.1.3  Inductive and Resonant Power Transfer
IPT and resonant wireless power technologies have advanced steadily over 
recent years and commercial systems are available for recharging electric ve­
hicles and mobile phones. Indeed, chargers for smart phones can be found 
in McDonald’s restaurants and Starbucks cafés. The emergence of competing 
standards and the number of companies involved are clear evidence of the in­
terest in this technology. The two main competing standards are the AirFuel 
Alliance and the Wireless Power Consortium. The Wireless Power Consortium 
supports the Qi (pronounced “chee”) standard, which has been used in over 
1,000 products and over 50 million devices worldwide to date. In contrast to 
Qi, the Airfuel Alliance covers larger coils, supports multiple device charging 
and improved resonant operation (i.e., longer range), but has fewer users and is 
more complicated to implement. 
The operation at resonance is the key for improving efficiency and in­
creasing operating ranges. Areas for research include coil configurations (e.g., 
flexible coils for textile applications, electronic circuits for reliable tuned opera­
tion, and amplifier circuits for efficient power transfer). Given that this tech­
nology is capable of safely transferring watts of power enabling rapid charging 
of devices, then it is highly likely this will be further developed into a viable 
wireless-powering platform suitable for use in buildings.
8.1.4  Kinetic Energy Harvesting
Kinetic harvesting will enable certain applications, and while these will be 
limited to particular locations, actually the opportunities are quite pervasive. 
The members of the EnOcean Alliance [3], for example, have already created 
hundreds of products using kinetic energy harvesting that have been installed 
in millions of units in buildings worldwide and it is fair to expect this trend 
to continue. Products that exploit the technology include any form of switch 
(e.g., light, shutter, key card, or panic buttons) and handles (window or door). 
Harvesting energy from vibrations can be used to monitor building plants and 
equipment and even consumer goods. Vibration energy harvesters are typically 
tuned to work at particular frequency that matches the characteristic vibrations 
of the machine. It is fortunate that machines powered by mains electricity often 

 
The Future of Energy Harvesting in Buildings  
203
exhibit vibrations at the frequency of the mains electricity making and there­
fore vibration harvesters tuned to 50 or 100 Hz (first harmonic) will work on 
most equipment (60 or 120 Hz in the United States). Such harvesters are com­
mercially available from Perpetuum Ltd. [4]. These are designed to power and 
enable wireless condition monitoring of plant and machinery in industry but 
would function equally well in building applications provided there was suf­
ficient space for the harvester. However, they are somewhat overengineered for 
building applications where over excitation and impacts are unlikely to occur 
and Atmosphères Explosibles (ATEX) certification for hazardous environments 
is not relevant. Therefore, there is room for further development in this tech­
nology to realize lower-cost harvesters that maintain the reliability but without 
the level of engineering present in the industrial harvesters. 
Another location where kinetic energy harvesters could be used is inside 
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) ducts. There, energy can be 
tapped from the moving airflow although the speed of the air can be quite vari­
able and start at velocities as low as 1.5 m/s. Such velocities can be too low for 
conventional rotating turbine-based approaches to start and alternative oscillat­
ing wing harvesters such as those described in Chapter 6 can be better suited to 
these applications. The efficiency of oscillating harvesters is lower than for ro­
tational devices and there is room for improving the output of such harvesters.
Other future opportunities also include smart floors and other pieces of 
standard hardware such as door closers where kinetic energy could easily be 
converted. Smart floors could exploit the footfall of building occupants in man­
ner similar to that demonstrated by the Pavegen technology [5]. As always, cost 
is a key consideration, but it is clear that there are substantial opportunities for 
kinetic energy harvesting at key locations such as doorways, lift entrances, or 
busy thoroughfares.  
8.1.5  Thermal Energy Harvesters
Thermoelectric energy harvesting does also present good opportunities for 
powering devices in buildings. Energy sources are potentially widely available 
from hot water and heating pipes, but these may be seasonal or intermittent. 
For example, heating systems are switched off in the summer months and hot 
water pipes only become hot when the supply is used. Once a hot water tap is 
turned off, the hot water sits in the pipe and soon begins to cool. Nevertheless, 
there is a fundamental link between the temperature of such pipes and opportu­
nity for thermal energy harvesting that it provides and the need to use wireless 
sensors to control the heating systems. The savings in energy costs and reduced 
CO2 emissions from effective control of heating systems would be significant. 
The ability to retrofit wireless controls is also invaluable and this represents a 
huge opportunity for the industry and energy harvesting technology. Thermal 

204 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
energy harvesting can also enable condition monitoring of building plant and 
equipment. 
Areas for future research are driven by the need to find alternative materi­
als and fabrication processes. The reliance of thermoelectric generators on bis­
muth telluride (Bi2Te3) and antimony telluride (Sb3Te3) depends upon a supply 
of tellurium, which is one of the scarcest elements and not a viable long-term 
option. State-of-the-art nanofabrication techniques can be used with a wider 
range of materials as a method for improving overall performance and offsetting 
the inferior material properties by exploiting the properties of nanostructures. 
For example, nanowires are known to conduct electricity freely while their high 
aspect ratio structure can scatter phonons and reduce thermal conductivity. This 
is a complex topic with many parameters affecting nanostructure performance 
such as diameter, crystal properties, and material defects, but there is consider­
able scope for new materials and fabrication processes to replace conventional, 
low-efficiency thermoelectric devices. 
8.2  Future Related Applications 
There is a huge amount of interest in the IoT where everything is connected and 
this will certainly be the case in smart buildings and homes in the future. For 
any device not plugged directly into the mains electricity supply, reliable wire­
less operation and the supply of power will be essential ingredients for achiev­
ing robust operation. Batteries will initially power such autonomous connected 
devices but, as the numbers of these increases, the need to change or recharge 
batteries will become an increasing inconvenience. Methods to automatically 
recharge such devices and minimize the level of intervention by the users will 
be very useful. Energy harvesting and wireless power transfer techniques (RF 
and inductive) will be significant enabling technologies for the practical imple­
mentation of IoT.
Wearable devices are arguably a subset of the IoT and are another topic 
receiving considerable and growing attention. Wearable technologies are body-
worn devices for monitoring the individual and his or her surroundings. At 
present, we are most familiar with devices such as smart watches and Google 
glasses, but the technology is rapidly evolving and new innovations and meth­
ods of interacting are being demonstrated. For example, devices have appeared 
that can be worn as jewelry, such as a wristband or pendant necklace (Shine by 
Misfit). While much of the functionality offered by early wearable devices mim­
icked that available in smart phone (e.g., pedometer), it has rapidly advanced 
to include more detailed information about the user including heart rate, blood 
oxygen levels, and even muscle movements. 

 
The Future of Energy Harvesting in Buildings  
205
There is huge potential for wearable technologies to advance into other 
forms. Despite the growing range of forms of wearable device, there is no one 
single option that suits all users. For example, the number of watches sold per 
year is declining and not everyone has or wants a smart phone. One potential 
solution to this is electronic textiles (e-textiles), but these are in their infancy 
and are presently characterized by poor levels of integration and manual as­
sembly. Examples of commercial devices are limited to basic functionality such 
as textile electrodes for sensing heart rate with the actual electronics and data 
processing being implemented in conventional electronic modules that must 
be removed. Another commercial example is ski jackets with simple switches 
embedded in the sleeve for controlling music players. These simply use em­
bedded switches and conventional wires and connectors. One reason for the 
limited embedded functionality is the fact that wearable textile applications are 
physically highly demanding (especially aspects such as washing) and practi­
cal, reliable, and robust methods for integrating sensors and electronics have 
not yet been demonstrated. Research in this area is growing and in the future 
e-textiles will represent an invisible form of wearable technology that is univer­
sally acceptable. 
Another aspect of wearable technology that will continue to develop and 
expand is the number of parameters that can be sensed and reported, and this 
is where is can become relevant to smart buildings. Wearable technologies will 
increasingly be used for environmental sensing applications monitoring the 
temperature, humidity, and pollution levels in the user’s immediate environ­
ment. This opens up increasing opportunities for distributed crowd sensing 
providing a dynamic sensing platform for gathering large amount of data. Such 
environmental sensing has applications in buildings and homes. By monitoring 
an individual’s location, buildings could provide personalized environmental 
control. Wearable technology could also improve the reliability of active switch­
ing on and off of building services such as lighting and thereby improve the us­
ability of energy saving measures. Combining these parameters with the ability 
to monitor a user’s activity and biosignals can further fine-tune an operation 
enabling a smart, user-aware building control system. 
Wearable technologies, like any autonomous IoT device, require power 
and at present are typically battery-powered. Batteries could be augmented 
and recharged using energy harvesting and this presents an entirely different 
challenge for the energy-harvesting community to that discussed in this book. 
While many of the transduction mechanisms presented in this book will apply 
equally well to this application, the method of implementation and form of the 
harvester will be very different. For example, kinetic energy harvesters that cap­
ture kinetic energy from human motion are very different to those designed for 
machine applications or light switches. The kinetic watches exemplify human-
powered kinetic harvesters but harvesting energy from footfall or the relative 

206 
Applications of Energy Harvesting Technologies in Buildings 
motion at joints also present opportunities. IPT techniques could be another 
solution for recharging wearable devices while the user is, for example, sitting in 
an armchair. The practicalities of any energy harvesting or wireless power trans­
fer approach present real research and design challenges. This is a vast subject 
area and easy enough for a book in its own right, but it is clear that the increas­
ing interaction between individuals and the smart environments around them 
will present further opportunities for energy harvesting.
