WHAT GIVES YOU HIGH-SPEED Internet access, runs the hottest games and 
apps, lets you take high-resolution photos and HD videos, gives you immediate 
access to your favorite social networks, handles any email you can throw at it, 
and keeps you in touch by phone, text, and video chat?
It’s the Samsung Galaxy S5—the smartphone with a big 5.1-inch screen that you 
can control with a wave of your hand.
The Galaxy S5 brings together superb hardware from Samsung with Google’s 
powerful, flexible Android operating system. Many people consider the Galaxy 
S5 to be the best smartphone on the planet. If you’re holding this book in your 
hands, you’re probably among them—or soon will be.
This book will help you get the most out of your Galaxy S5, and there’s a lot you 
can get out of it. Whether you’re just looking to get started or want to dig deep 
into the phone’s capabilities, this book has got you covered.
About the Samsung Galaxy S5
WHAT MAKES THE GALAXY S5 so great starts with its hardware. Samsung 
gave it a 5.1-inch, high-resolution screen; a 16-megapixel camera for high-res 
photos and video; and a front-facing 2-megapixel camera for video calling and 
video chat. Its brain is a superfast 2.5 GHz four-core processor. For keeping you 
connected, the Galaxy S5 has antennas for Bluetooth, WiFi, and GPS.
 NOTE 	 This book was written based on the T-Mobile version of the Samsung Galaxy S5. 
Versions from other carriers may have minor variations in what you see onscreen.

Introduction
It has access to speedy 3G and 4G networks, which let you talk, text, and surf 
the Web almost anywhere in the U.S. (anywhere important, anyway).
Google contributed its Android operating system, with seamless access to 
YouTube, Google Talk, and other Google services. The worldwide developer 
community has created hundreds of thousands of apps in the Google Play store 
(with more coming every day).
Put it all together, and you can do just about anything. You can get turn-by-turn 
directions, check weather and traffic, and identify landmarks. You can work with 
word processing and spreadsheet files and manage your email and calendar. 
You can take pictures and share them on Facebook, or shoot videos and upload 
them to YouTube. You can even turn the Galaxy S5 into a WiFi hotspot for get­
ting up to five computers online.
Oh, and it’s also a darn good phone with great sound quality and all the calling 
features you could ask for.
You could figure out how to make the most of all these features on your own, 
but by that time there’d be a whole other generation of smartphones to learn. 
This book will put you on the fast track to all the Galaxy S5’s magic.
What’s New in the S5
ITS PREDECESSOR THE SAMSUNG Galaxy S4 was a very popular and power­
ful smartphone. But the Samsung Galaxy S5 is nothing short of remarkable. It 
introduces countless new features, all of which are useful, and some of which 
seem more akin to magic than anything else. Here are some of the highlights:
• Fingerprint scanner. Want to make sure only you can use your Samsung 
Galaxy S5? It’s now got a fingerprint scanner so you can unlock your phone 
by having it check your fingerprints.
• Heart rate sensor. Put your finger over this sensor and it’ll check your heart 
rate.
• Faster downloads. The S5’s new Download Booster lets you create a big 
pipe out of your data and 4G or 3G networks for faster downloads.
• Water resistant. Worried about dropping your S5 into a puddle of water or 
having it rained on? Worry no more. It’s now water resistant. No, it won’t 
keep water out if you’re way underwater scuba diving, but in normal every­
day use it’s got you covered.
• New TouchWiz. The software that Samsung layers over Android has 
changed. It’s now simpler and less cluttered.

The Samsung Galaxy S5 Family
As this book was being written, there 
was only one version of the Galaxy S5 
available. But by the time you read this, 
there may be more members of the 
family. Rumors are that Samsung will 
release a phone called the Galaxy S5 
Prime with a faster processor, more RAM, 
and a higher-resolution screen than the 
original. Also said to be in the works 
is a Samsung Galaxy S5 Google Play 
Edition, which would have the same or 
similar hardware as the original S5, but 
somewhat different software. The Google 
Play Edition would have a pure version 
of Google’s Android operating system on 
it—the KitKat version (Android version 
4.4, for those of you who are keeping 
track). The original S5 also has KitKat 
under the hood, but layered on top of it 
is Samsung’s TouchWiz interface, which 
contributes many additional features. 
And there may also be a Mini version 
with a smaller screen and less powerful 
processor than the original.
The software on the Galaxy S5 Mini 
and Prime would likely be the same as 
the software on the original version. 
This book will help you learn about all 
the TouchWiz Galaxy S5 models, but it 
doesn’t cover the pure-KitKat Google 
Play Edition.
UP TO SPEED
About This Book
THERE’S AN ENTIRE WORLD to explore in the Samsung Galaxy S5, and the 
little leaflet that comes in the box doesn’t begin to give you all the help, advice, 
and guidance you need. So this book is the manual that should have accompa­
nied the Galaxy S5.
The brain running the Galaxy S5 is a piece of software from Google called 
Android. Samsung then tweaked Android to operate seamlessly with Samsung’s 
TouchWiz interface. Both Google and Samsung regularly issue updates that 
improve the way the Galaxy S5 works. So there’s a chance that since this book 
was written, there have been some changes to the Galaxy S5. To help keep 
yourself up to date about them, head to this book’s Errata/Changes page at

About the Outline
GALAXY S5: THE MISSING Manual is divided into six parts, each of which has 
several chapters:
www.it-ebooks.info

	
xviii	
Introduction
• Part I. Covers everything you need to know about using the Galaxy S5 as 
a phone, as well as how to type on it, send text messages, and use all the 
phone features. So you’ll get a guided tour of the S5, learn how to dial calls, 
manage your contacts, use caller ID and similar features, make conference 
calls, and more, including fancy phone tricks like Visual Voicemail. You’ll 
even learn how to control your phone without using your hands.
• Part II. Gives you the rundown on using the Galaxy S5 for taking pictures, 
recording videos, viewing pictures, playing videos, and playing and manag­
ing your music. You’ll also learn all the new Google Maps features, how to 
navigate using GPS, and how to find any location in the world. There’s also 
the Calendar app, which you can synchronize with your Google or Outlook 
calendar.
• Part III. Tells you everything you need to know about the Galaxy S5’s 
remarkable online talents. You’ll find out how to get online either over your 
service provider’s network or a WiFi hotspot, see how you can turn your 
Galaxy S5 into a portable WiFi hotspot, master email, browse the Web, and 
download and use countless apps from the Google Play store.
• Part IV. Covers a wide variety of advanced subjects, including how to sync 
and transfer files between the Galaxy S5 and your PC or Mac, how to use the 
Galaxy S5 at your workplace, and how to control the Galaxy S5 by talking to 
it. You’ll also find a comprehensive listing of the Galaxy S5’s settings.
• Part V. Has three reference chapters. Appendix A shows you how to activate 
your Galaxy S5. Appendix B shows what kind of accessories you can get for 
your Galaxy S5, such as cases, chargers, and screen protectors. Appendix C 
offers plenty of help troubleshooting issues with the phone’s operation.
About→These→Arrows
IN THIS BOOK AND in the entire Missing Manual series, you’ll find instructions 
like this one: Tap Settings→Call Settings→“Voicemail settings.” That’s a short­
hand way of giving longer instructions like this: “Tap the Settings button. From 
the screen that opens, tap Call Settings. And from the screen that opens after 
that, tap ‘Voicemail settings.’”
It’s also used to simplify instructions you’ll need to follow on your PC or Mac, like 
File→Print.

THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S5—a svelte, elegant phone—is an enticing gadget, and 
the first time you hold it in your hands, you’ll immediately want to put it through 
its paces: calling friends, browsing the Web, checking your email, and more. As 
you’ll see in the rest of this book, it can do some remarkable things that make 
you feel as if the phone has superpowers.
To help you unlock all those powers, though, you need a solid understanding of 
how the Galaxy S5 works and familiarity with all its different parts. You’ll want 
to know where all its buttons, keys, and ports are located, for example—not 
to mention how to get to your Home screen and panes, and use some of the 
device’s amazing new features, like its ability to let you navigate by merely mov­
ing your eyes.
Power/Lock Button
THREE-QUARTERS OF THE WAY up on the right side of the Galaxy S5, you’ll 
find a small, rectangular silver button. It may be only a single button, but it’s 
a hardworking one, and it performs multiple functions. Press it with your S5 
turned off, and the phone springs to life. Press and release it when your S5 is 
turned on and active, and it puts the phone into Standby mode. If your S5 is 
turned on, press and hold it to show a screen that lets you do the following:
CHAPTER

The Guided Tour
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 1
• Power off. Turns off the S5’s power.
• Airplane mode. In Airplane mode, all wireless communications are switched 
off, but you can still use the phone’s apps and other features. Tap this option 
to enter Airplane mode. If you’re already in Airplane mode, tap again to get 
out. As the name suggests, Airplane mode is what the cabin crew wants you 
to turn on while in the air.
• Restart. Turns off your S5 and restarts it.
• Mute. Turns off all sounds.
• Emergency mode. Tap this to use an emergency feature designed to have 
the S5 automatically alert people—by text message—if you need emergency 
assistance. It also sends your location information. You need to enable 
Emergency mode before you can use it.
• Vibrate. Turns off vibration. If vibration is turned off, you can turn it back on 
here.
• Sound. If your phone is muted, tap here to turn the sound back on.
 TIP 	 The Power/Lock button also performs a useful trick that people near you will 
appreciate—it shuts off your ringer when you receive a call. Press it once when you get 
a call, and your ringer turns off. You’ll be able to see who’s calling, without the ring, 
and decide whether to answer the call or ignore it. If you ignore the call, it gets sent to 
voicemail.

Locking the Screen
When you put the Galaxy S5 on Standby using the Power/Lock button, the 
screen stops responding to touch. It blacks out, indicating that the screen is 
locked. Always lock the screen before putting the Galaxy S5 in your pocket or 
bag to avoid accidental screen taps and potentially embarrassing unintended 
phone calls. In fact, every time you leave the phone untouched for a certain 
amount of time—as little as 15 seconds to as much as 10 minutes (page 374)—
the screen automatically locks itself.
While the screen is locked, the Galaxy S5 still operates behind the scenes, 
checking email and Facebook on schedule. You can still get phone calls and text 
messages, and even listen to music while the screen is locked.
When you again want to use the Galaxy S5, you’ll need to unlock it. Press the 
Power/Lock button or the Home key. Then put your fingertip on the screen and 
slide it to the right or left. Your Galaxy S5 is now ready to do your bidding. You’ll 
get notifications about missed calls, text messages, and so on. If you’ve set up a 
PIN on your phone so that only someone with a password can use it, you’ll have 
to type in the PIN before you can use your phone. (See page 376 for details on 
how to set up a PIN.)
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 1
 TIP 	 You can adjust the amount of time it takes for the Galaxy S5 to lock itself. You can 
also turn off Locked mode entirely. And for added security, you can also require that a 
password be used to unlock your S5, or even your own fingerprint. For details, see page 
376.
Headset Jack
AT THE TOP OF the Galaxy S5, you’ll find a 3.5-millimeter headset jack. Notice 
that it’s a headset jack, not just a garden-variety headphone jack. It doesn’t just 
let you listen; it accepts incoming sound as well. That’s so you can plug a head­
set (like an earbud headset) into it and use it for making phone calls.
Of course, it’s also a headphone jack, so you can plug in headphones or even 
external speakers and enjoy the phone as a music machine, since it also offers 
full stereo.
About the Screen
THE SCREEN IS WHERE you and the Galaxy S5 do most of your communicat­
ing with each other. Compare the Galaxy S5’s screen to that of almost any other 
phone, and you’ll immediately notice how roomy it is—5.1 inches, measured 
diagonally (technically, that’s 1920 × 1080 pixels). It’s got extremely high resolu­
tion (432 pixels per inch, for the techie crowd). When you turn it sideways, it 
switches to a widescreen TV and movie format.
But there’s a lot going on behind that pretty display.
 TIP 	 Because you’re going to be touching the display with your fingers, it’s going to get 
dirty and streaky. Simply wipe it clean with a soft, lint-free cloth or tissue. The screen is 
scratch-resistant, but if you’re worried about scratches, get a case or screen protector. See 
Appendix B for ideas.
Built-in Sensors
Underneath its flat black screen, the Galaxy S5 has a whole bunch of sensors 
that perform a lot of its magic:
www.it-ebooks.info

	
The Guided Tour	
9
• Proximity sensor. Have you ever noticed that when you’re talking on your 
S5, the screen often goes blank? That’s thanks to the proximity sensor. It 
senses when your face is close to it during a phone call and automatically 
turns off and blanks the touch screen as you keep talking. It does this to 
save power, and so you don’t accidentally touch the screen while talking and 
perform some unwanted task.
• Ambient light sensor. Senses the light level and adjusts your screen’s bright­
ness as a way to save battery power. So in bright light, it makes the screen 
brighter and easier to see; in dim light, it makes the screen dimmer, since 
bright light is not needed.
• Accelerometer. As its name implies, this sensor measures acceleration and 
motion. The Galaxy S5 uses the accelerometer to sense the orientation of 
the screen and turn it to either landscape or portrait mode. But clever app 
makers use it for other things as well, such as automatic collision notification, 
which detects when you’re in an accident and then automatically makes a 
call for assistance for you. There’s even an app that works with the phone’s 
magnetometer to detect potholes as you drive and create a log about their 
locations, which you can then email to your local department of public 
works. (It’s called Pothole Agent. Search for it on Google Play, as described 
on page 289.)
• Magnetometer. Measures the strength and direction of the earth’s magnetic 
field. It’s used for compass apps and can also work with the accelerometer.
• Gyroscope. This motion detector is used for a host of features. For example, 
the S5 uses the gyroscope in concert with the accelerometer to interpret 
motion gestures you make and let you operate the phone by waving your 
hands.
• Barometer. Measures the current atmospheric pressure and altitude. The 
most obvious use is for weather-related apps. But it’s got a lot of other uses 
as well. For example, when you use an app that measures the number of 
calories you burn, that app takes the barometric pressure and altitude into 
account, because you burn a different number of calories based on those 
readings. 
• Gesture. This sensor uses infrared light to sense your gestures so that you 
can control the S5 without touching it. Yes, you read that right. You can 
control it by waving and other gestures thanks to this sensor. And as you’ll 
see later in this chapter, you can even control scrolling by moving your eyes. 
(You’ll learn all about these tricks later in this chapter on page 36.)
• Fingerprint. Yes, the S5 has a fingerprint sensor. Why? So you can unlock 
your screen using your fingerprints. (To see how, turn to page 376.)
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 1
• Heart Rate. On the back of the S5 near the top of the screen, just below the 
camera lens, you’ll find a heart rate sensor. To use it, turn to page 305.
• Hall. This sensor recognizes when the phone’s cover is closed or open.
Status Bar Icons
THE GALAXY S5 MAKES sure to keep you updated with information about its 
current status and any news, updates, and information it thinks is important. It 
does so by displaying a variety of icons in the status bar at the top of the screen. 
The status bar is divided into two parts. On the right side, you’ll find icons that 
inform you about the current state of the Galaxy S5, such as signal strength, 3G 
or 4G connection status, the time of day, and so on. At left is the Notification 
area, which alerts you when you have email or voice messages waiting, when an 
event on your calendar is about to occur, and more.
 NOTE 	 Many applications have their own icons that notify you about news, informa­
tion, and updates. These always appear on the left side of the status bar. You’ll see alert 
icons from Gmail, Facebook, and others.
Here are the most common icons you’ll come across:
• Cell signal. 
 The more bars you see, the stronger the signal. The stronger 
the signal, the clearer the call and the lower the likelihood that you’ll lose a 
connection. If you have no connection at all, then instead of this signal, you’ll 
see the much-hated warning: (No service).
 NOTE 	 When you see a notification on the left side of the status bar, drag down the 
Notification panel to see more details. You can also act upon the notification by tapping 
its icon after you drag it down—like checking your email or running an app that you’ve 
just downloaded. There’s also a Clear button that makes all notifications go away.
• Roaming. 
 If you’re outside your carrier’s service area and connected via 
another network, you’ll see the Roaming icon. Keep in mind that typically 
you’re charged for making calls or using data when you’re roaming, so when 
you see this icon, be careful what you do on your Galaxy S5—maybe it’s not 
the time to download 30 songs and a half-hour TV show.
• 3G/4G. 
 This one appears when you’re connected via 3G or 4G high-speed 
broadband service, which should be most of the time. It means that down­
load and upload speeds are fast.

• Bluetooth connection. 
 This icon indicates that you’ve turned on 
Bluetooth, for making a connection to a headset or some other device.
• Mobile hotspot. 
 Your Galaxy S5 can serve as a mobile hotspot, provid­
ing Internet service to up to five computers, smartphones, or other devices 
via WiFi. See page 193 for details. When you turn the phone into a mobile 
hotspot, this icon appears.
• Airplane mode. 
 When you use Airplane mode, you turn off WiFi and 
cellular communications. You can still keep using your phone’s apps, but it 
doesn’t interfere with navigation equipment.
• Downloading. 
 When you’re downloading an app or media file, you’ll see 
this icon.
• New email message. 
 You’ve got mail! See page 248 for more about read­
ing new email.
• GPS. 
 Your GPS radio is turned on.
• Upcoming event. 
 Now you’ll never forget your anniversary—or your den­
tist appointment. The Galaxy S5 alerts you via this icon when you’ve got an 
event about to happen.
• Voicemail message. 
 You’ve got mail—voicemail, that is. (See page 88 to 
learn how to check your voicemail.)
• Missed call. 
 Someone called you, and you didn’t answer. You see this icon 
appear even if the person left no voicemail.
• Vibrate.  This symbol indicates that you’ve set your Galaxy S5 to vibrate 
when you get a call.
• TTY symbol. 
 You’ve turned on Teletypewriter mode, a special mode that 
lets the Galaxy S5 communicate with a teletypewriter. That’s a machine that 
deaf people use to conduct phone calls by reading and typing text.
• Alarm. 
 Who needs an alarm clock when you’ve got your Galaxy S5? This 
icon indicates that the alarm is on. You can even set multiple alarms.
• Time. 
 Shows you what time it is. Say goodbye to your watch.

• Battery.  Get to know this icon—it shows you how much battery life you’ve 
got left. When the battery is charging, you see a battery-filling animation 
and a tiny lightning bolt.
• Connected to VPN. 
 If you use your Galaxy S5 to connect to your com­
pany network via virtual private networking (VPN), this icon shows when 
your connection is active. You can check your work email and do anything 
else your company lets VPNers do. (If you’re interested in getting VPN 
access, you’ll need your IT department’s help, as described in Chapter 14.)
• Disconnected from VPN. You were on the VPN, and now you’re off.
• USB connection.  You’ll connect your phone to your computer via a USB 
cable for a variety of reasons, including copying and syncing files (Chapter 
13). Here’s the icon you’ll see when you make the connection.
• SD card is full. 
 This icon appears when your SD card (page 19) has run out 
of space. It’s time to get a bigger or newer one, or start deleting files.
• Smart scroll. 
 This icon appears when you’re using the S5’s amazing 
Smart scroll feature, which lets you scroll through pages by moving your 
eyes. To turn it on, tap the Settings app on the Apps screen and select 
Accessibility→“Dexterity and interaction” and turn the Smart scroll setting 
to on.
The Three Keys
MOST OF THE TIME you use your Galaxy S5, you’ll be tapping virtual buttons 
on the keyboard. But down at the bottom of the Galaxy S5, there are three keys: 
one fat, white physical one in the middle, and two virtual ones (touch keys) that 
light up only when you touch them. From left to right, here’s what they do.
www.it-ebooks.info

 TIP 	 Don’t like the elusive behavior of the touch keys? You can make them visible all 
the time by changing the setting. See page 375.
Recent Apps
Tap this button and you’ll see a list of the apps that you’ve most recently run, 
including currently running ones. Scroll up and down through them, and then 
tap the one you want to jump to.
Look toward the bottom of the screen at the two icons—the pie icon on the left, 
and the icon with an X on it (End All) on the right. Tap the pie icon and you’ll see 
a list of all the currently active apps. Up at the top of the screen, you’ll see how 
much total RAM you have on your S5 and how much you’re currently using. That 
way you can see whether you’re running out of memory, and if you are, shut 
down an app or two. To shut down an app, tap the End button to its right. To kill 
them all, tap “End all.”
 TIP 	 What if you want a faster way to kill all of your currently running apps? On the 
Recent Apps screen, tap the icon with the X on it down toward the bottom. Boom—they’re 
gone!

Home Key
Repeat after me, Dorothy: There’s no place like home, there’s no place like 
home... Wherever you are on the Galaxy S5, press the Home key and you’ll come 
back to the familiar Home screen. You won’t even need to tap your ruby slip­
pers together. But there’s more the Home key can do as well. Hold it down, and 
you’ll launch an app called Google Now, which is a kind of personal assistant 
that gives you all kinds of advice, such as what route to take home from work to 
avoid traffic. See page 352 for details.
Back Key
Wherever you are, tap this key, and you go to where you just were. The Back 
key works in apps as well as in menus. So when you’re browsing the Web, for 
example, it acts as your Back button. Pressing the Back key also makes a dis­
played keyboard or menu disappear.

Hey, Wait! Where’s the Menu Key?
On previous Galaxy S series phones, 
there used to be a menu key where the 
Recent Apps button is now. Tapping it 
opened up a context-sensitive menu 
that gave you a number of options 
for whatever app you were using. No 
more; it’s gone to smartphone heaven. 
However, that doesn’t mean there’s no 
way to get to the menus when you’re in 
an app. Almost every app you run has a 
Menu button. Just tap it to get to a menu 
of popular commands. It’s always on the 
upper right of the screen, and it looks 
like three small squares on top of one 
another. On page 237, you can see it in 
action in the Email app. Also, a long press 
on the Recent key will also bring up the 
menu in some apps.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Multipurpose Jack and Charger
FOR TRANSFERRING FILES AND syncing music and movies between your 
computer and the Galaxy S5, there’s a multipurpose jack at the bottom of the 
phone. It normally has a small silver cover, so to get to the jack, flick it open. 
The multipurpose jack is composed of two small ports—a micro-USB port on 
the right and a smaller one to its left. The S5 comes with a special cable that 
connects to both ports on one end and plugs into a USB port on the other end. 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
16	
chapter	 1
You can use that special cable with your S5, or just use a normal USB cable with 
a micro-USB connection.
If you’re simply looking to connect your S5 to a PC or Mac to transfer files, you 
can get by with just a normal USB cable with one end for a micro-USB port. Just 
plug the cable into your S5 and the other end to a USB port on a PC or Mac, as 
described on page 319. However, you don’t have to buy a USB cable if you don’t 
have one—you can do the same thing with the S5’s own special cable.
So what’s the point of having a multipurpose port rather than a normal USB one? 
With the multipurpose port and cable, you can charge your phone more quickly. 
Plug the multipurpose cable into the port, and then plug the other end into the 
USB charger that comes with the S5, and your phone gets charged even faster.
If you use power-hungry features like video and GPS, you may have to charge 
the S5 every night. If you stick to mostly phone calls and text messages, you 
may be able to get by with charging only two or three times a week.
 TIP 	 You can use the Galaxy S5 while it’s charging, unless the battery has run down 
completely. In that case, it’ll need to build up a charge before you can turn it on.
This port does one more thing as well. The S5 may be small enough to fit in 
the palm of your hand, but it’s still a big-time entertainment machine. That’s 
because it’s HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) capable. With it, you 
can view videos and photos taken on your Galaxy S5 right on your computer or 
TV screen—as long as they also have HDMI ports. Plug one end of the cable into 
your Galaxy S5, the other into your PC or TV, and you’re ready to go. What does 
that have to do with the USB port? Plenty: You can buy a special attachment to 
connect your phone to an HDMI device. See page 136 for details.
www.it-ebooks.info

 TIP 	 When you connect your Galaxy S5 to a PC for the first time, your PC may not 
recognize it. That’s because your PC may need special drivers (small pieces of software) 
to communicate with the Galaxy S5. Windows will try its mightiest to find the drivers, 
but there’s a chance it won’t be able to locate them. If it doesn’t, you can go over to the 
Samsung help website (www.samsung.com/us/support/) and search for Samsung Galaxy 
S5 drivers. Then download the drivers and follow the instructions for installing them.
Ringer Volume
IS YOUR RINGER TOO loud? Too soft? Get it just right by using this long silver 
key on the S5’s upper left. Press the top part to make the volume louder and the 
bottom one to make it softer. When you press, a ringer volume app pops up on 
your screen, showing you how much louder or softer you’re making the ring.
Microphone
THAT TINY LITTLE HOLE at the bottom of the Galaxy S5 is the microphone. 
Yes, it’s small, but it does the job very nicely.
Battery
THE GALAXY S5 HAS a battery cover. Yes, that’s right, an actual battery 
cover—you can remove the battery and replace it with a new one, unlike some 
other cellphones. To remove the battery, flip the S5 over, put your finger under­
neath the small plastic slot on the upper left, and pull off the battery cover. 
You’ll see the battery, which you can easily remove by putting your finger into 
the slot at the bottom and gently pulling up. Don’t pull it hard or yank it.
 NOTE 	 Before removing the battery, make sure to turn the Galaxy S5’s power off via 
the Power/Lock key.
To replace the battery, simply put it back into place and then replace the battery 
cover. Now turn the phone back on.

SIM Card
DEPENDING ON YOUR CARRIER, you may need a SIM card to use your phone. 
If so, you’ll get the SIM card when you buy the phone. The carrier may put it in 
for you, or you may need to do it yourself. It’s located above the battery, and 
you’ll have to remove the battery to get to it. When you insert it, make sure the 
gold-colored contacts face down.
 WARNING 	 Don’t put a microSD memory card into the slot for the SIM card—it’s easy 
to confuse them. If you do that accidentally, don’t force it back out. Contact Samsung and 
ask how you can get it to a Samsung Service Center.

Maximizing Your Battery Charge
The Galaxy S5, despite its large screen 
and considerable capabilities, can go 
a reasonably long time on one battery 
charge. But if you use a lot of power-
sucking features, you may not even 
be able to get through one whole day 
without having to recharge. In addition 
to turning off the screen or putting it into 
Standby mode when you’re not using 
it, there’s a lot you can do to make your 
battery last:
• Be smart about email fetching. 
The more often the Galaxy S5 
checks email, the faster the battery 
runs down. Either check email 
manually only when you need to 
or increase the interval at which 
the phone checks. Launch the Email 
app, press the Menu key, and then 
select Settings and tap the name 
of your email account. Tap “Sync 
schedule”→”Set sync schedule.” You 
can choose from intervals between 
15 minutes and 12 hours, or manually.
• Use “Power saving mode.” Power 
saving mode turns your Galaxy S5 
into a power-sipper. To do it, from 
the Home screen, tap the Settings 
button, select Settings→”My device” 
and then turn on “Power saving 
mode.”
• Turn off antennas you’re not using. 
If you’re not using a Bluetooth 
headset and don’t need WiFi or GPS 
services at the moment, by all means 
turn them off. They use up tons of 
power. Pull down the Notification 
panel, and you’ll find widgets for 
turning off (and back on) WiFi, GPS, 
and Bluetooth. Putting the Galaxy 
S5 into Airplane mode turns off all 
these settings at once, as well as 
turning off the radio that connects 
you to the cellular network. Find the 
Airplane mode widget by sliding the 
widgets to the left.
• Watch out for power-sapping apps. 
Some, such as 3D games, can use 
serious amounts of juice. If, after 
installing an app, you notice your 
battery running low quickly, consider 
deleting it, or running it only when 
necessary.
UP TO SPEED
MicroSD Card
ATOP THE SIM CARD, you’ll find a small slot for the microSD card. It’s about the 
size of a fingernail—and much smaller than the normal SD memory cards used in 
cameras. Your Galaxy S5 may not have come with an SD card, so you may have 
to buy one. The S5 can use any SD cards that store up to 128 GB of data. Place 
the card in the slot with the arrow facing in. You’ll hear a click when it’s in place. 
After that, replace the battery cover.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
20	
chapter	 1
After you install the card and turn on the phone, you’ll see a notification that the 
S5 is preparing the microSD card for your use. When it’s done, go to the Home 
screen, tap the Apps icon at lower right, and then tap Settings→Storage. You’ll 
find a new group of settings under “SD card,” listing information like how much 
total space is on the SD card and how much space remains. (If that informa­
tion doesn’t appear, it means that your SD card hasn’t been formatted properly. 
There’s a simple solution: tap “Mount SD card.” If your phone doesn’t recognize 
it after that, then tap “Format SD card.” That should do the trick.)
 WARNING 	 If you’ve got a microSD card in your phone and you’ve stored files on it, 
make sure not to tap “Format SD card.” When you do that, you erase all the data stored on it.
If you want to replace the SD card—for example, if you have a 16 GB card and 
want to replace it with one that has more capacity—it’s easy. Return to the 
Storage settings and tap “Unmount SD card” in the SD card section.
When you’ve done that, turn off the phone’s power and remove the battery 
cover. You can then slide out the microSD card. Then insert a new microSD card 
and follow the instructions in this section for telling your Galaxy S5 to recognize it.
Camera
YOUR SAMSUNG GALAXY S5 includes not one but two cameras, both capable 
of taking videos as well as photos. The camera on the back, which is the one 
you’ll normally use for taking photos and videos, has a whopping 16-mega­
pixel resolution. The camera that faces you is for video calling and video chat, 
although you’ll probably take your share of selfies as well. It’s got a 2-megapixel 
resolution. Don’t look for a physical camera button for taking photos; instead, 
you tap an onscreen button (page 129).
Water-Resistant Case
THE S5’S EXTERIOR LOOKS like just any other smartphone’s, although maybe 
a little snazzier. But its beauty is more than just skin deep. Its case is water-resis­
tant and dust-resistant. That means it’s less likely to go on the fritz if you splash 
it when you’re washing your hands, or even if you drop it into a lake, pond, or 
some more unpleasant watery environment.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
The Guided Tour	
21
Keep in mind, though, that it’s not waterproof. So you can’t use it for taking pho­
tos when scuba diving, for example. To avoid water damage, keep the following 
in mind:
• Don’t put it in water more than a meter deep or submerge it in any water 
for more than 30 minutes.
• Make sure that the case is tightly closed after you open it to access the bat­
tery, SIM card, or microSD card. Also, make sure that the multipurpose jack’s 
cover is closed tightly as well.
• Don’t expose the S5 to soapy water, salt water, or ionized water.
• If you drop the S5, or if it receives an impact of some sort, make sure the 
cases and covers are still tightly sealed. 
Samsung and Google Accounts
TO ENJOY ALL THE services your Galaxy S5 is capable of delivering, you need 
to have a Google account, and possibly a Samsung account as well. On your 
smartphone, an account is a central location for managing all the services you 
can get. The Google one is absolutely necessary, but you may want to set up a 
Samsung one as well. This section tells you what you need to know about each.
Google Account
In order to use your S5, you need a Google account. That’s because the S5’s 
underlying software is made by Google and uses many Google services, such 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
22	
chapter	 1
as Maps, Gmail, and more. If you already have a Google account—if you’ve ever 
used Gmail, for example—great! You can use that account and all the informa­
tion and settings you’ve stored in it. Or you can create a new Google account 
when you sign into your S5 for the first time and start fresh.
When you first start your phone, it prompts you to walk through logging into 
your account or setting up a new one. After that, if you want to make changes, 
you can head to one central location. At the Home screen, tap the Apps icon, 
and then choose Settings→Accounts→Google.
Samsung Account
If you’d like to use additional Samsung services, you can also set up a Samsung 
account. Otherwise, you don’t need it. Depending on your carrier, you may be 
prompted to create a Samsung account or to log into an existing one when 
you first set up your phone, right after you log into or create a Google account. 
But if not, you can create one afterward. At the Home screen, tap the Apps 
icon, choose Settings→Accounts→Add Account, and follow the prompts. 
To change settings, at the Home screen, tap the Apps icon and then choose 
Settings→Accounts→Samsung Account.
Home Screen
WELCOME TO YOUR NEW home, the Galaxy S5 Home screen. Get to it by 
pressing the Home key no matter where you are.
 NOTE 	 What you see on the Home screen and panes may differ somewhat from what 
you see here. Cellphone carriers often customize them, put their own apps on them, and 
sometimes even change them over time.
The screen is chock-full of useful stuff, populated by the following:
• Status bar. As detailed on page 10, this bar displays the status of many 
phone features and a variety of notifications in the notification area, like 
when you’ve got email waiting for you.
• Notification area. The Notification area takes up the left side of the Status bar, 
and it’s where you’ll get most of your messages from your phone and apps.
• App icons. The Home screen has a number of icons on it, for checking email 
(right on the icon, you see how many new messages you’ve got), for using 
the camera, and one, called Play Store, to let you search for and download 
www.it-ebooks.info

23
new apps—tens of thousands of them, many of them free. As you’ll see later 
in this section, you can add or delete icons from the Home screen.
• Dock. Just below the app icons is a row of five icons. They sit in an area 
called the Dock, and they’re different from the app icons. Like the app icons, 
you can move or delete them—except for the Apps icon. As you’ll see in a 
little bit, there are other screens you can move to, called panes or panels, but 
the icons in the Dock stay in place no matter which pane you visit. (The app 
icons change according to what pane you’re on.) The Phone icon launches 
the Phone app; the Contacts icon shows you your contacts; the Messages 
icon lets you send and receive text messages (it shows how many messages 
you’ve got waiting); the Internet icon launches your web browser; and the 
Apps icon reveals a whole new screen called the Apps screen, filled with 
apps, apps, and more apps.
• Pane indicator. Just above the Dock you’ll see six small icons, the most 
noticeable of which is an icon of a house—the Home screen. To its left is an 
icon of two horizontal lines. That launches My Magazine, a nifty Samsung 
app for reading articles from the Web (page 350). To the right of the Home 
icon are four rectangles, each of which represents a different panel. The 
brightest rectangle indicates which pane you’re currently viewing. To jump 
to any pane, tap its button (or slide your finger across the screen).
Above the icons you’ll find widgets—a text input box for searching Google, a 
weather widget that shows you the current weather, and, above that, the date 
and the time.

Notification and Quick Settings Panel
Drag down the Status bar, and you’ll display the Notification and Quick Settings 
panel. It displays all of your notification messages and also gives you access to 
changing the S5’s most common settings, such as for WiFi, Bluetooth, sound, 
and so on. The quick settings are at the top of the screen; just tap the icon of the 
one you want to use. There are more than you see there—swipe to access them. 
If you prefer, tap the icon all the way on the right, and you’ll see a neat grid of 
many settings. To get access to all of your settings, tap the gear icon at the top of 
the screen. For details on all of the Galaxy S5’s settings, see Chapter 16.
    
Tap any notification and you’ll see more details about it, such as information 
about missed calls, Facebook notifications, and files you’ve downloaded.
Apps Screen
Tap the Apps icon, and up pops the Apps screen, which includes all the Galaxy 
S5’s preinstalled applications, plus any apps that you’ve installed. There’s more 
than can fit on one screen, so swipe your finger to the right to get to another 
screenful. You can also tap one of the square icons at the bottom of the screen 
to move from screen to screen. Tap any icon to run the app.

 TIP 	 If you get bored swiping through the Apps screens to find the one you want, you 
can make it easier for yourself. Press the Menu icon and select “View as,” and you can 
rearrange the app icons in alphabetical order, or create a custom arrangement. (Select 
Custom and press the menu key again to see your options.)
The Panes
What you see on the four panes to the right of the Home screen varies accord­
ing to your carrier—and what Samsung put there before you bought the phone. 
You may well see things onscreen that aren’t covered in this section.
In general, though, you’ll find apps and widgets that perform plenty of common 
and not-so-common things, like checking your calendar and weather, seeing 
what your friends are up to on Facebook and other social networking sites, play­
ing music and videos, and more.
To get to another pane, slide your finger to the left or right on the Home screen, 
and you move from the Home screen to one of the panes. What’s on the pane 
changes—you’ll generally see a mix of app icons and widgets. If you don’t like 
what you see on any pane, don’t worry; as you’ll see on page 27, you can fiddle 
with it to your heart’s content. (The Dock, however, remains the same no matter 
where you go.) The pane indicator has changed—a different button now shines 
brighter, to show you which pane you’re on.

The Software Behind the Galaxy S5
I hear a lot of names for the Galaxy S5’s 
software—TouchWiz, KitKat, Android. 
Well, which is it?
The short answer: All of the above.
Here’s the long answer:
The Galaxy S5 is powered by an operat-
ing system from Google called Android, 
as are many other phones. The Android 
operating system is constantly get-
ting updated, and those updates are 
automatically sent to your phone when 
they’re available. So what you see on 
your S5 may vary slightly from what 
you see onscreen here, depending on 
the version of Android you have on 
your phone. At this writing, the Galaxy 
S5 comes with Android version 4.4.2, 
nicknamed KitKat.
Also, it’s common for the manufacturer 
to tweak the phone’s interface, some-
times in significant ways. Samsung adds 
its own TouchWiz interface, which makes 
many changes to Android. So when you 
compare the Galaxy S5 to other Android 
phones, you’ll notice differences.
There’s still another reason why your 
Galaxy S5 may differ from what you see 
in this book. This book happens to be 
written based on the Samsung Galaxy S5 
sold for T-Mobile phones, so it may differ 
slightly from what you see on phones 
from other carriers.

Easy Mode and Standard Mode
WHEN IT COMES TO the basic layout of your Home screen, you’ve got two 
choices: Standard mode and Easy mode. In Standard mode, you see the normal 
Home screen layout described so far in this chapter, with all its widgets and 
apps. But maybe you don’t want to see all those widgets and apps. Maybe you 
want something simpler, with big, easy-to-see icons and a big font. In that case, 
you want Easy mode. On the Home screen, tap the Apps icon, and then select 
Settings→“Easy mode.” On the screen that appears, choose “Easy mode” to 
switch to it. If you want, you can also select which apps you want to appear on 
your Home screen and panes. Out of the box, you see them all. To switch back 
to the normal Home screen, tap the Apps icon and select Settings→“Standard 
mode.”
Customizing the Home Screen and Panes
HERE’S ONE OF THE many nice things about the Galaxy S5—it’s easy to put 
your personal mark on it. Wish there were different apps on the Home screen? 
No problem; you can easily add them. Want to change the location of apps, or 
move around widgets and add new ones to each of your panes and the Home 
screen? It’s a breeze. The rest of this section shows you how.

Adding Widgets and Wallpaper
The Home screen and all its panes are much like a prepared canvas, waiting for 
your Picasso-like touches. Instead of paint, you can add widgets and wallpaper.
To do any of the above, the first step is the same: Press and hold your finger 
anywhere on the Home screen or a pane. Your current pane shrinks and gets 
outlined, and below it you’ll see three options: Wallpapers, Widgets, and “Home 
screen settings.” Here’s what to do with each.
 NOTE 	 The Home screen and panes have limited real estate—there’s only so much you 
can put on them. In fact, when the phone is factory fresh, the Home screen and panes 
may already be full. If you try to put something new on them, like an app or a widget, the 
S5 won’t let you do it. Nothing happens when you hold your finger on the screen or pane. 
In that case, you have two options: delete apps or widgets (page 33) or create a new pane 
(page 34).
Wallpapers
Here’s where the Picasso part comes in. You can add a wallpaper image to the 
background of your Home screen, just like adding wallpaper to your computer 
desktop. When you tap this option, you’re asked whether you want to set wall­
paper for your Home screen, Lock screen, or both.

Make your selection. When you do, you’ll see representations of wallpapers you 
can use at the bottom of the screen. Swipe until you find one you want, tap it, 
and then tap “Set wallpaper.” You’ve got new wallpaper.
But what if you find Samsung’s selections dull and uninspiring? No problem—tap 
the “More images” icon on the bottom left of the screen, and you can use your 
own fabulous photos and pictures. After you tap, you choose where you want

to grab a picture from—the Gallery on your S5, a cloud-based service such as 
Dropbox, or any others you’ve got on your S5. For example, say you want to 
take a photo from the Gallery, so you tap that choice. 
The Gallery launches. Navigate until you get to the photo you want to use (for 
more detail on using the Gallery, see page 115.
 NOTE 	 When you add wallpaper to your Home screen, it also shows up as the back­
ground on all your panes. And when you add it to a pane, it shows up on your Home 
screen.
If you select a picture from the Gallery, you can crop the photo to fit the screen. 
The S5 suggests a crop for you. You can change it by moving any of the squares 
that define the crop. Make your selection, tap Done, and you’ll see only the 
cropped area fill your screen.

Widgets
This option lets you add widgets to your Home screen or any pane. A widget 
is an applet that performs a small, specific task, often grabbing and displaying 
information from the Galaxy S5 or the Web. When you select this option, you 
see a list of widgets you can use. Swipe to see more widgets if there are more 
than can fit on one screen. 
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 1
The same holds true for widgets. Tap the Widgets tab, hold your finger on the 
widget you want to add, and drag and drop it where you want it to be. If the 
pane you’re adding it to is full of icons and widgets, you won’t be able to add 
more. The Home screen usually fills up first, so consider adding the widget to a 
different pane. 
   
Home screen settings
Tap this, and you won’t get much to choose from. You can select the transition 
effect your Home screen and panes use, and turn My Magazine (Chapter 15) on 
or off. If you uncheck the box next to My Magazine, its pane disappears. 
Adding Apps and Folders to the Home Screen
You can also add apps to the Home screen. To do it, tap the Apps icon to get 
to the Apps screen. Then drag the app’s icon to the pane where you want it to 
appear and drop it there.

 NOTE 	 When you add an app to your Home screen or a pane, you’re not actually mov­
ing that app to the screen or pane. Instead, you’re adding a shortcut to the app, and that’s 
a good thing. When you tap the shortcut, you run the app, just as if you had tapped it in 
the Apps screen. But there’s a difference: If you delete a shortcut on the Home screen or 
a pane, you don’t delete the app itself. It still lives on. But, if you delete the app from the 
Apps screen, it disappears from your S5.
Deleting and Moving
Once you’ve added widgets, folders, and shortcuts to your Home screen, you’re 
not stuck with them, or with where you’ve placed them:
• To move a widget or shortcut to an app, hold your finger on it for a second 
or two. The pane or Home screen gets outlined, and a small highlight box 
appears around the widget, folder, or shortcut. Drag it to its new loca­
tion and take your finger off. That’s where it’ll stay. You can even drag it to 
another pane—just move toward that edge of the screen. Some widgets can 
be resized as well. If so, small handles will appear on its outline. Move the 
handles until the widget is the size you want.
• To delete a widget or app shortcut, again hold your finger on it for a second 
or two until the highlight box appears. You’ll notice a Delete icon in the 
shape of a trash can at the top of the screen. Drag the doomed item to the 
trash can. When you see it turn red, release it—it’s gone.

Adding and Deleting Panes
Say you’ve got a pane tricked out with widgets, shortcuts, and folders. You 
decide that you’d like it all to go—every widget, every shortcut, every folder. 
Rather than deleting them one by one, you want to delete them in one fell 
swoop. Just delete the entire pane. So, for example, if you had the Home screen 
and six panes, you’d end up with the Home screen and just five panes. Fear 
not—you can always add a new pane back.
To delete a pane, when you’re on the Home screen or a pane, hold your finger 
on an empty area of it. Then drag the current pane to the trash can icon at the 
top of the screen. Voilà—it’s a pane no more.
To add a pane, hold your finger on an empty area of the Home screen or pane. 
Then swipe to the right past your final pane. There will be a big empty pane with 
a + sign on it. Tap the + sign. You’ve just created a new pane.
Controlling the Galaxy S5 
with Your Fingers
WITH THE GALAXY S5, your fingers do the walking. They do all the work that 
you do on a computer with a mouse or keyboard. Here are the eight finger 
strokes you can use on the phone’s screen.

Tap
Tapping is as basic to the S5 as clicking is to a mouse. This simple gesture is 
how you press onscreen buttons, place the cursor for text entry, and choose 
from menus. Note that’s a finger tap; the screen is designed to detect a fleshy 
fingertip, not a stylus.
Touch and Hold
Touch an object and hold it for several seconds, and depending on what you’re 
holding, an option menu may appear. For example, when you touch and hold 
the Home screen, a menu appears that lets you add an object such as a widget, 
change your wallpaper, and so on. You also touch and hold an object as a way to 
grab onto it if you want to drag the object somewhere.
Drag
After you’ve grabbed something, you can drag it with your finger—like dragging 
an icon to the Trash.
Slide
Slide your finger across the screen to perform some specific tasks, like unlock­
ing your phone after it’s been put into Standby mode, or answering a call if 
the phone is locked. You’ll also use the sliding motion to move through all five 
panes.

Flick
Think of the flick as a faster slide, done vertically when scrolling through a list, 
like your contacts list. The faster you make the flicking motion, the faster your 
screen scrolls—sometimes too fast. You can stop the motion, though, by touch­
ing the screen again.
 NOTE 	 Flicks seem to actually obey the laws of physics, or at least as much as virtual 
movement can. When you flick a list, it starts off scrolling very quickly, and then gradually 
slows down, as if it were a wheel set in motion that gradually loses momentum.
To scroll through large lists quickly, you can flick multiple times.
Pinch and Spread
In many apps, such as Google Maps, Mail, Browser, and the Gallery, you can 
zoom in by spreading your fingers—placing your thumb and forefinger on the 
screen and spreading them apart. The amount you spread your fingers will 
determine the amount you zoom in.
To zoom out, put your thumb and forefinger on the screen and pinch them 
together. The more you pinch, the more you zoom out.
Double-Tap
When you’re viewing a map, a picture, or a web page, you can zoom in by 
double-tapping. In some instances, once you’ve reached the limit of zooming in, 
double-tapping again restores the zoom to its original size.
The Magic of the S5’s Gestures
LOOK MA, NO HANDS! No longer is that only the cry of a child showing off 
riding a bicycle without touching the handlebars. You can do the same thing 
with your S5. Amazingly enough, you can control it by just moving your hands 
without touching the screen.
To get to many of the S5’s magic motion features, tap the Settings icon on the 
Apps screen, and then tap Motions and gestures. You’ll want to try several fea­
tures you find there.
Air Browse
Turn on Air Browse, and you can scroll through lists and other content such as 
the body of an email just by moving your hand over the screen in the direction

you want to scroll. Once you turn it on, you can customize which apps it works 
with, such as email, the Gallery, the Web, and Music.
Direct Call
With this magical setting turned on, you can call someone whose message or 
contact details are currently on the screen, simply by bringing the S5 close to 
your ear.
Mute/Pause
This one mutes or pauses music or a call when you cover the screen with your 
hand, or turn the device over. On the same screen, you can turn on “Smart 
pause,” which is a remarkable feature that detects when you’re watching video, 
and will pause it when you look away from the screen.
Air View
This feature, which originated on the Samsung Galaxy Note II, lets you hover 
your finger over the S5 to get information from it. For example, hovering over a 
web page magnifies it, hovering over a picture in the Gallery opens it, hovering 
over a Calendar event reveals more details about it, hovering over a truncated 
text message reveals the full message, and so on.
To turn on Air View, see the full list of what you can do, and customize it, tap the 
Settings icon on the Apps screen, and then tap “Air view.” Slide the “Air view” 
button to On or Off.

Using Multi Window
MULTI WINDOW IS AN S5 feature you could easily miss—but don’t. It lets you 
do more than one thing on the phone at the same time. For example, watch a 
video while you’re also checking your email. What could be handier?
To turn it on, on the Apps screen, tap Settings and select “Multi window.” Then, 
when you’re doing something, like browsing the Gallery or viewing a photo, 
press and hold the Back key, or else slide the arrow on the left side of the screen 
to the right. A menu appears down the right-hand side of the screen, with icons 
for a variety of apps: web browser, email, text messaging, and so on.
Drag the icon of the app you want to use (in addition to the one you’re currently 
using) to a portion of the screen and then drop it there. The second app opens, 
so you have two apps open on your screen simultaneously.

Drag the separator between the two windows to change the relative size of each

of the windows, make one of the windows full screen, or close down either of 
them.

A SMARTPHONE LIKE THE Galaxy S5 wouldn’t be very smart without the 
keyboard. Of course the S5 is great for voice calls, but for text messaging, email, 
and web surfing, you need an easy way to enter text, and the S5 comes through 
with flying colors. It gives you two onscreen keyboards—but three ways of 
entering words into your phone. You can tap to type the usual way, swipe your 
way through words without lifting your fingertip from the screen, or use the S5’s 
built-in microphone to speak what you want to type.
Whether you prefer to use your fingers or your voice, this chapter is about all 
the things the S5 lets you do with text. From basic typing, you move on to edit­
ing, text messaging, and chatting. Another important thing you need typing for 
is searching through all your stuff on the phone, so the chapter finishes off with 
that.
The keyboard automatically pops up when you tap somewhere you can enter 
text, like an email message, a text message, a web browser’s address bar, and so 
on. You’re not limited to tapping individual keys. Instead, you can tap a key and 
then drag your finger over each letter in the word, in order. This feature captures 
all the letters in the word using built-in intelligence to figure out what you’re 
entering. It’s much faster than tapping individual letters. It takes some getting 
used to, but you can master it in a few minutes. Once you get used to swip­
ing, you may never go back. If even swiping feels like a bit too much effort, the 
Galaxy S5 understands. It lets you speak to enter text just as if you were talking 
on the phone.

chapter	 2
 NOTE 	 If you’ve ever used another Android-based phone, you’re already somewhat 
familiar with the Samsung keyboard. It’s much like the one built directly into the Android 
operating system, and so is similar to the keyboards on all Android phones.
Using the Samsung Keyboard
TAP WHEREVER YOU CAN enter text, and the keyboard appears. When you 
first tap in the text-entry box, a blinking cursor appears, indicating that you can 
start typing text. When you tap a key, a speech balloon pops up just above your 
finger, showing you a larger version of the letter you’ve just tapped.
Surrounding the letters are five special keys:
• Shift. 
 Tap this key, and the letters all change to uppercase. After you type 
a key, though, the keyboard changes back to lowercase. To turn on Shift 
Lock so you can type multiple capital letters in a row, tap the Shift key twice. 
The blue arrow turns white, and the gray background turns blue. Press Shift 
again, and you’re back to the lowercase keyboard.
• Del. 
 This key deletes letters to the left of the insertion point, like the 
Delete key on a Mac keyboard. If you use a PC, where the Delete key is a 
forward delete key, you may find this behavior confusing at first. Just use the 
direction of the arrow icon on the key as a guide: Think backspace.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Typing, Texting, and Searching	
43
Tap the Del key once, and it deletes the letter to the left of the insertion 
point. Hold it down, and it keeps deleting letters to the left until you let it go.
• Sym. 
 This key reveals a keyboard full of symbols, punctuation marks, and 
numbers. When you tap it, the same key changes to read ABC, to indicate 
that if you tap it again, you’ll return to the letter keyboard.
• Return. 
 Tap to move down to the next line, just as on a computer.
• Microphone.  Don’t want your fingers to do all the work? No problem. Tap 
this key, wait for the words “Speak now” to appear, and then speak into the 
Galaxy S5. For more details, see page 357.
Auto-Suggestions and the Dictionary
As you enter text, the Galaxy S5 helpfully suggests words that might match 
what you plan to type. As you type, the phone changes its suggestions based on 
the letters you enter. The suggestions appear just above the keyboard. Tap any 
one of the choices to enter it.
 NOTE 	 Auto-suggestions often spring into action even before you start typing. When 
you begin a new email, for example, the S5 thoughtfully suggests two words it thinks 
you’re likely to start an email with: “The” and “You.”
www.it-ebooks.info

	
44	
chapter	 2
The S5 even makes suggestions if the text you’ve entered is obviously mis­
spelled—great if you’re ham-handed. So, for example, type meeyibv, and auto-
suggest offers a variety of options, including meeting.
 TIP 	 You can save yourself some time by not entering the apostrophe in contractions, 
such as don’t. The Galaxy S5 automatically adds the apostrophe in many common words 
after you type the letters and hit the space key.
But there are more suggestions than the ones you see. Tap the right-facing 
arrow at the right of the screen, and more suggestions appear. Also, the key­
board fades out so you can’t use it. All you can do is select one of the sug­
gestions. To go back to writing, tap the arrow—which has now turned into a 
left-facing arrow—and the normal keyboard appears again. Or simply tap in the 
text input box to get the normal keyboard back.
You may notice something more amazing still: The Samsung keyboard doesn’t 
just suggest words that you’re currently typing, but it even suggests words 
before you type them. That’s right; it’s as though the phone is a mind reader of 
sorts. So if you type I am going out of, before you can even start typing the next 
word, the keyboard helpfully shows you the word town. Tap it if you want to use 
that word. The keyboard even adds a space before it.
Moving the Insertion Point
Once you get the hang of entering text, you’ll come across another challenge—
how to move the insertion point if you want to go back and edit, delete, or add 
words or letters. You can tap where you want to place the insertion point, but 
that’s not always effective. Even if you have tiny fingers and fine-tuned hand-
eye coordination, you’ll rarely be able to tap in the precise spot where you want 
the insertion point.
There’s a better way: Tap anywhere in the text, and you’ll see a big arrow 
beneath the blinking cursor. Move that arrow to place the insertion point 
precisely.

Accented and Special Characters
You can easily type accented characters with the Galaxy S5 keyboard. (After 
all, don’t we all have a friend named René Müller-Strauß?). When you press and 
hold certain keys—the ones shown in the table—a palette of accented characters 
appears, with a box around the first accented character. Move your finger to the 
one you want to use, and it gets inserted.

The Express Lane to Punctuation Marks
The Galaxy S5 letter keyboard doesn’t have many punctuation marks on it, 
which can make for much annoyance as you have to constantly switch back and 
forth between the letter and number keyboards. There’s a simpler way, though: 
Press and hold the period key. The most common punctuation marks and other 
common symbols, such as the @ sign, appear on the pop-up palette—11 of them. 
Tap the mark you want to use. If you tap the Sym button on the palette that 
pops up, you’ll be sent straight to the symbols keyboard.
 TIP 	 If you want the keyboard—as well as all your menus, button labels, and so on—to 
use a language other than English, it’s easy. Pull down the Notification panel, tap the 
Settings icon, and then select “My device”→“Language and input”→Language, and then 
select the language you want to use. You’ve got plenty of choices, including German, 
Spanish, French, Italian, and more.

Swipe Your Way to Better Text Input
The Samsung keyboard has an even niftier piece of magic built into it, one that 
you likely won’t immediately notice: You can move your finger across the keys 
rather than tapping them, and input text that way. Rather than tap each letter 
individually, you put your finger on the first letter of the word, and then, with 
a single motion, move your finger from letter to letter of the word you want to 
input. As you do so, you’ll see the path you’ve traced. Don’t worry too much 
about accuracy, because the keyboard does an exceptional job of interpreting 
the word you want to input, using its dictionary. Just try to get near each letter; 
it’s OK if you’re off a little bit. When you’ve finished tracing the word, lift your 
finger.
There are times when the keyboard might not know precisely what you’re trying 
to trace, and the trace might match multiple words. If that happens, just choose 
from the word choices that pop up. Tap the word you want. That’s all it takes. 
Then keep swiping your fingers.
Tips for Swiping Text
Entering text this way can be much faster than tapping. Here’s how to get the 
most out of it:
• Don’t use the space key. After you enter a word, lift your finger and then 
enter another word. The keyboard automatically puts a space between the 
two words.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
48	
chapter	 2
• Circle or scribble for double letters. If you want to enter the word tennis, 
then when you get to the “n,” make a circle on the key with your finger, or 
scribble back and forth across the key. Then glide with your finger to the 
next letter.
• Work quickly. Don’t slow down in an attempt to be more precise. Swype 
is built for speed. Move your finger quickly; you’ll be surprised at how well 
Swype recognizes words.
The Magic of the Microphone Key
REMEMBER THE MICROPHONE KEY (page 43)? Tap it, and you can dictate 
text to your Samsung S5. But that’s just the beginning of what this key can do. 
Tap and hold it instead of just tapping it, and a menu bar appears just above.
There are a bunch of cool things you can now do by tapping the appropriate 
icon. Here’s what they do, from left to right:
• Microphone. Does what the icon says—lets you dictate text. Tap this key 
and start speaking. Say a few words. The Galaxy S5 thinks for a few seconds 
and then types what you dictated. If you decide you’d prefer to type, tap the 
little keyboard symbol.
Speak clearly and distinctly. The S5’s microphone works well for words and 
short phrases, but not so well for long sentences. You can, however, speak 
part of a sentence, let it input the text, and then speak the next part.

 TIP 	 Between the Microphone and Clipboard buttons, you may have a button that looks 
like a capital T with a pencil. Tap it, and you get a screen where you can write with your 
finger or a stylus. 
• Clipboard. This lets you paste in something that you’ve previously copied to 
the Clipboard. (For more on copying and pasting, flip to page 51.) When you 
tap it, a list of your last several clips appears. Tap any to insert it.

• Settings. Takes you to a screen that lets you change the S5’s keyboard 
settings.
• Emoticons and pictures. Are you a fan of smiley faces? Then tap this and 
you can embed them as colorful graphics. And it’s not just emoticons you 
can put into your messages. There are plenty of other small graphics as well, 
such as pictures of animals, houses, and more. Just tap the appropriate but­
ton at the bottom of the screen.
• Keyboard size. The next icon lets you select what size keyboard to use. Out 
of the box, you’re using the normal-sized keyboard. If you want to use the 
much smaller keyboard, tap the icon all the way to the right. A wee little 
keyboard appears, one you need mini-fingers to use. You can drag it around 
the screen by dragging the little tab at its top. When you’re tired of working 
so small, hold your finger on the microphone key and press the keyboard 
icon again.

Copying and Pasting Text
WHAT’S A COMPUTER WITHOUT the ability to cut, copy, and paste? A com­
puter at heart, the Galaxy S5 lets you do all that, even though it has no mouse. 
For example, you can copy directions from Google Maps into an email to send to 
a friend, paste contact information into a note to yourself, and so on.
You copy and paste text using the same basic techniques you use on a PC or a 
Mac. You select it, copy or cut, and then paste it.
To select text in an input box, double-tap the text you want to select. If you’re 
lucky, the exact words you want to select are highlighted in blue with brackets 
on either side. Just above the keyboard, you’ll see the words as well.
There’s a good chance, though, that you won’t be that lucky. No problem—just 
drag either or both brackets to select the exact text you want.

chapter	 2
When you select text, a menu bar appears at the top of the screen. There’s more 
than what you see at first; swipe the menu bar to see everything you can do. 
Here’s what you can do from this menu:
• Select all. Selects all the text and graphics in the input box and pops up the 
same menu of choices you have when you select a word. The selected text is 
highlighted and contained within the brackets. Move any of them to limit the 
selection.
• Cut. Deletes the text and copies it to the Clipboard so you can paste it 
somewhere.
• Copy. Copies the text to the Clipboard so you can paste it somewhere but 
doesn’t delete the text.
• Clipboard. Replaces the text you’ve selected with the latest text you’ve 
pasted to the Clipboard.
• Dictionary. Looks up the word in a dictionary. The first time you use this 
feature, you’ll be prompted to download the dictionary.
As for pasting text once you’ve copied it to the Clipboard, it’s a snap…well, a tap. 
Hold your finger where you want to paste the text, and then tap the Paste but­
ton that appears. You can also paste text by holding your finger on the micro­
phone key and selecting the paste icon.

Copying Text from a Web Page
Chances are when you’re browsing the Web, you’ll eventually come across 
some text that you want to save for later use. The Galaxy S5 has a specific—but 
simple—procedure for copying text from a web page to the Clipboard:
1.	Hold your finger on the text you want to copy. A magnifying glass appears, 
and the word is highlighted in blue.
2.	Take your finger off the screen. The word is bracketed and a menu bar 
appears above the text. Move either one or both of the brackets to include 
all the text you want to copy. A menu bar appears.
3.	Tap the Copy icon. The text is copied to the Clipboard. You can also tap the 
Select All icon to select all the text on the page; tap “Share via” to share it 
via Bluetooth, email, Facebook, or several other ways; tap Dictionary to look 
up the word; tap Find to find the word in the page; and tap “Web search” to 
perform an Internet search for the text. Not all the icons will be immediately 
visible on the bar, so you’ll have to swipe to see them.
Text Messaging
WHAT? YOU USE YOUR smartphone to make phone calls? That’s so early 21st 
century! Fittingly, the Galaxy S5 is a messaging monster. Not only can you send 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
54	
chapter	 2
and receive plain old text messages, but you can send and receive pictures and 
videos along with them as well.
When you send text messages, you use the SMS (Short Message Service), which 
limits you to 160 characters (including spaces and punctuation), which comes 
out to a sentence or two. That may sound short, but in a world where Twitter 
limits you to messages of 140 characters, 160 characters can suddenly seem like 
a lot of space.
 NOTE 	 Text messaging is different from a chat program. A chat program establishes a 
direct connection between you and another person or people, and in addition to letting 
you chat with one another via the keyboard, you can do videochats and more. For details 
on how to chat with Google Hangouts and Samsung’s ChatON program, see page 274.
Text messaging doesn’t come free. You’ll have to pay extra, either for a monthly 
plan or for individual text messages. Check with your wireless provider for 
details.
 NOTE 	 The charges for text messaging are for messages you receive as well as those 
you send.
Receiving a Text Message
When you get a text message, the S5 plays a notification sound. What happens 
next depends upon whether the phone is active or asleep:
• If you’re using the phone, you hear a notification sound, and a message 
appears across the top of your screen. A notification also appears in the 
status bar.
• If the phone is asleep, it wakes up, you hear a notification sound, and you 
get a notification that you’ve got a text message (at the top of your screen).
 TIP 	 When someone sends you a text message with links in it, the links are live. Tap a 
web address to visit it in your browser, or tap a phone number to dial the number for a 
voice call.
In either case, pull down the Notification panel and tap the notice. If you’ve got 
more than one text message, the notice tells you so. You go straight to a list of 
your most recent text messages, those you’ve sent as well as those that have 
been sent to you. You see only the last text message in a conversation. So if you

exchanged four text messages with someone three days ago, you see only the 
last message listed here.
To read the message you were just sent, tap it. You see the message in a text 
balloon, and if it’s part of an ongoing conversation of messages, you see each 
message.

 NOTE 	 Text messagers are encountering an unpleasant fact of texting life—spam. It’s 
not nearly as prevalent as email spam, but you’ll most likely get some at some point in 
your messaging life.
To respond, tap in your message using the keyboard, and then press the Send 
icon next to your text message. Off your message goes, instantly. You see the 
record of your message appear in a text balloon. If your friend texts back, you 
see it in a text balloon…and so on.
Sending a Text Message
To send a text message if you haven’t received one, tap the Messaging icon on 
the Home screen or the Apps screen. The list of all your messages appears. Tap 
the pen icon at upper right, and a screen appears where you create your text 
message. There are several ways to tell the Galaxy S5 where to send your text 
message, both accessible from the To field:

• Type a name into the field. The phone looks through your contacts and 
displays any matches. Tap the contact to whose cellphone you want to send 
a text message.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
58	
chapter	 2
• Tap a phone number into the field.
• Tap the icon of a person next to the recipient field, and you’re sent to your 
Contacts list, where you can choose a recipient.
After that, type your message in the message field and tap the Send icon, and 
your message goes on its merry way.
 TIP 	 If you prefer to talk rather than type, press the microphone key on the keyboard, 
and then speak your message (page 48). Yes, it’s odd to send a text message that starts 
out as spoken, but welcome to the 21st century.
There are plenty of other places on the Galaxy S5 where you can send text mes­
sages. Here are the most common ones:
• When you’re viewing a contact. Tap the Message icon next to a phone 
number to address a text message to that number. Anywhere you view your 
contacts, you’re only a tap or two away from sending a text message.
 NOTE 	 Make sure when you tap the Message icon that the phone number is a cellphone 
number. If it’s a landline, the message won’t go through.
• When you’re viewing pictures or video. You can share these things via text 
messaging much the same way you can share them via email. When viewing 
the picture or video, tap it so the top menu appears, and then tap the Share 
button. From the screen that appears, tap the Messages icon. The photo will 
be embedded into a text message. Type any text you want, and then add the 
recipient and send it as you would any other text message.  
 NOTE 	 If the photo or video is too large to send, the S5 will compress it for you. It will 
take a few seconds to compress, depending on its size.

Adding Pictures, Audio, and Video
On the Galaxy S5, the term “text message” is an understatement, because you 
can send a whole lot more than text using the SMS service. It’s a breeze to send 
a photo, an audio snippet, a video, an entire slideshow, a name card with contact 
information on it, and more. You can even take a photo or record a video and 
embed that as well. When you’re composing your text message, tap the Insert 
icon (it’s the picture of a paper clip) to choose any of these items and others 
from a menu that appears. Depending on what you choose, you’ll come to a 
different menu—for example, all your photo albums if you choose to include a 
photo. From the menu, you can also take a picture, or record audio or video, 
which you can then send.
You end up back on the text-messaging screen, where you see an attachment 
icon on the left side of the screen. Tap Send, and the S5 sends your picture. 
After a moment or two, you’ll see the message you just sent, including the pic­
ture, audio, or video.

Text Messaging Tricks
When you’re composing a text message, you’re in the text input box, and you 
tap the Menu button, you have more options than just inserting a picture, audio, 
or video. You can even create a slideshow. Here are your primary options when 
you tap the Menu button: 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Typing, Texting, and Searching	
61
 NOTE 	 These options don’t appear unless you’re in the text entry field. Also, other op­
tions may appear as well, depending on the person you’re contacting.
• Quick responses. Tap this to pop in preset text messages, such as “How’s it 
going,” and “What’s up.” No, it’s not Shakespeare, but it gets the job done.
• Insert Smiley. If you’re a fan of smileys, also called emoticons, tap here to 
see a long list of ones you can insert. (If smileys set your teeth on edge, 
avoid this option.)
• Add Subject. Creates a subject field so you can add a subject line to your 
text.
• Preview. Previews the text you’re going to send, when you’ve created a 
slideshow using the “Add slide” option, or if you’ve embedded a picture or 
video into the text. (This option appears only under those circumstances.)
• Add slide. This tricky option is fun once you get used to it. Tap it and a slide 
doesn’t actually get added—instead you see a dotted line of text with “1/2” 
at the right. That means you’ve created a two-slide show and one of the 
slides is already done—the text you initially put into the message. To add a 
picture to the slide, tap the paper clip icon and select what you want to put 
there. You can keep adding slides in this manner, by choosing “Add slide” 
from the menu and placing what you want in each slide.

Searching Your Galaxy S5
LOOKING TO FIND THE proverbial needle in a haystack on your Galaxy S5? It 
can seem like an insurmountable problem. After all, the S5’s haystack is rather 
large, including contacts, maps, social networking sites like Facebook, and the 
entire Web.
It could take you quite a long time to find a needle in all that hay if you didn’t 
have the S5’s universal search, which searches all of the above in one fell swoop. 
Here’s what universal search scans to find matches for you:
 NOTE 	 This list will vary according to the apps installed on your S5.
• Contacts. Search through first and last names, and also company names. It 
lists names as well as phone numbers in the results.
• Browser. Looks through your bookmarks and web history.
• Music. Searches artist names, album names, and track names.
• Kindle. If you have the Kindle book-reading app from Amazon on your S5, 
then universal search looks through the titles and authors of the books 
you’ve downloaded.
 NOTE 	 When you first unpacked and used your Galaxy S5, it may not have had the 
Kindle app on it, and you may never have downloaded it. Yet the app may be on your 
Galaxy S5 all the same. If so, that’s because it may have been installed during one of the 
software updates performed on your phone wirelessly. (It’s called an over-the-air update, 
or OTA.)
• Google search. Lists popular Google searches that include your search term. 
It also includes search terms you’ve already used on Google, even those that 
you’ve used on a computer, not on your phone.
• Titles of installed apps. It searches through the names of apps you’ve 
downloaded. Tap a name to launch the app.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
64	
chapter	 2
• Contacts on social media sites. Universal search doesn’t just search through 
the contacts on your phone—it also searches through contacts on social 
networking sites whose apps you’ve installed, such as Facebook.
• Text messages. It searches through text messages you’ve sent and received.
Performing a Search
To launch a search from the Home screen, tap in the Google search box. Tap 
in your text, and the Galaxy S5 does its magic. As you tap, search displays its 
results, narrowing the results as you type and your search term gets more spe­
cific. In addition, you’ll also see Google recommendations for your search.
As you type, just beneath the search box, you’ll see Google recommendations 
for searching the Web, and then any partial matches of apps, contacts, and 
other matches from your phone. So, for example, you might see individual music 
tracks and individual contacts there as well.
To search the Web, tap the Search button; to choose any Google suggestions, 
tap them; and to launch any matching app, open a contact, and so on, just tap 
it. And to search your phone, tap Search Phone (naturally). Why do you need 
to search your phone, when the S5 has just searched it? Tapping Search Phone 
does a deeper search. It lists the search results by category. If there are too 
many to show for each category, there’s a Show More button at the bottom of 
the category. Tap it to see more matches.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Typing, Texting, and Searching	
65
Look down at the bottom of the screen. There’s a set of icons for many dif­
ferent kinds of searches, including Books, Videos, Apps, Shopping, and more. 
You won’t be able to see them all, so swipe to the side to see more. Tap any to 
launch a search. The search, though, will be Web-focused—for example, tapping 
Images uses Google image search, and tapping Places searches Google Places. 
Tapping Phone, though, searches your phone yet again. And tapping More 
brings up a whole host of new Google searches, ranging from News to Books to 
Shopping to Video and more.
Voice Search
WANT TO SAVE WEAR and tear on your fingers? Use voice search. It works 
like regular search, with one very important difference: Rather than typing your 
search, you speak it. Other than that, everything is the same.
To perform a voice search, tap the microphone icon to the right of a Google 
search box, or else press the Search button and choose Voice Search from the 
screen that appears. Talk into the phone clearly. Your S5 gamefully tries to inter­
pret what you’ve said. It then displays results. (For more detail on searching by 
voice, see page 357.)
www.it-ebooks.info

	
66	
chapter	 2
    
The S5 can also perform a very nifty trick—listen to a piece of music, and then 
tell you what it is and link to it. While doing a voice search, tap “Listen to Music” 
and hold the phone close enough to the music source so the S5 can hear it. 
After a little bit, if Google can figure out the music, it shows a match, including a 
link to buy the music or to listen to it if you own it. This feature is really useful if 
you’re listening to music and want to know who is singing.
 TIP 	 This feature can be somewhat flaky. When I tried it with what many people believe 
is the best rock song ever written, Bob Dylan’s “Like a Rolling Stone,” the S5 failed to 
recognize it.

You’ll learn to:
• Use the dialer and Contacts 
app to make calls
• Use Favorites as your speed 
dialer
• Manage, add, and delete 
contacts
• Use the S5 for conference 
calls
• Use caller ID, call forward­
ing, and call waiting
www.it-ebooks.info

THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S5 can do so much, you may forget it’s a phone as 
well. Among all the amazing things this device can do, though, it’s great for 
making phone calls. When texting just won’t do, the Galaxy S5 offers everything 
from simple voice calls to nifty features like visual voicemail and call waiting—
and that’s what you’ll learn in this chapter.
Once you see by the bars in the Galaxy S5’s upper-right corner that you’ve got 
cellular reception, you’re ready to make calls. You can place a call in any of five 
ways. Don’t be daunted by the variety—all methods are easy, including a “Look, 
Ma, no hands” approach to calls that lets you call someone by talking into the 
phone rather than by using your fingers to tap keys.
Placing a Phone Call
THE GALAXY S5’S PHONE App is Command Central for making phone calls. 
On the Home screen, tap the phone icon (at lower left). The Phone app opens, 
with four buttons at the top, representing the four ways you can make a call:
• Keypad. You’ll be pleased to see that the virtual buttons on this dialer are 
a whole lot bigger and easier to tap than the cramped keypads on most 
cellphones. Even if you have fat fingers or iffy coordination, tapping the right 
number is a breeze. Tap the number you want to call, and then tap the green 
Call button at the bottom.
CHAPTER

Phone Calls
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 3
• Logs. On this list of recent activity, icons indicate calls that you’ve made  , 
received , or missed . You also see more information about the call, like 
the date and time. To repeat or return a call, tap its listing in the log. When 
the call screen appears, tap the green phone button.
 TIP 	 You can also send a text message from the Logs area. Tap the listing and then tap 
the text message icon on the screen that appears.
• Favorites. The Galaxy S5’s version of speed dial. The Galaxy S5 lists the 
people you call or contact frequently. Tap the person’s name, and then on 
the screen that appears, choose how you want to get in touch—phone, email, 
text message, and so on.
• Contacts. Tap a contact, and you can choose from among making a call, 
sending a text message, sending an email, sending an instant message via 
Google Talk, and more. The options you see here depend on the informa­
tion you have for that contact. If you don’t have someone’s email address, 
for example, you won’t get that option. You’ll find out more about all these 
options later in this chapter.
You may see more contacts here than what you originally tapped into your 
phone. That’s because, if you have a Gmail account, the S5 imports those 
contacts into its Contacts list. It can also import contacts from other ser­
vices, like Facebook. You’ll see how it works later in this chapter (page 77).
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Phone Calls 	
71
 TIP 	 You don’t need to go to the Phone app first anytime you want to call or text some­
one. Instead, you can tap the orange Contacts icon on the Home screen, the Apps screen, 
or anywhere else you see it.
Dialing a Call
MAKING A CALL WITH the dialer is straightforward: Tap the virtual buttons, 
and then tap the green phone button to place the call. You’ll find the keypad 
easier to use than a normal cellphone keypad because its buttons are larger.
If you want to call in to your voicemail instead (see page 88), tap the voicemail 
button at lower left. (It looks like a cassette tape from an old-school answering 
machine.)
 NOTE 	 Depending on your carrier, you may not have a voicemail button. For example, 
on Verizon you may have a button with a microphone that lets you speak the number you 
want to call. 
When you make a call, the Dialing screen pops up showing you the phone num­
ber you’re dialing. If you have a picture of the person in your Contacts list, you 
see that photo here. A timer begins, showing you the elapsed time of the call. 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
72	
chapter	 3
There are also buttons for putting the call on the Galaxy S5’s built-in speaker, 
muting the call, and connecting to a Bluetooth headset. And, of course, to end 
the call, tap the “End call” button.
    
Next to the “End call” button is another button whose purpose seems baffling at 
first—Keypad. Why would you need a keypad when you’re already on a call? For 
that most annoying means of modern communication—the phone tree. Press 
the keypad button, and you can experience all the joys of having to “Press 1 for 
more options.”
The Dialing screen offers a bit more Galaxy S5 phone magic. Hit the “Add call” 
button and presto—you’ve created your own conference call. For details, check 
out page 86.
Choosing from the Logs
The Logs list shows you every call you’ve made or received—and lets you make 
phone calls right from the list. Tap the Logs button at the top of the screen, and 
you see your call history listed in chronological order. You see the name, phone 
number, and time each call was made. Icons next to each call listing provide 
further details:
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Phone Calls 	
73
• 
 means a call you made.
• 
 means a call made to you.
• 
 means a call you missed or didn’t answer.
 NOTE 	 For calls you made, the log doesn’t tell you whether or not anyone answered; 
only that you placed the call.
You can also get more information about each call in the Logs list by tapping 
anywhere in the log entry (except on the contact’s picture—more on that in a 
minute). A screen then appears with more details about the call, including the 
exact date and time it was made and its duration. You even see all your recent 
history of calls and communications with that person. From here you can also 
call her (tap the phone icon), send her a text message, add her to your Contacts 
list, view her info in Contacts if she’s already there, and more.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
74	
chapter	 3
Back on the Logs list, if you tap the contact’s picture (or if there’s no picture, the 
person icon), a pop-up screen appears. Tap any of the icons on it to contact the 
person in the following ways, among others:
• Call the person.
• Open his record in Contacts.
• Send him a text message.
• Send him an email.
• Contact him via a social networking site such as Facebook. You see this 
option only if you’ve installed the appropriate social networking app on your 
Galaxy S5 as described in Chapter 11.
• Locate the person on Google Maps by using the address information in your 
address book.
 TIP 	 Tap the Menu button for ways to manage the Logs list, including deleting indi­
vidual entries, searching for a person on the list, and more.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Phone Calls 	
75
Choosing from Your Contacts
The Phone app gets phone numbers, pictures, and other information by tapping 
into your main Contacts list. The Galaxy S5 gets these contacts from multiple 
places. For example, if you use Gmail, the S5 automatically imports your Gmail 
contacts into its list. And if you use S5 along with Facebook, your Facebook 
friends join the party as well. You can also add contacts directly to the S5. You’ll 
learn all the ins and outs of Contacts in the next section. Suffice it to say that if 
you’ve ever interacted with someone by email or social media, chances are your 
S5 already has her phone number.
 NOTE 	 You may notice that on your Contacts list, many people have pictures next to 
their names, even though you never took their pictures. Is the Galaxy S5 pulling hidden 
camera tricks? Of course not. If you use Facebook on your Galaxy S5, it pulls in pictures 
from Facebook for any of your contacts who have them. It also pulls in pictures from 
Google+ as well. 
When you first load Contacts, you’ll notice something odd and potentially 
annoying—the S5 arranges your contacts alphabetically by first name, not last 
name. So if you know a lot of Joes and Marys, you’re going to spend a little more 
time than you’d like scrolling.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
76	
chapter	 3
 NOTE 	 Why does the Galaxy S5 alphabetize by first name, rather than by last name? 
It’s a Google thing. Google wrote the Android operating system that powers the phone, 
and Gmail alphabetizes its contact list by first name. As Gmail does, so does the Galaxy S5.
You likely know more than one screenful of people, and you can navigate 
through the list in several ways:
First, you can flick through the list. You’ll see the alphabet down the right side of 
the screen, and you can tap any letter to get sent to that letter immediately.
You can also search the list. Type into the search box at the top, and as you type, 
the list gets pared down, hiding everyone whose first name, last name, com­
pany name, or title doesn’t match what you’ve typed. It’s a great time-saver for 
quickly paring down a big list. You also see the words you’re typing, just above 
the keyboard, so you can more easily track what you type.
 TIP 	 How do you find a contact whose name you can’t recall? If you know someone’s 
place of work, type that in, and you’ll see a list of all your contacts who work at that 
company.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Phone Calls 	
77
When you’ve gotten to the person you want to call, tap the person’s contact 
listing. You’ll see all the information you have about him—phone numbers, email 
addresses, home and work addresses, and more. From this screen you can make 
a call, send an email or text message, and so on by tapping the appropriate icon.
Managing Contacts
THE GALAXY S5’S PHONE, Messaging, and IM apps all use the same master 
Contacts list. In fact, you can go directly to the list by tapping the Contacts icon 
on the Apps screen.
 NOTE 	 Although the Contacts app has its own launch icon, it simply sends you to the 
same Contacts list you see in the Phone app. Everything you learned in the previous sec­
tion applies everywhere you use your Contacts on the Galaxy S5.
The Galaxy S5 is nothing if not thoughtful. If you use Gmail or Google+, the 
phone grabs all your contacts from there and pops them into your Contacts list. 
And it’s not just a one-time transfer of contacts, but it happens every time you 
add, edit, or delete a contact. Whenever you change or add a contact in Gmail 
or Google+, those changes are synced to your S5, and vice versa. So, if possible, 
it’s better to create new contacts in Gmail on your computer, and then let the 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
78	
chapter	 3
phone import that new information when you sync up. It’s much easier to type 
on a keyboard than it is to tap on your S5.
Adding a Contact
It’s easy to add a contact right on your Galaxy S5. Tap the + button at the top 
of your Contacts list (the button stays there even when you scroll) and a screen 
pops up asking where you want to save the contact. The available locations 
may vary depending on the apps you have and your S5 setup, but at a minimum 
you’ll be able to choose from saving to your SIM card, to the device, to your 
Google account, or to a Samsung account if you’ve set it up. No matter where 
you save the contact, though, it’ll show up in your Contacts list. However, if 
you save to your device or SIM card, the contact won’t sync with your Google 
account, so your best bet is to go for the Google option.
After you choose where to create your contact, you arrive at a screen where 
you fill in contact information. Type the person’s first name, last name, address 
information, and so on. If she has more than one email address, phone number, 
or address, tap the + button next to the entry to add more. Make sure to scroll 
through this whole screen—there’s plenty of information you can add here.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Phone Calls 	
79
One more trick—you can add a photo to the contact information. At the top 
of the screen, tap the icon that looks like a person’s head with a + on it, and a 
screen appears that lets you add a photo. If you already have a photo on your 
phone, tap Image and you can browse through the Gallery (page 115) for the 
picture. If the person happens to be right there with you, tap “Take picture,” and 
the Camera app launches. Use it to take a photo. There are several other options 
available for adding pictures, but none are as easy as browsing the Gallery or 
snapping a photo on the spot.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
80	
chapter	 3
 NOTE 	 If you want to change the location where you’re saving a contact, tap the same 
triangle on the right side near the top of the screen that shows the location you’re saving 
to. When you tap the triangle, you’ll get a choice of other locations where you might want 
to save.
The Contact screen also lets you do way cooler things than typing in basic infor­
mation. You can choose a specific ringtone and even tell your phone to vibrate in 
a certain way when that contact calls. So pay attention to those fields. And there 
are plenty more fields you can add as well. Tap “Add another field,” and you’ll 
get plenty of options, like Relationship, Notes, and so on.
Editing Contacts
Already have a contact and want to edit his information? Tap the Edit button at 
the top of a contact, and then edit to your heart’s content. You can change or 
add any of the same things as when you first added the contact.
For even more contact-handling options, tap the Menu button when you’re 
viewing a contact. You’ll be able to do things like these:
• Delete the contact.
• Combine two different bits of contact information into one (if one comes 
from Gmail, for example, and another from Facebook).
• Add a shortcut to the contact to the Home screen.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Phone Calls 	
81
• Share the contact information via Bluetooth, email, text message, and other 
ways.
Working with Groups
Like most folks, you probably have a long list of contacts, and although Contacts 
lets you flick through them quickly, you might have a hard time zeroing in on 
the person you want. There’s a simpler way—Groups. The Galaxy S5 lets you 
put contacts in various groups—Family, Work, and so on—making it easier to 
find the person you want. You can view just the group rather than the entire 
Contacts list.
The Groups button appears to the right of the search box when you’re viewing 
all your contacts in a list. Tap it to see your Groups. Tap any group in the list 
to see all its members. To create a new group, when you’re viewing the list of 
your groups, tap the + button. Type a name for the group and then start putting 
people in it. Tap Add Member, and your entire contact list appears, with a check­
box next to every contact. Tap that box for each contact you want to add to the 
group, and when you’ve added everyone, tap Done.
 TIP 	 From the screen that lets you create a group, you can also select a ringtone for 
when anyone from that group calls you. (Beyoncé for your ring-theory group, perhaps?)

Fancy Tricks with Contacts
The Galaxy S5 has a few more tricks up its sleeve when it comes to working 
with contacts. To see them, open a contact, and then press the Menu button. 
The choices vary according to the contact information you have. Here are the 
choices you’ll see, and what each does:
• Delete. Deletes the contact from your Galaxy S5.
• Link contacts. Combines two separate listings for a contact into a single 
listing. For example, if you’ve imported a contact from both Gmail and 
Facebook, they’ll usually show up as separate contacts until you combine 
them using Join.
• Share name card. Lets you send information about a contact using many dif­
ferent sharing methods, such as via Bluetooth, email, WiFi Direct, and others. 
You can send all the information about the contact or just some of it. Follow 
the onscreen prompts after you make your choice about how you want to 
share.
• Remove from favorites. This option appears only if the person is in your 
favorites list.
• Add to favorites. Adds the person to your Favorites—the Galaxy S5’s version 
of speed dial.
• Send contact information. Lets you send information from the contact via 
email. 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Phone Calls 	
83
• Add to reject list. Puts the person on a list of callers you don’t want to hear 
from. Your phone won’t answer calls from numbers on this list.
• Print contact info. If you have a wirelessly enabled printer that works with 
your Galaxy S5, you can print the person’s namecard.
• Add shortcut to home screen. Puts a link to the contact on your Home 
screen.
 TIP 	 If you’re viewing a contact, you can get to some of the same choices by tapping 
the Menu button.

of contacts is a complete waste of time. You need a way to quickly jump to the 
contacts you frequently call.
That’s where the Favorites list comes in. Think of it as the Galaxy S5’s speed dial. 
The S5 puts people on the list based on how often you communicate with them. 
Other than that, it works the exact same way as the normal Contacts list.

chapter	 3
Although the S5 automatically adds your frequently used contacts to the 
Favorites list, you can also add your own. Just open the contact and tap the star 
at the top of the screen. The star turns gold, and the person shows up on your 
Favorites list.
 NOTE 	 To remove someone from your Favorites list, open the contact and then tap 
the gold star. It loses its gold color, indicating that the person is no longer one of your 
Favorites.
Answering Calls
ONE RINGY-DINGY, TWO RINGY-DINGIES…when you get a call on your 
Galaxy S5, you’ll know in no uncertain terms that someone is trying to reach 
you. Depending on how you’ve set up your S5 to handle incoming calls, you’ll 
hear a ring, feel a vibration, and see the caller’s name, photo, and phone number 
onscreen.
 NOTE 	 For information about how to choose a ringtone, and whether to use Vibrate 
mode, see page 373.

Phone Calls 	
85
The way you find out when a call is coming in, and the way you answer it, 
depends on what you’re doing when you get the call:
• If you’re doing something else on the Galaxy S5, you’ll hear a notification, 
and a screen appears telling you that you’ve got a call. Slide the green but­
ton from left to right. When the call is over, tap “End call.” If you don’t want 
to answer the call at all, drag the red button from right to left.
• If the Galaxy S5 is asleep or locked, you get the same call screen and the 
same red and green buttons. Even if you’ve added a password to your 
phone, you answer the phone the same way—no password required to 
answer a call.
• If you’re wearing earbuds or listening to music on an external speaker, the 
music stops playing and you hear the ringtone in your earbuds or speaker. 
Slide the green or red button. After the call ends, the music starts playing 
again.
Turning Off the Ring
If the Galaxy S5 starts to ring at an inopportune time, you can turn off the ring­
tone without turning off the phone or dropping the call. Just press the volume 
switch at the phone’s upper-left side. The ring goes away, but you can still 
answer the call in any of the usual ways.

chapter	 3
Ignoring the Call
Suppose you’re just getting to the juicy part of a book you’re reading, or you 
simply don’t want to talk to the annoying person calling. You can ignore the call. 
After five rings, the call goes to voicemail. (It does so even if you’ve silenced the 
ring with the volume switch.)
If you prefer, you can send the call straight to voicemail, without further ado or 
further rings. And not only that, but you can also send a text message to the 
caller, explaining why you can’t answer the call. To do it, pull up the “Reject call 
with message” button at the bottom of the screen, and select from any of the 
messages that appear, such as “I’m driving,” “I’m in a meeting,” and so on. The 
caller will be sent straight to voicemail, and he’ll also get the text message from 
you. You can also write your own text—as long as, of course, you’re not driving—
by tapping “Create new message.”
Conference Calling
HERE’S A FANCY PHONE trick that’s great for business and personal use: con­
ference calls. Sitting at a Starbucks, but want people on the other end to think 
you’re in an office with a fancy phone system? The Galaxy S5 lets you confer­
ence in multiple people with no extra charges or software, depending on your 
carrier. And you can also use it for conferencing in friends when you’re all trying 
www.it-ebooks.info

to decide whether to meet at 6 p.m. before the Red Sox game so you can catch 
Big Papi at batting practice.
To make a conference call, first make a call as you would normally. Then tap 
“Add call.” A screen appears where you can dial the second number, or else get 
the number from your Logs list, Contacts, or Favorites. At upper left, you’ll see 
an indication that you’re on a call, and a timer shows you how much time has 
elapsed.
After you make the second call, you’ll see a series of new icons labeled with 
text. One shows the name of the original caller and shows he’s on hold; another, 
called Merge, lets you merge both calls into a single conference call; and the 
final one, Swap, lets you switch between the calls. As you switch to one call, the 
other one is placed on hold.
To end the call, tap “End call.” If you’re in a conference, both calls will be ended. 
If you’re talking to just one of the people on the line, only that call will end, and 
you’re automatically switched to the other call.

Voicemail
YOUR GALAXY S5 HAS built into it all the usual voicemail capabilities you’d 
expect. You know the drill: Dial in to your voicemail, enter a password, and listen 
to voice messages. To dial in to voicemail on the Galaxy S5, hold down the “1” 
key on the keypad (it has a voicemail icon on it.) If you’re using voicemail for the 
first time, follow the prompts for setting up your voicemail box, including choos­
ing a password and selecting or recording a message.
Visual Voicemail
Looking for something niftier? Depending on your carrier, the Galaxy S5 may 
have visual voicemail, which lets you see, listen to, and manage all your voice­
mails in a neat, chronological list instead of dealing with a bunch of prompts. 
For example, if you’ve got 17 messages, and you want to listen to number 17, you 
don’t need to listen to the other 16 first. Just tap message 17.
When you’re playing a voicemail, you get visual controls for pausing, restart­
ing, and calling back. Tap the menu button at the top of the screen, and you can 
forward the call. There are several ways to delete a call. While you’re listening to 
it, or after you’ve heard it, tap the Delete button at the top of the screen. When 
you’re viewing the complete voicemail list, you can also delete one by holding 
your finger on it and selecting Delete from the menu that appears.

For details, check with your carrier. You may be charged extra every month to 
use this service, often a fee of about $3. To use the service, select Settings from 
the Apps screen, and then tap Visual Voicemail.
Call Waiting
THE GALAXY S5 OFFERS call waiting, so it lets you know when you have an 
incoming call while you’re already on a call. You can choose to either answer the 
new call—and put the first call on hold—or ignore it and let it go to voicemail. If 
you’re a real fast talker, you can even keep both calls going at once and switch 
back and forth.
When you’re on a call and another call comes in, your screen shows you the 
phone number of the second caller. The phone won’t ring or vibrate, and at that 
point, you’re still on the call with your first caller.
You have two choices:
• Answer. Answer the call as you would normally, and you can accept the 
incoming call. You get an “Answer call” notification message on your screen 
that gives you two choices: Put your first caller on hold and answer the call, 
or end the first call and answer the incoming call. If you answer the call and 
put the first caller on hold, you’ll see the same screen as you do for confer­
ence calling, and you can switch back and forth between the calls or merge 
them.
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 3
• Ignore. You can ignore the call as you normally ignore an incoming call, and 
proceed with your first call.
Call Forwarding
CALL FORWARDING LETS YOU have your Galaxy S5 calls rerouted to a differ­
ent number. That way, when you’re at home, you can have your cellphone calls 
ring on your landline and have to deal with only one phone. Even if the S5 is out 
of commission, you can still forward its calls to another phone and never miss a 
call.
If you haven’t used call forwarding before, first make sure that the service is 
available from your carrier and activated. Check with the carrier for details.
Once you’ve done that, turning on call forwarding is a breeze. On the Apps 
screen, tap Settings, scroll to the Applications area, and tap Call→“Additional 
settings”→“Call forwarding.” From the screen that appears, you can turn call 
forwarding on and off and set rules for when to have call forwarding turn on 
automatically—for example, when your phone is busy or you don’t answer it. 
When you turn on call forwarding for the first time, you enter the number where 
you want your calls forwarded.

Caller ID
CALLER ID IS BUILT into the very guts of the Galaxy S5. That’s why you see 
the phone number, and at times the caller’s name, every time you get a call. 
And when you call someone, she sees your phone number as well. There’s a 
way to block your number from being displayed, although as with call forward­
ing, you can’t do it on the phone, but have to go through your carrier. Check 
your account to make sure you have the capability. Then when you want to 
block your phone number from being displayed when you make a call, tap *67, 
and then make the call. Your number won’t be displayed on the receiving end. 
Instead, the person will see “Private” or “Anonymous” or something to that 
effect. When the call ends, Caller ID is reactivated; you’ll have to tap *67 again 
to enable it on your next call.
You can also turn off outgoing Caller ID on your carrier’s website, log into your 
wireless account, and turn it off there. You may see an “Add/Change features” 
section, for example, where you can turn on the checkbox for Caller ID Blocking.
Bluetooth Earpieces
BLUETOOTH IS A SHORT-RANGE wireless technology designed to let all kinds 
of devices connect with one another, exchange or sync files and photos, or let a 
cellphone serve as a wireless modem for a computer.
With a little work you can get the S5 to do all that. Mostly, though, the phone’s 
Bluetooth capabilities come in handy for hands-free talking with an earpiece.
If you’ve ever seen someone walking down the street, apparently talking to an 
invisible friend, you’ve seen Bluetooth in action (unless he really was talking to 
an invisible friend). The small device clips to your ear, and you talk into its micro­
phone and listen in the tiny speaker in your ear.
 NOTE 	 The earpiece you use for making phone calls is typically monaural, and not de­
signed for listening to music. If you’re a music lover, invest in a stereo Bluetooth headset.
Pairing with a Bluetooth Earpiece
To use a Bluetooth earpiece with your phone, you’ll need to pair them—that is, 
get the two of them talking to each other. The process is a bit geeky, but not 
difficult. The exact steps may vary a bit depending on the earpiece you’re using. 
But, generally, these are the steps you’ll take:
www.it-ebooks.info

	
92	
chapter	 3
1.	On the earpiece, turn on Bluetooth and make it discoverable. In other 
words, set the earpiece so your Galaxy S5 can find it. Check the earpiece’s 
documentation on how to do so.
2.	On your S5, turn on Bluetooth there, too. You have several ways to do 
this. The simplest is to pull down the Notification panel and tap the 
Bluetooth icon, if Bluetooth isn’t already turned on. You can also turn it on 
by tapping Settings in the Apps screen, and in the Network Connections 
area, tap the Bluetooth icon. Once Bluetooth is on, the S5 will start scan­
ning for any nearby Bluetooth equipment. Your earpiece should show up 
on the list.
3.	Tap the earpiece’s name and type a passcode. You’ll find the passcode in 
the earpiece’s manual. The passcode is for security purposes, so that no 
one else can pair with the device. The number is usually between four and 
six digits, and you’ll need to type it within a minute or so. You only need to 
enter the passcode once. After that, the pairing will happen automatically.
You should now be connected. You still dial using the Galaxy S5, but you can 
talk through the earpiece. Check the earpiece’s documentation on how to 
answer calls, control the volume, and so on.

 TIP 	 Having trouble getting your new Bluetooth earpiece to work? Search the Internet 
for the make, model number, and the word setup. If you’re having trouble, someone else 
likely had trouble as well, and you’ll probably find a solution.
Bluetooth and Car Kits
An increasing number of cars include built-in Bluetooth so that you can pair your 
S5 with it. This way, you can make calls directly from your car’s control panel 
and hear calls over your car’s speakers. You can do other nifty things, such as 
play music from your phone on your car’s entertainment system.
If your car doesn’t have built-in Bluetooth, there are plenty of Bluetooth car kits 
out there. Generally, pairing your S5 with a Bluetooth car kit is much the same as 
pairing it with a Bluetooth earpiece. How you use the car kit varies, of course. In 
some instances, you can dial a number on the car’s touchscreen or answer the 
phone by pressing a button on the steering wheel.
 TIP 	 Don’t be lulled into thinking that driving with hands-free calling is safe. Studies 
show that the danger in talking on a phone while driving isn’t related to holding the 
phone—it’s the distraction of holding a conversation while driving.

Where to Get Music
BEFORE YOU PLAY MUSIC, of course, you first need to get it onto your Galaxy 
S5. For details about how to do that, turn to page 319. You can also buy or 
download music from Google’s Play store or other S5 apps. (The Play Music app 
is a Google music subscription service that also lets you play music you own on 
a computer—it doesn’t let you buy individual music tracks. For more info, see the 
Note on the next page.)
 NOTE 	 If you tap a download link on a web page for a music file in the Galaxy S5 
browser, the file doesn’t download to your phone. Instead, the S5 plays the music file but 
doesn’t add it to your collection.
Using the Music App
YOU PLAY AND MANAGE your music by using the Galaxy S5’s Music app. Tap 
the Music icon on the Apps screen to launch it. The app organizes your music 
into seven different lists, through which you scroll like all other lists on your 
phone. Simply swipe to the right and left to see all of them, and then tap any 
you want to view or play:
• Playlists. Here’s where you’ll find all your playlists—groups of songs that 
you’ve put together in a specific order, often for a specific purpose. For 
www.it-ebooks.info

example, you might have several party playlists, a playlist of songs you like 
to listen to while you work, another for the gym, and so on.
 NOTE 	 In addition to the Music app built into the S5, Google also has a cloud-based 
music player app. With it, you can upload music from your PC or Mac to big Google com­
puters (called servers), and then play that music on your phone, without actually having 
to store it on the phone. (Because your music lives in the cloud—get it?) The service and 
app are free and work like a charm. The app is called Play Music and is likely already on 
your S5. If it’s not, though, download it from Google Play. There’s also a for-pay version 
that’s a streaming music service in which you pay a monthly fee and can stream music to 
your S5. See page 111 for details about the cloud music player. 
To see the contents of a playlist, tap the playlist. Tap any song to play it from 
that point until the end of the playlist. To add a song to the playlist, press the 
Menu key, tap “Add to playlist,” and then select songs to add from the list 
that appears. (You can also add songs to playlists while you’re playing them, 
and in other ways as well. See page 107 for details.) When you press the 
Menu key, you get other ways to manage your playlist, including removing 
songs from the playlist, searching through the playlist, and changing settings 
(for the entire music app, not just for playlists).
• Tracks. An alphabetical list of every song in your music collection. It shows 
the song names and artists. Tap a song to play it.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
100	
chapter	 4
 NOTE 	 When you’re in the Music app, at the bottom of the screen, you see the name 
of the song you’re playing. If you’re not playing a song, you see the last song you played, 
along with a control for playing the song. Tap it and you’re sent to the full player. (See 
page 102 for details.)
• Albums. Lists all the CDs (albums) in your music collection. If a thumbnail 
picture of the album is available, you see it next to the album listing. Each 
album lists its name and its singer, composer, band, or orchestra. Tap the 
album to see a list of all the songs in the album. To play any song, tap it. The 
Music app then plays from that point until the end of the album.
To add songs from an album to a playlist, when you’re viewing an album, 
hold your finger on the song you want to add, and a screen appears with 
all the tracks on the album with checkboxes next to them. The song you’re 
pressing on has a checkmark next to it. Tap to put a checkmark next to other 
songs you want to add. Then tap the “Add to playlist” button at the top of 
the screen (it has a + sign on it) and select the playlist you want to add it to 
or create a new one.
• Artists. Lists every singer, composer, and band in your collection. Tap the 
artist’s name, and you see a list of all her songs. To play any song, tap it.

 NOTE 	 The Galaxy S5 can play a wide variety of music files, including AAC, MP3, WAV, 
WMA, OGG, AAC+, and MIDI. Android by itself won’t play WMA (Windows Music Audio) files, 
but Samsung gave the S5 a special piece of software called a codec so it can play them. 
For the same reason, it can also play WMV (Windows Media Video) videos.

• Music Squares. This unique-to-Android feature examines all your music and 
arranges tracks in different squares onscreen depending on the emotion 
of the music—Calm, Exciting, Passionate, and Joyful. It gives you a way to 
suggest the sort of music you want to listen to without having to come up 
with specific songs or artists. You can choose a mix of these music moods by 
tapping any square on the grid.
• Folders. Lists all your music by folder. Tap the folder to display all its files, 
and then tap a track to play it. The track will play, as will all the others from 
that point until the end of the listing.
• Devices. Lists all nearby devices on your network that have music on them. 
Tap a device to see the music on it. You can then play the music on the 
device, using the player, by tapping the music using the normal controls.
Playing Your Music
TAP A SONG TO play it. At the bottom of the screen, you see the usual controls 
for playing and pausing music and moving to the next or the previous track. If 
you want to play your music in random order, tap the Shuffle icon at the bottom 
left of the screen.

If you tap the picture of the music note and three horizontal lines at the lower 
left of the screen, the picture at the top of the music player vanishes and is 
replaced by a listing of all the tracks on the album or playlist. And if you hold the 
music player sideways, you’ll see a compact version of the player, plus recom­
mendations for other music you might like, based on the track you’re listening to.

The music player screen, when you’re holding your S5 vertically, is loaded with 
controls and widgets. Among other controls, you’ll find these:
• Pause/Play. When music is playing, the button looks as it normally does on 
any music player. Tap it to pause; tap it to play again.
• Previous, Next. These controls work just as you’d expect. Tap Previous to 
skip to the beginning of the song you’re playing or, if you’re already at the 
beginning, to go back to the last song you just played. Tap Next to skip to 
the following song.
Hold down one of the buttons, and you rewind or fast-forward through the 
song. As you hold, the rewinding or fast-forwarding accelerates. You’ll hear 
the music as you speed forward or backward, sounding like experimental, 
avant-garde music.
• Slider. Underneath the picture of the album from which the song is taken, 
you’ll see a slider that shows you the song’s progress. It includes the song’s 
total length and how much of it you’ve already played. Move the slider to go 
to a specific location in the song. 
• Song and album information. In the middle of the screen you’ll find the 
name of the singer, the name of the album, and the song being played.
• List. Tap the small musical note at lower left, and the big album image or 
musical note changes to the current song list. For example, if you’re listen­
ing to a playlist, you’ll see the entire playlist, and if you’re playing an album, 
you’ll see the whole album. From here, you can tap any other song to play it. 
To bring back the picture of the album or musical note, tap the button again, 
which has turned into a picture.

• Shuffle. The Galaxy S5 music player normally plays the songs in your playlist 
or album in order, from first to last. Tap the Shuffle button at lower left to 
play the songs in your current album or playlist in random order—you never 
know what’s coming next. Tap it again to stop the shuffle.
• Loop. Can’t get enough of the current album, playlist, or song? Tap the 
Loop button. This button starts out as an A with an arrow next to it. Tap it, 
and it changes into an A with a loop around it, signifying that the album or 
playlist will keep repeating. Tap it again and that changes to a number 1 with 
a loop around it, signifying that the track you’re currently playing will keep 
repeating. When you’ve had your fill, tap it again, and you get back to the A 
with an arrow, which means that looping is off.
 TIP 	 Want to play a stupid music player trick? Tap the picture of the album when you’re 
playing a song. Bubbles pop out from the picture. Why do this? Because you can. 
• Volume button. Tap this upper-right button, and a volume slider appears. 
Drag to increase or decrease the volume. Tap the small icon at the bot­
tom of the volume slider and you can select from a variety of built-in sound 
modes—Normal, Pop, Rock, Dance, Jazz, Classical, and so on.

• Other buttons. There are other buttons as well. The button just to the right 
of the volume buttons shows you nearby devices on your network whose 
music you might want to play. Tap the star just above the slider to turn it 
gold and identify the track as a favorite. That puts it on a playlist called, 
unsurprisingly, Favorites, that you can then play when you want. Tap the but­
ton with a + and three vertical lines to add the current song to a playlist.

More Music Controls and Features
Want even more music controls and features? Tap the Menu button, and you’ll 
be able to do all the following:
    
• Listen via Bluetooth. Lets you share the song via Bluetooth (see page 91).
• Set as. This very nifty feature lets you set a song as a ringtone or alarm tone.
• Settings. Lets you change many settings; sound effects, music menu items, 
and so on.
• Details. Provides all kinds of information about a song, including its title, art­
ist, track length, recording date, genre, and so on.
More Song Options
And, yes, you’ve got even more options when you play songs. Hold your finger 
on a track on a list, and boxes appear next to each track, with a checkmark on 
the current track. Tap the boxes on all the songs you want to select. You can 
then add them to Favorites or a playlist, or delete them. 
Creating Playlists
MAKING YOUR OWN PLAYLISTS is a breeze on the S5. The easiest way to do 
so is to tap the Playlist button at lower right when you’re playing a song (it’s a + 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
108	
chapter	 4
and a series of three horizontal lines), and then tap “Create a playlist.” A screen 
appears that lets you name your list. Type in a name and tap OK. A playlist is 
created, with that track added to it. If you already have playlists, then when you 
tap the Playlist button, you’ll see all of them, so that you can add the current 
song to an existing playlist or create a new one.
You can also create playlists from the Music player’s main screen. Tap Playlists 
at the top of the screen, and then tap “Create playlist” toward the bottom of the 
screen. A screen appears that lets you name the list. When you’re done, you’ll be 
sent to a screen that reads “No tracks.” Tap the + sign at the top of the screen, 
and you’ll see a list of all of your songs with empty boxes next to them. Turn on 
the boxes next to the music you want to add to the playlist, and then tap Done 
to add all those songs to the list. If you want to find specific music on your S5 to 
add to the playlist, tap the Search button.
The S5 creates several playlists automatically for you—“Favorite tracks,” 
“Recently added,” “Most played,” and “Recently played.” These playlists don’t 
show up when you try to add music to a playlist, because they’re created and 
managed by the S5.
To edit a playlist, when you’re in the list, hold your finger on a song. Boxes show 
up next to all the songs. Check those you want to manage in some way, and 
then perform your action—delete them by tapping the trash can icon, or add to 
other playlists by tapping the “Add to playlist” button.

Galaxy Radio
Another way to play music by using your 
Galaxy S5 is to use an app that turns the 
phone into an FM radio or streams music 
to the phone wirelessly. To use your S5 
as an FM radio, head to Google Play and 
download any one of many apps, like 
Tune-In Radio (www.tunein.com).
There are also many apps that play 
streaming music to your S5, like Pandora 
(www.pandora.com) and Spotify (www.
spotify.com); search for them by name in 
Google Play. In fact, if you already have 
a Pandora account that you use to play 
music from the Web, all your stations will 
already be set up when you use the S5’s 
Pandora app. How’s that for convenient?
Services like Pandora and Spotify have 
the seemingly psychic ability to learn 
what kind of music you like from the 
choices you make, and play similar 
songs for you. Spotify also lets you share 
music over Facebook, Twitter, and other 
services. With the S5, you can truly enjoy 
and share your tunes wherever you go.
APP ALERT
Using Your Galaxy S5 
While Playing Music
BECAUSE THE GALAXY S5 is built for multitasking, you can play music even 
when you’re doing something else. Open the Music app, start the music, and 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
110	
chapter	 4
then feel free to use other apps and features. The music keeps playing. While 
music is playing, a small button appears in the status bar. Drag down the 
Notification panel and tap the song playing, and you see a miniature set of con­
trols for playing, pausing, and jumping forward and back in music. To head to 
the music player, tap the picture of the album.
Even when your phone is locked, if you were listening to music before the 
Galaxy S5 locked itself, it keeps playing. Turn on the screen, even though the 
phone remains locked, and you’ll see music controls. You can pause and play 
music, as well as skip to the next song or go back to a previous song, without 
having to unlock the Galaxy S5.
Playing Music and Media 
on Other Devices
THE GALAXY S5 LETS you share, view, and play music, videos, and photos using 
a standard called DLNA—short for Digital Living Network Alliance. The S5 is 
DLNA-compliant, which means that it can share media with other DLNA devices, 
such as TVs, computers, and mobile devices. When you buy a device, look in the 
documentation to see if it’s also DLNA compliant. You can also look for this logo 
on packaging or documentation: 
.
 NOTE 	 If you’re not sure whether you have a device that’s DLNA-compliant, go to www.
dlna.org. In addition to finding out more information about DLNA, you can do a search for 
your device and see if it supports DLNA.
Here’s just some of what you can do with your Galaxy S5 and other DLNA 
devices:
• Stream your music, videos, and photos from your S5 to a DLNA device, such 
as a TV, PC, Xbox, or PlayStation 3.
• Transfer music and picture files from your phone to your PC.
• Stream videos from the phone to your TV.
• Browse any videos you have stored on your PC, using the Galaxy S5, and 
then stream the video to your TV by using an HDMI cable (see page 136 for 
details about HDMI).
And that’s just a few of the possibilities and permutations with your Galaxy S5 
and DLNA; this section can’t cover them all.

Out of the box, the S5 is set up to use DLNA. In the Music app, when the phone 
scans your network to see if there are nearby devices from which it can play 
music, it’s actually using DLNA.
For sharing with other devices such as TVs, check the device documentation 
for how to share via DLNA. And you can also customize your DLNA settings on 
your S5. To do it, tap Settings from the Apps screen, scroll down to “Connect 
and Share,” and tap “Nearby devices.” You’ll then be able to change your DLNA 
settings, such as what media content you want to share, what devices you want 
to share with, and so on.
Google Music Cloud Player App
THE GOOGLE MUSIC CLOUD Player may forever change the way you manage—
and even think about—your music. It lets you play music on your phone that 
isn’t actually on the phone, but instead lives in the cloud—basically big Google 
computers called servers that store your music and stream it to your Galaxy S5 
(or any other device, for that matter).
The app’s official name is Google Play Music, and it should come installed on 
your S5. If it isn’t, you can download it from Google Play. Then install the Play 
Music software on your PC or Mac (whichever computer houses your music col­
lection). You then tell the software to upload the music to the cloud. After that, 
you install Play Music on your S5 (or, indeed, any other Android device). At that 
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 4
point, you can listen to your music from the cloud—as long as you have a 3G, 4G, 
or WiFi connection.
Once you’ve got everything installed, just tap the Play Music app and start play­
ing. It integrates with the S5’s normal music player, so it plays any music you’ve 
got installed there, as well as music from the cloud.
And you can also subscribe to unlimited music streaming and play thousands of 
tracks for a $9.99 monthly fee, much like the streaming Spotify music service. 
Play Music will give you all the details if you tap “Try it Free” when you first run 
the app. If you don’t want to try the for-pay version, and only want to listen to 
your own music, instead tap “Not now” when you run the app.
 TIP 	 If you sign up for the pay service, you can download tracks for offline listening. 
That’s a great way to avoid eating up your data allowance by streaming music. 
Keep in mind that there will be times when your music isn’t available from the 
cloud—because you’re not connected to the Internet—so you can choose to hide 
streamed music at that point. You can also set a variety of other options, such 
as whether to stream music only when connected via WiFi rather than via 3G or 
4G. That way, you won’t eat up data from your data plan.
The cloud player is a fabulous player, especially if you have a digital music col­
lection on a PC or Mac. Check it out and listen to your beloved music anywhere!

You’ll learn to:
• View photos and videos in 
the Gallery
• Create slideshows
• Take photos and videos
• Use photo modes
• Use the S5 as a universal 
remote
www.it-ebooks.info

THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S5 has a big 5.1-inch screen for a good reason—it’s 
designed to excel at displaying photos and videos, and capturing them as well. It 
has a built-in 16-megapixel camera, so you can take photos in very high resolu­
tion, as well as a 2.1-megapixel front-facing camera for videoconferencing. It can 
even shoot and play HD (high definition) video. (For techies, it records video at 
4K resolution, which stands for horizontal resolution of 4,000 pixels. What does 
that mean in plain English? Two words: spectacular videos.)
In other words, you’ve got more than just a phone in your pocket—you’ve got a 
multimedia marvel as well. And with a bit of mucking around and tweaking, you 
can even watch videos from it on a big-screen TV.
This chapter gives you all the details about taking and viewing photos and 
videos with your Galaxy S5, viewing pictures and videos transferred to your S5 
from your computer, and viewing photos and videos from your phone on TVs 
and other monitors.
Opening the Gallery
THERE ARE SIX MAIN ways to get photos or videos into your Galaxy S5:
• Transferring them from your PC or Mac (see Chapter 13 for details).
• Taking them using the Galaxy S5’s built-in camera.

• Downloading them from the Web.
• Getting them in email attachments.
• Using Google’s Picasa app.
• Using the Dropbox cloud-based file storage service.
No matter how you get them, though, you view them the same way, by using 
the Gallery app. Here’s how:
1.	In the Apps screen, tap the Gallery icon. The Gallery app launches. You’ll 
see photos organized by individual albums. Even if you haven’t yet taken 
a single photo with your S5 (or transferred any), you may still find albums 
there, because the S5 automatically imports photos from Google’s Picasa 
photo service and the Dropbox cloud-based file-storage service. So if you’ve 
used those services, you’ve got photos.
When you first run Gallery, it organizes your photos by album. But you can 
view them in other ways as well. To change your view, tap the three horizon­
tal lines next to Albums and choose how they’re organized. The Gallery has a 
lot of smarts built into it, because it can automatically show you just photos 
of people, scenery, pets, vehicles, and so on
 TIP 	 If you use photos a lot, drag the Gallery icon to your Home screen (page 32).

2.	Tap any of the albums. The screen fills with thumbnails of photos in the 
album. You can view the thumbnails, as well as entire albums and individual 
photos, either vertically or horizontally. Just turn the phone in the direction 
you wish to view them.
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 5
3.	Tap the photo you want to view.
The phone displays the photo on its big, beautiful screen. Now you can see 
why you wanted the Galaxy S5—that extra screen real estate pays off when 
viewing photos.
A variety of buttons appear onscreen for a moment or two, and then disap­
pear. Tap the photo to make them appear again.
 NOTE 	 Depending on the photo’s length-to-width ratio, it may not fill the entire 
screen. If it doesn’t, you’ll see black space along the sides or at the top and bottom.
4.	Tap the arrow button at the top left  and you move up a level in the 
Gallery. Keep tapping the arrow on subsequent screens to get all the way to 
the top. The button to its right lets you show pictures from the gallery onto 
another device on your network. Tap the button and choose from any com­
patible devices. Tap the Share button 
 and you share your photos in many 
different ways, from email to text messaging, via Bluetooth, using social 
media, and more. The exact ways you can share will vary according to what 
apps you’ve got on your S5.

The next button is a trash icon and will delete the photo. Next comes the 
Camera button 
. Tap it to launch the camera to take photos or videos. 
(You’ll learn how to do both later in this chapter.) The final button, the menu 
button , has a whole lot of features—so many that there’s an entire section 
devoted to it. Go to page 123 for details.

Look down at the bottom of the screen when the icons appear on the photo. 
You’ll see thumbnails of all the photos in the album you’re viewing. Tap any 
thumbnail, and you’ll jump straight to that photo.
Viewing Pictures
Now that you’ve got photos on your screen, the fun begins—viewing them in dif­
ferent ways and flicking through them:
• Zooming means magnifying a photo, and you’ve got the power to do that 
at your fingertips—literally. Double-tap any part of the photo, and you zoom 
in on that area; double-tap again and you zoom out. You can also use the 
thumb-and-forefinger spread technique to zoom in more precise incre­
ments. Once you’ve zoomed in this way, you can zoom back out by using the 
two-finger pinch technique. (Flip back to page 34 for a refresher on all these 
techniques.)
• Panning means to move the photo around the screen after you’ve zoomed 
in, so you can see different areas. Use your finger to drag the photo around. 
As with zooming, panning works the same whether you’re holding the phone 
horizontally or vertically.

121
    
• Rotating means to turn your phone 90 degrees so it’s sideways. When you 
do so, the photo rotates and fills the screen using the new orientation. This 
technique is especially useful when you have a horizontal photo that looks 
small when your S5 is in its normal vertical position. Rotate the phone and, 
like magic, the picture rotates and fills the screen properly. Similarly, if you’re 
viewing a vertical picture while holding the phone horizontally, simply rotate 
the phone 90 degrees, and your photo rotates as well.
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 5
• Flicking advances you to the next or previous photo in your list. Flick from 
right to left to view the next photo, and from left to right to view the previ­
ous one.
Tagging Faces in Photos
ONE OF THE NIFTIEST things you can do on social media sites such as 
Facebook is to share tagged photos of yourself, family, and friends. It’s a great 
way to share. In any photos on the S5 with pictures of people’s faces, you can 
identify the people in the photo by name—that is, tag them. Then, when you 
put the photo up on a social media site, people can see the names of the people 
in the photos. More amazingly, people who’ve been tagged in the photos get a 
notification that a tagged photo of them is available, and they can then view it.
Tagging photos is easy, but first you have to turn the feature on. In the Gallery, 
whether you’re looking at an individual photo or an album, tap the Menu button 
and select Settings. At the bottom of the screen, tap the box next to “Face tag” 
so it turns green. Now open a photo as you would normally, and then tap it. 
Boxes appear around the faces of every person in the photo. The S5 will then do 
some photo magic and automatically tag any people whose faces it knows—for 
example, you. For other faces, tap “Add name” and then follow the onscreen 
instructions for tagging the person.
That’s all it takes. Now when you and your friends look at photos on your favor­
ite social media site, you’ll be able to remember who’s who.

chapter	 5
• Edit. Gives you a solid set of tools for editing photos, including dropping, 
rotating, changing colors, adding effects, and more. You can also add some 
cool effects—see the box on the next page.
• More info. Shows you all kinds of details about the photo. You’ll find the 
size, resolution, time it was taken, focal length, exposure time, and much 
more. The first screen you come to gives only the basics, such as the date 
the photo was taken, the location where it was taken, and any tags asso­
ciated with it. Tap Details at the bottom of the screen and prepare to be 
overwhelmed with more technical details about the photo than you’ve ever 
imagined.
• Copy to Clipboard. Does just what it says: Copies the entire photo to the 
Clipboard so you can paste it somewhere, like into an email.
• Rotate left. Rotates the photo 90 degrees to the left.
• Rotate right. Rotates the photo 90 degrees to the right.
• Crop. Lets you cut away part of the photo.
• Rename. Lets you give the photo a new, more descriptive name.
• Slideshow. Runs an onscreen slideshow of the photos in your current album 
or view. You can choose transitions between slides, choose music to accom­
pany the show, adjust how long each photo should display, and choose 
whether to show the oldest photo first or the newest one first.

Edit Away
The S5 gives you surprisingly power-
ful photo-editing tools right on the 
phone. They’re worth checking out. True, 
they’re not up to the level of a high-
powered, expensive piece of software 
like Photoshop, but you can’t beat free. 
And with each iteration of the software 
they’ve gotten more and more powerful, 
so if you’ve tried a previous version—or 
never tried them at all—you owe it to 
yourself to check out the tools you’ve 
got.
For a start, there’s a great auto-enhance 
feature that first appears when you open 
the editor. Just tap and it does its magic, 
adjusting the brightness, colors, and 
so on. If you’re looking for a no-muss, 
no-fuss way to fix your photos, auto-
enhance is a great place to start.
If you prefer digging right in and doing 
the work yourself, tap the X button at 
upper right. You can rotate, crop, and 
resize any photo. The Rotate tool is sur-
prisingly robust. Tap it and you can rotate 
the photo to the right or left, as well as 
flip it horizontally or vertically.
The Tone tool gives you eight ways to 
edit the color—adjusting the brightness, 
the contrast, the color saturation, and 
so on. And there are tools for adding 
special effects like sepia, grayscale, 
negative, fisheye, engraving, and more. 
The Portrait tool focuses on face fixes 
like removing red eye, brightening, and 
so on. You can even draw right on the 
image and add extras like stickers and 
frames.

• Set as. This nifty choice lets you do lots of things with the photo, such as 
setting it as your Home or Lock screen, or as a contact photo. Make your 
choice, and you can then crop the section of the photo you want to use. The 
S5 does the rest.
Working with Multiple Photos
IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION, you learned about ways to work with individual 
photos. But what if you want to work with multiple photos at once—delete them, 
share them, and so on? On the S5, it’s easy.
When you’re viewing photos in an album, by time, or other grouping, tap the 
Menu button and then tap Select. Double-headed arrows appear on each photo. 
Tap the photos you want to select—a green checkmark appears on them.
When you select photos, the top of the screen displays the number of photos 
you’ve selected. Tap that top box, and on the screen that appears you can select 
all the photos, or deselect them all. To deselect individual ones, tap the check­
mark, and it goes away.
Now you can perform actions on the photos you’ve selected. At the top of the 
screen are the usual buttons for sharing them and deleting them. You get many 
of the choices that you get when you are looking at an individual photo—see 
page 123 for details. But you also get a few others:

 NOTE 	 When you tap Details, you’ll see information about all the photos you’ve se­
lected, including how many items you’ve chosen and the dates of the first and last photos 
taken.
• Copy. Lets you copy them to a different album.
• Move to album. Lets you move them to a different album.
• Add to event. Adds the photos to an event.
• Studio. Launches the Studio app that lets you create collages, make video 
clips, trim videos, and more.
• Slideshow. Creates a slideshow out of the selected photos. You get to 
choose the transition effects, apply filters to the photos, and add music.
Videos in the Gallery
THE WAY YOU VIEW and work with videos in the Galaxy S5 is essentially iden­
tical to the way you work with photos, with a few minor differences:
• You can spot videos in the Gallery by the right-facing triangles on their 
thumbnails.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
128	
chapter	 5
• Rotate your S5 by 90 degrees when you’re viewing videos, since they’re 
usually taken with a horizontal orientation (as are the ones you shoot on your 
S5).
 NOTE 	 Do you, a friend, or a loved one suffer from “vertical video syndrome”? This fic­
titious disease afflicts people who hold their phones vertically when taking videos, which 
means they will look small and squashed when played the way videos are supposed to be 
viewed—in horizontal orientation, like on a television or in a movie theater. In June 2012, 
a tongue-in-cheek public service announcement was uploaded to YouTube warning about 
this threat. It’s received five million views!
• When you tap a video, it opens with a right-facing triangle—the Play but­
ton. Before you play the video, buttons appear at the top right of the screen 
to let you share the video with others, trim the video, and delete it. If you 
tap the Menu button, you’ll get a selection of options, including renaming 
it, creating a slideshow with it, getting details about it, and changing video 
settings.
 NOTE 	 When you tap the video, you may be asked which app you want to use to play 
it, depending on what apps you have installed on your S5.
• Tap the triangle to play the video. When the video starts plays, a circle 
moves along a progress bar to show where you are in the video. Drag the 
circle forward or back to move forward or back in the video. Tap the Pause 
button to pause the video; tap the Play button to start playing it again. You’ll 
also see the total time of the video, and how long the current video has 
played. You can also mute the video. There are also buttons for playing the 
video full screen and playing the video on another device, such as a TV. (For 
details about connecting your S5 to a TV, see page 136.) All the buttons and 
controls vanish after a few seconds; to bring them back, tap the video.
Here’s a handy video feature for multitaskers: Tap the video when it’s playing to 
bring up the player controls, and then tap the small icon on the lower-right side 
of the screen. The current video plays in a small screen inside the larger screen. 
That way you can use the Gallery to look at photos, for example, and keep 
watching the video. Tap the X on the mini video window to close it.

Taking Still Photos
IF YOU’RE USED TO no-frills smartphone cameras that do little more than let 
you point and shoot grainy, low-resolution photos, you’re in for a surprise with 
the Galaxy S5. It sports a 16-megapixel camera that takes sharp, vivid photos. 
And it also has a front-facing camera that takes photos at 2.1 megapixels. 
Although you’ll mainly use it for videochats, it’s also useful for taking selfies and 
the S5’s great Dual mode feature that lets you take a combined photo with both 
cameras simultaneously. (See the box on page 133 for details.)
www.it-ebooks.info

	
130	
chapter	 5
Fortunately, using the camera is still point-and-shoot simple. Tap the cam­
era icon on the Home screen or Apps screen. Frame your shot on the screen. 
You can use the camera either in the normal vertical orientation, or turn it 90 
degrees for a wider shot. Zoom in by spreading your fingers apart on the screen 
and zoom back out by pinching them together. Then tap the button on the right 
side of the screen to take the photograph.
 TIP 	 The camera also includes a handy onscreen zoom feature. To zoom in, pinch your 
fingers together; to zoom out, spread them apart.
You’ll hear the familiar snapping sound of a photo being taken. A small thumb­
nail of your new photo is displayed in the lower-left corner of the viewfinder. 
Tap it to view the big image. You can zoom in and out of the image by using the 
normal zoom in and zoom out finger motions.
 NOTE 	 When you’re not taking pictures, you can also get them onto your S5 by trans­
ferring them from your computer. See page 319.

• Switch camera toggles between the normal camera and the camera facing 
you. Use the camera facing you for a self-portrait (think of it as the “selfie” 
button) or during video chats.
• Shortcut can be customized, letting you put any of a number of modes and 
features from the Settings screen on it—for example, face detection or selec­
tive focus. The icon that appears here will change according to what mode 
or feature you’ve attached to it. Out of the box, it’s a shortcut to Selective 
focus, which lets you adjust the focus to make nearby objects stand out 
from the background. 
 NOTE 	 For selective focus to work, the focal object must be within 1.5 feet of you and 
at least three times that distance from the background. 
• Rich tone (HDR) is a special mode that lets you take multiple photos of the 
same image or scene, at different exposure levels, and then combine them to 
create a richer photo with a greater range of tones. It’s good for compensat­
ing for scenes that are underexposed or overexposed.
• Settings lets you choose from a variety of features and modes, includ­
ing picture stabilization, face detection, selective focus, and more. Tap the 
Settings button, and then tap the option you want to use. From this screen, 
you can also add any setting or mode to the Shortcut button—just drag the 
icon toward the top of the screen and place it on the Shortcut button.

• Light indicator and battery charge. If you’re in low-light conditions, a low-
light indicator appears. A battery icon shows you your current battery level. 
Typically, if the low-light indicator is on, you won’t see the battery icon.
• Still/Video lets you choose either the still camera or the video camera.
• Shutter snaps the picture.
• Mode lets you select from many different modes of taking photos—for 
sports photos, night photos, panoramas, and more. (For details, see the next 
section.)
• Show Photo shows a strip of other photos you’ve taken. Tap any to open it.
Challenge to a Dual Shot
The Galaxy S5 lets you take photos of 
images with your front and back cameras 
simultaneously. Think of the interest-
ing effects you can come up with—a 
picture of the band onstage juxtaposed 
with your own rapt reaction. A picture 
of the summit that includes you in 
your climbing gear. Imagine a kind of 
postcard effect, with a scenic vista as the 
background (taken with the camera you 
normally use to take photos), and then 
an image from the front-facing camera 
as a stamp.
To use it, select Auto mode and tap 
the Dual Shot icon—it’s an overlapping 
image of the front and back of the cam-
era symbol. You can play around with 
choosing borders other than a stamp for 
the image you take with the front-facing 
camera. To do so, tap the arrow at the 
bottom of the screen and choose which 
one you want to use.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Using Different Modes
THE CAMERA’S PRESET SHOOTING modes represent one of its most power­
ful features. They automatically take the best pictures for what you’re currently 
shooting. Tap the Mode button to see them all. To use them, just follow the 
onscreen directions. Make sure to play around with them, because you get a 
number of amazing ones.
• Auto mode chooses what the camera thinks are the best settings for the cur­
rent conditions. For example, on a bright, sunny day, it will adjust to prevent 
the picture from getting washed out.

chapter	 5
• Beauty face takes a photo using an airbrushed effect that smooths over 
what Samsung believes to be facial imperfections. It may not work if the 
image is too dark.
• Shot and more is actually a misnomer — it should be called something like 
“burst mode features.” It puts the camera into burst mode, where it takes 
a series of photos of a scene automatically one after another and then lets 
you take a variety of actions on those five photos. For example, the Drama 
feature creates a truly striking effect. It lets you take a series of photos of 
a moving subject and then merges them into a single shot with multiple 
images showing the movement over time. Or you can select the best one 
and have the rest of the photos deleted. (For more advice on using Drama 
mode, see the box on the next page.)
• Panorama mode lets you stitch together a panorama from multiple photos 
so that you’ll literally get the big picture.
• Virtual tour does what the name says: Lets you take multiple photos and 
stitch them together to create a virtual tour.
• Dual camera lets you take photos with your front and back cameras simulta­
neously. See the box on page 133 for details.
• Download lets you download even more modes to use on your camera, such 
as “Sound & shot” mode, which lets you add a few seconds of background 
sound to a picture, and Sports mode for taking pictures of fast movements, 
so that rather than showing a blur of motion, your photos will be crisp. 
(You’ll need to sign into your Samsung account before downloading.)

Drama Mode
Drama mode, one of the “Shots and 
more” options, is a bit hard to describe, 
but once you get the hang of it, you 
may get hooked. Turn it on, and the 
S5’s camera takes a continuous set 
of frames of a location for about 5 
seconds—for example, your daughter 
doing a handstand. The S5 detects the 
person moving in the photos and stitches 
together multiple pictures of the person 
against the static background, so you see 
the person’s movements over time in a 
single photo. Sort of a time-lapse effect.
To get the best results with Drama mode, 
you need to make sure that the person 
in the frame isn’t too large or too small, 
and that she doesn’t move too slowly or 
too quickly. But it should take you only a 
few minutes to get it right. Once you do, 
you may never stop playing with it.

Taking Video
TO TAKE THE VIDEO, tap the camera/video button at upper right. The video 
immediately starts recording. At the upper left, a red button with the word REC 
appears, and a number next to it tells you how much time in your video-taking 
has elapsed. At the upper right, a number tells you how much memory the video 
is taking up as you shoot.

The Pause button lets you discontinue recording. You can zoom in and out in 
the same way that you can with the still camera, by pinching or spreading your 
fingers, or using the volume buttons.
 NOTE 	 If you want to change video options, such as using a video stabilizer, you can’t 
do it from video mode. Instead, you have to switch back to the still camera and select 
your options, as outlined on page 132.
Playing S5 Video on Your TV
THE S5 INCLUDES A somewhat secret feature that you might find extremely 
useful: You can play video from it on your TV. And it’s not just video you can 
play there. You can also display photos on your TV and even play games on your 
S5 and see them on your TV. In fact, anything that you see on your S5, you can 
send over to your TV.
To do it, you rig up a way to connect your S5 to a TV. Alternatively, if you have a 
Samsung TV, you may be able to connect wirelessly.
Connecting to the TV by Cable
First, you need to buy a special cable from Samsung, an HDTV HDMI adapter. 
(You can get it from Amazon at this URL: http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-
MHL-2-0-HDTV-Adapter/dp/B00BTCPQ5C. To buy it elsewhere, just look for

Samsung’s part number ET-H10FAUWEGWW.) Then buy an HDMI cord, available 
from any electronics store or online. Now follow these steps:
1.	Plug one end of the HDMI cord into the HDTV HDMI adapter. (Only one end 
of the adapter fits.)
2.	Plug the other end of the HDMI cable into your TV.
3.	If you want your S5 to get external power while you’re using it with your 
TV, connect your S5’s power charger to the HDTV HDMI adapter, and then 
connect the power charger to a power source. (Note: This step isn’t required, 
but it’ll prevent losing power in the middle of watching a long video.)
4.	Plug the HDTV HDMI adapter into the port where you normally plug your 
power charger—at the bottom of the S5.
5.	On your TV, switch the input to the HDMI port where you’ve just plugged in 
the HDTV HDMI adapter. You should now see whatever is on your S5 mir­
rored onto your TV.
This method generally provides better audio quality than a wireless connection, 
and you also won’t tend to experience laggy video. On the other hand, your S5 
will have to be near enough to your TV so the wires reach.
Connecting to a Samsung TV Wirelessly
This method works only if you have a specific kind of Samsung TV—called a 
Smart TV. Even then, setting up a wireless connection is a bit dicier. In theory, 
you merely need to change a setting on your S5 and, like magic, its screen gets 
mirrored to your nearby TV. But practice rarely works as well as theory. Suffice it 
to say that you shouldn’t go buy a Smart TV just for this one purpose. And if you 
do, double-check the documentation to ensure that it will work.
Say you do have the right Samsung TV. On the S5, tap Settings from the Apps 
screen, scroll to the Connect and Share section, and tap Screen Mirroring. Make 
sure it is turned on. When you turn it on, your S5 automatically looks around, 
searching for a device that will let it do screen mirroring. Your TV will show up 
on the list. Tap it and you’ll be mirroring what’s on your S5 onto your TV.
Using Your S5 as a Universal Remote
THERE’S ONE MORE PIECE of TV magic your S5 can perform—you can use it 
as a universal remote to control your TV, streaming music player, and more. It’s 
not always easy to do, and it may not work at all, but it’s worth a shot.

To do it, tap the Smart Remote icon in the Apps screen. You’ll go through a series 
of setup screens: choosing your country and Zip code, personalizing the kinds of 
content you like to watch, and so on. It takes only a minute or two.
Now that you’ve done that, it’s time to pair your S5 with your TV and cable box. 
Tap the remote icon in the top right and select your TV brand. Then tap the 
onscreen power button to check whether the remote works with your TV. If it 
does, tap Yes. If not, tap No, and you’ll test the next potential code for connect­
ing the Smart Remote to your TV.

If no codes work, you’re out of luck. However, if you manage to make the con­
nection to your TV, you may be able to select the manufacturer of your set-top 
box. You’ll go through the same procedure as you did for connecting to your TV. 
If it works, you’ll not only be able to use it as a remote, but take advantage of 
extra features as well. For example, you can use the Smart Remote guide rather 
than your TV guide for finding what you want to watch, you can stream from 
your Netflix account, and plenty more.

WHAT’S THE MOST-USED SMARTPHONE feature these days? Quite possibly 
maps and navigation. And they can do much more than show you where you are 
or how to drive to your next destination. They can help you find a great nearby 
restaurant, pull up the fastest route to your friend’s house via public transporta­
tion, show you which highways are clogged with traffic, and more.
Google Maps
GOOGLE MAPS ON THE Galaxy S5 is the mobile version of the renowned 
Google Maps website (http://maps.google.com). In fact, the S5’s Maps app 
is even more powerful than the web version, since it can incorporate GPS 
information.
Type any address or point of interest in the U.S.—or in many places all over 
the world—and you see a map. You can choose a street map, an aerial satellite 
photo, or a combination of the two (more on that on page 143).
But don’t settle for looking around. You can also find nearby businesses, points 
of interest, and traffic congestion. Maps also offers turn-by-turn directions, 
even including public transportation in some cities. There are even bike-friendly 
maps.

Browsing Google Maps
Tap the Maps icon on a pane or in the Apps screen, and Google Maps launches. 
At first launch, if it finds your location, it will show a map of your neighborhood, 
with a pointer to your location. If it can’t find you, you’ll likely see a map of the 
United States, but you can work your way down to street level.
Navigate the map by dragging or flicking. Rotate the map’s orientation by put­
ting your thumb and second or third finger on the map and twisting. Zoom in 
by spreading your thumb and your second or third finger or tapping twice with 
a finger. Zoom out by pinching your fingers or by tapping the screen once with 
two fingers (the amazing two-finger tap).
 NOTE 	 If you’ve turned on GPS (page 19), instead of displaying a map of the United 
States, Google Maps locates you and displays a map of your current location.
As you zoom in on the map, you’ll see locations of interest—museums, libraries, 
schools, parks, restaurants, and so on. Tap any, and a balloon appears over it, 
and at the bottom of the screen you see information about it, including ratings 
if people have reviewed it. There’s also an icon of a car that you can tap to get 
driving directions to it.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Maps and Navigation 	
143
Tap the balloon or the description at the bottom of the screen, and you get a lot 
more details, including a Street View photo of the location (if available), photos 
people have taken, and more. You can also call the establishment, read (and 
write) reviews, get directions, search for nearby businesses, and so on. For even 
more details, swipe up from the bottom of the screen, and a screen full of infor­
mation about the location appears over the map. Swipe back down to return to 
the map.
 NOTE 	 Google frequently updates its Maps app. The Maps app described here is the 
latest version as of the writing of this book. So if you have an older or newer version of 
Maps, it may vary from what you see here.
Changing Your View
Just being able to zoom in and out of a map down to the street level, or all 
the way out to the continent level, is pretty cool, but you have still more view 
options, which Google Maps calls layers. A layer is a specific type of view, or 
information superimposed over a view. To change a view to a different layer, 
look down at the bottom left of the screen for a small vertical rectangle with 
three lines inside it. Swipe that rectangle to the right. A menu swoops in from 
the left that shows you a bunch of choices, including a satellite view, a real-time 
traffic map, a link to Google Earth (more on that on page 147) and so on. Your 
current view will be highlighted with a dark band. To switch to any other view, 
tap it.
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 6
    
 NOTE 	 In some views, such as the terrain view, you’ll see a virtual compass needle at 
the top of the screen, showing you north, so you’ll never lose your orientation no matter 
how bad your sense of direction.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Maps and Navigation 	
145
The satellite view, unsurprisingly, is an actual satellite photo of the location. 
Layered on top of it is the normal Google map, making it easy to see streets, 
street names, and landmarks. As you zoom in, the photo may at first appear 
blurry, and it may take a little while for the image to resolve itself, so be patient.
    
 NOTE 	 The layers on Google Maps sometimes change, as Google adds new information, 
and as it makes deals with other companies to add their layers. So check layers often to 
see what new things Google has in store.
Traffic
The map can show you how bad the traffic is on highways and major metro­
politan thoroughfares. Turn on the Traffic layer and, where available, the app 
indicates traffic congestion with the following color coding:
• Green means the traffic is flowing very nicely—at least 50 miles per hour.
• Yellow indicates slower-moving traffic, between 25 and 50 miles per hour.
• Red means a traffic jam; avoid it if you can. It means that traffic is moving at 
less than 25 miles per hour.
Make sure to look for icons on the map, such as a symbol of a man at work, or of 
a car accident. Tap any of the symbols, and you get more information about it.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
146	
chapter	 6
 NOTE 	 You can help Google get more accurate information about traffic in your area. 
Before you start driving, turn on GPS. That way, your phone sends information about your 
location and driving speed (anonymously) to Google, which then uses it to help figure out 
the current traffic conditions.

Google Earth
For a truly awesome piece of mapping technology, check out the Google Earth 
layer. Google Earth lets you fly over anywhere on the planet in full, realistic 
3D. It uses satellite photography, so you can virtually visit realistic pictures of 
anywhere on earth. Want to visit the Colosseum in Rome, the Grand Canyon 
in Arizona, the Taj Mahal in India? You can do that and more. It also integrates 
with Google Maps so that you can overlay street names on top of satellite maps. 
There are even built-in “tour guides” to take you on tours of many places on 
earth. Make sure to look at the bottom of the screen for a small tab. If it’s there, 
pull it up. You’ll see photos of interesting places to visit. Tap any to see a video 
tour of it.
 NOTE 	 Google Earth is a companion app to Google Maps and may not be preinstalled 
on your S5. If it’s not, then the first time you tap that layer to use it, you’ll be sent to 
Google Play to download and install it.

Street View
Street View is a full, 360-degree panoramic, photographic view of streets and 
an entire area—an entire city, if you like. Street View is a great way to plan, 
for example, a walking tour of downtown Boston. (Make sure to visit the State 
House and its golden dome on top of Beacon Hill if you head there.)
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Maps and Navigation 	
149
To use Street View, hold your finger on any location on a map, until the address 
appears at the bottom of the screen. Pull up the location from the bottom and 
select Street View. Once you’re in Street View, drag and flick to move around to 
change your view, or explore nearby streets. 
More Layers
As Google updates Maps, it continually adds (and sometimes takes away) layers, 
so you’ll find plenty of layers to try out. Transit Lines shows public transporta­
tion on the map, and Bicycling shows bike paths.
Layers also change depending on how you use Google Maps. If you use Google 
Maps to find businesses (see page 152), it puts listings of businesses you’ve 
viewed online in layers. And if you’ve searched maps, it lists those searches as 
well, so you can quickly relaunch the search directly from layers.
The Compass Button
See that compass button on the bottom-right corner of the screen? It’s a magic 
find-me button. If you’re looking at a map that isn’t your current location—for 
example, if you’re in Boston and you’re looking at a map of San Francisco—just 
tap the compass, and it shows a map of your current location, with an indicator 
in the center of the map showing where you are. So if you’re viewing a map of 
a place halfway across the world, you can always tap this button to go to your 
current location.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
150	
chapter	 6
For even more magic, if you’re already looking at a map of your current location 
and tap the compass, it becomes a live compass so you can see the direction in 
which you’re viewing your map. Not only that, but you can also tilt your Galaxy 
S5, and the map orientation follows the direction of the tilt.
How the Galaxy S5 Finds Your Location
Google Maps’ usefulness really comes into play when it’s combined with the S5’s 
ability to find your location. The phone finds where you are in one of three ways:
• GPS. The S5’s built-in GPS chip works just like the one in a Garmin or 
TomTom, although it’s not quite as accurate. (Hey, those devices do only 
GPS, not phone calls or games, so cut your phone some slack.) GPS works 
best when you have a good view of the sky. If not, the S5 switches to one of 
the other two location methods.
• WiFi positioning. The phone’s WiFi chip can do more than just connect you 
to a WiFi network—it can also help determine your location. It does this by 
using information (from a large database) about WiFi networks near you. 
Then, using the information about the WiFi locations and your distance from 
them, it calculates your location. It’s not as accurate as GPS, but it still works 
pretty well.
• Cellular triangulation. If GPS or WiFi positioning doesn’t do the trick, then 
the S5 calculates your location based on how close you are to various cell­
phone towers near you. It’s not as accurate as GPS or WiFi positioning, but 
it’s nice as a backup.
 TIP 	 GPS and WiFi can use up a lot of juice from your battery. When you don’t need 
them, turn them off.
Now that you know how the Galaxy S5 finds you, it’s time to tell it to do its 
tricks.
You’ll need to tell the S5 to find your location if you’re going to use any of its 
location-based services, such as giving you turn-by-turn directions. Doing it is 
simplicity itself: As explained earlier, tap the compass button in the lower right. 
Google displays a blinking blue arrow to show your location.
 NOTE 	 If the Galaxy S5 is not exactly sure about your precise location, it draws a blue 
circle around the blinking arrow, to show that you may be anywhere inside that location. 
The larger the circle, the less certainty Google has about your location.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Maps and Navigation 	
151
As you walk, drive, bicycle, or move in some other way, the blue arrow moves as 
well. The arrow changes direction to show the direction in which you’re moving.
Searching Maps
Google Maps makes it easy for you to search for a business or other location. 
Given that Google is the premier search site on the Internet, would you expect 
anything less?
To search, tap the Search button at the top of the screen, and then type your 
search term into the search box that appears at the top. When Maps finds what 
you’re looking for, it displays the location and shows a little pushpin in it.
There are countless ways to search the maps. Here are some of the most 
common:
• Address. Just type an address, including the state or Zip code. Don’t bother 
with commas, and most of the time you can skip periods as well. You can use 
common abbreviations. So, if you type 157 w 57 ny ny, you’ll do a search for 
157 West 57th Street, New York City, New York.
• Intersection. Type, for example, massachusetts ave and cogswell cam­
bridge ma, and Google Maps displays the location at the intersection of 
Massachusetts Avenue and Cogswell Avenue in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
• City. Type, say, san francisco ca, and you’ll see that city.
• Zip code. Type any Zip code, such as 02140.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
152	
chapter	 6
 NOTE 	 As you enter search terms, Google Maps displays a likely list of matching results. 
You can speed up entering your search by choosing from the right search term when it 
appears, rather than tapping in the entire address.
• Point of interest. Type central park, boston common frog pond, or washing­
ton monument, for example.
    
• Airport code. If you know the three-letter code, you can type, for example, 
sfo for the San Francisco International Airport, or bos for Boston’s Logan 
Airport.
When Maps finds the location, it marks it with a pushpin and shows the address 
at the bottom of the screen. Pull the address up from the bottom of the screen 
to get more details about it.
Finding Businesses and Contacts
GOOGLE MAPS CAN EASILY find local businesses. Any business that you 
can find with a Google search, Maps can find, too. But Maps can also find the 
home and business addresses of your friends, which it does by tying into your 
Contacts list.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Maps and Navigation 	
153
If you want to search for a business near your current location or any other 
place, first navigate to the area where you’re looking for businesses. Then do 
a search for the kind of business you’re looking for—restaurants, for example. 
What happens next depends on your search results. You may see icons repre­
senting all the businesses matching your search. And it also may put a pin on the 
one closest to you, with details about it at the bottom of the screen. You may 
see details about a single result, with a small series of vertical lines next to the 
search term in the search box. Or the screen may go gray, with a single white 
circle, and the text “Tap here to see a list of your search results.”
To see a list of all matching searches—again, in this example, restaurants—tap 
the white button, or else tap the series of vertical lines in the search box. You’ll 
see a listing of all matching businesses, including ratings and recommenda­
tions from various services or customers of those various services such as Zagat 
(which Google happens to own). To get more information about any business, 
tap the listing. Information appears at the bottom of the Maps screen. Pull that 
information up, and you’ll see complete details about the business.
 NOTE 	 You may notice that when you search for a business, ads sometimes appear 
in various locations—for example, at the top of the screen that gives you a business’s 
details. That’s one of the ways Google makes money—by selling ads related to your map 
searches.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
154	
chapter	 6
    
Which details you get vary according to what the business is and what informa­
tion Google has about it. For restaurants and other businesses that have been 
reviewed by Zagat, for example, you’ll get a detailed review. For a restaurant, 
you’ll also see an overall rating; cost; and category ratings for food, decor, and 
service. There may be photos of the restaurant, and you can also upload photos 
yourself.
All businesses have three buttons associated with them: Call, Save, and Share. 
Tapping Call takes you to the S5’s phone app and places the call. Tap Save, and 
the Save star turns gold. You also see the star on the map, in gold. From that 
point on, whenever you’re using Maps, you’ll see the gold stars of all businesses 
you want to visit again, right onscreen. Tap the star, and you see the descrip­
tion of the business in the usual way. To take away the star, when you’re view­
ing its description, tap the gold star to turn it back to blue. Tap Share, and you 
can share information about the business via email, Bluetooth, chat, and other 
means. Next to the name of the business, you’ll see an icon of a car. Tap it, and 
you get turn-by-turn directions to the business by foot, car, bicycle, or public 
transportation.
Locating the address of your friend’s home or business is easy. You can do 
it, though, only if the address is in your Contacts list. In Maps, search for the 
friend’s name. If you have an address for the friend, it appears in the search 
results. Tap it, and you’ll see the location on a map.
www.it-ebooks.info

You can also do it straight from the Contacts list. Find the person in your 
Contacts list (see page 75 for details). Next to the person’s address or 
addresses, you see a small pushpin icon. Tap the pushpin to go to the location 
on Google Maps, complete with another pushpin.
Getting Directions
YOU’VE HEARD THE OLD cliché: Ask a Maine resident for directions, and the 
answer is inevitably, “Can’t get there from here.” Fortunately, Google Maps is 
much more helpful. Ask it the same question, and you get to choose how you 
want to get there: driving, walking, biking, or public transportation. Google pro­
vides directions for all four, or as many as it can find. (Not all types of directions 
are available to all places, but you’ll have more choices in major metropolitan 
areas.)
You can get directions in many places throughout Maps, and throughout the 
Galaxy S5, because that capability is embedded very deep in the phone. So 
expect to find directions in many different places; for example, when you search 
for a business, find the location, and look at the page that gives you information 
about the business.
One surefire way to get directions anywhere in Maps: Tap the Directions icon 
just to the right of the search box at the top of Google Maps. A screen appears 
with a starting point, possible destination points, and icons for finding directions 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
156	
chapter	 6
via car, public transportation, bicycle, and on foot. You’ll also see a list of places 
you’ve just been to or searched for.
If the S5 knows your current location, it uses that as the starting point and 
puts the words “My Location” in the starting point box. If you want a different 
starting point, tap My Location and then type an address into the text box that 
appears.
Next, choose your destination. Either choose from the list of recent searches 
and locations or tap “Choose destination” and type where you want to go. Once 
you’ve set the starting point and destination, you’re ready to go. Tap which kind 
of directions you want. Next you’ll see one of two things, either a map with the 
directions in blue, or else a list of various options for getting there, each showing 
the amount of time it will take, the distance in miles, whether there’s traffic, and 
the main routes you’ll use. To choose one of the routes, tap it. You’ll see a map 
with the directions laid out. Pull up the directions from the bottom of the screen 
to see the turn-by-turn directions. This example uses driving directions, but the 
other types of directions work much the same way. You can scroll through the 
entire list of directions. To zoom in on a specific section of the route, tap it on 
the direction list.
Tap the arrow buttons to get to the previous or next driving instructions. You 
can also return to your master list of instructions by tapping the S5’s Back but­
ton. In this way, you can switch back and forth between your overall directions 
and your current one. When you’re looking at the list of overall directions, tap 
any instruction, and you’ll see a closeup of the directions on the map.

Turn-by-Turn Navigation
GETTING TURN-BY-TURN DIRECTIONS IS helpful, but the Galaxy S5 offers 
something even more powerful—turn-by-turn navigation, just like the GPS giz­
mos made by Garmin and TomTom.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
158	
chapter	 6
To use it, when you’ve typed in your location and final destination and are on the 
screen showing you the map view of your directions, tap the Start button at the 
bottom right of the screen (or, in the Apps screen, select Navigation).
You’ve turned your phone into a full-blown GPS navigator, complete with the 
usual annoying robot-like female voice. But it does the job. It tracks your loca­
tion as you drive and displays it on a map. When you’re approaching a turn, it 
tells you what to do ahead of time. It shows you all the information you need, 
including distance to your next turn, current location, time to your destination, 
and more. So forget buying that $300 GPS unit—it’s built right into the S5.
 NOTE 	 The turn-by-turn navigator requires your GPS to be turned on. You don’t need 
your GPS turned on if you want to get normal directions on Google Maps, though.
Turn-by-turn navigation includes lots of other nice features. Want to avoid 
highways or avoid tolls when you drive? Press the Menu key while you’re in the 
Navigation app and select Options. You can choose to avoid either or both.

You’ll learn to:
• Use different calendar views
• Create new appointments
• Accept an invitation
• Use multiple calendars
• Sync your calendar with 
Outlook
www.it-ebooks.info

OF ALL THE WAYS you can use your Galaxy S5 to keep track of your life, the 
calendar may be the most important. Need to remember the meeting this 
afternoon, the dinner date tonight, the tennis game tomorrow morning? Forget 
paper-based calendars—the S5 puts them to shame.
Better still, the Galaxy S5’s calendar is actually Google’s Calendar, so whether 
you’re looking at your calendar on your phone or on your PC, you see the exact 
same thing, because the S5 syncs with Google Calendar. So no matter where 
you are, you know where you need to be today, tomorrow, and beyond.
Using the Calendar
TO RUN THE CALENDAR, tap the calendar icon in the Apps screen...well, things 
aren’t quite that easy. The S5 comes with two calendar apps. One is the true-
blue Google Calendar, and that’s the calendar you’ll read about in this chapter. 
The other, with a green icon, is a calendar from Samsung. The Samsung calendar 
can sync with Google Calendar, so they can work together. (For more informa­
tion on the differences between the two calendar apps, see the box on page 
163.)

When you tap the calendar, it immediately opens. You’re looking at events 
from Google Calendar, so if you’re already using Google Calendar, you see your 
appointments instantly. If you’ve never used Google Calendar, you see a blank 
calendar.
You should see the most up-to-date calendar information on your S5, because it 
syncs with Google Calendar on the Web. Syncing means that not only will your 
S5 calendar grab the latest information from your Google Calendar on the Web, 
but when you make any changes to your calendar on the S5, Google Calendar 
gets updated with that information as well.
If you have more than one calendar in Google Calendar, you can see information 
from all calendars in one unified view.
 NOTE 	 When you first set up your phone, you either chose to set it up with an existing 
Google account or create a new one. If you set it up with an existing account, your Galaxy 
S5 calendar automatically syncs with your existing Google Calendar and displays all its 
events. If you created a new account, you start with a blank Google Calendar.
Calendar Views
There are four different ways you can look at your calendar, all within easy 
reach: Day, Week, Month, and Agenda. To get to any of them, tap the triangle to 
the right of the date on the top left of the screen.

Google Calendar vs. Samsung Calendar
On your S5, you’ve got a choice of which 
calendar to use, the Samsung Calendar 
or Google Calendar. This book strongly 
recommends going with Google, for 
several reasons. Perhaps most important 
is the fact that Google Calendar has 
become a standard for working with 
others, and using the same calendar that 
coworkers, family, and friends use is a 
big plus. Although the two calendars 
sync automatically, there’s a lag when 
you use the Samsung Calendar rather 
than the Google Calendar, which could 
prove problematic if you need to update 
your events with others quickly.
In addition, Google Calendar is designed 
to work with all of Google’s services—not 
just today’s services, but tomorrow’s as 
well. There’s no guarantee how well the 
Samsung Calendar will work with all of 
Google’s services, including future ones.
Google Calendar is one of Google’s 
most important services, and so Google 
spends plenty of time adding new 
features. But calendaring is far from 
being one of Samsung’s most impor-
tant services, so it’s not as likely that 
Samsung will update it as frequently as 
Google updates its calendar.
One final note: Google Calendar may not 
be on your S5 when you first run it. Each 
cellphone provider decides which apps 
go on and which don’t. So if it’s not on 
yours, head to Google Play and download 
it.

• Week. Here you get a weekly view. Swipe left or right to see the next week 
or previous week, and flick up and down to see later or earlier in the day.
• Month. This view shows you the entire current month. Horizontal colored 
bars indicate appointments and events, and show you their duration. Flick up 
and down to see the next or previous month.
• Agenda. This scrolling view displays a list of all your events and appoint­
ments, not just for today or this week or next month, but years into the 
future, and years back in the past. It’s a great way to see what’s on the hori­
zon or to get an overview of where your time is going. Scroll through them 
all by flicking. To see the details of any event or appointment, tap it, and the 
appointment opens.

Making an Appointment
There are two ways to create an appointment (which Calendar calls an event):
• In Month, Week, or Day view, hold your finger on the time you want to make 
an appointment. Then tap “New event” and follow the instructions.

 NOTE 	 When you run the Galaxy S5 calendar, you’re not actually looking at Google 
Calendar on the Web. Instead, the Galaxy S5 calendar syncs with Google Calendar on the 
Web, but holds the information in the Galaxy S5 itself. So if you’re in an area without 
reception, and you’ve previously updated Google Calendar on the Web but not yet synced 
it to your phone’s calendar, the S5 calendar won’t have any information you added since 
the last sync.
• In any view, tap the small button with three dots on the upper right of the 
screen, and tap “New event.”
In some instances, like when you create a new event from the Month view, you 
only need to fill in a name. In other instances, like when you create a new event 
from the Day view, a much more detailed form pops up, with plenty of informa­
tion to fill in:
• Event name. Type a name for the event.
• Location. Tap here and enter the location for the event. As you type, 
Calendar looks in your address book for places that match the location as 
you’re typing. That way you don’t have to type an entire address. Type part 
of it, and then pick from the list.
• From and To. Tap this to choose the starting and ending times.
• Time Zone. Choose your time zone.

• Guests. Type in the name or names of the people you’re inviting. As you 
type, the Calendar looks in your Contacts to find matching names. Select 
any that match to cut down on your typing.
• Description. What will you be doing? Having lunch? Meeting with your 
accountant? Skydiving? Tap in a description. If you’re inviting other people, 
keep in mind that the invitation will be sent to them, so make the description 
clear (and keep it clean).

• Repetition. Will this be a one-time event or one that repeats? If it repeats, 
the calendar gives you a lot of flexibility about how to choose that. You can 
choose an event to repeat every day at the same time, every weekday at that 
time, once a week at that time and day of the week, monthly, or even yearly 
on that date. And there are more options as well.
• Reminders. After you create the event, the S5 can flash reminders before 
the event, letting you know that it’s about to happen. You can choose how 
far in advance to send the reminder, in any increment you want. Create as 
many reminders as you like by tapping the “Add reminder” button and filling 
in the details.
When you set a reminder time, you get a notification in the Notification 
panel when the time comes. Tap it to see the full reminder details. You can 
then Snooze the reminder so it’ll disappear, and then pop up later according 
to what interval you’ve set. Or you can dismiss it, which means it will vanish 
forever, never to be heard from again.
To get even more event details, tap the reminder, and you see who orga­
nized the appointment, who will be attending, the time, and the reminder 
interval. You can also accept the invitation, decline it, or tentatively accept it.

• Show me as. This option lets you choose whether you appear to be avail­
able or not, if someone else wants to schedule you for an event held at the 
same time. Unless you change the default setting, the calendar assumes that 
you’re not available—after all, you’re already attending an event. But you can 
choose to make yourself available. For example, you may want to schedule 
an event for yourself tentatively but be willing to change it in case someone 
needs to schedule an important appointment with you.
• Privacy. Sometimes, you want others to see an event you put on your calen­
dar (“Board meeting”), and other times you won’t want them to see it (“Dog 
grooming”). This option lets you make the event private, so only you can see 
it, or public, so others in the group calendar can see it.
Now you’re ready to save your event. But there’s one more thing you can do—
color-code it. Tap the small icon of the palette near the top of the screen and. 
from the colors that appear, choose one.
When you’ve done all that—and don’t worry, it goes a lot faster than it sounds—
tap the Save button. Your event now shows up on your calendar.
 NOTE 	 For more information about using a group calendar and how to set all its op­
tions, head to your Google Calendar on the Web: www.google.com/calendar.

chapter	 7
Getting Notifications about Who Has Accepted
If the appointment you created includes someone else—a dinner companion, 
let’s say—he gets an email, and either accepts the invitation or not. You don’t 
need to do anything to send the email; it gets sent automatically. (All of life 
should be so easy.) Once someone has accepted, you get a notification, and the 
acceptance is noted in the calendar.
Editing, Rescheduling, and Deleting Events
To look at one of your appointments, tap it. You see a summary of the appoint­
ment, including the date and time, place, attendees, and any reminders you’ve 
set. You also see whether attendees have confirmed that they’ll attend.
To edit something you’ve scheduled, tap the Edit button at the top right of the 
screen. (It looks like a pencil.) You’re now at the familiar screen you used to cre­
ate the event. You can edit everything about the event—name, location, place, 
duration, and so on. When you’re done, tap Save.
Accepting an Invitation
If you’re a social kind of guy or gal, you’ll not only invite other people to events, 
but people will also invite you. If they use Google Calendar (or the Samsung 
calendar), they can use it to invite you to events.
You’ll get the invitation by email, and it’ll contain all pertinent information about 
the event, including the time and place, who scheduled it, who else is attend­
ing, and so on. Tap “More details” to get still more information. When you do so, 
www.it-ebooks.info

you can choose to get more details via either your web browser or the calendar 
itself. In practice, both options have the same result—they launch your browser 
and take you to a Google Calendar page showing more details about the event.
Down at the bottom of the screen, you can say whether you’re going—Yes, No, 
or for those unable to commit to anything (you know who you are), Maybe. Tap 
your response, and you go to a Google Calendar page confirming your choice. 
There you can write an additional note or change your response. The person 
creating the event gets notified of your status via email (or Outlook or whatever 
calendar program she uses).
 NOTE 	 You can accept invitations sent via email not only in your S5’s email program, 
but also via your normal email service. So, for example, if you’re a Gmail user, you can 
accept the invitation on Gmail either on the Web or on your phone.

Calendar and Geolocation
THE GALAXY S5 CALENDAR beats a paper-based one in many ways, and 
none better than geolocation. When you create an event, send an invitation, or 
receive one, the S5 turns it into a live link that, when clicked, shows its location 
in Google Maps—as long as an address is provided, or it’s located at a business 
or landmark such as a restaurant, park, health club, and so on. Tap the Maps link 
to see it.
So when folks get your event invitation, they can see exactly where to go on 
Google Maps. And you can use all of Google Maps’ capabilities, including getting 
directions, getting additional information about the business or area, seeing it 
in Street View, and more. (For more details about using Google Maps on the 
Galaxy S5, see page 142.)
Working with Multiple Calendars
GOT MORE THAN ONE Google Calendar? You can use them on your Calendar 
app on the S5 the same way you can use them in Google Calendar on the Web.
Whenever you create a new event, you see a downward-pointing arrow next to 
your name in the Calendar area at the top of the event screen. Tap the arrow, 
and you see all your Google Calendars. Tap the calendar where you want the 
event to appear.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Calendar 	
173
 NOTE 	 When you look at all your available calendars, you may notice one you don’t re­
member creating, the Samsung Calendar. That’s a calendar created for you automatically 
if you create a Samsung account (page 22). It’s also the main calendar used by Samsung’s 
built-in Calendar app. It syncs automatically with your Google Calendars.
Your calendars are color-coded, so as you look at your schedule, you can see at 
a glance which calendar each event is on. The color appears just to the left of 
the event itself.
If you’d like, you can turn off the display of one or more of your calendars. When 
you’re in the calendar, press the Menu button on the upper right of the screen 
(it looks like three buttons), and then tap “Calendars to display.” You see a list of 
all your calendars, along with the color-coding for each. Next to each calendar 
is a checkbox. If there’s a checkmark next to it, the calendar is visible. If there’s 
no checkmark, it’s hidden. To make it visible, turn on the checkbox next to it; 
to hide it, take the check away. Don’t worry: when you hide the calendar, you 
haven’t deleted the calendar itself. You’ve just hidden it.
 NOTE 	 You can’t change which calendar automatically appears in the Calendar area when 
you create a new event—it’s the same one every time. So even if you choose a different 
calendar to create an event, the next time you create a new event, that first calendar is the 
one that automatically shows up. The same holds true for Google Calendar on the Web. 
Whichever calendar you created first is the calendar that automatically shows up.

More Calendar Options
TAP THE MENU BUTTON, at the top of the screen and you’ll find a few more 
options for your calendar:
• New event. Tap here to create a new calendar item as described on page 165.
• Refresh. In theory, this should sync your calendar with Google Calendar on 
the Web. In practice…well, it’s a bit mysterious what it actually does in prac­
tice. You may end up with a blank new event at a random time on the day 
you’re viewing. As the saying goes, your mileage may vary.
• Search. This option gives you a nifty way to search your calendar. Tap it and 
type a search term. As you type, your calendar pulls up matching calendar 
entries. Select any calendar entry to search your calendar, or type in a dif­
ferent term. The calendar then displays matching results. Tap any calendar 
entry to go to the event.
• Calendars to display. As explained in the previous section, this option lets 
you decide which calendars to show. 
• Send feedback. Got a problem or complaint with Google Calendar? Here’s 
a way to get in touch with the folks at Google about it. You may or may not 
hear back from them. (Still, it’s always good to get something off your chest; 
you’ll live longer that way.)
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Calendar

• Settings. Settings, settings, and more settings. That’s what you’ll find here. 
You’ll be able to change settings for all your calendars (choose General 
settings for that), or for individual calendar accounts (choose an individual 
calendar account for that). You can also create a new account by tapping 
“Add account” at the top of the screen.
General settings control options such as whether to hide events that you or 
others have declined, which day should display as the first day of the week, 
whether to receive calendar notifications, whether your phone should ring 
and vibrate when you get a calendar notification, and so on. The settings for 
individual accounts are as bare-bones as it gets: You decide whether to show 
the account or any individual calendars in the account.
 NOTE 	 There’s a difference between an account and an individual calendar. It’s possible 
to have multiple calendars under a single account. (Confusing, isn’t it?) So your main 
Google account, for example, may have three calendars if you’ve set up three of them: 
Work, Home, and Travel. So what’s an account? If you have more than one Google account, 
each is a separate account. And if you’ve signed up for a Samsung account, that’s a sepa­
rate account as well.

Google Calendar on the Web
THE WEB-BASED VERSION OF Google Calendar lets you set many of the 
options for your calendar that you can’t set on the Galaxy S5. So in your S5’s 
browser, head over to www.google.com/calendar to set those options. Sign in, 
and you’ll see a version of Google Calendar on the Web specifically designed to 
display nicely on the Galaxy S5. You can create new events, but you won’t be 
able to change all the options that you can change if you use your computer to 
visit; it’s somewhat stripped down.
What Happened to Google Tasks?
If you’re already a Google Calendar or 
Gmail user, you may have used Google 
Tasks, a very simple and very useful way 
to keep track of all your to-dos. When 
you use Google Calendar on the Web, 
your task list appears at the right side of 
the screen.
But the Tasks feature is nowhere to be 
found on either the Galaxy S5 calen-
dar, or on the Google Calendar version 
designed to be viewed on the Web with 
your phone’s browser.
Ah, but that doesn’t mean you can’t 
get to it on the S5. You can. It’s just that 
Google has put it somewhere you didn’t 
expect. Go to http://gmail.com/tasks. 
You’ll find Google Tasks there, in all its 
glory.

Synchronizing Your Calendar 
with Outlook
WHEN YOU SET UP your Galaxy S5 calendar, you either hooked it to an existing 
Google Calendar or you had to create a new one. But not everyone in the world 
uses Google Calendar. Plenty of people use other calendars—notably, Outlook.
There’s no direct way to synchronize your S5 Calendar with Outlook, so you may 
think you have to manually keep two sets of calendars in sync, by adding and 
deleting appointments in both places.
You don’t—there’s a workaround. It’s a bit kludgy, but it works. First, synchro­
nize Outlook with Google Calendar on your PC. That way, Google Calendar and 
Outlook will stay in sync. Then sync your Galaxy S5 with Google Calendar. So 
you’re essentially using Google Calendar as a go-between—it shuttles informa­
tion between Outlook and your S5.
Here’s where things get complicated. In the past, one way to do this calendar 
two-step was to download the free Google Calendar Sync app and use that to 
synchronize. Unfortunately, though, Google and Microsoft have been fighting 
like the Hatfields and McCoys, and so that app no longer works. However, if you 
use the Google for-pay service called Google Apps, you can use Google Apps 
Sync for Microsoft Outlook (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gappssync) to do 
the trick.
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 7
An even better bet, if you’re willing to pay a little bit of money, is Companion-
Link for Google (www.companionlink.com). Not only does it sync your calendar, 
but it also syncs your Outlook contacts with your Gmail contacts, which means 
you can keep your contacts in sync between your Galaxy S5 and Outlook. You 
can try it for free for 14 days. If you decide it’s worth paying for, it’ll cost you 
$49.95 for a one-time license, or $14.95 per three-month subscription.
 TIP 	 Neither of these pieces of software work for syncing Google Calendar with Macs 
and iCal. However, Google has posted instructions for syncing iCal with Google Calendar at 
http://bit.ly/a2ifOE.
Corporate Calendar and 
Microsoft Exchange
WOULDN’T IT BE NICE if we could all get along? Yes, it would. And wouldn’t 
it be nice if your Outlook calendar at work synced with your Google Calendar? 
Yes, it would.
Sigh. But it probably won’t work…unless it does. That pretty much sums up the 
confusing state of the conflict between Microsoft and Google when it comes to 
having their calendaring technology work with each other. Once upon a time, 
a piece of technology with the daunting name Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync 
worked with Google Calendar. The IT gods could set it up so that if you used 
an Outlook calendar at work, you’d be able to view that calendar right on your 
Android phone (like a Galaxy S5).
Ah, those were the days. Back in early 2013, though, Google stopped supporting 
Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync. So any company looking to use it for the first 
time to sync Outlook with Google Calendar is out of luck. However, companies 
that were already using it may still be able to keep doing so.
Does yours? There’s only one way to find out. Call up IT and ask them. Then 
cross your fingers, follow their instructions, and hope for the best.

THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S5 is filled with plenty of cool features, but it really 
comes to life when you take it online. With it, you’ve got the whole Internet in 
your hand—and on a screen larger and more vivid than on other smartphones, 
along with a blazing fast 4G Internet connection. Whether you need to search, 
get maps and directions, watch YouTube videos, or do pretty much anything 
else on the Internet, the Galaxy S5 lets you do it.
But first, of course, you need to get connected. You’ll get the rundown on how 
to do that in this chapter, along with learning about one of the Galaxy S5’s more 
amazing capabilities—the ability to turn into a WiFi hotspot to give computers 
and other devices an Internet connection.
How the Galaxy S5 Gets Online
WHENEVER IT’S POWERED ON, the Galaxy S5 is ready to hop onto the 
Internet. Whenever your carrier’s high-speed third-generation (3G) network 
or even faster, state-of-the-art 4G network is available, the phone uses it—you 
can tell by the symbol in the status bar. The 3G and 4G networks were built for 
data and the Internet, so you can quickly send and receive good-sized email 
attachments, download music, watch YouTube videos…pretty much everything 
Internet.

chapter	 8
With your carrier’s 3G or 4G coverage, you’ll be able to hitch a ride in most 
places you use the S5. When the 3G or 4G network isn’t available, the Galaxy 
S5 drops down to the older network used for voice calls, indicated by the bars 
in the status bar. It’s much slower than 3G or 4G, but at least you’re not cut off 
from civilization completely. 3G and 4G connections do run through your bat­
tery charge pretty quickly, which was a problem on earlier smartphones, but 
Samsung gave the S5 a battery that’s up to the challenge. (If you are worried 
about running out of juice, however, you can carry a spare. Try that with an 
iPhone!)
To connect via 3G, 4G, or the voice network, there’s nothing you need to do. 
The Galaxy S5 connects automatically depending on what’s available. WiFi, the 
fastest connection of them all, takes a little more work, as you’ll see in the next 
section.
Connecting via WiFi
WHEN YOU CONNECT TO the Internet via a WiFi hotspot, you’ve hit the 
mother lode of connection speeds. WiFi hotspots can be as fast as your cable 
modem connection at home.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Getting Online: WiFi, 3G/4G, and Mobile Hotspots	
185
If you’ve ever taken a laptop on the road, you may already know where the best 
WiFi hotspots are. Some coffee shops and hotels, for example, offer custom­
ers free WiFi, while others make you pay for it. More and more, you’ll find WiFi 
coverage in airplanes, libraries, and even entire cities. In fact, if you connect 
your computers to the Internet at home using a wireless router, you have your 
own WiFi hotspot, and you can connect your S5 to the Internet via your home 
network.
Your actual connection speed varies from hotspot to hotspot. When you’re at 
a public hotspot, you’re sharing the connection with other people. So if a lot 
of people are using it at once, and the hotspot isn’t set up to handle that many 
connections, your speed may suffer. Also, WiFi isn’t a good bet when you’re in 
motion. Hotspots have a range of only about 300 feet, so you and your phone 
can quickly move right past them.
 NOTE 	 When you’re connected to a WiFi hotspot, the S5 uses it for more than just 
Internet access. It also uses WiFi for finding your current location in apps like Google Maps 
(unless you turn off GPS, as described in the box on page 19). The phone uses a clever 
technology that finds nearby WiFi networks and uses fancy algorithms to determine your 
location. It’s not as precise as GPS, but it’s still pretty good. And as you’ll see on page 196, 
the S5 can also use WiFi to make phone calls, so you’ll use up fewer minutes of your call­
ing plan. 
Unlike the 3G/4G connection, which happens automatically, WiFi doesn’t work 
unless you turn it on. That’s a good thing, since WiFi connections sap much 
more battery power.
Once you’re ready to hook up to a hotspot, here’s how:
• Use the widget. To get to it, pull down the Notification panel, and it’s at the 
upper left of the screen. The leftmost button controls your WiFi radio. If the 
button is gray, tap it and it turns green, meaning you’ve turned on WiFi. If it’s 
already green, you don’t need to do anything. (If it’s on and you want to turn 
it off, tap it.)
• Use connection settings. Pull down the Notification panel, tap the Settings 
icon, and from the screen that appears, tap Wi-Fi at the top of the Quick 
Settings section.
What happens next varies according to whether you’re connected to a WiFi 
network. If you’re already connected, and your settings are all aligned, you don’t 
need to do anything—you’ll automatically connect to one of your preferred WiFi 
networks, like the one you use at home.
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 8
    
However, if you’ve never connected to a network before and you’re in range 
of an open WiFi network, or if networks you’ve connected to before are out of 
range, then the S5 needs to ask you which network you want to join. When you 
turn on WiFi, a list of all nearby networks appears. For each network, you see its 
name, as well as the relative strength of the connection: the more blue waves, 
the stronger the connection. In addition, some networks have lock icons on 
them. A lock means that the network is encrypted and password-protected, and 
so you’ll need the password in order to connect to it. No lock means that you 
can connect without a password.
On the screen that lists all nearby WiFi connections, you’ll also see a list of net­
works you’ve connected to in the past, even those out of range. Those networks 
won’t show an icon with waves on it, and the words “Not in range” appear 
underneath them in the listing.
Tap any network on the list, and a connection screen appears. Tap Connect if it’s 
open or, if it’s protected, type the password and tap Connect. Either way, after 
a few seconds, you make the connection. The network to which you just con­
nected shows up in your list with the word “Connected” underneath it.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Getting Online: WiFi, 3G/4G, and Mobile Hotspots	
187
 NOTE 	 In some instances even though a network shows that it doesn’t require a 
password, you’ll need a password in order to use it. In those cases, you can connect to 
the network without typing in a password, but in order to use the network, you’ll have to 
open your browser and register or type in a password. Ask the manager or whoever owns 
the network. Often, these kinds of networks are for-pay, so you’ll have to use a credit 
card. In some instances, a business (like a coffee shop) will give you a password for free, 
sometimes for a limited amount of time.
At the very top of the WiFi screen, you’ll find a setting called Smart Network 
Switch. It’s normally turned on, and if it isn’t you should do so by turning on the 
checkbox next to it. With Smart Network Switch turned on, you’ll enjoy uninter­
rupted Internet access when you move in and out of range of WiFi networks. 
When you’re on a WiFi network and go out of range, your cellular data connec­
tion takes over, without dropping your Internet connection. And when you’re 
on your cellular connection and go within range of a network to which you’ve 
already connected, your Internet connection gets handed over to the WiFi 
network. 
If you find yourself getting disconnected from WiFi networks, try adjusting your 
connection settings. From the Home screen, pull down the Notification panel, 
tap the Settings icon, and then tap Wi-Fi. Press the Menu key at the upper right 
of the screen and then select Advanced. Make sure the “Keep Wi-Fi on during 
Sleep” setting is set to Always. That way, your WiFi won’t go to sleep when the 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
188	
chapter	 8
S5’s screen turns off. Select “Only when plugged in,” and WiFi won’t go to sleep 
as long as your phone is plugged in.
What if for some reason a screen doesn’t appear showing you all the available 
nearby networks? That might mean that there are no networks within range…
or it might just be some odd temporary glitch. To check whether there are any 
available networks nearby, on any page, pull down the Notification panel, tap 
the Settings icon, and then tap Wi-Fi. You come to the screen that shows you all 
the nearby WiFi networks so you can make a connection.
 TIP 	 If your cellphone plan includes a limit on the amount of data you can use every 
month, and charges you more if you go over the limit, the S5’s WiFi capabilities can be 
your best friend. When you’re sending or receiving data via WiFi, it’s not counted as part 
of your data plan. So using WiFi whenever possible can help make sure you don’t bump 
up against your limits. And if you know you’re going to be downloading large files, such 
as songs or movies, try to do it via WiFi. In addition to not racking up data use, it’ll be 
faster than 3G or 4G.
Disconnecting and Reconnecting
To disconnect from a WiFi network, turn off WiFi. If you want to keep WiFi on, 
but want to disconnect from the network, go back to the screen that lists the 
nearby WiFi networks, tap the network to which you’re connected, and then tap 
Forget. Boom—you’re disconnected.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Getting Online: WiFi, 3G/4G, and Mobile Hotspots	
189
There’s a downside to disconnecting this way, though. Normally whenever you 
connect to a WiFi network, the Galaxy S5 remembers that connection. So the 
next time it’s in range, it automatically connects you, including using the net­
work’s password. If you tap Forget, though, it won’t log you in automatically the 
next time you’re in range.
 NOTE 	 The S5 tells you in the Notification panel that there’s a nearby WiFi network if 
that network is an open one—that is, one that doesn’t use security. It won’t notify you 
if you’ve previously connected to the network and your phone is set to remember it and 
connect automatically. If you want to turn off ever being notified, on any pane, pull down 
the Notification panel, tap Settings→Wi-Fi, press the menu button, and select Advanced. 
Then turn the checkbox off next to “Network notification.”
Connecting to For-Pay WiFi Networks
Some WiFi hotspots require you to pay a fee for their use. In those instances, 
you’ll have to take one more step when connecting. First make the connection 
in the normal way. Then launch the Galaxy S5’s web browser by tapping its icon 
on the Home screen or in the Apps screen. A screen appears, delivered by the 
network, asking you to first register and pay.
Some free WiFi networks require you to agree to terms of service before you 
can use them. In that case, when you launch the browser, those terms of service 
will appear. So if you’re at a free WiFi hotspot and connect to it, but can’t get an

Internet-based app like Pandora to work, it might be because you haven’t yet 
launched your browser and agreed to the terms of service.
Connecting to an “Invisible” Network
For security reasons, some people or businesses tell their network not to 
broadcast its name—its Service Set Identifier (SSID). That way, the network may 
appear invisible to people passing by. (Dedicated hackers, though, can easily 
detect it.)
If you need to connect to a network that isn’t broadcasting its SSID, you can still 
connect, as long as you’ve been provided with its name, the type of security it 
uses, and its password. Pull down the Notification panel, tap the settings icon, 
tap Wi-Fi, and from the screen that appears, scroll to the bottom of the screen 
and tap “Add Wi-Fi network.” Type the network’s SSID, choose the security 
type, type the password, and then tap Save to connect to the network.
Boost Your Download Speed
WiFi is typically faster than a 3G or 4G connection, but let’s face it: No mat­
ter how fast your connection is, it’s not fast enough when you’re downloading 
something from the Internet. Everybody wants instant satisfaction.
The S5 has an ingenious way to bring you closer to download satisfaction—it can 
combine your WiFi connection with your cellular data connection into one big 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Getting Online: WiFi, 3G/4G, and Mobile Hotspots

download pipe when you’re downloading big files. As a result, you’ll download 
things at the speed of WiFi plus the speed of 3G or 4G.
To do it, pull down the Notification panel, tap the Settings icon, and then tap 
“Download booster.” Move the setting from Off to On. When you do that you’ll 
get a warning that you’ll be using your data connection in addition to WiFi for 
large downloads, which could mean additional charges if you go over your data 
plan limits. Proceed if you don’t care. Note that the Download booster goes into 
effect only when you download files over 30 MB.
The WPS Alternative
All this fiddling around with WiFi network connections can be confusing and 
time-consuming. So the Galaxy S5 has a built-in feature for making the con­
nection easier—as long as the WiFi hotspot to which you want to connect uses 
a standard called WPS (WiFi Protected Setup). Find out from your provider 
whether your home router has it, and if it does, follow the instructions that came 
with the router for setting it up. Then, on your phone, pull down the Notification 
panel, and then tap the settings icon. From the screen that appears, tap Wi-Fi. 
Tap the Menu button and, from the menu that appears, select either “WPS push 
button” or “WPS PIN entry,” depending on the way you’ve set up WPS on your 
router. (Again, check the WPS instructions for doing this.) Then just follow the 
S5 instructions onscreen. You’ll make the connection automatically—no muss, no 
fuss.

Turning Your Galaxy S5 into a 
WiFi Hotspot or Tethering It
The Galaxy S5 can do more than just connect you to a hotspot. It can create its 
own hotspot, so other computers, cellphones, and devices can connect to the 
Internet through it. That means, for example, that if you’ve got a computer that 
you want to connect to the Internet but there’s no WiFi hotspot or Internet ser­
vice nearby, you can connect using your phone. So from now on, wherever you 
are, you’ve got Internet access as long as you’ve got your Galaxy S5 with you. 
The S5 calls this setting up a mobile hotspot.
Doing this, you can provide Internet access not just for one PC, but for up to 
five—that’s right, count them, five—devices. (Note: The number of devices you 
can connect to may vary according to your carrier, so check with it for details.)
Not only that, but a related feature lets you share your Internet connection by 
simply connecting a USB cable between your computer and your S5. That’s 
called tethering. And you can also connect the devices to the WiFi hotspot via 
Bluetooth as well.
 NOTE 	 If you don’t have a 3G or 4G connection, you won’t be able to set up a mobile 
hotspot. So try doing this only when you see the 3G or 4G signal in the status bar.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Getting Online: WiFi, 3G/4G, and Mobile Hotspots	
193
To perform this magic, the Galaxy S5 connects to a 3G or 4G network as it nor­
mally does, using its 3G or 4G radio. Then it uses its WiFi radio to set up a WiFi 
hotspot and lets multiple computers, phones, tablets, and similar devices con­
nect to it. They connect to it as they would connect to any other hotspot, and 
share its single 3G or 4G connection. So don’t expect blazing speed if several 
people use it simultaneously. Still, it’s a high-speed connection.
Be aware that this does come at a price. As of this writing, you’ll generally have 
to pay an extra $20 per month or so in addition to your normal data fee to be 
able to use this feature. (Again, check with your carrier.) And there may be maxi­
mum data limits imposed as well. That will apply only to data sent and received 
via the 3G or 4G hotspot, not toward your normal data plan.
OK, enough introduction. Here’s how to do it: First, make sure WiFi is turned on 
and you’ve got a 3G or 4G connection. Once you’ve done that, pull down the 
Notification panel, tap the Settings icon, and from the screen that appears, scroll 
down to the Network Connections area and tap “Tethering and Mobile HotSpot.” 
What you do next varies according to whether you want to tether your phone or 
turn it into a hotspot.
Setting Up a Hotspot
If you want to set up a hotspot, tap Mobile HotSpot on the screen that appears, 
and at the top of the screen, slide the setting to On. A screen appears titled 
“First time HotSpot configuration.” As the name implies, you’ll see this screen 
only once, so don’t despair—you won’t have to fill it in every time you want to 
set up a hotspot.
Here’s what you’ll fill out:
• Network SSID. Type the name that you want your hotspot to have. The box 
will be filled in for you already, with something really exciting like “Samsung 
Galaxy S 5529.” Make the name anything you want. Go crazy….or don’t. But 
make it something that you’ll remember.
• Broadcast network name (SSID). This box will already be checkmarked 
for you. It means just what it says: Anyone will be able to see the network’s 
name because it’s being broadcast, which is the way networks normally 
work. But if you’re paranoid, uncheck the box. No one will be able to see 
that your network exists. However, you can still connect to it. For details, see 
page 190.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
194	
chapter	 8
• Security. This drop-down menu lets you choose the type of security you 
want your network to have. WPA2 PSK will be chosen for you. Most of the 
time, you’ll want to stick with it, because it gives you a high level of security. 
Whatever you do, though, don’t choose Open. If you do that, anyone can 
connect to your hotspot. Not only will they suck up your bandwidth, but they 
could also possibly steal your files.
• Password. Select the password that you or anyone else will have to type in 
in order to connect. Please, whatever you do, don’t use the word “password” 
as a password. When choosing a password, use a mix of numbers and let­
ters, including capital letters. You’ll have to make it at least eight characters 
long.
That’s it. Tap Save, and you’ll be ready to go. If you’re feeling super-techie, tap 
the “Show advanced options” box. A number of new options appear, including 
choosing the network’s broadcast channel (if you need to ask what that is, then 
you don’t need to select it), the maximum number of devices that can connect 
to the hotspot, and the timeout settings, which is the number of minutes of inac­
tivity it takes before the connected device will get bumped off the network.
 NOTE 	 Changing the maximum number of devices that can connect using the “Show 
advanced options” menu may not actually change the number of devices that can 
connect. The maximum number of connections is set by your carrier, so increasing the 
number beyond that won’t actually change how many devices can connect.

195
When a device connects to your hotspot, you’ll get a notification.
When you don’t want the hotspot to be active anymore, get back to the screen 
where you set it up, and then flip the On switch to Off.
Setting Up and Using Tethering
If you’re going to connect only one device to your phone in order to give it 
Internet access, such as a PC, you might instead want to use the USB tether­
ing feature. With it, you connect your PC and your phone with a USB cable, and 
your PC then uses the phone’s Internet connection.
To tether your PC to your phone, first connect your PC to your S5 (page 319). 
Windows will install a special driver that lets your PC recognize your phone. 
Next, from the “Tethering and Mobile HotSpot” screen that you used to set up 
your mobile hotspot, turn on the USB Tethering checkbox. You will now be able 
to use the S5’s Internet connection. Your phone can be connected via 3G, 4G, or 
WiFi, and your PC will share that connection.
 NOTE 	 When you connect your S5 to your PC with a USB cable, you can’t use tethering 
and transfer files at the same time. Also, when you use tethering, you won’t be able to 
use the S5’s memory card.

Configuring Wi-Fi Direct
YOUR GALAXY S5 CAN use a helpful technology called Wi-Fi Direct that 
makes it easy to connect directly to other WiFi devices without having to use a 
WiFi network. So, for example, you can connect directly to a PC that also uses 
Wi-Fi Direct in order to share files.
Only devices that meet the Wi-Fi Direct standards and certifications can use 
Wi-Fi Direct, and your Galaxy S5 does that. To use Wi-Fi Direct to connect to 
another device, pull down the Notification Panel, and tap Settings→Wi-Fi. Tap 
the Menu button and select Wi-Fi Direct. Your phone scans for nearby Wi-Fi 
Direct devices. Once it finds any, follow the onscreen prompts to connect.
 NOTE 	 For more information about Wi-Fi Direct, and to see what other devices use it, 
go to www.wi-fi.org/Wi-Fi_Direct.php.
Wi-Fi Calling
WHEN YOU’RE CONNECTED TO a WiFi network, the S5 can make your phone 
calls via WiFi rather than over the normal cellular network. What’s so great 
about that? When you make calls using WiFi, they don’t count against the 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Getting Online: WiFi, 3G/4G, and Mobile Hotspots	
197
number of minutes on your calling plan. So you’ll be able to make more calls 
than if you make connections only using your normal calling plan.
To turn it on, pull down the Notification panel, tap Settings, and scroll down 
to the Applications area. Tap Call, and on the screen that appears, turn Wi-Fi 
Calling from Off to On. That’s all it takes—you’re done. If you want to get techie 
and fancy, you can customize how it works. With Wi-Fi Calling turned on, tap 
the Wi-Fi Calling entry, select Connection Preferences, and on the screen that 
appears, select from the following:
• Wi-Fi Preferred. When you’re connected to a WiFi network, the call will go 
over WiFi, and when you’re not connected to a WiFi network, the call will go 
over your normal cellular network. 
• Cellular Network Preferred. Your calls will normally go over your cellular 
network, even if you’re connected to a WiFi network. However, if you’re con­
nected to a WiFi network and your cellular network isn’t available, the call 
will go over the WiFi Network.
• Never use Cellular Network. Your phone will make or receive calls only when 
you’re connected to a WiFi network, and will never use your cellular network.

Airplane Mode
AIRLINES BAN THE USE of cellphone signals during flights. But they don’t 
actually ban the use of phones. So you can still use your Galaxy S5 to run apps, 
play games, and so on, as long as its radios aren’t turned on.
That’s where Airplane mode comes in. It turns off all your S5’s radios but lets 
you use your phone for everything else.
 NOTE 	 You might also want to use Airplane mode even when you’re not in flight in 
order to save power.
To turn on Airplane mode, pull down the Notification panel, tap the Settings icon 
and scroll down to the Network Connections area. Tap “Airplane mode,” and 
from the screen that appears, turn the switch from Off to On.
 TIP 	 An increasing number of airplanes have WiFi connections. If you want to connect 
your S5 to the plane’s WiFi network, turn on Airplane mode, and then turn on WiFi alone. 
Make a connection as you would normally. That way you’ve turned off all the S5’s radios 
except for WiFi.

ONCE YOU’VE USED YOUR Samsung Galaxy S5 to skim movie reviews on your 
way to the theater, check out an online menu before you choose a restaurant, or 
find a newspaper to read on the train, you may wonder how you ever got along 
without having the Web in the palm of your hand. The big 5.1-inch screen gives 
you an awesome Web experience wherever you go. With more and more web 
designers making their sites look good and work well on mobile devices like the 
Galaxy S5, you may find yourself using the Browser more than any other app.
The Galaxy S5’s Browser
THE S5’S BROWSER HAS plenty of goodies, much like those in a computer 
browser, including bookmarks, AutoComplete for web addresses, cookies, pass­
word memorization, the ability to save and share pages, shortcuts, the ability 
to select and copy text…just about the whole nine yards. However, the browser 
itself is fairly bare bones, and its simplicity can at first be off-putting.
But once you know your way around a bit, you’ll be browsing at warp speed. 
Here are the main controls you need to know about:
• Address bar. Here’s where you enter the URL—the web address—for a page 
you want to visit.

• Windows open. Tells you how many websites you’ve got open. Tap it to see 
thumbnails of them all. Then tap any thumbnail to visit it, and tap the – key 
to close any site.
• Bookmarks. Tap this button and you’ll add the current page to your 
Bookmarks list and also be able to see pages you’ve visited frequently, and 
the history of your web browsing. See page 209 for more details.
www.it-ebooks.info

• Navigation buttons. Tap these to go forward or backward in your browsing 
session.
• Saved pages. You can save entire web pages and then browse them on your 
S5 at any point, even if you’re not connected to the Internet.
• Menu key. This key is in the same place that it is on all other places on 
the S5—on the screen’s upper right. Tap it to get at most of the browser’s 
features, including opening a new browser window, setting your homepage, 
adding a shortcut of the current web page to the S5 Home screen, managing 
your bookmarks, and more.
There are plenty of choices when you tap the Menu key. To open a new 
browser window, tap “New window.” To share the page with others, tap 
“Share Page via.” To find text on a page, tap “Find on page” and then do a 
search. There are also plenty more options, as you’ll see in the next sections.
 NOTE 	 You may notice something odd and confusing as you use your browser. Some­
times the address bar and the buttons near it, and the buttons down at the bottom of the 
screen, disappear. These tools appear when you first visit a web page, but they scoot out 
of your way as you scroll down through the page. To make them appear again, scroll back 
toward the top.

Basic Navigation and Managing Windows
JUST LIKE A DESKTOP browser, your phone’s browser lets you open multiple 
windows and visit multiple sites. It’s just harder to tell that you’re visiting multi­
ple sites, because the S5’s browser doesn’t have enough room for tabs. Instead, 
the S5 opens multiple windows, one for each site you’re visiting. When you’re in 
the browser, tap the Window button (it’s on the upper right of the screen, just to 
the left of the Menu button) to see thumbnails of your open windows superim­
posed on your existing page. It’s a cool effect. Swipe up and down to see other 
open windows. Tap any window to view the site full screen. Tap the minus sign 
at its top to close the window. And tap the + sign at the top of your screen to 
open a new window.
Navigating a Web Page
HEAD TO A WEB page, and most of the time you see an entire page, laid out 
with the same fonts, links, pictures, and so on, as if you were visiting it using a 
computer with a much larger screen. Of course, looking at an entire web page 
on the S5’s screen isn’t the same thing as looking at a web page on a 21-inch 
monitor. The type is minuscule, the photos small, the links hard to detect. But 
letting you see the entire screen at once makes a good deal of sense, because at 
a glance you can see what section of the page you want to view.

Browsing for Browsers
The S5 gives you not just one, but two 
browsers: the standard one that runs 
right out of the box, and Chrome, which 
is the smartphone version of Google’s 
house browser. They’re similar, but with 
a few differences, notably in the way 
that Chrome handles tabs. This chapter 
focuses on the S5’s built-in browser. It’s 
the browser that runs whenever you tap 
the Internet icon. If you prefer to run 
Chrome, tap its icon in the Apps screen.
If you use Chrome on other computers or 
devices, it will sync bookmarks and other 
information with Chrome on the S5. If 
you use Chrome on a desktop computer, 
you may want to opt for using Chrome 
on the S5, and not just because it syncs 
information between the desktop and 
S5 versions. Its interface on the S5 is 
somewhat similar to the interface on the 
desktop version. For example, you can 
see and switch between multiple tabs, 
although unlike the desktop version, 
the tabs aren’t arrayed horizontally, but 
instead vertically on top of one another.
There’s also a nifty feature that lets 
you see all the sites open on your other 
devices that use Chrome, like desktops 
and laptops or Android-based tablets. 
Not only can you see a list of sites, by 
device, but if you tap any, you head 
straight to it on your S5. To use the 
feature, press the Menu key and select 
“Other devices” from the screen that 
appears.
All that said, if you’re not already a 
Chrome user, it can take some getting 
used to, particularly its tab handling. 
So which should you use? As the saying 
goes, you pays your money and you 
takes your chances—although in this 
instance, both browsers are free.
Furthermore, you’re not just limited to 
the S5’s built-in browser and Google 
Chrome. You can download other popular 
browsers—like Opera and Firefox—from 
Google Play.
These alternative browsers often add 
features that the built-in one doesn’t 
have. Firefox, for example, will sync 
your Galaxy S5 bookmarks with the 
bookmarks on your PC or Mac. Opera is 
faster than the built-in browser because 
it compresses graphics before download-
ing them to your phone. It also syncs 
bookmarks with PCs or Macs and offers 
other extras as well.
ALTERNATE UNIVERSES
That’s where the fun begins. You can use the S5’s zooming and scrolling capabil­
ities to head quickly to the part of the page you want to view, and then zoom in.
You’ve got two ways to do so:
• Use the two-finger spread. Put two fingers on the screen on the area 
where you want to zoom in, and move your fingers apart. The web page 
stretches and zooms in. The more you spread, the greater the zoom. Pinch 
your fingers together to zoom back out. You may need to do the two-finger 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
206	
chapter	 9
spread and pinch several times until you get the exact magnification you 
want.
• Double-tap. Double-tap with a finger on the section of the page where you 
want to zoom. Double-tap again to zoom out. You can’t control the zoom 
level as finely with the double-tap as you can using the two-finger spread.
    
Once you’ve zoomed in, you scroll around the web page by dragging or flicking 
your finger—the same kind of navigation you use for other S5 apps.
Web Pages Designed for Mobile Phones
AS YOU BROWSE THE Web, you may come across sites that differ significantly 
when viewed on the Galaxy S5 (or other smartphones) compared with the exact 
same sites viewed on a computer. That’s because web designers have cre­
ated pages specifically designed to be viewed with mobile phones, taking into 
account that mobile phones have smaller screens than computers.
CNN, for example, has sites designed especially for mobile viewing. Head to the 
same site at the exact same time of day with a smartphone and a computer, and 
you see very different pages, even though the content of the pages is much the 
same.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
The Web 	
207
These pages are formatted to be read on the phone, so very often they don’t 
include complex layouts, and instead present articles and other information in 
scrollable lists. They generally don’t allow you to zoom in and zoom out. You’ll 
navigate primarily by scrolling and clicking links.
 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
208	
chapter	 9
The Address Bar
THE ADDRESS BAR IS the box at the top of the browser where you type the 
URL of the website you want to visit. When you type an address and head to 
a page, a small bar above the address bar shows you the status—how much of 
the page has loaded and how much is left to go. To the right of the address bar, 
you’ll find the Window button that indicates how many windows you have open 
and for navigating to them, and then the Menu button.
 NOTE 	 The bar indicating your page’s loading status is only an approximation, so don’t 
take it for the absolute truth. Also, if you’re on a fast connection, you may not see the bar 
because pages may download so fast that the bar will appear and disappear in the blink 
of an eye.
Typing an Address
To type a URL into the address bar, first tap the bar. The current URL is high­
lighted in blue. Then use the keyboard to type an address. As you type, the 
S5 displays sites you’ve visited that match the letters you type. So when you 
type the letter C, for example, it may display Computerworld.com (http://
Computerworld.com), CNN.com (http://CNN.com), and so on. It will also display 
search terms you might want to use, because the address bar does double duty 
as a search box. So it may be a very long list of URLs and suggestions you see.
 NOTE 	 As you type, you’ll also see suggestions for sites you might not yet have visited. 
Google is trying to be helpful and displays popular sites that match the letters you’re 
typing.
You’ll notice, though, that it might also display URLs that don’t start with the 
letter C. If you’ve previously visited a site about the international opera star 
Cecilia Bartoli, you may see that site come up when you type C. That’s because 
the Galaxy S5’s browser looks through your browsing history and Bookmarks list 
(see the next page), and looks for all matches to that letter, not just in URLs but 
also text in the page’s title. When it displays its list as you type, it includes both 
the page’s title and the URL.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
The Web 	
209
As you continue to type, the list narrows down and includes only those sites that 
match the letters you’re typing. So if you type com, cnn.com (http://cnn.com) 
no longer appears on your list, but computerworld.com (http://computerworld.
com) does. When you see the site you want to visit, just tap its listing. You head 
straight there. If there’s no match on the list, you’ll have to type the entire URL.
You can also use the address bar to search the Web. Just type your search term, 
but don’t add a .com ending. Your browser will search the Web for the term, 
using (what else?) Google.
 NOTE 	 Don’t bother to type the http:// part of a web address. The browser knows to 
put that in for you. You do, however, need to type in the .com or other ending, such as 
.edu. After you type in the address, tap the arrow button, and you head to the page.
Bookmarks
YOU CAN SAVE FAVORITE sites as bookmarks—sites you can easily visit again 
without having to retype their URLs. In fact, the S5’s browser comes installed 
with bookmarks for a few popular sites, including Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, 
CNN, ESPN, and more. The exact bookmarks you get depend on your cellphone 
carrier, which is usually in charge of that. Can you guess why? Right—because it 
puts its own web page there as well.
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 9
To see your bookmarks, tap the Bookmarks icon at the bottom of the screen. 
You see all your bookmarks, either displayed as a list or as a group of thumbnails 
of each of the bookmarked pages, so that you can distinguish them visually. To 
switch back and forth between the views, tap the Menu button and then select 
“List view” or “Thumbnail view.”
No matter which view you use, to go to a bookmarked site, tap its thumbnail or 
listing. Voilà—you’re there.
 TIP 	 If you sometimes find yourself with a slow Internet connection, and wish there 
was a way to browse the Web faster, here’s a bookmark you should add to your list: www.
google.com/gwt/n. It hides most graphics, letting you browse the Web much more quickly 
on a slow connection. In the small box near the top of the screen, type the site you want 
to visit.
Adding a Bookmark
Whenever you visit a web page you want to add as a bookmark, tap the small 
star at the far left of the address bar. A screen appears that includes the web 
page’s title and its URL. In the Name box, type a different title if you wish. You 
can even edit the URL in the Location box to go to a different website, but most 
of the time you won’t want to. Then tap Save. The bookmark is added to your 
list.

 NOTE 	 The S5 has an oddball Bookmark feature that you’ll no doubt find confusing. 
Sometimes when you add a bookmark it doesn’t seem to appear, but if you try to add it 
again, you’ll be told it’s already in your Bookmarks, because…well, it is. You just haven’t 
noticed. The S5 has already figured out that you visit that web page a lot and taken the 
liberty of adding it to a subfolder of Bookmarks called My Best.
Managing Bookmarks
The Galaxy S5 lets you do more than just go to bookmarks. You can delete 
them, share them, edit them, and so on. There are several ways to do this, each 
of which has different options. For the first way, head to Bookmarks and then 
tap the Menu button. You get these options:
• Select. Choose this option if you want to delete one or more bookmarks or 
move them to a specific folder. When you tap this option, boxes appear next 
to all of your bookmarks. Put checkmarks next to those you want to take 
action on. Then tap the trash icon to delete them, or tap the Menu button 
and tap “Move to folder” to move them to a different folder.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
212	
chapter	 9
    
• Delete. Select this option, and a screen appears that lets you select book­
marks you want to delete. After you select them, tap Delete to delete them, 
or Cancel if you change your mind and don’t want to delete any.
• List view/Thumbnail view. Switches between the list and thumbnail views.
• Create folder. If you’ve got a lot of bookmarks, you may want to organize 
them by folders—news, entertainment, and so on. Tap here and from the 
screen that appears, name your folder and tap OK. When you go to your 
Bookmarks, that folder will show up. Tap it to view any bookmarks in that 
folder. 
• Change order. Lets you change the order in which your bookmarks appear 
in a list or thumbnails. Tap it, and from the screen that appears, drag the 
bookmarks to be in a different order on the list or thumbnail.
There’s another way to manage your bookmarks. When you’re on the book­
marks page, hold your finger on the bookmark you want to edit or manage. 
Boxes appear next to all of your bookmarks, with a checkmark next to your cur­
rent one. Turn on the checkboxes of all the bookmarks you want to take action 
on. Then take your action; for example, tap the trash icon to delete them. Your 
choices vary depending on whether you’ve chosen only a single bookmark or 
multiple ones. If you select multiple bookmarks, your choices are limited to two: 
“Move to folder,” and “Add shortcut to home screen.” For single bookmarks, you 
get more possibilities.

Assuming you have only a single bookmark checked, here are your choices 
when you tap the Menu key:
• Share via. Tap to share the link of the bookmark by a variety of methods, 
including email, text message, Bluetooth, and more.
• Edit. Brings up a page that lets you edit the name and location of the book­
mark. It looks much like the page for adding a bookmark.
• Move to folder. Lets you move it to the folder of your choice. 
• Add to Quick Access. This adds the site to a floating toolbox you can have 
always available to you wherever you are on the S5. The toolbox holds your 
favorite apps as well as any websites you add to it. For details, go to page 
378.
• Add shortcut to home screen. Tap this option, and a shortcut to the book­
marked page is added to your Home screen. When you tap the bookmark, it 
opens the browser to that site. You can move and delete the icon after you 
add it, as you can see on page 33.
 NOTE 	 If you add a shortcut to your Home screen, and then delete the shortcut, the 
bookmark still remains in your browser’s Bookmarks list.
• Set as homepage. Tap this, and from now on whenever you open a new 
window, it opens to that site.

The History List
DID YOU VISIT A website earlier today, or sometime within a week, but can’t 
remember what it was? No problem! The S5’s browser keeps track of sites 
you’ve visited. It’s a great way (in addition to Bookmarks) to head back to sites 
you’ve visited before without having to type—or even remember—the web 
address.
To see it, tap the Bookmarks button, and then tap the History button at the top 
of the screen. You’ll see a list of websites you’ve visited previously. The History 
list shows you not just sites you’ve visited today, but yesterday, in the last seven 
days, and a month ago. Rather than show you all the sites you visited before 
today, the browser shows the day (Yesterday, “Last 7 days,” and so on), with an 
arrow next to it. Tap the arrow, and you see the full list of sites for that day.
 NOTE 	 The History list doesn’t give you the option of viewing sites as thumbnails, only 
as a list.
The list works much like the Bookmarks list—tap the site you want to visit. You’ll 
notice one difference between these lists and the Bookmarks list: Some of the 
sites here have a gold star next to them. That indicates that the site is on your 
Bookmarks list.

Editing and Managing the History List
You can manage your History list in similar ways as with Bookmarks. Tap the 
Menu button and choose Select, and then choose sites you want to manage. As 
with the Bookmarks list, if you choose only one site you get more options than 
you do if you select multiple ones. If you choose one site, you can share it, copy 
it, add it to Quick Access, add it to your bookmarks, or set it as your homepage. 
If you choose multiple sites, all you can do is copy them to the Clipboard.
There’s one thing you can do to your History list that you can’t do with the 
Bookmarks list: You can clear your entire history. If you feel guilty about visit­
ing sites for any reason, or just want them cleared out, you can get rid of them 
all. While in the History list, press the Menu key, and then select “Clear history.” 
Your slate will be wiped clean.
Tapping Links
LINKS ON THE WEB couldn’t be simpler or more convenient. Tap the link, and 
you get sent to a new web page. But this is the Galaxy S5, so there’s a lot more 
you can do with links than just tap them. Hold your finger on a link, and a menu 
appears with these options:
 NOTE 	 Sometimes when you click a link, instead of loading a web page, the Galaxy S5 
may take a different action. For example, if the link is to an email address, it will open the 
Email app, with a new message addressed to the link’s email address.
• Open. Opens the linked page in the current window.
• Open in new window. Opens the linked page in a new window.
• Save link. Saves the linked page to the Download folder. To view the link and 
anything else in the Download folder, see page 218.
• Copy link. Tap to copy the link’s URL to the Clipboard, so you can paste it 
somewhere else, such as in a document or email.
• Select text. Most links are text links—that is, they are words that, when 
clicked, send you to a web page. When you choose “Select text,” you select 
that text and then have options for doing more things with it, such as search­
ing for the text and more. For details, see page 221.

 NOTE 	 If you hold your finger on a graphic that’s also a link, several other options 
having to do with the image appear. You can save the image, copy the image to the 
Clipboard, or view the image.
Other Things to Tap
The Galaxy S5 is smart enough that you can take action based on what you see 
on web pages, without even having to use links:
• When you see a phone number on the Web and want to call it, just tap it. 
The Galaxy S5 dialer launches, with the number already entered. Tap the 
phone icon to make the call.
• When you see an address on the Web and want to see a map of its location, 
tap it. Google Maps launches, centered on the location.
• When you see an email address, even if the address hasn’t been cre­
ated as a link, tap it and the Email app opens, with a new message already 
addressed to that address.

Saving Online Images
WHEN YOU’RE BROWSING THE Web, sooner or later you’ll come across a 
picture you’d like to save. For example, if a friend posts a picture from your 
birthday party on Facebook, you can save it on your Galaxy S5 and then share it 
with others.
There’s a quick and easy way to save that image. Hold your finger on the picture 
for a second or two, and a menu appears with the following three options:
• Save image. Downloads the picture to your Download folder. See the next 
section to learn how to go back and view all the pictures in this folder.
• Copy image. Copies the image to your Clipboard.
• View image. Opens the image in its own page. As a practical matter, this 
option doesn’t do much, because it doesn’t make the image any larger or 
smaller—you’re seeing the same image, just on its own rather than on a web 
page.
 TIP 	 If the picture is also a link, the menu shows the usual options for bookmarking the 
link, saving the link, and so on.

Viewing Downloaded Images
Now that you’ve got graphics saved on your S5, how can you view them? It’s 
simple. Open the Gallery (page 115) and go to the Download folder. Then view 
and manage them as you would any other pictures.
Finding Text, Sharing Pages, Getting 
Page Information, and More
THE GALAXY S5’S BROWSER has a lot more tricks up its sleeve than you’ve 
seen so far. To get to them, when you’re on a web page, press the Menu key. 
You’ll find a menu of options:
• Homepage. Sends you back to your homepage.
• New window. Opens a new window to your homepage.
• Add to Quick Access. Adds the site to your floating toolbox (page 378) so 
you can quickly hop to the site.
• Add shortcut to home screen. Adds a shortcut to the web page on your 
Home screen. The shortcut will be to the specific page you’re on, not to the 
general website.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
The Web 	
219
• Save page. Saves the entire web page, graphics included, on your S5. How 
to view it once you’ve saved it? At the bottom of the screen, tap the Saved 
Pages icon — it’s the one with the disk on it, to the left of the Bookmarks 
icon.
• Share via. Tap to share the page via email or text messaging, social net­
working, Bluetooth, and, depending on what software you have installed, 
potentially several other ways as well. You don’t actually share the page 
itself; instead, you send a link to it. Selecting this option copies the URL to an 
email message or a text message. You can then select an address and add 
explanatory text to the message as well.
• Find on page. Looking for text on a page? Tap this option, and a search box 
appears, along with the keyboard. Type the text or phrase you’re searching 
for, and the Galaxy S5 finds the text, sends you to its location on the page, 
and highlights it in blue. To find the next time the text or phrase is men­
tioned, tap the down arrow. To find a previous mention of it on the page, tap 
the up arrow.
• Incognito mode. There are times when you want to browse the Web in pri­
vacy—you don’t want anyone else to know you’ve visited. Not to imply that 
you have anything to hide, but no matter the reason, select this option. The 
site won’t be saved in your History list, and there’ll be no trace you’ve ever 
visited.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
220	
chapter	 9
• Desktop view. When you browse the Web with your S5, you’ll often come to 
versions of sites optimized for its small screen. But there may be times when 
you want to see the full-blown site. If that happens, tap the checkbox in this 
option, and you’ll see the whole shebang of the website. To switch back, 
get back to the menu and uncheck the box. When you select this option, it 
doesn’t affect any other website, only the one you’re visiting.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
The Web 	
221
 NOTE 	 Some sites don’t have versions optimized for smartphone screens. When you’re 
visiting one of those, you see the page just as you see it on a larger computer, and the 
Desktop view option is grayed out.
• Brightness. Lets you select the screen brightness. A screen with a slider 
appears, which lets you set the brightness level. You can also leave the 
checkbox next to “Automatic brightness,” and the S5 will adjust the light 
level for you based on ambient light.
Selecting and Copying Text
AS YOU BROWSE THE Web, you may also come across text on a website that 
you want to use elsewhere, say in an email or a document. It’s easy. First, hold 
your finger on the text you want to copy. A magnifying glass appears. This tool 
makes it easy to maneuver to the exact text you want to copy. Move it by mov­
ing your finger, and then release it on the word you want to copy. If you want 
to copy more than one word (and you likely will), don’t worry—just release your 
finger when it’s on one of the words you want to copy.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
222	
chapter	 9
When you release your finger, brackets appear around the word, and a tool­
bar appears with six icons: Select all, Copy, Share via, Dictionary, Find, and 
Web search. Move the brackets until they surround the all the text you want to 
copy. Tap “Select all” to select all the text on the page. Select Copy to copy the 
highlighted text to the Clipboard. You get a notification that the text was copied. 
You can now paste it into an email, a document, and so on. Tap “Share via,” and 
you’ll be able to share your selection either as text or as an image file. You’ll 
be able to share it via Bluetooth, email, text message, and more, depending on 
what you’ve got installed on your S5. Tap Dictionary to look up the text in an 
online dictionary. Tap Find to find other mentions of text on the page. And tap 
“Web search” to launch a Google search for the text on the Web.
Online Privacy and Security
WHETHER YOU BROWSE THE Web with a computer or with the Galaxy S5, 
there are potential security and privacy dangers out there—cookies, pop-ups, 
and malicious websites. So the S5 browser, just like its big-brother browsers 
on computers, includes the tools you need to keep you safe and protect your 
privacy when you browse the Web.
Pop-up Blocker
What’s top on your list of web annoyances? Most likely at the pinnacle are pop-
ups and pop-unders—ugly little windows and ads that either take an in-your-face 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
The Web 	
223
stance by popping up over your browser so that you have to pay attention, or 
pop under your browser so that you don’t notice they’re there until you close a 
browser window, and then they demand your attention.
Sometimes these pop-ups and pop-unders are malicious, and if you tap them 
they attempt to install dangerous software or send you to a malicious website. 
Sometimes they’re merely annoying ads. Sometimes, though, they may actually 
be useful, like a pop-up that shows a seating chart when you’re visiting a ticket-
buying site. The browser includes a pop-up blocker, and like all pop-up blockers, 
it can’t necessarily distinguish between bad pop-ups and pop-unders and good 
ones, so it blocks them all.
However, if you’re on a website that uses pop-ups that you want to see, you can 
turn off the pop-up blocker. From the Apps screen select Settings, scroll down 
to the Applications area, and tap Internet→“Content settings,” and then uncheck 
the box next to “Block pop-ups.” When you leave the site and want pop-ups 
blocked again, go back to the setting and tap it to turn it on. A green checkmark 
appears next to the setting, and you are protected.
 NOTE 	 When you turn off the pop-up blocker, it stops blocking pop-ups in all your 
browser windows, not just on one site. So be careful when you browse other places on the 
Web when the pop-up blocker is turned off.

chapter	 9
Cookies
Cookies are tiny bits of information that some websites store on the Galaxy 
S5 for future use. When you register for a website and create a user name and 
password, the website can store that information in a cookie so you don’t have 
to retype it every time. Cookies can also remember your habits and preferences 
when you use a website—your favorite shipping method, or what kinds of news 
articles you’re likely to read. But not all cookies are innocuous, since they can 
also track your web browsing from multiple sites and potentially invade your 
privacy.
The browser gives you control over how you handle cookies—you can either 
accept them or tell the browser to reject them. Keep in mind that if you don’t 
allow cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of cookie-based features 
on many sites—like remembering items in your cart on a shopping site.
To bar websites from putting cookies on your S5, from the Apps screen select 
Settings, scroll down to the Applications area, tap Internet→“Content settings,” 
and then uncheck the box next to “Accept cookies.” The checkmark disappears 
and, from now on, no cookies will be put on your Galaxy S5. You can always turn 
this setting back on again, if it causes problems with web browsing.
Privacy Settings
If you’re worried about privacy, there are a number of browser settings you can 
change. From the Apps screen select Settings, scroll down to the Applications 
area, and tap Internet→Privacy. From here there are a number of things you 
can do to make sure your privacy isn’t invaded. For example, you can clear your 
browsing history so that others who use the browser can’t see where you’ve 
been.
At many websites, you log in by typing a user name and password, and other 
information such as your address. The browser remembers those user names, 
passwords, and other details, and fills them in for you automatically when you 
next visit. That’s convenient, but it also presents a privacy risk, because some­
one else using your Galaxy S5 can log in as you. So in the Privacy settings, turn 
off the checkbox next to “Remember passwords.”
If you turn off “Suggest search terms and Web sites,” you won’t be sending 
what you search to Google, but you won’t get suggestions, either. Also, normally 
when you type information into web forms, your browser remembers it so that 
it can put that information in other forms automatically. But if that worries you, 
uncheck the box next to “Remember form data.”
www.it-ebooks.info

225
You can also clear out website information your browser has stored on your S5. 
Tap “Delete personal data,” and then select the kinds of data you want deleted 
from your phone, such as your browsing history, cookies, passwords, and so on. 
You also have a chance to clean out your cache. The cache is information the 
browser stored on your phone so it won’t have to get that information from the 
Web the next time you visit that site. The cache speeds up browsing, since it’s 
faster to grab the information—a website image, for example—from your phone 
than from the Web. Delete the cache if you want to clear all that information out, 
if you worry that the information there poses a privacy risk.

YOU WANT EMAIL? YOU’VE got email. The Galaxy S5 does a great job of han­
dling whatever email task you throw at it. Want to send and receive attachments 
like pictures; Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files; and PDFs? The S5 can do that. 
How about working with just about any email service out there? It can do that, 
too. You can also manage your mail, sync your mail, and plenty more right on 
your phone. It’s a great way to have your email always in your pocket.
Understanding Email on the Galaxy S5
THE GALAXY S5 RUNS on Google’s Android operating system (described in 
the box on page 26), so it comes as no surprise that it includes Gmail built into 
it. You don’t have to use Gmail if you don’t want to, though; you can use your 
current email service instead. Or you can use both. Gmail on the S5 works a bit 
differently from other email services, so this chapter covers Gmail as well as 
regular email.
 NOTE 	 The Email icon on your Home screen is Android’s app for handling other email 
accounts, not Gmail. Gmail has its own app, which you can find in the Apps screen, as 
described in the next section. If you’d like to get started with a different email account 
(your work or home account, for example), flip to page 245.

Setting Up Gmail
ANDROID IS BUILT FROM the ground up to integrate with Google services—
search, Google Maps, and Gmail. If you already have a Gmail account, then when 
you set up your Galaxy S5, you tie into that account. If you don’t have a Gmail 
account, you first need to set one up.
 NOTE 	 When you first bring your S5 home, you may already be set up to use Gmail. 
Your wireless company’s sales staff may have set up your Gmail account right in the store 
for you.
When you use the Gmail app on your S5, it synchronizes with your web-based 
Gmail. So when you delete an email on the phone, for example, it deletes it on 
the web-based Gmail; when you create and send an email on your phone, it 
shows up in your Sent folder on the Web; and so on.
Signing up for a Gmail account is free and takes only a few minutes. You can cre­
ate it on the Web or on the S5. To do it on the Web, head to www.gmail.com. Fill 
in the usual information, such as first and last name, login name, and password. 
The login name you choose becomes your email address. So if you use the login 
name petey.bigtoes, then your email address will be petey.bigtoes@gmail.com. 
So make your login name something pleasant and easy to remember.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Email and Gmail 	
229
 NOTE 	 When you create a Gmail account, you’re actually setting up an account for all 
of Google’s services, not just Gmail. You use the same account to access Google Calendar, 
Google+, Google Drive, Google Play, and so on. In other words, if you have a Google Calen­
dar account, then you already have a Gmail account. Use that information when setting up 
Gmail on your Galaxy S5.
Now that you have a Gmail account, you’re ready to set up Gmail on your S5. 
When you set up your Gmail account, you’ll also be setting up your Calendar 
account and importing your Gmail contacts into your Galaxy S5. On the Apps 
screen, tap the Gmail icon. After a brief welcome screen, Gmail asks whether 
you have a Google account. If you haven’t already set one up, tap New, and then 
fill in the information required. Make sure to leave the box next to “Automatically 
configure account” turned on. That way, the S5 will do all the heavy lifting of 
properly configuring your new account.
 TIP 	 If you plan to use Gmail a lot, drag its icon from the Apps screen to your Home 
screen.
If you already have a Gmail account, tap Existing. Enter your Gmail address and 
the other basic information. If you have a Google Contact list, the S5 automati­
cally starts downloading it in the background, and also syncs your mail.
 NOTE 	 What if you have multiple Gmail accounts? You can have the Galaxy S5 handle 
more than one. To set up a second account, go to the Apps screen and tap Settings→ 
Accounts→Add Account→Google and follow the directions for setting up an account. If 
you prefer, you can also use the S5’s browser (Chapter 9) to visit Gmail and access your 
other accounts that way.
Reading Mail in Gmail
ONCE YOU’VE GOT YOUR Gmail account set up, it’s time to start reading mail. 
Launch the Gmail app by tapping it on the Apps screen. You see a list of emails, 
but the list you see depends on what you were doing the last time you were 
using Gmail. For example, if the last time you used Gmail you were in your inbox, 
you see all the mail in your inbox. If you were viewing mail in a different label 
(the term Gmail uses for a folder), you see just the mail in that label.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
230	
chapter	 10
 NOTE 	 While most email programs use folders to let you organize your email, Google 
uses labels in its web-based email, and that’s what you use on the Galaxy S5.
Most of the time, of course, you’ll land in your inbox, which lists all your mail. 
Mail you haven’t read is boldfaced and has a white background; the rest of your 
mail is in a normal font and has a gray background. At the top of the list of mail, 
you’ll see a couple of buttons, labeled Social and Promotions, followed by a 
number indicating how many messages fall into that category. Social refers to all 
mail related to your social media accounts; Promotions refers to newsletters and 
advertising. Tap either to see all the mail in that category.
The S5 regularly checks your Gmail account for new mail, and if it finds any, it 
displays an email icon in the status bar. Pull down the Notification panel, and 
then tap the Gmail notification to launch Gmail.
When you’re viewing mail in a list like this, each piece of mail shows the 
following:
• The sender
 NOTE 	 If the sender is one of your contacts and you have a photo for him (or if he’s a 
friend on Facebook with a photo), you’ll see a photo of him at the far left of each email. If 
he’s not a contact, or is but you don’t have a photo of him, you see a big letter—that’s the 
first letter of his name.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Email and Gmail 	
231
• The subject line
• The date it was sent or, if it was sent today, the time it was sent
• Whether it has an attachment
• Whether it has images
To open a message, tap it. Scroll up, down, and sideways in the message using 
the normal Galaxy S5 gestures of dragging and flicking.
All the links you see in the email message are live—tap them, and you go to the 
linked web page in the Galaxy S5’s web browser. Tap an email address, and a 
new email message opens to that address. Tap a YouTube video, and the video 
plays.
In fact, in many instances, the text in the email message doesn’t even need to be 
a link for the phone to take some kind of action on it. If there’s a phone number 
in an email, tap it to call that number. Just tap the phone button to dial. If you 
tap a street address, the S5 shows you that location in Google Maps.
 NOTE 	 Gmail, Google Calendar, and your Gmail contacts are all set up to sync between 
your S5 and your various Google accounts on the Web. All of this happens automatically, 
in the background, without you having to take any action. You can turn syncing off or 
choose to sync manually. For details, see page 382.

chapter	 10
Handling Graphics in Gmail
There are two basic kinds of graphics you may get in Gmail. Some are embed­
ded in the content of the message itself—for example, a company logo. Other 
times, the sender attaches the image to the message, like a family member 
sending you Thanksgiving photos.
If the graphics are embedded in the content of the message, you’ll see the 
graphics themselves, right where the sender put them.
    
If someone has attached a graphic, you see the graphic displayed in the email 
message, a thumbnail of the image being sent. 
To save the picture to your Galaxy S5, first tap the thumbnail to display it. Tap 
the screen, and you see information about the picture, including its filename. 
Tap the Menu button at top right, and you can save the picture to the Gallery 
and share it with others via email, Bluetooth, cloud storage, and perhaps other 
ways, depending on what apps you have installed on your S5. (For details about 
the Gallery, turn to page 115.)

Email and Gmail 	
233
Attachments in Gmail
Gmail lets you download graphics attachments, including those in the .jpg, .png, 
and .gif formats as well as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files. It lets you preview 
those files and other file types as well.
If you get an attachment that you can preview, you see a paper clip icon near 
the bottom of the message. The attachment’s name appears next to the paper 
clip icon. Tap the paper clip to download it. If it’s a Word, Excel, or PowerPoint 
file, it opens in any of a number of apps that can open or read the file, depend­
ing on what you have installed on your S5: Google’s Quickoffice, Microsoft’s 
Office Mobile, POLARIS Office, or others. If you have more than one of these 
apps installed, you’ll get a screen asking which you want to use, and whether to 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
234	
chapter	 10
use it just this one time or always. When you’re done reading the file, you can 
save it (via the app) to whatever location you want.
    
If you want to save the attachment without first reading it, tap the three dots 
next to it and select Save. It will be saved in the Gallery’s Downloads album.
Information about the Sender
If you want to get information about the sender of the message, tap the person’s 
picture or icon. If that person is in your Contacts, the Contact information screen 
(page 79) opens up. (If the person isn’t in your Contacts, nothing happens.)
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Email and Gmail 	
235
Replying and Forwarding in Gmail
NEAR THE TOP OF the screen in Gmail, next to the sender’s name, you’ll find a 
small toolbar of icons for replying to and forwarding mail:
• Star. Adds a star to the message in the email list to call your attention to it 
later. You can use stars to flag messages that contain important information, 
say, or those that require further research. If the message already displays a 
star, tap it to remove it.
• Reply. Replies to the message’s sender only. A new email window opens, 
addressed to the sender, with the original email text quoted in it. (If there’s 
an attachment in the original email, it won’t be included.)
• More options. This launches a menu that lets you reply to all recipients of 
the message (not just the sender), forward the message to someone else, or 
print it.
• Expand header. Tap the small down arrow just beneath the toolbar, and the 
message header expands—you’ll see the full email addresses of all message 
recipients, as well as the date and time that the message was sent.
Understanding Gmail’s Organization
GMAIL HAS ITS OWN terminology and worldview when it comes to handling 
email, so you have some new terms and ideas to get used to. Here are the most 
common Gmail concepts:
• Labels. Think of these as email folders. Your regular email program has a 
folder called Inbox, for example, and lets you create other folders, such as 
Family, Work, and so on. Gmail calls these email containers labels.
That said, there’s a slight underlying difference between the way you work 
with Gmail’s labels and how you work with another email program’s folders. 
In your typical email program, you might move mail between folders by 
dragging them. Not so in Gmail. In Gmail, you affix a label to an email 
message. When you do that, that email automatically appears when you sort 
for that label.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
236	
chapter	 10
 NOTE 	 If you use Google Hangouts, either on a computer or on your Galaxy S5, the 
conversations you have will show up in your Chats label.
Labels actually give you more flexibility than folders, since you can attach 
multiple labels to a single email message to have it show up in multiple 
labels. For example, if you get an email from your brother about advice for 
your upcoming trip to France, you can add the labels Family and France 
to the email. That email then shows up in both your Family label and your 
France label.
 TIP 	 The Gmail app on the S5 is designed to work in concert with Gmail on the Web. So 
you can’t do everything in the Gmail app that you can do on the Web. The Gmail app can’t 
create labels, for example, so to create new ones, you must visit your Gmail account on 
the Web, using either the S5 browser or a computer.
• Overall mail organization. Because Gmail uses labels rather than folders, 
you may find mail in more than one location. Also, unlike some email soft­
ware, Gmail gives you the option of viewing all mail in one single area titled 
“All mail,” including mail you’ve archived and all other mail.
• Archive. In some instances, you’ll get mail that you want to keep around but 
don’t want showing up in your inbox, because your inbox would otherwise 
get too cluttered. So Gmail lets you archive messages. Archiving a message 
doesn’t delete it, but it removes it from your inbox. You can still find the 
message listed in your “All mail” folder. You can also find it by searching. 
Managing Incoming Mail in Gmail
ONCE YOU’VE READ A Gmail message, it’s time to decide what to do with it. 
At the top of your screen when you’re reading email, you’ll find three buttons 
that can help:
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Email and Gmail 	
237
• Archive. This button appears if you haven’t given the email a label. Tap the 
button to archive the message. It vanishes from your inbox but still appears 
in “All mail.”
• Delete. Deletes the message. What if you tap this button accidentally? No 
problem. For the next few moments, an Undo button appears at the bot­
tom of the screen. Tap it to undelete the message. What if you delete the 
message, don’t undo it, but later on decide you wished you hadn’t done it? 
Google still has your back. The message still actually exists—in your Trash 
folder. Go to the folder (page 244), and you can read it there or undelete it 
by moving it to a new folder. However, it stays there for only 30 days. After 
that, it’s gone forever.
• Inbox. This doesn’t help in managing your mail. It just scoots you straight to 
your inbox.
But wait, as they say in late-night commercials, there’s more! Tap the Menu but­
ton and you get these options as well:
• Move to. Even if you haven’t applied a label to a piece of mail in your inbox, 
it already has a label preapplied to it—Inbox. Tap this button to change the 
message’s label. When you tap the button, a screen appears with all your 
labels on it. The labels for the mail you’re reading have green checkmarks 
next to them. Add checkmarks for all the labels you want to add, and remove 
checks for labels you want to remove.
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 10
• Change labels. What gives? This sounds a lot like the “Move to” option—and 
it is. But there’s a minor difference. With “Move to,” you can move the mail to 
more labels than you can with “Change labels.”
• Mark important/Mark not important. Google watches your mail usage 
and marks some mail as important. If you’re reading a message considered 
important, you can change it to “not important.” And if you’re reading a 
message considered not important, you can change it to important.
• Mute. Tap this button, and the email and all conversations related to it 
bypass your inbox and are automatically archived. When you mute a piece of 
mail, you’re not just archiving that one piece of mail, but the entire “conver­
sation” of which it’s a part. Let’s say, for example, you subscribe to a mailing 
list, and there is a long, ongoing series of back-and-forth emails about a 
topic in which you have no interest. (Justin Bieber, anyone?) You’re tired of 
seeing emails in that conversation pop up in your inbox. Tap the Mute but­
ton, and you won’t see it in your inbox anymore. It will, however, still appear 
in “All mail.”
• Print all. Prints the entire message.
• Report spam. Tap the “Report spam” button, and a note goes to Google, 
saying you believe the email is spam. Google uses that information to deter­
mine which mail should be considered spam and be automatically rerouted 
into people’s Spam label.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Email and Gmail 	
239
 NOTE 	 When you get a message that Gmail considers spam, it isn’t automatically de­
leted. Instead, it shows up in your Spam label. It doesn’t appear in “All mail,” or anywhere 
else in Gmail. It also doesn’t appear when you search through your email.
• Report phishing. Tap this, and a note goes to Google saying you believe 
the email is a nasty piece of work known as a phishing attack. In this kind 
of scam, you receive an email that looks legitimate—from your bank, for 
example—but in fact it’s from someone who’s trying to trick you into reveal­
ing personal information such as your bank login information. When you 
click a link in the email, you’re sent to a site that looks like the real site, but in 
fact is one set up only to grab your information.
• Settings. Sends you to a screen that lets you change your Gmail settings, 
including adding a new account.
 TIP 	 Mail stays in your inbox until you take away the Inbox label. So if you want to keep 
your inbox clean, remove the Inbox label from incoming email regularly. It’s a good idea 
to add other labels to your messages, though, so you can easily find them later.
• Send feedback. Tell Google what you think of Gmail.
• Help. Get technical help with Gmail.
Managing Multiple Email Messages
You can also handle groups of messages rather than individual ones. To do that, 
first you need to group them all. Hold your finger in turn on each message that 
you want to take action on in a group. Each message gets a check put next to it, 
and the top of your screen shows how many you’ve put in the group. Now use 
the icons at the top of the screen for managing them all, such as moving them, 
archiving them, deleting them, changing their labels, and so on. To get to the full 
list of actions, tap the three stacked squares on the far right of the screen.
 NOTE 	 If you’re viewing a different label from Inbox, not all these options may appear 
when you press the Menu key; the options that appear vary from label to label. To access 
all the options, just go back to your inbox.

Writing Messages in Gmail
WHEN YOU WANT TO create a new Gmail message, start from the inbox and 
then press the Compose button at the top of the screen—it’s a plus sign on an 
envelope. A new, blank message form opens, and the keyboard appears so you 
can start typing.
 NOTE 	 If you want a larger keyboard, turn your Galaxy S5 90 degrees.
Write your message this way:
1.	Type the recipient’s address in the To field. As you type, Gmail looks 
through your Contacts list, as well as the list of people you’ve sent email to 
in the past, and displays any matches. (Gmail matches the first few letters 
of first names as well as last names as you type.) If you find a match, tap it 
instead of typing the rest of the address. You can add as many addresses as 
you wish.
2.	Send copies to other recipients. Press the Menu button, and tap Add Cc/
Bcc from the menu that appears. Two new lines appear beneath the To 
field—Cc and Bcc.
Anyone whose email address you put in the Cc and Bcc boxes gets a copy of 
the email message. The difference is that while everyone can see all the Cc 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Email and Gmail 	
241
recipients, the Bcc copy is sent in private. None of the other recipients can 
see the email addresses you enter in the Bcc field.
 NOTE 	 The term carbon copy comes from those long-gone days in the previous century 
when people typed mail, documents, and memos on an ancient device called a type­
writer. To make multiple copies, typists added a sheet of carbon paper and another sheet 
of typing paper. The force of the keys striking the paper would imprint ink on the second 
sheet, using the ink in the carbon paper.
3.	Type the topic of the message into the Subject field. A clear, concise sub­
ject line is a good thing for both you and your recipient, so you can immedi­
ately see what the message is about when you scan your inbox.
4.	Type your message into the Compose email box. Type as you would in any 
other text field. You can also use copy and paste.
5.	Add an attachment. To add an attachment, tap the Menu button and then 
tap “Attach file.” You’ll come to a list of locations where you have files, 
including the Gallery, your Documents folder, Google Drive, and more. Tap 
the location, and then select the file to attach. You’ll see a thumbnail of your 
attachment right in the message. Tap the X button if you want to remove the 
attachment. You can keep adding attachments, if you want.

chapter	 10
6.	Tap the send icon at the top right of the screen, and the message gets sent 
immediately. If you instead want to save the message as a draft, tap the 
Menu button and select “Save draft.” If you’d prefer to call the whole thing 
off and get rid of the draft, tap the Menu key and select Discard, which gets 
rid of the message for good.
Adding a Signature
The Gmail app can automatically add a signature—your contact information, for 
example—at the bottom of every outgoing message. To create a signature of 
your own, from the inbox, tap the Menu button and then select Settings, tap the 
name of your account, and then tap Signature. Type a signature, tap OK, and the 
signature will be appended to the bottom of all messages you send.
 NOTE 	 The signature will be appended to the bottom of outgoing Gmail, but not your 
other email accounts. You need to set up signatures separately for each email account.
Working with Labels and Search
LABELS ARE AN EXCELLENT way to organize your email in Gmail, because 
they’re far more flexible than folders. A single message can appear in as many 
or as few labels as you want.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Email and Gmail 	
243
To go to a different label from the one you’re currently in, tap the icon next to 
the label at the top left. You see a listing of every one of your labels. Scroll to 
see all of them. Gmail automatically creates the following labels for you:
• Inbox contains all your incoming messages. There may be categories within 
it, such as Social and Promotions (page 230).
• Starred shows all the messages you’ve starred.
• Important shows all the messages you’ve tagged as being important.
• Chats contains the contents of all chats done via Google Hangouts.
• Sent lists all messages you’ve sent.
• Outbox shows mail you’ve created and asked Gmail to send, but that has not 
yet been sent.
• Drafts contains mail you’ve created but not completed.
• All mail contains all mail and chats, except for Spam and Trash. It also 
includes mail that you’ve archived.
• Spam contains all mail marked as spam, either by you or by Google.
 NOTE 	 You can remove mail from Spam by going into the Spam label, reading a mes­
sage, and tapping “Remove label” from the bottom of the screen.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
244	
chapter	 10
• Trash contains mail you’ve deleted but that hasn’t been removed from the 
trash yet. Email is removed from the trash when it’s more than 30 days old.
 NOTE 	 If you use Gmail’s Priority Inbox on the Web, you’ll also see a label here called 
Important, which shows all the messages that Gmail has flagged as being important to 
you. For details about how Priority Inbox works, and to set it up on the Web, go to http://
bit.ly/14GiCXL.
If you’ve created any labels other than these, using Gmail on the Web, then you 
see them here as well. You can’t create new labels in Gmail on the Galaxy S5. 
To create a new label, visit Gmail on the Web, using your phone’s browser or a 
computer.
To see your labels, when you’re in the inbox, swipe in from the left.
Searching Gmail
GOOGLE MAKES WHAT MANY consider the best search engine on the planet, 
so it’s no surprise that it builds Google Search into Gmail on the Galaxy S5. 
Searching is straightforward. To search, tap the Search button. As you type, 
Gmail displays previous searches you’ve done that match those letters and nar­
rows the search as you type. If you see a search term you want to use, tap it. If 
not, type the entire search term, and then tap Search.
After you enter your search terms, you see a display of all matching email. Gmail 
searches through the To, From, and Subject fields, as well as the messages’ text. 
In the upper-left corner, you see the search term you entered.
Advanced Gmail Searching
Gmail lets you do some pretty fancy searching—after all, Google is the search 
king. So you can search by To, From, Subject, specific labels, and a lot more. Say 
you want to search for all email with the word “Halloween” in the subject line. 
Type the following in the search box:
Subject:Halloween
You can search other Gmail fields, as shown in the following list (head to http://
tinyurl.com/gmail-search for a more complete list):
• From. Searches for mail from a specific sender.
• To. Searches mail for a specific recipient.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Email and Gmail 	
245
• Subject. Searches the subject lines.
• In <label>. Searches in a specific label.
You can combine these search terms with one another, and with a search of the 
text of the message. So to search for all email in your Work label with the word 
“budget” in it, you’d do this search:
In:Work Budget
Setting Up Email Accounts
YOU’RE NOT CONFINED TO using Gmail on the Galaxy S5—you can use your 
other email accounts as well. How you set one up depends upon what kind of 
email account you want to add.
To get started, tap the Email icon. Fill in your email address and password, and 
then tap Next. If you’re setting up a web-based mail account like Yahoo Mail or 
Microsoft’s web-based mail (find it at Outlook.com or Hotmail.com), the S5 is 
smart enough to do all your setup for you, including your incoming and outgo­
ing mail servers. After a moment or two, it makes sure everything is working 
properly and then sends you to a page with your various account options, such 
as how you want to sync emails between the Web and your S5, whether to 
notify you when mail arrives, and so on. Most of the time, your best bet is to 
stick with the options the S5 picks for you—it’s plenty smart about making the 
right choices.
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 10
POP3 and IMAP Accounts
If you instead want to set up a general email account, such as from your Internet 
service provider (ISP), after you fill in your email address and password and tap 
Next, you’ll come to a screen that asks what type of account you want to add—a 
POP account, an IMAP account, or a Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync account.
 TIP 	 If it’s a Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync account, it’s likely a work account. For 
details on how to set up ActiveSync and other corporate options, see Chapter 14.
As for POP and IMAP, that’s techie talk for two different kinds of email services. 
Here’s what you need to know about each before making your choice:
• With a POP (Post Office Protocol) account, the POP server delivers email 
to your inbox. From then on, the messages live on your Galaxy S5—or your 
home computer, or whichever machine you used to check email. You can’t 
download another copy of that email, because POP servers let you download 
a message only once. So if you use your account on both a computer and 
your S5, you must be careful to set up the account properly, as described 
in the box on page 248, so you won’t accidentally delete email. Despite this 
caveat, POP accounts remain the most popular type of email accounts and 
are generally the easiest to set up and use.
• With an IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) account, the server 
doesn’t send you the mail and force you to store it on your computer or 
phone. Instead, it keeps all your mail on the server, so you can access the 
exact same mail from your S5 and your computer—or even from multiple 
devices. The IMAP server always remembers what you’ve done with your 
mail—what messages you’ve read and sent, your folder organization, and so 
on. So if you read mail, send mail, and reorganize your folders on your S5, 
when you then check your mail on a computer, you’ll see all those changes, 
and vice versa.
That’s the good news. The bad news is that if you don’t remember to regu­
larly clean out your mail, your mailbox can overflow if your account doesn’t 
have enough storage to hold it all. If your IMAP account gets full, then when 
people send you email, their messages bounce back to them.
 NOTE 	 With the exception of a Gmail account, only accounts that have been previously 
set up can be added to your Galaxy S5. If you get a new email account at work or home, 
get it all set up before you add it to your phone.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Email and Gmail 	
247
Choose which type of account you want to use. In some cases, your ISP will let 
you use either IMAP or POP, but in other cases, it will require you to use one or 
the other. So check with your ISP. After you choose your account type, the S5 
attempts to automatically configure your email account for you. Most of the time 
it will be able to figure out your settings, but sometimes it fails. In that case, it 
shows you a screen where you need to fill in techie details, such as server names 
for the outgoing mail server (SMTP), whether you use POP3 or IMAP, the incom­
ing mail server name, and so on. If you don’t have the information at hand (and 
face it, who does?), check with your ISP or your corporate tech support staff.
Depending on the kind of account you set up, you may come to a screen with 
options like whether you want to be notified when email arrives, for how long to 
sync your email, and so on. You may find that the S5’s choices work just fine for 
you, but if not, make whatever changes you want and tap Next. You’ll be asked 
to give it an account name or leave it as is. Tap Done. 
 TIP 	 If you’re already using an email program on your computer, that means you’ve 
set up the account there, and its settings are in the email program. So go to the account 
settings on your computer, and grab the information from there.

chapter	 10
Keeping Your POP Mailboxes in Sync
The difference between POP and IMAP 
accounts is that POP email lives only on 
whatever machine you download it to. 
With IMAP, a copy automatically remains 
on the server so you can download it 
again on another device. Say you read 
incoming email on your Galaxy S5, delete 
some of it, keep some of it, and write 
some new messages. Later that day, you 
go to your desktop computer and log 
into the same email account. You won’t 
see those incoming messages you read 
on your phone, nor the ones you sent 
from it.
When you’re using both your phone and 
home computer to work with the same 
POP account, how do you keep them in 
sync? By making your POP account act 
more like an IMAP account, so it leaves 
a copy of all messages on the server 
when you download them to your home 
computer. That way, you can delete mes-
sages on the Galaxy S5 and still see them 
in your inbox at home.
In Outlook 2013, choose File→Account 
Settings→Account Settings and then 
double-click the account name. Select 
More Settings→Advanced. Turn on 
“Leave a copy of each message on the 
server.” Also turn on “Remove from 
server when deleted from “Deleted 
items” so you won’t fill up the server 
space allocated to your account. (In 
Outlook 2010, this setting is called 
“Delete messages from server after they 
are deleted from this computer.”)
In Outlook 2011 for Mac, choose Tools→ 
Accounts, choose the POP account in the 
left column, and then click Advanced 
at lower right. Turn on “Leave a copy of 
each message on the server,” and also 
turn on “Delete copies from the server 
after deleting from this computer.”
To get to these settings in earlier ver-
sions of Outlook, choose Tools→ 
E-mail Accounts→E-Mail→“View 
or Change Email Accounts”→your 
account name→Change→More 
Settings→Advanced.
WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
Reading Mail
ON THE GALAXY S5, reading email on a non-Gmail account is much like read­
ing Gmail. In the Apps menu, tap Email to launch the Email app, and it sends you 
to your inbox immediately and downloads any waiting mail. As with Gmail, the 
Email app displays the subject line, time and date of delivery, and the sender of 
each message.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Email and Gmail 	
249
 NOTE 	 This section covers a Microsoft Outlook.com account. If you use a different ISP, 
the screens and options may vary somewhat from what you see here, but generally things 
work the same.
 NOTE 	 If you’re using a POP 3 account and you’ve organized your mail into folders on 
your computer, that organization won’t be reflected on the Galaxy S5. You won’t be able 
to see or use the folders from your computer’s email software.
To read a message, tap it. At the bottom of the screen are icons that take you to 
the next and previous messages, for deleting mail and for replying to or for­
warding mail. If the sender is a contact for whom you have a picture, his picture 
will show up next to his name in the From area.
But there’s a whole lot more you can do with your mail message than that. Tap 
the Menu button next to the sender’s name, and you’ll get the following choices, 
which will vary according to whether you’re checking mail from an ISP or web-
based mail, and according to the web-based mail program you’re using:
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 10
    
• Mark as unread. When you look in your inbox, the mail will appear bold-
faced, as if you hadn’t yet read it.
• Move. Lets you move the message to another folder.
• Save email. Lets you save the mail locally on your S5. It’s saved in a file 
that ends in .eml. You’ll be able to read the mail by using a file manager and 
browsing to the My Files folder (page 324).
• Register as spam. Considers the mail as spam. The sender also will be sent 
to your spam list, so all new mail coming from him will be considered spam.
• Add to priority senders/Remove from priority senders. When you add 
someone to your priority senders, whenever mail shows up in your inbox 
from the person, an orange icon appears next to his name, indicating that 
his mail is important. If someone is already a priority sender, select “Remove 
from priority senders,” and his mail will instead be treated like everyone 
else’s in the world.
• Print. Prints the mail to a wirelessly available printer.
There’s still more you can do. There’s another Menu button, just above this one, 
at the top of the screen, with these three settings:
• Font size. Lets you choose a larger or smaller font size for easier reading.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Email and Gmail 	
251
• Settings. Brings you to the general setting screen for the mail account. From 
here, you can make many changes to things such as whether you want a 
confirmation screen flashed before you can delete an email, and so on.
• Help. Gets you help.
Handling Attachments and 
Pictures in Email
MORE AND MORE EMAIL messages contain pictures. Sometimes, the picture 
is in the content of the message itself, such as a company logo. Other times, 
the picture is an attachment, like a family photo. Email handles the two types of 
graphics differently.
If the graphics are embedded in the content of the message, you’ll see a “Show 
images” button at the top of the mail, and where the photos would normally 
be, you’ll see text. Tap “Show images,” and the photos appear right in the mail, 
where they were placed.
    
If someone has sent an email and attached a picture, you’ll see an icon that 
looks like a paper clip, and next to it the size of the file. Tap it and two but­
tons appear—Preview and Save. Tap the Preview button, and the image gets 
downloaded so you can preview it. Depending on the size of the photo, it might 
take some time. You’ll see the progress as it downloads. After it downloads, the

photo opens in the Gallery, as any photo normally does, or if you have multiple 
photo apps, you get a choice of which to use. If it’s a wide photo, you can rotate 
the phone 90 degrees and see the full picture as the phone switches to its wider 
orientation.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Email and Gmail 	
253
Attachments in Email
When you receive an email attachment in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or some 
other file types, you can preview and download it. You handle these attach­
ments in the same way you handle pictures. The attachment button shows up in 
the email, and when you tap it you can preview it or save it in the same way you 
can a photo. If it’s a Word, Excel, or PowerPoint file, the preview opens in an app 
called Polaris Office that’s built into the Galaxy S5.
Adding the Sender to Your Contacts
If you get a message from someone and would like to add her to your Contacts 
list, open the email and then tap the picture of the sender’s name. A screen 
appears that lets you create a new contact with the sender’s name and email 
address, or send email to that contact. If you tap the name of someone who is 
already a contact, you’ll see a button that lets you view that contact’s informa­
tion and take action on it, such as sending an email, making a phone call, and 
so on.

chapter	 10
Managing Mail
WHEN YOU’RE IN YOUR inbox, you’ve got more options for managing your 
mail. Tap the Menu button, and a menu appears with these options:
• Select. Displays your inbox with checks next to your mail. Turn on the check­
boxes next to mail you want to select, and then perform an action on them, 
such as deleting them.
• Filter by. Lets you sort your email in several different ways: unread mail, 
read mail, flagged mail, and so on.
 NOTE 	 The options that appear here vary according to whether you’re reading mail 
from an ISP or web-based mail, and according to what web-based mail service you use.
• View mode. Lets you choose the traditional way of viewing mail (sorted by 
date and such) or by “Conversation view,” which groups entire conversations 
together. Conversation view takes some getting used to, but it’s the best 
way to track a message trail.
• Compose event invitation. If you use a mail service like Hotmail.com or 
Outlook.com that also includes a calendar, you can create meeting invita­
tions by choosing this.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Email and Gmail 	
255
• Documents. If you use Hotmail.com or Outlook.com, this lets you view docu­
ments from a Microsoft file service such as SharePoint Services. If you don’t 
know what that is, you don’t need to use this option.
• Font size. Changes the font size of your messages.
• Delete. As with Select, this displays your inbox with checks next to your 
mail. Check the boxes next to messages you want to delete and then delete 
them.
• Delete all. Think of this as a nuclear option. It deletes all your email. Don’t 
do it.
• Settings. Brings you to a settings screen for the email account.
• Help. Need help with your email service? Here’s where to get it.
You’ve got even more options than that. Look down at the bottom of the screen. 
You’ll see a bar with four icons. The leftmost one lets you create a new mail mes­
sage; the one to its right checks for new mail. The one in the shape of a mag­
nifying glass lets you search mail. And the one on the far right that looks like a 
folder displays all your folders for the mail service you’re currently using. Tap 
any folder to go to it.
Creating and Sending Mail
TO CREATE A NEW email message, when you’re in the inbox or any folder, tap 
the pencil-and-paper icon in the lower left of the screen. If you want to create 
a new message when you’re reading an email, tap the Menu key and then tap 
Compose.
You create a new email message in nearly the identical way in the Email app as 
you do in the Gmail app, so go to page 240 for details about filling in the To, 
Subject, and other fields.
Adding a Signature
When you send an email, the Galaxy S5 appends text to the bottom of it but will 
read something like: “Sent from my T-Mobile 4G LTE Device.” That text is visible 
as you type, and you can delete it if you want. In fact, you may want to delete it 
from every message and use some text of your own there instead—your email 
signature.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
256	
chapter	 10
To add a signature to all your outgoing mail or to delete the built-in text at the 
bottom of the screen from all outgoing mail from any email service, in the inbox 
tap the Menu button, select Settings→Manage Accounts, and then tap the name 
of the account. Tap the Signature setting. To stop the built-in signature from 
being sent on all messages, from the screen that appears, switch the setting 
from On to Off. To create a new signature, tap “Edit Signature,” type the text 
you wish to use, and then tap Done.

The changes will affect all the email messages you send with the Email app. 
(The signature you make in Email doesn’t apply to your Gmail account. For 
details about handling signatures in Gmail, see page 242.)
Using Web-Based Mail Programs
OUTLOOK.COM (AKA HOTMAIL) AND Yahoo Mail are both web-based mail 
programs, but the Galaxy S5 lets you read them using its built-in email software. 
Just create new accounts for them, and you’ll be able to use its email software 
to read them.
But if you’d like, you can read email from Hotmail and Yahoo, or any other web-
based mail program. Simply visit the site with your phone’s web browser and 
use the email site just as if you were using it on a computer. In some cases, when 
you visit the site, you’re automatically routed to a site specifically built for smart­
phones, so all the features are formatted nicely for your phone.
In some instances, there might even be an app you can download from the 
Google Play store, or from the Web, that you can use instead of a web browser. 
Search the Google Play store to see.
 NOTE 	 In some cases the downloadable app may not be built by the company that 
owns the web-based email service, but instead by a third party. It’s generally better to 
find an app built by the original developer.

You’ll learn to:
• Use Facebook on the S5
• Use Twitter on the S5
• Use Google+ on the S5
• Chat and videochat on the 
S5
www.it-ebooks.info

THE GALAXY S5 HAS everything you need to keep in touch with friends, family, 
and associates throughout the world via social networking apps like Facebook, 
Twitter, Google+, and more. It connects to the Internet, has GPS capabilities 
(so you can let others know where you are), a big beautiful screen for display­
ing updates, and a camera so you can take photos and videos and share them. 
Because it’s also got a front-facing camera, it’s great for videochat as well. If 
you’re a social butterfly, you’ve landed on the right phone.
In this chapter you’ll find out how to get the most out of your S5 and social net­
working services, chat, and videochat.
 NOTE 	 At this writing, the S5 doesn’t have social networking apps built into it. You 
have to download those apps from the Play store. But that may change, so check your 
Apps screen to see if any social networking ones are included. See Chapter 12 for the full 
details on installing and using apps.
Facebook
FACEBOOK IS NOT JUST popular; it’s ubiquitous. Millions of people around 
the globe use it to keep in touch with friends, play games, and publicize their 
favorite causes. In fact, millions of businesses now have Facebook pages,

showing how much social media has become integral to marketing and public 
relations.
To use Facebook on the S5, you can go to www.facebook.com in the Browser, 
but most Facebookers use an app that’s specially designed for the phone. As 
mentioned earlier, the app doesn’t come preinstalled on your S5, so you have to 
download it and install it yourself. Search for Facebook on Google Play, and then 
download the app. After a few minutes, when it completes downloading, tap the 
Open button to run the app.
 TIP 	 Make sure that you download Facebook, not Facebook Home. Facebook Home 
nearly takes over your entire S5. Many people have complained long and loud about Face­
book Home—at this writing half the people who rated it gave it only one out of a possible 
five stars.
After you launch the app, sign in. If you don’t yet have a Facebook account, tap 
“Sign up for Facebook” at the bottom of the screen and follow the directions. 
You’ll be asked to enter a bunch of personal information to create your account.
Once you sign in, you get a chance to sync your Facebook pictures, contact 
information, and status updates with your existing contacts. You can choose to 
sync with your existing contacts, not to sync, or else to have Facebook add its 
contacts to your own Contacts. The suggested choice is to sync with existing 
contacts, which ensures that you can interact with all your Facebook friends on 
your S5 without creating duplicates.
Tap Sync. In the background, your contacts sync. Meanwhile, you’re taken to 
your Facebook News Feed so you can start using Facebook right away.
 TIP 	 When you use Facebook and look at your contacts in the S5’s Contacts app, any of 
them who are also Facebook friends will have a small Facebook icon next to them.
The first screen you come to is the main Facebook page—your News Feed page. 
You’ll see updates from all your Facebook friends, including their pictures, how 
long ago the update was posted…pretty much the same thing you see when you 
visit Facebook on the Web.
Scroll through the feed the same way you scroll through any other screen on 
your S5, by flicking and dragging. Keep scrolling as long as you want. If you’ve 
got a lot of friends, there may seem to be no end to the eternity of postings.

 NOTE 	 This chapter assumes that you already know the basics of using Facebook. If you 
don’t, check out the Facebook website at www.facebook.com. Click the Help link at the top 
of the page. On the Help Center page, click the “Get Started on Facebook” link. And if you 
want to become a real pro, check out Facebook: The Missing Manual by E. A. Vander Veer.
The Facebook app regularly checks for updates on its own. If you’re like most 
Facebook denizens, though, you likely can’t wait. To make sure you’re seeing up-
to-the-minute postings from every single one of your friends, tell the Facebook 
app to check Facebook for any new postings. The S5 gives you a quick way to 
do that: drag the top of your News Feed down a bit and then release it. The 
Facebook page appears to bounce and then refreshes itself. Use Facebook for a 
few minutes, and this gesture will become second nature.
As you scroll down the News Feed, look at the bottom of each update. There are 
three buttons there: Like, Comment, and Share. Tap the appropriate button for 
what you want to do.
Tapping Like sends your friend a notification of your approval and adds your 
name to the list of people who also gave the post a thumbs-up. Tap Comment, 
and you’ll see a list of all comments to the post and a box where you can add 
your own. Tap in the box, and the S5’s keyboard appears. Type your comment, 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
262	
chapter	 11
tap Comment, and off it goes. You can also add a picture to your comment by 
tapping the photo icon and choosing a photo from the Gallery (page 115). Tap 
Share and you can share the post on Facebook. You get to choose with whom to 
share it—to the general public, just to your friends, and more.
When you’re on the screen for making a comment or adding a Like, you can 
view the profile of the person whose update you’re reading. Tap the Menu key at 
the bottom of the page and select View Profile.
 NOTE 	 The official Facebook app that you use may look and work a bit differently than 
what you see pictured here. That’s because the app gets updated, so you may be using a 
different version of the app from the one in use when this book was published.
    
Writing Posts, Uploading Photos, and Using Check In
Now that you’ve got Facebook on your S5, what should you do? Start posting, of 
course. What’s the point of Facebook if you can’t share your innermost secrets 
with the world?
To post an update, tap the Status button at the Facebook screen’s lower left; the 
keyboard appears. Type what you want, tap Post at upper right, and you’ll share 
with the world the all-important news about your cat’s recently changing sleep 
patterns.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Chat, and Videochat	
263
Ah, but what if you want to not just talk about his sleeping patterns, but also 
show a picture of him sleeping as part of the post? What if you want to share 
the post only with specific friends? What if you want people to know the exact 
location of your cat while he continues with his frustrating sleep habits?
That’s where the icons just above the keyboard come in. Tap the leftmost one 
(the picture of a person), to send the post to a specific friend. Tap the location 
button just next to it to choose a location. Tap the camera icon to go to the 
Gallery to choose a photo to include in the post. If you want to instead take a 
photo, after you tap the camera icon, tap it again from the screen that appears 
to launch the camera, take a picture, and then embed it in your post. If you’re a 
fan of emoticons and smiley faces, tap the icon of the smiley face to bring up a 
gallery of them. And tap the icon all the way on the right to choose how private 
the post will be: for anyone to see, for friends only, friends of friends, and so on.
You can also just post a photo without tying it to a post: back on the News Feed 
page, tap the photo icon in the middle bottom part of the screen, and then 
choose a photo from your Gallery to post. And if you want to choose a loca­
tion for your postings, tap the Check In icon just to the right of the icon of the 
camera.
Navigating Facebook’s World
Look just below the very top of the Facebook app’s screen—there are five icons 
there. They’re there so that you can navigate Facebook’s gigantic, ever-changing 
world. Here’s what they do, from left to right:
www.it-ebooks.info

	
264	
chapter	 11
• The leftmost icon brings you back to your News Feed, no matter where you 
are.
• The second-from-left icon (two people) shows you all the requests for 
people to friend you. Respond to any right on the screen.
• The middle icon (a message balloon) lets you see any messages sent to 
you. Tap any message to respond to it, Like it, and so on.
• The second-from-right icon (a globe) shows notifications left to you, likes 
and comments to your posts, messages from games you play, and so on.
• The rightmost icon gives you quick access to your Facebook friends, events, 
groups, apps, and so on.
    
Interacting with Friends and Finding New Ones
Facebook is all about keeping in touch with friends and making new ones. To 
do that, you’ll use two icons at the top right of the screen, just above the row of 
icons described in the previous section. Tap the rightmost top icon—a person 
with three horizontal lines—and a screen appears with a list of your current 
Facebook friends. Tap the person with whom you want to chat and a chat screen 
opens so you can chat with her.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Chat, and Videochat	
265
To find a friend, tap the Search icon, type the name of the friend you’re looking 
for, and you’ll get a list of matches. For example, if you search for ly, you’ll find 
people with the first name of Lydia, Lynn, and Lysa, people with the last name 
Lyons, and so on. Scroll through the list and tap the one you want to chat with.
    
What if you want to see a list of all of your friends? Don’t use the very top row of 
two icons. Instead, tap the rightmost one in the group of five just below it. That 
brings you to a menu of many Facebook features. Tap Friends from that screen 
to see the whole list.
How about if you want to add new friends? It’s a snap. When you tap the Find 
Friends button, a screen appears with a list of people you might know. How is 
that list compiled? It’s Facebook magic. But part of it comes down to mutual 
friends—if there’s someone with whom you’ve got a lot of friends in common, 
he’ll show up here.
Viewing Your Friends’ Walls, Info, and More
Whenever you see a friend in a list, tap the name, and you’ll get sent to his 
Timeline, where you can see his most recent updates and much more. Scroll 
down to see all his updates; tap the Message button to send a message; tap 
the Photos button to see photos; tap the Friends buttons to see his friends. You 
can comment on any post…well, you get the idea. You can do anything with the 
Android app that you can do on the Web.

Facebook Notifications
Facebook uses your S5’s Notification panel to let you know when something 
important has happened—someone responded to a friend request, wants to 
chat, and so on. You’ll get a notification via the Notification panel. Tap it to open 
it and take any action needed.
Add a Facebook Widget
If you want to interact with Facebook updates at a glance, you don’t need to run 
the Facebook app. Instead, add a Facebook widget on one of your Home screen 
panes. Adding a widget is a great way to use Facebook on your S5, because that 
way you can get updates and interact with Facebook without having to run the 
app.
To add a widget, when you’re on a pane, hold your finger on the Recent Apps 
button. Tap the Widget icon that appears at the bottom of the screen. Flick 
through the list of available widgets until you find the ones for Facebook. 
Widgets are in alphabetical order, so it shouldn’t take you too long to get to the 
Facebook ones.
When you find the one you want, hold it and drag it to the highlighted area of 
the screen that appears above. There may be several widgets, so drag as many 
as you want. Facebook Status is a good one, since it shows you all your friends’ 
updates at a glance. The widget constantly refreshes itself. Tap it to go straight 
to Facebook. You can post right from the widget—tap “What’s on your mind?” 
and go crazy.

 NOTE 	 If you try to put a widget on a pane that’s already full, the widget will refuse to 
be put there. For more details about handling widgets, see page 28.
Twitter
ARE YOU ONE OF the vast army of tweeters? Celebrities, politicians, pundits, 
and even the pope communicate with the world in 140-character tweets. With 
the help of an app, you can tweet right from your S5. Make sure it’s the official 
one from Twitter; Twitter will be listed as the author on the app’s description 
page.
 NOTE 	 This section assumes that you already know how to use Twitter on the Web (or 
have at least heard of it). If you’re just getting started, go to www.twitter.com and click 
the Help link at the upper right of the page. The Help Center features a “Welcome to Twit­
ter” link where you can learn more.

Once you install it, log into your existing Twitter account or click the Sign Up 
button to create a new one. After a screen or two asking things such as if you 
want to authorize your S5 to use Twitter, you’ll be logged in. Tap Finish. Voilà—
you’re there! You’ll see updates of all the people you’re following. Scroll through 
to read them.
 NOTE 	 When you sign in, you’ll be asked whether Twitter can use your location. If 
you’re worried about your privacy, just say no.
When you come to the main Twitter screen, look across the top—that navigation 
bar is Twitter central for your interactions. Here’s what each of the buttons do, 
from left to right:
• The bird button takes you to Twitter’s main screen.
• The bell button shows notifications—like when people have retweeted or 
favorited tweets of yours.
• The envelope button shows direct messages that people have sent to you.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Chat, and Videochat	
269
 NOTE 	 A retweet is when you forward someone’s tweet to your own Twitter stream. 
Sort of like saying, “You’ve gotta see this tweet!” Your Twitter followers can also retweet 
you (more on that in a moment).
• The button with an icon of a person with a + sign helps you find people to 
follow and interact with.
• The search button lets you search Twitter for people and topics of interest.
• The Menu button gives you access to other features, like viewing drafts of 
tweets you haven’t yet sent, changing account settings, and adding a new 
account.
Just below those buttons are three tabs:
• The Home tab brings you to your main Twitter page.
• The Discover tab shows you trending hashtags and tweets that people you 
follow have favorited.
• The Activity tab shows you the activity of people you follow, such as who 
they’re following and which tweets they’ve favorited.
Creating a tweet is simple. At the bottom of Twitter’s main screen is a text input 
box with “What’s happening” in it. Tap the box and a new screen appears, 
where you type in your tweet. As you type, you’ll see an indication at the top 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
270	
chapter	 11
of the screen about how many characters you have left to help you stay within 
Twitter’s 140-character limit. Tap Tweet when you’re done to send your message 
out to the Twitterverse.
At the bottom of the screen for creating tweets are three buttons that let you 
enhance your tweet in the following ways (they’re listed from left to right):
• The picture button launches the Gallery, where you can take an existing 
photo and attach it to the tweet.
• The camera button lets you take and send a photo as part of the tweet. 
It launches the Camera app (page 129), where you can snap a photo; that 
photo is then included in the tweet.
• The location button turns on location services, so that your location is 
shared along with your tweet.
Taking Action on Tweets
The Twitter home screen shows you all the tweets, retweets, and direct mes­
sages from the folks you follow. You see a list of tweets, along with the person’s 
Twitter ID and photo, as well as how long ago the tweet was made. Small icons 
give more information about the tweet—for example, whether it’s a retweet, a 
direct message between people, or if the tweet has a photo attached.
Press and hold any tweet, and a bar appears with four icons on it that let you 
reply to a tweet, retweet it, add it to your favorites, or share it.

Twitter Notifications
Twitter uses your S5’s Notification panel to let you know when something impor­
tant has happened—you have a message sent to you, you’ve been retweeted, 
and so on. Tap the notification to open it, and take any action needed.
Google+
GOOGLE’S SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICE, Google+, isn’t as popular as 
Facebook or Twitter, but those in the know will tell you that it’s a winner and a 
great way to extend your social circle. Google+ also has some capabilities that 
competing social networking services don’t have, like the ability to organize 
your friends and family into circles, which lets you better manage how you inter­
act with them. Circles also integrate with Google Hangouts, YouTube, and Gmail. 
So when someone comments on a post on Google+, for example, it also shows 
up in Gmail.
Circles form the core of Google+, which makes it very different from Facebook 
and other social networks. When you add friends, family, and so on, you add 
them to a specific circle or circles, which you create according to your needs. 
That way, you can fine-tune posts so that only certain circles see them—for 
example, sending a post about your upcoming 35th birthday party to your 
Family circle, or about next year’s soccer league schedule to your Soccer circle. 
Similarly, you can more easily follow posts based on interests as well, by looking 
at posts from specific circles.
No need to download it; it’s built right into your S5. Tap the Google+ icon in the 
Apps Screen, and you’re ready to go. You may already have a Google+ account 
without knowing it, because it’s tied to your regular Google account. That’s 
another advantage of Google+ over other social networks: connecting to all your 
Gmail contacts in Google+ is a breeze.
 NOTE 	 This chapter assumes that you’ve already tried your hand at Google+ on the 
Web. If you need to learn more, check out the Google+ information page at http://bit.
ly/1a6DdXx. And if you want to become a real pro, check out Google+: The Missing Manual 
by Kevin Purdy.
When you first launch the app, it asks whether to add your Google+ connections 
to the contacts on your phone. (It’s nice to have it all in one place, no matter 
where you are.) Tap Next and you’ll be asked whether to back up your photos 
from your phone to Google+, and if so, how to back them up—in other words, 
only when you’re connected to a WiFi network, or when you’re connected to a 
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 11
WiFi network or your mobile network. (If you’ve got a lot of photos uploaded 
to your Google+ account, it’s better to back up only when you’re connected 
to WiFi, to cut down on any potential charges for using too much data on the 
network.)
After that, you’re logged into Google+ and ready to go. When you first launch it, 
you’ll see the feed from all the people in your Google+ circles.
Scroll through the list to read them, and tap any to read the full post if it’s too 
long to display on the initial screen. Beneath each post there are buttons for 
adding your +1 to it (the equivalent of a Like on Facebook), adding a comment to 
it, or sharing it. At the very bottom, you can see a live feed of comments people 
are adding.
The red bar at the top of the screen has all your Google+ tools. Tap your name 
or picture at the top left to go to your own profile page. The two-person icon 
reveals a list of people you may know and want to add to your circles. To see 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Chat, and Videochat	
273
any notifications, tap the icon that looks like a bell. (If there are any new notifi­
cations, you’ll see a number on the bell.)
Below the red bar, you see the word “Everything” with a triangle beside it. A 
drop-down list appears, letting you see only a subset of all the Google+ posts 
from your circles. Some subsets are auto-created, like “What’s hot.” But most of 
them let you see just posts from the various Google+ circles that you’ve created. 
The Search icon lets you search your circles for posts from a particular person 
or about a certain topic. For example, searching for “car” brings up results like a 
person named “Carlisle” as well as photos of automobiles.  
To write a new post, tap the icon of the red pen on the lower right. Type the text 
in the text area, and tap the word “Public” at the top of the screen to select with 
whom you want to share the post.
    
When you post to Google+, you can do more than just write. At the bottom of 
the text screen, tap the camera to choose a photo from the Gallery to include 
in the post, tap the chain link to include a link to a web page, and tap the smiley 
face to choose an emoticon to indicate your mood. And if you want to let people 
know where you’re posting from, tap “Add your location.” When you’re done, 
tap the paper plane, and off your message goes.
Back on the Google+ main screen, you’ll notice a few other icons down at the 
bottom of the screen. They mirror the icons at the bottom of the screen when 
you’re creating a post. With them, you can upload a photo, share your location, 
and choose an emoticon to indicate your mood.

Chat and Videochat with 
Google Hangouts
SOCIAL NETWORKING APPS ARE great for keeping in touch with people by 
posting comments, reading people’s posts, commenting on their posts, and so 
on. But if you want direct, live communication, there’s something better—chat 
and videochat. With them, you establish a direct connection with one or more 
people simultaneously, and then communicate via the keyboard or video.
Galaxy S5 phones come with a feature called Hangouts. Hangouts replace a 
previous Google program called Google Talk, and they do much more than talk—
like make it easier to videochat in groups. In that respect, they’re similar to the 
Hangouts feature built into Google+ on the Web.
If you don’t see the Hangouts app on your S5, download it from the Play Store.
To run it, tap the Hangouts icon in the Apps screen. You’ll come to the main 
screen, which shows you previous Hangout sessions, and lets you create new 
ones.
The app name “Hangouts” is a broad term that describes any interaction in it 
between you and other people. So a Hangout can be as simple as a one-on-one 
text chat or as complex as a group videochat.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Chat, and Videochat	
275
 NOTE 	 Hangouts are often used by websites to broadcast video discussions. They set 
up a Hangout, invite specific people to participate, and then do a bit of magic to broad­
cast it from a website. For example, The Huffington Post has a site called HuffPostLive 
(www.huffpostlive.com) that frequently uses Google Hangouts to broadcast. This author 
has appeared on it for a panel discussion about Apple, Microsoft, and the power of branding.
On the screen with a list of your previous Hangouts, tap any previous Hangout 
to initiate a chat with the person listed. You can also add additional people to a 
Hangout by tapping the “Anyone else” button next to the person’s name, and 
then adding that person.
To start a new Hangout with someone else, tap the + sign, or else swipe in from 
the right side of the screen. Whichever you do, you come to a screen with lists 
of people, gathered from several places—Google+ and your normal contacts list. 
At the very top are big icons representing people with whom you communicate 
most frequently, not necessarily via Hangouts, but via email as well.
Either scroll through the list to find someone you want to chat with, or at the top 
of the screen, type a name, email address, or even a Google circle that you’ve 
created. When you find someone you want to chat with, tap her name.
At this point, one of two things will happen. If the person uses Google+ or 
Hangouts already, you’ll be able to initiate a Hangout with her. If not, you’ll come 
to a screen that lets you contact the person via phone, email, SMS, or in another 
way in order to invite her to a Hangout. In practical terms, this means she’ll get a 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
276	
chapter	 11
message but will have to download Hangouts to her phone or head to it on the 
Web if she wants to communicate with you.
    
You can create a Hangout and chat with a single person or multiple people. To 
create one with multiple people, tap “Anyone else?” and keep adding people 
until you’ve added everyone you want. Here’s also where Google+’s Circles 
feature helps. You can initiate a Hangout with an entire Circle. In fact, if there are 
people you frequently videochat with—for example, a group of people at work 
with offices in different locations—you can create a Circle for just that purpose.
The next step is simple. To chat via the keyboard, tap “Send a message” at the 
bottom of the screen. Type in your message, tap the little airplane icon to the 
right of the message, and off it goes.
You’ll then see your message onscreen, next to your picture, or an icon repre­
senting your face. The person responds, and you see the reply onscreen. Keep 
chatting this way as long as you like.
You can send a photo as well. Tap the icon of the paper clip to the right of the 
text input box, and a screen appears that lets you take a photo and send it, or 
grab the photo from your Gallery. To browse the Gallery, tap “Other photos” and 
select the one you want to send. You can also send location information by tap­
ping Location.
If you want to switch to a videochat, tap the video camera icon at the top of 
the screen. The next section gives you the lowdown on how to videochat with 
Hangouts.

Videochat with Hangouts
When you videochat, your S5 uses the front-facing camera as a videocam. When 
you speak, its microphone sends what you’re saying, and when the other person 
speaks, the S5’s speakers play his words.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
278	
chapter	 11
The main part of the screen shows the person with whom you’re videochatting, 
and you’ll see a picture of yourself down toward the bottom. Normally during 
the chat the screen around all that is black. But if you tap the screen, one icon 
appears at the top of the screen, and a row of icons appears at the bottom. At 
the top of the screen, tap the + icon to add someone else to the videochat. 
Here’s what the bottom icons do, from left to right:
• The microphone icon turns off your microphone. If it’s already off, it turns it 
back on.
• The speaker icon lets you turn off the speaker, or else switch to wired head­
phones, a handset earpiece, or Bluetooth headphones.
• The video camera icon turns off the video camera and sends your Google+ 
picture or, if you don’t have one, a generic icon representing a person.
• The video camera with arrow icon switches your camera from the one fac­
ing you to the one facing away from you. If you’re using the one facing away 
from you, tapping the icon switches to the camera facing you.
The big red bar with the telephone icon at the bottom of the screen shows how 
long the videochat has been going on. Tap the bar to end the call.
Retrieving Archived Hangouts and More
If you tap the Menu button on a main Hangouts screen, you’ll get these options:
• Set mood lets you choose from a number of icons that represent the way 
you currently feel. People will see it when they see your online presence.

• Invites shows you the Hangout requests you’ve gotten but have not yet 
responded to.
• Snooze notifications stop any notification requests for Hangouts. Tap this 
and you can turn them off for a variety of intervals ranging from an hour to 
72 hours.
• Archived Hangouts lists all the Hangouts you’ve archived. Tap any to review 
it. If it was a text Hangout, you’ll see the text. If it was a video Hangout, you’ll 
see a summary of who was on the call and her pictures, but not the video 
itself.
• Settings gives you control over a variety of Hangout settings, such as chang­
ing your Google+ profile picture, whether to be alerted via sounds and vibra­
tions when you get requests for Hangouts, and so on.
• Help & feedback lets you find help for using Hangouts, and give feedback to 
Google about it.
Responding to a Hangouts Invitation
When you receive a message via Hangouts, it will appear in the status bar. 
Pull down the Notification panel, and then tap the message. You’ll be sent to 
Hangouts, where you can chat or participate in a video call as outlined earlier in 
this section.

Chat and Videochat with ChatON
THERE’S ANOTHER WAY TO chat or videochat on your S5—Samsung’s ChatON 
app. So far, very few people use the app, so it might be a lonely place to be until 
it catches on. Launch the app by tapping the ChatON icon in the Apps screen. 
The first time you launch it, it may take a few minutes to set itself up. When the 
registration screen appears, tap in your phone number and then tap Next. (Your 
number may already be filled in for you.) After you tap Next, you’ll be asked 
whether you want to verify the phone number via text (SMS) or a voice call. 
Make your choice, get verified via either voice or phone, and you’re ready to go.
 NOTE 	 In order to use ChatON, you’ll first have to have a Samsung account. To find out 
how to set one up, turn to page 22.
After verification, contacts from your phone will be imported into ChatON. That 
means that you’ll be able to contact them directly from the app, and they’ll be 
able to contact you as well—as long as they use ChatON, that is. Not all your 
contacts will be imported, only those who also use ChatON. So you may only 
have a friend or two, or you may have many available for videochats.

Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Chat, and Videochat	
281
On the ChatON main screen, you see all your contacts. The screen has four tabs 
across the top: Contacts, Chats, My Page, and More. Contacts lists your ChatON 
contacts. Chats shows your chat history. My Page contains personal information 
you can add, such as your mood, current status, and more. More has a variety of 
other features, including other services and things you can buy.
Chatting is simple: Tap the person with whom you want to chat, and on the 
screen that appears select the way you want to contact him. Tap the balloon 
to chat with him, the phone to call him, and the icon of the video camera for a 
videochat.
Other Social Networking Apps
Facebook, Google+, and Twitter are 
just three of the most popular social 
networking apps—there are plenty more 
out there, many of which have nifty 
Android apps for your S5. To find many 
of them, head to the Play store and go to 
the Social category.
Here are just a few you might want to 
try:
• WhatsApp. This service, bought 
by Facebook for an astonishing 
$19 billion, is a cross-platform 
messaging app that lets you chat 
and exchange messages on any type 
of phone without having to pay text-
messaging charges.
• Snapchat. This clever app lets you 
quickly take a photo and share it 
with others. But there’s a catch—the 
photo vanishes after the amount of 
time you specify. After that, it’s as if 
it never existed. This app has become 
extremely popular.
• Vine. Create short, looping videos 
with your camera, and share them 
with friends, family, and anyone else 
you want.
• Instagram. This popular app lets you 
customize photos by adding filter 
effects and then share them with 
others.
• Foursquare. This app is designed for 
mobility from the ground up. Share 
your location information, share 
pictures, get discounts, and so on.
• Seesmic. Technically, this isn’t a 
social networking site. Instead, it’s 
a piece of software that works as a 
kind of front end to Facebook and 
Twitter, so you can use both from the 
same interface.
• Hootsuite. A front end to multiple 
social networks, including Facebook, 
Twitter, LinkedIn, and others.
• LinkedIn. Think of LinkedIn as 
Facebook for business. It’s buttoned-
down, and mainly for work, although 
it has begun expanding beyond that 
as well.

WHY DO YOU HAVE the Samsung Galaxy S5 rather than a plain-Jane cell­
phone? If you’re like most people, it’s for the phone’s apps, which let you do 
remarkable things like using your phone as a bar code reader or guitar tuner.
The S5 features plenty of great built-in apps, which are covered throughout 
this book. In fact, you’ve been using apps and may not even know it. When you 
check your email on the S5, that’s an app. When you shop at Google’s Play store, 
it’s courtesy of an app. One of the phone’s great features, though, is that it lets 
you download and use new apps as well—and those new apps do just about 
everything under the sun (and sometimes things that seem beyond the range of 
the solar system).
In this chapter, you’ll find out how to get and use those apps, as well as how to 
uninstall and troubleshoot them. It’ll also show you a few of the more amazing 
Android apps available online.
The Galaxy S5’s Free and 
Easy Approach to Apps
THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S5 takes a different approach to the use of apps than 
some other devices in that there’s absolutely no limitation on what you can 
download. Android’s developer, Google, doesn’t step in to say what you can and 
CHAPTER	 12
Downloading and 
Using Apps
www.it-ebooks.info

	
284	
chapter	 12
can’t download, and neither do the phone’s manufacturer, Samsung, or its carri­
ers. If the app runs on Android, you can run it on your S5.
You’re free to choose from hundreds of thousands of apps, with thousands more 
being written every month. There are apps for tracking expenses, playing music, 
chatting with people, playing games, using social networks like Facebook and 
Twitter, finding new friends, making your S5 work better, viewing maps of the 
night sky, and much more.
 TIP 	 Some Android apps cost money, but many more are free. So whenever you find 
a for-pay app, do a bit of searching to see if you can find a free one that does the same 
thing.
These apps tie into the Galaxy S5’s unique hardware and software. One even 
automatically detects potholes as you drive, using the S5’s various sensors 
to measure sudden movements. The app then uses the phone’s positioning 
software to locate exactly where the pothole is and creates a text file with all 
the relevant information so you can send it to your local Department of Public 
Works. (Unfortunately, no app has yet been developed that will get your local 
Department of Public Works to actually fix the pothole.)
Running apps is simple. Tap their icons on any Home screen or pane, or on the 
Apps screen.
Apps and Multitasking
THE GALAXY S5 IS great at multitasking—running more than one app at a time. 
For example, you can browse the Web while you listen to music, receive email, 
and have Facebook updates delivered to you, all without breaking a sweat.
You usually don’t notice that Android is multitasking, because unlike in an oper­
ating system like Windows or Mac OS X, you typically don’t see all running apps 
simultaneously in their own separate windows at once. However, if you turn on 
the S5’s Multi Window feature, you’ll be able to run multiple apps on the same 
screen at once. For details, see page 38.
When you’re in an app and want to do something else on the S5, you typically 
press the Home key. From there, you can tap to run an app such as the web 
browser, or open the Apps screen to run more apps. When you do that, though, 
that first app is still running in the background. If it’s a music-playing app or a 
radio app, it keeps playing until you close it. With many other apps, though, at 
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Downloading and Using Apps	
285
some point the phone will notice that you haven’t used it in a while and close it 
down. You won’t even notice that the S5 has closed it.
 NOTE 	 You can find apps called task killers that claim to speed up your Galaxy S5 by 
automatically closing apps when they’re no longer needed, or by letting you manually 
close those apps. However, the era of task killers is drawing to a close, since the S5 has 
built-in features that do the same thing. For details, see page 300.
There is a way to make sure that an app closes when you switch away from it, 
though. Rather than pressing the Home key to run another app, press the Menu 
button and look for a menu choice that closes the app. Not all apps offer this 
choice, but that’s OK; the S5 will close the app when it’s no longer needed. If 
for some reason, though, you want to close an app and it doesn’t have a menu 
choice for that, you can still do it—use the Task Manager (page 300).
Seeing Your Most Recently Run Apps
There’s a quick way to see the most recent apps you’ve run or that are still run­
ning. Tap the Recent apps button on the lower-left part of the phone, and you’ll 
see them all in a scrollable list. Tap any app in the list to run it. You can also 
swipe away apps you’re no longer using to close them, thus shortening the list.

Where to Get Apps
THE GALAXY S5 OFFERS you not just one, not just two, but three different 
ways to download and install apps:
• Google Play store. Here’s the primary way that most people download and 
find apps. It’s right on your Home screen. Tap the Play Store button, and it 
launches. From here you can search for apps, find information about apps, 
and pay for them.
• The Web. You can download and install apps from websites. Visit the site on 
your phone’s browser and download from there.
 NOTE 	 In a few cases, you can download an app to your PC or Mac, and it will then be 
installed on your Galaxy S5 when you connect your computer. Generally, this happens if 
you’ve downloaded an app that works with your PC or Mac as well as with Android.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Downloading and Using Apps	
287
• Using a bar code scanner. Of all the amazing tricks the Galaxy S5 can do, 
this one may just be the coolest. A free app gives your S5 the ability to scan 
bar codes and QR codes. (QR codes are a special kind of bar code used by 
smartphones, cameras, and other devices.) After you’ve installed this app, 
you can scan a QR code to download other apps. When you’re browsing 
the Web with your PC or Mac, and you come across a bar code or QR code 
for downloading, just point your phone at it, click a button, and the magic 
begins. The phone grabs and installs the software from the website. For 
more on bar code scanning, see page 296.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
288	
chapter	 12
 NOTE 	 QR stands for quick response. QR codes are designed to be scanned at high 
speeds. They were initially created by a subsidiary of Toyota as a way to track the auto 
manufacturing process but are now used for many other purposes. Nowadays, you see 
them on TV, book covers, and even bus ads. Grab your S5 and shoot.
Using Google’s Play Store
TAP THE PLAY STORE icon, and you get sent to Google Play, which has not just 
apps, but also movies, music, books, and more. Tap the Apps icon to be sent 
to the Apps area, which has hundreds of thousands of apps you can download, 
with more added every month. The apps are either free or very low cost—typi­
cally under $4, although some business-related apps can cost up to $30:
• Tap the Categories tab at the top to see categories of apps, including 
Games, Business, Entertainment, and many more.
• Featured apps, games, movies, and more take up most of the screen and 
scroll off the bottom. Flick to see them; tap any one for more details.
 NOTE 	 Google sometimes reorganizes the Google Play store, so it may look different 
from what you see here.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Downloading and Using Apps	
289
At the very top of the screen, at upper right, is a search button. Tap it to search 
for an app.
Browsing by Category
Tap one of the categories, and you come to a screen that lists the apps in it. 
Notice across the top of the screen that there are buttons for Top Paid, Top Free, 
and others. You can’t see them all onscreen, so swipe to the right to see them 
in turn. Tap any category or list, and you come to a list of all the apps in that 
category. Each listing shows the name of the app, its maker, its price, and an 
average user rating.
Searching Google Play for Apps
Browsing is all well and good when you’ve got the time and want to scroll lei­
surely through lists looking for an app. But sometimes you’re on a mission: You 
know the type of app you want, and you want to find it fast.
In that case, you want to search. You can search by the type of app, the name 
of the program, or the name of the software company that created it. Tap the 
Search button, and a keyboard and search box appear. Type your search term or 
select a term from the list that appears when you begin typing. You’ll see a list 
of apps that match what you’re looking for, sorted into their categories.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
290	
chapter	 12
    
 NOTE 	 When you view a list of apps, you may notice that some of them, instead of 
showing a price, will show the word “Installed.” Yup, it means what you think it means—
you’ve already installed the app on your Galaxy S5.
Getting Info About an App
No matter what type of list you look through—whether as a result of a search 
or by browsing—you’ll eventually want to get more details about an app and 
possibly download it. In that case, tap the name of the app, and you come to a 
page with a great deal of information about it, including the number of down­
loads, the total number of ratings on which the star rating is based, the price, a 
description of the app, screenshots, and individual reviews.
 TIP 	 Be careful when using the star ratings as a guide to download and pay for an app. 
In some instances, that star rating may be based on just a rating or two. Any star rating 
based on a few ratings may not be particularly accurate, especially because the ratings 
may come from the developer and the developer’s friends. If there are a dozen or more 
ratings, they’re more trustworthy. So read the actual reviews, and see how many ratings 
each app has gotten.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Downloading and Using Apps	
291
Scroll down, and you’ll find a load of information about the app, including any 
videos showing it in action, individual reviews, and a particularly useful section 
that’s often overlooked—information about the developer. It lists other apps the 
developer has written, links to the developer’s homepage, and lets you send 
email to the developer.
 NOTE 	 If you come across an app that you believe has inappropriate content, such as 
pornography or gratuitous violence, scroll to the bottom of the page and tap “Flag as 
inappropriate.”
Downloading and Installing Apps
So you’ve read all about an app, and you’ve decided to take the plunge. You’re 
ready to download. What’s next? Depending on whether the app is free or paid, 
you do things slightly differently.
If the app is free, you see an Install button. Tap it. A screen appears, telling you 
what kind of information and features the application has access to, such as 
your location, your phone’s storage, and so on. Typically, the application needs 
this kind of access—a GPS app can’t do its job without access to your phone’s 
GPS features, after all. Still, it’s a good idea to take a look, and if you’re con­
cerned about anything, don’t download. (See the box on page 293 for more 
information.)
www.it-ebooks.info

	
292	
chapter	 12
To download it, tap Accept. The app immediately starts downloading in the 
background. You’ll see the progress of the download onscreen. While the down­
load goes on, you can use your phone in any way you want; the download won’t 
interfere. Soon a checkbox appears, indicating that the download is complete. 
Pull down the Notification panel, and you see that the app has downloaded and 
been installed. Tap the notification to run the app. You can also run the app by 
heading to the Apps screen and tapping the icon there. Or you can stay in the 
app page, on the Play Store, and wait for the download to complete. If it’s not a 
big file and you’re on WiFi, it can happen in a snap. 
If the app is free, it will install by itself, and you’ll see an Open button. Tap it to 
run the software. Tap the Uninstall button beneath it if you want to uninstall it.
If the app is a for-pay one, you need a Google Checkout account, so set one up 
ahead of time on the Web at https://checkout.google.com. It’s simple and free. 
With that done, you can buy the app. Instead of an Install button, a Buy button 
appears. Tap it. As when you’re downloading a free app, a screen tells you what 
kind of features and information the app will use. Tap Accept. Now it’s time to 
pay. On the next screen, you see how much the app costs. Tap Buy, and follow 
any onscreen instructions that appear. After you’ve paid, the download pro­
ceeds in the exact same way as for free apps.

Downloading and Using Apps	
293
Download with Caution
Your Galaxy S5 is a computer, and just 
like any computer, it can be targeted 
by malware or by hackers trying to 
steal personal data or track your online 
behavior. There’s software—like Lookout 
Security (www.lookout.com)—that 
you can use to keep yourself safe. But 
software by itself isn’t enough—you 
also need to be smart about what to 
download.
One of the biggest dangers comes from 
apps that invade your privacy by sending 
out information about you, or that dial 
your phone without your knowledge to 
call for-pay services, or send text mes-
sages to for-pay services. There’s a way 
to see what kind of information apps will 
grab, and what kinds of access they have 
to your computer—and you can see that 
before you download. When you tap to 
download, you see a list of the features 
and information the app can access. 
Look closely at that information. If an 
app is asking for access to information or 
features that don’t seem related to the 
app, it could spell trouble. For example, if 
you’re downloading a simple, single-
player game and it says that it uses your 
GPS to determine your location, that 
might be a red flag, because there’s gen-
erally no need for a game of that kind 
to have that information. The app may 
attempt to track your location and send 
information about it to advertisers.
On the other hand, a social networking 
app that connects you to friends nearby 
will certainly need access to your GPS 
location. So the key is to see whether the 
information and features seem to match 
the purpose of the app.

Downloading from the Web
YOU’RE NOT LIMITED TO getting apps from the Google Play store—you can 
download them from the Web as well. You can either visit the app developer’s 
website to download the app, or instead head to one of the many web libraries 
that house thousands of apps.
 NOTE 	 Be aware that when you install apps from the Web, they don’t go through the 
same kind of vetting procedure that they do in Google Play. So be careful about what you 
download. It’s a good idea to download apps only from well-known developers or well-
known, trusted download libraries.
Downloading from the Web takes a bit more work than from Google Play. It’s a 
several-step process, rather than a simple all-in-one:
1.	Go to a website using your phone’s browser and search for an app, or go 
directly to a developer’s site.
2.	Download a file to your S5.
3.	Install the app using the downloaded file.
 NOTE 	 You can also download the file to your PC or Mac and then transfer it to your S5. 
For details about transferring files between computers and your phone, see page 319.
Unless you know a specific app you want to download and the URL of the devel­
oper’s website, your best place to start is one of the many Android download 
libraries. The Android Freeware site—www.freewarelovers.com/android—is one 
good place. The download library www.download.com also has an Android area, 
and www.appbrain.com is good, too.
Once you find a file you want to download, tap the link to download it. A file will 
then be downloaded, and you’ll see the progress on a download screen. You’ll 
notice an odd filename—Ghost_Commander_1.52b4.apk, for example. (Android 
apps end in the extension .apk.)
 NOTE 	 In some instances when you go to a website to download the file, when you 
click to download, you’ll be sent to Google Play and can then download it from there in 
the usual way.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Downloading and Using Apps	
295
After the file downloads, tap the notification. Either the file will install, or else 
you’ll come to a screen asking you whether you first want to scan the file with 
an anti-malware program, if you’ve got one on your S5. (Your S5 may come with 
the anti-malware program Lookout.) It’s a good idea to scan first, so go ahead 
and do that for safety’s sake. If it passes muster, then continue the installation. If 
it doesn’t pass, then don’t install the software.
 NOTE 	 Don’t worry if for some reason you miss the notification after the download. 
You can still easily find the file. In the Apps screen, tap Downloads, and you’ll see it.
Depending on how your S5 is set up, you may next come to a screen saying 
that, for security purposes, you can’t install any software outside the Google 
Play store. On the Apps screen, tap Settings. From the screen that appears, 
scroll down to the System section and tap Security. Scroll down and turn on the 
checkbox next to “Unknown sources.” A screen appears warning you that if you 
do this, you may be vulnerable to attack. Tap OK.
    
A screen similar to the one you’ve seen in the Google Play store appears, which 
tells you what kinds of features and information the app will need access to. 
Tap Install to install the app, or Cancel to cancel the installation. When the app 
is installed, you can immediately run it by tapping Open, or tap Done and run it 
later. You’ll be able to run the app anytime from the Apps screen.
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 12
When you’re done installing the app, you won’t need the original download file 
any longer, so you can delete it.
Downloading and Using a 
Bar Code Scanner
HERE’S AN EVEN COOLER way to download apps—using a bar code scanner. 
You browse the Web by using your PC or Mac, and when you come across a file 
you want to download, point your S5’s camera at the onscreen bar code, and 
the app downloads to your PC. In fact, you don’t even need to browse the Web 
to download apps in this way. The bar code can be somewhere in the physical 
world—like in a magazine.
First you need to get one of the many bar code scanner apps. One highly rated, 
popular app is called Barcode Scanner, from ZXing Team. And it’s free, as well.
 NOTE 	 Barcode Scanner does a lot more than just let you download apps. It can also 
scan a bar code on a product, identify the product, and send you to web pages with more 
information about it, including reviews and places to buy.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Downloading and Using Apps	
297
After you install the scanner app on your Galaxy S5, you’re ready to go. Many 
web-based Android libraries and developer websites have bar codes next to the 
app descriptions, so you can easily download them.
When you come across a bar code for downloading an app, run Barcode 
Scanner, and then point the phone’s camera at the bar code just as if you were 
snapping a photo, centering it in the window in the middle of the viewfinder. The 
app quickly recognizes the bar code and shows you information about it, includ­
ing the web page’s URL. At the bottom of the screen, tap “Open browser,” and 
the file downloads just as if you had tapped a download link. You can then install 
the app in the usual way. For details, see page 291.
 NOTE 	 You can also share the link to the app with others by tapping either “Share via 
email,” or “Share via SMS.” If you do that, you won’t send the app or the bar code, but 
instead a link to the page, using either email or text messaging.
Updating Apps
APPS ARE OFTEN UPDATED, and the nice thing about the Galaxy S5 is that 
it tells you when any of your apps are ready for updating—and then lets you 
update them with a single tap. When an update is available, you get a notifica­
tion in the Status bar. Drag down the bar, tap the notification, and you see a list 
of all the apps that have updates available, as well as all your downloaded apps. 
Even better, many apps automatically update themselves, so you don’t need to 
do anything.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
298	
chapter	 12
Tap any update you want to download, and you see the description page you 
normally see before downloading an app, except that the buttons at the bot­
tom have changed. Tap Update to update the app or Uninstall to remove it from 
your phone. You can also update all your out-of-date apps in a single swoop by 
tapping “Update all.” When you tap Update, you’ll get the same note about the 
features and information the app will use. Tap to install it, and the S5 downloads 
the app in the background. You see its progress as it downloads, but you don’t 
have to watch it unless you really want to.
 TIP 	 If you want the app to update itself automatically, instead of you having to update 
it, turn on the checkbox next to “Allow automatic updating” on the Update screen.
Managing, Sharing, and 
Uninstalling Apps
AFTER A WHILE, YOU MAY suffer from app overload: You’ve downloaded so 
many apps you don’t know what to do with them. It’s time to get them under 
control.
There’s a single app for doing that, the Application Manager. Tap Settings from 
the Apps screen, scroll down to the Applications section, and tap Application 
Manager.

Downloading and Using Apps	
299
You’ll see a list of your apps, including their names and file sizes, categorized in 
four tabs. It’s tough to tell at first that there are four of them, because there’s 
not enough screen real estate to show them all, but they’re there. To see each 
tab, swipe to the right. Here’s what each tab shows:
• Downloaded. These are apps that weren’t on the Galaxy S5 when you 
started using it but that you’ve downloaded and installed.
 NOTE 	 Some apps show up on the Downloaded tab even if they were preinstalled, such 
as those you’ve updated. But even some you didn’t update show up there…go figure!
• All. This is the mega-list of your apps—every single one on the phone, 
including those built into it and those you’ve downloaded.
• On SD card. Normally, apps install to your Galaxy S5’s main memory, not to 
its SD card. But as you’ll see in a bit, there’s a way to move some of them 
from the phone’s memory to its SD card.
• Running. These are apps that are currently running on your S5.
 TIP 	 The list of apps is arranged alphabetically. You can instead view them by their size 
(biggest first). Tap the Menu button, and then choose “Sort by size” to list them by size 
order.
Tap any app, and you come to a screen chock-full of information about it—its 
version number, its total size, the size of any data associated with it, the size 
of the program itself, and, toward the bottom of the screen, information about 
what kinds of features and data the app uses.
You can uninstall the app—tap the Uninstall button. If you see that an app is run­
ning and you want to close it, tap the “Force stop” button. That button is grayed 
out if the app isn’t currently running.
 TIP 	 It’s easy to uninstall an app from the Apps screen or any other screen it’s on. Hold 
your finger on the app you want to uninstall, and then drag it to the trash can icon at the 
top of the screen.
From this screen, you can also move an app from the Galaxy S5’s main memory 
to its SD card—simply tap “Move to SD card.” If an app is already on the SD card, 
tap the button to move it back. (Not all apps can be moved to the SD card—its 
developer must have programmed that capability into it.)

Using the Task Manager for Managing Apps
The Galaxy S5 also has a handy built-in task manager that shows information 
about your apps and lets you control them in some very useful ways. To launch 
it, tap the Recent apps button on the lower left of the S5 and tap the far-left 
button—it looks like a pie graph. You’ll see a screen that looks a little bit like the 
one covered in the previous section. There are some big differences, though. 
The Task Manager is designed for closing down apps and managing memory 
and storage, and more as well. It’s a great app that shows all the applications 
that are currently running. It also shows how much RAM (memory) each uses, 
and how much of your smartphone’s CPU it uses. (The CPU is your phone’s 
brain.) If any app is problematic (for example, using too much battery, too much 
RAM, or too much CPU), it shows up red. This information is helpful if you find 
your S5 running sluggishly, because it may be that your apps are taking up too 
much memory or too much of your CPU. To free up memory or the CPU, you can 
force some apps to close. Tap the End button next to any you want to close. It 
also shows how much storage you have on your main system and SD card, and 
how much you’ve got left.

Putting an App on the Home 
Screen or Panes
THERE MAY BE AN app you use so frequently that you get tired of the constant 
dance of having to open the Apps screen, scroll down to the app’s icon, and then 
tap it. There’s a much easier way: You can put its icon right on your Home screen 
or any screen, so it’s always there at your command:
1.	Go to the Apps screen.
2.	Hold your finger on the app you want to put on the Home screen or other 
screen.
3.	The last screen you were on before going to the Apps screen appears at 
the top of the screen, but smaller than normal. Below it you’ll see represen­
tations of each of your screens, including the Home screen.
4.	Drag the app’s icon to the Home screen or pane where you want it to 
appear.
5.	The icon is added to the Home screen or a pane.
 NOTE 	 The Home screen or pane may have too many app icons on it to have any new 
ones added. In that instance, you’ll have to first remove an icon from the screen or pane 
before you can add a new app.

chapter	 12
What if you want to delete the icon but still keep the app? Put your finger on 
the app and hold it there until a trash can appears at the top of the screen. Drag 
the icon to the Trash. The icon disappears, but the app remains and is accessible 
from the Apps screen.
Troubleshooting Apps
IN A PERFECT WORLD, apps would never misbehave. Unfortunately, it’s not 
a perfect world. So an app may quit the moment you launch it, or cause your 
Galaxy S5 to restart, or do any number of odd things. If that happens, try these 
steps:
• Launch the app again. There’s no particular reason why this should work, 
but it often does.
• Uninstall and reinstall. There may have been an oddball installation prob­
lem. So uninstall the app and then reinstall it. That sometimes fixes the 
problem.
• Restart your Galaxy S5. Just as restarting a computer sometimes fixes 
problems for no known reason, restarting the S5 may have the same effect. 
Power it down by pressing and holding the Power/Lock key, and then press 
and hold the Power/Lock key again to restart.

• Reset the Galaxy S5. If an app causes the phone to stop responding, you’ll 
have to reset the phone. See page 384 for details.
If none of this works, it’s time to uninstall the app. Don’t fret; there are plenty 
more where it came from.
Thirteen Great Apps
THERE ARE TENS OF thousands of great apps, and a whole world of them to 
discover. To give you a head start, here are 13 favorites—and they’re all free. 
You can find each of them in the Google Play store, although in the instance of 
S Health, it’s already right on your S5.
S Health
This very useful Samsung app helps you manage your health, including setting 
and keeping fitness goals, and keeping track of your health in general. To run it, 
tap S Health in the Apps screen.
After you agree to the terms of use, you fill out a basic profile about yourself, 
including your name, age, gender, height, weight, and activity level. Based on 
that, S Health calculates how many calories you should consume a day, and how 
many calories you likely burn a day. When you’re done, tap the Start button.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
304	
chapter	 12
 NOTE 	 Keep in mind one thing about S Health: It can be a guilt-inducing little app, 
tracking every part of your health. The truth is, though, that it’s unlikely you’ll use every 
part of it. So pick and choose what you want to use, and it’ll be your friend instead of a 
nag.
The S Health’s main screen shows you the current state of your health, including 
the calories you’ve burned today and how many calories you’ve eaten. But it can 
do this and keep track of other parts of your health only if you tell the program 
to start tracking you.
To do that, tap the icon of three horizontal lines at the top left of your screen. 
You’ll come to a screen with various modules for tracking your health, including 
for walking, exercise, weight, sleep, and others.
Tap the module you want to use, set a goal if you wish, and then press Start. 
For example, if you choose Running, press Start and start pounding the pave­
ment. There’s even a button that lets you play music on your S5 as you work out. 
When you’re done running (or ready for a break), tap Pause, and when you’re 
ready to see your final results, tap Stop. S Health shows you how long you ran, 
how much distance you covered, how many calories you burned, and (if you 
have GPS turned on) the route you ran.

 NOTE 	 The Sleep module is designed to work with the Samsung Gear Fit activity moni­
tor. It detects your sleep pattern as you wear it on your wrist and then syncs it to your 
phone. If you already have an activity monitor, like a Fitbit, it may sync with the S5. Give it 
a try!
There are still more features that take advantage of the S5’s built-in magic:
• Pedometer uses the S5’s sensors to track how much you’ve walked in a day. 
Just turn it on and carry your S5 with you. At the end of the day, it tells you 
how many steps you’ve walked and how many calories you’ve burned. It 
tracks this over time, so you can see graphs.
• Heart rate does exactly what it says—it measures your current heart rate. 
Hold your finger on the sensor at the back of the S5 (it’s just underneath the 
camera), tap the Start button, and keep still. The S5 then does its magic and 
measures your heart rate. To test it out, try it in multiple circumstances—
after heavy exercise, when you wake from sleep, after sitting still, and so on.
 NOTE 	 The Stress module works in a similar manner, but you have to hold your finger 
on the heart rate sensor longer. As far as anyone can tell, this feature works by looking for 
variations in your heart rate over time.

Make sure to check in regularly to S Health to see how you’re doing, and adjust 
your meals, exercise level, and so on to keep on track. To get an overview, tap 
the small chart icon at the bottom right of the screen to see graphs that display 
how you’re doing over time.
Endomondo Sports Tracker
If you’re serious about running, cycling, hiking, mountain biking, or other sports, 
you should give Endomondo Sports Tracker a try. It’s a combination training 
tracker and analyzer combined with social media and networking. The app uses 
the S5’s sensors, notably its GPS, to automatically track your workout. So you 
can use it while running, for example, to see your progress—running distance, 
time elapsed, and current and average speeds. After your run or workout, you 
upload the information results so that friends can see them—and either sneer at 
your measly results or go green with envy over your athletic prowess. There’s 
plenty more here as well, such as automatically created maps of your workouts, 
and linking to music apps so you can listen to music while you jog and sweat.

TuneIn Radio
There are thousands of Internet radio stations all over the world, just waiting for 
you to listen to them. Most are streams of traditional stations, but there are many 
Internet-only stations as well. No matter the kind of music, news, entertainment, 
talk, or more, you’ll be able to find it on this great free app. It lets you browse and 
search for anything you want. You may even find it useful for learning foreign 
languages, because you can tune in to radio stations from all over the world.

Google Play Newsstand
Here’s another excellent free app for news and information junkies. It grabs 
stories from many resources, publications, and sites, ranging from print news­
papers and magazines to blogs, websites, television channels, and more. You 
can follow constantly changing sections, such as Business, Science & Tech, 
Entertainment, Sports, and so on, or you can instead follow just a single publica­
tion, such as The Daily Beast. It’s also easy to share stories with other people. 
And a particularly useful feature is Save, which lets you download articles to 
your S5 in a single location for later reading.
 NOTE 	 Even though the app is called Google Play Newsstand, it may show up on your 
S5 with the name of its predecessor, Currents, or Google Currents. Go figure. 
Evernote
If you suffer from information overload, here’s your remedy. Evernote does a 
great job of capturing information from multiple sources, putting them in one 
location and then letting you easily find them—whether you’re using your com­
puter, your tablet, or another Android device.

Not only that, it’s free.
You organize all your information into separate notebooks, and can then browse 
each notebook, search through it, search through all notebooks, and so on. No 
matter where you capture or input information, it’s available on every device on 
which you install Evernote. So if you grab a web page from your PC and put it 
into a notebook, that information is available on your S5, and vice versa.
You can capture information from the Web, by taking photos, by speaking, and 
by pasting in existing documents. And you can also type notes.
The upshot of all this? Evernote is the best app you’ll find for capturing informa­
tion and making sense of it all.
Aldiko Book Reader
That big 5.1-inch, high-resolution S5 screen is crying out for you to use it for 
something other than making phone calls or sending and receiving texts. And 
with this free app, you can do just that—read books, and plenty of them. It’s a 
very good ereader that gives you access to reading (for free or pay, depending 
on the book) thousands of books. There are plenty of nice options, like changing 
the reading settings between Day mode and Night mode (black text on white 
background for day; white text on black background for night). There are also 
bookmarking features, a good search feature, and plenty more. (Full disclosure: 
There’s also an excellent selection of O’Reilly books for download.)

 TIP 	 If you own a Kindle or a NOOK, you should also download the appropriate app for 
your S5. You’ll be able to read any of your Kindle or NOOK books right on your phone. And 
when you leave off reading on the S5 and start reading again on your Kindle or NOOK, 
you’ll be able to start in right where you left off—and vice versa.
Candy Crush Saga
This free puzzle adventure game is so addicting that you should start playing 
only when you know you won’t have something that needs doing for the next 20 
minutes…or hour…or two. You touch and swipe candies on a grid in order to put 
three of them in a row. When you do, they’re crushed, and more candies slide in. 
Match even more candies, and you create special candies that can be used for 
more power. They can also be combined for even more power. 
Simple, yes? Well, not so much, as you’ll find out as you make your way through 
this increasingly complicated game. The game has been popular for a long time 
and shows no sign of slowing down.

Google Goggles
This may well be the most amazing app you’ll ever see. Run Google Goggles, 
and then point it at an object, a sign, a piece of artwork, a logo, the label on a 
bottle of wine, and so on. It will identify what you’re looking at (or translate the 
sign if it’s in a foreign language), and provide more information about it. Point 
it at a menu in a foreign country to translate the menu, identify landmarks…
there’s a lot more here as well. It doesn’t always work, but when it does, it’s 
mind-boggling.

WhatsApp Messenger
Facebook paid $19 billion for this multi-messenger app, but you won’t have to 
pay a penny. It’s a cross-platform messenger program that lets you send and 
receive SMS text messages without having to pay your cellphone carrier. You’ll 
be able to send the messages and chat with those who use WhatsApp on other 
phone platforms.
    
Vine
This Twitter-created app does for videos what Instagram does for photos—it lets 
you create simple, 6-second looping videos, and then post them and share them 
with others. And it lets you check out looping videos that others create as well.
Creating a looping video is simple. Launch the app, tell it to create a video, 
and it switches to your camera. Hold your finger on the screen to record; lift 
your finger from the screen to stop recording. A bar across the top shows you 
how much you’ve already recorded of your 6 seconds of fame, and how many 
seconds are left. After you’ve created a video, it’s ready to go and can be shared 
via Twitter and Facebook. There’s also a Vine feed, so that people can subscribe 
to your feed, and you to theirs. That means you’ll be able to see a constantly 
changing feed of these little videos. Vine has all the usual social media features, 
such as comments.

Instagram
This popular app combines excellent photo filtering tools with photo sharing, 
and is a great way to play with photos and share them with friends and family, 
especially via Facebook. And it’s also great for seeing photos that others take, 
and not just friends and family, but the famous as well, many of whom seem to 
be Instagram junkies.

Load Instagram, use its tools to snap a photo, and then use its magic. You can 
add a frame and select a specific focus point, but that’s just the beginning. 
It’s the filters that you’ll care about, well over a dozen. Retro, black and white, 
Nashville, Hefe, Kelvin…you’ll find anything you need to indulge your inner 
photographer.
After you’re done, it’s time to share, and Instagram makes it easy. You can share 
via Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, Tumblr, or Foursquare without any heavy lifting, 
because they’re all built into the app. And you can use the app to follow others’ 
photos as well.
New to Instagram is a Vine-like capability for creating and sharing videos as 
well. Oh, and by the way, if you’re looking to take a selfie, this is a great app to 
do it with.
Snapchat
This app is a great mash-up of chat, social media, and photos. You take a photo 
or video, add text and drawings, and then send it to a friend or friends. Those 
friends can be ones gathered from your social networks, your contacts, and so 
on, or new ones you make on Snapchat. When you send a snap to a friend, it 
ends up in her Snapchat mailbox.
Sounds straightforward, and it is. But here’s the twist: The photo or video is per­
ishable, and lasts between 1 and 10 seconds after it’s opened. After that, it gets 
deleted from your friend’s phone and the Snapchat servers. It’s a great app for 
taking selfies and annotating them so your friends can see exactly what you’re 
up to at exactly that instant.

• Beam files and use WiFi to

• Use Group Play to share

YOUR GALAXY S5 IS not an island—it’s built to work with your computer as 
well. So if you’ve got a music collection on your PC, for example, you can copy 
that collection to your phone and listen to music there. You can also transfer pic­
tures and videos between your S5 and PC or Mac. In fact, you can transfer any 
file between your S5 and your computer. 
When you transfer files between your Galaxy S5 and your computer, the S5 
looks to your computer just like a USB storage device, and in many ways you 
transfer files the same way as you do between your computer and any USB 
device. In fact, you have a few more options, including WiFi and some nifty shar­
ing features built into the S5. This chapter covers them all. You can even beam 
files back and forth with other S5 owners—like magic!
Another sharing option on the S5 is Group Play—a Samsung innovation that lets 
you share files by WiFi with nearby Galaxy phone fans. You can even use Group 
Play to…well, play group games by WiFi.

S5 to Your Computer

microUSB plug into your S5 and the normal-sized USB plug into your computer’s 
USB port.
A USB icon (
) appears in the status bar. That means that your S5 is ready to 
start transferring or receiving files.
 NOTE 	 When you connect your Galaxy S5 to your Windows PC for the first time, the PC 
may not recognize it. It may need a special driver—a small piece of helper software—in 
order to see the S5 and communicate with it. Your PC will look for and install the drivers 
automatically, assuming it’s connected to the Internet.
If you pull down the notification, you will see that the notification reads, 
“Connected as a media device.” Tap the notification, and you come to a screen 
that tells you that you’ve connected your phone to your PC as a media device—
in other words, you can transfer media files between it and a PC or Mac. To do 
so, make sure the “Media Device (MTP)” checkbox is turned on. Underneath 
that setting, there’s another one, “Camera (PTP).” Turn on this box if you have a 
camera and want to transfer files between the camera and your phone.
 TIP 	 If you’re having trouble transferring files between the phone and a PC or Mac, not 
a camera, it’s a good idea to turn on the “Camera (PTP)” checkbox anyway, because it can 
sometimes make sure that files transfer smoothly.

Transferring Files by Using Your PC
AFTER THE DRIVERS HAVE been installed on your PC, when you connect your 
Galaxy S5 to it, the AutoPlay screen may appear, as it sometimes does when 
you connect a USB device to your PC. However, don’t be concerned if it doesn’t, 
because it doesn’t show up on every PC; that depends on your operating system 
and computer setup (and maybe even the phase of the moon).
After you’ve connected it to your PC, launch File Explorer in Windows 8, or 
Windows Explorer in any other version of Windows. Your S5 now shows up as a 
removable disk, just like any USB drive.
You can now use your phone as if it were any USB flash device—copying files 
to and from it, creating folders, and so on. That’s fine in theory, but in practice 
what can you actually do? You’ll find a number of folders on the S5, some of 
which have names that are clear, and some of which have names that make no 
sense—like DCIM.
 NOTE 	 The exact folders you’ll see may vary dramatically from what’s listed here, 
depending on the apps you use and other factors.
There are several important folders that contain information you might want to 
transfer from your S5 to your PC, or vice versa. You’ll see a lot more folders, but 
these are the important ones:
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 13
• Documents. If you’ve got Word files, PDF files, and similar files, here’s where 
they’ll likely be.
• Download. If you’ve downloaded content to your Galaxy S5 from the 
Internet, such as pictures or web pages, you see them in here.
• DCIM. Here’s where the Galaxy S5 stores all the photos and videos you’ve 
taken. Drag photos from this folder to your PC to copy them, or drag photos 
from your PC here to put them into the Galaxy S5 Gallery (page 115).
• Movies. As the name says, here’s where you’ll find movies and videos you’ve 
watched or transferred to your S5.
• Music. The Galaxy S5 stores music here, although it might also store music in 
other places as well. If you download music files by using the Amazon music 
app, for example, there will be an Amazonmp3 folder where your music is 
stored.
• Pictures. Here’s where your photos are stored. There may be subfolders 
underneath this as well.
• Podcasts. Yes, you guessed right. Here’s where your podcasts are.
• Ringtones. Downloaded ringtones to your phone? Here’s where to find 
them.
• Samsung. Samsung uses this folder for a variety of different reasons. For 
example, in addition to the primary music player built into the phone and 
other Android phones, Samsung has its own music player, and music for it is 
found in a subfolder underneath this folder.
 TIP 	 To be on the safe side, don’t make any changes to the Samsung folder. Let Sam­
sung handle it.
If you’re transferring music from your PC to your Galaxy S5, first create a new 
folder on the phone using File Explorer or Windows Explorer, as you would 
create any other folder. Then transfer the music to that folder, using subfolders 
if you want. When you do this, your S5’s music player will automatically recog­
nize the music you’ve transferred. (For details about using the music player, see 
Chapter 4.)

Transferring Files by Using Your Mac
TO TRANSFER FILES BETWEEN your Mac and Galaxy S5, you must first down­
load the free Android File Transfer tool. Go to www.android.com/filetransfer/ 
and follow the instructions for downloading and installing it.
Once you do that, connect the S5 to your Mac with the USB cable. Then run the 
Android File Transfer app. After you run it for the first time, it should automati­
cally start after that whenever you connect your S5 to your Mac.
You can then transfer files back and forth between your Mac and your S5 using 
Android File Transfer. It works just like Finder or any other file management app.
If you specifically want to transfer photos between your Mac and your S5, first 
change the S5’s USB mode to tell it you’re going to transfer photos. Connect 
your S5 to your Mac via USB; the USB notification appears in the status bar. Pull 
down the Notification panel, tap the USB notification, and on the screen that 
appears, select “Camera (PTP).” You can then use iPhoto to transfer photos 
between the Mac and your S5.

Using the Galaxy S5 My Files App
TO BROWSE THROUGH THE files of your Galaxy S5, you don’t need to rely on 
your PC or Mac—you can use the S5’s My Files app. From the Apps screen, tap 
My Files to launch it.
If you’ve seen the My Files app on previous versions of the Galaxy phone, you’ll 
be surprised, and pleasantly so, by what you find when you open it on the S5. 
It’s been thoroughly revamped and makes finding and managing files a breeze.
The top of the screen is organized into various categories of files, such as Recent 
files, Images, Videos, Documents, Audio, and Downloaded apps. 
Tap any category and you’ll see a list of files, including thumbnails of images if 
the files are pictures. Tap any file to open it. In some instances, if there are mul­
tiple apps that can open a file, you’ll be asked which app to use. Tap the app you 
want to open the file, and then select whether you want the app to be used for 
opening that file type just this once, or every time you open the file. If you tap 
Always, you won’t see the screen again.

Sharing Files by NFC and Beaming
THE GALAXY S5 CAN share files with other phones without the help of cable 
or WiFi or even Bluetooth. These awesome powers are not always obvious. So 
here’s your secret decoder ring.
 NOTE 	 Beaming files works only between your S5 and other mobile devices, not Macs 
or PCs.
Beaming is made possible by a relatively new technology called NFC, which 
stands for near field communciation. Depending on your point of view, NFC is 
either the future of mobile computing, or else a dead end that few people will 
ever use. At the moment it’s somewhere in between, but who knows what the 
future holds? The point is, you’ve got it baked right into the guts of your S5, so 
there’s no reason not to give it a try.
NFC is a way to get mobile devices to talk or to transfer files by touching the 
devices to each other. You may have seen it in Samsung’s ads.

	Transferring Music, Videos, Pictures, and Other Files, and Using Group Play	329
You can use the S5’s NFC only with another device that uses NFC. At this point 
not many do. But S5s do, so you can always start there. To turn on NFC, tap 
Settings from the Apps screen, scroll down to the “Connect and share” section, 
tap the NFC icon, and switch NFC on. Then, on the NFC screen, tap S Beam and 
switch it on.
You can then transfer files to another device using NFC and S Beam, just by 
tapping the devices together. First open the file you want to transfer, such as a 
photo, video, song, or other file. Then tap the phones together. Screens appear 
on both devices with the words “Touch to beam” on them. Touch the screen, and 
the file gets transferred.
You can also use NFC with NFC card readers to get information, and even make 
payments—that is, if you actually ever see any NFC card readers. With NFC 
turned on, tap the back of the S5 to the reader, and you’ll see the information 
from the reader, or else make a payment by tapping “Tap and pay.”
Quick Connect
THE S5 HAS A new feature called Quick Connect that lets you easily connect to 
nearby devices without going through the multiple steps normally required. You 
can then do a variety of things, like transferring files and printing them. But you 
can do more as well, including connecting to a TV and using the S5 as a remote 
control.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
330	
chapter	 13
 NOTE 	 Quick Connect works only with other devices that also have the Quick Connect 
feature, and at this point there aren’t many of them. 
Quick Connect makes the connection to other devices according to the device’s 
specific capabilities, which means sometimes WiFi and sometimes Bluetooth. 
But you don’t need to know the means of connection—Quick Connect takes care 
of that for you, behind the scenes.
To use it, open the notification panel and tap “Quick connect.” Your S5 scans for 
devices to which it can connect and displays icons for them. Tap the one you 
want to connect to. What happens next varies according to the device you’re 
connecting to. For example, if you select a printer, you’ll come to a screen with 
a list of files you recently used. Select the ones you want to print. Then you’ll 
confirm your printer settings and print the files.
Checking Space on Your Galaxy S5
IF YOU TRANSFER LOTS of music and files from your PC or Mac to your Galaxy 
S5, you may eventually run out of storage space. It’s a good idea to regularly 
check how much space you’ve got left on it. To do so, from the Apps screen, tap 
Settings, scroll down to the System area, and then tap Storage. You see the total 
amount of capacity on your SD card and the phone’s USB storage.
www.it-ebooks.info

	Transferring Music, Videos, Pictures, and Other Files, and Using Group Play	331
If you’re running out of space, you can delete files (page 324).
 WARNING 	  If you’re deleting music, use the Music app rather than the Files app, 
because if you delete the files using the Files app, the Music app may still show the music 
as being present, even after the files are gone.
Using Group Play
GROUP PLAY—A SHARING FEATURE introduced on the Galaxy S III—lets you 
share documents and photos with others nearby and also lets you participate in 
multiplayer games.
With Group Play, a leader sets up a group, and then others join it via WiFi. At 
that point, they can share files, play games, and so on.
 TIP 	 Group Play should already be installed on your S5. If it’s not, download it from 
Samsung. Look for the Samsung Apps icon on the Apps screen.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
332	
chapter	 13
Say you’re the leader. To set up a group, first tap the Group Play icon on the 
Apps screen. From the screen that appears, tap “Create group.” If you want to 
make sure the group is password protected, turn on the “Set group password” 
checkbox at the bottom of the screen. Give that password to other group 
members.
At that point, you’ve set up Group Play. Now other people can join the group. 
They tap the Group Play icons in their Apps screen, and when they come to the 
main screen, tap “Join group.” They’ll see the name of your device and can con­
nect to it by using the password you’ve provided.
Once you’re all connected, tap what you want to do: share music, pictures, or 
documents; or play games. Choose what you want to share by tapping the 
category. You’re then prompted to choose what you want to share—for example, 
a specific photo or song. After you do that, if others in the group want to have 
it shared with them, they also tap that category. So, for example, if you want to 
share music, you’ll tap “Share music,” and then browse to the music you want 
to share. Everyone else then taps “Share music,” and the music plays on all your 
devices—in surround sound.
Depending on what you choose to share, you may have sharing options. With 
music, for example, you can set which device plays which stereo channel. To set 
the sharing options, tap the Settings button (it looks like a gear).
www.it-ebooks.info

	Transferring Music, Videos, Pictures, and Other Files, and Using Group Play	333
You can do the same thing with pictures and documents, and whatever is on 
your screen will be visible to everyone in the group. If you use this feature, make 
sure to explore the various sharing options for each category you’re sharing. For 
example, with pictures, there’s a drawing mode so you can draw on the slide, 
and everyone can see what you’re doing.
Dropbox
If you’ve ever have had to transfer 
work files or family pictures that were a 
little too big for email, you’ve probably 
already heard of Dropbox. It’s a website 
that lets you easily drag files into an 
online storage unit. Anyone can then 
download them onto any computer as 
long as you share the link.
You can access this service from your S5 
as well—just get the Dropbox for Android 
app from www.dropbox.com/android or 
Google Play.
APP ALERT
When you choose games, you can play head to head. Note that you’ll be able to 
play only games that have been specifically designed to be multiplayer games. 
Several come preinstalled on the S5; head to Google Play.
www.it-ebooks.info

You’ll learn to:
• Set the S5 to work with your 
company email account
• Connect to your company’s 
virtual private network 
(VPN)
• Use Microsoft’s Mobile 
Office for Android
• Use Google Docs
www.it-ebooks.info

YOUR GALAXY S5 MAY not wear a pinstriped suit and a rep tie, but that 
doesn’t mean it can’t be a good corporate citizen. In fact, the S5 can easily hook 
into enterprise-wide resources like your corporate email account and calendar.
A big reason is the Galaxy S5’s ability to work with Microsoft Exchange 
ActiveSync servers. These systems are the backbone of many corporations, and 
they can automatically and wirelessly keep smartphones updated with email, 
calendar information, and contacts. So when you’re hundreds or thousands of 
miles from the office, you can still be in touch as if you were there in person.
Setting Up Your Galaxy S5 with 
Your Company Account
FIRST, LET THE IT department know that you’d like to use your Galaxy S5 to 
work with the company’s network and computers. They’ll set up the network to 
let your phone connect. Then all you have to do is add the company account to 
your phone, which works much the same way as adding any other new email 
account.
To get started, on the Home screen, tap Apps→Email. If you haven’t set up an 
email account yet, you’ll come to the usual screen for setting one up (page 245). 
If you’ve already set up an email account, you’ll go to the email account you’ve 
CHAPTER	 14
Taking the Galaxy S5

chapter	 14
already set up, so you’ll need to set up a new account. On the Home screen, tap 
Settings, and in the “User and Backup” area, tap Accounts→Add account.
What happens next depends on what kind of work email account you have. 
Check with your IT gods to find out which kind yours is. There’s a good chance 
you’re using a Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync, so that’s what this chapter cov­
ers. Tap Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync. Then type the user name and password 
you use to log into your work email, and then tap “Manual setup” at the bottom 
of the screen. 
On the screen that appears, enter all the information that your IT folks supplied 
you—the domain name, Exchange server, user name, and so on. You’ll see that the 
user name and password you supplied on the first screen are already filled in.
 TIP 	 Make sure to enter the information in exactly the same way the IT staff gave it to 
you, including whether letters are capitalized. If you make even a single mistake, you may 
not be able to connect.
Ask the IT department exactly what you should use as your user name. If no one 
is around, here are some things you can try:
• The first part of your work email address. If your email address is goodguy@
bighonkingcompany.com, your user name may be goodguy.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Taking the Galaxy S5 to Work 	
337
• The first part of your work email address, plus the company’s Windows 
domain—for example, honkingserver\goodguy. If this looks familiar, it may 
be what you use to log into the company network.
After you input all the information, there’s a chance that you won’t be able to 
connect, and you’ll get an error message that the Galaxy S5 was unable to find 
the right server. If that happens, another screen appears, asking you to input all 
the previous information, plus the server name. You should then be able to con­
nect. If not, check with your IT folks.
 TIP 	 When you type your domain name and user name together, make sure you use the 
backslash key, not the regular slash. On the Galaxy S5, it’s not easy to get to. Tap the Sym 
key at lower left, and on the screen that appears, tap the 1/2 key. The backslash is in the 
second row from the top.
When you’re done, tap Next, and you’re set up and ready to go. If you run into 
any problems, check with the IT staff.
As with your Gmail account, you can choose whether to have your Galaxy S5 
sync your mail, calendar, and contacts. When your new corporate account 
shows up in My Accounts, tap it and you’ll be able to turn each of those on or 
off. You may now use your corporate account the same way you use your other 
accounts for email, contacts, and your calendar.
Virtual Private Networking (VPN)
IF YOUR COMPANY HAS a VPN, you may need to connect to it in order to do 
things like check your email. Check with the IT staff. If your company has a VPN, 
and if you’re permitted to use it, they’ll give you the information that lets your 
Galaxy S5 connect to the corporate network over the VPN. They’ll also set up an 
account for you.
Here’s what you’ll need to set up your S5 to access the VPN:
• The type of technology it uses. The S5 can work with pretty much any 
kind of VPN technology out there. Ask whether yours uses PPTP (Point-to-
Point Tunneling Protocol), L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol), L2TP/IPSec 
PSK (pre-shared, key-based Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol over the IP Security 
Protocol), or L2TP/IPSec CRT (certificate-based Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol 
over the IP Security Protocol). (You don’t have to memorize these terms. 
There’s no quiz later.)
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 14
• Address of the VPN server. The Internet address of the server to which you 
need to connect, such as vpn.bigsecurehoncho.com.
• Name of the VPN server. The name isn’t always needed, but check, just in 
case.
• Account name and password. The IT folks will supply you with this.
• Secret. When it comes to VPNs, there are secrets within secrets. If you use 
an L2TP connection, you’ll need a password called a Shared Secret in addi­
tion to your own password in order to connect.
• Other special keys. Depending on which VPN protocol you use, you may 
require additional keys, which are essentially passwords. Again, the IT folks 
will know this.
• DNS search domains. These servers essentially do the magic of letting you 
browse the Internet and do searches.
Once you’ve got all that, you’re ready to set up the VPN. On the Home 
screen, tap Apps→Settings, and in the Network Connections area, tap More 
networks→VPN. You’ll have a choice between a Basic VPN and an Advanced 
IPsec VPN. Check with your IT folks about which to choose.
After you’ve chosen, before you can set up the VPN, you must first create a 
screen unlock pattern, PIN, or password (page 376). After you’ve done that, 
tap the + sign at the top of the screen that appears. Name the VPN, add the 
server address, choose the type of VPN by tapping the small triangle at the 
bottom right of the Type area, and then tap Save. (If you chose an advanced 
VPN option, you’ll have more to type in.) A reminder: You’ll need to get all these 
settings, including the server address and VPN type, from your IT folks.
The VPN connection you just set up appears on your VPN screen. To connect to 
it, tap it, and then type your VPN user name and password.
From now on, when you want to connect to the VPN, go to Settings and in 
the Network Connections area, choose “More networks”→VPN. Tap the VPN 
network to which you want to connect, enter your user name and password as 
described in this chapter, and then tap Connect. The Status bar shows you that 
you’ve got a VPN connection—or displays a notification if you’ve been discon­
nected, so you can reconnect.
To disconnect, open the Notification panel, touch the notification for the VPN, 
and then touch it again to disconnect.

Using Microsoft’s Office 
Mobile for Android
THE GOLD STANDARD FOR creating and editing documents is Microsoft 
Office, and although your Galaxy S5 can’t rival a computer when it comes 
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 14
to editing, it does give you several ways to work with Microsoft Office docu­
ments, notably Microsoft’s Mobile Office for Android. It’s the mobile version of 
Microsoft’s best-selling Office suite, although it’s not nearly as powerful or as 
useful as the big-boy version of the software.
Mobile Office for Android is free, which is a big deal, because once upon a time 
you had to pay for it. 
 NOTE 	 There’s a chance that as you read this, Microsoft has changed its mind and 
once again is starting to charge to use Mobile Office for Android. If so, it will be part of 
an annual Office 365 subscription, which charges you every year to use Office on multiple 
devices, including computers, smartphones, and tablets.
To install the software, download it from Google Play. You’ll be prompted to 
enter an email address and a password. If you’re already an Office 365 sub­
scriber, make sure to enter that address and password, because when you do 
that, it ties into your Microsoft account, which gives you access to OneDrive and 
all its files.
The app is designed to work with your OneDrive account. So when you run the 
app, if you’re an Office 365 subscriber, it opens to a list of your most recently 
used OneDrive files. Tap any to open it. The file downloads from OneDrive, and 
you’ll then be able to view it or edit it on your S5. The app does a great job of 
keeping fonts, graphics, and so on intact, although it may look somewhat dif­
ferent than it does on your computer, because Office Mobile reformats it for the 
smaller screen of the S5.
To view all the files on your entire OneDrive, tap the folder icon at the top of the 
screen, and then tap your OneDrive. From there you can browse all of your files, 
not just the newest. And from there you can also add new locations for browsing 
files, such as Team Site and SharePoint.
Viewing and Editing Files
When you open a file, you’ll see it with all of its fonts and graphics in place. 
But you can do more than scroll through it. Tap the screen, and a row of icons 
appears across the top. The leftmost brings you to your file list, and the one to 
its right lets you see what is essentially an auto-generated table of contents of 
the document, which lets you jump to any section. The next one to the right lets 
you search for text in the document. The next to the right, which looks like a 
pencil, opens the document for editing. The one on the far right lets you share 
and save files. You can’t edit files created for older versions of Office, such as 
.doc files. You will, however, be able to read them.

 NOTE 	 The capabilities for browsing, searching, editing, and so on vary from app to 
app, so they’ll be slightly different for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
342	
chapter	 14
    
Tap the pencil to edit your document, and document editing tools appear. Don’t 
expect full-blown Office editing tools, because you won’t find them. They vary 
from app to app, and some are quite rudimentary. In Word, for example, you 
can’t choose a specific font or font size, but you can change font attributes like 
bold and italic and make text larger or smaller. Excel lets you add formulas, and 
it’s easy to navigate to different pages of a spreadsheet, but otherwise you’ll 
find limited tools. And PowerPoint is the least powerful of all. You can rearrange 
slides and do basic things such as edit text, but not much else.
 NOTE 	 Office Mobile lets you edit only files in the newest Office formats—.docx, .xlsx, 
and .pptx—not older ones. So you can’t edit files in the .doc, .xls, or .ppt formats.
To create new files, head back to the main Office Mobile page, tap the icon 
at top right, tap the kind of document you want to create, and get to work. 
Especially useful is that there are pre-created templates for you—for example, a 
budget or mileage tracker for Excel, or an outline or report for Word.
Although Office Mobile is far from a powerhouse for editing files, you’ll find its 
tools somewhat useful. But its ability to display Office files is superb, and par­
ticularly useful for reading Office files sent to you via email.

 NOTE 	 Google used to have a free app called Quickoffice that let you read and create 
new Office files. But Google has decided to kill it. It may be on your S5 because it came 
pre-installed, or because you downloaded it. But as I write this, Google is in the process of 
pulling Quickoffice from the Google Play Store so you won’t be able to download it. 
Using Polaris Office
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS to create and edit Office documents. A very good 
app that does that is Polaris Office. It lets you read, create, and edit Word files, 
Excel files, PowerPoint files, and PDF files.
To create a new document from the main screen, tap + and select the type of file 
you want to create. From there, you can create a text document, spreadsheet, or 
presentation in the usual way; the screen and keyboard are just a little smaller 
than what you’re used to. 
 TIP 	 Depending on your carrier, Polaris Office may already be on your S5. Check your 
Apps screen!

chapter	 14
Using Google Docs
AN INCREASING NUMBER OF companies and government agencies use 
Google Docs for creating and sharing documents, including word process­
ing files, spreadsheets, presentations, and more. Google Docs works much 
like Microsoft Office, but the software and all the documents live on the Web, 
where you can share them with others. The basic service is free for individuals, 
although companies of all sizes can pay for pumped-up corporate features.
 NOTE 	 Google also has an app called Google Docs that you can download. So if you 
prefer using an app to the Web, download it from the Google Play Store and start working.
With the Galaxy S5’s browser, you can view all the documents you have access 
to on Google Docs. You can’t edit them in the browser, but you can create new 
documents. Launch your browser and visit Google Docs on the Web at http://
docs.google.com. (If that doesn’t get you to the right location, check with your 
IT department.)
 NOTE 	 If your Google Docs account is associated with a different account from the 
main one on your Galaxy S5, you may have to sign in. Otherwise, you may be automati­
cally signed in when you visit Google Docs. For example, some people maintain separate 
Google accounts for their personal and work email addresses.
You come to a page that shows you all the documents in your Google Drive, 
which is the cloud-based storage where Google Docs stores its files. 
 NOTE 	 When you first use Google Docs on the Web, you may be asked to download the 
Google Drive app—an app that makes it easy to use Google’s cloud-based storage service 
and easier to use Google Docs as well.
To view any document, tap it. The document opens in a built-in Google docu­
ment viewer. You can scroll through the document and zoom in and out using 
the usual finger gestures. You can also use the controls in Google Docs for 
zooming in and out, and moving forward or backward in the document.
You can also create new Word documents and spreadsheets. Tap the icon just 
below the “more” icon, and select the type of document you want to create.

 NOTE 	 If you have PDF files in Google Docs, you’ll be able to read those as well.
When you log into Google Docs, across the top of the screen you’ll see naviga­
tion buttons for other Google services, such as Gmail, your calendar, and more. 
When you tap, you’ll go to those services on the Web, not in any app you may 
have downloaded to your Galaxy S5. To see even more services than those 
shown, tap the “more” down-arrow at upper right.

Google Drive
There’s another way to use Google Docs on the Web—the Google Drive app.

files and any other files you’ve stored on your Google Drive. Simply navigate to a 
file and tap it to open it.

newspaper articles with My

• Use Google Now to make 
your life easier
• Search your S5 by speaking
• Control your S5 with the 
magic of your voice
www.it-ebooks.info

YOUR GALAXY S5 HAS a lot more tricks up its sleeve than you can imagine. 
Any smartphone will do what it’s supposed to do if you press the right buttons 
and use the right screen gestures—but the S5 is a whole lot smarter than you 
think. It doesn’t just respond to your commands; it can learn from your behavior 
and adjust itself to what you want. For example, it knows that you’re headed out 
on vacation, and so suggests a faster way to get to the airport to bypass a traf­
fic jam. It does this with a feature called Google Now.
The S5 can do more as well, with a new feature called My Magazine that scours 
the Web for interesting articles and brings them straight to you, complete with 
graphics. With just a few taps, you can have your own personalized magazine 
right on your phone.
You spend a lot of time talking into your phone when you make phone calls; 
that much is obvious. But you can do a lot more with your voice as well. Want to 
send a text message, get directions to a city or street address, or visit a website? 
Rather than let your fingers do the walking, let your voice do the talking, and 
you can do all that and more.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to use My Magazine, Google Now, voice search, and 
voice control, all of which are built right into the S5.

Using My Magazine
MY MAGAZINE IS A seemingly clairvoyant app that automatically grabs articles 
it thinks you’ll be interested in, based on your activities. It’s a news junkie’s 
dream, because it gleans articles from newspapers, magazines, and websites, 
and displays them complete with photos and graphics. You customize exactly 
what kinds of stories and publications you want to show. It’s easy to use, beauti­
ful to look at, and keeps you up to the minute on everything.
To set it up, on the Home screen, swipe from the left, agree to the terms of use, 
and get started.
Tap any story to read it. To share the story, tap the Share button at the bottom 
of the screen, and you’ll be able to share via Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or 
Google+. You can also share via other apps by tapping the “Share to other apps” 
button. At the top right of the screen, tap the Settings icon for more features as 
well, like changing the text size, style, and brightness; opening the page in the 
browser; and more.
My Magazine is already set up to grab a variety of news feeds from around the 
Web, but it’s easy to change that to your own selections. There’s a lot more to it 
as well. It’s free, and it gives you great sources of information, so if you’re a news 
junkie, or even if you’re not, give it a try.
www.it-ebooks.info

Using it is simplicity itself—tap any article to read it. Down at the bottom of 
the page (or top, depending on your carrier), you can interact with it in various 
ways: Liking it on Facebook, giving it a +1 on Google+, and commenting on it. To 
go to the next article when you’re reading one, simply flip up from the bottom.
 NOTE 	 If you’ve ever used the Flipboard app, My Magazine may look familiar to you. 
That’s because My Magazine is a version of Flipboard updated for the S5.
You can easily customize what kinds of articles My Magazine shows you. Tap the 
Menu button at upper right, select Settings, and you’ll see a list of various kinds 
of content My Magazine can grab for you. Turn on boxes next to those you’re 
interested in, and uncheck the boxes next to those you’re not. That’s all it takes.
 TIP 	 Don’t like My Magazine? You can disable it. Press down on an empty area of any of 
your home screens and tap “Home screen settings.” Then turn off the checkbox next to My 
Magazine.

Using Google Now
IMAGINE HAVING A NEARLY omniscient invisible assistant at your side all day 
long, giving advice when you need it—“Avoid the Mass Pike driving home; there’s 
been an accident”—telling you when packages you’ve ordered online have 
shipped, warning you that your flight has been delayed…pretty much helping 
you take care of the normal business of life.
That’s what Google Now is like. Throughout the day, it displays helpful cards on 
your S5 that give you the information you need and want without your having to 
ask for it. When you wake up in the morning, it can pop up the current weather—
or the weather at your destination, if you’re headed on a trip. It can tell you 
about flight delays, traffic on your daily commute, birthday reminders, and a lot 
more. It does all this through the magic of knowing your patterns of behavior, 
such as buying airline tickets, using your S5 for mapping and navigation, and 
doing web searches for particular items.
 NOTE 	 Some people feel that Google Now has a built-in “creepiness factor”; that it’s 
too intrusive and invades your privacy far too much. Fear not: Google Now springs into 
action only after you’ve told it to. So if you don’t want it hanging around, it won’t.

To turn on Google Now for the first time, hold down the S5’s Home button. A 
screen pops up telling you that you’re about to use Google Now. To learn more, 
tap Next. Keep tapping Next through a series of screen describing Google Now’s 
capabilities. Finally, you get to a screen that asks whether you want to turn 
on Google Now. Tap “Yes, I’m in” to turn it on, or “No, maybe later” to keep it 
dormant.
 TIP 	 If you’ve turned Google Now on and want to turn it off, or if you declined to turn 
it on, don’t worry—it’s easy to switch. Tap the Google search box on the Home screen (or 
anywhere else), and then press the Menu key and select Settings. At the top of the screen, 
move the slider to On or Off.
To turn Google Now on at any time, hold down the Home button. Also, when­
ever you tap into the Google search box to do a search, Google Now appears at 
the bottom of the search. However you launch it, you may find that Google Now 
has already been thinking about you. For example, if you’ve searched for infor­
mation about your favorite sports team—not just on the S5, but using Google 
on your computer or other devices—it shows you news about it. It displays the 
current weather where you live. It may even have recipes for you, news likely to 
interest you, and so on.

It knows all this because it uses your Google Search history, Google Maps his­
tory, and other services you’ve used to do things like make restaurant reserva­
tions, purchase items online, and so on. It then delivers information relevant to 
what you tend to do.
At this point, all you really need to do to use Google Now is to tap the Google 
search box or hold down the Home button. Read on to see how to use it.
Using Cards in Google Now
What’s nifty about Google Now is that once you turn it on, you don’t really need 
to do anything to have it display cards for you. Just go about daily life…and use 
a variety of services on your S5. To understand how Google Now works, you 
need to understand how it interacts with these services.
For example, Google Now typically displays cards that are related to various 
confirmation messages sent to your Gmail account. Say you use OpenTable to 
make a reservation at a restaurant. OpenTable sends a confirmation email to 
your Gmail account, and it includes the location of the restaurant and the time 
of the reservation. That means that before your restaurant reservation comes 
around, you’ll see a card reminding you about it in Google Now. Similarly, if you 
use a package delivery service that sends email updates to your Gmail account, 
that information is displayed in a card as well. Have you searched online for a 
recipe recently? Expect there to be a card waiting for you with search results.
At times, Google also takes a more proactive approach. For example, say that 
you can’t remember the date of Father’s Day this year. Do a search asking

Google when it is. You’ll find right at the top of the search results a link that 
reads “Remind me on Google Now.” Click it to get a reminder card.
Depending on your searches, online habits, map navigation, and other activi­
ties—who knows, maybe even the phase of the moon—the exact cards you see 
may vary. The following are a sample of some common types of cards you’ll 
come across:
• Commuting. Probably at the top of the list of new cards will be one with 
a map, and with text about the kind of traffic on the map. Google asks 
whether it’s the place you normally commute to every day. How does it do 
this? By tracking your location as you go about the day, as you drive, and as 
you use Google Maps. (Yes, it’s creepy.) If it’s the place you normally com­
mute to, tap “Set as work.” Otherwise, tap Edit and type your workplace’s 
location; tap OK. From then on, you get a commuting card showing you the 
traffic en route to work. You can also ask for navigational directions if you 
suddenly suffer from amnesia and can’t remember how to get there.
• Nearby events. Want to know about many different types of events near 
where you are? Tap the “View nearby events” card. What you’ll see is 
exceedingly varied. For one example, I found everything from a Portuguese 
festival to the “Early Risers Horticultural Club” to a UNICEF fundraiser to a 
dance club event to a Red Sox game. Tap any event for more information 
about it.

chapter	 15
    
• Weather. Want to see the weather? This card grabs it for you.
• Stocks. Feel like gambling? Why go to Las Vegas when you can do it in the 
stock market? The Stock card shows you the current state of the market. 
To track specific stocks, tap the small information button (ˆ), and add the 
stocks you’d like to track.
• Next appointment. Tells you when and where your next appointment is. So 
you have no excuse to miss it (even if it’s the dentist).
• Flights. Have you searched for a flight and looked at information about it? 
Then expect a Flight card in your future, showing you when it leaves, when 
it arrives, whether it’s on time, what the traffic is like from your current loca­
tion to the airport, and driving directions. With certain airlines, you’ll even be 
able to get a boarding pass right on your S5.
• Last transit home. This card is for those who use public transportation and 
can’t seem to drag themselves away from work. It detects whether you’re 
still at work, and the last bus, train, subway, or other means of public trans­
portation is going to leave soon. If you don’t want to spend the night sleep­
ing in your office, get a move on. (OK, like all of Google Now, this one is a bit 
creepy and intrusive, considering how much it knows about your life. But it 
sure is trying to be helpful.)
• Movies. Gives information about movies playing nearby.

Using the Magic of Voice 
Search and Voice Control
THE WHOLE WORLD, IT seems, knows about Siri, the iPhone’s search assistant. 
But the S5 also includes voice-powered search and assistance, the one built into 
Android, and there are a lot of people who believe it beats Siri hands-down…or 
is that hands-off?
The best part of Galaxy S5’s Voice Search feature is this: The only thing you 
really need to know is how to talk. Your voice is its command. Launching it is a 
breeze. Simply tap the microphone button to the far right of the Google search 
box. You can do this anywhere you find the Google search box on the S5.
 NOTE 	 The microphone icon shows up wherever the Google Search box does, either 
when you’re visiting Google on the Web or in the Google search box, everywhere you find 
it on the S5.
One of the many amazing things about using voice search is that it seamlessly 
uses two different speech technologies to do what you tell it to: voice recogni­
tion and speech-to-text. With voice recognition, it recognizes the action you 
want to take and then accomplishes the action: “Send text” or “Navigate to,” for 
example.
With speech-to-text, it translates your words into written text and, for example, 
embeds that text in an email or text message. Say you tell your Galaxy S5: “Send 
text to Ernest Hemingway. Consider using young woman and the sea as title 
because demographics are better.” Your Galaxy S5 will find Ernest Hemingway’s 
contact information and then send him the text message, “Consider using young 
woman and the sea as title because demographics are better.”
When you tap the microphone button, all you need to do next is to tell the S5 
what you want it to do, for example, “Find a Japanese restaurant near me.” As 
you speak, the S5 displays onscreen what you’ve told it. Then it goes about and 
does what you’ve told it to do, sending the request to Google and displaying the 
results.
If the S5 can’t connect to Google properly, after a few seconds you’ll see a cryp­
tic message—“Can’t reach Google at the moment. Resend audio.” It’s actually 
asking, in its own confusing way, whether you want to send your request again 
to Google. To do it, tap “Resend audio.” The odds are that, this time around, 
your request will get through.

chapter	 15
    
 NOTE 	 You can use voice search and control capabilities only if you have either a data 
connection or a WiFi connection. If you’ve got only a voice connection, you’re out of luck. 
Ironic, no?
One thing to keep in mind is that you can use your voice to do much more than 
search the Web or find a nearby restaurant. You can also use it to control the S5 
and its apps—compose an email or text message, for example.
What You Can Do with Voice Search
Here are the commands you can issue with Voice Search, along with how to use 
them:
• Send text to [recipient] [message]. Composes a text message to the recipi­
ent with the message that you dictate. If there’s confusion about the recipi­
ent, Voice Search displays potential matches. Choose the one you want.
• Send email to [recipient] [subject] [message]. Composes an email mes­
sage to the recipient with the subject and message that you dictate. As with 
sending a text message, if there’s confusion about a recipient, Voice Search 
shows you possible matches, and you choose the one you want.
• Navigate to [address/city/business name]. Launches the Galaxy S5 
Navigation app to guide you with turn-by-turn directions to the address, city, 
or even a specific business.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
My Magazine, Google Now, and Voice Search and Control	
359
• Call [contact name] [phone type/phone number]. Calls the contact. If the 
contact has more than one phone number, say the type of phone number 
to call—for example, home, work, or mobile. Alternatively, you can dictate a 
phone number, and the Galaxy S5 will call that number.
    
www.it-ebooks.info

	
360	
chapter	 15
 NOTE 	 In addition to looking through your contacts, the Galaxy S5 also searches 
contacts in social networking services such as Facebook that you have installed on your 
phone.
• Map of [address] [city]. Launches Google Maps and opens it to the address 
or city you named.
• Directions to [address] [city]. Launches Google Maps and shows directions 
for how to get to the address or city you named. If the S5 knows your loca­
tion, it uses that as the starting point. If it doesn’t know your location, you 
must type it when Google Maps launches.
• Listen to [artist/song/album]. Don’t expect this to launch the Music app 
and play music—that’s not what it does. Instead, it links you to Google Play, 
where you can buy the track or album. It does this even if you have the 
album or track on your S5. However, as you’ll see in the next entry, there is a 
way to tell the S5 to play music you own on your phone.
• Play music [song name] [artist name]. Launches your usual music-playing 
app. If the S5 recognizes the artist or song you want to play, it will play them 
as well. If not, it simply launches the app, and you can then choose what 
music to play. Before it launches the Music app, the S5 shows you what it’s 
going to play. Then it launches the Music app, which takes over from there.

361
• Call [business name] [location]. Calls the business you named. If there’s 
more than one location, say the location. If the Galaxy S5 finds more than 
one phone number for the business, it lists all of them. Just tap the number 
you want to call. It will even list associated businesses. For example, if a café 
is located inside a bookstore, and you dictate the name of the bookstore, it 
may also list the café’s phone number.
• Go to [website]. Launches your browser to the website you dictated. Often, 
rather than going straight to the website, it displays a list of sites or searches 
that match what you dictated. Tap the one you want to visit.
• [Search term]. Simply say your search term, and the S5 searches the Web, 
using Google.
• [Contact name]. Say the name of a contact you want to open, and your 
Galaxy S5 displays it, along with a list of possible actions, like calling her by 
phone, sending her an email, sending her a text message, and so on. The 
list of actions will vary according to what information you have about that 
contact.
• Open [App name] app. Say this phrase, and the S5 cheerfully responds 
“opening app” before delivering you to the app’s screen.
 NOTE 	 If you say a search term that is also the name of a contact, the Galaxy S5 opens 
the contact, rather than searching the Web.
All this is just a start. In essence, just about anything you can do on the S5 with 
your fingers, you can do with your voice as well.
Editing Text Messages and Email with Voice Search
Voice Search does a great job of converting your speech into text when you 
dictate an email or text message. But it’s not perfect. So you might be leery of 
using Voice Search to dictate a message, worrying that when you dictate, “I love 
you, too,” the message sent will be, “I move YouTube.”
Not to worry. Before you send a text message or email, you get a chance to edit 
the text. When you speak the text message or email, you see the text you’re 
going to send. To send it, tap “Send message” or “Send email,” respectively. 
But if you want to edit the text, simply tap the text itself, and from the screen 
that appears, edit the text. You’ll come to the usual text app or Gmail or email 
program, depending on what you’re sending.

Sending Email with Voice Search
If you don’t use the S5’s voice capabili-
ties carefully when you’re sending an 
email or text, you may find that it’s more 
trouble than it’s worth because you end 
up spending so much time editing. So 
take these steps, and you’ll find sending 
email with voice can be faster than a 
speeding bullet:
• Speak slowly and distinctly. Think 
of the S5 as someone who speaks 
English as a second language and 
still has some learning to do. Speak 
slowly and distinctly, pronouncing 
each word carefully. (But don’t speak 
too slowly and take long pauses 
between words—if you do, Voice 
Search will think you’re done and 
will compose the message before 
you’ve finished dictating it.)
• Speak the words “subject” and 
“message” to fill in those email 
fields. After you say the name of the 
person to whom you want to send 
an email, say the word “subject,” 
and then say the subject of the 
email. Then say the word “message” 
and dictate the message you want 
sent. If you don’t do that, your 
Galaxy S5 will become confused. 
It may interpret what you want to 
be the subject line as several email 
addresses, for example, and will put 
in addresses you don’t want.

RIGHT OUT OF THE box, the Samsung Galaxy S5 is set up for you and ready to 
go. But what if you want to change the way it notifies you when there’s a call, 
fine-tune the way its location services work, or alter its music setup? You turn to 
this chapter, which describes all its settings and explains what they do for you. 
To get to the Settings screen, tap Settings on the Apps screen. You can also 
pull down the Notification panel and tap the Settings icon at the top right of the 
screen—it looks like a gear.
You’ll find nine sections: Quick Settings, Network Connections, Connect and 
Share, Sound and Display, Personalization, Motion, User and Backup, System, 
and Applications. Scroll down to get to them all. Then head to the appropriate 
section of this chapter for the full description and advice.
Quick Settings
AS THE NAME SAYS, this section includes the settings you’ll most commonly 
use, like turning on WiFi, locking the screen, controlling power savings, and 
more. Each of these settings is included in other sections in the Settings app—
for example, WiFi in the Network Connections area, and Lock screen in Sound 
and Display. Rather than describe the same settings twice, this chapter covers 
them only once, under their home category where they can be logically found, 
such as WiFi in the Network Connections area.

Network Connections
THIS SECTION CONTROLS THE many various ways you can connect your S5 
with other devices, including WiFi, Bluetooth, and beyond.
Wi-Fi
Tap On to turn on WiFi; if it’s on, tap Off to turn it off. To connect to a WiFi net­
work, tap the WiFi icon. For details on connecting to WiFi and other networks, 
turn to Chapter 8. You can also turn on WiFi by pulling down the Notification 
panel and using the WiFi widget there.
Download booster
Turn this setting on, and you’ll combine the speed of WiFi with your data con­
nection for a bigger download pipe. See page 190 for details.
Bluetooth
Tap On to turn on Bluetooth (page 91); if it’s on, tap Off to turn it off. As with 
WiFi, there’s a Bluetooth widget on the Notification panel.

• Mobile HotSpot. Turn this on to turn your phone into a mobile hotspot to 
which other devices can connect via WiFi. See page 192 for details.
• Mobile HotSpot range. Gives you your hotspot’s range, based on current 
conditions.
• USB tethering. Lets you give a computer Internet access when it’s plugged 
in via a USB cable.
 NOTE 	 You may need to pay an extra monthly fee if you want to use your Galaxy S5 as 
a mobile hotspot or to use USB tethering. Check with your wireless provider for details.
Airplane Mode
When Airplane mode is turned on, all your wireless radios are turned off, as 
airlines require during parts of the flight. But you can still use all your Galaxy S5 
apps in this mode.
 NOTE 	 Increasingly, airplanes offer WiFi access, so you may not need to use Airplane 
mode during the entire flight. You can turn off all your radios by using Airplane mode, but 
then turn on only WiFi, so you can connect to the airplane’s WiFi hotspot while you’re in 
the air (usually at a price).

Data Usage
If your data plan charges you for data use above a certain limit, make this set­
ting your friend. Tap it, and you’ll come to a screen that shows your data use for 
the month. That way, you can see whether you’re on track to stay under your 
limit. Tap “Set mobile data limit,” and after a limit that you set, your data con­
nection will be turned off.
 TIP 	 Your carrier may calculate data usage differently from your S5 does, so to be on 
the safe side, set the limit at less than your actual limit.
Location 
Lets various Google apps access your location—or not. It’s up to you. Tap it, then 
turn it on or off via the switch at top right. With Location turned on, you can use 
map apps and other location-based apps more accurately, but you’ll also use up 
more of your battery. The screen also shows you which apps have requested to 
use your location.
More Networks
This setting is a bit of a misnomer, since it’s not really about other networks. 
Instead, it’s a grab bag of other wireless and network settings.

Default messaging app
Lets you change the app that your S5 uses for messaging. Out of the box, it uses 
the S5’s built-in messaging app. If you have other messaging apps installed, 
though, you can use them instead. Tap this setting, and choose which app you 
want to use.
Mobile Networks
Here’s where to configure a variety of options related to your wireless pro­
vider, such as whether to use the data network and how to handle roaming 
when you’re outside the provider’s network and can connect to another carrier. 
(Depending on your plan, you may be charged for roaming.)
VPN Settings
Here’s where you can set up a virtual private network (VPN) connection (page 
337) with your workplace and—once you’ve set it up—change settings like its 
URL, password, means of authentication, and so on. You’ll need to get informa­
tion from your company’s IT gurus to make the connection, so check with them 
for details.
WiFi Calling
This feature is a godsend if you’re ever out of range of your carrier’s signal but 
within range of a WiFi network. When it’s turned on, you can make phone calls 
via a WiFi network, even when you’re not connected to your carrier’s phone 
signal.

and share files and other information. For details, see Chapter 13.
NFC
Tap this to turn on NFC (near field communication), which lets you share files 
with other nearby devices that use NFC. Not many other devices use NFC, so 
you may be waiting a long time to use this, unless you come across another S5 
owner.
Nearby devices
Tap this, and you’ll come to a page that lets you share files with other devices 
on a WiFi network. You can also configure the way you share by choosing which 
devices are allowed to share, which files you want to share, and so on.

Sound
Tap here for many sound options, including the following:
• Volume. Tap to set the volume for media, notifications, system sounds, and 
your ringtone. A slider appears that lets you set the volume for each individ­
ually. The Galaxy S5 plays the new volume level when you move the slider, so 
if you’re not satisfied with what you hear, change it until you reach the level 
you want. Tap OK when you’re done.

 NOTE 	 To set the overall sound volume for your Galaxy S5, use the volume buttons 
along its left-hand side, near the top.
• Vibration intensity. Tap to control the intensity of vibration for calls, noti­
fications, and feedback from the phone when you tap certain keys or take 
certain actions—for example, when you unlock the phone, press a key on the 
dialer or keyboard, or add a widget. (It’s called haptic feedback.)
• Ringtones. Tap this to change your ringtone. When you tap it, a list of avail­
able ringtones appears, including the one you’re currently using. Browse the 
list, tap the new one you’re considering, and you hear a preview. Select the 
one you want, and then tap OK to make it your ringtone.
• Vibrations. Yes, you can even customize the type of vibration the phone 
makes when you get a call. Tap here to do it. Choose from Basic call, 
Heartbeat, Jinglebell, Ticktock, Waltz, and Zig-zig-zig.

Display
Change your display options here. Tap this listing, and you get more options 
than you can imagine. This section focuses on the most important ones:
• Brightness. Normally, the Galaxy S5 chooses a screen brightness appropri­
ate for the ambient lighting—less light in the dark, and more in sunlight, for 
example. If you’d prefer to set it at a specific brightness level, and have it 
stay at that level until you change it, tap this option. From the screen that 
appears, turn off the “Automatic brightness” checkbox. A slider appears that 
lets you manually set the brightness level.
• Screen rotation. Turn on this little bit of magic, and the S5 uses the front 
camera to automatically rotate the screen based on the orientation of your 
face. 
• Smart stay. Keeps your screen on as long as you’re looking at it, even if you 
don’t touch the screen for beyond the time you’ve set for screen timeout, 
explained next.
• Screen timeout. In order to save battery life, the Galaxy S5’s screen goes 
blank after a set amount of time. You can set that to as little as 15 seconds 
or as much as 10 minutes. Tap this option, and then choose the interval you 
want. 
 NOTE 	 If you have “Smart stay” turned on, it will override screen timeout.

Here are a couple of other display settings to pay attention to:
• Touch key light duration. When you press one of the buttons at the bottom 
of your Galaxy S5, the keys light up and stay lit for a few seconds. This set­
ting lets you change the setting to 1.5 seconds, 6 seconds, always off, always 
on, or on only in the dark.
• Auto adjust screen tone. If you’d like to get every bit of use out of your 
battery, turn on this setting. It saves power by analyzing the image on your 
screen and adjusting the LCD brightness accordingly.
Wallpaper
You can change the wallpaper background of your Home screen and Lock 
screen (page 28). Tap here, select which you want to change, and follow the 
prompts.
Lock screen
Worried about someone unauthorized using your S5? No problem. Tap here, 
and you’ll come to all the ways you can control how your device locks. The most 
important setting is “Screen lock.” When your screen is locked, all you normally 
need to do is swipe the lock to the right to unlock it. Trouble is, that’s all anyone 
needs to do to gain access to your phone. Select the “Screen lock” option, and 
you’ll be able to set many different methods for unlocking your screen, including 
setting a PIN, using a pattern you draw on the screen, and even using the S5’s 
fingerprint reader. Tap the method you wish to use and follow the directions for 
doing it.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
376	
chapter	 16
To create a PIN, first tap “Screen lock.” From here you can set several methods 
for securing your S5, including via a PIN or by a pattern lock. Select PIN, type in 
the PIN, confirm it, and you’re ready to go. If you instead select a pattern lock, 
follow the instructions for drawing a pattern, and then confirm it. It’s important 
that you remember the PIN or pattern to unlock your phone, because if you 
forget, you’ll have to reset your phone to its factory settings to get into it (page 
384).
Unlocking with your own fingerprint is the most secure. Tap Fingerprint, and 
follow the directions. You’ll first “register” your fingerprint, in other words, have 
the S5 scan it so that it will recognize it in the future. You’ll swipe your finger 
across the four-dot rows and over the home button eight times, each time wait­
ing for a green circle to appear so you can do it again. After you’re done, you’ll 
be asked whether you want to use your fingerprint to unlock the screen, or to 
use a PIN or a swiping gesture. You can register more than one fingerprint if you 
want other people to be able to unlock your S5. Here are the most important 
settings:

Toolbox
This cool feature gives you super-quick access to your most-used apps. The 
Toolbox is a floating button that when tapped displays shortcuts to your apps, 
and lets you launch any by tapping its icon. Tap the Toolbox icon, and then move 
the switch from Off to On. By default there are a handful of popular apps on it, 
including the camera, web browser, notepad, and several others. But it’s easy to 
delete what’s already there or add new ones. After you’ve turned the Toolbox 
on, tap the Edit key and customize it however you’d like.
One-handed operation
The S5 is a big phone, and it can be hard to use with one hand. Turn on this set­
ting to make it easier. It automatically adjusts your screen size and its layout for 
using with one hand. After you turn on the setting, hold the S5 in the hand you’ll 
use it with, and then slide your thumb from the edge of the screen to the middle 
of the screen and back, in a single motion. The S5 will adjust the screen and 
layout just for you.
Personalization

Easy mode
Whether you’re a smartphone pro or just getting started, you can choose the 
Home screen that works best for you. Tap here to use Easy mode. Easy mode 
strips down the standard Home screen and uses a much simpler layout and 
larger, easier-to-see icons. For details, see page 27. To switch back to Standard 
mode, tap here and choose it.
Accessibility
Here’s where to go if you have vision, hearing, or dexterity issues and want to 
make the S5 more suited for you. For example, when you tap Vision, you have a 
number of settings to choose from, including choosing Talkback, in which the S5 
reads the screen to you, changing the font size, using gestures to magnify the

 TIP 	 The Accessibility section also includes a somewhat hidden feature that serves as 
a baby monitor. From this section, select Hearing→“Baby crying detector” and drag the 
“Baby crying detector” switch on. Then tap the big arrow in the middle of the screen and 
when the S5 hears a crying baby, it vibrates. Of course, as any parent will tell you, human 
beings are exquisitely attuned to their own babies’ crying, so it’s not clear what this 
feature really offers.

Finger scanner
Lets you use your fingerprint as a way to unlock the S5’s Lock screen. For 
details, see the “Lock screen” section on page 375.
Motion 
HERE’S WHERE YOU CONTROL all the Galaxy S5’s motion features:
Motion and gestures
You’ll find plenty of motion magic when you tap here:
• Air browse. With this turned on, you can scroll through lists and other 
content such as the body of emails just by moving your hand over the screen 
in the direction you want to scroll. Once you turn it on, you can customize 
which apps it works with, such as email, the Gallery, Browser, and Music.
• Direct call. With this on, you can call someone whose message or contact 
details are currently on the screen, simply by bringing the S5 close to your 
ear.
• Smart alert. With this turned on, the S5 will vibrate when you pick it up if 
you’ve missed any calls or messages.
• Mute/pause. Mutes or pauses music or a call when you cover the screen with 
your hand, or if you turn the device over. On the same screen you can turn 
on the “Smart pause” feature, which is a remarkable feature that detects 
when you’re watching video and will pause it when you look away from the 
screen.
• Palm swipe to capture. Need to take a screenshot? Just swipe the bottom 
edge of your hand across the screen from one side to the other, making sure 
your hand touches the screen. If you want to take screenshots but don’t 
want to use this gesture, you can always use the S5’s built-in way to do it: 
Press the On/Off and Home screen button at the same time.
Air view
With “Air view” turned on, when you hover your finger above the screen, it will 
preview information or enlarge information or pictures. For example, hover over

User and Backup
THIS SECTION HAS SETTINGS for controlling all your accounts, both on the 
phone and in the cloud, and for backing up and resetting your phone.
Accounts
Controls all the accounts you have on your S5. Depending on how you’ve set it 
up and what apps you’ve got installed, there may be many of them, or only a 
few. So what you see on your S5 may vary from what you see here. You’ll find 
a listing for your Google account, for your Samsung account if you’ve created 
one, for the S Health account (see page 303) if you have one, and for accounts 
associated with other apps you’ve installed, such as Facebook, Twitter, Evernote, 
and more.
• Google. This section handles everything about your Google account, includ­
ing how it syncs and your privacy settings. Tap Sync settings to customize 
how various Google services sync, such as the Calendar, Gmail, Google 
Drive, and others. Check the boxes next to any Google services you want to 
sync, and uncheck the boxes next to those you don’t want to sync.

Cloud
Controls how Samsung stores, syncs, backs up, and restores data between your 
phone and Samsung’s cloud services. Tap “Sync settings” to turn syncing on or 
off for various services such as the Samsung Calendar, your contacts, and more. 
Tap “Storage usage” to see how much data various services are using on your 
phone. Backup backs up your data; Restore does what it says—restores your 
data from the backup.
Backup and reset
Backs up your data and account. Also lets you choose the nuclear option of 
restoring your S5 to the way it was before you opened it—factory pristine with 
no data or accounts on it. These are the important settings you’ll see here:
• Back up my data. Backs up your Galaxy S5 settings and data to Google’s 
servers so if you later have a problem with your Galaxy S5, you can restore 
the settings and data. Obviously, if you don’t feel safe with your data riding 
on an anonymous server somewhere, turn this option off.
• Automatic restore. With this turned on, if you uninstall an app and then later 
decide that you want to install it again, the Galaxy S5 automatically grabs 
the relevant data you’ve backed up using the “Back up my data” option and 
puts it back on your Galaxy S5.

• Factory data reset. When you’re ready to get rid of your phone, you won’t 
want anyone else to get all your data. Tap this button and then follow the 
onscreen instructions for setting the Galaxy S5 back to the way it was before 
you began using it. It deletes all your data, eliminates any changes you made 
to the phone, deletes any apps you’ve installed, and makes the phone look 
and work exactly the way it did when it was shipped from the factory.
System 
HERE’S WHERE YOU’LL FIND a wide variety of settings having to do with 
every aspect of the S5’s system.
Language and Input
This section lets you change the language you use, as well as other keyboard 
options and voice search customizations.

Keyboards and input methods
You get to choose whether to use the Samsung keyboard, or another one, such 
as the Google keyboard, which lacks some of the Samsung keyboard’s features, 
such as swiping to enter text. When you choose your keyboard, you can tap the 
Settings icon next to it to change that keyboard’s settings, such as whether to 
use the predictive text feature, whether to auto-capitalize, and so on.
    
Voice search
Lets you choose a variety of options related to searching by voice, such as 
whether to hide offensive words in voice results.
Text-to-speech options
In this section you can customize various speech options, such as whether to 
block the results of a voice search using offensive words. Uncheck it if you don’t 
want those results blocked. Choose the Google or Samsung search engine. You 
can tap the Settings icon to adjust how it works.
Read notifications aloud
With this on, your S5 will read new notifications to you, such as for incoming 
calls, text, and emails.

Pointer speed
Can you guess what this does? That’s right, you win! It controls how fast your 
pointer responds to you. Tap it and move the slider to adjust the speed of the 
pointer.
Date and Time
Choose from these settings for the date and time.
Automatic date and time
As long as this checkbox is turned on, you won’t have to worry about setting the 
date and time—the Galaxy S5 automatically gets it from your wireless provider’s 
network, including your location (to set your time zone).
Set date
If you haven’t turned on the Automatic setting and want to set the date yourself, 
tap here to do so.
Set time
If you’re not on Automatic, tap here and choose your time.
Automatic time zone
With this turned on, your S5 automatically adjusts its time to the current time 
zone.

Select time zone
Use this to select your time zone if you’re not on Automatic time zone.
Use 24-hour format
Tap if you prefer the 24-hour format—14:00 instead of 2 p.m., for example.
Select date format
You’ve got other options here if you don’t like the U.S. standard (09/22/2014), 
including 22/09/2014, and 2014/09/22.
Safety Assistance
This emergency feature is designed to have the S5 automatically alert people if 
you need emergency assistance. Not only will it send texts, but it will also send 
your location information. Tap to turn it on, and then follow the directions for 
setting up to four emergency contacts. After that, if you run into an emergency 
and need assistance, you press the Power/Lock button three times quickly. That 
sends an emergency text message to your emergency contacts, along with loca­
tion information, photos from your front- and back-facing cameras, and a short 
voice recording, if you want to create one.
Accessories
This section controls a grab bag of ways the S5 works with accessories like 
docks. It also lets you determine what audio output you want to use—stereo or 
surround sound.
Battery
Launches a screen that shows your current battery usage, whether to show the 
battery percentage on the Status bar, and most important, what has been using 
your battery. It’s very useful if you want to figure out how to extend your bat­
tery life, because it tells you what’s been drinking juice.
Power Saving
Galaxy S5 owners, like most people who use powerful smartphones, tend to be 
obsessive about battery life, and want to wring every last minute out of their 
batteries without giving up any of the phone’s considerable power. This section 
helps you save battery life by controlling its power saving mode.
www.it-ebooks.info

chapter	 16
Power saving mode
With this setting turned on, your Galaxy S5 will switch to power saving mode 
when your battery gets low. Here are the features it uses when you turn it on:
• Block background data. This saves battery life by stopping apps from get­
ting data in the background. When you turn on power saving mode, you 
have an additional choice of using this option or not by checking or uncheck­
ing the box next to it.
• Grayscale mode. Turns off color and displays everything in shades of gray.
Ultra power saving mode
Power saving mode isn’t good enough for you? You want to save even more 
power? Then turn on this mode. It turns off WiFi and Bluetooth, turns off your 
data connection when the screen goes off, shows everything in shades of gray, 
and limits the apps you can use to the default ones (although you can add oth­
ers if you want).
Storage
Here’s where to get details about the storage on your phone and SD card (page 
19). It shows you how much total space you have; how much has been used; and 
how much is used by various content types, such as applications, pictures, vid­
eos, and so on. For more information about your storage use, tap the appropri­
ate section—for example, tap Used Space to see what is using up your storage 
space.

At the bottom of the screen, in the SD card section, tap “Mount SD card” if you 
haven’t yet installed an SD card. Put the card in the phone, get here, and tap 
this so you can use the card. If you’ve already installed an SD card and need to 
remove your SD card for any reason, tap “Unmount SD Card” before removing 
the card. If you’re installing a new SD card, or if your existing one gets corrupted 
for some reason, tap “Format SD card” to format it. Keep in mind that when you 
format an SD card, you erase all its contents.
If you’ve got an SD card installed, you’ll get details about the storage on the SD 
card, including the total and available space.
Security
Worried about others getting access to your phone and all its data? This section 
lets you lock them out…or not, depending on how you like to balance security 
with ease of use.
Encrypt device
If you turn this on, your phone will be encrypted; that is, its contents will be 
scrambled so no one who happens to break into your information will be able 
to read it. To unscramble them, you’ll need a password in addition to any screen 
lock.
Encrypt external SD card
Turning this on encrypts your SD card, so that a password will be required to 
access its data.

Set up SIM card lock
Select this option, and you can set a PIN that anyone who wants to use your 
phone has to type in. It applies only to the SIM card currently in the phone.
Make passwords visible
With this option turned on, you can see passwords as you type them. This setup 
makes it easier to ensure that you’re typing in passwords correctly, but it could 
theoretically be a security risk if someone looks over your shoulder as you type.
Device administrators
Unless you’re an IT god, you don’t need to know all these settings. However, 
two are important. If you turn on “Unknown sources,” you can download apps 
outside of Google Play. And if “Verify apps” is turned on, you’ll get a warning if 
you try to install an app that the S5 thinks might be dangerous.
Unknown sources
Turn this setting on if you want to be able to download apps from places other 
than the Play store—for example, from the Web. Keep in mind that when you do 
this, you may be more vulnerable to attack, because Google tries to keep the 
Play store free from apps that are malicious.

Verify apps
Blocks or warns you about apps before you install them that might invade your 
privacy or do harm to the S5.
Security policy updates
Automatically downloads any new security policies to your S5 that can help 
keep it safe. Obviously, keep this one turned on.
Send security reports
With this setting turned on, if the S5 detects any potential security issues, it will 
send information about them to Samsung over WiFi.
Credential storage
Your IT gods need to know about this section, not you, so skip it and leave it 
as is.
Help
Here’s where to go for help with your S5.
About Device
Go here for more information than you can ever imagine about your phone, 
including the version of the Android software you’re running, your current signal 
strength, whether you’re roaming, and much more. Much of what you find here 
is informational only.

Software update
Tap here to check whether you need to update your S5’s software. It checks to 
see if an update is needed. If it is, follow the instructions for installing it.
 NOTE 	 Technically, you don’t need to update your phone’s software manually by tap­
ping “Check for updates.” Updates are automatically delivered to you over your wireless 
provider’s network, via what’s called an over the air (OTA) update (see the Note on page 
63).
Status
Tap for a mind-boggling amount of detail about your phone’s status, including 
its signal strength, whether it’s roaming, the battery level, your phone numbers, 
the phone’s WiFi MAC address (a unique number that identifies your Galaxy S5), 
the network you’re using, and a barrage of techie details that only a full-time 
geek could love.
Legal information
Here’s where you can while away the hours reading Google’s terms of service, 
and the licenses that govern the use of Android. If you’re not a lawyer, you don’t 
want to read this. In fact, even if you are a lawyer, you don’t want to read this.

Other information
The rest of the screen gives you a variety of very technical information that you 
most likely will never need to know, such as the kernel version and the base­
band version. However, if you ever need tech support, you may need to read the 
information to a techie.

Application Manager
Tap to launch the nifty Application Manager, which lets you control how your 
apps work. Page 298 has the details.
Default Applications
Lets you set which applications the S5 should use for different features, such 
as which app it should use for messaging. Out of the box, it uses the built-in 
Messages app, but you can use others you install, such as Google Hangouts.
Tap Home if you want to change how your Home screen works. Normally it’s 
Samsung’s TouchWiz, but you can change it to the TouchWiz Easy mode screen, 
that offers a simpler, stripped-down look. See page 379 for details.
Calendar
This section lets you change a variety of settings, including whether to show 
events that you’ve declined, whether to show week numbers, and more. This 
affects only the Samsung Calendar, not Google Calendar. For details about 
Google Calendar, see page 161.

Call
There are plenty of easy-to-use settings here. For example, tap “Answering 
and ending calls” to have the S5 let you answer calls by pressing the Home key, 
using voice control, or waving your hand over the screen. There are plenty of 
other settings as well, such as for turning on or off call notification pop-ups, and 
turning WiFi calling on or off. (See page 370 for details.)
Contacts
Here’s where to change settings for the Contacts app. The most important entry 
is the Import/Export one, which lets you import or export contacts from a USB 
drive or SIM card. You can also choose to display contacts either by first name 
or last name, among other options. There’s also a setting for adding an account 
that will import contacts, such as from Facebook or others.
Email
There are a handful of settings here. The “Manage accounts” one is useful if you 
want to create a new email account or delete an existing one. For information 
about setting up new email accounts, see page 245. Also pay attention to the 
Display setting, which lets you change options such as many lines to display in 
the message preview (out of the box, it’s one, but your choice is between zero 
and three). And in the Display settings, you might want to turn on the “Auto fit 
content” feature, which will shrink email content so that it fits the screen. Finally, 
if you’re prone to send off an email and then wish you hadn’t, turn on the “Delay 
email sending” option, which delays emails before sending them, so you can 
cancel them before they’re sent. Think of it as the “Don’t insult the boss” option.
Gallery
You probably won’t want to change any Gallery features, but there are some 
settings here that you might want to pay attention to. If you’re worried about 
going over your data plan limits for the month, make sure the box is checked 
next to “Sync via Wi-Fi only.” That way you won’t use up gobs of bandwidth by 
sending photos over your data network. Out of the box, it’s turned on, so it’s a 
good idea to keep it that way. You can also turn on the “Face tag” feature, which 
will automatically tag the faces of people in photos. (See page 122 for details.) 
The “Filter by” setting is useful if you want to turn off the various ways that the 
Gallery lets you filter photos—by People, Scenery, Food, Pets, and so on.

Internet
Here’s where to go for doing things such as setting your homepage and select­
ing the kind of Internet data you want to sync if you have a Samsung account, 
such as bookmarks and currently open web pages. If you get weary of filling out 
Web forms manually, tap “Auto fill forms” and then “Add profile,” and you’ll be 
able to pop information directly into web forms, such as your name and address, 
phone number, and email address.
The Privacy section is worth visiting, because it lets you turn off many features 
that you might worry affect your privacy. For example, normally the S5 suggests 
search terms and web pages when you do a search, which is a very useful fea­
ture. But in order for it to work, it means Google needs to remember your past 
searches. So you may want to turn off its checkbox. And if you want to clean out 
Internet data, such as your browsing history, cache, passwords, and more, tap 
“Delete personal data,” turn on the boxes next to what you want deleted, and 
then tap Done.
There are also a variety of other miscellaneous settings on the Internet settings 
screen, such as for changing font and screen settings when viewing web pages.

Messages
There’s plenty here, most of which you probably don’t care about, but there are 
some notable settings you might want to check out. Tap Signature to create an 
email signature (see page 242), and tap Notifications if you want to turn noti­
fications on or off. Tap “Spam filter” if you get messaging spam and want to 
cut down on it. There are several ways the S5 can block messaging spam. You 
can enter specific phone numbers that you want to be considered as spam and 
be blocked, you can add phrases that you want to be considered as spam (for 
example, any that ask if you want to enlarge certain private body parts), and you 
can block all unknown senders. And if you also send messages and then wish 
you hadn’t, tap “Delay message sending” to turn it on. That way, your messages 
won’t be sent immediately, and you can cancel them before sending.

weather by saying “Today’s weather,” make phone calls or send texts by speak­
ing the instructions, and performing voice searches. Once you turn it on, you can 
customize it by changing the language it understands, hiding offensive words, 
and more.
The S5 already includes Google’s very good voice search and voice control fea­
tures, so you may not see much of a need for using S Voice. But if you do, here’s 
where to turn it on and customize it. For details about Google’s voice search and

SETTING UP YOUR SAMSUNG Galaxy S5 is easy, especially if you buy it at your 
wireless carrier’s store. There, the sales folk will walk you through the process 
of activating your phone and signing up for a plan. If you buy your Galaxy S5 
over the Web, you set everything up either on the Web or over the phone. This 
appendix tells you everything you need to know.
Choosing a Plan
WHEN YOU BUY A Samsung Galaxy S5, you’ll usually get it in conjunction with 
a one- or two-year service plan in addition to the cost of the phone. When you 
buy a plan, your provider knocks a few hundred dollars off the list price that 
usually runs between $600 and $700. The cost of the plan varies according to 
how many minutes of talk you want each month, and whether you want text 
messaging as well. Your carrier offers enough permutations to meet almost any 
need imaginable.
For the most recent rates, visit your wireless carrier’s website. You’ll have to 
buy a data plan, and you may also have a data cap, which means that if you use 
more than a certain amount of data in any given month, you’ll pay extra. You 
can buy texting on a per-text or unlimited basis. Heavy texters will find that the 
unlimited plan is cheaper in the long run, while occasional texters will do better 
paying on a per-text basis.

Your Phone Number
The phone number you use on your Galaxy S5 depends on whether you already 
have an account with your existing provider:
• Keeping your old number. If you already have an account with your pro­
vider, you can have an old cellphone number transferred to your new Galaxy 
S5. Transferring the number to your new phone usually takes an hour or less. 
During that transition time, you can make calls with your Galaxy S5, but you 
can’t receive them.
• Getting a new number. If you don’t already have an account with your pro­
vider, the company will assign you a new phone number. They’ll try to give 
you one within your area code, and they may have several numbers you can 
choose from. Once you get the new phone number, you can start making 
and receiving calls.
 TIP 	 If you already have an account with your provider, you may not be able to get the 
reduced price when you switch to a Galaxy S5. Providers usually require you to have your 
current phone for a certain amount of time—usually a year or more—before you can get 
a reduced price for buying a new phone. However, if you have a family phone plan, there 
may be a workaround. If one of your family members’ lines is eligible, you may be able to 
get the reduced price. Just make sure that your provider connects your Galaxy S5 to your 
phone number and not the family member’s.
Making Account Changes on the Web
YOU CAN CHANGE THE details of your plan anytime—for example, adding new 
services, or taking away old ones—via the Web. Sure, you can do the same thing 
by showing up at one of your carrier’s stores, but it’s much easier on the Web. 
Head to your provider’s website.
Upgrading to the Newest Software
YOUR SAMSUNG GALAXY S5 uses the Android operating system, built by 
Google. The S5 also includes some tweaks and changes that Samsung made to 
Android, so your phone’s software will look a bit different from other phones 
running Android.
www.it-ebooks.info

	
Setup and Signup

Google regularly upgrades the Android operating system, but unlike with a 
computer, you won’t need to buy the upgraded software, or even download it. 
Instead, it comes automatically to your phone, by an over the air (OTA) upgrade. 
You don’t need to do anything about it; it happens automatically.
 TIP 	 Wondering which version of Android you’re running? The Galaxy S5 will be happy 
to tell you. From the Home screen or any pane, press the Menu key and then select 
Settings→More→“About device.” Look at the Android version number for the version of 
Android you’ve got on your phone.
To check whether your phone has the latest and greatest software from Google 
and Samsung, from the Home screen or any pane, from the Apps screen select 
Settings→“About device”→“Software update.” The phone will let you know 
whether your system is up to date. If an upgrade is available, the phone will ask 
if you want to install the new software, and then do so over the air.
 NOTE 	 After Google releases a new version of Android, it takes at least a month—
maybe even several months or more—before your Galaxy S5 gets its OTA update. That’s 
because Samsung has to add its tweaks to the new version of Android and make sure 
everything works properly on the Galaxy S5.

accessories are available and a sampling of where to buy.
Useful Accessories
IF YOU ENJOY TRICKING out your car or accessorizing your outfits to the max, 
there’s plenty of Galaxy S5 bling out there for you to find. If, however, you’re in 
the market for something useful, consider the following:
• Samsung Galaxy Gear watch. It’s Dick Tracy time. This smart watch teams 
with your Galaxy S5 to put amazing things on your wrist. Make phone calls, 
lock and unlock your phone, get notifications from your S5, and more.
• Gear Fit. This wearable wristband partners with your S5 to track your activ­
ity level and the progress of your workout. It also receives notifications from 
your S5.
• Cases. Cases protect the Galaxy S5 against damage—when you drop it, for 
example. You’ll find plenty of kinds of cases to choose from, depending on 
your style preferences, budget, and needs. You’ll find hard protective cases, 
rubberized protective cases, holsters with belt clips, and more.

• Screen protectors. These thin sheets of plastic safeguard your S5’s glass 
screen, greatly reducing the risk of scratches. They’re thin enough so that 
you won’t notice they’re there.
• Car chargers. Plug one end into your S5 and the other into your 12-volt 
power outlet, and you can charge your phone while you’re on the go.
• HDMI adapter. This adapter lets you connect your S5 to a TV and watch HD 
video from your phone on the TV’s big screen.
• Multimedia docking station. Put your S5 into the docking station, and you 
can watch video, use it as a digital picture frame, and so on. You can also 
connect an HDMI cable from it to a TV.
• Chargers and cables. There are plenty of battery chargers and USB cables 
you can buy to supplement or replace the ones that came with your Galaxy 
S5, including portable chargers.
• Bluetooth headset. With one of these, you can talk on your Galaxy S5 by 
speaking into the wireless headset.
• Headphones. You’ll want these to listen to your music collection. 
Headphones can be as cheap as $30 or less for basic ones without great 
sound, or up to $300 or more for high-end noise-canceling ones. It’s a good 
idea to try them out, or at least read reviews before buying.
• External and Bluetooth speakers. Want to share your music with others? 
Get external speakers to plug into the Galaxy S5. There are plenty made for 
portability, with surprisingly good sound. Increasingly popular are Bluetooth 
speakers, so that you don’t need to physically connect your S5 to them. 
Merely make a Bluetooth connection.
• MicroSD cards. These cards give you plenty of extra storage. The S5 can 
handle ones with up to 128 GB of additional memory. The higher the storage 
capacity, the more you’ll pay. For example, you can generally get a 128 GB 
card for between $70 and $120, and a 64 GB card for about $40 to $60.
Places to Shop
THERE ARE COUNTLESS PLACES online where you can buy Galaxy S5 acces­
sories, but you want to make sure to order from someplace reputable, and 
where they know what works with your phone. Here are a few of the best:
• Samsung (http://bit.ly/1nJVthp). You can buy accessories straight from 
Samsung, which makes the Galaxy S5. Head here and shop to your heart’s 
content. Prices here tend to be higher than elsewhere, and there’s less of

a selection. However, what you buy here is guaranteed to work with the 
Galaxy S5!
• Shopandroid (http://www.shopandroid.com/). Sells accessories for many 
types of Android phones, including the Galaxy S5.
• Best Buy (www.bestbuy.com). Both the physical stores and the website are 
well worth checking out for a wide range of products. You can even order 
online, choose a nearby store where you’ll pick up what you’re ordering, and 
it will be waiting for you when you get there.
• Your carrier. The place that sells the Galaxy S5 also sells accessories. As 
with Samsung, prices tend to be high and selection low. Go to your carrier’s 
website and search for accessories. There may be some available at its brick-
and-mortar store as well.
• Amazon (www.amazon.com). This shopping site has a good selection of 
accessories. Search for Samsung Galaxy S5.

THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S5 runs on the Android operating system, so it’s vul­
nerable to the same kinds of problems that can occur in any computer operat­
ing system. Like any electronic device, the Galaxy S5 can be temperamental at 
times. This appendix gives you the steps to follow when your phone is having…
issues.
Make Sure Your Software Is Up to Date
NO COMPUTER OR PHONE is ever perfect; neither is any operating system. 
So phone makers and software companies constantly track down and fix bugs. 
They then send those fixes to you via software updates delivered wirelessly—
called over the air (OTA) updates (page 63).
So if you have a bug or other nagging problem with your phone, there may 
already be a fix for it via one of these updates. You shouldn’t have to do any­
thing to install these updates, because they’re delivered automatically. On the 
off chance that you didn’t get your update, you can check and download it man­
ually. To do it, from the Apps screen, tap Settings→“About device”→“Software 
update.” The phone will let you know whether your system is up to date. If an 
upgrade is available, the phone will ask if you want to install the new software, 
and then do so over the air.

Fixing a Frozen Phone
IT’S EVERY PHONE OWNER’S nightmare: Your phone won’t respond to any of 
your taps, or even when you press any of its hard keys. There’s seemingly noth­
ing you can do.
Often, your best bet is to try a quick reset by removing and replacing the bat­
tery, and then turning on your phone again. First turn off the phone. Then, to 
remove the battery, flip the Galaxy S5 over, put your fingernail underneath 
the small slot on the upper right, and remove the cover. You’ll see the battery. 
Gently remove it.
After you’ve taken it out, put the battery back into place and put the cover back 
on. Now turn on the Galaxy S5. In many cases, this thaws your frozen phone.
Correcting Email Settings
THE GALAXY S5 EASILY syncs with your Gmail account, but when you add 
other email accounts—like your work email or home ISP account—you have to 
enter all the account and server information yourself. And that’s where errors 
can creep in despite your best efforts. Even if you set the account up success­
fully at first, you may encounter problems later, like being unable to send email.
If Email Doesn’t Work at All
If you’re having trouble getting email to work for the first time, the most likely 
problem is that you’ve got a setting wrong, like your incoming or outgoing 
server. To check these settings, on the Apps screen tap Settings→Email and tap 
the name of the account you’re having problems with. Then tap More Settings 
and scroll to the bottom of the screen. Check the Incoming settings and the 
Outgoing settings, and make sure you’ve entered everything correctly. Even a 
single misplaced letter or number will cause a problem. Check your ISP’s website 
or call your ISP to confirm the settings. You may have copied down the settings 
wrong, or your ISP has different settings for accessing email on a mobile phone. 
If it’s a work email account, call your company’s IT department for assistance:
• Make sure you actually have a WiFi or cellular signal. You can’t send or 
receive email if you don’t have a connection.
• If you’re connected via WiFi, try turning it off to see if that solves the 
problem—just make sure you have a cellular signal.

If You Can’t Send Email
Any computer—including your Galaxy S5, which is, after all, a computer—uses 
ports to communicate with the Internet. They’re not physical things; think of 
them as different channels. So one port is used for web traffic, another for send­
ing email, another for receiving email, and so on. To cut down on spam-sending, 
some ISPs curtail the use of the standard port for sending mail—port 25. When 
you send mail using port 25 via these ISPs, they let your mail go to your ISP’s 
mail servers but not get sent anywhere from there. So your message never gets 
delivered to the recipient. To get around the problem, you have a couple of 
alternatives.
Try using a different port
On the Home screen, tap the Menu key and select Settings. Go to your advanced 
settings for the account, as just outlined. On the Outgoing Server listing, in the 
Port box, delete 25 and type 587.
Use Gmail’s outgoing mail server
You can use Gmail’s server to send email from another account. On the 
Outgoing Server screen, use the following settings:
• For SMTP, enter smtp.gmail.com.
• For Port, enter 465.
• For username and password, use your Gmail user name (your full Gmail 
address) and password.
• Turn on the checkboxes next to “Use secure connection” and Verify 
Certificate.
Troubleshooting the SD Card
HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SD card? There’s plenty that can go wrong, 
so try following this advice:
• First, make sure that the SD card is the right type. It has to be a microSD 
card, and can only be up to 128 GB.
• Make sure the card is mounted—that it’s showing up in Windows Explorer 
or the Finder. If it’s not mounted, the Galaxy S5 won’t recognize it, and you 
can’t access files from it or store files on it. To mount your SD card, on the 
Apps screen tap Settings→Storage, and then make sure that “Unmount SD 
card” is highlighted. If it isn’t, that’s your problem. Turn off your Galaxy S5 
and restart it. If it’s mounted and you’re still having problems, turn off both

appendix	 C
your computer and your Galaxy S5 and restart them—that should remount 
the SD card.
• Try removing the SD card and putting it back in or replacing it with a new 
one. From the Apps screen tap Settings→Storage→“Unmount SD card.” 
After several minutes, the card will be unmounted—the Galaxy S5 reports 
that you have no SD storage available.
• Next, turn off the phone’s power and remove the battery cover, as described 
earlier in this chapter. Then slide out the microSD card. (It’s located just 
above the battery. Make sure that you’re not sliding out the SIM card, which 
is more prominent.) Examine it to make sure it’s not damaged. If it’s not 
damaged, slide it back into the empty space, replace the cover, and turn on 
your Galaxy S5. That may fix the problem. If the card is damaged, put in a 
new one.
• If all else fails, try reformatting your SD card. This option erases all its data, 
so do it as a last resort. From the Apps screen tap Settings→Storage→
“Format SD card,” and then tap “Format SD card” from the screen that 
appears to confirm that’s what you want to do. After the card is formatted, 
either turn off your Galaxy S5 and turn it on again, or connect it to a PC or 
Mac via the USB connection, and after the computer recognizes the phone, 
unplug the USB cord. In both cases, the Galaxy S5 should recognize the card.
Resetting the Galaxy S5
IF ALL ELSE FAILS, you may need to reset your Galaxy S5—that is, delete all its 
data, and return it to the state it was in before you bought it, with all the factory 
settings replacing your own. Your contacts, social networking accounts, email 
and Gmail accounts, and so on all get deleted, so save this step for a last resort.
 NOTE 	 A factory data reset doesn’t delete files you have on your SD card, which means 
that your photos, videos, and any other files stored there will stay intact after the reset.
From the Apps screen select Settings→“Backup and Reset.” Make sure that the 
boxes next to “Back up my data” and “Automatic Restore” are both turned on. 
That means your settings and other application data are backed up to Google’s 
servers, and after you reset and log back in, the Galaxy S5 will automatically 
restore the data and settings. To perform a reset, tap “Factory data reset.” That 
erases all the data on your phone. (Now you see why it was so important to 
back up first.)

Warranty and Repair
THE GALAXY S5 COMES with a one-year warranty from Samsung. If you 
bought your Galaxy S5 from someone else, or someone gave it to you, the war­
ranty doesn’t transfer to you; it covers only the person who originally bought it.
The usual types of caveats apply to the warranty—if you’ve misused the phone, 
dropped it into water, and so on, the warranty gets voided.
For more details about your warranty, read the warranty guide that came with 
your phone.
Where to Go for Help
IF YOU’RE LOOKING FOR more information or help, there are plenty of places 
to go:
• Samsung’s official Samsung Galaxy S5 support. This web page has plenty 
of helpful information, tutorials, tips and tricks, and a searchable database of 
help. It’s well worth the visit. Head to www.samsung.com/us/support/ and 
search for Samsung Galaxy S5.

• Google’s Android forum. If you’ve got questions about Android, the Galaxy 
S5’s operating system, this forum might help. Keep in mind, though, that 
Samsung has customized Android for the Galaxy S5, so what you read here 
may or may not apply. Still, it’s a good place to try. Go to https://support.
google.com/android/.
• AndroidForums.com. Here’s another very useful forum where Galaxy S5 
fans congregate, which covers many Android phones. The one for Galaxy S5 
is http://androidforums.com/samsung-galaxy-s5/.
