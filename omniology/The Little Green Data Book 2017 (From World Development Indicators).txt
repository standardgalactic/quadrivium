2017 The Little Green Data Book
The Little Green Data Book 2017 is based on World Development Indicators 
2017 and its online database. Defining, gathering, and disseminating 
international statistics is a collective effort of many people and organizations. 
The indicators presented in World Development Indicators are the fruit of 
decades of work at many levels, from the field workers who administer 
censuses and household surveys to the committees and working parties 
of the national and international statistical agencies that develop the 
nomenclature, classifications, and standards fundamental to the international 
statistical system. Nongovernmental organizations have also made important 
contributions. We are indebted to the World Development Indicators partners, 
as detailed in World Development Indicators 2017.
The Little Green Data Book 2017 is the result of close collaboration between 
the staff of the Development Data Group of the Development Economics 
Vice Presidency and the Environment and Natural Resources Global Practice. 
Charlotte De Fontaubert, Mahyar Eshragh-Tabary, Laura Ivers, Esther 
Naikal, Ana Florina Pirlea, William Prince, and Jomo Tariku contributed to 
its preparation. Jomo Tariku coordinated the production of the book. Barton 
Matheson Willse & Worthington typeset the book. The work was carried out 
under the direction of Haishan Fu and Karin Kemper. Staff from The World 
Bank’s Formal Publishing Program oversaw publication and dissemination 
of the book.

Foreword
Welcome to The Little Green Data Book 2017, where we take the pulse of 
development and the environment through more than 50 indicators for all 
countries around the world. This year’s edition features the blue economy, 
and provides indicators on capture fisheries, aquaculture production, and 
marine-related areas. We chose this focus to draw attention to the economic 
importance of fisheries for sustainable development.
According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), approximately 
one in ten people worldwide rely on fisheries and aquaculture for their 
livelihoods. At the same time, close to 90 percent of global fish stocks 
are either fully fished or overfished, meaning that only 10 percent of  
these resources remain to sustain these livelihoods and a growing global 
population.

Despite their global importance, fisheries are measured and assessed on the 
basis of data that are frequently incomplete, limited, or even inaccurate. This 
impedes countries from effectively evaluating the importance of the sector 
as a path for sustainable development and hinders effective management 
of this important natural resource. A few recent initiatives have contributed 
to improving our understanding of what is really at stake. 
The Sunken Billions, a joint World Bank and FAO report issued in 2009, first 
estimated foregone revenues as a result of overfishing at $51 billion dollars 
in 2004. In 2017, using improved data, Sunken Billions Revisited provided 
an updated estimate of foregone revenues from overfishing at $88 billion 
for 2004; in 2012 it stood at $83 billion. These updated figures show that 
more than $80 billion is lost each year compared to what could be achieved 
with sustainable fisheries management. Moreover, the report found that 

vi

Foreword
fisheries reform, in the form of a global reduction in fishing by 44 percent 
would increase fish populations by a factor of 2.7, from approximately 215 
million metric tons to more than 580 million tons. In addition, even with less 
fishing taking place but with this increase in biomass, fishing would become 
much more efficient and annual harvests would actually increase by 13 
percent and the price for landed fish would rise by 24 percent. 
Another initiative informing this debate is the World Bank’s development of 
natural wealth accounts for global marine fisheries. Such accounts were 
first established in 2012 to document fisheries’ current value and estimate 
what they could be under better, more sustainable management. The picture 
painted was serious, showing that the economic performance of fisheries 
worldwide was substantially below what it could be, and that rebuilding 
fisheries could lead to an increase in global fisheries wealth, from $120 billion 
to $900 billion. An update of these numbers is now underway and will be 
included in the forthcoming publication, The Changing Wealth of Nations 2017. 
These findings translate into significant opportunities at the national level. 
For example, in the case of Mauritania, a study (Mele, 2014) of its capital 
resources found that natural capital was much higher than initially thought, 
at 44 percent of the country’s estimated total wealth. This new assessment 
drove home the importance of natural capital as an engine for economic 
growth, and showed that fisheries present a more sustainable path to 
development. At present, the fisheries sector represents more than 25 
percent of the country’s natural capital, but only 3 percent of its gross 
domestic product (GDP), highlighting an opportunity to better manage this 
renewable natural capital for food security, nutrition, and job creation. 
As these recent studies confirm, fisheries reforms, based on significant 
reduction in overfishing, stand to increase significantly the overall economic 
benefits that can be derived from fisheries. We hope that the data on fisheries 
included in this edition of The Little Green Data Book help to improve global 
understanding of how to better manage this natural resource for sustainable 
economic growth, poverty reduction, and enhanced food security.

The data in this book are for the most recent year available as noted in 
the glossary.
•  Growth rates are calculated as annual averages and represented as 
percentages.
•  Figures in italics indicate data for years or periods other than those 
specified in the glossary. 
Symbols used:
 
..  
indicates that data are not available or that aggregates cannot 
be calculated because of missing data.
 0 or 0.0  
indicates zero or small enough that the number would round 
to zero at the displayed number of decimal places.
 
$  
indicates current U.S. dollars.
Lettered notes on country tables can be found in the Notes on page 230. 
Data are shown for economies with populations greater than 30,000 or  
for smaller economies if they are members of the World Bank. The term 
country (used interchangeably with economy) does not imply political 
independence or official recognition by the World Bank but refers to any 
economy for which the authorities report separate social or economic 
statistics.
The selection of indicators in these pages includes some of those being 
used to monitor progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals. For 
more information about the seventeen goals—ending poverty, protecting 
the planet, and ensuring prosperity for all by 2030—please see the other 
books and online resources in the World Development Indicators 2017 family 
of products.

2017 The Little Green Data Book
For operational and analytical purposes the World Bank’s main criterion 
for classifying economies is gross national income (GNI) per capita. Each 
economy in The Little Data Book is classified as low income, lower middle 
income, upper middle income, or high income. Note: Classifications are fixed 
during the World Bank’s fiscal year (ending on June 30), thus countries remain 
in the categories in which they are classified irrespective of any revisions to 
their per capita income data.
Low-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $1,025 or less 
in 2015.
Lower middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita between 
$1,026 and $4,035. 
Upper middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita between 
$4,036 and $12,475.
High-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $12,476 or more.

Access to improved sanitation facilities refers to the percentage of the 
population using improved sanitation facilities. Improved sanitation facilities 
are likely to ensure hygienic separation of human excreta from human contact. 
They include flush/pour flush (to piped sewer system, septic tank, pit latrine), 
ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrine, pit latrine with slab, and composting toilet. 
(WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation; 
data are for 2015)
Access to improved water source refers to the percentage of the population 
using an improved drinking water source. An improved drinking water source 
includes piped water on premises (piped household water connection located 
inside the user’s dwelling, plot or yard), and other improved drinking water 
sources (public taps or standpipes, tube wells or boreholes, protected dug 
wells, protected springs, and rainwater collection). (WHO/UNICEF Joint 
Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation; data are for 2015)
Acute respiratory infection prevalence is the percentage of children under 
age five with acute respiratory infection in the two weeks prior to the survey. 
(ICF International; data are for the most recent year available during 2008–14)
Adjusted net national income per capita equals gross national income 
minus consumption of fixed capital, energy depletion, mineral depletion, 
and net forest depletion, divided by midyear population. (World Bank; data 
are for 2015)
Adjusted net savings equal gross savings minus consumption of fixed capital, 
plus education expenditures, minus energy depletion, mineral depletion, 
net forest depletion, and carbon dioxide and air pollution damage. (World 
Bank; data are for 2015)
Agricultural irrigated land refers to agricultural areas purposely provided with 
water, including land irrigated by controlled flooding. (Food and Agriculture 
Organization; data are for 2014)
Agricultural land is arable land, land under permanent crops, and permanent 
pastures. Arable land includes land defined by the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations as land under temporary crops (double-
cropped areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for 
pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow. 
Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded. Land under 
permanent crops is land cultivated with crops that occupy the land for long 
periods and need not be replanted after each harvest, such as cocoa, 
coffee, and rubber. This category includes land under flowering shrubs, fruit 
trees, nut trees, and vines but excludes land under trees grown for wood 
or timber. Permanent pasture is land used for five or more years for forage, 
including natural and cultivated crops. (Food and Agriculture Organization; 
data are for 2014)
Agricultural productivity is the ratio of agricultural value added, measured 
in 2010 U.S. dollars, to the number of workers in agriculture. Agricultural 
productivity is measured by value added per unit of input. Agricultural value 
added includes that from forestry and fishing. Thus interpretations of land

productivity should be made with caution. (Food and Agriculture Organization 
and World Bank; data are for 2014)
Air pollution damage is the damage due to exposure of a country’s population 
to ambient concentrations of particulates measuring less than 2.5 microns 
in diameter (PM2.5), ambient ozone pollution, and indoor concentrations of 
PM2.5 in households cooking with solid fuels.  Damages are calculated as 
foregone labor income due to premature death.  (Data on health impacts from 
pollution exposure are from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’s 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2015; data are for 2015)
Aquaculture growth is the exponential change in aquaculture fisheries 
production for the period indicated. Aquaculture is understood to mean the 
farming of aquatic organisms including fish, molluscs, crustaceans, and 
aquatic plants. Aquaculture production specifically refers to output from 
aquaculture activities, which are designated for final harvest for consumption. 
(Food and Agriculture Organization; data are for 2000–2015)
Capture fisheries growth is the exponential change in capture fisheries 
production for the period indicated. Capture fisheries production measures 
the volume of fish catches landed by a country for all commercial, industrial, 
recreational, and subsistence purposes. (Food and Agriculture Organization; 
data are for 2000–2015)
Carbon dioxide (CO2) damage, following the World Bank guidelines for the 
social cost of carbon, is estimated at $30 per tCO2e emitted in 2015 (in 
2014 U.S. dollars) times the number of tons of carbon emitted. (World Bank 
estimates; data are for 2015)
Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per capita are carbon dioxide emissions 
divided by midyear population. (Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, 
World Bank, and United Nations; data are for 2013)
Cereal yield measured as kilograms per hectare of harvested land, includes 
wheat, rice, maize, barley, oats, rye, millet, sorghum, buckwheat, and mixed 
grains. Production data on cereals relate to crops harvested for dry grain 
only. Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food, feed, or 
silage and those used for grazing are excluded. The FAO allocates production 
data to the calendar year in which the bulk of the harvest took place. Most 
of a crop harvested near the end of a year will be used in the following year. 
(Food and Agriculture Organization; data are for 2014)
Consumption of fixed capital is the replacement value of capital used up 
in the process of production. (United Nations, Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development, and the Penn World Table (Feenstra, Inklaar, 
and Timmler 2015), with missing data estimated by World Bank staff; data 
are for 2015)
Coral reef area is a country’s area of coral reefs, which are shallow marine 
habitats defined both by a physical structure (corals) and by the organisms 
found on them. (See The World Atlas of Coral Reefs (2001), UNEP-World 
Conservation Monitoring Centre)

Glossary
Deforestation is the permanent conversion of natural forest area to other uses, 
including shifting cultivation, permanent agriculture, ranching, settlements, 
and infrastructure development. Deforested areas do not include areas logged 
but intended for regeneration or areas degraded by fuel-wood gathering, 
acid precipitation, or forest fires. Negative numbers indicate an increase in 
forest areas. (Food and Agriculture Organization; data are for 2000–2015)
Diarrhea prevalence is the percentage of children under age five who had 
diarrhea in the two weeks prior to the survey. (ICF International; data are for 
the most recent year available during 2008–14)

indigenous production plus imports and stock changes, minus exports and 
fuels supplied to ships and aircraft engaged in international transport. 
(International Energy Agency; data are for 2014)
Fisheries production, total, measures the volume of aquatic species caught 
by a country for all commercial, industrial, recreational and subsistence 
purposes. The harvest from mariculture, aquaculture and other types of fish 
farming is also included. (Food and Agriculture Organization; data are for 2015)

Freshwater withdrawal, agriculture, is withdrawals for irrigation and livestock 
production as a percentage of total freshwater withdrawal. (World Resources 
Institute; data are for various years; for details see World Development 
Indicators 2017, Primary data documentation.)
Freshwater withdrawal, total, is total water withdrawal, excluding evaporation 
losses from storage basins and including water from desalination plants 
in countries where they are a significant source. Withdrawals can exceed 
100 percent of internal renewable resources because river flows from other 
countries are not included, because extraction from nonrenewable aquifers 
or desalination plants is considerable, or because there is significant water 
reuse. (Food and Agriculture Organization and World Resources Institute; 
data are for various years; for details see World Development Indicators 
2017, Sources and methods.)
GDP is gross domestic product and measures the total output of goods 
and services for final use occurring within the domestic territory of a given 
country, regardless of the allocation to domestic and foreign claims. GDP 
at purchaser values (market prices) is the sum of gross value added by all 
resident and nonresident producers in the economy plus any taxes and 
minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated 
without deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and 
degradation of natural resources. (World Bank, Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development, and United Nations; data are for 2015)
GNI is gross domestic product plus net receipts of primary income (employee 
compensation and property income) from abroad. GNI per capita is in 
current U.S. dollars, converted using the World Bank Atlas method (see 
World Development Indicators 2017, Sources and methods). (World Bank, 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and United 
Nations; data are for 2015)
GNI per capita is gross national income (GNI) divided by midyear population.
Gross savings are calculated as gross national income less total consumption, 
plus net transfers. (World Bank and Organization for Economic Co-operation 
and Development; data are for 2015)
Internal freshwater resources per capita are internal renewable resources, 
which include flows of rivers and groundwater from rainfall in the country 
but excludes river flows from other countries, divided by midyear population. 
(Refers to data reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization as of 2014)
Land area is a country’s total land area, excluding area under inland water 
bodies, national claims to continental shelf, and exclusive economic zones. 
In most cases the definition of inland water bodies includes major rivers and 
lakes. (Food and Agriculture Organization; data are for 2015)
Mangroves area is a country’s total area of mangroves, which are plants 
of a variety of different species, including trees, shrubs, palms, and ferns, 
that grow in the tropics and subtropics in saline inter-tidal coastal habitats,

Marine protected areas are areas of intertidal or subtidal terrain—and 
overlying water and associated flora and fauna and historical and cultural 
features—that have been reserved by law or other effective means to protect 
part or all of the enclosed environment.  (United Nations Environmental 
Program and the World Conservation Monitoring Centre, as compiled by the 
World Resources Institute; data are for 2014)  
Mineral depletion is the ratio of the value of the stock of mineral resources 
to the remaining reserve lifetime. It covers bauxite, copper, iron, lead, nickel, 
phosphate, tin, gold, silver, and zinc. (See World Bank 2011 for details; 
data are for 2015)
Net forest depletion is the product of unit resource rents and the excess 
of round-wood harvest over natural growth. If growth exceeds harvest, this 
figure is zero. (Food and Agriculture Organization and World Bank estimates 
of natural growth; data are for 2015)
PM2.5 exposure (% pop. exceeding WHO guideline level) is the portion of 
a country’s population living in places where mean annual concentrations 
of PM2.5 are greater than 10 micrograms per cubic meter, the guideline 
value recommended by the World Health Organization as the lower end of 
the range of concentrations over which adverse health effects due to PM2.5 
exposure have been observed.  (For data sources, see van Donkelaar et al 
(2016), GBD 2015 (2016), and Shaddick et al (2016); data are for 2015)
PM2.5 pollution, mean annual exposure, is the average level of exposure of 
a nation’s population to concentrations of suspended particulates measuring 
less than 2.5 microns in diameter, which are capable of penetrating deep 
into the respiratory tract and causing severe health damage. Exposure is 
calculated by weighting mean annual concentrations of PM2.5 by population 
in both urban and rural areas.  (For data sources, see van Donkelaar et al 
(2016), GBD 2015 (2016), and Shaddick et al (2016); data are for 2015)
Population is the midyear estimate of all residents regardless of legal status 
citizenship, except for refugees not permanently settled in the country of 
asylum who are generally considered part of the population of their country 
of origin. (United Nations Population Division, national statistical offices,
