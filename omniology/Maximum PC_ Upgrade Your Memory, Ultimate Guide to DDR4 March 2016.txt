editorial
a thing or two about a thing or two
There was a Time when RAM was 
expensive. I remember going out to buy 
32MB—yes, megabytes—of EDO DRAM 
for almost $400. They don’t even make 
USB thumb drives that small any more. 
I think my analog wristwatch has more 
memory than that.
RAM 
upgrades 
are 
the 
easiest 
improvements you can make to a PC 
to eke out some extra performance, 
especially if you tend to run a lot of 
programs 
simultaneously. 
If 
you’re 
primarily gaming and nothing else, 16GB 
is likely enough, but I think the sweet 
spot is going to be 32GB sooner than we 
expect. For me, I have web browsers 
open with a gazillion tabs, email, IM 
programs for work and personal use, 
music, and a VNC remote desktop client. 
I still don’t come close to utilizing 32GB 
of RAM but since I actually have 64GB, I 
never have to think about it. Moral of the 
story? Get enough RAM so that you don’t 
ever have to worry about needing more.
The first thing you should absolutely 
do after a RAM upgrade is make sure to 
enable XMP mode in your BIOS, to get 
full performance out of your system. 
Without XMP enabled, your RAM will run 
at the default clocks associated with your 
CPU and platform. You’ll want to test and 
see what works best. You’re probably 
wondering what I’m using. Corsair 
Dominator Platinum 2800s—four DIMMs, 
16GB each. Ooh, yeah.
After upgrading your rig with copious 
amounts of RAM, you’re bound to want to 
make sure the rest of your system is in 
tip-top shape.
Fortunately, there are plenty of 
options if you’re running Windows 10. 
When it was released, Microsoft said that 
Windows 10 would be the best Windows 
to date. For the most part, this is true. 
But there are areas of concern.
First and foremost, if you’re a privacy 
nut, you’ll want to go into Windows 
10’s cloud settings and disable a heap 
of options that constantly keep your 
PC dialing back to the mother ship. 
What you search for, how you use your 
programs, error logs, and so on, are all 
logged and sent to Microsoft to give you a 
“better” experience.
On the flip side, all these things 
actually do assist Microsoft in improving 
Windows 10. These features are also 
core to Windows 10’s responsiveness 
when you’re searching for information. 
Lots of people want their PCs to be 
connected to cloud services that make 
the most use of their Internet connection, 
so that things can be accessed quickly, 
but for privacy’s sake, it’s always a give 
and take. Aside from these, there are 
lots of other areas in Windows 10 that 
will yield performance improvements if 
addressed. We show you how.
Circling 
back, 
does 
anyone 
remember what EDO DRAM is? If you do, 
congratulations on being old. If you don’t, 
you need a bit of schooling. Take our geek 
quiz and be admitted with honors into our 
elite society.

Legitimate use? Or are they exploiting a legal loophole? 
Zero-Rated Services 
Test Net Neutrality
can binge until their eyeballs 
bulge out, and none of it will 
count against their data caps.
But wait, isn’t throttling 
prohibited by the FCC? This 
is where things get tricky. 
In an email to DSL Reports, 
a 
T-Mobile 
representative 
argued it’s “misleading” to use 
the term “throttling,” and that 
a better descriptor is “mobile 
optimized.” The explanation 
boils 
down 
to 
semantics, 
though 
more 
importantly, 
T-Mobile isn’t selling faster 
access to services; there are 
no paid fast lanes. Instead, any 
streaming service that meets a 
set of technical requirements 
can participate in Binge On.
These types of services have 
drawn the attention of the FCC, 
which at the moment is taking 
a wait-and-see approach to the 
situation. FCC chairman Tom 
Wheeler even went so far as 
to praise Binge On when asked 
about it during an open meeting.
“I think that it’s clear in the 
Open Internet Order that we 
said we are pro-competition 
and pro-innovation. Clearly, this 
meets both of those criteria; 
it’s highly innovative and highly 
competitive,” Wheeler said.
As 
far 
as 
Wheeler 
is 
concerned, programs like Binge 
On are proof that fears of the 
FCC thwarting innovation with 
its reclassification of broadband 
as a utility are unfounded. At 
the same time, Wheeler said 
the FCC is “keeping an eye on” 
Binge On and other similar 
services, which will be judged 
on a case-by-case basis.
The FCC has sent letters to 
T-Mobile, AT&T, and Comcast, 
asking for details of their free 
data programs. Wheeler insists 
the intent of the letters is 
merely to stay informed, though 
depending on how things go, the 
FCC could decide to launch an 
investigation at any time.
One of the arguments against 
zero-rated services is that it 
forces smaller companies to 
follow suit and spend more than 
they can afford on advertising 
their offering. An arguably 
bigger fear is that zero-rated 
services give providers power 
to pick winners and losers in the 
online content wars. 
It all boils down to a giant 
gray area—one which the FCC 
is content to let play out so long 
as service providers don’t take 
things too far. –PL
As Any PArent knows, children 
make it their mission to test the 
rules to see exactly how much 
(or little) they can get away 
with, as the line drawn in the 
sand can sometimes be moved 
just a smidge. The Federal 
Communication Commission 
finds itself in a similar position 
after laying down the net 
neutrality law with its Open 
Internet Order, a set of rules 
designed to ensure that all 
data on the Internet is treated 
equally. As expected, service 
providers have begun testing 
the limits of the FCC’s rules.
T-Mobile is leading the 
charge with its Binge On 
program. Binge On is one of a 
growing number of so-called 
“zero-rated” services, which 
are services that don’t count 
against a user’s data cap. 
Through Binge On, T-Mobile 
allows customers on qualifying 
plans to stream unlimited 
video from a list of two dozen 
partners, including Netflix, 
Hulu, and HBO Go. T-Mobile 
throttles the streaming video 
to 480p, and in exchange for 
the lower quality video feeds, 
customers on qualifying plans 
The FCC is taking a wait-and-see approach to zero-rated services such as  T-Mobile’s Binge On program.
Isn’t throttling prohibited 
by the FCC? This is where 
things get tricky.

Over the hOlidays, children’s electronic 
and educational toy manufacturer VTech 
Holdings Limited confirmed that hackers 
accessed its Learning Lodge app store 
database on November 14, exposing the 
details of over 11 million parents and 
children. Learning Lodge allows customers 
to download apps, games, e-books, and 
other educational products to VTech devices.
“Our 
customer 
database 
contains 
general user profile information including 
name, email address, encrypted password, 
secret question and answer for password 
retrieval, IP address, mailing address, and 
download history,” the company stated.
VTech stressed that the database does 
not contain credit card information, nor does 
the Learning Lodge website. This data is 
provided on a secure, third-party payment 
gateway during the check-out process. 
VTech also does not store social security 
numbers, driver license numbers, or any 
other ID card number.
The breach was first noted by a Canadian 
journalist who asked about the incident 
on November 23. The company conducted 
an internal investigation and discovered 
“irregular activity” taking place on the 
Learning Lodge website on November 14, 
but didn’t alert the public until November 27.
Recent reports have revealed that the 
hacker not only gained access to email 
addresses and physical addresses, but 
images of parents and children taken with 
VTech products, chat logs, and audio files. 
The company has acknowledged these 
reports but said that while the investigation 
is ongoing, it cannot confirm them.
The company says that audio files are 
encrypted by AES128 whereas chat logs are 
not encrypted. Chat logs are also only stored 
temporarily on the server if they are marked 
undelivered, and they expire in 30 days. 
Profiles of children that were exposed 
include name, gender, and birth date. –KP
htC CeO Cher Wang, speaking in December at the Vive Unbound developers 
forum in Beijing, said that HTC and Valve Software had made “a very, very big 
technological breakthrough.”
According to Wang, this breakthrough is significant enough that HTC and 
Valve Software have decided to set aside the Vive VR headset that they had 
originally planned to release in Q4 2015, and hold off until an improved model 
is ready, which is currently slated for April 2016. “We shouldn’t make our users 
swap their systems later just so we could meet the December shipping date,” 
Wang said.
The CEO wouldn’t go into any sort of detail regarding the breakthrough itself, 
but promised more news would be released about the improved Vive headset 
during CES 2016. –KP

MQA’s Audio Origami Will 
Fold Up High-Res Audio
We went from a steady raising of the audio quality 
bar to a massive drop when we shifted from using 
physical media to just storing the ones and zeroes 
on a hard drive. Compressing audio to the 256kb/s 
level of iTunes’ AAC files, and the 320kb/s MP3 level 
of Spotify, means cutting out a huge amount—up to 
90 percent—of the original sound. That does bad 
things for a track’s clarity but makes it convenient 
when it comes to accessing a huge library of tracks 
on something you can fit in your pocket.
Things are slowly changing, with the likes of Tidal 
offering CD-quality streams —16-bit, 44.1kHz FLAC 
files streaming at 1,411kb/s—thanks to the increased 
bandwidth available in the home and when mobile.
But that’s just taking us back to the quality we had 
with CDs. How do we push further without resorting 
to high-res FLAC albums that take up 1.5GB? 
Master Quality Authenticated (MQA) may be a 
mouthful, but it’s the future of high-res audio (HRA). 
The first thing to get to grips with, though, is what 
we mean by “resolution” when talking about sound.
When we’re referring to what we can see, it’s 
easy. Resolution is the number of distinct pixels on 
a screen. Simple. But it’s that “distinct” bit that’s 
important—in audio terms, resolution is all about 
Something happened when we went fully digital with our music. 
Something massively convenient but pretty awful on the ears. MP3s 
are certainly easy to carry around and delightfully lightweight to 
stream, but quality audio they ain’t. MQA, however, is bringing the 
holy grail of studio master quality to streaming.
being able to resolve different 
sounds in a file. When a track is 
compressed, it becomes “lossy.” It 
loses some of the distinct sounds, 
as they have to be crushed together 
to be able to form a smaller file size.
A 192kHz, 24-bit lossless file 
sounds stunning, but is huge 
and 
impractical 
for 
streaming 
purposes. That’s where MQA comes 
in. Its Audio Origami folds up audio 
files to a manageable size, retaining 
all the information, and allows them 
to be unpacked at the other end with 
all the audio data intact.
That’s where the name comes 
from—it takes studio master quality 
audio in at the start of the pipeline 
and you can be sure that it will sound 
exactly the same at the other end. 
Which is awesome for audiophiles, 
but is just as good for everyone else, 
because even without a hardware or 
software MQA decoder at the final 
stage, the file unpacks to whatever 
size the player can cope with. It will 
always be better than CD quality, 
and therefore high-res audio.
That’s huge news for streaming 
companies, and Tidal has committed 
to having MQA streams in 2016. It 
works for Tidal because it needs 
to store a huge number of files for 
each track in its library because of 
the different bitrates it streams at. 
Dave James has been  
building and writing about 
PCs and their components  
for the last two decades.  
Tidal currently has 1.4 petabytes of 
audio, much of it duplicated because 
of all those different formats.
With MQA able to dynamically 
unfold to whichever size is needed, 
it won’t demand so much storage, 
saving Tidal a huge amount of cash 
as well as meaning it can offer HRA 
streaming for the first time. And all 
with files not much bigger than its 
current top-tier audio stream.
The first MQA devices, such as 
Pioneer’s new XDP-100R portable 
HRA player, are now arriving, and 
with Tidal kickstarting the high-res 
streaming revolution this year, 2016 
could well be when high-resolution 
audio just becomes audio. Trust me, 
hearing is believing.
Audio Origami folds up files to 
a manageable size, and allows 
them to be unpacked with all 
the audio data intact.
The aim of MQA is the convergence 
of convenience and quality.

The thing is, SteamOS, and Steam Machines in 
particular, have their problems. Valve set out with 
a grand ambition for Steam Machines, and it had the 
user base to back it up. Imagine building a PC just 
for gaming, having access to your Steam library, 
without having to pay the Windows tax. Great idea, 
except for one fatal flaw.
The number of titles available to Linux and 
SteamOS users is still small compared to the 
Windows library. At time of writing, there are 3,389 
games available to SteamOS and Linux. But when 
you consider that 15,288 games are available to 
Windows users, things begin to look a little bleak. 
That’s only 22.1 percent of Steam games that are 
available to Linux. Hell, Mac OS X even enjoys a 
bigger library at 5,602 titles (or 36.6 percent).
That poses a big problem for makers of Steam 
Machines. How are you supposed to market a box 
that can only play a fraction of the Steam library? 
I mean, I like the form factors that Alienware and 
Syber have been putting out there, but selling them 
as SteamOS (as opposed to Windows/Steam big-
picture mode) boxes might be tough, given the small 
numbers of games currently available on Linux.
That said, there has been a steep increase in the 
number of Steam games available to Linux. Steam hit 
the 1,500-game mark for Linux just last September. 
That number more than doubled in about three 
months. Given that growth, it’s possible that gamers 
on SteamOS could see a rapid inflation in game 
offerings. The other thing SteamOS 
has to do is get killer apps such as 
Netflix, Twitch, and Hulu on board. 
Without content providers, it’s hard 
to compete with the PS4, Xbox 360, 
or even the Wii. (My PS3’s primary 
role is that of Netflix machine.) 
In a perfect world, the Debian-
based SteamOS should be at or 
near parity with Windows offerings. 
That’s not likely to happen, because 
of DirectX. Asking game devs to 
port to OpenGL for the sake of Linux 
users is a really tall order.
There is one way gamers have 
been able to get DirectX games to 
run in Linux, and it’s called WINE. 
WINE isn’t perfect. It isn’t sexy 
(though the PlayOnLinux wrapper 
makes it a bit sexier). Compatibility 
can be really hit-or-miss. But when 
things work, WINE is a godsend.
Experimental DirectX 11 support 
appeared in WINE in the summer of 
Alex Campbell is a Linux geek 
who enjoys learning about 
computer security.
2015 (in version 1.7.50). Sure, native 
support for Linux will always yield 
the best compatibility and stability, 
but WINE may offer Steam machines 
a way around DirectX exclusion. If 
Valve hired a few developers who 
would dedicate their existence to 
getting DirectX 11 (and 12) support 
to be the best it can be in WINE, a 
world of Windows games could be 
opened to Linux and SteamOS.
Using things such as PlayOnLinux 
as a guide, Steam could create a 
WINE wrapper for its Windows 
offerings. Sure, WINE isn’t the best 
way to do things, but it’s better than 
being cut out of the AAA ecosystem 
entirely. The pay-off could be really 
big for both Valve and Linux gamers 
if the resources go into it.
 
There are 3,389 games available 
to SteamOS and Linux, but 
15,288 available to Windows 
users—things look bleak.

OPEN SOURCE
SteamOS’s Low 
Boiler Pressure
When I fIrst heard about the idea of Linux-based Steam Machines, 
I was excited. I thought to myself: “Hey, game developers finally care 
about Linux. This will be great for Linux, for gamers, and for the open-
source community.” I still want that to be true.
SteamOS games haven’t built up the pressure to get the platform moving.

Unless you live under a rock, you’ll have noticed the rise of the gamer’s gem of technological 
advancement, the Oculus Rift—and, more importantly, the rebirth of virtual reality. Couple 
that with Microsoft’s advances in augmented reality, and the next decade may see monitors 
begin to change irrevocably. We sat down for a chat with Oculus VR’s founder about his 
thoughts on the future of Oculus Rift, VR, and virtual media as a whole. 
Palmer Luckey Discusses 
the Future of VR
We ask the man behind the Oculus Rift whether 
the monitor screen as we know it is doomed
maximum PC: We’re 
here with Oculus VR’s founder, 
Palmer Luckey. Palmer, we have 
some questions for you, if you 
don’t mind.
Palmer Luckey: Fire 
away!
mPC: For those who haven’t 
been following the VR scene, 
what is the status of VR right 
now, and what do you expect to 
happen in the next year?
PL: Right now, the status of 
virtual reality is that we’ve 
seen several years of kind of a 
consumer-free market—we’ve 
seen a lot of developers, we’ve 
seen a lot of enthusiasts getting 
interested, and we’ve seen a lot 
of content in development, but 
we haven’t really seen any major 
consumer launches in the virtual 
reality space. And with people 
like Oculus, and Sony, and HTC 
all entering the space at around 
the same time, over the next 
year we’re going to see a huge 
explosion in the number of 
people who have had exposure 
to VR, and a huge explosion  
in the number of virtual  
reality games that are being 
published publicly. 
mPC: This isn’t the first time 
that VR has made an attempt 
to go mainstream, so what’s 
different this time around?
PL: There’s kinda two sides. 
One is the side we control. It’s 
things like displays, optics, 
and motion sensors. Those 
weren’t nearly as good in the 
past—it’s really only in the 
last few years that it’s become 
viable to build a good virtual 
reality headset. But more 
than that, it’s the proliferation 
of high-end computers for 
everybody. If you look back to 
the ’80s and ’90s, when virtual 
reality was kinda having its 
first serious run at mainstream 
penetration, the best VR 
experiences were running 
on, like, SGI workstations 
that cost tens of thousands of 
dollars, or even hundreds of 
thousands of dollars. But now 
everyone’s computer is capable 
of rendering high frame rate 3D 
graphics—maybe not photo-
realistic ones, maybe not to the 
level of quality that we want from 
virtual reality in the near and 
distant future, but it’s enough 
to make it work. And so, for the 
first time ever, virtual reality is 
actually viable as something you 
can use at home. If you look back 
to the ’80s and ’90s again, those 
companies didn’t fail because of 
bad business or bad marketing, 
or because consumers thought it 
was weird—it’s because people 
Could VR change 
the media 
landscape for 
ever? Palmer 
reveals all in 
this exclusive 
interview.

Ahh, the beauty 
that is VR in 
its glorious 
original form. 
didn’t have machines that  
could render an experience 
that was anything close to 
comfortable or compelling,  
and that’s all changed.
mPC: So you think it’s more of 
a timing issue, then? 
PL: It’s almost entirely a 
timing issue. It would have been 
impossible to start Oculus in 
even the mid-2000s. It wasn’t 
until between 2007 and 2009  
that the technology was 
becoming viable enough to  
build something on the level  
of the development kits that 
we’ve shipped so far.
mPC: Do you envision VR going 
mainstream? And what about 
flatscreen displays? Will they 
disappear, too? 
PL: Eventually, but it’s all a 
matter of time. Traditional 
displays going away isn’t so 
much a VR problem as an AR 
problem, because people are 
always going to want to place 
displays into the real world, 
or at least into something 
approximating the real world. 
But you’re going to see the 
convergence of AR and VR 
technologies into the same sets 
of headsets eventually. It’ll be 
something you wear all the time, 
or at least that you carry around 
all of the time. And the render 
horsepower is going to be on 
the headset, or in your pocket, 
not tied to a big desktop PC. 
As far as going mainstream? 
Again, it’s just a matter of 
time, a matter of having a good 
enough experience, with enough 
content, at a low enough cost. 
Right now, the math is a little 
wonky—it’s pretty expensive 
to get into virtual reality, and 
there’s not a lot of content 
relative to other forms of media, 
like film, music, books, even 
traditional games. And the 
quality of the experience, while 
acceptable, isn’t something 
that’s going to make everybody 
truly feel like they’ve been 
teleported into a new place. We 
can reliably induce a sense of 
presence, a sense of making 
someone feel like they’re in a 
virtual environment to their 
lizard brain. But tricking the 
conscious mind into ignoring the 
flaws is difficult. As the quality 
goes up, and as the amount of 
content goes up, and the breadth 
of content goes up, so that you 
know there’s something for 
everybody, that there’s television 
shows for all different audiences 
today, not just narrow slices of 
people, you’re going to see more 
and more people get interested 
in virtual reality, because the 
quality is going to be very high, 
and there’s going to be things 
they’re interested in playing. And 
then the only factor left is cost. 
Right now, if you need to have 
a fairly high-end PC, and then 
buy a VR headset, you’re kind of 
limited to a smaller audience. If 
you look into the distant future, 
where everything is going to 
be rendered on the headset, 
and we’ll be able to get mobile 
systems on a chip to render 
really incredible graphics, now 
you have something that is like 
mobile phones. It started out 
at many hundreds of dollars, 
and it dropped to sub-$100 
unsubsidized. Something that 
many people around the world 
can afford to use, and that’s 
when virtual reality will become 
truly mainstream. 
mPC: Do you think this is 
something that’s just going to be 
a really cool niche product?
PL: Virtual reality will be a 
niche product for at least some 
time. If you look at the Palm 
Pilot, it’s a good example. The 
Palm Pilot was very well known, 
it was very influential, but it 
wasn’t something that everybody 
wanted to use and that everyone 
could justify. They sold millions 
of units, and a lot of people 
recognize the Palm Pilot, and 
they built a great brand, but you 
could say that the Palm Pilot was 
a niche product. It was techies, 
business people, people who 
wanted this portable computer 
that could keep track of their 
calendar, their applications, 
their emails on the go, but 
eventually the technology got 
good enough, and the cost came 
down enough, that we had things 
like the iPhone that really took 
off, and everyone could justify 
having this type of technology 
in their lives. I think virtual 
reality is going to be on the same 
continuum. It can be successful 
as a niche product, it doesn’t 
have to be mainstream and 
appeal to everyone in the entire 
world in order to be successful, 
but that is the eventual end 
goal. It’s to build something that 
everybody will have a use for, 
and I think that virtual reality 
will inevitably have a use for 
everyone, because anything you 
can imagine doing in real life, 
you can do eventually as well or 
better in virtual reality. Without 
physical laws governing what 
you can do, without monetary 
and fiscal laws dictating what 
you can do. Experiences that are 
limited to a very elite few right 
now could become available to 
everybody, and whether it’s just 
for entertainment, like traveling 
to Hawaii, or education, being 
able to travel to different places, 
experience different things, 
potentially even experience 
things as they used to be in the 
past, we can’t do that with any 
other technology. And if we look 
at human history, whether it’s 
epics of old, music, or movies, 
even modern video games, 
it’s all a reflection of people’s 
desires to see and do incredible 
things, things that are outside of 
their ordinary existence. Virtual 
reality is the ultimate conclusion 
of that in my opinion—it’s likely 
to be the final form of media. 
It’s hard to come up with a form 
of media that goes beyond 
something that can not only be 
its own set of media, but also 
replicate every other form of 
media that’s ever existed.

THIS MONTH THE DOCTOR TACKLES...

Folding @ Top Speed
Hey Doc. I have a PC that I threw 
together with some spare parts 
I had lying around. It’s not much, 
but I only use it as a dedicated 
Folding@home and distributed 
compile machine. The system 
sports an Intel Pentium G3258 
in a Mini-ITX form factor, with 
4GB of RAM, and a 450W PSU. 
For now, I’m only using Intel 
integrated graphics, but I’m 
thinking about adding a discrete 
GPU to accelerate folding 
performance. What should I 
use, though? 
I’ve heard that, for a lot of 
non-gaming GPU-accelerated 
compute tasks, AMD’s 
architecture performs better. 
However, I’m personally partial 
to Nvidia. So, which is better for 
folding performance: an AMD 
Radeon R7/R9-based board or 
a GeForce GTX? And if I do go 
with Nvidia, would I see much 
advantage from a low-level 
Quadro card over the desktop-
oriented GeForce? Thanks! 
 
–Dan Egli
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: 
Are you looking for the 
best performance, price be 
damned? The best PPD (points 
per day) per unit of power 
consumption? Or the best PPD 
per dollar? According to the 
official Folding@home forum, 
Nvidia’s GeForce GTX Titan X 
is commonly considered your 
fastest option. Meanwhile, the 
GeForce GTX 970 gets props 
time and time again for its PPD/
watt ratio.
Don’t worry about spending 
extra money on a workstation-
class graphics card, either. 
The Folding client doesn’t 
benefit from the optimized 
drivers you get with a Quadro 
board. Those are typically 
tuned for professional CAD 
and engineering applications. 
Similarly, it gets nothing from 
the double-precision floating-
point math or ECC algorithms 
enabled on compute-oriented 
cards, such as Nvidia’s Tesla 
and AMD’s FirePro. 
Battling Bad Behavior 
Hi Doctor, I recently updated 
my Windows 8.1 system to 
Windows 10. It ran for a couple 
of weeks, but then started to 
exhibit display corruption, slow 
browser refreshes, desktop 
color craziness (all text and 
backgrounds turn clear so 
you cannot read any of the 
menus), and eventually I have 
to reboot. It’s good for another 
few minutes after that. Most of 
my issues manifest while I’m 
browsing the web, but can crop 
up at any time.
The system board is an Asus 
P7P55D-E with a Core i7-860, 
and 12GB of RAM; I have a 
Radeon HD 5700-series video 
card plugged in, too. AMD does 
not have any drivers newer 
than the ones I’m running 
(15.201.1151.0).
Do you think that, due to the 
relative age of the video card 
(it’s around three years old 
now), it’s time to buy a newer 
one that might coexist better 
with Windows 10? I didn’t have 
any issues with Windows 7 
or Windows 8.1, and never 
overclocked. If you recommend 
a new board, what would be a 
reasonable choice? I don’t do 
much gaming, but do appreciate 
a peppy system. 
I have tried uninstalling 
the current video drivers, 
rebooting, and letting Windows 
discover the card on its own. 
That works for a little while, 
after which I’m battling the 
same issues. Do you have 
any advice for a long-time 
Maximum PC reader?
–David Knapp
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: The 
troubleshooting process 
is fraught with frustration 
and hard-fought victories. 
In this case, the fact that 
you can recover stability 
and then quickly lose it once 
again suggests you could 
have a component that might 
be cooling down and then 
overheating. Have you popped 
the side off your chassis to 
check that all is well with the 
Radeon’s cooling fan? How 
about using GPU-Z to monitor 
the temperature of AMD’s 
Juniper processor? 
If everything checks out 
on the hardware side, try 
starting over with a fresh 
driver install. Use DDU (www.
wagnardmobile.com/DDU/) to 
clean out any remnants of older 
Catalyst versions, and then 
grab the 15.11.1 Beta (http://
amd.com/beta), which is a little 
newer than what you were 
using before.
At the end of the day, 
though, that graphics card is 
getting old, and AMD won’t

be supporting it with driver 
updates moving forward 
(the latest Radeon Software 
Crimson Edition build only 
goes as far back as Radeon HD 
7700+ support)—so you might 
want to start thinking about 
an upgrade.
Set the Record Straight
Doc, I plan to build myself a new 
PC but before I do, please could 
you clarify M.2 support, as found 
in my Asus X99-E WS/USB 3.1 
user manual?
“This motherboard features 
the M.2 slot, which shares 
bandwidth with PCI Express 
3.0 x4 slot to speed up data 
transfer up to 32Gb/s. This helps 
enhance the performance of 
your SSD… that is dedicated only 
to the operating system.”
My questions are:
•  Is M.2 only useful when the 
operating system is installed on 
to one dedicated SSD?
•  Is there any benefit to utilizing 
M.2 when the OS is installed 
on a RAID 10 array (across four 
128GB Samsung 840 Pro SSDs)?
•  I read online that enthusiasts 
install their OS (with a lot of 
hassle) directly on to the M.2-
based drive. Does this offer the 
best performance compared to 
my alternative method?
Thank you very much for any 
help you can give.
–Jerry Franco, Jr.
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: The 
maximum throughput of a 
modern SATA port is 6Gb/s, 
whereas a four-lane M.2 
slot is theoretically capable 
of up to 32Gb/s. The fastest 
SATA-attached drives can push 
sequential transfers just over 
500MB/s. Meanwhile, Samsung 
rates its 256GB and 512GB 
SM951-NVMe SSDs in excess 
of 2GB/s (both of these are 
M.2 drives). 
To answer your first 
question, no, M.2 attached to 
the PCIe bus isn’t only useful 
when it’s hosting the operating 
system. However, many of 
your OS’s operations are 
small and random in nature. 
That’s exactly where a drive 
such as Samsung’s SM951 
excels. The NVMe interface 
is optimized for low latency, 
which translates to increased 
system responsiveness.
The best M.2 drives are 
faster than a striped set of 
mirrored SATA SSDs. What 
you lose, of course, is the 
redundancy of those mirrors. 
If this were the Doc’s new PC, 
he’d drop a 256GB drive into the 
M.2 slot for Windows and his 
most performance-sensitive 
apps. Then, he’d repurpose 
the 840 Pros, perhaps leaving 
them in RAID 10 to store user 
data requiring some degree of 
protection. There’s even room 
for a third tier of mechanical 
disks, should you need 
additional capacity. 
Eating Up Bandwidth
Dear Doctor, I am currently 
working overseas in an area that 
shares its Internet connection 
with a large number of people. 
They restrict access in order 
to prevent the connection from 
becoming severely bogged 
down. We’re allowed unlimited 
web browsing and email, and 
time-limited video chat.
Being away from my family 
is bad enough, but no online 
gaming is just cruel. I like to 
play Battlefield 4, Star Wars 
Battlefront, and WoW. From 
what I hear, though, online 
gaming consumes minimal 
bandwidth compared to other 
online activities. Is there a good 
reference for making such a 
comparison? Please help.
–Brian Eyestone
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: The Doc 
doesn’t have any benchmark 
data of his own to share with 
you, Brian. However, he does 
know that games utilize your 
Internet connection in different 
ways, and every title will chew 
up a different quantity of data 
per hour. 
If you were to believe Cable 
One’s web usage calculator 
(www.cableone.net/Docs/
datacalculator.html), though, 
streaming music is more than 
twice as intensive as heavy 
gaming, and video streaming 
uses more than 50 times as 
much bandwidth. Most folks 
would probably be inclined to 
overestimate the bandwidth 
requirements of online gaming. 
Almost certainly, downloading 
the games themselves and 
keeping them up to date 
through patches would tax the 
connection more than a few 
hours of play time.
PSU Compatibility
Greetings Doctor, A while 
back, I bought a PSU for my 
sister’s desktop. The stock unit 
died and I didn’t pay enough 
attention when I picked out the 
replacement; it turned out to 
be an SFX form factor-based 
supply, rather than ATX. Do I 
simply need an adapter bracket, 
or is this specific PSU useless 
in her machine? Thank you 
for reading.  
–Blake
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: Many 
SFX-based power supplies 
include adapter brackets for 
applications just like this one. 
If yours didn’t, then yes, that 
should be all you need to get the 
PSU installed. Check with the 
manufacturer to see if it offers 
a bracket. They’re available on 
eBay as well.
Monitor Match
Doctor, I have a gaming rig and 
I’m looking for a 4K monitor, but 
I’m not sure which one to pick. 
Right now, I’m torn between the 
Asus PG279Q and Asus PG27AQ 
(or the Acer counterparts I’ve 
been reading about). Both 
employ IPS panels and support 
G-Sync. The PG279Q has a 
resolution of 2560x1440 and 
a refresh rate of 144Hz. The 
PG27AQ has a resolution of 
3840x2160, but a refresh rate 
of only 60Hz.
My current system has 
a Core i7-3820 on an Asus 
Sabertooth X79, with 32GB of 
Corsair Vengeance DDR3 RAM, 
an Nvidia GeForce GTX 980, and 
an Asus VG236H 1080p monitor 
with a refresh rate of 120Hz.
First off, do I have enough 
under the hood to run both or 
either of these 4K monitors 
in a gaming situation? I play 
everything from first-person 
shooters to MMOs. What 
effect will the different refresh 
rates have on the experience? 
And finally, if I upgrade to 
the monitor with the lower 
resolution, will I notice much 
of a difference (graphically) 
compared to my current 1080p 
monitor? I’d appreciate any 
advice or suggestions you 
can give.  
–Marc Rush
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: When 
somebody makes reference to a 
4K monitor, they’re specifically 
talking about a screen with 
a resolution of 3840x2160. 
As of right now, there are 
actually no 4K panels capable 
of 120Hz refresh rates—that 
combination will require the 
bandwidth of DisplayPort 1.3 
(together with a sufficiently fast 
graphics subsystem).
That being the case, what 
you are really asking here is 
whether you should go with 
a 27-inch G-Sync-capable 
display with a native resolution 
of 2560x1440 and a maximum 
refresh rate of 165Hz, or a 
27-inch G-Sync-capable display 
with a native resolution of 
3840x2160 and a maximum 
refresh rate of 60Hz.
The Doc loves 4K and would 
wholeheartedly recommend 
it for immersive gaming. 
However, you would need 
another GeForce GTX 980 in 
SLI to get fast enough frame 
rates at 3840x2160. Quad 
HD—used to describe a native 
2560x1440 resolution—is a 
much more appropriate pairing 
for your GM204 graphics 
processor. Adding Nvidia’s 
G-Sync technology means that 
the rate at which your GPU 
outputs individual frames is 
matched by the panel, creating 
a fluidity that you will absolutely 
notice. Therefore, the PG279Q 
is a better match for your 
current configuration. 
To use Be Quiet!’s SFX Power 2 
with a full-sized ATX chassis, 
you need an adapter (which Be 
Quiet! doesn’t include).

let’s face it, MeMory isn’t the sexiest 
component in your computer. It’s not a 
beautiful polygon-rendering graphics card 
from the metallurgic factories of AMD or 
Nvidia. It’s not a gigahertz-crunching, hair-
tingling, multithreaded CPU. Nor is it a 
speed-freak of a PCIe SSD solution—M.2 or 
otherwise. It’s memory. RAM. And if we're 
honest, while it’s without doubt one of the 
most important cornerstones currently 
fixed within every PC system on the planet, 
it’s simply not that exciting, nor particularly 
easy to understand—beyond the concept of 
capacity, of course. 
That said, the questions we are asked 
here in the Maximum PC office most often 
tend to revolve around that volatile yet 
thought-provoking component. “How much 
RAM do I need?” and “What’s the best 
upgrade for me?” Well, that’s what we’re 
here to find out. 
RAM is by far the most over-hyped, 
confusing thing to get your head around 
when it comes to PC components. If you 
didn't know any better, marketing teams 
across the globe would have you believe 
that higher frequency memory is what you 
need. Similar to CPUs and GPUs, surely

black abyss of wasting your hard-earned 
dollars on the wrong setup.
At long last, with the launch of Skylake, 
we’ve finally seen the full integration of 
DDR4 into the custom PC environment, 
both at consumer and pro-grade levels. 
And although this new generation of RAM 
has much higher frequencies and far lower 
power consumption as standard, the overall 
performance advantages in comparison to 
DDR3 pale into insignificance next to the 
improvements we saw when advancing 
from DDR to DDR2. 
So what is it that makes memory tick? 
What should you be looking out for? And 
what does all that jargon mean? Read on….

the Most obvious and easiest to understand 
memory specification is capacity. The more 
you have, the more use you can make of it. 
Or at least, that’s the theory. In reality, it’s 
entirely dependent on what you're doing and 
the programs you use. For instance, if you 
only intend to play games, 32GB of RAM is 
CapaCitY CoMpLiCations
8GB
We now see this as the bare minimum 
for your average PC. If you want to build 
a solid gaming system, 8GB is plenty for 
pretty much every title out there, even at 
maximum settings. The vast majority of 
game rendering is done inside the GPU’s 
dedicated VRAM, so having more than 
8GB just for gaming is not worth it. If your 
requirements are more sober, 8GB also 
happens to be great for office PCs and basic 
workstations as well—we’re talking Adobe 
Premiere Pro and Photoshop levels here. If 
you’re opening massive Excel spreadsheets 
and 10 to 20 Google Chrome tabs at a time, 
8GB goes a long way to securing a trouble-
free PC experience. Of course, you can use 
any of these applications with less than 
this—4GB would technically be OK for a 
light office PC, but we'd be surprised if you 
can even find 4GB kits for sale. 
16GB
This is the sweet spot for streamers, 
YouTubers, and more serious digital artists. 
Admittedly, you can still do most of that 
on an 8GB setup, but if you’re massively 
into gaming, and fancy delving into the 
murky world of online entertainment, or 
just gorging yourself on more than enough 
memory for your super-large artworks, 
this is the place to start. We recommend 
16GB for the likes of Adobe After Effects 
and Premiere Pro, using 4K footage or 
videos longer than one hour. Out of Adobe’s 
suite, these tend to be the more storage-
intensive applications, After Effects more 
so than Premiere—though it’s still rare 
to see it use more than 16GB of memory. 
That said, you should make sure you have 
the processing power to back it up. An Intel 
Core i7-6700K or 5820K, for example, will 
be plenty to sate your YouTubing ambitions.
32GB
Once you reach these capacities, unless 
you’re heavily into 3D modeling, you’re 
honestly not going to gain much out of it. 
32GB and beyond is great for massive 3D 
renders in Cinema 4D or 3DS Max, but 
anything else? Honestly? Probably not. The 
only other solution you could apply to this 
quantity of memory is to utilize half of it 
as a RAM disk. Programs such as Asus’s 
RAM Cache or ASRock’s RAMDisk help 
store temporary files, the scratch disk, and 
other speed-sensitive data on your DIMMs, 
instead of the primary storage solution in 
your system, allowing far faster reads and 
writes. Admittedly, it is great to have this 
additional space for video rendering, but 
unless you're profiting from your work, at 
this price point you'd be better off dumping 
more funds into other more system-critical 
components, such as the CPU or the GPU.
excessive. So let’s go through a quick rundown 
of what capacity we recommend. Note that 
these figures are for general desktop 
work and play—there are plenty of 
special-use cases that have their own 
memory hogs, and many instances 
when you can get away with much less.

Upgrade Your Memory

You need to configure any RAM you add to 
your PC using the CMOS configuration tool. 
capacity aside, there are two figures you 
need to consider when choosing a new 
memory kit: its operating speed and the 
latency of those modules. It’s easy to assume 
a lot from these figures individually, but you 
need to consider them together to get a true 
picture of what they are capable of. Roughly 
speaking, you want fast modules and low 
latencies, but neither is worth pursuing to 
extremes—as we’ll see.
When talking about latency, there is 
a whole bunch of numbers that define 
how fast any given stick of memory 
operates, but the most useful one to 
highlight is the module’s CAS latency. This 
tends to be advertised after the module's 
frequency, even if you’re not immediately 
given all of the latency settings (it’s always 
the first if they are fully listed). Standing 
for Column Address Strobe (or Common 
Address Strobe, depending on who you 
talk to), this figure tells you how many 
clock cycles it takes the module to access 
a particular memory location and get the 
output ready for transfer. For modern DDR4 
DIMMs, you can expect these latencies to 
be in the range of 15–20 clock cycles. 
The latency on its own doesn’t actually 
tell you that much, at least not without 
tiMings and 
LatenCY
64/128GB
At this point, you’re just satisfying your 
epeen. It’s true, 128GB of memory is 
commercially available—in fact, Corsair 
sells both Vengeance LPX and Dominator 
Platinum kits at this capacity—but it is years 
and years ahead of any mainstream desktop 
application or process that we have available 
to date. We can't even pretend it's viable for 
future-proofing yourself, because by the 
time programs begin to use this amount of 
memory, we'll have moved on to far more 
impressive memory standards. Ultimately, 
even if you were to run nine virtual machines 
on a daily basis, you still wouldn’t be able 
to justify the cost. And if you’re thinking 
of using this to run simulations, you’d be 
far better off using a couple of Xeon cores 
and some ECC-registered DIMMs. Mostly

a dedicated workstation, anyway. 
knowing the speed at which the modules 
are running. And even here it can be a bit 
confusing, partly because DDR4 transfers 
several memory requests at the same time, 
and also because how manufacturers label 
RAM has gone through a lot of changes 
over the years. The end result is that you’ll 
rarely see the actual operating frequency 
of memory quoted in MHz, with million 
transfers per second (MT/s) being the 
preferred measurement. Once you do have 
your CAS latency and your transfer speeds, 
you can ascertain the module's latency in

real-world terms (lower is better), by using 
the formula:
Latency = 2,000/RAM speed x CL
Note that for DDR4, you can ascertain 
the transfer rate from the module's label—
you’re looking for something similar to PC4-
2400. When you’ve got the transfer speed 
and have found the latency, you can work 
out the real-world latency in seconds. So, 
for example, if you were to take a PC4-2400 
module with a CAS latency of 14, you’d get:
Latency = 2,000/2,400 x 14 = 11.67ns
It's worth doing these calculations to see 
how various memory kits compare, as it isn't 
always obvious. It's also interesting to see 
how timings have changed over the years—
take a look at the table on the previous page. 
This covers the various technologies that 
have underpinned consumer memory since 
standard SDRAM. Note that as speeds have 
increased, so the real-world latencies 
have continued to drop. 
Speaking of hertz, it’s important to 
understand that every single component 
in 
your 
machine 
operates at a specific 
frequency. Rather like 
the cycling of a clock, 
these frequencies tick 
and tock with a negative 
and a positive downstroke 
or upstroke.  
Way back in the early days of personal 
computing, SDRAM only registered data 
transfers on the rising pulse of each 
clock cycle. Double data rate SDRAM 
(DDR SDRAM), however, changed this 
by operating on both the rise and fall 
of the clock pulse, increasing standard 
performance two-fold at the time. This 
technology has underpinned computer 
memory timings ever since.
Even here, things aren’t quite as 
straightforward as they could be, and this 
is due to how we report frequencies. Back 
before we made the move to DDR (double 
data rate) RAM, the quoted frequency was 
legitimate. In order to show that DDR was 
Real-world latencies have remained fairly consistent, but the number of clock cycles all those commands take certainly adds up.
Timing Diagram of DDR4 SDRAM 14-14-14-32
faster, though, manufacturers often 
doubled the quoted frequencies, which 
was somewhat confusing, and not strictly 
true. Even now, some websites will report 
DDR4 modules running at 3,000MHz, when 
in truth the memory clock actually runs at 
half that speed.
If you’ve been building your own 
computers for a while now, you’ll be aware 
that when a new memory technology is 
released, the transfer speeds tend to 
be fairly low, while the latencies tend to 
be higher. This is why the outgoing memory 
standard tends to offer better speeds 
than the newer, often more expensive, 
technology. It doesn’t take long for this to 
even out, though, and that’s where we are 
with the latest DDR4 modules. Now is a 
good time to buy, in other words.

any stick of raM can operate at a number

on the platform you use it on. Which

your motherboard should default to the 
settings defined by a small chip on the RAM, 
called the serial presence detect (SPD

Corsair 32GB 
Dominator Platinum 
2,400MHz
Corsair 16GB 
Vengeance LPX 
2,666MHz
Since their introduction to the world stage, Corsair’s Dominator 
Platinums have been more than mere memory. They are the 
pinnacle of artistic design and double data rate applied sciences. 
A symbol of the elite when it comes to computational superpower. 
This is mostly due to the phenomenal price tag that’s often 
associated with these sticks of DDR3/4. Today, however, that’s not 
the case, and although they’re not the cheapest option here, they’re 
far from the most expensive. So for $300 you net yourself 32GB (or 
4x 8GB) of the sleekest, most dependable, quad-channel memory 
out there. With a CAS latency of just 14, and a data rate peaking 
at 2,400MT/s these DDR4 sticks dominate the performance side 
of things, at least when it comes to 7-Zip’s archival benchmarking 
test. This is in no doubt thanks to their increased capacity. And on 
top of that? They also provide some pretty nifty power savings, too.
Interestingly, if you do fancy pushing the boat out that little bit 
further, you can opt for the second lot of XMP settings in your BIOS. 
This ramps the data rate up to 2,666MT/s, and the voltage up by 
another 0.15V. However, you’ll be adding another 52W directly on to 
your electricity bill from that mediocre voltage increase—and it’s 
probably not worth it in the long run.
corSair’S Vengeance LP series has always been designed around 
one simple concept: fitting into places where other DIMMs fear to 
tread. They achieve this admirably, capable of fitting under even 
the meatiest of air-cooling supertowers or low-profile ITX coolers. 
This helps to create a trouble-free HTPC build experience. 
With the launch of Skylake and Haswell-E, Corsair introduced 
the LPX series. The "X" denotes the jump to DDR4. To date, these 
have been Corsair’s finest DDR4 sticks, most notably because 
they’re not held back by the huge price barrier of the Platinums.
Although they pale in the shadow of the Dominators' glory, 
these particular dual-channel memory kits still maintain a sleek 
and sexy feel, hidden out of sight and out of mind. With an all-
black aluminum heatsink, and black PCB, you can’t go wrong here. 
Although they lack the archiving prowess of the Platinums, thanks 
to a lower overall capacity and slightly more sluggish real-world 
latency, they still hold their own in almost every other benchmark. 
And because of the dual-channel setup, these little devils also 
require less power. The only downside? Well, they sit on the simple 
side of design, and if you’re thinking of throwing these underwater, 
they’re not the easiest heatsinks to remove, either.

Corsair 16GB 
Vengeance LPX 
3,200MHz
Crucial 16GB 
Ballistix Elite 2666
now we come to the pinnacle of what Corsair can provide—it’s in 
the interesting offering of these 3,200MT/s Vengeance LPXs that 
we find the current peak of consumer DDR4 technology. Complete 
with included air-cooler and crazy XMP settings, this memory kit 
throws the JEDEC standards out of the window, ramping up the 
overall voltage to 1.35V, and the memory transfer rate all the way 
from 2,133 to 3,200MT/s. Although it’s not as simple as that….
To pass the 2,800MT/s mark, memory manufacturers have to 
tinker with the BCLK. In the Z170 chipset, this isn’t a big deal, as the 
memory BCLK is separate from the CPU. However, this is a quad-
channel kit, designed to work with the X99 platform, which doesn’t 
have such a robust and dynamic memory controller. The XMP 
settings required to reach 3,200MT/s change the BCLK from 100 to 
120MHz. The i7-5820K we use for our testing goes from a 3.3GHz 
clock up to 3.96GHz. What you’ll often find is that your system will 
declock itself in an attempt to boot, and you’ll have to overclock 
it yourself back up to stock. Unfortunately, we couldn't reach 
those stable stock frequencies while maintaining the memory at 
3,200MHz, and all we could achieve was a mere 2.8GHz. 
can you gueSS why Crucial is already on the right foot with us? 
It’s for one reason and one reason alone: it isn't trying to impress 
us with any obscure MHz ratings. Thanks, Crucial, for being the 
honest Joe in the memory milieu. The Ballistix Elites have been 
around for quite some time. Many of you will remember the early 
days of the super-huge heatspreaders that were found in the DDR3 
variants. Well, those times are long past and—hot damn—look at 
these little beauties! The Crucial Ballistix Elites are some of the 
sexiest, sleekest and downright slinkiest all-black RAM modules 
out there. With a powder coat finish, they look perfect in almost 
any build.
And as for performance? Well, that’s another matter. Short of 
Corsair’s “3,200MHz” monsters, and Kingston’s soul-destroying 
Savages, they work out as the third-most expensive memory 
kit in this roundup. But, unfortunately, they only sit at a simple 
2,666MT/s, with a CAS latency of just 15, meaning they operate just 
a micron faster than the Dominator Platinums, yet cost 50 cents 
more per gigabyte. Ultimately, however, performance is pretty 
standard across the board, and you’re not likely to see a huge 
disparity between memory kits, so if you don't mind the hefty cash 
outlay, this is a fair kit to invest in.

Sport 2400
Crucial 16GB 
Ballistix Sport  
LT 2400
cruciaL’S BaLLiStix SPort quad-channel set was actually one 
of the first kits we got in for the new DDR4 memory standard. It 
certainly provided us with a convenient testbed for benchmarking 
many a new processor and graphics card. And as far as value 
for money goes, it’s easily the best in this group test, costing just 
$6.56 per gigabyte. Despite the rather generic design style on the 
heatsinks, the black PCB makes this particular set of DDR4 ideal 
for liquid cooling. Even if you don’t want to ride those watery waves 
to lower-temperature heaven, well, the black PCB at least adds a 
modicum of moodiness.
As for performance, try this for intrigue. This quad-channel kit 
pulls pretty much the same power from the wall as the Ballistix 
Elites, a dual-channel effort. Overall, the benchmark scores are 
a little lower than many of the other kits in this roundup, but for 
everyday usage and video rendering, you can guarantee it won’t 
have much impact on your render times. The real-world latency 
registering at 12.5ns isn’t ideal either, but again, you really won’t 
notice much improvement by chunking out for a more expensive kit 
of RAM, beyond capacity, at this point.
there’S nothing Like coLor-matching your build perfectly. 
Having all of your components correctly correlate in a windowed 
chassis just feels right—it feels good. After all, when you’re 
choosing your memory kit, there’s often not a great deal between 
them, as you can tell from this group test. More often than not, 
it’s what’s affordable, available, and looks best in your build that 
matters. And this is a market that Crucial is tapping into with these 
fantastically white Ballistix Sport LT DIMMs.
However, beyond aesthetics, there’s not a lot here that 
differentiates them from Crucial’s other "sporty" offerings. 
They’re still rated at 2,400MT/s, and they’re still available up to 
16GB-worth of DDR4 capacity. Other downsides? Well, you’re back 
to dual-channel, and you still keep that sadly sluggish CAS latency 
of 16ns, resulting in 13.33ns recurring real-world sloth.
As far as performance goes, they’re within 5 percent of almost 
all the other kits (bar the 32GB monstrosities that are Corsair’s 
Dominator Platinums), though they do come joint first with the 
Patriot Viper Red 2x 8GB for power draw, pulling a total of 160W 
from the wall. Beyond all that, the only other perks are that white 
PCB and the similarly desaturated heatsink. That’s all there is to it. 
Fancy a snowy build? Then bag these beasties.
Cheap and cheerful!

Patriot 16GB  
(2x 8GB) Viper  
Red 2,400MHz
ahh—at LaSt we get to the absolute kings of speed. If you've 
already read about the Corsair Vengeance LPX 3200s, no doubt 
you’ll understand the problems associated with breaking that 
2,800MT/s threshold. It’s difficult if you’re not adjusting the BCLK 
to any great degree. Fortunately, Kingston’s BCLK adjustments are 
far less severe than their Corsair counterparts, and we managed 
to overclock our Intel Core i7-5820K back up to its standard stock 
frequencies, with very minimal changes to the overall VCore or 
other settings nestled deep within the UEFI BIOS. And with that we 
saw some awfully impressive numbers.
With a CAS latency of 15, the real-world latency of these Savages 
drops to 10ns, on a par with Corsair’s 3200 kit. And coupled with 
that stock CPU overclock, it’s by far the fastest memory in this 
group test. Because of that, we saw some phenomenal archiving 
benchmark results: a mind-blowing 386MB/s extraction in 7-Zip, 
and an impressive 31.5GB/s in SiSoft Sandra’s memory bandwidth 
benchmark—more than any other dual-channel kit. The downside 
is that astronomical power draw. At 257W for a dual-channel kit, 
it outstrips even the quad-channel kits for power requirements. 
Patriot haS ProVided some fantastic memory kits over the last 
few years. Certainly, the Patriot Viper Blacks were some of the 
crispest low-profile DDR3 kits we’d ever laid eyes on. So with the 
launch of DDR4, we only expected good things from the Californian 
memory manufacturer.
And here we have it: Patriot’s new line of Viper Reds coming 
in at a snug 2,400MT/s, and a CAS latency of 15. Although they 
are not the fastest memory out there (in fact, they’re the slowest 
in our group test), they do provide dependability and good value 
for money. In fact, they're a solid $7.50 per gigabyte. As far as 
performance goes, however, they’re pretty much where you’d 
expect a standard DDR4 kit to be. Their overall bandwidth is the 
lowest out of our testing, at 28.3GB/s. But you do benefit from a 
fantastically low power draw of only 160W from the wall—one of 
the lowest here.
If you’re after a kit of red RAM for your system, and are only 
focused on gaming and aesthetics, these would be a fine choice. 
The 16GB won’t let you down where it counts, and you won’t see any 
negative effects from purchasing such low latency coupled with a 
comfortable data rate.

Patriot 16GB (4x 4GB) 
Viper Red 2,400MHz
PNY 16GB Anarchy X 
2,800MHz
we’Ve eStaBLiShed that the 2x 8GB kit (previous page) is pretty 
good value for money. And although the benchmarks don’t stack 
up particularly well in comparison to some of the more powerful 
offerings, they’re more than ideal for any gaming rig. So how does 
the quad-channel kit compare? 
Well, you still get that same 2,400MT/s, you still get the CAS 
latency of 15, and you still get the same capacity as the 2x 8GB. 
The only difference is the increase from dual- to quad-channel. 
Ultimately, however, you don’t gain a lot in regard to performance. 
There’s the additional bandwidth. But that doesn’t translate to 
any real-world benefit in our testing, with most, if not all, of our 
benchmarks being within 1 percent of their 2x 8GB twins. One 
thing that constitutes an improvement is the dollars-per-gigabyte 
metric, which at $6.88 is among the best here. But you end up 
paying for that with an additional 20W power draw out of the wall, 
compared to those dual-stick Patriots. It’s a difficult call to make. 
If power costs don’t worry you, these are technically better value. 
And it’s hard to deny how much nicer a system looks with four 
sticks, in comparison to two. Even so, in the long term, that extra 
wattage will cost you.
Pny’S anarchy x kits are some of the more interesting DDR4 
kits we’ve had the opportunity to test for this roundup. They fit 
snugly at the high end of the overclocking spectrum, without 
having to alter the BCLK to any vast degree. This means we can 
get some phenomenal benchmarks with the X99 platform, without 
necessarily having to re-overclock our CPU to stock again. In fact, 
we can increase the overall performance in our system with a 
fairly conservative overclock to the CPU on top of that as well.
And it's a noticeable difference with a stock CPU, with the highest 
PCMark 8 Creative score, and some solid archiving performance in 
both WinRAR and 7-Zip. These sticks fit right into the sweet spot—
they’re not the slowest, nor the fastest memory kit out there. It’s a 
pretty middle-ground kit when it comes to latency as well. Couple 
that with a fairly meaty power draw (if not actually the highest), and 
we’re on to a winner. Why? Well, it’s only $6.88 per gigabyte. And 
for that performance at that price, it’s truly unmatched. 
The only thing that may put you off is that unusual design 
incorporated into the heatsinks—it looks as though PNY has fallen 
into the trap of thinking “gamers like red, pointy things,” which is 
disappointing. Other than that, though, there’s not a lot we can 
criticize about the Anarchy X kit.

BENCHMARKS
BENCHMARKS
When it comes to memory 
testing, finding the right setup 
is crucial. After all, there’s no 
point testing quad-channel 
kits on a Skylake platform. For 
this we cracked out a few old 
favorites: Intel’s Core i7-5820K, 
ASRock’s X99M Extreme4, 
and one GeForce GTX 980, 
all running on Windows 10, 
installed on Samsung’s 512GB 
950 Pro SSD. On top of that, 
we wanted to prove once and 
for all that as long as you have 
8GB, memory frequency, 
latency, and channels don’t 
matter for gaming, so Shadow 
of Mordor was top of the testing 
list. Couple that with Cinebench 
for rendering performance, 
WinRAR and 7-Zip for archiving 
performance, and PCMark 8 for 
creative overall analysis, and 
we were good to go.
HOW WE tEStEd
Best scores are in bold. Overall winner is highlighted. 

memory iS one of the moSt difficuLt components to benchmark 
with a view to truly useful analysis. The problem is that, for the 
vast majority of specs, increased frequencies and lower CAS 
latencies don’t affect gaming in any significant way. We know that 
not everyone here is a gamer, but the fact is that the vast majority 
of the PC enthusiast audience plays games first and foremost, as 
opposed to anything else. Across our entire suite of benchmarks, 
over 10 separate memory kits, ranging from 8GB all the way up 
to 32GB, from 2,133MHz to 3,200MHz, from dual-channel to 
quad-channel, our Shadow of Mordor benchmark did not change 
whatsoever, hitting an average of 27fps each and every time we ran 
it. And even if you’re more interested in the creative utilities found 
within the digital world, just take a look at our PCMark creative 
benchmarks—the only kit that struggled to any great degree did 
so because of a reduced clock speed on the CPU, rather than any 
memory-related matter. 
So with all of these convoluted and confusing memory specs, 
and budget-busting DRAM sticks, which one do we think is best 
for your wallets and your next build? To be honest, it’s not the 
cheapest, it’s not the best-looking, nor is it the best-performing. 
But the PNY 16GB Anarchy X 2,800MHz is the best kit you can buy 
at the moment. Why so? In short, it manages to hit the sweet spot 
in almost every scenario. It performed highest in our PCMark 
Creative test, and it held its own in Cinebench alongside the rest 
of our group test’s participants. Its performance in memory 
bandwidth, WinRAR archiving performance, and 7-Zip was 
essentially flawless. And although the wattage wasn’t great, 
especially for the MT/s it was achieving along with the bandwidth, 
it was at least quite competitive. But the biggest factor is the price. 
You can grab a set of these for only $110. That’s $6.88 per gigabyte, 
and that makes all the difference when the performance metrics 
are so tight. For the average user, these are the best sticks money 
can buy. And if you really want to push the boat out, PNY offers 
a similar set of DDR4 with a phenomenal 2,933MT/s, and a CAS 
latency of 12 to boot. Rest assured, we won’t sleep until we get a set 
of those into the office for the next issue of Maximum PC.
honorable mention
That said, with all the frequencies, CAS latencies, and XMP settings 
on the planet to date, nothing compares to good old capacity for 
real-world performance. Regardless of all those benchmarks, 
Corsair’s Dominator Platinums came a very close second in 
our testing. For looks, they’re second to none, and for outright 
performance, 32GB provides a far greater benefit than any 16GB 
setup, certainly for archival purposes. Interestingly, they are still 
quite the heavy hitter when it comes to price per gigabyte as well.
Although not as expensive as some of the higher frequency kits 
out there, and not as affordable as some of the other 2,400MT/s 
kits, they’re still fairly well priced, certainly in comparison to when 
they were first launched. If you’re after the very best experience, 
64GB of these bad boys should be more than enough to sate your 
epeen appetite, and provide you with enough future-proofing for 
any revolutionary software and gaming advances that may appear 
within the next five years.

It PaYS tO be able to reinstall Windows 
from scratch should you need to. You 
need a blank DVD or spare 8GB USB 
flash drive. First, download the 
Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from 
www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-
download/windows10—choose 32-bit 
or 64-bit depending on your system 
(press 
Windows-Pause/Break 
and 
look under "System" if you don’t 
know). Launch the tool. Select "Create 
installation media for another PC," 
click "Next" and follow prompts to 
select your language, edition, and 
architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). Insert 
your USB flash drive, or create an ISO 
file you can then burn to a single DVD.

deliver 
Windows 
updates. This means your Internet 
connection is used to share updates 
you’ve downloaded with other users. 
If you’re on a slow broadband 
connection, or you’d rather not let 
Microsoft do this, you can change it. 
Click "Start" and choose "Settings." 
Select "Update & Security," and click 
"Advanced options" under "Windows 
Update." Next, click "Choose how 
updates are delivered," and either 
switch the feature off or select "PCs 
on my local network" to further cut 
bandwidth usage by only sharing the 
updates between PCs in your home.
Prepare to Recover
What haPPenS If Windows 10 fails to 
boot? You need a system recovery 
drive that gives you access to 
Windows 10’s repair options. You can 
create a full-blown reinstall disc with 
these tools (see right) or you can 
press a spare 1GB USB flash drive 
into service instead with just the 
repair utilities in place. To do the 
latter, plug the drive into your PC, 
type "recovery" into the "Search" 
box, and click "Create a recovery 
drive" under "Settings." Untick "Back 
up system files to the recovery drive," 
and follow the prompts to create 
your drive. Should you need to use it, 
restart your PC with the drive 
plugged in to access the tools.

Change Default App by File Type 
If YOur aPP ISn’t lISted when trying to set it as the default via "Settings," try this 
instead: Browse to a file you want to open, right-click it, and choose "Open with > 
Choose another app." Tick "Always open this app…" before selecting your chosen 
default. If it’s not in the list, click "More apps" to reveal more choices, and if your 
chosen program still isn’t there, click "Look for another app on this PC" to manually 
select it. Start your search under "Program Files" or "Program Files (x86)."
Change Default  
Apps in Settings 
after uPgradIng tO WIndOWS 10, Microsoft 
changes your default browser to Edge. To fix 
this, click "Start > Settings > System > 
Default apps." Click the Edge entry, then pick 
your browser from the list that pops up. You 
can change other key app defaults here: video, 
photo, mail, and so on. For a wider range of 
app choices, click "Set defaults by app." 
Advanced users can also set defaults by file 
type or protocol using the appropriate links. 
Restore Classic 
Start Menu 
If YOu’ve uPgraded frOM WIndOWS

menu at all. If you’re hankering after 
the "classic" style, download and 
install Classic Shell from www.
classicshell.net. During installation, 
untick all entries except "Classic 
Start Menu" and "Classic Shell 
Update." Once it’s installed, click the 
"Start" button to configure it—the 
default settings should be fine, so 
click "OK." The classic "Start" menu 
blends in with the Windows 10 look, 
but provides settings and shortcuts 
that you’ll be more familiar with—
there’s even a shortcut to the 
Windows 10 "Start" menu, too.

previous versions of Windows. Click 
the search bar to open Cortana. If 
you’re using it for the first time, click 
"Not

to

it; 
otherwise, click the "Settings" button 
and flick the "Use Cortana" switch to 
"Off." You can also disable the web

Restore Briefcase 
It MaY have nIChe aPPeal, but the Briefcase was one of the earliest tools for 
keeping data synched between two locations. While it’s been removed from Windows 
10 (and 8), you can get it back again with a Registry tweak. Download the required 
file 
from 
http://winaero.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Briefcase.zip. 
Double-click it to open it, then double-click "Windows 8-Enable Briefcase.reg." 
Click "Run," followed by "Yes" twice, then restart Explorer via Task Manager to 
restore its features. Note: It doesn’t work well with User Account Control, so don’t 
create Briefcases inside any administrator-protected folders.
Tighten Privacy  
in Edge Browser
If YOu StICk with Edge, there 
are some important privacy 
settings you need to switch on 
before relying on it. Launch the 
browser, then click the "…" 
button in the top-right corner, 
and choose "Settings." Scroll 
down 
and 
click 
"Advanced

"Block pop-ups" slider is set to 
"On." While you’re there, flick 
"Send Do Not Track requests" to

"Block only third-party cookies" 
for greater privacy.

hankering after the old "Display Settings" 
dialog from Windows 7 and 8, you can 
create a shortcut to it on the desktop. 
Right-click some blank space, and then 
choose "New > Shortcut." Now type the 
following into the "Location" box:
"control.exe desk.cpl,Settings,@Settings"
Click "Next," give the shortcut a suitable 
name, and click "Finish." Now you can use 
this freshly created shortcut to tweak your 
display settings. 
Customize Hidden 
Start Menu 
WIndOWS 10 haS a hidden "Start" 
menu—press Windows-X or right-
click the "Start" button. The menu 
includes shortcuts to hidden parts of 
your system, such as the old Control 
Panel, Run dialog box, and Event 
Viewer. But you can add your own, or 
rearrange 
and 
delete 
existing 
shortcuts with Win+X Menu Editor. 
Download the zip file from http://

Remove Unwanted Apps 
WIndOWS 10 ShIPS with a number of built-in apps, such as Mail, Money, and Groove 
Music. However, if you don’t like any of these, Microsoft doesn’t provide an "Uninstall" 
option to help you get rid of them. You can still ditch them, though, with IOBit 
Uninstaller 5 (www.iobit.com/advanceduninstaller.php). Once installed, open the 
app from the "Start > All apps" menu, then select "Win Manager" from the left-
hand menu, and select "Windows Apps." Expand the "Windows Apps" section, 
where you’ll see all the apps listed. Click the dustbin next to one to remove it. Any 
apps can be restored later through the Store.
Tame Quick 
Access 
QuICk aCCeSS can be a mess, 
mixing pinned icons, frequently 
accessed 
folders, 
and 
recent 
items. Open File Explorer, switch 
to "View," and click "Options." 
Disable the latter two via "Privacy," 
and instruct File Explorer to open 
to the "This PC" view instead of 
"Quick Access." You can pin the 
"Recent Places" shortcut to "Quick 
Access"—press Windows-R, type 
%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\ 
and press Enter. Right-click the 
"Recent 
Items" 
shortcut, 
and 
choose "Pin to Quick Access."
Restore Classic  
Alt-Tab Switcher 
Press Alt-tAb, and Windows 10 displays 
a list of thumbnails for all of your open 
windows. If you would rather stick with 
the old look, press Windows-R, and type 
"regedit" 
to 
open 
Registry 
Editor. 
Browse to the following key: "HKEY_
C U R R E N T _ U S E R \ S O F T W A R E \
Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\

(32-bit)

Name 
it 
"AltTabSettings." Double-click the value 
and set it to 1. Now restart Explorer 
from Task Manager to restore the icon 
task switcher.
Improve  
Windows Update 
bY default, Windows Update now 
delivers all updates automatically. 
While 
you 
can’t 
put 
them 
off 
indefinitely, you can improve matters. 
Go to "Settings > Update & Security 
> Windows Update > Advanced 
Options." Windows 10 Pro users can 
select "Defer upgrades" to put off 
non-security updates for several 
months. Windows 10 Home users, on 
the other hand, should set "Choose 
how updates are installed" to "Notify 
to schedule restart," so they can 
receive alerts that updates are about 
to be installed. Home users with  
Wi-Fi connections can also postpone 
updates 
by 
going 
to 
"Settings  
> Network & Internet > WiFi > 
Advanced Options," and flicking the 
"Metered Connection" switch to "On" 
until you are ready to update. 
Switch System  
Restore Back On 
dOn’t aSk uS WhY, but on some systems 
Windows 10 disables System Restore by default. 
The first thing to do, then, is switch it back on. 
Press Windows-Pause/Break to open "System 
Properties," and click "System Protection" in 
the left-hand column. You should see that 
"Protection Settings" have been switched off for 
all your drives. Locate your Windows drive (it 
should be marked "System"), and click the 
"Configure…" button. Select "Turn on system 
protection," and allocate up to 10 percent of 
your available space using the slider. Click "OK" 
twice to finish the job.

Run Older Apps 
MOSt aPPS that work in Windows 7 and 8 should also work in Windows 10, but if your 
app doesn’t work, all may not be lost. If you still have access to a non-OEM copy of 
an older version of Windows, you can install it in a virtual machine, courtesy of 
VirtualBox (www.virtualbox.org). Basically, this enables you to create a virtual PC 
inside Windows 10, into which you can install your old programs while you look for 
a compatible update or suitable alternative.
Bypass Login 
If YOu’re the OnlY uSer of your PC, and you’d 
like to boot straight to the desktop without 
having to enter your password, here’s what to 
do. Press Windows-R to open the "Run" dialog, 
then type "netplwiz," and press Enter. Make 
sure your user account is selected, then untick 
"Users must enter a username and password 
to use this computer," and click "Apply." Enter 
your user password and click "OK" twice. 
Windows will also require you to enter your 
password after your PC wakes from sleep. If 
security isn’t an issue, click "Start > Settings 
> Accounts > Sign-in options," and change 
the "Require sign-in" drop-down to "Never." 
Recover Hard  
Drive Space 
OnCe YOu’re uP and running with 
Windows 10, and convinced you 
won’t need to go back to your 
previous version of Windows, it’s 
time to free up some drive space. 
Open File Explorer, go to "This PC," 
right-click your "C" drive, choose 
"Properties," then click "Disk Clean-
up." As soon as the dialog opens, 
click "Clean up system files," and 
wait for it to scan again. Go through 
the list, ticking those items you don’t 
need—the biggest item by far will be 
"Previous Windows installation(s)." 
Tick this to free up space, but 
remember there’s no going back 
once the files are gone.
OneDrive Changes 
One Of the beSt features of OneDrive 
in Windows 8 was the ability to use 
"placeholders" for certain folders, 
effectively giving you access to your 
stored files without having to also hold 
a copy on your hard drive. Sadly, 
Windows 10 ditches this feature (for 
now). Instead, you need to specify 
which folders you want to keep synched 
on your PC. To do this, right-click the 
OneDrive 
icon 
in 
the 
Taskbar 
Notification area, and select "Settings." 
Switch to the "Choose Folders" tab, 
and click "Choose Folders." Untick 
"Sync all files and folders on my 
OneDrive," and then tick only those 
folders you need access to.
Disable Wi-Fi Sense 
If YOu COnneCt wirelessly to your 
network, the Wi-Fi Sense feature, 
which connects you to crowdsourced 
Wi-Fi hotspots and networks shared 
by your contacts, is enabled by 
default if you choose "Express 
Settings" during the Windows 10 
upgrade process. It’s designed to 
make it easier to connect to friends’ 
networks through your Facebook, 
Outlook.com, or Skype contacts list. 
If 
you’d 
rather 
not 
share 
this 
information, you can disable it. Click 
"Start > Settings > Network & 
Internet > WiFi." Click "Manage WiFi 
Settings," and flick both switches to 
"Off" to prevent your network details 
being shared with others.

Ok, 
we 
all 
knOw that SteamOS 
has been a colossal failure so far. 
Unsurprisingly, Linux simply cannot 
compete with Windows when it comes to 
the fiery crucible that is frame rendering 
combat. However, that shouldn’t put 
you off small-form-factor living-room 
gaming. No, sir, not by a long shot. 
Fortunately, Valve did innovate in one 
vital area: Big Picture Mode. Couple that 
with a capable mini PC from Zotac, and 
we’re on to a winner. The true beauty 
of Zotac’s Magnus resides at its heart. 
Beating silently and confidently for 
all of your computational needs is a 
beautifully power-efficient Intel Core 
i5-5200U. And what’s the perfect match 
for that? Well, how about a full-fledged 
Nvidia GeForce GTX 960? Couple that 
with up to 16GB of DDR3, one M.2 SSD, 
and two 2.5-inch hard drives, and you’re 
set for one perfectly beautiful 1080p 
gaming experience. –Zak STOReY

It’s a beauty
Zotac has managed 
to develop a stunningly 
simple yet elegant case, 
with enough room inside 
to ensure you have all the 
necessary components 
available for a truly 
1080p-ready gaming 
experience. Move aside 
consoles, you’ve got 
nothing on the Magnus.

2 Full GTX 960
Interestingly, the 
GPU inside the Magnus 
EN970 is a full Nvidia 
GeForce GTX 960, and  
not the mobile edition. 
Although you’re not going 
to be overclocking this 
puny thing any time soon, it 
should provide more than 
enough frames for casual 
gaming in your living room.
3 Alternatively…
Still hooked on the 
idea of a Steam Machine  
for your living room?  
Don’t care about the 
performance hit? Well,  
you could opt for Zotac’s 
NEN Steam Machine,  
the SN970. It’s identical  
in almost every way, bar 
the slight upgrade to a 
Skylake CPU.

Staff writer
CPU qUeries
I want to talk to you about processors. 
It’s something of a sticky subject for 
me. I love overclocking, I love CPUs, 
and I love watching those benchmark 
figures climb higher. Hell, even seeing 
those 12 little squares rendering that 
bland image in Cinebench R15 makes 
me happy. So what’s the problem at 
the moment, then? Well, I’m currently 
planning my next build. Just before I 
joined the Maximum PC team, I gave 
my previous rig away to a good friend 
of mine. In short, I couldn’t keep it at 
my old man’s house, and I couldn’t 
haul it all the way over to my new place 
either, so I figured that he could make 
more use out of it.
And because of that, it’s put me in 
an interesting position. I have to be 
careful about what decision I take next. 
Which CPU I should purchase. I would 
absolutely adore to have an Intel Core 
i7-5930K. It’s the dream CPU, as far as 
I’m concerned. Not ridiculously over 
the top on price or core count, yet it 
harbors enough PCIe lanes to sate my 
desire for a two-way SLI/Xfire setup, 
and an M.2 PCIe drive. Question is, 
do I really need it? And the answer? 
Probably not. I just can’t warrant it. I 
don’t stream, I don’t render videos, and 
I don’t do any 3D modeling, so the extra 
cores and Hyper-Threading just don’t 
make sense for me. I’d be far better 
off investing in an Intel Core i5-6600K, 
certainly as far as gaming goes. It’s 
important that we head back to that 
old Intel adage: If you don’t profit from 
Hyper-Threading and more cores, it’s 
just not worth it.

BACKGROUND:
Every once in a while, cloud software giant Valve tries its hand 
at hardware—see the Steam Machine. This time, it’s promised 
to revolutionize the way we game with its Steam Controller. 
The company has impressed us with highly modular tech in the 
past, so let’s find out how much game this controller has. 
   MAJOR TECH SPECS:
    •  High-definition haptic feedback
 •  Dual trackpads
•  USB 2.0 via micro-USB port
•  Six-axis combination gyroscope-accelerometer sensor
•  Dual-stage digital triggers with 10° of travel, magnetic flux 
sensor, and tactile switch
•  Up to 80 hours of gameplay from two removable AA batteries
• Five meters of wireless communication range
KEY FINDINGS:
•  The rear cover snaps off with no tools required to reveal the 
model number: 1001. After rooting around the battery 
compartment, we punch through the sticker on the back to 
find three T6 Torx screws. With the rear housing removed, we 
get our first look inside.
•  Underneath the rear casing, we find a couple of battery eject 
levers. Faster battery replacements mean less time not 
playing games. While battery eject levers are nice, what 
we’re actually interested in is Valve’s decision to abstain from 
using an integrated battery. 
•  It’s a trap! Lifting the motherboard out of its housing reveals 
a couple of hidden ribbon cables connecting the touchpads to 
the underside of the board. Removing the mobo without 
dispatching these cables will increase your repair woes. 
•  We use a plastic opening tool from our new Pro Tech Toolkit 
to bust the touchpad out from its bracket bars. The ribbon 
cable plugs into a socket on the touchpad daughterboard and 
is soldered to the haptic feedback actuators. The brains of 
the operation is a Cirque 1CA027 companion MCU. 
•  The dual-stage trigger can be broken down into two stages: 
The first is the smooth motion of the trigger when pressed. 
The magnetic flux sensor measures the position and speed of 
the trigger based on a time-varying flux. The second part is 
the click when the trigger presses a button on the mobo.
•  Repairability Score: 8 out of 10 (10 is easiest to repair). The 
only adhesive we encountered was on the touchpads. All 
other mechanical connections are made with screws. The 
Controller’s modular construction means replacing a single 
component is a simple task. While we always say screws 
before glue, the non-magnetic screws here are apt to get 
misplaced. The most likely-to-fail component, the 
thumbstick, is soldered directly to the motherboard. 
Dual motion 
triggers— 
ooh, fancy!

Play Retro Games on 
Your Raspberry Pi

Install retroPIe 
You can manually install RetroPie on top of an existing Raspbian 
distro but it’s more convenient to use the pre-baked image. In 
addition to the Raspberry Pi 2 [Image a], the distro works with the 
older models as well, so make sure you grab the correct image. You 
need to transfer this image to at least a 4GB card, either using the 
“dd” command in Linux, such as
 dd if=retropie-rpi2.img of=/dev/sdd
or with the Win32 Disk Imager app in Windows. You also need a 
USB keyboard and mouse for some initial setup that you can’t do 
Video games in the ’80s were quite different from the latest crop of frag-’em-till-you’re-dead point-
and-shoot games. They were tastefully crafted, 8-bit graphical masterpieces, with an intense 
storyline, and gameplay that kept you engrossed for hours. If reading this makes you feel nostalgic, 
you’re in luck, because you can emulate the golden era of gaming consoles on your modern 
hardware and escape back to the 1980s. 
The new quad-core Raspberry Pi 2 has enough number-crunching power to recreate the video 
game consoles of yesteryear virtually. Most of the software that creates the defunct platforms is 
available as open-source software, which you can install on top of a Raspbian distro. However, 
the easiest way to start playing vintage games on the Raspberry Pi is to install the purpose-made 
RetroPie distro, which packs a bundle of emulators. –Mayank SharMa

remotely via SSH. We’ll hook up a compatible Wi-Fi adapter 
to the Raspberry Pi, too, which won’t work straight out of 
the box, but we’ll get to that later. Most important, make 
sure you grab some gaming controllers to enjoy the games 
to the hilt. RetroPie can work with various controllers, from 
cheap no-names ones to PS3 and Xbox 360 controllers. 
>> Once you have prepared the memory card with the 
RetroPie image, insert it into the Pi, connect the controller, 
the Wi-Fi adapter, the speakers, and the USB input devices, 
hook it up to your HDMI monitor, and power it up. The Pi 
boots directly into Emulation Station, which is the graphical 
B
The RetroPie script is a wonderful tool 
that you can use to convert a stock 
Raspbian distro into the ultimate arcade 
machine. Or, if you are already running 
a version of RetroPie, you can use the 
script to update to a newer version, 
without downloading and reinstalling the 
whole thing all over again. 
To upgrade your installation, exit 
Emulation Station and enter the following 
in the CLI:
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get upgrade
The above commands refresh the 
distro’s repositories, and bring it up 
to date by re-installing any outdated 
packages. With the base distribution 
updated, it’s now time to update the 
various gaming emulators. Again on the 
CLI, type:
 $ cd RetroPie-Setup
 $ sudo ./retropie_setup.sh
As you are in the script, the first task is 
to update the RetroPie-Setup script itself. 
The script lists two different upgrade 
options at the top. The first one fetches 
pre-built binaries of the emulators, 
while the second one compiles them 
from source. The former option is faster, 
while the latter, although excruciatingly 
slow on the Raspberry Pi, fetches the 
bleeding-edge versions of the emulators. 
You can safely ignore the second option, 
and just go with the first one, which 
downloads and sets up new versions of 
all of the emulators.

interface it uses to enable you to switch between emulators. 
The interface asks you to configure the controller. However, before 
we do that, we have to tweak a couple of settings. Press the F4 key 
on the keyboard to exit the Emulation Station, then head to the CLI. 
2 
BasIc setuP 
The first order of business is to expand the image to take over 
the entire card. Bring up Raspbian’s configuration utility with
 sudo raspi-config
and select the first option to expand the filesystem. Once that’s 
done, head to the second option to change the default password for 
the pi user. 
>> Next, head to “Advanced Options” and select the “SSH” option 
to enable remote access. To ensure you use the maximum memory 
for gaming, head to the “Memory Split” option. If you’re using a 
Raspberry Pi 2, allocate 512 to the GPU. Users of the older B+ model 
should earmark 256. Finally, scroll down to the “Overclock” option 
[Image B], where users of the Raspberry Pi 2 should select the “Pi2” 
option. Once done, head back to the main menu and select “Finish” 
to restart the Raspberry Pi and bring the changes into effect.
3 
confIgure WI-fI adaPter 
When you’re back up again, press F4 once more to exit out of 
Emulation Station. We’ll now get the Wi-Fi adapter to work. 
Open the configuration file with
 sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
and then change its contents to resemble the following:
 auto lo
 iface lo inet loopback
 iface eth0 inet dhcp
 allow-hotplug wlan0
 auto wlan0
 iface wlan0 inet dhcp
     wpa-ssid “Your Wireless Network Name”
     wpa-psk “Your Wireless Network Password”
Replace the text between the “ ” with the SSID and password for 
your Wi-Fi network. Press Ctrl-X to save the file and exit the text 
editor. Now reboot the Pi with “sudo reboot.” Once it comes back 
up, your Wi-Fi adapter connects you to your router. From this point 
on, you can do the configuration remotely from another computer. 
>> Exit Emulation Station yet again, and make a note of the IP 
address RetroPie has been assigned by your router. Assuming it is 
192.168.3.111, you can now log in to it from another computer with
 sudo ssh pi@192.168.3.111. 
>> Irrespective of how you access the Pi, you must now tweak the 
RetroPie settings. Change to the “RetroPie-Setup” directory with
 cd ~/RetroPie-Setup
C
1. Network traNsfers
If RetroPie is connected to your router, you can transfer game 
ROMs to it from any computer on the same network. The distro 
ships with a pre-configured Samba server, and shows up as a 
Windows share. Copy the ROMs inside the directory for their 
particular emulator.
2. Via UsB
The easiest way to transfer ROMs is to use a USB flash drive. 
When it detects a USB disk, RetroPie creates a directory 
structure for ROM files that mirrors the emulators installed 
on the distro. Wait a while as it creates the directories and 
then remove the drive.
3. PlUg aNd Play
Now put that USB stick into your desktop PC, and copy the 
ROMs on to it, making sure to put them in the right folder. 
When you put this memory stick back in your Pi, RetroPie 
pulls the ROMs into the matching directory for the associated 
emulators automatically.

and execute the configuration script with
 sudo ./retropie_setup.sh
The script fetches any required packages that are missing from 
your installation. When it’s ready, the script displays an Ncurses-
based menu. First up, scroll down to the second-to-last option, 
which updates the RetroPie-Setup script itself. Once it’s done, 
re-launch the script and scroll down to the third option, labeled 
“Setup/Configuration.”
4 
adjust audIo 
In here, scroll down and select option “323,” which 
makes the necessary changes to display the RetroPie 
configuration menu in Emulation Station. This helps you 
make changes to the distro without heading back to the CLI 
interface. Now, depending on your audio gear and how it’s 
connected to the Raspberry Pi, you might need to hand-hold 
RetroPie before it can send audio output correctly. Select option 
number “301” to configure the audio settings. If the default auto 
option isn’t playing any sound, scroll down and select the output to 
which your speakers are connected. The menu also gives you the 
option to bring up the mixer to adjust the volume. 
5 
confIgure controllers 
Now reboot the distribution one last time, and this time 
continue with Emulation Station. If you’ve connected 
your controller, the distro picks it up. Press and hold any key on 
the controller to help the distro correctly identify it. It then asks you 
to map the keys on the controller. Be aware that this basic mapping 
is only for navigating the graphical interface, and helping you 
switch between the emulated system and selecting a game. Once 
you’ve set up the controller, you’re dropped into the main 
menu of the Emulation Station interface. 
>> Now, to set up the controller for gaming, head to 
the “RetroPie” menu in Emulation Station, and select 
“Configure RetroArch Keyboard/Joystick” [Image c]. Use 
the keyboard to select the first option, labeled “Configure 
Joystick/Controller.” Then follow the on-screen prompts 
to set up your controller. If your controller doesn’t have the 
buttons you’re being asked for, just wait for a few seconds 
and the setup will move on to the next button.
6 
Install controller drIvers 
If you use an Xbox 360 or a PS3 controller, you first 
have to install their drivers before RetroPie can pick 
them up. In earlier versions, this involved some hacking 
on the command line. However, in the latest version of the 
distro, it’s a very simple and straightforward affair. Head to 
the “RetroPie-Setup” option in the “RetroPie” menu inside 
Emulation Station. This brings you to the Ncurses menu 
of the RetroPie-Setup script we were in earlier. Use the 
keyboard to select the third option to configure the distro. 
Scroll through the list and select the relevant option to 
install the driver for your controller—number “318” to 
install the PS3 driver, and number “332” to install the 
driver for the Xbox 360 controller. 
>> The Xbox360 script downloads the xboxdrv driver 
and edits the “/etc/rc.local” file to start the driver 
on boot. The script adds entries for wired 360 
controllers. If you are using wireless controllers, 
open the “/etc/rc.local” file in a text editor, hunt for 
the lines that begin with “xboxdrv,” and replace the  
“--id option” with “--wid.”
7 
tWeak for Ps3 controllers 
If you are using PS3 controllers, once you’ve 
installed the drivers using the script as described 
earlier, you’re prompted to plug in the Bluetooth adapter 
for the controllers. Even after you do so, RetroPie will fail 
to detect your controllers. This is to be expected, according 
to the developers. Exit the script and out of Emulation 
Station. Once you’re back on the command line, switch 
to 
the 
“/opt/retropie/supplementary/ps3controller/” 
directory and type
sudo ./sixpair
This nifty little utility should detect the Bluetooth adapter 
and make it known to RetroPie.

Don’t sweat if you don’t have a gaming 
controller —you can create and use a 
virtual one from within your smartphone 
or tablet instead.
To create the virtual gamepad, head to 
the CLI and enter the following commands 
to install the required components:
 $ sudo apt-get update 
 $ sudo apt-get upgrade
 $ wget http://node-arm.herokuapp.com/ 
 node_latest_armhf.deb
 $ sudo dpkg -i node_latest_armhf.deb
Once you have the components, 
switch to the root user with the “su” 
command. You’re prompted for the root 
user’s password (“raspberry”). Once 
authenticated, enter:
 # git clone https://github.com/miroof/ 
 node-virtual-gamepads
 # cd node-virtual-gamepads
 # npm install
 # npm install pm2 -g
The above steps take a little time to 
complete. Once they’ve finished, you can 
launch the controller and enable it to 
start up automatically at boot:
 # pm2 start main.js
 # pm2 startup
 # sudo pm2 save
Now grab your phone or tablet, 
open the web browser (the developers 
recommend Google Chrome for best 
results), and enter the IP address of the 
Pi in the address bar. You should now see 
a virtual controller on the page. Note that 
you need to configure your controller with 
Emulation Station and RetroArch, just as 
you would with a physical controller. The 
game controller web application also 
provides haptic feedback—if you find it 
irritating, you can deactivate it by taking 
your device off vibration.

>> Now reboot the Raspberry Pi and, once it’s back up, change 
to the “/dev/input” directory, and list its contents with “ls.” If your 
controller has been detected, it’s listed as “js0.” You can test the 
controller by using
jstest /dev/input/js0
which brings up the jstest program, designed to test the features 
of a controller. Now head back to the “RetroPie” menu in Emulation 
Station, and use the “Configure RetroArch Keyboard/Joystick” 
option to set up your controller [Image d]. And that’s it—your 
controllers are now all set up and ready to go. You can do this with 
all your controllers, and RetroPie saves the configuration and 
automatically loads it whenever you plug the controller in.

start gamIng! 
You can now scroll through Emulation Station 
and play the pre-installed games with the game 
controllers you’ve set up. When you’re done with those 
games, follow the walkthrough on page 63 to transfer your 
own gaming ROMs into RetroPie. There are several sites, 
such as World of Spectrum (www.worldofspectrum.org), 
that host legally downloadable ROMs for free, donated or 
abandoned by their developers. True retro gaming fans 
will have created their own ROMs from old cartridges, 
though, which isn’t too tricky, thanks to adapters such as 
the Retrode. 
1. CoNfigUre sCUmmVm
Start the launcher and click on “Options.” Switch to the last 
tab, which houses miscellaneous settings. Use the “Theme” 
button to change the visual appearance of the launcher. The 
“GUI Renderer” setting defines how the launcher is rendered, 
and the “Autosave” option controls the length of time that 
ScummVM waits between saves.
3. add games
To load a supported game into ScummVM, copy its data files 
from the original media. If you’ve downloaded the files from 
ScummVM’s website, you have to extract them before copying 
them into RetroPie. Then run ScummVM, press “Mass Add,” 
and point ScummVM to the extracted folder. It auto-detects 
any games in there, and they appear in the game list.
2. defaUlt Paths

Protect Windows 10
1
Switch on windowS defender
If you used Express Settings when you installed Windows 10, 
or bought your PC with the OS already installed, then Windows 
Defender is probably already switched on. To check, click “Control 
Panel > Update & Security > Windows Defender,” and if it looks 
like [image A], panic and switch all three options on. If you’ve got 
concerns about what Microsoft is doing with your data—maybe 
you have something terrible to hide—then only switch on the top 
option. The other two send data about malware threats on your 
PC to MS, and enroll you in the program now known as Microsoft 
Active Protection Service, which was renamed possibly because its 
previous name of Microsoft SpyNet was too terrifying.
2
UpdAte defender
Keeping Windows Defender updated is important. The 
malware definitions should update automatically, but if you 
open Windows Defender and it warns you it’s out of date, click the 
“Update” tab, and hit “Update Definitions” to start the process.
3
ScAn yoUr pc
Using Windows Defender to run a scan every now and then 
doesn’t hurt, and you have a choice of three kinds. Quick is 
the scan you should do most often. It only looks in places malware 
is likely to be found, and doesn’t take up too much time. A Full scan 
looks everywhere, and is most often used after an infestation has 
been taken care of, to mop up any stragglers. Custom [image B] 
enables you to specify which drives and folders are scanned. We 
struggle to think of a reason why you’d want to do this—maybe if 
When you’re a PC, everything is out to get you. You need to learn how to shut the door on malicious 
software, and clean it out if it does take hold.
We already know that you don’t browse movie streaming sites, frequent dating services populated 
by young ladies from the former Soviet Union who occasionally use stock photos as profile pictures, 
or merrily execute every .exe attachment you discover in your email spam folder—but even though 
you’re a paragon of online virtue, there are still things you can do to protect your PC.
As a responsible Windows 10 user, you’re probably already doing them. You chose “Express 
Settings” at install or flicked the button marked “Help protect your PC,” and allowed Windows to 
download and install updates.
There are also third-party applications you can install to help protect against and remove 
malware should it somehow become resident on your PC. However, the old advice against having 
two antivirus apps installed at the same time still holds: They can clash, and report each other as 
potentially unwanted programs.
The best way to keep your PC clean is to be careful where you point your browser. In fact, never 
go on the Internet again, like your mother told you. –Ian EvEndEn

There are solutions for other 
versions of Windows. 
you’ve got some files that are notorious for giving false-
positive results, or you have a lot of data that’s known to be 
clean, and you want to save time. Either way, the option is 
there if you need it.
4
chooSe yoUr BrowSer
Even when Windows Defender is switched on, 
there’s still no excuse for not following a few best-
practice rules when killing time on the Internet. Use a 
modern browser that’s kept up to date—the Edge browser 
that ships with Windows 10 is actually very good in terms 
of security, justifying the break with Internet Explorer’s 
security-risk-riddled legacy. Google’s Chrome browser 
is a good choice, and has an offshoot—the Epic Privacy 
Browser (www.epicbrowser.com)—which blocks pretty 
much everything.
5
A SecUre AlternAtive
Another option, and another Chrome-a-like, 
is online security company Comodo’s Dragon 
browser (there’s an Ice Dragon variant based on Firefox 
if you prefer). Comodo maintains its own DNS system, 
which you can choose to use either for just the browser 
or for your whole PC when you install Dragon [image c]. 
Comodo’s DNS filters out the addresses of known malware 
providers, but there’s another feature that makes Dragon 
even more secure: Virtual Mode. Entering this means

installing Comodo’s Internet security package, which you may not 
want to do, but once it’s there, you can run a browser that’s isolated 
from the rest of your system—no matter where you choose to stick 
it, no harm can come to the rest of your PC.
6
check qUArAntined fileS
If the worst does happen, and that beguiling email from a 
dating site you don’t remember signing up to turns out to 
be too good to be true [image d], a Windows Defender scan will 
flag the attachment you downloaded as infected and quarantine it. 
Quarantined files are viewed from the History tab, from where you 
can choose to delete them or, if you’re sure they really contain the 
pictures they claim to, allow them to run.
7
get A Second opinion
Malwarebytes (www.malwarebytes.org) is a program that 
will run happily alongside Windows Defender, and is well 
worth having. There’s a free version, which will, of course, bug 
you to upgrade to the paid version, which offers real-time 
protection like Windows Defender [image e]. If Windows is 
acting up and Defender can’t find anything, a scan with a 
second application can sometimes turn up the culprit.
8
rUn A MAlwAreByteS ScAn
Once installed, Malwarebytes will update itself and 
then ask you to run a scan—this took less than four 
minutes on our test PC with 3TB of storage on board, but 
it may take a little longer if you have a lot of data for it to 
sort through. 
9
reMove MAlicioUS SoftwAre
There’s one more Microsoft solution if you’re sure 
your computer is infected and you need something 
to clean it out—the Malicious Software Removal Tool 
(http://bit.ly/1YuQBRE) [image f]. MS sneakily attempts to 
add a script to change your default search engine to Bing 
with the download, but uncheck that and the 50MB file can 
be downloaded. In action, the tool looks a lot like Windows 
Defender, with options for Quick, Full, or Custom scans.
10
All Set
Rather than block malicious programs from 
running, the MSRT deletes them once they’re 
installed, so is a way of fighting back rather than a defense. 
If you follow the advice in Maximum PC, and don’t trust 
every link and email attachment you come across, you 
shouldn’t need to use it. 
F
A false-positive result occurs when an anti-malware app 
thinks a file is malicious when it isn’t. A common trick to 
infect the unwary is to claim a download is innocuous but will 
trigger a false positive, and this is almost always a lie. The 
best advice is to not run a file unless you are completely sure 
of its origin and trust the source.
The detection of malicious files through their actions 
is known as “heuristics,” and Malwarebytes includes it in 
its scans. Heuristics is most useful for detecting unusual 
activity, say a supposed image file that contains executable 
code. If you’ve got a script that makes changes to your system 
that uses the same methods as a known virus, a heuristic 
analysis could flag it as malicious.

Retouch Skin in 
Adobe Photoshop
1
Get to work
This photo was taken in bright sun, and as a result is suffering 
from some highlight hotspots, especially on the left of the 
model’s face [Image A]. For now, we need to get stuck in with the 
skin retouching—and that means the Healing Brush in Photoshop 
CC or Elements. Click the “Spot Healing” tool (J), set it to an 
appropriate size, and choose “Context Sensitive” as the “Type.” 
Then click on every spot and blemish you can see.
2
Zoom In
The context-sensitive nature of the brush means it tries to 
blend the repair in with the surrounding pixels, and a lot of 
the time it succeeds [Image B]. If a repair looks unnatural or just 
plain wrong, though, hit Ctrl-Z and try again, perhaps softening the 
edge of the brush a bit. Work while zoomed in, because your aim is 
for nobody to know you were ever there, like a CIA agent at the site 
of a presidential assassination.
3
CreAte lAyers
That was the easy bit. In order to soften the skin further, 
we’re going to make use of Photoshop’s layers—one of 
the most powerful and versatile features of the program. Open 
the “Layers” palette (“Window > Layers” or F7) [Image C], and 
double-click the layer called “Background.” This turns it into a 
normal layer. Then right-click it and select “Duplicate Layer” twice, 
so you now have three layers, which are all the same. Give them 
appropriate names—we’re going to use “1” and “2,” with “1” in front 
of “2” in the stack. We’ve kept “0,” the original background layer, 
hidden as a backup. 
The selfie is an apT icon for our narcissisTic age. Being able to stare into the limpid pools 
of your own eyes is one thing, but taking such a picture without the assistance of someone else 
elevates it to new levels of self-love. Other people are only needed when you share your picture 
online, and they press a “Like” button, or post an adoring comment.
But how to get more adoration while gazing into the reflective surface of the Internet? You can 
start by retouching your skin, because no matter how much you moisturize, there will still be some 
imperfections. Happily, Photoshop can sweep them all away—but it’s important not to go too far 
and end up with a complexion that’s on the smooth side of Barbie’s butt. The “beauty” modes built 
into smartphone cameras push things too far this way, so it’s better to edit your images after you’ve 
taken them, rather than letting an app’s guesswork make all the decisions. –ian EvEndEn

Blur BlemIshes AwAy
Select layer 1, the top-most layer. We’re going to 
blur away all the skin blemishes—in fact, almost 
all the recognizable features—with one of the Blur filters. 
Experiment with the one that looks best for your subject. 
We’re going to try Gaussian to begin with, which completely 
obliterates our lovely young model’s features. Surface 
Blur is another filter worth trying, and if you’re patient, give 
Smart Blur a go for the most options—but also the longest 
processing time before you see the result.
5
APPly ImAGe
When you’ve settled on a blur (you might find 
yourself going back and trying it several times 
before you’re happy), ”OK” it, and with layer 1 still selected, 
go to the “Image” menu and select “Apply Image”—an odd

name for a tool that blends images together. In the “Layer” field, 
select “2,” then choose “Subtract” as your Blend Mode—your 
image will start to look a little strange. We’ve set “Scale” to “1” and 
“Offset” to “128”—again, play with these variables to see what looks 
best for your photo.
6
exPerIment wIth Blend modes
Once you’ve pressed “OK” on “Apply Image,” head over to 
the “Layers” palette again, and change the “Blend Mode” of 
layer 1 to “Soft Light.” Layer 2 should now show through layer 1, but 
be softened by the layer above. Change the “Blend Mode” to “Vivid 
Light” to get a different effect, and flick through the others to see 
what effect they have—you can always Ctrl-Z.
7
soften the ImAGe
Next, we’re going to alter the intensity of the softening, but 
in a counter-intuitive way. Select layer 1, head to the “Filter” 
menu, and choose “Sharpen > Unsharp Mask” [Image d]. The 
preview in the “USM” window shows the layer as it was after you 
used “Apply Image,” but check the “Preview” box and you see the 
final effect applied to your full composition. What happens next 
sounds backward, but the more you increase the sharpening effect 
in “Unsharp Mask,” the softer your image becomes. Don’t overdo 
it, because it’s quite possible at this stage to make it look like the 
photo was taken through a steamed-up bathroom window.
8
deAl wIth hIGhlIGhts
Finally, we can take care of those rogue highlights on the 
model’s face. One of Photoshop CC’s cleverest features 
(sorry Elements users) is the ability to run Adobe Camera Raw as 
a filter on any image. Click “Filter > Camera Raw Filter,” and bring 
the “Whites” and “Highlights” sliders to the right, to reduce the 
blown-out look. We also fiddled with “Blacks” and “Clarity” before 
hitting “OK.” 
E

9
CroP In
A good crop can do wonders for an image. This photo 
was taken with a DSLR, but to make our Instagram 
audience think it was taken with a smartphone, we need to 
crop it to 16:9. Select the “Crop” tool (C), and set the aspect 
ratio in the “Options” fields [Image e]. Then drag the crop 
box across the image, deciding where looks best to put 
it. We’re taking the opportunity to place our model’s eye 
and nose on the intersection of two of the crop box’s guide 
lines, which are showing the Rule of Thirds.
10
sAve And shAre
Save your composition as a PSD file to retain the 
layer structure, then select “Layer > Flatten,” 
and save it again as a JPEG, ready to be uploaded to the 
Internet and adored [Image f]. 
F
Photoshop’s Blend Modes determine how the colors and 
brightness of a layer mix with those of the layer below. If a 
layer is set to “Normal Blend Mode” and 100 percent opacity, 
nothing from layers below passes through. Lower the opacity, 
however, and something of what’s underneath starts to 
appear. “Multiply” mode multiplies the RGB values for each 
pixel with those below, resulting in a darker picture, while 
“Screen” does the same with the layers inverted, leading to 
a lighter result. The various “Light” modes and “Overlay” 
combine the two, performing mathematical transformations 
to determine the final color and brightness of each pixel. 
The “Dodge” and “Burn” modes lighten and darken images 
respectively, and are named for darkroom techniques.

A Home-Brewed 
Steam Machine
The mission
There are a few Things that set apart the 
people who game on PCs from the folks who 
use consoles. For one, PC gamers often choose 
keyboards and mice, while console gamers just 
love their controllers (and usually have little choice 
in the matter). A PC can offer a lot more power and 
upgradability, while a console is stuck as-is. The 
biggest thing to note is where people play their 
games: PC gamers play at desks (mostly), while 
consoles rule the living room. That’s what Steam 
machines are looking to change.
There are a few Steam machines available for 
sale already, and surely more to come. But as a 
PC builder, one must ask: Why buy one when you 
can build your own? Some of the prebuilt Steam 
machines out there aren’t too different from 
consoles in that their hardware can’t be changed. 
If you decide to brew your own, the world is your 
oyster when it comes to hardware and cases.
Steam machines also come in two flavors: 
SteamOS and Windows. The Windows machines 
come with Windows and Steam pre-installed, 
and aren’t too different from a normal Windows 
desktop PC. SteamOS, on the other hand, is Valve’s 
Linux-based OS offering. It basically runs Steam 
in Big Picture Mode on top of Debian 8. (Ubuntu, 
Valve’s stated “favorite” Linux distribution, is 
based on Debian.)
We decided to test out Valve’s OS by building 
a Steam machine that would run SteamOS. That 
means no Windows “tax,” and no worrying about 
antivirus software annoying you with popups 
(or scheduled scans) while you’re in-game. We 
couldn’t resist trying it out with our own parts.

Bringing PC power to the living room

shoveling coal
CommerCially available Steam machines tend to be a little 
conservative when it comes to power. The reason is simple: cost. 
As games will probably be running on a 1080p TV, there’s no need to 
splurge in an attempt to chase the 4K gold at the end of the rainbow, 
and there’s less overhead from the OS and other applications.
We chose many of the same components as we had in the 
Summer 2015 Budget Gamer build we made for our quarterly web 
version of Blueprints. That rig laid the foundation with an Asus Z97I-
Plus mobo and an Intel Core i5-4590, with 8GB of Corsair Vengeance 
DDR3 RAM. Their new home is a slim SilverStone ML08 mini-ITX 
case. We also used a SilverStone SFX PSU to power the little rig, 
and dug up a Asus GeForce GTX 960 Strix for our video workhorse.
While the Z97 board is a little overkill considering we’re going 
with a locked CPU, it offers plenty of options in the BIOS (as well as 
PWM connectors). The mobo also includes a mini-PCIe Wi-Fi card, 
essential for a rig is designed to run in the living room.
At the time of writing, the Z97I-Plus was hard to find (and 
thus dearer than its original price). If you can’t find it in stock, we 
recommend an H97I or similar H-class board instead of the Z-class 
(unless you plan to pick up a K-model CPU). There are a lot of 
options when it comes to mini-ITX motherboards. And a Skylake-
based system won’t cost you much more than a Haswell one.
if There’s one big goTcha about using M.2 with mini-
ITX, it’s that the mount point is often on the underside of 
the mobo—we felt really stupid when we had everything 
in except the SSD. D’oh! While we’ve established M.2 
SATA SSDs as our preferred form factor (as long as 
prices are on par with 2.5-inch models), the decision to 
go with M.2 in mini-ITX builds really pays off. Mini-ITX 
form factors can be hellish when it comes to airflow. With 
M.2, there’s one less cable to route, and if it is your only 
storage drive, one less power cable. The only problem is 
that M.2 SSDs are topped out at 500GB at time of writing. 
Larger capacity SSDs are still pricey, and 250GB is plenty 
for the slim SteamOS and a decent game library. If the 
need arises, you could add 2.5-inch SSDs or HDDs.
There isn’T a loT of room for CPU coolers in the 
ML08—there’s only about three-quarters of an inch of 
clearance from the top of the cooler to the side panel. 
As we went with a fixed-clock i5-4590, we weren’t too 
worried about the use of a stock cooler. However, if you 
want to go with K-model CPUs, you may want to get a 
better cooler for overclocking. There are few small-
form-factor (SFF) coolers that would be short enough. 
SilverStone’s Argon series is designed to work with the 
ML08. Corsair recently released an SFF closed-loop 
cooler, the Hydro Series H5, but even that could prove 
too thick (at 2.25 inches). If you feel the need for speed in 
this case, keep a close eye on your temps, as you won’t 
have the thermal headroom you might enjoy in a bigger 
case. On the bright side, the side panel has a vent above 
the motherboard, so airflow to the CPU is unobstructed.

becaUse The ml08 is so slim, the video card can’t be mounted 
in the typical position, perpendicular to the motherboard. 
However, you can’t really move the PCIe slot, so  Stone supplied 
a hard ribbon piece that turns the slot at a right angle for you. 
The L-shaped hard ribbon secures in place with a pair of screws, 
so there’s no worry about wobble wreaking havoc on your 
motherboard. The other thing that this piece does is allow for 
the two-bay design. Locating the GPU in a separate bay from the 
CPU and motherboard keeps their heat and cooling separate. 
Warm air from the GPU isn’t pumped over your CPU, and vice 
versa. Cable management is also cleaner, because you don’t 
have to route things around a big video card. USB, audio, and 
power cables are easily routed and plugged in, without concern 
for obstructing the video card.
one Thing ThaT’s hanDy on a case is, well, a handle. It 
makes transportation much easier. The ML087 comes with 
a handle that is attached to the case with four screws, or 
left off if preferred. The cool feature is that the handle can 
be attached to either side of the case, as the side panels 
are symmetrical. This means there is no true “top” or 
“bottom” to the case, though we feel that the “right way up” 
has the video card bay on top. If we could improve on one 
thing in this case, it would be the handle. It’s made of plastic 
that feels strong enough to support the weight of a small 
system, but the  molding isn’t the kindest shape on hands. 
Carrying this thing on the train and across town (yes, we 
tried that) leaves indentations on the fingers, and prompted 
us to switch hands often. This could be fixed by rubberizing 
the grip.

The firsT Thing To noTice about the GTX 960 Strix is that 
it looks so small in its bay. Indeed, we could fit a full-sized 
GPU—such as a GTX 900 series or R9 300 series—in here if we 
wanted. You’d just have to keep an eye out for big aftermarket 
cooling solutions. While there’s room for reference model 
cards, mounting a card sporting three fans wouldn’t work. To 
mount the card, there’s an extra riser piece that inserts into 
the L-shaped PCIe ribbon. It’s easy to miss, and if you don’t 
use it, the card won’t seat into the two slots properly. On the 
other end of the card, a cutout allows for PCIe power cables 
to cross the partition into the video card bay. We recommend 
using ribbon-style cables or individually sheathed cables, as 
rounded sheathing would be ungainly. This bay is also the only 
place to mount a 3.5-inch HDD. If you crave multiple terabytes of 
storage, you need a video card that’s shorter than the 960 Strix.
The ml08 is a slim case. As a result, we need a slim power 
supply. We installed SilverStone’s 500W SFX model, which 
gives our rig more than enough juice. The SX500 is fully 
modular, so we were able to keep cabling to a minimum 
by going with an M.2 SSD. We used flat ribbon cables, as 
opposed to rounded sheathed. While rounded sheathed 
cables help airflow in an ATX case, flat ribbon cables are 
a boon for the small form factor. We folded our cables over 
themselves, and positioned them flat against the side of 
the PSU, keeping them out of the way. There was one more 
gotcha, though: The power supply’s plug isn’t exposed to the 
outside of the case. This means there’s no way to externally 
switch the PSU on or off, so before you close up the case, be 
sure to switch it on.

bUilDing This liTTle rig was a blast, and 
went by much faster than other small form 
factor builds we’ve worked on. Installing the 
SteamOS is easy as well, as long as you look 
out for a couple of things. 
First of all, you need to set the Secure Boot 
option to “Other OS” in the BIOS. SteamOS 
and most other Linux distributions aren’t 
able to supply certificates to motherboard 
vendors. Without a signed certificate, the BIOS 
will refuse to boot the OS unless you disable 
Secure Boot.
When we tried the automatic installation 
for SteamOS, the installer couldn’t partition 
the SSD, for whatever reason. When we tried 
the “advanced” installation (it really isn’t 
that advanced, as Linux installations go), 
everything worked just fine.
There’s a dark side to playing games on 
Linux. The vast majority of games available 
on Steam are for Windows and use DirectX. 
Of the games for SteamOS and Linux, only a 
few are developed with Linux in mind, or use 
OpenGL as their native API. Thus, many games 
that are ported have to translate DirectX 
instructions to OpenGL equivalents somehow. 
That translation, coupled with slightly lower 
performance of Linux drivers for GPUs, can 
amount to big performance hits.
At every turn, the better components in 
this build spanked the little Alienware Steam 
Machine. When we compared these results 
to the Windows-based Alienware Alpha, the 
margins seemed to thin out. The frame rate 
in Bioshock: Infinite was actually lower than 
what the Alpha pulled off with its 860M. 
SteamOS is still in its infancy. The number 
of titles available to SteamOS will increase, 
as will support for Linux if the OS starts to 
gain steam, so to speak. For now, building a 
SteamOS box is a fun experiment, but don’t 
expect it to replace your desktop rig just yet.

This mounting 
bracket and 
area allows for the 
addition of a slim 
DvD or blu-ray drive. 
adding such a drive 
isn’t necessary for a 
steam machine, 
though it would be 
nice if steamos 
would allow the 
playing of DvDs.

The main 
mounting 
points for storage  
is a pair of 2.5-inch 
brackets for ssDs or 
laptop hDDs. by 
going with an m.2

empty, though using 
a pair of hDDs in

bad idea for backing

MAR 2016

You can almost picture the scene: the 
Dark Lords of Technology showing off 
their wares, urging Asus to join the forces 
of Maxwell and Skylake to rule the mobile 
gaming universe. Unlike in the movies, 
though, Asus takes the bait and delivers its 
updated G752VT notebook. Unfortunately, 
while impressive on many levels, you still 
have to watch out for that exhaust port 
weakness (which Asus oddly tries to cover 
with a couple of rubber grommets).
Asus routinely offers true gaming 
notebooks—and by “true” we mean they go 
with the fastest graphics cards available, 
not lower-tier parts with names that belie 
their performance (we’re looking at you, 
GTX 950M/960M). Having been a player 
in this arena for so long, you’d expect the 
well-oiled Asus machinery to crank out 
improvements every year. That was the 
goal with the G752, and it mostly succeeds.
Any Sith Lord would be proud to carry 
this weapon into battle, with its aggressive 
lines and red/orange accents. Despite the 
flashy looks, the notebook doesn’t attract 
unwanted attention in the way of noise, 
even during extended gaming sessions. 
The fans stay under 36dB, with thermals 
mostly below 35 C, though the exhaust 
area can reach a warm 45 C under load. 
Elsewhere, the gesture-enabled touchpad 
still offers two discrete buttons, and the 
keyboard supports 30-key rollover anti-
ghosting technology—so unless you grow 
several extra appendages, or manage to

seat more than three people around the 
keyboard, you’ll never miss a keystroke. 
You Are Not A Jedi Yet
The G752VT-DH72 model here pairs a GTX 
970M 3GB with a Skylake CPU, tossing in an 
M.2 NVMe drive for good measure. Except 
Asus forgot the batteries for its lightsaber 
and neglected to install the Samsung 
NVMe drivers. Oops! With the drivers 
installed, the SM951 NVMe zips along with 
peak read speeds of 2GB/s, but we have to 
dock points for going with a puny 128GB 
model. It’s 2016; can’t we expect 256GB 
SSDs as standard on a notebook costing 
over $1,000? 128GB means juggling files 
between the SSD and HDD, and while Asus 
offers larger SSDs on other G752 models, 
you’ll pay much more for the privilege.
Outside of the SSD misstep, the G752VT 
performs admirably. It’s not going to match 
a GTX 980M, let alone the beefy GTX 980 for 
Notebooks, but it will handle pretty much 
any game at the native 1920x1080 resolution 
at high to ultra settings. Compared to our 
aging zero-point notebook, the 970M runs 
circles around it and delivers up to three 
times the gaming performance. Even 
better, the IPS G-Sync display works at up 
to 75Hz, so even titles that don’t hit 60fps 
will feel smooth at 40–75fps.
The notebook stumbles elsewhere, 
though. Depending on the application, 
the i7-6700HQ is either slightly faster or 
slightly slower than the ZP’s i7-4700MQ. 
Meanwhile, supporting G-Sync means Asus 
can’t use Nvidia’s Optimus technology, and 
unlike the MSI GT72S (see Holiday 2015, 
page 76), the 970M is always enabled. 
Despite a 66Wh six-cell battery, the G752 
checks out at 2.35 hours—MSI’s GT72S can 
double its runtime by disabling the dGPU.

insignificant compared to the power of a 
balanced platform. The GTX 970M remains 
potent, it’s a far more affordable option, 
and G-Sync is arguably more useful on 
a notebook that can’t routinely hit 75fps. 
Some of the extras increase the price, 
however, and we still want a 256GB SSD 
(that model costs $2,000), but provided 
you’re OK with the lackluster battery life, 
there are no show-stoppers. Those who

Good hardware held back by 
mediocre software
Alienware 
Steam Machine
Linux currently has 
access to roughly 
one-fifth of the 
Steam library. 
We’ve been looking forWard to Valve’s 
Steam Machine initiative for a long time, 
mostly because Valve has never failed us 
in the past. Well, there’s a first time for 
everything, and we have to acknowledge 
that the company has made a misstep here. 
At the frontlines of the initiative is 
Alienware’s little 2.1x7.8x7.8-inch box. If 
the system looks familiar, it’s because it’s 
largely the same small PC as Alienware’s 
Alpha system we’ve reviewed before. It’s 
still super sexy, portable, and has the same 
ports. The biggest difference is that the 
Steam Machine version uses Linux (with 
Steam’s Big Picture Mode overlay on top) 
instead of Windows. Also, instead of coming 
with an Xbox controller, the Steam Machine 
comes with Valve’s new Steam Controller, 
which has a steep learning curve, but lets 
you play every game on Steam, and enables 
you to easily navigate Valve’s 10-foot UI. 
Our particular Steam Machine is running 
the same mobile graphics card that its 
Alienware 
Alpha 
counterpart 
uses—
essentially a variant of Nvidia’s 860M GPU. 
The system does offer some much-needed

enhancements, which include Intel’s 3GHz

and a 7,200rpm hard drive. Conversely, our 
Alpha came with an i3 processor, 4GB of 
RAM, and a 5,200rpm HDD.
Despite the beefier hardware, the 
Steam Machine, with Linux, performed 
much worse in our gameplay benchmarks 
compared to the Alpha. There aren’t that 
many Linux games with benchmarks, 
but we tried BioShock Infinite, The Talos 
Principle, and Shadow of Mordor, and all 
of them ran 20–30 percent worse than the 
Alpha, which is troubling, considering the 
Alpha is only a little more powerful than 
current-gen consoles. Playing a popular 
game such as Ark: Survival Evolved was 
damned near impossible at anything but 
the lowest settings, and then it looked like 
crap. To be fair, Ark is still in Early Access, 
and the game will likely be better optimized 
over time. Still, don’t expect to run intensive 
games above medium settings. Only in 
Valve’s Half-Life 2: Lost Coast benchmark, 
which uses the non-taxing Source engine, 
were the two systems comparable. This

also missing games outside of Steam, such 
as titles on Battle.net and Origin. It makes 
more sense to bite the $100 bullet and buy 
Alienware’s equivalent Windows box. 
The Steam Machine has other issues, 
too. For some reason, some cloud saves 
didn’t carry over on certain titles, and 
there are no native video streaming apps, 
such as Netflix, Hulu, or YouTube. People 
use their consoles for more than just 
gaming. Luckily, there is a browser built 
into Steam, so you can launch Netflix from 
there, but this solution isn’t very elegant. 
What’s more, the Steam Controller doesn’t 
support a headphone jack, so you can’t 
issue voice commands to search for things, 
as you can on the Xbox One or Nvidia Shield. 
The Steam Machine doesn’t have an analog 
mic port either, so you have to use a USB 
headset to chat with friends online. 
We’re not sure who this is for. The key 
market seems to be PC gamers who won’t 
install Windows, but how many of those 
exist? As we like the hardware, we suggest 
going with the Alienware Alpha box with 
Windows instead, as Alienware has made 
improvements to the UI, and it works well 
with the Steam Controller. For $100 more, 
the extra performance and access to every 
Windows game is worth it. –Jimmy Thang
suggests that the other games weren’t well 
optimized for Linux. 
GaminG by numbers
Perhaps worse than the unoptimized ports, 
however, is the lack of games compared to 
Windows offerings. While Valve has done 
a very commendable job of increasing the 
number of games we get on Linux, with a 
total library of 3,389 at the moment, that’s 
still only about 22 percent of titles that are 
available on Windows. Even Mac OS boasts a 
greater library, with its 5,602 games, which 
is disconcerting because we would never 
recommend a Mac for gaming. While there 
are some high-quality games on Linux, 
and we’re sure more will follow, a lot of 
the big publishers haven’t brought their big 
guns to Steam so far. For instance, there’s 
no Fallout 4, GTA V, or Call of Duty: Black 
Ops 3. You could use the Steam Machine as 
a streaming box from a Windows PC, but 
unless you’re using a wired connection, 
you’re going to experience the same Wi-
Fi latency issues as Valve’s hit-and-miss 
Steam Link. And going with Linux, you’re

Whether you’re after a multi-colored, 
über-ergonomic trigger stomper, or just 
a simple minimalistic mouse, finding 
the right one is always a challenge. The 
problem lies in the shape and form of 
your hand. Whether you’re a palm, claw, 
or fingertip user, each one has different 
requirements, 
and 
each 
is 
usually 
associated with smaller or larger hands. 
Which means that every mouse is designed 
to take advantage of these styles. Take the 
Xornet II by Cooler Master, for example. 
It’s ridiculously tiny—it may as well be 
designed for Ewoks—but that doesn’t 
stop it being a good mouse for those 
select few. Corsair, on the other hand, has 
always managed to impress us with the 
accommodating nature of its mice. Time 
after time, it's produced precision pointers 
that cater to a wider range of hand shapes, 
sizes, and styles of play than any other. So 
does the Scimitar follow suit?  
At its heart is a Pixart Technologies 
ADNS-3988 12,000 dpi monster of an 
optical sensor. On top of that, it features 
a 1ms response time, 17 buttons, and no 
fewer than four full 16.8-million-color RGB 
lighting zones. All of which you can control 
and tweak in Corsair’s well-constructed 
Utility Engine software.
So how does it feel? Well, if you’re 
a palm grip mouse wielder, it’s very 
comfortable. With the palm of your hand 
resting gently over the Corsair logo, 
you have more than enough friction and 
ergonomic security to ensure you can 
easily glide this mouse elegantly across 
your gaming surface. You’re certainly 
not in any danger of hammering those 
12 dedicated switches littered over the 
left-hand side of the mouse. The same 
Maniacal multi-button mayhem
can’t be said if you’re a fan of the fingertip 
grip, though. As your fingers naturally 
rest on the sides of the mouse for grip, 
you may have a habit of placing too much 
pressure down, and activating any of the 
12 cooldowns and abilities you have bound 
into those mighty mechanical menaces. 
That said, the amount of pressure required 
to activate any of those aforementioned 
abilities is considerable, and it depends on 
how strong your grip is. Our advice? Check 
it out in store first if you’re concerned. 
Many buttons, Much use
But the real question is, are those buttons 
worth it? We decided to put the Scimitar 
through its paces in a variety of online 
MMOs, and it seems to be a very game-
dependent thing. In games such as World 
of Warcraft, it excels at being that go-to 
emergency button for cooldowns, potions, 
interrupts, and other useful abilities. 
Swapping over your entire rotation to it, 
on the other hand, although possible, 
takes a fair while to adjust to. Where this 
mouse does shine, however, is when used 
in conjunction with games such as Star 
Citizen. Certainly, if you’re piloting your 
ships with a keyboard and mouse, having 
the ability to manage your shields on the 
fly, without having to scramble over to the 
numpad, is a lifesaver. Cycling through 
countermeasures, deploying flares, and 
switching between targets all becomes a 
hell of a lot easier with the added support 
of those additional buttons.
Overall, the look and feel of this mouse is 
gorgeous. Although the grip for your pinky 
and right finger can be a little abrasive, the 
soft-touch finish covering the rest of the 
mouse is stunning and very thick. Overall, 
the LED lighting zones are great for color 
matching your setup. However, the biggest 
downside has to be the yellow accent 
incorporated into the design. Why oh why, 
Corsair, did you not make it white or black, 
or available in other colors? 
But, alas, we must conclude this review. 
Corsair’s Scimitar is precise, comfortable, 
and adaptable, depending on your hand 
style. Although we do have concerns for 
claw and fingertip lovers, overall the build 
quality and feel of Corsair’s latest MMO 
and MOBA dominator is phenomenal. 
Just hurry up and make a fully black one 
already, Corsair. –ZaK Storey

Competent virtual reality on the go

If you have a compatible Samsung 
phone, you have to get this.

MAXIMUMPC

MAR 2016

We’ve been dreaming about virtual reality 
for years, but up until now, those dreams 
have been pretty well unfulfilled. While 
we’ll have to wait a bit for the release of the 
crème de la crème of modern VR—Oculus 
Rift and HTC Vive—you can get a good taste 
of it now with Samsung’s Gear VR. 
Made in partnership with Oculus VR, the 
Gear VR is a headset attachment for modern 
Samsung phones, with support for the Note 
5 and S6 series devices. We tested ours 
with Samsung’s S6 Edge. While the headset 
is made mostly of plastic, inside are optics 
that magnify and refocus your eyes on your 
phone’s screen. The phone locks into place 
via a micro-USB connector, and there’s 
some foam padding around the face plate. 
The Gear VR also has an IPD adjuster, to 
accommodate varying pupil distances, and 
a volume rocker. You secure the headset 
via a horizontal strap that wraps round the 
back of your head, and there’s an optional 
strap that goes straight down the top-
middle of your head. Once you lock your 
phone in place, it automatically engages VR 
mode, and you can navigate menus using 
the headset’s physical back button and 
four-way directional touchpad on the right. 
But perhaps the niftiest feature of the Gear 
VR is that it retails for $100.
What does the Gear VR feel like? Inside 
the headset, you have access to roughly an 
80–90 degree field of view. Within this view, 
you can look around with the help of the 
headset’s accelerometer and gyroscope. 
Tracking is pretty much 1:1. When VR 
experiences are done well, the headset is 
able to trick your brain into believing that 
your body is somewhere it is not. Of course, 
the experience isn’t perfect. With the S6 
Edge’s 1440x2560 screen, the “screen 
door effect” wasn’t bad, but you can still 
make out some of the pixels if you try. Also, 
sometimes the headset will be disoriented 
and the view will go off-axis, but by holding 
down the back button, you can bring up the 
menu to reorient the screen to the direction 
in which you’re looking. 
We were pleasantly surprised by how 
many apps there were at launch. There’s 
a wide variety of content, ranging from 
games to movies and beyond, and a lot 
of it is free. In terms of games, most of 
them have you using your head to look 
at targets in a shooting gallery. This can 
quickly start to feel shallow and tiring. 
Because Gear VR is running on Android, 
it inherits the platform’s cheap-quality 
games. And because it’s running off a 
phone, don’t expect Crysis-level graphics. 
There are some fun VR games at the 
moment, however. Land’s End makes you 
feel as though you’re a floating wizard in a 
fantastical land, trying to solve puzzles. In 
Omega Agent, you feel like you’re floating 
through a city using a jetpack. There’s also 
an arcade app that, as the name implies, 
throws you into a virtual arcade, and 
enables you to play old-school games.
Presence and correct
Even if you aren’t interested in games, the 
Gear VR has a bunch of other experiences 
to sift through. There is a ton of 360-degree 
photos and videos to view, and you can 
even watch 2D movies in a 3D environment. 
There’s essentially a movie theater app that 
enables you to watch any movie you have on 
your phone in various three-dimensionally 
fleshed-out environments. Netflix also has 
a VR app that enables you to watch your 
favorite content in a virtual cozy cabin. 
Virtual tourism is another big component 
of Gear VR, and there’s a healthy number of 
experiences that take you scuba diving with 
sharks or ringside at a fight. Surprisingly 
enough, perhaps the most compelling 
aspect of Gear VR is the social app. Here, 
you choose an avatar and can sit in a virtual 
theater, and watch live Twitch streams or 
online videos with strangers from across 
the globe. There is a certain sense of 
“presence” there.
That’s not to say that the Gear VR is 
without flaws, however. The biggest issue 
here is motion sickness. It’s better than 
the Oculus Rift development kit 2, but if the 
experience isn’t well optimized, chances 
are you’re going to get a little dizzy; your 
mileage will vary, of course. We suspect 
that its 60Hz refresh rate has something to 
do with it, as Oculus has stated in the past 
that 90Hz and above is what’s comfortable 
for most people. Gear VR does try to 
mitigate this issue by providing comfort 
ratings for each app. Other issues: The 
Gear VR quickly drains the phone’s battery, 
and tends to overheat the device. While 
you can’t do much about the heat, you can 
charge the device while using it. The screen 
also tended to fog up when we had it on a 
little too tight, and we encountered several 
audio incompatibilities using a Bluetooth 
headset. To top it off, the Gear VR can be a 
bit heavy after extended use, even though 
the headset itself only weighs 0.62 pounds. 
Add to that the weight of the phone, coupled 
with experiences that force you to look up 
constantly, and it can cause fatigue. 
Despite these problems, however, if you 
have a capable Samsung phone, getting the 
Gear VR is a no-brainer at $100. There’s 
a decent amount of content already, and 
we’re confident it will only continue to 
increase. The big question is whether 
people who are currently content with 
their non-Samsung smartphones should 
jump aboard. Unless you’re a die-hard VR 
enthusiast, we suggest holding off until gen 
two. Hopefully, by then, it will have a faster 
refresh rate, wider FOV, and perhaps some 
integrated speakers. This additional time 
will also allow the Oculus store to make 
some UI improvements and bolster its 
library. If you have a compatible phone and 
are at all interested in VR, though, gear up 
for a good time! –Jimmy Thang

Let’s cut to the point. Piecing together 
a small form factor build is always going 
to be a nightmare. If you’ve had any 
experience working in those tiny, cramped 
spaces, you’ll know that getting every inch 
of extra leverage is vital. Couple that with 
an incredibly limited number of potential 
cooling options, and you’re well on the 
way to shredded fingers, busted egos, and 
general frustration when trying to beef up 
and perfect your small slice of ITX heaven. 
Let’s give you a hypothetical scenario to 
add a little clarity to the situation. You’re 
a well-rounded teenager, and you’ve been 
saving up for a year now to build your very 
own ITX chassis ready for university. You 
don’t know exactly how much space you’re 
going to have, and being a true PC gamer, 
to hell are you using a laptop. You price 
up a build: Intel Core i5-6600K, 8GB of 
DDR4, Nvidia GTX 960, all in your favorite 
case, an In-Win 901 Mini-ITX chassis. After 
all, what’s a better conversation starter 
than that beautiful piece of aluminum 
craftsmanship? There’s just one problem: 
It only supports one 92mm fan in the rear, 
and another 120mm fan in the front. So 
what’s the solution? Stick with a retail 
cooler, or head for a low-profile option 
instead, most of which have a habit of 
throttling your overall CPU performance?
Corsair to the resCue

launched its first iteration of the Hydro H5

bunch… or so we thought. We ran a set of 
four benchmarks, under four separate 
conditions—100 percent fan speed, 60 
percent fan speed, stock frequency, and 
overclocked to 4.6GHz—and in every 
scenario but one, the Hydro H5 SF came 
out on top, with an average of two degrees 
difference between the titans. Admittedly, 
two degrees doesn’t sound like a lot, but 
when you couple that with the fact that 
the C14S is 31mm taller, and features a 
fully configured 140mm fan to boot, those 
figures speak for themselves.
Ultimately, both of these coolers are 
impressive feats of engineering. Noctua 
has long been renowned for its cooling and 
noise optimizing prowess. Yet for once, the 
king of the hill has been unseated, with 
Corsair rightfully taking its place as the 
ITX chilling champion. The Hydro H5 SF 
is an incredibly innovative feat of water-
cooling design—packing so much thermal 
regulating potential into such a small form 
factor is astounding. Couple that with a lack 
of beige, a sleek black style, and a price 
tag $5 less than the NH-C14S, and, well, 
there’s nothing left to say. –Zak storey

SF, a small form factor, all-in-one liquid 
cooler. Based loosely on the design of the 
Hydro H100i, this CPU chilling marvel 
features a single 120mm fan, in a setup 
that quite closely resembles the likes of 
traditional blower graphics cards. Once 
installed, the fan faces toward your CPU 
block, sucking cool air from around your 
motherboard into an innovatively designed 
shroud and radiator combo. It then pushes 
this hot air sideways, straight out of the 
back of your chassis. What’s impressive is 
that it manages it all while retaining a snug 
84mm of clearance.
Mounting the H5 SF is a simple affair—
if you’ve had any experience with AIOs, 
you’ll be used to the backplate and screws 
mechanism found on most of the closed 
loop coolers out there. The only noticeable 
difference is a step back to the original 
H100i’s CPU block, with its magnetic 
securing bracket situated on top of the CPU 
block. Once you’ve mounted the heatsink to 
your CPU, it’s just a case of installing the 
proprietary support bracket, then securing 
the radiator portion of this AIO to that. It’s 
advisable to do this second to last, as you’ll 
have little room to maneuver once it’s in 
place, but you’ll still have plenty of space to 
slot in your GPU.
However, the biggest shocker with this 
bad boy is the performance. We tested 
the H5 SF against one of our favorites, 
Noctua’s NH-C14S. As far as low-profile 
coolers go, the C14S is the baddest of the

Best scores are in bold. All benchmarks performed with an Intel Core i7-6700K, 16GB 
DDR4 2400, GeForce GTX 980, a Samsung 850 Evo 500GB, and a Samsung 850 Pro 2TB. 
There’s an old adage floating around 
the Internet that goes a little like this: 
“Performance motherboards don’t exist.” 
We’ll be the first to admit that over the 
last few years this has held true. If you 
take a wander down memory lane, back 
to the P67 and Z77 chipsets, they seemed 
to lack anything in regard to differential 
performance gains for the average Joe. 
After all, the vast majority of us lack the 
ability to swap out 25 CPUs in the search 
to find the perfectly binned high-end CPU.
Fast-forward to 2016, and a fair chunk 
of this has changed. With M.2 and U.2, 
premium on-board audio, water cooling 
options, and a variety of game-changing 
voltage regulation, thanks to the removal of 
the FIVR from Skylake’s chip design, we’re 
at last graced with a modicum of variance 
when it comes to mobo performance.
That’s all well and good, but if you’re 
looking to build a budget-specced gaming 
machine, the idea of dropping $300-plus 
on a motherboard just for a few extra hertz 
here and there isn’t appealing. Enter MSI 
and its Z170A Tomahawk. This aggressively 
priced Z170 motherboard provides just 
enough wallop and features to sate any 
gamer. Couple that with a snazzy new red, 
black, and white color scheme, and we’re 
on to a winner.
So what does $150 buy you? Well, you 
get the usual Z170 features: up to 64GB 
of DDR4 memory, support for the latest 
Skylake CPUs, plenty of SATA and USB 
support, plus the additional PCIe lanes 
Best of the budget boards?
for 
more 
advanced 
storage 
solutions. Speaking of which, 
there are two M.2 slots, six SATA 
6GB/s ports, a right-angled USB 
3.0 header, and fully separated 
audio componentry to reduce any 
noise generated by all that power-
hungry hardware you’re about to 
throw into your new build.
An Ax to grind?
For the price, you do lose out on a 
smidgen of memory bandwidth, 
and on top of that you suffer 
with a lower overclock potential, too. 
We maxed our chip out at 4.8GHz. However, 
if you’re not interested in any of that crazy 
CPU-boosting power, and are just after 
a good quality gaming motherboard, the 
Tomahawk will serve you admirably. As 
you’d expect, there’s no performance 
improvement in-game. We registered a 
clean sweep of 27fps average in Shadow 
of Mordor at 4K. The same as every other 
motherboard we’ve tested with this config.
Sounds like an ideal motherboard then? 
Well, mostly—for the money, you get a 
dependable, well-rounded backbone for 
your system. But, as always, there are 
negatives. The cutbacks necessary to 
include such a hefty feature set at such 
a low price have made an impact on the 
board's strength; there’s way too much 
flex. If you’re running an AIO watercooler, 
it shouldn’t be too much of a problem, but 
if you’re considering an air-cooled tower 
or a dual-GPU setup, you might want to 
reconsider. On top of that, there’s only 
access to five on-board fan headers.
Ultimately, the Tomahawk is a great 
entry-level gaming motherboard. It comes 
with solid performance, a wide variety of 
support for newer storage solutions, and 
performs—for the vast majority of us—just 
as well as any of the more premium boards 
out there. The lack of cooling support and 
thinner PCB are cause for concern, but if 
you’re not throwing excessive amounts of 
hardware on to this bad boy, you’ll be more 
than happy with this choice. –zak sTorey

EvEr SincE 2008, BE QuiEt!’S ethos has 
been about one thing: silence-optimized 
computing. Originally a power supply 
manufacturer, 
the 
German 
company 
rapidly expanded into cooling solutions, 
bringing with it the level of precision for 
which our Germanic cousins are so famed. 
It also provided one particular product 
that rival outfit Noctua failed to deliver 
on until just very recently: black high-
performance fans. Which means it wasn’t 
a huge surprise when Be Quiet! announced 
its first iteration of a sound-dampened PC 
chassis, the Silent Base 800. 
A noise enthusiast’s wet dream, the 
steel chassis houses sound-dampened 
side panels constructed of a plastic 
polymer, as is the bottom. Although these 
are removable, it’s advisable to take a 
quick dive into the instruction manual, 
because it’s not as intuitive as we would 
expect with modern cases. The interior 
layout touts some solid modularity—the 
included 5.25-inch bay cannot be removed, 
but the two 3.5-inch drive cages located 
below that can be. You’ll lose out on a 
considerable amount of additional storage 
space by doing this, but it allows the two 
included Be Quiet! Pure Wings 140mm 
fans to really take advantage of that extra 
room, leveraging some impressive airflow 
throughout your system. Once you remove 
the rear panel, you’re greeted with ample 
cable management space, with the back 
of the motherboard tray also housing two 
2.5-inch drives.
As for cooling, well, if water-cooling is 
your game, the Silent Base has room for 
a 240mm or 280mm radiator in the roof 
and the front of the chassis, with plenty 
of space for push-pull. And if that’s not 
enough, you could always throw another 
120mm rad in the rear as well.
Tough CompeTiTion
There’s no doubt at this point, then, that 
the Silent Base 800 is a competitive 
Fantastic noise 
canceling, but could do 
with more modularity
chassis. However, in an incredibly loud 
market, we’re just not sure whether this 
Germanic case can create enough uproar 
to be heard over many of the other silence-
optimized gaming cases available. In 
particular, we’re talking about Fractal 
Design and its Define R5. We’ll admit, it’s a 
favorite of ours, and being one of the most 
recognizable silence-optimized brands on 
the market today, the Silent Base has a lot 
of ground to make up.
Although definitely a contender, the 800 
doesn’t quite make it. The build quality of 
the panels, although featuring a soft-touch 
finish, similar to that introduced by Bitfenix 
way back when, still harbors a plastic 
construction and feel, leaving the strength 
of those panels somewhat wanting. 
The modular capacity found within the 
interior can feel a little constricting, and 
it simply doesn’t feel like a fully flexible 
ATX chassis. All that aside, the addition of 
rubber mounting on all of the hard drive 
bays, and the inclusion of the premium Be 
Quiet! fans, is definitely a plus. What would 
have been impressive was if Be Quiet! had 
included an integrated fan hub to help 
control the vast array of cooling options 
you have at your disposal.
Ultimately, the Silent Base 800 is 
deafeningly quiet, and it’s certainly a good 
option for those wanting something with a 
little more flair than Fractal’s Define R5. 
That said, it simply feels too rigid for our 
liking. There’s not enough customization 
internally, and the inclusion of such a large 
5.25-inch drive bay in this day and age 
makes little to no sense in a case that’s 
supposed to be optimized around silence.

Audio is one of the most important 
ingredients 
for 
a 
stunning 
gaming 
experience. It’s also very easy to ruin. 
As PC enthusiasts, we are well aware 
of this. We know that it depends on the 
quality of the drivers, the sophistication 
of the components, and the condition of 
the equalizers running at the heart of 
your high-frequency, vibrating canisters. 
So when a company such as Turtle Beach 
comes up to us, ready to share its latest 
headset, it would be remiss of us not to say 
we were concerned. After all, what could 
a company that specializes in consoles 
be able to offer? Regardless, we pushed 
our preconceived prejudices aside, and 
decided to give it a chance. And, boy, was 
that a good decision!
The Ear Force Stealth 450 is a set of 
wireless, 7.1 surround sound gaming 
headphones. It embraces a set of 50mm 
neodymium magnetic drivers, with a 
frequency response ranging from 20Hz 
all the way up to 20KHz, and includes a 
detachable omni-directional mic. Not too 
shabby a feature set for $130.
As far as audio reproduction goes, 
the Stealth 450 headphones are clean 
and crisp. Amazingly, Turtle Beach has 
managed the impossible for a gaming 
headset: The bass is where you’d expect 
it—there’s a lot of it, in other words—but 
the clarity of the treble and mids hasn't 
been lost. This means you get a remarkable 
listening 
experience. 
Seriously—these 
headphones deliver earfuls of joy. 
On top of all that audio goodness, Turtle 
Beach has thrown in some nifty software 
features to help you get even more out of 
your headset. There are four different EQ 
presets embedded into the headset: bass 
boost, bass and treble boost, vocal boost, 
or natural sound. Honestly, though, if 
you’re after a really enjoyable listening 
experience, just throw the bass and treble 
Stunning audio—but 
it comes at a cost
boost on, and leave it there. There’s also a 
handy little digital voiceover for whenever 
you switch on the headset, to inform you 
about which preset you’re in, whether the 
mic is muted, and also to alert you if the 
headset is about to turn itself off.
Not for big-heads
The biggest problem with the Stealth 450 
comes down to its fit and form. It’s a tiny bit 
on the small side. And although it fits fine 
around those with an average cranium, 
anyone with a larger skull may have 
problems. Another concern is the size and 
shape of the ear cups themselves. Instead 
of the traditional circular style, they’re 
actually oval in design. Again, if you’ve 
got small ears, then great—otherwise, 
you might be forced to endure this as on-
ear headphones instead. Fortunately, the 
headset is quite flexible, and with a bit of 
force, you can set it to the right size if it is 
a little tight. The ear cups, though? Well, 
no, you’re stuck with those. Other than 
that, the padding is comfortable, the fabric 
could be a little softer, but overall, thanks 
to the plastic frame, it’s incredibly light 
and comfortable, even during those longer 
gaming sessions.
Unfortunately, we did encounter some 
software-related problems. The headset 
doesn’t seem to work particularly well 
alongside Windows 10’s system volume 
mixer. From 1–99, it’s on at 100 percent, 
and when you’re at zero, of course, it’s 
muted. Oddly, this doesn’t extend to games 
or applications. YouTube, Google Chrome, 
and all of our game suite worked just fine. 
And, of course, there is an inline scroll 
wheel on the headset to adjust volume 
manually as well. Still, very odd.
As far as the mic goes, it’s fine—you’ll 
be clear and audible in voice chats. It has 
a tendency to be a little tinny, but it’s more 
than clear enough. The fact it’s removable 
is a nice touch—great if you want to get it 
out of your face when you’re not raiding 
Hellfire Citadel with your buddies.
All in all, it’s a great headset. The sizing 
might not be ideal for everyone, but the 
audio quality is second to none. For this 
price, you’re not going to get much better, 
and from a company that specializes in 
consoles, that’s high praise. –zAk storey

39,225,600 seconds. That’s how long it’s 
taken Corsair to release a new chassis. A 
case that’s no doubt been in development 
far longer than that. But there’s a lot to 
consider. And when you have a reputation 
for case-building as great as Corsair does, 
it’s not difficult to understand why it’s 
taken this long. Constructing a chassis is 
a complex affair—finding exactly the right 
design style, including the perfect feature 
set, and matching the ideal price point is 
always a balancing act.
So this is the 600C, Corsair’s latest 
addition to its Carbide line-up. Generally 
speaking, these are chassis that have 
primarily been optimized for silence, 
making sure the hum of your PC doesn’t 
make its way into your eardrums. Quite a 
shock, then, to see this windowed edition 
make an entrance. Interestingly, it still 
features a lot of the qualities you’d find in 
the windowless variant. The same sound-
dampening material is embedded into the 
front of the chassis, with just a smidge 
more lining the 5.25-inch bay covers. On 
top of that, the feet have a nice 10mm or 
so of rubber on the base, raising the bulk 
of your system three inches off the ground.
Inverted snobbery
But, really, all that’s just waffle compared 
to the most interesting design choice 
taken with this colossus. And that’s the 
interior layout. This is the first Corsair 
case in living memory that features an 
inverted motherboard layout. It’s also 
the first Corsair chassis outside of the 
Carbide Air series that includes a semi-
compartmentalized design. The PSU, 
SSDs, and hard drives are all hidden away 
above and behind the motherboard tray, or 
sneakily disguised, thanks to that snazzy-
looking top PSU cover. 
It’s the inverted layout, though, that’s 
by far the biggest shocker in this new 
Inverted motherboard 
tray, silence optimized:  
What’s not to love?
design. There’s no doubt that this is going 
to make for one hell of an argument on the 
old interweb. We can see it now: sucking in 
hot air to the GPUs, complaining about the 
orientation for graphics card logos, and 
so on. It certainly goes against the norm, 
especially for reference design cards. In 
our opinion, however, it’s arguably a far 
more innovative and interesting design 
style than the standard ATX variants we 
usually see. It helps to separate the Corsair 
600C from an overly stagnant market. It’s a 
bold move but, quite honestly, a necessary 
one, because the number of inverted 
windowed cases is very small indeed.
Cooling support is still solid. You do lose 
out on those two additional 120mm fans in 
comparison to, say, the Obsidian 750D, but 
there’s still ample cooling potential to help 
keep your system on ice. If watercooling 
is your game, well that’s another kettle of 
fish entirely. It is possible to install up to 
a 360mm rad in the bottom, a 140mm rad 
in the rear, and a 280mm rad in the front—
however, if you’re looking to mount your 
reservoir traditionally to the right (or in 
this case, left) of the motherboard, you’re 
seriously going to struggle. Your best bet 
would be to take advantage of that hidden 
front drive cover, and use a 5.25-inch bay 
reservoir pump combo instead, but even 
that might be a bit too risky, and you’d be 
giving up possibly both of your 3.5-inch 
drive bays in the process.
Ultimately, this case is a stunning 
example of what can be done with an 
inverted layout. The PSU cover is a 
fantastic addition, and although it’s pretty 
limited for custom loop watercooling, this 
case is ideal for those looking for a hassle-
free and easy build. The only downside we 
can see beyond that is the lack of storage 
options. But honestly? How many do you 
really need? –ZAK sToReY

Mr Boombastic returns to put the “rad” in paradise
Just Cause 3
Fun is a Funny thing. Videogames should 
be fun, so to approach them expecting to be 
entertained is perfectly reasonable. Just 
Cause 3 knows this, and the first thing you 
do is surf a plane while shooting stuff with 
a rocket launcher. 
Actually, no. The first thing you do is 
wait while protagonist Rico sits on a beach 
doing nothing—presumably it’s a loading 
screen—then wait until the game logs in 
to Square Enix’s servers, then sit through 
another more explicit loading screen (one 
minute 23 seconds in total for us; happily, 
in-game restarts and checkpoints are 
quicker). Only then, accompanied by a 
lounge version of the Prodigy’s Firestarter, 
do the explosions begin.
And when it does get going, Just 
Cause 3 is a blast. Returning home to the 
Mediterranean island nation of Medici (a 
sunny, rural place, with blue skies, beautiful 
seas, and dry fields, where farmers drive 
tractors up and down with no agricultural 
equipment on the back, while growing vast 
quantities of flowers), Rico Rodriguez finds 
Sebastiano Di Ravello in charge. Di Ravello 
is a dictator with a troubling habit of building 
large, self-aggrandizing structures to rival 
Donald Trump. Meanwhile, the ragged 
rebellion started by Rico’s friend Mario is 
failing to liberate one single town. We’re told 
that life would be better under the rebels’ 
regime, although there’s no evidence for 
this, and the idea of returning towns "to the 
people" sounds a bit commie to us.
If Rico goes into a settlement, blows 
some stuff up, lets the ramshackle rebels 
into the police station, and runs a flag up, 
it falls under rebel control. You can do 
this to military bases, too, against stiffer 
opposition and with more interesting 
structures to climb and destroy. Doing this 
unlocks weapons and, more importantly, 
challenges, which earn you "Gears," 
which you use for weapon and vehicle 
customization 
of 
the 
nitrous-boosted 
helicopter and explosive shotgun type. 
On top of this, there’s a mission structure 
that sees Rico take down Di Ravello, who 
wants to take over the world with the help 
of the magnetic, explosive, and apparently 
forcefield-generating mineral Bavarium, 
Work has gone into the explosions, 
which come in a variety of colors.
which is conveniently only found in Medici, 
and not Bavaria, as you’d expect.
Nothing is out of reach and nothing feels 
forbidden, as our man leaps around the 
place, his new beard making him look like 
the hypermasculine presenter of World’s 
Deadliest Lawnmower Accidents on a 
channel a long way down the EPG. But when 
you get to the top of that radar emplacement 
(this dictator likes more big dishes than 
Adam Richman), so thoughtfully built on the 
bluffs near the coast, what’s up there? Not 
much. We liberated one such island fortress 
and considered taking the helicopter parked 
at the top for a joyride on our way to the 
next town, but it vanished while our backs 
were turned. We rebel-dropped (the game’s 
resupply mechanic, which sees a shipping 
container full of goodies fall from the sky at 
your location) another one in, and it arrived 
on fire and unusable. 
This is a bug, but also typical rebel 
behavior. They happily unload their guns 
into innocent walls, ram vehicles together 
at speed, and run Rico over while he’s trying 
to help them, yet remain in awe of him as

them out of moving vehicles or accidentally 
gun down their comrades. For that matter, 
neither do the bad guys, displaying a 
staggering level of nonchalance as you land 
a sniper shot from hundreds of yards away, 
and their buddy’s head explodes. 
PuPPy love
It’s impossible to dislike a game with a 
physics engine that behaves so much 
like an eager-to-please puppy, however. 
Your primary method of getting around 
the islands is the many vehicles scattered 
about, from scooters to armored cars to jet 
fighters. But across shorter distances, the 
returning grappling hook, infinite parachute 
generator, and new wingsuit (think Far Cry 
4) allow significantly faster movement than 
Rico’s sluggish run. 
The grappling hook has had an upgrade: 
A new tethering ability lets you join two 
objects—an explosive barrel and a fuel 
tank, say, or a cow and a tree—then yank 
them together for hilarious results. Who 
cares if the fuel tank sometimes lunges 
toward the significantly smaller barrel as 
though it were welded to the ground? The 
resulting boom is the same. 
Bullets are plentiful and explosives 
infinite, even if heavy weapon ammo can be 
scarce. The grappling hook benefits from a 
degree of auto-aim that guns don’t, but its 
ability to take down an enemy with a rope-
assisted flying kick is ruined by the fact that 
this maneuver often doesn’t kill the target. 
This isn’t a game that rewards stealthy 
tactics—there’s no cover system or ability 
to hide behind low walls—but it does get out 
of your way, allowing you to approach bases 
and missions in whatever way you choose.
The towns and bases are all pretty 
much the same, however, and while doing 
the challenges (races against the clock, 
tests of flying accuracy, and the excellent 
destruction marathons) helps to spice 
things up, the game ultimately lacks depth.
That’s not to say there isn’t a lot of fun to 
be had. Just Cause 3 is best played in small 
chunks, and the save and restart system 
encourages this: Progress autosaves, and 
hitting "Continue" on starting the game finds

Having spent tHe montH surrounded by 
memory of all shapes and sizes, it’s easy to 
forget how much is “normal” these days. A 
state compounded by the fact that the two 
machines I regularly use rock 16GB apiece—
thanks to both systems being built around an 
“enthusiast” processor. Do I actually need so 
much RAM? Probably not, but at least I know 
that any problems I encounter aren’t due to 
a lack of it. It isn’t Dream Machine levels, of 
course, and I’m sure there are many readers 
who scoff at 16GB, but it’s more than enough 
for what I do. 
If there’s one takeaway from this month’s 
memory roundup, it should be that capacity 
is important—as long as you actually use it—
but there’s not much point paying over the 
odds for the extra speed. Today’s processors 
are awash with memory bandwidth as it 
is; you don’t need even more of something 
you’re not using. And let me reiterate—this 
is for normal desktop use. I’m sure there are 
applications that love memory; I just don’t 
happen to use them on a regular basis.
As a certified old fart, I still have SDRAM 
sticks in my desk drawer that can be 
usefully measured in megabytes (hey, they 
might come in useful someday), and my 
first memory upgrades were of the kilobyte 
variety. Which means that I’m still amazed 
by how capacious the latest DIMMs are—
16GB sticks are vaguely affordable for those 
who really need them. Want 128GB in your 
system? Go for it! 
While this is amazing, it’s actually flash 
memory that slackens my jaw the most. 
At a recent press event, we were handling 
128GB microSD cards. That’s right—those 
tiny cards you use in your cellphone and 
Raspberry Pi 2, which are about the same 
size as your fingernail. 200GB cards are 
already available, and 256GB devices are on 
the way. We really do live in amazing times.
...but not as much as manufacturers want you to think

tHe tHing about AA and AAA batteries 
is that they’re so damned ubiquitous. 
Sure, they’re nasty and poisonous when 
they leak acid. Sure, they’re terrible for 
the environment when you dump them in 
the trash. But they make the TV remote 
work, so we have to deal with them. 
Even when you have rechargeable 
AA and AAA batteries, what do you 
have to use to give them some juice? A 
proprietary charger, that’s what.
The Eco USBCell is a pretty basic idea: 
a USB AA and AAA battery. Not a USB 
charger—a USB battery. No kidding. 
Practically every other small electronic 
device or battery can be charged via USB 
these days, so why not these batteries?
The batteries are about as basic as 
you can get: A USB connector is attached 
to the body of an AA battery. For the AAA 
form, there’s a strange-looking half-
connector. The positive cap of the battery 
slides over the USB connector to stay in 
place. The cap has an embedded magnet 
to attach to the butt-end of the battery, 
so you don’t lose it while charging. The 
battery requires a 5V USB port to charge, 
and takes about two hours from empty.
The main downside to the Eco 
USBCell is the power capacity. At 
1,040mAh 
(450mAh 
for 
AAA), 
it’s 
less than half the capacity of an old 
trusty Duracell Coppertop’s 2,850mAh 
(1,150mAh for AAA). On the upside, the 
Eco USBCell is rated for 500 charge and 
discharge cycles. That means that each 
Eco USBCell AA battery is equivalent to 
182 Coppertops. Not bad for a battery 
that costs $20 for a pack of four (as 
opposed to $783 for 182 packs of four 
Coppertops).
And, of course, it’s way better than 
having a drawer full of questionable or 
dead batteries. –aC

Kodi
Putting 
together 
the 
ultimate HTPC for your 
entertainment 
needs 
is only step one; step 
two is finding the right 
software for it. One of the most flexible and 
potent pieces of HTPC software around 
is Kodi, formerly known as XMBC. What’s 
in a name? Plenty, and the reason for the 
renaming is pretty simple, because the 
XBMC (originally Xbox Media Center) has 
long since moved beyond the confines of 
the Xbox ecosystem. The software is now 
available for Windows, Linux, OS X, Android, 
and other platforms.
Kodi is a great piece of software that 
has a host of features, including support 
for most video, audio, and picture formats. 
It can be used to watch and record live TV 
(with the appropriate tuner hardware), and 
it’s highly customizable. That’s perhaps the 
most potent aspect of Kodi: the add-ons.
Anything you might want to do with your 
HTPC software is likely useful to others as 
well, so there are tons of official add-ons 
already available. If you need more, add 
SuperRepo (http://srp.nu) as a source, and 
you quickly gain access to even more options. 
TV, radio, weather, games, and more are all 
available at the touch of a button, and the  
10-foot UI is great for browsing from your 
sofa. Best of all, it’s free and open source.
f.lux
I’ll admit, I’m one of 
the 
youngbloods 
at 
Maximum PC. Many a 
joke goes around the 
office when someone 
makes a reference to an event that 
happened before the 1990s. But that’s put 
me in a unique position. I barely remember 
life before the Internet. From the age of six, 
I was hooked—online and gaming on PCs. 
Late into the night, I’d play on those old CRT 
monitors, throwing hours of my life into 
WoW and the Total War franchise, and every 
night I’d struggle to sleep, thanks to that 
blue light etched into my skull.
It’s only since I’ve gotten older that I’ve 
become aware of how much of a nuisance 
this is. Working late into the night, and 
being permanently parked in front of a 
screen, isn’t good for your eyes. However, 
a neat little program called f.lux attempts 
to resolve these problems. Essentially, it 
pays attention to what time of day it is. When 
the sun starts setting, it begins to calibrate 
your monitor accordingly, reducing the 
level of blue light, and giving your monitor 
a nice, warm glow. It does this smoothly 
over the course of a few hours. Admittedly, 
it’s not ideal for designers who rely on color 
accuracy, but for those of us—tech journos 
in particular—who often work late into the 
night, it’s a lifesaver.

WE TACKLE TOUGH READER QUESTIONS ON...
SSD Booting
I want to upgrade my boot 
drive to an SSD drive. In the 
past, I have just installed an 
HDD and loaded an OS on it. 
Can I do the same with an 
SSD or are there some other 
steps that need to be done 
before loading the OS on to 
one? Also, while shopping for 
cables, I have seen SATA2  
and SATA3 cables. Is there 
really a difference or is this 
just a gimmick? 
—David
Senior editor Jarred 
Walton reSpondS: Hi, 
David. Anyone advertising 
SATA2 versus SATA3 
cables is mostly going after 
marketing. Technically, 
neither exists, as the real 
terms are SATA 3Gb/s 
and SATA 6Gb/s, and as 
for performance and 
throughput, I’m aware of no 
difference between SATA 
cables. The only thing you 
might see is some cables 
have a retention clip while 
others don’t. If you want to 
see benchmarks of different 
cables, Puget Systems 
checked this out a couple 
of years ago (spoiler: and 
found no differences) http://
bit.ly/MPC_PSsatatest. 
To your question about 
installing the OS on an 
SSD, if you’re doing a 
clean install to a SATA 
SSD, there shouldn’t be 
any change from the usual 
procedure. If you’re trying 
to clone an existing HDD 
installation over to an SSD, 
you’ll want to ensure TRIM 
support is enabled. Check 
this in a command prompt 
using the fsutil.exe utility: 
“fsutil behavior query 
DisableDeleteNotify”—
the result should be “0” 
if TRIM is enabled. If 
TRIM is disabled, you can 
enable it using the same 
utility: “fsutil behavior set 
DisableDeleteNotify 0” (and 
then reboot). This is more 
of a concern on Windows 7 
than Windows 8.1/10 in my 
experience, though it’s been 
a while since I cloned an 
HDD to an SSD.
There’s a third topic to 
mention, and that’s the 
faster non-SATA SSDs 
that are now arriving. 
The best ones use NVMe 
(Non-Volatile Memory 
Express) with a PCIe Gen3 
x4 interface, usually via M.2, 
though a PCIe expansion 
card is an option. For any 
NVMe drive to work as an OS 
drive, your motherboard/
laptop BIOS needs to 
support NVMe, otherwise 
the drive will only function 
as a data drive. You’ll also 
want to install NVMe drivers 
from the SSD manufacturer 
to get full performance, 
at least under Windows. 
Non-NVMe PCIe drives also 
exist, and typically don’t 
require special drivers, but 
you still need an appropriate 
M.2 slot. If you’re after bang 
for buck, SATA SSDs are 
the way to go, but for pure 
performance, NVMe drives 
are the fastest SSDs around.
NVMe Upgrade
On Black Friday I ordered 
parts for a PC upgrade that 
I’ve been planning for a 
while. A few minutes before

GTA V’s loading screens hide the CPU’s hard work. 

Would you buy a  
Steam Machine or  
build a SteamOS rig?
Michael Gieron: It’s dealing with an identity 
crisis; it’s a PC game platform, with a console 
UI, and (depending on your entry price point) 
console to mid-level PC graphics. The Steam 
Machine industry, with some time to mature, 
might be the new “third option” for choosing a 
gaming platform, or it could distance itself from 
consumers who are still trying to categorize it as 
a PC or console. In my opinion, it doesn’t belong. 
Humza Hayat: It doesn’t support most games in 
the Steam library. Why would anyone switch OS 
to play games without any compelling reason?
Jonathan lemonde: AAA games (and/or games 
I play) run on Windows only. Deal breaker. But I 
have no doubt that barrier is about to be lifted.
Boe Smith: Nope. 
alex Hansen: Why figure out a Linux distro 
when Windows 7 or 10 can get the job done? 
Matt Janosko: I do not think that I would spend 
more on a console than the combined total of 
every single game available for said console. 
That’s just me, though.
dale Horn: Can I build it using an old computer?
Charles Grooms: You can just download 
SteamOS; don’t fall for these Steam Machines, 
they’re total garbage.
What type of memory  
do you have in your rig? 
decision to change from 
the 850 Evo to the 950 Pro 
as my boot drive. I did a 
little more reading after 
placing the order and it 
seems the drive might 
not be recognized by the 
motherboard right out 
of the box. The CPU and

are the i7-5820K and Asus 
X99-Pro/USB3.1.
Can you offer any 
insight on what I need 
to do to get the 950 Pro 
running as a boot drive?
As for the OS, I have a 
retail version of Windows 
7 Ultimate that I plan to 
install and then upgrade to 
Windows 10 before doing 
a clean install of Windows 
10 from an ISO (I’ve heard 
that it’s possible to install 
Windows 10 from the 
start and use a Windows 
7 key, but I haven’t looked 
around enough to confirm 
that yet). 
—Chris
Senior editor Jarred 
Walton reSpondS: Hi, 
Chris. I haven’t used 
that motherboard, but 
depending on the BIOS 
revision, that’s the main 
thing you’d need to 
update in order to boot 
from an NVMe drive. 
Thankfully, updating the 
BIOS is pretty painless 
and you don’t need to 
have an OS installed—
just use the built-in flash 
utility from inside the 
BIOS with a USB stick, 
and you’re golden. I tried 
to confirm that the X99-
Pro/USB3.1 supports 
NVMe, but the product 
pages make no mention 
of this feature. However, 
another page (http://bit.
ly/MPC_Amobonvme) 
says all X99 and Z97 
Asus boards support 
NVMe, so you should be 
fine. You might not even 
need a BIOS update, but 
as you’re building a new 
rig, I’d do it anyway.
As for Windows 10, 
I’ve heard there’s a way 
to do a clean install, but 
I haven’t tried it. And 
truth be told, other than 
Facebook Polls
like our page at
www.facebook.com/maximumpc
taking a bit longer, I’m 
not sure a clean install 
would differ much from 
a version that came 
from updating Windows 
7/8.1. All of my Win 10 
PCs were upgraded, and 
other than one that was 
a bit stubborn, it’s been 
pretty painless. Good 
luck with your upgrade!
Subscription Model?
How long do you 
think it will be before 
Microsoft starts a yearly 
subscription fee for its 
operating system?
In the early days of PCs, 
I was a technical writer 
at an electronics firm. 
I longed for terminals 
that had disk drives and 
enough “smarts” to run 
independently of a host. 
Now, 30 years later, I 
wonder if a personal 
general-purpose 
computer will survive. Our 
current computers seem 
to be very dependent on 
the Internet. To support 
the software to run the 
machines, I suspect that 
operating systems will be 
provided on an annual fee 
basis, as so much other 
software is offered via 
subscription. 
—Tom
Senior editor Jarred 
Walton reSpondS: We’ve 
been taught for years 
that every new version 
of Windows will cost 
$50 per PC to upgrade, 
and now Microsoft has 
tried something different 
with Windows 10, giving 
away the upgrade “free” 
for the first year. How 
this plays out depends 
on the results of this 
giveaway. If Microsoft 
generates more revenue 
through other means, 
thanks to features such 
as Cortana, Windows 
Store, Bing, and so on 
being integrated into Win 
10, we may see it become 
truly free (as long as  
you enable certain  
features) permanently.
I’m hopeful that OS 
fees will disappear 
entirely. Look at Android, 
iOS, and OS X—not to 
mention the various 
FOSS options, such 
as Linux—and there’s 
a lot going for such a 
distribution model. The 
idea is that there’s a 
financial incentive for 
the OS maker to give 
the OS away, and in the 
case of Android and iOS, 
that incentive is the app 
stores. Some suspected 
Microsoft of making a 
similar play with the 
Windows Store, which 
is part of the impetus 
behind Valve’s SteamOS, 
but Microsoft backed off 
the idea of requiring all 
applications to come via 
the Windows Store—for 
now. The dark side of 
this is privacy concerns, 
but even with all the data 
mining going on, I’m not 
sure any of us would give 
up our smartphones.
The cynical part 
of me looks at all the 
subscription services—
antivirus software, 
Office 365, Netflix, 
Internet, cable, and so 
on—and can’t help but 
imagine MS is looking 
at a huge cash cow. We 
all know people who 
pirate Windows and 
Office software. I was 
talking with a tech friend 
who commented, “I did 
something for the first 
time in my life today: I 
bought a legitimate copy 
of Microsoft Office.” 
The reason was that 
Microsoft’s subscription 
model and lowered price 
point made it appealing. 
For $100 per year, he can 
install Office 365 on up 
to five machines—a far 
cry from the old $360 
per copy model used 
on Office Professional. 
We might even see a 
middle ground from 
Redmond, where the 
Office subscription also 
gives you a subscription 
to Windows. That would 
be an offer that many 
like my friend would find 
very generous.

We don’t like to have to compromise on graphics or CPU when we’ve 
got a good base system set up. As we like the Asus R9 390 Strix, we 
decided to take the price hits and work around them in other places. 
We saved a little money by going with a new case, the Phanteks Enthoo 
Pro M. The Enthoo has a lot of modularity and room for video cards. 
The R9 390 Strix is a big card, and the Enthoo’s lack of a bolted-down 
HDD cage makes installing it a breeze. We used the extra money left 
over to double our HDD storage from 1TB to 2TB. We still think that the 
days of needing multiple terabytes of storage on a local machine for 
media is pretty much over, but some people just don’t have a NAS. We 
were tempted to upgrade the mobo from Gigabyte’s Gaming 3 to the 
Gaming 5, but after checking the specs, we decided to stick with the 
Gaming 3 model. The Gaming 5 specs are almost identical to its little 
brother, the Gaming 3, it just sports an extra Ethernet connection. 
this month saW prices bounce back up again, so we had to make 
a few compromises. We had to drop the higher-end Asus mobo for 
its cheaper ASRock cousin, though the trade-off isn’t huge. The i5-
6500 is a locked CPU, so overclocking features aren’t an issue. There 
are reports of BIOS problems but, from what we see, a BIOS update 
(available online) is all you need. It features plenty of USB 3.0 ports 
and 802.11ac Wi-Fi, which rounds out some of the features we want 
in a mini-ITX build. At $175, it was hard to justify a 500GB SSD, so 
dropping to an $88 250GB model seemed a wise move. Samsung is 
still king of SSD performance and capacity for the dollar, so we stuck 
with our favorite, the 850 Evo. The only other change was switching 
from the Kingston DIMMs to G.Skill sticks. While the HyperX Fury 
sticks have better timings than the G.Skill sticks we went with, the 
price difference of $10 justified the move.

When price increases hit, they can really add up when we’re talking 
about the turbo build. It pains us to do it, but we had to let go of some 
storage sexiness to keep our budget in check. The trusty Asus 
X99-A/3.1 mobo cost an extra $35, while the Corsair Graphite shot 
up about $18. That may not seem like much in a $3,000 target budget, 
but this build cost $2,993 last month. That doesn’t leave us a whole 
lot of room for error. To make room, we made some changes.
First, we dropped the big ol’ Kraken for Corsair’s smaller H80i. 
We’ve found that the H80i gets comparable cooling performance as 
bigger all-in-one coolers, but for a smaller price and package. We 
actually built our 2015 Fall Turbo build on a 5820K and an H80i, and it 
worked quite well. Next, we dropped the lovely 1TB 850 Evo and got 
a 500GB SATA M.2 version instead. We’d like to think that someone 
spending $3,000 would either build or buy a NAS, but some folks just 
need that local hard drive. That’s OK, too. Just in case the reduction 
in storage gave anyone the willies, we tacked on a 1TB WD Black.
One thing we spent just a little extra on was our RAM. Sixteen 
gigabytes of G.Skill’s 3,000MHz sticks cost just $5 more than 16GB of 
the Corsair DIMMs, so we spent the extra $10 for a little more speed. 
At least we got to keep our dual GTX 980 Tis.
Let’s face it: Everyone should use an uninterruptable power 
supply, but few of us actually do. Using a UPS to clean up (and 
provide backup) power for your PC protects components 
from spikes, brownouts, sine wave noise, and outages.
The CP1500PFCLCD can clean up power for up to 900W of 
load, and provide two minutes of power at full load (11 minutes 
at half load) to save your butt when the lights go out. Even if 
you go with another brand or model, it’s better than trusting 
your PC’s health to your local electric utility company.
