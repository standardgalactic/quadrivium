Calculus and the Architecture of Curves
The cover photograph shows the
DZ Bank in Berlin, designed and
built 1995–2001 by Frank Gehry
and Associates. The interior atrium
is dominated by a curvaceous four-
story stainless steel sculptural
shell that suggests a prehistoric
creature and houses a central con-
ference space.
The highly complex structures
that Frank Gehry designs would be
impossible to build without the computer. 
The CATIA software that his archi-
tects and engineers use to produce the 
computer models is based on principles of
calculus—ﬁtting curves by matching tangent
lines, making sure the curvature isn’t too
large, and controlling parametric surfaces.
“Consequently,” says Gehry, “we have a lot 
of freedom. I can play with shapes.”
The process starts with Gehry’s initial 
sketches, which are translated into a succes-
sion of physical models. (Hundreds of different 
physical models were constructed during the design 
of the building, ﬁrst with basic wooden blocks and then
evolving into more sculptural forms.) Then an engineer
uses a digitizer to record the coordinates of a series of
points on a physical model. The digitized points are fed 
into a computer and the CATIA software is used to link
these points with smooth curves. (It joins curves so that
their tangent lines coincide; you can use the same idea to
design the shapes of letters in the Laboratory Project on
page 208 of this book.) The architect has considerable free-
dom in creating these curves, guided by displays of the
curve, its derivative, and its curvature. Then the curves are

connected to each other by a parametric surface,
and again the architect can do so in many possible
ways with the guidance of displays of the geometric
characteristics of the surface.
The CATIA model is then used to produce 
another physical model, which, in turn, suggests
modiﬁcations and leads to additional computer 
and physical models.
The CATIA program was developed in France 
by Dassault Systèmes, originally for designing 
airplanes, and was subsequently employed in 
the automotive industry. Frank Gehry, because of 
his complex sculptural shapes, is the ﬁrst to use 
it in architecture. It helps him answer his ques-
tion, “How wiggly can you get and still make a 
building?”

When the ﬁrst edition of this book appeared twelve years ago, a heated debate about cal-
culus reform was taking place. Such issues as the use of technology, the relevance of rigor,
and the role of discovery versus that of drill were causing deep splits in mathematics
departments. Since then the rhetoric has calmed down somewhat as reformers and tradi-
tionalists have realized that they have a common goal: to enable students to understand and
appreciate calculus.
The ﬁrst three editions were intended to be a synthesis of reform and traditional
approaches to calculus instruction. In this fourth edition I continue to follow that path by
emphasizing conceptual understanding through visual, verbal, numerical, and algebraic
approaches. I aim to convey to the student both the practical power of calculus and the
intrinsic beauty of the subject. 
The principal way in which this book differs from my more traditional calculus text-
books is that it is more streamlined. For instance, there is no complete chapter on tech-
niques of integration; I don’t prove as many theorems (see the discussion on rigor on page
xv); and the material on transcendental functions and on parametric equations is inter-
woven throughout the book instead of being treated in separate chapters. Instructors who
prefer fuller coverage of traditional calculus topics should look at my books Calculus,
Sixth Edition, and Calculus: Early Transcendentals, Sixth Edition.
What’s New In the Fourth Edition?
The changes have resulted from talking with my colleagues and students at the University
of Toronto and from reading journals, as well as suggestions from users and reviewers.
Here are some of the many improvements that I’ve incorporated into this edition:
■At the beginning of the book there are four diagnostic tests, in Basic Algebra, 
Analytic Geometry, Functions, and Trigonometry. Answers are given and students
who don’t do well are referred to where they should seek help (Appendixes, review
sections of Chapter 1, and the website stewartcalculus.com).
■The majority of examples now have titles.
■Some material has been rewritten for greater clarity or for better motivation. See,
for instance, the introduction to maximum and minimum values on pages 262–63
and the introduction to series on page 565.
■New examples have been added and the solutions to some of the existing examples
have been ampliﬁed. For instance, I added details to the solution of Example 2.3.10
because when I taught Section 2.3 last year I realized that students need more guid-
ance when setting up inequalities for the Squeeze Theorem.
■A number of pieces of art have been redrawn.
■The data in examples and exercises have been updated to be more timely.
■In response to requests of several users, the material motivating the derivative is
briefer: The former sections 2.6 and 2.7 have been combined into a single section
called Derivatives and Rates of Change.
■The section on Rates of Change in the Natural and Social Sciences has been moved
later in Chapter 3 (Section 3.8) in order to incorporate more differentiation rules.
■Coverage of inverse trigonometric functions has been consolidated in a single dedi-
cated section (3.6).

PREFACE
■The former sections 4.6 and 4.7 have been merged into a single section, with a
briefer treatment of optimization problems in business and economics.
■There is now a full section on volumes by cylindrical shells (6.3).
■Sections 8.7 and 8.8 have been merged into a single section. I had previously fea-
tured the binomial series in its own section to emphasize its importance. But I
learned that some instructors were omitting that section, so I decided to incorporate
binomial series into 8.7.
■More than 25% of the exercises in each chapter are new. Here are a few of my
favorites: 2.5.46, 2.5.49, 2.8.6–7, 3.3.50, 3.5.45– 48, 4.3.49–50, 5.2.47– 49, 8.2.35,
9.1.42, and 11.8.20–21.
■There are also some good new problems in the Focus on Problem Solving sections.
See, for instance, Problem 5 on page 252, Problems 17 and 18 on page 429, Prob-
lem 15 on page 492, Problem 13 on page 632, and Problem 9 on page 736.
■The new project on page 475, Complementary Coffee Cups, comes from an article
by Thomas Banchoff in which he wondered which of two coffee cups, whose con-
vex and concave proﬁles ﬁt together snugly, would hold more coffee.

Conceptual Exercises
The most important way to foster conceptual understanding is through the problems that
we assign. To that end I have devised various types of problems. Some exercise sets begin
with requests to explain the meanings of the basic concepts of the section. (See, for
instance, the ﬁrst couple of exercises in Sections 2.2. 2.4, 2.5, 5.3, 8.2, 11.2, and 11.3. I
often use them as a basis for classroom discussions.) Similarly, review sections begin with
a Concept Check and a True-False Quiz. Other exercises test conceptual understanding
through graphs or tables (see Exercises 1.7.22–25, 2.6.17, 2.7.33–44, 3.8.5–6, 5.2.47–49,
7.1.11–13, 8.7.2, 10.2.1–2, 10.3.33–37, 11.1.1–2, 11.1.9–18, 11.3.3–10, 11.6.1–2,
11.7.3–4, 12.1.5–10, 13.1.11–18, 13.2.15–16, and 13.3.1–2).
Another type of exercise uses verbal description to test conceptual understanding (see
Exercises 2.4.10, 2.7.54, 2.8.9, 2.8.13–14, and 5.10.55). I particularly value problems that com-
bine and compare graphical, numerical, and algebraic approaches (see Exercises 2.5.38,
2.5.43–44, 3.8.25, and 7.5.2). 
Graded Exercise Sets
Each exercise set is carefully graded, progressing from basic conceptual exercises and
skill-development problems to more challenging problems involving applications and
proofs.
Real-World Data
My assistants and I have spent a great deal of time looking in libraries, contacting compa-
nies and government agencies, and searching the Internet for interesting real-world data 
to introduce, motivate, and illustrate the concepts of calculus. As a result, many of the
examples and exercises deal with functions deﬁned by such numerical data or graphs. See,
for instance, Figure 1 in Section 1.1 (seismograms from the Northridge earthquake), Exer-
cise 5.1.14 (velocity of the space shuttle Endeavour), Figure 5 in Section 5.3 (San Fran-
cisco power consumption), Example 5 in Section 5.9 (data trafﬁc on Internet links), and
Example 3 in Section 9.6 (wave heights). 
Functions of two variables are illustrated by a table of values of the wind-chill index as
a function of air temperature and wind speed (Example 1 in Section 11.1). Partial deriva-
tives are introduced in Section 11.3 by examining a column in a table of values of the heat
index (perceived air temperature) as a function of the actual temperature and the relative 
humidity. This example is pursued further in connection with linear approximations
(Example 3 in Section 11.4). Directional derivatives are introduced in Section 11.6 by
using a temperature contour map to estimate the rate of change of temperature at Reno 
in the direction of Las Vegas. Double integrals are used to estimate the average snowfall 
in Colorado on December 20–21, 2006 (Example 4 in Section 12.1). Vector ﬁelds are

introduced in Section 13.1 by depictions of actual velocity vector ﬁelds showing San Fran-
cisco Bay wind patterns.
Projects
One way of involving students and making them active learners is to have them work (per-
haps in groups) on extended projects that give a feeling of substantial accomplishment
when completed. Applied Projects involve applications that are designed to appeal to the
imagination of students. The project after Section 3.1 asks students to design the ﬁrst
ascent and drop for a roller coaster. The project after Section 11.8 uses Lagrange multi-
pliers to determine the masses of the three stages of a rocket so as to minimize the total
mass while enabling the rocket to reach a desired velocity. Laboratory Projects involve
technology; the project following Section 3.4 shows how to use Bézier curves to design
shapes that represent letters for a laser printer. Writing Projects ask students to compare
present-day methods with those of the founders of calculus—Fermat’s method for ﬁnding
tangents, for instance. Suggested references are supplied. Discovery Projects anticipate
results to be discussed later or cover optional topics (hyperbolic functions) or encourage
discovery through pattern recognition (see the project following Section 5.8). Others
explore aspects of geometry: tetrahedra (after Section 9.4), hyperspheres (after Sec-
tion 12.7), and intersections of three cylinders (after Section 12.8). Additional projects can 
be found in the Instructor’s Guide (see, for instance, Group Exercise 5.1: Position from
Samples) and also in the CalcLabs supplements.
Rigor
I include fewer proofs than in my more traditional books, but I think it is still worthwhile
to expose students to the idea of proof and to make a clear distinction between a proof and
a plausibility argument. The important thing, I think, is to show how to deduce something
that seems less obvious from something that seems more obvious. A good example is the
use of the Mean Value Theorem to prove the Evaluation Theorem (Part 2 of the Fundamen-
tal Theorem of Calculus). I have chosen, on the other hand, not to prove the convergence
tests but rather to argue intuitively that they are true.
Problem Solving
Students usually have difﬁculties with problems for which there is no single well-deﬁned
procedure for obtaining the answer. I think nobody has improved very much on George
Polya’s four-stage problem-solving strategy and, accordingly, I have included a version of
his problem-solving principles at the end of Chapter 1. They are applied, both explicitly
and implicitly, throughout the book. (The logo 
emphasizes some of the explicit occur-
rences.) After the other chapters I have placed sections called Focus on Problem Solving,
which feature examples of how to tackle challenging calculus problems. In selecting the
varied problems for these sections I kept in mind the following advice from David Hilbert:
“A mathematical problem should be difﬁcult in order to entice us, yet not inaccessible lest
it mock our efforts.” When I put these challenging problems on assignments and tests I
grade them in a different way. Here I reward a student signiﬁcantly for ideas toward a solu-
tion and for recognizing which problem-solving principles are relevant.
Technology
The availability of technology makes it not less important but more important to under-
stand clearly the concepts that underlie the images on the screen. But, when properly used,
graphing calculators and computers are powerful tools for discovering and understanding
those concepts. I assume that the student has access to either a graphing calculator or a
computer algebra system. The icon ; indicates an exercise that deﬁnitely requires the use
of such technology, but that is not to say that a graphing device can’t be used on the other
exercises as well. The symbol 
is reserved for problems in which the full resources of a
computer algebra system (like Derive, Maple, Mathematica, or the TI-89/92) are required.
But technology doesn’t make pencil and paper obsolete. Hand calculation and sketches are
often preferable to technology for illustrating and reinforcing some concepts. Both instruc-
tors and students need to develop the ability to decide where the hand or the machine is
appropriate.

PREFACE
Tools for Enriching™ Calculus
TEC is a companion to the text and is intended to enrich and complement its contents. (It
is now accessible from the Internet at www.stewartcalculus.com.) Developed by Harvey
Keynes, Dan Clegg, Hubert Hohn, and myself, TEC uses a discovery and exploratory
approach. In sections of the book where technology is particularly appropriate, marginal
icons direct students to TEC modules that provide a laboratory environment in which they
can explore the topic in different ways and at different levels. Visuals are animations of ﬁg-
ures in the text; Modules are more elaborate activities and include exercises. Instructors
can choose to become involved at several different levels, ranging from simply encourag-
ing students to use the Visuals and Modules for independent exploration, to assigning spe-
ciﬁc exercises from those included with each Module, or to creating additional exercises,
labs, and projects that make use of the Visuals and Modules.
TEC also includes Homework Hints for representative exercises (usually odd-num-
bered) in every section of the text, indicated by printing the exercise number in red. These
hints are usually presented in the form of questions and try to imitate an effective teaching
assistant by functioning as a silent tutor. They are constructed so as not to reveal any more
of the actual solution than is minimally necessary to make further progress.
Enhanced WebAssign
Technology is having an impact on the way homework is assigned to students, particu-
larly in large classes. The use of online homework is growing and its appeal depends on
ease of use, grading precision, and reliability. With the fourth edition we have been work-
ing with the calculus community and WebAssign to develop an online homework system.
Many of the exercises in each section are assignable as online homework, including free
response, multiple choice, and multi-part formats. The system also includes Active Examples,
in which students are guided in step-by-step tutorials through text examples, with links to
the textbook and to video solutions.

Content
Diagnostic Tests
The book begins with four diagnostic tests, in Basic Algebra, Analytic Geometry, Func-
tions, and Trigonometry.
A Preview of Calculus
This is an overview of the subject and includes a list of questions to motivate the study of
calculus.
1 ■Functions and Models
From the beginning, multiple representations of functions are stressed: verbal, numerical,
visual, and algebraic. A discussion of mathematical models leads to a review of the stan-

PREFACE
xvii
dard functions, including exponential and logarithmic functions, from these four points of
view. Parametric curves are introduced in the ﬁrst chapter, partly so that curves can be
drawn easily, with technology, whenever needed throughout the text. This early placement
also enables tangents to parametric curves to be treated in Section 3.4 and graphing such
curves to be covered in Section 4.4.
2 ■Limits and Derivatives
The material on limits is motivated by a prior discussion of the tangent and velocity prob-
lems. Limits are treated from descriptive, graphical, numerical, and algebraic points of
view. (The precise deﬁnition of a limit is provided in Appendix D for those who wish to
cover it.) It is important not to rush through Sections 2.6–2.8, which deal with derivatives
(especially with functions deﬁned graphically and numerically) before the differentiation
rules are covered in Chapter 3. Here the examples and exercises explore the meanings of
derivatives in various contexts. Section 2.8 foreshadows, in an intuitive way and without
differentiation formulas, the material on shapes of curves that is studied in greater depth in
Chapter 4.
3 ■Differentiation Rules
All the basic functions are differentiated here. When derivatives are computed in applied
situations, students are asked to explain their meanings. Optional topics (hyperbolic func-
tions, an early introduction to Taylor polynomials) are explored in Discovery and Labora-
tory Projects. (A full treatment of hyperbolic functions is available to instructors on the
website.)
4 ■Applications of Differentiation
The basic facts concerning extreme values and shapes of curves are derived using the
Mean Value Theorem as the starting point. Graphing with technology emphasizes the inter-
action between calculus and calculators and the analysis of families of curves. Some sub-
stantial optimization problems are provided, including an explanation of why you need to
raise your head 42° to see the top of a rainbow.
5 ■Integrals
The area problem and the distance problem serve to motivate the deﬁnite integral. I have
decided to make the deﬁnition of an integral easier to understand by using subintervals of
equal width. Emphasis is placed on explaining the meanings of integrals in various con-
texts and on estimating their values from graphs and tables. There is no separate chapter
on techniques of integration, but substitution and parts are covered here and other methods
are treated brieﬂy. Partial fractions are given full treatment in Appendix G. The use of com-
puter algebra systems is discussed in Section 5.8.
6 ■Applications of Integration
General methods, not formulas, are emphasized. The goal is for students to be able to
divide a quantity into small pieces, estimate with Riemann sums, and recognize the limit
as an integral. There are more applications here than can realistically be covered in a given
course. Instructors should select applications suitable for their students and for which they
themselves have enthusiasm. Some instructors like to cover polar coordinates (Appendix H)
here. Others prefer to defer this topic to when it is needed in third semester (with Section 9.7
or just before Section 12.4).
7 ■Differential Equations
Modeling is the theme that uniﬁes this introductory treatment of differential equations.
Direction ﬁelds and Euler’s method are studied before separable equations are solved
explicitly, so that qualitative, numerical, and analytic approaches are given equal consid-
eration. These methods are applied to the exponential, logistic, and other models for pop-
ulation growth. Predator-prey models are used to illustrate systems of differential
equations.
8 ■Infinite Sequences and Series
Tests for the convergence of series are considered brieﬂy, with intuitive rather than formal
justiﬁcations. Numerical estimates of sums of series are based on which test was used to
prove convergence. The emphasis is on Taylor series and polynomials and their applica-
tions to physics. Error estimates include those from graphing devices.

xviii
PREFACE
The dot product and cross product of vectors are given geometric deﬁnitions, motivated by
work and torque, before the algebraic expressions are deduced. To facilitate the discussion
of surfaces, functions of two variables and their graphs are introduced here.
10 ■Vector Functions
The calculus of vector functions is used to prove Kepler’s First Law of planetary motion,
with the proofs of the other laws left as a project. In keeping with the introduction of para-
metric curves in Chapter 1, parametric surfaces are introduced as soon as possible, namely,
in this chapter. I think an early familiarity with such surfaces is desirable, especially with
the capability of computers to produce their graphs. Then tangent planes and areas of para-
metric surfaces can be discussed in Sections 11.4 and 12.6.
11 ■Partial Derivatives
Functions of two or more variables are studied from verbal, numerical, visual, and alge-
braic points of view. In particular, I introduce partial derivatives by looking at a speciﬁc
column in a table of values of the heat index (perceived air temperature) as a function of
the actual temperature and the relative humidity. Directional derivatives are estimated from
contour maps of temperature, pressure, and snowfall.
12 ■Multiple Integrals
Contour maps and the Midpoint Rule are used to estimate the average snowfall and average
temperature in given regions. Double and triple integrals are used to compute probabil-
ities, areas of parametric surfaces, volumes of hyperspheres, and the volume of intersection
of three cylinders.
13 ■Vector Fields
Vector ﬁelds are introduced through pictures of velocity ﬁelds showing San Francisco Bay
wind patterns. The similarities among the Fundamental Theorem for line integrals, Green’s
Theorem, Stokes’ Theorem, and the Divergence Theorem are emphasized.
Ancillaries
Calculus: Concepts and Contexts, Fourth Edition, is supported by a complete set of ancil-
laries developed under my direction. Each piece has been designed to enhance student
understanding and to facilitate creative instruction. The table on pages xxi and xxii lists
ancillaries available for instructors and students.

I am grateful to the following reviewers for sharing their knowledge and judgment with
me. I have learned something from each of them.

To the Student
Reading a calculus textbook is different from reading a news-
paper or a novel, or even a physics book. Don’t be discouraged
if you have to read a passage more than once in order to under-
stand it. You should have pencil and paper and calculator at
hand to sketch a diagram or make a calculation.
Some students start by trying their homework problems and
read the text only if they get stuck on an exercise. I suggest that
a far better plan is to read and understand a section of the text
before attempting the exercises. In particular, you should look 
at the deﬁnitions to see the exact meanings of the terms. And
before you read each example, I suggest that you cover up the
solution and try solving the problem yourself. You’ll get a lot
more from looking at the solution if you do so.
Part of the aim of this course is to train you to think logically.
Learn to write the solutions of the exercises in a connected,
step-by-step fashion with explanatory sentences—not just a
string of disconnected equations or formulas.
The answers to the odd-numbered exercises appear at the
back of the book, in Appendix J. Some exercises ask for a ver-
bal explanation or interpretation or description. In such cases
there is no single correct way of expressing the answer, so don’t
worry that you haven’t found the deﬁnitive answer. In addition,
there are often several different forms in which to express a
numerical or algebraic answer, so if your answer differs from
mine, don’t immediately assume you’re wrong. For example, 
if the answer given in the back of the book is 
and you
obtain 
, then you’re right and rationalizing the
denominator will show that the answers are equivalent.
The icon ; indicates an exercise that deﬁnitely requires 
the use of either a graphing calculator or a computer with
graphing software. (Section 1.4 discusses the use of these
graphing devices and some of the pitfalls that you may
1(1  s2)
s2  1
encounter.) But that doesn’t mean that graphing devices can’t
be used to check your work on the other exercises as well. The
symbol 
is reserved for problems in which the full resources
of a computer algebra system (like Derive, Maple, Mathe-
matica, or the TI-89/92) are required.
You will also encounter the symbol |, which warns you
against committing an error. I have placed this symbol in the
margin in situations where I have observed that a large propor-
tion of my students tend to make the same mistake.
Tools for Enriching Calculus, which is a companion to this
text, is referred to by means of the symbol 
and can be
accessed from www.stewartcalculus.com. It directs you to mod-
ules in which you can explore aspects of calculus for which the
computer is particularly useful. TEC also provides Homework
Hints for representative exercises that are indicated by printing
the exercise number in red: 15. These homework hints ask you
questions that allow you to make progress toward a solution
without actually giving you the answer. You need to pursue
each hint in an active manner with pencil and paper to work 
out the details. If a particular hint doesn’t enable you to solve
the problem, you can click to reveal the next hint. 
I recommend that you keep this book for reference purposes
after you ﬁnish the course. Because you will likely forget some
of the speciﬁc details of calculus, the book will serve as a 
useful reminder when you need to use calculus in subsequent
courses. And, because this book contains more material than
can be covered in any one course, it can also serve as a valuable
resource for a working scientist or engineer.
Calculus is an exciting subject, justly considered to be one
of the greatest achievements of the human intellect. I hope you
will discover that it is not only useful but also intrinsically
beautiful.

A Preview of Calculus
Calculus is fundamentally different from the mathematics that you have studied
previously: calculus is less static and more dynamic. It is concerned with change
and motion; it deals with quantities that approach other quantities. For that rea-
son it may be useful to have an overview of the subject before beginning its
intensive study. Here we give a glimpse of some of the main ideas of calculus 
by showing how the concept of a limit arises when we attempt to solve a variety
of problems.

A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS
The Area Problem
The origins of calculus go back at least 2500 years to the ancient Greeks, who found areas
using the “method of exhaustion.” They knew how to ﬁnd the area
of any polygon by
dividing it into triangles as in Figure 1 and adding the areas of these triangles.
It is a much more difﬁcult problem to ﬁnd the area of a curved ﬁgure. The Greek
method of exhaustion was to inscribe polygons in the ﬁgure and circumscribe polygons
about the ﬁgure and then let the number of sides of the polygons increase. Figure 2 illus-
trates this process for the special case of a circle with inscribed regular polygons.
Let 
be the area of the inscribed polygon with sides. As increases, it appears that
becomes closer and closer to the area of the circle. We say that the area of the circle is
the limit of the areas of the inscribed polygons, and we write
The Greeks themselves did not use limits explicitly. However, by indirect reasoning,
Eudoxus (ﬁfth century BC) used exhaustion to prove the familiar formula for the area of a
circle: 
We will use a similar idea in Chapter 5 to ﬁnd areas of regions of the type shown in Fig-
ure 3. We will approximate the desired area 
by areas of rectangles (as in Figure 4), let
the width of the rectangles decrease, and then calculate 
as the limit of these sums of
areas of rectangles.
The area problem is the central problem in the branch of calculus called integral cal-
culus. The techniques that we will develop in Chapter 5 for ﬁnding areas will also enable
us to compute the volume of a solid, the length of a curve, the force of water against a dam,
the mass and center of gravity of a rod, and the work done in pumping water out of a tank.
The Tangent Problem
Consider the problem of trying to ﬁnd an equation of the tangent line 
to a curve with
equation 
at a given point . (We will give a precise deﬁnition of a tangent line in

Chapter 2. For now you can think of it as a line that touches the curve at 
as in Figure 5.)
Since we know that the point 
lies on the tangent line, we can ﬁnd the equation of if we
know its slope 
. The problem is that we need two points to compute the slope and we
know only one point, , on . To get around the problem we ﬁrst ﬁnd an approximation to
by taking a nearby point 
on the curve and computing the slope 
of the secant line
. From Figure 6 we see that
Now imagine that 
moves along the curve toward 
as in Figure 7. You can see that
the secant line rotates and approaches the tangent line as its limiting position. This means
that the slope 
of the secant line becomes closer and closer to the slope

gent line. We write

Speciﬁc examples of this procedure will be given in Chapter 2.
The tangent problem has given rise to the branch of calculus called differential calculus,
which was not invented until more than 2000 years after integral calculus. The main ideas
behind differential calculus are due to the French mathematician Pierre Fermat
(1601–1665) and were developed by the English mathematicians John Wallis
(1616–1703), Isaac Barrow (1630–1677), and Isaac Newton (1642–1727) and the German
mathematician Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716).
The two branches of calculus and their chief problems, the area problem and the tan-
gent problem, appear to be very different, but it turns out that there is a very close connec-
tion between them. The tangent problem and the area problem are inverse problems in a
sense that will be described in Chapter 5.
Velocity
When we look at the speedometer of a car and read that the car is traveling at 48 mih,
what does that information indicate to us? We know that if the velocity remains constant,
then after an hour we will have traveled 48 mi. But if the velocity of the car varies, what
does it mean to say that the velocity at a given instant is 48 mih?
In order to analyze this question, let’s examine the motion of a car that travels along a
straight road and assume that we can measure the distance traveled by the car (in feet) at
l-second intervals as in the following chart:

A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS
As a ﬁrst step toward ﬁnding the velocity after 2 seconds have elapsed, we ﬁnd the aver-
age velocity during the time interval 
:
Similarly, the average velocity in the time interval 
is
We have the feeling that the velocity at the instant  2 can’t be much different from the
average velocity during a short time interval starting at 
. So let’s imagine that the dis-
tance traveled has been measured at 0.l-second time intervals as in the following chart:
Then we can compute, for instance, the average velocity over the time interval 
:
The results of such calculations are shown in the following chart:
The average velocities over successively smaller intervals appear to be getting closer to
a number near 10, and so we expect that the velocity at exactly 
is about 10 fts. In
Chapter 2 we will deﬁne the instantaneous velocity of a moving object as the limiting
value of the average velocities over smaller and smaller time intervals.
In Figure 8 we show a graphical representation of the motion of the car by plotting the
distance traveled as a function of time. If we write 
, then 
is the number of feet
traveled after seconds. The average velocity in the time interval 
is
which is the same as the slope of the secant line 
in Figure 8. The velocity when 
is the limiting value of this average velocity as approaches 2; that is,
and we recognize from Equation 2 that this is the same as the slope of the tangent line to
the curve at .P

Thus, when we solve the tangent problem in differential calculus, we are also solving
problems concerning velocities. The same techniques also enable us to solve problems
involving rates of change in all of the natural and social sciences.
The Limit of a Sequence
In the ﬁfth century BC the Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea posed four problems, now
known as Zeno’s paradoxes, that were intended to challenge some of the ideas concerning
space and time that were held in his day. Zeno’s second paradox concerns a race between
the Greek hero Achilles and a tortoise that has been given a head start. Zeno argued, as fol-
lows, that Achilles could never pass the tortoise: Suppose that Achilles starts at position 
and the tortoise starts at position . (See Figure 9.) When Achilles reaches the point
, the tortoise is farther ahead at position . When Achilles reaches 
, the tor-
toise is at . This process continues indeﬁnitely and so it appears that the tortoise will
always be ahead! But this deﬁes common sense.
One way of explaining this paradox is with the idea of a sequence. The successive posi-
tions of Achilles
or the successive positions of the tortoise 
form what is known as a sequence.
In general, a sequence 
is a set of numbers written in a deﬁnite order. For instance,
the sequence
can be described by giving the following formula for the th term:
We can visualize this sequence by plotting its terms on a number line as in Fig-
ure 10(a) or by drawing its graph as in Figure 10(b). Observe from either picture that the
terms of the sequence 
are becoming closer and closer to 0 as increases. In fact,
we can ﬁnd terms as small as we please by making 
large enough. We say that the limit
of the sequence is 0, and we indicate this by writing
In general, the notation
is used if the terms 
approach the number as becomes large. This means that the num-
bers 
can be made as close as we like to the number 
by taking sufﬁciently large.

The concept of the limit of a sequence occurs whenever we use the decimal represen-
tation of a real number. For instance, if
then
The terms in this sequence are rational approximations to .
Let’s return to Zeno’s paradox. The successive positions of Achilles and the tortoise
form sequences 
and 
, where 
for all . It can be shown that both sequences
have the same limit:
It is precisely at this point 
that Achilles overtakes the tortoise.
The Sum of a Series
Another of Zeno’s paradoxes, as passed on to us by Aristotle, is the following: “A man
standing in a room cannot walk to the wall. In order to do so, he would ﬁrst have to go half
the distance, then half the remaining distance, and then again half of what still remains.
This process can always be continued and can never be ended.” (See Figure 11.)
Of course, we know that the man can actually reach the wall, so this suggests that per-
haps the total distance can be expressed as the sum of inﬁnitely many smaller distances as
follows:

Zeno was arguing that it doesn’t make sense to add inﬁnitely many numbers together. But
there are other situations in which we implicitly use inﬁnite sums. For instance, in decimal
notation, the symbol 
means
and so, in some sense, it must be true that
More generally, if 
denotes the nth digit in the decimal representation of a number, then
Therefore some inﬁnite sums, or inﬁnite series as they are called, have a meaning. But we
must deﬁne carefully what the sum of an inﬁnite series is.
Returning to the series in Equation 3, we denote by 
the sum of the ﬁrst terms of the
series. Thus
Observe that as we add more and more terms, the partial sums become closer and closer
to 1. In fact, it can be shown that by taking 
large enough (that is, by adding sufﬁciently
many terms of the series), we can make the partial sum 
as close as we please to the num-
ber 1. It therefore seems reasonable to say that the sum of the inﬁnite series is 1 and to
write

In other words, the reason the sum of the series is 1 is that
In Chapter 8 we will discuss these ideas further. We will then use Newton’s idea of com-
bining inﬁnite series with differential and integral calculus.
Summary
We have seen that the concept of a limit arises in trying to ﬁnd the area of a region, the
slope of a tangent to a curve, the velocity of a car, or the sum of an inﬁnite series. In each
case the common theme is the calculation of a quantity as the limit of other, easily calcu-
lated quantities. It is this basic idea of a limit that sets calculus apart from other areas of
mathematics. In fact, we could deﬁne calculus as the part of mathematics that deals with
limits.
After Sir Isaac Newton invented his version of calculus, he used it to explain the motion
of the planets around the sun. Today calculus is used in calculating the orbits of satellites
and spacecraft, in predicting population sizes, in estimating how fast oil prices rise or fall,
in forecasting weather, in measuring the cardiac output of the heart, in calculating life
insurance premiums, and in a great variety of other areas. We will explore some of these
uses of calculus in this book.
In order to convey a sense of the power of the subject, we end this preview with a list
of some of the questions that you will be able to answer using calculus:
1. How can we explain the fact, illustrated in Figure 12, that the angle of elevation
from an observer up to the highest point in a rainbow is 42°? (See page 270.)
2. How can we explain the shapes of cans on supermarket shelves? (See page 311.)
3. Where is the best place to sit in a movie theater? (See page 464.)
4. How far away from an airport should a pilot start descent? (See page 209.)
5. How can we ﬁt curves together to design shapes to represent letters on a laser
printer? (See page 208.)
6. Where should an inﬁelder position himself to catch a baseball thrown by an out-
ﬁelder and relay it to home plate? (See page 530.)
7. Does a ball thrown upward take longer to reach its maximum height or to fall
back to its original height? (See page 518.)
8. How can we explain the fact that planets and satellites move in elliptical orbits?
(See page 722.)
9. How can we distribute water ﬂow among turbines at a hydroelectric station so as
to maximize the total energy production? (See page 821.)
10. If a marble, a squash ball, a steel bar, and a lead pipe roll down a slope, which of
them reaches the bottom ﬁrst? (See page 889.)

Functions and Models
The fundamental objects that we deal with in calculus are functions. This chapter
prepares the way for calculus by discussing the basic ideas concerning functions,
their graphs, and ways of transforming and combining them. We stress that a
function can be represented in different ways: by an equation, in a table, by a
graph, or in words. We look at the main types of functions that occur in calculus
and describe the process of using these functions as mathematical models of
real-world phenomena. We also discuss the use of graphing calculators and
graphing software for computers and see that parametric equations provide the
best method for graphing certain types of curves.

CHAPTER 1
FUNCTIONS AND MODELS
Functions arise whenever one quantity depends on another. Consider the following four
situations.
A. The area 
of a circle depends on the radius of the circle. The rule that connects 
and 
is given by the equation 
. With each positive number there is associ-
ated one value of , and we say that 
is a function of .
B. The human population of the world 
depends on the time . The table gives estimates
of the world population 
at time 
for certain years. For instance,
But for each value of the time there is a corresponding value of 
and we say that 
is a function of .
C. The cost 
of mailing a large envelope depends on the weight 
of the envelope.
Although there is no simple formula that connects 
and , the post ofﬁce has a rule
for determining 
when 
is known.
D. The vertical acceleration of the ground as measured by a seismograph during an
earthquake is a function of the elapsed time 
Figure 1 shows a graph generated by
seismic activity during the Northridge earthquake that shook Los Angeles in 1994.
For a given value of 
the graph provides a corresponding value of .
Each of these examples describes a rule whereby, given a number ( , , , or ), another
number ( , , , or ) is assigned. In each case we say that the second number is a func-
tion of the ﬁrst number.
A function
is a rule that assigns to each element in a set 
exactly one ele-
ment, called 
, in a set .
We usually consider functions for which the sets 
and 
are sets of real numbers. The
set 
is called the domain of the function. The number 
is the value of 
at
and is
read “
of .” The range of 
is the set of all possible values of 
as varies through-
out the domain. A symbol that represents an arbitrary number in the domain of a function
is called an independent variable. A symbol that represents a number in the range of 
is called a dependent variable. In Example A, for instance, r is the independent variable
and A is the dependent variable.

SECTION 1.1
FOUR WAYS TO REPRESENT A FUNCTION
13
It’s helpful to think of a function as a machine (see Figure 2). If is in the domain of
the function 
then when enters the machine, it’s accepted as an input and the machine
produces an output 
according to the rule of the function. Thus we can think of the
domain as the set of all possible inputs and the range as the set of all possible outputs.
The preprogrammed functions in a calculator are good examples of a function as a
machine. For example, the square root key on your calculator computes such a function.
You press the key labeled 
(or 
) and enter the input . If 
, then is not in the
domain of this function; that is, 
is not an acceptable input, and the calculator will indi-
cate an error. If 
, then an approximation to 
will appear in the display. Thus the
key on your calculator is not quite the same as the exact mathematical function 
deﬁned by 
.
Another way to picture a function is by an arrow diagram as in Figure 3. Each arrow
connects an element of 
to an element of . The arrow indicates that 
is associated
with 
is associated with , and so on.
The most common method for visualizing a function is its graph. If 
is a function with
domain , then its graph is the set of ordered pairs
(Notice that these are input-output pairs.) In other words, the graph of 
consists of all
points 
in the coordinate plane such that 
and is in the domain of .
The graph of a function 
gives us a useful picture of the behavior or “life history” of
a function. Since the -coordinate of any point 
on the graph is 
, we can read
the value of 
from the graph as being the height of the graph above the point 
(see
Figure 4). The graph of 
also allows us to picture the domain of 
on the -axis and its
range on the -axis as in Figure 5.
Reading information from a graph
The graph of a function 
is shown in 
Figure 6.
(a) Find the values of

.
(b) What are the domain and range of ?
SOLUTION
(a) We see from Figure 6 that the point 
lies on the graph of , so the value of
at 1 is 
. (In other words, the point on the graph that lies above 
is 3 units
above the -axis.)
When 
, the graph lies about 0.7 unit below the x-axis, so we estimate that
.
(b) We see that 
is deﬁned when 
, so the domain of 
is the closed inter-
val 
. Notice that 
takes on all values from 
to 4, so the range of 
is

SOLUTION
(a) The equation of the graph is 
, and we recognize this as being the equa-
tion of a line with slope 2 and -intercept 
. (Recall the slope-intercept form of the
equation of a line: 
. See Appendix B.) This enables us to sketch a portion of
the graph of 
in Figure 7. The expression 
is deﬁned for all real numbers, so the
domain of 
is the set of all real numbers, which we denote by . The graph shows that
the range is also .
(b) Since 
and 
, we could plot the points 
and

graph (Figure 8). The equation of the graph is 
, which represents a parabola (see
Appendix B). The domain of is . The range of consists of all values of 
, that is,
all numbers of the form 
. But 
for all numbers and any positive number is a
square. So the range of is 
. This can also be seen from Figure 8.

Representations of Functions
There are four possible ways to represent a function:
■verbally
(by a description in words)
■numerically
(by a table of values)
■visually
(by a graph)
■algebraically
(by an explicit formula)
If a single function can be represented in all four ways, it’s often useful to go from one
representation to another to gain additional insight into the function. (In Example 2, for
instance, we started with algebraic formulas and then obtained the graphs.) But certain
functions are described more naturally by one method than by another. With this in mind,
let’s reexamine the four situations that we considered at the beginning of this section.

FOUR WAYS TO REPRESENT A FUNCTION
15
A. The most useful representation of the area of a circle as a function of its radius is
probably the algebraic formula 
, though it is possible to compile a table of
values or to sketch a graph (half a parabola). Because a circle has to have a positive
radius, the domain is 
, and the range is also 
.
B. We are given a description of the function in words: 
is the human population of
the world at time t. The table of values of world population provides a convenient
representation of this function. If we plot these values, we get the graph (called a
scatter plot) in Figure 9. It too is a useful representation; the graph allows us to
absorb all the data at once. What about a formula? Of course, it’s impossible to devise
an explicit formula that gives the exact human population 
at any time t. But it is
possible to ﬁnd an expression for a function that approximates 
. In fact, using
methods explained in Section 1.5, we obtain the approximation
and Figure 10 shows that it is a reasonably good “ﬁt.” The function 
is called a
mathematical model for population growth. In other words, it is a function with an
explicit formula that approximates the behavior of our given function. We will see,
however, that the ideas of calculus can be applied to a table of values; an explicit
formula is not necessary.
The function 
is typical of the functions that arise whenever we attempt to apply
calculus to the real world. We start with a verbal description of a function. Then we
may be able to construct a table of values of the function, perhaps from instrument
readings in a scientiﬁc experiment. Even though we don’t have complete knowledge
of the values of the function, we will see throughout the book that it is still possible to
perform the operations of calculus on such a function.
C. Again the function is described in words: 
is the cost of mailing a large envelope
with weight . The rule that the US Postal Service used as of 2008 is as follows: The
cost is 83 cents for up to 1 oz, plus 17 cents for each additional ounce (or less) up to
13 oz. The table of values shown in the margin is the most convenient representation
for this function, though it is possible to sketch a graph (see Example 10).
D. The graph shown in Figure 1 is the most natural representation of the vertical acceler-
ation function 
. It’s true that a table of values could be compiled, and it is even 
possible to devise an approximate formula. But everything a geologist needs to
know—amplitudes and patterns—can be seen easily from the graph. (The same is 
true for the patterns seen in electrocardiograms of heart patients and polygraphs for
lie-detection.)

CHAPTER 1
FUNCTIONS AND MODELS
Drawing a graph from a verbal description
When you turn on a hot-water
faucet, the temperature 
of the water depends on how long the water has been running.
Draw a rough graph of 
as a function of the time that has elapsed since the faucet was
turned on.
SOLUTION The initial temperature of the running water is close to room temperature
because the water has been sitting in the pipes. When the water from the hot-water tank
starts ﬂowing from the faucet, 
increases quickly. In the next phase, 
is constant at
the temperature of the heated water in the tank. When the tank is drained, 
decreases 
to the temperature of the water supply. This enables us to make the rough sketch of 
as
a function of in Figure 11.
In the following example we start with a verbal description of a function in a physical
situation and obtain an explicit algebraic formula. The ability to do this is a useful skill in
solving calculus problems that ask for the maximum or minimum values of quantities.
Expressing a cost as a function A rectangular storage container with an
open top has a volume of 10 m . The length of its base is twice its width. Material for
the base costs $10 per square meter; material for the sides costs $6 per square meter.
Express the cost of materials as a function of the width of the base.
SOLUTION We draw a diagram as in Figure 12 and introduce notation by letting
and
be the width and length of the base, respectively, and be the height.
The area of the base is 
, so the cost, in dollars, of the material for the
base is 
. Two of the sides have area 
and the other two have area 
, so the
cost of the material for the sides is 
. The total cost is therefore
To express 
as a function of 
alone, we need to eliminate and we do so by using the
fact that the volume is 10 m . Thus
which gives
Substituting this into the expression for , we have
Therefore the equation
expresses 
as a function of .
Find the domain of each function.
(a)
(b)
SOLUTION
(a) Because the square root of a negative number is not deﬁned (as a real number), 
the domain of 
consists of all values of such that 
. This is equivalent to
, so the domain is the interval 
.

PS
Domain Convention
If a function is given by a formula and the
domain is not stated explicitly, the convention is
that the domain is the set of all numbers for
which the formula makes sense and deﬁnes a
real number.

(b) Since
and division by is not allowed, we see that 
is not deﬁned when 
or 
.
Thus the domain of is
which could also be written in interval notation as
The graph of a function is a curve in the 
-plane. But the question arises: Which curves
in the 
-plane are graphs of functions? This is answered by the following test.
The Vertical Line Test A curve in the 
-plane is the graph of a function of if and
only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once.
The reason for the truth of the Vertical Line Test can be seen in Figure 13. If each ver-
tical line 
intersects a curve only once, at 
, then exactly one functional value 
is deﬁned by 
. But if a line 
intersects the curve twice, at 
and 
,
then the curve can’t represent a function because a function can’t assign two different val-
ues to .
For example, the parabola 
shown in Figure 14(a) is not the graph of a func-
tion of because, as you can see, there are vertical lines that intersect the parabola twice.
The parabola, however, does contain the graphs of two functions of . Notice that the equa-
tion 
implies 
, so 
Thus the upper and lower halves
of the parabola are the graphs of the functions 
[from Example 6(a)] and
. [See Figures 14(b) and (c).] We observe that if we reverse the roles of
and , then the equation 
does deﬁne 
as a function of (with 
as
the independent variable and as the dependent variable) and the parabola now appears as
the graph of the function .

CHAPTER 1
FUNCTIONS AND MODELS
Piecewise Deﬁned Functions
The functions in the following four examples are deﬁned by different formulas in differ-
ent parts of their domains.
Graphing a piecewise deﬁned function A function 
is deﬁned by
Evaluate 
, 
, and 
and sketch the graph.
SOLUTION Remember that a function is a rule. For this particular function the rule is the
following: First look at the value of the input . If it happens that 
, then the value
of 
is 
. On the other hand, if 
, then the value of 
is 
.
How do we draw the graph of ? We observe that if 
, then 
, so 
the part of the graph of 
that lies to the left of the vertical line 
must coincide
with the line 
, which has slope 
and -intercept 1. If 
, then 
,
so the part of the graph of 
that lies to the right of the line 
must coincide with the
graph of 
, which is a parabola. This enables us to sketch the graph in Figure 15.
The solid dot indicates that the point 
is included on the graph; the open dot indi-
cates that the point 
is excluded from the graph.
The next example of a piecewise deﬁned function is the absolute value function. Recall
that the absolute value of a number , denoted by 
, is the distance from 
to 
on the
real number line. Distances are always positive or , so we have
for every number 
For example,
In general, we have
(Remember that if is negative, then 
is positive.)
Sketch the graph of the absolute value function 
.
SOLUTION From the preceding discussion we know that
Using the same method as in Example 7, we see that the graph of 
coincides with the
line 
to the right of the -axis and coincides with the line 
to the left of the
-axis (see Figure 16).

its equation is

have
The line through

So we have
We also see that the graph of

tion together, we have the following three-piece formula for :
Graph of a postage function
In Example C at the beginning of this section
we considered the cost 
of mailing a large envelope with weight . In effect, this is
a piecewise deﬁned function because, from the table of values, we have
The graph is shown in Figure 18. You can see why functions similar to this one are
called step functions—they jump from one value to the next. Such functions will be
studied in Chapter 2.
Symmetry
If a function 
satisﬁes 
for every number in its domain, then 
is called an
even function. For instance, the function 
is even because
The geometric signiﬁcance of an even function is that its graph is symmetric with respect

we obtain the entire graph simply by reﬂecting this portion about the -axis.
If 
satisﬁes 
for every number in its domain, then 
is called an odd
function. For example, the function 
is odd because
The graph of an odd function is symmetric about the origin (see Figure 20). If we already

MATHEMATICAL MODELS: A CATALOG OF ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS
25
A mathematical model is a mathematical description (often by means of a function or an
equation) of a real-world phenomenon such as the size of a population, the demand for a
product, the speed of a falling object, the concentration of a product in a chemical reac-
tion, the life expectancy of a person at birth, or the cost of emission reductions. The pur-
pose of the model is to understand the phenomenon and perhaps to make predictions about
future behavior.
Figure 1 illustrates the process of mathematical modeling. Given a real-world problem,
our ﬁrst task is to formulate a mathematical model by identifying and naming the inde-
pendent and dependent variables and making assumptions that simplify the phenomenon
enough to make it mathematically tractable. We use our knowledge of the physical situa-
tion and our mathematical skills to obtain equations that relate the variables. In situations
where there is no physical law to guide us, we may need to collect data (either from a
library or the Internet or by conducting our own experiments) and examine the data in the
form of a table in order to discern patterns. From this numerical representation of a func-
tion we may wish to obtain a graphical representation by plotting the data. The graph
might even suggest a suitable algebraic formula in some cases.
The second stage is to apply the mathematics that we know (such as the calculus that
will be developed throughout this book) to the mathematical model that we have formu-
lated in order to derive mathematical conclusions. Then, in the third stage, we take those
mathematical conclusions and interpret them as information about the original real-world
phenomenon by way of offering explanations or making predictions. The ﬁnal step is to
test our predictions by checking against new real data. If the predictions don’t compare
well with reality, we need to reﬁne our model or to formulate a new model and start the
cycle again.
A mathematical model is never a completely accurate representation of a physical situ-
ation—it is an idealization. A good model simpliﬁes reality enough to permit mathemati-
cal calculations but is accurate enough to provide valuable conclusions. It is important to
realize the limitations of the model. In the end, Mother Nature has the ﬁnal say.
There are many different types of functions that can be used to model relationships
observed in the real world. In what follows, we discuss the behavior and graphs of these 
functions and give examples of situations appropriately modeled by such functions.
Linear Models
When we say that y is a linear function of x, we mean that the graph of the function is a
line, so we can use the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line to write a formula for
the function as
where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept.

CHAPTER 1
FUNCTIONS AND MODELS
A characteristic feature of linear functions is that they grow at a constant rate. For
instance, Figure 2 shows a graph of the linear function 
and a table of sam-
ple values. Notice that whenever x increases by 0.1, the value of 
increases by 0.3. So
increases three times as fast as x. Thus the slope of the graph 
, namely 3, can
be interpreted as the rate of change of y with respect to x.
Interpreting the slope of a linear model
(a) As dry air moves upward, it expands and cools. If the ground temperature is 
and the temperature at a height of 1 km is 
, express the temperature T (in °C) as a
function of the height h (in kilometers), assuming that a linear model is appropriate.
(b) Draw the graph of the function in part (a). What does the slope represent?
(c) What is the temperature at a height of 2.5 km?
SOLUTION
(a) Because we are assuming that T is a linear function of h, we can write
We are given that 
when 
, so
In other words, the y-intercept is 
.
We are also given that 
when 
, so
The slope of the line is therefore
and the required linear function is
(b) The graph is sketched in Figure 3. The slope is 
, and this represents
the rate of change of temperature with respect to height.
(c) At a height of 
, the temperature is
If there is no physical law or principle to help us formulate a model, we construct an
empirical model, which is based entirely on collected data. We seek a curve that “ﬁts” the
data in the sense that it captures the basic trend of the data points.

A linear regression model
Table 1 lists the average carbon dioxide level in
the atmosphere, measured in parts per million at Mauna Loa Observatory from 1980 to
2006. Use the data in Table 1 to ﬁnd a model for the carbon dioxide level.
SOLUTION We use the data in Table 1 to make the scatter plot in Figure 4, where repre-
sents time (in years) and 
represents the 
level (in parts per million, ppm).
Notice that the data points appear to lie close to a straight line, so it’s natural to
choose a linear model in this case. But there are many possible lines that approximate
these data points, so which one should we use? One possibility is the line that passes
through the ﬁrst and last data points. The slope of this line is
and its equation is
or
Equation 1 gives one possible linear model for the carbon dioxide level; it is graphed
in Figure 5.
Notice that our model gives values higher than most of the actual 
levels. A better
linear model is obtained by a procedure from statistics called linear regression. If we use

FUNCTIONS AND MODELS
a graphing calculator, we enter the data from Table 1 into the data editor and choose the
linear regression command. (With Maple we use the ﬁt[leastsquare] command in the
stats package; with Mathematica we use the Fit command.) The machine gives the slope
and y-intercept of the regression line as
So our least squares model for the 
level is
In Figure 6 we graph the regression line as well as the data points. Comparing with
Figure 5, we see that it gives a better ﬁt than our previous linear model.
Using a linear model for prediction
Use the linear model given by Equa-
tion 2 to estimate the average 
level for 1987 and to predict the level for the year
2012. According to this model, when will the 
level exceed 400 parts per million?
SOLUTION Using Equation 2 with t  1987, we estimate that the average 
level in
1987 was
This is an example of interpolation because we have estimated a value between observed
values. (In fact, the Mauna Loa Observatory reported that the average 
level in 1987
was 348.93 ppm, so our estimate is quite accurate.)
With 
, we get
So we predict that the average 
level in the year 2012 will be 389.7 ppm. This is 
an example of extrapolation because we have predicted a value outside the region of
observations. Consequently, we are far less certain about the accuracy of our prediction.
Using Equation 2, we see that the 
level exceeds 400 ppm when
Solving this inequality, we get

A computer or graphing calculator ﬁnds the
regression line by the method of least squares,
which is to minimize the sum of the squares of
the vertical distances between the data points
and the line. The details are explained in 
Section 11.7.

We therefore predict that the 
level will exceed 400 ppm by the year 2018. This 
prediction is risky because it involves a time quite remote from our observations. In fact,
we see from Figure 6 that the trend has been for 
levels to increase rather more rap-
idly in recent years, so the level might exceed 400 ppm well before 2018.
Polynomials
A function 
is called a polynomial if
where is a nonnegative integer and the numbers 
are constants called the
coefﬁcients of the polynomial. The domain of any polynomial is 
If the 
leading coefﬁcient 
, then the degree of the polynomial is . For example, the 
function
is a polynomial of degree 6.
A polynomial of degree 1 is of the form 
and so it is a linear function.
A polynomial of degree 2 is of the form 
and is called a quadratic
function. Its graph is always a parabola obtained by shifting the parabola 
, as we
will see in the next section. The parabola opens upward if 
and downward if 
.
(See Figure 7.)
A polynomial of degree 3 is of the form
and is called a cubic function. Figure 8 shows the graph of a cubic function in part (a)
and graphs of polynomials of degrees 4 and 5 in parts (b) and (c). We will see later why
the graphs have these shapes.

CHAPTER 1
FUNCTIONS AND MODELS
Polynomials are commonly used to model various quantities that occur in the natural
and social sciences. For instance, in Section 3.8 we will explain why economists often use
a polynomial 
to represent the cost of producing 
units of a commodity. In the fol-
lowing example we use a quadratic function to model the fall of a ball.
A quadratic model A ball is dropped from the upper observation deck of the
CN Tower, 450 m above the ground, and its height h above the ground is recorded at 
1-second intervals in Table 2. Find a model to ﬁt the data and use the model to predict
the time at which the ball hits the ground.
SOLUTION We draw a scatter plot of the data in Figure 9 and observe that a linear model
is inappropriate. But it looks as if the data points might lie on a parabola, so we try a
quadratic model instead. Using a graphing calculator or computer algebra system (which
uses the least squares method), we obtain the following quadratic model:
In Figure 10 we plot the graph of Equation 3 together with the data points and see
that the quadratic model gives a very good ﬁt.
The ball hits the ground when 
, so we solve the quadratic equation
The quadratic formula gives
The positive root is 
, so we predict that the ball will hit the ground after about
9.7 seconds.
Power Functions
A function of the form 
, where 
is a constant, is called a power function. We
consider several cases.

The general shape of the graph of

The graph of the reciprocal function
is shown in Figure 14. Its graph
has the equation 
, or 
, and is a hyperbola with the coordinate axes as its
asymptotes. This function arises in physics and chemistry in connection with Boyle’s
Law, which says that, when the temperature is constant, the volume 
of a gas is
inversely proportional to the pressure :
where C is a constant. Thus the graph of V as a function of P (see Figure 15) has the
same general shape as the right half of Figure 14.
Another instance in which a power function is used to model a physical phenomenon
is discussed in Exercise 26.
Rational Functions
A rational function
is a ratio of two polynomials:
where
and
are polynomials. The domain consists of all values of
such that
.
A simple example of a rational function is the function 
, whose domain is
; this is the reciprocal function graphed in Figure 14. The function
is a rational function with domain 
. Its graph is shown in Figure 16.
Algebraic Functions
A function is called an algebraic function if it can be constructed using algebraic oper-
ations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and taking roots) starting
with polynomials. Any rational function is automatically an algebraic function. Here are
two more examples:
When we sketch algebraic functions in Chapter 4, we will see that their graphs can assume
a variety of shapes. Figure 17 illustrates some of the possibilities.

An example of an algebraic function occurs in the theory of relativity. The mass of a
particle with velocity is
where 
is the rest mass of the particle and 
kms is the speed of light in
a vacuum.
Trigonometric Functions
Trigonometry and the trigonometric functions are reviewed on Reference Page 2 and also
in Appendix C. In calculus the convention is that radian measure is always used (except
when otherwise indicated). For example, when we use the function 
, it is 
understood that 
means the sine of the angle whose radian measure is . Thus the
graphs of the sine and cosine functions are as shown in Figure 18.
Notice that for both the sine and cosine functions the domain is 
and the range
is the closed interval 
. Thus, for all values of , we have
or, in terms of absolute values,
Also, the zeros of the sine function occur at the integer multiples of ; that is,
An important property of the sine and cosine functions is that they are periodic func-
tions and have period

FUNCTIONS AND MODELS
The periodic nature of these functions makes them suitable for modeling repetitive phe-
nomena such as tides, vibrating springs, and sound waves. For instance, in Example 4 in
Section 1.3 we will see that a reasonable model for the number of hours of daylight in
Philadelphia t days after January 1 is given by the function
The tangent function is related to the sine and cosine functions by the equation
and its graph is shown in Figure 19. It is undeﬁned whenever 
, that is, when
,
Its range is
. Notice that the tangent function has period
:
The remaining three trigonometric functions (cosecant, secant, and cotangent) are 
the reciprocals of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions. Their graphs are shown in
Appendix C.
Exponential Functions
The exponential functions are the functions of the form 
, where the base 
is a
positive constant. The graphs of 
and 
are shown in Figure 20. In both
cases the domain is 
and the range is 
.
Exponential functions will be studied in detail in Section 1.5, and we will see that they
are useful for modeling many natural phenomena, such as population growth (if 
)
and radioactive decay (if 
Logarithmic Functions
The logarithmic functions
, where the base 
is a positive constant, are the
inverse functions of the exponential functions. They will be studied in Section 1.6. Figure
21 shows the graphs of four logarithmic functions with various bases. In each case the
domain is 
, the range is 
, and the function increases slowly when 
.

have discussed.

In this section we start with the basic functions we discussed in Section 1.2 and obtain new
functions by shifting, stretching, and reﬂecting their graphs. We also show how to combine
pairs of functions by the standard arithmetic operations and by composition.
Transformations of Functions
By applying certain transformations to the graph of a given function we can obtain the
graphs of certain related functions. This will give us the ability to sketch the graphs of
many functions quickly by hand. It will also enable us to write equations for given graphs.
Let’s ﬁrst consider translations. If c is a positive number, then the graph of 
is
just the graph of 
shifted upward a distance of c units (because each y-coordinate
is increased by the same number c). Likewise, if 
, where

Now let’s consider the stretching and reﬂecting transformations. If

graph of

Transforming the root function
Given the graph of

mations to graph

, and 
.
SOLUTION The graph of the square root function 
, obtained from Figure 13(a) 
in Section 1.2, is shown in Figure 4(a). In the other parts of the ﬁgure we sketch
by shifting 2 units downward, 
by shifting 2 units to the right,
by reﬂecting about the -axis, 
by stretching vertically by a factor 
of 2, and 
by reﬂecting about the -axis.
Sketch the graph of the function 
.
SOLUTION Completing the square, we write the equation of the graph as
This means we obtain the desired graph by starting with the parabola 
and shifting
3 units to the left and then 1 unit upward (see Figure 5).

the period of

Modeling amount of daylight as a function of time of year Figure 9 shows graphs
of the number of hours of daylight as functions of the time of the year at several latitudes.
Given that Philadelphia is located at approximately 
latitude, ﬁnd a function that
models the length of daylight at Philadelphia.
SOLUTION Notice that each curve resembles a shifted and stretched sine function. By
looking at the blue curve we see that, at the latitude of Philadelphia, daylight lasts about
14.8 hours on June 21 and 9.2 hours on December 21, so the amplitude of the curve (the
factor by which we have to stretch the sine curve vertically) is 
.

By what factor do we need to stretch the sine curve horizontally if we measure the
time t in days? Because there are about 365 days in a year, the period of our model
should be 365. But the period of 
is 
, so the horizontal stretching factor is
.
We also notice that the curve begins its cycle on March 21, the 80th day of the year,
so we have to shift the curve 80 units to the right. In addition, we shift it 12 units
upward. Therefore we model the length of daylight in Philadelphia on the tth day of the
year by the function
Another transformation of some interest is taking the absolute value of a function. If
, then according to the deﬁnition of absolute value, 
when 
and
when 
. This tells us how to get the graph of 
from the graph
of 
: The part of the graph that lies above the -axis remains the same; the part that
lies below the -axis is reﬂected about the -axis.
The absolute value of a function
Sketch the graph of the function 
.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst graph the parabola 
in Figure 10(a) by shifting the parabola
downward 1 unit. We see that the graph lies below the -axis when 
,
so we reﬂect that part of the graph about the -axis to obtain the graph of 
in Figure 10(b).
Combinations of Functions
Two functions 
and can be combined to form new functions 
, 
, 
, and 
in a manner similar to the way we add, subtract, multiply, and divide real numbers. The
sum and difference functions are deﬁned by
If the domain of 
is A and the domain of is B, then the domain of 
is the intersec-
tion 
because both 
and 
have to be deﬁned. For example, the domain of
is 
and the domain of 
is 
, so the domain
of 
is 
.
Similarly, the product and quotient functions are deﬁned by
The domain of 
is 
, but we can’t divide by 0 and so the domain of 
is
. For instance, if 
and 
, then the domain of
the rational function 
is 
, or 
. 
There is another way of combining two functions to obtain a new function. For 
example, suppose that

and u is, in turn, a function of x, it follows that is ultimately a function of x. We compute
this by substitution:
The procedure is called composition because the new function is composed of the two
given functions 
and .
In general, given any two functions 
and , we start with a number x in the domain of
and find its image 
. If this number 
is in the domain of , then we can calculate
the value of

obtained by substituting

the composition of

In this section we assume that you have access to a graphing calculator or a computer with
graphing software. We will see that the use of such a device enables us to graph more com-
plicated functions and to solve more complex problems than would otherwise be possible.
We also point out some of the pitfalls that can occur with these machines.
Graphing calculators and computers can give very accurate graphs of functions. But we
will see in Chapter 4 that only through the use of calculus can we be sure that we have
uncovered all the interesting aspects of a graph.
A graphing calculator or computer displays a rectangular portion of the graph of a func-
tion in a display window or viewing screen, which we refer to as a viewing rectangle.
The default screen often gives an incomplete or misleading picture, so it is important to
choose the viewing rectangle with care. If we choose the -values to range from a mini-
mum value of 
to a maximum value of 
and the -values to range from
a minimum of 
to a maximum of 
, then the visible portion of the graph
lies in the rectangle
shown in Figure 1. We refer to this rectangle as the
by 
viewing rectangle.
The machine draws the graph of a function 
much as you would. It plots points of the
form 
for a certain number of equally spaced values of 
between 
and . If an 
-value is not in the domain of , or if 
lies outside the viewing rectangle, it moves on
to the next -value. The machine connects each point to the preceding plotted point to form
a representation of the graph of .
Choosing a good viewing rectangle Draw the graph of the function
in each of the following viewing rectangles.

SOLUTION For part (a) we select the range by setting min

, 
min
and max
. The resulting graph is shown in Figure 2(a). The display
window is blank! A moment’s thought provides the explanation: Notice that 
for
all , so 
for all . Thus the range of the function 
is 
.
This means that the graph of 
lies entirely outside the viewing rectangle 
by
.
The graphs for the viewing rectangles in parts (b), (c), and (d) are also shown in 
Figure 2. Observe that we get a more complete picture in parts (c) and (d), but in part (d)
it is not clear that the -intercept is 3.
We see from Example 1 that the choice of a viewing rectangle can make a big differ-
ence in the appearance of a graph. Often it’s necessary to change to a larger viewing 
rectangle to obtain a more complete picture, a more global view, of the graph. In the next
example we see that knowledge of the domain and range of a function sometimes provides
us with enough information to select a good viewing rectangle.
Determine an appropriate viewing rectangle for the function
and use it to graph .
SOLUTION The expression for 
is defined when
Therefore the domain of 
is the interval 
. Also,
so the range of 
is the interval 
.
We choose the viewing rectangle so that the -interval is somewhat larger than the
domain and the -interval is larger than the range. Taking the viewing rectangle to be
by 
, we get the graph shown in Figure 3.
Graph the function 
.
SOLUTION Here the domain is , the set of all real numbers. That doesn’t help us choose
a viewing rectangle. Let’s experiment. If we start with the viewing rectangle 
by
, we get the graph in Figure 4. It appears blank, but actually the graph is so
nearly vertical that it blends in with the -axis.
If we change the viewing rectangle to 
by 
, we get the picture
shown in Figure 5(a). The graph appears to consist of vertical lines, but we know that

can’t be correct. If we look carefully while the graph is being drawn, we see that the
graph leaves the screen and reappears during the graphing process. This indicates that 
we need to see more in the vertical direction, so we change the viewing rectangle to
by 
. The resulting graph is shown in Figure 5(b). It still doesn’t
quite reveal all the main features of the function, so we try 
by 
in Figure 5(c). Now we are more confident that we have arrived at an appropriate view-
ing rectangle. In Chapter 4 we will be able to see that the graph shown in Figure 5(c)
does indeed reveal all the main features of the function.
Graph the function 
in an appropriate viewing rectangle.
SOLUTION Figure 6(a) shows the graph of 
produced by a graphing calculator using the
viewing rectangle 
by 
. At first glance the graph appears to be rea-
sonable. But if we change the viewing rectangle to the ones shown in the following parts
of Figure 6, the graphs look very different. Something strange is happening.
In order to explain the big differences in appearance of these graphs and to find an
appropriate viewing rectangle, we need to find the period of the function 
We know that the function 
has period 
and the graph of 
is 
shrunk horizontally by a factor of 50, so the period of 
is

The appearance of the graphs in Figure 6
depends on the machine used. The graphs you
get with your own graphing device might not
look like these figures, but they will also be
quite inaccurate.

This suggests that we should deal only with small values of in order to show just a few
oscillations of the graph. If we choose the viewing rectangle 
by 
,
we get the graph shown in Figure 7.
Now we see what went wrong in Figure 6. The oscillations of
are so rapid
that when the calculator plots points and joins them, it misses most of the maximum and
minimum points and therefore gives a very misleading impression of the graph.
We have seen that the use of an inappropriate viewing rectangle can give a misleading
impression of the graph of a function. In Examples 1 and 3 we solved the problem by
changing to a larger viewing rectangle. In Example 4 we had to make the viewing rect-
angle smaller. In the next example we look at a function for which there is no single view-
ing rectangle that reveals the true shape of the graph.
Sometimes one graph is not enough
Graph the function 
.
SOLUTION Figure 8 shows the graph of 
produced by a graphing calculator with viewing
rectangle 
by 
. It looks much like the graph of 
, but per-
haps with some bumps attached. If we zoom in to the viewing rectangle 
by
, we can see much more clearly the shape of these bumps in Figure 9. The
reason for this behavior is that the second term, 
, is very small in comparison
with the first term, 
. Thus we really need two graphs to see the true nature of this
function.
Eliminating an extraneous line Draw the graph of the function 
.
SOLUTION Figure 10(a) shows the graph produced by a graphing calculator with view-
ing rectangle 
by 
. In connecting successive points on the graph, the 
calculator produced a steep line segment from the top to the bottom of the screen. That
line segment is not truly part of the graph. Notice that the domain of the function
is 
. We can eliminate the extraneous near-vertical line by
experimenting with a change of scale. When we change to the smaller viewing rectangle
by 
on this particular calculator, we obtain the much better graph
in Figure 10(b).

Another way to avoid the extraneous line is to
change the graphing mode on the calculator so
that the dots are not connected.

How to get the complete graph of the cube root function
Graph the function 
.
SOLUTION Some graphing devices display the graph shown in Figure 11, whereas others
produce a graph like that in Figure 12. We know from Section 1.2 (Figure 13) that the
graph in Figure 12 is correct, so what happened in Figure 11? The explanation is that
some machines compute the cube root of using a logarithm, which is not defined if 
is negative, so only the right half of the graph is produced.
You should experiment with your own machine to see which of these two graphs is
produced. If you get the graph in Figure 11, you can obtain the correct picture by graph-
ing the function 
Notice that this function is equal to 
(except when 
).
To understand how the expression for a function relates to its graph, it’s helpful to graph
a family of functions, that is, a collection of functions whose equations are related. In the
next example we graph members of a family of cubic polynomials.
A family of cubic polynomials Graph the function 
for various
values of the number . How does the graph change when is changed?
SOLUTION Figure 13 shows the graphs of 
for 
, , , 
, and 
. We
see that, for positive values of , the graph increases from left to right with no maximum
or minimum points (peaks or valleys). When 
, the curve is flat at the origin. When
is negative, the curve has a maximum point and a minimum point. As decreases, the
maximum point becomes higher and the minimum point lower.
Solving an equation graphically Find the solution of the equation 
correct to two decimal places.
SOLUTION The solutions of the equation 
are the -coordinates of the points of
intersection of the curves 
and

only one solution and it lies between 0 and 1. Zooming in to the viewing rectangle

, we see from Figure 14(b) that the root lies between 0.7 and 0.8. So we zoom in
further to the viewing rectangle

in Figure 14(c). By moving the
cursor to the intersection point of the two curves, or by inspection and the fact that the

The function 
is called an exponential function because the variable, x, is the
exponent. It should not be confused with the power function 
, in which the vari-
able is the base.

But what is the meaning of

To help us answer this question we ﬁrst look at the graph of the function

x is rational. A representation of this graph is shown in Figure 1. We want to enlarge the
domain of

There are holes in the graph in Figure 1 corresponding to irrational values of x. We want
to ﬁll in the holes by deﬁning

In particular, since the irrational number 
satisﬁes

CHAPTER 1
FUNCTIONS AND MODELS
The graphs of members of the family of functions 
are shown in Figure 3 for var-
ious values of the base a. Notice that all of these graphs pass through the same point 
because 
for 
. Notice also that as the base a gets larger, the exponential func-
tion grows more rapidly (for 
).
You can see from Figure 3 that there are basically three kinds of exponential functions
. If 
, the exponential function decreases; if 
, it is a constant; and if
, it increases. These three cases are illustrated in Figure 4. Observe that if 
,
then the exponential function 
has domain  and range 
. Notice also that,
since 
, the graph of 
is just the reﬂection of the graph of
about the -axis.
One reason for the importance of the exponential function lies in the following proper-
ties. If x and y are rational numbers, then these laws are well known from elementary 
algebra. It can be proved that they remain true for arbitrary real numbers x and y.

Applications of Exponential Functions
The exponential function occurs very frequently in mathematical models of nature and
society. Here we indicate brieﬂy how it arises in the description of population growth. 
In later chapters we will pursue these and other applications in greater detail.
First we consider a population of bacteria in a homogeneous nutrient medium. Suppose
that by sampling the population at certain intervals it is determined that the population
doubles every hour. If the number of bacteria at time t is 
, where t is measured in hours,
and the initial population is 
, then we have

Example 2 shows that 
increases more
quickly than 
. To demonstrate just how
quickly 
increases, let’s perform the
following thought experiment. Suppose we start
with a piece of paper a thousandth of an inch
thick and we fold it in half 50 times. Each time
we fold the paper in half, the thickness of the
paper doubles, so the thickness of the resulting
paper would be 
inches. How thick do 
you think that is? It works out to be more than
17 million miles!

CHAPTER 1
FUNCTIONS AND MODELS
It seems from this pattern that, in general,
This population function is a constant multiple of the exponential function 
, so it
exhibits the rapid growth that we observed in Figures 2 and 7. Under ideal conditions
(unlimited space and nutrition and freedom from disease) this exponential growth is typi-
cal of what actually occurs in nature.
What about the human population? Table 1 shows data for the population of the world
in the 20th century and Figure 8 shows the corresponding scatter plot.
The pattern of the data points in Figure 8 suggests exponential growth, so we use a
graphing calculator with exponential regression capability to apply the method of least
squares and obtain the exponential model
Figure 9 shows the graph of this exponential function together with the original data
points. We see that the exponential curve ﬁts the data reasonably well. The period of rela-
tively slow population growth is explained by the two world wars and the Great Depres-
sion of the 1930s.
The half-life of strontium-90, 
, is 25 years. This means that half of
any given quantity of 
will disintegrate in 25 years.
(a) If a sample of 
has a mass of 24 mg, ﬁnd an expression for the mass 
that

(b) Find the mass remaining after 40 years, correct to the nearest milligram.

and use the graph to estimate the time required
for the mass to be reduced to 5 mg.

SOLUTION
(a) The mass is initially 24 mg and is halved during each 25-year period, so
From this pattern, it appears that the mass remaining after t years is
This is an exponential function with base 
.
(b) The mass that remains after 40 years is
(c) We use a graphing calculator or computer to graph the function 
in
Figure 10. We also graph the line 
and use the cursor to estimate that 
when 
. So the mass of the sample will be reduced to 5 mg after about 57 years.
The Number e
Of all possible bases for an exponential function, there is one that is most convenient for
the purposes of calculus. The choice of a base a is inﬂuenced by the way the graph of
crosses the y-axis. Figures 11 and 12 show the tangent lines to the graphs of 
and 
at the point 
. (Tangent lines will be deﬁned precisely in Section 2.6. For
present purposes, you can think of the tangent line to an exponential graph at a point as the
line that touches the graph only at that point.) If we measure the slopes of these tangent
lines at 
, we ﬁnd that 
for 
and 
for

It turns out, as we will see in Chapter 3, that some of the formulas of calculus will be
greatly simpliﬁed if we choose the base a so that the slope of the tangent line to 
at
is exactly 1. (See Figure 13.) In fact, there is such a number and it is denoted by the
letter e. (This notation was chosen by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1727,
probably because it is the ﬁrst letter of the word exponential.) In view of Figures 11 and
12, it comes as no surprise that the number e lies between 2 and 3 and the graph of 
lies between the graphs of 
and 
. (See Figure 14.) In Chapter 3 we will see
that the value of e, correct to ﬁve decimal places, is
We call the function 
the natural exponential function.
Transforming the natural exponential function Graph the function
and state the domain and range.
SOLUTION We start with the graph of 
from Figures 13 and 15(a) and reﬂect about
the y-axis to get the graph of 
in Figure 15(b). (Notice that the graph crosses the
y-axis with a slope of 1). Then we compress the graph vertically by a factor of 2 to
obtain the graph of 
in Figure 15(c). Finally, we shift the graph downward one
unit to get the desired graph in Figure 15(d). The domain is 
and the range is 
.
How far to the right do you think we would have to go for the height of the graph of
to exceed a million? The next example demonstrates the rapid growth of this func-
tion by providing an answer that might surprise you.

Table 1 gives data from an experiment in which a bacteria culture started with 100 bacte-
ria in a limited nutrient medium; the size of the bacteria population was recorded at hourly
intervals. The number of bacteria N is a function of the time t: 
.
Suppose, however, that the biologist changes her point of view and becomes interested
in the time required for the population to reach various levels. In other words, she is think-
ing of t as a function of N. This function is called the inverse function of f, denoted by
,
and read “f inverse.” Thus 
is the time required for the population level to reach
N. The values of 
can be found by reading Table 1 from right to left or by consulting
Table 2. For instance, 
because 
Not all functions possess inverses. Let’s compare the functions 
and 
whose arrow
diagrams are shown in Figure 1. Note that

inputs in 
have different outputs), whereas 
does take on the same value twice (both 2
and 3 have the same output, 4). In symbols,
but
Functions that share this property with 
are called one-to-one functions.
Deﬁnition A function 
is called a one-to-one function if it never takes on the
same value twice; that is,
If a horizontal line intersects the graph of 
in more than one point, then we see from
Figure 2 that there are numbers 
and 
such that 
. This means that is not
one-to-one. Therefore we have the following geometric method for determining whether a
function is one-to-one.

sects its graph more than once.

Is the function 
one-to-one?
SOLUTION 1 If 
, then 
(two different numbers can’t have the same cube).
Therefore, by Deﬁnition 1, 
is one-to-one.
SOLUTION 2 From Figure 3 we see that no horizontal line intersects the graph of
more than once. Therefore, by the Horizontal Line Test, 
is one-to-one.
Is the function 
one-to-one?
SOLUTION 1 This function is not one-to-one because, for instance,
and so 1 and 
have the same output.
SOLUTION 2 From Figure 4 we see that there are horizontal lines that intersect the graph
of more than once. Therefore, by the Horizontal Line Test, is not one-to-one.
One-to-one functions are important because they are precisely the functions that pos-
sess inverse functions according to the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition Let 
be a one-to-one function with domain 
and range . Then
its inverse function
has domain 
and range 
and is deﬁned by
for any in .
This deﬁnition says that if 
maps into , then 
maps back into . (If 
were not
one-to-one, then 
would not be uniquely deﬁned.) The arrow diagram in Figure 5 indi-
cates that 
reverses the effect of . Note that
For example, the inverse function of

SOLUTION From the deﬁnition of 
we have
The diagram in Figure 6 makes it clear how 
reverses the effect of 
in this case.
The letter is traditionally used as the independent variable, so when we concentrate on
rather than on , we usually reverse the roles of 
and 
in Deﬁnition 2 and write
By substituting for in Deﬁnition 2 and substituting for in (3), we get the following
cancellation equations:
The ﬁrst cancellation equation says that if we start with , apply , and then apply 
we
arrive back at , where we started (see the machine diagram in Figure 7). Thus 
undoes
what 
does. The second equation says that 
undoes what 
does.
For example, if 
, then 
and so the cancellation equations become
These equations simply say that the cube function and the cube root function cancel each
other when applied in succession.
Now let’s see how to compute inverse functions. If we have a function

able to solve this equation for in terms of , then according to Deﬁnition 2 we must have

How to Find the Inverse Function of a One-to-One Function f
Step 1
Write 
.
Step 2
Solve this equation for in terms of (if possible).
Step 3
To express 
as a function of x, interchange and . 
The resulting equation is 
.
Find the inverse function of

SOLUTION According to (5) we ﬁrst write
Then we solve this equation for :
Finally, we interchange and :
Therefore the inverse function is 
.
The principle of interchanging 
and 
to ﬁnd the inverse function also gives us the
method for obtaining the graph of 
from the graph of . Since 
if and only if
, the point 
is on the graph of 
if and only if the point 
is on the
graph of

from 
by reﬂecting about the line

Figure 8.)
Therefore, as illustrated by Figure 9:
The graph of 
is obtained by reﬂecting the graph of 
about the line

SOLUTION First we sketch the curve

graph of

and this seems reasonable from Figure 10.
Logarithmic Functions
If 
and 
, the exponential function 
is either increasing or decreasing
and so it is one-to-one by the Horizontal Line Test. It therefore has an inverse function 
,
which is called the logarithmic function with base a and is denoted by 
. If we use
the formulation of an inverse function given by (3),
then we have 
Thus, if 
, then 
is the exponent to which the base must be raised to give . For
example, 
because 
.
The cancellation equations (4), when applied to the functions 
and
, become
The logarithmic function 
has domain 
and range . Its graph is the reﬂection
of the graph of 
about the line 
.
Figure 11 shows the case where 
. (The most important logarithmic functions have
base 
.) The fact that 
is a very rapidly increasing function for 
is 
reﬂected in the fact that 
is a very slowly increasing function for 
.
Figure 12 shows the graphs of 
with various values of the base 
. Since
, the graphs of all logarithmic functions pass through the point 
.
The following properties of logarithmic functions follow from the corresponding prop-
erties of exponential functions given in Section 1.5.

Natural Logarithms
Of all possible bases 
for logarithms, we will see in Chapter 3 that the most convenient
choice of a base is the number , which was deﬁned in Section 1.5. The logarithm with
base is called the natural logarithm and has a special notation:
If we put 
and replace 
with “ln” in (6) and (7), then the deﬁning properties
of the natural logarithm function become
In particular, if we set 
, we get
Find if 
.
SOLUTION 1 From (8) we see that
Therefore 
.
(If you have trouble working with the “ln” notation, just replace it by 
. Then the
equation becomes 
; so, by the deﬁnition of logarithm, 
.)
SOLUTION 2 Start with the equation
and apply the exponential function to both sides of the equation:
But the second cancellation equation in (9) says that 
. Therefore 
.
Solve the equation 
.
SOLUTION We take natural logarithms of both sides of the equation and use (9):

Notation for Logarithms
Most textbooks in calculus and the sciences, as
well as calculators, use the notation 
for the
natural logarithm and 
for the “common
logarithm,”

Since the natural logarithm is found on scientiﬁc calculators, we can approximate the
solution: to four decimal places, 
.
Using the Laws of Logarithms Express 
as a single logarithm.
SOLUTION Using Laws 3 and 1 of logarithms, we have
The following formula shows that logarithms with any base can be expressed in terms
of the natural logarithm.
Change of Base Formula For any positive number 
, we have
PROOF Let 
. Then, from (6), we have 
. Taking natural logarithms of
both sides of this equation, we get 
. Therefore
Scientiﬁc calculators have a key for natural logarithms, so Formula 10 enables us to use
a calculator to compute a logarithm with any base (as shown in the following example).
Similarly, Formula 10 allows us to graph any logarithmic function on a graphing calcula-
tor or computer (see Exercises 43 and 44).
Evaluate 
correct to six decimal places.
SOLUTION Formula 10 gives
Interpreting an inverse function In Example 3 in Section 1.5 we showed that 
the mass of 
that remains from a 24-mg sample after
years is 
.
Find the inverse of this function and interpret it.
SOLUTION We need to solve the equation 
for t. We start by isolating the
exponential and taking natural logarithms of both sides:

So the inverse function is
This function gives the time required for the mass to decay to m milligrams. In particu-
lar, the time required for the mass to be reduced to 5 mg is
This answer agrees with the graphical estimate that we made in Example 3(c) in
Section 1.5.
Graph and Growth of the Natural Logarithm
The graphs of the exponential function 
and its inverse function, the natural loga-
rithm function, are shown in Figure 13. Because the curve 
crosses the y-axis with
a slope of 1, it follows that the reﬂected curve 
crosses the x-axis with a slope of 1.
In common with all other logarithmic functions with base greater than 1, the natural
logarithm is an increasing function deﬁned on 
and the y-axis is a vertical asymptote.
(This means that the values of 
become very large negative as approaches 0.)
Shifting the natural logarithm function
Sketch the graph of the function 
.
SOLUTION We start with the graph of 
as given in Figure 13. Using the transfor-
mations of Section 1.3, we shift it 2 units to the right to get the graph of 
and then we shift it 1 unit downward to get the graph of 
. (See Fig-

grows more slowly than any positive power of . To illustrate this fact, we compare
approximate values of the functions

Imagine that a particle moves along the curve C shown in Figure 1. It is impossible to
describe C by an equation of the form 
because C fails the Vertical Line Test. But
the x- and y-coordinates of the particle are functions of time and so we can write 
and 
. Such a pair of equations is often a convenient way of describing a curve and
gives rise to the following deﬁnition.
Suppose that and are both given as functions of a third variable (called a param-
eter) by the equations
(called parametric equations). Each value of determines a point 
, which we can
plot in a coordinate plane. As varies, the point 
varies and traces out
a curve , which we call a parametric curve. The parameter t does not necessarily repre-
sent time and, in fact, we could use a letter other than t for the parameter. But in many
applications of parametric curves, t does denote time and therefore we can interpret
as the position of a particle at time t.

Graphing a parametric curve Sketch and identify the curve defined by the
parametric equations
SOLUTION Each value of gives a point on the curve, as shown in the table. For instance,
if 
, then 
, 
and so the corresponding point is 
. In Figure 2 we plot
the points 
determined by several values of the parameter and we join them to pro-
duce a curve.
A particle whose position is given by the parametric equations moves along the curve
in the direction of the arrows as increases. Notice that the consecutive points marked on
the curve appear at equal time intervals but not at equal distances. That is because the
particle slows down and then speeds up as increases.
It appears from Figure 2 that the curve traced out by the particle may be a parabola.
This can be confirmed by eliminating the parameter as follows. We obtain 
from the second equation and substitute into the first equation. This gives
and so the curve represented by the given parametric equations is the parabola
.
No restriction was placed on the parameter in Example 1, so we assumed that t could
be any real number. But sometimes we restrict t to lie in a finite interval. For instance, the
parametric curve
shown in Figure 3 is the part of the parabola in Example 1 that starts at the point 
and
ends at the point 
. The arrowhead indicates the direction in which the curve is traced
as increases from 0 to 4.
In general, the curve with parametric equations
has initial point 
and terminal point
.

SOLUTION If we plot points, it appears that the curve is a circle. We can confirm this
impression by eliminating 
Observe that
Thus the point 
moves on the unit circle 
. Notice that in this example
the parameter can be interpreted as the angle (in radians) shown in Figure 4. As 
increases from 0 to 
, the point 
moves once around the circle in
the counterclockwise direction starting from the point 
.
What curve is represented by the given parametric equations?
SOLUTION Again we have
so the parametric equations again represent the unit circle 
. But as 
increases from 0 to 
, the point 
starts at 
and moves twice
around the circle in the clockwise direction as indicated in Figure 5.
Examples 2 and 3 show that different sets of parametric equations can represent the
same curve. Thus we distinguish between a curve, which is a set of points, and a parametric
curve, in which the points are traced in a particular way.
Find parametric equations for the circle with center 
and radius .
SOLUTION If we take the equations of the unit circle in Example 2 and multiply the
expressions for and by , we get 
, 
. You can verify that these
equations represent a circle with radius and center the origin traced counterclockwise.
We now shift units in the -direction and units in the -direction and obtain para-
metric equations of the circle (Figure 6) with center 
and radius :
Sketch the curve with parametric equations 
, 
.
SOLUTION Observe that 
and so the point 
moves on the parabola
. But note also that, since 
, we have 
, so the para-
metric equations represent only the part of the parabola for which 
. Since
is periodic, the point 
moves back and forth infinitely often
along the parabola from 
to

Graphing Devices
Most graphing calculators and computer graphing programs can be used to graph curves
defined by parametric equations. In fact, it’s instructive to watch a parametric curve being
drawn by a graphing calculator because the points are plotted in order as the correspond-
ing parameter values increase.
Graphing as a function of 
Use a graphing device to graph the curve 
.
SOLUTION If we let the parameter be 
, then we have the equations
Using these parametric equations to graph the curve, we obtain Figure 9. It would be
possible to solve the given equation 
for y as four functions of x and
graph them individually, but the parametric equations provide a much easier method.
In general, if we need to graph an equation of the form 
, we can use the para-
metric equations
Notice also that curves with equations 
(the ones we are most familiar with—
graphs of functions) can also be regarded as curves with parametric equations
Graphing devices are particularly useful when sketching complicated curves. For 
instance, the curves shown in Figures 10, 11, and 12 would be virtually impossible to pro-
duce by hand.

PARAMETRIC CURVES

One of the most important uses of parametric curves is in computer-aided design
(CAD). In the Laboratory Project after Section 3.4 we will investigate special parametric
curves, called Bézier curves, that are used extensively in manufacturing, especially in the
automotive industry. These curves are also employed in specifying the shapes of letters and
other symbols in laser printers.
The Cycloid
Deriving parametric equations for a cycloid The curve traced out by a point 
on the circumference of a circle as the circle rolls along a straight line is called a cycloid
(see Figure 13). If the circle has radius and rolls along the -axis and if one position of
is the origin, find parametric equations for the cycloid.
SOLUTION We choose as parameter the angle of rotation 
of the circle 
when 
is
at the origin). Suppose the circle has rotated through 
radians. Because the circle has
been in contact with the line, we see from Figure 14 that the distance it has rolled from
the origin is
Therefore the center of the circle is 
. Let the coordinates of 
be 
. Then
from Figure 14 we see that
Therefore parametric equations of the cycloid are
One arch of the cycloid comes from one rotation of the circle and so is described by
. Although Equations 1 were derived from Figure 14, which illustrates the
case where 
, it can be seen that these equations are still valid for other
values of (see Exercise 37).

Exercises
Although it is possible to eliminate the parameter 
from Equations 1, the resulting
Cartesian equation in and is very complicated and not as convenient to work with as
the parametric equations.
One of the first people to study the cycloid was Galileo, who proposed that bridges be
built in the shape of cycloids and who tried to find the area under one arch of a cycloid.
Later this curve arose in connection with the brachistochrone problem: Find the curve
along which a particle will slide in the shortest time (under the influence of gravity) from
a point 
to a lower point 
not directly beneath 
. The Swiss mathematician John
Bernoulli, who posed this problem in 1696, showed that among all possible curves that
join 
to , as in Figure 15, the particle will take the least time sliding from 
to 
if the
curve is part of an inverted arch of a cycloid.
The Dutch physicist Huygens had already shown that the cycloid is also the solution to
the tautochrone problem; that is, no matter where a particle 
is placed on an inverted
cycloid, it takes the same time to slide to the bottom (see Figure 16). Huygens proposed
that pendulum clocks (which he invented) should swing in cycloidal arcs because then the
pendulum would take the same time to make a complete oscillation whether it swings
through a wide or a small arc.

Principles of Problem Solving
There are no hard and fast rules that will ensure success in solving problems. However, it
is possible to outline some general steps in the problem-solving process and to give some
principles that may be useful in the solution of certain problems. These steps and principles
are just common sense made explicit. They have been adapted from George Polya’s book
How To Solve It.
The first step is to read the problem and make sure that you understand it clearly. Ask your-
self the following questions:
For many problems it is useful to
draw a diagram
and identify the given and required quantities on the diagram.
Usually it is necessary to
introduce suitable notation
In choosing symbols for the unknown quantities we often use letters such as a, b, c, m, n,
x, and y, but in some cases it helps to use initials as suggestive symbols; for instance, 
for
volume or for time.
Think of a Plan
Find a connection between the given information and the unknown that will enable you to
calculate the unknown. It often helps to ask yourself explicitly: “How can I relate the given
to the unknown?” If you don’t see a connection immediately, the following ideas may be
helpful in devising a plan.
Try to Recognize Something Familiar Relate the given situation to previous knowledge.
Look at the unknown and try to recall a more familiar problem that has a similar unknown.
Try to Recognize Patterns Some problems are solved by recognizing that some kind of
pattern is occurring. The pattern could be geometric, or numerical, or algebraic. If you can
see regularity or repetition in a problem, you might be able to guess what the continuing
pattern is and then prove it.
Use Analogy Try to think of an analogous problem, that is, a similar problem, a related
problem, but one that is easier than the original problem. If you can solve the similar, sim-
pler problem, then it might give you the clues you need to solve the original, more difficult
problem. For instance, if a problem involves very large numbers, you could first try a sim-
ilar problem with smaller numbers. Or if the problem involves three-dimensional geome-
try, you could look for a similar problem in two-dimensional geometry. Or if the problem
you start with is a general one, you could first try a special case.
Introduce Something Extra It may sometimes be necessary to introduce something new,
an auxiliary aid, to help make the connection between the given and the unknown. For
instance, in a problem where a diagram is useful the auxiliary aid could be a new line drawn
in a diagram. In a more algebraic problem it could be a new unknown that is related to the
original unknown.

83

Take Cases We may sometimes have to split a problem into several cases and give a dif-
ferent argument for each of the cases. For instance, we often have to use this strategy in
dealing with absolute value.
Work Backward Sometimes it is useful to imagine that your problem is solved and work
backward, step by step, until you arrive at the given data. Then you may be able to reverse
your steps and thereby construct a solution to the original problem. This procedure is com-
monly used in solving equations. For instance, in solving the equation 
, we sup-
pose that is a number that satisfies 
and work backward. We add 5 to each side
of the equation and then divide each side by 3 to get 
. Since each of these steps can
be reversed, we have solved the problem.
Establish Subgoals In a complex problem it is often useful to set subgoals (in which the
desired situation is only partially fulfilled). If we can first reach these subgoals, then we
may be able to build on them to reach our final goal.
Indirect Reasoning Sometimes it is appropriate to attack a problem indirectly. In using
proof by contradiction to prove that 
implies , we assume that 
is true and 
is false and
try to see why this can’t happen. Somehow we have to use this information and arrive at a
contradiction to what we absolutely know is true.
Mathematical Induction In proving statements that involve a positive integer , it is fre-
quently helpful to use the following principle.
Principle of Mathematical Induction Let 
be a statement about the positive integer .
Suppose that
1.
is true.
2.
is true whenever 
is true.
Then 
is true for all positive integers .
This is reasonable because, since 
is true, it follows from condition 2 (with 
) 
that 
is true. Then, using condition 2 with 
, we see that 
is true. Again using 
condition 2, this time with 
, we have that 
is true. This procedure can be followed
indefinitely.
Carry Out the Plan
In Step 2 a plan was devised. In carrying out that plan we have to check each stage of the
plan and write the details that prove that each stage is correct.
Look Back
Having completed our solution, it is wise to look back over it, partly to see if we have made
errors in the solution and partly to see if we can think of an easier way to solve the prob-
lem. Another reason for looking back is that it will familiarize us with the method of solu-
tion and this may be useful for solving a future problem. Descartes said, “Every problem
that I solved became a rule which served afterwards to solve other problems.”
These principles of problem solving are illustrated in the following examples. Before
you look at the solutions, try to solve these problems yourself, referring to these Principles
of Problem Solving if you get stuck. You may find it useful to refer to this section from time
to time as you solve the exercises in the remaining chapters of this book.

Express the hypotenuse of a right triangle with area 
as a function of
its perimeter P.
SOLUTION Let’s first sort out the information by identifying the unknown quantity and the
data:
It helps to draw a diagram and we do so in Figure 1.
In order to connect the given quantities to the unknown, we introduce two extra vari-
ables 
and , which are the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle. This enables us
to express the given condition, which is that the triangle is right-angled, by the Pythago-
rean Theorem:
The other connections among the variables come by writing expressions for the area and
perimeter:
Since 
is given, notice that we now have three equations in the three unknowns , , 
and :
Although we have the correct number of equations, they are not easy to solve in a
straightforward fashion. But if we use the problem-solving strategy of trying to recognize
something familiar, then we can solve these equations by an easier method. Look at the
right sides of Equations 1, 2, and 3. Do these expressions remind you of anything famil-
iar? Notice that they contain the ingredients of a familiar formula:
Using this idea, we express 
in two ways. From Equations 1 and 2 we have
From Equation 3 we have

It follows that

These expressions show that we must consider three cases:

In the following example we first guess the answer by looking at special cases and rec-
ognizing a pattern. Then we prove our conjecture by mathematical induction.
In using the Principle of Mathematical Induction, we follow three steps:
Step 1 Prove that

Step 2 Assume that

Limits and Derivatives
In A Preview of Calculus (page 3) we saw how the idea of a limit underlies the
various branches of calculus. Thus it is appropriate to begin our study of calculus
by investigating limits and their properties. The special type of limit that is used
to ﬁnd tangents and velocities gives rise to the central idea in differential calcu-
lus, the derivative. We see how derivatives can be interpreted as rates of change
in various situations and learn how the derivative of a function gives information
about the original function.

CHAPTER 2
LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES
In this section we see how limits arise when we attempt to ﬁnd the tangent to a curve or
the velocity of an object.
The Tangent Problem
The word tangent is derived from the Latin word tangens, which means “touching.” Thus
a tangent to a curve is a line that touches the curve. In other words, a tangent line should
have the same direction as the curve at the point of contact. How can this idea be made
precise?
For a circle we could simply follow Euclid and say that a tangent is a line that intersects
the circle once and only once, as in Figure 1(a). For more complicated curves this deﬁni-
tion is inadequate. Figure l(b) shows two lines and passing through a point 
on a curve
. The line intersects 
only once, but it certainly does not look like what we think of as
a tangent. The line , on the other hand, looks like a tangent but it intersects 
twice.
To be speciﬁc, let’s look at the problem of trying to ﬁnd a tangent line to the parabola
in the following example.
Find an equation of the tangent line to the parabola 
at the 
point 
.
SOLUTION We will be able to ﬁnd an equation of the tangent line as soon as we know
its slope . The difﬁculty is that we know only one point, , on , whereas we need two
points to compute the slope. But observe that we can compute an approximation to 
by
choosing a nearby point 
on the parabola (as in Figure 2) and computing the
slope 
of the secant line 
. [A secant line, from the Latin word secans, meaning
cutting, is a line that cuts (intersects) a curve more than once.]
We choose 
so that 
. Then
For instance, for the point 
we have
The tables in the margin show the values of 
for several values of close to 1. The
closer 
is to , the closer is to 1 and, it appears from the tables, the closer 
is to 2.
This suggests that the slope of the tangent line should be 
.
We say that the slope of the tangent line is the limit of the slopes of the secant lines,
and we express this symbolically by writing
and
Assuming that the slope of the tangent line is indeed 2, we use the point-slope form
of the equation of a line (see Appendix B) to write the equation of the tangent line

Figure 3 illustrates the limiting process that occurs in this example. As 
approaches
along the parabola, the corresponding secant lines rotate about 
and approach the
tangent line .
Many functions that occur in science are not described by explicit equations; they are
deﬁned by experimental data. The next example shows how to estimate the slope of the
tangent line to the graph of such a function.
Estimating the slope of a tangent line from experimental data
The ﬂash unit
on a camera operates by storing charge on a capacitor and releasing it suddenly when the
ﬂash is set off. The data in the table describe the charge Q remaining on the capacitor
(measured in microcoulombs) at time t (measured in seconds after the ﬂash goes off).
Use the data to draw the graph of this function and estimate the slope of the tangent line
at the point where t  0.04. [Note: The slope of the tangent line represents the electric
current ﬂowing from the capacitor to the ﬂash bulb (measured in microamperes).]
SOLUTION In Figure 4 we plot the given data and use them to sketch a curve that approx-
imates the graph of the function.

CHAPTER 2
LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES
Given the points 
and 
on the graph, we ﬁnd that the
slope of the secant line PR is
The table at the left shows the results of similar calculations for the slopes of other
secant lines. From this table we would expect the slope of the tangent line at 
to
lie somewhere between 742 and 607.5. In fact, the average of the slopes of the two
closest secant lines is
So, by this method, we estimate the slope of the tangent line to be 675.
Another method is to draw an approximation to the tangent line at P and measure the
sides of the triangle ABC, as in Figure 4. This gives an estimate of the slope of the tan-
gent line as
The Velocity Problem
If you watch the speedometer of a car as you travel in city trafﬁc, you see that the needle
doesn’t stay still for very long; that is, the velocity of the car is not constant. We assume
from watching the speedometer that the car has a deﬁnite velocity at each moment, but
how is the “instantaneous” velocity deﬁned? Let’s investigate the example of a falling ball.
Velocity of a falling ball
Suppose that a ball is dropped from the upper
observation deck of the CN Tower in Toronto, 450 m above the ground. Find the velocity
of the ball after 5 seconds.
SOLUTION Through experiments carried out four centuries ago, Galileo discovered that
the distance fallen by any freely falling body is proportional to the square of the time it
has been falling. (This model for free fall neglects air resistance.) If the distance fallen
after seconds is denoted by 
and measured in meters, then Galileo’s law is expressed
by the equation
The difﬁculty in ﬁnding the velocity after 5 s is that we are dealing with a single
instant of time 
, so no time interval is involved. However, we can approximate the
desired quantity by computing the average velocity over the brief time interval of a tenth
of a second from 
to

SECTION 2.1
THE TANGENT AND VELOCITY PROBLEMS
93
The following table shows the results of similar calculations of the average velocity over
successively smaller time periods.
It appears that as we shorten the time period, the average velocity is becoming closer to
49 ms. The instantaneous velocity when 
is deﬁned to be the limiting value of
these average velocities over shorter and shorter time periods that start at 
. Thus 
the (instantaneous) velocity after 5 s is
You may have the feeling that the calculations used in solving this problem are very sim-
ilar to those used earlier in this section to ﬁnd tangents. In fact, there is a close connec-
tion between the tangent problem and the problem of ﬁnding velocities. If we draw the
graph of the distance function of the ball (as in Figure 5) and we consider the points
and 
on the graph, then the slope of the secant line 
is
which is the same as the average velocity over the time interval 
. Therefore the
velocity at time 
(the limit of these average velocities as 
approaches 0) must be
equal to the slope of the tangent line at 
(the limit of the slopes of the secant lines).
Examples 1 and 3 show that in order to solve tangent and velocity problems we must
be able to ﬁnd limits. After studying methods for computing limits in the next four sec-
tions, we will return to the problems of ﬁnding tangents and velocities in Section 2.6.

SECTION 2.2
THE LIMIT OF A FUNCTION
95
Having seen in the preceding section how limits arise when we want to ﬁnd the tangent to
a curve or the velocity of an object, we now turn our attention to limits in general and
numerical and graphical methods for computing them.
Let’s investigate the behavior of the function 
deﬁned by 
for val-
ues of near 2. The following table gives values of 
for values of close to 2 but not
equal to 2.
From the table and the graph of 
(a parabola) shown in Figure 1 we see that when is
close to 2 (on either side of 2), 
is close to 4. In fact, it appears that we can make the
values of 
as close as we like to 4 by taking 
sufﬁciently close to 2. We express this
by saying “the limit of the function 
as 
approaches 2 is equal to 4.”
The notation for this is
In general, we use the following notation.
Deﬁnition We write
and say
“the limit of 
, as approaches , equals ”
if we can make the values of 
arbitrarily close to 
(as close to L as we like)
by taking x to be sufﬁciently close to (on either side of ) but not equal to .
Roughly speaking, this says that the values of 
tend to get closer and closer to the
number 
as 
gets closer and closer to the number 
(from either side of ) but 
. 
An alternative notation for
is
as
which is usually read “
approaches 
as approaches .”

CHAPTER 2
LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES
Notice the phrase “but 
” in the deﬁnition of limit. This means that in ﬁnding the
limit of 
as 
approaches , we never consider 
. In fact, 
need not even be
deﬁned when 
. The only thing that matters is how 
is deﬁned near .
Figure 2 shows the graphs of three functions. Note that in part (c), 
is not deﬁned
and in part (b), 
. But in each case, regardless of what happens at , it is true that
.
Guessing a limit from numerical values
Guess the value of 
.
SOLUTION Notice that the function 
is not deﬁned when 
,
but that doesn’t matter because the deﬁnition of 
says that we consider values
of that are close to but not equal to .
The tables at the left give values of 
(correct to six decimal places) for values of 
that approach 1 (but are not equal to 1). On the basis of the values in the tables, we make
the guess that
Example 1 is illustrated by the graph of 
in Figure 3. Now let’s change 
slightly by
giving it the value 2 when 
and calling the resulting function :
This new function still has the same limit as approaches 1. (See Figure 4.)

THE LIMIT OF A FUNCTION

Estimate the value of

SOLUTION The table lists values of the function for several values of near 0.
As approaches 0, the values of the function seem to approach 
and so we
guess that
In Example 2 what would have happened if we had taken even smaller values of 
The
table in the margin shows the results from one calculator; you can see that something
strange seems to be happening.
If you try these calculations on your own calculator you might get different values, but
eventually you will get the value 0 if you make sufﬁciently small. Does this mean that
the answer is really 0 instead of ? No, the value of the limit is , as we will show in the
| next section. The problem is that the calculator gave false values because 
is very
close to 3 when is small. (In fact, when is sufﬁciently small, a calculator’s value for
is 
to as many digits as the calculator is capable of carrying.)
Something similar happens when we try to graph the function
of Example 2 on a graphing calculator or computer. Parts (a) and (b) of Figure 5 show quite
accurate graphs of , and when we use the trace mode (if available) we can estimate eas-
ily that the limit is about . But if we zoom in too much, as in parts (c) and (d), then we get
inaccurate graphs, again because of problems with subtraction.

Computer Algebra Systems
Computer algebra systems (CAS) have
commands that compute limits. In order to
avoid the types of pitfalls demonstrated in
Examples 2, 4, and 5, they don’t ﬁnd limits by
numerical experimentation. Instead, they use
more sophisticated techniques such as com-
puting inﬁnite series. If you have access to a
CAS, use the limit command to compute the
limits in the examples of this section and to
check your answers in the exercises of this
chapter.

SECTION 2.2
THE LIMIT OF A FUNCTION
99
The dashed lines near the -axis indicate that the values of 
oscillate between
1 and 
inﬁnitely often as approaches 0. (Use a graphing device to graph 
and zoom
in toward the origin several times. What do you observe?) 
Since the values of 
do not approach a ﬁxed number as approaches 0,
Find 
.
SOLUTION As before, we construct a table of values. From the ﬁrst table in the margin it
appears that
But if we persevere with smaller values of , the second table suggests that
Later we will see that 
; then it follows that the limit is 0.0001.
|
Examples 4 and 5 illustrate some of the pitfalls in guessing the value of a limit. It is easy
to guess the wrong value if we use inappropriate values of , but it is difﬁcult to know
when to stop calculating values. And, as the discussion after Example 2 shows, sometimes
calculators and computers give the wrong values. In the next section, however, we will
develop foolproof methods for calculating limits.
A limit that does not exist
The Heaviside function 
is deﬁned by
[This function is named after the electrical engineer Oliver Heaviside (1850–1925) and
can be used to describe an electric current that is switched on at time 
.] Its graph is
shown in Figure 8.
As approaches 0 from the left, 
approaches 0. As approaches 0 from the right,
approaches 1. There is no single number that 
approaches as
approaches 0.
Therefore, 
does not exist.
One-Sided Limits
We noticed in Example 6 that 
approaches 0 as approaches 0 from the left and 
approaches 1 as approaches 0 from the right. We indicate this situation symbolically by
writing
and
The symbol “
” indicates that we consider only values of that are less than 0. Like-
wise, “
” indicates that we consider only values of that are greater than 0.

CHAPTER 2
LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES
Deﬁnition We write
and say the left-hand limit of 
as approaches 
[or the limit of 
as 
approaches 
from the left] is equal to 
if we can make the values of 
arbi-
trarily close to L by taking x to be sufﬁciently close to a and x less than a.
Notice that Deﬁnition 2 differs from Deﬁnition 1 only in that we require 
to be less
than . Similarly, if we require that 
be greater than , we get “the right-hand limit of
as
approaches 
is equal to ” and we write
Thus the symbol “
” means that we consider only 
. These deﬁnitions are illus-
trated in Figure 9.
By comparing Deﬁnition l with the deﬁnitions of one-sided limits, we see that the fol-
lowing is true.

THE LIMIT OF A FUNCTION

(f) This time the left and right limits are the same and so, by (3), we have
Despite this fact, notice that 
Find

SOLUTION As becomes close to 0, 
also becomes close to 0, and 
becomes very
large. (See the table in the margin.) In fact, it appears from the graph of the function
shown in Figure 11 that the values of 
can be made arbitrarily large by
taking close enough to 0. Thus the values of 
do not approach a number, so
does not exist.
At the beginning of this section we considered the function 
and,
based on numerical and graphical evidence, we saw that
According to Deﬁnition 1, this means that the values of 
can be made as close to 4 as
we like, provided that we take 
sufﬁciently close to 2. In the following example we use
graphical methods to determine just how close is sufﬁciently close.
If 
, how close to 2 does have to be to ensure that 
is within a distance 0.1 of the number 4?
SOLUTION If the distance from 
to 4 is less than 0.1, then 
lies between 3.9 and
4.1, so the requirement is that
Thus we need to determine the values of such that the curve 
lies
between the horizontal lines 
and 
. We graph the curve and lines near the
point 
in Figure 12. With the cursor, we estimate that the -coordinate of the point
of intersection of the line 
and the curve 
is about 1.966. Simi-
larly, the curve intersects the line 
when 
. So, rounding to be safe, we
conclude that
when
Therefore 
is within a distance 0.1 of 4 when is within a distance 0.03 of 2.
The idea behind Example 9 can be used to formulate the precise deﬁnition of a limit
that is discussed in Appendix D.

In Section 2.2 we used calculators and graphs to guess the values of limits, but we saw that
such methods don’t always lead to the correct answer. In this section we use the following
properties of limits, called the Limit Laws, to calculate limits.
Limit Laws Suppose that is a constant and the limits
exist. Then
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
These ﬁve laws can be stated verbally as follows:
Sum Law
1. The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits.
Difference Law
2. The limit of a difference is the difference of the limits.
Constant Multiple Law
3. The limit of a constant times a function is the constant times the limit of the 
function.
Product Law
4. The limit of a product is the product of the limits.
Quotient Law
5. The limit of a quotient is the quotient of the limits (provided that the limit of the
denominator is not 0).
It is easy to believe that these properties are true. For instance, if 
is close to 
and
is close to 
, it is reasonable to conclude that 
is close to 
. This gives
us an intuitive basis for believing that Law 1 is true. All of these laws can be proved using
the precise deﬁnition of a limit. In Appendix E we give the proof of Law 1.

(a) From the graphs of

Therefore we have

(b) We see that

does not exist because the left and
right limits are different:
So we can’t use Law 4 for the desired limit. But we can use Law 4 for the one-sided
limits:
The left and right limits aren’t equal, so 
does not exist.
(c) The graphs show that
Because the limit of the denominator is 0, we can’t use Law 5. The given limit does not
exist because the denominator approaches 0 while the numerator approaches a nonzero
number.
If we use the Product Law repeatedly with 
, we obtain the following law.

In applying these six limit laws, we need to use two special limits:

These limits are obvious from an intuitive point of view (state them in words or draw
graphs of

If we now put 
in Law 6 and use Law 8, we get another useful special limit.

gotten the correct answer in Example 2(a) by substituting 5 for x. Similarly, direct substi-
tution provides the correct answer in part (b). The functions in Example 2 are a polynomial
and a rational function, respectively, and similar use of the Limit Laws proves that direct
substitution always works for such functions (see Exercises 43 and 44). We state this fact

Direct Substitution Property If 
is a polynomial or a rational function and is in
the domain of , then
Functions with the Direct Substitution Property are called continuous at a and will be
studied in Section 2.4. However, not all limits can be evaluated by direct substitution, as
the following examples show.
Direct substitution doesn’t always work
Find 
.
SOLUTION Let 
. We can’t ﬁnd the limit by substituting 
because 
isn’t deﬁned. Nor can we apply the Quotient Law, because the limit of the
denominator is 0. Instead, we need to do some preliminary algebra. We factor the numer-
ator as a difference of squares:
The numerator and denominator have a common factor of 
. When we take the limit
as approaches 1, we have 
and so 
. Therefore, we can cancel the com-
mon factor and compute the limit as follows:
The limit in this example arose in Section 2.1 when we were trying to ﬁnd the tangent to
the parabola 
at the point 
.
Note: In Example 3 we were able to compute the limit by replacing the given function
by a simpler function, 
, with the same limit. This is
valid because

we don’t consider what happens when is actually equal to 1. In general, we have the fol-

Newton and Limits
Isaac Newton was born on Christmas Day in
1642, the year of Galileo’s death. When he
entered Cambridge University in 1661 Newton
didn’t know much mathematics, but he learned
quickly by reading Euclid and Descartes and 
by attending the lectures of Isaac Barrow. Cam-
bridge was closed because of the plague in
1665 and 1666, and Newton returned home to
reﬂect on what he had learned. Those two years
were amazingly productive for at that time he
made four of his major discoveries: (1) his
representation of functions as sums of inﬁnite
series, including the binomial theorem; (2) his
work on differential and integral calculus; (3) his
laws of motion and law of universal gravitation;
and (4) his prism experiments on the nature of
light and color. Because of a fear of controversy
and criticism, he was reluctant to publish his
discoveries and it wasn’t until 1687, at the urg-
ing of the astronomer Halley, that Newton pub-
lished Principia Mathematica. In this work, the
greatest scientiﬁc treatise ever written, Newton
set forth his version of calculus and used it to
investigate mechanics, ﬂuid dynamics, and
wave motion, and to explain the motion of plan-
ets and comets.
The beginnings of calculus are found in 
the calculations of areas and volumes by
ancient Greek scholars such as Eudoxus and
Archimedes. Although aspects of the idea 
of a limit are implicit in their “method of
exhaustion,” Eudoxus and Archimedes never
explicitly formulated the concept of a limit. Like-
wise, mathematicians such as Cavalieri, Fermat,
and Barrow, the immediate precursors of New-
ton in the development of calculus, did not actu-
ally use limits. It was Isaac Newton who was
the ﬁrst to talk explicitly about limits. He
explained that the main idea behind limits is
that quantities “approach nearer than by any
given difference.” Newton stated that the limit
was the basic concept in calculus, but it was
left to later mathematicians like Cauchy to clar-
ify his ideas about limits.

Note that the values of the functions in Examples 3 and 4 are identical except when
(see Figure 2) and so they have the same limit as approaches 1.
Finding a limit by simplifying the function
Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION If we deﬁne 
then, as in Example 3, we can’t compute 
by letting 
since 
is
undeﬁned. But if we simplify 
algebraically, we ﬁnd that
(Recall that we consider only 
when letting approach 0.) Thus
Calculating a limit by rationalizing
Find 
.
SOLUTION We can’t apply the Quotient Law immediately, since the limit of the denomi-
nator is 0. Here the preliminary algebra consists of rationalizing the numerator:
This calculation conﬁrms the guess that we made in Example 2 in Section 2.2.
Some limits are best calculated by ﬁrst ﬁnding the left- and right-hand limits. The fol-
lowing theorem is a reminder of what we discovered in Section 2.2. It says that a two-sided
limit exists if and only if both of the one-sided limits exist and are equal.
Theorem
if and only if
When computing one-sided limits, we use the fact that the Limit Laws also hold for
one-sided limits.

The Squeeze Theorem, which is sometimes called the Sandwich Theorem or the Pinch-
ing Theorem, is illustrated by Figure 6. It says that if

How to squeeze a function

SOLUTION First note that we cannot use

because

Instead we apply the Squeeze Theorem, and so we need to ﬁnd a function smaller
than 
and a function bigger than such that both 
and 
approach 0. To do this we use our knowledge of the sine function. Because the sine of
any number lies between 
and 1, we can write
Any inequality remains true when multiplied by a positive number. We know that 
for all and so, multiplying each side of the inequalities in (4) by 
, we get
as illustrated by Figure 7. We know that

SECTION 2.4
CONTINUITY
113
We noticed in Section 2.3 that the limit of a function as approaches can often be found
simply by calculating the value of the function at . Functions with this property are called
continuous at a. We will see that the mathematical deﬁnition of continuity corresponds
closely with the meaning of the word continuity in everyday language. (A continuous
process is one that takes place gradually, without interruption or abrupt change.)
Deﬁnition A function 
is continuous at a number a if
Notice that Deﬁnition l implicitly requires three things if 
is continuous at a:
1.
is deﬁned (that is, a is in the domain of )
2.
exists
3.
The deﬁnition says that 
is continuous at if 
approaches 
as x approaches a.
Thus a continuous function 
has the property that a small change in x produces only a
small change in 
. In fact, the change in 
can be kept as small as we please by keep-
ing the change in sufﬁciently small.
If 
is deﬁned near 
(in other words, 
is deﬁned on an open interval containing ,
except perhaps at ), we say that 
is discontinuous at a (or 
has a discontinuity at ) if
is not continuous at .
Physical phenomena are usually continuous. For instance, the displacement or velocity
of a vehicle varies continuously with time, as does a person’s height. But discontinuities
do occur in such situations as electric currents. [See Example 6 in Section 2.2, where the
Heaviside function is discontinuous at because 
does not exist.]
Geometrically, you can think of a function that is continuous at every number in an
interval as a function whose graph has no break in it. The graph can be drawn without
removing your pen from the paper.
Discontinuities from a graph
Figure 2 shows the graph of a function . At
which numbers is
discontinuous? Why?
SOLUTION It looks as if there is a discontinuity when a  1 because the graph has a
break there. The ofﬁcial reason that
is discontinuous at 1 is that 
is not deﬁned.
The graph also has a break when 
, but the reason for the discontinuity is differ-
ent. Here, 
is deﬁned, but 
does not exist (because the left and right limits
are different). So
is discontinuous at 3.
What about 
? Here, 
is deﬁned and 
exists (because the left and
right limits are the same). But
So 
is discontinuous at 5.
Now let’s see how to detect discontinuities when a function is deﬁned by a formula.

Discontinuities from a formula
Where are each of the following functions
discontinuous?
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
SOLUTION
(a) Notice that 
is not deﬁned, so f is discontinuous at 2. Later we’ll see why 
is
continuous at all other numbers.
(b) Here 
is deﬁned but
does not exist. (See Example 8 in Section 2.2.) So is discontinuous at 0.
(c) Here 
is deﬁned and
exists. But 
so 
is not continuous at 2.
(d) The greatest integer function 
has discontinuities at all of the integers
because 
does not exist if is an integer. (See Example 9 and Exercise 39 in
Section 2.3.)
Figure 3 shows the graphs of the functions in Example 2. In each case the graph can’t
be drawn without lifting the pen from the paper because a hole or break or jump occurs in
the graph. The kind of discontinuity illustrated in parts (a) and (c) is called removable
because we could remove the discontinuity by redeﬁning 
at just the single number 2.
[The function 
is continuous.] The discontinuity in part (b) is called an inﬁ-
nite discontinuity. The discontinuities in part (d) are called jump discontinuities because
the function “jumps” from one value to another.

At each integer , the function 
[see Figure 3(d)] is continuous
from the right but discontinuous from the left because

Deﬁnition A function 
is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at
every number in the interval. (If f is deﬁned only on one side of an endpoint of the
interval, we understand continuous at the endpoint to mean continuous from the
right or continuous from the left.)
Continuity from the deﬁnition
Show that the function 
is
continuous on the interval 
SOLUTION If

Thus, by Deﬁnition l,

so

according to Deﬁnition 3,

Instead of always using Deﬁnitions 1, 2, and 3 to verify the continuity of a function as
we did in Example 4, it is often convenient to use the next theorem, which shows how to
build up complicated continuous functions from simple ones.

PROOF Each of the ﬁve parts of this theorem follows from the corresponding Limit Law
in Section 2.3. For instance, we give the proof of part 1. Since 
and are continuous at
, we have
Therefore
(by Law 1)
This shows that 
is continuous at .
It follows from Theorem 4 and Deﬁnition 3 that if 
and are continuous on an inter-
val, then so are the functions 
, and (if is never 0) 
. The following
theorem was stated in Section 2.3 as the Direct Substitution Property.
Theorem
(a) Any polynomial is continuous everywhere; that is, it is continuous on
.
(b) Any rational function is continuous wherever it is deﬁned; that is, it is contin-
uous on its domain.
PROOF
(a) A polynomial is a function of the form
where 
are constants. We know that
(by Law 7)
and
(by 9)
This equation is precisely the statement that the function 
is a continuous 
function. Thus, by part 3 of Theorem 4, the function 
is continuous. Since 
is a sum of functions of this form and a constant function, it follows from part 1 of 
Theorem 4 that 
is continuous.

(b) A rational function is a function of the form
where 
and 
are polynomials. The domain of 
is 
. We know
from part (a) that 
and 
are continuous everywhere. Thus, by part 5 of Theorem 4, 
is continuous at every number in .
As an illustration of Theorem 5, observe that the volume of a sphere varies continuously
with its radius because the formula 
shows that 
is a polynomial function 
of . Likewise, if a ball is thrown vertically into the air with a velocity of 50 fts, then the 
height of the ball in feet seconds later is given by the formula 
. Again this
is a polynomial function, so the height is a continuous function of the elapsed time.
Knowledge of which functions are continuous enables us to evaluate some limits very
quickly, as the following example shows. Compare it with Example 2(b) in Section 2.3.
Finding the limit of a continuous function
Find 
.
SOLUTION The function
is rational, so by Theorem 5 it is continuous on its domain, which is 
. 
Therefore
It turns out that most of the familiar functions are continuous at every number in their
domains. For instance, Limit Law 10 (page 106) is exactly the statement that root functions
are continuous.
From the appearance of the graphs of the sine and cosine functions (Figure 18 in
Section 1.2), we would certainly guess that they are continuous. We know from the deﬁni-
tions of 
and 
that the coordinates of the point P in Figure 5 are 
. As
, we see that P approaches the point 
and so 
and 
. Thus
Since 
and 
, the equations in (6) assert that the cosine and sine func-
tions are continuous at 0. The addition formulas for cosine and sine can then be used to 
deduce that these functions are continuous everywhere (see Exercises 49 and 50).
It follows from part 5 of Theorem 4 that
is continuous except where

, so 
has inﬁnite discontinuities when 
and so on
(see Figure 6).
In Section 1.5 we deﬁned the exponential function 
so as to ﬁll in the holes in the
graph of 
where x is rational. In other words, the very deﬁnition of 
makes 
it a continuous function on . The inverse function of any continuous one-to-one function
is also continuous. (The graph of 
is obtained by reﬂecting the graph of f about the line
. So if the graph of f has no break in it, neither does the graph of 
.) Therefore the
function 
is continuous on 
because it is the inverse function of 
.
Theorem The following types of functions are continuous at every number in
their domains:
polynomials
rational functions
root functions
trigonometric functions
exponential functions
logarithmic functions
Continuity on intervals
Where is the function 
continuous?
SOLUTION We know from Theorem 7 that the function 
is continuous for 
and 
is continuous on . Thus, by part 1 of Theorem 4, 
is continu-
ous on 
. The denominator, 
, is a polynomial, so it is continuous every-
where. Therefore, by part 5 of Theorem 4,
is continuous at all positive numbers x
except where 
. So
is continuous on the intervals 
and 
.
Evaluate

SOLUTION Theorem 7 tells us that 
is continuous. The function in the denomi-
nator, 
, is the sum of two continuous functions and is therefore continu-
ous. Notice that this function is never 0 because 
for all and so
everywhere. Thus the ratio

is continuous everywhere. Hence, by the deﬁnition of a continuous function,
Another way of combining continuous functions 
and to get a new continuous func-
tion is to form the composite function 
. This fact is a consequence of the following
theorem.
Theorem If

then 
In other words,
Intuitively, Theorem 8 is reasonable because if 
is close to , then 
is close to ,
and since 
is continuous at , if 
is close to , then 
is close to 
.
Theorem If is continuous at and 
is continuous at 
, then the compos-
ite function 
given by 
is continuous at .
This theorem is often expressed informally by saying “a continuous function of a con-
tinuous function is a continuous function.”
PROOF Since is continuous at , we have
Since

which is precisely the statement that the function

CHAPTER 2
LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES
An important property of continuous functions is expressed by the following theorem,
whose proof is found in more advanced books on calculus.
The Intermediate Value Theorem Suppose that 
is continuous on the closed
interval 
and let 
be any number between 
and 
, where 
.
Then there exists a number in 
such that 
.
The Intermediate Value Theorem states that a continuous function takes on every inter-
mediate value between the function values 
and 
. It is illustrated by Figure 8. Note
that the value 
can be taken on once [as in part (a)] or more than once [as in part (b)].
If we think of a continuous function as a function whose graph has no hole or break,
then it is easy to believe that the Intermediate Value Theorem is true. In geometric terms it
says that if any horizontal line 
is given between 
and 
as in Fig-
ure 9, then the graph of 
can’t jump over the line. It must intersect 
somewhere.
It is important that the function in Theorem 10 be continuous. The Intermediate Value
Theorem is not true in general for discontinuous functions (see Exercise 38).
One use of the Intermediate Value Theorem is in locating roots of equations as in the
following example.
Using the Intermediate Value Theorem to show the existence of a root
Show that there is a root of the equation
between 1 and 2.
SOLUTION Let 
. We are looking for a solution of the given
equation, that is, a number between 1 and 2 such that 
. Therefore, we take
, 
, and 
in Theorem 10. We have
and
Thus 
; that is, 
is a number between 
and 
. Now 
is
continuous since it is a polynomial, so the Intermediate Value Theorem says there 
is a number between 1 and 2 such that 
. In other words, the equation
has at least one root in the interval 
.
In fact, we can locate a root more precisely by using the Intermediate Value Theorem
again. Since

a root must lie between 1.2 and 1.3. A calculator gives, by trial and error,
so a root lies in the interval 
.
We can use a graphing calculator or computer to illustrate the use of the Intermediate
Value Theorem in Example 9. Figure 10 shows the graph of 
in the viewing rectangle
by 
and you can see that the graph crosses the -axis between 1 and 2. Fig-
ure 11 shows the result of zooming in to the viewing rectangle 
by 
.
In fact, the Intermediate Value Theorem plays a role in the very way these graphing
devices work. A computer calculates a ﬁnite number of points on the graph and turns on
the pixels that contain these calculated points. It assumes that the function is continuous
and takes on all the intermediate values between two consecutive points. The computer
therefore connects the pixels by turning on the intermediate pixels.

by observing, from the table of values and the graph of 
in Figure 1, that the val-
ues of

do not approach a number, so 
does not exist.
To indicate this kind of behavior we use the notation
| This does not mean that we are regarding 
as a number. Nor does it mean that the limit
exists. It simply expresses the particular way in which the limit does not exist:

made as large as we like by taking close enough to 0.
In general, we write symbolically

Again, the symbol 
is not a number, but the expression

“the limit of

or
“

or
“
increases without bound as approaches ”
This deﬁnition is illustrated graphically in Figure 2.
Similarly, as shown in Figure 3,
means that the values of

When we say that a number is “large negative,”

The symbol

Similar deﬁnitions can be given for the one-sided inﬁnite limits

SOLUTION If is close to 3 but larger than 3, then the denominator

SOLUTION We introduce a new variable,

because 
is a continuous function. So, by (3), 
we have
Limits at Inﬁnity
In computing inﬁnite limits, we let approach a number and the result was that the values
of became arbitrarily large (positive or negative). Here we let become arbitrarily large
(positive or negative) and see what happens to .
Let’s begin by investigating the behavior of the function 
deﬁned by
as becomes large. The table at the left gives values of this function correct to six decimal
places, and the graph of 
has been drawn by a computer in Figure 8.
As 
grows larger and larger you can see that the values of 
get closer and closer 
to 1. In fact, it seems that we can make the values of 
as close as we like to 1 by taking
sufﬁciently large. This situation is expressed symbolically by writing
In general, we use the notation
to indicate that the values of 
approach 
as becomes larger and larger.
Deﬁnition Let 
be a function deﬁned on some interval 
. Then
means that the values of 
can be made as close to 
as we like by taking 
sufﬁciently large.

CHAPTER 2
LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES
The symbol 
does not represent a number. Nonetheless, the expression
is
often read as
“the limit of 
, as approaches inﬁnity, is ”
or
“the limit of 
, as becomes inﬁnite, is ”
or
“the limit of 
, as increases without bound, is ”
The meaning of such phrases is given by Deﬁnition 4.
Geometric illustrations of Deﬁnition 4 are shown in Figure 9. Notice that there are
many ways for the graph of 
to approach the line 
(which is called a horizontal
asymptote) as we look to the far right of each graph.
Referring back to Figure 8, we see that for numerically large negative values of , the
values of 
are close to 1. By letting decrease through negative values without bound,
we can make 
as close to 1 as we like. This is expressed by writing
In general, as shown in Figure 10, the notation
means that the values of 
can be made arbitrarily close to 
by taking 
sufﬁciently
large negative.
Again, the symbol 
does not represent a number, but the expression
is often read as
“the limit of 
, as x approaches negative inﬁnity, is L”
Notice in Figure 10 that the graph approaches the line 
as we look to the far left of
each graph.
Deﬁnition The line 
is called a horizontal asymptote of the curve
if either 
For instance, the curve illustrated in Figure 8 has the line 
as a horizontal asymp-
tote because

Inﬁnite limits and asymptotes from a graph
Find the inﬁnite limits, limits at
inﬁnity, and asymptotes for the function
whose graph is shown in Figure 12.
SOLUTION We see that the values of 
become large as 
from both sides, so
Notice that 
becomes large negative as x approaches 2 from the left, but large posi-
tive as x approaches 2 from the right. So
Thus both of the lines 
and 
are vertical asymptotes.
As x becomes large, it appears that 
approaches 4. But as x decreases through
negative values, 
approaches 2. So
This means that both y  4 and y  2 are horizontal asymptotes.
Find 
and 
.
SOLUTION Observe that when is large, 
is small. For instance, 
In fact, by taking large enough, we can make 
as close to 0 as we please. Therefore,
according to Deﬁnition 4, we have 
Similar reasoning shows that when is large negative, 
is small negative, so we also

CHAPTER 2
LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES
It follows that the line 
(the -axis) is a horizontal asymptote of the curve 
.
(This is an equilateral hyperbola; see Figure 13.)
Most of the Limit Laws that were given in Section 2.3 also hold for limits at inﬁnity. It
can be proved that the Limit Laws listed in Section 2.3 (with the exception of Laws 9 and
10) are also valid if “
” is replaced by “
” or “
.” In particular, if we
combine Law 6 with the results of Example 4 we obtain the following important rule for
calculating limits.
If is a positive integer, then
A quotient of functions that become large
Evaluate
SOLUTION As becomes large, both numerator and denominator become large, so it isn’t
obvious what happens to their ratio. We need to do some preliminary algebra. 
To evaluate the limit at inﬁnity of any rational function, we ﬁrst divide both the
numerator and denominator by the highest power of that occurs in the denominator.
(We may assume that 
, since we are interested only in large values of .) In this
case the highest power of is 
and so, using the Limit Laws, we have
[by (6)]
A similar calculation shows that the limit as 
is also . Figure 14 illustrates the
results of these calculations by showing how the graph of the given rational function
approaches the horizontal asymptote 
.

A difference of functions that become large
Compute 
.
SOLUTION Because both 
and x are large when x is large, it’s difﬁcult to see what
happens to their difference, so we use algebra to rewrite the function. We ﬁrst multiply
numerator and denominator by the conjugate radical:
Notice that the denominator of this last expression 
becomes large as
(it’s bigger than ). So
Figure 15 illustrates this result.
The graph of the natural exponential function 
has the line y  0 (the x-axis) as
a horizontal asymptote. (The same is true of any exponential function with base 
.) In
fact, from the graph in Figure 16 and the corresponding table of values, we see that
Notice that the values of 
approach 0 very rapidly.
Evaluate

SOLUTION If we let 
, we know from Example 4 that

fore, by (7),
Evaluate

SOLUTION As x increases, the values of sin x oscillate between 1 and 1 inﬁnitely often.
Thus

The problem of ﬁnding the tangent line to a curve and the problem of ﬁnding the velocity
of an object both involve ﬁnding the same type of limit, as we saw in Section 2.1. This spe-
cial type of limit is called a derivative and we will see that it can be interpreted as a rate
of change in any of the sciences or engineering.
Tangents
If a curve 
has equation 
and we want to ﬁnd the tangent line to 
at the point
, then we consider a nearby point 
, where 
, and compute the slope
of the secant line 
:
Then we let 
approach 
along the curve 
by letting approach . If 
approaches a
number 
, then we deﬁne the tangent t to be the line through 
with slope 
. (This
amounts to saying that the tangent line is the limiting position of the secant line 
as 
approaches . See Figure 1.)
Deﬁnition The tangent line to the curve 
at the point 
is the
line through 
with slope
provided that this limit exists.
In our ﬁrst example we conﬁrm the guess we made in Example 1 in Section 2.1.

Find an equation of the tangent line to

SOLUTION Here we have 
and 
, so the slope is
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we ﬁnd that an equation of the
tangent line at 
is
We sometimes refer to the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a point as the slope of
the curve at the point. The idea is that if we zoom in far enough toward the point, the curve
looks almost like a straight line. Figure 2 illustrates this procedure for the curve 
in
Example 1. The more we zoom in, the more the parabola looks like a line. In other words,
the curve becomes almost indistinguishable from its tangent line.
There is another expression for the slope of a tangent line that is sometimes easier to
use. If

and so the slope of the secant line 
is

SOLUTION Let 
. Then the slope of the tangent at 
is
Therefore an equation of the tangent at the point 
is 
which simpliﬁes to
The hyperbola and its tangent are shown in Figure 4.
Velocities
In Section 2.1 we investigated the motion of a ball dropped from the CN Tower and deﬁned
its velocity to be the limiting value of average velocities over shorter and shorter time 
periods.
In general, suppose an object moves along a straight line according to an equation of
motion 
, where is the displacement (directed distance) of the object from the ori-
gin at time . The function 
that describes the motion is called the position function
of the object. In the time interval from 
to 
the change in position is
. (See Figure 5.) The average velocity over this time interval is
which is the same as the slope of the secant line 
in Figure 6.
Now suppose we compute the average velocities over shorter and shorter time intervals
. In other words, we let 
approach . As in the example of the falling ball, we
deﬁne the velocity (or instantaneous velocity)
at time 
to be the limit of these
average velocities:
This means that the velocity at time 
is equal to the slope of the tangent line at 
(compare Equations 2 and 3).
Now that we know how to compute limits, let’s reconsider the problem of the fall-
ing ball.
Velocity of a falling ball
Suppose that a ball is dropped from the upper
observation deck of the CN Tower, 450 m above the ground.
(a) What is the velocity of the ball after 5 seconds?
(b) How fast is the ball traveling when it hits the ground?
SOLUTION We will need to ﬁnd the velocity both when 
and when the ball hits the
ground, so it’s efﬁcient to start by ﬁnding the velocity at a general time 
. Using the

Derivatives
We have seen that the same type of limit arises in ﬁnding the slope of a tangent line
(Equation 2) or the velocity of an object (Equation 3). In fact, limits of the form
arise whenever we calculate a rate of change in any of the sciences or engineering, such as
a rate of reaction in chemistry or a marginal cost in economics. Since this type of limit
occurs so widely, it is given a special name and notation.
Deﬁnition The derivative of a function 
at a number , denoted by
, is
if this limit exists.
If we write 
, then we have 
and 
approaches 
if and only if 
approaches . Therefore an equivalent way of stating the deﬁnition of the derivative, as we
saw in ﬁnding tangent lines, is

LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES
is called the average rate of change of y with respect to x over the interval 
and
can be interpreted as the slope of the secant line 
in Figure 8.
By analogy with velocity, we consider the average rate of change over smaller and
smaller intervals by letting 
approach 
and therefore letting 
approach . The limit
of these average rates of change is called the (instantaneous) rate of change of y with
respect to x at 
, which is interpreted as the slope of the tangent to the curve 
at 
:
We recognize this limit as being the derivative 
.
We know that one interpretation of the derivative 
is as the slope of the tangent line
to the curve 
when 
. We now have a second interpretation:
The derivative 
is the instantaneous rate of change of 
with respect 
to 
when 
.
The connection with the ﬁrst interpretation is that if we sketch the curve 
, then
the instantaneous rate of change is the slope of the tangent to this curve at the point where
. This means that when the derivative is large (and therefore the curve is steep, as 
at the point 
in Figure 9), the -values change rapidly. When the derivative is small, the
curve is relatively ﬂat (as at point ) and the -values change slowly.
In particular, if 
is the position function of a particle that moves along a straight
line, then 
is the rate of change of the displacement 
with respect to the time . In
other words, 
is the velocity of the particle at time 
. The speed of the particle is
the absolute value of the velocity, that is, 
In the next example we discuss the meaning of the derivative of a function that is
deﬁned verbally.
Derivative of a cost function
A manufacturer produces bolts of a fabric
with a ﬁxed width. The cost of producing x yards of this fabric is 
dollars.
(a) What is the meaning of the derivative 
? What are its units?
(b) In practical terms, what does it mean to say that 
?
(c) Which do you think is greater, 
or 
? What about 
?
SOLUTION
(a) The derivative 
is the instantaneous rate of change of C with respect to x; that
is, 
means the rate of change of the production cost with respect to the number of
yards produced. (Economists call this rate of change the marginal cost. This idea is dis-
cussed in more detail in Sections 3.8 and 4.6.)
Because
the units for 
are the same as the units for the difference quotient 
. Since 
is measured in dollars and 
in yards, it follows that the units for 
are dollars
per yard.

(b) The statement that 
means that, after 1000 yards of fabric have been
manufactured, the rate at which the production cost is increasing is $9yard. (When
, C is increasing 9 times as fast as x.)
Since 
is small compared with 
, we could use the approximation
and say that the cost of manufacturing the 1000th yard (or the 1001st) is about $9.
(c) The rate at which the production cost is increasing (per yard) is probably lower
when x  500 than when x  50 (the cost of making the 500th yard is less than the cost
of the 50th yard) because of economies of scale. (The manufacturer makes more efﬁcient
use of the ﬁxed costs of production.) So
But, as production expands, the resulting large-scale operation might become inefﬁcient
and there might be overtime costs. Thus it is possible that the rate of increase of costs
will eventually start to rise. So it may happen that
In the following example we estimate the rate of change of the national debt with
respect to time. Here the function is deﬁned not by a formula but by a table of values.
Derivative of a tabular function
Let 
be the US national debt at time t.
The table in the margin gives approximate values of this function by providing end of
year estimates, in billions of dollars, from 1980 to 2005. Interpret and estimate the value
of 
.
SOLUTION The derivative 
means the rate of change of D with respect to t when
, that is, the rate of increase of the national debt in 1990.
According to Equation 5,
So we compute and tabulate values of the difference quotient (the average rates of
change) as follows.
From this table we see that 
lies somewhere between 257.48 and 348.14 billion
dollars per year. [Here we are making the reasonable assumption that the debt didn’t
ﬂuctuate wildly between 1980 and 2000.] We estimate that the rate of increase of the
national debt of the United States in 1990 was the average of these two numbers, namely
Another method would be to plot the debt function and estimate the slope of the tan-
gent line when

A Note on Units
The units for the average rate of change 
are the units for 
divided by the units for 
,
namely, billions of dollars per year. The instan-
taneous rate of change is the limit of the aver-
age rates of change, so it is measured in the
same units: billions of dollars per year.

Exercises
In Examples 3, 6, and 7 we saw three speciﬁc examples of rates of change: the veloc-
ity of an object is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time; marginal cost is
the rate of change of production cost with respect to the number of items produced; the
rate of change of the debt with respect to time is of interest in economics. Here is a small
sample of other rates of change: In physics, the rate of change of work with respect to time
is called power. Chemists who study a chemical reaction are interested in the rate of
change in the concentration of a reactant with respect to time (called the rate of reaction).
A biologist is interested in the rate of change of the population of a colony of bacteria with
respect to time. In fact, the computation of rates of change is important in all of the natu-
ral sciences, in engineering, and even in the social sciences. Further examples will be given
in Section 3.8.
All these rates of change are derivatives and can therefore be interpreted as slopes of
tangents. This gives added signiﬁcance to the solution of the tangent problem. Whenever
we solve a problem involving tangent lines, we are not just solving a problem in geome-
try. We are also implicitly solving a great variety of problems involving rates of change in
science and engineering.

Early Methods for Finding Tangents
The ﬁrst person to formulate explicitly the ideas of limits and derivatives was Sir Isaac Newton in
the 1660s. But Newton acknowledged that “If I have seen further than other men, it is because I
have stood on the shoulders of giants.” Two of those giants were Pierre Fermat (1601–1665) and
Newton’s mentor at Cambridge, Isaac Barrow (1630–1677). Newton was familiar with the meth-
ods that these men used to ﬁnd tangent lines, and their methods played a role in Newton’s eventual
formulation of calculus.
The following references contain explanations of these methods. Read one or more of the
references and write a report comparing the methods of either Fermat or Barrow to modern 
methods. In particular, use the method of Section 2.6 to ﬁnd an equation of the tangent line to the
curve 
at the point (1, 3) and show how either Fermat or Barrow would have solved
the same problem. Although you used derivatives and they did not, point out similarities between
the methods.

CHAPTER 2
LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES
In the preceding section we considered the derivative of a function f at a ﬁxed number a:
.
Here we change our point of view and let the number a vary. If we replace a in Equation 1
by a variable x, we obtain
Given any number x for which this limit exists, we assign to x the number 
. So we can
regard 
as a new function, called the derivative of 
and deﬁned by Equation 2. We
know that the value of 
at , 
, can be interpreted geometrically as the slope of the
tangent line to the graph of 
at the point 
.
The function 
is called the derivative of 
because it has been “derived” from 
by
the limiting operation in Equation 2. The domain of 
is the set 
exists and may
be smaller than the domain of .
Derivative of a function given by a graph
The graph of a function 
is
given in Figure 1. Use it to sketch the graph of the derivative .
SOLUTION We can estimate the value of the derivative at any value of by drawing the
tangent at the point 
and estimating its slope. For instance, for x  5 we draw 
the tangent at 
in Figure 2(a) and estimate its slope to be about , so 
. This
allows us to plot the point 
on the graph of 
directly beneath P. Repeating
this procedure at several points, we get the graph shown in Figure 2(b). Notice that the
tangents at , , and 
are horizontal, so the derivative is 0 there and the graph of 
crosses the -axis at the points 
, 
, and 
, directly beneath A, B, and C. Between 
and 
the tangents have positive slope, so 
is positive there. But between 
and 
the tangents have negative slope, so 
is negative there.

If a function is deﬁned by a table of values, then we can construct a table of approxi-
mate values of its derivative, as in the next example.

gium at time . The table at the left gives midyear values of

1980 to 2006. Construct a table of values for the derivative of this function.

which is the average rate of increase between 1986 and 1988. We get a more accurate
approximation if we take the average of these rates of change:
This means that in 1988 the population was increasing at a rate of about 26,750 people
per year.
Making similar calculations for the other values (except at the endpoints), we get the
table at the left, which shows the approximate values for the derivative.

CHAPTER 2
LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES
Other Notations
If we use the traditional notation 
to indicate that the independent variable is and
the dependent variable is , then some common alternative notations for the derivative are
as follows:
The symbols 
and 
are called differentiation operators because they indicate the
operation of differentiation, which is the process of calculating a derivative.
The symbol 
, which was introduced by Leibniz, should not be regarded as a ratio
(for the time being); it is simply a synonym for 
. Nonetheless, it is a very useful and
suggestive notation, especially when used in conjunction with increment notation. Refer-
ring to Equation 2.6.6, we can rewrite the deﬁnition of derivative in Leibniz notation in the
form
If we want to indicate the value of a derivative 
in Leibniz notation at a speciﬁc num-
ber , we use the notation
or
which is a synonym for 
.
Deﬁnition A function
is differentiable at a if 
exists. It is differen-
tiable on an open interval
[or 
or 
or 
] if it is differ-
entiable at every number in the interval.
Where is the function

Leibniz
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was born in Leipzig 
in 1646 and studied law, theology, philosophy, 
and mathematics at the university there, gradu-
ating with a bachelor’s degree at age 17. After
earning his doctorate in law at age 20, Leibniz
entered the diplomatic service and spent most
of his life traveling to the capitals of Europe on 
political missions. In particular, he worked to
avert a French military threat against Germany
and attempted to reconcile the Catholic and
Protestant churches.
His serious study of mathematics did not
begin until 1672 while he was on a diplomatic
mission in Paris. There he built a calculating
machine and met scientists, like Huygens, who
directed his attention to the latest develop-
ments in mathematics and science. Leibniz
sought to develop a symbolic logic and system
of notation that would simplify logical reason-
ing. In particular, the version of calculus that he
published in 1684 established the notation and
the rules for ﬁnding derivatives that we use
today.
Unfortunately, a dreadful priority dispute
arose in the 1690s between the followers of
Newton and those of Leibniz as to who had
invented calculus ﬁrst. Leibniz was even
accused of plagiarism by members of the Royal
Society in England. The truth is that each man
invented calculus independently. Newton
arrived at his version of calculus ﬁrst but,
because of his fear of controversy, did not pub-
lish it immediately. So Leibniz’s 1684 account 
of calculus was the ﬁrst to be published.

SECTION 2.7
THE DERIVATIVE AS A FUNCTION
151
For 
we have to investigate
Let’s compute the left and right limits separately:
and
Since these limits are different, 
does not exist. Thus 
is differentiable at all 
except 0.
A formula for 
is given by
and its graph is shown in Figure 6(b). The fact that 
does not exist is reﬂected geo-
metrically in the fact that the curve 
does not have a tangent line at 
. [See
Figure 6(a).]
Both continuity and differentiability are desirable properties for a function to have. The
following theorem shows how these properties are related.
Theorem If 
is differentiable at , then 
is continuous at .
PROOF To prove that 
is continuous at , we have to show that 
. We
do this by showing that the difference 
approaches 0 as approaches .
The given information is that f is differentiable at a, that is,
exists (see Equation 2.6.5). To connect the given and the unknown, we divide and multi-
ply 
by 
(which we can do when 
):
Thus, using the Product Law and (2.6.5), we can write

CHAPTER 2
LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES
To use what we have just proved, we start with 
and add and subtract 
:
Therefore 
is continuous at .
|
Note: The converse of Theorem 4 is false; that is, there are functions that are continu-
ous but not differentiable. For instance, the function 
is continuous at 0 because
(See Example 7 in Section 2.3.) But in Example 6 we showed that 
is not differentiable
at 0.
How Can a Function Fail to be Differentiable?
We saw that the function 
in Example 6 is not differentiable at 0 and Figure 6(a)
shows that its graph changes direction abruptly when 
. In general, if the graph of a
function 
has a “corner” or “kink” in it, then the graph of 
has no tangent at this point
and 
is not differentiable there. [In trying to compute 
, we ﬁnd that the left and right
limits are different.]
Theorem 4 gives another way for a function not to have a derivative. It says that if 
is
not continuous at , then 
is not differentiable at . So at any discontinuity (for instance,
a jump discontinuity) 
fails to be differentiable.
A third possibility is that the curve has a vertical tangent line when 
; that is, 
is continuous at and
This means that the tangent lines become steeper and steeper as 
. Figure 7 shows one
way that this can happen; Figure 8(c) shows another. Figure 8 illustrates the three possi-
bilities that we have discussed.
A graphing calculator or computer provides another way of looking at differentiabil-
ity. If 
is differentiable at , then when we zoom in toward the point 
the graph 
straightens out and appears more and more like a line. (See Figure 9. We saw a speciﬁc
example of this in Figure 2 in Section 2.6.) But no matter how much we zoom in toward a
point like the ones in Figures 7 and 8(a), we can’t eliminate the sharp point or corner (see
Figure 10).

SECTION 2.7
THE DERIVATIVE AS A FUNCTION
153
Higher Derivatives
If 
is a differentiable function, then its derivative 
is also a function, so 
may have a
derivative of its own, denoted by 
. This new function 
is called the second
derivative of 
because it is the derivative of the derivative of . Using Leibniz notation,
we write the second derivative of 
as
If 
, ﬁnd and interpret 
.
SOLUTION In Example 3 we found that the ﬁrst derivative is 
. So the 
second derivative is
The graphs of , 
, and 
are shown in Figure 11.
We can interpret 
as the slope of the curve 
at the point 
. In
other words, it is the rate of change of the slope of the original curve 
.
Notice from Figure 11 that 
is negative when 
has negative slope 
and positive when 
has positive slope. So the graphs serve as a check on our 
calculations.
In general, we can interpret a second derivative as a rate of change of a rate of change.
The most familiar example of this is acceleration, which we deﬁne as follows.
If 
is the position function of an object that moves in a straight line, we know
that its ﬁrst derivative represents the velocity 
of the object as a function of time:
The instantaneous rate of change of velocity with respect to time is called the acceleration
of the object. Thus the acceleration function is the derivative of the velocity function
and is therefore the second derivative of the position function:

or, in Leibniz notation,
Graphing velocity and acceleration
A car starts from rest and the graph of 
its position function is shown in Figure 12, where is measured in feet and in seconds. 
Use it to graph the velocity and acceleration of the car. What is the acceleration at 
seconds?
SOLUTION By measuring the slope of the graph of 
at 
and 5, and
using the method of Example 1, we plot the graph of the velocity function 
in
Figure 13. The acceleration when 
s is 
, the slope of the tangent line to
the graph of 
when 
. We estimate the slope of this tangent line to be
Similar measurements enable us to graph the acceleration function in Figure 14.
The third derivative
is the derivative of the second derivative: 
. So
can be interpreted as the slope of the curve 
or as the rate of change of
. If 
, then alternative notations for the third derivative are
The process can be continued. The fourth derivative 
is usually denoted by 
. In gen-
eral, the th derivative of 
is denoted by 
and is obtained from 
by differentiating 
times. If 
, we write
If 
, ﬁnd 
and 
.
SOLUTION In Example 7 we found that 
. The graph of the second derivative
has equation 
and so it is a straight line with slope 6. Since the derivative 
is
the slope of 
, we have
for all values of . So 
is a constant function and its graph is a horizontal line. There-
fore, for all values of ,
We can also interpret the third derivative physically in the case where the function is 
the position function 
of an object that moves along a straight line. Because

, the third derivative of the position function is the derivative of the accel-
eration function and is called the jerk:
Thus the jerk j is the rate of change of acceleration. It is aptly named because a large jerk
means a sudden change in acceleration, which causes an abrupt movement in a vehicle.
We have seen that one application of second and third derivatives occurs in analyzing
the motion of objects using acceleration and jerk. We will investigate another applica-
tion of second derivatives in Section 2.8, where we show how knowledge of 
gives us
information about the shape of the graph of . In Chapter 8 we will see how second and
higher derivatives enable us to represent functions as sums of inﬁnite series.

Many of the applications of calculus depend on our ability to deduce facts about a func-
tion
from information concerning its derivatives. Because 
represents the slope of
the curve 
at the point 
, it tells us the direction in which the curve proceeds
at each point. So it is reasonable to expect that information about 
will provide us with
information about 
.
In particular, to see how the derivative of 
can tell us where a function is increasing or
decreasing, look at Figure 1. (Increasing functions and decreasing functions were deﬁned
in Section 1.1.) Between 
and 
and between 
and , the tangent lines have positive
slope and so 
. Between 
and 
the tangent lines have negative slope and so
. Thus it appears that increases when 
is positive and decreases when 
is negative.
It turns out, as we will see in Chapter 4, that what we observed for the function graphed
in Figure 1 is always true. We state the general result as follows.
If 
on an interval, then 
is increasing on that interval.
If 
on an interval, then 
is decreasing on that interval.

SOLUTION
(a) We observe from Figure 2 that 
is negative when 
, so the original
function 
must be decreasing on the interval 
. Similarly, 
is positive for
and for 
, so 
is increasing on the intervals 
and 
. Also
note that, since 
and 
, the graph of 
has horizontal tangents when
.
(b) We use the information from part (a), and the fact that the graph passes through the
origin, to sketch a possible graph of 
in Figure 3. Notice that 
, so we have
drawn the curve 
passing through the origin with a slope of 
. Notice also that
as 
(from Figure 2). So the slope of the curve 
approaches 1
as becomes large (positive or negative). That is why we have drawn the graph of 
in
Figure 3 progressively straighter as 
.
We say that the function 
in Example 1 has a local maximum at 
because near
the values of 
are at least as big as the neighboring values. Note that 
is
positive to the left of 
and negative just to the right of 
. Similarly, 
has a local min-
imum at 1, where the derivative changes from negative to positive. In Chapter 4 we will
develop these observations into a general method for ﬁnding optimal values of functions.
What Does
Say about
?
Let’s see how the sign of 
affects the appearance of the graph of . Since 
,
we know that if 
is positive, then 
is an increasing function. This says that the slopes
of the tangent lines of the curve 
increase from left to right. Figure 4 shows the
graph of such a function. The slope of this curve becomes progressively larger as increas-
es and we observe that, as a consequence, the curve bends upward. Such a curve is called
concave upward. In Figure 5, however, 
is negative, which means that 
is decreas-
ing. Thus the slopes of 
decrease from left to right and the curve bends downward. This
curve is called concave downward. We summarize our discussion as follows. (Concavity
is discussed in greater detail in Section 4.3.)
If 
on an interval, then 
is concave upward on that interval.
If 
on an interval, then 
is concave downward on that interval.

CHAPTER 2
LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES
Figure 6 shows a population graph for Cyprian honeybees raised in an 
apiary. How does the rate of population increase change over time? When is this rate
highest? Over what intervals is P concave upward or concave downward?
SOLUTION By looking at the slope of the curve as t increases, we see that the rate of
increase of the population is initially very small, then gets larger until it reaches a maxi-
mum at about t  12 weeks, and decreases as the population begins to level off. As the
population approaches its maximum value of about 75,000 (called the carrying capac-
ity), the rate of increase, 
, approaches 0. The curve appears to be concave upward on
(0, 12) and concave downward on (12, 18).
In Example 2, the population curve changed from concave upward to concave down-
ward at approximately the point (12, 38,000). This point is called an inﬂection point of the
curve. The signiﬁcance of this point is that the rate of population increase has its maximum
value there. In general, an inﬂection point is a point where a curve changes its direction
of concavity.
Sketching , given knowledge about
and
Sketch a possible graph of a
function 
that satisﬁes the following conditions:
SOLUTION Condition (i) tells us that 
is increasing on 
and decreasing on 
.
Condition (ii) says that 
is concave upward on 
and 
, and concave down-
ward on 
. From condition (iii) we know that the graph of 
has two horizontal
asymptotes: 
and 
.
We ﬁrst draw the horizontal asymptote 
as a dashed line (see Figure 7). We
then draw the graph of 
approaching this asymptote at the far left, increasing to its
maximum point at 
and decreasing toward the x-axis as 
. We also make sure
that the graph has inﬂection points when 
and 2. Notice that the curve bends
upward for 
and 
, and bends downward when x is between 2 and 2.
Antiderivatives
In many problems in mathematics and its applications, we are given a function 
and we
are required to ﬁnd a function 
whose derivative is . If such a function 
exists, we call
it an antiderivative of . In other words, an antiderivative of 
is a function 
such that
. (In Example 1 we sketched an antiderivative 
of the function 
.)

Sketching an antiderivative
Let 
be an antiderivative of the function 
whose graph is shown in Figure 8.
(a) Where is 
increasing or decreasing?
(b) Where is 
concave upward or concave downward?
(c) At what values of does 
have an inﬂection point?
(d) If 
, sketch the graph of .
(e) How many antiderivatives does 
have?
SOLUTION
(a) We see from Figure 8 that 
for all 
. Since 
is an antiderivative 
of , we have 
and so 
is positive when 
. This means that 
is
increasing on 
.
(b)
is concave upward when 
. But 
, so 
is concave upward
when 
, that is, when 
is increasing. From Figure 8 we see that 
is increasing
when 
and when 
. So 
is concave upward on 
and 
. 
is
concave downward when 
, that is, when 
is decreasing. So 
is con-
cave downward on 
.
(c)
has an inﬂection point when the direction of concavity changes. From part (b) we
know that 
changes from concave upward to concave downward at 
, so 
has an
inﬂection point there. 
changes from concave downward to concave upward when
, so 
has another inﬂection point when 
.
(d) In sketching the graph of , we use the information from parts (a), (b), and (c). 
But, for ﬁner detail, we also bear in mind the meaning of an antiderivative: Because
, the slope of 
at any value of is equal to the height of 
.
(Of course, this is the exact opposite of the procedure we used in Example 1 in Sec-
tion 2.7 to sketch a derivative.)
Therefore, since 
, we start drawing the graph of 
at the given point 
with slope 0, always increasing, with upward concavity to 
, downward concavity 
to 
, and upward concavity when 
. (See Figure 9.) Notice that 
, 
so 
has a gentle slope at the second inﬂection point. But we see that the slope
becomes steeper when 
.
(e) The antiderivative of 
that we sketched in Figure 9 satisﬁes 
, so its graph
starts at the point 
. But there are many other antiderivatives, whose graphs start at
other points on the y-axis. In fact, 
has inﬁnitely many antiderivatives; their graphs are
obtained from the graph of 
by shifting upward or downward as in Figure 10.

Focus on Problem Solving
In our discussion of the principles of problem solving we considered the problem-solving
strategy of introducing something extra (see page 83). In the following example we show
how this principle is sometimes useful when we evaluate limits. The idea is to change the
variable—to introduce a new variable that is related to the original variable—in such a way
as to make the problem simpler. Later, in Section 5.5, we will make more extensive use of
this general idea.
Evaluate 
, where c is a constant.
SOLUTION As it stands, this limit looks challenging. In Section 2.3 we evaluated several
limits in which both numerator and denominator approached 0. There our strategy was to
perform some sort of algebraic manipulation that led to a simplifying cancellation, but
here it’s not clear what kind of algebra is necessary.
So we introduce a new variable t by the equation
We also need to express x in terms of t, so we solve this equation:
Notice that 
is equivalent to 
. This allows us to convert the given limit into
one involving the variable t:
The change of variable allowed us to replace a relatively complicated limit by a simpler
one of a type that we have seen before. Factoring the denominator as a difference of
cubes, we get
In making the change of variable we had to rule out the case 
. But if 
, the
function is for all nonzero and so its limit is . Therefore, in all cases, the limit is 
.
How many lines are tangent to both of the parabolas 
and
? Find the coordinates of the points at which these tangents touch the 
parabolas.
SOLUTION To gain insight into this problem it is essential to draw a diagram. So we
sketch the parabolas 
(which is the standard parabola 
shifted 1 unit
upward) and 
(which is obtained by reﬂecting the ﬁrst parabola about the 
x-axis). If we try to draw a line tangent to both parabolas, we soon discover that there are
only two possibilities, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Before you look at Example 2, cover up the
solution and try it yourself ﬁrst.

Let P be a point at which one of these tangents touches the upper parabola and let a
be its x-coordinate. (The choice of notation for the unknown is important. Of course we
could have used b or c or 
or 
instead of a. However, it’s not advisable to use x in
place of a because that x could be confused with the variable x in the equation of the
parabola.) Then, since P lies on the parabola 
, its y-coordinate must be 
. Because of the symmetry shown in Figure 1, the coordinates of the point Q
where the tangent touches the lower parabola must be 
.
To use the given information that the line is a tangent, we equate the slope of the line
PQ to the slope of the tangent line at P. We have
If 
, then the slope of the tangent line at P is 
. Using the deﬁnition of
the derivative as in Section 2.6, we ﬁnd that 
. Thus the condition that we need
to use is that
Solving this equation, we get 
, so 
and 
. Therefore the 
points are (1, 2) and (1, 2). By symmetry, the two remaining points are (1, 2) 
and (1, 2).
The following problems are meant to test and challenge your problem-solving skills.
Some of them require a considerable amount of time to think through, so don’t be discour-
aged if you can’t solve them right away. If you get stuck, you might ﬁnd it helpful to refer
to the discussion of the principles of problem solving on page 83.

Differentiation Rules
We have seen how to interpret derivatives as slopes and rates of change. We
have seen how to estimate derivatives of functions given by tables of values. We
have learned how to graph derivatives of functions that are deﬁned graphically.
We have used the deﬁnition of a derivative to calculate the derivatives of func-
tions deﬁned by formulas. But it would be tedious if we always had to use the
deﬁnition, so in this chapter we develop rules for ﬁnding derivatives without
having to use the deﬁnition directly. These differentiation rules enable us to 
calculate with relative ease the derivatives of polynomials, rational functions,
algebraic functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, and trigonometric and
inverse trigonometric functions. We then use these rules to solve problems
involving rates of change, tangents to parametric curves, and the approximation
of functions.

DIFFERENTIATION RULES
In this section we learn how to differentiate constant functions, power functions, polyno-
mials, and exponential functions.
Let’s start with the simplest of all functions, the constant function 
. The graph
of this function is the horizontal line y  c, which has slope 0, so we must have 
.
(See Figure 1.) A formal proof, from the deﬁnition of a derivative, is also easy:
In Leibniz notation, we write this rule as follows.

Power Functions
We next look at the functions 
, where n is a positive integer. If 
, the graph
of 
is the line y  x, which has slope 1. (See Figure 2.) So
(You can also verify Equation 1 from the deﬁnition of a derivative.) We have already 
investigated the cases 
and

found that

be true.

In ﬁnding the derivative of

and we use the Binomial Theorem to do so:
because every term except the ﬁrst has as a factor and therefore approaches 0.

(b)
The Power Rule enables us to ﬁnd tangent lines without having to resort to the deﬁ-
nition of a derivative. It also enables us to ﬁnd normal lines. The normal line to a curve 
at a point 
is the line through 
that is perpendicular to the tangent line at . (In the study
of optics, one needs to consider the angle between a light ray and the normal line to a lens.)
Find equations of the tangent line and normal line to the curve 
at the point 
. Illustrate by graphing the curve and these lines.
SOLUTION The derivative of 
is
So the slope of the tangent line at (1, 1) is 
. Therefore an equation of the tan-
gent line is
The normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line, so its slope is the negative recipro-
cal of , that is, 
. Thus an equation of the normal line is

New Derivatives from Old
When new functions are formed from old functions by addition, subtraction, or multipli-
cation by a constant, their derivatives can be calculated in terms of derivatives of the old
functions. In particular, the following formula says that the derivative of a constant times
a function is the constant times the derivative of the function.
The Constant Multiple Rule If c is a constant and 
is a differentiable function, then

derivatives.

The Sum Rule can be extended to the sum of any number of functions. For instance,
using this theorem twice, we get
By writing

Rule, we get the following formula.
The Difference Rule If f and t are both differentiable, then
The Constant Multiple Rule, the Sum Rule, and the Difference Rule can be combined
with the Power Rule to differentiate any polynomial, as the following examples demonstrate.

Exponential Functions
Let’s try to compute the derivative of the exponential function 
using the deﬁni-
tion of a derivative:
The factor 
doesn’t depend on h, so we can take it in front of the limit:
Notice that the limit is the value of the derivative of 
at , that is,
Therefore we have shown that if the exponential function 
is differentiable at 0,
then it is differentiable everywhere and
This equation says that the rate of change of any exponential function is proportional to
the function itself. (The slope is proportional to the height.)
Numerical evidence for the existence of 
is given in the table at the left for the
cases 
and 
. (Values are stated correct to four decimal places.) It appears that
the limits exist and 
In fact, it can be proved that these limits exist and, correct to six decimal places, the val-
ues are
Thus, from Equation 4, we have
Of all possible choices for the base in Equation 4, the simplest differentiation formula
occurs when 
. In view of the estimates of 
for 
and

sonable that there is a number 
between 2 and 3 for which 
. It is traditional to
denote this value by the letter . (In fact, that is how we introduced e in Section 1.5.) Thus

CHAPTER 3
DIFFERENTIATION RULES
Deﬁnition of the Number e
Geometrically, this means that of all the possible exponential functions 
, the
function 
is the one whose tangent line at (
has a slope 
that is exactly 1.
(See Figures 6 and 7.)
If we put 
and, therefore, 
in Equation 4, it becomes the following impor-
tant differentiation formula.
Derivative of the Natural Exponential Function
Thus the exponential function 
has the property that it is its own derivative.
The geometrical signiﬁcance of this fact is that the slope of a tangent line to the curve
is equal to the -coordinate of the point (see Figure 7).
If 
, ﬁnd 
and 
. Compare the graphs of 
and .
SOLUTION Using the Difference Rule, we have
In Section 2.7 we deﬁned the second derivative as the derivative of 
, so
The function f and its derivative 
are graphed in Figure 8. Notice that

tal tangent when

Building a Better Roller Coaster
Suppose you are asked to design the ﬁrst ascent and drop for a new roller coaster. By studying
photographs of your favorite coasters, you decide to make the slope of the ascent 0.8 and the slope
of the drop 
. You decide to connect these two straight stretches 
and 
with
part of a parabola 
, where and 
are measured in feet. For the track
to be smooth there can’t be abrupt changes in direction, so you want the linear segments 
and 
to be tangent to the parabola at the transition points 
and . (See the ﬁgure.) To simplify the
equations, you decide to place the origin at .
1. (a) Suppose the horizontal distance between 
and 
is 100 ft. Write equations in , ,
and that will ensure that the track is smooth at the transition points.
(b) Solve the equations in part (a) for 
to ﬁnd a formula for

the design by using a quadratic function 
only on the interval
and connecting it to the linear functions by means of two cubic functions:
(a) Write a system of equations in 11 unknowns that ensure that the functions and their
ﬁrst two derivatives agree at the transition points.

The Product Rule
| By analogy with the Sum and Difference Rules, one might be tempted to guess, as  Leibniz
did three centuries ago, that the derivative of a product is the product of the derivatives. We
can see, however, that this guess is wrong by looking at a particular example. Let fx  x

and 
. Then the Power Rule gives 
and 
. But 
, so
. Thus 
. The correct formula was discovered by Leibniz (soon
after his false start) and is called the Product Rule.
Before stating the Product Rule, let’s see how we might discover it. We start by assum-
ing that 
and 
are both positive differentiable functions. Then we can
interpret the product 
as an area of a rectangle (see Figure 1). If x changes by an amount
, then the corresponding changes in u and are
and the new value of the product, 
, can be interpreted as the area of the
large rectangle in Figure 1 (provided that 
and 
happen to be positive).
The change in the area of the rectangle is
If we divide by 
, we get
If we now let 
, we get the derivative of 
:
(Notice that 
as 
since 
is differentiable and therefore continuous.)
Although we started by assuming (for the geometric interpretation) that all the quanti-
ties are positive, we notice that Equation 1 is always true. (The algebra is valid whether u,
, 
, and 
are positive or negative.) So we have proved Equation 2, known as the
Product Rule, for all differentiable functions u and .
The Product Rule If 
and are both differentiable, then
In words, the Product Rule says that the derivative of a product of two functions is the
ﬁrst function times the derivative of the second function plus the second function times the
derivative of the ﬁrst function.

SOLUTION Applying the Product Rule, we get
So
Interpreting the terms in the Product Rule
A telephone company wants to
estimate the number of new residential phone lines that it will need to install during the
upcoming month. At the beginning of January the company had 100,000 subscribers,
each of whom had 1.2 phone lines, on average. The company estimated that its sub-
scribership was increasing at the rate of 1000 monthly. By polling its existing sub-
scribers, the company found that each intended to install an average of 0.01 new phone
lines by the end of January. Estimate the number of new lines the company will have to
install in January by calculating the rate of increase of lines at the beginning of the
month.
SOLUTION Let 
be the number of subscribers and let 
be the number of phone lines
per subscriber at time t, where t is measured in months and t  0 corresponds to the
beginning of January. Then the total number of lines is given by
and we want to ﬁnd 
. According to the Product Rule, we have
We are given that 
and 
. The company’s estimates concerning
rates of increase are that 
and 
. Therefore
The company will need to install approximately 2200 new phone lines in January.
Notice that the two terms arising from the Product Rule come from different sources—
old subscribers and new subscribers. One contribution to 
is the number of existing sub-
scribers (100,000) times the rate at which they order new lines (about 0.01 per subscriber
monthly). A second contribution is the average number of lines per subscriber (1.2 at the
beginning of the month) times the rate of increase of subscribers (1000 monthly).
The Quotient Rule
We ﬁnd a rule for differentiating the quotient of two differentiable functions 
and
in much the same way that we found the Product Rule. If , , and change by
amounts

The Quotient Rule If 
and are differentiable, then
In words, the Quotient Rule says that the derivative of a quotient is the denominator
times the derivative of the numerator minus the numerator times the derivative of the
denominator, all divided by the square of the denominator.
The Quotient Rule and the other differentiation formulas enable us to compute the
derivative of any rational function, as the next example illustrates.

This means that the tangent line at

Note: Don’t use the Quotient Rule every time you see a quotient. Sometimes it’s eas-
ier to rewrite a quotient ﬁrst to put it in a form that is simpler for the purpose of differen-
tiation. For instance, although it is possible to differentiate the function
using the Quotient Rule, it is much easier to perform the division ﬁrst and write the func-
tion as
before differentiating.

49. In this exercise we estimate the rate at which the total personal
income is rising in the Richmond-Petersburg, Virginia, metro-
politan area. In 1999, the population of this area was 961,400,
and the population was increasing at roughly 9200 people per
year. The average annual income was $30,593 per capita, and
this average was increasing at about $1400 per year (a little
above the national average of about $1225 yearly). Use the
Product Rule and these ﬁgures to estimate the rate at which
total personal income was rising in the Richmond-Petersburg
area in 1999. Explain the meaning of each term in the Product
Rule.

Before starting this section, you might need to review the trigonometric functions. In par-
ticular, it is important to remember that when we talk about the function 
deﬁned for all
real numbers by
it is understood that 
means the sine of the angle whose radian measure is . A simi-
lar convention holds for the other trigonometric functions cos, tan, csc, sec, and cot. Recall

from Section 2.4 that all of the trigonometric functions are continuous at every number in
their domains.
If we sketch the graph of the function 
and use the interpretation of 
as the slope of the tangent to the sine curve in order to sketch the graph of 
(see Exer-
cise 14 in Section 2.7), then it looks as if the graph of 
may be the same as the cosine
curve (see Figure 1).
Let’s try to conﬁrm our guess that if

tion of a derivative, we have
Two of these four limits are easy to evaluate. Since we regard x as a constant when com-
puting a limit as

We now use a geometric argument to prove Equation 2. Assume ﬁrst that 
lies between 
0 and 
. Figure 2(a) shows a sector of a circle with center O, central angle , and 
radius 1. BC is drawn perpendicular to OA. By the deﬁnition of radian measure, we have
arc
. Also 
. From the diagram we see that
Therefore
so
Let the tangent lines at 
and 
intersect at . You can see from Figure 2(b) that the 
circumference of a circle is smaller than the length of a circumscribed polygon, and so
arc
. Thus
Therefore we have
so
We know that 
and 
, so by the Squeeze Theorem, we have
But the function 
is an even function, so its right and left limits must be equal.
Hence, we have
so we have proved Equation 2.
We can deduce the value of the remaining limit in (1) as follows:

If we now put the limits (2) and (3) in (1), we get
So we have proved the formula for the derivative of the sine function:
Differentiate

SOLUTION Using the Product Rule and Formula 4, we have
Using the same methods as in the proof of Formula 4, one can prove (see Exercise 18)
that

The derivatives of the remaining trigonometric functions, 
, 
, and 
, can also be
found easily using the Quotient Rule (see Exercises 15–17). We collect all the differentia-
tion formulas for trigonometric functions in the following table. Remember that they are
valid only when is measured in radians.
Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions
Differentiate 
. For what values of x does the graph of 
have a horizontal tangent?
SOLUTION The Quotient Rule gives 
In simplifying the answer we have used the identity 
.
Since 
is never 0, we see that 
when 
, and this occurs when
, where n is an integer (see Figure 4).
Trigonometric functions are often used in modeling real-world phenomena. In particu-
lar, vibrations, waves, elastic motions, and other quantities that vary in a periodic manner
can be described using trigonometric functions. In the following example we discuss an
instance of simple harmonic motion.

The object oscillates from the lowest point 
to the highest point
. The period of the oscillation is 
, the period of

The speed is

The only ﬂaw in this reasoning is that in (1) it might happen that

suggest that the Chain Rule is true. A full proof of the Chain Rule is given at the end of

James Gregory
The ﬁrst person to formulate the Chain Rule
was the Scottish mathematician James Gregory
(1638–1675), who also designed the ﬁrst practi-
cal reﬂecting telescope. Gregory discovered the
basic ideas of calculus at about the same time
as Newton. He became the ﬁrst Professor of
Mathematics at the University of St. Andrews
and later held the same position at the Univer-
sity of Edinburgh. But one year after accepting
that position he died at the age of 36.

Equation 3 is easy to remember because if

thought of as an actual quotient.

of

Note: In using the Chain Rule we work from the outside to the inside. Formula 2 says
that we differentiate the outer function

inner function is the sine function. So
The answer can be left as 
or written as 
(by a trigonometric identity
known as the double-angle formula).
In Example 2(a) we combined the Chain Rule with the rule for differentiating the sine
function. In general, if 
, where 
is a differentiable function of , then, by the
Chain Rule,
Thus
In a similar fashion, all of the formulas for differentiating trigonometric functions can
be combined with the Chain Rule.
Let’s make explicit the special case of the Chain Rule where the outer function 
is a
power function. If

the Chain Rule and then the Power Rule, we get

THE CHAIN RULE
203
Tangents to Parametric Curves
In Section 1.7 we discussed curves deﬁned by parametric equations
The Chain Rule helps us ﬁnd tangent lines to such curves. Suppose 
and are differen-
tiable functions and we want to ﬁnd the tangent line at a point on the curve where is also
a differentiable function of . Then the Chain Rule gives
If 
, we can solve for 
:
Equation 7 (which you can remember by thinking of canceling the 
’s) enables us 
to ﬁnd the slope 
of the tangent to a parametric curve without having to eliminate 
the parameter . We see from (7) that the curve has a horizontal tangent when 
(provided that 
) and it has a vertical tangent when 
(provided that
).
Find an equation of the tangent line to the parametric curve
at the point 
. Where does this curve have horizontal or vertical tangents?
SOLUTION At the point with parameter value , the slope is
The point 
corresponds to the parameter value 
, so the slope of the tan-
gent at that point is
An equation of the tangent line is therefore

How to Prove the Chain Rule
Recall that if 
and x changes from a to 
, we deﬁned the increment of y as
According to the deﬁnition of a derivative, we have
So if we denote by 
the difference between the difference quotient and the derivative, 
we obtain
But
If we deﬁne 
to be 0 when 
, then 
becomes a continuous function of 
. Thus,
for a differentiable function f, we can write
and 
is a continuous function of 
. This property of differentiable functions is what
enables us to prove the Chain Rule.
PROOF OF THE CHAIN RULE Suppose

is differ-
entiable at

is an increment in x and 
and 
are the corresponding
increments in u and y, then we can use Equation 8 to write

where

LABORATORY PROJECT
; Bézier Curves
Bézier curves are used in computer-aided design and are named after the French mathema-
tician Pierre Bézier (1910–1999), who worked in the automotive industry. A cubic Bézier curve 
is determined by four control points, 
and 
, and is 
deﬁned by the parametric equations
where 
. Notice that when 
we have 
and when 
we have
, so the curve starts at 
and ends at 
.
1. Graph the Bézier curve with control points 
, 
, 
, and 
Then, on the same screen, graph the line segments 
, 
, and 
. (Exercise 29 in 
Section 1.7 shows how to do this.) Notice that the middle control points 
and 
don’t lie
on the curve; the curve starts at 
, heads toward 
and 
without reaching them, and ends 
at 
.
2. From the graph in Problem 1, it appears that the tangent at 
passes through 
and the 
tangent at 
passes through 
. Prove it.

IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION

The functions that we have met so far can be described by expressing one variable explic-
itly in terms of another variable—for example,
or
or, in general, 
. Some functions, however, are deﬁned implicitly by a relation
between and such as

3. Try to produce a Bézier curve with a loop by changing the second control point in 
Problem 1.
4. Some laser printers use Bézier curves to represent letters and other symbols. Experiment 
with control points until you ﬁnd a Bézier curve that gives a reasonable representation of the 
letter C.
5. More complicated shapes can be represented by piecing together two or more Bézier curves.
Suppose the ﬁrst Bézier curve has control points 
and the second one has con-
trol points 
. If we want these two pieces to join together smoothly, then the
tangents at 
should match and so the points 
, 
, and 
all have to lie on this common
tangent line. Using this principle, ﬁnd control points for a pair of Bézier curves that repre-
sent the letter S.

Where Should a Pilot Start Descent?
An approach path for an aircraft landing is shown in the ﬁgure and satisﬁes the following 
conditions:
(i) The cruising altitude is when descent starts at a horizontal distance
from touch-
down at the origin.
(ii) The pilot must maintain a constant horizontal speed throughout descent.
(iii) The absolute value of the vertical acceleration should not exceed a constant (which
is much less than the acceleration due to gravity). 
1. Find a cubic polynomial 
that satisﬁes condition (i) by
imposing suitable conditions on 
and 
at the start of descent and at touchdown.
2. Use conditions (ii) and (iii) to show that

mih . If the cruising altitude of a plane is 35,000 ft and the speed is 300 mih,

In some cases it is possible to solve such an equation for as an explicit function (or sev-
eral functions) of . For instance, if we solve Equation 1 for , we get 
, 
so two of the functions determined by the implicit Equation l are 
and
. The graphs of 
and 
are the upper and lower semicircles of the 
circle 
. (See Figure 1.)
It’s not easy to solve Equation 2 for 
explicitly as a function of

puter algebra system has no trouble, but the expressions it obtains are very complicated.)
Nonetheless, (2) is the equation of a curve called the folium of Descartes shown in 
Figure 2 and it implicitly deﬁnes as several functions of . The graphs of three such func-
tions are shown in Figure 3. When we say that 
is a function deﬁned implicitly by Equa-
tion 2, we mean that the equation
is true for all values of in the domain of .
Fortunately, we don’t need to solve an equation for in terms of 
in order to ﬁnd the
derivative of . Instead we can use the method of implicit differentiation. This consists of
differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to 
and then solving the resulting
equation for

SOLUTION 2
(b) Solving the equation 
, we get

Recall from Section 1.6 that the only functions that have inverse functions are one-to-one
functions. Trigonometric functions, however, are not one-to-one and so they don’t have
inverse functions. But we can make them one-to-one by restricting their domains and we
will see that the inverses of these restricted trigonometric functions play a major role in
integral calculus.
You can see from Figure 1 that the sine function 
is not one-to-one (use the
Horizontal Line Test). But the function 
, is one-to-one
(see Figure 2). The inverse function of this restricted sine function 
exists and is denoted
by 
or 
. It is called the inverse sine function or the arcsine function.

The inverse sine function,

and range 
, and its
graph, shown in Figure 4, is obtained from that of the restricted sine function (Figure 2)
by reﬂection about the line 
. We know that the sine function 
is continuous, so the
inverse sine function is also continuous.
We can use implicit differentiation to ﬁnd the derivative of the inverse sine function,
assuming that it is differentiable. (The differentiability is certainly plausible from its graph

The same method can be used to ﬁnd a formula
for the derivative of any inverse function. See
Exercise 41.

If 
, ﬁnd (a) the domain of , (b) 
, and (c) the
domain of .
SOLUTION
(a) Since the domain of the inverse sine function is 
, the domain of 
is
(b) Combining Formula 1 with the Chain Rule, we have
(c) The domain of 
is
The inverse cosine function is handled similarly. The restricted cosine function
, 
, is one-to-one (see Figure 6) and so it has an inverse function
denoted by 
or 
.
The inverse cosine function, 
, has domain 
and range 
and is a con-
tinuous function whose graph is shown in Figure 7. Its derivative is given by
Formula 2 can be proved by the same method as for Formula 1 and is left as Exercise 15.
The tangent function can be made one-to-one by restricting it to the interval
. Thus the inverse tangent function is deﬁned as the inverse of the function
, as shown in Figure 8. It is denoted by 
or 
.
Simplify the expression

Its graph is shown in Figure 10.
We know that
and so the lines

In this section we use implicit differentiation to ﬁnd the derivatives of the logarithmic func-
tions 
and, in particular, the natural logarithmic function 
. (It can be
proved that logarithmic functions are differentiable; this is certainly plausible from their
graphs. See Figure 4 in Section 1.6 for the graphs of the logarithmic functions.)
PROOF Let 
. Then
Differentiating this equation implicitly with respect to x, using Formula 3.4.5, we get
and so
If we put 
in Formula 1, then the factor 
on the right side becomes 
and we get the formula for the derivative of the natural logarithmic function
:
By comparing Formulas 1 and 2, we see one of the main reasons that natural logarithms
(logarithms with base e) are used in calculus: The differentiation formula is simplest when

HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS

DISCOVERY PROJECT
Hyperbolic Functions
Certain combinations of the exponential functions 
and 
arise so frequently in mathematics
and its applications that they deserve to be given special names. This project explores the proper-
ties of functions called hyperbolic functions. The hyperbolic sine, hyperbolic cosine, hyper-
bolic tangent, and hyperbolic secant functions are deﬁned as follows:
The reason for the names of these functions is that they are related to the hyperbola in much the
same way that the trigonometric functions are related to the circle.
1. (a) Sketch, by hand, the graphs of the functions 
and 
on the same axes
and use graphical addition to draw the graph of cosh.
;
(b) Check the accuracy of your sketch in part (a) by using a graphing calculator or com-
puter to graph 
. What are the domain and range of this function?
; 2. The most famous application of hyperbolic functions is the use of hyperbolic cosine 
to describe the shape of a hanging wire. It can be proved that if a heavy ﬂexible cable
(such as a telephone or power line) is suspended between two points at the same height,
then it takes the shape of a curve with equation 
called a catenary. (The
Latin word catena means “chain.”) Graph several members of the family of functions
. How does the graph change as varies?
; 3. Graph sinh and tanh. Judging from their graphs, which of the functions sinh, cosh, and
tanh are even? Which are odd? Use the deﬁnitions to prove your assertions.
4. Prove the identity 
.
; 5. Graph the curve with parametric equations 
, 
. Can you identify this
curve?
6. Prove the identity 
.
7. The identities in Problems 4 and 6 are similar to well-known trigonometric identities. Try
to discover other hyperbolic identities by using known trigonometric identities (Reference
Page 2) as your inspiration.
8. The differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions are analogous to those for 
the trigonometric functions, but the signs are sometimes different.

CHAPTER 3
DIFFERENTIATION RULES
We know that if 
, then the derivative 
can be interpreted as the rate of change
of with respect to . In this section we examine some of the applications of this idea to
physics, chemistry, biology, economics, and other sciences.
Let’s recall from Section 2.6 the basic idea behind rates of change. If 
changes from
to 
, then the change in is
and the corresponding change in is
The difference quotient 
is the average rate of change of y with respect to x over the interval 
and can be
interpreted as the slope of the secant line 
in Figure 1. Its limit as 
is the deriv-
ative 
, which can therefore be interpreted as the instantaneous rate of change of y
with respect to x or the slope of the tangent line at 
. Using Leibniz notation,
we write the process in the form
Whenever the function 
has a speciﬁc interpretation in one of the sciences, its
derivative will have a speciﬁc interpretation as a rate of change. (As we discussed in Sec-
tion 2.6, the units for 
are the units for y divided by the units for x.) We now look at
some of these interpretations in the natural and social sciences.
Physics
If 
is the position function of a particle that is moving in a straight line, then 
represents the average velocity over a time period 
, and 
represents the instan-
taneous velocity (the rate of change of displacement with respect to time). The instanta-
neous rate of change of velocity with respect to time is acceleration: 
.
This was discussed in Sections 2.6 and 2.7, but now that we know the differentiation for-
mulas, we are able to solve problems involving the motion of objects more easily.
Analyzing the motion of a particle
The position of a particle is given by
the equation
where is measured in seconds and in meters.
(a) Find the velocity at time .
(b) What is the velocity after 2 s? After 4 s?
(c) When is the particle at rest?
(d) When is the particle moving forward (that is, in the positive direction)?
(e) Draw a diagram to represent the motion of the particle.
(f) Find the total distance traveled by the particle during the ﬁrst ﬁve seconds.
(g) Find the acceleration at time and after 4 s.

(i) When is the particle speeding up? When is it slowing down?
SOLUTION
(a) The velocity function is the derivative of the position function.
(b) The velocity after 2 s means the instantaneous velocity when 
, that is,
The velocity after 4 s is
(c) The particle is at rest when 
, that is,
and this is true when 
or 
. Thus the particle is at rest after 1 s and after 3 s.
(d) The particle moves in the positive direction when 
, that is, 
This inequality is true when both factors are positive 
or when both factors are
negative 
. Thus the particle moves in the positive direction in the time intervals
and 
. It moves backward (in the negative direction) when 
.
(e) Using the information from part (d) we make a schematic sketch in Figure 2 of the
motion of the particle back and forth along a line (the -axis).
(f) Because of what we learned in parts (d) and (e), we need to calculate the distances
traveled during the time intervals [0, 1], [1, 3], and [3, 5] separately.
The distance traveled in the ﬁrst second is
From

(i) The particle speeds up when the velocity is positive and increasing (
are both
positive) and also when the velocity is negative and decreasing (
are both nega-
tive). In other words, the particle speeds up when the velocity and acceleration have the
same sign. (The particle is pushed in the same direction it is moving.) From Figure 3 we
see that this happens when 
and when 
. The particle slows down when

and when

Linear density
If a rod or piece of wire is homogeneous, then its linear
density is uniform and is deﬁned as the mass per unit length 
and measured in
kilograms per meter. Suppose, however, that the rod is not homogeneous but that its
mass measured from its left end to a point is 
, as shown in Figure 5.
The mass of the part of the rod that lies between 
and 
is given by
, so the average density of that part of the rod is
If we now let 
(that is, 
), we are computing the average density over
smaller and smaller intervals. The linear density
at 
is the limit of these average
densities as 
; that is, the linear density is the rate of change of mass with respect
to length. Symbolically, 
Thus the linear density of the rod is the derivative of mass with respect to length.

Current is the derivative of charge
A current exists whenever electric
charges move. Figure 6 shows part of a wire and electrons moving through a plane sur-
face, shaded red. If 
is the net charge that passes through this surface during a time
period 
, then the average current during this time interval is deﬁned as
If we take the limit of this average current over smaller and smaller time intervals, we
get what is called the current
at a given time :
Thus the current is the rate at which charge ﬂows through a surface. It is measured in
units of charge per unit time (often coulombs per second, called amperes).
Velocity, density, and current are not the only rates of change that are important in
physics. Others include power (the rate at which work is done), the rate of heat ﬂow, tem-
perature gradient (the rate of change of temperature with respect to position), and the rate
of decay of a radioactive substance in nuclear physics.
Chemistry
Rate of reaction
A chemical reaction results in the formation of one or
more substances (called products) from one or more starting materials (called reactants).
For instance, the “equation”
indicates that two molecules of hydrogen and one molecule of oxygen form two mole-
cules of water. Let’s consider the reaction
where A and B are the reactants and C is the product. The concentration of a reactant A
is the number of moles (
6.022
10
molecules) per liter and is denoted by
. The concentration varies during a reaction, so 
, 
, and

time 
. The average rate of reaction of the product C over a time interval 
is
But chemists are more interested in the instantaneous rate of reaction, which is
obtained by taking the limit of the average rate of reaction as the time interval 
approaches 0:
Since the concentration of the product increases as the reaction proceeds, the derivative
will be positive, and so the rate of reaction of C is positive. The concentrations
of the reactants, however, decrease during the reaction, so, to make the rates of reaction
of A and B positive numbers, we put minus signs in front of the derivatives 
and
. Since A and B each decrease at the same rate that C increases, we have
More generally, it turns out that for a reaction of the form
we have
The rate of reaction can be determined from data and graphical methods. In some cases
there are explicit formulas for the concentrations as functions of time, which enable us to
compute the rate of reaction (see Exercise 22).
Compressibility
One of the quantities of interest in thermodynamics is com-
pressibility. If a given substance is kept at a constant temperature, then its volume 
depends on its pressure . We can consider the rate of change of volume with respect to
pressure—namely, the derivative 
. As 
increases, 
decreases, so 
. The
compressibility is deﬁned by introducing a minus sign and dividing this derivative by
the volume :
Thus 
measures how fast, per unit volume, the volume of a substance decreases as the
pressure on it increases at constant temperature.
For instance, the volume 
(in cubic meters) of a sample of air at 
was found to
be related to the pressure 
(in kilopascals) by the equation

Rate of growth of a population
Let 
be the number of individuals in
an animal or plant population at time . The change in the population size between the

, and so the average rate of growth during

is
The instantaneous rate of growth is obtained from this average rate of growth by let-
ting the time period 
approach 0:
Strictly speaking, this is not quite accurate because the actual graph of a population
function 
would be a step function that is discontinuous whenever a birth or
death occurs and therefore not differentiable. However, for a large animal or plant

To be more speciﬁc, consider a population of bacteria in a homogeneous nutrient
medium. Suppose that by sampling the population at certain intervals it is determined
that the population doubles every hour. If the initial population is

measured in hours, then
and, in general,
The population function is

In Section 3.4 we showed that
So the rate of growth of the bacteria population at time t is
For example, suppose that we start with an initial population of 
bacteria. Then
the rate of growth after 4 hours is
This means that, after 4 hours, the bacteria population is growing at a rate of about
1109 bacteria per hour.
Blood flow
When we consider the ﬂow of blood through a blood vessel,
such as a vein or artery, we can model the shape of the blood vessel by a cylindrical tube
with radius 
and length as illustrated in Figure 8.
Because of friction at the walls of the tube, the velocity of the blood is greatest
along the central axis of the tube and decreases as the distance from the axis increases
until becomes 0 at the wall. The relationship between and is given by the law of
laminar ﬂow discovered by the French physician Jean-Louis-Marie Poiseuille in 1840.
This law states that
where 
is the viscosity of the blood and 
is the pressure difference between the ends
of the tube. If 
and are constant, then is a function of with domain

The average rate of change of the velocity as we move from 
outward to

and if we let

change of velocity with respect to r:
Using Equation 1, we obtain
For one of the smaller human arteries we can take

At 
cm the blood is ﬂowing at a speed of

To get a feeling for what this statement means, let’s change our units from centi-
meters to micrometers (

m). Then the radius of the artery is 

m. The
velocity at the central axis is 

ms, which decreases to 

ms at a distance
of 

m. The fact that

velocity is decreasing at a rate of about 

ms for each micrometer that we proceed
away from the center.

Marginal cost
Suppose

producing
units of a certain commodity. The function 
is called a cost function. If
the number of items produced is increased from 
to

with respect to the number of items produced, is called the marginal cost by economists:
[Since often takes on only integer values, it may not make literal sense to let 
approach 0, but we can always replace 
by a smooth approximating function as in
Example 6.]
Taking 
and large (so that 
is small compared to ), we have
Thus the marginal cost of producing units is approximately equal to the cost of pro-
ducing one more unit, the 
st unit.
It is often appropriate to represent a total cost function by a polynomial
where represents the overhead cost (rent, heat, maintenance) and the other terms 
represent the cost of raw materials, labor, and so on. (The cost of raw materials may be
proportional to , but labor costs might depend partly on higher powers of because of
overtime costs and inefﬁciencies involved in large-scale operations.)
For instance, suppose a company has estimated that the cost (in dollars) of producing
items is
Then the marginal cost function is
The marginal cost at the production level of 500 items is
This gives the rate at which costs are increasing with respect to the production level
when 
and predicts the cost of the 501st item.
The actual cost of producing the 501st item is
Notice that

Economists also study marginal demand, marginal revenue, and marginal proﬁt, which
are the derivatives of the demand, revenue, and proﬁt functions. These will be considered
in Chapter 4 after we have developed techniques for ﬁnding the maximum and minimum
values of functions.

urban geographer is interested in the rate of change of the population density in a city as
the distance from the city center increases. A meteorologist is concerned with the rate of
change of atmospheric pressure with respect to height (see Exercise 17 in Section 7.4).
In psychology, those interested in learning theory study the so-called learning curve,
which graphs the performance 
of someone learning a skill as a function of the train-
ing time . Of particular interest is the rate at which performance improves as time passes,
that is, 
.
In sociology, differential calculus is used in analyzing the spread of rumors (or innova-
tions or fads or fashions). If 
denotes the proportion of a population that knows a rumor
by time , then the derivative 
represents the rate of spread of the rumor (see Exer-
cise 74 in Section 3.4).
A Single Idea, Many Interpretations
Velocity, density, current, power, and temperature gradient in physics; rate of reaction and
compressibility in chemistry; rate of growth and blood velocity gradient in biology; mar-
ginal cost and marginal proﬁt in economics; rate of heat ﬂow in geology; rate of improve-
ment of performance in psychology; rate of spread of a rumor in sociology—these are all
special cases of a single mathematical concept, the derivative.
This is an illustration of the fact that part of the power of mathematics lies in its
abstractness. A single abstract mathematical concept (such as the derivative) can have dif-
ferent interpretations in each of the sciences. When we develop the properties of the math-
ematical concept once and for all, we can then turn around and apply these results to all of
the sciences. This is much more efﬁcient than developing properties of special concepts in
each separate science. The French mathematician Joseph Fourier (1768–1830) put it suc-
cinctly: “Mathematics compares the most diverse phenomena and discovers the secret
analogies that unite them.”

We have seen that a curve lies very close to its tangent line near the point of tangency. In
fact, by zooming in toward a point on the graph of a differentiable function, we noticed
that the graph looks more and more like its tangent line. (See Figure 2 in Section 2.6.) This
observation is the basis for a method of ﬁnding approximate values of functions.
The idea is that it might be easy to calculate a value 
of a function, but difﬁcult (or
even impossible) to compute nearby values of f. So we settle for the easily computed val-
ues of the linear function L whose graph is the tangent line of f at 
. (See Figure 1.)
In other words, we use the tangent line at 
as an approximation to the curve
when x is near a. An equation of this tangent line is

and the approximation
is called the linear approximation or tangent line approximation of f at a. The linear
function whose graph is this tangent line, that is,
is called the linearization of f at a.
The following example is typical of situations in which we use a linear approximation
to predict the future behavior of a function given by empirical data.
Predicting from a linear approximation
Suppose that after you stuff a
turkey its temperature is 
and you then put it in a 
oven. After an hour the
meat thermometer indicates that the temperature of the turkey is 
and after two
hours it indicates 
. Predict the temperature of the turkey after three hours.
SOLUTION If 
represents the temperature of the turkey after t hours, we are given that
, and 
. In order to make a linear approximation with
, we need an estimate for the derivative 
. Because
we could estimate 
by the difference quotient with t  1:
This amounts to approximating the instantaneous rate of temperature change by the
average rate of change between 
and 
, which is 
. With this estimate, 
the linear approximation (1) for the temperature after 3 h is
So the predicted temperature after three hours is 
.
We obtain a more accurate estimate for 
by plotting the given data, as in Fig-
ure 2, and estimating the slope of the tangent line at 
to be
Then our linear approximation becomes
and our improved estimate for the temperature is 
.
Because the temperature curve lies below the tangent line, it appears that the actual
temperature after three hours will be somewhat less than 
, perhaps closer to
.
Find the linearization of the function 
at 
and use it
to approximate the numbers 
and 
. Are these approximations overestimates
or underestimates?

SOLUTION The derivative of 
is
and so we have 
and 
. Putting these values into Equation 2, we see that
the linearization is
The corresponding linear approximation (1) is
(when is near )
In particular, we have
The linear approximation is illustrated in Figure 3. We see that, indeed, the tangent
line approximation is a good approximation to the given function when is near l. We
also see that our approximations are overestimates because the tangent line lies above the
curve.
Of course, a calculator could give us approximations for 
and 
, but the
linear approximation gives an approximation over an entire interval.
In the following table we compare the estimates from the linear approximation in
Example 2 with the true values. Notice from this table, and also from Figure 3, that the
tangent line approximation gives good estimates when x is close to 1 but the accuracy of
the approximation deteriorates when x is farther away from 1.
How good is the approximation that we obtained in Example 2? The next example
shows that by using a graphing calculator or computer we can determine an interval through-
out which a linear approximation provides a speciﬁed accuracy.
Accuracy of a linear approximation
For what values of is the linear 
approximation

Equivalently, we could write
This says that the linear approximation should lie between the curves obtained by shift-
ing the curve 
upward and downward by an amount 0.5. Figure 4 shows 
the tangent line 
intersecting the upper curve
at 
and . Zooming in and using the cursor, we estimate that the -coordinate of 
is about 
and the -coordinate of 
is about 8.66. Thus we see from the graph that the
approximation
is accurate to within 0.5 when 
. (We have rounded to be safe.)
Similarly, from Figure 5 we see that the approximation is accurate to within 0.1 when
.
Applications to Physics
Linear approximations are often used in physics. In analyzing the consequences of an
equation, a physicist sometimes needs to simplify a function by replacing it with its linear
approximation. For instance, in deriving a formula for the period of a pendulum, physics
textbooks obtain the expression 
for tangential acceleration and then replace
by
with the remark that 
is very close to if is not too large. [See, for exam-
ple, Physics: Calculus, 2d ed., by Eugene Hecht (Paciﬁc Grove, CA, 2000), p. 431.] You
can verify that the linearization of the function 
at a  0 is 
and so
the linear approximation at 0 is
(see Exercise 34). So, in effect, the derivation of the formula for the period of a pendulum
uses the tangent line approximation for the sine function.
Another example occurs in the theory of optics, where light rays that arrive at shal-
low angles relative to the optical axis are called paraxial rays. In paraxial (or Gaussian)
optics, both 
and 
are replaced by their linearizations. In other words, the linear 
approximations
and
are used because 
is close to 0. The results of calculations made with these approxi-
mations became the basic theoretical tool used to design lenses. [See Optics, 4th ed., by
Eugene Hecht (San Francisco, 2002), p. 154.]
In Section 8.8 we will present several other applications of the idea of linear approxi-
mations to physics.
Differentials
The ideas behind linear approximations are sometimes formulated in the terminology and
notation of differentials. If 
, where 
is a differentiable function, then the differ-
ential
is an independent variable; that is, 
can be given the value of any real number.
The differential
is then deﬁned in terms of

So 
is a dependent variable; it depends on the values of 
and 
. If 
is given a spe-
ciﬁc value and is taken to be some speciﬁc number in the domain of , then the numer-
ical value of 
is determined.
The geometric meaning of differentials is shown in Figure 6. Let 
and
be points on the graph of 
and let 
. The corresponding
change in is
The slope of the tangent line 
is the derivative 
. Thus the directed distance from S
to R is 
. Therefore 
represents the amount that the tangent line rises or falls
(the change in the linearization), whereas 
represents the amount that the curve 
rises or falls when changes by an amount 
. Notice from Figure 6 that the approxima-
tion 
becomes better as 
becomes smaller.
If we let 
, then 
and we can rewrite the linear approximation (1)
in the notation of differentials:
For instance, for the function 
in Example 2, we have
If a  1 and 
, then
and
just as we found in Example 2.
Our ﬁnal example illustrates the use of differentials in estimating the errors that occur
because of approximate measurements.
The radius of a sphere was measured and found to be 21 cm with a pos-
sible error in measurement of at most 0.05 cm. What is the maximum error in using this
value of the radius to compute the volume of the sphere?
SOLUTION If the radius of the sphere is , then its volume is 
. If the error in the
measured value of is denoted by 
, then the corresponding error in the calcu-
lated value of 
is 
, which can be approximated by the differential
When 
and 
, this becomes
The maximum error in the calculated volume is about 277 cm .
Note: Although the possible error in Example 4 may appear to be rather large, 
a better picture of the error is given by the relative error, which is computed by dividing

to widen it and restore the normal blood ﬂow.
Show that the relative change in

5. Instead of being satisﬁed with a linear or quadratic approximation to

try to ﬁnd better approximations with higher-degree polynomials. We look for an th-degree
polynomial
such that

as 
and its ﬁrst 
derivatives. By differentiating repeatedly and setting

Focus on Problem Solving
Before you look at the solution of the following example, cover it up and ﬁrst try to solve
the problem yourself. It might help to consult the principles of problem solving on page 83.
For what values of does the equation 
have exactly one solution?
SOLUTION One of the most important principles of problem solving is to draw a diagram,
even if the problem as stated doesn’t explicitly mention a geometric situation. Our present
problem can be reformulated geometrically as follows: For what values of does the
curve 
intersect the curve 
in exactly one point?
Let’s start by graphing 
and 
for various values of . We know that, for
, 
is a parabola that opens upward if 
and downward if 
. Figure
1 shows the parabolas 
for several positive values of . Most of them don’t inter-
sect 
at all and one intersects twice. We have the feeling that there must be a
value of (somewhere between 
and 
) for which the curves intersect exactly once,
as in Figure 2.
To ﬁnd that particular value of , we let be the -coordinate of the single point of
intersection. In other words, 
, so is the unique solution of the given equation.
We see from Figure 2 that the curves just touch, so they have a common tangent line
when 
. That means the curves 
and 
have the same slope when
. Therefore
Solving the equations 
and 
, we get
Thus 
and
For negative values of we have the situation illustrated in Figure 3: All parabolas
with negative values of intersect 
exactly once. And let’s not forget
about 
: The curve 
is just the -axis, which intersects 
exactly
once.
To summarize, the required values of are 
and

Applications of Differentiation
We have already investigated some of the applications of derivatives, but now
that we know the differentiation rules we are in a better position to pursue the
applications of differentiation in greater depth. We show how to analyze the
behavior of families of functions, how to solve related rates problems (how to
calculate rates that we can’t measure from those that we can), and how to ﬁnd
the maximum or minimum value of a quantity. In particular, we will be able to
investigate the optimal shape of a can and to explain the location of rainbows in
the sky.

CHAPTER 4
APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
If we are pumping air into a balloon, both the volume and the radius of the balloon are
increasing and their rates of increase are related to each other. But it is much easier to
measure directly the rate of increase of the volume than the rate of increase of the radius.
In a related rates problem the idea is to compute the rate of change of one quantity in
terms of the rate of change of another quantity (which may be more easily measured). The
procedure is to ﬁnd an equation that relates the two quantities and then use the Chain Rule
to differentiate both sides with respect to time.
Inflating a balloon
Air is being pumped into a spherical balloon so 
that its volume increases at a rate of 
. How fast is the radius of the balloon
increasing when the diameter is 50 cm?
SOLUTION We start by identifying two things:
the given information:
the rate of increase of the volume of air is 
and the unknown:
the rate of increase of the radius when the diameter is 50 cm
In order to express these quantities mathematically, we introduce some suggestive
notation:
Let V be the volume of the balloon and let r be its radius.
The key thing to remember is that rates of change are derivatives. In this problem, the
volume and the radius are both functions of the time . The rate of increase of the vol-
ume with respect to time is the derivative 
, and the rate of increase of the radius is
. We can therefore restate the given and the unknown as follows:
Given:
Unknown:
In order to connect 
and 
, we ﬁrst relate 
and by the formula for the
volume of a sphere:
In order to use the given information, we differentiate each side of this equation with
respect to . To differentiate the right side, we need to use the Chain Rule:
Now we solve for the unknown quantity:

ing the problem carefully, identifying the given

The radius of the balloon is increasing at the rate of 
cms.
The sliding ladder problem
A ladder 10 ft long rests against a vertical wall.
If the bottom of the ladder slides away from the wall at a rate of 
, how fast is the
top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 6 ft from the
wall? 
SOLUTION We ﬁrst draw a diagram and label it as in Figure 1. Let feet be the distance
from the bottom of the ladder to the wall and feet the distance from the top of the lad-
der to the ground. Note that and are both functions of (time, measured in seconds).
We are given that 
fts and we are asked to ﬁnd 
when

Figure 2). In this problem, the relationship between and is given by the Pythagorean
Theorem:
Differentiating each side with respect to using the Chain Rule, we have
and solving this equation for the desired rate, we obtain
When 
, the Pythagorean Theorem gives 
and so, substituting these values and
, we have
The fact that 
is negative means that the distance from the top of the ladder to
the ground is decreasing at a rate of
. In other words, the top of the ladder is sliding
down the wall at a rate of
.
Filling a tank
A water tank has the shape of an inverted circular cone with
base radius 2 m and height 4 m. If water is being pumped into the tank at a rate of 
2 m min, ﬁnd the rate at which the water level is rising when the water is 3 m deep.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst sketch the cone and label it as in Figure 3. Let , , and be the vol-
ume of the water, the radius of the surface, and the height of the water at time , where 
is measured in minutes.
We are given that 
m min and we are asked to ﬁnd 
when is 3 m.

The water level is rising at a rate of 
.
It is useful to recall some of the problem-solving 
principles from page 83 and adapt them to related rates in light of our experience in 
Examples 1–3:
1. Read the problem carefully.
2. Draw a diagram if possible.
3. Introduce notation. Assign symbols to all quantities that are functions of time.
4. Express the given information and the required rate in terms of derivatives.
5. Write an equation that relates the various quantities of the problem. If necessary,
use the geometry of the situation to eliminate one of the variables by substitution
(as in Example 3).
6. Use the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to .
7. Substitute the given information into the resulting equation and solve for the 
unknown rate.
The following examples are further illustrations of the strategy.
Car A is traveling west at 
and car B is traveling north at 
. Both are headed for the intersection of the two roads. At what rate are 
the cars approaching each other when car A is 0.3 mi and car B is 0.4 mi from the 
intersection?
SOLUTION We draw Figure 4, where 
is the intersection of the roads. At a given time 
let be the distance from car A to , let be the distance from car B to , and let be
the distance between the cars, where , , and are measured in miles.

37. A television camera is positioned 4000 ft from the base of a
rocket launching pad. The angle of elevation of the camera has
to change at the correct rate in order to keep the rocket in sight.
Also, the mechanism for focusing the camera has to take into
account the increasing distance from the camera to the rising
rocket. Let’s assume the rocket rises vertically and its speed is
600 fts when it has risen 3000 ft.
(a) How fast is the distance from the television camera to the
rocket changing at that moment?
(b) If the television camera is always kept aimed at the rocket,
how fast is the camera’s angle of elevation changing at that
same moment?

Some of the most important applications of differential calculus are optimization prob-
lems, in which we are required to ﬁnd the optimal (best) way of doing something. Here are
examples of such problems that we will solve in this chapter:
■What is the shape of a can that minimizes manufacturing costs?
■What is the maximum acceleration of a space shuttle? (This is an important 
question to the astronauts who have to withstand the effects of acceleration.)
■What is the radius of a contracted windpipe that expels air most rapidly during 
a cough?
■At what angle should blood vessels branch so as to minimize the energy expended
by the heart in pumping blood?
These problems can be reduced to ﬁnding the maximum or minimum values of a function.
Let’s ﬁrst explain exactly what we mean by maximum and minimum values.
We see that the highest point on the graph of the function shown in Figure 1 is the
point 
. In other words, the largest value of is 
. Likewise, the smallest value
is 
. We say that 
is the absolute maximum of and 
is the abso-
lute minimum. In general, we use the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition Let be a number in the domain 
of a function . Then 
is the
■absolute maximum value of on 
if 
for all in .
■absolute minimum value of on

An absolute maximum or minimum is sometimes called a global maximum or mini-
mum. The maximum and minimum values of are called extreme values of .
Figure 2 shows the graph of a function 
with absolute maximum at 
and absolute 
minimum at . Note that 
is the highest point on the graph and 
is the low-
est point. In Figure 2, if we consider only values of near [for instance, if we restrict our
attention to the interval 
], then 
is the largest of those values of 
and is called
a local maximum value of . Likewise, 
is called a local minimum value of 
because
for near [in the interval 
, for instance]. The function also has a local
minimum at . In general, we have the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition The number 
is a
■local maximum value of if 
when is near .
■local minimum value of if 
when is near .
In Deﬁnition 2 (and elsewhere), if we say that something is true near , we mean that
it is true on some open interval containing . For instance, in Figure 3 we see that 
is a local minimum because it’s the smallest value of
on the interval . It’s not the absolute
minimum because 
takes smaller values when 
is near 12 (in the interval 
, for
instance). In fact 
is both a local minimum and the absolute minimum. Simi-
larly, 
is a local maximum, but not the absolute maximum because takes larger
values near 1.
A function with infinitely many extreme values
The function 
takes on its (local and absolute) maximum value of 1 inﬁ-
nitely many times, since
for any integer
and
for all .
Likewise, 
is its minimum value, where is any integer.
A function with a minimum value but no maximum value
If 
, then 
because 
for all . Therefore 
is the
absolute (and local) minimum value of . This corresponds to the fact that the origin is
the lowest point on the parabola 
. (See Figure 4.) However, there is no highest
point on the parabola and so this function has no maximum value.
A function with no maximum or minimum
From the graph of the function
, shown in Figure 5, we see that this function has neither an absolute maximum
value nor an absolute minimum value. In fact, it has no local extreme values either.

is shown in Figure 6. You can see that 
is a local maximum, whereas the
absolute maximum is 
. (This absolute maximum is not a local maximum
because it occurs at an endpoint.) Also, 
is a local minimum and 
is
both a local and an absolute minimum. Note that
has neither a local nor an absolute
maximum at 
.
We have seen that some functions have extreme values, whereas others do not. The 
following theorem gives conditions under which a function is guaranteed to possess
extreme values.
The Extreme Value Theorem If 
is continuous on a closed interval 
, then 
attains an absolute maximum value 
and an absolute minimum value 
at
some numbers and 
in 
.
The Extreme Value Theorem is illustrated in Figure 7. Note that an extreme value can
be taken on more than once. Although the Extreme Value Theorem is intuitively very plau-
sible, it is difﬁcult to prove and so we omit the proof.
Figures 8 and 9 show that a function need not possess extreme values if either hypoth-
esis (continuity or closed interval) is omitted from the Extreme Value Theorem.
The function f whose graph is shown in Figure 8 is deﬁned on the closed interval [0, 2]
but has no maximum value. [Notice that the range of f is [0, 3). The function takes on val-
ues arbitrarily close to 3, but never actually attains the value 3.] This does not contradict
the Extreme Value Theorem because f is not continuous. [Nonetheless, a discontinuous
function could have maximum and minimum values. See Exercise 13(b).]
The function t shown in Figure 9 is continuous on the open interval (0, 2) but has nei-
ther a maximum nor a minimum value. [The range of t is 
. The function takes on
arbitrarily large values.] This does not contradict the Extreme Value Theorem because the
interval (0, 2) is not closed.

SECTION 4.2
MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM VALUES
265
The Extreme Value Theorem says that a continuous function on a closed interval has a
maximum value and a minimum value, but it does not tell us how to ﬁnd these extreme
values. We start by looking for local extreme values.
Figure 10 shows the graph of a function 
with a local maximum at 
and a local 
minimum at . It appears that at the maximum and minimum points the tangent lines are
horizontal and therefore each has slope 0. We know that the derivative is the slope of the
tangent line, so it appears that 
and 
. The following theorem says that
this is always true for differentiable functions.
Fermat’s Theorem If 
has a local maximum or minimum at , and if 
exists, then 
.
Our intuition suggests that Fermat’s Theorem is true. A rigorous proof, using the deﬁ-
nition of a derivative, is given in Appendix E.
Although Fermat’s Theorem is very useful, we have to guard against reading too much
into it. If 
, then 
, so 
. But 
has no maximum or minimum
at 0, as you can see from its graph in Figure 11. The fact that 
simply means that
the curve 
has a horizontal tangent at 
. Instead of having a maximum or min-
imum at 
, the curve crosses its horizontal tangent there.
|
Thus, when 
, 
doesn’t necessarily have a maximum or minimum at . (In
other words, the converse of Fermat’s Theorem is false in general.)
We should bear in mind that there may be an extreme value where 
does not exist.
For instance, the function 
has its (local and absolute) minimum value at 0 (see
Figure 12), but that value cannot be found by setting 
because, as was shown in
Example 6 in Section 2.7, 
does not exist.
Fermat’s Theorem does suggest that we should at least start looking for extreme values
of 
at the numbers 
where 
or where 
does not exist. Such numbers are
given a special name.

Fermat’s Theorem is named after Pierre Fermat
(1601–1665), a French lawyer who took up
mathematics as a hobby. Despite his amateur
status, Fermat was one of the two inventors of
analytic geometry (Descartes was the other).
His methods for ﬁnding tangents to curves and
maximum and minimum values (before the
invention of limits and derivatives) made him a
forerunner of Newton in the creation of differ-
ential calculus.

CHAPTER 4
APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
Deﬁnition A critical number of a function 
is a number in the domain of
such that either 
or 
does not exist.
Find the critical numbers of 
.
SOLUTION The Product Rule gives
[The same result could be obtained by ﬁrst writing 
.] Therefore
if 
, that is, 
, and 
does not exist when 
. Thus the
critical numbers are
and .
In terms of critical numbers, Fermat’s Theorem can be rephrased as follows (compare
Deﬁnition 5 with Theorem 4):
If f has a local maximum or minimum at c, then c is a critical number of f.
To ﬁnd an absolute maximum or minimum of a continuous function on a closed interval,
we note that either it is local [in which case it occurs at a critical number by (6)] or it occurs
at an endpoint of the interval. Thus the following three-step procedure always works.
The Closed Interval Method To ﬁnd the absolute maximum and minimum values of
a continuous function 
on a closed interval 
:
1. Find the values of 
at the critical numbers of 
in 
.
2. Find the values of 
at the endpoints of the interval.
3. The largest of the values from Steps 1 and 2 is the absolute maximum value; 
the smallest of these values is the absolute minimum value.
Finding extreme values on a closed interval
(a) Use a graphing device to estimate the absolute minimum and maximum values of
the function 
.
(b) Use calculus to ﬁnd the exact minimum and maximum values.
SOLUTION
(a) Figure 14 shows a graph of 
in the viewing rectangle 
by 
. By mov-
ing the cursor close to the maximum point, we see that the -coordinates don’t change
very much in the vicinity of the maximum. The absolute maximum value is about 6.97
and it occurs when 
. Similarly, by moving the cursor close to the minimum point,
we see that the absolute minimum value is about 
and it occurs when 
. It is
possible to get more accurate estimates by zooming in toward the maximum and mini-
mum points, but instead let’s use calculus.

The Hubble Space Telescope was deployed on April 24, 1990, by the space
shuttle Discovery. A model for the velocity of the shuttle during this mission, from liftoff
at 
until the solid rocket boosters were jettisoned at 
, is given by
(in feet per second). Using this model, estimate the absolute maximum and minimum
values of the acceleration of the shuttle between liftoff and the jettisoning of the boosters.
SOLUTION We are asked for the extreme values not of the given velocity function, but
rather of the acceleration function. So we ﬁrst need to differentiate to ﬁnd the acceleration:
We now apply the Closed Interval Method to the continuous function a on the interval
. Its derivative is
The only critical number occurs when 
:
Evaluating 
at the critical number and at the endpoints, we have
So the maximum acceleration is about

65. When a foreign object lodged in the trachea (windpipe)
forces a person to cough, the diaphragm thrusts upward caus-
ing an increase in pressure in the lungs. This is accompanied
by a contraction of the trachea, making a narrower channel
for the expelled air to ﬂow through. For a given amount of air
to escape in a ﬁxed time, it must move faster through the nar-
rower channel than the wider one. The greater the velocity of
the airstream, the greater the force on the foreign object.
X rays show that the radius of the circular tracheal tube con-
tracts to about two-thirds of its normal radius during a cough.
According to a mathematical model of coughing, the velocity
of the airstream is related to the radius of the trachea by

APPLIED PROJECT
The Calculus of Rainbows
Rainbows are created when raindrops scatter sunlight. They have fascinated mankind since
ancient times and have inspired attempts at scientiﬁc explanation since the time of Aristotle. In
this project we use the ideas of Descartes and Newton to explain the shape, location, and colors
of rainbows. 
1. The ﬁgure shows a ray of sunlight entering a spherical raindrop at . Some of the light is
reﬂected, but the line 
shows the path of the part that enters the drop. Notice that the light
is refracted toward the normal line 
and in fact Snell’s Law says that 
,
where 
is the angle of incidence, 
is the angle of refraction, and 
is the index of
refraction for water. At 
some of the light passes through the drop and is refracted into the
air, but the line 
shows the part that is reﬂected. (The angle of incidence equals the angle
of reﬂection.) When the ray reaches , part of it is reﬂected, but for the time being we are
more interested in the part that leaves the raindrop at . (Notice that it is refracted away
from the normal line.) The angle of deviation
is the amount of clockwise rotation that
the ray has undergone during this three-stage process. Thus
Show that the minimum value of the deviation is 
and occurs when 
.
The signiﬁcance of the minimum deviation is that when 
we have 
, so
. This means that many rays with 
become deviated by approximately
the same amount. It is the concentration of rays coming from near the direction of minimum
deviation that creates the brightness of the primary rainbow. The following ﬁgure shows 
that the angle of elevation from the observer up to the highest point on the rainbow is
. (This angle is called the rainbow angle.)

why they are true and using them, together with the differentiation formulas of Chapter 3,
to explain the shapes of graphs.
We start with a fact, known as the Mean Value Theorem, that will be useful not only for
present purposes but also for explaining why some of the other basic results of calculus are

2. Problem 1 explains the location of the primary rainbow, but how do we explain the colors?
Sunlight comprises a range of wavelengths, from the red range through orange, yellow,
green, blue, indigo, and violet. As Newton discovered in his prism experiments of 1666, the
index of refraction is different for each color. (The effect is called dispersion.) For red light
the refractive index is 
whereas for violet light it is 
. By repeating the
calculation of Problem 1 for these values of , show that the rainbow angle is about 
for
the red bow and 
for the violet bow. So the rainbow really consists of seven individual
bows corresponding to the seven colors.
3. Perhaps you have seen a fainter secondary rainbow above the primary bow. That results from
the part of a ray that enters a raindrop and is refracted at , reﬂected twice (at 
and ), and
refracted as it leaves the drop at 
(see the ﬁgure at the left). This time the deviation angle
is the total amount of counterclockwise rotation that the ray undergoes in this four-
stage process. Show that
and 
has a minimum value when
Taking 
, show that the minimum deviation is about 
and so the rainbow angle for
the secondary rainbow is about 
, as shown in the following ﬁgure.

primary rainbow.

CHAPTER 4
APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
The Mean Value Theorem If 
is a differentiable function on the interval 
, then
there exists a number between and such that
or, equivalently,
We can see that this theorem is reasonable by interpreting it geometrically. Figures 
1 and 2 show the points 
and 
on the graphs of two differentiable 
functions.
The slope of the secant line 
is
which is the same expression as on the right side of Equation 1. Since 
is the slope of
the tangent line at the point 
, the Mean Value Theorem, in the form given by Equa-
tion 1, says that there is at least one point 
on the graph where the slope of the
tangent line is the same as the slope of the secant line 
. In other words, there is a point
where the tangent line is parallel to the secant line 
. It seems clear that there is one
such point 
in Figure 1 and two such points 
and 
in Figure 2. Because our intuition
tells us that the Mean Value Theorem is true, we take it as the starting point for the devel-
opment of the main facts of calculus. (When calculus is developed from ﬁrst principles,
however, the Mean Value Theorem is proved as a consequence of the axioms that deﬁne
the real number system.)
What the Mean Value Theorem says about velocity
If an object moves in a
straight line with position function 
, then the average velocity between 
and
is
and the velocity at 
is 
. Thus the Mean Value Theorem (in the form of Equa-
tion 1) tells us that at some time 
between and the instantaneous velocity 
is equal to that average velocity. For instance, if a car traveled 180 km in 2 hours, then
the speedometer must have read 90 kmh at least once.

Lagrange and the 
Mean Value Theorem
The Mean Value Theorem was ﬁrst formulated
by Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736–1813), born in
Italy of a French father and an Italian mother.
He was a child prodigy and became a profes-
sor in Turin at the age of 19. Lagrange made
great contributions to number theory, theory of
functions, theory of equations, and analytical
and celestial mechanics. In particular, he
applied calculus to the analysis of the stability
of the solar system. At the invitation of Freder-
ick the Great, he succeeded Euler at the Berlin 
Academy and, when Frederick died, Lagrange
accepted King Louis XVI’s invitation to Paris,
where he was given apartments in the Louvre
and became a professor at the Ecole Polytech-
nique. He was a kind and quiet man, living only
for science.

SECTION 4.3
DERIVATIVES AND THE SHAPES OF CURVES
273
The main signiﬁcance of the Mean Value Theorem is that it enables us to obtain infor-
mation about a function from information about its derivative. Our immediate use of this
principle is to prove the basic facts concerning increasing and decreasing functions. (See
Exercises 63 and 64 for another use.)
Increasing and Decreasing Functions
In Section 1.1 we deﬁned increasing functions and decreasing functions and in Section 2.8
we observed from graphs that a function with a positive derivative is increasing. We now
deduce this fact from the Mean Value Theorem.
Increasing/Decreasing Test
(a) If 
on an interval, then 
is increasing on that interval.
(b) If 
on an interval, then 
is decreasing on that interval.
PROOF
(a) Let 
and 
be any two numbers in the interval with 
. According to the deﬁ-
nition of an increasing function (page 21) we have to show that 
.
Because we are given that 
, we know that
is differentiable on 
. So,
by the Mean Value Theorem, there is a number c between 
and 
such that
Now 
by assumption and 
because 
. Thus the right side of
Equation 3 is positive, and so
This shows that 
is increasing.
Part (b) is proved similarly.
Find where the function 
is increasing
and where it is decreasing.
SOLUTION
To use the ID Test we have to know where 
and where 
. This
depends on the signs of the three factors of 
, namely, 
, 
, and 
. We
divide the real line into intervals whose endpoints are the critical numbers 
, and 
and arrange our work in a chart. A plus sign indicates that the given expression is posi-
tive, and a minus sign indicates that it is negative. The last column of the chart gives 
the conclusion based on the ID Test. For instance, 
for 
, so 
is
decreasing on (0, 2). (It would also be true to say that
is decreasing on the closed inter-
val
.)
The graph of 
shown in Figure 3 conﬁrms the information in the chart.

CHAPTER 4
APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
Recall from Section 4.2 that if 
has a local maximum or minimum at , then must be
a critical number of 
(by Fermat’s Theorem), but not every critical number gives rise to a
maximum or a minimum. We therefore need a test that will tell us whether or not 
has a
local maximum or minimum at a critical number.
You can see from Figure 3 that 
is a local maximum value of 
because 
increases on 
and decreases on 
. Or, in terms of derivatives, 
for
and 
for 
. In other words, the sign of 
changes from
positive to negative at . This observation is the basis of the following test.
The First Derivative Test Suppose that is a critical number of a continuous 
function .
(a) If 
changes from positive to negative at , then 
has a local maximum at .
(b) If 
changes from negative to positive at , then 
has a local minimum at .
(c) If 
does not change sign at (for example, if 
is positive on both sides of c
or negative on both sides), then 
has no local maximum or minimum at .
The First Derivative Test is a consequence of the ID Test. In part (a), for instance, since
the sign of 
changes from positive to negative at c, f is increasing to the left of c and
decreasing to the right of c. It follows that f has a local maximum at c.
It is easy to remember the First Derivative Test by visualizing diagrams such as those
in Figure 4.
Find the local minimum and maximum values of the function 
in
Example 2.
SOLUTION From the chart in the solution to Example 2 we see that 
changes from
negative to positive at 1, so 
is a local minimum value by the First Deriva-
tive Test. Similarly, 
changes from negative to positive at 2, so 
is also a
local minimum value. As previously noted, 
is a local maximum value because
changes from positive to negative at 0.
Concavity
Let’s recall the deﬁnition of concavity from Section 2.8.
A function (or its graph) is called concave upward on an interval if 
is an
increasing function on . It is called concave downward on if 
is decreasing 
on .I

SECTION 4.3
DERIVATIVES AND THE SHAPES OF CURVES

Notice in Figure 5 that the slopes of the tangent lines increase from left to right on the
interval 
, so 
is increasing and 
is concave upward (abbreviated CU) on 
. 
[It can be proved that this is equivalent to saying that the graph of 
lies above all of its
tangent lines on 
.] Similarly, the slopes of the tangent lines decrease from left to right
on 
, so 
is decreasing and 
is concave downward (CD) on 
.
A point where a curve changes its direction of concavity is called an inﬂection point.
The curve in Figure 5 changes from concave upward to concave downward at 
and from
concave downward to concave upward at , so both 
and 
are inﬂection points.
Because 
, we know that if 
is positive, then 
is an increasing function
and so 
is concave upward. Similarly, if 
is negative, then 
is decreasing and 
is
concave downward. Thus we have the following test for concavity.
Concavity Test
(a) If 
for all in , then the graph of 
is concave upward on .
(b) If 
for all in , then the graph of 
is concave downward on .
In view of the Concavity Test, there is a point of inﬂection at any point where the sec-
ond derivative changes sign. A consequence of the Concavity Test is the following test for
maximum and minimum values.
The Second Derivative Test Suppose 
is continuous near .
(a) If 
and 
, then 
has a local minimum at .
(b) If 
and 
, then 
has a local maximum at .
For instance, part (a) is true because 
near c and so
is concave upward 
near . This means that the graph of
lies above its horizontal tangent at c and so
has 
a local minimum at . (See Figure 6.)
Analyzing a curve using derivatives

with
respect to concavity, points of inﬂection, and local maxima and minima. Use this infor-
mation to sketch the curve.

CHAPTER 4
APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
To ﬁnd the critical numbers we set 
and obtain 
and 
. To use the
Second Derivative Test we evaluate 
at these critical numbers:
Since 
and 
, 
is a local minimum. Since 
, the
Second Derivative Test gives no information about the critical number 0. But since
for 
and also for 
, the First Derivative Test tells us that 
does
not have a local maximum or minimum at 0. 
Since 
when 
or , we divide the real line into intervals with these
numbers as endpoints and complete the following chart.
The point 
is an inﬂection point since the curve changes from concave upward to
concave downward there. Also 
is an inﬂection point since the curve changes
from concave downward to concave upward there.
Using the local minimum, the intervals of concavity, and the inﬂection points, we
sketch the curve in Figure 7.
Note: The Second Derivative Test is inconclusive when 
. In other words, at
such a point there might be a maximum, there might be a minimum, or there might be nei-
ther (as in Example 4). This test also fails when 
does not exist. In such cases the First
Derivative Test must be used. In fact, even when both tests apply, the First Derivative Test
is often the easier one to use.
Sketch the graph of the function 
.
SOLUTION Calculation of the ﬁrst two derivatives gives 
Since 
when 
and 
does not exist when 
or 
, the critical
numbers are 
, and .
To ﬁnd the local extreme values we use the First Derivative Test. Since 
changes
from negative to positive at 0, 
is a local minimum. Since 
changes from
positive to negative at 4, 
is a local maximum. The sign of 
does not change
at 6, so there is no minimum or maximum there. (The Second Derivative Test could be
used at 4 but not at 0 or 6 since 
does not exist at either of these numbers.)

ward on

Use the ﬁrst and second derivatives of

totes, to sketch its graph.
SOLUTION Notice that the domain of

by computing the left and right limits as 
. As

and this shows that

As 
, we have

This shows that 
is a horizontal asymptote.
Now let’s compute the derivative. The Chain Rule gives
Since

local maximum or minimum. The second derivative is
Since

CHAPTER 4
APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
To sketch the graph of 
we ﬁrst draw the horizontal asymptote 
(as a dashed
line), together with the parts of the curve near the asymptotes in a preliminary sketch
[Figure 9(a)]. These parts reﬂect the information concerning limits and the fact that 
is
decreasing on both 
and 
. Notice that we have indicated that 
as

does not exist. In Figure 9(b) we ﬁnish the sketch by incorpo-
rating the information concerning concavity and the inﬂection point. In Figure 9(c) we
check our work with a graphing device.
When does a bee population grow fastest?
A population of honeybees raised
in an apiary started with 50 bees at time 
and was modeled by the function
where is the time in weeks, 
. Use a graph to estimate the time at which 
the bee population was growing fastest. Then use derivatives to give a more accurate
estimate.
SOLUTION The population grows fastest when the population curve 
has the
steepest tangent line. From the graph of 
in Figure 10, we estimate that the steepest
tangent occurs when 
, so the bee population was growing most rapidly after about
12 weeks.
For a better estimate we calculate the derivative 
, which is the rate of increase of
the bee population:
We graph 
in Figure 11 and observe that 
has its maximum value when 
.
To get a still better estimate we note that 
has its maximum value when 
changes
from increasing to decreasing. This happens when 
changes from concave upward to
concave downward, that is, when 
has an inﬂection point. So we ask a CAS to compute
the second derivative:
We could plot this function to see where it changes from positive to negative, but instead
let’s have the CAS solve the equation 
. It gives the answer 
.

Our ﬁnal example is concerned with families of functions. This means that the functions
in the family are related to each other by a formula that contains one or more arbitrary con-
stants. Each value of the constant gives rise to a member of the family and the idea is to
see how the graph of the function changes as the constant changes.
Investigate the family of functions given by 
. What fea-
tures do the members of this family have in common? How do they differ?
SOLUTION The derivative is 
. If 
, then 
for all (since
), so 
is always increasing. If 
, then 
when is an odd mul-
tiple of , but 
just has horizontal tangents there and is still an increasing function.
Similarly, if 
, then 
is always decreasing. If 
, then the equation
has inﬁnitely many solutions 
and 
has inﬁnitely
many minima and maxima.
The second derivative is 
, which is negative when 
and, in
general, when 
, where 
is any integer. Thus all members of the
family are concave downward on 
, 
and concave upward on 
,
. This is illustrated by several members of the family in Figure 12.

CHAPTER 4
APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
The method we used to sketch curves in the preceding section was a culmination of much
of our study of differential calculus. The graph was the ﬁnal object that we produced. In
this section our point of view is completely different. Here we start with a graph produced
by a graphing calculator or computer and then we reﬁne it. We use calculus to make sure
that we reveal all the important aspects of the curve. And with the use of graphing devices
we can tackle curves that would be far too complicated to consider without technology.
The theme is the interaction between calculus and calculators.
Discovering hidden behavior
Graph the polynomial 
. Use the graphs of 
and 
to
estimate all maximum and minimum points and intervals of concavity.
SOLUTION If we specify a domain but not a range, many graphing devices will deduce a
suitable range from the values computed. Figure 1 shows the plot from one such device
if we specify that 
. Although this viewing rectangle is useful for showing
that the asymptotic behavior (or end behavior) is the same as for 
, it is obviously
hiding some ﬁner detail. So we change to the viewing rectangle 
by 
shown in Figure 2.

From this graph it appears that there is an absolute minimum value of about 
3
when 
(by using the cursor) and 
is decreasing on 
and increas-
ing on 
. Also there appears to be a horizontal tangent at the origin and inﬂec-
tion points when 
and when is somewhere between 
and 
.
Now let’s try to conﬁrm these impressions using calculus. We differentiate and get 
When we graph 
in Figure 3 we see that 
changes from negative to positive when
; this conﬁrms (by the First Derivative Test) the minimum value that we
found earlier. But, perhaps to our surprise, we also notice that 
changes from posi-
tive to negative when 
and from negative to positive when 
. This means
that 
has a local maximum at 0 and a local minimum when 
, but these were
hidden in Figure 2. Indeed, if we now zoom in toward the origin in Figure 4, we see
what we missed before: a local maximum value of 0 when 
and a local minimum
value of about 
when 
.
What about concavity and inﬂection points? From Figures 2 and 4 there appear to 
be inﬂection points when is a little to the left of 
and when is a little to the right
of 0. But it’s difﬁcult to determine inﬂection points from the graph of , so we graph the
second derivative 
in Figure 5. We see that 
changes from positive to negative when
and from negative to positive when 
. So, correct to two decimal
places, 
is concave upward on 
and 
and concave downward on
. The inﬂection points are 
and 
.
We have discovered that no single graph reveals all the important features of this
polynomial. But Figures 2 and 4, when taken together, do provide an accurate picture.

CHAPTER 4
APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
Draw the graph of the function
in a viewing rectangle that contains all the important features of the function. Estimate
the maximum and minimum values and the intervals of concavity. Then use calculus to
ﬁnd these quantities exactly.
SOLUTION Figure 6, produced by a computer with automatic scaling, is a disaster. Some
graphing calculators use 
by 
as the default viewing rectangle, so let’s
try it. We get the graph shown in Figure 7; it’s a major improvement.
The -axis appears to be a vertical asymptote and indeed it is because 
Figure 7 also allows us to estimate the -intercepts: about 
and 
. The exact val-
ues are obtained by using the quadratic formula to solve the equation
;
we get 
.
To get a better look at horizontal asymptotes, we change to the viewing rectangle
by 
in Figure 8. It appears that 
is the horizontal asymptote and
this is easily conﬁrmed:
To estimate the minimum value we zoom in to the viewing rectangle 
by
in Figure 9. The cursor indicates that the absolute minimum value is about 
when 
, and we see that the function decreases on 
and 
and
increases on 
. The exact values are obtained by differentiating:
This shows that 
when 
and 
when 
and when
. The exact minimum value is 
.
Figure 9 also shows that an inﬂection point occurs somewhere between 
and
. We could estimate it much more accurately using the graph of the second deriv-
ative, but in this case it’s just as easy to ﬁnd exact values. Since

we see that

is concave upward on 
and 
and concave downward on 
. The inﬂection point is 
.
The analysis using the ﬁrst two derivatives shows that Figure 8 displays all the major
aspects of the curve.
One graph isn’t always enough
Graph the function 
.
SOLUTION Drawing on our experience with a rational function in Example 2, let’s start
by graphing 
in the viewing rectangle 
by 
. From Figure 10 we have
the feeling that we are going to have to zoom in to see some ﬁner detail and also zoom
out to see the larger picture. But, as a guide to intelligent zooming, let’s ﬁrst take a close
look at the expression for 
. Because of the factors 
and 
in the
denominator, we expect 
and 
to be the vertical asymptotes. Indeed
To ﬁnd the horizontal asymptotes, we divide numerator and denominator by 
:
This shows that 
, so the -axis is a horizontal asymptote.
It is also very useful to consider the behavior of the graph near the -intercepts. Since
is positive, 
does not change sign at 0 and so its graph doesn’t cross the -axis at
0. But, because of the factor 
, the graph does cross the -axis at 
and has a
horizontal tangent there. Putting all this information together, but without using deriva-
tives, we see that the curve has to look something like the one in Figure 11.
Now that we know what to look for, we zoom in (several times) to produce the graphs
in Figures 12 and 13 and zoom out (several times) to get Figure 14.
We can read from these graphs that the absolute minimum is about 
and occurs
when 
. There is also a local maximum
when 
and a local
minimum
when 
. These graphs also show three inﬂection points near 
and 
and two between 
and . To estimate the inﬂection points closely we
would need to graph 
, but to compute 
by hand is an unreasonable chore. If you
have a computer algebra system, then it’s easy to do (see Exercise 13).

CHAPTER 4
APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
We have seen that, for this particular function, three graphs (Figures 12, 13, and 14)
are necessary to convey all the useful information. The only way to display all these
features of the function on a single graph is to draw it by hand. Despite the exaggera-
tions and distortions, Figure 11 does manage to summarize the essential nature of the
function.
Graph the function 
. For 
, estimate all
maximum and minimum values, intervals of increase and decrease, and inﬂection points.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst note that 
is periodic with period 
. Also, 
is odd and 
for all . So the choice of a viewing rectangle is not a problem for this function: We start
with 
by 
. (See Figure 15.) It appears that there are three local maxi-
mum values and two local minimum values in that window. To conﬁrm this and locate
them more accurately, we calculate that
and graph both 
and 
in Figure 16. Using zoom-in and the First Derivative Test, we
ﬁnd the following approximate values.
The second derivative is
Graphing both 
and 
in Figure 17, we obtain the following approximate values:
Having checked that Figure 15 does indeed represent 
accurately for 
, 
we can state that the extended graph in Figure 18 represents 
accurately for
.

SOLUTION The graphs in Figures 19 and 20 (the special cases 
and 
) show
two very different-looking curves. Before drawing any more graphs, let’s see what mem-
bers of this family have in common. Since
for any value of , they all have the -axis as a horizontal asymptote. A vertical asymp-
tote will occur when 
. Solving this quadratic equation, we get
. When 
, there is no vertical asymptote (as in Figure 19). 
When 
, the graph has a single vertical asymptote 
because
When 
, there are two vertical asymptotes: 
(as in Figure 20).
Now we compute the derivative:
This shows that 
when 
(if 
), 
when 
, and
when 
. For 
, this means that 
increases on 
and decreases on 
. For 
, there is an absolute maximum value
. For 
, 
is a local maximum value and the
intervals of increase and decrease are interrupted at the vertical asymptotes.
Figure 21 is a “slide show” displaying ﬁve members of the family, all graphed in the
viewing rectangle 
by 
. As predicted, 
is the value at which a transi-
tion takes place from two vertical asymptotes to one, and then to none. As increases
from , we see that the maximum point becomes lower; this is explained by the fact that
as 
. As decreases from , the vertical asymptotes become more
widely separated because the distance between them is 
, which becomes large
as 
. Again, the maximum point approaches the -axis because 
as 
.
There is clearly no inﬂection point when 
. For 
we calculate that
and deduce that inﬂection points occur when 
. So the inﬂection
points become more spread out as increases and this seems plausible from the last two
parts of Figure 21.

CHAPTER 4
APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
In Section 1.7 we used graphing devices to graph parametric curves and in Section 3.4
we found tangents to parametric curves. But, as our ﬁnal example shows, we are now in a
position to use calculus to ensure that a parameter interval or a viewing rectangle will
reveal all the important aspects of a curve.
Graph the curve with parametric equations
in a viewing rectangle that displays the important features of the curve. Find the coordi-
nates of the interesting points on the curve.
SOLUTION Figure 22 shows the graph of this curve in the viewing rectangle 
by
. Zooming in toward the point 
where the curve intersects itself, we estimate
that the coordinates of 
are 
. We estimate that the highest point on the loop
has coordinates 
, the lowest point 
, and the leftmost point 
. To
be sure that we have discovered all the interesting aspects of the curve, however, we
need to use calculus. From Equation 3.4.7, we have
The vertical tangent occurs when 
, that is, 
. So the exact
coordinates of the leftmost point of the loop are 
and 
.
Also,
and so horizontal tangents occur when 
. The bottom of the loop corre-
sponds to 
and, indeed, its coordinates are 
and 
. Simi-
larly, the coordinates of the top of the loop are exactly what we estimated: 
and
. But what about the parameter value 
? The corresponding point on the
curve has coordinates 
. Figure 23 shows the graph of the
curve in the viewing rectangle 
. This shows that the point 
is the lowest point on the curve. We can now be conﬁdent that there are no hidden maxi-

CHAPTER 4
APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
Suppose we are trying to analyze the behavior of the function
Although 
is not deﬁned when 
, we need to know how 
behaves near 1. In partic-
ular, we would like to know the value of the limit
In computing this limit we can’t apply Law 5 of limits (the limit of a quotient is the quo-
tient of the limits, see Section 2.3) because the limit of the denominator is 0. In fact,
although the limit in (1) exists, its value is not obvious because both numerator and denom-
inator approach and is not deﬁned.
In general, if we have a limit of the form
where both 
and 
as 
, then this limit may or may not exist and is
called an indeterminate form of type . We met some limits of this type in Chapter 2. For
rational functions, we can cancel common factors:
We used a geometric argument to show that
But these methods do not work for limits such as (1), so in this section we introduce a sys-
tematic method, known as l’Hospital’s Rule, for the evaluation of indeterminate forms.
Another situation in which a limit is not obvious occurs when we look for a horizontal
asymptote of F and need to evaluate the limit
It isn’t obvious how to evaluate this limit because both numerator and denominator become
large as 
. There is a struggle between numerator and denominator. If the numerator
wins, the limit will be ; if the denominator wins, the answer will be 0. Or there may be
some compromise, in which case the answer will be some ﬁnite positive number.
In general, if we have a limit of the form
where both 
(or 
) and 
(or 
), then the limit may or may not exist
and is called an indeterminate form of type
. We saw in Section 2.5 that this type 
of limit can be evaluated for certain functions, including rational functions, by dividing

instance,
This method does not work for limits such as (2), but l’Hospital’s Rule also applies to this
type of indeterminate form.
L’Hospital’s Rule Suppose

possibly at ). Suppose that

and
(In other words, we have an indeterminate form of type or 
.) Then
if the limit on the right side exists (or is 
or 
).
Note 1: L’Hospital’s Rule says that the limit of a quotient of functions is equal to the
limit of the quotient of their derivatives, provided that the given conditions are satisﬁed. It
is especially important to verify the conditions regarding the limits of and before using
l’Hospital’s Rule.
Note 2: L’Hospital’s Rule is also valid for one-sided limits and for limits at inﬁnity or
negative inﬁnity; that is, “
” can be replaced by any of the symbols 
,
, or 
.
Note 3: For the special case in which 
, 
and 
are continuous, and
, it is easy to see why l’Hospital’s Rule is true. In fact, using the alternative form
of the deﬁnition of a derivative, we have
The general version of l’Hospital’s Rule is more difﬁcult; its proof can be found in more
advanced books.

L’Hospital
L’Hospital’s Rule is named after a French noble-
man, the Marquis de l’Hospital (1661–1704),
but was discovered by a Swiss mathematician,
John Bernoulli (1667–1748). You might some-
times see l’Hospital spelled as l’Hôpital, but he
spelled his own name l’Hospital, as was com-
mon in the 17th century. See Exercise 69 for
the example that the Marquis used to illustrate
his rule. See the project on page 299 for fur-
ther historical details.

SOLUTION Noting that both

Since the limit on the right side is still indeterminate of type , we apply l’Hospital’s

Because

We can evaluate this last limit either by using l’Hospital’s Rule a third time or by
writing 
as 
and making use of our knowledge of trigonometric limits.
Putting together all the steps, we get

SOLUTION If we blindly attempted to use l’Hospital’s Rule, we would get
|
This is wrong! Although the numerator 
as 
, notice that the denomi-
nator 
does not approach , so l’Hospital’s Rule can’t be applied here.
The required limit is, in fact, easy to ﬁnd because the function is continuous at 
and
the denominator is nonzero there:
Example 5 shows what can go wrong if you use l’Hospital’s Rule without thinking.
Other limits can be found using l’Hospital’s Rule but are more easily found by other meth-
ods. (See Examples 3 and 5 in Section 2.3, Example 5 in Section 2.5, and the discussion
at the beginning of this section.) So when evaluating any limit, you should consider other
methods before using l’Hospital’s Rule.

APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
Indeterminate Products
If 
and 
(or 
), then it isn’t clear what the value of
, if any, will be. There is a struggle between and . If wins, the limit will
be ; if 
wins, the answer will be 
(or 
). Or there may be a compromise where the
answer is a ﬁnite nonzero number. This kind of limit is called an indeterminate form of
type 
. We can deal with it by writing the product 
as a quotient:
or
This converts the given limit into an indeterminate form of type or 
so that we can
use l’Hospital’s Rule.
Evaluate 
. Use the knowledge of this limit, together with
information from derivatives, to sketch the curve 
.
SOLUTION The given limit is indeterminate because, as 
, the ﬁrst factor 
approaches 0 while the second factor 
approaches 
. Writing 
, we
have 
as 
, so l’Hospital’s Rule gives
If 
, then
so 
when 
, which means that 
. In fact, 
when
and 
when 
, so 
is increasing on 
and decreasing on
. Thus, by the First Derivative Test, 
is a local (and absolute)
minimum. Also, 
, so 
is concave upward on 
. We use this infor-
mation, together with the crucial knowledge that 
, to sketch the curve
in Figure 5.
Note: In solving Example 6 another possible option would have been to write
This gives an indeterminate form of the type 
, but if we apply l’Hospital’s Rule we get
a more complicated expression than the one we started with. In general, when we rewrite
an indeterminate product, we try to choose the option that leads to the simpler limit.
Indeterminate Differences
If 
and 
, then the limit
is called an indeterminate form of type
. Again there is a contest between 
and
. Will the answer be 
(
wins) or will it be 
( wins) or will they compromise on a
ﬁnite number? To ﬁnd out, we try to convert the difference into a quotient (for instance,
by using a common denominator, or rationalization, or factoring out a common factor) so
that we have an indeterminate form of type or 
.

WRITING PROJECT
The Origins of l’Hospital’s Rule
L’Hospital’s Rule was ﬁrst published in 1696 in the Marquis de l’Hospital’s calculus textbook
Analyse des Inﬁniment Petits, but the rule was discovered in 1694 by the Swiss mathematician
John (Johann) Bernoulli. The explanation is that these two mathematicians had entered into a
curious business arrangement whereby the Marquis de l’Hospital bought the rights to Bernoulli’s
mathematical discoveries. The details, including a translation of l’Hospital’s letter to Bernoulli
proposing the arrangement, can be found in the book by Eves [1].
Write a report on the historical and mathematical origins of l’Hospital’s Rule. Start by pro-
viding brief biographical details of both men (the dictionary edited by Gillispie [2] is a good
source) and outline the business deal between them. Then give l’Hospital’s statement of his rule,
which is found in Struik’s sourcebook [4] and more brieﬂy in the book of Katz [3]. Notice that
l’Hospital and Bernoulli formulated the rule geometrically and gave the answer in terms of
differentials. Compare their statement with the version of l’Hospital’s Rule given in Section 4.5
and show that the two statements are essentially the same.

The methods we have learned in this chapter for ﬁnding extreme values have practical
applications in many areas of life. A businessperson wants to minimize costs and maxi-
mize proﬁts. A traveler wants to minimize transportation time. Fermat’s Principle in optics
states that light follows the path that takes the least time. In this section and the next we
solve such problems as maximizing areas, volumes, and proﬁts and minimizing distances,
times, and costs.
In solving such practical problems the greatest challenge is often to convert the word
problem into a mathematical optimization problem by setting up the function that is to be
maximized or minimized. Let’s recall the problem-solving principles discussed on page 83
and adapt them to this situation:
1. Understand the Problem The ﬁrst step is to read the problem carefully until it is
clearly understood. Ask yourself: What is the unknown? What are the given
quantities? What are the given conditions?
2. Draw a Diagram In most problems it is useful to draw a diagram and identify
the given and required quantities on the diagram.
3. Introduce Notation Assign a symbol to the quantity that is to be maximized or
minimized (let’s call it 
for now). Also select symbols 
for
other unknown quantities and label the diagram with these symbols. It may help
to use initials as suggestive symbols—for example, 
for area, for height, for
time.

4. Express 
in terms of some of the other symbols from Step 3.
5. If 
has been expressed as a function of more than one variable in Step 4, use
the given information to ﬁnd relationships (in the form of equations) among
these variables. Then use these equations to eliminate all but one of the variables
in the expression for . Thus 
will be expressed as a function of one variable ,
say, 
. Write the domain of this function.
6. Use the methods of Sections 4.2 and 4.3 to ﬁnd the absolute maximum or mini-
mum value of . In particular, if the domain of 
is a closed interval, then the
Closed Interval Method in Section 4.2 can be used.
Maximizing area
A farmer has 2400 ft of fencing and wants to fence off a
rectangular ﬁeld that borders a straight river. He needs no fence along the river. What are
the dimensions of the ﬁeld that has the largest area?
SOLUTION In order to get a feeling for what is happening in this problem, let’s experi-
ment with some special cases. Figure 1 (not to scale) shows three possible ways of 
laying out the 2400 ft of fencing.
We see that when we try shallow, wide ﬁelds or deep, narrow ﬁelds, we get relatively
small areas. It seems plausible that there is some intermediate conﬁguration that pro-
duces the largest area.
Figure 2 illustrates the general case. We wish to maximize the area 
of the rectangle.
Let and be the depth and width of the rectangle (in feet). Then we express 
in terms
of and :
We want to express 
as a function of just one variable, so we eliminate by expressing
it in terms of . To do this we use the given information that the total length of the fenc-
ing is 2400 ft. Thus 
From this equation we have 
, which gives

The derivative is 
, so to ﬁnd the critical numbers we solve the 
equation
which gives 
. The maximum value of 
must occur either at this critical number
or at an endpoint of the interval. Since 
, and 
,
the Closed Interval Method gives the maximum value as 
.
[Alternatively, we could have observed that 
for all , so 
is always
concave downward and the local maximum at 
must be an absolute maximum.]
Thus the rectangular ﬁeld should be 600 ft deep and 1200 ft wide.
Minimizing cost
A cylindrical can is to be made to hold 1 L of oil. Find
the dimensions that will minimize the cost of the metal to manufacture the can.
SOLUTION Draw the diagram as in Figure 3, where is the radius and the height (both
in centimeters). In order to minimize the cost of the metal, we minimize the total surface
area of the cylinder (top, bottom, and sides). From Figure 4 we see that the sides are
made from a rectangular sheet with dimensions 
and h. So the surface area is
To eliminate we use the fact that the volume is given as 1 L, which we take to be
1000 cm . Thus
which gives 
. Substitution of this into the expression for 
gives
Therefore the function that we want to minimize is
To ﬁnd the critical numbers, we differentiate:
Then 
when 
, so the only critical number is 
.
Since the domain of 
is 
, we can’t use the argument of Example 1 concerning
endpoints. But we can observe that 
for 
and 
for
, so 
is decreasing for all
to the left of the critical number and increas-
ing for all
to the right. Thus 
must give rise to an absolute minimum.
[Alternatively, we could argue that 
as 
and 
as 
, so
there must be a minimum value of 
, which must occur at the critical number. See
Figure 5.]
The value of corresponding to 
is
Thus, to minimize the cost of the can, the radius should be 
cm and the height
should be equal to twice the radius, namely, the diameter.

In the Applied Project on page 311 we investi-
gate the most economical shape for a can by 
taking into account other manufacturing costs.

Note 1: The argument used in Example 2 to justify the absolute minimum is a variant
of the First Derivative Test (which applies only to local maximum or minimum values) and
is stated here for future reference.
First Derivative Test for Absolute Extreme Values Suppose that is a critical number of
a continuous function 
deﬁned on an interval.
(a) If 
for all 
and 
for all 
, then 
is the absolute
maximum value of .
(b) If 
for all 
and 
for all 
, then 
is the absolute
minimum value of .
Note 2: An alternative method for solving optimization problems is to use implicit dif-
ferentiation. Let’s look at Example 2 again to illustrate the method. We work with the same
equations
but instead of eliminating h, we differentiate both equations implicitly with respect to r:
The minimum occurs at a critical number, so we set 
, simplify, and arrive at the
equations
and subtraction gives 
, or 
.
Find the point on the parabola 
that is closest to the point 
.
SOLUTION The distance between the point 
and the point 
is
(See Figure 6.) But if 
lies on the parabola, then 
, so the expression for 
becomes
(Alternatively, we could have substituted 
to get 
in terms of alone.) Instead
of minimizing , we minimize its square:
(You should convince yourself that the minimum of 
occurs at the same point as the
minimum of 
, but 
is easier to work with.) Differentiating, we obtain
so 
when 
. Observe that 
when 
and 
when
, so by the First Derivative Test for Absolute Extreme Values, the absolute mini-
mum occurs when 
. (Or we could simply say that because of the geometric nature
of the problem, it’s obvious that there is a closest point but not a farthest point.) The
corresponding value of is 
. Thus the point on 
closest to 
is

Minimizing time
A man launches his boat from point 
on a bank of a
straight river, 3 km wide, and wants to reach point , 8 km downstream on the opposite
bank, as quickly as possible (see Figure 7). He could row his boat directly across the
river to point 
and then run to , or he could row directly to , or he could row to some
point 
between 
and 
and then run to . If he can row 6 kmh and run 8 kmh,
where should he land to reach 
as soon as possible? (We assume that the speed of the
water is negligible compared with the speed at which the man rows.)
SOLUTION If we let be the distance from 
to , then the running distance is
and the Pythagorean Theorem gives the rowing distance as
. We use the equation
Then the rowing time is 
and the running time is 
, so the total time
as a function of is
The domain of this function 
is 
. Notice that if 
, he rows to 
and if 
,
he rows directly to . The derivative of 
is
Thus, using the fact that 
, we have
The only critical number is 
. To see whether the minimum occurs at this criti-
cal number or at an endpoint of the domain 
, we evaluate 
at all three points:
Since the smallest of these values of 
occurs when 
, the absolute minimum
value of 
must occur there. Figure 8 illustrates this calculation by showing the graph 
of .
Thus the man should land the boat at a point 
km (
km) downstream from
his starting point.
Find the area of the largest rectangle that can be inscribed in a semi-
circle of radius .
SOLUTION 1 Let’s take the semicircle to be the upper half of the circle 
with
center the origin. Then the word inscribed means that the rectangle has two vertices on
the semicircle and two vertices on the -axis as shown in Figure 9.

Let

The domain of this function is

and it occurs when 
.
Notice that this trigonometric solution doesn’t involve differentiation. In fact, we 
didn’t need to use calculus at all.
Applications to Business and Economics
In Section 3.8 we introduced the idea of marginal cost. Recall that if 
, the cost func-
tion, is the cost of producing units of a certain product, then the marginal cost is the rate
of change of 
with respect to . In other words, the marginal cost function is the deriva-
tive, 
, of the cost function.
Now let’s consider marketing. Let 
be the price per unit that the company can
charge if it sells units. Then is called the demand function (or price function) and we
would expect it to be a decreasing function of . If 
units are sold and the price per unit
is 
, then the total revenue is
and 
is called the revenue function. The derivative 
of the revenue function is called
the marginal revenue function and is the rate of change of revenue with respect to the
number of units sold.
If units are sold, then the total proﬁt is
and 
is called the proﬁt function. The marginal proﬁt function is 
, the derivative of
the proﬁt function. In Exercises 43–48 you are asked to use the marginal cost, revenue,
and proﬁt functions to minimize costs and maximize revenues and proﬁts.

Maximizing revenue
A store has been selling 200 DVD burners a week
at 
each. A market survey indicates that for each 
rebate offered to buyers, the
number of units sold will increase by 20 a week. Find the demand function and the rev-
enue function. How large a rebate should the store offer to maximize its revenue?
SOLUTION If is the number of DVD burners sold per week, then the weekly increase in
sales is 
. For each increase of 20 units sold, the price is decreased by 
. So for
each additional unit sold, the decrease in price will be 
and the demand function
is

59. Ornithologists have determined that some species of birds tend
to avoid ﬂights over large bodies of water during daylight
hours. It is believed that more energy is required to ﬂy over
water than over land because air generally rises over land and
falls over water during the day. A bird with these tendencies is
released from an island that is 5 km from the nearest point 
on a straight shoreline, ﬂies to a point 
on the shoreline, and
then ﬂies along the shoreline to its nesting area . Assume that
the bird instinctively chooses a path that will minimize its
energy expenditure. Points 
and 
are 13 km apart.
(a) In general, if it takes 1.4 times as much energy to ﬂy over
water as it does over land, to what point 
should the bird
ﬂy in order to minimize the total energy expended in
returning to its nesting area?
(b) Let 
and L denote the energy (in joules) per kilometer
ﬂown over water and land, respectively. What would a large
value of the ratio WL mean in terms of the bird’s ﬂight?
What would a small value mean? Determine the ratio 
corresponding to the minimum expenditure of energy.
(c) What should the value of 
be in order for the bird to ﬂy
directly to its nesting area ? What should the value of 
be for the bird to ﬂy to 
and then along the shore to

reach the shore at a point 4 km from B, how many times
more energy does it take a bird to ﬂy over water than over
land?

when the resistance of the blood is lowered. One of Poiseuille’s

APPLIED PROJECT
THE SHAPE OF A CAN
311
APPLIED PROJECT
The Shape of a Can
In this project we investigate the most economical shape for a can. We ﬁrst interpret this to mean
that the volume 
of a cylindrical can is given and we need to ﬁnd the height and radius that
minimize the cost of the metal to make the can (see the ﬁgure). If we disregard any waste metal 
in the manufacturing process, then the problem is to minimize the surface area of the cylinder. We
solved this problem in Example 2 in Section 4.6 and we found that 
; that is, the height
should be the same as the diameter. But if you go to your cupboard or your supermarket with a
ruler, you will discover that the height is usually greater than the diameter and the ratio 
varies
from 2 up to about 3.8. Let’s see if we can explain this phenomenon.
1. The material for the cans is cut from sheets of metal. The cylindrical sides are formed by
bending rectangles; these rectangles are cut from the sheet with little or no waste. But if
the top and bottom discs are cut from squares of side 
(as in the ﬁgure), this leaves
considerable waste metal, which may be recycled but has little or no value to the can
makers. If this is the case, show that the amount of metal used is minimized when
2. A more efﬁcient packing of the discs is obtained by dividing the metal sheet into hexagons
and cutting the circular lids and bases from the hexagons (see the ﬁgure). Show that if this
strategy is adopted, then
3. The values of 
that we found in Problems 1 and 2 are a little closer to the ones that 
actually occur on supermarket shelves, but they still don’t account for everything. If we 
look more closely at some real cans, we see that the lid and the base are formed from
discs with radius larger than that are bent over the ends of the can. If we allow for this
we would increase 
. More signiﬁcantly, in addition to the cost of the metal we need to
incorporate the manufacturing of the can into the cost. Let’s assume that most of the
expense is incurred in joining the sides to the rims of the cans. If we cut the discs from
hexagons as in Problem 2, then the total cost is proportional to
where is the reciprocal of the length that can be joined for the cost of one unit area of
metal. Show that this expression is minimized when
; 4. Plot 
as a function of 
and use your graph to argue that when a can is large
or joining is cheap, we should make 
approximately 2.21 (as in Problem 2). But when
the can is small or joining is costly, 
should be substantially larger.
5. Our analysis shows that large cans should be almost square but small cans should be tall
and thin. Take a look at the relative shapes of the cans in a supermarket. Is our conclusion
usually true in practice? Are there exceptions? Can you suggest reasons why small cans
are not always tall and thin?

Suppose that a car dealer offers to sell you a car for $18,000 or for payments of $375 per
month for ﬁve years. You would like to know what monthly interest rate the dealer is, in
effect, charging you. To ﬁnd the answer, you have to solve the equation
(The details are explained in Exercise 33.) How would you solve such an equation?
For a quadratic equation 
there is a well-known formula for the roots.
For third- and fourth-degree equations there are also formulas for the roots, but they are
extremely complicated. If f is a polynomial of degree 5 or higher, there is no such formula
(see the note on page 213). Likewise, there is no formula that will enable us to ﬁnd the
exact roots of a transcendental equation such as 
.
We can ﬁnd an approximate solution to Equation 1 by plotting the left side of the equa-
tion. Using a graphing device, and after experimenting with viewing rectangles, we pro-
duce the graph in Figure 1.
We see that in addition to the solution x  0, which doesn’t interest us, there is a solu-
tion between 0.007 and 0.008. Zooming in shows that the root is approximately 0.0076. If
we need more accuracy we could zoom in repeatedly, but that becomes tiresome. A faster
alternative is to use a numerical rootﬁnder on a calculator or computer algebra system. If
we do so, we ﬁnd that the root, correct to nine decimal places, is 0.007628603.
How do those numerical rootﬁnders work? They use a variety of methods, but most of
them make some use of Newton’s method, also called the Newton-Raphson method. We
will explain how this method works, partly to show what happens inside a calculator or
computer, and partly as an application of the idea of linear approximation.
The geometry behind Newton’s method is shown in Figure 2, where the root that we are
trying to ﬁnd is labeled . We start with a ﬁrst approximation 
, which is obtained by
guessing, or from a rough sketch of the graph of , or from a computer-generated graph 
of f. Consider the tangent line 
to the curve 
at the point 
and look 
at the -intercept of , labeled . The idea behind Newton’s method is that the tangent line
is close to the curve and so its x-intercept, 
, is close to the x-intercept of the curve 
(namely, the root r that we are seeking). Because the tangent is a line, we can easily ﬁnd
its x-intercept.
To ﬁnd a formula for 
in terms of 
we use the fact that the slope of L is 
, so its
equation is
Since the -intercept of 
is 
, we set 
and obtain
If 
, we can solve this equation for 
:
We use 
as a second approximation to r.

Next we repeat this procedure with 
replaced by the second approximation 
, using
the tangent line at 
. This gives a third approximation:
If we keep repeating this process, we obtain a sequence of approximations 
as shown in Figure 3. In general, if the th approximation is 
and 
, then the
next approximation is given by
If the numbers 
become closer and closer to as 
becomes large, then we say that
the sequence converges to and we write
| Although the sequence of successive approximations converges to the desired root for
functions of the type illustrated in Figure 3, in certain circumstances the sequence may not
converge. For example, consider the situation shown in Figure 4. You can see that 
is a
worse approximation than . This is likely to be the case when 
is close to 0. It might
even happen that an approximation (such as 
in Figure 4) falls outside the domain of .
Then Newton’s method fails and a better initial approximation 
should be chosen. See
Exercises 25–27 for speciﬁc examples in which Newton’s method works very slowly or
does not work at all.
Starting with

APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
Suppose that we want to achieve a given accuracy, say to eight decimal places, using
Newton’s method. How do we know when to stop? The rule of thumb that is generally used
is that we can stop when successive approximations 
and 
agree to eight decimal
places. (A precise statement concerning accuracy in Newton’s method will be given in
Exercise 33 in Section 8.8.)
Notice that the procedure in going from to 
is the same for all values of . (It is
called an iterative process.) This means that Newton’s method is particularly convenient
for use with a programmable calculator or a computer.
Use Newton’s method to ﬁnd 
correct to eight decimal places.
SOLUTION First we observe that ﬁnding 
is equivalent to ﬁnding the positive root of
the equation
so we take 
. Then 
and Formula 2 (Newton’s method)
becomes
If we choose 
as the initial approximation, then we obtain
Since 
and 
agree to eight decimal places, we conclude that
to eight decimal places.
Find, correct to six decimal places, the root of the equation 
.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst rewrite the equation in standard form:
Therefore we let

, so Formula 2 becomes
In order to guess a suitable value for

SECTION 4.7
NEWTON’S METHOD
315
Since 
and 
agree to six decimal places (eight, in fact), we conclude that the root of
the equation, correct to six decimal places, is 
.
Instead of using the rough sketch in Figure 6 to get a starting approximation for
Newton’s method in Example 3, we could have used the more accurate graph that a calcu-
lator or computer provides. Figure 7 suggests that we use 
as the initial approx-
imation. Then Newton’s method gives
and so we obtain the same answer as before, but with one fewer step.
You might wonder why we bother at all with Newton’s method if a graphing device is
available. Isn’t it easier to zoom in repeatedly and ﬁnd the roots as we did in Section 1.4?
If only one or two decimal places of accuracy are required, then indeed Newton’s method
is inappropriate and a graphing device sufﬁces. But if six or eight decimal places are
required, then repeated zooming becomes tiresome. It is usually faster and more efﬁcient
to use a computer and Newton’s method in tandem—the graphing device to get started and
Newton’s method to ﬁnish.

A physicist who knows the velocity of a particle might wish to know its position at a given
time. An engineer who can measure the variable rate at which water is leaking from a tank
wants to know the amount leaked over a certain time period. A biologist who knows the
rate at which a bacteria population is increasing might want to deduce what the size of 
the population will be at some future time. In each case, the problem is to ﬁnd a function
F whose derivative is a known function f. If such a function F exists, it is called an anti-
derivative of f.
Deﬁnition A function 
is called an antiderivative of 
on an interval if
for all in .
In Section 2.8 we introduced the idea of an antiderivative and we learned how to sketch
the graph of an antiderivative of 
if we are given the graph of . Now that we know the
differentiation formulas, we are in a position to ﬁnd explicit expressions for antideriva-
tives. For instance, let 
. It isn’t difﬁcult to discover an antiderivative of 
if we
keep the Power Rule in mind. In fact, if 
, then 
. But the func-
tion 
also satisﬁes 
. Therefore both 
and 
are antideriva-
tives of . Indeed, any function of the form 
, where 
is a constant, is an
antiderivative of . The following theorem says that 
has no other antiderivative. A proof
of Theorem 1, using the Mean Value Theorem, is outlined in Exercise 55.
Theorem If 
is an antiderivative of 
on an interval , then the most general
antiderivative of 
on is
where 
is an arbitrary constant.
Going back to the function 
, we see that the general antiderivative of 
is
. By assigning speciﬁc values to the constant , we obtain a family of functions
whose graphs are vertical translates of one another (see Figure 1). This makes sense
because each curve must have the same slope at any given value of .x

So on the interval 
the general antiderivative of 
is 
. We also learned
that
for all 
. Theorem 1 then tells us that the general antiderivative of 
is
on any interval that doesn’t contain 0. In particular, this is true on each of the
intervals 
and 
. So the general antiderivative of 
is
(c) We use the Power Rule to discover an antiderivative of 
. In fact, if 
, then
Thus the general antiderivative of 
is
This is valid for 
since then 
is deﬁned on an interval. If n is negative
(but 
), it is valid on any interval that doesn’t contain 0.
As in Example 1, every differentiation formula, when read from right to left, gives rise
to an antidifferentiation formula. In Table 2 we list some particular antiderivatives. Each
formula in the table is true because the derivative of the function in the right column
appears in the left column. In particular, the ﬁrst formula says that the antiderivative of a
constant times a function is the constant times the antiderivative of the function. The sec-
ond formula says that the antiderivative of a sum is the sum of the antiderivatives. (We use
the notation 
, 
.)

In applications of calculus it is very common to have a situation as in Example 2, where
it is required to ﬁnd a function, given knowledge about its derivatives. An equation that
involves the derivatives of a function is called a differential equation. These will be 
studied in some detail in Chapter 7, but for the present we can solve some elementary dif-
ferential equations. The general solution of a differential equation involves an arbitrary
constant (or constants) as in Example 2. However, there may be some extra conditions

Rectilinear Motion
Antidifferentiation is particularly useful in analyzing the motion of an object moving in a
straight line. Recall that if the object has position function 
, then the velocity func-
tion is 
. This means that the position function is an antiderivative of the veloc-
ity function. Likewise, the acceleration function is 
, so the velocity function is
an antiderivative of the acceleration. If the acceleration and the initial values 
and 
are known, then the position function can be found by antidifferentiating twice.
Finding position, given acceleration

and has acceleration given by 
. Its initial velocity is

An object near the surface of the earth is subject to a gravitational force that produces
a downward acceleration denoted by . For motion close to the ground we may assume that
is constant, its value being about 
ms (or 
fts ).
A ball is thrown upward with a speed of 
fts from the edge of a cliff 
ft above the ground. Find its height above the ground seconds later. When does it
reach its maximum height? When does it hit the ground?
SOLUTION The motion is vertical and we choose the positive direction to be upward. At
time the distance above the ground is 
and the velocity 
is decreasing. Therefore
the acceleration must be negative and we have

APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION

Focus on Problem Solving
One of the most important principles of problem solving is analogy (see page 83). If you
are having trouble getting started on a problem, it is sometimes helpful to start by solving
a similar, but simpler, problem. The following example illustrates the principle. Cover up
the solution and try solving it yourself ﬁrst.
If x, y, and are positive numbers, prove that
SOLUTION It may be difﬁcult to get started on this problem. (Some students have tackled 
it by multiplying out the numerator, but that just creates a mess.) Let’s try to think of a
similar, simpler problem. When several variables are involved, it’s often helpful to think
of an analogous problem with fewer variables. In the present case we can reduce the
number of variables from three to one and prove the analogous inequality
In fact, if we are able to prove (1), then the desired inequality follows because
The key to proving (1) is to recognize that it is a disguised version of a minimum prob-
lem. If we let

Integrals
In Chapter 2 we used the tangent and velocity problems to introduce the deriva-
tive, which is the central idea in differential calculus. In much the same way, this
chapter starts with the area and distance problems and uses them to formulate
the idea of a deﬁnite integral, which is the basic concept of integral calculus. We
will see in Chapters 6 and 7 how to use the integral to solve problems concern-
ing volumes, lengths of curves, population predictions, cardiac output, forces on
a dam, work, consumer surplus, and baseball, among many others.
There is a connection between integral calculus and differential calculus. The
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus relates the integral to the derivative, and we
will see in this chapter that it greatly simpliﬁes the solution of many problems.

CHAPTER 5
INTEGRALS
In this section we discover that in trying to ﬁnd the area under a curve or the distance 
traveled by a car, we end up with the same special type of limit.
The Area Problem
We begin by attempting to solve the area problem: Find the area of the region 
that lies
under the curve 
from to . This means that , illustrated in Figure 1, is bounded
by the graph of a continuous function 
[where 
], the vertical lines 
and
, and the -axis.
In trying to solve the area problem we have to ask ourselves: What is the meaning of
the word area? This question is easy to answer for regions with straight sides. For a rect-
angle, the area is deﬁned as the product of the length and the width. The area of a triangle
is half the base times the height. The area of a polygon is found by dividing it into tri-
angles (as in Figure 2) and adding the areas of the triangles.
However, it isn’t so easy to ﬁnd the area of a region with curved sides. We all have an
intuitive idea of what the area of a region is. But part of the area problem is to make this
intuitive idea precise by giving an exact deﬁnition of area.
Recall that in deﬁning a tangent we ﬁrst approximated the slope of the tangent line by
slopes of secant lines and then we took the limit of these approximations. We pursue a sim-
ilar idea for areas. We ﬁrst approximate the region 
by rectangles and then we take the
limit of the areas of these rectangles as we increase the number of rectangles. The follow-
ing example illustrates the procedure.
Estimating an area
Use rectangles to estimate the area under the 
parabola 
from 0 to 1 (the parabolic region S illustrated in Figure 3).
SOLUTION We ﬁrst notice that the area of S must be somewhere between 0 and 1 because 
is contained in a square with side length 1, but we can certainly do better than that.
Suppose we divide S into four strips 
, 
, 
, and 
by drawing the vertical lines 
,
, and 
as in Figure 4(a).

AREAS AND DISTANCES
333
We can approximate each strip by a rectangle whose base is the same as the strip and
whose height is the same as the right edge of the strip [see Figure 4(b)]. In other words,
the heights of these rectangles are the values of the function 
at the right end-
points of the subintervals 
, 
, 
, and 
.
Each rectangle has width and the heights are 
, 
, 
, and 
. If we let 
be
the sum of the areas of these approximating rectangles, we get
From Figure 4(b) we see that the area A of S is less than 
, so
Instead of using the rectangles in Figure 4(b) we could use the smaller rectangles in
Figure 5 whose heights are the values of 
at the left endpoints of the subintervals. (The
leftmost rectangle has collapsed because its height is 0.) The sum of the areas of these
approximating rectangles is
We see that the area of S is larger than 
, so we have lower and upper estimates for A:
We can repeat this procedure with a larger number of strips. Figure 6 shows what
happens when we divide the region S into eight strips of equal width.
By computing the sum of the areas of the smaller rectangles 
and the sum of the
areas of the larger rectangles 
, we obtain better lower and upper estimates for :
So one possible answer to the question is to say that the true area of S lies somewhere
between 0.2734375 and 0.3984375.
We could obtain better estimates by increasing the number of strips. The table at the
left shows the results of similar calculations (with a computer) using n rectangles whose
heights are found with left endpoints 
or right endpoints 
. In particular, we see
by using 50 strips that the area lies between 0.3234 and 0.3434. With 1000 strips we
narrow it down even more: A lies between 0.3328335 and 0.3338335. A good estimate is
obtained by averaging these numbers:

Here we need the formula for the sum of the squares of the ﬁrst n positive integers:

Deﬁnition The area A of the region S that lies under the graph of the continu-
ous function
is the limit of the sum of the areas of approximating rectangles:
It can be proved that the limit in Deﬁnition 2 always exists, since we are assuming that
is continuous. It can also be shown that we get the same value if we use left endpoints:
In fact, instead of using left endpoints or right endpoints, we could take the height of the
ith rectangle to be the value of f at any number 
in the ith subinterval 
. We call
the numbers 
, 
, . . . , 
the sample points. Figure 13 shows approximating rectangles
when the sample points are not chosen to be endpoints. So a more general expression for the
area of S is
We often use sigma notation to write sums with many terms more compactly. For
instance,

easily using a different method.

The Distance Problem
Now let’s consider the distance problem: Find the distance traveled by an object during a
certain time period if the velocity of the object is known at all times. (In a sense this is the
inverse problem of the velocity problem that we discussed in Section 2.1.) If the velocity
remains constant, then the distance problem is easy to solve by means of the formula
But if the velocity varies, it’s not so easy to ﬁnd the distance traveled. We investigate the
problem in the following example.
Estimating a distance
Suppose the odometer on our car is broken and we
want to estimate the distance driven over a 30-second time interval. We take speedometer
readings every ﬁve seconds and record them in the following table:
In order to have the time and the velocity in consistent units, let’s convert the velocity
readings to feet per second (1 mih  52803600 fts):
During the ﬁrst ﬁve seconds the velocity doesn’t change very much, so we can estimate
the distance traveled during that time by assuming that the velocity is constant. If we
take the velocity during that time interval to be the initial velocity (25 fts), then we
obtain the approximate distance traveled during the ﬁrst ﬁve seconds:
Similarly, during the second time interval the velocity is approximately constant and we
take it to be the velocity when t  5 s. So our estimate for the distance traveled from
to 
is
If we add similar estimates for the other time intervals, we obtain an estimate for the
total distance traveled:

CHAPTER 5

We could just as well have used the velocity at the end of each time period instead 
of the velocity at the beginning as our assumed constant velocity. Then our estimate
becomes
If we had wanted a more accurate estimate, we could have taken velocity readings
every two seconds, or even every second.
Perhaps the calculations in Example 4 remind you of the sums we used earlier to esti-
mate areas. The similarity is explained when we sketch a graph of the velocity function of
the car in Figure 16 and draw rectangles whose heights are the initial velocities for each
time interval. The area of the ﬁrst rectangle is 
, which is also our estimate
for the distance traveled in the ﬁrst ﬁve seconds. In fact, the area of each rectangle can be
interpreted as a distance because the height represents velocity and the width represents
time. The sum of the areas of the rectangles in Figure 16 is 
, which is our ini-
tial estimate for the total distance traveled.
In general, suppose an object moves with velocity 
, where 
and
(so the object always moves in the positive direction). We take velocity readings
at times 
so that the velocity is approximately constant on each
subinterval. If these times are equally spaced, then the time between consecutive readings
is 
. During the ﬁrst time interval the velocity is approximately 
and so
the distance traveled is approximately 
. Similarly, the distance traveled during the
second time interval is about 
and the total distance traveled during the time inter-
val 
is approximately
If we use the velocity at right endpoints instead of left endpoints, our estimate for the total
distance becomes
The more frequently we measure the velocity, the more accurate our estimates become, so
it seems plausible that the exact distance d traveled is the limit of such expressions:
We will see in Section 5.3 that this is indeed true.
Because Equation 5 has the same form as our expressions for area in Equations 2 and
3, it follows that the distance traveled is equal to the area under the graph of the velocity
function. In Chapter 6 we will see that other quantities of interest in the natural and social
sciences—such as the work done by a variable force or the cardiac output of the heart—
can also be interpreted as the area under a curve. So when we compute areas in this chap-
ter, bear in mind that they can be interpreted in a variety of practical ways.

We saw in Section 5.1 that a limit of the form
arises when we compute an area. We also saw that it arises when we try to ﬁnd the dis-
tance traveled by an object. It turns out that this same type of limit occurs in a wide vari-
ety of situations even when 
is not necessarily a positive function. In Chapter 6 we will
see that limits of the form (1) also arise in ﬁnding lengths of curves, volumes of solids,
centers of mass, force due to water pressure, and work, as well as other quantities. We
therefore give this type of limit a special name and notation.
Deﬁnition of a Deﬁnite Integral If 
is a function deﬁned for 
, we
divide the interval 
into n subintervals of equal width 
. We let
( b) be the endpoints of these subintervals and we let
be any sample points in these subintervals, so 
lies in the ith
subinterval 
. Then the deﬁnite integral of f from a to b is
provided that this limit exists. If it does exist, we say that 
is integrable on 
Note 1: The symbol 
was introduced by Leibniz and is called an integral sign. It is 
an elongated 
and was chosen because an integral is a limit of sums. In the notation
is called the integrand and 
and 
are called the limits of integration; 
is the lower limit and 
is the upper limit. For now, the symbol 
has no meaning 
by itself; 
is all one symbol. The 
simply indicates that the independent vari-
able is . The procedure of calculating an integral is called integration.
Note 2: The deﬁnite integral 
is a number; it does not depend on . In fact, we
could use any letter in place of without changing the value of the integral:

The Definite Integral
A precise deﬁnition of this type of limit is given
in Appendix D.

CHAPTER 5
INTEGRALS
Note 3: The sum
that occurs in Deﬁnition 2 is called a Riemann sum after the German mathematician
Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866). So Deﬁnition 2 says that the deﬁnite integral of an inte-
grable function can be approximated to within any desired degree of accuracy by a Riemann
sum.
We know that if 
happens to be positive, then the Riemann sum can be interpreted as
a sum of areas of approximating rectangles (see Figure 1). By comparing Deﬁnition 2 with
the deﬁnition of area in Section 5.1, we see that the deﬁnite integral 
can be inter-
preted as the area under the curve 
from a to b. (See Figure 2.)
If 
takes on both positive and negative values, as in Figure 3, then the Riemann sum is
the sum of the areas of the rectangles that lie above the -axis and the negatives of the areas
of the rectangles that lie below the -axis (the areas of the blue rectangles minus the areas
of the gold rectangles). When we take the limit of such Riemann sums, we get the situa-
tion illustrated in Figure 4. A deﬁnite integral can be interpreted as a net area, that is, a
difference of areas:
where 
is the area of the region above the -axis and below the graph of , and 
is the
area of the region below the -axis and above the graph of .
Note 4: Although we have deﬁned 
by dividing 
into subintervals of
equal width, there are situations in which it is advantageous to work with subintervals 
of unequal width. For instance, in Exercise 14 in Section 5.1 NASA provided velocity data
at times that were not equally spaced, but we were still able to estimate the distance trav-
eled. And there are methods for numerical integration that take advantage of unequal
subintervals.
If the subinterval widths are 
, we have to ensure that all these widths
approach 0 in the limiting process. This happens if the largest width, 
, approaches
0. So in this case the deﬁnition of a deﬁnite integral becomes

Riemann
Bernhard Riemann received his Ph.D. under the
direction of the legendary Gauss at the Univer-
sity of Göttingen and remained there to teach.
Gauss, who was not in the habit of praising
other mathematicians, spoke of Riemann’s 
“creative, active, truly mathematical mind and
gloriously fertile originality.” The deﬁnition (2) 
of an integral that we use is due to Riemann.
He also made major contributions to the theory
of functions of a complex variable, mathemati-
cal physics, number theory, and the foundations
of geometry. Riemann’s broad concept of space
and geometry turned out to be the right setting,
50 years later, for Einstein’s general relativity
theory. Riemann’s health was poor throughout
his life, and he died of tuberculosis at the age
of 39.

Note 5: We have deﬁned the deﬁnite integral for an integrable function, but not all func-
tions are integrable (see Exercises 55–56). The following theorem shows that the most
commonly occurring functions are in fact integrable. It is proved in more advanced courses.
Theorem If is continuous on 
, or if has only a ﬁnite number of jump
discontinuities, then is integrable on 
; that is, the deﬁnite integral 
exists.
If 
is integrable on 
, then the limit in Deﬁnition 2 exists and gives the same value
no matter how we choose the sample points 
. To simplify the calculation of the integral
we often take the sample points to be right endpoints. Then 
and the deﬁnition of
an integral simpliﬁes as follows.
Theorem If 
is integrable on 
, then

SOLUTION Comparing the given limit with the limit in Theorem 4, we see that they will 
be identical if we choose 
. We are given that 
and 
.
Therefore, by Theorem 4, we have
Later, when we apply the deﬁnite integral to physical situations, it will be important to
recognize limits of sums as integrals, as we did in Example 1. When Leibniz chose the
notation for an integral, he chose the ingredients as reminders of the limiting process. In
general, when we write
we replace 
by , 
by x, and 
by dx.
Evaluating Integrals

Notice that f is not a positive function and so the Riemann sum does not represent a sum
of areas of rectangles. But it does represent the sum of the areas of the blue rectangles
(above the x-axis) minus the sum of the areas of the gold rectangles (below the x-axis) in
Figure 5.

The Midpoint Rule
We often choose the sample point 
to be the right endpoint of the th subinterval because
it is convenient for computing the limit. But if the purpose is to ﬁnd an approximation to
an integral, it is usually better to choose 
to be the midpoint of the interval, which we
denote by . Any Riemann sum is an approximation to an integral, but if we use midpoints
we get the following approximation.

CHAPTER 5
INTEGRALS
At the moment we don’t know how accurate the approximation in Example 5 is, but in
Section 5.9 we will learn a method for estimating the error involved in using the Midpoint
Rule. At that time we will discuss other methods for approximating deﬁnite integrals.
If we apply the Midpoint Rule to the integral in Example 2, we get the picture in Fig-
ure 12. The approximation 
is much closer to the true value 
than the
right endpoint approximation, 
, shown in Figure 7.
Properties of the Deﬁnite Integral
When we deﬁned the deﬁnite integral 
, we implicitly assumed that

deﬁnition as a limit of Riemann sums makes sense even if 
. Notice that if we reverse
a and b, then 
changes from

in a simple manner. We assume that f and t are continuous functions.

Property 2 says that the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals. For positive func-
tions it says that the area under 
is the area under 
plus the area under t. Figure 14
helps us understand why this is true: In view of how graphical addition works, the corre-
sponding vertical line segments have equal height.
In general, Property 2 follows from Theorem 4 and the fact that the limit of a sum is the
sum of the limits:
Property 3 can be proved in a similar manner and says that the integral of a constant
times a function is the constant times the integral of the function. In other words, a con-
stant (but only a constant) can be taken in front of an integral sign. Property 4 is proved by
writing 
and using Properties 2 and 3 with 
.
Use the properties of integrals to evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Using Properties 2 and 3 of integrals, we have
We know from Property 1 that
and we found in Example 2 in Section 5.1 that 
. So
The next property tells us how to combine integrals of the same function over adjacent
intervals:
5.
This is not easy to prove in general, but for the case where 
and 
Property 5 can be seen from the geometric interpretation in Figure 15: The area under
from a to c plus the area from c to b is equal to the total area from a to b.

Property 3 seems intuitively reasonable 
because we know that multiplying a function 
by a positive number stretches or shrinks its
graph vertically by a factor of . So it stretches
or shrinks each approximating rectangle by a 
factor and therefore it has the effect of 
multiplying the area by .c

interpretation of Property 6 is simply that areas are positive. (It also follows directly from
the deﬁnition because all the quantities involved are positive.) Property 7 says that a big-

Using Property 1 to evaluate the integrals on the left and right sides, we obtain
Property 8 is useful when all we want is a rough estimate of the size of an integral with-

CHAPTER 5
INTEGRALS
In Section 5.2 we computed integrals from the deﬁnition as a limit of Riemann sums and
we saw that this procedure is sometimes long and difﬁcult. Sir Isaac Newton discovered a
much simpler method for evaluating integrals and a few years later Leibniz made the same
discovery. They realized that they could calculate 
if they happened to know an
antiderivative 
of . Their discovery, called the Evaluation Theorem, is part of the Funda-
mental Theorem of Calculus, which is discussed in the next section.
Evaluation Theorem If 
is continuous on the interval 
, then
where 
is any antiderivative of , that is, 
.
This theorem states that if we know an antiderivative 
of , then we can evaluate
simply by subtracting the values of 
at the endpoints of the interval 
. It is 
very surprising that 
, which was deﬁned by a complicated procedure involving all
of the values of 
for 
, can be found by knowing the values of 
at only
two points, and .
For instance, we know from Section 4.8 that an antiderivative of the function 
is 
, so the Evaluation Theorem tells us that 
Comparing this method with the calculation in Example 2 in Section 5.1, where we found
the area under the parabola 
from 0 to 1 by computing a limit of sums, we see that
the Evaluation Theorem provides us with a simple and powerful method.
Although the Evaluation Theorem may be surprising at ﬁrst glance, it becomes plaus-
ible if we interpret it in physical terms. If 
is the velocity of an object and 
is its posi-
tion at time t, then 
, so s is an antiderivative of . In Section 5.1 we considered
an object that always moves in the positive direction and made the guess that the area
under the velocity curve is equal to the distance traveled. In symbols:
That is exactly what the Evaluation Theorem says in this context.
PROOF OF THE EVALUATION THEOREM We divide the interval 
into subintervals with
endpoints 
, , 
, 
and with length 
. Let 
be any
antiderivative of . By subtracting and adding like terms, we can express the total differ-
ence in the 
values as the sum of the differences over the subintervals:
Now 
is continuous (because it’s differentiable) and so we can apply the Mean Value
Theorem to 
on each subinterval 
. Thus there exists a number 
between 
and 
such that

Evaluating Definite Integrals
The Mean Value Theorem was discussed 
in Section 4.3.

Therefore
Now we take the limit of each side of this equation as 
. The left side is a con-
stant and the right side is a Riemann sum for the function , so
When applying the Evaluation Theorem we use the notation
and so we can write
Other common notations are 
and 
.
Using the Evaluation Theorem
Evaluate  
.
SOLUTION An antiderivative of 
is 
, so we use the Evaluation 
Theorem as follows:
If you compare the calculation in Example 1 with the one in Example 3 in Section 5.2,
you will see that the Evaluation Theorem gives a much shorter method.
Find the area under the cosine curve from to , where 
.
SOLUTION Since an antiderivative of 
is 
, we have
In particular, taking 
, we have proved that the area under the cosine curve
from 0 to 
is 
. (See Figure 1.)
When the French mathematician Gilles de Roberval ﬁrst found the area under the sine
and cosine curves in 1635, this was a very challenging problem that required a great deal
of ingenuity. If we didn’t have the beneﬁt of the Evaluation Theorem, we would have to
compute a difﬁcult limit of sums using obscure trigonometric identities (or a computer
algebra system as in Exercise 27 in Section 5.1). It was even more difﬁcult for Roberval
because the apparatus of limits had not been invented in 1635. But in the 1660s and 1670s,
when the Evaluation Theorem was discovered by Newton and Leibniz, such problems
became very easy, as you can see from Example 2.
Indefinite Integrals
We need a convenient notation for antiderivatives that makes them easy to work with.

grals, the notation 
is traditionally used for an antiderivative of

indeﬁnite integral. Thus

You should distinguish carefully between deﬁnite and indeﬁnite integrals. A definite
integral 
is a number, whereas an indeﬁnite integral 
is a function (or fam-
ily of functions). The connection between them is given by the Evaluation Theorem: If 
is continuous on 
, then
Recall from Section 4.8 that if 
is an antiderivative of 
on an interval , then the most
general antiderivative of on is 
, where 
is an arbitrary constant. For instance,
the formula
is valid (on any interval that doesn’t contain 0) because 
. So an indeﬁ-
nite integral 
can represent either a particular antiderivative of 
or an entire fam-
ily of antiderivatives (one for each value of the constant ).
The effectiveness of the Evaluation Theorem depends on having a supply of antideriv-
atives of functions. We therefore restate the Table of Antidifferentiation Formulas from
Section 4.8, together with a few others, in the notation of indeﬁnite integrals. Any form-
ula can be veriﬁed by differentiating the function on the right side and obtaining the inte-
grand. For instance,

Simplifying before integrating
Evaluate

SOLUTION First we need to write the integrand in a simpler form by carrying out the
division:
Applications
The Evaluation Theorem says that if 
is continuous on 
, then
where 
is any antiderivative of . This means that 
, so the equation can be rewrit-
ten as
We know that 
represents the rate of change of 
with respect to x and
is the change in y when x changes from a to b. [Note that could, for instance,
increase, then decrease, then increase again. Although 
might change in both directions,
represents the net change in .] So we can reformulate the Evaluation
Theorem in words as follows.
Net Change Theorem The integral of a rate of change is the net change: 
This principle can be applied to all of the rates of change in the natural and social sci-
ences that we discussed in Section 3.8. Here are a few instances of this idea:
■If 
is the volume of water in a reservoir at time t, then its derivative 
is
the rate at which water ﬂows into the reservoir at time t. So
is the change in the amount of water in the reservoir between time
and time
.
■If 
is the concentration of the product of a chemical reaction at time t, then
the rate of reaction is the derivative 
. So
is the change in the concentration of C from time 
to time .

■If the mass of a rod measured from the left end to a point x is 
, then the
linear density is 
. So
is the mass of the segment of the rod that lies between 
and 
.
■If the rate of growth of a population is 
, then
is the net change in population during the time period from 
to . (The popu-
lation increases when births happen and decreases when deaths occur. The net
change takes into account both births and deaths.)
■If 
is the cost of producing x units of a commodity, then the marginal cost is
the derivative 
. So
is the increase in cost when production is increased from 
units to
units.
■If an object moves along a straight line with position function 
, then its
velocity is 
, so
is the net change of position, or displacement, of the particle during the time
period from 
to . In Section 5.1 we guessed that this was true for the case
where the object moves in the positive direction, but now we have proved that it
is always true.
■If we want to calculate the distance the object travels during the time interval,
we have to consider the intervals when 
(the particle moves to the right)
and also the intervals when 
(the particle moves to the left). In both
cases the distance is computed by integrating 
, the speed. Therefore
Figure 4 shows how both displacement and distance traveled can be interpreted
in terms of areas under a velocity curve.

Displacement versus distance
A particle moves along a line so that its
velocity at time is 
(measured in meters per second).
(a) Find the displacement of the particle during the time period 
.
(b) Find the distance traveled during this time period.
SOLUTION
(a) By Equation 2, the displacement is
This means that the particle’s position at time 
is 4.5 m to the left of its position at
the start of the time period.

SOLUTION Power is the rate of change of energy: 
. So, by the Net Change
Theorem,
is the total amount of energy used on that day. We approximate the value of the integral
using the Midpoint Rule with 12 subintervals and 
:
The energy used was approximately 15,840 megawatt-hours.
A note on units
How did we know what units to use for energy in Example 8? The integral 
is
deﬁned as the limit of sums of terms of the form 
. Now 
is measured in
megawatts and 
is measured in hours, so their product is measured in megawatt-hours.
The same is true of the limit. In general, the unit of measurement for

uct of the unit for 
and the unit for x.

to describe the distribution of income between households in a
given country. Typically, a Lorenz curve is deﬁned on

by ranking all households by income and then computing the
percentage of households whose income is less than or equal 
to a given percentage of the total income of the country. For
example, the point 
is on the Lorenz curve if the
bottom 
of the households receive less than or equal to 
of the total income. Absolute equality of income distribution
would occur if the bottom 
of the households receive 
of
the income, in which case the Lorenz curve would be the line
. The area between the Lorenz curve and the line 
measures how much the income distribution differs from
absolute equality. The coefﬁcient of inequality is the ratio of the

SECTION 5.4
THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS
367
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is appropriately named because it establishes a
connection between the two branches of calculus: differential calculus and integral calcu-
lus. Differential calculus arose from the tangent problem, whereas integral calculus arose
from a seemingly unrelated problem, the area problem. Newton’s mentor at Cambridge,
Isaac Barrow (1630–1677), discovered that these two problems are actually closely 
related. In fact, he realized that differentiation and integration are inverse processes. The
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives the precise inverse relationship between the
derivative and the integral. It was Newton and Leibniz who exploited this relationship and
used it to develop calculus into a systematic mathematical method.
The ﬁrst part of the Fundamental Theorem deals with functions deﬁned by an equation
of the form
where 
is a continuous function on 
and 
varies between 
and . Observe that 
depends only on , which appears as the variable upper limit in the integral. If is a ﬁxed
number, then the integral 
is a deﬁnite number. If we then let 
vary, the number
also varies and deﬁnes a function of denoted by 
.
If 
happens to be a positive function, then 
can be interpreted as the area under the
graph of 
from to , where can vary from to . (Think of as the “area so far” func-
tion; see Figure 1.)

SECTION 5.4
THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS
369
For the function in Example 2 notice that 
, that is, 
. In other words, if 
is deﬁned as the integral of 
by Equation 1, then turns out to be an antiderivative of ,
at least in this case. And if we sketch the derivative of the function shown in Figure 4 by
estimating slopes of tangents, we get a graph like that of 
in Figure 2. So we suspect that
in Example 1 too.
To see why this might be generally true we consider any continuous function 
with
. Then 
can be interpreted as the area under the graph of 
from
to , as in Figure 1.
In order to compute 
from the deﬁnition of a derivative we ﬁrst observe that, 
for 
is obtained by subtracting areas, so it is the area under the
graph of 
from 
to 
(the blue area in Figure 5). For small 
you can see from the
ﬁgure that this area is approximately equal to the area of the rectangle with height 
and
width :
so
Intuitively, we therefore expect that
The fact that this is true, even when 
is not necessarily positive, is the ﬁrst part of the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1 If 
is continuous on 
, then the
function deﬁned by
is an antiderivative of , that is, 
for 
.
Using Leibniz notation for derivatives, we can write this theorem as
when 
is continuous. Roughly speaking, this equation says that if we ﬁrst integrate 
and
then differentiate the result, we get back to the original function .
It is easy to prove the Fundamental Theorem if we make the assumption that 
possesses
an antiderivative . (This is certainly plausible. After all, we sketched graphs of antideriv-
atives in Section 2.8.) Then, by the Evaluation Theorem,
for any between and . Therefore
as required. At the end of this section we present a proof without the assumption that an
antiderivative exists.

INTEGRALS
Differentiating an integral
Find the derivative of the function 
.
SOLUTION Since 
is continuous, Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus gives
A function from physics
Although a formula of the form 
may seem like a strange way of deﬁning a function, books on physics, chemistry, and
statistics are full of such functions. For instance, the Fresnel function
is named after the French physicist Augustin Fresnel (1788–1827), who is famous for his
works in optics. This function ﬁrst appeared in Fresnel’s theory of the diffraction of light
waves, but more recently it has been applied to the design of highways.
Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem tells us how to differentiate the Fresnel function:
This means that we can apply all the methods of differential calculus to analyze 
(see
Exercise 27).
Figure 6 shows the graphs of 
and the Fresnel function
. A computer was used to graph 
by computing the value of this integral
for many values of . It does indeed look as if 
is the area under the graph of 
from
to [until 
when 
becomes a difference of areas]. Figure 7 shows a larger
part of the graph of .
If we now start with the graph of 
in Figure 6 and think about what its derivative
should look like, it seems reasonable that 
. [For instance, 
is increasing
when 
and decreasing when 
.] So this gives a visual conﬁrmation of
Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Combining the Chain Rule with FTC1
Find 
.
SOLUTION Here we have to be careful to use the Chain Rule in conjunction with Part 1 of
the Fundamental Theorem. Let 
. Then
(by the Chain Rule)
(by FTC1)
Differentiation and Integration as Inverse Processes
We now bring together the two parts of the Fundamental Theorem. We regard Part 1 as fun-
damental because it relates integration and differentiation. But the Evaluation Theorem
from Section 5.3 also relates integrals and derivatives, so we rename it as Part 2 of the
Fundamental Theorem.

, where 
is any antiderivative of , that is, 
We noted that Part 1 can be rewritten as
which says that if 
is integrated and then the result is differentiated, we arrive back at the
original function . In Section 5.3 we reformulated Part 2 as the Net Change Theorem:
This version says that if we take a function , ﬁrst differentiate it, and then integrate the
result, we arrive back at the original function , but in the form 
. Taken togeth-
er, the two parts of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus say that differentiation and inte-
gration are inverse processes. Each undoes what the other does.
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is unquestionably the most important theorem
in calculus and, indeed, it ranks as one of the great accomplishments of the human mind.
Before it was discovered, from the time of Eudoxus and Archimedes to the time of Galileo
and Fermat, problems of ﬁnding areas, volumes, and lengths of curves were so difﬁcult
that only a genius could meet the challenge. But now, armed with the systematic method
that Newton and Leibniz fashioned out of the Fundamental Theorem, we will see in the
chapters to come that these challenging problems are accessible to all of us.
Proof of FTC1

WRITING PROJECT
Newton, Leibniz, and the Invention of Calculus
We sometimes read that the inventors of calculus were Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727) and 
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716). But we know that the basic ideas behind integration were
investigated 2500 years ago by ancient Greeks such as Eudoxus and Archimedes, and methods for
ﬁnding tangents were pioneered by Pierre Fermat (1601–1665), Isaac Barrow (1630–1677), and
others. Barrow––who taught at Cambridge and was a major inﬂuence on Newton––was the ﬁrst to
understand the inverse relationship between differentiation and integration. What Newton and
Leibniz did was to use this relationship, in the form of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, in

order to develop calculus into a systematic mathematical discipline. It is in this sense that Newton
and Leibniz are credited with the invention of calculus.
Read about the contributions of these men in one or more of the given references and write a
report on one of the following three topics. You can include biographical details, but the main
thrust of your report should be a description, in some detail, of their methods and notations. In
particular, you should consult one of the sourcebooks, which give excerpts from the original
publications of Newton and Leibniz, translated from Latin to English.

Because of the Fundamental Theorem, it’s important to be able to ﬁnd antiderivatives. But
our antidifferentiation formulas don’t tell us how to evaluate integrals such as
To ﬁnd this integral we use the problem-solving strategy of introducing something extra.
Here the “something extra” is a new variable; we change from the variable x to a new vari-
able u. Suppose that we let be the quantity under the root sign in (1):

formally, without justifying our calculation, we could write
But now we can check that we have the correct answer by using the Chain Rule to differ-
entiate the ﬁnal function of Equation 2: 
In general, this method works whenever we have an integral that we can write in the
form 
. Observe that if

because, by the Chain Rule, 
If we make the “change of variable” or “substitution” 
, then from Equation 3
we have 
or, writing 
, we get 
Thus we have proved the following rule.
The Substitution Rule If

interval and 
is continuous on , then
Notice that the Substitution Rule for integration was proved using the Chain Rule for
differentiation. Notice also that if 
, then 
, so a way to remember the
Substitution Rule is to think of 
and 
in (4) as differentials.
Thus the Substitution Rule says: It is permissible to operate with dx and du after
integral signs as if they were differentials.

and the Substitution Rule, we have
Notice that at the ﬁnal stage we had to return to the original variable .
The idea behind the Substitution Rule is to replace a relatively complicated integral 
by a simpler integral. This is accomplished by changing from the original variable 
to 
a new variable 
that is a function of . Thus in Example 1 we replaced the integral
by the simpler integral 
.
The main challenge in using the Substitution Rule is to think of an appropriate substi-
tution. You should try to choose 
to be some function in the integrand whose differential
also occurs (except for a constant factor). This was the case in Example 1. If that is not
possible, try choosing 
to be some complicated part of the integrand (perhaps the inner
function in a composite function). Finding the right substitution is a bit of an art. It’s not
unusual to guess wrong; if your ﬁrst guess doesn’t work, try another substitution.

INTEGRALS
The answer to Example 3 could be checked by differentiation, but instead let’s check 
it with a graph. In Figure 1 we have used a computer to graph both the integrand
and its indeﬁnite integral 
(we take the case
). Notice that 
decreases when 
is negative, increases when 
is positive,
and has its minimum value when 
. So it seems reasonable, from the graphical evi-
dence, that is an antiderivative of .
Calculate 
.
SOLUTION If we let 
, then 
, so 
. Therefore
Calculate 
.
SOLUTION First we write tangent in terms of sine and cosine:
This suggests that we should substitute 
, since then 
and so
:
Since 
, the result of Example
5 can also be written as
Deﬁnite Integrals
When evaluating a deﬁnite integral by substitution, two methods are possible. One method
is to evaluate the indeﬁnite integral ﬁrst and then use the Evaluation Theorem. For
instance, using the result of Example 2, we have 
Another method, which is usually preferable, is to change the limits of integration when
the variable is changed.

symmetry. Recall that an integral 
can be expressed as the area above the -axis

minus the area below the axis and above the curve. Thus part (b) says
the integral is because the areas cancel.

Every differentiation rule has a corresponding integration rule. For instance, the Substitu-
tion Rule for integration corresponds to the Chain Rule for differentiation. The rule that
corresponds to the Product Rule for differentiation is called the rule for integration by
parts.
The Product Rule states that if 
and are differentiable functions, then
In the notation for indeﬁnite integrals this equation becomes
or
We can rearrange this equation as
Formula 1 is called the formula for integration by parts. It is perhaps easier to remem-
ber in the following notation. Let 
and 
. Then the differentials are

, so, by the Substitution Rule, the formula for integration
by parts becomes

SOLUTION USING FORMULA 2 Let
Then
and so
Note: Our aim in using integration by parts is to obtain a simpler integral than the one
we started with. Thus in Example 1 we started with 
and expressed it in terms
of the simpler integral 
. If we had instead chosen 
and 
, then
and 
, so integration by parts gives
Although this is true, 
is a more difﬁcult integral than the one we started with.
In general, when deciding on a choice for 
and 
, we usually try to choose 
to
be a function that becomes simpler when differentiated (or at least not more complicated)
as long as 
can be readily integrated to give .
Evaluate

SOLUTION Here we don’t have much choice for and 
. Let
Then
Integrating by parts, we get
Integration by parts is effective in this example because the derivative of the function
is simpler than .

Integration by parts gives
The integral that we obtained,

Putting this in Equation 3, we get
Evaluate

SOLUTION Neither

gration by parts gives
The integral that we have obtained,

at least it’s no more difﬁcult. Having had success in the preceding example integrating
by parts twice, we persevere and integrate by parts again. This time we use 
and

At ﬁrst glance, it appears as if we have accomplished nothing because we have arrived at
, which is where we started. However, if we put Equation 5 into Equation 4
we get
This can be regarded as an equation to be solved for the unknown integral. Adding
to both sides, we obtain

We have learned the two basic techniques of integration–substitution and parts–in Sec-
tions 5.5 and 5.6. Here we discuss brieﬂy methods that are special to particular classes of
functions, such as trigonometric functions and rational functions.
Trigonometric Integrals
We can use trigonometric identities to integrate certain combinations of trigonometric
functions.
An integral with an odd power of 
Evaluate

SOLUTION We would like to use the Substitution Rule, but simply substituting 
isn’t helpful, since then 
. In order to integrate powers of cosine, we
would need an extra 
factor. (Similarly, a power of sine would require an extra 
factor.) Here we separate one cosine factor and convert the remaining 
factor to an
expression involving sine using the identity 
:
We can then evaluate the integral by substituting 
, so 
and
In general, we try to write an integrand involving powers of sine and cosine in a form
where we have only one sine factor (and the remainder of the expression in terms of
cosine) or only one cosine factor (and the remainder of the expression in terms of sine).
The identity 
enables us to convert back and forth between even powers
of sine and cosine.

INTEGRALS
If the integrand contains only even powers of both sine and cosine, however, this strat-
egy fails. In this case, we can take advantage of the half-angle identities

An integral with an even power of

SOLUTION If we write 
, the integral is no simpler to evaluate. Using
the half-angle formula for

Notice that we mentally made the substitution 
when integrating 
. Another
method for evaluating this integral was given in Exercise 35 in Section 5.6.
We can use a similar strategy to integrate powers of 
using the identity
. (See Exercises 7–10.)
Trigonometric Substitution
A number of practical problems require us to integrate algebraic functions that contain an
expression of the form 
, 
, or 
. Sometimes, the best way to per-
form the integration is to make a trigonometric substitution that gets rid of the root sign.
Prove that the area of a circle with radius is 
.
SOLUTION This is, of course, a well-known formula. A long time ago you were told that
it’s true; but the only way to actually prove it is by integration.
For simplicity, let’s place the circle with its center at the origin, so its equation is
. Solving this equation for , we get
Because the circle is symmetric with respect to both axes, the total area 
is four times
the area in the ﬁrst quadrant (see Figure 2). 
The part of the circle in the ﬁrst quadrant is given by the function
and so
To simplify this integral, we would like to make a substitution that turns 
into the
square of something. The trigonometric identity 
is useful here. In
fact, because
we make the substitution

Since

and
because 
when 
. Therefore the Substitution Rule gives
This trigonometric integral is similar to the one in Example 2; we integrate 
by
means of the identity
Thus
We have therefore proved the famous formula 
.
Example 3 suggests that if an integrand contains a factor of the form 
, then a
trigonometric substitution 
may be effective. But that doesn’t mean that such a
substitution is always the best method. To evaluate 
, for instance, a simpler
substitution is 
because 
.
When an integral contains an expression of the form 
, the substitution
should be considered because the identity 
eliminates the
root sign. Similarly, if the factor 
occurs, the substitution 
is effective.
Partial Fractions
We integrate rational functions (ratios of polynomials) by expressing them as sums of sim-
pler fractions, called partial fractions, that we already know how to integrate. The follow-
ing example illustrates the simplest case.
Find

SOLUTION Notice that the denominator can be factored as a product of linear factors:
In a case like this, where the numerator has a smaller degree than the denominator, we
can write the given rational function as a sum of partial fractions:
where 
are constants. To ﬁnd the values of 
we multiply both sides of this

Solving this system of linear equations for

Each of the resulting partial fractions is easy to integrate (using the substitutions
and 
, respectively). So we have
Note 1: If the degree in the numerator in Example 4 had been the same as that of the
denominator, or higher, we would have had to take the preliminary step of performing a
long division. For instance,
Note 2: If the denominator has more than two linear factors, we need to include a term
corresponding to each factor. For example,
where 
are constants determined by solving a system of three equations in the
unknowns 
.
Note 3: If a linear factor is repeated, we need to include extra terms in the partial frac-
tion expansion. Here’s an example:
Note 4: When we factor a denominator as far as possible, it might happen that we obtain
an irreducible quadratic factor 
, where the discriminant 
is nega-
tive. Then the corresponding partial fraction is of the form
where 
are constants to be determined. This term can be integrated by completing
the square and using the formula

In this section we describe how to evaluate integrals using tables and computer algebra
systems.
Tables of Integrals
Tables of indeﬁnite integrals are very useful when we are confronted by an integral that is
difﬁcult to evaluate by hand and we don’t have access to a computer algebra system. A rela-
tively brief table of 120 integrals, categorized by form, is provided on the Reference Pages
at the back of the book. More extensive tables are available in CRC Standard Mathemati-
cal Tables and Formulae, 31st ed. by Daniel Zwillinger (Boca Raton, FL, 2002) (709 entries)
or in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik’s Table of Integrals, Series, and Products, 6e (San Diego,

2000), which contains hundreds of pages of integrals. It should be remembered, however,
that integrals do not often occur in exactly the form listed in a table. Usually we need to
use the Substitution Rule or algebraic manipulation to transform a given integral into one
of the forms in the table.
Use the Table of Integrals to evaluate 
.
SOLUTION The only formula in the table that resembles our given integral is entry 17:
If we perform long division, we get
Now we can use Formula 17 with 
:

SOLUTION If we look at the section of the table entitled Forms involving 
, 
we see that the closest entry is number 34:
This is not exactly what we have, but we will be able to use it if we ﬁrst make the substi-
tution

the entries explicitly includes a 
factor. However, we can use the reduction formula in
entry 84 with 
:
We now need to evaluate 
. We can use the reduction formula in entry 85
with

Combining these calculations, we get

but not

If we make the substitution

), the integrand will involve the
pattern 
:
The ﬁrst integral is evaluated using the substitution

For the second integral we use Formula 21 with

SECTION 5.8
INTEGRATION USING TABLES AND COMPUTER ALGEBRA SYSTEMS
397
Computer Algebra Systems
We have seen that the use of tables involves matching the form of the given integrand with
the forms of the integrands in the tables. Computers are particularly good at matching pat-
terns. And just as we used substitutions in conjunction with tables, a CAS can perform sub-
stitutions that transform a given integral into one that occurs in its stored formulas. So it
isn’t surprising that computer algebra systems excel at integration. That doesn’t mean that
integration by hand is an obsolete skill. We will see that a hand computation sometimes
produces an indeﬁnite integral in a form that is more convenient than a machine answer.
To begin, let’s see what happens when we ask a machine to integrate the relatively 
simple function 
. Using the substitution 
, an easy calculation
by hand gives
whereas Derive, Mathematica, and Maple all return the answer
The ﬁrst thing to notice is that computer algebra systems omit the constant of integra-
tion. In other words, they produce a particular antiderivative, not the most general one.
Therefore, when making use of a machine integration, we might have to add a constant.
Second, the absolute value signs are omitted in the machine answer. That is ﬁne if our
problem is concerned only with values of greater than . But if we are interested in other
values of , then we need to insert the absolute value symbol.
In the next example we reconsider the integral of Example 4, but this time we ask a
machine for the answer.
Use a computer algebra system to ﬁnd 
.
SOLUTION Maple responds with the answer
This looks different from the answer we found in Example 4, but it is equivalent because
the third term can be rewritten using the identity
Thus
The resulting extra term 
can be absorbed into the constant of integration.
Mathematica gives the answer

CHAPTER 5
INTEGRALS
Mathematica combined the ﬁrst two terms of Example 4 (and the Maple result) into a
single term by factoring.
Derive gives the answer
The ﬁrst term is like the ﬁrst term in the Mathematica answer, and the second term is
identical to the last term in Example 4.
Use a CAS to evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Maple and Mathematica give the same answer:
It’s clear that both systems must have expanded 
by the Binomial Theorem and
then integrated each term.
If we integrate by hand instead, using the substitution 
, we get
For most purposes, this is a more convenient form of the answer.
Use a CAS to ﬁnd 
.
SOLUTION Derive and Maple report the answer
whereas Mathematica produces
We suspect that there are trigonometric identities which show that these three answers
are equivalent. Indeed, if we ask Derive, Maple, and Mathematica to simplify their
expressions using trigonometric identities, they ultimately produce the same form of the
answer:
Can We Integrate All Continuous Functions?
The question arises: Will our basic integration formulas, together with the Substitution
Rule, integration by parts, tables of integrals, and computer algebra systems, enable us to
ﬁnd the integral of every continuous function? In particular, can we use these techniques
to evaluate 
? The answer is No, at least not in terms of the functions that we are
familiar with.
Most of the functions that we have been dealing with in this book are what are called
elementary functions. These are the polynomials, rational functions, power functions 
,
exponential functions 
, logarithmic functions, trigonometric and inverse trigonometric
functions, and all functions that can be obtained from these by the ﬁve operations of addi-

SECTION 5.9
APPROXIMATE INTEGRATION
401
There are two situations in which it is impossible to ﬁnd the exact value of a deﬁnite 
integral.
The ﬁrst situation arises from the fact that in order to evaluate 
using the
Evaluation Theorem we need to know an antiderivative of . Sometimes, however, it is dif-
ﬁcult, or even impossible, to ﬁnd an antiderivative (see Section 5.8). For example, it is
impossible to evaluate the following integrals exactly:
The second situation arises when the function is determined from a scientiﬁc experi-
ment through instrument readings or collected data. There may be no formula for the func-
tion (see Example 5).
In both cases we need to ﬁnd approximate values of deﬁnite integrals. We already know
one such method. Recall that the deﬁnite integral is deﬁned as a limit of Riemann sums,
so any Riemann sum could be used as an approximation to the integral: If we divide 
into subintervals of equal length 
, then we have
where 
is any point in the th subinterval 
. If 
is chosen to be the left endpoint
of the interval, then

The reason for the name Trapezoidal Rule can be seen from Figure 2, which illustrates

In general, we have
The following tables show the results of calculations similar to those in Example 1, but
for 
, and 
and for the left and right endpoint approximations as well as the
Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules.
We can make several observations from these tables:
1. In all of the methods we get more accurate approximations when we increase the
value of . (But very large values of result in so many arithmetic operations that
we have to beware of accumulated round-off error.)
2. The errors in the left and right endpoint approximations are opposite in sign and
appear to decrease by a factor of about 2 when we double the value of .
3. The Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules are much more accurate than the endpoint
approximations.
4. The errors in the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules are opposite in sign and appear
to decrease by a factor of about 4 when we double the value of .
5. The size of the error in the Midpoint Rule is about half the size of the error in the
Trapezoidal Rule.
Figure 5 shows why we can usually expect the Midpoint Rule to be more accurate than
the Trapezoidal Rule. The area of a typical rectangle in the Midpoint Rule is the same as
the area of the trapezoid 
whose upper side is tangent to the graph at . The area of
this trapezoid is closer to the area under the graph than is the area of the trapezoid 
used in the Trapezoidal Rule. [The midpoint error (shaded red) is smaller than the trape-
zoidal error (shaded blue).]

These observations are corroborated in the following error estimates, which are proved
in books on numerical analysis. Notice that Observation 4 corresponds to the 
in each
denominator because 
. The fact that the estimates depend on the size of the
second derivative is not surprising if you look at Figure 5, because 
measures how
much the graph is curved. [Recall that 
measures how fast the slope of

Error Bounds Suppose 
for

and 
are the errors
in the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules, then
Let’s apply this error estimate to the Trapezoidal Rule approximation in Example 1. If
, then 
and 
. Since 
, we have 
, so
Therefore, taking 
, and 
in the error estimate (3), we see that
Comparing this error estimate of 
with the actual error of about 
, we see
that it can happen that the actual error is substantially less than the upper bound for the
error given by (3).
How large should we take in order to guarantee that the Trapezoidal
and Midpoint Rule approximations for 
are accurate to within 
?
SOLUTION We saw in the preceding calculation that

can take

means that the size
of the error should be less than

Another rule for approximate integration results from using parabolas instead of straight
line segments to approximate a curve. As before, we divide 
into 
subintervals of
equal length

on each consecutive pair of intervals we approximate the curve

and so the area under the parabola from

But, since the parabola passes through

, and 
, we have
and therefore
Thus we can rewrite the area under the parabola as
Now, by shifting this parabola horizontally we do not change the area under it. This means
that the area under the parabola through

from

is still
Similarly, the area under the parabola through 
from

If we compute the areas under all the parabolas in this manner and add the results, we get

SOLUTION Putting

in Simpson’s Rule, we obtain
Notice that, in Example 4, Simpson’s Rule gives us a much better approximation
to the true value of the integral 
than does the
Trapezoidal Rule 
or the Midpoint Rule 
. It turns out
(see Exercise 42) that the approximations in Simpson’s Rule are weighted averages of
those in the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules:
(Recall that 
and 
usually have opposite signs and 
is about half the size of

In many applications of calculus we need to evaluate an integral even if no explicit for-
mula is known for y as a function of x. A function may be given graphically or as a table
of values of collected data. If there is evidence that the values are not changing rapidly,
then the Trapezoidal Rule or Simpson’s Rule can still be used to ﬁnd an approximate value
for 
, the integral of y with respect to x.

Simpson
Thomas Simpson was a weaver who taught 
himself mathematics and went on to become
one of the best English mathematicians of the
18th century. What we call Simpson’s Rule was 
actually known to Cavalieri and Gregory in the
17th century, but Simpson popularized it in his
best-selling calculus textbook, A New Treatise 
of Fluxions.

SECTION 5.9

SOLUTION Because we want the units to be consistent and 
is measured in megabits 
per second, we convert the units for from hours to seconds. If we let 
be the 
amount of data (in megabits) transmitted by time , where is measured in seconds, then
. So, by the Net Change Theorem (see Section 5.3), the total amount of data
transmitted by noon (when 
) is
We estimate the values of 
at hourly intervals from the graph and compile them in
the table.
Then we use Simpson’s Rule with 
and 
to estimate the integral:
Thus the total amount of data transmitted from midnight to noon is about 144,000 mega-
bits, or 144 gigabits.
The table in the margin shows how Simpson’s Rule compares with the Midpoint Rule
for the integral 
, whose true value is about 0.69314718. The second table shows
how the error 
in Simpson’s Rule decreases by a factor of about 16 when 
is doubled.
(In Exercises 25 and 26 you are asked to verify this for two additional integrals.) That is
consistent with the appearance of 
in the denominator of the following error estimate for
Simpson’s Rule. It is similar to the estimates given in (3) for the Trapezoidal and Midpoint
Rules, but it uses the fourth derivative of .

and so
Therefore we can take

Therefore 
( must be even) gives the desired accuracy. (Compare this with 
Example 2, where we obtained 
for the Trapezoidal Rule and 
for the
Midpoint Rule.) 
Estimating the error in using Simpson’s Rule
(a) Use Simpson’s Rule with

.
(b) Estimate the error involved in this approximation.
SOLUTION
(a) If

in (4), we see that the error is at
most
(Compare this with Example 3.) Thus, correct to three decimal places, we have

EXAMPLE 6
Many calculators and computer algebra sys-
tems have a built-in algorithm that computes an
approximation of a deﬁnite integral. Some of
these machines use Simpson’s Rule; others use
more sophisticated techniques such as adaptive
numerical integration. This means that if a func-
tion ﬂuctuates much more on a certain part of
the interval than it does elsewhere, then that
part gets divided into more subintervals. This
strategy reduces the number of calculations
required to achieve a prescribed accuracy.
Figure 10 illustrates the calculation in
Example 7. Notice that the parabolic arcs are 
so close to the graph of 
that they are
practically indistinguishable from it.

In deﬁning a deﬁnite integral 
we dealt with a function deﬁned on a ﬁnite inter-
val 
and we assumed that 
does not have an inﬁnite discontinuity (see Section 5.2).
In this section we extend the concept of a deﬁnite integral to the case where the interval is
inﬁnite and also to the case where 
has an inﬁnite discontinuity in 
. In either case
the integral is called an improper integral. One of the most important applications of this
idea, probability distributions, will be studied in Section 6.8.

5.10 Improper Integrals

Type 1: Inﬁnite Intervals
Consider the inﬁnite region 
that lies under the curve 
, above the -axis, and to
the right of the line 
. You might think that, since 
is inﬁnite in extent, its area must
be inﬁnite, but let’s take a closer look. The area of the part of 
that lies to the left of the
line 
(shaded in Figure 1) is
Notice that 
no matter how large is chosen.
We also observe that
The area of the shaded region approaches as 
(see Figure 2), so we say that the area
of the inﬁnite region 
is equal to and we write
Using this example as a guide, we deﬁne the integral of 
(not necessarily a positive
function) over an inﬁnite interval as the limit of integrals over ﬁnite intervals.
Deﬁnition of an Improper Integral of Type 1
(a) If 
exists for every number 
, then
provided this limit exists (as a ﬁnite number).
(b) If 
exists for every number 
, then
provided this limit exists (as a ﬁnite number).
The improper integrals 
and 
are called convergent if the
corresponding limit exists and divergent if the limit does not exist.
(c) If both 
and 
are convergent, then we deﬁne
In part (c) any real number can be used (see Exercise 54).

Any of the improper integrals in Deﬁnition 1 can be interpreted as an area provided that
is a positive function. For instance, in case (a) if 
and the integral 
is convergent, then we deﬁne the area of the region 
in
Figure 3 to be
This is appropriate because 
is the limit as 
of the area under the graph of
from to .
Determine whether the integral 
is convergent or divergent.
SOLUTION According to part (a) of Deﬁnition 1, we have
The limit does not exist as a ﬁnite number and so the improper integral 
is
divergent.
Let’s compare the result of Example 1 with the example given at the beginning of this 
section:
Geometrically, this says that although the curves 
and 
look very similar
for 
, the region under 
to the right of 
(the shaded region in Figure 4)
has ﬁnite area whereas the corresponding region under 
(in Figure 5) has inﬁnite
area. Note that both 
and 
approach 
as 
but 
approaches 
faster than
. The values of 1	x don’t decrease fast enough for its integral to have a ﬁnite value.

Since 
, the given improper integral can be interpreted as the area of 
the inﬁnite region that lies under the curve 
and above the -axis (see
Figure 6). 
For what values of 
is the integral
convergent?
SOLUTION We know from Example 1 that if 
, then the integral is divergent, so let’s
assume that 
. Then
If 
, then 
, so as 
,
and 
. Therefore
and so the integral converges. But if 
, then 
and so
and the integral diverges.
We summarize the result of Example 4 for future reference:
Type 2: Discontinuous Integrands
Suppose that 
is a positive continuous function deﬁned on a ﬁnite interval 
but has
a vertical asymptote at . Let 
be the unbounded region under the graph of 
and above 
the -axis between 
and . (For Type 1 integrals, the regions extended indeﬁnitely in a 
horizontal direction. Here the region is inﬁnite in a vertical direction.) The area of the part
of 
between and (the shaded region in Figure 7) is
If it happens that 
approaches a deﬁnite number 
as 
, then we say that the
area of the region 
is 
and we write
We use this equation to deﬁne an improper integral of Type 2 even when 
is not a posi-
tive function, no matter what type of discontinuity

Deﬁnition of an Improper Integral of Type 2
(a) If 
is continuous on 
and is discontinuous at , then 
if this limit exists (as a ﬁnite number).
(b) If 
is continuous on 
and is discontinuous at , then 
if this limit exists (as a ﬁnite number).
The improper integral 
is called convergent if the corresponding limit
exists and divergent if the limit does not exist.
(c) If 
has a discontinuity at , where 
, and both 
and
are convergent, then we deﬁne
Integrating a function with a vertical asymptote
Find 
.
SOLUTION We note ﬁrst that the given integral is improper because 
has the vertical asymptote 
. Since the inﬁnite discontinuity occurs at the left end-
point of 
, we use part (b) of Deﬁnition 3:
Thus the given improper integral is convergent and, since the integrand is positive, we
can interpret the value of the integral as the area of the shaded region in Figure 10.
Determine whether 
converges or diverges.
SOLUTION Note that the given integral is improper because 
. Using
part (a) of Deﬁnition 3 and Formula 14 from the Table of Integrals, we have
because 
and 
as 
. Thus the given improper integral is
divergent.

SOLUTION Observe that the line

occurs in the middle of the interval

Warning: If we had not noticed the asymptote 
in Example 7 and had instead 
confused the integral with an ordinary integral, then we might have made the following
erroneous calculation:
This is wrong because the integral is improper and must be calculated in terms of limits.
From now on, whenever you meet the symbol 
you must decide, by look-
ing at the function 
on 
, whether it is an ordinary deﬁnite integral or an improper 
integral.
Using l’Hospital’s Rule with an improper integral
Evaluate

SOLUTION We know that the function 
has a vertical asymptote at 0 since
. Thus the given integral is improper and we have
Now we integrate by parts with

A Comparison Test for Improper Integrals
Sometimes it is impossible to ﬁnd the exact value of an improper integral and yet it is
important to know whether it is convergent or divergent. In such cases the following theo-
rem is useful. Although we state it for Type 1 integrals, a similar theorem is true for Type 2
integrals.
Comparison Theorem Suppose that 
and are continuous functions with
for 
.
(a) If 
is convergent, then 
is convergent.
(b) If 
is divergent, then 
is divergent.
We omit the proof of the Comparison Theorem, but Figure 12 makes it seem plausible.
If the area under the top curve 
is ﬁnite, then so is the area under the bottom curve
. And if the area under 
is inﬁnite, then so is the area under 
.
[Note that the reverse is not necessarily true: If 
is convergent, 
may 
or may not be convergent, and if 
is divergent, 
may or may not be
divergent.]
Show that 
is convergent.
SOLUTION We can’t evaluate the integral directly because the antiderivative of 
is not
an elementary function (as explained in Section 5.8). We write
and observe that the ﬁrst integral on the right-hand side is just an ordinary deﬁnite inte-
gral. In the second integral we use the fact that for 
we have 
, so 
and therefore 
. (See Figure 13.) The integral of 
is easy to evaluate:
Thus, taking 
and 
in the Comparison Theorem, we see that
is convergent. It follows that 
is convergent.
In Example 9 we showed that 
is convergent without computing its value. In
Exercise 60 we indicate how to show that its value is approximately 0.8862. In probabil-
ity theory it is important to know the exact value of this improper integral, as we will see
in Section 6.8; using the methods of multivariable calculus it can be shown that the exact
value is 
. Table 1 illustrates the deﬁnition of an improper integral by showing how
the (computer-generated) values of 
approach 
as t becomes large. In fact,
these values converge quite quickly because 
very rapidly as

Focus on Problem Solving
Before you look at the solution of the following example, cover it up and ﬁrst try to solve
the problem yourself.
Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Let’s start by having a preliminary look at the ingredients of the function.
What happens to the ﬁrst factor, 
, when approaches ? The numerator
approaches and the denominator approaches , so we have
and
The second factor approaches 
, which is . It’s not clear what happens to
the function as a whole. (One factor is becoming large while the other is becoming
small.) So how do we proceed?
One of the principles of problem solving is recognizing something familiar. Is there a
part of the function that reminds us of something we’ve seen before? Well, the integral
has as its upper limit of integration and that type of integral occurs in Part 1 of the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:
This suggests that differentiation might be involved.
Once we start thinking about differentiation, the denominator 
reminds us of
something else that should be familiar: One of the forms of the deﬁnition of the deriva-
tive in Chapter 2 is
and with 
this becomes
So what is the function 
in our situation? Notice that if we deﬁne
then 
. What about the factor in the numerator? That’s just a red herring, so
let’s factor it out and put together the calculation:

Applications of Integration
In this chapter we explore some of the applications of the deﬁnite integral by
using it to compute areas between curves, volumes of solids, lengths of curves,
the average value of a function, the work done by a varying force, the center of
gravity of a plate, the force on a dam, as well as quantities of interest in biology,
economics, and statistics. The common theme in most of these applications is
the following general method, which is similar to the one we used to ﬁnd areas
under curves: We break up a quantity 
into a large number of small parts. We
next approximate each small part by a quantity of the form 
and thus
approximate 
by a Riemann sum. Then we take the limit and express 
as an
integral. Finally we evaluate the integral by using the Evaluation Theorem, or
Simpson’s Rule, or technology.

CHAPTER 6
APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION
In Chapter 5 we deﬁned and calculated areas of regions that lie under the graphs of func-
tions. Here we use integrals to ﬁnd areas of more general regions. First we consider regions
that lie between the graphs of two functions. Then we look at regions enclosed by para-
metric curves.
Areas Between Curves
Consider the region 
that lies between two curves 
and 
and be-
tween the vertical lines 
and 
, where 
and 
are continuous functions and
for all in 
. (See Figure 1.)
Just as we did for areas under curves in Section 5.1, we divide S into n strips of equal
width and then we approximate the ith strip by a rectangle with base 
and height
. (See Figure 2. If we like, we could take all of the sample points to be right
endpoints, in which case 
.) The Riemann sum
is therefore an approximation to what we intuitively think of as the area of S.
This approximation appears to become better and better as 
. Therefore we deﬁne
the area
of the region 
as the limiting value of the sum of the areas of these approxi-
mating rectangles.
We recognize the limit in (1) as the deﬁnite integral of 
. Therefore we have the
following formula for area.
The area A of the region bounded by the curves 
, and the
lines 
, 
, where 
and are continuous and 
for all in 
, is

Notice that in the special case where 
, 
is the region under the graph of 
and our general deﬁnition of area (1) reduces to our previous deﬁnition (Deﬁnition 2 in
Section 5.1).
In the case where both 
and are positive, you can see from Figure 3 why (2) is true: 
Area between two curves
Find the area of the region bounded above by
, bounded below by 
, and bounded on the sides by 
and 
.
SOLUTION The region is shown in Figure 4. The upper boundary curve is 
and the
lower boundary curve is y  x. So we use the area formula (2) with 
, 
,
and 
:
In Figure 4 we drew a typical approximating rectangle with width 
as a reminder of
the procedure by which the area is deﬁned in (1). In general, when we set up an integral
for an area, it’s helpful to sketch the region to identify the top curve 
, the bottom curve
, and a typical approximating rectangle as in Figure 5. Then the area of a typical rect-
angle is 
and the equation
summarizes the procedure of adding (in a limiting sense) the areas of all the typical 
rectangles.
Notice that in Figure 5 the left-hand boundary reduces to a point, whereas in Figure 3
the right-hand boundary reduces to a point. In the next example both of the side bound-
aries reduce to a point, so the ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd a and b.
Find the area of the region enclosed by the parabolas 
and
.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst ﬁnd the points of intersection of the parabolas by solving their equa-
tions simultaneously. This gives

. Thus

We see from Figure 6 that the top and bottom boundaries are

CHAPTER 6
APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION
Sometimes it’s difﬁcult, or even impossible, to ﬁnd the points of intersection of two
curves exactly. As shown in the following example, we can use a graphing calculator or
computer to ﬁnd approximate values for the intersection points and then proceed as before.
Find the approximate area of the region bounded by the curves
and 
SOLUTION If we were to try to ﬁnd the exact intersection points, we would have to solve
the equation
This looks like a very difﬁcult equation to solve exactly (in fact, it’s impossible), so
instead we use a graphing device to draw the graphs of the two curves in Figure 7. One
intersection point is the origin. We zoom in toward the other point of intersection and
ﬁnd that 
. (If greater accuracy is required, we could use Newton’s method or a
rootﬁnder, if available on our graphing device.) Thus an approximation to the area
between the curves is
To integrate the ﬁrst term we use the subsitution 
. Then 
, and
when 
. So
Interpreting the area between velocity curves
Figure 8 shows velocity curves
for two cars, A and B, that start side by side and move along the same road. What does
the area between the curves represent? Use Simpson’s Rule to estimate it.
SOLUTION We know from Section 5.3 that the area under the velocity curve A represents
the distance traveled by car A during the ﬁrst 16 seconds. Similarly, the area under curve
B is the distance traveled by car B during that time period. So the area between these
curves, which is the difference of the areas under the curves, is the distance between the
cars after 16 seconds. We read the velocities from the graph and convert them to feet per
second

Using Simpson’s Rule with 
intervals, so that 
, we estimate the distance
between the cars after 16 seconds: 
Some regions are best treated by regarding x as a function of y. If a region is bounded
by curves with equations 
, 
, 
, and 
, where 
and are contin-
uous and 
for 
(see Figure 9), then its area is
If we write 
for the right boundary and 
for the left boundary, then, as Figure 10
illustrates, we have
Here a typical approximating rectangle has dimensions 
and 
.
Integrating with respect to is sometimes easier
Find the area enclosed by the line 
and the parabola 
.
SOLUTION By solving the two equations we ﬁnd that the points of intersection are
and 
. We solve the equation of the parabola for x and notice from
Figure 11 that the left and right boundary curves are
and
We must integrate between the appropriate -values, 
and 
. Thus
Note: We could have found the area in Example 5 by integrating with respect to x
instead of y, but the calculation is much more involved. It would have meant splitting the
region in two and computing the areas labeled 
and 
in Figure 12. The method we used
in Example 5 is much easier.
Areas Enclosed by Parametric Curves
We know that the area under a curve 
from

The result of Example 6 says that the area
under one arch of the cycloid is three times the
area of the rolling circle that generates the
cycloid (see Example 7 in Section 1.7). Galileo
guessed this result but it was ﬁrst proved by
the French mathematician Roberval and the
Italian mathematician Torricelli.

In trying to ﬁnd the volume of a solid we face the same type of problem as in ﬁnding areas.
We have an intuitive idea of what volume means, but we must make this idea precise by
using calculus to give an exact deﬁnition of volume.
We start with a simple type of solid called a cylinder (or, more precisely, a right cylin-
der). As illustrated in Figure 1(a), a cylinder is bounded by a plane region 
, called the
base, and a congruent region 
in a parallel plane. The cylinder consists of all points on
line segments that are perpendicular to the base and join 
to 
. If the area of the base is
and the height of the cylinder (the distance from 
to 
) is , then the volume 
of the
cylinder is deﬁned as
In particular, if the base is a circle with radius , then the cylinder is a circular cylinder with
volume 
[see Figure 1(b)], and if the base is a rectangle with length and width
, then the cylinder is a rectangular box (also called a rectangular parallelepiped) with
volume 
[see Figure 1(c)].
For a solid S that isn’t a cylinder we ﬁrst “cut” S into pieces and approximate each piece
by a cylinder. We estimate the volume of S by adding the volumes of the cylinders. We
arrive at the exact volume of S through a limiting process in which the number of pieces
becomes large.
We start by intersecting S with a plane and obtaining a plane region that is called a
cross-section of 
Let 
be the area of the cross-section of 
in a plane 
perpen-
dicular to the -axis and passing through the point , where 
. (See Figure 2.
Think of slicing with a knife through and computing the area of this slice.) The cross-
sectional area

Let’s divide S into n “slabs” of equal width 
by using the planes 
, 
, . . . to slice
the solid. (Think of slicing a loaf of bread.) If we choose sample points 
in 
, we
can approximate the th slab 
(the part of 
that lies between the planes 
and 
) by
a cylinder with base area 
and “height” 
. (See Figure 3.)
FIGURE 3
The volume of this cylinder is 
, so an approximation to our intuitive concep-
tion of the volume of the th slab 
is 
Adding the volumes of these slabs, we get an approximation to the total volume (that is,
what we think of intuitively as the volume): 
This approximation appears to become better and better as 
. (Think of the slices as
becoming thinner and thinner.) Therefore we deﬁne the volume as the limit of these sums
as 
. But we recognize the limit of Riemann sums as a deﬁnite integral and so we
have the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition of Volume Let 
be a solid that lies between 
and

cross-sectional area of

CHAPTER 6
APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION
When we use the volume formula 
, it is important to remember that 
is the area of a moving cross-section obtained by slicing through 
perpendicular to
the -axis.
Notice that, for a cylinder, the cross-sectional area is constant: 
for all . So our
deﬁnition of volume gives 
; this agrees with the formula 
Show that the volume of a sphere of radius is 
.
SOLUTION If we place the sphere so that its center is at the origin (see Figure 4), then the
plane 
intersects the sphere in a circle whose radius (from the Pythagorean Theorem)
is 
. So the cross-sectional area is
Using the deﬁnition of volume with 
and 
, we have
(The integrand is even.)
Figure 5 illustrates the deﬁnition of volume when the solid is a sphere with radius 
. From the result of Example 1, we know that the volume of the sphere is 
, which
is approximately 
. Here the slabs are circular cylinders, or disks, and the three parts
of Figure 5 show the geometric interpretations of the Riemann sums
when n  5, 10, and 20 if we choose the sample points 
to be the midpoints . Notice
that as we increase the number of approximating cylinders, the corresponding Riemann
sums become closer to the true volume.
Using the disk method
Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating
about the x-axis the region under the curve

of volume by sketching a typical approximating cylinder.

SOLUTION The region is shown in Figure 6(a). If we rotate about the x-axis, we get the
solid shown in Figure 6(b). When we slice through the point x, we get a disk with radius
. The area of this cross-section is
and the volume of the approximating cylinder (a disk with thickness 
) is
The solid lies between 
and 
, so its volume is
Did we get a reasonable answer in Example 2? As a check on our work, let’s replace
the given region by a square with base 
and height . If we rotate this square, we get
a cylinder with radius 1, height 1, and volume 
. We computed that the given
solid has half this volume. That seems about right.
Rotating about the -axis
Find the volume of the solid obtained by 
rotating the region bounded by 
, 
, and 
about the -axis.
SOLUTION The region is shown in Figure 7(a) and the resulting solid is shown in
Figure 7(b). Because the region is rotated about the y-axis, it makes sense to slice the
solid perpendicular to the y-axis and therefore to integrate with respect to y. If we slice
at height y, we get a circular disk with radius x, where 
. So the area of a cross-
section through y is
and the volume of the approximating cylinder pictured in Figure 7(b) is
Since the solid lies between

region between them, the solid of rotation, and a cross-section perpendicular to the

has the shape of a washer

Therefore we have

The solids in Examples 1–5 are all called solids of revolution because they are obtained
by revolving a region about a line. In general, we calculate the volume of a solid of revo-
lution by using the basic deﬁning formula

N If the cross-section is a disk (as in Examples 1–3), we ﬁnd the radius of the disk

Find the volume of the solid obtained by 
rotating the region in Example 4 about the line

We now ﬁnd the volumes of two solids that are not solids of revolution.
Triangular cross-sections
Figure 12 shows a solid with a circular base of
radius 1. Parallel cross-sections perpendicular to the base are equilateral triangles. Find
the volume of the solid.
SOLUTION Let’s take the circle to be 
. The solid, its base, and a typical cross-
section at a distance from the origin are shown in Figure 13.
Since 
lies on the circle, we have 
and so the base of the triangle
is

Find the volume of a pyramid whose base is a square with side

SOLUTION We place the origin 
at the vertex of the pyramid and the -axis along its
central axis as in Figure 14. Any plane 
that passes through and is perpendicular to
the -axis intersects the pyramid in a square with side of length , say. We can express

has slope

so its equation is

The pyramid lies between

Note: We didn’t need to place the vertex of the pyramid at the origin in Example 8. We
did so merely to make the equations simple. If, instead, we had placed the center of the
base at the origin and the vertex on the positive -axis, as in Figure 16, you can verify that
we would have obtained the integral

DISCOVERY PROJECT
Rotating on a Slant
We know how to ﬁnd the volume of a solid of revolution obtained by rotating a region about a
horizontal or vertical line (see Section 6.2). But what if we rotate about a slanted line, that is, a
line that is neither horizontal nor vertical? In this project you are asked to discover a formula for
the volume of a solid of revolution when the axis of rotation is a slanted line.
Let 
be the arc of the curve 
between the points 
and 
and let 
be the region bounded by , by the line 
(which lies entirely below ), and by the
perpendiculars to the line from 
and .

VOLUMES BY CYLINDRICAL SHELLS

Some volume problems are very difﬁcult to handle by the methods of the preceding sec-
tion. For instance, let’s consider the problem of ﬁnding the volume of the solid obtained
by rotating about the -axis the region bounded by 
and 
. (See Figure 1.)
If we slice perpendicular to the y-axis, we get a washer. But to compute the inner radius
and the outer radius of the washer, we’d have to solve the cubic equation 
for
x in terms of y; that’s not easy.
Fortunately, there is a method, called the method of cylindrical shells, that is easier to
use in such a case. Figure 2 shows a cylindrical shell with inner radius , outer radius ,
and height . Its volume 
is calculated by subtracting the volume 
of the inner cylinder

from the volume

If we let 
(the thickness of the shell) and 
(the average radius
of the shell), then this formula for the volume of a cylindrical shell becomes
and it can be remembered as
Now let 
be the solid obtained by rotating about the -axis the region bounded by

and 
, where 
. (See Figure 3.)
We divide the interval 
into n subintervals 
of equal width 
and let 
be
the midpoint of the ith subinterval. If the rectangle with base 
and height 
is
rotated about the y-axis, then the result is a cylindrical shell with average radius , height
, and thickness 
(see Figure 4), so by Formula 1 its volume is
Therefore an approximation to the volume 
of

these shells:

This approximation appears to become better as 
. But, from the deﬁnition of an inte-
gral, we know that
Thus the following appears plausible:
The volume of the solid in Figure 3, obtained by rotating about the y-axis the
region under the curve 
from a to b, is
The best way to remember Formula 2 is to think of a typical shell, cut and ﬂattened as
in Figure 5, with radius x, circumference 
, height 
, and thickness 
or 
:
This type of reasoning will be helpful in other situations, such as when we rotate about
lines other than the y-axis.
Using the shell method
Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating
about the -axis the region bounded by 
and 
.
SOLUTION From the sketch in Figure 6 we see that a typical shell has radius x, circumfer-
ence 
, and height 
. So, by the shell method, the volume is
It can be veriﬁed that the shell method gives the same answer as slicing.

APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION
Note: Comparing the solution of Example 1 with the remarks at the beginning of this
section, we see that the method of cylindrical shells is much easier than the washer method
for this problem. We did not have to ﬁnd the coordinates of the local maximum and we did
not have to solve the equation of the curve for in terms of . However, in other examples
the methods of the preceding section may be easier.
Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the -axis the
region between 
and 
.
SOLUTION The region and a typical shell are shown in Figure 8. We see that the shell has
radius x, circumference 
, and height 
. So the volume is
As the following example shows, the shell method works just as well if we rotate about
the x-axis. We simply have to draw a diagram to identify the radius and height of a shell.
Using shells for rotation about the -axis
Use cylindrical shells to ﬁnd the
volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the -axis the region under the curve
from 0 to 1.
SOLUTION This problem was solved using disks in Example 2 in Section 6.2. To use
shells we relabel the curve 
(in the ﬁgure in that example) as 
in Figure 9.
For rotation about the x-axis we see that a typical shell has radius y, circumference 
,
and height 
. So the volume is
In this problem the disk method was simpler.

SECTION 6.4
ARC LENGTH
455
What do we mean by the length of a curve? We might think of ﬁtting a piece of string to
the curve in Figure 1 and then measuring the string against a ruler. But that might be dif-
ﬁcult to do with much accuracy if we have a complicated curve. We need a precise deﬁni-
tion for the length of an arc of a curve, in the same spirit as the deﬁnitions we developed
for the concepts of area and volume.
If the curve is a polygon, we can easily ﬁnd its length; we just add the lengths of the
line segments that form the polygon. (We can use the distance formula to ﬁnd the distance
between the endpoints of each segment.) We are going to deﬁne the length of a general
curve by ﬁrst approximating it by a polygon and then taking a limit as the number of seg-
ments of the polygon is increased. This process is familiar for the case of a circle, where
the circumference is the limit of lengths of inscribed polygons (see Figure 2).
Suppose that a curve 
is described by the parametric equations
Let’s assume that 
is smooth in the sense that the derivatives 
and 
are continu-
ous and not simultaneously zero for 
. (This ensures that 
has no sudden change
in direction.) We divide the parameter interval 
into subintervals of equal width 
.
If , , , . . . , 
are the endpoints of these subintervals, then 
and 
are
the coordinates of points 
that lie on 
and the polygon with vertices 
,
, . . . ,
approximates . (See Figure 3.) The length L of 
is approximately the length of this
polygon and the approximation gets better as we let n increase. (See Figure 4, where the
arc of the curve between 
and 
has been magniﬁed and approximations with succes-
sively smaller values of 
are shown.) Therefore we deﬁne the length of 
to be the limit
of the lengths of these inscribed polygons:
Notice that the procedure for deﬁning arc length is very similar to the procedure we
used for deﬁning area and volume: We divided the curve into a large number of small parts.
We then found the approximate lengths of the small parts and added them. Finally, we took
the limit as 
.
For computational purposes we need a more convenient expression for . If we let
and 
, then the length of the th line segment of the polygon
is
But from the deﬁnition of a derivative we know that

In fact, our reasoning can be made precise; this formula is correct, provided that we rule

Because of the presence of the root sign in Formulas 1, 2, and 3, the calculation of an
arc length often leads to an integral that is very difﬁcult or even impossible to evaluate
explicitly. Thus we often have to be content with ﬁnding an approximation to the length of
a curve as in the following example.
Approximating a length with Simpson’s Rule
Estimate the length of the

The result of Example 4 says that the length of
one arch of a cycloid is eight times the radius 
of the generating circle (see Figure 7). This was
ﬁrst proved in 1658 by Sir Christopher Wren, who
later became the architect of St. Paul’s Cathedral
in London.

ture readings are possible? Figure 1 shows the graph of a temperature function 
, where
is measured in hours and 
in C, and a guess at the average temperature, 
.
In general, let’s try to compute the average value of a function
,
We start by dividing the interval 
into 
equal subintervals, each with length
. Then we choose points 
, . . . , 
in successive subintervals and calcu-
late the average of the numbers 
, . . . , 
:
(For example, if 
represents a temperature function and 
, this means that we take
temperature readings every hour and then average them.) Since 
, we can
write 
and the average value becomes
If we let increase, we would be computing the average value of a large number of closely
spaced values. (For example, we would be averaging temperature readings taken every
minute or even every second.) The limiting value is
by the deﬁnition of a deﬁnite integral.
Therefore we deﬁne the average value of f on the interval 
as
Find the average value of the function

SOLUTION With

If 
is the temperature at time , we might wonder if there is a speciﬁc time when the
temperature is the same as the average temperature. For the temperature function graphed
in Figure 1, we see that there are two such times––just before noon and just before mid-
night. In general, is there a number at which the value of a function 
is exactly equal to
the average value of the function, that is, 
? The following theorem says that this
is indeed the case for continuous functions.

The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals is a consequence of the Mean Value Theorem
for derivatives and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The proof is outlined in Exer-
cise 21.
The geometric interpretation of the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals is that, for posi-
tive functions , there is a number such that the rectangle with base 
and height 
has the same area as the region under the graph of 
from 
to . (See Figure 2 and the
more picturesque interpretation in the margin note.)
Finding the value of in the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals
Since

, the Mean Value Theorem for
Integrals says there is a number in 
such that
In this particular case we can ﬁnd explicitly. From Example 1 we know that

so the value of c satisﬁes
Therefore
So in this case there happen to be two numbers 
in the interval 
that work

is inclined at an angle of 
above the horizontal and the distance up the incline that you sit
is . The theater has 21 rows of seats, so 
. Suppose you decide that the best place to 
sit is in the row where the angle subtended by the screen at your eyes is a maximum. Let’s also
suppose that your eyes are 4 ft above the ﬂoor, as shown in the ﬁgure. (In Exercise 58 in Sec-

Among the many applications of integral calculus to physics and engineering, we consider
three: work, force due to water pressure, and centers of mass. As with our previous appli-
cations to geometry (areas, volumes, and lengths), our strategy is to break up the physical
quantity into a large number of small parts, approximate each small part, add the results,
take the limit, and evaluate the resulting integral.
Work
The term work is used in everyday language to mean the total amount of effort required 
to perform a task. In physics it has a technical meaning that depends on the idea of a 
force. Intuitively, you can think of a force as describing a push or pull on an object—for
example, a horizontal push of a book across a table or the downward pull of the earth’s
gravity on a ball. In general, if an object moves along a straight line with position function
, then the force F on the object (in the same direction) is deﬁned by Newton’s Second
Law of Motion as the product of its mass 
and its acceleration:
In the SI metric system, the mass is measured in kilograms (kg), the displacement in
meters (m), the time in seconds (s), and the force in newtons (
). Thus a force

of 1 N acting on a mass of 1 kg produces an acceleration of 1 ms . In the US Customary
system the fundamental unit is chosen to be the unit of force, which is the pound.
In the case of constant acceleration, the force 
is also constant and the work done is
deﬁned to be the product of the force 
and the distance 
that the object moves:
If 
is measured in newtons and in meters, then the unit for 
is a newton-meter, which
is called a joule (J). If 
is measured in pounds and in feet, then the unit for 
is a foot-
pound (ft-lb), which is about 1.36 J.
For instance, suppose you lift a 1.2-kg book off the ﬂoor to put it on a desk that is 0.7 m
high. The force you exert is equal and opposite to that exerted by gravity, so Equation 1
gives
and then Equation 2 gives the work done as
But if a 20-lb weight is lifted 6 ft off the ground, then the force is given as 
lb, so
the work done is
Here we didn’t multiply by because we were given the weight (a force) and not the mass.
Equation 2 deﬁnes work as long as the force is constant, but what happens if the force
is variable? Let’s suppose that the object moves along the -axis in the positive direction,
from 
to 
, and at each point between and a force 
acts on the object,
where is a continuous function. We divide the interval 
into n subintervals with end-
points 
and equal width 
. We choose a sample point 
in the th subinter-
val 
. Then the force at that point is 
. If is large, then 
is small, and since
is continuous, the values of don’t change very much over the interval 
. In other
words, 
is almost constant on the interval and so the work 
that is done in moving the
particle from 
to 
is approximately given by Equation 2:
Thus we can approximate the total work by
It seems that this approximation becomes better as we make larger. Therefore we deﬁne
the work done in moving the object from a to b as the limit of this quantity as 
.
Since the right side of (3) is a Riemann sum, we recognize its limit as being a deﬁnite inte-
gral and so

Work done by a variable force
When a particle is located a distance feet
from the origin, a force of 
pounds acts on it. How much work is done in moving
it from 
to 
?
SOLUTION
The work done is 
ft-lb.
In the next example we use a law from physics: Hooke’s Law states that the force
required to maintain a spring stretched 
units beyond its natural length is proportional 
to :
where 
is a positive constant (called the spring constant). Hooke’s Law holds provided
that is not too large (see Figure 1).
Work needed to stretch a spring
A force of 40 N is required to hold a
spring that has been stretched from its natural length of 10 cm to a length of 15 cm. How
much work is done in stretching the spring from 15 cm to 18 cm?
SOLUTION According to Hooke’s Law, the force required to hold the spring stretched 
meters beyond its natural length is 
. When the spring is stretched from 10 cm
to 15 cm, the amount stretched is 
cm
m. This means that 
so
Thus
and the work done in stretching the spring from 15 cm to 18 cm is
Work needed to lift a cable
A 200-lb cable is 100 ft long and hangs verti-
cally from the top of a tall building. How much work is required to lift the cable to the
top of the building?
SOLUTION Here we don’t have a formula for the force function, but we can use an argu-
ment similar to the one that led to Deﬁnition 4.
Let’s place the origin at the top of the building and the -axis pointing downward as
in Figure 2. We divide the cable into small parts with length 
. If 
is a point in the
such interval, then all points in the interval are lifted by approximately the same
amount, namely 
. The cable weighs 2 pounds per foot, so the weight of the 
part is
. Thus the work done on the 
part, in foot-pounds, is 
We get the total work done by adding all these approximations and letting the number
of parts become large (so

Work needed to empty a tank
A tank has the shape of an inverted circular
cone with height 10 m and base radius 4 m. It is ﬁlled with water to a height of 8 m.
Find the work required to empty the tank by pumping all of the water to the top of the
tank. (The density of water is 1000 kgm .)
SOLUTION Let’s measure depths from the top of the tank by introducing a vertical coordi-
nate line as in Figure 3. The water extends from a depth of 2 m to a depth of 10 m and
so we divide the interval 
into n subintervals with endpoints 
and
choose 
in the th subinterval. This divides the water into 
layers. The th layer is
approximated by a circular cylinder with radius 
and height 
. We can compute 
from similar triangles, using Figure 4, as follows:
Thus an approximation to the volume of the th layer of water is
and so its mass is
The force required to raise this layer must overcome the force of gravity and so
Each particle in the layer must travel a distance of approximately
. The work
done to
raise this layer to the top is approximately the product of the force
and the distance
:
To ﬁnd the total work done in emptying the entire tank, we add the contributions of each
of the layers and then take the limit as 
:
Hydrostatic Pressure and Force
Deep-sea divers realize that water pressure increases as they dive deeper. This is because
the weight of the water above them increases.
In general, suppose that a thin horizontal plate with area 
square meters is submerged
in a ﬂuid of density 
kilograms per cubic meter at a depth 
meters below the surface of
the ﬂuid as in Figure 5. The ﬂuid directly above the plate has volume 
, so its mass

is 
. The force exerted by the ﬂuid on the plate is therefore
where is the acceleration due to gravity. The pressure 
on the plate is deﬁned to be the
force per unit area:
The SI unit for measuring pressure is newtons per square meter, which is called a pascal
(abbreviation: 1 Nm
Pa). Since this is a small unit, the kilopascal (kPa) is often
used. For instance, because the density of water is 
kgm , the pressure at the
bottom of a swimming pool 2 m deep is
An important principle of ﬂuid pressure is the experimentally veriﬁed fact that at any
point in a liquid the pressure is the same in all directions. (A diver feels the same pressure
on nose and both ears.) Thus the pressure in any direction at a depth in a ﬂuid with mass
density is given by
This helps us determine the hydrostatic force against a vertical plate or wall or dam in a
ﬂuid. This is not a straightforward problem because the pressure is not constant but
increases as the depth increases.
Hydrostatic force on a dam
A dam has the shape of the trapezoid shown
in Figure 6. The height is 20 m and the width is 50 m at the top and 30 m at the bottom.
Find the force on the dam due to hydrostatic pressure if the water level is 4 m from the
top of the dam.
SOLUTION We choose a vertical -axis with origin at the surface of the water as in
Figure 7(a). The depth of the water is 16 m, so we divide the interval 
into 
subintervals of equal length with endpoints 
and we choose 
. The 
horizontal strip of the dam is approximated by a rectangle with height 
and width 
,
where, from similar triangles in Figure 7(b),
or
and so
If 
is the area of the 
strip, then
If 
is small, then the pressure 
on the 
strip is almost constant and we can use

The hydrostatic force 
acting on the 
strip is the product of the pressure and the area:
Adding these forces and taking the limit as 
, we obtain the total hydrostatic force
on the dam:
Moments and Centers of Mass
Our main objective here is to ﬁnd the point 
on which a thin plate of any given shape bal-
ances horizontally as in Figure 8. This point is called the center of mass (or center of grav-
ity) of the plate.
We ﬁrst consider the simpler situation illustrated in Figure 9, where two masses 
and
are attached to a rod of negligible mass on opposite sides of a fulcrum and at distances
and 
from the fulcrum. The rod will balance if
This is an experimental fact discovered by Archimedes and called the Law of the Lever.
(Think of a lighter person balancing a heavier one on a seesaw by sitting farther away from
the center.)
Now suppose that the rod lies along the -axis with 
at 
and 
at 
and the center
of mass at . If we compare Figures 9 and 10, we see that 
and 
and so Equation 6 gives
The numbers 
and 
are called the moments of the masses 
and 
(with respect
to the origin), and Equation 7 says that the center of mass 
is obtained by adding the
moments of the masses and dividing by the total mass 
.
In general, if we have a system of particles with masses 
, 
. . . , 
located at the
points 
, 
. . . , 
on the -axis, it can be shown similarly that the center of mass of the
system is located at

where 
is the total mass of the system, and the sum of the individual moments
is called the moment of the system about the origin. Then Equation 8 could be rewritten
as 
, which says that if the total mass were considered as being concentrated at the
center of mass , then its moment would be the same as the moment of the system.
Now we consider a system of 
particles with masses 
, 
. . . , 
located at the
points 
, 
, . . . , 
in the 
-plane as shown in Figure 11. By analogy with
the one-dimensional case, we deﬁne the moment of the system about the y-axis to be
and the moment of the system about the x-axis as
Then 
measures the tendency of the system to rotate about the -axis and 
measures
the tendency to rotate about the -axis.
As in the one-dimensional case, the coordinates 
of the center of mass are given
in terms of the moments by the formulas
where 
is the total mass. Since 
and 
, the center of mass 
is the point where a single particle of mass 
would have the same moments as the system.
Find the moments and center of mass of the system of objects that have
masses 3, 4, and 8 at the points 
, 
, and 
.
SOLUTION We use Equations 9 and 10 to compute the moments:
Since 
, we use Equations 11 to obtain
Thus the center of mass is 
. (See Figure 12.)
Next we consider a ﬂat plate (called a lamina) with uniform density 
that occupies a
region 
of the plane. We wish to locate the center of mass of the plate, which is called
the centroid of 
. In doing so we use the following physical principles: The symmetry
principle says that if 
is symmetric about a line , then the centroid of 
lies on . (If 
is reﬂected about , then 
remains the same so its centroid remains ﬁxed. But the only

ﬁxed points lie on .) Thus the centroid of a rectangle is its center. Moments should be
deﬁned so that if the entire mass of a region is concentrated at the center of mass, then its
moments remain unchanged. Also, the moment of the union of two nonoverlapping regions
should be the sum of the moments of the individual regions.
Suppose that the region 
is of the type shown in Figure 13(a); that is, 
lies between
the lines 
and 
, above the -axis, and beneath the graph of , where 
is a 
continuous function. We divide the interval 
into n subintervals with endpoints 
and equal width 
. We choose the sample point 
to be the midpoint 
of the
subinterval, that is, 
. This determines the polygonal approximation to
shown in Figure 13(b). The centroid of the 
approximating rectangle 
is its center
. Its area is 
, so its mass is
The moment of 
about the -axis is the product of its mass and the distance from 
to
the -axis, which is 
Adding these moments, we obtain the moment of the polygonal approximation to 
, and
then by taking the limit as 
we obtain the moment of 
itself about the -axis:
In a similar fashion we compute the moment of 
about the -axis as the product of its
mass and the distance from 
to the -axis:
Again we add these moments and take the limit to obtain the moment of 
about the 
-axis:
Just as for systems of particles, the center of mass of the plate is deﬁned so that
and 
. But the mass of the plate is the product of its density and its area:

Complementary Coffee Cups
Suppose you have a choice of two coffee cups of the type shown, one that bends outward and one
inward, and you notice that they have the same height and their shapes ﬁt together snugly. You
wonder which cup holds more coffee. Of course you could ﬁll one cup with water and pour it 
into the other one but, being a calculus student, you decide on a more mathematical approach.
Ignoring the handles, you observe that both cups are surfaces of revolution, so you can think of the
coffee as a volume of revolution.
1. Suppose the cups have height , cup A is formed by rotating the curve 
about the 
-axis, and cup B is formed by rotating the same curve about the line 
. Find the value 
of such that the two cups hold the same amount of coffee.
2. What does your result from Problem 1 say about the areas 
and 
shown in the ﬁgure?
3. Based on your own measurements and observations, suggest a value for and an equation
for 
and calculate the amount of coffee that each cup holds.

CHAPTER 6
APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION
In this section we consider some applications of integration to economics (consumer sur-
plus) and biology (blood ﬂow, cardiac output). Others are described in the exercises.
Consumer Surplus
Recall from Section 4.6 that the demand function 
is the price that a company has to
charge in order to sell 
units of a commodity. Usually, selling larger quantities requires
lowering prices, so the demand function is a decreasing function. The graph of a typical
demand function, called a demand curve, is shown in Figure 1. If 
is the amount of the
commodity that is currently available, then 
is the current selling price.
We divide the interval 
into 
subintervals, each of length 
, and let
be the right endpoint of the th subinterval, as in Figure 2. If, after the ﬁrst 
units were sold, a total of only 
units had been available and the price per unit had been
set at 
dollars, then the additional 
units could have been sold (but no more). The
consumers who would have paid 
dollars placed a high value on the product; they
would have paid what it was worth to them. So, in paying only 
dollars they have saved
an amount of
Considering similar groups of willing consumers for each of the subintervals and adding
the savings, we get the total savings:
(This sum corresponds to the area enclosed by the rectangles in Figure 2.) If we let
,
this Riemann sum approaches the integral
which economists call the consumer surplus for the commodity.
The consumer surplus represents the amount of money saved by consumers in pur-
chasing the commodity at price , corresponding to an amount demanded of . Figure 3
shows the interpretation of the consumer surplus as the area under the demand curve and
above the line 
.

Find the consumer surplus when the sales level is 500.
SOLUTION Since the number of products sold is 
, the corresponding price is
Therefore, from Deﬁnition 1, the consumer surplus is
Blood Flow
In Example 7 in Section 3.8 we discussed the law of laminar ﬂow:
which gives the velocity of blood that ﬂows along a blood vessel with radius 
and length
at a distance from the central axis, where 
is the pressure difference between the ends
of the vessel and 
is the viscosity of the blood. Now, in order to compute the rate of blood
ﬂow, or ﬂux (volume per unit time), we consider smaller, equally spaced radii 
. . . .
The approximate area of the ring (or washer) with inner radius 
and outer radius 
is
where
(See Figure 4.) If 
is small, then the velocity is almost constant throughout this ring and
can be approximated by 
. Thus the volume of blood per unit time that ﬂows across the
ring is approximately
and the total volume of blood that ﬂows across a cross-section per unit time is about
This approximation is illustrated in Figure 5. Notice that the velocity (and hence the vol-
ume per unit time) increases toward the center of the blood vessel. The approximation gets
better as increases. When we take the limit we get the exact value of the ﬂux (or discharge),

which is the volume of blood that passes a cross-section per unit time:
The resulting equation
is called Poiseuille’s Law; it shows that the ﬂux is proportional to the fourth power of the
radius of the blood vessel.
Cardiac Output
Figure 6 shows the human cardiovascular system. Blood returns from the body through the
veins, enters the right atrium of the heart, and is pumped to the lungs through the pul-
monary arteries for oxygenation. It then ﬂows back into the left atrium through the pulmo-
nary veins and then out to the rest of the body through the aorta. The cardiac output
of the heart is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per unit time, that is, the rate of
ﬂow into the aorta.
The dye dilution method is used to measure the cardiac output. Dye is injected into the
right atrium and ﬂows through the heart into the aorta. A probe inserted into the aorta
measures the concentration of the dye leaving the heart at equally spaced times over a time
interval 
until the dye has cleared. Let 
be the concentration of the dye at time 
If we divide 
into subintervals of equal length 
, then the amount of dye that ﬂows
past the measuring point during the subinterval from 
to 
is approximately
where 
is the rate of ﬂow that we are trying to determine. Thus the total amount of dye
is approximately
and, letting 
, we ﬁnd that the amount of dye is
Thus the cardiac output is given by
where the amount of dye 
is known and the integral can be approximated from the con-
centration readings.

be the amount of the commodity currently
produced and let

Calculus plays a role in the analysis of random behavior. Suppose we consider the choles-
terol level of a person chosen at random from a certain age group, or the height of an adult
female chosen at random, or the lifetime of a randomly chosen battery of a certain type.
Such quantities are called continuous random variables because their values actually
range over an interval of real numbers, although they might be measured or recorded only
to the nearest integer. We might want to know the probability that a blood cholesterol level
is greater than 250, or the probability that the height of an adult female is between 60 and
70 inches, or the probability that the battery we are buying lasts between 100 and 200
hours. If X represents the lifetime of that type of battery, we denote this last probability as
follows:

According to the frequency interpretation of probability, this number is the long-run pro-
portion of all batteries of the speciﬁed type whose lifetimes are between 100 and 200
hours. Since it represents a proportion, the probability naturally falls between 0 and 1.
Every continuous random variable X has a probability density function . This means
that the probability that X lies between a and b is found by integrating 
from a to b:
For example, Figure 1 shows the graph of a model for the probability density function
for a random variable X deﬁned to be the height in inches of an adult female in the
United States (according to data from the National Health Survey). The probability that the
height of a woman chosen at random from this population is between 60 and 70 inches is
equal to the area under the graph of 
from 60 to 70.
In general, the probability density function 
of a random variable X satisﬁes the con-
dition 
for all x. Because probabilities are measured on a scale from 0 to 1, it fol-

Probability density function for waiting times
Phenomena such as waiting
times and equipment failure times are commonly modeled by exponentially decreasing
probability density functions. Find the exact form of such a function.
SOLUTION Think of the random variable as being the time you wait on hold before an 
agent of a company you’re telephoning answers your call. So instead of x, let’s use t to
represent time, in minutes. If 
is the probability density function and you call at time
, then, from Deﬁnition 1, 
represents the probability that an agent answers
within the ﬁrst two minutes and 
is the probability that your call is answered
during the ﬁfth minute.
It’s clear that 
for 
(the agent can’t answer before you place the call).
For 
we are told to use an exponentially decreasing function, that is, a function of
the form 
, where A and c are positive constants. Thus
We use Equation 2 to determine the value of A:
Therefore 
and so 
. Thus every exponential density function has the form
A typical graph is shown in Figure 2.
Average Values
Suppose you’re waiting for a company to answer your phone call and you wonder how
long, on average, you can expect to wait. Let 
be the corresponding density function,
where t is measured in minutes, and think of a sample of N people who have called this
company. Most likely, none of them had to wait more than an hour, so let’s restrict our
attention to the interval 
. Let’s divide that interval into n intervals of length 
and endpoints 
. . .,
. (Think of 
as lasting a minute, or half a minute, or 10 sec-
onds, or even a second.) The probability that somebody’s call gets answered during the
time period from 
to 
is the area under the curve 
from 
to , which is
approximately equal to 
. (This is the area of the approximating rectangle in Fig-
ure 3, where is the midpoint of the interval.)
Since the long-run proportion of calls that get answered in the time period from 
to
is 
, we expect that, out of our sample of N callers, the number whose call was
answered in that time period is approximately 
and the time that each waited is
about . Therefore the total time they waited is the product of these numbers: approxi-
mately 
. Adding over all such intervals, we get the approximate total of every-

body’s waiting times:
If we now divide by the number of callers N, we get the approximate average waiting time:
We recognize this as a Riemann sum for the function 
. As the time interval shrinks
(that is, 
and 
), this Riemann sum approaches the integral
This integral is called the mean waiting time.
In general, the mean of any probability density function 
is deﬁned to be
The mean can be interpreted as the long-run average value of the random variable X. It can
also be interpreted as a measure of centrality of the probability density function.
The expression for the mean resembles an integral we have seen before. If 
is the
region that lies under the graph of
, we know from Formula 6.6.12 that the x-coordinate
of the centroid of

because of Equation 2. So a thin plate in the shape of

line

The mean is 
, so we can rewrite the probability density function as
Suppose the average waiting time for a customer’s call to be answered 
by a company representative is ﬁve minutes.
(a) Find the probability that a call is answered during the ﬁrst minute.
(b) Find the probability that a customer waits more than ﬁve minutes to be answered.
SOLUTION
(a) We are given that the mean of the exponential distribution is 
min and so,
from the result of Example 3, we know that the probability density function is 
Thus the probability that a call is answered during the ﬁrst minute is
So about 18% of customers’ calls are answered during the ﬁrst minute.
(b) The probability that a customer waits more than ﬁve minutes is
About 37% of customers wait more than ﬁve minutes before their calls are answered.
Notice the result of Example 4(b): Even though the mean waiting time is 5 minutes,
only 37% of callers wait more than 5 minutes. The reason is that some callers have to wait
much longer (maybe 10 or 15 minutes), and this brings up the average.
Another measure of centrality of a probability density function is the median. That is a
number m such that half the callers have a waiting time less than m and the other callers
have a waiting time longer than m. In general, the median of a probability density function
is the number m such that

This means that half the area under the graph of 
lies to the right of m. In Exercise 9 you
are asked to show that the median waiting time for the company described in Example 4
is approximately 3.5 minutes.
Normal Distributions
Many important random phenomena—such as test scores on aptitude tests, heights and
weights of individuals from a homogeneous population, annual rainfall in a given loca-
tion—are modeled by a normal distribution. This means that the probability density
function of the random variable X is a member of the family of functions
You can verify that the mean for this function is . The positive constant 
is called the
standard deviation; it measures how spread out the values of X are. From the bell-shaped
graphs of members of the family in Figure 5, we see that for small values of 
the values
of X are clustered about the mean, whereas for larger values of 
the values of X are more
spread out. Statisticians have methods for using sets of data to estimate 
and .
The factor 
is needed to make 
a probability density function. In fact, it can
be veriﬁed using the methods of multivariable calculus that
Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores are distributed normally with mean 
100 and standard deviation 15. (Figure 6 shows the corresponding probability density
function.)
(a) What percentage of the population has an IQ score between 85 and 115?
(b) What percentage of the population has an IQ above 140?
SOLUTION
(a) Since IQ scores are normally distributed, we use the probability density function
given by Equation 3 with 
and 
:
Recall from Section 5.8 that the function 
doesn’t have an elementary anti-
derivative, so we can’t evaluate the integral exactly. But we can use the numerical 
integration capability of a calculator or computer (or the Midpoint Rule or Simpson’s

Differential Equations
Perhaps the most important of all the applications of calculus is to differential
equations. When physical scientists or social scientists use calculus, more often
than not it is to analyze a differential equation that has arisen in the process of
modeling some phenomenon that they are studying. Although it is often impos-
sible to ﬁnd an explicit formula for the solution of a differential equation, we will
see that graphical and numerical approaches provide the needed information.

CHAPTER 7
DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
In describing the process of modeling in Section 1.2, we talked about formulating a math-
ematical model of a real-world problem either through intuitive reasoning about the phe-
nomenon or from a physical law based on evidence from experiments. The mathematical
model often takes the form of a differential equation, that is, an equation that contains an
unknown function and some of its derivatives. This is not surprising because in a real-
world problem we often notice that changes occur and we want to predict future behavior
on the basis of how current values change. Let’s begin by examining several examples of
how differential equations arise when we model physical phenomena.
Models of Population Growth
One model for the growth of a population is based on the assumption that the population
grows at a rate proportional to the size of the population. That is a reasonable assumption
for a population of bacteria or animals under ideal conditions (unlimited environment, ade-
quate nutrition, absence of predators, immunity from disease).
Let’s identify and name the variables in this model:
The rate of growth of the population is the derivative 
. So our assumption that the
rate of growth of the population is proportional to the population size is written as the
equation
where k is the proportionality constant. Equation 1 is our ﬁrst model for population
growth; it is a differential equation because it contains an unknown function P and its
derivative 
.
Having formulated a model, let’s look at its consequences. If we rule out a population
of 0, then 
for all t. So, if 
, then Equation 1 shows that 
for all t.
This means that the population is always increasing. In fact, as 
increases, Equation 1
shows that 
becomes larger. In other words, the growth rate increases as the popula-
tion increases.
Let’s try to think of a solution of Equation 1. This equation asks us to ﬁnd a function
whose derivative is a constant multiple of itself. We know that exponential functions have
that property. In fact, if we let 
, then
Thus any exponential function of the form 
is a solution of Equation 1. When
we study this equation in detail in Section 7.4, we will see that there is no other solution.
Allowing C to vary through all the real numbers, we get the family of solutions
whose graphs are shown in Figure 1. But populations have only positive 
values and so we are interested only in the solutions with 
. And we are probably con-
cerned only with values of t greater than the initial time 
. Figure 2 shows the physi-

cally meaningful solutions. Putting 
, we get 
, so the constant C
turns out to be the initial population, 
.
Equation 1 is appropriate for modeling population growth under ideal conditions, but
we have to recognize that a more realistic model must reﬂect the fact that a given environ-
ment has limited resources. Many populations start by increasing in an exponential man-
ner, but the population levels off when it approaches its carrying capacity M (or decreases
toward 
if it ever exceeds 
). For a model to take into account both trends, we make two
assumptions:
■
if P is small (Initially, the growth rate is proportional to P.)
■
if 
(P decreases if it ever exceeds M.)
A simple expression that incorporates both assumptions is given by the equation 
Notice that if P is small compared with M, then 
is close to 0 and so 
. If
, then 
is negative and so 
.
Equation 2 is called the logistic differential equation and was proposed by the Dutch
mathematical biologist Pierre-François Verhulst in the 1840s as a model for world popula-
tion growth. We will develop techniques that enable us to ﬁnd explicit solutions of the
logistic equation in Section 7.5, but for now we can deduce qualitative characteristics of
the solutions directly from Equation 2. We ﬁrst observe that the constant functions
and 
are solutions because, in either case, one of the factors on the right
side of Equation 2 is zero. (This certainly makes physical sense: If the population is ever
either 0 or at the carrying capacity, it stays that way.) These two constant solutions are
called equilibrium solutions.
If the initial population 
lies between 0 and M, then the right side of Equation 2 is
positive, so 
and the population increases. But if the population exceeds the carry-
ing capacity 
, then 
is negative, so 
and the population
decreases. Notice that, in either case, if the population approaches the carrying capacity
, then 
, which means the population levels off. So we expect that the
solutions of the logistic differential equation have graphs that look something like the ones
in Figure 3. Notice that the graphs move away from the equilibrium solution 
and
move toward the equilibrium solution 
.

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
A Model for the Motion of a Spring
Let’s now look at an example of a model from the physical sciences. We consider the
motion of an object with mass m at the end of a vertical spring (as in Figure 4). In Sec-
tion 6.6 we discussed Hooke’s Law, which says that if the spring is stretched (or com-
pressed) x units from its natural length, then it exerts a force that is proportional to x:
where k is a positive constant (called the spring constant). If we ignore any external resist-
ing forces (due to air resistance or friction) then, by Newton’s Second Law (force equals
mass times acceleration), we have
This is an example of what is called a second-order differential equation because it
involves second derivatives. Let’s see what we can guess about the form of the solution
directly from the equation. We can rewrite Equation 3 in the form
which says that the second derivative of x is proportional to x but has the opposite sign. We
know two functions with this property, the sine and cosine functions. In fact, it turns 
out that all solutions of Equation 3 can be written as combinations of certain sine 
and cosine functions (see Exercise 4). This is not surprising; we expect the spring to oscil-
late about its equilibrium position and so it is natural to think that trigonometric functions
are involved.
General Differential Equations
In general, a differential equation is an equation that contains an unknown function and
one or more of its derivatives. The order of a differential equation is the order of the high-
est derivative that occurs in the equation. Thus Equations 1 and 2 are ﬁrst-order equations
and Equation 3 is a second-order equation. In all three of those equations the independent
variable is called t and represents time, but in general the independent variable doesn’t
have to represent time. For example, when we consider the differential equation
it is understood that y is an unknown function of x.
A function

solutions of the equation. We have already solved some particularly simple differential

MODELING WITH DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

For instance, we know that the general solution of the differential equation
is given by
where C is an arbitrary constant.
But, in general, solving a differential equation is not an easy matter. There is no sys-
tematic technique that enables us to solve all differential equations. In Section 7.2, how-
ever, we will see how to draw rough graphs of solutions even when we have no explicit
formula. We will also learn how to ﬁnd numerical approximations to solutions.
Verifying solutions of a differential equation
Show that every member of
the family of functions
is a solution of the differential equation 
.
SOLUTION We use the Quotient Rule to differentiate the expression for y:
The right side of the differential equation becomes
Therefore, for every value of c, the given function is a solution of the differential 
equation.
When applying differential equations, we are usually not as interested in ﬁnding a
family of solutions (the general solution) as we are in ﬁnding a solution that satisﬁes some
additional requirement. In many physical problems we need to ﬁnd the particular solution
that satisﬁes a condition of the form 
. This is called an initial condition, and the
problem of ﬁnding a solution of the differential equation that satisﬁes the initial condition
is called an initial-value problem.
Geometrically, when we impose an initial condition, we look at the family of solution
curves and pick the one that passes through the point 
. Physically, this corresponds
to measuring the state of a system at time and using the solution of the initial-value prob-
lem to predict the future behavior of the system.

Unfortunately, it’s impossible to solve most differential equations in the sense of obtain-
ing an explicit formula for the solution. In this section we show that, despite the absence
of an explicit solution, we can still learn a lot about the solution through a graphical
approach (direction ﬁelds) or a numerical approach (Euler’s method).

CHAPTER 7
DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
We don’t know a formula for the solution, so how can we possibly sketch its graph? Let’s
think about what the differential equation means. The equation 
tells us that the
slope at any point 
on the graph (called the solution curve) is equal to the sum of the
x- and y-coordinates of the point (see Figure 1). In particular, because the curve passes
through the point 
, its slope there must be 
. So a small portion of the solu-
tion curve near the point 
looks like a short line segment through 
with slope 1.
(See Figure 2.)
As a guide to sketching the rest of the curve, let’s draw short line segments at a num-
ber of points 
with slope 
. The result is called a direction ﬁeld and is shown in
Figure 3. For instance, the line segment at the point 
has slope 
. The direc-
tion ﬁeld allows us to visualize the general shape of the solution curves by indicating the
direction in which the curves proceed at each point.
Now we can sketch the solution curve through the point 
by following the direc-
tion ﬁeld as in Figure 4. Notice that we have drawn the curve so that it is parallel to near-
by line segments.
In general, suppose we have a ﬁrst-order differential equation of the form
where 
is some expression in 
and . The differential equation says that the slope
of a solution curve at a point 
on the curve is 
. If we draw short line segments
with slope 
at several points 
, the result is called a direction ﬁeld (or slope
ﬁeld). These line segments indicate the direction in which a solution curve is heading, so
the direction ﬁeld helps us visualize the general shape of these curves.

Using a direction ﬁeld to sketch a solution curve
(a) Sketch the direction ﬁeld for the differential equation 
.
(b) Use part (a) to sketch the solution curve that passes through the origin.
SOLUTION
(a) We start by computing the slope at several points in the following chart:
Now we draw short line segments with these slopes at these points. The result is the
direction ﬁeld shown in Figure 5.
(b) We start at the origin and move to the right in the direction of the line segment
(which has slope 
). We continue to draw the solution curve so that it moves parallel
to the nearby line segments. The resulting solution curve is shown in Figure 6. Returning
to the origin, we draw the solution curve to the left as well.
The more line segments we draw in a direction ﬁeld, the clearer the picture becomes.
Of course, it’s tedious to compute slopes and draw line segments for a huge number of
points by hand, but computers are well suited for this task. Figure 7 shows a more detailed,
computer-drawn direction ﬁeld for the differential equation in Example 1. It enables us to
draw, with reasonable accuracy, the solution curves shown in Figure 8 with -intercepts
, 
, , , and .
Now let’s see how direction ﬁelds give insight into physical situations. The simple elec-
tric circuit shown in Figure 9 contains an electromotive force (usually a battery or gener-
ator) that produces a voltage of 
volts (V) and a current of 
amperes (A) at time t.
The circuit also contains a resistor with a resistance of R ohms (
) and an inductor with
an inductance of L henries (H).
Ohm’s Law gives the drop in voltage due to the resistor as RI. The voltage drop due to
the inductor is 
. One of Kirchhoff’s laws says that the sum of the voltage drops is
equal to the supplied voltage 
. Thus we have
which is a ﬁrst-order differential equation that models the current at time .t

. In general, a differential equation of the form
in which the independent variable is missing from the right side, is called autonomous.
For such an equation, the slopes corresponding to two different points with the same 
-coordinate must be equal. This means that if we know one solution to an autonomous 
differential equation, then we can obtain inﬁnitely many others just by shifting the graph
of the known solution to the right or left. In Figure 11 we have shown the solutions 
that result from shifting the solution curve of Example 2 one and two time units (namely,
seconds) to the right. They correspond to closing the switch when 
or 
.
Euler’s Method
The basic idea behind direction ﬁelds can be used to ﬁnd numerical approximations to
solutions of differential equations. We illustrate the method on the initial-value problem
that we used to introduce direction ﬁelds:
The differential equation tells us that 
, so the solution curve has slope
1 at the point 
. As a ﬁrst approximation to the solution we could use the linear approx-
imation 
. In other words, we could use the tangent line at 
as a rough
approximation to the solution curve (see Figure 12).
Euler’s idea was to improve on this approximation by proceeding only a short distance
along this tangent line and then making a midcourse correction by changing direction as
indicated by the direction ﬁeld. Figure 13 shows what happens if we start out along the
tangent line but stop when 
. (This horizontal distance traveled is called the step
size.) Since 
, we have 
and we take 
as the starting point
for a new line segment. The differential equation tells us that 
, so
we use the linear function
as an approximation to the solution for 
(the green segment in Figure 13). If we
decrease the step size from 
to 
, we get the better Euler approximation shown in
Figure 14.
In general, Euler’s method says to start at the point given by the initial value and pro-
ceed in the direction indicated by the direction ﬁeld. Stop after a short time, look at the
slope at the new location, and proceed in that direction. Keep stopping and changing direc-
tion according to the direction ﬁeld. Euler’s method does not produce the exact solution to
an initial-value problem—it gives approximations. But by decreasing the step size (and
therefore increasing the number of midcourse corrections), we obtain successively better
approximations to the exact solution. (Compare Figures 12, 13, and 14.)

Euler
Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) was the leading
mathematician of the mid-18th century and the
most proliﬁc mathematician of all time. He was
born in Switzerland but spent most of his career
at the academies of science supported by
Catherine the Great in St. Petersburg and 
Frederick the Great in Berlin. The collected
works of Euler (pronounced Oiler) ﬁll about 100
large volumes. As the French physicist Arago
said, “Euler calculated without apparent effort,
as men breathe or as eagles sustain themselves
in the air.” Euler’s calculations and writings
were not diminished by raising 13 children or
being totally blind for the last 17 years of his
life. In fact, when blind, he dictated his discov-
eries to his helpers from his prodigious memory
and imagination. His treatises on calculus and
most other mathematical subjects became the
standard for mathematics instruction and the
equation 
that he discovered
brings together the ﬁve most famous numbers
in all of mathematics.

Proceeding with similar calculations, we get the values in the table:
For a more accurate table of values in Example 3 we could decrease the step size. But
for a large number of small steps the amount of computation is considerable and so we
need to program a calculator or computer to carry out these calculations. The following
table shows the results of applying Euler’s method with decreasing step size to the initial-
value problem of Example 3.

Computer software packages that produce
numerical approximations to solutions of 
differential equations use methods that are
reﬁnements of Euler’s method. Although Euler’s
method is simple and not as accurate, it is 
the basic idea on which the more accurate
methods are based.

step sizes 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01, and 0.005. They are approaching the exact solu-
tion curve as the step size h approaches 0.

We have looked at ﬁrst-order differential equations from a geometric point of view (direc-
tion ﬁelds) and from a numerical point of view (Euler’s method). What about the symbolic
point of view? It would be nice to have an explicit formula for a solution of a differential
equation. Unfortunately, that is not always possible. But in this section we examine a cer-
tain type of differential equation that can be solved explicitly.
A separable equation is a ﬁrst-order differential equation in which the expression for
can be factored as a function of x times a function of y. In other words, it can be
written in the form
The name separable comes from the fact that the expression on the right side can be “sep-
arated” into a function of and a function of . Equivalently, if 
, we could write
where 
. To solve this equation we rewrite it in the differential form
so that all ’s are on one side of the equation and all ’s are on the other side. Then we inte-
grate both sides of the equation:
Equation 2 deﬁnes implicitly as a function of . In some cases we may be able to solve
for in terms of .
We use the Chain Rule to justify this procedure: If and satisfy (2), then
so
and
Thus Equation 1 is satisﬁed.

Separable Equations
The technique for solving separable differential
equations was ﬁrst used by James Bernoulli (in
1690) in solving a problem about pendulums
and by Leibniz (in a letter to Huygens in 1691).
John Bernoulli explained the general method in
a paper published in 1694.

SECTION 7.3

Solving a separable equation
(a) Solve the differential equation 
.
(b) Find the solution of this equation that satisﬁes the initial condition 
.
SOLUTION
(a) We write the equation in terms of differentials and integrate both sides:
where 
is an arbitrary constant. (We could have used a constant 
on the left side and
another constant 
on the right side. But then we could combine these constants by
writing 
.)
Solving for , we get
We could leave the solution like this or we could write it in the form
where 
. (Since 
is an arbitrary constant, so is .)
(b) If we put 
in the general solution in part (a), we get 
. To satisfy the
initial condition 
, we must have 
and so 
. Thus the solution of
the initial-value problem is
A separable equation with an implicit solution
Solve the differential equation 
.
SOLUTION Writing the equation in differential form and integrating both sides, we have
where 
is a constant. Equation 3 gives the general solution implicitly. In this case it’s
impossible to solve the equation to express explicitly as a function of .
Solve the equation

Orthogonal Trajectories
An orthogonal trajectory of a family of curves is a curve that intersects each curve of the
family orthogonally, that is, at right angles (see Figure 7). For instance, each member of
the family 
of straight lines through the origin is an orthogonal trajectory of the
family 
of concentric circles with center the origin (see Figure 8). We say that
the two families are orthogonal trajectories of each other.
Find the orthogonal trajectories of the family of curves 
, where 
is an arbitrary constant.
SOLUTION The curves 
form a family of parabolas whose axis of symmetry is 
the -axis. The ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd a single differential equation that is satisﬁed by all

, we get
This differential equation depends on , but we need an equation that is valid for all
values of simultaneously. To eliminate we note that, from the equation of the given
general parabola 
, we have 
and so the differential equation can be 
written as
or
This means that the slope of the tangent line at any point 
on one of the parabolas is
. On an orthogonal trajectory the slope of the tangent line must be the nega-
tive reciprocal of this slope. Therefore the orthogonal trajectories must satisfy the differ-
ential equation
This differential equation is separable, and we solve it as follows:
where 
is an arbitrary positive constant. Thus the orthogonal trajectories are the family
of ellipses given by Equation 4 and sketched in Figure 9.
Orthogonal trajectories occur in various branches of physics. For example, in an elec-
trostatic ﬁeld the lines of force are orthogonal to the lines of constant potential. Also, 
the streamlines in aerodynamics are orthogonal trajectories of the velocity-equipotential
curves.
Mixing Problems
A typical mixing problem involves a tank of ﬁxed capacity ﬁlled with a thoroughly mixed
solution of some substance, such as salt. A solution of a given concentration enters the tank
at a ﬁxed rate and the mixture, thoroughly stirred, leaves at a ﬁxed rate, which may differ
from the entering rate. If 
denotes the amount of substance in the tank at time t, then
is the rate at which the substance is being added minus the rate at which it is being
removed. The mathematical description of this situation often leads to a ﬁrst-order sepa-
rable differential equation. We can use the same type of reasoning to model a variety of
phenomena: chemical reactions, discharge of pollutants into a lake, injection of a drug into
the bloodstream.

A tank contains 20 kg of salt dissolved in 5000 L of water. Brine that con-
tains 0.03 kg of salt per liter of water enters the tank at a rate of 
. The solution
is kept thoroughly mixed and drains from the tank at the same rate. How much salt
remains in the tank after half an hour?
SOLUTION Let 
be the amount of salt (in kilograms) after minutes. We are given that
and we want to ﬁnd 
. We do this by ﬁnding a differential equation satis-
ﬁed by 
. Note that 
is the rate of change of the amount of salt, so
where (rate in) is the rate at which salt enters the tank and (rate out) is the rate at which
salt leaves the tank. We have
The tank always contains 5000 L of liquid, so the concentration at time is 
(measured in kilograms per liter). Since the brine ﬂows out at a rate of 25 Lmin, we
have
Thus, from Equation 5, we get
Solving this separable differential equation, we obtain
Since 
, we have 
, so
Therefore
Since 
is continuous and 
and the right side is never 0, we deduce that
is always positive. Thus

APPLIED PROJECT
HOW FAST DOES A TANK DRAIN?

APPLIED PROJECT
How Fast Does a Tank Drain?
If water (or other liquid) drains from a tank, we expect that the ﬂow will be greatest at ﬁrst (when
the water depth is greatest) and will gradually decrease as the water level decreases. But we need 
a more precise mathematical description of how the ﬂow decreases in order to answer the kinds 
of questions that engineers ask: How long does it take for a tank to drain completely? How much
water should a tank hold in order to guarantee a certain minimum water pressure for a sprinkler
system?
Let 
and 
be the height and volume of water in a tank at time . If water drains through a
hole with area at the bottom of the tank, then Torricelli’s Law says that
where is the acceleration due to gravity. So the rate at which water ﬂows from the tank is propor-
tional to the square root of the water height.
1. (a) Suppose the tank is cylindrical with height 6 ft and radius 2 ft and the hole is circular
with radius 1 inch. If we take 
fts , show that satisﬁes the differential equation
(b) Solve this equation to ﬁnd the height of the water at time , assuming the tank is full at 
time 
.
(c) How long will it take for the water to drain completely?
2. Because of the rotation and viscosity of the liquid, the theoretical model given by Equa-
tion 1 isn’t quite accurate. Instead, the model
is often used and the constant (which depends on the physical properties of the liquid) is
determined from data concerning the draining of the tank.
(a) Suppose that a hole is drilled in the side of a cylindrical bottle and the height of the
water (above the hole) decreases from 10 cm to 3 cm in 68 seconds. Use Equation 2 to
ﬁnd an expression for 
. Evaluate 
for 
.
(b) Drill a 4-mm hole near the bottom of the cylindrical part of a two-liter plastic soft-drink
bottle. Attach a strip of masking tape marked in centimeters from 0 to 10, with 0 corre-
sponding to the top of the hole. With one ﬁnger over the hole, ﬁll the bottle with water
to the 10-cm mark. Then take your ﬁnger off the hole and record the values of 
for
seconds. (You will probably ﬁnd that it takes 68 seconds for
the level to decrease to 
.) Compare your data with the values of 
from
part (a). How well did the model predict the actual values?
3. In many parts of the world, the water for sprinkler systems in large hotels and hospitals is 
supplied by gravity from cylindrical tanks on or near the roofs of the buildings. Suppose 
such a tank has radius 10 ft and the diameter of the outlet is 2.5 inches. An engineer has to
guarantee that the water pressure will be at least 2160 
for a period of 10 minutes.
(When a ﬁre happens, the electrical system might fail and it could take up to 10 minutes for
the emergency generator and ﬁre pump to be activated.) What height should the engineer
specify for the tank in order to make such a guarantee? (Use the fact that the water pressure
at a depth of 
feet is 
. See Section 6.6.)

APPLIED PROJECT
Which Is Faster, Going Up or Coming Down?
Suppose you throw a ball into the air. Do you think it takes longer to reach its maximum height 
or to fall back to earth from its maximum height? We will solve the problem in this project but,
before getting started, think about that situation and make a guess based on your physical 
intuition.
1. A ball with mass 
is projected vertically upward from the earth’s surface with a positive
initial velocity . We assume the forces acting on the ball are the force of gravity and a
retarding force of air resistance with direction opposite to the direction of motion and with
magnitude 
, where 
is a positive constant and 
is the velocity of the ball at time .
In both the ascent and the descent, the total force acting on the ball is 
. [During
ascent, 
is positive and the resistance acts downward; during descent, 
is negative and
the resistance acts upward.] So, by Newton’s Second Law, the equation of motion is
Solve this differential equation to show that the velocity is
2. Show that the height of the ball, until it hits the ground, is

In modeling force due to air resistance, 
various functions have been used, depending
on the physical characteristics and speed of
the ball. Here we use a linear model, 
, but
a quadratic model (
on the way up and
on the way down) is another possibility for
higher speeds (see Exercise 50 in Section 7.3).
For a golf ball, experiments have shown that a
good model is 
going up and 
coming down. But no matter which force func-
tion 
is used [where 
for 
and 
for 
], the answer to the
question remains the same. See F. Brauer,
“What Goes Up Must Come Down, Eventually,”

because it’s impossible to solve the equation 
explicitly. We can, however, use an indirect method to determine whether ascent or
descent is faster; we determine whether 
is positive or negative. Show that

One of the models for population growth that we considered in Section 7.1 was based 
on the assumption that the population grows at a rate proportional to the size of the 
population:
Is that a reasonable assumption? Suppose we have a population (of bacteria, for instance)
with size 
and at a certain time it is growing at a rate of 
bacteria per
hour. Now let’s take another 1000 bacteria of the same type and put them with the ﬁrst pop-
ulation. Each half of the new population was growing at a rate of 300 bacteria per hour.
We would expect the total population of 2000 to increase at a rate of 600 bacteria per 
hour initially (provided there’s enough room and nutrition). So if we double the size, we
double the growth rate. In general, it seems reasonable that the growth rate should be pro-
portional to the size.
The same assumption applies in other situations as well. In nuclear physics, the mass
of a radioactive substance decays at a rate proportional to the mass. In chemistry, the rate of
a unimolecular ﬁrst-order reaction is proportional to the concentration of the substance. In
ﬁnance, the value of a savings account with continuously compounded interest increases
at a rate proportional to that value.
In general, if 
is the value of a quantity at time and if the rate of change of with
respect to is proportional to its size 
at any time, then

or the law of natural decay (if

can solve it by the methods of Section 7.3:
where A (
or 0) is an arbitrary constant. To see the signiﬁcance of the constant A,
we observe that
Therefore A is the initial value of the function.
Because Equation 1 occurs so frequently in nature, we summarize what we have just

Population Growth
What is the signiﬁcance of the proportionality constant k? In the context of population
growth, we can write
The quantity
is the growth rate divided by the population size; it is called the relative growth rate.
According to (3), instead of saying “the growth rate is proportional to population size” we
could say “the relative growth rate is constant.” Then (2) says that a population with con-
stant relative growth rate must grow exponentially. Notice that the relative growth rate k
appears as the coefﬁcient of t in the exponential function 
. For instance, if
and t is measured in years, then the relative growth rate is k  0.02 and the population
grows at a relative rate of 2% per year. If the population at time 0 is

Modeling world population with the law of natural growth
Assuming that the
growth rate is proportional to population size, use the data in Table 1 to model the popu-
lation of the world in the 20th century. What is the relative growth rate? How well does
the model ﬁt the data?
SOLUTION We measure the time t in years and let t  0 in the year 1900. We measure the
population 
in millions of people. Then the initial condition is 
We are
assuming that the growth rate is proportional to population size, so the initial-value prob-
lem is
From (2) we know that the solution is
One way to estimate the relative growth rate k is to use the fact that the population in
1950 was 2560 million. Therefore
We solve this equation for k:
Thus the relative growth rate is about 0.88% per year and the model becomes
Table 2 and Figure 1 allow us to compare the predictions of this model with the actual
data. You can see that the predictions become quite inaccurate after about 60 years.

Looking at Figure 1, we might think that we would get a better model by using the
given population for 1970, instead of 1950, to estimate . Then
The estimate for the relative growth rate is now 1.16% per year and the model is
Figure 2 illustrates the second model. This exponential model is more accurate after
1970 but less accurate before 1950.

The model predicts that the population in 2015 will be
The graph in Figure 3 shows that the model is fairly accurate to the turn of the century,
so the estimate for 1993 is quite reliable. But the prediction for 2015 is much riskier.
Radioactive Decay
Radioactive substances decay by spontaneously emitting radiation. If 
is the mass
remaining from an initial mass 
of the substance after time t, then the relative decay rate
has been found experimentally to be constant. (Since 
is negative, the relative decay
rate is positive.) It follows that
where k is a negative constant. In other words, radioactive substances decay at a rate pro-
portional to the remaining mass. This means that we can use (2) to show that the mass
decays exponentially:
Physicists express the rate of decay in terms of half-life, the time required for half of
any given quantity to decay.
The half-life of radium-226 is 1590 years.
(a) A sample of radium-226 has a mass of 100 mg. Find a formula for the mass of

Newton’s Law of Cooling
Newton’s Law of Cooling states that the rate of cooling of an object is proportional to
the temperature difference between the object and its surroundings, provided that this
difference is not too large. (This law also applies to warming.) If we let 
be the 
temperature of the object at time and 
be the temperature of the surroundings, then
we can formulate Newton’s Law of Cooling as a differential equation:
where is a constant. We could solve this equation as a separable differential equation
by the method of Section 7.3, but an easier method is to make the change of variable
. Because 
is constant, we have

half an hour the soda pop has cooled to

(a) What is the temperature of the soda pop after another half hour?
(b) How long does it take for the soda pop to cool to

animal life assimilates C through food chains. When a plant
or animal dies, it stops replacing its carbon and the amount of
C begins to decrease through radioactive decay. Therefore the
level of radioactivity must also decay exponentially.

APPLIED PROJECT
Calculus and Baseball
In this project we explore three of the many applications of calculus to baseball. The physical
interactions of the game, especially the collision of ball and bat, are quite complex and their 
models are discussed in detail in a book by Robert Adair, The Physics of Baseball, 3d ed. 
(New York, 2002).
1. It may surprise you to learn that the collision of baseball and bat lasts only about a thou-
sandth of a second. Here we calculate the average force on the bat during this collision by
ﬁrst computing the change in the ball’s momentum.
The 
of an object is the product of its mass 
and its velocity , that is,
. Suppose an object, moving along a straight line, is acted on by a force 
that is a continuous function of time.
(a) Show that the change in momentum over a time interval 
is equal to the integral 
of 
from 
to ; that is, show that
This integral is called the impulse of the force over the time interval.
(b) A pitcher throws a 90-mih fastball to a batter, who hits a line drive directly back 
to the pitcher. The ball is in contact with the bat for 0.001 s and leaves the bat with
velocity 110 mih. A baseball weighs 5 oz and, in US Customary units, its mass is
measured in slugs: 
where 
.
(i) Find the change in the ball’s momentum.
(ii) Find the average force on the bat.
2. In this problem we calculate the work required for a pitcher to throw a 90-mih fastball by
ﬁrst considering kinetic energy.
The kinetic energy
of an object of mass 
and velocity is given by

pose an object of mass , moving in a straight line, is acted on by a force 
that
depends on its position . According to Newton’s Second Law

CHAPTER 7
DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
In this section we discuss in detail a model for population growth, the logistic model, that
is more sophisticated than exponential growth. In doing so we use all the tools at our dis-
posal—direction ﬁelds and Euler’s method from Section 7.2 and the explicit solution of
separable differential equations from Section 7.3. In the exercises we investigate other 
possible models for population growth, some of which take into account harvesting and
seasonal growth.
The Logistic Model
As we discussed in Section 7.1, a population often increases exponentially in its early
stages but levels off eventually and approaches its carrying capacity because of limited
resources. If 
is the size of the population at time t, we assume that
This says that the growth rate is initially close to being proportional to size. In other words,
the relative growth rate is almost constant when the population is small. But we also want
to reﬂect the fact that the relative growth rate decreases as the population P increases and
becomes negative if P ever exceeds its carrying capacity
, the maximum population that
the environment is capable of sustaining in the long run. The simplest expression for the
relative growth rate that incorporates these assumptions is

(b) How many foot-pounds of work does it take to throw a baseball at a speed of 90 mih?
3. (a) An outﬁelder ﬁelds a baseball 280 ft away from home plate and throws it directly to
the catcher with an initial velocity of 100 fts. Assume that the velocity 
of the ball
after seconds satisﬁes the differential equation 
because of air resist-
ance. How long does it take for the ball to reach home plate? (Ignore any vertical
motion of the ball.)
(b) The manager of the team wonders whether the ball will reach home plate sooner if it 
is relayed by an inﬁelder. The shortstop can position himself directly between the
outﬁelder and home plate, catch the ball thrown by the outﬁelder, turn, and throw the
ball to the catcher with an initial velocity of 105 fts. The manager clocks the relay
time of the shortstop (catching, turning, throwing) at half a second. How far from
home plate should the shortstop position himself to minimize the total time for the 
ball to reach home plate? Should the manager encourage a direct throw or a relayed
throw? What if the shortstop can throw at 115 fts?
;
(c) For what throwing velocity of the shortstop does a relayed throw take the same time 
as a direct throw?

SECTION 7.5
THE LOGISTIC EQUATION
531
Multiplying by P, we obtain the model for population growth known as the logistic differ-
ential equation:
Notice from Equation 1 that if P is small compared with 
, then 
is close to 0 and so
. However, if 
(the population approaches its carrying capacity), then
, so 
. We can deduce information about whether solutions increase or
decrease directly from Equation 1. If the population P lies between 0 and 
, then the right
side of the equation is positive, so 
and the population increases. But if the pop-
ulation exceeds the carrying capacity 
, then 
is negative, so 
and the population decreases.
Direction Fields
Let’s start our more detailed analysis of the logistic differential equation by looking at a
direction ﬁeld.
What a direction ﬁeld tells us about solutions of the logistic equation
Draw a direction ﬁeld for the logistic equation with 
and carrying capacity
. What can you deduce about the solutions?
SOLUTION In this case the logistic differential equation is
A direction ﬁeld for this equation is shown in Figure 1. We show only the ﬁrst quadrant
because negative populations aren’t meaningful and we are interested only in what hap-
pens after 
.
The logistic equation is autonomous (
depends only on P, not on t), so the
slopes are the same along any horizontal line. As expected, the slopes are positive for
and negative for 
.
The slopes are small when P is close to 0 or 1000 (the carrying capacity). Notice that
the solutions move away from the equilibrium solution 
and move toward the
equilibrium solution

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
In Figure 2 we use the direction ﬁeld to sketch solution curves with initial populations
, 
, and 
. Notice that solution curves that start below
are increasing and those that start above 
are decreasing. The slopes
are greatest when 
and therefore the solution curves that start below 
have inﬂection points when 
. In fact we can prove that all solution curves that
start below 
have an inﬂection point when P is exactly 500. (See Exercise 11.)
Euler’s Method
Next let’s use Euler’s method to obtain numerical estimates for solutions of the logistic dif-
ferential equation at speciﬁc times.
Use Euler’s method with step sizes 20, 10, 5, 1, and 0.1 to estimate the
population sizes 
and 
, where P is the solution of the initial-value problem
SOLUTION With step size

we get, using the notation of Section 7.2,
Thus our estimates for the population sizes at times

Comparison of the Natural Growth and Logistic Models
In the 1930s the biologist G. F. Gause conducted an experiment with the protozoan Para-
mecium and used a logistic equation to model his data. The table gives his daily count of
the population of protozoa. He estimated the initial relative growth rate to be 0.7944 and
the carrying capacity to be 64.
Find the exponential and logistic models for Gause’s data. Compare the 
predicted values with the observed values and comment on the ﬁt.

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Gause used the same value of k for his logistic model. [This is reasonable because
is small compared with the carrying capacity (
). The equation
shows that the value of k for the logistic model is very close to the value for the expo-
nential model.]
Then the solution of the logistic equation in Equation 4 gives
where
So
We use these equations to calculate the predicted values (rounded to the nearest integer)
and compare them in the following table.
We notice from the table and from the graph in Figure 5 that for the ﬁrst three or four
days the exponential model gives results comparable to those of the more sophisticated
logistic model. For 
, however, the exponential model is hopelessly inaccurate, but
the logistic model ﬁts the observations reasonably well.
Many countries that formerly experienced exponential growth are now ﬁnding that their
rates of population growth are declining and the logistic model provides a better model.

The table in the margin shows midyear values of 
, the population of Belgium, in thou-
sands, at time , from 1980 to 2000. Figure 6 shows these data points together with a shift-
ed logistic function obtained from a calculator with the ability to ﬁt a logistic function to
these points by regression. We see that the logistic model provides a very good ﬁt.
Other Models for Population Growth
The Law of Natural Growth and the logistic differential equation are not the only equa-
tions that have been proposed to model population growth. In Exercise 18 we look at the
Gompertz growth function and in Exercises 19 and 20 we investigate seasonal-growth
models.
Two of the other models are modiﬁcations of the logistic model. The differential 
equation
has been used to model populations that are subject to “harvesting” of one sort or another.
(Think of a population of ﬁsh being caught at a constant rate.) This equation is explored
in Exercises 15 and 16.
For some species there is a minimum population level m below which the species tends
to become extinct. (Adults may not be able to ﬁnd suitable mates.) Such populations have
been modeled by the differential equation
where the extra factor, 
, takes into account the consequences of a sparse popula-
tion (see Exercise 17).

We have looked at a variety of models for the growth of a single species that lives alone in
an environment. In this section we consider more realistic models that take into account
the interaction of two species in the same habitat. We will see that these models take the
form of a pair of linked differential equations.
We ﬁrst consider the situation in which one species, called the prey, has an ample food
supply and the second species, called the predators, feeds on the prey. Examples of prey
and predators include rabbits and wolves in an isolated forest, food ﬁsh and sharks, aphids
and ladybugs, and bacteria and amoebas. Our model will have two dependent variables and
both are functions of time. We let 
be the number of prey (using R for rabbits) and 
be the number of predators (with W for wolves) at time t.

In the absence of predators, the ample food supply would support exponential growth
of the prey, that is,
In the absence of prey, we assume that the predator population would decline at a rate pro-
portional to itself, that is,
With both species present, however, we assume that the principal cause of death among the
prey is being eaten by a predator, and the birth and survival rates of the predators depend
on their available food supply, namely, the prey. We also assume that the two species
encounter each other at a rate that is proportional to both populations and is therefore pro-
portional to the product RW. (The more there are of either population, the more encoun-
ters there are likely to be.) A system of two differential equations that incorporates these
assumptions is as follows:
where k, r, a, and b are positive constants. Notice that the term aRW decreases the nat-
ural growth rate of the prey and the term bRW increases the natural growth rate of the 
predators.
The equations in (1) are known as the predator-prey equations, or the Lotka-Volterra
equations. A solution of this system of equations is a pair of functions 
and 
that
describe the populations of prey and predator as functions of time. Because the system is
coupled (R and W occur in both equations), we can’t solve one equation and then the other;
we have to solve them simultaneously. Unfortunately, it is usually impossible to ﬁnd
explicit formulas for R and W as functions of t. We can, however, use graphical methods
to analyze the equations.
Suppose that populations of rabbits and wolves are described by the
Lotka-Volterra equations (1) with 
, 
, 
, and 
. The
time is measured in months.
(a) Find the constant solutions (called the equilibrium solutions) and interpret 
the answer.
(b) Use the system of differential equations to ﬁnd an expression for

(c) Draw a direction ﬁeld for the resulting differential equation in the RW-plane. Then
use that direction ﬁeld to sketch some solution curves.
(d) Suppose that, at some point in time, there are 1000 rabbits and 40 wolves. Draw the
corresponding solution curve and use it to describe the changes in both population levels.
(e) Use part (d) to make sketches of R and W as functions of t.

Both 
and 
will be constant if both derivatives are 0, that is,
One solution is given by 
and 
. (This makes sense: If there are no rabbits or
wolves, the populations are certainly not going to increase.) The other constant solution is
So the equilibrium populations consist of 80 wolves and 1000 rabbits. This means that
1000 rabbits are just enough to support a constant wolf population of 80. There are nei-
ther too many wolves (which would result in fewer rabbits) nor too few wolves (which
would result in more rabbits).
(b) We use the Chain Rule to eliminate t:
so
(c) If we think of 
as a function of , we have the differential equation
We draw the direction ﬁeld for this differential equation in Figure 1 and we use it to
sketch several solution curves in Figure 2. If we move along a solution curve, we
observe how the relationship between R and W changes as time passes. Notice that the
curves appear to be closed in the sense that if we travel along a curve, we always return
to the same point. Notice also that the point (1000, 80) is inside all the solution curves.
That point is called an equilibrium point because it corresponds to the equilibrium solu-
tion 
, 
.
When we represent solutions of a system of differential equations as in Figure 2, we
refer to the RW-plane as the phase plane, and we call the solution curves phase trajec-
tories. So a phase trajectory is a path traced out by solutions 
as time goes by.

A phase portrait consists of equilibrium points and typical phase trajectories, as shown
in Figure 2.
(d) Starting with 1000 rabbits and 40 wolves corresponds to drawing the solution curve
through the point 
. Figure 3 shows this phase trajectory with the direction
ﬁeld removed. Starting at the point 
at time
and letting t increase, do we move
clockwise or counterclockwise around the phase trajectory? If we put 
and
in the ﬁrst differential equation, we get
Since 
, we conclude that 
is increasing at 
and so we move counter-
clockwise around the phase trajectory.
We see that at 
there aren’t enough wolves to maintain a balance between the popu-
lations, so the rabbit population increases. That results in more wolves and eventually
there are so many wolves that the rabbits have a hard time avoiding them. So the number
of rabbits begins to decline (at 
, where we estimate that R reaches its maximum popu-
lation of about 2800). This means that at some later time the wolf population starts to
fall (at 
, where 
and 
). But this beneﬁts the rabbits, so their popula-
tion later starts to increase (at 
, where 
and 
). As a consequence, the
wolf population eventually starts to increase as well. This happens when the populations
return to their initial values of 
and 
, and the entire cycle begins again.

we can sketch the graphs of

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
To make the graphs easier to compare, we draw the graphs on the same axes but with
different scales for 
and 
, as in Figure 5. Notice that the rabbits reach their maximum
populations about a quarter of a cycle before the wolves.
An important part of the modeling process, as we discussed in Section 1.2, is to inter-
pret our mathematical conclusions as real-world predictions and to test the predictions
against real data. The Hudson’s Bay Company, which started trading in animal furs in
Canada in 1670, has kept records that date back to the 1840s. Figure 6 shows graphs of the
number of pelts of the snowshoe hare and its predator, the Canada lynx, traded by the com-
pany over a 90-year period. You can see that the coupled oscillations in the hare and lynx
populations predicted by the Lotka-Volterra model do actually occur and the period of
these cycles is roughly 10 years.
Although the relatively simple Lotka-Volterra model has had some success in explain-
ing and predicting coupled populations, more sophisticated models have also been pro-
posed. One way to modify the Lotka-Volterra equations is to assume that, in the absence
of predators, the prey grow according to a logistic model with carrying capacity M. Then
the Lotka-Volterra equations (1) are replaced by the system of differential equations
This model is investigated in Exercises 11 and 12.

Inﬁnite Sequences and Series
Inﬁnite sequences and series were introduced brieﬂy in A Preview of Calculus
in connection with Zeno’s paradoxes and the decimal representation of numbers.
Their importance in calculus stems from Newton’s idea of representing functions
as sums of inﬁnite series. For instance, in ﬁnding areas he often integrated a
function by ﬁrst expressing it as a series and then integrating each term of the
series. We will pursue his idea in Section 8.7 in order to integrate such functions
as 
. (Recall that we have previously been unable to do this.) Many of the
functions that arise in mathematical physics and chemistry, such as Bessel func-
tions, are deﬁned as sums of series, so it is important to be familiar with the
basic concepts of convergence of inﬁnite sequences and series.
Physicists also use series in another way, as we will see in Section 8.8. In 
studying ﬁelds as diverse as optics, special relativity, and electromagnetism, they
analyze phenomena by replacing a function with the ﬁrst few terms in the series
that represents it.

CHAPTER 8
INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
A sequence can be thought of as a list of numbers written in a deﬁnite order:
The number 
is called the ﬁrst term,
is the second term, and in general 
is the nth
term. We will deal exclusively with inﬁnite sequences and so each term 
will have a 
successor 
.
Notice that for every positive integer 
there is a corresponding number 
and so a
sequence can be deﬁned as a function whose domain is the set of positive integers. But we
usually write 
instead of the function notation 
for the value of the function at the
number .
Notation: The sequence {
, 
, 
, . . .} is also denoted by
Describing sequences
Some sequences can be deﬁned by giving a formula
for the nth term. In the following examples we give three descriptions of the sequence:
one by using the preceding notation, another by using the deﬁning formula, and a third
by writing out the terms of the sequence. Notice that doesn’t have to start at 1.

(d)
Find a formula for the general term 
of the sequence
assuming that the pattern of the ﬁrst few terms continues.
SOLUTION We are given that

so we need to multiply by a power of

Here are some sequences that don’t have simple deﬁning equations.

This sequence arose when the 13th-century Italian mathematician known as Fibonacci
solved a problem concerning the breeding of rabbits (see Exercise 47).
A sequence such as the one in Example 1(a), 
, can be pictured either by
plotting its terms on a number line, as in Figure 1, or by plotting its graph, as in Figure 2.
Note that, since a sequence is a function whose domain is the set of positive integers, its
graph consists of isolated points with coordinates
. . .
. . .
From Figure 1 or Figure 2 it appears that the terms of the sequence 
are
approaching 1 as becomes large. In fact, the difference
can be made as small as we like by taking sufﬁciently large. We indicate this by writing
In general, the notation
means that the terms of the sequence 
approach 
as 
becomes large. Notice that the
following deﬁnition of the limit of a sequence is very similar to the deﬁnition of a limit of

INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
Deﬁnition A sequence 
has the limit
and we write
if we can make the terms 
as close to 
as we like by taking sufﬁciently large.
If 
exists, we say the sequence converges (or is convergent). Otherwise,
we say the sequence diverges (or is divergent).
Figure 3 illustrates Deﬁnition 1 by showing the graphs of two sequences that have the
limit .
If you compare Deﬁnition 1 with Deﬁnition 2.5.4 you will see that the only difference
between 
and 
is that 
is required to be an integer. Thus
we have the following theorem, which is illustrated by Figure 4.
Theorem If 
and 
when is an integer, then 
.
In particular, since we know from Section 2.5 that 
when 
we
have
if
If 
becomes large as n becomes large, we use the notation
In this case the sequence 
is divergent, but in a special way. We say that 
diverges
to .
The Limit Laws given in Section 2.3 also hold for the limits of sequences and their
proofs are similar.

The graph of this sequence is shown in Figure 6. Since the terms oscillate between 1 and

Creating Graphs of Sequences
Some computer algebra systems have special
commands that enable us to create sequences
and graph them directly. With most graphing
calculators, however, sequences can be graphed
by using parametric equations. For instance, 
the sequence in Example 9 can be graphed by
entering the parametric equations
and graphing in dot mode, starting with 
and setting the -step equal to . The result is
shown in Figure 8.

, that is,
It is called decreasing if

The sequence

and so

Show that the sequence

This inequality is equivalent to the one we get by cross-multiplication:
Since

so

Thus

Deﬁnition A sequence

It is bounded below if there is a number 
such that
If it is bounded above and below, then 
is a bounded sequence.
For instance, the sequence 
is bounded below 
but not above. The
sequence 
is bounded because 
for all .
We know that not every bounded sequence is convergent [for instance, the sequence
satisﬁes 
but is divergent, from Example 6] and not every mono-
tonic sequence is convergent 
. But if a sequence is both bounded and
monotonic, then it must be convergent. This fact is stated without proof as Theorem 8, but
intuitively you can understand why it is true by looking at Figure 10. If

for all , then the terms are forced to crowd together and approach some num-
ber .

for all by induction.
Next we verify that

sequence is increasing, we already know that it has a lower bound: 
for 
all .) We know that

Thus
This shows, by mathematical induction, that

Since the sequence 
is increasing and bounded, the Monotonic Sequence Theorem
guarantees that it has a limit. The theorem doesn’t tell us what the value of the limit is.
But now that we know 
exists, we can use the given recurrence relation to
write
Since

Logistic Sequences
A sequence that arises in ecology as a model for population growth is deﬁned by the logistic 
difference equation
where
measures the size of the population of the 
generation of a single species. To keep
the numbers manageable,
is a fraction of the maximal size of the population, so 
.
Notice that the form of this equation is similar to the logistic differential equation in Section 7.5.
The discrete model—with sequences instead of continuous functions—is preferable for modeling
insect populations, where mating and death occur in a periodic fashion.
An ecologist is interested in predicting the size of the population as time goes on, and asks 
these questions: Will it stabilize at a limiting value? Will it change in a cyclical fashion? Or will 
it exhibit random behavior?
Write a program to compute the ﬁrst terms of this sequence starting with an initial popula-
tion 
. Use this program to do the following.
1. Calculate 20 or 30 terms of the sequence for 
and for two values of such that
. Graph each sequence. Do the sequences appear to converge? Repeat for a dif-
ferent value of 
between 0 and 1. Does the limit depend on the choice of 
? Does it
depend on the choice of ?
2. Calculate terms of the sequence for a value of between 3 and 3.4 and plot them. What do
you notice about the behavior of the terms?

What do we mean when we express a number as an inﬁnite decimal? For instance, what
does it mean to write
The convention behind our decimal notation is that any number can be written as an inﬁ-
nite sum. Here it means that
where the three dots 
indicate that the sum continues forever, and the more terms we
add, the closer we get to the actual value of .
In general, if we try to add the terms of an inﬁnite sequence 
we get an expres-
sion of the form
which is called an inﬁnite series (or just a series) and is denoted, for short, by the symbol
Does it make sense to talk about the sum of inﬁnitely many terms?
It would be impossible to ﬁnd a ﬁnite sum for the series
because if we start adding the terms we get the cumulative sums 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, . . .
and, after the 
term, we get 
, which becomes very large as increases.
However, if we start to add the terms of the series
we get , , , , , , . . . , 
, . . . . The table shows that as we add more and more
terms, these partial sums become closer and closer to 1. (See also Figure 11 in A Preview
of Calculus, page 8.) In fact, by adding sufﬁciently many terms of the series we can make
the partial sums as close as we like to 1. So it seems reasonable to say that the sum of this
inﬁnite series is 1 and to write

CHAPTER 8
INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
We use a similar idea to determine whether or not a general series (1) has a sum. We
consider the partial sums
and, in general,
These partial sums form a new sequence 
, which may or may not have a limit. If
exists (as a ﬁnite number), then, as in the preceding example, we call it the
sum of the inﬁnite series 
.
Deﬁnition Given a series 
, let 
denote its 
th partial sum:
If the sequence 
is convergent and 
exists as a real number, then
the series 
is called convergent and we write
The number is called the sum of the series. If the sequence 
is divergent, then the
series is called divergent.
Thus the sum of a series is the limit of the sequence of partial sums. So when we write
we mean that by adding sufﬁciently many terms of the series we can get as
close as we like to the number . Notice that
An important example of an inﬁnite series is the geometric series
Each term is obtained from the preceding one by multiplying it by the common ratio .
(We have already considered the special case where 
and 
on page 565.)
If 
, then

doesn’t exist, the
geometric series diverges in this case.

What do we really mean when we say that the
sum of the series in Example 2 is ? Of course,
we can’t literally add an inﬁnite number of
terms, one by one. But, according to Deﬁni-
tion 2, the total sum is the limit of the
sequence of partial sums. So, by taking the
sum of sufﬁciently many terms, we can get as
close as we like to the number . The table

Notice that the terms cancel in pairs. 
This is an example of a telescoping sum:
Because of all the cancellations, the sum 
collapses (like a pirate’s collapsing 
telescope) into just two terms.

ing the graphs of the sequence of terms
and the sequence

The method used in Example 7 for showing
that the harmonic series diverges is due to the
French scholar Nicole Oresme (1323–1382).

Theorem If the series 
is convergent, then 
.
PROOF Let 
. Then 
. Since 
is convergent, the
sequence 
is convergent. Let 
. Since 
as 
, we also
have 
. Therefore
Note 1: With any series
we associate two sequences: the sequence 
of its par-
tial sums and the sequence 
of its terms. If 
is convergent, then the limit of the
sequence 
is 
(the sum of the series) and, as Theorem 6 asserts, the limit of the
sequence 
is 0.
|
Note 2: The converse of Theorem 6 is not true in general. If 
, we cannot
conclude that 
is convergent. Observe that for the harmonic series 
we have
as 
, but we showed in Example 7 that 
is divergent.
The Test for Divergence If 
does not exist or if 
, then the
series 
is divergent.
The Test for Divergence follows from Theorem 6 because, if the series is not divergent,
then it is convergent, and so 
.
Using the Test for Divergence
Show that the series 
diverges.
SOLUTION
So the series diverges by the Test for Divergence.
Note 3: If we ﬁnd that 
, we know that 
is divergent. If we ﬁnd that
, we know nothing about the convergence or divergence of 
. Remember
the warning in Note 2: If 
, the series 
might converge or it might
diverge.
Theorem If 
and 
are convergent series, then so are the series 
(where is a constant), 
, and 
, and

Let
The nth partial sum for the series

Find the sum of the series

SOLUTION The series 
is a geometric series with

In Example 6 we found that
So, by Theorem 8, the given series is convergent and

51. When money is spent on goods and services, those who
receive the money also spend some of it. The people receiv-
ing some of the twice-spent money will spend some of that,
and so on. Economists call this chain reaction the multiplier
effect. In a hypothetical isolated community, the local gov-
ernment begins the process by spending 
dollars. Suppose
that each recipient of spent money spends 
and saves
of the money that he or she receives. The values 
and s are called the marginal propensity to consume and the
marginal propensity to save and, of course, 
.
(a) Let 
be the total spending that has been generated after 
transactions. Find an equation for

(b) Show that

large percentage of the money that they receive in deposits.

65. The Cantor set, named after the German mathematician Georg
Cantor (1845–1918), is constructed as follows. We start with
the closed interval 
and remove the open interval 
. 
That leaves the two intervals 
and 
and we remove
the open middle third of each. Four intervals remain and again
we remove the open middle third of each of them. We continue
this procedure indeﬁnitely, at each step removing the open 
middle third of every interval that remains from the preceding
step. The Cantor set consists of the numbers that remain in
after all those intervals have been removed.
(a) Show that the total length of all the intervals that are
removed is 1. Despite that, the Cantor set contains inﬁ-
nitely many numbers. Give examples of some numbers in
the Cantor set.
(b) The Sierpinski carpet is a two-dimensional counterpart of
the Cantor set. It is constructed by removing the center one-
ninth of a square of side 1, then removing the centers of the
eight smaller remaining squares, and so on. (The ﬁgure
shows the ﬁrst three steps of the construction.) Show that
the sum of the areas of the removed squares is 1. This
implies that the Sierpinski carpet has area 0.

circles and sides of the triangle. If the triangle has sides of
length 1, ﬁnd the total area occupied by the circles.
In general, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd the exact sum of a series. We were able to accomplish this
for geometric series and the series 
because in each of those cases we could
ﬁnd a simple formula for the 
partial sum 
. But usually it isn’t easy to compute
. Therefore in this section and the next we develop tests that enable us to 
determine whether a series is convergent or divergent without explicitly ﬁnding its sum. 
In some cases, however, our methods will enable us to ﬁnd good estimates of the sum.
In this section we deal only with series with positive terms, so the partial sums are in-
creasing. In view of the Monotonic Sequence Theorem, to decide whether a series is con-
vergent or divergent, we need to determine whether the partial sums are bounded or not.
Testing with an Integral
Let’s investigate the series whose terms are the reciprocals of the squares of the positive
integers:
There’s no simple formula for the sum 
of the ﬁrst 
terms, but the computer-generated
table of values given in the margin suggests that the partial sums are approaching a num-
ber near 1.64 as 
and so it looks as if the series is convergent.
We can conﬁrm this impression with a geometric argument. Figure 1 shows the curve
and rectangles that lie below the curve. The base of each rectangle is an interval
of length 1; the height is equal to the value of the function 
at the right endpoint
of the interval.

INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
So the sum of the areas of the rectangles is
If we exclude the ﬁrst rectangle, the total area of the remaining rectangles is smaller
than the area under the curve 
for 
, which is the value of the integral
. In Section 5.10 we discovered that this improper integral is convergent and
has value 1. So the picture shows that all the partial sums are less than
Thus the partial sums are bounded and the series converges. The sum of the series (the
limit of the partial sums) is also less than 2:
[The exact sum of this series was found by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler
(1707–1783) to be 
, but the proof of this fact is beyond the scope of this book.]
Now let’s look at the series
The table of values of 
suggests that the partial sums aren’t approaching a ﬁnite number,
so we suspect that the given series may be divergent. Again we use a picture for conﬁrma-
tion. Figure 2 shows the curve 
, but this time we use rectangles whose tops lie
above the curve.
The base of each rectangle is an interval of length 1. The height is equal to the value of
the function 
at the left endpoint of the interval. So the sum of the areas of all
the rectangles is
This total area is greater than the area under the curve 
for 
, which is equal
to the integral 
. But we know from Section 5.10 that this improper integral is
divergent. In other words, the area under the curve is inﬁnite. So the sum of the series must
be inﬁnite, that is, the series is divergent.

THE INTEGRAL AND COMPARISON TESTS; ESTIMATING SUMS

The same sort of geometric reasoning that we used for these two series can be used to
prove the following test.
The Integral Test Suppose 
is a continuous, positive, decreasing function on 
and let 
. Then the series 
is convergent if and only if the improper
integral 
is convergent. In other words:
(a) If 
is convergent, then 
is convergent.
(b) If 
is divergent, then 
is divergent.
Note: When we use the Integral Test it is not necessary to start the series or the integral
at 
. For instance, in testing the series
Also, it is not necessary that 
be always decreasing. What is important is that 
be ulti-
mately decreasing, that is, decreasing for 
larger than some number . Then

convergent, so 
is convergent by Note 4 of Section 8.2.
Using the Integral Test
Determine whether the series 
converges or diverges.
SOLUTION The function 
is positive and continuous for 
because the
logarithm function is continuous. But it is not obvious whether or not 
is decreasing, so
we compute its derivative:
Thus 
when 
, that is, 
. It follows that 
is decreasing when 
and so we can apply the Integral Test:
Since this improper integral is divergent, the series 
is also divergent by the
Integral Test.
Convergence of the -series
For what values of 
is the series 
convergent?
SOLUTION If 
, then 
. If 
, then 
. In
either case 
, so the given series diverges by the Test for Divergence
[see (8.2.7)].

CHAPTER 8
INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
If 
, then the function 
is clearly continuous, positive, and decreasing
on 
. We found in Chapter 5 [see (5.10.2)] that
It follows from the Integral Test that the series 
converges if 
and diverges if
. (For 
, this series is the harmonic series discussed in Example 7 in
Section 8.2.)
The series in Example 2 is called the p-series. It is important in the rest of this chapter,
so we summarize the results of Example 2 for future reference as follows.
The -series 
is convergent if 
and divergent if 
.
For instance, the series
is convergent because it is a p-series with 
. But the series
is divergent because it is a p-series with 
.
Testing by Comparing
The series
reminds us of the series 
, which is a geometric series with 
and 
and is
therefore convergent. Because the series (2) is so similar to a convergent series, we have
the feeling that it too must be convergent. Indeed, it is. The inequality
shows that our given series (2) has smaller terms than those of the geometric series and
therefore all its partial sums are also smaller than 1 (the sum of the geometric series). This
means that its partial sums form a bounded increasing sequence, which is convergent. It
also follows that the sum of the series is less than the sum of the geometric series:
Similar reasoning can be used to prove the following test, which applies only to series
whose terms are positive. The ﬁrst part says that if we have a series whose terms are 
smaller than those of a known convergent series, then our series is also convergent. The

second part says that if we start with a series whose terms are larger than those of a known
divergent series, then it too is divergent.
The Comparison Test Suppose that 
and 
are series with positive terms.
(a) If 
is convergent and 
for all , then 
is also convergent.
(b) If 
is divergent and 
for all , then 
is also divergent.
In using the Comparison Test we must, of course, have some known series 
for the
purpose of comparison. Most of the time we use one of these series: 
■A 
-series [
converges if 
and diverges if 
; see (1)]
■A geometric series [
converges if 
and diverges if 
; 
see (8.2.4)]
Using the Comparison Test
Determine whether the series 
converges or diverges.
SOLUTION For large the dominant term in the denominator is 
, so we compare the
given series with the series 
. Observe that
because the left side has a bigger denominator. (In the notation of the Comparison Test,
is the left side and 
is the right side.) We know that
is convergent because it’s a constant times a -series with 
. Therefore
is convergent by part (a) of the Comparison Test.
Although the condition 
or 
in the Comparison Test is given for all , we
need verify only that it holds for 
, where 
is some ﬁxed integer, because the con-
vergence of a series is not affected by a ﬁnite number of terms. This is illustrated in the
next example.
Test the series 
for convergence or divergence.
SOLUTION We used the Integral Test to test this series in Example 1, but we can also test
it by comparing it with the harmonic series. Observe that 
for 
and so
We know that 
is divergent ( -series with 
). Thus the given series is divergent
by the Comparison Test.

Standard Series for Use

CHAPTER 8
INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
Note: The terms of the series being tested must be smaller than those of a convergent
series or larger than those of a divergent series. If the terms are larger than the terms of a
convergent series or smaller than those of a divergent series, then the Comparison Test
doesn’t apply. Consider, for instance, the series
The inequality
is useless as far as the Comparison Test is concerned because 
is convergent
and 
. Nonetheless, we have the feeling that 
ought to be convergent
because it is very similar to the convergent geometric series 
. In such cases the fol-
lowing test can be used.
The Limit Comparison Test Suppose that 
and 
are series with positive 
terms. If
where c is a ﬁnite number and 
, then either both series converge or both
diverge.
Although we won’t prove the Limit Comparison Test, it seems reasonable because for
large 
.
Using the Limit Comparison Test
Test the series 
for convergence or divergence.
SOLUTION We use the Limit Comparison Test with
and obtain
Since this limit exists and 
is a convergent geometric series, the given series con-
verges by the Limit Comparison Test.
Estimating the Sum of a Series
Suppose we have been able to use the Integral Test to show that a series 
is convergent
and we now want to ﬁnd an approximation to the sum of the series. Of course, any par-
tial sum 
is an approximation to because 
. But how good is such an approx-
imation? To ﬁnd out, we need to estimate the size of the remainder

The remainder

approximation to the total sum.
We use the same notation and ideas as in the Integral Test, assuming that 
is decreas-
ing on

Similarly, we see from Figure 4 that

Solving this inequality, we get
We need 32 terms to ensure accuracy to within 
.
If we add 
to each side of the inequalities in (3), we get
because 
. The inequalities in (4) give a lower bound and an upper bound for .
They provide a more accurate approximation to the sum of the series than the partial sum
does.
An improved estimate
Use (4) with 
to estimate the sum of the series 
.
SOLUTION The inequalities in (4) become
From Example 6 we know that
so
Using 
, we get
If we approximate by the midpoint of this interval, then the error is at most half the
length of the interval. So
If we compare Example 7 with Example 6, we see that the improved estimate in (4) can
be much better than the estimate 
. To make the error smaller than 
we had to
use 32 terms in Example 6 but only 10 terms in Example 7.
If we have used the Comparison Test to show that a series 
converges by compari-
son with a series 
, then we may be able to estimate the sum 
by comparing remain-
ders, as the following example shows.

The convergence tests that we have looked at so far apply only to series with positive
terms. In this section we learn how to deal with series whose terms are not necessarily 
positive.
Alternating Series
An alternating series is a series whose terms are alternately positive and negative. Here
are two examples:
We see from these examples that the 
term of an alternating series is of the form
where 
is a positive number. (In fact, 
.)
The following test says that if the terms of an alternating series decrease to 0 in absolute
value, then the series converges.
The Alternating Series Test If the alternating series
satisﬁes
(i)
(ii)
then the series is convergent.
We won’t present a formal proof of this test, but Figure 1 gives a picture of the idea
behind the proof.
We ﬁrst plot 
on a number line. To ﬁnd 
we subtract 
, so 
is to the left of .
Then to ﬁnd 
we add 
, so 
is to the right of . But, since 
, 
is to the left of
. Continuing in this manner, we see that the partial sums oscillate back and forth. Since
, the successive steps are becoming smaller and smaller. The even partial sums ,
, 
, . . . are increasing and the odd partial sums 
, 
, 
, . . . are decreasing. Thus it
seems plausible that both are converging to some number , which is the sum of the series.

INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
Using the Alternating Series Test
The alternating harmonic series
satisﬁes
(i)
because
(ii)
so the series is convergent by the Alternating Series Test.
An alternating series for which the Alternating Series Test fails
The series 
is alternating, but
so condition (ii) is not satisﬁed. Instead, we look at the limit of the
term of the series:
This limit does not exist, so the series diverges by the Test for Divergence.
Test the series 
for convergence or divergence.
SOLUTION The given series is alternating so we try to verify conditions (i) and (ii) of the
Alternating Series Test.
Unlike the situation in Example 1, it is not obvious that the sequence given by
is decreasing. However, if we consider the related function
, we ﬁnd that
Since we are considering only positive , we see that 
if

. Thus

. This means that 
and therefore 
when 
. (The inequality 
can be veriﬁed directly but
all that really matters is that the sequence 
is eventually decreasing.)
Condition (ii) is readily veriﬁed:
Thus the given series is convergent by the Alternating Series Test.

The error involved in using the partial sum 
as an approximation to the total sum is
the remainder 
. The next theorem says that for series that satisfy the conditions
of the Alternating Series Test, the size of the error is smaller than 
, which is the abso-
lute value of the ﬁrst neglected term.

series that satisﬁes

To get a feel for how many terms we need to use in our approximation, let’s write out
the ﬁrst few terms of the series:

By the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem we know that
This error of less than 
does not affect the third decimal place, so we have
correct to three decimal places.

Note: The rule that the error (in using 
to approximate ) is smaller than the ﬁrst 
neglected term is, in general, valid only for alternating series that satisfy the conditions of
the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem. The rule does not apply to other types of
series.

CHAPTER 8
INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
Absolute Convergence
Given any series 
, we can consider the corresponding series
whose terms are the absolute values of the terms of the original series.
Deﬁnition A series 
is called absolutely convergent if the series of absolute
values 
is convergent.
Notice that if 
is a series with positive terms, then 
and so absolute con-
vergence is the same as convergence.
Determining absolute convergence
The series
is absolutely convergent because
is a convergent -series (
).
A series that is convergent but not absolutely convergent
We know that the alternating harmonic series
is convergent (see Example 1), but it is not absolutely convergent because the correspond-
ing series of absolute values is
which is the harmonic series ( -series with 
) and is therefore divergent.
Example 6 shows that it is possible for a series to be convergent but not absolutely con-
vergent. However, Theorem 1 shows that absolute convergence implies convergence.
Theorem If a series 
is absolutely convergent, then it is convergent.
To see why Theorem 1 is true, observe that the inequality

We have convergence tests for series with
positive terms and for alternating series. But
what if the signs of the terms switch back and
forth irregularly? We will see in Example 7 that
the idea of absolute convergence sometimes
helps in such cases.

is either 
or

is absolutely convergent, then 
is
convergent, so 
is convergent. Therefore, by the Comparison Test,

is the difference of two convergent series and is therefore convergent.
Determine whether the series
is convergent or divergent.
SOLUTION This series has both positive and negative terms, but it is not alternating. 
(The ﬁrst term is positive, the next three are negative, and the following three are posi-
tive. The signs change irregularly.) We can apply the Comparison Test to the series of
absolute values
Since 
for all , we have
We know that 
is convergent ( -series with 
) and therefore 
is
convergent by the Comparison Test. Thus the given series 
is absolutely
convergent and therefore convergent by Theorem 1.
The Ratio Test
The following test is very useful in determining whether a given series is absolutely 
convergent.
The Ratio Test
(i) If 
, then the series 
is absolutely convergent 
(and therefore convergent).
(ii) If 
or
, then the series 
is divergent.
(iii) If 
, the Ratio Test is inconclusive; that is, no conclusion can
be drawn about the convergence or divergence of 
.
The Ratio Test can be proved by comparing the given series to a geometric series. It’s
understandable that geometric series are involved because, for those series, the ratio of

Test, the ratio of consecutive terms isn’t constant but 
so, for large ,
is almost constant and the series converges if

Note: Part (iii) of the Ratio Test says that if

information. For instance, for the convergent series

Therefore, if

might converge or it might diverge. In
this case the Ratio Test fails and we must use some other test.
Using the Ratio Test
Test the series

SOLUTION We use the Ratio Test with

Thus, by the Ratio Test, the given series is absolutely convergent and therefore 
convergent.
Test the convergence of the series

SOLUTION Since the terms

A power series is a series of the form
where is a variable and the ’s are constants called the coefﬁcients of the series. For each
ﬁxed , the series (1) is a series of constants that we can test for convergence or divergence.
A power series may converge for some values of and diverge for other values of . The
sum of the series is a function
whose domain is the set of all 
for which the series converges. Notice that 
resembles a
polynomial. The only difference is that 
has inﬁnitely many terms.

For instance, if we take 
for all , the power series becomes the geometric series
which converges when 
and diverges when 
. (See Equation 8.2.5.)
More generally, a series of the form
is called a power series in 
or a power series centered at a or a power series
about a. Notice that in writing out the term corresponding to 
in Equations 1 and 2
we have adopted the convention that

all of the terms are 0 for

A power series that converges only at its center
For what values of is the series 
convergent?
SOLUTION We use the Ratio Test. If we let 
, as usual, denote the nth term of the series,
then 
. If 
, we have
By the Ratio Test, the series diverges when 
. Thus the given series converges only
when

Using the Ratio Test to determine where a power series converges
For what values of does the series 
converge?
SOLUTION Let 
. Then
By the Ratio Test, the given series is absolutely convergent, and therefore convergent,
when 
and divergent when 
. Now
so the series converges when 
and diverges when 
or 
.
The Ratio Test gives no information when 
so we must consider 
and 
separately. If we put 
in the series, it becomes

series, which is divergent. If 
, the series is

CHAPTER 8
INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
We will see that the main use of a power series is that it provides a way to represent
some of the most important functions that arise in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. In
particular, the sum of the power series in the next example is called a Bessel function, after
the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel (1784–1846), and the function given in Exer-
cise 29 is another example of a Bessel function. In fact, these functions ﬁrst arose when
Bessel solved Kepler’s equation for describing planetary motion. Since that time, these
functions have been applied in many different physical situations, including the tempera-
ture distribution in a circular plate and the shape of a vibrating drumhead.
A power series that converges for all values of 
Find the domain of the
Bessel function of order 0 deﬁned by
SOLUTION Let 
. Then
Thus, by the Ratio Test, the given series converges for all values of . In other words, the
domain of the Bessel function 
is 
.
Recall that the sum of a series is equal to the limit of the sequence of partial sums. So
when we deﬁne the Bessel function in Example 3 as the sum of a series we mean that, for
every real number ,
where
The ﬁrst few partial sums are
Figure 1 shows the graphs of these partial sums, which are polynomials. They are all
approximations to the function 
, but notice that the approximations become better when
more terms are included. Figure 2 shows a more complete graph of the Bessel function.
For the power series that we have looked at so far, the set of values of 
for which the
series is convergent has always turned out to be an interval [a ﬁnite interval for the geo-
metric series and the series in Example 2, the inﬁnite interval 
in Example 3, and
a collapsed interval 
in Example 1]. The following theorem, which we won’t
prove, says that this is true in general.

Theorem For a given power series 
there are only three 
possibilities:
(i) The series converges only when 
.
(ii) The series converges for all .
(iii) There is a positive number 
such that the series converges if 
and diverges if 
.
The number 
in case (iii) is called the radius of convergence of the power series. By
convention, the radius of convergence is 
in case (i) and 
in case (ii). The
interval of convergence of a power series is the interval that consists of all values of for
which the series converges. In case (i) the interval consists of just a single point . In case
(ii) the interval is 
. In case (iii) note that the inequality 
can be rewrit-
ten as 
. When 
is an endpoint of the interval, that is, 
, 
anything can happen—the series might converge at one or both endpoints or it might
diverge at both endpoints. Thus in case (iii) there are four possibilities for the interval of
convergence:
The situation is illustrated in Figure 3.
We summarize here the radius and interval of convergence for each of the examples
already considered in this section.
The Ratio Test can be used to determine the radius of convergence 
in most cases. The
Ratio Test always fails when 
is an endpoint of the interval of convergence, so the end-
points must be checked with some other test.

Find the radius of convergence and interval of convergence of the series
SOLUTION Let 
. Then
By the Ratio Test, the given series converges if 
and diverges if 
.
Thus it converges if 
and diverges if 
. This means that the radius of con-
vergence is 
.
We know the series converges in the interval 
, but we must now test for con-
vergence at the endpoints of this interval. If 
, the series becomes
which diverges. (Use the Integral Test or simply observe that it is a -series with
.) If 
, the series is
which converges by the Alternating Series Test. Therefore the given power series con-
verges when 
, so the interval of convergence is 
.
Find the radius of convergence and interval of convergence of the series
SOLUTION If

Using the Ratio Test, we see that the series converges if 
and it diverges if
. So it converges if 
and diverges if 
. Thus the
radius of convergence is

The inequality 
can be written as

In this section we learn how to represent certain types of functions as sums of power series
by manipulating geometric series or by differentiating or integrating such a series. You might
wonder why we would ever want to express a known function as a sum of inﬁnitely many
terms. This strategy is useful for integrating functions that don’t have elementary antideriv-
atives, for solving differential equations, and for approximating functions by polynomials.
(Scientists do this to simplify the expressions they deal with; computer scientists do this to
represent functions on calculators and computers.)
We start with an equation that we have seen before:
We ﬁrst encountered this equation in Example 5 in Section 8.2, where we obtained it by
observing that the series is a geometric series with 
and 
. But here our point of
view is different. We now regard Equation 1 as expressing the function 
as a sum of a power series.

Finding a new power series from an old one
Express 
as the
sum of a power series and ﬁnd the interval of convergence.
SOLUTION Replacing by 
in Equation 1, we have
Because this is a geometric series, it converges when 
, that is, 
, or
. Therefore the interval of convergence is 
. (Of course, we could have
determined the radius of convergence by applying the Ratio Test, but that much work is
unnecessary here.)
Find a power series representation for 
.
SOLUTION In order to put this function in the form of the left side of Equation 1 we ﬁrst
factor a 2 from the denominator:
This series converges when 
, that is, 
. So the interval of convergence
is 
.
Find a power series representation of 
.
SOLUTION Since this function is just 
times the function in Example 2, all we have to
do is to multiply that series by 
:
Another way of writing this series is as follows:
As in Example 2, the interval of convergence is 
.
Differentiation and Integration of Power Series
The sum of a power series is a function 
whose domain is the inter-
val of convergence of the series. We would like to be able to differentiate and integrate
such functions, and the following theorem (which we won’t prove) says that we can do so

INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
by differentiating or integrating each individual term in the series, just as we would for a
polynomial. This is called term-by-term differentiation and integration.
Theorem If the power series 
has radius of convergence 
,
then the function 
deﬁned by
is differentiable (and therefore continuous) on the interval 
and
(i)
(ii)
The radii of convergence of the power series in Equations (i) and (ii) are both .
Note 1: Equations (i) and (ii) in Theorem 2 can be rewritten in the form
(iii)
(iv)
We know that, for ﬁnite sums, the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives and the
integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals. Equations (iii) and (iv) assert that the same is
true for inﬁnite sums, provided we are dealing with power series. (For other types of series
of functions the situation is not as simple; see Exercise 36.)
Note 2: Although Theorem 2 says that the radius of convergence remains the same
when a power series is differentiated or integrated, this does not mean that the interval of
convergence remains the same. It may happen that the original series converges at an end-
point, whereas the differentiated series diverges there. (See Exercise 37.)
Differentiating a power series
In Example 3 in Section 8.5 we saw that the
Bessel function
is deﬁned for all . Thus, by Theorem 2, 
is differentiable for all and its derivative is
found by term-by-term differentiation as follows:

To ﬁnd 
we put 
and obtain 
. Therefore
Since the radius of convergence of the series for 
is 1, the radius of conver-
gence of this series for 
is also 1.
(a) Evaluate 
as a power series.
(b) Use part (a) to approximate 
correct to within 
.
SOLUTION
(a) The ﬁrst step is to express the integrand, 
, as the sum of a power series.
As in Example 1, we start with Equation 1 and replace by 
:
Now we integrate term by term:
This series converges for 
, that is, for 
.
(b) In applying the Evaluation Theorem it doesn’t matter which antiderivative we use, so
let’s use the antiderivative from part (a) with 
:
This inﬁnite series is the exact value of the deﬁnite integral, but since it is an alternating
series, we can approximate the sum using the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem. If
we stop adding after the term with 
, the error is smaller than the term with 
:
So we have

In the preceding section we were able to ﬁnd power series representations for a certain
restricted class of functions. Here we investigate more general problems: Which functions
have power series representations? How can we ﬁnd such representations?
We start by supposing that 
is any function that can be represented by a power series
Let’s try to determine what the coefﬁcients 
must be in terms of . To begin, notice that
if we put 
in Equation 1, then all terms after the ﬁrst one are 0 and we get
By Theorem 8.6.2, we can differentiate the series in Equation 1 term by term:

Now we differentiate both sides of Equation 2 and obtain
Again we put 
in Equation 3. The result is
Let’s apply the procedure one more time. Differentiation of the series in Equation 3 gives
and substitution of 
in Equation 4 gives
By now you can see the pattern. If we continue to differentiate and substitute 
, we
obtain
Solving this equation for the 
coefﬁcient 
This formula remains valid even for 
if we adopt the conventions that

. Thus we have proved the following theorem.
Theorem If

then its coefﬁcients are given by the formula
Substituting this formula for 
back into the series, we see that if

expansion at , then it must be of the following form.

INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
For the special case 
the Taylor series becomes
This case arises frequently enough that it is given the special name Maclaurin series.
Note: We have shown that if
can be represented as a power series about , then 
is
equal to the sum of its Taylor series. But there exist functions that are not equal to the sum
of their Taylor series. An example of such a function is given in Exercise 68.
Maclaurin series for the exponential function
Find the Maclaurin series of
the function 
and its radius of convergence.
SOLUTION If 
, then 
, so 
for all . Therefore the
Taylor series for 
at 0 (that is, the Maclaurin series) is
To ﬁnd the radius of convergence we let 
. Then
so, by the Ratio Test, the series converges for all and the radius of convergence 
is 
.
The conclusion we can draw from Theorem 5 and Example 1 is that if
has a power
series expansion at 0, then
So how can we determine whether 
does have a power series representation?
Let’s investigate the more general question: Under what circumstances is a function
equal to the sum of its Taylor series? In other words, if has derivatives of all orders, when
is it true that
As with any convergent series, this means that 
is the limit of the sequence of partial
sums. In the case of the Taylor series, the partial sums are

Taylor and Maclaurin
The Taylor series is named after the English 
mathematician Brook Taylor (1685–1731) 
and the Maclaurin series is named in honor 
of the Scottish mathematician Colin Maclaurin
(1698–1746) despite the fact that the Maclaurin
series is really just a special case of the Taylor
series. But the idea of representing particular
functions as sums of power series goes back 
to Newton, and the general Taylor series 
was known to the Scottish mathematician
James Gregory in 1668 and to the Swiss 
mathematician John Bernoulli in the 1690s. 
Taylor was apparently unaware of the work of
Gregory and Bernoulli when he published his
discoveries on series in 1715 in his book 
Methodus incrementorum directa et inversa.
Maclaurin series are named after Colin Maclau-
rin because he popularized them in his calculus
textbook Treatise of Fluxions published in 1742.

Notice that 
is a polynomial of degree 
called the nth-degree Taylor polynomial of f
at a. For instance, for the exponential function 
, the result of Example 1 shows
that the Taylor polynomials at 0 (or Maclaurin polynomials) with 
, 2, and 3 are
The graphs of the exponential function and these three Taylor polynomials are drawn in

in a similar way by integrating

Note: In Section 8.8 we will explore the use of Taylor’s Inequality in approximating
functions. Our immediate use of it is in conjunction with Theorem 8.
In applying Theorems 8 and 9 it is often helpful to make use of the following fact.

This is true because we know from Example 1 that the series

In particular, if we put 
in Equation 11, we obtain the following expression for the
number as a sum of an inﬁnite series:
Find the Taylor series for

SOLUTION We have 
and so, putting 
in the deﬁnition of a Taylor series
(6), we get
Again it can be veriﬁed, as in Example 1, that the radius of convergence is 
. As in
Example 2 we can verify that 
, so
We have two power series expansions for 
, the Maclaurin series in Equation 11 and
the Taylor series in Equation 13. The ﬁrst is better if we are interested in values of near
0 and the second is better if is near 2.
Find the Maclaurin series for 
and prove that it represents

SOLUTION We could proceed directly as in Example 4, but it’s easier to differentiate the
Maclaurin series for 
given by Equation 15:
Since the Maclaurin series for 
converges for all , Theorem 2 in Section 8.6 tells us
that the differentiated series for 
also converges for all . Thus

in Example 4 and the Taylor series in Example 7.
It is best to use the Maclaurin series for values
of near 0 and the Taylor series for near

in Figure 3 is a good approximation to 
near

CHAPTER 8
INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
Therefore the Maclaurin series of 
is
This series is called the binomial series. If its th term is 
Thus, by the Ratio Test, the binomial series converges if 
and diverges 
if 
.
The traditional notation for the coefﬁcients in the binomial series is
and these numbers are called the binomial coefﬁcients.
The following theorem states that 
is equal to the sum of its Maclaurin series.
It is possible to prove this by showing that the remainder term 
approaches 0, but that
turns out to be quite difﬁcult. The proof outlined in Exercise 69 is much easier.
The Binomial Series If is any real number and 
, then
Although the binomial series always converges when 
, the question of whether
or not it converges at the endpoints, 
, depends on the value of . It turns out that the
series converges at 1 if 
and at both endpoints if 
. Notice that if 
is a
positive integer and 
, then the expression for 
contains a factor 
, so

Theorem when is a positive integer. (See Reference Page 1.)

CHAPTER 8
INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
Then from Table 1 we see that this series matches the entry for 
with 
. So
One reason that Taylor series are important is that they enable us to integrate functions
that we couldn’t previously handle. In fact, in the introduction to this chapter we men-
tioned that Newton often integrated functions by ﬁrst expressing them as power series and
then integrating the series term by term. The function 
can’t be integrated by 
techniques discussed so far because its antiderivative is not an elementary function (see
Section 5.8). In the following example we use Newton’s idea to integrate this function.
Using a series to evaluate an integral
(a) Evaluate 
as an inﬁnite series.
(b) Evaluate 
correct to within an error of 
.
SOLUTION
(a) First we ﬁnd the Maclaurin series for 
. Although it’s possible to use the
direct method, let’s ﬁnd it simply by replacing with 
in the series for 
given in
Table 1. Thus, for all values of x,
Now we integrate term by term:
This series converges for all because the original series for 
converges for all .
(b) The Evaluation Theorem gives
The Alternating Series Estimation Theorem shows that the error involved in this approxi-
mation is less than
Another use of Taylor series is illustrated in the next example. The limit could be found
with l’Hospital’s Rule, but instead we use a series.

SOLUTION Using the Maclaurin series for

because power series are continuous functions.
Multiplication and Division of Power Series
If power series are added or subtracted, they behave like polynomials (Theorem 8.2.8
shows this). In fact, as the following example illustrates, they can also be multiplied and
divided like polynomials. We ﬁnd only the ﬁrst few terms because the calculations for the
later terms become tedious and the initial terms are the most important ones.

Find the ﬁrst three
nonzero terms in the Maclaurin series for (a)

(a) Using the Maclaurin series for

The Binomial Theorem, which gives the expansion of

maticians many centuries before the time of Newton for the case where the exponent k is a 
positive integer. In 1665, when he was 22, Newton was the ﬁrst to discover the inﬁnite series
expansion of 
when k is a fractional exponent (positive or negative). He didn’t publish 
his discovery, but he stated it and gave examples of how to use it in a letter (now called the

SECTION 8.8
APPLICATIONS OF TAYLOR POLYNOMIALS

In this section we explore two types of applications of Taylor polynomials. First we look
at how they are used to approximate functions––computer scientists like them because
polynomials are the simplest of functions. Then we investigate how physicists and engi-
neers use them in such ﬁelds as relativity, optics, blackbody radiation, electric dipoles, and
building highways across a desert.
Approximating Functions by Polynomials

epistola prior) dated June 13, 1676, that he sent to Henry Oldenburg, secretary of the Royal Soci-
ety of London, to transmit to Leibniz. When Leibniz replied, he asked how Newton had discov-
ered the binomial series. Newton wrote a second letter, the epistola posterior of October 24, 1676,
in which he explained in great detail how he arrived at his discovery by a very indirect route. He
was investigating the areas under the curves 
from 0 to x for 
, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . .
These are easy to calculate if n is even. By observing patterns and interpolating, Newton was able
to guess the answers for odd values of n. Then he realized he could get the same answers by
expressing 
as an inﬁnite series.
Write a report on Newton’s discovery of the binomial series. Start by giving the statement of
the binomial series in Newton’s notation (see the epistola prior on page 285 of [4] or page 402 
of [2]). Explain why Newton’s version is equivalent to Theorem 17 on page 612. Then read
Newton’s epistola posterior (page 287 in [4] or page 404 in [2]) and explain the patterns that
Newton discovered in the areas under the curves 
. Show how he was able to 
guess the areas under the remaining curves and how he veriﬁed his answers. Finally, explain
how these discoveries led to the binomial series. The books by Edwards [1] and Katz [3] contain
commentaries on Newton’s letters.

CHAPTER 8
INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
Since 
is the sum of its Taylor series, we know that 
as 
and so 
can
be used as an approximation to :
.
Notice that the ﬁrst-degree Taylor polynomial
is the same as the linearization of f at a that we discussed in Section 3.9. Notice also that
and its derivative have the same values at a that
and 
have. In general, it can be
shown that the derivatives of 
at 
agree with those of 
up to and including derivatives
of order .
To illustrate these ideas let’s take another look at the graphs of 
and its ﬁrst few
Taylor polynomials, as shown in Figure 1. The graph of 
is the tangent line to 
at 
; this tangent line is the best linear approximation to 
near 
. The graph 
of 
is the parabola 
, and the graph of 
is the cubic curve
, which is a closer ﬁt to the exponential curve 
than 
.
The next Taylor polynomial 
would be an even better approximation, and so on.
The values in the table give a numerical demonstration of the convergence of the Taylor
polynomials 
to the function 
. We see that when 
the convergence is
very rapid, but when 
it is somewhat slower. In fact, the farther is from 0, the more
slowly 
converges to 
.
When using a Taylor polynomial 
to approximate a function , we have to ask the
questions: How good an approximation is it? How large should we take 
to be in order 
to achieve a desired accuracy? To answer these questions we need to look at the absolute
value of the remainder:
There are three possible methods for estimating the size of the error:
1. If a graphing device is available, we can use it to graph 
and thereby esti-
mate the error.
2. If the series happens to be an alternating series, we can use the Alternating Series
Estimation Theorem.
3. In all cases we can use Taylor’s Inequality (Theorem 8.7.9), which says that if

(a) Notice that the Maclaurin series
is alternating for all nonzero values of , and the successive terms decrease in size
because 
, so we can use the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem. The error 
in approximating 
by the ﬁrst three terms of its Maclaurin series is at most
If 
, then 
, so the error is smaller than
To ﬁnd 
we ﬁrst convert to radian measure:
Thus, correct to six decimal places, 
.
(b) The error will be smaller than 
if
Solving this inequality for , we get
So the given approximation is accurate to within 
when 
.
What if we use Taylor’s Inequality to solve Example 2? Since 
, we
have 
and so
So we get the same estimates as with the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem.
What about graphical methods? Figure 4 shows the graph of

. This is the same estimate
that we obtained in Example 2. For part (b) we want 
, so we graph both
and 
in Figure 5. By placing the cursor on the right intersection
point we ﬁnd that the inequality is satisﬁed when 
. Again this is the same esti-
mate that we obtained in the solution to Example 2.

in Example 2, it would
have been wise to use the Taylor polynomials at

Figure 6 shows the graphs of the Maclaurin polynomial approximations
to the sine curve. You can see that as increases,

a larger and larger interval.
One use of the type of calculation done in Examples 1 and 2 occurs in calculators and
computers. For instance, when you press the 
or 
key on your calculator, or when a
computer programmer uses a subroutine for a trigonometric or exponential or Bessel func-
tion, in many machines a polynomial approximation is calculated. The polynomial is often
a Taylor polynomial that has been modiﬁed so that the error is spread more evenly through-
out an interval.
Applications to Physics
Taylor polynomials are also used frequently in physics. In order to gain insight into an
equation, a physicist often simpliﬁes a function by considering only the ﬁrst two or three
terms in its Taylor series. In other words, the physicist uses a Taylor polynomial as an
approximation to the function. Taylor’s Inequality can then be used to gauge the accuracy
of the approximation. The following example shows one way in which this idea is used in
special relativity.
Using Taylor to compare Einstein and Newton
In Einstein’s theory of 
special relativity the mass of an object moving with velocity is
where 
is the mass of the object when at rest and is the speed of light. The kinetic
energy of the object is the difference between its total energy and its energy at rest:

APPLICATIONS OF TAYLOR POLYNOMIALS

Using Fermat’s principle that light travels so as to minimize the time taken, Hecht
derives the equation
where 
and 
are indexes of refraction and 
, , , and 
are the distances indicated in
Figure 8. By the Law of Cosines, applied to triangles ACS and ACP, we have
Because Equation 1 is cumbersome to work with, Gauss, in 1841, simpliﬁed it by using
the linear approximation 
for small values of 
. (This amounts to using the
Taylor polynomial of degree 1.) Then Equation 1 becomes the following simpler equation
[as you are asked to show in Exercise 28(a)]:
The resulting optical theory is known as Gaussian optics, or ﬁrst-order optics, and has
become the basic theoretical tool used to design lenses.
A more accurate theory is obtained by approximating 
by its Taylor polynomial of
degree 3 (which is the same as the Taylor polynomial of degree 2). This takes into account
rays for which 
is not so small, that is, rays that strike the surface at greater distances h
above the axis. In Exercise 28(b) you are asked to use this approximation to derive the
more accurate equation
The resulting optical theory is known as third-order optics.
Other applications of Taylor polynomials to physics and engineering are explored in
Exercises 29–32 and in the Applied Project on page 627.

values of

(the
resistivity at

Radiation from the Stars
Any object emits radiation when heated. A blackbody is a system that absorbs all the radiation that
falls on it. For instance, a matte black surface or a large cavity with a small hole in its wall (like a
blastfurnace) is a blackbody and emits blackbody radiation. Even the radiation from the sun is
close to being blackbody radiation.
Proposed in the late 19th century, the Rayleigh-Jeans Law expresses the energy density of
blackbody radiation of wavelength 
as
where 
is measured in meters, 
is the temperature in kelvins (K), and is Boltzmann’s con-
stant. The Rayleigh-Jeans Law agrees with experimental measurements for long wavelengths

3. To construct the snowﬂake curve, start with an equilateral triangle with sides of length . 
Step 1 in the construction is to divide each side into three equal parts, construct an equilateral
triangle on the middle part, and then delete the middle part (see the ﬁgure). Step 2 is to repeat
step 1 for each side of the resulting polygon. This process is repeated at each succeeding step.
The snowﬂake curve is the curve that results from repeating this process indeﬁnitely.

fact, show that the top book can extend any distance at all beyond the edge of the table if the
stack is high enough. Use the following method of stacking: The top book extends half its
length beyond the second book. The second book extends a quarter of its length beyond the
third. The third extends one-sixth of its length beyond the fourth, and so on. (Try it yourself

Vectors and the Geometry of Space
In this chapter we introduce vectors and coordinate systems for three-
dimensional space. This is the setting for the study of functions of two variables
because the graph of such a function is a surface in space. Vectors provide 
particularly simple descriptions of lines and planes in space as well as velocities
and accelerations of objects that move in space.

CHAPTER 9
VECTORS AND THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE
To locate a point in a plane, two numbers are necessary. We know that any point in 
the plane can be represented as an ordered pair 
of real numbers, where 
is the 
-coordinate and is the -coordinate. For this reason, a plane is called two-dimensional.
To locate a point in space, three numbers are required. We represent any point in space by
an ordered triple
of real numbers.
In order to represent points in space, we ﬁrst choose a ﬁxed point 
(the origin) and
three directed lines through 
that are perpendicular to each other, called the coordinate
axes and labeled the -axis, -axis, and -axis. Usually we think of the - and -axes as
being horizontal and the -axis as being vertical, and we draw the orientation of the axes
as in Figure 1. The direction of the -axis is determined by the right-hand rule as illus-
trated in Figure 2: If you curl the ﬁngers of your right hand around the -axis in the direc-
tion of a 
counterclockwise rotation from the positive -axis to the positive -axis, then
your thumb points in the positive direction of the -axis.
The three coordinate axes determine the three coordinate planes illustrated in Fig-
ure 3(a). The 
-plane is the plane that contains the - and -axes; the 
-plane contains
the - and -axes; the 
-plane contains the - and -axes. These three coordinate planes
divide space into eight parts, called octants. The ﬁrst octant, in the foreground, is deter-
mined by the positive axes.
Because many people have some difﬁculty visualizing diagrams of three-dimensional
ﬁgures, you may ﬁnd it helpful to do the following [see Figure 3(b)]. Look at any bottom
corner of a room and call the corner the origin. The wall on your left is in the 
-plane, the
wall on your right is in the 
-plane, and the ﬂoor is in the 
-plane. The -axis runs along
the intersection of the ﬂoor and the left wall. The -axis runs along the intersection of the
ﬂoor and the right wall. The -axis runs up from the ﬂoor toward the ceiling along the inter-
section of the two walls. You are situated in the ﬁrst octant, and you can now imagine seven
other rooms situated in the other seven octants (three on the same ﬂoor and four on the
ﬂoor below), all connected by the common corner point .
Now if 
is any point in space, let 
be the (directed) distance from the 
-plane to 
let 
be the distance from the 
-plane to 
and let be the distance from the 
-plane to
. We represent the point
by the ordered triple
of real numbers and we call
, , and the coordinates of ; 
is the -coordinate, 
is the -coordinate, and is the 
-coordinate. Thus, to locate the point 
, we can start at the origin 
and move 
units along the -axis, then 
units parallel to the -axis, and then units parallel to the
-axis as in Figure 4.

The point 
determines a rectangular box as in Figure 5. If we drop a perpen-
dicular from 
to the 
-plane, we get a point 
with coordinates 
called the pro-
jection of 
onto the 
-plane. Similarly, 
and 
are the projections of 
onto the 
-plane and 
-plane, respectively.
As numerical illustrations, the points 
and 
are plotted in Fig-
ure 6.
The Cartesian product 
is the set of all ordered
triples of real numbers and is denoted by 
. We have given a one-to-one correspon-
dence between points 
in space and ordered triples 
in 
. It is called a three-
dimensional rectangular coordinate system. Notice that, in terms of coordinates, the
ﬁrst octant can be described as the set of points whose coordinates are all positive.
In two-dimensional analytic geometry, the graph of an equation involving

a surface in

VECTORS AND THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE
Note: When an equation is given, we must understand from the context whether it rep-
resents a curve in
or a surface in
. In Example 1,
represents a plane in
, but
of course 
can also represent a line in 
if we are dealing with two-dimensional ana-
lytic geometry. See Figure 7(b) and (c).
In general, if 
is a constant, then 
represents a plane parallel to the
-plane,
is a plane parallel to the 
-plane, and 
is a plane parallel to the 
-plane. In
Figure 5, the faces of the rectangular box are formed by the three coordinate planes 
(the
-plane),
(the
-plane), and
(the
-plane), and the planes
,
,
and 
.
Describing regions represented by equations
(a) Which points 
satisfy the equations
and
(b) What does the equation 
represent as a surface in 
?
SOLUTION
(a) Because 
, the points lie in the horizontal plane 
from Example 1(a).
Because 
, the points lie on the circle with radius 1 and center on the -axis.
See Figure 8.
(b) Given that 
, with no restrictions on , we see that the point 
could lie on a circle in any horizontal plane 
. So the surface 
in 
consists of all possible horizontal circles 
, 
, and is therefore the circu-
lar cylinder with radius 1 whose axis is the -axis. See Figure 9.
Describe and sketch the surface in 
represented by the equation 
.
SOLUTION The equation represents the set of all points in 
whose - and -coordinates
are equal, that is, 
. This is a vertical plane that intersects the 
-plane in the line 
, 
. The portion of this plane that lies in the ﬁrst octant is
sketched in Figure 10.
The familiar formula for the distance between two points in a plane is easily extended
to the following three-dimensional formula.

To see why this formula is true, we construct a rectangular box as in Figure 11, where
and 
are opposite vertices and the faces of the box are parallel to the coordinate
planes. If 
and

then
Because triangles

Comparing this equation with the standard form, we see that it is the equation of a
sphere with center 
and radius 
.
What region in 
is represented by the following inequalities?
SOLUTION The inequalities
can be rewritten as
so they represent the points 
whose distance from the origin is at least 1 and at
most 2. But we are also given that 
, so the points lie on or below the xy-plane. 
Thus the given inequalities represent the region that lies between (or on) the spheres
and 
and beneath (or on) the xy-plane. It is sketched
in Figure 13.

The term vector is used by scientists to indicate a quantity (such as displacement or veloc-
ity or force) that has both magnitude and direction. A vector is often represented by an
arrow or a directed line segment. The length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the
vector and the arrow points in the direction of the vector. We denote a vector by printing a
letter in boldface 
or by putting an arrow above the letter 
For instance, suppose a particle moves along a line segment from point 
to point .
The corresponding displacement vector , shown in Figure 1, has initial point
(the tail)
and terminal point
(the tip) and we indicate this by writing

l has the same length and the same direction as 
even though it is in a differ-
ent position. We say that 
and are equivalent (or equal) and we write 
. The zero
vector, denoted by 0, has length . It is the only vector with no speciﬁc direction.
Combining Vectors
Suppose a particle moves from 
, so its displacement vector is AB
l. Then the particle
changes direction and moves from 
, with displacement vector BC
las in Figure 2. The
combined effect of these displacements is that the particle has moved from 
. The
resulting displacement vector AC
l is called the sum of AB
l and BC
l and we write
AC

In general, if we start with vectors and , we ﬁrst move so that its tail coincides with
the tip of 
and deﬁne the sum of 
and as follows.
Deﬁnition of Vector Addition If 
and are vectors positioned so the initial point of
is at the terminal point of , then the sum
is the vector from the initial
point of 
to the terminal point of .
The deﬁnition of vector addition is illustrated in Figure 3. You can see why this deﬁ-
nition is sometimes called the Triangle Law.
In Figure 4 we start with the same vectors 
and 
as in Figure 3 and draw another 
copy of 
with the same initial point as . Completing the parallelogram, we see that
. This also gives another way to construct the sum: If we place 
and so
they start at the same point, then 
lies along the diagonal of the parallelogram with
and as sides. (This is called the Parallelogram Law.)
Draw the sum of the vectors 
shown in Figure 5.
SOLUTION First we translate 
and place its tail at the tip of , being careful to draw a
copy of 
that has the same length and direction. Then we draw the vector 
[see
Figure 6(a)] starting at the initial point of and ending at the terminal point of the copy
of .
Alternatively, we could place 
so it starts where starts and construct 
by the
Parallelogram Law as in Figure 6(b).

It is possible to multiply a vector by a real number . (In this context we call the real
number a scalar to distinguish it from a vector.) For instance, we want 
to be the same
vector as 
, which has the same direction as but is twice as long. In general, we mul-
tiply a vector by a scalar as follows.
Deﬁnition of Scalar Multiplication If is a scalar and is a vector, then the scalar
multiple
is the vector whose length is 
times the length of and whose
direction is the same as if 
and is opposite to if 
. If 
or 
,
then 
.
This deﬁnition is illustrated in Figure 7. We see that real numbers work like scaling fac-
tors here; that’s why we call them scalars. Notice that two nonzero vectors are parallel if
they are scalar multiples of one another. In particular, the vector 
has the same
length as but points in the opposite direction. We call it the negative of .
By the difference
of two vectors we mean
So we can construct 
by ﬁrst drawing the negative of , 
, and then adding it to
by the Parallelogram Law as in Figure 8(a). Alternatively, since
the vec-
tor 
, when added to , gives . So we could construct 
as in Figure 8(b) by
means of the Triangle Law.
If 
are the vectors shown in Figure 9, draw 
.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst draw the vector 
pointing in the direction opposite to 
and twice
as long. We place it with its tail at the tip of and then use the Triangle Law to draw
as in Figure 10.
Components
For some purposes it’s best to introduce a coordinate system and treat vectors algebra-
ically. If we place the initial point of a vector 
at the origin of a rectangular coordinate
system, then the terminal point of 
has coordinates of the form 
or 
,
depending on whether our coordinate system is two- or three-dimensional (see Figure 11).

These coordinates are called the components of and we write
or
We use the notation 
for the ordered pair that refers to a vector so as not to confuse
it with the ordered pair 
that refers to a point in the plane.
For instance, the vectors shown in Figure 12 are all equivalent to the vector
OP
l
whose terminal point is 
. What they have in common is that the ter-
minal point is reached from the initial point by a displacement of three units to the right
and two upward. We can think of all these geometric vectors as representations of the
algebraic vector 
. The particular representation OP
l from the origin to the point
is called the position vector of the point .
In three dimensions, the vector 
OP
l
is the position vector of the
point 
. (See Figure 13.) Let’s consider any other representation AB
l of , where
the initial point is 
and the terminal point is 
. Then we must have
, 
, and 
and so 
, 
, and
. Thus we have the following result.
Given the points 
and

tation AB
l is

Find the vector represented by the directed line segment with initial point

and terminal point

SOLUTION By (1), the vector corresponding to AB
l is
The magnitude or length of the vector is the length of any of its representations and
is denoted by the symbol 
or 
. By using the distance formula to compute the length
of a segment 
, we obtain the following formulas.
The length of the two-dimensional vector 
is
The length of the three-dimensional vector 
is
How do we add vectors algebraically? Figure 14 shows that if

, then the sum is 
, at least for the case where the
components are positive. In other words, to add algebraic vectors we add their compo-
nents. Similarly, to subtract vectors we subtract components. From the similar triangles in

Vectors in dimensions are used to list various
quantities in an organized way. For instance, the
components of a six-dimensional vector
might represent the prices of six different ingre-
dients required to make a particular product.
Four-dimensional vectors 
are used
in relativity theory, where the ﬁrst three compo-
nents specify a position in space and the fourth
represents time.

These eight properties of vectors can be readily veriﬁed either geometrically or alge-
braically. For instance, Property 1 can be seen from Figure 4 (it’s equivalent to the Paral-
lelogram Law) or as follows for the case 
:
We can see why Property 2 (the associative law) is true by looking at Figure 16 and
applying the Triangle Law several times: The vector PQ
l is obtained either by ﬁrst con-
structing a  b and then adding c or by adding a to the vector b  c.
Three vectors in 
play a special role. Let
Then , , and 
are vectors that have length 
and point in the directions of the positive 
-, -, and -axes. Similarly, in two dimensions we deﬁne 
and 
. (See
Figure 17.)
If 
, then we can write
Thus any vector in 
can be expressed in terms of the standard basis vectors , , and .
For instance,
Similarly, in two dimensions, we can write

A unit vector is a vector whose length is 1. For instance, , , and

tors. In general, if

so, by Equation 4, the unit vector with the same direction is
Applications
Vectors are useful in many aspects of physics and engineering. In Chapter 10 we will see
how they describe the velocity and acceleration of objects moving in space. Here we look
at forces.
A force is represented by a vector because it has both a magnitude (measured in pounds
or newtons) and a direction. If several forces are acting on an object, the resultant force
experienced by the object is the vector sum of these forces.
A 100-lb weight hangs from two wires as shown in Figure 19. Find the
tensions (forces) 
and 
in both wires and the magnitudes of the tensions.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst express 
and 
in terms of their horizontal and vertical compo-
nents. From Figure 20 we see that
The resultant 
of the tensions counterbalances the weight 
and so we must have

So far we have added two vectors and multiplied a vector by a scalar. The question arises:
Is it possible to multiply two vectors so that their product is a useful quantity? One such
product is the dot product, which we consider in this section. Another is the cross product,
which is discussed in the next section.
Work and the Dot Product
An example of a situation in physics and engineering where we need to combine two vec-
tors occurs in calculating the work done by a force. In Section 6.5 we deﬁned the work
done by a constant force
in moving an object through a distance
as
, but this
applies only when the force is directed along the line of motion of the object. Suppose,
however, that the constant force is a vector 
PR
l pointing in some other direction, as 
in Figure 1. If the force moves the object from 
to , then the displacement vector is
PQ
l. So here we have two vectors: the force 
and the displacement 
. The work
done by 
is deﬁned as the magnitude of the displacement, 
, multiplied by the magni-
tude of the applied force in the direction of the motion, which, from Figure 1, is
PS
l
F
So the work done by 
is deﬁned to be
Notice that work is a scalar quantity; it has no direction. But its value depends on the angle
between the force and displacement vectors.
We use the expression in Equation 1 to deﬁne the dot product of two vectors even when
they don’t represent force or displacement.

THE DOT PRODUCT
649
Definition The dot product of two nonzero vectors 
is the number
where 
is the angle between 
, 
. (So is the smaller angle
between the vectors when they are drawn with the same initial point.) If either
is , we deﬁne 
.
This product is called the dot product because of the dot in the notation 
. The
result of computing 
is not a vector. It is a real number, that is, a scalar. For this rea-
son, the dot product is sometimes called the scalar product.
In the example of ﬁnding the work done by a force 
in moving an object through a dis-
placement 
PQ
l by calculating 
, it makes no sense for the angle
between 
to be 
or larger because movement from 
couldn’t take place.
We make no such restriction in our general deﬁnition of 
, however, and allow
to be
any angle from 
.

If the vectors 
and 
have lengths 4 and 6, and the angle between them is

SOLUTION According to the deﬁnition,
A wagon is pulled a distance of 100 m along a horizontal path by a constant
force of 70 N. The handle of the wagon is held at an angle of 
above the horizontal.
Find the work done by the force.
SOLUTION If 
are the force and displacement vectors, as pictured in Figure 2,
then the work done is
Two nonzero vectors 
and 
are called perpendicular or orthogonal if the angle
between them is 
. For such vectors we have

to be perpendicular to all vectors. Therefore

We want to ﬁnd a convenient expression for

apply the Law of Cosines to the triangle in Figure 4, we get
Solving for the dot product, we obtain

add. The dot product of two-dimensional vectors is found in a similar fashion:

Projections
Figure 5 shows representations PQ
l and PR
l of two vectors 
and 
with the same initial
point . If is the foot of the perpendicular from 
to the line containing PQ
l, then the vec-
tor with representation PS
l is called the vector projection of 
onto 
and is denoted by
. (You can think of it as a shadow of ).
The scalar projection of 
onto (also called the component of 
along ) is deﬁned
to be the signed magnitude of the vector projection, which is the number 
, where
is the angle between 
and . (See Figure 6.) This is denoted by 
. Observe that
it is negative if 
. (Note that we used the component of the force 
along the
displacement , 
, at the beginning of this section.)
The equation
shows that the dot product of and 
can be interpreted as the length of times the scalar
projection of 
onto . Since
the component of 
along 
can be computed by taking the dot product of 
with the unit
vector in the direction of . We summarize these ideas as follows.
Scalar projection of

Vector projection of

Find the scalar projection and vector projection of 
onto 
.
SOLUTION Since 
, the scalar projection of 
onto
is
The vector projection is this scalar projection times the unit vector in the direction of :
At the beginning of this section we saw one use of projections in physics––we used a
scalar projection of a force vector in deﬁning work. Other uses of projections occur in
three-dimensional geometry. In Exercise 41 you are asked to use a projection to ﬁnd the
distance from a point to a line, and in Section 9.5 we use a projection to ﬁnd the distance
from a point to a plane.

The cross product
of two vectors 
and , unlike the dot product, is a vector. For
this reason it is also called the vector product. We will see that 
is useful in geom-
etry because it is perpendicular to both and . But we introduce this product by looking
at a situation where it arises in physics and engineering.
Torque and the Cross Product
If we tighten a bolt by applying a force to a wrench as in Figure 1, we produce a turning
effect called a torque . The magnitude of the torque depends on two things:
■The distance from the axis of the bolt to the point where the force is applied. This
is 
, the length of the position vector .r

■The scalar component of the force 
in the direction perpendicular to . This is the
only component that can cause a rotation and, from Figure 2, we see that it is 
where 
is the angle between the vectors 
.
We deﬁne the magnitude of the torque vector to be the product of these two factors:
The direction is along the axis of rotation. If 
is a unit vector that points in the direction
in which a right-threaded bolt moves (see Figure 1), we deﬁne the torque to be the vector
We denote this torque vector by 
and we call it the cross product or vector prod-
uct of 
.
The type of expression in Equation 1 occurs so frequently in the study of ﬂuid ﬂow,
planetary motion, and other areas of physics and engineering, that we deﬁne and study the
cross product of any pair of three-dimensional vectors 
.
Deﬁnition If 
are nonzero three-dimensional vectors, the cross product of
is the vector
where is the angle between 
, 
, and 
is a unit vector perpendi-
cular to both 
and whose direction is given by the right-hand rule: If the
ﬁngers of your right hand curl through the angle
from 
, then your thumb
points in the direction of . (See Figure 3.)
If either 
is , then we deﬁne 
to be .
Because 
is a scalar multiple of , it has the same direction as 
and so
is orthogonal to both 
.
Notice that two nonzero vectors 
are parallel if and only if the angle between
them is 
. In either case, 
and so 
.
Two nonzero vectors 
are parallel if and only if 
.
This makes sense in the torque interpretation: If we pull or push the wrench in the direc-
tion of its handle (so 
is parallel to ), we produce no torque.
A bolt is tightened by applying a 40-N force to a 0.25-m wrench, as shown
in Figure 4. Find the magnitude of the torque about the center of the bolt.

Cross product of standard basis vectors
Find

SOLUTION The standard basis vectors 
both have length 1 and the angle between
them is 
. By the right-hand rule, the unit vector perpendicular to and is 
(see Figure 5), so
But if we apply the right-hand rule to the vectors and (in that order), we see that 
points downward and so 
. Thus
From Example 2 we see that
so the cross product is not commutative. Similar reasoning shows that
In general, the right-hand rule shows that

Another algebraic law that fails for the cross product is the associative law for multipli-
cation; that is, in general,

For instance, if

THE CROSS PRODUCT
657
Property 2 is proved by applying the deﬁnition of a cross product to each of the three
expressions. Properties 3 and 4 (the Vector Distributive Laws) are more difﬁcult to estab-
lish (see Exercise 41).
A geometric interpretation of the length of the cross product can be seen by looking at
Figure 6. If 
and 
are represented by directed line segments with the same initial point,
then they determine a parallelogram with base 
, altitude 
, and area
The length of the cross product 
is equal to the area of the parallelogram
determined by and .
The Cross Product in Component Form
Suppose
and 
are given in component form:
We can express 
in component form by using the Vector Distributive Laws together
with the results from Example 2:
If 
and 
, then
In order to make this expression for

determinants. A determinant of order 2 is deﬁned by

VECTORS AND THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE
A determinant of order 3 can be deﬁned in terms of second-order determinants as 
follows:
Observe that each term on the right side of Equation 3 involves a number 
in the ﬁrst row
of the determinant, and 
is multiplied by the second-order determinant obtained from the
left side by deleting the row and column in which 
appears. Notice also the minus sign
in the second term. For example,
If we now rewrite the expression for 
in (2) using second-order determinants 
and the standard basis vectors , , and , we see that the cross product of the vectors
and 
is
In view of the similarity between Equations 3 and 4, we often write
Although the ﬁrst row of the symbolic determinant in Equation 5 consists of vectors, if we
expand it as if it were an ordinary determinant using the rule in Equation 3, we obtain
Equation 4. The symbolic formula in Equation 5 is probably the easiest way of remember-
ing and computing cross products.

THE CROSS PRODUCT

SOLUTION The vector PQ
l
PR
l is perpendicular to both PQ
l and PR
l and is therefore
perpendicular to the plane through , , and . We know from (9.2.1) that
PQ
l
PR
l
We compute the cross product of these vectors:
PQ
l
PR
l
So the vector 
is perpendicular to the given plane. Any nonzero scalar
multiple of this vector, such as 
, is also perpendicular to the plane.
Find the area of the triangle with vertices 
, 
, 
and 
.
SOLUTION In Example 4 we computed that PQ

. The area of
the parallelogram with adjacent sides 
and 
is the length of this cross product:
PQ
l
PR
l
The area 
of the triangle 
is half the area of this parallelogram, that is, 
.
Triple Products
The product 
is called the scalar triple product of the vectors , , and .  Its
geometric signiﬁcance can be seen by considering the parallelepiped determined by the
vectors , , and . (See Figure 7.) The area of the base parallelogram is 
. If
is the angle between the vectors 
and 
, then the height 
of the parallelepiped is
. (We must use 
instead of 
in case 
.) Thus the volume
of the parallelepiped is
Therefore we have proved the following:
The volume of the parallelepiped determined by the vectors , , and is the mag-
nitude of their scalar triple product:
Instead of thinking of the parallelepiped as having its base parallelogram determined by
and , we can think of it with base parallelogram determined by
and . In this way, we
see that

But the dot product is commutative, so we can write
Suppose that , , and are given in component form:
Then
This shows that we can write the scalar triple product of , , and 
as the determinant
whose rows are the components of these vectors:
Coplanar vectors
Use the scalar triple product to show that the vectors
, 
, and 
are coplanar; that is, they lie in
the same plane.
SOLUTION We use Equation 7 to compute their scalar triple product:
Therefore the volume of the parallelepiped determined by , , and is 0. This means
that , , and are coplanar.
The product 
is called the vector triple product of , , and . The proof
of the following formula for the vector triple product is left as Exercise 36.

EQUATIONS OF LINES AND PLANES
663
A line in the 
-plane is determined when a point on the line and the direction of the line
(its slope or angle of inclination) are given. The equation of the line can then be written
using the point-slope form.
Likewise, a line 
in three-dimensional space is determined when we know a point
on 
and the direction of . In three dimensions the direction of a line is con-
veniently described by a vector, so we let 
be a vector parallel to . Let 
be an
arbitrary point on 
and let 
and be the position vectors of 
and 
(that is, they have
representations OP
A and OP
A). If 
is the vector with representation P P
A, as in Figure 1,
then the Triangle Law for vector addition gives 
. But, since and are parallel
vectors, there is a scalar such that 
. Thus 
which is a vector equation of . Each value of the parameter
gives the position vector
of a point on . In other words, as varies, the line is traced out by the tip of the vector .
As Figure 2 indicates, positive values of correspond to points on 
that lie on one side 
of 
, whereas negative values of correspond to points that lie on the other side of 
If the vector 
that gives the direction of the line 
is written in component form as
, then we have 
. We can also write 
and
, so the vector equation (1) becomes
Two vectors are equal if and only if corresponding components are equal. Therefore we
have the three scalar equations:
where 
. These equations are called parametric equations of the line 
through the
point 
and parallel to the vector 
. Each value of the parameter 
gives a point 
on .

VECTORS AND THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE
Equations of a line with a given direction
(a) Find a vector equation and parametric equations for the line that passes through the
point 
and is parallel to the vector 
.
(b) Find two other points on the line.
SOLUTION
(a) Here 
and 
, so the vector equa-
tion (1) becomes
or
Parametric equations are
(b) Choosing the parameter value 
gives 
, 
, and 
so 
is a
point on the line. Similarly, 
gives the point 
.
The vector equation and parametric equations of a line are not unique. If we change the
point or the parameter or choose a different parallel vector, then the equations change. For
instance, if, instead of 
, we choose the point 
in Example 1, then the para-
metric equations of the line become
Or, if we stay with the point 
but choose the parallel vector 
, we
arrive at the equations
In general, if a vector 
is used to describe the direction of a line , then
the numbers , , and are called direction numbers of . Since any vector parallel to 
could also be used, we see that any three numbers proportional to , , and could also be
used as a set of direction numbers for .
Another way of describing a line 
is to eliminate the parameter from Equations 2. If
none of , , or is , we can solve each of these equations for , equate the results, and
obtain
These equations are called symmetric equations of . Notice that the numbers , , and
that appear in the denominators of Equations 3 are direction numbers of , that is, com-
ponents of a vector parallel to . If one of , , or 
is , we can still eliminate . For
instance, if 
, we could write the equations of 
as
This means that 
lies in the vertical plane

Equations of a line through two points
(a) Find parametric equations and symmetric equations of the line that passes through
the points 
and 
.
(b) At what point does this line intersect the 
-plane?
SOLUTION
(a) We are not explicitly given a vector parallel to the line, but observe that the vector 
with representation 
is parallel to the line and
Thus direction numbers are 
, 
, and 
. Taking the point 
as 
,we see that parametric equations (2) are
and symmetric equations (3) are
(b) The line intersects the 
-plane when 
, so we put 
in the symmetric equa-
tions and obtain
This gives 
and 
, so the line intersects the 
-plane at the point 
.
In general, the procedure of Example 2 shows that direction numbers of the line
through the points 
and 
are 
, 
, and 
and so
symmetric equations of 
are
Often, we need a description, not of an entire line, but of just a line segment. How, for
instance, could we describe the line segment 
in Example 2? If we put 
in the para-
metric equations in Example 2(a), we get the point 
and if we put 
we get
. So the line segment 
is described by the parametric equations
or by the corresponding vector equation
In general, we know from Equation 1 that the vector equation of a line through the (tip
of the) vector 
in the direction of a vector is 
. If the line also passes through
(the tip of) , then we can take 
and so its vector equation is

The line segment from

.
The line segment from

is given by the vector equation
Show that the lines 
and 
with parametric equations
are skew lines; that is, they do not intersect and are not parallel (and therefore do not lie
in the same plane).
SOLUTION The lines are not parallel because the corresponding vectors 
and
are not parallel. (Their components are not proportional.) If 
and 
had a
point of intersection, there would be values of and such that
But if we solve the ﬁrst two equations, we get 
and 
, and these values don’t
satisfy the third equation. Therefore there are no values of and that satisfy the three
equations, so 
and 
do not intersect. Thus 
and 
are skew lines.
Planes
Although a line in space is determined by a point and a direction, a plane in space is 
more difﬁcult to describe. A single vector parallel to a plane is not enough to convey the
“direction” of the plane, but a vector perpendicular to the plane does completely specify
its direction. Thus a plane in space is determined by a point 
in the plane and
a vector 
that is orthogonal to the plane. This orthogonal vector 
is called a normal 
vector. Let 
be an arbitrary point in the plane, and let 
and 
be the position
vectors of 
and . Then the vector 
is represented by P P
A. (See Figure 6.) The nor-
mal vector 
is orthogonal to every vector in the given plane. In particular, 
is orthogonal
to 
and so we have
which can be rewritten as
Either Equation 5 or Equation 6 is called a vector equation of the plane.

To ﬁnd the -intercept we set

. Similarly, the
-intercept is 4 and the -intercept is 3. This enables us to sketch the portion of the plane
that lies in the ﬁrst octant (see Figure 7).
By collecting terms in Equation 7 as we did in Example 4, we can rewrite the equation
of a plane as

versely, it can be shown that if , , and are not all 0, then the linear equation (8) repre-

Find the point at which the line with parametric equations 
,
, 
intersects the plane 
.
SOLUTION We substitute the expressions for , , and from the parametric equations
into the equation of the plane:
This simpliﬁes to 
, so 
. Therefore the point of intersection occurs
when the parameter value is 
. Then 
, 
,
and so the point of intersection is 
Two planes are parallel if their normal vectors are parallel. For instance, the planes
and 
are parallel because their normal vectors are
and 
and 
. If two planes are not parallel, then
they intersect in a straight line and the angle between the two planes is deﬁned as the acute
angle between their normal vectors (see angle 
in Figure 9).
Angle between planes; line of intersection of planes
(a) Find the angle between the planes 
and 
.
(b) Find symmetric equations for the line of intersection 
of these two planes.
SOLUTION
(a) The normal vectors of these planes are
and so, if is the angle between the planes,
(b) We ﬁrst need to ﬁnd a point on . For instance, we can ﬁnd the point where the line
intersects the 
-plane by setting 
in the equations of both planes. This gives the
equations 
and 
, whose solution is 
, 
. So the point
lies on .
Now we observe that, since 
lies in both planes, it is perpendicular to both of the
normal vectors. Thus a vector 
parallel to 
is given by the cross product
and so the symmetric equations of 
can be written as
Note: Since a linear equation in , , and 
represents a plane and two nonparallel
planes intersect in a line, it follows that two linear equations can represent a line. The

Another way to ﬁnd the line of intersection is
to solve the equations of the planes for two of

and
lie on both of these planes, and so the pair of linear equations represents the line of inter-
section of the planes (if they are not parallel). For instance, in Example 7 the line 
was
given as the line of intersection of the planes 
and 
. The
symmetric equations that we found for 
could be written as
which is again a pair of linear equations. They exhibit 
as the line of intersection of the
planes 
and 
. (See Figure 11.)
In general, when we write the equations of a line in the symmetric form
we can regard the line as the line of intersection of the two planes
Find a formula for the distance 
from a point 
to the 
plane 
.
SOLUTION Let 
be any point in the given plane and let 
be the vector
corresponding to P P
A. Then
From Figure 12 you can see that the distance 
from 
to the plane is equal to the
absolute value of the scalar projection of 
onto the normal vector 
. (See
Section 9.3.) Thus
Since 
lies in the plane, its coordinates satisfy the equation of the plane and so we
have 
. Thus the formula for

we choose any point on one plane and calculate its distance to the other plane. In par-

is
So the distance between the planes is 
.
Distance between lines
In Example 3 we showed that the lines
are skew. Find the distance between them.
SOLUTION Since the two lines 
and 
are skew, they can be viewed as lying on two
parallel planes 
and 
. The distance between 
and 
is the same as the distance
between 
and 
, which can be computed as in Example 9. The common normal vec-
tor to both planes must be orthogonal to both 
(the direction of 
) and
(the direction of 
). So a normal vector is
If we put 
in the equations of

on 
and so an equa-
tion for 
is
If we now set 
in the equations for

the distance between

LABORATORY PROJECT
Putting 3D in Perspective
Computer graphics programmers face the same challenge as the great painters of the past: how 
to represent a three-dimensional scene as a ﬂat image on a two-dimensional plane (a screen or a
canvas). To create the illusion of perspective, in which closer objects appear larger than those
farther away, three-dimensional objects in the computer’s memory are projected onto a rect-
angular screen window from a viewpoint where the eye, or camera, is located. The viewing
volume––the portion of space that will be visible––is the region contained by the four planes that
pass through the viewpoint and an edge of the screen window. If objects in the scene extend

SECTION 9.6
FUNCTIONS AND SURFACES

In this section we take a ﬁrst look at functions of two variables and their graphs, which are
surfaces in three-dimensional space. We will give a much more thorough treatment of such
functions in Chapter 11.
Functions of Two Variables
The temperature 
at a point on the surface of the earth at any given time depends on the
longitude 
and latitude 
of the point. We can think of 
as being a function of the two
variables and , or as a function of the pair 
. We indicate this functional dependence
by writing 
.
The volume 
of a circular cylinder depends on its radius and its height . In fact, we
know that
. We say that
is a function of
and , and we write
.
Deﬁnition A function
of two variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair
of real numbers 
in a set 
a unique real number denoted by 
. The set
is the domain of 
and its range is the set of values that 
takes on, that is,
.
We often write 
to make explicit the value taken on by 
at the general point
. The variables and are independent variables and is the dependent variable.
[Compare this with the notation 
for functions of a single variable.]
The domain is a subset of 
, the 
-plane. We can think of the domain as the set of all
possible inputs and the range as the set of all possible outputs. If a function 
is given by
a formula and no domain is speciﬁed, then the domain of 
is understood to be the set of
all pairs 
for which the given expression is a well-deﬁned real number.
Domain and range
If 
, then 
is deﬁned for all 
possible ordered pairs of real numbers 
, so the domain is 
, the entire 
-plane.
The range of 
is the set 
of all nonnegative real numbers. [Notice that 
and
, so 
for all and .]

beyond these four planes, they must be truncated before pixel data are sent to the screen. These
planes are therefore called clipping planes.
1. Suppose the screen is represented by a rectangle in the 
-plane with vertices 
and 
, and the camera is placed at 
. A line 
in the scene passes
through the points 
and 
. At what points should 
be clipped
by the clipping planes?
2. If the clipped line segment is projected on the screen window, identify the resulting line
segment.
3. Use parametric equations to plot the edges of the screen window, the clipped line segment,
and its projection on the screen window. Then add sight lines connecting the viewpoint to
each end of the clipped segments to verify that the projection is correct.
4. A rectangle with vertices 
, 
, 
, and
is added to the scene. The line 
intersects this rectangle. To make the rect-
angle appear opaque, a programmer can use hidden line rendering, which removes portions
of objects that are behind other objects. Identify the portion of 
that should be removed.

Sketching domains

and

(b)
SOLUTION
(a)
The expression for 
makes sense if the denominator is not 0 and the quantity under the
square root sign is nonnegative. So the domain of 
is
The inequality 
, or 
, describes the points that lie on or above
the line 
, while 
means that the points on the line 
must be
excluded from the domain. (See Figure 1.)
(b)
Since 
is deﬁned only when 
, that is, 
, the domain of 
is
. This is the set of points to the left of the parabola 
. (See
Figure 2.)
Not all functions can be represented by explicit formulas. The function in the next
example is described verbally and by numerical estimates of its values.
Wave height as a function of wind speed and time
The wave heights (in feet)
in the open sea depend mainly on the speed of the wind (in knots) and the length of
time (in hours) that the wind has been blowing at that speed. So is a function of and
and we can write 
. Observations and measurements have been made by mete-
orologists and oceanographers and are recorded in Table 1.
For instance, the table indicates that if the wind has been blowing at 50 knots for
30 hours, then the wave heights are estimated to be 45 ft, so

The domain of this function is given by 
and 
. Although there is no exact
formula for in terms of and , we will see that the operations of calculus can still be
carried out for such an experimentally deﬁned function.
Graphs
One way of visualizing the behavior of a function of two variables is to consider its graph.
Definition If
is a function of two variables with domain D, then the graph of 
is the set of all points 
in 
such that 
and 
is in D.
Just as the graph of a function 
of one variable is a curve 
with equation 
so
the graph of a function 
of two variables is a surface with equation 
. We can
visualize the graph 
of 
as lying directly above or below its domain 
in the 
-plane
(see Figure 3).
Graphing a linear function
Sketch the graph of the function
.
SOLUTION The graph of 
has the equation 
, or 
,
which represents a plane. To graph the plane we ﬁrst ﬁnd the intercepts. Putting
in the equation, we get 
as the -intercept. Similarly, the -intercept is 3
and the -intercept is 6. This helps us sketch the portion of the graph that lies in the ﬁrst
octant in Figure 4.
The function in Example 4 is a special case of the function
which is called a linear function. The graph of such a function has the equation
or
so it is a plane. In much the same way that linear functions of one variable are important
in single-variable calculus, we will see that linear functions of two variables play a central
role in multivariable calculus.
Sketch the graph of the function 
.
SOLUTION Notice that, no matter what value we give , the value of 
is always 
.
The equation of the graph is 
, which doesn’t involve y. This means that any verti-
cal plane with equation 
(parallel to the 
-plane) intersects the graph in a curve
with equation 
, that is, a parabola. Figure 5 shows how the graph is formed by
taking the parabola 
in the 
-plane and moving it in the direction of the y-axis. So
the graph is a surface, called a parabolic cylinder, made up of inﬁnitely many shifted
copies of the same parabola.
In sketching the graphs of functions of two variables, it’s often useful to start by deter-
mining the shapes of cross-sections (slices) of the graph. For example, if we keep ﬁxed
by putting 
(a constant) and letting 
vary, the result is a function of one variable
, whose graph is the curve that results when we intersect the surface 
with the vertical plane 
. In a similar fashion we can slice the surface with the 
vertical plane 
and look at the curves 
. We can also slice with horizontal
planes 
. All three types of curves are called traces (or cross-sections) of the surface

Use traces to sketch the graph of the function 
.
SOLUTION The equation of the graph is 
. If we put 
, we get 
, 
so the 
-plane intersects the surface in a parabola. If we put 
(a constant), we 
get 
. This means that if we slice the graph with any plane parallel to the 
-plane, we obtain a parabola that opens upward. Similarly, if 
, the trace is
, which is again a parabola that opens upward. If we put 
, we get the
horizontal traces 
, which we recognize as a family of ellipses. Knowing the
shapes of the traces, we can sketch the graph of 
in Figure 6. Because of the elliptical
and parabolic traces, the surface 
is called an elliptic paraboloid.

SOLUTION The traces in the vertical planes 
are the parabolas 
, which
open upward. The traces in 
are the parabolas 
, which open down-
ward. The horizontal traces are 
, a family of hyperbolas. We draw the fami-
lies of traces in Figure 7 and we show how the traces appear when placed in their correct
planes in Figure 8.

In Figure 9 we ﬁt together the traces from Figure 8 to form the surface 
, 
a hyperbolic paraboloid. Notice that the shape of the surface near the origin resembles
that of a saddle. This surface will be investigated further in Section 11.7 when we dis-
cuss saddle points.
The idea of using traces to draw a surface is employed in three-dimensional graphing
software for computers. In most such software, traces in the vertical planes 
and
are drawn for equally spaced values of and parts of the graph are eliminated using
hidden line removal. Figure 10 shows computer-generated graphs of several functions.
Notice that we get an especially good picture of a function when rotation is used to give
views from different vantage points. In parts (a) and (b) the graph of is very ﬂat and close
to the 
-plane except near the origin; this is because 
is very small when or is
large.

Quadric Surfaces
The graph of a second-degree equation in three variables , , and is called a quadric
surface. We have already sketched the quadric surfaces 
(an elliptic parab-
oloid) and 
(a hyperbolic paraboloid) in Figures 6 and 9. In the next example
we investigate a quadric surface called an ellipsoid.
Sketch the quadric surface with equation
SOLUTION The trace in the xy-plane 
is 
, which we recognize as an
equation of an ellipse. In general, the horizontal trace in the plane 
is
which is an ellipse, provided that 
, that is, 
.
Similarly, the vertical traces are also ellipses:
Figure 11 shows how drawing some traces indicates the shape of the surface. It’s called
an ellipsoid because all of its traces are ellipses. Notice that it is symmetric with respect
to each coordinate plane; this symmetry is a reﬂection of the fact that its equation
involves only even powers of x, y, and .
The ellipsoid in Example 8 is not the graph of a function because some vertical lines
(such as the -axis) intersect it more than once. But the top and bottom halves are graphs
of functions. In fact, if we solve the equation of the ellipsoid for , we get 
So the graphs of the functions
and
are the top and bottom halves of the ellipsoid (see Figure 12). The domain of both 
and
is the set of all points 
such that
so the domain is the set of all points that lie on or inside the ellipse

CHAPTER 9
VECTORS AND THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE
In plane geometry the polar coordinate system is used to give a convenient description of
certain curves and regions. (See Appendix H.) Figure 1 enables us to recall the connection
between polar and Cartesian coordinates. If the point 
has Cartesian coordinates 
and polar coordinates 
, then, from the ﬁgure,
In three dimensions there are two coordinate systems that are similar to polar coordi-
nates and give convenient descriptions of some commonly occurring surfaces and solids.
They will be especially useful in Chapter 12 when we compute volumes and triple integrals.
Cylindrical Coordinates
In the cylindrical coordinate system, a point 
in three-dimensional space is represented
by the ordered triple 
, where 
and 
are polar coordinates of the projection of 
onto the 
-plane and is the directed distance from the 
-plane to . (See Figure 2.)
To convert from cylindrical to rectangular coordinates, we use the equations
whereas to convert from rectangular to cylindrical coordinates, we use
Converting between cylindrical and rectangular coordinates

and ﬁnd its rectangular 
coordinates.
(b) Find cylindrical coordinates of the point with rectangular coordinates

SOLUTION

is plotted in Figure 3. From

(b) From Equations 2 we have
so
Therefore one set of cylindrical coordinates is 
. Another is
. As with polar coordinates, there are inﬁnitely many choices.
Cylindrical coordinates are useful in problems that involve symmetry about an axis, and
the -axis is chosen to coincide with this axis of symmetry. For instance, the axis of the
circular cylinder with Cartesian equation 
is the -axis. In cylindrical coordi-
nates this cylinder has the very simple equation 
. (See Figure 4.) This is the reason for
the name “cylindrical” coordinates.
Describe the surface whose equation in cylindrical coordinates is 
.
SOLUTION The equation says that the -value, or height, of each point on the surface is
the same as r, the distance from the point to the -axis. Because 
doesn’t appear, it can
vary. So any horizontal trace in the plane 
is a circle of radius k. These
traces suggest that the surface is a cone. This prediction can be conﬁrmed by converting
the equation into rectangular coordinates. From the ﬁrst equation in (2) we have
We recognize the equation 
(by comparison with Table 2 in Section 9.6) as
being a circular cone whose axis is the -axis (see Figure 5).

nates for the ellipsoid

The spherical coordinates

in space are shown in Figure 6, where
is the distance from the origin to , 
is the same angle as in cylindrical coor-
dinates, and 
is the angle between the positive -axis and the line segment

The spherical coordinate system is especially useful in problems where there is symmetry
about a point, and the origin is placed at this point. For example, the sphere with center the
origin and radius 
has the simple equation 
(see Figure 7); this is the reason for 
the name “spherical” coordinates. The graph of the equation 
is a vertical half-plane
(see Figure 8), and the equation 
represents a half-cone with the axis as its axis (see
Figure 9).
The relationship between rectangular and spherical coordinates can be seen from Fig-
ure 10. From triangles 
and 
we have
But 
and 
, so to convert from spherical to rectangular coordinates, we
use the equations
Also, the distance formula shows that
We use this equation in converting from rectangular to spherical coordinates.

FIGURE 12
Most three-dimensional graphing programs 
can graph surfaces whose equations are given
in cylindrical or spherical coordinates. As
Example 8 demonstrates, this is often the most
convenient way of drawing a solid.
Use a computer to draw a picture of the solid that remains when a hole of
radius 3 is drilled through the center of a sphere of radius 4.
SOLUTION To keep the equations simple, let’s choose the coordinate system so that the
center of the sphere is at the origin and the axis of the cylinder that forms the hole is the
-axis. We could use either cylindrical or spherical coordinates to describe the solid, but
the description is somewhat simpler if we use cylindrical coordinates. Then the equa-
tion of the cylinder is 
and the equation of the sphere is 
, or
. The points in the solid lie outside the cylinder and inside the sphere, so
they satisfy the inequalities
To ensure that the computer graphs only the appropriate parts of these surfaces, we ﬁnd
where they intersect by solving the equations 
and 
:
The solid lies between 
and 
, so we ask the computer to graph the
surfaces with the following equations and domains:
The resulting picture, shown in Figure 12, is exactly what we want.

1. Each edge of a cubical box has length 1 m. The box contains nine spherical balls with the
same radius . The center of one ball is at the center of the cube and it touches the other eight
balls. Each of the other eight balls touches three sides of the box. Thus the balls are tightly
packed in the box. (See the ﬁgure.) Find . (If you have trouble with this problem, read about
the problem-solving strategy entitled Use Analogy on page 83.)

airﬁeld and heads due north according to the plane’s compass. After 30 minutes of ﬂight

5° east of north.

Vector Functions
The functions that we have been using so far have been real-valued functions.
We now study functions whose values are vectors because such functions are
needed to describe curves and surfaces in space. We will also use vector-valued
functions to describe the motion of objects through space. In particular, we will
use them to derive Kepler’s laws of planetary motion.

CHAPTER 10
VECTOR FUNCTIONS
In general, a function is a rule that assigns to each element in the domain an element in the
range. A vector-valued function, or vector function, is simply a function whose domain
is a set of real numbers and whose range is a set of vectors. We are most interested in vec-
tor functions whose values are three-dimensional vectors. This means that for every num-
ber in the domain of there is a unique vector in 
denoted by 
. If 
, 
, and 
are the components of the vector 
, then , , and are real-valued functions called the
component functions of and we can write
We use the letter to denote the independent variable because it represents time in most
applications of vector functions.
Domain of a vector function
If
then the component functions are
By our usual convention, the domain of consists of all values of for which the 
expression for 
is deﬁned. The expressions , 
, and 
are all deﬁned 
when 
and 
. Therefore the domain of is the interval 
.
The limit of a vector function is deﬁned by taking the limits of its component func-
tions as follows.
If 
, then
provided the limits of the component functions exist.
Limits of vector functions obey the same rules as limits of real-valued functions (see
Exercise 45).
Find

A vector function is continuous at a if
In view of Deﬁnition 1, we see that is continuous at if and only if its component func-
tions , , and are continuous at .
There is a close connection between continuous vector functions and space curves.
Suppose that , , and are continuous real-valued functions on an interval . Then the set
of all points 
in space, where
and 
varies throughout the interval , is called a space curve. The equations in (2) are
called parametric equations of C and is called a parameter. We can think of 
as being
traced out by a moving particle whose position at time is 
. If we now con-
sider the vector function 
, then 
is the position vector of the
point 
on . Thus any continuous vector function deﬁnes a space curve
that is traced out by the tip of the moving vector 
, as shown in Figure 1.
Describe the curve deﬁned by the vector function
SOLUTION The corresponding parametric equations are
which we recognize from Equations 9.5.2 as parametric equations of a line passing
through the point 
and parallel to the vector 
. Alternatively, we could
observe that the function can be written as 
, where 
and
, and this is the vector equation of a line as given by Equation 9.5.1.
Plane curves can also be represented in vector notation. For instance, the curve given
by the parametric equations 
and 
(see Example 1 in Section 1.7)
could also be described by the vector equation
where 
and 
.
Sketching a helix
Sketch the curve whose vector equation is
SOLUTION The parametric equations for this curve are
Since 
, the curve must lie on the circular cylinder
. The point 
lies directly above the point 
, which moves 
counterclockwise around the circle 
in the xy-plane. (The projection of the
curve onto the 
-plane has vector equation 
. See Example 2 in
Section 1.7.) Since 
, the curve spirals upward around the cylinder as increases.
The curve, shown in Figure 2, is called a helix.

CHAPTER 10
VECTOR FUNCTIONS
The corkscrew shape of the helix in Example 4 is familiar from its occurrence in coiled
springs. It also occurs in the model of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid, the genetic material
of living cells). In 1953 James Watson and Francis Crick showed that the structure of the
DNA molecule is that of two linked, parallel helixes that are intertwined as in Figure 3.
In Examples 3 and 4 we were given vector equations of curves and asked for a geo-
metric description or sketch. In the next two examples we are given a geometric descrip-
tion of a curve and are asked to ﬁnd parametric equations for the curve.
Find a vector equation and parametric equations for the line segment that
joins the point 
to the point 
.
SOLUTION In Section 9.5 we found a vector equation for the line segment that joins the
tip of the vector 
to the tip of the vector :
(See Equation 9.5.4.) Here we take 
and 
to obtain a
vector equation of the line segment from 
to 
:
or
The corresponding parametric equations are
The intersection of two surfaces is a space curve
Find a vector function
that represents the curve of intersection of the cylinder 
and the plane

the curve of intersection C, which is an ellipse.

The projection of C onto the xy-plane is the circle 
. So we know
from Example 2 in Section 1.7 that we can write
From the equation of the plane, we have
So we can write parametric equations for C as
The corresponding vector equation is
This equation is called a parametrization of the curve C. The arrows in Figure 6 indicate
the direction in which C is traced as the parameter t increases.
Using Computers to Draw Space Curves
Space curves are inherently more difﬁcult to draw by hand than plane curves; for an accu-
rate representation we need to use technology. For instance, Figure 7 shows a computer-
generated graph of the curve with parametric equations
It’s called a toroidal spiral because it lies on a torus. Another interesting curve, the tre-
foil knot, with equations
is graphed in Figure 8. It wouldn’t be easy to plot either of these curves by hand.
Even when a computer is used to draw a space curve, optical illusions make it difﬁcult
to get a good impression of what the curve really looks like. (This is especially true in
Figure 8. See Exercise 46.) The next example shows how to cope with this problem.
Use a computer to draw the curve with vector equation 
This curve is called a twisted cubic.

see the true nature of the curve from that graph alone. Most three-dimensional computer
graphing programs allow the user to enclose a curve or surface in a box instead of dis-
playing the coordinate axes. When we look at the same curve in a box in Figure 9(b), we
have a much clearer picture of the curve. We can see that it climbs from a lower corner
of the box to the upper corner nearest us, and it twists as it climbs.
We get an even better idea of the curve when we view it from different vantage
points. Part (c) shows the result of rotating the box to give another viewpoint. Parts (d),
(e), and (f) show the views we get when we look directly at a face of the box. In par-
ticular, part (d) shows the view from directly above the box. It is the projection of the
curve on the 
-plane, namely, the parabola 
. Part (e) shows the projection on 
the 
-plane, the cubic curve 
. It’s now obvious why the given curve is called a
twisted cubic.
Another method of visualizing a space curve is to draw it on a surface. For instance, the
twisted cubic in Example 7 lies on the parabolic cylinder 
. (Eliminate the parameter
from the ﬁrst two parametric equations, 
and 
.) Figure 10 shows both the cylin-
der and the twisted cubic, and we see that the curve moves upward from the origin along
the surface of the cylinder. We also used this method in Example 4 to visualize the helix
lying on the circular cylinder (see Figure 2).

A third method for visualizing the twisted cubic is to realize that it also lies on the cylin-
der 
. So it can be viewed as the curve of intersection of the cylinders 
and
. (See Figure 11.)
We have seen that an interesting space curve, the helix, occurs in the model of DNA.
Another notable example of a space curve in science is the trajectory of a positively
charged particle in orthogonally oriented electric and magnetic ﬁelds E and B. Depending
on the initial velocity given the particle at the origin, the path of the particle is either a
space curve whose projection on the horizontal plane is the cycloid we studied in Section
1.7 [Figure 12(a)] or a curve whose projection is the trochoid investigated in Exercise 38
in Section 1.7 [Figure 12(b)].

the particles, see the following web sites:

Some computer algebra systems provide us
with a clearer picture of a space curve by
enclosing it in a tube. Such a plot enables us
to see whether one part of a curve passes in
front of or behind another part of the curve. 
For example, Figure 13 shows the curve of 
Figure 12(b) as rendered by the tubeplot
command in Maple.

curves, it’s often important to know whether they will collide.
(Will a missile hit its moving target? Will two aircraft
collide?) The curves might intersect, but we need to know
whether the objects are in the same position at the same time.
Suppose the trajectories of two particles are given by the vec-
tor functions
for

46. The view of the trefoil knot shown in Figure 8 is accurate,
but it doesn’t reveal the whole story. Use the parametric
equations
to sketch the curve by hand as viewed from above, with gaps
indicating where the curve passes over itself. Start by show-
ing that the projection of the curve onto the 
-plane has
polar coordinates 
and 
, so varies
between 1 and 3. Then show that has maximum and mini-
mum values when the projection is halfway between 
and 
.
;
When you have ﬁnished your sketch, use a computer to
draw the curve with viewpoint directly above and compare
with your sketch. Then use the computer to draw the curve
from several other viewpoints. You can get a better impres-
sion of the curve if you plot a tube with radius 0.2 around 
the curve. (Use the tubeplot command in Maple or the
tubecurve or Tube command in Mathematica.)

l represents the vector

multiple 
has the same direction as

, it
appears that this vector approaches a vector that lies on the tangent line. For this reason,
the vector

vided that

. The tangent line to

Thus

Geometrically, this result says that if a curve lies on a sphere with center the origin,
then the tangent vector 
is always perpendicular to the position vector 
.
Integrals
The deﬁnite integral of a continuous vector function 
can be deﬁned in much the same
way as for real-valued functions except that the integral is a vector. But then we can
express the integral of in terms of the integrals of its component functions , , and as
follows. (We use the notation of Chapter 5.)
and so
This means that we can evaluate an integral of a vector function by integrating each com-
ponent function.
We can extend the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to continuous vector functions as
follows:
where

. We use the notation

VECTOR FUNCTIONS
Notice that both of the arc length formulas (1) and (2) can be put into the more com-
pact form
because, for plane curves 
,
and for space curves 
,
Find the length of the arc of the circular helix with vector equation
from the point 
to the point 
.
SOLUTION Since 
, we have
The arc from 
to 
is described by the parameter interval 
and so, from Formula 3, we have
A single curve 
can be represented by more than one vector function. For instance, the
twisted cubic
could also be represented by the function
where the connection between the parameters 
and 
is given by 
. We say that
Equations 4 and 5 are parametrizations of the curve . If we were to use Equation 3 to
compute the length of 
using Equations 4 and 5, we would get the same answer. In gen-
eral, it can be shown that when Equation 3 is used to compute arc length, the answer is
independent of the parametrization that is used.
Now we suppose that 
is a curve given by a vector function
where 
is continuous and 
is traversed exactly once as increases from to . We deﬁne
its arc length function
by
Thus 
is the length of the part of 
between 
and 
. (See Figure 3.) If we differ-
entiate both sides of Equation 6 using Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we

ARC LENGTH AND CURVATURE
709
It is often useful to parametrize a curve with respect to arc length because arc length
arises naturally from the shape of the curve and does not depend on a particular coordinate
system. If a curve 
is already given in terms of a parameter and 
is the arc length
function given by Equation 6, then we may be able to solve for as a function of :
Then the curve can be reparametrized in terms of by substituting for : 
. Thus,
if 
for instance, 
is the position vector of the point 3 units of length along the
curve from its starting point.
Finding an arc length parametrization
Reparametrize the helix 
with respect to arc length measured
from 
in the direction of increasing .
SOLUTION The initial point 
corresponds to the parameter value 
. From 
Example 1 we have
and so
Therefore 
and the required reparametrization is obtained by substituting for :
Curvature
A parametrization 
is called smooth on an interval if 
is continuous and 
on . A curve is called smooth if it has a smooth parametrization. A smooth curve has no
sharp corners or cusps; when the tangent vector turns, it does so continuously.
If 
is a smooth curve deﬁned by the vector function , recall that the unit tangent vec-
tor 
is given by
and indicates the direction of the curve. From Figure 4 you can see that 
changes direc-
tion very slowly when 
is fairly straight, but it changes direction more quickly when 
bends or twists more sharply.
The curvature of 
at a given point is a measure of how quickly the curve changes direc-
tion at that point. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne it to be the magnitude of the rate of change of the
unit tangent vector with respect to arc length. (We use arc length so that the curvature will
be independent of the parametrization.)
Definition The curvature of a curve is
where 
is the unit tangent vector.
The curvature is easier to compute if it is expressed in terms of the parameter instead
of , so we use the Chain Rule (Theorem 10.2.3, Formula 6) to write

from Equation 7, so the curvature can be written as
A circle has constant curvature
Show that the curvature of a circle of
radius is 
.
SOLUTION We can take the circle to have center the origin, and then a parametrization is
Therefore
so
and
This gives 
, so using Equation 9, we have
The result of Example 3 shows that small circles have large curvature and large circles
have small curvature, in accordance with our intuition. We can see directly from the deﬁ-
nition of curvature that the curvature of a straight line is always 0 because the tangent vec-
tor is constant.
Although Formula 9 can be used in all cases to compute the curvature, the formula
given by the following theorem is often more convenient to apply.
Theorem The curvature of the curve given by the vector function is
PROOF Since

The Normal and Binormal Vectors
At a given point on a smooth space curve 
, there are many vectors that are orthogonal
to the unit tangent vector 
. We single out one by observing that, because 
for all , we have 
by Example 4 in Section 10.2, so 
is orthogonal to
. Note that 
is itself not a unit vector. But at any point where 
we can deﬁne
the principal unit normal vector
(or simply unit normal) as
The vector 
is called the binormal vector. It is perpendicular to both 
and 
and is also a unit vector. (See Figure 6.)
Find the unit normal and binormal vectors for the circular helix
SOLUTION We ﬁrst compute the ingredients needed for the unit normal vector:
This shows that the normal vector at a point on the helix is horizontal and points toward
the -axis. The binormal vector is

The plane determined by the normal and binormal vectors 
and 
at a point 
on a
curve 
is called the normal plane of 
at . It consists of all lines that are orthogonal 
to the tangent vector . The plane determined by the vectors 
and 
is called the oscu-
lating plane of 
at . The name comes from the Latin osculum, meaning “kiss.” It is the
plane that comes closest to containing the part of the curve near . (For a plane curve, the
osculating plane is simply the plane that contains the curve.)
The circle that lies in the osculating plane of 
at , has the same tangent as 
at , lies
on the concave side of 
(toward which 
points), and has radius 
(the reciprocal
of the curvature) is called the osculating circle (or the circle of curvature) of 
at . It is
the circle that best describes how 
behaves near ; it shares the same tangent, normal,
and curvature at .
Find the equations of the normal plane and osculating plane of the helix
in Example 6 at the point 
.
SOLUTION The normal plane at 
has normal vector 
, so an equa-
tion is
The osculating plane at 
contains the vectors 
and , so its normal vector is
. From Example 6 we have
A simpler normal vector is

Find and graph the osculating circle of the parabola 
at the origin.
SOLUTION From Example 5, the curvature of the parabola at the origin is 
. So
the radius of the osculating circle at the origin is 
and its center is 
. Its equa-
tion is therefore
For the graph in Figure 9 we use parametric equations of this circle:
We summarize here the formulas for unit tangent, unit normal and binormal vectors,

In this section we show how the ideas of tangent and normal vectors and curvature can be
used in physics to study the motion of an object, including its velocity and acceleration,
along a space curve. In particular, we follow in the footsteps of Newton by using these
methods to derive Kepler’s First Law of planetary motion.
Suppose a particle moves through space so that its position vector at time 
is 
.
Notice from Figure 1 that, for small values of , the vector
approximates the direction of the particle moving along the curve 
. Its magnitude mea-
sures the size of the displacement vector per unit time. The vector (1) gives the average
velocity over a time interval of length 
and its limit is the velocity vector
at time :
Thus the velocity vector is also the tangent vector and points in the direction of the tangent
line.
The speed of the particle at time is the magnitude of the velocity vector, that is,
.
This is appropriate because, from (2) and from Equation 10.3.7, we have
As in the case of one-dimensional motion, the acceleration of the particle is deﬁned as the
derivative of the velocity:

CHAPTER 10
VECTOR FUNCTIONS
Since 
, we have
Putting 
, we ﬁnd that 
, so
In general, vector integrals allow us to recover velocity when acceleration is known and
position when velocity is known:
If the force that acts on a particle is known, then the acceleration can be found from
Newton’s Second Law of Motion. The vector version of this law states that if, at any time
, a force 
acts on an object of mass 
producing an acceleration 
, then
Uniform circular motion
An object with mass 
that moves in a circular 
path with constant angular speed 
has position vector 
.
Find the force acting on the object and show that it is directed toward the origin.
SOLUTION
Therefore Newton’s Second Law gives the force as
Notice that 
. This shows that the force acts in the direction opposite to
the radius vector 
and therefore points toward the origin (see Figure 5). Such a force
is called a centripetal (center-seeking) force.
Motion of a projectile
A projectile is ﬁred with angle of elevation 
and
initial velocity 
. (See Figure 6.) Assuming that air resistance is negligible and the only
external force is due to gravity, ﬁnd the position function 
of the projectile. What
value of 
maximizes the range (the horizontal distance traveled)?
SOLUTION We set up the axes so that the projectile starts at the origin. Since the force
due to gravity acts downward, we have

Since 
, we have
where 
. Therefore
Integrating again, we obtain
But 
, so the position vector of the projectile is given by
If we write 
(the initial speed of the projectile), then
and Equation 3 becomes
The parametric equations of the trajectory are therefore 
The horizontal distance 
is the value of when 
. Setting 
, we obtain 
or 
. The latter value of then gives
Clearly, 
has its maximum value when 
, that is, 
.
A projectile is ﬁred with muzzle speed 
and angle of elevation
from a position 10 m above ground level. Where does the projectile hit the ground,
and with what speed?
SOLUTION If we place the origin at ground level, then the initial position of the projectile
is (0, 10) and so we need to adjust Equations 4 by adding 10 to the expression for .
With 
, 
, and 
, we have
Impact occurs when 
, that is, 
. Solving this quadratic
equation (and using only the positive value of ), we get
Then 
, so the projectile hits the ground about 2306 m away.

Tangential and Normal Components of Acceleration
When we study the motion of a particle, it is often useful to resolve the acceleration into
two components, one in the direction of the tangent and the other in the direction of the
normal. If we write 
for the speed of the particle, then
and so
If we differentiate both sides of this equation with respect to , we get
If we use the expression for the curvature given by Equation 10.3.9, then we have
The unit normal vector was deﬁned in the preceding section as 
, so (6) gives
and Equation 5 becomes
Writing 
and 
for the tangential and normal components of acceleration, we have
where
This resolution is illustrated in Figure 7.
Let’s look at what Formula 7 says. The ﬁrst thing to notice is that the binormal vector
B is absent. No matter how an object moves through space, its acceleration always lies in
the plane of T and N (the osculating plane). (Recall that T gives the direction of motion
and N points in the direction the curve is turning.) Next we notice that the tangential com-
ponent of acceleration is , the rate of change of speed, and the normal component of
acceleration is 
, the curvature times the square of the speed. This makes sense if we
think of a passenger in a car—a sharp turn in a road means a large value of the curvature
, so the component of the acceleration perpendicular to the motion is large and the pas-
senger is thrown against a car door. High speed around the turn has the same effect; in fact,
if you double your speed, 
is increased by a factor of 4.

Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion
We now describe one of the great accomplishments of calculus by showing how the mate-
rial of this chapter can be used to prove Kepler’s laws of planetary motion. After 20 years
of studying the astronomical observations of the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, the
German mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) formulated the fol-
lowing three laws.

CHAPTER 10
VECTOR FUNCTIONS
Kepler’s Laws
1. A planet revolves around the sun in an elliptical orbit with the sun at one focus.
2. The line joining the sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
3. The square of the period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the cube of
the length of the major axis of its orbit.
In his book Principia Mathematica of 1687, Sir Isaac Newton was able to show that
these three laws are consequences of two of his own laws, the Second Law of Motion and
the Law of Universal Gravitation. In what follows we prove Kepler’s First Law. The
remaining laws are left as exercises (with hints).
Since the gravitational force of the sun on a planet is so much larger than the forces
exerted by other celestial bodies, we can safely ignore all bodies in the universe except the
sun and one planet revolving about it. We use a coordinate system with the sun at the ori-
gin and we let 
be the position vector of the planet. (Equally well, could be the
position vector of the moon or a satellite moving around the earth or a comet moving
around a star.) The velocity vector is 
and the acceleration vector is 
. We use
the following laws of Newton:
where 
is the gravitational force on the planet, 
and 
are the masses of the planet and
the sun, 
is the gravitational constant, 
, and 
is the unit vector in the
direction of .
We ﬁrst show that the planet moves in one plane. By equating the expressions for 
in
Newton’s two laws, we ﬁnd that
and so 
is parallel to . It follows that 
. We use Formula 5 in Theorem 10.2.3
to write
Therefore
where is a constant vector. (We may assume that 
; that is, and are not parallel.)
This means that the vector 
is perpendicular to 
for all values of t, so the planet
always lies in the plane through the origin perpendicular to . Thus the orbit of the planet
is a plane curve.
To prove Kepler’s First Law we rewrite the vector 
as follows:

Integrating both sides of this equation, we get
where is a constant vector.
At this point it is convenient to choose the coordinate axes so that the standard basis
vector 
points in the direction of the vector . Then the planet moves in the 
-plane.
Since both 
and 
are perpendicular to , Equation 11 shows that 
lies in the

direction of , as shown in Figure 8.
If

Kepler’s Laws
Johannes Kepler stated the following three laws of planetary motion on the basis of masses of data
on the positions of the planets at various times.
Kepler’s Laws
1. A planet revolves around the sun in an elliptical orbit with the sun at one focus.
2. The line joining the sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
3. The square of the period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the cube of the
length of the major axis of its orbit.
Kepler formulated these laws because they ﬁtted the astronomical data. He wasn’t able to see why
they were true or how they related to each other. But Sir Isaac Newton, in his Principia Mathemat-
ica of 1687, showed how to deduce Kepler’s three laws from two of Newton’s own laws, the Sec-
ond Law of Motion and the Law of Universal Gravitation. In Section 10.4 we proved Kepler’s First
Law using the calculus of vector functions. In this project we guide you through the proofs of
Kepler’s Second and Third Laws and explore some of their consequences.
1. Use the following steps to prove Kepler’s Second Law. The notation is the same as in 
the proof of the First Law in Section 10.4. In particular, use polar coordinates so that
.
(a) Show that 
.
(b) Deduce that 
.
(c) If 
is the area swept out by the radius vector 
in the time interval 
as in the ﬁgure, show that
(d) Deduce that
This says that the rate at which 
is swept out is constant and proves Kepler’s Second
Law.
2. Let 
be the period of a planet about the sun; that is, 
is the time required for it to travel
once around its elliptical orbit. Suppose that the lengths of the major and minor axes of the
ellipse are 
and 
.
(a) Use part (d) of Problem 1 to show that 
.
(b) Show that 
.
(c) Use parts (a) and (b) to show that 
.
This proves Kepler’s Third Law. [Notice that the proportionality constant 
is
independent of the planet.]

PARAMETRIC SURFACES
727
In Section 9.6 we looked at surfaces that are graphs of functions of two variables. Here we
use vector functions to discuss more general surfaces, called parametric surfaces.
In much the same way that we describe a space curve by a vector function 
of a single
parameter , we can describe a surface by a vector function 
of two parameters 
and . We suppose that
is a vector-valued function deﬁned on a region 
in the 
-plane. So x, y, and , the com-
ponent functions of r, are functions of the two variables u and with domain D. The set
of all points 
in 
such that
and 
varies throughout , is called a parametric surface
and Equations 2 are called
parametric equations of . Each choice of u and 
gives a point on S; by making all 
choices, we get all of S. In other words, the surface 
is traced out by the tip of the posi-
tion vector 
as 
moves throughout the region . (See Figure 1.)

3. The period of the earth’s orbit is approximately 365.25 days. Use this fact and Kepler’s Third
Law to ﬁnd the length of the major axis of the earth’s orbit. You will need the mass of the
sun, 
kg, and the gravitational constant, 
kg .
4. It’s possible to place a satellite into orbit about the earth so that it remains ﬁxed above a given
location on the equator. Compute the altitude that is needed for such a satellite. The earth’s
mass is

chronous Orbit after Arthur C. Clarke, who ﬁrst proposed the idea in 1945. The ﬁrst such
satellite, Syncom II, was launched in July 1963.)

CHAPTER 10
VECTOR FUNCTIONS
So for any point 
on the surface, we have
This means that vertical cross-sections parallel to the 
-plane (that is, with y constant)
are all circles with radius 2. Since 
and no restriction is placed on , the surface is a
circular cylinder with radius 2 whose axis is the y-axis (see Figure 2).
In Example 1 we placed no restrictions on the parameters u and 
and so we got the
entire cylinder. If, for instance, we restrict u and by writing the parameter domain as
then
and we get the quarter-cylinder with length 3 illustrated in
Figure 3.
If a parametric surface S is given by a vector function 
, then there are two useful
families of curves that lie on S, one family with u constant and the other with constant.
These families correspond to vertical and horizontal lines in the 
-plane. If we keep 
constant by putting 
becomes a vector function of the single parame-
ter and deﬁnes a curve 
lying on . (See Figure 4.)
Similarly, if we keep constant by putting 
given by 
that lies on . We call these curves grid curves. (In Example 1, for instance, the grid
curves obtained by letting u be constant are horizontal lines whereas the grid curves with
constant are circles.) In fact, when a computer graphs a parametric surface, it usually
depicts the surface by plotting these grid curves, as we see in the following example.
Use a computer algebra system to graph the surface
Which grid curves have u constant? Which have constant?
SOLUTION We graph the portion of the surface with parameter domain 
in Figure 5. It has the appearance of a spiral tube. To identify the grid
curves, we write the corresponding parametric equations:
If is constant, then 
and 
are constant, so the parametric equations resemble
those of the helix in Example 4 in Section 10.1. Thus the grid curves with constant are
the spiral curves in Figure 5. We deduce that the grid curves with u constant must be the

curves that look like circles in the ﬁgure. Further evidence for this assertion is that if u is
kept constant, 
, then the equation 
shows that the -values vary
from 
to 
.
In Examples 1 and 2 we were given a vector equation and asked to graph the correspon-
ding parametric surface. In the following examples, however, we are given the more chal-
lenging problem of ﬁnding a vector function to represent a given surface. In later chapters
we will often need to do exactly that.
Parametric equations for a plane
Find a vector function that represents the
plane that passes through the point 
with position vector 
and that contains two non-
parallel vectors a and b.
SOLUTION If P is any point in the plane, we can get from 
to 
by moving a certain
distance in the direction of and another distance in the direction of . So there are
scalars u and such that A
. (Figure 6 illustrates how this works, by 
means of the Parallelogram Law, for the case where and are positive. See also 
Exercise 36 in Section 9.2.) If r is the position vector of P, then
A
A
So the vector equation of the plane can be written as
where u and are real numbers.
If we write 
, 
, 
, and 
, 
then we can write the parametric equations of the plane through the point 
as
follows:
Parametrizing a sphere
Find a parametric representation of the sphere
SOLUTION The sphere has a simple representation 
in spherical coordinates, so let’s
choose the angles 
and 
in spherical coordinates as the parameters (see Section 9.7).
Then, putting 
in the equations for conversion from spherical to rectangular coordi-
nates (Equations 9.7.3), we obtain
as the parametric equations of the sphere. The corresponding vector equation is
We have 
and 
, so the parameter domain is the rectangle
. The grid curves with 
constant are the circles of constant lati-
tude (including the equator). The grid curves with
constant are the meridians (semi-
circles), which connect the north and south poles (see Figure 7).

Parametrizing a cylinder
Find a parametric representation for the cylinder

in cylindrical coordinates, so
we choose as parameters 
and in cylindrical coordinates. Then the parametric equa-
tions of the cylinder are

Find a vector function that represents the elliptic paraboloid

SOLUTION If we regard and as parameters, then the parametric equations are simply
and the vector equation is
In general, a surface given as the graph of a function of 
and , that is, with an equa-
tion of the form 
, can always be regarded as a parametric surface by taking 
and as parameters and writing the parametric equations as
Parametric representations (also called parametrizations) of surfaces are not unique. The
next example shows two ways to parametrize a cone.

One of the uses of parametric surfaces is in
computer graphics. Figure 8 shows the result of
trying to graph the sphere 
by solving the equation for and graphing the
top and bottom hemispheres separately. Part 
of the sphere appears to be missing because 
of the rectangular grid system used by the 
computer. The much better picture in Figure 9
was produced by a computer using the 
parametric equations found in Example 4.

coordinates r and . A point

Surfaces of Revolution
Surfaces of revolution can be represented parametrically and thus graphed using a com-
puter. For instance, let’s consider the surface 
obtained by rotating the curve 
,
, about the -axis, where 
. Let 
be the angle of rotation as shown in
Figure 10. If 
is a point on , then
Therefore we take 
and 
as parameters and regard Equations 3 as parametric equations
of . The parameter domain is given by 
, 
.
Graphing a surface of revolution
Find parametric equations for the surface
generated by rotating the curve 
, 
, about the -axis. Use these
equations to graph the surface of revolution.
SOLUTION From Equations 3, the parametric equations are
and the parameter domain is 
, 
. Using a computer to plot these
equations and rotate the image, we obtain the graph in Figure 11.
We can adapt Equations 3 to represent a surface obtained through revolution about the
- or -axis. (See Exercise 30.)

2. A circular curve of radius 
on a highway is banked at an angle
so that a car can safely
traverse the curve without skidding when there is no friction between the road and the tires.
The loss of friction could occur, for example, if the road is covered with a ﬁlm of water or
ice. The rated speed 
of the curve is the maximum speed that a car can attain without skid-
ding. Suppose a car of mass 
is traversing the curve at the rated speed 
Two forces are
acting on the car: the vertical force, 
, due to the weight of the car, and a force 
exerted
by, and normal to, the road (see the ﬁgure).
The vertical component of 
balances the weight of the car, so that

horizontal component of

ond Law and part (d) of Problem 1,

rated speed by

3. A projectile is ﬁred from the origin with angle of elevation 
and initial speed . Assuming
that air resistance is negligible and that the only force acting on the projectile is gravity, , 
we showed in Example 5 in Section 10.4 that the position vector of the projectile is
We also showed that the maximum horizontal distance of the projectile is achieved when
and in this case the range is

(a) At what angle should the projectile be ﬁred to achieve maximum height and what is the
maximum height?

and consider the parabola 
, whose graph is
shown in the ﬁgure. Show that the projectile can hit any target inside or on the boundary
of the region bounded by the parabola and the -axis, and that it can’t hit any target out-
side this region.

regardless of the value , provided the projectile does not hit the ground “before” .
4. (a) A projectile is ﬁred from the origin down an inclined plane that makes an angle 
with
the horizontal. The angle of elevation of the gun and the initial speed of the projectile are
and , respectively. Find the position vector of the projectile and the parametric equa-
tions of the path of the projectile as functions of the time . (Ignore air resistance.)
(b) Show that the angle of elevation 
that will maximize the downhill range is the angle
halfway between the plane and the vertical.
(c) Suppose the projectile is ﬁred up an inclined plane whose angle of inclination is . Show
that, in order to maximize the (uphill) range, the projectile should be ﬁred in the direction
halfway between the plane and the vertical.
(d) In a paper presented in 1686, Edmond Halley summarized the laws of gravity and projec-
tile motion and applied them to gunnery. One problem he posed involved ﬁring a pro-
jectile to hit a target a distance 
up an inclined plane. Show that the angle at which the
projectile should be ﬁred to hit the target but use the least amount of energy is the same
as the angle in part (c). (Use the fact that the energy needed to ﬁre the projectile is pro-
portional to the square of the initial speed, so minimizing the energy is equivalent to
minimizing the initial speed.)

between the path of the ball and the vertical line drawn through the
point of impact (see the ﬁgure).
(c) Suppose the ball rebounds from the ﬂoor at the same angle with which it hits the ﬂoor,
but loses 
of its speed due to energy absorbed by the ball on impact. Where does the
ball strike the ﬂoor on the second bounce?

CHAPTER 11
PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
In Section 9.6 we discussed functions of two variables and their graphs. Here we study
functions of two or more variables from four points of view:
■verbally
(by a description in words)
■numerically
(by a table of values)
■algebraically
(by an explicit formula)
■visually
(by a graph or level curves)
Recall that a function 
of two variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair 
of real numbers in its domain a unique real number denoted by 
. In Example 3 in Sec-
tion 9.6 we looked at the wave heights in the open sea as a function of the wind speed 
and the length of time that the wind has been blowing at that speed. We presented a table
of observed wave heights that represent the function 
numerically. The function
in the next example is also described verbally and numerically.
Wind chill is a function of temperature and wind speed
In regions with severe
winter weather, the wind-chill index is often used to describe the apparent severity of the
cold. This index W is a subjective temperature that depends on the actual temperature T
and the wind speed . So W is a function of T and , and we can write 
. 
Table 1 records values of W compiled by the National Weather Service of the US and the
Meteorological Service of Canada.
For instance, the table shows that if the temperature is 
and the wind speed is
50 kmh, then subjectively it would feel as cold as a temperature of about 
with
no wind. So
The Cobb-Douglas production function
In 1928 Charles Cobb and Paul Dou-
glas published a study in which they modeled the growth of the American economy
during the period 1899–1922. They considered a simpliﬁed view of the economy in

Wind-chill index as a function of 
air temperature and wind speed
THE NEW WIND-CHILL INDEX
A new wind-chill index was introduced in
November of 2001 and is more accurate than
the old index for measuring how cold it feels
when it’s windy. The new index is based on a
model of how fast a human face loses heat. It
was developed through clinical trials in which
volunteers were exposed to a variety of temper-
atures and wind speeds in a refrigerated wind
tunnel.

which production output is determined by the amount of labor involved and the amount
of capital invested. While there are many other factors affecting economic performance,
their model proved to be remarkably accurate. The function they used to model produc-
tion was of the form
where P is the total production (the monetary value of all goods produced in a year), 
L is the amount of labor (the total number of person-hours worked in a year), and K is 
the amount of capital invested (the monetary worth of all machinery, equipment, and
buildings). In Section 11.3 we will show how the form of Equation 1 follows from cer-
tain economic assumptions.
Cobb and Douglas used economic data published by the government to obtain
Table 2. They took the year 1899 as a baseline and P, L, and K for 1899 were each
assigned the value 100. The values for other years were expressed as percentages of 
the 1899 ﬁgures.
Cobb and Douglas used the method of least squares to ﬁt the data of Table 2 to the
function
(See Exercise 49 for the details.)
If we use the model given by the function in Equation 2 to compute the production in
the years 1910 and 1920, we get the values
which are quite close to the actual values, 159 and 231.
The production function (1) has subsequently been used in many settings, ranging
from individual ﬁrms to global economics. It has become known as the Cobb-Douglas
production function.
The domain of the production function in Example 2 is 
because 
and 
represent labor and capital and are therefore never negative. For a func-
tion 
given by an algebraic formula, recall that the domain consists of all pairs 
for
which the expression for 
is a well-deﬁned real number.

Visual Representations
One way to visualize a function of two variables is through its graph. Recall from Section
9.6 that the graph of 
is the surface with equation 
.
Sketch the graph of 
.
SOLUTION The graph has equation 
. We square both sides of this
equation to obtain 
, or 
, which we recognize as an
equation of the sphere with center the origin and radius 3. But, since 
, the graph of
is just the top half of this sphere (see Figure 2).
Note: An entire sphere can’t be represented by a single function of and . As we saw
in Example 4, the upper hemisphere of the sphere 
is represented by the
function 
. The lower hemisphere is represented by the function
.
Use a computer to draw the graph of the Cobb-Douglas production function
.
SOLUTION Figure 3 shows the graph of P for values of the labor L and capital K that lie
between 0 and 300. The computer has drawn the surface by plotting vertical traces. We
see from these traces that the value of the production P increases as either L or K
increases, as is to be expected.
Another method for visualizing functions, borrowed from mapmakers, is a contour map
on which points of constant elevation are joined to form contour lines, or level curves.
Definition The level curves of a function 
of two variables are the curves with
equations 
, where is a constant (in the range of ).
A level curve 
is the set of all points in the domain of 
at which 
takes on
a given value . In other words, it shows where the graph of 
has height .
You can see from Figure 4 the relation between level curves and horizontal traces. The
level curves 
are just the traces of the graph of 
in the horizontal plane 
projected down to the 
-plane. So if you draw the level curves of a function and
visualize them being lifted up to the surface at the indicated height, then you can mentally
piece together a picture of the graph. The surface is steep where the level curves are close
together. It is somewhat ﬂatter where they are farther apart.

FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES

One common example of level curves occurs in topographic maps of mountainous
regions, such as the map in Figure 5. The level curves are curves of constant elevation
above sea level. If you walk along one of these contour lines, you neither ascend nor descend.
Another common example is the temperature at locations 
with longitude
and lati-
tude . Here the level curves are called isothermals and join locations with the same tem-
perature. Figure 6 shows a weather map of the world indicating the average January 
temperatures. The isothermals are the curves that separate the colored bands.
In weather maps of atmospheric pressure at a given time as a function of longitude and
latitude, the level curves are called isobars. They join locations with the same pressure (see

, describes a family of ellipses with semiaxes 
and 
.
Figure 10(a) shows a contour map of h drawn by a computer. Figure 10(b) shows these
level curves lifted up to the graph of h (an elliptic paraboloid) where they become hori-
zontal traces. We see from Figure 10 how the graph of h is put together from the level
curves.
Plot level curves for the Cobb-Douglas production function of Example 2.
SOLUTION In Figure 11 we use a computer to draw a contour plot for the Cobb-
Douglas production function
Level curves are labeled with the value of the production P. For instance, the level curve
labeled 140 shows all values of the labor L and capital investment K that result in a pro-
duction of 
. We see that, for a ﬁxed value of P, as L increases K decreases, and
vice versa.
For some purposes, a contour map is more useful than a graph. That is certainly true in
Example 10. (Compare Figure 11 with Figure 3.) It is also true in estimating function val-
ues, as in Example 6.

Functions of Three or More Variables
A function of three variables, , is a rule that assigns to each ordered triple 
in a
domain 
a unique real number denoted by 
. For instance, the temperature
at a point on the surface of the earth depends on the longitude x and latitude y of the
point and on the time t, so we could write 
.
Find the domain of 
if
SOLUTION The expression for 
is deﬁned as long as 
, so the domain of

This is a half-space consisting of all points that lie above the plane

It’s very difﬁcult to visualize a function 
of three variables by its graph, since that
would lie in a four-dimensional space. However, we do gain some insight into 
by exam-
ining its level surfaces, which are the surfaces with equations 
, where is a
constant. If the point 
moves along a level surface, the value of 
remains
ﬁxed.
Find the level surfaces of the function
SOLUTION The level surfaces are 
, where 
. These form a family 
of concentric spheres with radius 
. (See Figure 13.) Thus, as 
varies over any
sphere with center , the value of 
remains ﬁxed.
Functions of any number of variables can be considered. A function of n variables is
a rule that assigns a number 
to an -tuple 
of real
numbers. We denote by 
the set of all such n-tuples. For example, if a company uses 
different ingredients in making a food product, 
is the cost per unit of the 
ingredient,
and 
units of the 
ingredient are used, then the total cost 
of the ingredients is a func-
tion of the variables 
:
The function is a real-valued function whose domain is a subset of 
. Sometimes we
will use vector notation to write such functions more compactly: If 
,
we often write 
in place of 
. With this notation we can rewrite the
function deﬁned in Equation 3 as
where 
and 
denotes the dot product of the vectors c and x in 
.
In view of the one-to-one correspondence between points 
in 
and
their position vectors 
in 
, we have three ways of looking at a func-
tion f deﬁned on a subset of 
:
1. As a function of real variables 
2. As a function of a single point variable 
3. As a function of a single vector variable 
We will see that all three points of view are useful.

PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
It appears that as 
approaches (0, 0), the values of 
are approaching 1 whereas
the values of 
aren’t approaching any number. It turns out that these guesses based
on numerical evidence are correct, and we write
and
does not exist
In general, we use the notation
to indicate that the values of 
approach the number L as the point 
approaches
the point 
along any path that stays within the domain of
.
Deﬁnition We write
and we say that the limit of 
as 
approaches 
is 
if we can
make the values of 
as close to 
as we like by taking the point 
sufﬁ-
ciently close to the point 
, but not equal to 
.
Other notations for the limit in Deﬁnition 1 are
and
For functions of a single variable, when we let 
approach , there are only two pos-
sible directions of approach, from the left or from the right. We recall from Chapter 2 that
if 
, then 
does not exist.
For functions of two variables the situation is not as simple because we can let 
approach 
from an inﬁnite number of directions in any manner whatsoever (see
Figure 1) as long as 
stays within the domain of .
Deﬁnition 1 says that the distance between 
and L can be made arbitrarily small
by making the distance from 
to 
sufﬁciently small (but not 0). The deﬁnition
refers only to the distance between 
and 
. It does not refer to the direction of
approach. Therefore, if the limit exists, then 
must approach the same limit no mat-
ter how 
approaches 
. Thus, if we can ﬁnd two different paths of approach along
which the function 
has different limits, then it follows that 
does
not exist.
If

(See Figure 2.) Since

does not exist. (This conﬁrms the conjecture we made on the basis of numerical evidence
at the beginning of this section.)

If

Although we have obtained identical limits along the axes, that does not show that the

Therefore
(See Figure 3.) Since we have obtained different limits along different paths, the given
limit does not exist.

Thus 
has the same limiting value along every nonvertical line through the origin. But
that does not show that the given limit is 0, for if we now let 
along the
parabola 
, we have
so
Since different paths lead to different limiting values, the given limit does not exist.
Now let’s look at limits that do exist. Just as for functions of one variable, the calcula-
tion of limits for functions of two variables can be greatly simpliﬁed by the use of proper-
ties of limits. The Limit Laws listed in Section 2.3 can be extended to functions of two
variables: The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, the limit of a product is the product
of the limits, and so on. In particular, the following equations are true.
The Squeeze Theorem also holds.
Guessing and proving a limit
Find 
if it exists.
SOLUTION As in Example 3, we could show that the limit along any line through the
origin is 0. This doesn’t prove that the given limit is 0, but the limits along the parabolas
and 
also turn out to be 0, so we begin to suspect that the limit does exist
and is equal to 0. To prove it we look at the distance from 
to 0:
Notice that 
because 
. So
Thus
Now we use the Squeeze Theorem. Since
and
[by (2)]
we conclude that
Continuity
Recall that evaluating limits of continuous functions of a single variable is easy. It can be
accomplished by direct substitution because the deﬁning property of a continuous function
is 
. Continuous functions of two variables are also deﬁned by the direct
substitution property.

LIMITS AND CONTINUITY

Deﬁnition A function 
of two variables is called continuous at
if
We say 
is continuous on 
if 
is continuous at every point 
in .
The intuitive meaning of continuity is that if the point 
changes by a small amount,
then the value of 
changes by a small amount. This means that a surface that is the
graph of a continuous function has no hole or break.
Using the properties of limits, you can see that sums, differences, products, and quo-
tients of continuous functions are continuous on their domains. Let’s use this fact to give
examples of continuous functions.
A polynomial function of two variables (or polynomial, for short) is a sum of terms
of the form 
, where is a constant and 
and are nonnegative integers. A rational
function is a ratio of polynomials. For instance,
is a polynomial, whereas
is a rational function.
The limits in (2) show that the functions 
, 
, and 
are
continuous. Since any polynomial can be built up out of the simple functions , , and 
by multiplication and addition, it follows that all polynomials are continuous on 
.
Likewise, any rational function is continuous on its domain because it is a quotient of 
continuous functions.
Using continuity to ﬁnd a limit
Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Since 
is a polynomial, it is continuous
everywhere, so we can ﬁnd the limit by direct substitution:
Where is the function 
continuous?
SOLUTION The function 
is discontinuous at 
because it is not deﬁned there. 
Since 
is a rational function, it is continuous on its domain, which is the set
.
A function that is discontinuous at the origin
Let
Here is deﬁned at 
but is still discontinuous there because 
does not exist (see Example 1).

A function that is continuous everywhere
Let
We know 
is continuous for 
since it is equal to a rational function there.
Also, from Example 4, we have
Therefore 
is continuous at 
, and so it is continuous on 
.
Just as for functions of one variable, composition is another way of combining two con-
tinuous functions to get a third. In fact, it can be shown that if
is a continuous function
of two variables and 
is a continuous function of a single variable that is deﬁned on the
range of , then the composite function 
deﬁned by 
is also a
continuous function.
Where is the function 
continuous?
SOLUTION The function 
is a rational function and therefore continuous
except on the line 
. The function 
is continuous everywhere. So the
composite function
is continuous except where 
. The graph in Figure 7 shows the break in the graph of
above the -axis.
Everything that we have done in this section can be extended to functions of three or
more variables. The notation
means that the values of 
approach the number 
as the point 
approaches
the point 
along any path in the domain of . The function 
is continuous at
if
For instance, the function
is a rational function of three variables and so is continuous at every point in 
except
where 
. In other words, it is discontinuous on the sphere with center the
origin and radius 1.

On a hot day, extreme humidity makes us think the temperature is higher than it really 
is, whereas in very dry air we perceive the temperature to be lower than the thermom-
eter indicates. The National Weather Service has devised the heat index (also called the
temperature-humidity index, or humidex, in some countries) to describe the combined
effects of temperature and humidity. The heat index I is the perceived air temperature when
the actual temperature is T and the relative humidity is H. So I is a function of T and H and
we can write 
The following table of values of I is an excerpt from a table
compiled by the National Weather Service.
If we concentrate on the highlighted column of the table, which corresponds to a rela-
tive humidity of H  70%, we are considering the heat index as a function of the single
variable T for a ﬁxed value of H. Let’s write 
. Then 
describes how the
heat index I increases as the actual temperature T increases when the relative humidity is
70%. The derivative of t when 
is the rate of change of I with respect to T when

We can approximate 
using the values in Table 1 by taking 
and 
:
Averaging these values, we can say that the derivative 
is approximately 3.75. This
means that, when the actual temperature is 
and the relative humidity is 70%, the
apparent temperature (heat index) rises by about 
for every degree that the actual
temperature rises!
Now let’s look at the highlighted row in Table 1, which corresponds to a ﬁxed temper-
ature of 
. The numbers in this row are values of the function 
,
which describes how the heat index increases as the relative humidity H increases when
the actual temperature is 
. The derivative of this function when H  70% is the
rate of change of I with respect to H when H  70%:
By taking h  5 and 5, we approximate 
using the tabular values:
By averaging these values we get the estimate 
. This says that, when the tem-
perature is 
and the relative humidity is 70%, the heat index rises about 
for
every percent that the relative humidity rises.
In general, suppose is a function of two variables and and we let only vary while
keeping ﬁxed, say 
, where is a constant. Then we are really considering a func-
tion of a single variable , namely,

it the partial derivative of

PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
Similarly, the partial derivative of 
with respect to y at 
, denoted by 
, is
obtained by keeping 
ﬁxed 
and ﬁnding the ordinary derivative at 
of the func-
tion 
:
With this notation for partial derivatives, we can write the rates of change of the heat
index I with respect to the actual temperature T and relative humidity H when 
and H  70% as follows:
If we now let the point 
vary in Equations 2 and 3, 
and 
become functions of
two variables.
If 
is a function of two variables, its partial derivatives are the functions 
and 
deﬁned by
There are many alternative notations for partial derivatives. For instance, instead of 
we can write 
or 
(to indicate differentiation with respect to the ﬁrst variable) or
. But here 
can’t be interpreted as a ratio of differentials.
Notations for Partial Derivatives If

To compute partial derivatives, all we have to do is remember from Equation 1 that 
the partial derivative with respect to is just the ordinary derivative of the function of a
single variable that we get by keeping ﬁxed. Thus we have the following rule.

Interpretations of Partial Derivatives
To give a geometric interpretation of partial derivatives, we recall that the equation
represents a surface (the graph of ). If 
, then the point 
lies on . By ﬁxing 
, we are restricting our attention to the curve 
in which the ver-
tical plane 
intersects S. (In other words, 
is the trace of 
in the plane 
.)
Likewise, the vertical plane 
intersects in a curve 
. Both of the curves 
and 
pass through the point . (See Figure 1.)
Notice that the curve 
is the graph of the function 
, so the slope of its
tangent
at
is
. The curve
is the graph of the function
,
so the slope of its tangent 
at 
is 
.
Thus the partial derivatives 
and 
can be interpreted geometrically as the
slopes of the tangent lines at 
to the traces 
and 
of 
in the planes 
and 
.
As we have seen in the case of the heat index function, partial derivatives can also be
interpreted as rates of change. If 
, then 
represents the rate of change of 
with respect to 
when is ﬁxed. Similarly, 
represents the rate of change of with
respect to when is ﬁxed.

Alexis Clairaut
Alexis Clairaut was a child prodigy in 
mathematics: he read l’Hospital’s textbook 
on calculus when he was ten and presented a
paper on geometry to the French Academy of 
Sciences when he was 13. At the age of 18,
Clairaut published Recherches sur les courbes à
double courbure, which was the ﬁrst systematic
treatise on three-dimensional analytic geometry
and included the calculus of space curves.

For instance, the partial differential equation
is called Laplace’s equation after Pierre Laplace (1749–1827). Solutions of this equation
are called harmonic functions; they play a role in problems of heat conduction, ﬂuid ﬂow,
and electric potential.
Show that the function 
is a solution of Laplace’s equation. 
SOLUTION We ﬁrst compute the needed second-order partial derivatives:
So
Therefore satisﬁes Laplace’s equation.
The wave equation
describes the motion of a waveform, which could be an ocean wave, a sound wave, a light
wave, or a wave traveling along a vibrating string. For instance, if 
represents the dis-
placement of a vibrating violin string at time 
and at a distance 
from one end of the
string (as in Figure 8), then 
satisﬁes the wave equation. Here the constant depends
on the density of the string and on the tension in the string.
Verify that the function 
satisﬁes the wave equation.
SOLUTION
So satisﬁes the wave equation.

The Cobb-Douglas Production Function
In Example 2 in Section 11.1 we described the work of Cobb and Douglas in modeling the
total production P of an economic system as a function of the amount of labor L and the
capital investment K. Here we use partial derivatives to show how the particular form of
their model follows from certain assumptions they made about the economy.
If the production function is denoted by 
, then the partial derivative 
is the rate at which production changes with respect to the amount of labor. Economists
call it the marginal production with respect to labor or the marginal productivity of labor.
Likewise, the partial derivative 
is the rate of change of production with respect to
capital and is called the marginal productivity of capital. In these terms, the assumptions
made by Cobb and Douglas can be stated as follows.
(i) If either labor or capital vanishes, then so will production.
(ii) The marginal productivity of labor is proportional to the amount of production
per unit of labor.
(iii) The marginal productivity of capital is proportional to the amount of production
per unit of capital.
Because the production per unit of labor is 
, assumption (ii) says that
for some constant . If we keep K constant 
, then this partial differential equa-
tion becomes an ordinary differential equation:
If we solve this separable differential equation by the methods of Section 7.3 (see also
Exercise 77), we get
Notice that we have written the constant 
as a function of 
because it could depend on
the value of 
.
Similarly, assumption (iii) says that
and we can solve this differential equation to get

depends on the longitude , latitude , and time , so we can
write 
. Let’s measure time in hours from the
beginning of January.

, and 
?
(b) Honolulu has longitude 
and latitude 
. Sup-
pose that at 9:00 AM on January 1 the wind is blowing hot
air to the northeast, so the air to the west and south is warm
and the air to the north and east is cooler. Would you expect
, and 
to be posi-
tive or negative? Explain.

Notice from Equation 8 that if labor and capital are both increased by a factor m, then

CHAPTER 11
PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
One of the most important ideas in single-variable calculus is that as we zoom in toward 
a point on the graph of a differentiable function, the graph becomes indistinguishable 
from its tangent line and we can approximate the function by a linear function. (See Sec-
tion 3.9.) Here we develop similar ideas in three dimensions. As we zoom in toward a point
on a surface that is the graph of a differentiable function of two variables, the surface looks
more and more like a plane (its tangent plane) and we can approximate the function by a
linear function of two variables. We also extend the idea of a differential to functions of
two or more variables.
Tangent Planes
Suppose a surface 
has equation 
, where 
has continuous ﬁrst partial deriva-
tives, and let 
be a point on . As in the preceding section, let 
and 
be the
curves obtained by intersecting the vertical planes 
and 
with the surface .
Then the point 
lies on both 
and 
. Let 
and 
be the tangent lines to the curves 
and 
at the point . Then the tangent plane to the surface
at the point 
is deﬁned to
be the plane that contains both tangent lines 
and 
. (See Figure 1.)
We will see in Section 11.6 that if 
is any other curve that lies on the surface 
and
passes through , then its tangent line at 
also lies in the tangent plane. Therefore you can
think of the tangent plane to at 
as consisting of all possible tangent lines at 
to curves
that lie on 
and pass through . The tangent plane at 
is the plane that most closely
approximates the surface 
near the point .
We know from Equation 9.5.7 that any plane passing through the point 
has
an equation of the form
By dividing this equation by 
and letting 
and 
, we can write it in
the form
If Equation 1 represents the tangent plane at , then its intersection with the plane 
must be the tangent line 
. Setting 
in Equation 1 gives
where
and we recognize this as the equation (in point-slope form) of a line with slope 
lying in
the plane 
. But from Section 11.3 we know that the slope of the tangent 
is
. Therefore 
.
Similarly, putting 
in Equation 1, we get 
, which must repre-
sent the tangent line 
, so 
.
Suppose 
has continuous partial derivatives. An equation of the tangent
plane to the surface 
at the point 
is

Figure 2(a) shows the elliptic paraboloid and its tangent plane at (1, 1, 3) that we found
in Example 1. In parts (b) and (c) we zoom in toward the point (1, 1, 3) by restricting the
domain of the function 
. Notice that the more we zoom in, the ﬂatter
the graph appears and the more it resembles its tangent plane.
In Figure 3 we corroborate this impression by zooming in toward the point (1, 1) on a
contour map of the function 
. Notice that the more we zoom in, the
more the level curves look like equally spaced parallel lines, which is characteristic of a
plane.

CHAPTER 11
PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
Linear Approximations
In Example 1 we found that an equation of the tangent plane to the graph of the function
at the point (1, 1, 3) is 
. Therefore, in view of the
visual evidence in Figures 2 and 3, the linear function of two variables
is a good approximation to 
when 
is near (1, 1). The function L is called the
linearization of f at (1, 1) and the approximation
is called the linear approximation or tangent plane approximation of f at (1, 1).
For instance, at the point (1.1, 0.95) the linear approximation gives
which is quite close to the true value of 
. But if
we take a point farther away from (1, 1), such as (2, 3), we no longer get a good approxi-
mation. In fact, 
whereas 
.
In general, we know from (2) that an equation of the tangent plane to the graph of a
function f of two variables at the point 
is
The linear function whose graph is this tangent plane, namely
is called the linearization of f at 
and the approximation
is called the linear approximation or the tangent plane approximation of 
at
We have deﬁned tangent planes for surfaces 
, where 
has continuous ﬁrst
partial derivatives. What happens if 
and 
are not continuous? Figure 4 pictures such a
function; its equation is
You can verify (see Exercise 48) that its partial derivatives exist at the origin and, in fact,
and 
, but 
and 
are not continuous. The linear approximation
would be 
, but 
at all points on the line 
. So a function of two
variables can behave badly even though both of its partial derivatives exist. To rule out
such behavior, we formulate the idea of a differentiable function of two variables.
Recall that for a function of one variable, 
, if x changes from a to 
we

Now consider a function of two variables, 
, and suppose x changes from a to
and y changes from b to 
. Then the corresponding increment of is
Thus the increment 
represents the change in the value of 
when 
changes from
to 
. By analogy with (5) we deﬁne the differentiability of a func-
tion of two variables as follows.
Definition If 
, then

if 
can be
expressed in the form
where 
and 
as 
.
Deﬁnition 7 says that a differentiable function is one for which the linear approxima-
tion (4) is a good approximation when 
is near 
. In other words, the tangent plane
approximates the graph of f well near the point of tangency.
It’s sometimes hard to use Deﬁnition 7 directly to check the differentiability of a func-
tion, but the next theorem provides a convenient sufﬁcient condition for differentiability.
Theorem If the partial derivatives 
and 
exist near 
and are continuous
at 
, then

Show that

use it to approximate

Both

earization is

Estimating the heat index from tabular values
At the beginning of Section 11.3
we discussed the heat index (perceived temperature) as a function of the actual temper-
ature 
and the relative humidity 
and gave the following table of values from the
National Weather Service.
Find a linear approximation for the heat index 
when 
is near 
and 
is
near 70%. Use it to estimate the heat index when the temperature is 
and the relative
humidity is 72%.
SOLUTION We read from the table that 
. In Section 11.3 we used the tabu-
lar values to estimate that 
and 
. (See page 757–58.)
So the linear approximation is
In particular,
Therefore, when 
and H  72%, the heat index is

For a differentiable function of one variable, 
, we deﬁne the differential dx to be
an independent variable; that is, dx can be given the value of any real number. The differ-
ential of is then deﬁned as

Functions of Three or More Variables
Linear approximations, differentiability, and differentials can be deﬁned in a similar man-
ner for functions of more than two variables. A differentiable function is deﬁned by an
expression similar to the one in Deﬁnition 7. For such functions the linear approximation
is
and the linearization 
is the right side of this expression.
If

ent variables by
The dimensions of a rectangular box are measured to be 75 cm, 60 cm, 
and 40 cm, and each measurement is correct to within 
cm. Use differentials to esti-
mate the largest possible error when the volume of the box is calculated from these
measurements.
SOLUTION If the dimensions of the box are , , and , its volume is 
and so
We are given that 
, 
, and 
. To ﬁnd the largest error in
the volume, we therefore use 
, 
, and 
together with 
,
, and 
:
Thus an error of only 
cm in measuring each dimension could lead to an error of as
much as 1980 cm in the calculated volume! This may seem like a large error, but it’s
only about 1% of the volume of the box.

TANGENT PLANES AND LINEAR APPROXIMATIONS

Tangent Planes to Parametric Surfaces
Parametric surfaces were introduced in Section 10.5. We now ﬁnd the tangent plane to a par-
ametric surface 
traced out by a vector function
at a point 
with position vector 
. If we keep 
constant by putting 
, then
becomes a vector function of the single parameter 
and deﬁnes a grid curve 
lying on . (See Figure 9.) The tangent vector to 
at 
is obtained by taking the partial
derivative of with respect to :
Similarly, if we keep 
constant by putting 
, we get a grid curve 
given by
that lies on , and its tangent vector at 
is
If 
is not , then the surface is called smooth (it has no “corners”). For a smooth
surface, the tangent plane is the plane that contains the tangent vectors 
and
, and the
vector 
is a normal vector to the tangent plane.
Find the tangent plane to the surface with parametric equations 
,
, 
at the point 
.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst compute the tangent vectors:
Thus a normal vector to the tangent plane is

It’s not necessary to substitute the expressions for and in terms of . We simply
observe that when

The derivative in Example 1 can be interpreted as the rate of change of with respect

the Chain Rule gives
The pressure is decreasing at a rate of about 
kPas.
We now consider the situation where 
but each of and is a function of two
variables and : 
, 
. Then is indirectly a function of and and we
wish to ﬁnd 
and 
. Recall that in computing 
we hold ﬁxed and compute
the ordinary derivative of with respect to . Therefore we can apply Theorem 2 to obtain
A similar argument holds for 
and so we have proved the following version of the
Chain Rule.
The Chain Rule (Case 2) Suppose that 
is a differentiable function of
and , where 
and 
are differentiable functions of s and t.
Then
The Chain Rule with two independent variables
If

SOLUTION Applying Case 2 of the Chain Rule, we get
Case 2 of the Chain Rule contains three types of variables: 
and 
are independent
variables, 
and 
are called intermediate variables, and 
is the dependent variable.
Notice that Theorem 3 has one term for each intermediate variable and each of these terms
resembles the one-dimensional Chain Rule in Equation 1.
To remember the Chain Rule, it’s helpful to draw the tree diagram in Figure 2. We draw
branches from the dependent variable 
to the intermediate variables 
and 
to indicate
that 
is a function of 
and . Then we draw branches from 
and 
to the independent
variables 
and . On each branch we write the corresponding partial derivative. To ﬁnd

, we ﬁnd the product of the partial derivatives along each path from to and then
add these products:
Similarly, we ﬁnd 
by using the paths from to .
Now we consider the general situation in which a dependent variable is a function of
intermediate variables 
, 
, each of which is, in turn, a function of 
independent
variables , 
. Notice that there are 
terms, one for each intermediate variable. The
proof is similar to that of Case 1.
The Chain Rule (General Version) Suppose that is a differentiable function of
the variables 
, 
, 
and each 
is a differentiable function of the 
vari-
ables , , 
. Then 
is a function of ,

Although we haven’t written the derivatives on the branches, it’s understood that if a
branch leads from to , then the partial derivative for that branch is 
. With the aid
of the tree diagram, we can now write the required expressions:

But 
, so if

To derive this equation we assumed that

of . The Implicit Function Theorem, proved in advanced calculus, gives conditions
under which this assumption is valid: It states that if

equation 
deﬁnes as a function of near the point

SECTION 11.6
DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES AND THE GRADIENT VECTOR
789
The weather map in Figure 1 shows a contour map of the temperature function 
for
the states of California and Nevada at 3:00 PM on a day in October. The level curves, or
isothermals, join locations with the same temperature. The partial derivative 
at a loca-
tion such as Reno is the rate of change of temperature with respect to distance if we travel
east from Reno; 
is the rate of change of temperature if we travel north. But what if we
want to know the rate of change of temperature when we travel southeast (toward Las
Vegas), or in some other direction? In this section we introduce a type of derivative, called
a directional derivative, that enables us to ﬁnd the rate of change of a function of two or
more variables in any direction.
Directional Derivatives
Recall that if 
, then the partial derivatives 
and 
are deﬁned as
and represent the rates of change of in the - and -directions, that is, in the directions of
the unit vectors and .
Suppose that we now wish to ﬁnd the rate of change of at 
in the direction of
an arbitrary unit vector 
. (See Figure 2.) To do this we consider the surface 
with the equation 
(the graph of ) and we let 
. Then the point
lies on . The vertical plane that passes through 
in the direction of 
inter-
sects 
in a curve . (See Figure 3.) The slope of the tangent line 
to 
at the point 
is
the rate of change of in the direction of .

Estimating a directional derivative
Use the weather map in Figure 1 to esti-
mate the value of the directional derivative of the temperature function at Reno in the
southeasterly direction.
SOLUTION The unit vector directed toward the southeast is 
, but we won’t
need to use this expression. We start by drawing a line through Reno toward the south-
east (see Figure 4).
We approximate the directional derivative 
by the average rate of change of the
temperature between the points where this line intersects the isothermals 
and

at the point northwest of Reno is 
. The distance between these points looks to
be about 75 miles. So the rate of change of the temperature in the southeasterly direction
is
When we compute the directional derivative of a function deﬁned by a formula, we gen-
erally use the following theorem.

The Gradient Vector
Notice from Theorem 3 that the directional derivative of a differentiable function can be
written as the dot product of two vectors:
The ﬁrst vector in this dot product occurs not only in computing directional derivatives but
in many other contexts as well. So we give it a special name (the gradient of ) and a spe-
cial notation (grad
or 
, which is read “del ”).
Definition If 
is a function of two variables and , then the gradient of 
is
the vector function 
deﬁned by
Evaluating a gradient vector
If 
, then
and
With this notation for the gradient vector, we can rewrite the expression (7) for the
directional derivative of a differentiable function as
This expresses the directional derivative in the direction of as the scalar projection of the
gradient vector onto .

By Theorem 15 the temperature increases fastest in the direction of the gradient vector

Tangent Planes to Level Surfaces
Suppose 
is a surface with equation 
, that is, it is a level surface of a func-
tion 
of three variables, and let 
be a point on . Let 
be any curve that lies
on the surface and passes through the point . Recall from Section 10.1 that the curve 
is described by a continuous vector function 
. Let 
be the param-
eter value corresponding to 
; that is, 
. Since 
lies on , any point
must satisfy the equation of , that is,
If , , and are differentiable functions of and 
is also differentiable, then we can use
the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides of Equation 16 as follows:
But, since 
and 
, Equation 17 can be written in
terms of a dot product as
In particular, when 
we have 
, so
Equation 18 says that the gradient vector at , 
, is perpendicular to the 
tangent vector 
to any curve 
on 
that passes through . (See Figure 9.) If
, it is therefore natural to deﬁne the tangent plane to the level surface
at
as the plane that passes through 
and has normal vector
. Using the standard equation of a plane (Equation 9.5.7), we can write the
equation of this tangent plane as

DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES AND THE GRADIENT VECTOR

The normal line to 
at 
is the line passing through 
and perpendicular to the tan-
gent plane. The direction of the normal line is therefore given by the gradient vector
and so, by Equation 9.5.3, its symmetric equations are
In the special case in which the equation of a surface 
is of the form 
(that
is, 
is the graph of a function 
of two variables), we can rewrite the equation as
and regard 
as a level surface (with 
) of . Then
so Equation 19 becomes
which is equivalent to Equation 11.4.2. Thus our new, more general, deﬁnition of a tangent
plane is consistent with the deﬁnition that was given for the special case of Section 11.4.
Find the equations of the tangent plane and normal line at the point
to the ellipsoid
SOLUTION The ellipsoid is the level surface (with 
) of the function
Therefore we have
Then Equation 19 gives the equation of the tangent plane at 
as
which simpliﬁes to 
.
By Equation 20, symmetric equations of the normal line are

CHAPTER 11
PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
Signiﬁcance of the Gradient Vector
We now summarize the ways in which the gradient vector is signiﬁcant. We ﬁrst consider
a function 
of three variables and a point 
in its domain. On the one hand, we
know from Theorem 15 that the gradient vector 
gives the direction of fastest
increase of . On the other hand, we know that 
is orthogonal to the level sur-
face of 
through . (Refer to Figure 9.) These two properties are quite compatible intu-
itively because as we move away from 
on the level surface , the value of 
does not
change at all. So it seems reasonable that if we move in the perpendicular direction, we get
the maximum increase.
In like manner we consider a function 
of two variables and a point 
in its
domain. Again the gradient vector 
gives the direction of fastest increase of .
Also, by considerations similar to our discussion of tangent planes, it can be shown that
is perpendicular to the level curve 
that passes through . Again this
is intuitively plausible because the values of 
remain constant as we move along the
curve. (See Figure 11.)
If we consider a topographical map of a hill and let 
represent the height above
sea level at a point with coordinates 
, then a curve of steepest ascent can be drawn as
in Figure 12 by making it perpendicular to all of the contour lines. This phenomenon can
also be noticed in Figure 5 in Section 11.1, where Lonesome Creek follows a curve of
steepest descent.
Computer algebra systems have commands that plot sample gradient vectors. Each gra-
dient vector 
is plotted starting at the point 
. Figure 13 shows such a plot
(called a gradient vector ﬁeld) for the function 
superimposed on a con-
tour map of f. As expected, the gradient vectors point “uphill” and are perpendicular to the
level curves.

CHAPTER 11
PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
As we saw in Chapter 4, one of the main uses of ordinary derivatives is in ﬁnding maxi-
mum and minimum values (extreme values). In this section we see how to use partial
derivatives to locate maxima and minima of functions of two variables. In particular, in
Example 6 we will see how to maximize the volume of a box without a lid if we have a
ﬁxed amount of cardboard to work with.
Look at the hills and valleys in the graph of 
shown in Figure 1. There are two points
where 
has a local maximum, that is, where 
is larger than nearby values of
. The larger of these two values is the absolute maximum. Likewise, 
has two local
minima, where 
is smaller than nearby values. The smaller of these two values is the
absolute minimum.
Definition A function of two variables has a local maximum at
if
when 
is near 
. [This means that 
for
all points 
in some disk with center 
.] The number 
is called a
local maximum value. If 
when 
is near 
, then 
has a
local minimum at
and
is a local minimum value.
If the inequalities in Deﬁnition 1 hold for all points 
in the domain of , then has
an absolute maximum (or absolute minimum) at 
.
Fermat’s Theorem for Functions of Two Variables If has a local maximum or
minimum at 
and the ﬁrst-order partial derivatives of
exist there, then
and 
.
PROOF Let 
. If 
has a local maximum (or minimum) at 
, then has
a local maximum (or minimum) at , so 
by Fermat’s Theorem for functions of
one variable (see Theorem 4.2.4). But 
(see Equation 11.3.1) and so
. Similarly, by applying Fermat’s Theorem to the function 
,
we obtain 
.
If we put 
and 
in the equation of a tangent plane (Equation
11.4.2), we get 
. Thus the geometric interpretation of Theorem 2 is that if the graph
of 
has a tangent plane at a local maximum or minimum, then the tangent plane must be
horizontal.
A point 
is called a critical point (or stationary point) of 
if 
and
, or if one of these partial derivatives does not exist. Theorem 2 says that if 
has a local maximum or minimum at 
, then 
is a critical point of . However, as
in single-variable calculus, not all critical points give rise to maxima or minima. At a crit-
ical point, a function could have a local maximum or a local minimum or neither.
A function with an absolute minimum
Let 
. Then
These partial derivatives are equal to 0 when 
and 
, so the only critical point
is 
. By completing the square, we ﬁnd that

Since 
and 
, we have 
for all values of and .
Therefore 
is a local minimum, and in fact it is the absolute minimum 
of . This can be conﬁrmed geometrically from the graph of 
which is the elliptic
paraboloid with vertex 
shown in Figure 2.
A function with no extreme values
Find the extreme values of 
.
SOLUTION Since 
and 
, the only critical point is 
. Notice that 
for points on the -axis we have 
, so 
(if 
). However, for
points on the -axis we have 
, so 
(if 
). Thus every disk 
with center 
contains points where 
takes positive values as well as points where 
takes negative values. Therefore 
can’t be an extreme value for , so 
has
no extreme value.
Example 2 illustrates the fact that a function need not have a maximum or minimum
value at a critical point. Figure 3 shows how this is possible. The graph of 
is the hyper-
bolic paraboloid 
, which has a horizontal tangent plane (
) at the origin.
You can see that 
is a maximum in the direction of the -axis but a minimum
in the direction of the -axis. Near the origin the graph has the shape of a saddle and so
is called a saddle point of .
We need to be able to determine whether or not a function has an extreme value at a
critical point. The following test, which is proved in Appendix E, is analogous to the
Second Derivative Test for functions of one variable.
Second Derivatives Test Suppose the second partial derivatives of 
are contin-
uous on a disk with center 
, and suppose that 
and 
[that is, 
is a critical point of ]. Let
(a) If 
and 
, then 
is a local minimum.
(b) If 
and 
, then 
is a local maximum.
(c) If 
, then 
is not a local maximum or minimum.
Note 1: In case (c) the point 
is called a saddle point of 
and the graph of 
crosses its tangent plane at 
.
Note 2: If 
, the test gives no information: 
could have a local maximum or local
minimum at 
, or 
could be a saddle point of .
Note 3: To remember the formula for , it’s helpful to write it as a determinant:
Classifying critical points
Find the local maximum and minimum values
and saddle points of 
.

To solve these equations we substitute 
from the ﬁrst equation into the second
one. This gives
so there are three real roots: 
, , 
. The three critical points are 
, 
, 
and 
.
Next we calculate the second partial derivatives and 
:
Since 
, it follows from case (c) of the Second Derivatives Test that
the origin is a saddle point; that is, 
has no local maximum or minimum at 
. 
Since 
and 
, we see from case (a) of the test that

and
, so

In the ﬁrst case (

In the second case

and, putting this in Equation 5, we have 
. So we have to
solve the cubic equation
Using a graphing calculator or computer to graph the function
as in Figure 6, we see that Equation 7 has three real roots. By zooming in, we can ﬁnd
the roots to four decimal places:
(Alternatively, we could have used Newton’s method or a rootﬁnder to locate these
roots.) From Equation 6, the corresponding -values are given by
If

decimal places.

Absolute Maximum and Minimum Values
For a function 
of one variable, the Extreme Value Theorem says that if 
is continuous
on a closed interval 
, then 
has an absolute minimum value and an absolute maxi-
mum value. According to the Closed Interval Method in Section 4.2, we found these by
evaluating 
not only at the critical numbers but also at the endpoints and .
There is a similar situation for functions of two variables. Just as a closed interval con-
tains its endpoints, a closed set in 
is one that contains all its boundary points. [A bound-
ary point of D is a point 
such that every disk with center 
contains points in D
and also points not in D.] For instance, the disk
which consists of all points on and inside the circle 
, is a closed set because it
contains all of its boundary points (which are the points on the circle 
). But if
even one point on the boundary curve were omitted, the set would not be closed. (See 
Figure 11.)
A bounded set in 
is one that is contained within some disk. In other words, it is
ﬁnite in extent. Then, in terms of closed and bounded sets, we can state the following coun-
terpart of the Extreme Value Theorem in two dimensions.
Extreme Value Theorem for Functions of Two Variables If 
is continuous on a 
closed, bounded set 
in 
, then 
attains an absolute maximum value 
and an absolute minimum value 
at some points

To ﬁnd the extreme values guaranteed by Theorem 8, we note that, by Theorem 2, if 
has an extreme value at 
, then 
is either a critical point of 
or a boundary
point of . Thus we have the following extension of the Closed Interval Method.
To ﬁnd the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function 
on a closed, bounded set 
:
1. Find the values of 
at the critical points of 
in .
2. Find the extreme values of 
on the boundary of .
3. The largest of the values from steps 1 and 2 is the absolute maximum value; 
the smallest of these values is the absolute minimum value.
Testing for absolute extreme values on the boundary
Find the absolute maxi-
mum and minimum values of the function 
on the rectangle
.
SOLUTION Since 
is a polynomial, it is continuous on the closed, bounded rectangle , 
so Theorem 8 tells us there is both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum.
According to step 1 in (9), we ﬁrst ﬁnd the critical points. These occur when
so the only critical point is 
, and the value of 
there is 
.
In step 2 we look at the values of 
on the boundary of , which consists of the four
line segments 
, 
, 
, 
shown in Figure 12. On 
we have 
and
This is an increasing function of , so its minimum value is 
and its maxi-
mum value is 
. On 
we have 
and
This is a decreasing function of , so its maximum value is 
and its minimum
value is 
. On 
we have 
and
By the methods of Chapter 4, or simply by observing that 
, we see
that the minimum value of this function is 
and the maximum value is
. Finally, on 
we have 
and
with maximum value 
and minimum value 
. Thus, on the bound-
ary, the minimum value of 
is 0 and the maximum is 9.
In step 3 we compare these values with the value 
at the critical point and
conclude that the absolute maximum value of 
on 
is 
and the absolute
minimum value is 
. Figure 13 shows the graph of .f

APPLIED PROJECT
DESIGNING A DUMPSTER
811
APPLIED PROJECT
Designing a Dumpster
For this project we locate a rectangular trash Dumpster in order to study its shape and construc-
tion. We then attempt to determine the dimensions of a container of similar design that minimize 
construction cost.
1. First locate a trash Dumpster in your area. Carefully study and describe all details of its
construction, and determine its volume. Include a sketch of the container.
2. While maintaining the general shape and method of construction, determine the dimensions
such a container of the same volume should have in order to minimize the cost of construc-
tion. Use the following assumptions in your analysis:
■The sides, back, and front are to be made from 12-gauge (0.1046 inch thick) steel sheets,
which cost $0.70 per square foot (including any required cuts or bends).
■The base is to be made from a 10-gauge (0.1345 inch thick) steel sheet, which costs $0.90
per square foot.
■Lids cost approximately $50.00 each, regardless of dimensions.
■Welding costs approximately $0.18 per foot for material and labor combined.
Give justiﬁcation of any further assumptions or simpliﬁcations made of the details of 
construction.
3. Describe how any of your assumptions or simpliﬁcations may affect the ﬁnal result.
4. If you were hired as a consultant on this investigation, what would your conclusions be?
Would you recommend altering the design of the Dumpster? If so, describe the savings that
would result.

, and then plots these points. The
points don’t lie exactly on a straight line, so the scientist wants
to ﬁnd constants 
and so that the line 
“ﬁts” the
points as well as possible (see the ﬁgure).

Quadratic Approximations and Critical Points
The Taylor polynomial approximation to functions of one variable that we discussed in Chapter 8
can be extended to functions of two or more variables. Here we investigate quadratic approxima-
tions to functions of two variables and use them to give insight into the Second Derivatives Test
for classifying critical points.
In Section 11.4 we discussed the linearization of a function 
of two variables at a point 
:

SECTION 11.8
LAGRANGE MULITPLIERS
813
In Example 6 in Section 11.7 we maximized a volume function 
subject to the
constraint
, which expressed the side condition that the surface area
was 12 m . In this section we present Lagrange’s method for maximizing or minimizing 
a general function 
subject to a constraint (or side condition) of the form
.
It’s easier to explain the geometric basis of Lagrange’s method for functions of two
variables. So we start by trying to ﬁnd the extreme values of 
subject to a constraint
of the form 
. In other words, we seek the extreme values of 
when the
point 
is restricted to lie on the level curve 
. Figure 1 shows this curve
together with several level curves of . These have the equations
where
,
, , 
, 
. To maximize 
subject to 
is to ﬁnd the largest value of such
that the level curve 
intersects 
. It appears from Figure 1 that this
happens when these curves just touch each other, that is, when they have a common tan-
gent line. (Otherwise, the value of c could be increased further.) This means that the nor-
mal lines at the point 
where they touch are identical. So the gradient vectors are
parallel; that is, 
for some scalar .
This kind of argument also applies to the problem of ﬁnding the extreme values of
subject to the constraint 
. Thus the point 
is restricted to lie
on the level surface 
with equation 
. Instead of the level curves in Figure 1,
we consider the level surfaces 
and argue that if the maximum value of 
is 
, then the level surface 
is tangent to the level surface
and so the corresponding gradient vectors are parallel.
This intuitive argument can be made precise as follows. Suppose that a function 
has
an extreme value at a point 
on the surface 
and let 
be a curve with vector
equation 
that lies on 
and passes through . If 
is the parameter
value corresponding to the point , then 
. The composite function
represents the values that 
takes on the curve . Since 
has an
extreme value at 
, it follows that has an extreme value at , so 
. But
if 
is differentiable, we can use the Chain Rule to write
This shows that the gradient vector 
is orthogonal to the tangent vector 
to every such curve . But we already know from Section 11.6 that the gradient vector 
of , 
, is also orthogonal to 
for every such curve. (See Equation 11.6.18.)
This means that the gradient vectors 
and 
must be parallel.
Therefore, if 
, there is a number 
such that

Method of Lagrange Multipliers To ﬁnd the maximum and minimum values of
subject to the constraint 
[assuming that these extreme val-
ues exist and 
on the surface 
]:
(a) Find all values of , , , and 
such that
and
(b) Evaluate 
at all the points 
that result from step (a). The largest of
these values is the maximum value of ; the smallest is the minimum value 
of .
If we write the vector equation 
in terms of components, then the equations in
step (a) become
This is a system of four equations in the four unknowns , , , and , but it is not neces-
sary to ﬁnd explicit values for .
For functions of two variables the method of Lagrange multipliers is similar to the
method just described. To ﬁnd the extreme values of 
subject to the constraint
, we look for values of , , and 
such that
This amounts to solving three equations in three unknowns:
Our ﬁrst illustration of Lagrange’s method is to reconsider the problem given in
Example 6 in Section 11.7.
Maximizing a volume using Lagrange multipliers
A rectangular box 
without a lid is to be made from 12 m of cardboard. Find the maximum volume of 
such a box.
SOLUTION As in Example 6 in Section 11.7, we let , , and be the length, width, and
height, respectively, of the box in meters. Then we wish to maximize
subject to the constraint
Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we look for values of , , , and 
such that
and 
. This gives the equations

There are no general rules for solving systems of equations. Sometimes some ingenuity
is required. In the present example you might notice that if we multiply (2) by 
(3) by ,
and (4) by , then the left sides of these equations will be identical. Doing this, we have
We observe that 
because 
would imply 
from (2), (3), and
(4) and this would contradict (5). Therefore, from (6) and (7), we have
which gives

(since 
would give

. From (7) and
(8) we have
which gives 
and so (since 
) 
. If we now put 
in (5),
we get
Since , , and are all positive, we therefore have 
and so

. This
agrees with our answer in Section 11.7.
Find the extreme values of the function

we ﬁnd that
Therefore the maximum value of 
on the circle 
is 
and the
minimum value is 
. Checking with Figure 2, we see that these values look
reasonable.
Find the extreme values of 
on the disk 
.
SOLUTION According to the procedure in (11.7.9), we compare the values of 
at the crit-
ical points with values at the points on the boundary. Since 
and 
, the
only critical point is 
. We compare the value of 
at that point with the extreme val-
ues on the boundary from Example 2:
Therefore the maximum value of 
on the disk 
is 
and the
minimum value is 
.
Find the points on the sphere 
that are closest to and 
farthest from the point 
.
SOLUTION The distance from a point 
to the point 
is
but the algebra is simpler if we instead maximize and minimize the square of the 
distance:
The constraint is that the point 
lies on the sphere, that is,
According to the method of Lagrange multipliers, we solve 
, 
. This gives
The simplest way to solve these equations is to solve for , , and in terms of 
from
(12), (13), and (14), and then substitute these values into (15). From (12) we have

Therefore, from (15), we have

These values of

It’s easy to see that 
has a smaller value at the ﬁrst of these points, so the closest point
is 
and the farthest is 
.
Two Constraints
Suppose now that we want to ﬁnd the maximum and minimum values of a function
subject to two constraints (side conditions) of the form 
and
. Geometrically, this means that we are looking for the extreme values of 
when 
is restricted to lie on the curve of intersection 
of the level surfaces
and 
. (See Figure 5.) Suppose 
has such an extreme value at a
point 
. We know from the beginning of this section that 
is orthogonal to 
at . But we also know that 
is orthogonal to 
and 
is orthogonal to
, so 
and 
are both orthogonal to . This means that the gradient vector
is in the plane determined by 
and 
. (We assume
that these gradient vectors are not zero and not parallel.) So there are numbers 
and 
(called Lagrange multipliers) such that
In this case Lagrange’s method is to look for extreme values by solving ﬁve equations in
the ﬁve unknowns , , , , and . These equations are obtained by writing Equation 16
in terms of its components and using the constraint equations:

APPLIED PROJECT
Rocket Science
Many rockets, such as the Pegasus XL currently used to launch satellites and the Saturn V that ﬁrst
put men on the moon, are designed to use three stages in their ascent into space. A large ﬁrst stage
initially propels the rocket until its fuel is consumed, at which point the stage is jettisoned to
reduce the mass of the rocket. The smaller second and third stages function similarly in order to
place the rocket’s payload into orbit about the earth. (With this design, at least two stages are
required in order to reach the necessary velocities, and using three stages has proven to be a good
compromise between cost and performance.) Our goal here is to determine the individual masses
of the three stages, which are to be designed in such a way as to minimize the total mass of the
rocket while enabling it to reach a desired velocity.
For a single-stage rocket consuming fuel at a constant rate, the change in velocity resulting
from the acceleration of the rocket vehicle has been modeled by
where 
is the mass of the rocket engine including initial fuel, 
is the mass of the payload, 
is a structural factor determined by the design of the rocket (speciﬁcally, it is the ratio of the
mass of the rocket vehicle without fuel to the total mass of the rocket with payload), and is the
(constant) speed of exhaust relative to the rocket.
Now consider a rocket with three stages and a payload of mass . Assume that outside forces
are negligible and that and 
remain constant for each stage. If 
is the mass of the 
stage, 
we can initially consider the rocket engine to have mass 
and its payload to have mass
; the second and third stages can be handled similarly.
1. Show that the velocity attained after all three stages have been jettisoned is given by
2. We wish to minimize the total mass 
of the rocket engine subject 
to the constraint that the desired velocity 
from Problem 1 is attained. The method of

APPLIED PROJECT
Hydro-Turbine Optimization
The Katahdin Paper Company in Millinocket, Maine, operates a hydroelectric generating station
on the Penobscot River. Water is piped from a dam to the power station. The rate at which the
water ﬂows through the pipe varies, depending on external conditions.
The power station has three different hydroelectric turbines, each with a known (and unique)
power function that gives the amount of electric power generated as a function of the water ﬂow
arriving at the turbine. The incoming water can be apportioned in different volumes to each
turbine, so the goal is to determine how to distribute water among the turbines to give the maxi-
mum total energy production for any rate of ﬂow.
Using experimental evidence and Bernoulli’s equation, the following quadratic models were
determined for the power output of each turbine, along with the allowable ﬂows of operation:

where
1. If all three turbines are being used, we wish to determine the ﬂow 
to each turbine that will
give the maximum total energy production. Our limitations are that the ﬂows must sum to 
the total incoming ﬂow and the given domain restrictions must be observed. Consequently,
use Lagrange multipliers to ﬁnd the values for the individual ﬂows (as functions of 
) that
maximize the total energy production 
subject to the constraints
and the domain restrictions on each 
.
2. For which values of 
is your result valid?
3. For an incoming ﬂow of 
, determine the distribution to the turbines and verify 
(by trying some nearby distributions) that your result is indeed a maximum.
4. Until now we have assumed that all three turbines are operating; is it possible in some situa-
tions that more power could be produced by using only one turbine? Make a graph of the
three power functions and use it to help decide if an incoming ﬂow of 
should be
distributed to all three turbines or routed to just one. (If you determine that only one turbine
should be used, which one would it be?) What if the ﬂow is only 
?
5. Perhaps for some ﬂow levels it would be advantageous to use two turbines. If the incoming
ﬂow is 
, which two turbines would you recommend using? Use Lagrange multi-
pliers to determine how the ﬂow should be distributed between the two turbines to maxi-
mize the energy produced. For this ﬂow, is using two turbines more efﬁcient than using all
three?

, what would you recommend to the company?

Multiple Integrals
In this chapter we extend the idea of a deﬁnite integral to double and triple 
integrals of functions of two or three variables. These ideas are then used to
compute volumes, surface areas, masses, and centroids of more general 
regions than we were able to consider in Chapter 6. We also use double 
integrals to calculate probabilities when two random variables are involved.

thomasmayerarchive.com

In much the same way that our attempt to solve the area problem led to the deﬁnition of a
deﬁnite integral, we now seek to ﬁnd the volume of a solid and in the process we arrive at
the deﬁnition of a double integral.
Review of the Definite Integral
First let’s recall the basic facts concerning deﬁnite integrals of functions of a single vari-
able. If 
is deﬁned for 
, we start by dividing the interval 
into n sub-
intervals 
of equal width 
and we choose sample points 
in these
subintervals. Then we form the Riemann sum
and take the limit of such sums as 
to obtain the deﬁnite integral of 
from 
to :
In the special case where 
, the Riemann sum can be interpreted as the sum of the
areas of the approximating rectangles in Figure 1, and 
represents the area under
the curve 
from to .
Volumes and Double Integrals
In a similar manner we consider a function 
of two variables deﬁned on a closed rectangle
and we ﬁrst suppose that
. The graph of f is a surface with equation
.
Let S be the solid that lies above R and under the graph of f, that is,
(See Figure 2.) Our goal is to ﬁnd the volume of S.
The ﬁrst step is to divide the rectangle 
into subrectangles. We accomplish this by
dividing the interval 
into m subintervals 
of equal width 
and dividing 
into n subintervals 
of equal width 
. By draw-
ing lines parallel to the coordinate axes through the endpoints of these subintervals, as in

Figure 3, we form the subrectangles
each with area 
.
If we choose a sample point
in each 
, then we can approximate the part of
S that lies above each 
by a thin rectangular box (or “column”) with base 
and height
as shown in Figure 4. (Compare with Figure 1.) The volume of this box is the
height of the box times the area of the base rectangle:
If we follow this procedure for all the rectangles and add the volumes of the corresponding
boxes, we get an approximation to the total volume of S:
(See Figure 5.) This double sum means that for each subrectangle we evaluate at the cho-
sen point and multiply by the area of the subrectangle, and then we add the results.

CHAPTER 12
MULTIPLE INTEGRALS
Our intuition tells us that the approximation given in (3) becomes better as 
and 
become larger and so we would expect that
We use the expression in Equation 4 to deﬁne the volume of the solid that lies under the
graph of and above the rectangle . (It can be shown that this deﬁnition is consistent with
our formula for volume in Section 6.2.)
Limits of the type that appear in Equation 4 occur frequently, not just in ﬁnding vol-
umes but in a variety of other situations as well—as we will see in Section 12.5—even
when 
is not a positive function. So we make the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition The double integral of over the rectangle 
is
if this limit exists.
A function 
is called integrable if the limit in Deﬁnition 5 exists. It is shown in courses
on advanced calculus that all continuous functions are integrable. In fact, the double inte-
gral of 
exists provided that 
is “not too discontinuous.” In particular, if 
is bounded
[that is, there is a constant 
such that 
for all 
in ], and 
is con-
tinuous there, except on a ﬁnite number of smooth curves, then 
is integrable over .
The sample point 
can be chosen to be any point in the subrectangle 
but if
we choose it to be the upper right-hand corner of 
[namely 
, see Figure 3], then
the expression for the double integral looks simpler:
By comparing Deﬁnitions 4 and 5, we see that a volume can be written as a double
integral of a positive function:
If 
, then the volume 
of the solid that lies above the rectangle 
and
below the surface 
is
The sum in Deﬁnition 5,
is called a double Riemann sum and is used as an approximation to the value of the 
double integral. [Notice how similar it is to the Riemann sum in (1) for a function of a 
single variable.] If 
happens to be a positive function, then the double Riemann sum 
represents the sum of volumes of columns, as in Figure 5, and is an approximation to the
volume under the graph of and above the rectangle .

Using a double Riemann sum to estimate a volume
Estimate the volume 
of the solid that lies above the square 
and below the elliptic parabo-
loid 
. Divide 
into four equal squares and choose the sample point
to be the upper right corner of each square 
. Sketch the solid and the approximating
rectangular boxes.
SOLUTION The squares are shown in Figure 6. The paraboloid is the graph of
and the area of each square is 
. Approximating the
volume by the Riemann sum with 
, we have
This is the volume of the approximating rectangular boxes shown in Figure 7.
We get better approximations to the volume in Example 1 if we increase the number of
squares. Figure 8 shows how the columns start to look more like the actual solid and the
corresponding approximations become more accurate when we use 16, 64, and 256
squares. In the next section we will be able to show that the exact volume is 48.
Evaluating a double integral by interpreting it geometrically
If

SOLUTION It would be very difﬁcult to evaluate this integral directly from Deﬁnition 5
but, because 
, we can compute the integral by interpreting it as a volume.
If

volume of the solid S that lies below the circular cylinder 
and above the 
rectangle R. (See Figure 9.) The volume of S is the area of a semicircle with radius 1
times the length of the cylinder. Thus

The Midpoint Rule
The methods that we used for approximating single integrals (the Midpoint Rule, the
Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson’s Rule) all have counterparts for double integrals. Here we
consider only the Midpoint Rule for double integrals. This means that we use a double Rie-
mann sum to approximate the double integral, where the sample point 
in 
is
chosen to be the center 
of 
. In other words, 
is the midpoint of 
and 
is the midpoint of

SOLUTION In using the Midpoint Rule with 
, we evaluate 
at
the centers of the four subrectangles shown in Figure 10. So

Thus we have
Note: In the next section we will develop an efﬁcient method for computing double
integrals and then we will see that the exact value of the double integral in Example 3 is
. (Remember that the interpretation of a double integral as a volume is valid only when
the integrand 
is a positive function. The integrand in Example 3 is not a positive func-
tion, so its integral is not a volume. In Examples 2 and 3 in Section 12.2 we will discuss
how to interpret integrals of functions that are not always positive in terms of volumes.) If
we keep dividing each subrectangle in Figure 10 into four smaller ones with similar shape,
we get the Midpoint Rule approximations displayed in the chart in the margin. Notice how
these approximations approach the exact value of the double integral, 
.

In a similar fashion we deﬁne the average value of a function

describes a mountainous region and you chop off the
tops of the mountains at height

Using the Midpoint Rule to estimate average snowfall
The contour map in Figure 12 shows the snowfall, in inches, that fell on the state of
Colorado on December 20 and 21, 2006. (The state is in the shape of a rectangle that
measures 388 mi west to east and 276 mi south to north.) Use the contour map to esti-
mate the average snowfall for the entire state of Colorado on those days.
SOLUTION Let’s place the origin at the southwest corner of the state. Then 
, and 
is the snowfall, in inches, at a location x miles to the east and 
y miles to the north of the origin. If R is the rectangle that represents Colorado, then the
average snowfall for the state on December 20–21 was
where 
. To estimate the value of this double integral, let’s use the Mid-
point Rule with

Recall that it is usually difﬁcult to evaluate single integrals directly from the deﬁnition of
an integral, but the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provides a much easier method. The
evaluation of double integrals from ﬁrst principles is even more difﬁcult, but in this sec- 
tion we see how to express a double integral as an iterated integral, which can then be eval-
uated by calculating two single integrals.
Suppose that 
is a function of two variables that is integrable on the rectangle
. We use the notation 
to mean that 
is held ﬁxed and
is integrated with respect to 
from 
to

tial integration with respect to . (Notice its similarity to partial differentiation.) Now

The integral on the right side of Equation 1 is called an iterated integral. Usually the
brackets are omitted. Thus
means that we ﬁrst integrate with respect to from to 
and then with respect to from

Similarly, the iterated integral
means that we ﬁrst integrate with respect to

ﬁxed) from

CHAPTER 12
MULTIPLE INTEGRALS
Notice that in Example 1 we obtained the same answer whether we integrated with
respect to or ﬁrst. In general, it turns out (see Theorem 4) that the two iterated integrals
in Equations 2 and 3 are always equal; that is, the order of integration does not matter.
(This is similar to Clairaut’s Theorem on the equality of the mixed partial derivatives.)
The following theorem gives a practical method for evaluating a double integral by
expressing it as an iterated integral (in either order).
Fubini’s Theorem If 
is continuous on the rectangle 
, 
, then
More generally, this is true if we assume that 
is bounded on , 
is discontin-
uous only on a ﬁnite number of smooth curves, and the iterated integrals exist.
The proof of Fubini’s Theorem is too difﬁcult to include in this book, but we can at least
give an intuitive indication of why it is true for the case where 
. Recall that if
is positive, then we can interpret the double integral 
as the volume 
of
the solid 
that lies above 
and under the surface 
. But we have another for-
mula that we used for volume in Chapter 6, namely,
where 
is the area of a cross-section of 
in the plane through 
perpendicular to the 
-axis. From Figure 1 you can see that 
is the area under the curve 
whose equation
is 
, where is held constant and 
. Therefore
and we have
A similar argument, using cross-sections perpendicular to the -axis as in Figure 2, shows
that
Using Fubini’s Theorem to calculate a double integral

Theorem 4 is named after the Italian mathema-

very general version of this theorem in 1907. But
the version for continuous functions was known
to the French mathematician Augustin-Louis
Cauchy almost a century earlier.

Notice the negative answer in Example 2; 
nothing is wrong with that. The function 
is 
not a positive function, so its integral doesn’t
represent a volume. From Figure 3 we see that 
is always negative on , so the value of the
integral is the negative of the volume that lies
above the graph of 
and below

Using a double integral to compute a volume
Find the volume of the solid
that is bounded by the elliptic paraboloid 
, the planes 
and
, and the three coordinate planes.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst observe that is the solid that lies under the surface 
and above the square 
. (See Figure 5.) This solid was considered in
Example 1 in Section 12.1, but we are now in a position to evaluate the double integral
using Fubini’s Theorem. Therefore
In the special case where 
can be factored as the product of a function of only
and a function of 
only, the double integral of 
can be written in a particularly simple
form. To be speciﬁc, suppose that 
and 
. Then 
Fubini’s Theorem gives
In the inner integral, is a constant, so 
is a constant and we can write
since 
is a constant. Therefore, in this case, the double integral of 
can be writ-
ten as the product of two single integrals:

In Example 2, Solutions 1 and 2 are equally
straightforward, but in Example 3 the ﬁrst solu-
tion is much easier than the second one. There-
fore, when we evaluate double integrals, it’s
wise to choose the order of integration that gives
simpler integrals.

For single integrals, the region over which we integrate is always an interval. But for 
double integrals, we want to be able to integrate a function 
not just over rectangles but
also over regions 
of more general shape, such as the one illustrated in Figure 1. We sup-
pose that 
is a bounded region, which means that 
can be enclosed in a rectangular
region 
as in Figure 2. Then we deﬁne a new function 
with domain 
by
If F is integrable over R, then we deﬁne the double integral of
over D by
Deﬁnition 2 makes sense because R is a rectangle and so 
has been previ-
ously deﬁned in Section 12.1. The procedure that we have used is reasonable because the
values of 
are 0 when 
lies outside 
and so they contribute nothing to the inte-
gral. This means that it doesn’t matter what rectangle 
we use as long as it contains .
In the case where 
, we can still interpret 
as the volume of the
solid that lies above 
and under the surface 
(the graph of ). You can see that
this is reasonable by comparing the graphs of 
and 
in Figures 3 and 4 and remember-
ing that

Figure 4 also shows that

of 
Nonetheless, if 
is continuous on 
and the boundary curve of 
is “well behaved” 
(in a sense outside the scope of this book), then it can be shown that 
exists
and therefore 
exists. In particular, this is the case for the following two types
of regions.
A plane region 
is said to be of type I if it lies between the graphs of two continuous
functions of , that is,
where 
and 
are continuous on 
. Some examples of type I regions are shown in
Figure 5.
In order to evaluate 
when 
is a region of type I, we choose a rectangle
that contains , as in Figure 6, and we let 
be the function given by
Equation 1; that is, 
agrees with 
on 
and 
is outside . Then, by Fubini’s Theorem,
Observe that 
if 
or 
because

Therefore
because 
when 
. Thus we have the following formula
that enables us to evaluate the double integral as an iterated integral.
If 
is continuous on a type I region D such that
then
The integral on the right side of (3) is an iterated integral that is similar to the ones we

We also consider plane regions of type II, which can be expressed as 
where 
and 
are continuous. Two such regions are illustrated in Figure 7.
Using the same methods that were used in establishing (3), we can show that
where D is a type II region given by Equation 4.
Calculating a double integral over a type I region
Evaluate 
,
where 
is the region bounded by the parabolas 
and 
.
SOLUTION The parabolas intersect when 
, that is, 
, so 
. We
note that the region , sketched in Figure 8, is a type I region but not a type II region
and we can write
Since the lower boundary is 
and the upper boundary is 
, Equation 3
gives
Note: When we set up a double integral as in Example 1, it is essential to draw a 
diagram. Often it is helpful to draw a vertical arrow as in Figure 8. Then the limits of 
integration for the inner integral can be read from the diagram as follows: The arrow 
starts at the lower boundary 
, which gives the lower limit in the integral, and 
the arrow ends at the upper boundary 
, which gives the upper limit of integration.
For a type II region the arrow is drawn horizontally from the left boundary to the right
boundary.

SOLUTION The region

the description of

Then (5) gives
If we had expressed 
as a type I region using Figure 12(a), then we would have
obtained
but this would have involved more work than the other method.
Find the volume of the tetrahedron bounded by the planes 
,
, 
, and 
.
SOLUTION In a question such as this, it’s wise to draw two diagrams: one of the three-
dimensional solid and another of the plane region 
over which it lies. Figure 13 shows
the tetrahedron 
bounded by the coordinate planes 
, 
, the vertical plane
, and the plane 
. Since the plane 
intersects the 
-plane (whose equation is 
) in the line 
, we see that 
lies above the
triangular region 
in the 
-plane bounded by the lines 
, 
, and 
.
(See Figure 14.)
The plane 
can be written as 
, so the required volume
lies under the graph of the function 
and above

Reversing the order of integration
Evaluate the iterated integral 
.
SOLUTION If we try to evaluate the integral as it stands, we are faced with the task of ﬁrst
evaluating 
. But it’s impossible to do so in ﬁnite terms since 
is
not an elementary function. (See the end of Section 5.8.) So we must change the order 
of integration. This is accomplished by ﬁrst expressing the given iterated integral as a
double integral. Using (3) backward, we have
where
We sketch this region 
in Figure 15. Then from Figure 16 we see that an alternative
description of 
is
This enables us to use (5) to express the double integral as an iterated integral in the
reverse order:
Properties of Double Integrals
We assume that all of the following integrals exist. The ﬁrst three properties of double
integrals over a region 
follow immediately from Deﬁnition 2 in this section and Proper-
ties 7, 8, and 9 in Section 12.1.
If

The next property of double integrals is similar to the property of single integrals given
by the equation

MULTIPLE INTEGRALS
Property 9 can be used to evaluate double integrals over regions 
that are neither type I
nor type II but can be expressed as a union of regions of type I or type II. Figure 18 illus-
trates this procedure. (See Exercises 53 and 54.)
The next property of integrals says that if we integrate the constant function 
over a region , we get the area of 
:
Figure 19 illustrates why Equation 10 is true: A solid cylinder whose base is 
and whose
height is 1 has volume 
, but we know that we can also write its volume
as 
.
Finally, we can combine Properties 7, 8, and 10 to prove the following property. (See
Exercise 59.)
If 
for all 
in , then
Use Property 11 to estimate the integral 
, where 
is the disk
with center the origin and radius 2.

DOUBLE INTEGRALS IN POLAR COORDINATES
853
Suppose that we want to evaluate a double integral 
, where 
is one of the
regions shown in Figure 1. In either case the description of 
in terms of rectangular coor-
dinates is rather complicated, but 
is easily described using polar coordinates.
Recall from Figure 2 that the polar coordinates 
of a point are related to the rect-
angular coordinates 
by the equations
The regions in Figure 1 are special cases of a polar rectangle
which is shown in Figure 3. In order to compute the double integral 
, where
is a polar rectangle, we divide the interval 
into 
subintervals 
of equal
width 
and we divide the interval 
into 
subintervals 
of
equal width 
. Then the circles 
and the rays 
divide the polar
rectangle R into the small polar rectangles 
shown in Figure 4.

We compute the area of

central angle

Although we have deﬁned the double integral 
in terms of ordinary rect-
angles, it can be shown that, for continuous functions , we always obtain the same 
answer using polar rectangles. The rectangular coordinates of the center of 
are
, so a typical Riemann sum is
If we write 
, then the Riemann sum in Equation 1 can be writ-
ten as
which is a Riemann sum for the double integral
Therefore we have

Finding a volume using polar coordinates
Find the volume of the solid
bounded by the plane 
and the paraboloid 
.
SOLUTION If we put 
in the equation of the paraboloid, we get 
. This
means that the plane intersects the paraboloid in the circle 
, so the solid 
lies under the paraboloid and above the circular disk 
given by 
[see Fig-
ures 6 and 1(a)]. In polar coordinates 
is given by 
, 
. Since
, the volume is
If we had used rectangular coordinates instead of polar coordinates, then we would have
obtained
which is not easy to evaluate because it involves ﬁnding 
.
What we have done so far can be extended to the more complicated type of region
shown in Figure 7. It’s similar to the type II rectangular regions considered in Section 12.3.

We have already seen one application of double integrals: computing volumes. Another
geometric application is ﬁnding areas of surfaces and this will be done in the next section.
In this section we explore physical applications such as computing mass, electric charge,
center of mass, and moment of inertia. We will see that these physical ideas are also impor-
tant when applied to probability density functions of two random variables.
Density and Mass
In Chapter 6 we were able to use single integrals to compute moments and the center of
mass of a thin plate or lamina with constant density. But now, equipped with the double
integral, we can consider a lamina with variable density. Suppose the lamina occupies a
region 
of the 
-plane and its density (in units of mass per unit area) at a point 
in
is given by 
, where is a continuous function on . This means that
where 
and 
are the mass and area of a small rectangle that contains 
and the
limit is taken as the dimensions of the rectangle approach 0. (See Figure 1.)

SECTION 12.5
APPLICATIONS OF DOUBLE INTEGRALS
859
To ﬁnd the total mass 
of the lamina we divide a rectangle 
containing 
into sub-
rectangles 
of the same size (as in Figure 2) and consider 
to be 0 outside . If
we choose a point 
in 
, then the mass of the part of the lamina that occupies 
is approximately 
, where 
is the area of 
. If we add all such masses, we
get an approximation to the total mass:
If we now increase the number of subrectangles, we obtain the total mass 
of the lamina
as the limiting value of the approximations:
Physicists also consider other types of density that can be treated in the same manner.
For example, if an electric charge is distributed over a region 
and the charge density (in
units of charge per unit area) is given by 
at a point 
in , then the total charge
is given by
Finding charge by integrating charge density
Charge is distributed over the
triangular region 
in Figure 3 so that the charge density at 
is 
, mea-
sured in coulombs per square meter (
). Find the total charge.
SOLUTION From Equation 2 and Figure 3 we have
Thus the total charge is
C.
Moments and Centers of Mass
In Section 6.6 we found the center of mass of a lamina with constant density; here we con-
sider a lamina with variable density. Suppose the lamina occupies a region 
and has den-
sity function 
. Recall from Chapter 6 that we deﬁned the moment of a particle about
an axis as the product of its mass and its directed distance from the axis. We divide 
into
small rectangles as in Figure 2. Then the mass of 
is approximately 
, so we
can approximate the moment of 
with respect to the -axis by
If we now add these quantities and take the limit as the number of subrectangles becomes

cal signiﬁcance is that the lamina behaves as if its entire mass is concentrated at its center

The center of mass is at the point 
.
The density at any point on a semicircular lamina is proportional to the
distance from the center of the circle. Find the center of mass of the lamina.
SOLUTION Let’s place the lamina as the upper half of the circle 
. (See Fig-
ure 6.) Then the distance from a point 
to the center of the circle (the origin) is
. Therefore the density function is
where 
is some constant. Both the density function and the shape of the lamina suggest
that we convert to polar coordinates. Then 
and the region 
is given by
, 
. Thus the mass of the lamina is
Both the lamina and the density function are symmetric with respect to the -axis, so the
center of mass must lie on the -axis, that is, 
. The -coordinate is given by
Therefore the center of mass is located at the point 
.
Moment of Inertia
The moment of inertia (also called the second moment) of a particle of mass 
about an
axis is deﬁned to be 
, where is the distance from the particle to the axis. We extend
this concept to a lamina with density function 
and occupying a region 
by pro-
ceeding as we did for ordinary moments. We divide 
into small rectangles, approximate
the moment of inertia of each subrectangle about the -axis, and take the limit of the sum

as the number of subrectangles becomes large. The result is the moment of inertia of the
lamina about the x-axis:
Similarly, the moment of inertia about the y-axis is
It is also of interest to consider the moment of inertia about the origin, also called the
polar moment of inertia:

Instead of computing

directly, we use the facts that

(from the symmetry of the problem). Thus
In Example 4 notice that the mass of the disk is
so the moment of inertia of the disk about the origin (like a wheel about its axle) can be
written as
Thus if we increase the mass or the radius of the disk, we thereby increase the moment of
inertia. In general, the moment of inertia plays much the same role in rotational motion

that mass plays in linear motion. The moment of inertia of a wheel is what makes it difﬁ-
cult to start or stop the rotation of the wheel, just as the mass of a car is what makes it dif-
ﬁcult to start or stop the motion of the car.
Probability
In Section 6.8 we considered the probability density function
of a continuous random vari-
able X. This means that 
for all x, 
, and the probability that X lies
between a and b is found by integrating f from a to b:
Now we consider a pair of continuous random variables X and Y, such as the lifetimes
of two components of a machine or the height and weight of an adult female chosen at ran-
dom. The joint density function of X and Y is a function f of two variables such that the
probability that 
lies in a region D is
In particular, if the region is a rectangle, the probability that X lies between a and b and 
Y lies between c and d is
(See Figure 7.)
Because probabilities aren’t negative and are measured on a scale from 0 to 1, the joint
density function has the following properties:
As in Exercise 36 in Section 12.4, the double integral over 
is an improper integral
deﬁned as the limit of double integrals over expanding circles or squares, and we can write

If the joint density function for X and Y is given by
ﬁnd the value of the constant C. Then ﬁnd 
.
SOLUTION We ﬁnd the value of C by ensuring that the double integral of f is equal 
to 1. Because 
outside the rectangle 
, we have
Therefore 
and so 
.
Now we can compute the probability that X is at most 7 and Y is at least 2:
Suppose X is a random variable with probability density function 
and Y is a ran-
dom variable with density function 
. Then X and Y are called independent random
variables if their joint density function is the product of their individual density functions:
In Section 6.8 we modeled waiting times by using exponential density functions
where 
is the mean waiting time. In the next example we consider a situation with two
independent waiting times.
Waiting times in a theater
The manager of a movie theater determines that
the average time moviegoers wait in line to buy a ticket for this week’s ﬁlm is 10 min-
utes and the average time they wait to buy popcorn is 5 minutes. Assuming that the wait-
ing times are independent, ﬁnd the probability that a moviegoer waits a total of less than
20 minutes before taking his or her seat.
SOLUTION Assuming that both the waiting time X for the ticket purchase and the waiting
time Y in the refreshment line are modeled by exponential probability density functions,
we can write the individual density functions as

We are asked for the probability that

This means that about 75% of the moviegoers wait less than 20 minutes before taking
their seats.
Expected Values
Recall from Section 6.8 that if X is a random variable with probability density function
then its mean is
Now if X and Y are random variables with joint density function f, we deﬁne the X-mean
and Y-mean, also called the expected values of X and Y, to be
Notice how closely the expressions for 
and 
in (9) resemble the moments 
and 
of a lamina with density function 
in Equations 3 and 4. In fact, we can think of proba-
bility as being like continuously distributed mass. We calculate probability the way we cal-
culate mass—by integrating a density function. And because the total “probability mass”
is 1, the expressions for and in (5) show that we can think of the expected values of X
and Y, 
and 
, as the coordinates of the “center of mass” of the probability distribution.
In the next example we deal with normal distributions. As in Section 6.8, a single ran-
dom variable is normally distributed if its probability density function is of the form
where 
is the mean and 
is the standard deviation.

A factory produces (cylindrically shaped) roller bearings that are sold as
having diameter 4.0 cm and length 6.0 cm. In fact, the diameters X are normally distrib-
uted with mean 4.0 cm and standard deviation 0.01 cm while the lengths Y are normally
distributed with mean 6.0 cm and standard deviation 0.01 cm. Assuming that X and Y are
independent, write the joint density function and graph it. Find the probability that a
bearing randomly chosen from the production line has either length or diameter that
differs from the mean by more than 0.02 cm.
SOLUTION We are given that X and Y are normally distributed with 
, 
and 
. So the individual density functions for X and Y are
Since X and Y are independent, the joint density function is the product:
A graph of this function is shown in Figure 9.
Let’s ﬁrst calculate the probability that both X and Y differ from their means by less
than 0.02 cm. Using a calculator or computer to estimate the integral, we have
Then the probability that either X or Y differs from its mean by more than 0.02 cm is

probability that an infected individual will spread the disease to
an uninfected individual is a function of the distance between
them. Consider a circular city of radius 10 miles in which the
population is uniformly distributed. For an uninfected individ-
ual at a ﬁxed point 
, assume that the probability func-
tion is given by

In this section we apply double integrals to the problem of computing the area of a surface.
We start by ﬁnding a formula for the area of a parametric surface and then, as a special
case, we deduce a formula for the surface area of the graph of a function of two variables.
We recall from Section 10.5 that a parametric surface 
is deﬁned by a vector-valued
function of two parameters
or, equivalently, by parametric equations
where 
varies throughout a region 
in the 
-plane.
We will ﬁnd the area of by dividing into patches and approximating the area of each
patch by the area of a piece of a tangent plane. So ﬁrst let’s recall from Section 11.4 how
to ﬁnd tangent planes to parametric surfaces.
Let 
be a point on 
with position vector 
. If we keep 
constant by putting
, then 
becomes a vector function of the single parameter and deﬁnes a grid
curve 
lying on . (See Figure 1.) The tangent vector to 
at 
is obtained by taking
the partial derivative of with respect to :
Similarly, if we keep constant by putting 
, we get a grid curve 
given by 
that lies on , and its tangent vector at 
is
If the normal vector
is not , then the surface 
is called smooth. (It has no 
“corners”.) In this case the tangent plane to at 
exists and can be found using the nor-
mal vector.
Now we deﬁne the surface area of a general parametric surface given by Equation 1. For
simplicity we start by considering a surface whose parameter domain 
is a rectangle, and
we divide it into subrectangles 
. Let’s choose 
to be the lower left corner of 
.

(See Figure 2.) The part 
of the surface that corresponds to 
is called a patch and has
the point 
with position vector 
as one of its corners. Let
be the tangent vectors at 
as given by Equations 3 and 2.
Figure 3(a) shows how the two edges of the patch that meet at 
can be approximated
by vectors. These vectors, in turn, can be approximated by the vectors 
and 
because partial derivatives can be approximated by difference quotients. So we approxi-
mate 
by the parallelogram determined by the vectors 
and 
. As shown in Fig-
ure 3(b), this parallelogram lies in the tangent plane to 
at 
. The area of this parallelo-
gram is
and so an approximation to the area of 
is
Our intuition tells us that this approximation gets better as we increase the number of sub-
rectangles, and we recognize the double sum as a Riemann sum for the double integral
. This motivates the following deﬁnition.
Definition If a smooth parametric surface 
is given by the equation

is covered just once as 
ranges throughout the parameter domain ,

SECTION 12.7
TRIPLE INTEGRALS
873
Just as we deﬁned single integrals for functions of one variable and double integrals for
functions of two variables, so we can deﬁne triple integrals for functions of three variables.
Let’s ﬁrst deal with the simplest case where 
is deﬁned on a rectangular box:
The ﬁrst step is to divide B into sub-boxes. We do this by dividing the interval 
into
l subintervals 
of equal width 
, dividing 
into m subintervals of width 
,
and dividing 
into n subintervals of width 
. The planes through the endpoints of
these subintervals parallel to the coordinate planes divide the box 
into 
sub-boxes
which are shown in Figure 1. Each sub-box has volume 
.
Then we form the triple Riemann sum
where the sample point 
is in 
. By analogy with the deﬁnition of a double
integral (12.1.5), we deﬁne the triple integral as the limit of the triple Riemann sums in (2).
Deﬁnition The triple integral of 
over the box 
is
if this limit exists.
Again, the triple integral always exists if 
is continuous. We can choose the sample
point to be any point in the sub-box, but if we choose it to be the point 
we get a
simpler-looking expression for the triple integral:
Just as for double integrals, the practical method for evaluating triple integrals is to
express them as iterated integrals as follows.
Fubini’s Theorem for Triple Integrals If 
is continuous on the rectangular box
, then
The iterated integral on the right side of Fubini’s Theorem means that we integrate ﬁrst
with respect to

Triple integral over a box
Evaluate the triple integral

SOLUTION We could use any of the six possible orders of integration. If we choose to 
integrate with respect to , then , and then , we obtain
Now we deﬁne the triple integral over a general bounded region E in three-
dimensional space (a solid) by much the same procedure that we used for double integrals
(12.3.2). We enclose 
in a box 
of the type given by Equation 1. Then we deﬁne a 
function 
so that it agrees with 
on 
but is 0 for points in 
that are outside . By 
deﬁnition,
This integral exists if 
is continuous and the boundary of 
is “reasonably smooth.” The
triple integral has essentially the same properties as the double integral (Properties 6–9 in
Section 12.3).
We restrict our attention to continuous functions and to certain simple types of regions.
A solid region 
is said to be of type 1 if it lies between the graphs of two continuous func-
tions of and , that is,

In particular, if the projection

SOLUTION When we set up a triple integral it’s wise to draw two diagrams: one of 
the solid region 
(see Figure 5) and one of its projection 
onto the 
-plane (see 
Figure 6). The lower boundary of the tetrahedron is the plane 
and the upper
boundary is the plane

) in the

A solid region
is of type 2 if it is of the form
where, this time, 
is the projection of 
onto the 
-plane (see Figure 7). The back sur-
face is 
, the front surface is 
, and we have
Finally, a type 3 region is of the form
where 
is the projection of 
onto the 
-plane, 
is the left surface, and
is the right surface (see Figure 8). For this type of region we have
In each of Equations 10 and 11 there may be two possible expressions for the integral
depending on whether 
is a type I or type II plane region (and corresponding to Equa-
tions 7 and 8).
Choosing the best order of integration
Evaluate 
, where 
is the region bounded by the paraboloid 
and the plane 
.
SOLUTION The solid 
is shown in Figure 9. If we regard it as a type 1 region, then we
need to consider its projection 
onto the 
-plane, which is the parabolic region in
Figure 10. (The trace of 
in the plane 
is the parabola 
.)
From 
we obtain 
, so the lower boundary surface of 
is
and the upper surface is

and so we obtain
Although this expression is correct, it is extremely difﬁcult to evaluate. So let’s
instead consider 
as a type 3 region. As such, its projection 
onto the 
-plane is the
disk 
shown in Figure 11.
Then the left boundary of 
is the paraboloid 
and the right boundary is
the plane 
, so taking 
and 
in Equation 11, we have
Although this integral could be written as
it’s easier to convert to polar coordinates in the

, 
. This
gives
Applications of Triple Integrals
Recall that if 
, then the single integral 
represents the area under the
curve 
from to , and if 
, then the double integral 
rep-
resents the volume under the surface 
and above 
. The corresponding inter-
pretation of a triple integral 
, where 
, is not very useful
because it would be the “hypervolume” of a four-dimensional object and, of course, that
is very difﬁcult to visualize. (Remember that 
is just the domain of the function ; the
graph of 
lies in four-dimensional space.) Nonetheless, the triple integral 
can be interpreted in different ways in different physical situations, depending on the phys-
ical interpretations of , , , and 
.
Let’s begin with the special case where 
for all points in . Then the triple
integral does represent the volume of :
For example, you can see this in the case of a type 1 region by putting 
in
Formula 6:
and from Section 12.3 we know this represents the volume that lies between the surfaces
and

| The most difﬁcult step in evaluating a triple
integral is setting up an expression for the region
of integration (such as Equation 9 in Example 2).
Remember that the limits of integration in the
inner integral contain at most two variables, the
limits of integration in the middle integral con-
tain at most one variable, and the limits of inte-
gration in the outer integral must be constants.

CHAPTER 12
MULTIPLE INTEGRALS
Use a triple integral to ﬁnd the volume of the tetrahedron 
bounded by the
planes 
, 
, 
, and 
.
SOLUTION The tetrahedron 
and its projection 
onto the 
-plane are shown in Fig-
ures 12 and 13. The lower boundary of 
is the plane 
and the upper boundary is
the plane 
, that is, 
.
Therefore we have
by the same calculation as in Example 4 in Section 12.3.
(Notice that it is not necessary to use triple integrals to compute volumes. They 
simply give an alternative method for setting up the calculation.)
All the applications of double integrals in Section 12.5 can be immediately extended to
triple integrals. For example, if the density function of a solid object that occupies the
region 
is 
, in units of mass per unit volume, at any given point 
, then its
mass is
and its moments about the three coordinate planes are

CHAPTER 12
MULTIPLE INTEGRALS
But we also know how to evaluate double integrals in polar coordinates. In fact, combin-
ing Equation 1 with Equation 12.4.3, we obtain
Formula 2 is the formula for triple integration in cylindrical coordinates. It says that
we convert a triple integral from rectangular to cylindrical coordinates by writing
, 
, leaving as it is, using the appropriate limits of integration for ,
, and , and replacing 
by 
. (Figure 3 shows how to remember this.) It is
worthwhile to use this formula when 
is a solid region easily described in cylindrical
coordinates, and especially when the function 
involves the expression 
.
Finding mass with cylindrical coordinates
A solid 
lies within the cylin-
der 
, below the plane 
, and above the paraboloid 
.
(See Figure 4.) The density at any point is proportional to its distance from the axis of
the cylinder. Find the mass of .
SOLUTION In cylindrical coordinates the cylinder is 
and the paraboloid is
, so we can write
Since the density at 
is proportional to the distance from the -axis, the density
function is
where 
is the proportionality constant. Therefore, from Formula 12.7.13, the mass of 
is
Integrating over a solid best described in cylindrical coordinates
Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION This iterated integral is a triple integral over the solid region 
and the projection of 
onto the 
-plane is the disk 
. The lower surface of
is the cone 
and its upper surface is the plane 
. (See Figure 5.)
This region has a much simpler description in cylindrical coordinates:

Therefore we have
Spherical Coordinates
In Section 9.7 we deﬁned the spherical coordinates 
of a point (see Figure 6) and
we demonstrated the following relationships between rectangular coordinates and spheri-
cal coordinates:
In this coordinate system the counterpart of a rectangular box is a spherical wedge
where 
and 
. Although we deﬁned triple integrals by dividing solids into
small boxes, it can be shown that dividing a solid into small spherical wedges always gives
the same result. So we divide 
into smaller spherical wedges
by means of equally
spaced spheres 
, half-planes 
, and half-cones 
. Figure 7 shows that
is approximately a rectangular box with dimensions 
, 
(arc of a circle with
radius 
angle 
), and 
(arc of a circle with radius 
angle 
). So
an approximation to the volume of 
is given by
Thus an approximation to a typical triple Riemann sum is
But this sum is a Riemann sum for the function
Consequently, the following formula for triple integration in spherical coordinates is
plausible.

CHAPTER 12
MULTIPLE INTEGRALS
Formula 4 says that we convert a triple integral from rectangular coordinates to spher-
ical coordinates by writing
using the appropriate limits of integration, and replacing 
by 
. This is
illustrated in Figure 8.
This formula can be extended to include more general spherical regions such as
In this case the formula is the same as in (4) except that the limits of integration for 
are
and 
.
Usually, spherical coordinates are used in triple integrals when surfaces such as cones
and spheres form the boundary of the region of integration.
Evaluate 
where 
is the unit ball:
SOLUTION Since the boundary of 
is a sphere, we use spherical coordinates:
In addition, spherical coordinates are appropriate because
Thus (4) gives
Note: It would have been extremely awkward to evaluate the integral in Example 3 with-
out spherical coordinates. In rectangular coordinates the iterated integral would have been
A volume that is easier in spherical coordinates
Use spherical coordinates
to ﬁnd the volume of the solid that lies above the cone 
and below the
sphere 
. (See Figure 9.)
SOLUTION Notice that the sphere passes through the origin and has center 
. We
write the equation of the sphere in spherical coordinates as

Suppose that a solid ball (a marble), a hollow ball (a squash ball), a solid cylinder (a steel bar),
and a hollow cylinder (a lead pipe) roll down a slope. Which of these objects reaches the bottom
ﬁrst? (Make a guess before proceeding.)
To answer this question, we consider a ball or cylinder with mass , radius , and moment of
inertia (about the axis of rotation). If the vertical drop is , then the potential energy at the top
is 
. Suppose the object reaches the bottom with velocity and angular velocity , so 
.
The kinetic energy at the bottom consists of two parts: 
from translation (moving down the
slope) and 
from rotation. If we assume that energy loss from rolling friction is negligible,
then conservation of energy gives

CHANGE OF VARIABLES IN MULTIPLE INTEGRALS

In one-dimensional calculus we often use a change of variable (a substitution) to simplify
an integral. By reversing the roles of and , we can write the Substitution Rule (5.5.5) as
where 
and 
, 
. Another way of writing Formula 1 is as follows:
A change of variables can also be useful in double integrals. We have already seen one
example of this: conversion to polar coordinates. The new variables and 
are related to
the old variables and by the equations
and the change of variables formula (12.4.2) can be written as
where 
is the region in the 
-plane that corresponds to the region 
in the
-plane.
More generally, we consider a change of variables that is given by a transformation
from the 
-plane to the 
-plane:
where and are related to and by the equations
or, as we sometimes write,
We usually assume that 
is a C transformation, which means that and have contin-
uous ﬁrst-order partial derivatives.
A transformation 
is really just a function whose domain and range are both subsets
of
. If
, then the point
is called the image of the point
.
If no two points have the same image, 
is called one-to-one. Figure 1 shows the effect of
a transformation 
on a region 
in the 
-plane.

into a region 
in the

If 
is a one-to-one transformation, then it has an inverse transformation
from the
-plane to the 
-plane and it may be possible to solve Equations 3 for 
and in terms
of and :
Determining the image of a region under a transformation
A transformation

Find the image of the square 
,
.
SOLUTION The transformation maps the boundary of 
into the boundary of the image.
So we begin by ﬁnding the images of the sides of . The ﬁrst side, 
, is given by 
. (See Figure 2.) From the given equations we have 
, 
, and so
. Thus 
is mapped into the line segment from 
to 
in the 
-plane.
The second side, 
is 
and, putting 
in the given equations, we
get
Eliminating , we obtain
which is part of a parabola. Similarly, 
is given by 
, whose image is
the parabolic arc
Finally, 
is given by 
whose image is 
, 
, that is,
. (Notice that as we move around the square in the counterclockwise direc-
tion, we also move around the parabolic region in the counterclockwise direction.) The
image of 
is the region 
(shown in Figure 2) bounded by the -axis and the parabolas
given by Equations 4 and 5.
Now let’s see how a change of variables affects a double integral. We start with a small
rectangle 
in the 
-plane whose lower left corner is the point 
and whose dimen-
sions are 
and 
. (See Figure 3.)

Similarly, the tangent vector at

We can approximate the image region

Similarly
This means that we can approximate R by a parallelogram determined by the vectors

The Jacobian is named after the German mathe-
matician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi (1804–1851).
Although the French mathematician Cauchy ﬁrst
used these special determinants involving partial
derivatives, Jacobi developed them into a method
for evaluating multiple integrals.

894
CHAPTER 12
MULTIPLE INTEGRALS
With this notation we can use Equation 6 to give an approximation to the area 
of :
where the Jacobian is evaluated at 
.
Next we divide a region in the 
-plane into rectangles 
and call their images in the
-plane 
. (See Figure 6.)
Applying the approximation (8) to each 
we approximate the double integral of 
over 
as follows:
where the Jacobian is evaluated at 
. Notice that this double sum is a Riemann sum
for the integral
The foregoing argument suggests that the following theorem is true. (A full proof is
given in books on advanced calculus.)
Change of Variables in a Double Integral Suppose that 
is a 
transformation
whose Jacobian is nonzero and that maps a region 
in the 
-plane onto a region
in the 
-plane. Suppose that 
is continuous on 
and that 
and 
are type I or
type II plane regions. Suppose also that 
is one-to-one, except perhaps on the
boundary of . Then
Theorem 9 says that we change from an integral in and to an integral in and by
expressing and in terms of and and writing

CHANGE OF VARIABLES IN MULTIPLE INTEGRALS
895
Notice the similarity between Theorem 9 and the one-dimensional formula in Equation 2.
Instead of the derivative 
, we have the absolute value of the Jacobian, that is,
.
As a ﬁrst illustration of Theorem 9, we show that the formula for integration in polar
coordinates is just a special case. Here the transformation 
from the 
-plane to the 
-plane is given by
and the geometry of the transformation is shown in Figure 7: 
maps an ordinary rectangle
in the 
-plane to a polar rectangle in the 
-plane. The Jacobian of 
is
Thus Theorem 9 gives
which is the same as Formula 12.4.2.
Evaluating a double integral with a change of variables
Use the change of
variables 
, 
to evaluate the integral 
, where 
is the region
bounded by the -axis and the parabolas 
and 
, 
.
SOLUTION The region 
is pictured in Figure 2 (on page 892). In Example 1 we discov-
ered that 
, where 
is the square 
. Indeed, the reason for making
the change of variables to evaluate the integral is that 
is a much simpler region than .
First we need to compute the Jacobian:

CHAPTER 12
MULTIPLE INTEGRALS
Note: Example 2 was not a very difﬁcult problem to solve because we were given a
suitable change of variables. If we are not supplied with a transformation, then the ﬁrst step
is to think of an appropriate change of variables. If 
is difﬁcult to integrate, then the
form of 
may suggest a transformation. If the region of integration 
is awkward,
then the transformation should be chosen so that the corresponding region in the 
-plane
has a convenient description.
Evaluate the integral 
, where 
is the trapezoidal region with
vertices 
, 
, 
, and 
.
SOLUTION Since it isn’t easy to integrate 
, we make a change of variables sug-
gested by the form of this function:
These equations deﬁne a transformation 
from the 
-plane to the 
-plane. Theorem 9
talks about a transformation 
from the 
-plane to the 
-plane. It is obtained by solving
Equations 10 for and :
The Jacobian of 
is
To ﬁnd the region 
in the 
-plane corresponding to , we note that the sides of 
lie on
the lines
and, from either Equations 10 or Equations 11, the image lines in the 
-plane are
Thus the region 
is the trapezoidal region with vertices 
, 
, 
, and
shown in Figure 8. Since
Theorem 9 gives

Triple Integrals
There is a similar change of variables formula for triple integrals. Let 
be a transfor-
mation that maps a region 
in 
-space onto a region 
in 
-space by means of the
equations
The Jacobian of 
is the following 
determinant:
Under hypotheses similar to those in Theorem 9, we have the following formula for triple
integrals:
The spherical coordinate transformation
Use Formula 13 to derive the 
formula for triple integration in spherical coordinates.
SOLUTION Here the change of variables is given by
We compute the Jacobian as follows:
Since 
, we have 
. Therefore
and Formula 13 gives
which is equivalent to Formula 12.8.4.

In this problem we ask you to prove this fact by evaluating the double integral in Problem 5.

This gives a rotation about the origin through the angle

corresponding region in the

Vector Calculus
In this chapter we study the calculus of vector ﬁelds. (These are functions that
assign vectors to points in space.) In particular we deﬁne line integrals (which
can be used to ﬁnd the work done by a force field in moving an object along 
a curve). Then we deﬁne surface integrals (which can be used to ﬁnd the rate 
of ﬂuid ﬂow across a surface). The connections between these new types of
integrals and the single, double, and triple integrals that we have already met 
are given by the higher-dimensional versions of the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus: Green’s Theorem, Stokes’ Theorem, and the Divergence Theorem.

CHAPTER 13
VECTOR CALCULUS
The vectors in Figure 1 are air velocity vectors that indicate the wind speed and direction
at points 10 m above the surface elevation in the San Francisco Bay area. (Notice that the
wind patterns on consecutive days are quite different.) Associated with every point in the
air we can imagine a wind velocity vector. This is an example of a velocity vector ﬁeld.
Other examples of velocity vector ﬁelds are illustrated in Figure 2: ocean currents and
ﬂow past an airfoil.
Another type of vector ﬁeld, called a force ﬁeld, associates a force vector with each
point in a region. An example is the gravitational force ﬁeld that we will look at in 
Example 4.

VECTOR FIELDS

In general, a vector ﬁeld is a function whose domain is a set of points in 
(or 
) and
whose range is a set of vectors in 
(or 
).
Definition Let 
be a set in 
(a plane region). A vector ﬁeld on 
is a
function 
that assigns to each point 
in 
a two-dimensional vector 
.
The best way to picture a vector ﬁeld is to draw the arrow representing the vector 
starting at the point 
. Of course, it’s impossible to do this for all points 
, but we
can gain a reasonable impression of 
by doing it for a few representative points in 
as
in Figure 3. Since 
is a two-dimensional vector, we can write it in terms of its com-
ponent functions
and 
as follows:
or, for short,
Notice that 
and 
are scalar functions of two variables and are sometimes called scalar
ﬁelds to distinguish them from vector ﬁelds.
Definition Let 
be a subset of 
. A vector ﬁeld on
is a function 
that
assigns to each point 
in 
a three-dimensional vector 
.
A vector ﬁeld 
on 
is pictured in Figure 4. We can express it in terms of its compo-
nent functions , , and 
as
As with the vector functions in Section 10.1, we can deﬁne continuity of vector ﬁelds 
and show that 
is continuous if and only if its component functions , 
, and 
are 
continuous.
We sometimes identify a point 
with its position vector 
and write
instead of 
. Then 
becomes a function that assigns a vector 
to a vec-
tor .
Drawing a two-dimensional vector ﬁeld
A vector ﬁeld on 
is deﬁned 
by 
. Describe 
by sketching some of the vectors 
as in
Figure 3.
SOLUTION Since 
, we draw the vector 
starting at the point 
in
Figure 5. Since 
, we draw the vector 
with starting point 
.
Continuing in this way, we calculate several other representative values of 
in the
table and draw the corresponding vectors to represent the vector ﬁeld in Figure 5.

CHAPTER 13
VECTOR CALCULUS
It appears from Figure 5 that each arrow is tangent to a circle with center the origin.
To conﬁrm this, we take the dot product of the position vector 
with the
vector 
:
This shows that 
is perpendicular to the position vector 
and is therefore
tangent to a circle with center the origin and radius 
. Notice also that
so the magnitude of the vector 
is equal to the radius of the circle.
Some computer algebra systems are capable of plotting vector ﬁelds in two or three
dimensions. They give a better impression of the vector ﬁeld than is possible by hand
because the computer can plot a large number of representative vectors. Figure 6 shows a
computer plot of the vector ﬁeld in Example 1; Figures 7 and 8 show two other vector
ﬁelds. Notice that the computer scales the lengths of the vectors so they are not too long
and yet are proportional to their true lengths.
Drawing a three-dimensional vector ﬁeld
Sketch the vector ﬁeld on 
given by 
.
SOLUTION The sketch is shown in Figure 9. Notice that all vectors are vertical and point
upward above the 
-plane or downward below it. The magnitude increases with the 
distance from the 
-plane.
We were able to draw the vector ﬁeld in Example 2 by hand because of its particularly
simple formula. Most three-dimensional vector ﬁelds, however, are virtually impossible to

sketch by hand and so we need to resort to a computer algebra system. Examples are
shown in Figures 10, 11, and 12. Notice that the vector ﬁelds in Figures 10 and 11 have simi-
lar formulas, but all the vectors in Figure 11 point in the general direction of the negative
y-axis because their y-components are all 2. If the vector ﬁeld in Figure 12 represents a
velocity ﬁeld, then a particle would be swept upward and would spiral around the -axis in
the clockwise direction as viewed from above.
Velocity fields
Imagine a ﬂuid ﬂowing steadily along a pipe and let
be the velocity vector at a point 
. Then 
assigns a vector to each point
in a certain domain 
(the interior of the pipe) and so 
is a vector ﬁeld on 
called a velocity ﬁeld. A possible velocity ﬁeld is illustrated in Figure 13. The speed at
any given point is indicated by the length of the arrow.
Velocity ﬁelds also occur in other areas of physics. For instance, the vector ﬁeld in
Example 1 could be used as the velocity ﬁeld describing the counterclockwise rotation of
a wheel. We have seen other examples of velocity ﬁelds in Figures 1 and 2.
The gravitational ﬁeld
Newton’s Law of Gravitation states that the magni-
tude of the gravitational force between two objects with masses 
and 
is
where is the distance between the objects and 
is the gravitational constant. (This 
is an example of an inverse square law.) Let’s assume that the object with mass 
is 
located at the origin in 
. (For instance, 
could be the mass of the earth and the origin
would be at its center.) Let the position vector of the object with mass
be
.
Then 
, so 
. The gravitational force exerted on this second object acts
toward the origin, and the unit vector in this direction is
Therefore the gravitational force acting on the object at 
is

Formula 3 written in the form 
.] The function given by Equation 3 is
an example of a vector ﬁeld, called the gravitational ﬁeld, because it associates a vector
[the force 
] with every point in space.
Formula 3 is a compact way of writing the gravitational ﬁeld, but we can also write 
it in terms of its component functions by using the facts that
and
:
The gravitational ﬁeld 
is pictured in Figure 14.
Electric force ﬁelds
Suppose an electric charge 
is located at the origin.
According to Coulomb’s Law, the electric force 
exerted by this charge on a charge
located at a point 
with position vector 
is
where is a constant (that depends on the units used). For like charges, we have 
and the force is repulsive; for unlike charges, we have 
and the force is attractive.
Notice the similarity between Formulas 3 and 4. Both vector ﬁelds are examples of force
ﬁelds.
Instead of considering the electric force , physicists often consider the force per unit
charge:
Then 
is a vector ﬁeld on 
called the electric ﬁeld of .

grad ) is deﬁned by
Therefore

ent vectors are perpendicular to the level curves, as we would expect from Section 11.6.

Notice also that the gradient vectors are long where the level curves are close to each
other and short where the curves are farther apart. That’s because the length of the gradi-
ent vector is the value of the directional derivative of 
and closely spaced level curves
indicate a steep graph.
A vector ﬁeld 
is called a conservative vector ﬁeld if it is the gradient of some scalar
function, that is, if there exists a function 
such that 
. In this situation 
is called
a potential function for .
Not all vector ﬁelds are conservative, but such ﬁelds do arise frequently in physics. For
example, the gravitational ﬁeld F in Example 4 is conservative because if we deﬁne
then
In Sections 13.3 and 13.5 we will learn how to tell whether or not a given vector ﬁeld is
conservative.

SECTION 13.2
LINE INTEGRALS

In this section we deﬁne an integral that is similar to a single integral except that instead
of integrating over an interval 
, we integrate over a curve . Such integrals are called
line integrals, although “curve integrals” would be better terminology. They were invented
in the early 19th century to solve problems involving ﬂuid ﬂow, forces, electricity, and
magnetism.
We start with a plane curve 
given by the parametric equations
or, equivalently, by the vector equation 
, and we assume that 
is a
smooth curve. [This means that 
is continuous and 
. See Section 10.3.] If we
divide the parameter interval 
into n subintervals 
of equal width and we let
and 
, then the corresponding points 
divide 
into 
subarcs
with lengths 
(See Figure 1.) We choose any point 
in the th
subarc. (This corresponds to a point 
in 
.) Now if 
is any function of two vari-
ables whose domain includes the curve , we evaluate 
at the point 
, multiply by
the length 
of the subarc, and form the sum
which is similar to a Riemann sum. Then we take the limit of these sums and make the fol-
lowing deﬁnition by analogy with a single integral.
Definition If 
is deﬁned on a smooth curve 
given by Equations 1, then the
line integral of f along C is
if this limit exists.
In Section 6.4 we found that the length of 
is
A similar type of argument can be used to show that if 
is a continuous function, then the
limit in Deﬁnition 2 always exists and the following formula can be used to evaluate the
line integral:
The value of the line integral does not depend on the parametrization of the curve, pro-
vided that the curve is traversed exactly once as t increases from a to b.

If

So the way to remember Formula 3 is to express everything in terms of the parameter 
Use the parametric equations to express and in terms of t and write ds as
In the special case where 
is the line segment that joins 
to

parameter, we can write the parametric equations of 
as follows: 
, 
,
. Formula 3 then becomes
and so the line integral reduces to an ordinary single integral in this case.
Just as for an ordinary single integral, we can interpret the line integral of a positive
function as an area. In fact, if

SOLUTION In order to use Formula 3, we ﬁrst need parametric equations to represent C.
Recall that the unit circle can be parametrized by means of the equations
and the upper half of the circle is described by the parameter interval 
(See Figure 3.) Therefore Formula 3 gives
Suppose now that

Any physical interpretation of a line integral 
depends on the physical inter-
pretation of the function . Suppose that 
represents the linear density at a point
of a thin wire shaped like a curve . Then the mass of the part of the wire from 
to 
in Figure 1 is approximately 
and so the total mass of the wire is approx-
imately 
. By taking more and more points on the curve, we obtain the mass
of the wire as the limiting value of these approximations:
[For example, if 
represents the density of a semicircular wire, then the
integral in Example 1 would represent the mass of the wire.] The center of mass of the
wire with density function is located at the point 
, where
Other physical interpretations of line integrals will be discussed later in this chapter.

A wire takes the shape of the semicircle
, 
, and is thicker near its base than near the top. Find the center of
mass of the wire if the linear density at any point is proportional to its distance from the
line

Two other line integrals are obtained by replacing

When we want to distinguish the original line integral 
from those in Equa-

a parametric representation for a curve whose geometric description is given. In particular,

Then

Notice that we got different answers in parts (a) and (b) of Example 4 even though the
two curves had the same endpoints. Thus, in general, the value of a line integral depends
not just on the endpoints of the curve but also on the path. (But see Section 13.3 for con-
ditions under which the integral is independent of the path.)
Notice also that the answers in Example 4 depend on the direction, or orientation, of the
curve. If

CHAPTER 13
VECTOR CALCULUS
In general, a given parametrization 
, 
, 
, determines an orien-
tation of a curve , with the positive direction corresponding to increasing values of the
parameter 
(See Figure 8, where the initial point 
corresponds to the parameter value 
and the terminal point 
corresponds to 
.)
If 
denotes the curve consisting of the same points as 
but with the opposite ori-
entation (from initial point 
to terminal point 
in Figure 8), then we have
But if we integrate with respect to arc length, the value of the line integral does not change
when we reverse the orientation of the curve:
This is because 
is always positive, whereas 
and 
change sign when we reverse
the orientation of .
Line Integrals in Space
We now suppose that 
is a smooth space curve given by the parametric equations
or by a vector equation 
. If 
is a function of three variables
that is continuous on some region containing 
, then we deﬁne the line integral of
along 
(with respect to arc length) in a manner similar to that for plane curves:
We evaluate it using a formula similar to Formula 3:
Observe that the integrals in both Formulas 3 and 9 can be written in the more compact
vector notation
For the special case 
, we get
where 
is the length of the curve 
(see Formula 10.3.3).

Adding the values of these integrals, we obtain
Line Integrals of Vector Fields
Recall from Section 6.6 that the work done by a variable force 
in moving a particle
from to along the -axis is 
. Then in Section 9.3 we found that the work
done by a constant force 
in moving an object from a point
to another point 
in space
is 
, where 
l is the displacement vector.
Now suppose that 
is a continuous force ﬁeld on 
, such as the
gravitational ﬁeld of Example 4 in Section 13.1 or the electric force ﬁeld of Example 5 in
Section 13.1. (A force ﬁeld on 
could be regarded as a special case where 
and 
and 
depend only on and .) We wish to compute the work done by this force in mov-
ing a particle along a smooth curve .
We divide 
into subarcs 
with lengths 
by dividing the parameter interval
into subintervals of equal width. (See Figure 1 for the two-dimensional case or 
Figure 11 for the three-dimensional case.) Choose a point 
on the th subarc
corresponding to the parameter value 
. If 
is small, then as the particle moves from
to 
along the curve, it proceeds approximately in the direction of 
, the unit tan-
gent vector at 
. Thus the work done by the force 
in moving the particle from 
to
is approximately
and the total work done in moving the particle along 
is approximately
where 
is the unit tangent vector at the point 
on . Intuitively, we see that
these approximations ought to become better as becomes larger. Therefore we deﬁne the
work
done by the force ﬁeld 
as the limit of the Riemann sums in (11), namely,
Equation 12 says that work is the line integral with respect to arc length of the tangential
component of the force.
If the curve 
is given by the vector equation 
, then
, so using Equation 9 we can rewrite Equation 12 in the form

SECTION 13.3
THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM FOR LINE INTEGRALS
925
Recall from Section 5.4 that Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus can be writ-
ten as
where 
is continuous on 
. We also called Equation 1 the Net Change Theorem: The
integral of a rate of change is the net change.
If we think of the gradient vector 
of a function 
of two or three variables as a sort
of derivative of , then the following theorem can be regarded as a version of the Funda-
mental Theorem for line integrals.
Theorem Let
be a smooth curve given by the vector function
,
.
Let 
be a differentiable function of two or three variables whose gradient vector
is continuous on . Then
Note: Theorem 2 says that we can evaluate the line integral of a conservative vector
ﬁeld (the gradient vector ﬁeld of the potential function ) simply by knowing the value of
at the endpoints of 
. In fact, Theorem 2 says that the line integral of

change in f. If

is a plane curve with initial point
and terminal point 
, as in Figure 1(a), then Theorem 2 becomes
If 
is a function of three variables and 
is a space curve joining the point 
to the point 
as in Figure 1(b), then we have

13.3 The Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals

926
CHAPTER 13
VECTOR CALCULUS
PROOF OF THEOREM 2 Using Deﬁnition 13.2.13, we have
(by the Chain Rule)
The last step follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Equation 1).
Although we have proved Theorem 2 for smooth curves, it is also true for piecewise-
smooth curves. This can be seen by subdividing 
into a ﬁnite number of smooth curves
and adding the resulting integrals.
Applying the Fundamental Theorem to the calculation of work
Find the work
done by the gravitational ﬁeld
in moving a particle with mass 
from the point 
to the point 
along a
piecewise-smooth curve . (See Example 4 in Section 13.1.)
SOLUTION From Section 13.1 we know that 
is a conservative vector ﬁeld and, in fact,
, where
Therefore, by Theorem 2, the work done is
Independence of Path
Suppose 
and 
are two piecewise-smooth curves (which are called paths) that have the
same initial point 
and terminal point . We know from Example 4 in Section 13.2 that,
in general, 
. But one implication of Theorem 2 is that
whenever 
is continuous. In other words, the line integral of a conservative vector ﬁeld
depends only on the initial point and terminal point of a curve.
In general, if 
is a continuous vector ﬁeld with domain , we say that the line integral
is independent of path if 
for any two paths 
and 
in 
that have the same initial and terminal points. With this terminology we can say that line
integrals of conservative vector ﬁelds are independent of path.

A curve is called closed if its terminal point coincides with its initial point, that is,
. (See Figure 2.) If 
is independent of path in 
and 
is any closed
path in , we can choose any two points 
and 
on 
and regard 
as being composed
of the path 
from 
to 
followed by the path 
from 
to . (See Figure 3.) Then
since 
and 
have the same initial and terminal points.
Conversely, if it is true that 
whenever 
is a closed path in 
, then we
demonstrate independence of path as follows. Take any two paths 
and 
from 
to 
in 
and deﬁne 
to be the curve consisting of 
followed by 
. Then
and so 
. Thus we have proved the following theorem.
Theorem
is independent of path in 
if and only if 
for
every closed path 
in .
Since we know that the line integral of any conservative vector ﬁeld 
is independent
of path, it follows that 
for any closed path. The physical interpretation is that
the work done by a conservative force ﬁeld (such as the gravitational or electric ﬁeld in
Section 13.1) as it moves an object around a closed path is 0.
The following theorem says that the only vector ﬁelds that are independent of path are
conservative. It is stated and proved for plane curves, but there is a similar version for
space curves. We assume that 
is open, which means that for every point 
in 
there is
a disk with center 
that lies entirely in 
. (So 
doesn’t contain any of its boundary
points.) In addition, we assume that 
is connected: this means that any two points in 
can be joined by a path that lies in .
Theorem Suppose 
is a vector ﬁeld that is continuous on an open connected 
region . If 
is independent of path in , then 
is a conservative vector
ﬁeld on 
; that is, there exists a function 
such that 
.
PROOF Let 
be a ﬁxed point in . We construct the desired potential function 
by deﬁning
for any point 
in . Since 
is independent of path, it does not matter 
which path 
from 
to 
is used to evaluate 
. Since 
is open, there
exists a disk contained in 
with center 
. Choose any point 
in the disk with
and let 
consist of any path 
from 
to 
followed by the horizontal
line segment 
from 
to 
. (See Figure 4.) Then
Notice that the ﬁrst of these integrals does not depend on , so

ment, using a vertical line segment (see Figure 5), shows that
Thus
which says that 
is conservative.
The question remains: How is it possible to determine whether or not a vector ﬁeld 
is conservative? Suppose it is known that 
is conservative, where 
and 
have continuous ﬁrst-order partial derivatives. Then there is a function 
such that 
, that is,
Therefore, by Clairaut’s Theorem,
Theorem If 
is a conservative vector ﬁeld,
where 
and 
have continuous ﬁrst-order partial derivatives on a domain , then
throughout 
we have
The converse of Theorem 5 is true only for a special type of region. To explain this, we
ﬁrst need the concept of a simple curve, which is a curve that doesn’t intersect itself any-
where between its endpoints. [See Figure 6; 
for a simple closed curve, but
when 
.]
In Theorem 4 we needed an open connected region. For the next theorem we need a
stronger condition. A simply-connected region in the plane is a connected region 
such
that every simple closed curve in 
encloses only points that are in . Notice from Figure
7 that, intuitively speaking, a simply-connected region contains no hole and can’t consist
of two separate pieces.
In terms of simply-connected regions, we can now state a partial converse to Theorem 5
that gives a convenient method for verifying that a vector ﬁeld on 
is conservative. The
proof will be sketched in the next section as a consequence of Green’s Theorem.

Also, the domain of

appear to point in roughly the same direction as

So it appears plausible that line integrals around
all closed paths are . Example 3 shows that 
is indeed conservative.

Integrating (7) with respect to , we obtain
Notice that the constant of integration is a constant with respect to , that is, a function
of , which we have called

Comparing (8) and (10), we see that

This method is much shorter than the straightforward method for evaluating line inte-
grals that we learned in Section 13.2.
A criterion for determining whether or not a vector ﬁeld on 
is conservative is given
in Section 13.5. Meanwhile, the next example shows that the technique for ﬁnding the
potential function is much the same as for vector ﬁelds on

Conservation of Energy
Let’s apply the ideas of this chapter to a continuous force ﬁeld 
that moves an object
along a path 
given by 
, 
, where 
is the initial point and 
is the terminal point of 
. According to Newton’s Second Law of Motion (see Sec-
tion 10.4), the force 
at a point on 
is related to the acceleration 
by the
equation
So the work done by the force on the object is
(Theorem 10.2.3, Formula 4)
(Fundamental Theorem of Calculus)
Therefore
where 
is the velocity.
The quantity 
, that is, half the mass times the square of the speed, is called the
kinetic energy of the object. Therefore we can rewrite Equation 15 as
which says that the work done by the force ﬁeld along 
is equal to the change in kinetic
energy at the endpoints of .
Now let’s further assume that 
is a conservative force ﬁeld; that is, we can write
. In physics, the potential energy of an object at the point 
is deﬁned as
, so we have 
. Then by Theorem 2 we have

Comparing this equation with Equation 16, we see that
which says that if an object moves from one point 
to another point 
under the inﬂuence
of a conservative force ﬁeld, then the sum of its potential energy and its kinetic energy
remains constant. This is called the Law of Conservation of Energy and it is the reason
the vector ﬁeld is called conservative.

CHAPTER 13
VECTOR CALCULUS
Green’s Theorem gives the relationship between a line integral around a simple closed
curve 
and a double integral over the plane region 
bounded by . (See Figure 1. We
assume that 
consists of all points inside 
as well as all points on .) In stating Green’s
Theorem we use the convention that the positive orientation of a simple closed curve 
refers to a single counterclockwise traversal of . Thus, if 
is given by the vector func-
tion 
, 
, then the region 
is always on the left as the point 
traverses .
(See Figure 2.)
Green’s Theorem Let 
be a positively oriented, piecewise-smooth, simple closed
curve in the plane and let 
be the region bounded by . If 
and 
have continu-
ous partial derivatives on an open region that contains , then
Note: The notation
gC
is sometimes used to indicate that the line integral is calculated using the positive orienta-
tion of the closed curve . Another notation for the positively oriented boundary curve of
is 
, so the equation in Green’s Theorem can be written as
Green’s Theorem should be regarded as the counterpart of the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus for double integrals. Compare Equation 1 with the statement of the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, in the following equation:
In both cases there is an integral involving derivatives (
, 
, and 
) on the left
side of the equation. And in both cases the right side involves the values of the original
functions ( , , and ) only on the boundary of the domain. (In the one-dimensional case,
the domain is an interval 
whose boundary consists of just two points, and .)

GREEN’S THEOREM
935
Green’s Theorem is not easy to prove in general, but we can give a proof for the special
case where the region is both type I and type II (see Section 12.3). Let’s call such regions
simple regions.
PROOF OF GREEN’S THEOREM FOR THE CASE IN WHICH 
IS A SIMPLE REGION Notice that
Green’s Theorem will be proved if we can show that
and
We prove Equation 2 by expressing 
as a type I region:
where 
and 
are continuous functions. This enables us to compute the double integral
on the right side of Equation 2 as follows:
where the last step follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Now we compute the left side of Equation 2 by breaking up 
as the union of the
four curves 
, 
, 
, and 
shown in Figure 3. On 
we take as the parameter and
write the parametric equations as 
, 
, 
. Thus
Observe that 
goes from right to left but 
goes from left to right, so we can write
the parametric equations of

George Green
Green’s Theorem is named after the self-
taught English scientist George Green
(1793–1841). He worked full-time in his father’s
bakery from the age of nine and taught himself
mathematics from library books. In 1828 he 
published privately An Essay on the Application
of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of
Electricity and Magnetism, but only 100 copies
were printed and most of those went to his
friends. This pamphlet contained a theorem 
that is equivalent to what we know as Green’s
Theorem, but it didn’t become widely known 
at that time. Finally, at age 40, Green entered 
Cambridge University as an undergraduate 
but died four years after graduation. In 1846 
William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) located a copy 
of Green’s essay, realized its signiﬁcance, and
had it reprinted. Green was the ﬁrst person to 
try to formulate a mathematical theory of elec-
tricity and magnetism. His work was the basis
for the subsequent electromagnetic theories of
Thomson, Stokes, Rayleigh, and Maxwell.

CHAPTER 13
VECTOR CALCULUS
Comparing this expression with the one in Equation 4, we see that
Equation 3 can be proved in much the same way by expressing 
as a type II region (see
Exercise 30). Then, by adding Equations 2 and 3, we obtain Green’s Theorem.
Using Green’s Theorem to calculate a line integral
Evaluate 
,
where 
is the triangular curve consisting of the line segments from 
to 
, from
to 
, and from 
to 
.
SOLUTION Although the given line integral could be evaluated as usual by the methods of
Section 13.2, that would involve setting up three separate integrals along the three sides
of the triangle, so let’s use Green’s Theorem instead. Notice that the region 
enclosed
by 
is simple and 
has positive orientation (see Figure 4). If we let 
and
, then we have
A line integral impossible to evaluate without Green’s Theorem
Evaluate 
, where 
is the circle 
.
SOLUTION The region 
bounded by 
is the disk 
, so let’s change to polar
coordinates after applying Green’s Theorem:
In Examples 1 and 2 we found that the double integral was easier to evaluate than the
line integral. (Try setting up the line integral in Example 2 and you’ll soon be convinced!)
But sometimes it’s easier to evaluate the line integral, and Green’s Theorem is used in the
reverse direction. For instance, if it is known that 
on the curve ,
then Green’s Theorem gives
no matter what values 
and 
assume in the region .
Another application of the reverse direction of Green’s Theorem is in computing areas.
Since the area of

GREEN’S THEOREM

There are several possibilities:
Then Green’s Theorem gives the following formulas for the area of 
:
Find the area enclosed by the ellipse
.
SOLUTION The ellipse has parametric equations 
and 
, where
. Using the third formula in Equation 5, we have
Formula 5 can be used to explain how planimeters work. A planimeter is a mechani-
cal instrument used for measuring the area of a region by tracing its boundary curve. These
devices are useful in all the sciences: in biology for measuring the area of leaves or wings,
in medicine for measuring the size of cross-sections of organs or tumors, in forestry for
estimating the size of forested regions from photographs.
Figure 5 shows the operation of a polar planimeter: The pole is ﬁxed and, as the tracer
is moved along the boundary curve of the region, the wheel partly slides and partly rolls
perpendicular to the tracer arm. The planimeter measures the distance that the wheel rolls
and this is proportional to the area of the enclosed region. The explanation as a conse-
quence of Formula 5 can be found in the following articles:
■R. W. Gatterman, “The planimeter as an example of Green’s Theorem” Amer. Math.
Monthly, Vol. 88 (1981), pp. 701–4.

(2007), pp. 24 –31.
Extended Versions of Green’s Theorem
Although we have proved Green’s Theorem only for the case where 
is simple, we can
now extend it to the case where 
is a ﬁnite union of simple regions. For example, if 
is
the region shown in Figure 6, then we can write 
, where 
and 
are both
simple. The boundary of 
is 
and the boundary of 
is 
so, apply-
ing Green’s Theorem to 
and 
separately, we get

CHAPTER 13
VECTOR CALCULUS
If we add these two equations, the line integrals along 
and 
cancel, so we get
which is Green’s Theorem for 
, since its boundary is 
.
The same sort of argument allows us to establish Green’s Theorem for any ﬁnite union
of nonoverlapping simple regions (see Figure 7).
Evaluate 
, where 
is the boundary of the semiannu-
lar region 
in the upper half-plane between the circles 
and 
.
SOLUTION Notice that although 
is not simple, the -axis divides it into two simple
regions (see Figure 8). In polar coordinates we can write
Therefore Green’s Theorem gives
Green’s Theorem can be extended to apply to regions with holes, that is, regions that
are not simply-connected. Observe that the boundary 
of the region 
in Figure 9 con-
sists of two simple closed curves 
and 
. We assume that these boundary curves are 
oriented so that the region 
is always on the left as the curve 
is traversed. Thus the 
positive direction is counterclockwise for the outer curve 
but clockwise for the inner
curve 
. If we divide 
into two regions 
and 
by means of the lines shown in 
Figure 10 and then apply Green’s Theorem to each of 
and 
we get
Since the line integrals along the common boundary lines are in opposite directions, they
cancel and we get
which is Green’s Theorem for the region .
Using the general version of Green’s Theorem
If 
, show that 
for every positively ori-
ented simple closed path that encloses the origin.
SOLUTION Since 
is an arbitrary closed path that encloses the origin, it’s difﬁcult to 
compute the given integral directly. So let’s consider a counterclockwise-oriented circle

be the region bounded by

. Then its positively
oriented boundary is 
and so the general version of Green’s Theorem gives
Therefore

We now easily compute this last integral using the parametrization given by

We end this section by using Green’s Theorem to discuss a result that was stated in the
preceding section.
SKETCH OF PROOF OF THEOREM 13.3.6 We’re assuming that

derivatives, and that
If 
is any simple closed path in , and 
is the region that 
encloses, then Green’s
Theorem gives
A curve that is not simple crosses itself at one or more points and can be broken up into
a number of simple curves. We have shown that the line integrals of 
around these 
simple curves are all 0 and, adding these integrals, we see that 
for any
closed curve . Therefore

by Theorem 13.3.3. It
follows that

In this section we deﬁne two operations that can be performed on vector ﬁelds and that
play a basic role in the applications of vector calculus to ﬂuid ﬂow and electricity and mag-
netism. Each operation resembles differentiation, but one produces a vector ﬁeld whereas
the other produces a scalar ﬁeld.
Curl
If 
is a vector ﬁeld on 
and the partial derivatives of , , and 
all exist, then the curl of 
is the vector ﬁeld on 
deﬁned by
As an aid to our memory, let’s rewrite Equation 1 using operator notation. We intro-
duce the vector differential operator 
(“del”) as
It has meaning when it operates on a scalar function to produce the gradient of :
If we think of 
as a vector with components 
, 
, and 
, we can also consider
the formal cross product of 
with the vector ﬁeld 
as follows:
So the easiest way to remember Deﬁnition 1 is by means of the symbolic expression

Using curl

Show that the vector ﬁeld
is not conservative.
SOLUTION In Example 1 we showed that
This shows that 
and so, by Theorem 3, 
is not conservative.
The converse of Theorem 3 is not true in general, but the following theorem says the
converse is true if 
is deﬁned everywhere. (More generally it is true if the domain is 
simply-connected, that is, “has no hole.”) Theorem 4 is the three-dimensional version 
of Theorem 13.3.6. Its proof requires Stokes’ Theorem and is sketched at the end of 
Section 13.7.
Theorem If 
is a vector ﬁeld deﬁned on all of 
whose component func-
tions have continuous partial derivatives and 
, then 
is a conservative
vector ﬁeld.

(a) We compute the curl of :
Since 
and the domain of

is a conservative vector ﬁeld by 
Theorem 4.

Differentiating (8) with respect to , we get 
, so comparison
with (6) gives 
. Thus 
and
Then (7) gives 
. Therefore
The reason for the name curl is that the curl vector is associated with rotations. One
connection is explained in Exercise 37. Another occurs when 
represents the velocity
ﬁeld in ﬂuid ﬂow (see Example 3 in Section 13.1). Particles near (x, y, ) in the ﬂuid tend
to rotate about the axis that points in the direction of 
, and the length of this
curl vector is a measure of how quickly the particles move around the axis (see Figure 1).
If 
at a point , then the ﬂuid is free from rotations at 
and 
is called irro-
tational at . In other words, there is no whirlpool or eddy at P. If 
, then a 
tiny paddle wheel moves with the ﬂuid but doesn’t rotate about its axis. If 
, the
paddle wheel rotates about its axis. We give a more detailed explanation in Section 13.7 as
a consequence of Stokes’ Theorem.
Divergence
If 
is a vector ﬁeld on 
and 
, 
, and 
exist, then
the divergence of 
is the function of three variables deﬁned by
Observe that 
is a vector ﬁeld but 
is a scalar ﬁeld. In terms of the gradient oper-
ator 
, the divergence of 
can be written symbolically
as the dot product of 
and :

.
SOLUTION By the deﬁnition of divergence (Equation 9 or 10) we have
If 
is a vector ﬁeld on 
, then 
is also a vector ﬁeld on 
. As such, we can 
compute its divergence. The next theorem shows that the result is 0.

CURL AND DIVERGENCE
945
PROOF Using the deﬁnitions of divergence and curl, we have
because the terms cancel in pairs by Clairaut’s Theorem.
Show that the vector ﬁeld 
can’t be 
written as the curl of another vector ﬁeld, that is, 
.
SOLUTION In Example 4 we showed that
and therefore 
. If it were true that 
, then Theorem 11 would give
which contradicts 
. Therefore 
is not the curl of another vector ﬁeld.
Again, the reason for the name divergence can be understood in the context of ﬂuid
ﬂow. If 
is the velocity of a ﬂuid (or gas), then 
represents the net rate
of change (with respect to time) of the mass of ﬂuid (or gas) ﬂowing from the point 
per unit volume. In other words, 
measures the tendency of the ﬂuid to diverge
from the point 
. If 
, then 
is said to be incompressible.
Another differential operator occurs when we compute the divergence of a gradient vec-
tor ﬁeld 
. If 
is a function of three variables, we have
and this expression occurs so often that we abbreviate it as 
. The operator
is called the Laplace operator because of its relation to Laplace’s equation
We can also apply the Laplace operator 
to a vector ﬁeld
in terms of its components:

Vector Forms of Green’s Theorem
The curl and divergence operators allow us to rewrite Green’s Theorem in versions that
will be useful in our later work. We suppose that the plane region , its boundary curve 
, and the functions 
and 
satisfy the hypotheses of Green’s Theorem. Then we con-
sider the vector ﬁeld 
. Its line integral is
and, regarding 
as a vector ﬁeld on 
with third component , we have
Therefore
and we can now rewrite the equation in Green’s Theorem in the vector form
Equation 12 expresses the line integral of the tangential component of 
along 
as the
double integral of the vertical component of 
over the region 
enclosed by . We
now derive a similar formula involving the normal component of .
If 
is given by the vector equation
then the unit tangent vector (see Section 10.2) is
You can verify that the outward unit normal vector to

The relationship between surface integrals and surface area is much the same as the rela-
tionship between line integrals and arc length. Suppose is a function of three variables
whose domain includes a surface . We will deﬁne the surface integral of over 
in such
a way that, in the case where 
, the value of the surface integral is equal to the
surface area of . We start with parametric surfaces and then deal with the special case
where 
is the graph of a function of two variables.
Parametric Surfaces
Recall from Section 10.5 that a parametric surface is deﬁned by a vector function 
of two parameters and :
We ﬁrst assume that the parameter domain 
is a rectangle and we divide it into subrect-
angles 
with dimensions 
and 
. Then the surface 
is divided into corresponding
patches 
as in Figure 1. We evaluate 
at a point 
in each patch, multiply by the area
of the patch, and form the Riemann sum
Then we take the limit as the number of patches increases and deﬁne the surface integral
of f over the surface S as
Notice the analogy with the deﬁnition of a line integral (13.2.2) and also the analogy with
the deﬁnition of a double integral (12.1.5).
To evaluate the surface integral in Equation 1 we approximate the patch area 
by the
area of an approximating parallelogram in the tangent plane. In our discussion of surface
area in Section 12.6 we made the approximation

The top surface

Therefore
Oriented Surfaces
To deﬁne surface integrals of vector ﬁelds, we need to rule out nonorientable surfaces such
as the Möbius strip shown in Figure 4. [It is named after the German geometer August
Möbius (1790–1868).] You can construct one for yourself by taking a long rectangular
strip of paper, giving it a half-twist, and taping the short edges together as in Figure 5. 
If an ant were to crawl along the Möbius strip starting at a point , it would end up on 
the “other side” of the strip (that is, with its upper side pointing in the opposite direction).
Then, if the ant continued to crawl in the same direction, it would end up back at the 
same point without ever having crossed an edge. (If you have constructed a Möbius strip,
try drawing a pencil line down the middle.) Therefore a Möbius strip really has only 
one side. You can graph the Möbius strip using the parametric equations in Exercise 32 in 
Section 10.5.

CHAPTER 13
VECTOR CALCULUS
From now on we consider only orientable (two-sided) surfaces. We start with a surface
that has a tangent plane at every point 
on (except at any boundary point). There
are two unit normal vectors 
and 
at 
. (See Figure 6.) 
If it is possible to choose a unit normal vector 
at every such point 
so that 
varies continuously over , then is called an oriented surface and the given choice of 
provides with an orientation. There are two possible orientations for any orientable sur-
face (see Figure 7).
For a surface 
given as the graph of , we use Equation 3 to associate with
the surface a natural orientation given by the unit normal vector
Since the -component is positive, this gives the upward orientation of the surface.
If 
is a smooth orientable surface given in parametric form by a vector function 
, then it is automatically supplied with the orientation of the unit normal vector
and the opposite orientation is given by 
. For instance, in Example 4 in Section 10.5 we
found the parametric representation
for the sphere 
. Then in Example 1 in Section 12.6 we found that
and
So the orientation induced by 
is deﬁned by the unit normal vector
Observe that points in the same direction as the position vector, that is, outward from the
sphere (see Figure 8). The opposite (inward) orientation would have been obtained (see
Figure 9) if we had reversed the order of the parameters because 
.
For a closed surface, that is, a surface that is the boundary of a solid region , the 
convention is that the positive orientation is the one for which the normal vectors point
outward from , and inward-pointing normals give the negative orientation (see Figures 8
and 9).

Surface Integrals of Vector Fields
Suppose that 
is an oriented surface with unit normal vector , and imagine a ﬂuid with
density 
and velocity ﬁeld 
ﬂowing through . (Think of 
as an imagi-
nary surface that doesn’t impede the ﬂuid ﬂow, like a ﬁshing net across a stream.) Then the
rate of ﬂow (mass per unit time) per unit area is 
. If we divide 
into small patches 
,
as in Figure 10 (compare with Figure 1), then 
is nearly planar and so we can approxi-
mate the mass of ﬂuid per unit time crossing 
in the direction of the normal 
by the
quantity
where , , and are evaluated at some point on 
. (Recall that the component of the vec-
tor 
in the direction of the unit vector is 
.) By summing these quantities and tak-
ing the limit we get, according to Deﬁnition 1, the surface integral of the function 
over :
and this is interpreted physically as the rate of ﬂow through .
If we write 
, then 
is also a vector ﬁeld on 
and the integral in Equation 7
becomes
A surface integral of this form occurs frequently in physics, even when 
is not 
, and is
called the surface integral (or ﬂux integral) of 
over .
Definition If 
is a continuous vector ﬁeld deﬁned on an oriented surface 
with unit normal vector , then the surface integral of 
over S is
This integral is also called the ﬂux of 
across .
In words, Deﬁnition 8 says that the surface integral of a vector ﬁeld over 
is equal to
the surface integral of its normal component over 
(as previously deﬁned).
If

, then

SOLUTION As in Example 1, we use the parametric representation
Then
and, from Example 1 in Section 12.6,
Therefore
and, by Formula 9, the ﬂux is
by the same calculation as in Example 1.
If, for instance, the vector ﬁeld in Example 4 is a velocity ﬁeld describing the ﬂow of a
ﬂuid with density 1, then the answer, 
, represents the rate of ﬂow through the unit
sphere in units of mass per unit time.
In the case of a surface given by a graph

eters and use Equation 3 to write
Thus Formula 9 becomes

statics is Gauss’s Law, which says that the net charge enclosed by a closed surface 
is
where 
is a constant (called the permittivity of free space) that depends on the units used.
(In the SI system, 
.) Therefore, if the vector ﬁeld 
in
Example 4 represents an electric ﬁeld, we can conclude that the charge enclosed by 
is
.
Another application of surface integrals occurs in the study of heat ﬂow. Suppose the
temperature at a point 
in a body is 
. Then the heat ﬂow is deﬁned as the
vector ﬁeld
where 
is an experimentally determined constant called the conductivity of the sub-
stance. The rate of heat ﬂow across the surface 
in the body is then given by the surface
integral
The temperature in a metal ball is proportional to the square of the 
distance from the center of the ball. Find the rate of heat ﬂow across a sphere 
of 
radius with center at the center of the ball.
SOLUTION Taking the center of the ball to be at the origin, we have
where 
is the proportionality constant. Then the heat ﬂow is
where 
is the conductivity of the metal. Instead of using the usual parametrization of
the sphere as in Example 4, we observe that the outward unit normal to the sphere
at the point

But on

Stokes’ Theorem can be regarded as a higher-dimensional version of Green’s Theorem.
Whereas Green’s Theorem relates a double integral over a plane region 
to a line integral
around its plane boundary curve, Stokes’ Theorem relates a surface integral over a surface
to a line integral around the boundary curve of (which is a space curve). Figure 1 shows

an oriented surface with unit normal vector . The orientation of 
induces the positive
orientation of the boundary curve C shown in the ﬁgure. This means that if you walk in
the positive direction around 
with your head pointing in the direction of , then the sur-
face will always be on your left.
Stokes’ Theorem Let 
be an oriented piecewise-smooth surface that is bounded 
by a simple, closed, piecewise-smooth boundary curve 
with positive orientation.
Let 
be a vector ﬁeld whose components have continuous partial derivatives on 
an open region in 
that contains . Then
Since
Stokes’ Theorem says that the line integral around the boundary curve of 
of the tangen-
tial component of 
is equal to the surface integral of the normal component of the curl 
of .
The positively oriented boundary curve of the oriented surface 
is often written as 
, so Stokes’ Theorem can be expressed as
There is an analogy among Stokes’ Theorem, Green’s Theorem, and the Fundamental 
Theorem of Calculus. As before, there is an integral involving derivatives on the left side
of Equation 1 (recall that 
is a sort of derivative of ) and the right side involves the
values of 
only on the boundary of .
In fact, in the special case where the surface 
is ﬂat and lies in the 
-plane with
upward orientation, the unit normal is , the surface integral becomes a double integral,
and Stokes’ Theorem becomes
This is precisely the vector form of Green’s Theorem given in Equation 13.5.12. Thus we
see that Green’s Theorem is really a special case of Stokes’ Theorem.
Although Stokes’ Theorem is too difﬁcult for us to prove in its full generality, we can
give a proof when 
is a graph and , , and 
are well behaved.
PROOF OF A SPECIAL CASE OF STOKES’ THEOREM We assume that the equation of 
is
, where has continuous second-order partial derivatives and 
is a simple plane region whose boundary curve 
corresponds to . If the orientation of
is upward, then the positive orientation of 
corresponds to the positive orientation of
. (See Figure 2.) We are also given that 
, where the partial deriv-
atives of , , and 
are continuous.

George Stokes
Stokes’ Theorem is named after the Irish mathe-
matical physicist Sir George Stokes (1819–1903).
Stokes was a professor at Cambridge University
(in fact he held the same position as Newton,
Lucasian Professor of Mathematics) and was
especially noted for his studies of ﬂuid ﬂow 
and light. What we call Stokes’ Theorem was
actually discovered by the Scottish physicist 
Sir William Thomson (1824–1907, known as 
Lord Kelvin). Stokes learned of this theorem 
in a letter from Thomson in 1850 and asked 
students to prove it on an examination at 
Cambridge University in 1854. We don’t know 
if any of those students was able to do so.

This allows us, with the aid of the Chain Rule, to evaluate the line integral as follows:
where we have used Green’s Theorem in the last step. Then, using the Chain Rule again
and remembering that , , and 
are functions of , , and and that is itself a func-
tion of and , we get
Four of the terms in this double integral cancel and the remaining six terms can be
arranged to coincide with the right side of Equation 2. Therefore

SOLUTION The curve 
(an ellipse) is shown in Figure 3. Although 
could be 
evaluated directly, it’s easier to use Stokes’ Theorem. We ﬁrst compute
Although there are many surfaces with boundary C, the most convenient choice is the
elliptical region S in the plane 
that is bounded by . If we orient 
upward,
then 
has the induced positive orientation. The projection 
of

the disk 
and so using Equation 13.6.10 with

Using Stokes’ Theorem to calculate a surface integral

CHAPTER 13
VECTOR CALCULUS
Note that in Example 2 we computed a surface integral simply by knowing the values
of 
on the boundary curve . This means that if we have another oriented surface with the
same boundary curve , then we get exactly the same value for the surface integral!
In general, if 
and 
are oriented surfaces with the same oriented boundary curve 
and both satisfy the hypotheses of Stokes’ Theorem, then
This fact is useful when it is difﬁcult to integrate over one surface but easy to integrate over
the other.
We now use Stokes’ Theorem to throw some light on the meaning of the curl vector.
Suppose that 
is an oriented closed curve and represents the velocity ﬁeld in ﬂuid ﬂow.
Consider the line integral
and recall that 
is the component of 
in the direction of the unit tangent vector .
This means that the closer the direction of is to the direction of , the larger the value of
. Thus 
is a measure of the tendency of the ﬂuid to move around 
and is
called the circulation of around . (See Figure 5.)
Now let 
be a point in the ﬂuid and let 
be a small disk with radius and
center 
Then (
for all points 
on 
because 
is con-
tinuous. Thus, by Stokes’ Theorem, we get the following approximation to the circulation
around the boundary circle 
:
This approximation becomes better as 
and we have
Equation 4 gives the relationship between the curl and the circulation. It shows that
is a measure of the rotating effect of the ﬂuid about the axis n. The curling effect
is greatest about the axis parallel to 
.
Finally, we mention that Stokes’ Theorem can be used to prove Theorem 13.5.4 (which
states that if 
on all of 
, then 
is conservative). From our previous work
(Theorems 13.3.3 and 13.3.4), we know that 
is conservative if 
for every
closed path . Given , suppose we can ﬁnd an orientable surface 
whose boundary is 
. (This can be done, but the proof requires advanced techniques.) Then Stokes’ Theorem
gives
A curve that is not simple can be broken into a number of simple curves, and the integrals
around these simple curves are all 0. Adding these integrals, we obtain 
for
any closed curve .

WRITING PROJECT
Three Men and Two Theorems
Although two of the most important theorems in vector calculus are named after George Green 
and George Stokes, a third man, William Thomson (also known as Lord Kelvin), played a large
role in the formulation, dissemination, and application of both of these results. All three men 
were interested in how the two theorems could help to explain and predict physical phenomena 
in electricity and magnetism and ﬂuid ﬂow. The basic facts of the story are given in the margin
notes on pages 935 and 961.
Write a report on the historical origins of Green’s Theorem and Stokes’ Theorem. Explain the
similarities and relationship between the theorems. Discuss the roles that Green, Thomson, and
Stokes played in discovering these theorems and making them widely known. Show how both
theorems arose from the investigation of electricity and magnetism and were later used to study a
variety of physical problems.
The dictionary edited by Gillispie [2] is a good source for both biographical and scientiﬁc 
information. The book by Hutchinson [5] gives an account of Stokes’ life and the book by 
Thompson [8] is a biography of Lord Kelvin. The articles by Grattan-Guinness [3] and Gray [4]
and the book by Cannell [1] give background on the extraordinary life and works of Green. 
Additional historical and mathematical information is found in the books by Katz [6] and 
Kline [7].

SECTION 13.8
THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM
967
In Section 13.5 we rewrote Green’s Theorem in a vector version as
where 
is the positively oriented boundary curve of the plane region . If we were seek-
ing to extend this theorem to vector ﬁelds on 
, we might make the guess that
where 
is the boundary surface of the solid region . It turns out that Equation 1 is true,
under appropriate hypotheses, and is called the Divergence Theorem. Notice its similarity
to Green’s Theorem and Stokes’ Theorem in that it relates the integral of a derivative of a
function (
in this case) over a region to the integral of the original function 
over the
boundary of the region.
At this stage you may wish to review the various types of regions over which we were
able to evaluate triple integrals in Section 12.7. We state and prove the Divergence Theo-
rem for regions 
that are simultaneously of types 1, 2, and 3 and we call such regions 
simple solid regions. (For instance, regions bounded by ellipsoids or rectangular boxes are
simple solid regions.) The boundary of 
is a closed surface, and we use the convention,
introduced in Section 13.6, that the positive orientation is outward; that is, the unit normal
vector 
is directed outward from .
The Divergence Theorem Let 
be a simple solid region and let S be the boundary
surface of E, given with positive (outward) orientation. Let 
be a vector ﬁeld
whose component functions have continuous partial derivatives on an open region
that contains . Then
Thus the Divergence Theorem states that, under the given conditions, the ﬂux of 
across the boundary surface of 
is equal to the triple integral of the divergence of 
over .

13.8 The Divergence Theorem
The Divergence Theorem is sometimes called
Gauss’s Theorem after the great German mathe-
matician Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855), who
discovered this theorem during his investigation
of electrostatics. In Eastern Europe the Diver-
gence Theorem is known as Ostrogradsky’s 
Theorem after the Russian mathematician
Mikhail Ostrogradsky (1801–1862), who pub-
lished this result in 1826.

Therefore, to prove the Divergence Theorem, it sufﬁces to prove the following three
equations:
To prove Equation 4 we use the fact that 
is a type 1 region:
where

onto the 
-plane. By Equation 12.7.6, we have
and therefore, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
The boundary surface 
consists of three pieces: the bottom surface 
, the top surface
, and possibly a vertical surface 
, which lies above the boundary curve of D. (See
Figure 1. It might happen that 
doesn’t appear, as in the case of a sphere.) Notice that
on 
we have 
, because k is vertical and n is horizontal, and so
Thus, regardless of whether there is a vertical surface, we can write

Then we have
Although we have proved the Divergence Theorem only for simple solid regions, it can
be proved for regions that are ﬁnite unions of simple solid regions. (The procedure is sim-
ilar to the one we used in Section 13.4 to extend Green’s Theorem.)
For example, let’s consider the region
that lies between the closed surfaces
and
,
where 
lies inside 
. Let 
and 
be outward normals of 
and 
. Then the boundary
surface of 
is 
and its normal 
is given by 
on 
and 
on 
(See Figure 3.) Applying the Divergence Theorem to , we get
Let’s apply this to the electric ﬁeld (see Example 5 in Section 13.1):
where 
is a small sphere with radius 
and center the origin. You can verify that
. (See Exercise 23.) Therefore Equation 7 gives
The point of this calculation is that we can compute the surface integral over 
because 
is a sphere. The normal vector at 
is 
. Therefore
since the equation of

. Thus we have
This shows that the electric ﬂux of

through any closed surface 
that contains 
the origin. [This is a special case of Gauss’s Law (Equation 13.6.11) for a single charge.

Another application of the Divergence Theorem occurs in ﬂuid ﬂow. Let 
be
the velocity ﬁeld of a ﬂuid with constant density . Then 
is the rate of ﬂow per
unit area. If 
is a point in the ﬂuid and 
is a ball with center 
and very small
radius , then 
for all points in 
since 
is continuous. We approx-
imate the ﬂux over the boundary sphere 
as follows:
This approximation becomes better as 
and suggests that
Equation 8 says that 
is the net rate of outward ﬂux per unit volume at 
. (This
is the reason for the name divergence.) If 
, the net ﬂow is outward near 
and
is called a source. If 
, the net ﬂow is inward near 
and 
is called a sink.
For the vector ﬁeld in Figure 4, it appears that the vectors that end near 
are shorter
than the vectors that start near 
Thus the net ﬂow is outward near 
so 
and 
is a source. Near 
on the other hand, the incoming arrows are longer than the 
outgoing arrows. Here the net ﬂow is inward, so 
and 
is a sink. We 
can use the formula for F to conﬁrm this impression. Since 
, we have
, which is positive when 
. So the points above the line 
are sources and those below are sinks.

the liquid. Then the pressure at depth is 
, where 
is the acceleration due to gravity (see Section 6.6). The total
buoyant force on the solid due to the pressure distribution is
given by the surface integral
where 
is the outer unit normal. Use the result of Exer-
cise 31 to show that 
, where

the liquid displaced by the solid. (Note that

Archimedes’ principle: The buoyant force on an object
equals the weight of the displaced liquid.

SUMMARY
973
The main results of this chapter are all higher-dimensional versions of the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus. To help you remember them, we collect them together here (with-
out hypotheses) so that you can see more easily their essential similarity. Notice that in
each case we have an integral of a “derivative” over a region on the left side, and the right
side involves the values of the original function only on the boundary of the region.

1. Let

be a point such that each line that starts 
at

at most once. The solid angle
subtended by

starting at

be the intersection of

the sphere with center 
and radius . Then the measure of the solid angle (in steradians) is
deﬁned to be
Apply the Divergence Theorem to the part of 
between 
and 
to show that
where is the radius vector from 
to any point on , 
, and the unit normal vector 
is
directed away from .
This shows that the deﬁnition of the measure of a solid angle is independent of the radius 
of the sphere. Thus the measure of the solid angle is equal to the area subtended on a unit
sphere. (Note the analogy with the deﬁnition of radian measure.) The total solid angle sub-
tended by a sphere at its center is thus 
steradians.

6. The ﬁgure depicts the sequence of events in each cylinder of a four-cylinder internal combus-
tion engine. Each piston moves up and down and is connected by a pivoted arm to a rotating
crankshaft. Let 
and 
be the pressure and volume within a cylinder at time , where
gives the time required for a complete cycle. The graph shows how 
and 
vary
through one cycle of a four-stroke engine.
During the intake stroke (from ①to ②) a mixture of air and gasoline at atmospheric pres-
sure is drawn into a cylinder through the intake valve as the piston moves downward. Then
the piston rapidly compresses the mix with the valves closed in the compression stroke (from
②to ③) during which the pressure rises and the volume decreases. At ③the sparkplug ignites
the fuel, raising the temperature and pressure at almost constant volume to ④. Then, with
valves closed, the rapid expansion forces the piston downward during the power stroke (from
④to ⑤). The exhaust valve opens, temperature and pressure drop, and mechanical energy
stored in a rotating ﬂywheel pushes the piston upward, forcing the waste products out of the
exhaust valve in the exhaust stroke. The exhaust valve closes and the intake valve opens.
We’re now back at ①and the cycle starts again.
(a) Show that the work done on the piston during one cycle of a four-stroke engine is

the force on the piston is

to work directly with Riemann sums.]

INTERVALS, INEQUALITIES, AND ABSOLUTE VALUES
Certain sets of real numbers, called intervals, occur frequently in calculus and correspond
geometrically to line segments. For example, if 
, the open interval from to con-
sists of all numbers between and and is denoted by the symbol 
. Using set-builder
notation, we can write
Notice that the endpoints of the interval—namely, and —are excluded. This is indicated
by the round brackets 
and by the open dots in Figure 1. The closed interval from 
to
is the set
Here the endpoints of the interval are included. This is indicated by the square brackets 
and by the solid dots in Figure 2. It is also possible to include only one endpoint in an inter-
val, as shown in Table 1.
Table of Intervals
We also need to consider inﬁnite intervals such as
This does not mean that 
(“inﬁnity”) is a number. The notation 
stands for the set
of all numbers that are greater than , so the symbol 
simply indicates that the interval
extends indeﬁnitely far in the positive direction.

When working with inequalities, note the following rules.

Rule 1 says that we can add any number to both sides of an inequality, and Rule 2 says
that two inequalities can be added. However, we have to be careful with multiplication.
Rule 3 says that we can multiply both sides of an inequality by a positive number, but
| Rule 4 says that if we multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, then we
reverse the direction of the inequality. For example, if we take the inequality 
and
multiply by , we get 
, but if we multiply by 
, we get 
. Finally, Rule 5
says that if we take reciprocals, then we reverse the direction of an inequality (provided
the numbers are positive).
Solve the inequality 
.
SOLUTION The given inequality is satisﬁed by some values of but not by others. To
solve an inequality means to determine the set of numbers for which the inequality is
true. This is called the solution set.
First we subtract 1 from each side of the inequality (using Rule 1 with 
):
Then we subtract 
from both sides (Rule 1 with 
):
Now we divide both sides by 
(Rule 4 with 
):
These steps can all be reversed, so the solution set consists of all numbers greater than
. In other words, the solution of the inequality is the interval 
.
Solve the inequality 
.
SOLUTION First we factor the left side:
We know that the corresponding equation 
has the solutions 2 and 3.
The numbers 2 and 3 divide the real line into three intervals:
On each of these intervals we determine the signs of the factors. For instance,
Then we record these signs in the following chart:
Another method for obtaining the information in the chart is to use test values. For
instance, if we use the test value 
for the interval 
, then substitution in

INTERVALS, INEQUALITIES, AND ABSOLUTE VALUES
The polynomial 
doesn’t change sign inside any of the three intervals, so we
conclude that it is positive on 
.
Then we read from the chart that 
is negative when 
. Thus
the solution of the inequality 
is
Notice that we have included the endpoints 2 and 3 because we are looking for values
of such that the product is either negative or zero. The solution is illustrated in Figure 4.
Solve 
.
SOLUTION First we take all nonzero terms to one side of the inequality sign and factor
the resulting expression:
As in Example 2 we solve the corresponding equation 
and use the
solutions 
, 
, and 
to divide the real line into four intervals 
,
, 
, and 
. On each interval the product keeps a constant sign as shown
in the following chart:
Then we read from the chart that the solution set is
The solution is illustrated in Figure 5.

The points in a plane can be identiﬁed with ordered pairs of real numbers. We start by
drawing two perpendicular coordinate lines that intersect at the origin
on each line.
Usually one line is horizontal with positive direction to the right and is called the 
-axis; the other line is vertical with positive direction upward and is called the -axis.
Any point 
in the plane can be located by a unique ordered pair of numbers as follows.
Draw lines through 
perpendicular to the - and -axes. These lines intersect the axes in
points with coordinates 
and 
as shown in Figure 1. Then the point 
is assigned the
ordered pair 
. The ﬁrst number is called the x-coordinate of ; the second number
is called the y-coordinate of . We say that 
is the point with coordinates 
, and
we denote the point by the symbol 
. Several points are labeled with their coordi-
nates in Figure 2.
By reversing the preceding process we can start with an ordered pair 
and arrive
at the corresponding point . Often we identify the point 
with the ordered pair 
and
refer to “the point 
.” [Although the notation used for an open interval 
is the 
same as the notation used for a point 
, you will be able to tell from the context which
meaning is intended.]
This coordinate system is called the rectangular coordinate system or the Cartesian
coordinate system in honor of the French mathematician René Descartes (1596–1650),
even though another Frenchman, Pierre Fermat (1601–1665), invented the principles of
analytic geometry at about the same time as Descartes. The plane supplied with this coor-
dinate system is called the coordinate plane or the Cartesian plane and is denoted by
.
The - and -axes are called the coordinate axes and divide the Cartesian plane into
four quadrants, which are labeled I, II, III, and IV in Figure 1. Notice that the ﬁrst quad-
rant consists of those points whose - and -coordinates are both positive.

SOLUTION
(a) The points whose -coordinates are 0 or positive lie on the -axis or to the right of it
as indicated by the shaded region in Figure 3(a).
(b) The set of all points with -coordinate 1 is a horizontal line one unit above the -axis
[see Figure 3(b)].
(c) Recall from Appendix A that
The given region consists of those points in the plane whose -coordinates lie between
and . Thus the region consists of all points that lie between (but not on) the hori-
zontal lines 
and 
. [These lines are shown as dashed lines in Figure 3(c) to
indicate that the points on these lines don’t lie in the set.]
Recall from Appendix A that the distance between points 
and 
on a number line is
. Thus the distance between points 
and 
on a hor-
izontal line must be 
and the distance between 
and 
on a ver-
tical line must be 
. (See Figure 4.)
To ﬁnd the distance 
between any two points

that triangle

we have

Circles
An equation of a curve is an equation satisﬁed by the coordinates of the points on the
curve and by no other points. Let’s use the distance formula to ﬁnd the equation of a circle
with radius and center 
. By deﬁnition, the circle is the set of all points 
whose
distance from the center 
is . (See Figure 5.) Thus 
is on the circle if and only 
if 
. From the distance formula, we have
or equivalently, squaring both sides, we get
This is the desired equation.
Equation of a Circle An equation of the circle with center 
and radius is 
In particular, if the center is the origin 
, the equation is
For instance, an equation of the circle with radius 3 and center 
is
Sketch the graph of the equation 
by ﬁrst
showing that it represents a circle and then ﬁnding its center and radius.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst group the -terms and -terms as follows:
Then we complete the square within each grouping, adding the appropriate constants
(the squares of half the coefﬁcients of and ) to both sides of the equation:
or
Comparing this equation with the standard equation of a circle, we see that

, so the given equation represents a circle with center 
and

Lines
To ﬁnd the equation of a line 
we use its slope, which is a measure of the steepness of the
line.
Deﬁnition The slope of a nonvertical line that passes through the points 
and 
is
The slope of a vertical line is not deﬁned.
Thus the slope of a line is the ratio of the change in , 
, to the change in , 
. (See
Figure 7.) The slope is therefore the rate of change of y with respect to x. The fact that the
line is straight means that the rate of change is constant.
Figure 8 shows several lines labeled with their slopes. Notice that lines with positive
slope slant upward to the right, whereas lines with negative slope slant downward to the
right. Notice also that the steepest lines are the ones for which the absolute value of the
slope is largest, and a horizontal line has slope 0.
Now let’s ﬁnd an equation of the line that passes through a given point 
and
has slope . A point 
with 
lies on this line if and only if the slope of the line
through 
and 
is equal to ; that is,
This equation can be rewritten in the form
and we observe that this equation is also satisﬁed when 
and 
. Therefore it is
an equation of the given line.
Point-Slope Form of the Equation of a Line An equation of the line passing through
the point 
and having slope 
is
Find an equation of the line through the points

Using the point-slope form with

Suppose a nonvertical line has slope 
and -intercept . (See Figure 9.) This means it
intersects the -axis at the point 
, so the point-slope form of the equation of the line,
with 
and 
, becomes
This simpliﬁes as follows.
Slope-Intercept Form of the Equation of a Line An equation of the line with slope 
and -intercept
is
In particular, if a line is horizontal, its slope is 
, so its equation is 
, where
is the -intercept (see Figure 10). A vertical line does not have a slope, but we can write
its equation as 
, where 
is the -intercept, because the -coordinate of every point
on the line is .
Graph the inequality 
.
SOLUTION We are asked to sketch the graph of the set 
and we begin
by solving the inequality for :
Compare this inequality with the equation 
, which represents a line with
slope 
and -intercept . We see that the given graph consists of points whose -coor-
dinates are larger than those on the line 
. Thus the graph is the region that
lies above the line, as illustrated in Figure 11.
Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
Slopes can be used to show that lines are parallel or perpendicular. The following facts are
proved, for instance, in Precalculus: Mathematics for Calculus, Fifth Edition by Stewart,
Redlin, and Watson (Belmont, CA, 2006).
Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
1. Two nonvertical lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.
2. Two lines with slopes 
and 
are perpendicular if and only if 
;
that is, their slopes are negative reciprocals:
Find an equation of the line through the point 
that is parallel to the
line

We can write this equation as

SOLUTION The equations can be written as

Since 
, the lines are perpendicular.
Conic Sections
Here we review the geometric deﬁnitions of parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas and their
standard equations. They are called conic sections, or conics, because they result from
intersecting a cone with a plane as shown in Figure 12.
Parabolas
A parabola is the set of points in a plane that are equidistant from a ﬁxed point 
(called
the focus) and a ﬁxed line (called the directrix). This deﬁnition is illustrated by Figure 13.
Notice that the point halfway between the focus and the directrix lies on the parabola; it is
called the vertex. The line through the focus perpendicular to the directrix is called the
axis of the parabola.
In the 16th century Galileo showed that the path of a projectile that is shot into 
the air at an angle to the ground is a parabola. Since then, parabolic shapes have been 
used in designing automobile headlights, reﬂecting telescopes, and suspension bridges.
(See Problem 18 on page 254 for the reﬂection property of parabolas that makes them so
useful.)
We obtain a particularly simple equation for a parabola if we place its vertex at the 
origin 
and its directrix parallel to the -axis as in Figure 14. If the focus is the point

, then the directrix has the equation 
and the parabola has the equation
(See Exercise 47.)
If we write 
, then the equation of the parabola becomes 
Figure 15 shows the graphs of several parabolas with equations of the form 
for
various values of the number . We see that the parabola 
opens upward if 
and downward if 
(as in Figure 16). The graph is symmetric with respect to the 
-axis because its equation is unchanged when 
is replaced by 
. This corresponds to
the fact that the function 
is an even function.
If we interchange and in the equation 
, the result is 
, which also rep-
resents a parabola. (Interchanging 
and 
amounts to reﬂecting about the diagonal line
.) The parabola 
opens to the right if 
and to the left if 
(See
Figure 17.) This time the parabola is symmetric with respect to the -axis because the
equation is unchanged when is replaced by

so 
or 
. Thus the points of intersection are 
and 
, and we draw the
line 
passing through these points.
To sketch the parabola 
we start with the parabola 
in 
Figure 17(b) and shift one unit to the right. We also make sure it passes through the
points 
and 
. The region bounded by 
and 
means the ﬁnite region whose boundaries are these curves. It is sketched in Figure 18.
Ellipses
An ellipse is the set of points in a plane the sum of whose distances from two ﬁxed points
and 
is a constant (see Figure 19). These two ﬁxed points are called the foci (plural
of focus). One of Kepler’s laws is that the orbits of the planets in the solar system are
ellipses with the sun at one focus.
In order to obtain the simplest equation for an ellipse, we place the foci on the 
-axis at the points 
and 
as in Figure 20, so that the origin is halfway between
the foci. If we let the sum of the distances from a point on the ellipse to the foci be 
, then
we can write an equation of the ellipse as
where 
. (See Exercise 49 and Figure 21.) Notice that the -intercepts are 
, the -intercepts are 
, the foci are 
, and the ellipse is symmetric with respect
to both axes. If the foci of an ellipse are located on the 
axis at 
, then we can ﬁnd
its equation by interchanging and in (1).
Sketch the graph of 
and locate the foci.
SOLUTION Divide both sides of the equation by 144:
The equation is now in the standard form for an ellipse, so we have 
, 
,
, and 
. The -intercepts are 
and the -intercepts are 
. Also,
, so 
and the foci are 
. The graph is sketched in 
Figure 22.
Like parabolas, ellipses have an interesting reﬂection property that has practical conse-
quences. If a source of light or sound is placed at one focus of a surface with elliptical
cross-sections, then all the light or sound is reﬂected off the surface to the other focus (see
Exercise 55). This principle is used in lithotripsy, a treatment for kidney stones. A reﬂec-

tor with elliptical cross-section is placed in such a way that the kidney stone is at one focus.
High-intensity sound waves generated at the other focus are reﬂected to the stone and
destroy it without damaging surrounding tissue. The patient is spared the trauma of sur-
gery and recovers within a few days.
Hyperbolas
A hyperbola is the set of all points in a plane the difference of whose distances from two
ﬁxed points 
and 
(the foci) is a constant. This deﬁnition is illustrated in Figure 23.
Notice that the deﬁnition of a hyperbola is similar to that of an ellipse; the only change
is that the sum of distances has become a difference of distances. It is left as Exercise 51
to show that when the foci are on the -axis at 
and the difference of distances is
, then the equation of the hyperbola is
where 
. Notice that the -intercepts are again 
. But if we put 
in
Equation 2 we get 
, which is impossible, so there is no -intercept. The hyper-
bola is symmetric with respect to both axes.
To analyze the hyperbola further, we look at Equation 2 and obtain
This shows that 
, so 
. Therefore we have 
or 
. This
means that the hyperbola consists of two parts, called its branches.
When we draw a hyperbola it is useful to ﬁrst draw its asymptotes, which are the 
lines 
and 
shown in Figure 24. Both branches of the hyperbola
approach the asymptotes; that is, they come arbitrarily close to the asymptotes. If the foci
of a hyperbola are on the -axis, we ﬁnd its equation by reversing the roles of and .
Find the foci and asymptotes of the hyperbola 
and
sketch its graph.
SOLUTION If we divide both sides of the equation by 144, it becomes
which is of the form given in (2) with 
and 
. Since

Here we review the aspects of trigonometry that are used in calculus: radian measure,
trigonometric functions, trigonometric identities, and inverse trigonometric functions.
Angles
Angles can be measured in degrees or in radians (abbreviated as rad). The angle given by
a complete revolution contains 
, which is the same as 
rad. Therefore

In calculus we use radians to measure angles except when otherwise indicated. The fol-
lowing table gives the correspondence between degree and radian measures of some com-
mon angles.
Figure 1 shows a sector of a circle with central angle 
and radius subtending an arc
with length . Since the length of the arc is proportional to the size of the angle, and since
the entire circle has circumference 
and central angle 
, we have
Solving this equation for and for , we obtain
Remember that Equations 3 are valid only when is measured in radians.
In particular, putting 
in Equation 3, we see that an angle of 1 rad is the angle sub-
tended at the center of a circle by an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle (see
Figure 2).
(a) If the radius of a circle is 5 cm, what angle is subtended by an arc of 6 cm?
(b) If a circle has radius 3 cm, what is the length of an arc subtended by a central angle
of 
rad?
SOLUTION
(a) Using Equation 3 with 
and 
, we see that the angle is
(b) With 
cm and 
rad, the arc length is
The standard position of an angle occurs when we place its vertex at the origin of a
coordinate system and its initial side on the positive -axis as in Figure 3. A positive angle
is obtained by rotating the initial side counterclockwise until it coincides with the termi-
nal side. Likewise, negative angles are obtained by clockwise rotation as in Figure 4.
Figure 5 shows several examples of angles in standard position. Notice that different
angles can have the same terminal side. For instance, the angles

rad represents a complete revolution.
The Trigonometric Functions
For an acute angle 
the six trigonometric functions are deﬁned as ratios of lengths of sides
of a right triangle as follows (see Figure 6).
This deﬁnition doesn’t apply to obtuse or negative angles, so for a general angle 
in
standard position we let 
be any point on the terminal side of 
and we let be the
distance 
as in Figure 7. Then we deﬁne
Since division by 0 is not deﬁned,

If 
is a number, the convention is that 
means the sine of the angle whose radian
measure is . For example, the expression 
implies that we are dealing with an angle
of 3 rad. When ﬁnding a calculator approximation to this number, we must remember to
set our calculator in radian mode, and then we obtain

Trigonometric Identities
A trigonometric identity is a relationship among the trigonometric functions. The most ele-
mentary are the following, which are immediate consequences of the deﬁnitions of the trig-
onometric functions.
For the next identity we refer back to Figure 7. The distance formula (or, equivalently,
the Pythagorean Theorem) tells us that

We have therefore proved one of the most useful of all trigonometric identities:
If we now divide both sides of Equation 7 by

is an even function. They are easily proved
by drawing a diagram showing 
and 
in standard position (see Exercise 19).
Since the angles 
and 
have the same terminal side, we have
These identities show that the sine and cosine functions are periodic with period 
.
The remaining trigonometric identities are all consequences of two basic identities
called the addition formulas:
The proofs of these addition formulas are outlined in Exercises 43, 44, and 45.
By substituting 
for 
in Equations 12a and 12b and using Equations 10a and 10b,
we obtain the following subtraction formulas:
Then, by dividing the formulas in Equations 12 or Equations 13, we obtain the corre-
sponding formulas for

If we put 
in the addition formulas (12), we get the double-angle formulas:

Because of the identity
(which can be veriﬁed using Equation 12a), the graph of cosine is obtained by shifting the
graph of sine by an amount 
to the left [see Figure 13(b)]. Note that for both the sine
and cosine functions the domain is 
and the range is the closed interval 
.
Thus, for all values of , we have
The graphs of the remaining four trigonometric functions are shown in Figure 14 and
their domains are indicated there. Notice that tangent and cotangent have range 
,
whereas cosecant and secant have range 
. All four functions are peri-
odic: tangent and cotangent have period , whereas cosecant and secant have period 
.

The deﬁnitions of limits that have been given in this book are appropriate for intuitive
understanding of the basic concepts of calculus. For the purposes of deeper understanding
and rigorous proofs, however, the precise deﬁnitions of this appendix are necessary. In par-
ticular, the deﬁnition of a limit given here is used in Appendix E to prove that the limit of
a sum is the sum of the limits. 
When we say that 
has a limit 
as 
approaches , we mean, according to the 
intuitive deﬁnition in Section 2.2, that we can make 
arbitrarily close to 
by 
taking 
close enough to 
(but not equal to ). A more precise deﬁnition is based on 
the idea of specifying just how small we need to make the distance 
in order to
make the distance 
less than some given number. The following example illus-
trates the idea.

SOLUTION A graph of 
is shown in Figure 1; we are interested in the
region near the point 
. Notice that we can rewrite the inequality
as
So we need to determine the values of for which the curve 
lies
between the horizontal lines 
and 
. Therefore we graph the curves
, 
, and 
near the point 
in Figure 2. Then we use
the cursor to estimate that the -coordinate of the point of intersection of the line
and the curve 
is about 
. Similarly, 
intersects the line 
when 
. So, rounding to be safe, we can say that
if
This interval 
is not symmetric about 
. The distance from 
to the
left endpoint is 
and the distance to the right endpoint is 0.12. We can
choose to be the smaller of these numbers, that is, 
. Then we can rewrite our
inequalities in terms of distances as follows:
if
This just says that by keeping within 0.08 of 1, we are able to keep 
within 0.2 
of 2.
Although we chose 
, any smaller positive value of would also have
worked.
Using the same graphical procedure as in Example 1, but replacing the number 0.2 by
smaller numbers, we ﬁnd that
if
if
if
In each case we have found a number 
such that the values of the function
lie in successively smaller intervals centered at 2 if the distance from
to 1 is less than . It turns out that it is always possible to ﬁnd such a number , no mat-
ter how small the interval is. In other words, for any positive number , no matter how
small, there exists a positive number such that
if
This indicates that
and suggests a more precise way of deﬁning the limit of a general function.

Deﬁnition Let be a function deﬁned on some open interval that contains the
number , except possibly at itself. Then we say that the limit of 
as 
approaches 
is , and we write

there is a corresponding number 
such that
if
Deﬁnition 1 is illustrated in Figures 3–5. If a number 
is given, then we draw 
the horizontal lines 
and 
and the graph of . (See Figure 3.) If
, then we can ﬁnd a number 
such that if we restrict 
to lie in the
interval 
and take 
, then the curve 
lies between the lines
and 
. (See Figure 4.) You can see that if such a 
has been found,
then any smaller will also work.
It’s important to realize that the process illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 must work for
every positive number no matter how small it is chosen. Figure 5 shows that if a smaller
is chosen, then a smaller may be required.
Use the 
deﬁnition to prove that

In proving limit statements it may be helpful to think of the deﬁnition of a limit as a
challenge. First it challenges you with a number . Then you must be able to produce a
suitable . You have to be able to do this for every
, not just a particular .
Imagine a contest between two people, A and B, and imagine yourself to be B. Person
A stipulates that the ﬁxed number should be approximated by the values of 
to with-
in a degree of accuracy 
(say, 0.01). Person B then responds by ﬁnding a number 
such
that 
whenever 
. Then A may become more exacting and
challenge B with a smaller value of 
(say, 0.0001). Again B has to respond by ﬁnding 
a corresponding . Usually the smaller the value of , the smaller the corresponding value
of must be. If B always wins, no matter how small A makes , then 
Prove that 
.
SOLUTION
1. Preliminary analysis of the problem (guessing a value for ). Let be a given
positive number. We want to ﬁnd a number such that
if
But 
. Therefore we want 
such that
if
that is,
if
then
This suggests that we should choose 
.
2. Proof (showing that this works). Given 
, choose 
. If
, then
Thus
if
Therefore, by the deﬁnition of a limit,
This example is illustrated by Figure 7.
Note that in the solution of Example 3 there were two stages—guessing and proving.
We made a preliminary analysis that enabled us to guess a value for . But then in the sec-
ond stage we had to go back and prove in a careful, logical fashion that we had made a
correct guess. This procedure is typical of much of mathematics. Sometimes it is neces-
sary to ﬁrst make an intelligent guess about the answer to a problem and then prove that
the guess is correct.
It’s not always easy to prove that limit statements are true using the 
deﬁnition. For
a more complicated function such as 
, a proof would
require a great deal of ingenuity. Fortunately, this is not necessary because the Limit Laws
stated in Section 2.3 can be proved using Deﬁnition 1, and then the limits of complicated
functions can be found rigorously from the Limit Laws without resorting to the deﬁnition
directly.

Limits at Infinity
Inﬁnite limits and limits at inﬁnity can also be deﬁned in a precise way. The following is
a precise version of Deﬁnition 4 in Section 2.5.
Deﬁnition Let 
be a function deﬁned on some interval 
. Then
means that for every 
there is a corresponding number 
such that
if
In words, this says that the values of 
can be made arbitrarily close to 
(within a distance , where is any positive number) by taking sufﬁciently large (larger
than , where 
depends on ). Graphically it says that by choosing large enough (larg-
er than some number ) we can make the graph of lie between the given horizontal lines
and 
as in Figure 8. This must be true no matter how small we
choose . If a smaller value of is chosen, then a larger value of 
may be required.
In Example 5 in Section 2.5 we calculated that 
In the next example we use a graphing device to relate this statement to Deﬁnition 2 with

, and 
is any sample point in the 
subinterval. The precise meaning
of this limit that deﬁnes the integral is as follows:
For every number 
there is an integer 
such that
for every integer 
and for every choice of 
in the 
subinterval.
This means that a deﬁnite integral can be approximated to within any desired degree of
accuracy by a Riemann sum.
Sequences
In Section 8.1 we used the notation 
to mean that the terms of the sequence 
approach as becomes large. Notice that the
following precise deﬁnition of the limit of a sequence is very similar to the deﬁnition of a
limit of a function at inﬁnity (Deﬁnition 2).
Deﬁnition A sequence 
has the limit
and we write
if for every 
there is a corresponding integer 
such that
if
Deﬁnition 3 is illustrated by Figure 11, in which the terms 
, 
, 
, . . . are plotted on
a number line. No matter how small an interval 
is chosen, there exists an
such that all terms of the sequence from 
onward must lie in that interval.
Another illustration of Deﬁnition 3 is given in Figure 12. The points on the graph 
of 
must lie between the horizontal lines 
and 
if 
. This 
picture must be valid no matter how small
is chosen, but usually a smaller 
requires a
larger

If you compare Deﬁnition 2 with Deﬁnition 3 you will see that the only difference
between 
and 
is that is required to be an integer. The fol-
lowing deﬁnition shows how to make precise the idea that 
becomes inﬁnite as 
becomes inﬁnite.
Deﬁnition The notation 
means that for every positive number 
there is an integer 
such that
if
Prove that 
.
SOLUTION Let 
be any positive number. (Think of it as being very large.) Then
So if we take 
, then Deﬁnition 4 shows that 
.
Functions of Two Variables
Here is a precise version of Deﬁnition 1 in Section 11.2:
Deﬁnition Let 
be a function of two variables whose domain D includes
points arbitrarily close to 
. Then we say that the limit of 
as 
approaches 
is 
and we write
if for every number 
there is a corresponding number 
such that
and
then
Notice that 
is the distance between the numbers 
and 
, and
is the distance between the point 
and the point 
. Thus
Deﬁnition 5 says that the distance between 
and 
can be made arbitrarily small by
making the distance from 
to 
sufﬁciently small (but not 0). An illustration of
Deﬁnition 5 is given in Figure 13 where the surface 
is the graph of . If 
is given,
we can ﬁnd 
such that if 
is restricted to lie in the disk 
with center 
and
radius , and if 
, then the corresponding part of 
lies between the horizon-
tal planes 
and 
.
Prove that

such that

APPENDIX E
A FEW PROOFS
In this appendix we present proofs of some theorems that were stated in the main body of
the text. We start by proving the Triangle Inequality, which is an important property of
absolute value.
The Triangle Inequality If and are any real numbers, then
Observe that if the numbers 
and 
are both positive or both negative, then the two
sides in the Triangle Inequality are actually equal. But if 
and 
have opposite signs, the
left side involves a subtraction and the right side does not. This makes the Triangle
Inequality seem reasonable, but we can prove it as follows.
Notice that
is always true because equals either 
or 
. The corresponding statement for is
Adding these inequalities, we get
If we now apply Properties 4 and 5 of absolute value from Appendix A (with 
replaced
by 
and by 
), we obtain
which is what we wanted to show.
Next we use the Triangle Inequality to prove the Sum Law for limits.
Sum Law If 
and 
both exist, then
PROOF Let 
be given. According to Deﬁnition 1 in Appendix D, we must ﬁnd
such that
if
Using the Triangle Inequality we can write
We will make 
less than by making each of the terms
and

But since

and so we have shown that

If 
, then the direction of the inequality (2) is reversed when we divide by :
So, taking the left-hand limit, we have
We have shown that

must be true, the only possibility is that

A convenient way of writing sums uses the Greek letter 
(capital sigma, corresponding to
our letter S) and is called sigma notation.
Deﬁnition If

With function notation, Deﬁnition 1 can be written as
Thus the symbol
indicates a summation in which the letter (called the index of sum-
mation) takes on consecutive integer values beginning with m and ending with n, that is,

Prove the formula for the sum of the ﬁrst positive integers:
SOLUTION This formula can be proved by mathematical induction (see page 84) or by the
following method used by the German mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855)
when he was ten years old.
Write the sum 
twice, once in the usual order and once in reverse order:
Adding all columns vertically, we get
On the right side there are terms, each of which is 
, so
Prove the formula for the sum of the squares of the ﬁrst positive 
integers:
SOLUTION 1 Let 
be the desired sum. We start with the telescoping sum (or collapsing
sum):

INTEGRATION OF RATIONAL FUNCTIONS BY PARTIAL FRACTIONS
A47
In this appendix we show how to integrate any rational function (a ratio of polynomials)
by expressing it as a sum of simpler fractions, called partial fractions, that we already
know how to integrate. To illustrate the method, observe that by taking the fractions
and 
to a common denominator we obtain
If we now reverse the procedure, we see how to integrate the function on the right side of
this equation:
To see how the method of partial fractions works in general, let’s consider a rational
function
where 
and 
are polynomials. It’s possible to express 
as a sum of simpler fractions
provided that the degree of 
is less than the degree of . Such a rational function is called
proper. Recall that if
where 
, then the degree of 
is and we write 
.
If 
is improper, that is, 
, then we must take the preliminary step of
dividing 
into 
(by long division) until a remainder 
is obtained such that
. The division statement is
where 
and 
are also polynomials.
As the following example illustrates, sometimes this preliminary step is all that is
required.
Find 
.
SOLUTION Since the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denomina-
tor, we ﬁrst perform the long division. This enables us to write

The next step is to factor the denominator 
as far as possible. It can be shown that
any polynomial 
can be factored as a product of linear factors (of the form 
and irreducible quadratic factors (of the form 
, where 
). For
instance, if 
, we could factor it as
The third step is to express the proper rational function
(from Equation 1) as
a sum of partial fractions of the form
A theorem in algebra guarantees that it is always possible to do this. We explain the details
for the four cases that occur.
Case I The denominator 
is a product of distinct linear factors.
This means that we can write
where no factor is repeated (and no factor is a constant multiple of another). In this case
the partial fraction theorem states that there exist constants 
such that
These constants can be determined as in the following example.
Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator,
we don’t need to divide. We factor the denominator as
Since the denominator has three distinct linear factors, the partial fraction decomposition
of the integrand (2) has the form
To determine the values of , , and , we multiply both sides of this equation by the
product of the denominators, 
, obtaining
Expanding the right side of Equation 4 and writing it in the standard form for polyno-
mials, we get

The polynomials in Equation 5 are identical, so their coefﬁcients must be equal. The
coefﬁcient of 
on the right side, 
, must equal the coefﬁcient of 
on the
left side—namely, 1. Likewise, the coefﬁcients of 
are equal and the constant terms are
equal. This gives the following system of equations for , , and :
Solving, we get 
, 
, and 
, and so
In integrating the middle term we have made the mental substitution 
, which
gives 
and 
.
Note: We can use an alternative method to ﬁnd the coefﬁcients , , and 
in Example
2. Equation 4 is an identity; it is true for every value of . Let’s choose values of 
that
simplify the equation. If we put 
in Equation 4, then the second and third terms on
the right side vanish and the equation then becomes 
, or 
. Likewise, 
gives 
and 
gives 
, so 
and 
. (You may object
that Equation 3 is not valid for 
, , or 
, so why should Equation 4 be valid for those
values? In fact, Equation 4 is true for all values of , even 
, , and 
. See Exer-
cise 45 for the reason.)
Find 
, where 
.
SOLUTION The method of partial fractions gives
and therefore
Using the method of the preceding note, we put 
in this equation and get
, so 
. If we put 
, we get

In order to integrate the second term we split it into two parts:

We evaluate the second integral by means of Formula 9 with 
:
Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Since the degree of the numerator is not less than the degree of the denomina-
tor, we ﬁrst divide and obtain
Notice that the quadratic 
is irreducible because its discriminant is
. This means it can’t be factored, so we don’t need to use the 
partial fraction technique.
To integrate the given function we complete the square in the denominator:

41. One method of slowing the growth of an insect population
without using pesticides is to introduce into the population 
a number of sterile males that mate with fertile females 
but produce no offspring. If

female insects in a population, 
the number of sterile males
introduced each generation, and the population’s natural
growth rate, then the female population is related to time by

Polar coordinates offer an alternative way of locating points in a plane. They are useful
because, for certain types of regions and curves, polar coordinates provide very simple
descriptions and equations. The principal applications of this idea occur in multivariable cal-
culus: the evaluation of double integrals and the derivation of Kepler’s laws of planetary
motion.
H
Polar Coordinates
A coordinate system represents a point in the plane by an ordered pair of numbers called
coordinates. Usually we use Cartesian coordinates, which are directed distances from two
perpendicular axes. Here we describe a coordinate system introduced by Newton, called
the polar coordinate system, which is more convenient for many purposes.
We choose a point in the plane that is called the pole (or origin) and is labeled . Then
we draw a ray (half-line) starting at 
called the polar axis. This axis is usually drawn hor-
izontally to the right and corresponds to the positive -axis in Cartesian coordinates.
If 
is any other point in the plane, let be the distance from 
to 
and let 
be the
angle (usually measured in radians) between the polar axis and the line 
as in Figure 1.
Then the point 
is represented by the ordered pair 
and ,
are called polar coordi-
nates of . We use the convention that an angle is positive if measured in the counterclock-

We extend the meaning of polar coordinates 
to the case in which is negative by
agreeing that, as in Figure 2, the points 
and 
lie on the same line through 
and at the same distance 
from , but on opposite sides of . If 
, the point 
lies in the same quadrant as ; if

pole. Notice that

(d)
SOLUTION The points are plotted in Figure 3. In part (d) the point 
is located
three units from the pole in the fourth quadrant because the angle 
is in the second
quadrant and 
is negative.
In the Cartesian coordinate system every point has only one representation, but in the
polar coordinate system each point has many representations. For instance, the point
in Example 1(a) could be written as 
or 
or 
.
(See Figure 4.)
In fact, since a complete counterclockwise rotation is given by an angle 2 , the point
represented by polar coordinates 
is also represented by
where is any integer.
The connection between polar and Cartesian coordinates can be seen from Figure 5, in
which the pole corresponds to the origin and the polar axis coincides with the positive 
-axis. If the point has Cartesian coordinates 
and polar coordinates 
, then, from
the ﬁgure, we have

Although Equations 1 were deduced from Figure 5, which illustrates the case where
and 
, these equations are valid for all values of and 
(See the gen-
eral deﬁnition of 
and 
in Appendix C.)
Equations 1 allow us to ﬁnd the Cartesian coordinates of a point when the polar coor-
dinates are known. To ﬁnd and 
when and are known, we use the equations
which can be deduced from Equations 1 or simply read from Figure 5.
Convert the point 
from polar to Cartesian coordinates.
SOLUTION Since 
and 
, Equations 1 give
Therefore the point is 
in Cartesian coordinates.
Represent the point with Cartesian coordinates 
in terms of polar
coordinates.
SOLUTION If we choose to be positive, then Equations 2 give
Since the point 
lies in the fourth quadrant, we can choose 
or
. Thus one possible answer is 
; another is 
.
Note: Equations 2 do not uniquely determine 
when 
and 
are given because, as 
increases through the interval 
, each value of 
occurs twice. Therefore, in
converting from Cartesian to polar coordinates, it’s not good enough just to ﬁnd 
and 
that satisfy Equations 2. As in Example 3, we must choose 
so that the point 
lies in
the correct quadrant.
The graph of a polar equation
, or more generally 
, consists of all
points 
that have at least one polar representation 
whose coordinates satisfy the
equation.
What curve is represented by the polar equation 
?
SOLUTION The curve consists of all points 
with 
. Since represents the dis-
tance from the point to the pole, the curve 
represents the circle with center 
and
radius . In general, the equation 
represents a circle with center 
and radius

(b) To convert the given equation into a Cartesian equation we use Equations 1 and 2.

Sketch the curve 
.
SOLUTION Instead of plotting points as in Example 6, we ﬁrst sketch the graph of
in Cartesian coordinates in Figure 10 by shifting the sine curve up one
unit. This enables us to read at a glance the values of that correspond to increasing
values of . For instance, we see that as 
increases from 0 to 
, (the distance from )
increases from 1 to 2, so we sketch the corresponding part of the polar curve in Figure
11(a). As
increases from 
to , Figure 10 shows that decreases from 2 to 1, so 
we sketch the next part of the curve as in Figure 11(b). As 
increases from 
to 
, 
decreases from 1 to 0 as shown in part (c). Finally, as 
increases from 
to 
, 
increases from 0 to 1 as shown in part (d). If we let 
increase beyond 
or decrease
beyond 0, we would simply retrace our path. Putting together the parts of the curve from
Figure 11(a)–(d), we sketch the complete curve in part (e). It is called a cardioid
because it’s shaped like a heart.
Sketch the curve 
.
SOLUTION As in Example 7, we ﬁrst sketch 
, 
, in Cartesian coor-
dinates in Figure 12. As 
increases from 0 to 
, Figure 12 shows that decreases
from 1 to 0 and so we draw the corresponding portion of the polar curve in Figure 13
(indicated by !). As 
increases from 
to 
, goes from 0 to 
. This means that
the distance from 
increases from 0 to 1, but instead of being in the ﬁrst quadrant this
portion of the polar curve (indicated by @) lies on the opposite side of the pole in the
third quadrant. The remainder of the curve is drawn in a similar fashion, with the arrows
and numbers indicating the order in which the portions are traced out. The resulting
curve has four loops and is called a four-leaved rose.

POLAR COORDINATES
When we sketch polar curves it is sometimes helpful to take advantage of symmetry.
The following three rules are explained by Figure 14.
(a) If a polar equation is unchanged when 
is replaced by 
, the curve is symmetric
about the polar axis.
(b) If the equation is unchanged when is replaced by 
, or when 
is replaced by
, the curve is symmetric about the pole. (This means that the curve remains
unchanged if we rotate it through 180° about the origin.)
(c) If the equation is unchanged when 
is replaced by 
, the curve is symmetric
about the vertical line 
.
The curves sketched in Examples 6 and 8 are symmetric about the polar axis, since
. The curves in Examples 7 and 8 are symmetric about 
because
and 
. The four-leaved rose is also symmetric
about the pole. These symmetry properties could have been used in sketching the curves.
For instance, in Example 6 we need only have plotted points for 
and then
reﬂected about the polar axis to obtain the complete circle.
Tangents to Polar Curves
To ﬁnd a tangent line to a polar curve 
we regard 
as a parameter and write its
parametric equations as
Then, using the method for ﬁnding slopes of parametric curves (Equation 3.4.7) and the
Product Rule, we have
We locate horizontal tangents by ﬁnding the points where 
(provided that
). Likewise, we locate vertical tangents at the points where 
(pro-
vided that 
).

derive it. For instance, in Example 9 we could have written
Then we have

Graphing Polar Curves with Graphing Devices
Although it’s useful to be able to sketch simple polar curves by hand, we need to use a
graphing calculator or computer when we are faced with a curve as complicated as the ones
shown in Figures 16 and 17.
Some graphing devices have commands that enable us to graph polar curves directly.
With other machines we need to convert to parametric equations ﬁrst. In this case we take
the polar equation 
and write its parametric equations as
Some machines require that the parameter be called rather than .
Graph the curve 
.
SOLUTION Let’s assume that our graphing device doesn’t have a built-in polar graphing
command. In this case we need to work with the corresponding parametric equations,
which are
In any case we need to determine the domain for . So we ask ourselves: How many
complete rotations are required until the curve starts to repeat itself? If the answer 
is , then

. Therefore we will graph the entire curve if we specify that 
. 
Switching from 
to , we have the equations
and Figure 18 shows the resulting curve. Notice that this rose has 16 loops.
Investigate the family of polar curves given by 
. How
does the shape change as changes? (These curves are called limaçons, after a French
word for snail, because of the shape of the curves for certain values of .)
SOLUTION Figure 19 shows computer-drawn graphs for various values of . For 
there is a loop that decreases in size as decreases. When 
the loop disappears and
the curve becomes the cardioid that we sketched in Example 7. For between and the
cardioid’s cusp is smoothed out and becomes a “dimple.” When decreases from to ,
the limaçon is shaped like an oval. This oval becomes more circular as 
, and when
the curve is just the circle 
.
The remaining parts of Figure 19 show that as becomes negative, the shapes change
in reverse order. In fact, these curves are reﬂections about the horizontal axis of the cor-
responding curves with positive .c

APPENDIX H
POLAR COORDINATES
In this section we develop the formula for the area of a region whose boundary is given by
a polar equation. We need to use the formula for the area of a sector of a circle
where, as in Figure 1, 
is the radius and 
is the radian measure of the central angle.
Formula 1 follows from the fact that the area of a sector is proportional to its central angle:
.
Let 
be the region, illustrated in Figure 2, bounded by the polar curve 
and by the rays 
and 
, where 
is a positive continuous function and where
. We divide the interval 
into subintervals with endpoints 
, 
, 
, . . . , 
and equal width 
. The rays 
then divide 
into 
smaller regions
with central angle 
. If we choose 
in the th subinterval 
, then
the area 
of the th region is approximated by the area of the sector of a circle with cen-
tral angle 
and radius 
. (See Figure 3.)
Thus from Formula 1 we have
and so an approximation to the total area 
of 
is
It appears from Figure 3 that the approximation in (2) improves as 
. But the sums
in (2) are Riemann sums for the function 
, so
It therefore appears plausible (and can in fact be proved) that the formula for the area 
of
the polar region 
is
Formula 3 is often written as
with the understanding that 
. Note the similarity between Formulas 1 and 4.
When we apply Formula 3 or 4 it is helpful to think of the area as being swept out by
a rotating ray through 
that starts with angle and ends with angle .b

Find the area enclosed by one loop of the four-leaved rose 
.
SOLUTION The curve 
was sketched in Example 8 in Section H.1. Notice from
Figure 4 that the region enclosed by the right loop is swept out by a ray that rotates from
to 
. Therefore Formula 4 gives
We could evaluate the integral using Formula 64 in the Table of Integrals. Or, as in
Section 5.7, we could use the identity 
to write
Find the area of the region that lies inside the circle 
and out-
side the cardioid 
.
SOLUTION The cardioid (see Example 7 in Section H.1) and the circle are sketched in
Figure 5 and the desired region is shaded. The values of 
and 
in Formula 4 are deter-
mined by ﬁnding the points of intersection of the two curves. They intersect when
, which gives 
, so 
, 
. The desired area can be
found by subtracting the area inside the cardioid between 
and 
from
the area inside the circle from 
to 
. Thus
Since the region is symmetric about the vertical axis 
, we can write
[because 
]
Example 2 illustrates the procedure for ﬁnding the area of the region bounded by two
polar curves. In general, let 
be a region, as illustrated in Figure 6, that is bounded by
curves with polar equations 
, 
, 
, and 
, where 
and 
. The area 
of 
is found by subtracting the area inside 
from the area inside 
, so using Formula 3 we have
|
CAUTION The fact that a single point has many representations in polar coordinates
sometimes makes it difﬁcult to ﬁnd all the points of intersection of two polar curves. For
instance, it is obvious from Figure 5 that the circle and the cardioid have three points of
intersection; however, in Example 2 we solved the equations

and 
. The origin is also a point of inter-
section, but we can’t ﬁnd it by solving the equations of the curves because the origin has
no single representation in polar coordinates that satisﬁes both equations. Notice that, when
represented as 
or 
, the origin satisﬁes 
and so it lies on the circle;
when represented as 
, it satisﬁes 
and so it lies on the cardioid.
Think of two points moving along the curves as the parameter value 
increases from 0 to
. On one curve the origin is reached at 
and 
; on the other curve it is reached
at 
. The points don’t collide at the origin because they reach the origin at differ-
ent times, but the curves intersect there nonetheless.
Thus, to ﬁnd all points of intersection of two polar curves, it is recommended that you
draw the graphs of both curves. It is especially convenient to use a graphing calculator or
computer to help with this task.

DISCOVERY PROJECT
Conic Sections in Polar Coordinates
In this project we give a uniﬁed treatment of all three types of conic sections in terms of a focus
and directrix. We will see that if we place the focus at the origin, then a conic section has a simple
polar equation. In Chapter 10 we will use the polar equation of an ellipse to derive Kepler’s laws
of planetary motion.
Let 
be a ﬁxed point (called the focus) and be a ﬁxed line (called the directrix) in a plane.
Let be a ﬁxed positive number (called the eccentricity). Let 
be the set of all points 
in the
plane such that 
(that is, the ratio of the distance from 
to the distance from is the constant ). Notice that if
the eccentricity is 
, then 
and so the given condition simply becomes the
deﬁnition of a parabola as given in Appendix B.
1. If we place the focus 
at the origin and the directrix parallel to the -axis and 
units to
the right, then the directrix has equation 
and is perpendicular to the polar axis. If
the point 
has polar coordinates 
, use Figure 1 to show that 
2. By converting the polar equation in Problem 1 to rectangular coordinates, show that the
curve 
is an ellipse if 
. (See Appendix B for a discussion of ellipses.)

SOLUTION Using the quadratic formula, we have
We observe that the solutions of the equation in Example 3 are complex conjugates of

coefﬁcients , , and are always complex conjugates. (If is real, 
, so is its own

We have seen that if we allow complex numbers as solutions, then every quadratic equa-
tion has a solution. More generally, it is true that every polynomial equation
of degree at least one has a solution among the complex numbers. This fact is known as
the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and was proved by Gauss.

COMPLEX NUMBERS
De Moivre’s Theorem can also be used to ﬁnd the th roots of complex numbers. An 
th root of the complex number is a complex number 
such that
Writing these two numbers in trigonometric form as
and using De Moivre’s Theorem, we get
The equality of these two complex numbers shows that
and
From the fact that sine and cosine have period 
it follows that
Thus
Since this expression gives a different value of 
for 
, 1, 2, . . . , 
, we have the
following.
Roots of a Complex Number Let 
and let be a positive
integer. Then has the distinct th roots
where 
, 1, 2, . . . , 
.
Notice that each of the th roots of has modulus 
. Thus all the th roots
of lie on the circle of radius 
in the complex plane. Also, since the argument of each
successive th root exceeds the argument of the previous root by 
, we see that the 
th roots of are equally spaced on this circle.
Find the six sixth roots of 
and graph these roots in the complex
plane.

All these points lie on the circle of radius 
as shown in Figure 9.
Complex Exponentials
We also need to give a meaning to the expression 
when 
is a complex num-
ber. The theory of inﬁnite series as developed in Chapter 8 can be extended to the case
where the terms are complex numbers. Using the Taylor series for 
(8.7.11) as our guide,
we deﬁne
and it turns out that this complex exponential function has the same properties as the real
exponential function. In particular, it is true that

31.
If 
, the graph has three humps: two minimum points and
a maximum point. These humps get ﬂatter as c increases until at
two of the humps disappear and there is only one mini-
mum point. This single hump then moves to the right and
approaches the origin as c increases.
33. The hump gets larger and moves to the right.
35. If 
, the loop is to the right of the origin; if 
, the loop
is to the left. The closer c is to 0, the larger the loop.
