Preface
Preface
There are many books concerned with statistical theory. This is not one of them. This is a practical book. It is aimed 
at people who need to understand statistics, but not develop it as a subject. The typical reader might be a postgraduate 
student in health, life or social science who has no knowledge of statistics, but needs to use quantitative methods in their 
studies. Students who are engaged in qualitative studies will need to read and understand quantitative studies when they 
do their literature reviews, this book may be of use to them.
This text is based on lectures given to students of nursing, midwifery, social work, probation, criminology, allied health, 
podiatry at undergraduate to doctoral level. However the examples employed, all from health, life and social sciences, 
should be understandable to any reader.
There is virtually no theory in this text, almost no mathematics (a bit of simple arithmetic is about as far as it gets). I do 
not give every statistical test, nor do I examine every restriction of any test. There are texts, good ones, that do all of these 
things. For example Field’s (2009) text is excellent and gives a fuller treatment, but his book is 820 pages long!
All books contain errors, or explanations that are not clear. If you note any email me on danthony@talktalk.net and I 
will fix them.

Designing questionnaires and surveys
1	 Designing questionnaires and 
surveys
Key points
• 
A well designed questionnaire is more likely to be answered
• 
A well designed questionnaire is more likely to give valid data
• 
Constructing your sample from the population is crucial
At the end of this unit you should be able to:
• 
Create a sampling strategy
• 
Design a questionnaire
Introduction
In this chapter we will learn how to create a questionnaire. Questionnaire design is well covered in many web sites (see 
list at the end for a few examples) and any good basic research text (there are many). This chapter presents an example 
and asks you to work on it to produce a questionnaire. 
The main example we will use will be infection control in hospitals. There is considerable evidence that single rooms in 
hospitals are associated with fewer hospital acquired infections. The reasons are fairly obvious. However what proportion 
of hospital beds are in single rooms in the UK? It turns out that this was not known, and in 2004 I conducted a study to 
find out.
Suppose we want to find out how many single rooms there are in UK hospitals. What would be the best way to do this?
Surveys
One way is to send a survey instrument out to hospitals in the UK requesting this information. But to which hospitals, 
and to whom in each hospital? 
If you look at www.statpac.com/surveys/sampling.htm you can see several ways to pick a sample. Let us consider each 
in turn:-
Random sampling: We could put all the names of all hospital trusts in a bag and take out the number required to make 
our sample. In practice we are more likely to select them with a random number generator, but in essence this is the same 
thing. Since the trusts are being selected randomly there should be no bias, so (for example) all the sites should not be 
in England, but a similar proportion in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Designing questionnaires and surveys
Systematic sampling: If we chose every tenth (say) record in our database this would probably not introduce a bias, unless 
there was some intrinsic pattern in the database, for example if the Welsh trusts were first, eleventh, twenty first etc. we 
would end up with a sample biased to Welsh sites. 
Stratified sampling: To avoid bias we could split the population into strata and then sample from these randomly. For 
example if we wanted small, medium and large hospitals in our sample we could have size of hospital as the three strata 
and ensure we got required amounts of each.
Convenience sampling: We could use hospitals we have access to easily. We could use those in the East Midlands of the 
UK (for example).
Snowball sampling: We might use our convenience sample of the East Midlands and ask respondents to give us other 
contacts.
In this case, provided we do not introduce bias it is not critical which method we employ. We can rule out two methods. 
Convenience is not helpful here as we want a national picture of single rooms. Snowball sampling could introduce bias 
as the contacts known by a trust are not likely to be random, and it is not necessary as there are mailing lists of hospital 
trusts obtainable. Systematic is probably not going to be problematic as there is no reason to assume every nth contact 
will be related in any way. However it is not necessary, so why risk the possible bias? These three sampling methods are 
useful, but not here. Convenience sampling might be employed by a student on a limited budget, who realises the sample 
is likely to be biased, and states this as a limitation. Systematic sampling might be employed in a study of out-patient 
patients, where every tenth or twentieth patient was  invited for interview until one got the number required (say thirty). 
You could sample the first thirty, but this might get you all patients in one morning clinic, which may not be generalisable. 
So random or stratified sampling are probably the way forward in this case.
While we often for practical reasons have to select a sample from a population, sometimes there is no need. In our case 
there are about 500 hospital trusts in the UK (figures vary as trusts are not static entities but merge and fragment from 
time to time) in the database at our disposal. Each ward manager will know how many single rooms are in his or her 
ward. But if we intended to contact every ward in every hospital then we would be sending out tens of thousands of 
questionnaires. This would be very expensive. However if we sent the questionnaire to the estates department of each 
hospital then we could possibly send out a questionnaire to every trust. This is a census study as every subject is included. 
In that case there may be no need to create a sample, or in other words the population is the sample. This is because a 
postal survey is cheap, and we could therefore afford to send a questionnaire to every trust. Entry of data for only a few 
variables would also be relatively fast and therefore cheap. 
Questionnaire design: data variables
To get valid and reliable data we need a well designed research instrument, in this case a questionnaire. We could send 
out a survey with one question on it, How may single rooms are in your hospital? However this is insufficient, we need to 
know how many beds in total to work out the percentage, so at least one other question is needed, How many beds are 
in your hospital?

Designing questionnaires and surveys
However there are several other related issues which we may want to explore. For example single rooms are probably 
better than other ward designs in terms of infection control, but bays (4-6 beds in a room or area) might be better than 
Nightingale wards (30 or so beds in one long ward). We might therefore ask about the different types of ward designs. 
We are more likely to get responses if the questionnaire is easy to fill in. A tick list is quick and simple. We could have a 
list of all ward designs and allow the respondent to just tick the ones in use.
But we do not know every type of ward design, so while a tick list is useful we might miss data. We could add an extra 
category “other” and invite the respondent to fill it in.
We might wonder why single rooms are not used in all hospitals for all patients. There are countries where single rooms 
are the norm, but not the UK. So finally we are interested in the views of respondents on the utility of single rooms. Is 
it for example the case that financial constraints limit the use of single rooms, or could it be that single rooms are not 
seen as optimal. For example are Nightingale wards thought to be superior in terms of observation of patients, or patient 
communication?
Layout of the questionnaire  
The same items laid out badly will get fewer responses than one laid out well. The design of the questionnaire is important. 
If it looks professional it is more likely to be responded to. 
Sometimes we want precise answers, sometimes we are interested in ranges of values. If we do not care about someone’s 
exact age, we could give ranges of ages to tick. This may be important if exact data could in principle identify subjects, 
but data in groups might not. For example if I ask for a person’s age, gender and ethnic group there may only be one 
person of a given ethnicity, gender and age. This may make the respondent less willing to complete it, and has obvious 
ethical implications.
Simple things like lining up tick boxes in a question aid the respondent. Consider the layout of following segments of a 
questionnaire on following pages:-
Design 1

First Name …………..  Family name ……………… Number single rooms  ………..	
	
Total number of beds in hospital ……………… Postcode ………………

Designing questionnaires and surveys
Which of the above four questionnaires would you fill in? How could it be improved upon? Which gives more precise 
data? How precise do the data need to be? Personally I would use design four as it is neater than designs one and two, 
and has more precise information than design three, and has a space for qualitative comments.
Below are some activities that you may use in (say) a course. There are no definitive answers so I have not given correct 
answers in this text. In other chapters I use the term exercises (which do have correct answers).
Activity 1
You interview some managers in the local trust and also conduct a few focus groups of nurses. You ask them about 
ward design, and they all tell you single rooms are a bad idea because of safety issues, and Nightingale wards are best for 
observation, and patients prefer them because they can communicate with other patients and be more involved. You now 
want to find out what patients think about this. Create a survey questionnaire that asks them about the following issues:-
1.	 Can nurses observe me?
2.	 Is privacy a problem?
3.	 Is lighting adequate?
4.	 Is the ward too noisy?
5.	 Is the bed space (bed, curtains etc.) pleasant?
Now think about the following issues:-
1.	 Would patients from certain minority ethnic groups have different views than (say) the majority white 
population?
2.	 Do older patients have different attitudes to younger ones?
3.	 Are men and women the same in their views?
4.	 Are patients in different types of ward likely to be the same in terms of attitude to ward layout (think of a very 
ill elderly cancer patient or a fit young man with a hernia being repaired)?
Create some variables to add to the questionnaire to gather data that could explore these issues.
While the question of ward design was explored with staff in one area, we want to know what patients across the NHS in 
the UK think. I.e. we are interested in national (UK) not local views. However it is possible there are regional differences. 
What variable/s would be needed to identify the area where patients come from so we could explore these?
Finally what type of bed space do they have? Are they in a single room, a bay or a Nightingale ward? Create a variable 
that captures these data.

Designing questionnaires and surveys
Activity 2
How are you going to conduct a survey of the patients using the questionnaire you designed above in activity 1? What sort 
of survey will it be? Will it be a census survey, or will you need to sample? If you sample how will you ensure your data 
are generalisable? Remember this is a national survey. If you sample, how big a sample will enable you to be reasonably 
sure you have valid data? How big a sample can you afford (what resources do you have)? How will you deliver the 
questionnaire? What ethical procedures will you need to address prior to conducting the survey?
Activity 3
We want to do a survey of students on an online course. We want to know the following:-
1.	 Do students value the online course?
2.	 Which components (discussion board, email or course notes) are most useful?
3.	 Have the students previous experience of using email or the Web?
4.	 How confident are the students in terms of their computing skills?
However we also want to explore whether any of the following are relevant in student attitudes:-
• 
Ethnic group
• 
Age
• 
Gender

Starting SPSS
SPSS was renamed PASW Statistics in 2009, but most people continues to  call it SPSS. In 2010 it was renamed to SPSS: 
An IBM Company. In this text all mention to SPSS means either earlier SPSS versions or PASW version 18 or SPSS: An 
IBM Company. I am using PASW version 18 throughout in this text.
You may find other free books helpful, and to start with Tyrell (2009) is useful.
When you start SPSS (how this is done may vary, for example on Windows may select it from a menu of all programs, but 
there could be an icon on the desktop) you will be asked what you want to do, the default option is to open a datafile. You 
can select one of these options (one of them is the tutorial), but if you hit ESC you will get the screen as s een in Figure 1.

Data entry in SPSS
Note there is a data view, where you can enter or edit data, and a variable view here you create new variables or edit existing 
ones. You can simply enter data (numbers, dates, names etc.) into the data window. If you try (for example) entering an 
age of a subject, say 25, you will find the data is changed to 25.00.
Figure 2: Entering data
If you switch to variable view by clicking on the tab labelled Variable View, you will see the s creen as in Figure 3. Note 
that the variable name is VAR0001, it is defined as a number and given a default value of length 8, 2 decimal places and 
column size of 8. Most of this is suboptimal, it would be better for the name to be something like “Age” and since we do 
not use decimal places for ages, and most people live less than millions of years, a width of 3 (ages of 100 are possible) 
and no decimal places. The column width is simply how wide the display is on the data tab.

I can now add some new variables, see Figure 18. Here I add two string variables which identify names of subjects (though 
in many studies you would not want to do this for reasons of confidentiality) and one for gender.

Figure 19: Gender as string variable
I have used a lot of screen dumps to demonstrate what SPSS looks like in practice, but I will start now using the convention 
of Pull down -> Further Pull down, to indicate interactive commands in SPSS, where the underlined letter means you 
can use the Alt key combined with that letter to get that dialogue box (if you prefer keyboard strokes to the mouse). So 
for example the sequence shown in Figure 20 is Analyse -> Descriptive Statistics -> Frequencies. In this chapter I will 
continue to show the screen dumps for all interactions but in later chapters I not show the initial menus and pull downs 
where this is not necessary.

Figure 21: Frequencies dialogue box
The Output window contains the frequency table of gender, and above it is shown how many valid cases there are (i.e. 
for how many subjects we have information on gender, here all of them). Note there are more than two types of gender 
since in a string variable capitalised (e.g. Male) is different to lower or upper case, and one (Mail) is misspelt. To avoid 
these data errors it is better to code nominal data (see next chapter), and best to use numbers as codes. For example 
Male=0, Female=1. However how would you remember which code relates to which gender? You can use value labels in 
the Variable tab, see Figure 23 and the dialogue box Figure 24, where I have entered Male as 0 already and about to enter 
Female as 1, what I need to do next is click Add to add this value, then OK to place both value labels into the variable.

In this chapter I am going to consider a dataset I created for a small study of the attitudes of students to online learning. 
For details see the Appendix Datasets used in this text, though I repeat most of the information in this chapter as it is 
your first dataset. In later chapters I will just tell you to open a dataset, and you will find all details of the variables in the 
Appendix. All the datafiles are downloadable from the BookBoon website.
I gave out a survey questionnaire (see Figure 28 ) over the next two pages (I gave this out as a single sheet double-sided) 
and entered the data into SPSS.  
This survey was conducted in 2005, when some of my nursing students were not very computer literate, many were mature 
students who were re-entering the education system after many years. I could have used an online method, however I 
wanted to know about students who would NOT engage with online learning and using IT, so I needed to use a paper 
based survey.

and variance.

Introducing descriptive statistics
Data types.
• 
Nominal variables are those whose outcomes are categorical, not meaningfully put into numbers (other than 
coded). For example gender has two outcomes male and female, but while you can code males as 1 and females 
as 2, it does not follow that females are twice male. SPSS calls variables of this type Nominal.
• 
Ordinal variables are those that are naturally ordered. For example Likert  scales (Likert, 1932) are those that 
allow a subject to give a response typically something like “strongly agree” through “agree” and “disagree” to 
“strongly disagree”. Clearly a response of “agree” is between “strongly agree” and “disagree”; i.e. there is an order. 
Thus if “strongly agree” is coded 4 it is more then agree coded 3 and not merely labelled differently. However 
the distance between “strongly agree” and “agree” is not obviously the same as between “agree” and “disagree”. 
SPSS calls variables of this type Ordinal
• Interval/ratio variables are where the numbers have even more meaning, for example age where the difference 
between consecutive numbers is always the same. For example a person aged 20 is not just older than one of 
19, they are one year older. Ratio variables have in addition an absolute zero. You cannot have negative height 
or age, these are ratio data. You can have negative temperature in Celsius, these are interval data but not ratio. 
SPSS calls variables of either of these types Scalar.
N.B. SPSS allows you to define variables as Scalar, Ordinal or Nominal, however its type checking is not always helpful, 
and I have sometimes to define an Ordinal variable as Scalar (for example) before SPPS Graph Builder will allow me to 
create a graph using such ordinal data.

Introducing descriptive statistics
Measures of central tendency
These describe the middle of a distribution of data, and the three commonly used measures are mean, median and mode. 
The mean is what most people think of as the average. It is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.  The 
mode is the most common  value and the median is the value in the middle of the distribution. If we had eleven PhD 
students with the following ages:-
22, 22, 22,, 22, 22, 23, 23, 23, 23, 30, 43
Then the mean is   (22+22+22+22+22+23+23+23+23+30+43)/11 = 25. The median is 23 (shown in bold) as it is the sixth 
value of eleven in ascending order. The mode is 22 as there are five students with this age.
Which measure we use depends on the question to be answered. For example if you wanted the “average” wage earned 
in the UK you might think the mean is a good measure, and this was in 2008 £26,020, and for full time workers £31,323. 
However this does not imply half the full time workers in the UK get £31K or more. The median (also called 50th 
percentile) is the figure for the mid-point, and this is £20,801 or £25,123 for full time workers (source http://news.bbc.
co.uk/1/hi/8151355.stm). The median is the salary below which 50% of people earn, and above which the other 50% earn, 
it splits the salaries into two equal numbers of people. The reason for this difference between mean and median is that a 
few very well paid people push the mean value up, but this has little effect on the people in the middle of the distribution. 
If you want to know the middle earning worker then the median is better than the mean (and this is what is typically 
used in statistics on salaries). The problem with salaries is that they are skewed, with a lot of poorly paid people and a 
few very highly paid people. 
Variability
Data may be clustered tightly around the mean value or very spread out. Variance is measured by essentially adding 
together the differences between the actual salaries and the mean (in fact the squared differences are used, so a value 
below the mean and one above the mean do not cancel each other out).  It is defined the mean of the sum of the squared 
deviation of each value from the mean. 
The variance of the students’ ages above would be (where the symbol ∑ means sum of all values and n is the number of 
subjects)
∑(value-mean)2/n
((22-25)2 +(22-25)2 + (22-25)2 + (22-25)2 + (22-25)2+ (23-25)2 + (23-25)2 + (23-25)2 + (23-25)2 + (30-25)2 + (43-25)2)/11
= (5 * 32 + 4 * 22 +  52 + 182)/11
  =(45 + 16 + 25 + 324)/11
=410/11
=37.3

Introducing descriptive statistics
However this is only correct if our sample is the whole population, if it is a sample drawn from the population (typically 
is) then we divide not by the number of observations n but by n-1
Then variance is 410/10 = 41
Note here the few values that are very different contribute massively to the variance, the one age of 45 contributes more 
than the rest of the ages put together. So variance is sensitive to skewed samples. 
For an example of how variance might be used, in a very equal society most people would have a salary close to the mean. 
Variance would be small. In an unequal society with many poor and rich people earning respectively much less or much 
more than the mean, variance would be high. In practice the standard deviation is often used which is the square root 
of the variance. As we noted above the variance, and therefore the standard deviation is not a good measure in some 
distributions (salary is one such case) and a better measure of variability of data is the inter-quartile range. This is the 
difference between the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile. In salaries this would mean finding the salary below which 
25% of the population earn (25th percentile) and that above which only 25% earn (75th percentile).
Normal distributions
A normal distribution is characterised by large numbers of values in the middle near the mean, and decreasing numbers 
as one gets further from the mean in either direction. This gives a bell shaped curve. In a perfectly normal distribution 
mean, median and mode are all the same. A roughly (fictional) normal distribution is seen in Figure 29. In a normally 
distributed sample about two thirds of values lie within one standard deviation, and about 95% within two standard 
deviations, and almost all within three standard deviations. So here with a mean of about 3.5 and a standard deviation 
of about 1.0, almost all values lie between 1.5 and 6.5, and 95% between 2.5 and 5.5. 
A related concept to standard deviation is standard error. Whereas standard deviation tells us about the range of values, 
standard error informs us about the range of mean values of different samples drawn from the population.  A common 
error is to confuse the two, and as standard error is always less (usually much less) than standard deviation this can be 
problematic.
 The perfect normal curve has been superimposed on the histogram (I explain histograms later, but they show the frequency 
of subjects that lie within ranges of calues, so here numbers of subjects in ascending ranges of blood glucose) , the actual 
values are not quite in line with this, but are close enough to be seen as normally distributed. The main thing to note is 
very few people have either very low or high blood sugar (fortunately) and most values bunch in the middle.

The data
I was interested in how the students rated an online course. Thus I asked them to tell me how useful each component 
of the course was from very useful to useless. I also collected data on demographics such as gender, age, ethnic group. I 
obtained 151 replies. But how do I show my results to (say) the teaching team that gives the course? I could let them see 
all of the 151 questionnaires, but this would not be practical or even very useful. For the tutors would have too much 
information, and not necessarily be able to draw out the main points. 
Descriptive statistics
The role of descriptive statistics is to reduce the information to manageable proportions; it is to summarise data in a 
meaningful way.
A simple example is a frequency table. A frequency table counts the number of subjects that have a particular attribute. 
For example gender has two possible outcomes, male and female.

The first column with a heading is frequency, it shows you how many stated they were female (133) and male (17) making 
150 in total. However I had 151 replies. For some reason I did not have a response for gender from one student, probably 
they had not filled in this part of the questionnaire. This is shown as “missing”. Then there is a column for percent, showing 
88.1% are female, and 11.3% male, and 0.7% did not state gender. Of those who did answer, 88.7% were female, and this 
is shown in “valid percent” i.e. the percentage once missing values are removed. In this case as so few data are missing, 
there is not much difference between the columns.
Let us look at another variable, that of nationality, see Table 3.

There are more possible values for this variable. Note that there are many more missing data. You may want to ponder 
why many students did not give their nationality. However clearly there is a big difference in the columns percent and 
valid percent. It is clearly more meaningful to say about 96% of those who stated their nationality were British than to 
say about 76% of all responses were from those who said they were British. Of course we do not know if the 31 missing 
values were also largely British, and would need to be careful in interpreting these results. 
We could now look at age employing a frequency table, see Table 4.

This is trickier, as there are many more ages than either gender or nationality. Again some students did not give their 
age. I will look at the valid percent column. You will note the final column gives a cumulative percent. Thus 0.7% are 17, 
15.8% are 18, but adding these gives16.5% who are 18 or younger. This becomes useful as we can immediately see 66.9% 
(or over two thirds) are 30 or younger, and 92.1% are no older than 40.

Yet another way to view age is with mean and standard deviation. Using Analyze -> Descriptives -> Frequencies  and 
then entering in the variable age gives the output in Figure 33. The mean is the average value, and may differ from the 
median. Here is does, the mean is in the later twenties.  The standard deviation is of limited value in this set of data.

A more useful estimate of variability for these data is the inter-quartile range, which is where the middle 50% of data lie. 
You can get this and other values using Analyze -> Descriptive Statistics -> Explore and putting age into the Dependent 
List, see Figure 34. You will get output as shown in Table 5. The median is shown as 23. Thus we can see that the typical 
student is young (median 23) and half of all students are in a 14 year (inter-quartile) range.

Additional items include 95% confidence interval - where we expect the “real” mean to lie, since this is a mean of a sample 
of the population, not the population itself and the 5% trimmed mean – the mean once the top and bottom 5% of values 
have been removed, i.e. removing outliers that can distort the mean.  Skewness measures  how skewed data are, in a 
normal distributions this should be zero, and positive skew means there is a larger tail of values on the right than the left 
of the histogram, and negative is the opposite. Here with a positive skew there is a skew towards older students. Kurtosis 
measures how peaked the histogram is, with high kurtosis having a high peak and low kurtosis a low one. In a normal 
distribution kurtosis is three, but it is often reported as excess kurtosis which is kurtosis-3 or zero. Kurtosis is not very 
important in statistics, but skewness is. To see if skewness is a problem check whether the value for skewness is within 
the range of minus to plus twice the standard error of skewness. Here it is, as 0.819 is way out of the range +/- 0.512 so 
the distribution is significantly skewed and can be considered not normally distributed.

as the interface changes between some  versions, and there have been other changes at each version (though not very 
substantial in the things we are considering). The interface for creating graphs changed massively after version 16, but 
there is a legacy option for those familiar with the older graph interface.

Create barcharts (including with error bars), histograms, boxplots and scatterplots.
Introduction
I introduced descriptive statistics in chapter three. Here I show you how to use similar information to create graphs.
Graphics interface for SPSS
Some people like to see data in tables, some prefer graphs.  In some cases it is not crucial which you use, so nationality 
is perfectly well shown either in a table, or (as below) in a bar chart. In other cases graphs are better than tables, so while 
the frequency table is meaningful for age, maybe a better way to show the data is in a graph. The one that is useful here 
is not the bar chart. Bar charts are good for nominal data and sometimes ordinal data but not optimal for or interval/
ratio data. What is needed here is a histogram or a box plot (also both shown below).

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Graphs
To create graphs you need to understand the Chart Builder 
The graphics interface in SPSS underwent a total redesign in version 16 onwards. You set up a graph in Chart Builder 
using Graph -> Chart Builder. You will be prompted to check the data typing of your variables, see Figure 35. This is 
because the graph builder will only allow certain types of variable to be used in some graphic displays. You may find the 
variable you want to use is not offered in a list of variables. When this occurs you need to change the type in the Variable 
View. After dealing with this you will see a Canvas where the graph is drawn with Drop Zones in the x and y axes, where 
variables are placed from the Variables List, there is a Categories List (shown under Variables, if the given variable has 
any value labels) to show you what categories are in the selected variable (see Figure 36). You want to choose the Simple 
Bar which is the left top option in the Galley and put Nationality into the x-axis drop zone, see Figure 37. The resultant 
graph in the Output window is in Figure 37.

While for nominal and some ordinal data it makes good sense to use bar charts, for interval/ratio data a more specialised 
graph, the histogram is better,  which shows you the number of subjects in each of several increasing ranges. Now to make 
a histogram of age we choose histogram from the Gallery . To create our histogram first choose from the possible (here 
four) designs, select Simple Histogram by clicking on it with the mouse. Then we drag the Histogram, using the mouse, 
from the Gallery to the Canvas, see Figure 39.  Finally drag the variable age into the x axs drop zone, then the Output 
window will show the histogram, see Figure 40. Note we are given the mean and standard deviation. 
Figure 39: Creating a histogram
You can see immediately if the data are normally distributed, i.e. if they show a bell shaped curse. Clearly the histogram 
of age shows it is not normally distributed, note the normal curve I have superimposed over the data (this is added on 
the Element Properties). The distribution looks nothing like it, it is obviously skewed to younger ages. I.e. we can see 
that there is a big cluster of students just below 20, and a long tail of older students of various ages. This is important as 
we will see later that some statistical methods assume normal distribution.

Figure 40: Output of histogram
Another way to look at interval/ratio data is with a box plot (see Figure 41). Drag the Simple Boxplot (the leftmost) onto 
the Canvas.  Then drag variables age and gender onto the y and x axes respectively, giving the output in the Output 
window. This shows you the range (see the vertical line showing ages from about 18 to a little over 50 for females and up 
to about 40 for males), and the median value shown as the black line in the box. The box itself is the inter quartile range 
where half the data lie. So for females 50% of students are between about twenty to early thirties, the median is somewhere 
in the early twenties.

Exercise
I collected data on ethnic groups (this is different from nationality) e.g. White British, Black or Black British, Asian or 
Asian British. Separately I obtained data on attitude to the online course ranging from very useful to useless on a four 
point scale. How would I best show these data to a teaching colleague to show them the general picture of ethnicity in 
this course, and also describe their attitudes to the relevance of online courses. What type of data is ethnic group, and 
what type of data is the attitudinal variable?
Bar charts
Let us consider the bar chart of accesses to the course, which is a graphical way to present data that otherwise would be 
a frequency table.  
Access the Chart Builder and move Simple Bar into the Canvas, then move q3 into the horizontal drop zone as in Figure 
43, then hit OK. This might look like Figure 44.

This is an instructive chart, it shows us that degree students are more likely to access the course several times. However 
this can be made even clearer if we use percentages  instead of raw numbers (N of cases). To get percentage select in 
Element Properties the statistic Percentage rather than the default (Count), see Figure 47.  Then we get Figure 48. Note 
how the difference is much more striking. The difference was a little masked before as the number of degree students 
were much lower. Using % allows a direct comparison of each bar. This is especially notable for the last bar, labelled more 
than five times.

Splitting data
Let us consider now the histogram of age from week 1. What if you wanted a separate histogram for each course. You can 
do this in many ways, one is to split the data. Use Data -> Split File,  then follow Figure 49.

Figure 49: Dialogue box for splitting data
Nothing much happens, though you may note the data gets sorted by course. However what happens if you do a histogram 
of age? You get the histogram of age for each type of course. Indeed any analysis or graph you perform (until you unsplit 
the data, by ticking analyse all cases in Figure 49) is done on each value of variable used to compare groups (here there 
are only two), see Figure 50.

Exercise
Split data by gender and do a histogram of age for each gender. Unsplit the data and perform a clustered bar chart using 
percentages of gender against frequency of accessing the course. Interpret the results of both operations. 
Looking at several variables
We might like to do a boxplot of several variables at once.  This used to be possible in older versions of SPSS, but not 
now (though there is a legacy option, so actually you can). A similar effect can be done with Bar and Simple Error Bar, 
see Figure 53 where I have dragged four variables onto the y-axis.

Figure 53: Dialogue box for boxplots
The output is seen in Figure 54. While this graph does show the general trend, boxplots would be better on data that are 
not normally distributed, which these are not, so means and standard deviations are less useful.

Figure 54: Error bars of several variables
What this shows is that (as 1 = never to 5 =  most days for all these variables) that acrobat is used less than the other three 
applications. Whereas boxplots consider ranges and inter quartile ranges, error bars give a mean and (by default) 95% 
confidence intervals (i.e. where you expect 95% of values to lie). If this was a normally distributed sample it would indicate 
that the web, email and word are all used with much the same frequency, and acrobat much less than the others. This is 
probably correct, but as the data are probably not normally distributed we would need to explore this with different 
methods, which will be done in later chapters (non-parametric tests).
Scatterplots
If you have two variables that you think are related, provided neither is nominal a scatterplot is one answer to see if they 
are. See Figure 55 where I have chosen Scatter/Dot from the Chart Builder and then selected the two variables) and 
following this is the graph (Figure 56).

Figure 55: Steps in making a scatterplot
The scatterplot (see Figure 56) appears to show a weak relationship between generally higher computer confidence with 
lower age of student (as you might expect).  But the picture is hardly clear cut. In the lower levels of computer confidence 
all ages are shown,  only in the very highest where only a few (three) are seen is age apparent, as all three are young.  But 
three young people who are highly confident in using computers, against a sea of students of all ages with all levels of 
confidence a relationship does not make. This needs further exploration, and is so explored in correlation later in the 
book.

Conclusion
We have looked at some ways of showing data. In no case are we doing significance testing, this is more to show you

Introduction
What I want to look at now are a series of methods that do not really fall into basic or advanced, but could be described 
as useful. Many of the methods relate to ordering material so you can get to grips with it.
This chapter is relatively long but most of this is graphical and the text is not unduly lengthy.
The datafile we are using in this chapter is assets.sav, see the Appendix Datasets used in this text for details.  
Sorting data
This can be useful to look at raw data and get an intuitive feel of what is going on. Suppose in the asset data you wanted 
to look at only the more severe cases. You can sort by rank outcome, using Data -> Sort Cases. If I accept the default it 
will give the less severe cases at the top of the file, so I select the descending sort order instead, see Figure 57.

We could sort by more than one variable, for example in Figure 59 I have also sorted on ethnicity, this time ascending, 
so all the Asians with custodial sentences are at the top.  We can see at once there are only five Asians, furthermore two 
cases have no ethnic group identified, which might prompt a review of the records to see if the data are missing or just 
not entered, see Figure 60.

Aggregating
Sometime you want to have a more condensed dataset, for example if you wanted the highest gravity case for each ethnic 
group and gender. Putting gravity into the aggregated variable, note it defaults to function “mean” which is often what 
you want, but not in this case,  use Data -> Aggregate and then Figure 61. So we choose “function” and then “maximum” 
as in Figure 62. Finally the default position is to aggregate variables into the current dataset, which is never what I want 
to do, so I choose to put the aggregated data in a new dataset, see Figure 63. N.B. you can save it in a new file, but here 
I have not done this. Note in versions of SPSS before 14 you MUST save to a new file.

Computing new variables
We need to sum the asset sub-scores to create the total score, and SPSS allows us to compute this, see Figure 74, where 
I have used Transform ->  Compute Variable to create a new variable totass that is the sum of the twelve variables ass1 
to ass12. In case I need to do this again (if I add new data the variable totass will not automatically be re-computed, this 
is different from a spreadsheet where it would be) I can put the commands into a syntax file by clicking on Paste in the 
dialogue box (you can do this in most situations in SPSS) and the commands will appear in their own syntax window 
(see Figure 75 ) which can be separately saved to a syntax file and re-loaded when needed. A syntax file (or part of it) can 
be run, see Figure 76. You will note also that any commands are pasted into the Output window (not in earlier versions 
of SPSS). If you are feeling particularly nerdy you can write your own commands in either the syntax window, or cut and 
paste from a word processor. I am not going to show you how to write in SPSS syntax in this text though – it is rarely 
necessary (if ever).

Conclusion
I have shown a few simple ways to manipulate data to make various reports simpler or easier to view, or just to get a feel 
for the data in an exploration of it.
Exercise
Use the datafile ” assets”, sort by gravity (descending) and find the most severe case that did not get a custodial sentence. 
This sort of exploration can identify “odd” cases.

Key points
• 
Cross tabulations tell you how many subjects are in each combination of two nominal variables
• 
Chi square is an inferential test of nominal data
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
• 
Create cross tabulation tables
• 
Compute chi square and interpret the result
Introduction
An hypothesis is simply a statement that is capable of being tested. For example “there is no significant difference between 
men and women with respect to repeating self harm by overdose” is an hypothesis because it could be right or wrong. 
However “what is the effect of gender on self harm” is not, this is a research question. Clearly research questions and 
hypotheses are related, but not the same thing.  In this chapter we will look at the most simple inferential test, chi square. 
Inferential statistics test whether an hypothesis is right or wrong.

Significance
In all inferential tests there is one common feature, that of probability value or p value for short, often called significance, 
and in SPSS often shortened to sig. The p value is the probability of getting some set of data by pure chance. For example 
if I split a class into two random groups and measure their heights, you would expect the mean value for height to be 
similar (because they are random). However the two groups probably will not have identical mean values, due to chance 
and random fluctuation. A small difference in mean values is explained easily by chance, but a large difference may be 
significant. Clearly it matters how big the sample is, if the two groups consist on one student each, than a large difference 
means nothing, but two groups of (say) a hundred should only have very small different means. However even a large 
group can have a large difference by pure chance, so all fifty students in a randomly allocated group could be taller than 
the other randomly allocated group, but this is very unlikely.
I use a thought experiment to explain p values to my students, and this has always produced the same response over the 
last fifteen years. I ask you to imagine you are betting with a friend using a coin, heads they win, tails you win. If a head 
occurs you lose a pound (dollar, euro etc.) otherwise you win one. The first toss is a head. What do you make of this as 
you pass over your pound? Probably nothing as there is a one in two chance of a head. The second toss is also a head, 
again no big surprise. There is a one in two chance again, as the two tosses of the coin are independent (i.e. the result of 
one toss has no effect on the next). You would expect two consecutive heads one time in four. You hand over another 
pound. I continue with the third and fourth toss, both heads. This is getting annoying as you have now lost four pounds, 
but a one in sixteen chance of four heads in a row is not that surprising. What usually happens when the next toss is said 
to be a head is my students start looking a bit surprised, five in a row is getting a bit unbelievable, but it is not actually 
unbelievable as winning the lottery. By ten in a row they think something strange is going on and that this could mean 
cheating. But there is roughly one chance in a thousand that this could happen by chance. After losing one hundred tosses 
all students  are convinced there is cheating. But there is a finite chance still that this could simply be a random sequence 
that just has 100 heads in a row. It is however much less likely than winning the lottery (1 in 14.7 million) and it is less 
than one in 10-30 or roughly 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. Do you believe it is by chance? No, but it is 
as likely as any other sequence of heads and tails, it’s just that there are lots of them. Indeed any sequence of 100 heads 
and/or tails is equally likely, there is nothing special about 100 heads, any more than one head and 99 tails in a row. There 
is something special in the sense that in 100 throws there are massively more sequences that have roughly fifty head and 
fifty tails, and only one that has only heads or only tails.
This in essence is probability. You can never be sure that any set of data did not occur by chance, but when the probability 
is very low (close to zero) you tend not to believe it occurred by chance. In statistics we by convention say something that 
could occur 5% of the time by chance is significant. P values are in the range of 0 to 1, and a 5% probability is therefore 
0.05. You will often see p<0.05 which is interpreted as being significant. You will often see in reports tables where against 
some test result is an asterisk (*) which usually means p<0.05 or two (**) which is normally p<0.01 or three (***) which 
usually means p<0.001. Note SPSS truncates p values to three decimal places by default. That may give p values of 0.000, 
which is impossible (because no set of data, however weird, can never occur by chance). You should report this as p<0.001. It 
shows a basic lack of statistical knowledge to state p=0.000, and examiners or reviewers tend to dig deep once they see this.

Chi square
Example of using chi square
In the late 1990s Jenny Cook (one of my postgraduate students) conducted a study of self harm, it was later published 
(Cook and Anthony, 1999).
Open the file “deliberate self harm.sav” .
If you scroll down the variables you will see that they consist largely of nominal variables, most of which are binary (have 
two values) that are yes or no (plus a “not recorded” value).  Gender is just male/female and assessor is either doctor or 
nurse, employ is one of four categories and marital status is also in four categories.  The only “real” number is age. 
Note that to the left of the variable names is an icon that for all bar Age is three non overlapping circles, this means the 
variable is nominal. For Age the icon is a rule, which means it is scalar. There are no ordinal variables in this dataset, but 
if there were it would be an icon with three bars. SPSS does not necessarily know what type of variable you have, and 
often a number is assumed to be scalar when you build your dataset. You need therefore to define your data types under 
Measure in the Variable View as in Figure 77. The reason it is important to set the variables correctly to their type is 
that SPSS sometimes checks the type, especially in graphs, and will not allow certain actions to be taken on variables that 
are not of the right type.

Jenny wanted to identify risk factors for people who had taken overdoses. The literature is replete with factors that are 
thought to be associated with self harm, specifically overdose and repeat overdose in particular. Our paper does summarise 
this work. For example gender (males more) and previous mental health problems are associated with self harm (though 
overdose is just one example of self harm which also includes wrist cutting etc.).

Let us first see if males or females are most likely to take an overdose, I have done a frequency table for gender.

Chi square
We see immediately that there is a near 50:50 split between males and females, which is not what the literature led us to 
believe. It is true there are slightly more women than men, but in any random sample you would not get typically exactly 
50% male and 50% female. While there may be a statistically higher number of women (we have not tested this) it is too 
small to be of practical consequence. You need to ask what would you do if this was statistically significant, would you 
treat men and women differently in risk assessing for overdose based on a two percent difference (and there may be more 
women in the population at large!).
What we are interested in is whether the sample goes on to further overdoses. Jenny followed these patients up for two 
years, and if they repeated she changed this variable from no to yes (0 to 1 as the variable has value labels of 0=no and 
1=yes). A frequency table is shown in Table 9.

This shows some missing data, unlike gender. It appears that Jenny may have lost patients to follow-up. They could have 
died, moved or refused to be interviewed. The valid percent, which is the percent of those for whom we have data, is 
probably more useful, showing just over half (53% rounded to the nearest percent) took a further overdose.
These two tables tell us a lot about the sample. They do not tell us anything about who  repeats however. If we want to 
look at gender, we need to see both genders and whether they repeat or not. We need to cross the table of gender with 
that of repeat overdose. Such a table with every combination of two variables is called a cross tabulation table (crosstab 
in SPSS) or contingency table.
Crosstab of gender and repeat overdose
To get a crosstab use Analyze -> Descriptive Statistics -> Crosstabs
You then get the dialogue box as in Figure 78. I have already added gender into row and repeat overdose into column. 
It makes little difference whether you add to a row or column as long as you have (at least) one variable in each. It will 
only affect the display of the table. If you have more values in one variable than the other, it looks better if that one is in 
the rows. Here both variables have two values so it makes no difference at all.

This shows many more men repeat than women. Is this what we would expect if gender had nothing to do with repeat 
overdose? Well if there were more men in the sample then this would be expected, but there were actually fewer. At a 
rough guess since there were 531 (total for column 2) that repeated, and about half the sample were male, about 265 would 
be expected to be male, not 308. In fact the expected number would be slightly lower than 265 as there were fewer men. 
SPSS can compute the expected values for you. If from the dialogue box above I click on Cells I get a further dialogue 
box where I can select Expected (the default is just Observed) see Figure 79.

Our mental arithmetic guess was about right. We would have expected 264 (rounded up) males and 267 (rounded down) 
females to repeat. But could these figures be chance fluctuations? If we repeated this survey with a new 1000 cohort would 
it be possible that many more females repeat? Well it is always possible. If all men repeated and no woman did, it is possible 
that it was a biased sample and not representative of the population from which it was drawn. But is this likely? It does 
depend on the sample size. Take a ridiculous sample of one, one man, who does repeat. We can say 100% of men repeat, 
true but trivial. Now a sample of two, one man and one woman. The man repeats. Is this a big deal? No, clearly not. Now a 
sample of ten, 5 men and 5 women. All the men and none of the women repeat. Interesting, suggestive, but not definitive. 
A new sample of 1000, 500 of each gender.  All the men repeat, no woman does. Could this be a chance finding? 
I have been asking this of students for about fifteen years. They all say no. Why is this? Because of the size of the sample. 
Logically they are wrong, but only in the same way as you are wrong to tell me I will not win the lotto this week, and the 
next week, and every week for the next year. Yet I could (if I buy a ticket). I have a 1 in 14.7 million chance of getting a 
win on the UK lotto. Someone does most weeks, so it is not impossible to be me. However planning my finances on this 
basis would be foolish. If I win this week I still have the same chance next week. It could happen. I think it never has 
though. And that is two weeks, not 52. However unlikely it may be though it is possible, and winning the lottery twice 
has a computable value (one chance in 2,160,900,000,000 or one person in about 300-400 worlds of the same population 
as Earth, but not zero).
So how likely is it that the figures we see here are by chance? There is a statistical test called chi square that works this out 
for you. It looks at the difference between the observed and expected values, and give a high value if these are far apart, 
and a low one if they are close together. Then it looks at the sample size, and adjusts the value down if the sample is small 
and up if it is high. Actually it does not do this exactly, but conceptually it does just this. 
We can get the chi square value by clicking on Statistics from the dialogue box and ticking Chi square as in Figure 81.

Chi square
What this tells us is that all cells have expected frequencies over five. This is important as it is a condition of chi square 
that this be so, or at least that 80% of cells do. If this condition is not met then the default chi square value (Pearson 
Chi-Square, first line in table, not to be confused with Pearson correlation co-efficient which will be covered in a later 
chapter) should not be used, though the more conservative Continuity Correction can be used (second line in table). 
Fisher’s exact test is also fine if this condition does not hold.  Fischer’s test works out the possibility of each and every 
possible outcome and adds together all the ones under a certain frequency. It is computationally expensive (takes a lot of 
computer power) and very difficult to do by hand, hence the continuity correction was often preferred before the days of 
computers.  Pragmatically though I would say if you need to use these variants of chi square you may have too small a 
sample to be able to say anything very much.  Pearson’s chi square give a p value (called Asymp. Sig in the table) of 0.000, 
which we report as p<0.001. We interpret this as meaning there is a significant difference between men and women with 
respect to repeat self harm – because the p value is less than 0.05. A common error to think high p values are significant, 
it is low values that are significant. You can get SPSS to give you a clustered bar chart while it does the chi square test by 
clicking on the relevant item in the crosstabs dialogue box, see Figure 82, which is easier to interpret for the non statistically 
minded person (almost everyone, and probably your manager). This is useful for showing to (say) the clinical manager , 
and is seen in Figure 83 which clearly shows the impact of gender.

Crosstab of assessor and repeat overdose
Patients are seen by either a doctor or nurse. Who would you rather see? It should depend on who gets the better outcome.
Suppose we want to test if patients seen by doctors fare better than those seen by nurse (with respect to repeat self harm). 
Interestingly when I ask students to hypothesise they are split. Some would prefer to see a doctor on the grounds they are 
trained in diagnosis and would be more accurate therefore in predicting risk and giving appropriate treatment, and others 
would prefer to be seen by a nurse as they perceive them to be kinder and have more time to talk (some may disagree) .
Doing the same test with the variable assessor gives the following result (see Table 12).

Chi square
This shows a p value of 0.77 (to two decimal places) which is not significant. This shows that these data could have 
occurred by chance 77% of the time.  Thus the (real) difference between nurses and doctors means little, and it is highly 
likely to have occurred by chance. This is the opposite case compared to the former test.  The high p value means that 
it is not significant. So it does not appear to matter whether you are seen by a doctor or nurse, at least with respect to 
repeat harm by overdose.
Crosstab of follow-up and repeat overdose
Does follow-up of a patient help? Let’s test this with chi square. If I put variable followup into a similar chi square analysis

This shows a highly significant result (p<0.001, I hope you didn’t think p=0.000!). That’s great isn’t it as it shows follow-
up works? Or does it? If you look at the patients who were followed up 387 (rounding up) would be expected to repeat 
overdose, and only – oh dear – 449 did. This is a disaster, follow-up is actually making things worse!  When I ask my 
students to explain this I get answers like “the patient found the follow-up traumatic, they must have found it difficult to 
talk about their experiences” etc.  If we spoke to the managers and showed them the data maybe they would immediately 
stop this dangerous practice of seeing patients again.

Chi square
However every so often a group picks out the obvious. Who do we follow up? The patient who had a clear single reason 
for overdosing (their partner left them maybe) but they have now come to terms with that and have no particular risk 
factors that concern us? Possibly not. The unemployed homeless younger male with mental health problems and a history 
of overdoses? Maybe that one. So it could be (I am not proving here it is of course) that nurses and doctors pick the high 
risk cases for follow-up. Maybe things would be even worse if they did not (though I have no evidence for this). What we 
have here is an artefact. It shows the need for good clinical trials to identify what works. Now if we had randomly allocated 
patients into two groups, one with follow-up, the other not, and got the same results – well that would be different. In our 
case there was no randomisation. The lesson is you need to be very careful interpreting inferential testing where there is 
no randomisation. It is possible (epidemiologists do it as a profession) but certainly non-trivial.
Exercise
Males seem to repeat overdose more than females, according to the chi square analysis. However maybe males have more 
mental health problems, and it is this, rather than gender, that may be the real issue. Decide how to test this. You will 
need to create a cross-tabulation table and employ chi square to check this out.

Introduction
In chapter 6 we looked at differences in frequencies for nominal data. Let us consider the online course survey again. We 
could use chi square on some of these data.  An example is:-
Is there a difference between males and females with respect to course they are on? (There are two courses, degree and 
diploma, so are we recruiting more or less women to the degree programme)?
However what if your data are not nominal? For example Age. We could use chi square, but this is a very weak test for 
this type of data. Consider the following:-

There are several problems here. Firstly chi square assumes expected frequencies in each cell are at least 5, and the test 
becomes very unreliable if more than 20% of cells have an expected frequency of less than 5, and expected frequencies 
of less than one are problematic always. In this case 90% of cells have an expected frequency of less than 5, and one is 
as low as 0.12. 
But this is not the main problem. Age is an interval/ratio variable, and chi square does not use this extra information. It 
assumes each age is different (true) but makes no distinction between them. Chi square for example does not make use 
of the fact that an age of 20 is more than one of 19 and less than 21. It views these are simply three different categories 
of age, rather as it would if these were three ethnic groups.
We need a test that makes use of the fact that the data are genuinely numeric and not nominal. One such test is Student’s 
t test for independent groups (there is another Student’s t test for paired variables, the paired Student’s t test) which tests 
whether the mean values of two groups are significantly different.
Using the datafile online survey you can obtain the Student’s t test for independent groups by Analyze -> Compare Means 
-> Independent Samples T Test. Then a dialogue box will appear, see Figure 84.

You need to put in the variable you are testing (here age), the grouping variable (here gender) and the values for the two 
groups using Define (here 0 and 1). So we are using variable gender to split into two groups (males and females) and the 
test variable, i.e. the one we are testing to see if it is different between the groups, is age. If you complete this you get the 
output shown in Table 15.

Differences between two groups
The first part tells you that males are a little older (27.0) compared to females (26.4). But is this significant?  The second 
part tells you this. However this is a complicated table and needs careful examination. One of the requirements of Student’s 
t test for independent groups is that the variance in each group is similar. So a test is done (Levene’s test) to check this. 
The significance here for Levene’s test is 0.261, which is not significant. This means the difference in variances between 
the groups (male and female) is probably caused by chance, so there is no meaningful difference. A really common error 
is for students to confuse the significance given for Levene (a pre-test) for Student’s t test.
This means we can use Student’s t test for independent groups. We use the first line of the table (Equal variances assumed). 
The next bit of the table gives us the significance of the t test, here 0.799. This means that there is no significant difference 
between the groups, i.e. males and females are similar in terms of age. SPSS allows (makes an allowance for) non-equal 
variances, in which case you should use the second line of the table (Equal variances not assumed). 
There is a further problem though, Student’s t test for independent groups assumes the test variable data are normally 
distributed (it is a parametric test, parametric tests assume normal distribution). But is this true? Look at Figure 85.

This shows age to be skewed to younger ages. This is because most students are immediately post school, hence a bulge 
at about 20, but there are many older students across a wide range. 
Since the data are not normally distributed we need a test that does not assume normal distribution. These tests are called 
non-parametric tests. A common one for testing two groups is Mann Whitney.

Mann Whitney is obtained as in a similar manner to Student’s t test, but it comes under non-parametric tests. Use Analyze 
-> Nonparametric  Tests -> Independent Samples then you are given a dialogue box asking what of three options you

Table 16: Mann Whitney test
The Likert (attitudinal) scores scores for (e.g.) confidence in computer use can also be tested as these are ordinal data, 
which Mann Whitney can test. Bizarrely SPSS tells me when I try this that I cannot put ordinal variables into the non-
parametric tests for independent groups. I feel sure this is in error, however the workaround is to make this variable a 
scale variable. Again we see there are no significant differences between the two groups, here course types, see Table 17.

More than two groups
There is an extension of Student’s t test to more than two groups called one-way analysis of variance. This can compare 
any number of groups.
There is an equivalent to Mann Whitney for more than two groups, this is Kruskall Wallis, this is covered in the next chapter.

In the last chapter we looked at comparing two groups. Here we extend the case to more than two groups, in fact any 
number of groups more than two.
Difference between many groups
Consider the datafile mental health in prison.sav. This has for a number of prisons the responses of prisoners with respect 
to mental health symptoms. Prisoners were asked about nine symptoms, and a count was made for each prisoner of all 
the symptoms they had, up to a maximum of nine. There are five prisons. A frequency table is shown in Table 18.

We would like to see if there is a difference among the five prisons. Figure 86 shows there appears to be more problems 
in D and fewer in A and B. But are these differences significant? There are five prisons so we cannot use Student’s t test 
or Mann Whitney.

One way ANOVA (there are other ANOVA tests such as repeated measures ANOVA) may be the relevant test, and this 
is obtainable as Analyze -> Compare Means -> One-Way ANOVA. One way ANOVA is the extension of Student’s t test 
to more than 2 groups. In fact if you do one way ANOVA on two groups it will give identical results as Student’s t test 
for independent groups.
The dialogue box that comes up can be filled in as in Figure 87 and this will give an output seen in Table 19.

The relevant thing here is the between groups significance is 0.009.
Exercise
What does it mean to have a p=0.009 for the between groups? 
Which groups are different?
With two groups, if there is a significant difference then it simply remains to see which group is higher or lower with 
respect to the test variable.
However with more than two groups, if there is a significant difference, where does it lie? In this case for example it 
may be that prisons 1 and 2 are not significantly different, but are all different from prisons 3, 4 and 5. What is needed 
is a post-hoc test. I.e. after finding out whether there is a significant difference, the post -hoc test identifies where the 
differences lie.  In the One-Way ANOVA dialogue box if you click on Post-Hoc (Multiple Comparisons) you will see 
there are several such tests, a common one is Sheffe. This is obtained as in Figure 88.

This shows (see row 1) that prison 1 is not significantly different from prison 3 as although the mean difference is 0.794, 
it is not significant (p=0.284).
Exercise
Go through the remainder of the table and decide which prisons are the same (not significantly different from each other) 
and which are significantly different. 
However are the data (mental health symptoms) normally distributed? If not then we have a problem as ANOVA is a 
parametric test.
Exercise
Determine if the data for number of mental health symptoms are normally distributed. 
Non-parametric testing for more than two groups
If data are not normally distributed we can use the non-parametric test, which for more than two groups is Kruskall 
Wallis. If you use the same method as in the last chapter for Mann Whitney (which Kruskall Wallis is the equivalent test 
for more than two groups), i.e  Analyse -> Nonparametric Tests -> Independent Samples using the inputs in Figure 89.

Differences between more than two groups 
This shows that the difference between prisons is significant, p<0.05 (p=0.008). Thus the null hypothesis (i.e. there is no 
difference among the prisons with respect to number of symptoms) is rejected, or there are differences among the prisons. 
Unfortunately there are no post hoc tests available in the non parametric tests. What we could do is a Mann Whitney 
between all possible groups, but this is increasingly unhelpful as the number of groups increases, and with five prisons 
there are ten different possible combinations of two prisons out of the five. It is also problematic as with ten pair-wise 
tests you would expect a p < 0.05 not one time in twenty, but roughly four times in ten. You might think one time in two, 
but to have a situation where no p < 0.05 for ten independent tests, assuming purely random fluctuations, would mean 
0.9510 =0.60 to 2 decimal places. Thus to have at least one false positive would have a p value of 1-0.6 = 0.4. There are 
methods of working out post hoc comparisons with Kruskall Wallis, but not in SPSS, and the methods are not standard 
or universally accepted.  
Conclusion
We have looked at differences among many groups, and introduced a parametric test (one-way ANOVA) and non-
parametric test (Kruskall Wallis).

Correlation
9	 Correlation
Key points
• 
Pearson and Spearman rank are the appropriate tests for correlation of two variables
• 
Data must be at least ordinal for correlation to make sense
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
• 
Decide which test to use
• 
Compute and interpret the result
Introduction
If two variables are correlated, this means as one goes up the other goes up (positive correlation) OR as one goes up the 
other goes  down (negative correlation). However complete correlation is rare, it is seldom the case that when one variable 
goes up by n units, the other goes up (or down) by m units.
An example might make this clearer. Older patients tend to have more complex problems than younger ones. Thus you 
might expect older patients to stay in hospital longer. This, if true, would be described as there being a positive correlation 
between length of stay and age of patient. But clearly some very elderly patients come in for a cataract operation and are in 
for (say) one day, and a nineteen year old man might be in hospital months following a serious motor accident. However 
other things being equal, there is a trend for older patients to have longer lengths of stay.
If (for example) it were true that for every year after eighteen, each year of life added one day to length of stay, then length 
of stay would be entirely predictable from your age. This is total 100% complete correlation, and we would say r (the 
correlation co-efficient) is unity (+1.0).  It is positive as length of stay increases when age increases.
For very young babies however the length of stay might be more, not less, than for older children. If it were true that 
for every month born pre-term one day were added to length of stay then the length of stay is still entirely predictable, 
but this is negative correlation, because as length of stay increases age decreases. The correlation co-efficient is unity, but 
negative (r=-1.0).
But as you cannot completely predict length of stay from age, it might be that r=0.3 or r=-0.4 (say). An r=0.0 would 
mean that as age varied, length of stay did not change in any particular way, it might go up or down or do nothing at all.
It is time to consider a real world example. There is a general assumption that younger people are more confident in using 
IT. Thus in our online course example we might expect the older students to express less confidence in using computers. 
To conduct a correlation analysis you  use Analyze -> Correlate -> Bivariate and enter the variables as in Figure 90.

The first thing to note is the significance [Sig (2 tailed)]. If the correlation is not significant it is not worth interpreting 
the co-efficient. It is like the difference of means in Student’s t test, if the difference between the means is not significant 
you would not try to interpret the difference in the means (as there probably is none).
In this case there is no significant correlation, so we interpret this as age is not correlated to confidence in using computers. 
Thus the view that older students would be less confident is not supported. In other words the null hypothesis (there is 
no significant correlation between age and confidence) is accepted.

Correlation
There is a limitation with the correlation co-efficient we have chosen. We are using Pearson’s correlation co-efficient 
(usually denoted as r) which is a parametric test. But a histogram showed clearly that age is not normally distributed 
(neither is computer confidence). We should have used a different non-parametric test, Spearman rank. This does the 
same thing as Pearson, does not assume data are normally distributed, and is usually denoted as rs. To get this in SPSS, 
click on Spearman rather than Pearson in Figure 90. If we did this we get the output seen in Table 23.

Using the data in the RAE datafile consider the following hypotheses:-
• 
There is no significant correlation between full time equivalent (FTE) doctoral students and RAE rating
• 
There is no significant correlation between funding and RAE rating
Remember you will need to check whether the data (both variables) are normally distributed

Paired tests
10	Paired tests
Key points
• 
Paired Student’s t t test and Wilcoxon are the appropriate tests for two groups
• 
Repeated ANOVA and Friedman is for more than two groups
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
• 
Decide which test to use
• 
Compute and interpret the result
Paired Student’s t test
Use the dataset “anxiety 2.sav”
Firstly we will see if there is a difference between trial1 and trial2. We cannot use Student’s t test for independent groups 
as this is not a comparison of two groups of one test variable. Rather it is a comparison of two variables in one group. 
Each subject is recorded twice, once in trial1 and again in trial2. The data are paired, so it is the paired Student’s t test 
we should use. To obtain this follow the steps Analyze -> Compare Means -> Paired Samples T Test and Figure 91.

Repeated ANOVA
However we have more than two measurements, how would we (for example) test the differences between trial1, trial2 and 
trial3. We cannot use the paired test as that only allows for two variables. Here we need to use ANOVA repeated measures. 
Follow Analyze -> General Linear Model -> Repeated Measures and Figure 92. Here we create a factor, which contains 
the variables we want to test. You can call this factor pretty much anything, and I have called it learn_errors. Note you 
cannot have spaces in factor names so I have used an underscore. We have three variables for testing so the number of 
levels is set to three. I next clicked on add and then define to obtain Figure 93. I have also added Descriptive statistics 
(Figure 94) which is obtainable from Options in Figure 93.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

There is a lot of output, but most of it is not important now. Table 27 tells you which variables are in the factor for testing. 
Table 28 shows you that the mean value is going down between trial1 and trial2 and also again between trial2 and trial3. 
Here we have one variable being tested, anxiety, but in principle there could be many. If that were the case then we would 
be doing a multivariate analysis (because there are more than one dependent variable of interest). Table 29 tells us that 
for multivariate analysis there is a significant result. This table is seemingly pointless in this case, however it may be of 
use (see below).  Table 30 tests for sphericity (sphericity means that data are uncorrelated, a low p value indicates a problem 
here) which shows it is not significant, so it is not a problem. Table 31 gives results if sphericity is assumed which is the 
case here. The last two tables show the between subjects (Table 32) which explores the differences between each of the 
subjects (not of interest here) and within subjects (Table 31) that tells us of the difference of successive results on each 
individual (which we are interested in here). ANOVA assumes sphericity, and this is not a problem here. However 
multivariate tests do not assume spericity, hence if this were a problem we would use the p value in the multivariate test. 
Each of the various tests (Pillai, Wilks, Hotelling, Roy) have their advantages and limitations (see (Field, 2009) but here 
it makes little difference which one you consider, they are all highly significant. So there is a significant difference between 
the three variables.

Wilcoxon
Student’s t test and repeated ANOVA are parametric tests. What if our data are not normally distributed? Then we need 
to use equivalent non-parametric tests. For paired variables we can use Wilcoxon. Follow Analyze -> Nonparametric 
-> Related Samples and Figure 95 to set this up for trial1 and trial2.   Table 33 shows the difference is significant at 
p=0.002. This does not show us however which is higher, to show this use the error bars option of the bar chart in the 
Graph builder, see Figure 96, where I have selected two variables (click on one, then hold down the control key when 
selecting the second) and moved them across to the y-axis which will give the output in Figure 97, which shows clearly 
that the values have become lower in trial2,  in fact there is no overlap at all for the 95% confidence interval (i.e. the range 
where we expect 95% of values to occur). Indeed all twelve values are lower in trial2 than trial1. Note this is a (possibly 
artificially constructed) dataset for tutorial purposes, such clear differences are rare in real data.

For more than two related variables there are several tests, one being Friedman. Follow Figure 98 (obtainable from Non

this is going down from trial1 to trial2 and then further to trial3, see Figure 99 (the chances of you getting such clear 
results in small samples are pretty minimal, I only use these files as I have no studies using paired data).

Measures of prediction: sensitivity,

Introduction
In this chapter we will be considering material that is required to understand receiver operating characteristic (ROC). 
ROC will be covered in the next chapter. 
Diagnosis of fractures is a relatively new area for nursing, and is part of the advanced practitioner role for nurses in some 
accident and emergency departments since at least the mid 1990s. Classification involves placing objects that are similar 
to each other (e.g. diseases) into a group. A person with a given set of signs and symptoms is given a specific diagnosis. In 
one of the examples given in this chapter, radiographs are used to split those who have a fracture from those who do not.
But how accurate are nurses at diagnosing fractures? Diagnosis from a radiograph can be complex, and you can make a 
mistake. The nurse can be perfect at picking up fractures by always saying that there is a fracture, as then she1 will miss 
none, but nor will she ever declare a radiograph clear. The technical description of such a classification is that it is very 
sensitive, in that no fracture is missed; but it is not specific at all, in that all radiographs are said to show a fracture. These 
two terms will be discussed and defined below, but sensitivity measures how good we are at picking up the disease, and 
specificity how good we are at identifying the normal. The above is clearly a very extreme case, but shows that a very 
sensitive measure is not necessarily useful. At the other extreme a nurse may never say a radiograph shows a fracture, 
and by missing all fractures that do occur shows a low sensitivity (in fact zero). However, she does not ever misinterpret a 
normal radiograph as showing a fracture, and is said to have a high specificity. Clearly this form of classification is useless 
also. Thus ensuring that you never make a mistake in misinterpreting a fracture as normal, or never making the opposite 
mistake of misinterpreting a normal radiograph as showing a fracture will not typically give a useful classification.
Similarly, you might want to predict those patients who will develop pressure sores by using a system that splits patients 
who are high risk for developing a pressure sore, according to some scoring system. Again the system is most unlikely to 
be 100% accurate; many patients stated to be at high risk will not develop sores, and some who at not considered at risk 
may do so. The concept of a threshold is inherent in such a system, as the patient is given a score indicating risk. But at 
which score do we consider them at risk? We can choose any score as the one that defines risk, but we will typically want 
the threshold score to split the patients into those likely to develop sores and those unlikely to develop sores, which is not 
necessarily (or usually) the same thing as splitting them into those that definitely will not from those that definitely will 
develop sores. If the score indicates increasing risk, raising the threshold will result in a less sensitive tool, and lowering 
the threshold will give a more sensitive one. Unfortunately, as shown above, the more sensitive measure is not necessarily 
a better one.

Measures of prediction: sensitivity,  
specificity and predictive values 
Sensitivity and specificity
Let us now define these two concepts. When making a binary decision, as for example deciding on the diagnosis of a 
fracture or no fracture (it is or it is not a fracture, there are two cases), one may make a true diagnosis where the fracture 
is present or absent, or a false diagnosis, also where the fracture is present or absent. There are four cases in total:
1.	 True-positive decision: the patient has a fracture (disease, will develop a sore etc.) and we state they do
2.	 True-negative decision: the patient does not have a fracture etc. and we state this correctly
3.	 False-positive decision: the patient does not have a fracture etc. but we state they do
4.	 False-negative decision: the patient has a fracture etc., but we say they do not.
True positive and true negative rates can be used together to give measures of accuracy.
Sensitivity is identical to a true positive ratio. It is defined as the proportion of all positive cases that are correctly identified 
as positive. Sensitivity measures how well we perform in identifying those subjects with a fracture (or other condition). 
As all the positive cases comprise those that we got right (true positives) and those we got wrong (false negatives), the 
ratio of true positive to all positives is given by
Sensitivity = TP/(TP+FN)
Specificity is defined as the proportion of all negative cases that are correctly identified as negative. Specificity measures 
how well we perform in identifying those subjects who are normal (i.e. do not have a fracture or some other condition of 
interest). As all the negative cases comprise those that we got right (true negative) and those we got wrong (false positive), 
the ratio of true negative to all negatives is given by.
Specificity = TN /(TN+FP)
Specificity is the same as the true negative ratio. In practice the false positive ratio is often used. The true negatives and 
false positives are all the negative cases, and it follows that the true negative ratio and false positive ratios add to unity. 
Using the false positive ratio is therefore identical to using (1- specificity).
Sensitivity and specificity are simply the number of correct cases as a fraction of the totals for those patients who have/
do not have the condition.
Thresholds
One does not typically state with absolute certainty that, for example, a patient has a fracture or that a patient will develop 
a pressure sore, or that they do not have a fracture or will not develop a sore. A more natural statement would be that 
one is very sure, or fairly confident, or that it is quite unlikely, etc.

Measures of prediction: sensitivity,  
specificity and predictive values 
However, sometimes a straightforward choice of where to allocate resources requires a decision to be made, even if 
we cannot be 100% sure of what the right decision is; so we need a best guess. For example, the patient is at high risk 
of pressure sore formation and therefore needs a special mattress, or they are not and the mattress can be allocated to 
someone else. Thus one needs to identify a threshold above which the patient is at high risk and below which they are 
not. For example, the Waterlow score above which a patient is said to be at high risk could be stated to be 10. In this 
case any value above 10 (the threshold) is said to indicate risk. It is also possible to have a scoring system such as the 
Braden score, which works in the opposite direction; i.e. low scores are indicative of risk, in which case values below a 
given threshold would indicate risk.
If it is important to get the diagnosis right and making a false positive diagnosis is not problematic, then one can set 
the threshold low (or, if increasing score implies less risk, we would set the threshold high, as the scale is the other way 
round, where decreases in the scale imply more risk). If a patient monitor gives an alarm when there is nothing wrong 
with the patient, it causes some irritation. However, if the alarm fails to go off and some injury or death could ensue then 
clearly this is far more important to avoid than the irritation of false alarms. There is a penalty for a false positive alarm, 
i.e. resetting the alarm, irritation and noise. However, as the penalty for a false negative alarm could be death, we set the 
monitor to be very sensitive, or to have a low threshold. Thus we accept a poor specificity in this situation in order to 
ensure a very high sensitivity.

Measures of prediction: sensitivity,  
specificity and predictive values 
While in health care it is usually important to not miss a true case (a diagnosis of some disease, for example), i.e. a false 
negative is almost always a problem, thus  setting an arbitrarily low threshold is not advised. There may be a significant 
penalty in getting the decision wrong either way; failure to accept true positive, and reject true negative may both be 
dangerous. For example, if a test shows a patient to have a pulmonary embolism (PE) we would treat with anticoagulants, 
as PE can be fatal. The penalty for a false-negative diagnosis would therefore be a failure to treat the PE, resulting in 
death from respiratory arrest. However, unnecessary treatment with anticoagulants can cause dangerous bleeding in 
post-surgical patients, and therefore a highly sensitive test that always gets the PE cases but also wrongly diagnosis many 
who do not have the disease could also cause danger. The benefit from a true-positive diagnosis is that the potentially 
life-threatening condition of PE is treated, and the benefit from a true-negative diagnosis is that iatrogenic bleeding of a 
patient who does not have PE is prevented.
There is thus a trade-off in setting the threshold level. For example, in mass screening for human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) one might have a blood test where high values indicate a high probability of having the virus and lower values 
indicate less probability of having the virus. If one sets the threshold too high, many of the population with the condition 
will not be picked up, while if one sets the threshold too low many of the population will be diagnosed HIV positive who 
do not in fact have the virus, causing distress.
The level at which one sets the threshold depends on the relative merits of specificity and sensitivity in the given domain. 
This may be, and often is, a subjective assessment.
Confidence levels
One method of obtaining several threshold levels simultaneously is to allocate confidence levels to the decisions. For each 
level of confidence, one measures true positives and false positives as a percentage of the maximum true positives and 
false positives possible. Thus one could ask clinicians to state how sure, using a score range of 1-5, they were in making 
a given decision (e.g. a diagnostic decision). Rather than use numerical confidence levels, which could be meaningless to 
a clinician, the levels could be obtained from a Likert scale, for example a five-point scale such as the one shown below:
5 Very confident that disease is present
4 Quite confident that disease is present
3 Unsure if disease is present or not
2 Quite confident that disease is not present 
1 Very confident that disease is not present

Measures of prediction: sensitivity,  
specificity and predictive values 
In this example, if the level was allocated a number as shown above, then one might set a threshold of 3, whereby any 
value more than or equal to 3 would be considered a positive diagnosis, which would include many cases of ‘unsure’. 
Choosing 4 as the threshold value would remove the ‘unsure’ cases, with only ‘very confident’ or ‘quite confident’ being 
now considered a positive diagnosis. Thus less false-positive but more false negative diagnoses would probably ensue.
Gold standard
If one is to test the classification ability of a person, scoring system, etc., then one needs to know what the correct 
classification should be. This is not always easy. If one uses a specialist in classifying as the ‘gold standard’ for determining 
how well an inexperienced trainee is performing, one implicitly trusts the specialist to always be right - but she may make 
mistakes. Where possible the ‘gold standard’ should be objective and demonstrably correct; where this is impossible it 
should be a classifier that one has much more confidence in than the one being assessed.
In a prospective study the gold standard may be whether the patient ultimately contracts the disease or condition. This 
may be very clear in some cases (e.g. from post mortem examination).
Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values
You should now be familiar with the concepts of sensitivity and specificity. However there are two other concepts that 
are useful. While sensitivity and specificity are good research measures to assess an instrument, clinically the measures 
of predictive values, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) are more useful. These (and 
sensitivity and specificity) are discussed well in Altman & Bland (1994b, 1994a, 1994c). Wikipedia has a clear and (when 
I last looked anyway) accurate description.
PPV = TP/(TP+FP)
NPV = TN/(TN+FN)
This looks rather similar to sensitivity and specificity:-
Sensitivity = TP/(TP+FN)
Specificity = TN/(TN+FP)
But where in sensitivity and specificity the denominator is the number found to be positive (sensitivity) or negative 
(specificity) for predictive values have denominators of number of cases that test positive (PPV) or negative (NPV).
So when would one use one pair of tests rather than the other? It depends on your interest. As a researcher evaluating a 
test you want to know if it distinguishes between cases (patients with HIV for example) from controls (patients who do 
not have HIV). But what if you are a patient who has just had a test? You want to know, given a positive result, how likely 
is it that you have the condition, in this example HIV. You want the PPV which tells you this. If you had a negative result 
the NPV would tell you how likely it is you do not have the condition.

Measures of prediction: sensitivity,  
specificity and predictive values 
PPV and NPV are highly dependent on the prevalence of a disease. You could have an almost perfectly sensitive test, say 
0.999 which is almost perfectly specific, say also 0.999. You get a positive test for HIV. Surely you must almost certainly 
have HIV? If the prevalence of a disease if very low then PPV will be much lower than if prevalence is high, even where 
sensitivity and specificity are both great. If prevalence were 1.5% you would almost certainly be HIV positive, but if 
prevalence were 0.01% you would have only a 50:50 chance of being HIV positive. If you find this confusing you should 
read Ben Goldacre excellent article which makes this apparent contradiction very clear (Goldacre, 2006). 
Example
In youth offending teams (YOTs) young people are assessed using the asset score, a risk assessment tool. Asset scores (see 
Appendix) are considered to indicate risk of reconviction according to the numerical total score:-
Table 35: Risk bands for asset scores
Score band
Risk level
0-4
Low
5-9
Low-medium
10-16
Medium
17-24
Medium-high
25-48
High
Suppose we now wanted to see if this worked as a risk tool for custodial sentence (it was not designed to do this, but as 
an illustration it will suffice). If we took anyone who is at high risk (>24) then we can see (Table 35) that 65 of the 137 
custodial sentences were in the high risk group, and 102 of the 958 non-custodial sentences were in the high risk group.

Thus for the young person in the high risk group, the chance of getting a custodial sentence is a little lower than sensitivity 
would suggest, and a young person not in the high risk group is more likely to not get a custodial sentence than specificity 
would suggest. I.e. they are less likely on both counts to get a custodial sentence, and this is because the chance of getting 
a custodial sentence is only about 12%. What if it were 1.2%?

Specificity = 856/958
	
	
	
	
	
= 0.89
So sensitivity and specificity are unchanged by the prevalence (here custodial sentence). This is the strength of these 
measures, they are invariant to prevalence. (Note the slight change in sensitivity is simply a rounding error, I have changed 
72 to 7 and 65 to 6. In other words the prevalence is not exactly 1.2% but as near as I can get. If I had kept it at exactly 
1.2% the sensitivity would not have changed at all.)
PPV

FPV= 856/863

So the PPV is massively worse when the prevalence reduces by a factor of ten. So if custodial sentencing were to be rare 
in a population, the predictive value is weak even when the sensitivity remains the same.

Introduction
In the last chapter we looked at sensitivity and specificity for a given threshold. Here we consider a technique that looks 
at many thresholds at once. This is receiver operating characteristic (ROC),  which is a technique used in classification 
analysis. ROC analysis is well known in psychology, medicine, medical physics, chemistry and medical imaging, but is 
less well known in many branches of health care. For a good introduction to its use in psychology see Rose (1995) and 
for medical imaging see Swets (1979). A summary for medicine is given in Altman & Bland (1994a, 1994c, 1994b) and 
a detailed description can be found in Zweig & Campbell (1993). The accuracy of diagnosis of distal fractures and the 
prediction of pressure ulcers show the worth of ROC in areas such as nursing (Overton-Brown and Anthony, 1998) or 
physiotherapy.

Receiver operating characteristic 
The potential use for ROC will be any area where decisions are made, where you are not certain when you are right, and 
where the decisions can be made with various levels of confidence. This is typical of most health care decisions, and all 
of the interesting ones (i.e. the decisions that require some expertise). 
One can use ROC to compare different classification systems directly. Examples might include:
• 
Two or more interpreters of a radiograph rating the presence of a fracture on a Likert scale 
• 
Two or more pressure ulcer risk scales
• 
Two or more clinicians diagnosing a disease
• 
Two or more automatic image analysis computer programs
Assessment at many different thresholds: ROC
The sensitivity and specificity is, as shown in chapter 11, dependent on the threshold used. However, one does not need 
to insist on using only one threshold. One can use several; ROC is the term applied to the analysis and measurement of 
sensitivity and specificity at many thresholds simultaneously. The advantage of ROC is that one can decide which threshold 
is optimal for a given decision-making problem. One can also directly compare different classification systems by looking 
at the full spectrum of thresholds possible. Without such an approach it is always difficult to compare two systems, as 
system A may show greater sensitivity than system B simply because it was assessed at a threshold that allowed great 
sensitivity, while in general system B might actually perform better than system A.
Considering distal fractures again, by looking at the sensitivity and the specificity of the diagnosis together, ROC can assess 
the nurse and compare her ability with other professionals. This will clearly be necessary if nurses are to be accepted as 
‘safe’ in this new domain for nursing practice. ROC was used to compare nurses with accident and emergency medical 
staff (casualty officers) with regard to the assessment of distal fractures, and no significant differences between the two 
groups were found. This study gives quantitative evidence that nurses are competent in this new area (Overton-Brown 
and Anthony, 1998).

DRAWING THE ROC CURVE
An ROC curve is simply a plot of the true positive rate against the false positive rate for given thresholds. Note some 
workers use sensitivity against specificity, but most use (l-specificity), which is the false positive rate. The two approaches 
are entirely analogous. A system that classifies randomly produces a straight line, with the diagonal running from bottom 
left to top right on the ROC plot. Some ROC curves may be shown as percentages from 0% to 100% rather than as numbers 
0 to 1; this is simply achieved by multiplying all the sensitivities and specificity figures by 100.

Receiver operating characteristic 
The better the classification the further the curve is from the diagonal. In a perfect classification all the patients below a 
certain threshold will have no fractures, and above it all the patients will have fractures. Ideally, data that are just above 
the threshold will give a point on the graph that is close to zero for the false positive rate and close to 100% for the true 
positive rate, i.e. a point that lies in the top left-hand corner of the graph and as far from the diagonal as possible.
In the real world there will usually be some incorrect classifications, but a good classification will have a threshold above 
which few false positives will be present but many true positives will be seen. Above the optimal threshold, the number of 
false positives will start to reduce, but less quickly than the number of true positives, and below the threshold the opposite 
will be true. Thus a curve is seen when plotting true against false positive. Two or more curves may be compared directly. 
If one curve lies above and to the left of the other it is a more accurate classifier.
MEASURE OF CLASSIFICATION
The area under the curve gives some measure of the ability of the system to classify. An area of one-half of the maximum 
would be random (the area under the diagonal, which exactly splits the graph in two equal parts), while the nearer the 
value is to the maximum area the better the classification.

ADVANTAGES OF ROC
ROC has several advantages:
1.	 ROC analysis allows you to assess a classification at several sensitivities and specificities, not merely one pair.
2.	 Two or more ROC plots can be compared visually. A plot lying above and to the left of another plot shows 
greater accuracy.
3.	 Sensitivity and specificity are calculated totally separately, using results from different groups. Sensitivity 
considers only those that have the condition, while specificity considers only those that do not. Thus the ROC 
plot is independent of prevalence of the disease (or condition under scrutiny, in the above cases fractures or 
ulcers).
PROBLEMS WITH ROC
ROC is not without its difficulties.
1.	 Two ROC curves can have the same area but have very different characteristics. For example, one plot may 
have a much better specificity at low sensitivity, and the other better specificity at higher sensitivity. The area 
under an ROC curve is a single measure, and information is necessarily lost by collapsing data down to one 
value. The whole plot should be examined.
2.	 Relative costs of false classification (false positive and false negative) can be complex, so identifying the optimal 
threshold from an ROC plot is not necessarily easy. However, techniques do exist to achieve this end.
3.	 Comparison of ROC plots statistically can be difficult, especially where the tests are correlated (e.g. where two 
tests are performed on the same patient).
Creating ROC curves in SPSS
In SPSS 14.0 (and any versions since about 2000) you can easily get an ROC. Let us consider the dataset of young offenders. 
This dataset, “young offenders” has the asset score, which is a measure of risk of offending, and whether the young person 
got a custodial sentence or not, where they were tried, gravity of offence and some demographic details. 
To get an ROC curve use Analyze -> ROC Curve. In Figure 100 I have put total asset score as the test variable, which is 
the variable used to test whether, in this case, the young person will get a custodial sentence. The state variable is the one 
that shows whether the young person did or did not get a custodial sentence. I have set this to one. Finally I have ticked 
to have an optional diagonal line. The output is shown in Figure 101 and Table 39.

You can do ROC curves for one than one variable and get an immediate measure of the various classification abilities. See 
Figure 102 that shows, unsurprisingly, that age is a poorer classifier than asset score. You might ponder why age works at all.

ROC is a useful method for assessing classification systems, and may be used to compare different classifiers quantitatively. 
It should be considered in audit and assessment tools that are numerical in nature and provide a clear output, but which 
are subject to probability rather than absolute certainty in the decision.

Reliability
13	Reliability
Introduction
If a measure is repeatable then we should get the same result when we measure the same thing twice (or more). Reliability 
measures give a quantitative value for repeatability. For example, they may be used to assess how repeatable a machine 
is, or to what extent two humans give the same value.
Stability: test-retest
This tests whether a measuring device (which could be a human) gives the same result when the measurement is repeated. 
Typically, the measurements could be physical measurements, and the correlation between one score and the other is 
calculated. A high correlation is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for stability. For example, a high correlation 
could be seen if the second measure were exactly half that of the first occasion. There are problems with this technique, 
especially where the testing of humans using, say, some form of skills test. In such a case if too little time is left between 
measurements the subject may simply repeat what they remember they said rather than re-compute the score, but if a 
large time lag is allowed it could be argued that any changes noted are real (i.e. not an artefact or error).
Equivalence: comparing two forms of test or two observers
Reliability is a measure of how repeatable the data are that are captured; e.g. if I repeat a serum glucose assay will I get 
the same value for blood sugar?
It is possible to get highly repeatable results that are inaccurate, for example if my weighing scale is weighing consistently 
light it may always report me a kilogram below my real weight, although it may be always within 0.1 kg of the previous 
reading. A less reliable scale (say consecutive readings within 0.2 kg of each other) may be more accurate, with a mean 
value close to my real weight. So reliability is not the same as accuracy. However, if you always use the same instrument, 
the fact that it is reliable may be more useful than its accuracy. If I want to lose weight the scales that are always one 
kilogram too low will still allow me to see if I am losing or gaining. Paradoxically, these inaccurate scales are more useful 
than the more accurate but less reliable ones, provided I always use the same scales.
A highly reliable measuring device may not be a valid one. A micrometer is capable of measuring very tiny distances 
(thousandths of an inch), but this is of no use if you want to measure the length of a football pitch. Investigators sometimes 
choose highly accurate and/or highly reliable measures (remembering that accuracy and reliability are separate features) 
rather than less precise and/or less reliable measures that are actually relevant. For example you could measure poverty 
by measuring income, but you could be on a relatively high income and still be poor if you live in an expensive city and 
have a lot of commitments. For these and other reasons poverty measures are not always based on income, or at least 
not solely on income. 
If two observers are involved in a study (inter-rater reliability), then we would want them to give the same score. However, 
in practice there will always be some discrepancies. For example, two lecturers will almost always give different marks to 
the same piece of work, although there may still be an overall trend to agreement.

Reliability
One way of assessing equivalence is to calculate the number of agreements and divide by the number of possible agreements. 
Suppose two student nurses assess a group of patients for grade of sore, where the sore could be described as superficial 
or deep. To simplify the example let us assume that there are the same number of patients with superficial as with deep 
sores - as assessed by an expert in tissue viability (wound care). If the nurses agreed on the type of sore all the time their 
assessment wou1d be said to be reliable, but in practice they will sometimes disagree. Suppose they agreed half of the 
time, then one would say that the assessment was 50% reliable. But in fact there are only two possibilities (superficial or 
deep sore) and so if the two nurses were guessing all the time you would expect them to agree at about this level.
Now suppose that the sores were graded on a scale of 1-4, where 1 indicates a reddened area and 4 indicates a deep cavity 
sore, with scores of 2 and 3 indicating intermediate sores. Assume there are equal numbers of sores of each level. If the 
two nurses agreed about half the time on the grading of the sores they are in fact doing rather better, for by chance they 
would agree only about 25% of the time (one time in four).
So the number of possible classifications is important - clearly it is easier to guess correctly a yes/no answer than an answer 
to a multiple choice question with four possible answers.
Kappa: a test of reliability for nominal data
The presence or absence of an ulcer is nominal data, and is best measured in terms of reliability by some test like kappa. 
Kappa only looks at whether the two observers say the same thing.
Load dataset “pu”. To run a kappa analysis you select the pulldowns, Analyze -> Descriptive Statistics -> Crosstabs which 
are the same as for crosstabs, and those used for conducting chi square analysis.
You then get a dialogue box in which you put the two variables that contain the results of each assessor, which is identical 
again to any other cross tabulation.

Then selecting the statistics box, instead of putting chi square, tick Kappa as in Figure 104.
Figure 104: Statistics dialogue box
pu1 and pu2 are presence (1) or absence (0) of pressure ulcer. The cross tabulation shows that on 36 occasions both nurses 
say there is no ulcer, on 10 occasions both say there is one, and in 4 cases they disagree, see Table 40. Thus the straight 
agreement is 40 out of 50 or 80%, which looks good.

However suppose the results were as in Table 41. We can call this case B, and we could call the earlier case, case A. Nurse 
1 says 13 of the patients have an ulcer, and nurse 2 only 1. But the raw agreement is 72% which also looks pretty good. 
Note however that the one occasion nurse 2 says there is an ulcer, nurse 1 does not. Therefore not once do the nurses 
agree on when there is an ulcer, but on many occasions they agree there is none.

Now if case B has kappa computed the result is terrible, close to zero, indicating no agreement, despite the raw score

Reliability for ordinal or interval data
Kappa is good for nominal data, but not for ordinal or interval scores. For it would be possible (e.g.) for a nurse to always 
score very close to a colleague and yet have a kappa of close to zero since they rarely or never score exactly the same.  A 
different test, the intra class correlation coefficient (ICCC) is more appropriate. Having said that if there are a very few 
possible values in an ordinal scale, say three values, then kappa is acceptable. But for something like the Waterlow score, 
that can take values from 1 to over 30, it is certainly not an appropriate test.
You might think we could use correlation, but there is a problem with this, if nurse 1 always scores ten points lower than 
nurse 2 then there is total correlation, yet they always disagree by a large amount. Of course if you knew nurse 1 marked 
lower, you could account for this. The ICCC however does not suffer from this problem as it measures how close the two 
markers are.
Use Analyze -> Scale -> Reliability Analysis then put in the two variables for the scores for each nurse, see Figure 105.

The nice additional aspect of the ICCC is it can be used to compare the outcomes of more than two subjects. In this way 
it is similar to ANOVA, and indeed is based on ANOVA in the way it is computed. It can also be used to evaluate test-
retest performance. I.e. it does not need to be two separate evaluators, but one evaluator who measures more than once.
Conclusion
Reliability can be evaluated for nominal data using Cohen’s Kappa, and for ordinal/interval data using the ICCC. ICCC 
can also be used for more than two assessors.
Exercise
Use the “pu” dataset. Do a kappa and ICCC on these variables to compare nurse 1 with nurse 3.

Internal reliability 
Introduction
Many questionnaires are designed to measure a construct or constructs. For example the SF-36 is a 36 item questionnaire 
that measures eight health constructs:-
• 
limitations in physical activities because of health problems
• 
limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems
• 
limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems
• 
bodily pain
• 
general mental health (psychological distress and well-being)
• 
limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems
• 
vitality (energy and fatigue)
• 
general health perceptions.
How would you show that the tool actually measures the constructs? There are many aspects to this, for example you 
could show the questions to experts and ask if they consider the questions at face value to be valid (face validity). You 
could also see if the various questions that are allegedly measuring the same construct actually agree with each other. 
This is a different measure of validity. 
Let us consider an example. If four questions purport to measure some construct, then it would be strange if three 
questions were highly correlated with each other, and one of them was not at all correlated with the others. That would 
be more consistent with the proposition that three of the questions measure the construct (or some construct) and the 
other is measuring something else altogether. We do need to be careful, as it is entirely possible for different things to be 
correlated to each other yet not measure a single construct. For example age and visual acuity are correlated, in the sense 
that as one ages, vision generally deteriorates. However you would be a bit bothered if your optician tested your eyes 
by asking your age. Clearly while related, age and visual acuity are not the same construct. But while not sufficient, it is 
necessary for variables to be correlated if they are said to be measuring the same construct. 
Here we will look at a method of assessing whether a tool is likely to be measuring a given construct.
Validity
Validity is a highly important, though often overlooked aspect of any study, whether quantitative (inferential or descriptive) 
or qualitative. Validity refers to whether you are measuring, recording, observing or assessing the appropriate items; in 
other words, are the data relevant? 
“I would rather be vaguely right, than precisely wrong”  - John Maynard Keynes (Cairncross, 1996).

Internal reliability 
If you wanted to measure poverty, an economist might suggest you could collect data on income, which may be available 
and be both reliable and accurate. However, while highly relevant to poverty, income is not the full story. Two people 
on the same income could be in very different positions. One might be in an area that has much cheaper living costs for 
example. A sociologist might suggest you consider how many items, considered by a set of focus groups to be indicative 
of poverty a group of people possesses. Various such alternative measures of poverty that are not purely based on raw 
income have been suggested (another is a subsistence measure, i.e. whether a person can afford a basket of necessary 
foodstuffs; and another is a relative measure based on half or some fraction of the median income). All these measures 
have problems but, arguably, most or all of them are more valid than simply counting income.
Validity is the determination of the extent to which an instrument actually reflects  the (often abstract) construct being 
examined. There are several ‘common sense’ methods of dealing with validity. The way in which validity is defined varies 
between the texts. 
Bryman & Cramer (Bryman and Cramer, 1997) discuss validity in the following terms. 
• Face validity: where an item appears a priori to be sensible for inclusion in, say, a questionnaire.  
• 
Construct validity. This is where the ability to measure some trait is used. If, for example, the intelligence of 
students studying for a doctorate compared with that of students who failed to obtain university entry did not 
differ according to some new scale of intelligence, then you might suspect that the scale was not valid.
• 
Concurrent validity. This applies when the researcher employs a test on groups known to differ and in a way 
relevant to the concept under study.
• 
Predictive validity. This applies where a test is applied and the subject group is followed up to determine whether 
the test can predict those subjects who will develop some condition.
• 
Convergent validity. This is a more general term. It includes the above measures of validity and refers to the 
process whereby the measure is tested for harmonization with some pre-existing measure. However, Bryman 
& Cramer note that using different methods is more useful than the more common application of convergent 
validity testing where similar methods (e.g. two questionnaires) are employed.
• Divergent validity. The idea here is that measures of different concepts should not correspond with each other; 
in other words, the measures discriminate.

Internal reliability 
All the above descriptions of validity are open to some question, but it is nonetheless useful to consider them. For 
example, it is possible for a group of experts to be wrong about the relevance of an item (content validity), as there may 
be systematic errors in the field. Consider the field of medicine, where a normal pineal or adrenal gland was taken to 
be a symptom of disease (due to the practise of doing post-mortems on the poor, who had enlarged adrenal and pineal 
glands). Construct validity is not necessarily disproven by doctoral students being shown to be of similar intellect to 
students unable to gain entry to university; perhaps the doctoral students were from a privileged background rather than 
inherently more intelligent. A new highly superior measuring device may not show much similarity with an inferior older 
device; furthermore, perhaps the older device was itself not valid. However, the least that can be said if experts consider 
your questionnaire items irrelevant or badly formed, or if a pilot sample cannot understand your questionnaire, or if there 
is no difference found between two groups where you expect a difference, or if your instrument is not even similar to a 
well tried and trusted device, is that you should seriously consider the validity of your instrument (be it a questionnaire, 
a physical measurement device or an interview question).
Internal reliability
The validity measures described above are examples of external reliability. However, in a questionnaire, for example, you 
might want to see if the items within the questionnaire are measuring the same thing, i.e. whether they show internal 
reliability.

Internal reliability 
If you want to measure an attitude, for example, then you might have a questionnaire with several questions that aim to 
address this particular aspect. The reason for asking more than one question would typically be to gain a more accurate 
measure by averaging responses over several items, thus reducing the possibility of single idiosyncratic responses unduly 
affecting the measure. This is similar in concept to asking many questions in an examination (say a multiple choice 
examination), where all the questions concern the same subject; an average of these forms a better basis for assessment 
than asking one question.
You would want the questions in the attitude (or knowledge) questionnaire to show some correlation with each other, for 
if they did not then they are probably not measuring the same thing. A new questionnaire should be checked for internal 
reliability, or homogeneity. Various methods exist, of which the most common are split-half and Cronbach’s α. In either 
case a value close to zero indicates that the questions are not addressing the same item, and a value near 1 means that 
they are. Values over about 0.7-0.8 are generally considered adequate. If you obtain low values for internal reliability then 
you should probably remove some items.
Note: You might consider that what is described here as internal reliability is really internal validity, as we are exploring 
the relevance of items to be included in a cluster of items that are to measure some construct. I have some sympathy with 
this view, and in some texts you may see the measures described below classified as measures of validity. However, I am 
following the terminology used in both SPSS and several texts e.g. (Bryman and Cramer, 2009, Bryman and Cramer, 1997).
Cronbach α
Cronbach α considers all the correlations among all the variables and reports the average of these. Thus it is not sensitive 
to the ordering of variables, and may be considered a robust measure. It is a very commonly seen test for internal reliability 
in the literature, and is the default in SPSS.
A coefficient of 1.0 indicates perfect agreement among the items (i.e. they all measure exactly the same thing) and logically, 
therefore, all but one could be removed from the instrument. A coefficient of zero indicates no agreement at all among the 
items. Thus the items are not measuring the same thing, and are therefore not useful if being used as a battery of variables 
to measure some attribute. A high coefficient (typically above 0.7) shows that the variables are probably measuring the 
same thing, and are plausible for use as a cluster of variables to measure an attribute.
Note that these measures of internal reliability do not prove or disprove that collections of variables are useful measures 
of an attribute. It would be possible to use a set of variables that are internally reliable but measure something completely 
different to what you wanted to measure. A set of questions meant to measure depression could, for example, be measuring 
anxiety.

Internal reliability 
Example
In a survey of online course students the following questions were asked:-
How confident are you using computers?
How often have you used the Web?
How often have you used email?
How often have you used Word?
How often have you accessed the online course?
The question is, if this one question that could be summarised as how computer literate is this student, using several way 
to find out? Or is this more than one question, and if so how many?
We could do a correlation analysis of each variable with each other variable. see Table 45. What is clear is that use of the 
Web, email and Word are correlated with each other. But while there is a significant correlation between use of each of 
the web and email with confidence in using computers, the value of the correlation coefficient is small. The correlation 
between confidence and use of Word is not even significant. Access to the online module is highly correlated to confidence 
in using computers, but not to any of the other variables.

Exercise 
Why did I use Spearman and not Pearson’s correlation?
In a Cronbach α analysis each variable is correlated with each other and an average correlation is computed. To set up an 
α analysis use Analyze -> Scale -> Reliability Analysis.
Now we need to decide which variables to include, this is shown in Figure 107.

Internal reliability 
The output of this test is seen in Table 46. A value of 0.8 is considered acceptable for Cronbach α, but here we see much 
lower figure of 0.5 (rounded up from 0.455). Thus by conventional standards these five questions are not measuring the 
same construct.

We saw that two items were less correlated with the other variables. What happens if we remove them. Table 47 show 
Cronbach α for three variables:-
• 
How often have you used the Web?
• 
How often have you used email?
• 
How often have you used Word?

Note that by ditching two variables the value is now roughly at the level needed, 0.8. 
Conclusion
Validity assesses the relevance of the items in your research tool, i.e. whether they measure what they are supposed to 
measure. Internal reliability is concerned with the correct clustering of items designed to measure the same construct.
Exercise
Load the datafile “assets”. Use the twelve asset subscores, gravity factor and age to compute a Cronbach α. Repeat this 
analysis but with age added, and then again with gravity added and age removed. What do you infer from these analyses.

Introduction
Measurements taken on a subject may be correlated. This means that there is a certain amount of redundancy in the data. 
In most real world problems there comes a point where adding a new variable tells us very little further about the subject. 
In extreme cases a variable may add no new information at all, in which case it is not necessary or even useful. However 
it is not always obvious which variables contain the most information. This unit discusses methods of reducing data to 
the minimum number of variables, while keeping the maximum amount of information.
In chapter 14 we evaluated whether an instrument measured a construct, and decided that in at least one case the 
instrument measured more than one construct, and removing certain items made the internal reliability (Cronbach’s ά) 
higher. But suppose you have a set of data and want to know how many constructs it contains, rather than measuring 
how well it measures one construct?
One way is using factor analysis, or a particular case of factor analysis, principal components analysis. 
PCA and the related method of FA are methods of data reduction. A simple and straightforward account is given by 
Hammond (1995) and a more detailed introduction to its use in SPSS is given by Field (2009). PCA is used to remove 
data that are either irrelevant or contain little useful information for the task at hand. It is best illustrated by an example.
Consider collecting data to describe the size of a human body. One could take a (potentially infinitely) large number of 
cross-sections, ending up with a huge data set that defines the individual body, but this is impractical in most situations. 
Thus one might choose anatomical lengths, or other data such as
1.	 left arm
2.	 right arm
3.	 left inside leg
4.	 right inside leg
5.	 head circumference

Factor analysis 
6.	 waist
7.	 chest
8.	 hips
9.	 weight
10.	age
11.	sex
But do we need all these items? Data may be:
• 
Redundant. The left and right sides of the body are virtually the same, so why measure both?
• 
Correlated. Chest and waist size are correlated, so if you know one a plausible guess can be made for the other
• 
Irrelevant. Possibly age is not useful if we only consider adults.
If irrelevant redundant data are removed then no loss of accuracy occurs. If correlated data are removed some accuracy 
is lost, but this may be acceptable. PCA is a method by which data that are not working for us are removed.	
There is some confusion in the texts between PCA and FA. The latter is a method of obtaining meaningful factors from a 
data set. These factors are produced by combining the variables of the original dataset, and are typically fewer in number 
than the original variables. PCA is one specific method of obtaining factors. It is the method favoured by most researchers 
using FA, but there are other methods. This chapter will concentrate on FA using principal components and, unless stated to 
the contrary, in this chapter the terms FA and PCA will be considered as synonymous (as is often the case in the literature).

Factor analysis 
PCA is related to correlation. In fact the analysis starts by producing a correlation matrix of all the variables. If two variables 
are highly correlated then one can probably be removed and still keep most of the information. By this I mean that, as 
one variable seems to be largely predictable from another, you only need to keep one. For example, if a particular serum 
value A was almost always about twice another serum value B, then reporting both is largely unnecessary, because if you 
know B then A = 2 B. You will only be able to get back all the lost data if the variables are totally correlated; however, a 
small loss of data is often acceptable, and an absolute correlation of less than 1.0 (i.e. > -1 and < + 1) that is close to unity 
(i.e. much nearer to 1.0  or -1.0 than 0.0) may allow you to remove a variable with little loss of information. For example, 
a measurement of the left arm is likely to be very slightly different from one of the right arm, but we would accept either 
one, or the mean value of both as an accurate measure of arm length for most purposes.
One variable may be partially correlated with several other variables. Thus a variable may not be strongly correlated with 
one variable, but is predictable from several taken together.
We usually view the variables in PCA as dimensions. This is analogous with spatial dimensions. Indeed the analogy is quite 
helpful in understanding PCA. 1 will now give some examples of physical dimensional systems (i.e. three-dimensional 
space, two-dimensional areas, one-dimensional lines), not because they are realistic representations of what we will 
perform PCA on, but because conceptually they are easy to understand. I will then extend the concept to other systems 
where the dimensions are not physical, but relate to any variables.
Suppose I am flying in a plane. To know my location you would need three dimensions: longitude, latitude and altitude. 
However, if I am sailing you would not need my altitude as it will always be (by the definition of sea level) zero. Thus my 
position is predicted from two dimensions: longitude and latitude. Now suppose I am driving along the Ml (a motorway 
linking London and the North of England, which passes near to my home Leicester) and I ask my passenger how far we are 
from home, they would only need one figure: the miles or kilometres to (in my case) Leicester. I still have three dimensions 
of travel, but only one is needed in this case, as the other two are constrained to be along the route of the motorway.
The above are pretty straightforward examples of dimension. However what if I were walking over the hilly park near my 
home. Assume you do not have a map with contours, if you knew my longitude and latitude very accurately you still do 
not know exactly where I am, as I may be up a hill or down a valley. However, your estimate of my exact position would 
be very close, as Leicestershire is not mountainous and, at most, I will be a couple of hundred metres away.
A further example is if you only had the time I had been gone to estimate where on a walk I might be. Since, from 
experience, you know I usually walk at a brisk rate of 3 miles per hour, you could use this to predict where I could be. 
However, you could be wrong for a variety of reasons, as I may walk a bit slower or faster, depending on the weather, 
my mood, etc. So time is correlated with distance, but the correlation is not entirely reliable. One could nevertheless use 
such a one-dimensional data set (time gone) to give an approximation of where I am. If I were known to stop for a pint 
in the village pub on the way home if I were thirsty, then knowing how thirsty I was to start with may add some useful 
information to the estimate of when I will return. However, it is possible that this information is not an accurate or sensitive 
measure, as it may be more dependent on who I see in the pub when I get there, which determines whether or not I stay.
The above examples are contrived and possibly rather silly, but are used to show:

Factor analysis 
1.	 A system may be under-defined. If I want to describe a student’s academic ability I may have examination 
and course marks, but is it clear that I have enough? Suppose I only have one mark. It may not be 
representative of the student’s work. This mark could be seen as one dimension of the student’s work. This 
is a similar problem to only knowing when I left the house for my walk. However, even though the data are 
not ideal, they probably serve as the best estimate I have, and so are not useless.
2.	 A system may be over-defined. Even if three dimensions are available, they are not necessarily all needed. 
This could be extended to any three (or any number of) variables, not just physical dimensions. In the 
student assessment problem, I may have several marks from different courses and over many years. 
Therefore, adding another mark from a new assessed work may not make much difference to my assessment 
of the student, so why am I collecting such data?
3.	 The dimensions should be independent. In working out a location in space, three properly chosen 
dimensions are needed. These are the three coordinates (length, breadth and height; or longitude, latitude 
and altitude). It is not possible to work out longitude from latitude or altitude, or any combination of these. 
If it were, then at least one dimension would be redundant, and could be disposed of.
In the sailing example, being given my altitude is useless as it is redundant as it will always be zero; a two-dimensional 
system (longitude and latitude) is equally as good as one that adds altitude. So if a parameter is constant, for example all 
the sample are of a similar age (e.g. a sample of first-year undergraduates), then the data on age are not likely to tell us 
anything extra. In the walking example, a two-dimensional system (longitude and latitude) is almost as good as the three-
dimensional one. In the example where you only know how long I have been gone, a one-dimensional system (time) is a 
lot better than nothing, adding more data (thirst) helps, but may not be enough to be very useful. Thus, if we were paying 
for information, we would buy the time data, and only purchase the thirst data if it were very cheap.
A real-world example of data that is amenable to PCA analysis is compression of image data. There are many ways of 
reducing the amount of image data. You could simply send only half of the available data, which will give a more grainy 
image. However rather than simply throwing away half the data, you might try to work out which data contain the most 
information, and send the half (or some proportion) that contains the most. Images are divided into pixels, or points of 
light intensity. If an image is 100 pixels high and 100 pixels wide it contains 10 000 pixels, each of which can be viewed 
as a dimension. So we have 10 000 dimensions, where each dimension can be any value between (say) zero and 255. You 
could remove alternate rows and columns of pixels to reduce the data set, in this case to a quarter of the original size. 
You would probably get a better picture if you took some form of average of four adjacent points (in fact the median is 
usually used as it preserves lines better than the mean, this is known as median filtering). In this case we have reduced 
the dimensions from 10,000 to 2500, thus preserving (we hope) more information by combining the variables rather than 
simply throwing three-quarters of the data away. However, is median filtering optimal?
PCA would approach this problem by looking at the 10 000 dimensions of a sample of many pictures and work out what 
the correlations are among the pixels. It would then work out the best combination of variables to form a smaller number 
of new variables from the original data set that contain as much information as possible. In practice there are other more 
efficient algorithms used to compress image data, but PCA could be used.

PCA is indicated when:
• 
there are many variables that are correlated
• 
the aim is to reduce the number of variables used to describe the data (i.e. when data compression is useful)
Technique
A correlation matrix is computed for all the variables that form the data set. It can be shown that a set of new variables, 
called eigenvectors, can be created that completely describe the correlation matrix, but these new variables are independent 
of each other (i.e. they are not correlated with each other). In a data set where some of the variables are totally redundant, 
the eigenvectors will be fewer in number than the original variables, but will contain exactly the same information. In 
general, however, for a data set with N variables, there will be, at most, N eigenvectors. The amount of information in 
each eigenvector, as measured by the amount of variance in the data set it describes, is not in general the same; some 
eigenvectors explain more variance than others, and may be said to contain more information.

Factor analysis 
Each eigenvector has an associated eigenvalue, which is the measure of the amount of variance in the data set it describes. 
If all the eigenvalues are summed, then the ratio of each eigenvalue to this sum is the proportion of the variance for 
which it accounts. Thus a sensible strategy for reducing the number of the variables in the data set is to take the first few 
eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues. The algorithm for PCA can be described as follows:
1.	 Obtain eigenvectors of the correlation matrix
2.	 Arrange eigenvectors in decreasing order of their associated eigenvalues 
3.	 Take the most important eigenvectors to describe the data.
While these steps can be achieved quite simply using mathematical packages such as Matlab, SPSS will do the analysis 
automatically for you.
An example of factor analysis
Using the prison database, to conduct a factor analysis we use Analyze -> Dimension Reduction -> Factor.
This will give us a dialogue box as in Figure 108. Here I have asked for all the symptoms to be included.
Figure 108: Dialogue box for factor analysis
This results in a table (Table 48). By default SPSS considers all factors with an eigenvalue more than 1.0 (this is called 
Kaiser’s criterion). Here there are two, between them accounting for more than half of the variance, with less than half 
accounted for by the other seven.

Factor analysis 
However while a scree plot is probably better than Kaiser, both tend to give too many factors. I would advise the method 
proposed by Pallant (2010) of parallel analysis. 
Why do Kaiser’s criterion and scree plots keep too many factors. How do we know this? If you create a load of random 
data and compute the factors in it, then all the factors should be rubbish, since factors of random data should not be 
meaningful. If you look at the highest eigenvalue then this should be where rubbish factors start. Just to be sure, let us take 
many random sets and take the average highest eigenvalue. You have now conducted parallel analysis. Parallel analysis 
usually returns fewer factors than the other two methods.
The Monte Carlo (www.allenandunwin.com/spss3/Files/MonteCarloPA.zip ) program asks you for the number of variables, 
subjects and replications. Pallant suggests the replications be set to 1000 (the number of random sets) and number of 
variables here is nine, with 494 subjects (see Figure 111), we get Figure 112. This indicates any factor with an eigenvalue 
below 1.21 is likely to be “noise”.  This means that my interpretation of factor two might be pointless, since it is quite likely 
to be simply random nonsense. Pity as it seemed to make sense! But that’s life.

Factor analysis 
The default position for SPSS is straightforward principal components analysis (PCA) whereby the derived factors are 
all orthogonal to each other, i.e. each factor is independent of each other factor. However sometimes these principal 
components do not have obvious interpretations, and we may relax the strict requirement for orthogonality to create 
more meaningful factors. These rotations attempt to create factors that have variables load or not load more obviously 
than with strict PCA. A common method is varimax, and this is obtained as in Figure 109.

Conclusion
Factor analysis is used to reduce variables in a dataset to a smaller number of variables. While sometimes the factors 
derived are difficult to interpret, and the exact number of factors can be difficult to ascertain, it remains a useful method 
to explore data. It may also be used in a confirmatory analysis, to determine if the factors identified in one dataset remain 
those in a new dataset. For example an instrument used in one culture may not work in the same way in another

Introduction
Suppose you want to be able to predict one variable given one or more other variables. For example the severity of sentencing 
we know has something to do with age, asset score and gravity of the offence. Could we predict the likely sentence given 
these values? Linear regression is a technique that attempts to give the best guess for one variable given several others. For 
example an older offender with multiple problems (drug dependency, difficulty in dealing with aggression) and having 
committed a serious offence is clearly more likely to receive a custodial sentence than a small child found shoplifting on 
the first occasion.
Simple linear regression explores possible relationships among data of a linear nature, i.e. where the relationship can 
be modelled as a straight line. As an example of a linear relationship consider  Figure 114 which shows a plot of inches 
against centimetres. For any value in inches, you can read off the corresponding value in centimetres, and vice versa,.

You can see that 10 inches (inches are on the x axis) corresponds to about 25 centimetres (on the y axis). In fact we do 
not even need the graph, as the following formula gives the exact relationship:
Centimetres = 2.54 x inches
Note the following aspects of this graph:
• 
The relationship is exact, if you know the value in inches then you know the precise value in centimetres
• 
Zero inches is also zero centimetres, so the line goes through the origin of the graph (x = 0, y = 0).
• 
The relationship is a straight line; another word for this is linear. 
• 
The relationship is positive, i.e. as the number of inches increases so does the number of centimetres.
It is possible to construct relationships that obey none of the above. For example, consider the relationship between the 
dose of a drug that slows the heart beat and pulse rate, see Figure 115.

Linear Regression
• The relationship is not exact, you cannot predict with certainty that a given dose will result in a particular pulse 
rate. This is because a patient’s pulse depends on other factors (exercise, stress, time of day, etc.). However, the 
drug does, on average, exert a measurable effect; it is simply that we cannot be absolutely sure of its precise effect.
• 
If no drug is given the heart still beats, so if the relationship could be modelled as a straight line it would not 
go through the origin, as zero drug is not associated with zero heart beat (fortunately).
• 
The relationship need not be linear, and definitely will not be outside a certain range. For if the dose takes the 
heart beat too low the patient may die, resulting in a pulse rate of zero, but a still higher dose cannot give a 
lower pulse rate.
• 
If the drug dose is increased the heart beat slows down more. The relationship is negative.
The relationship is shown graphically in Figure 115. Note that three of the above features are evident by inspection:
• 
The relationship is not exact. While there is an overall trend observable (as the drug dose is increased the heart 
rate decreases (shown by the straight line)), the actual drug dose and pulse values (the small squares) do not 
lie on the line, but are scattered around it.
• 
The line that best fits the relationship (the straight line) does not go through the origin.
• 
The slope of the line is negative, i.e. as the dose is increased the pulse rate decreases.
You will probably recognize the graph in Figure 115 as a scatterplot. It shows that the two variables are correlated. Regression 
is based on correlation, and uses the correlation coefficient to produce the straight line that gives the best guess of what 
one variable will be, given the value of the other. For example, if no drug is given we would expect the heart rate to be 
96 beats/min; in fact we record it was 95. We would guess that a dose of 0.4 mg would result in a heart rate of about 70 
beats/min, but we may record a different pulse rate. However, it is clear that 70 beats/min would be a better estimate than 
(say) 110 beats/min, as none of the patients with such high pulses are receiving doses as high as 0.4 mg: the three patients 
with a pulse rate of 100-110 beats/min are receiving doses of 0.05-0.15 mg, whereas patients with a pulse rate of 60-70 
beats/min are receiving doses above 0.3 mg. Therefore, while the prediction is inexact, it is still helpful.
Linear regression
In the above examples you may have wondered how we decided where to draw the straight line through the points. You 
may also wonder whether it is even appropriate to draw such a line, in other words are we deluding ourselves that there 
is a relationship between the drug dose and pulse rate? It is the technique of linear regression that answers both these 
questions. 
Linear regression has three main outputs:
• The probability that the straight line that describes the relationship between the two variables is purely down 
to chance. I.e. a low p value shows it is probably a real effect 
• 
The slope of the line
• 
The point where the line crosses the x axis

Linear Regression
If you know where the line crosses the x axis, and how steep (the slope) the line is, you can draw the line. There is a very 
simple equation that defines any straight line:
y = (Slope times x) + Constant
where the constant is the value of y at which the line crosses the y axis (Le. the value of y when x = 0); this is also called 
the intercept. You will often see this equation written as
y = mx + c,
where c is the constant and m is the slope.
	
In the inches and centimetres example (Fig. 7.1), the equation is
Centimetres = 2.54 x Inches + 0
i.e. the slope of the line is 2.54, and the constant is zero. While you may find reading the value off the graph easier than 
working it out from the formula, in fact the equation and the graph are identical in the information they contain.
Conditions
Regression makes the following requirements of the data:
• 
Normality. Regression is a parametric test, and assumes that the data are normally distributed.
• Linearity. A linear relation exists between the dependent and independent variables. Thus it is sensible to model 
the relationship as a straight line.
• 
Independence. The data should have been drawn independently. In the drug dose versus pulse rate example 
above, several pulse readings from the same person should not have been used.
• 
Unexplained variance. The portion of the variance of the dependent variable not explained by the independent 
variable is due to random error and follows a normal distribution. The regression module in SPSS allows the 
option of saving the residuals (the difference between the predicted values according to the regression equation 
and the actual values). These residuals can be checked for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (for 
example) or can be shown as a histogram. The data should not exhibit heteroscedasticity, where the scatter 
around the line of best fit varies a lot as one proceeds along the line. Figure 115 shows no apparent change in 
scatter as you move along the best fit, and thus shows little or no heteroscedasticity.

Linear Regression
LIMITATIONS TO REGRESSION
Regression is a powerful technique for prediction. There are, however, some limitations to the technique:
• The prediction based on linear regression is not necessarily correct, or even guaranteed to be close. It is simply 
the best guess on the information available.
• 
The fact that two or more variables are correlated does not necessarily imply causation. You should have a 
theoretical rationale for how one variable might predict another before using regression to calculate a predicted 
value.
• 
The regression equation may fail outside of the range of values from which it was constructed. For example, 
based on the regression analysis of for the heart drug where the values of the dose ranged from 0 to 0.5 mg, a 
very high drug dose of (say) 5 mg may not produce 10 times the reduction in pulse over the pulse that a dose 
of 0.5 mg produces (just as well).
Example predicting sentence outcome
Using the asset data we have considered now a few times, let us see if we can predict the sentence outcome from the asset 
sub-scores alone.  After Regression ->  Linear Figure 116 show you how to choose linear regression and pick the variable 
you are trying to predict (dependent variable) and the variables used to predict it (independent variables).

a  Dependent Variable: Rank outcome
However note that many of the above are not significant, for example Physical health has a p value of 0.612. Why would 
we include a variable that is not even significant? We can redo the regression using the “Stepwise” method (select this 
option instead of “Enter” in Figure 116).
What happens here is that each variable is entered but only kept if it is significant in the sense that it adds to the equation 
in terms of prediction over and above what is already in the equation. Here in Table 55 you can see each variable entered, 
but in Table 56 you can see the R2 for each variable added. Table 57 and Table 58 show the ANOVA and beta values for each 
entry of the new variable. Table 59 shows the final excluded variables and Table 60 the final variables kept in the equation.

a  Dependent Variable: Rank outcome
The regression equation can be used to predict what you would expect each case to be based on the equation. This can 
be saved into a new variable. It is obtained via the dialogue box in Figure 117.

Linear Regression
Figure 117: Predicted values
We can see that this gives a reasonable prediction as in Figure 118 the predicted ranks are broadly in agreement with the 
actual ones. But note that there are a wide range within each actual outcome of the predicted outcome. I.e. the predictions 
are not perfect, and (e.g.) for third (worst) outcome the range of predictions goes down to 1.5 (somewhere between first 
and second rank) and just over 3 (third rank).

Linear Regression
Conclusion
Linear regression allows you to predict one variable (outcome) from one or more other variables (in this case risk factors).
Exercise
Using gravity as your outcome to be predicted, and asset scores as variables, compute a regression analysis, then perform 
it and interpret it.

Logistic regression
17	Logistic regression
Introduction
In the last chapter we looked at linear regression, where we tried to predict one outcome (variable) from one or more 
parameters (other variables). This works if the outcome is at least ordinal. What if the outcome is nominal, in particular 
a binary outcome such as yes or no? Then we need to use another type of regression called logistic regression. 
Sometimes what we wish to predict is the occurrence or non-occurrence of some event. Certain types of patients suffer 
from pressure sores much more than other groups (e.g. those with poor nutrition). However we cannot do a regression for 
nutritional status (as measured by serum albumin, for example) against pressure sore, because a patient can have a sore or 
not, but cannot have 0.5 of a sore. In other words, the presence or absence of a sore is nominal data and thus cannot be 
normally distributed (this concept being meaningless for nominal data). Therefore, as it stands, regression is inappropriate.
There is a form of regression, called logistic regression that can be used where the dependent variable is dichotomous, 
i.e. can take two values. In the pressure sore case, a sore can exist (we could label this 1) or not exist (we could label this 
0). Logistic regression returns a probability, in this case of whether the sore will occur or not.
Example asset scores (again)
In the last chapter we regressed asset sub-scores against the level of sentence severity. Suppose however all we are interested 
in is whether the young person received a custodial sentence or not. We coded this as a third order outcome, which was 
called outcome.
I am going to regress sentence against asset sub-scores by first using Regression -> Binary Logistic. I enter third order 
outcome as dependent and all the sub-scores as covariates, see Figure 119.

As in linear regression the output (after several steps and a lot of tables) shows me the significance (p value) of each 
variable (co-variate) see Table 62. But many of these are not significant, so why use them?

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Linear regression predicts the numerical value of an outcome. But with binary outcomes we can state how many are 
correct, and additionally we can give a probability of getting the binary outcome. Here we may have a probability close 
to zero which would suggest the young person will not get a custodial sentence, and close to one meaning s/he will. We 
can get both these predictions by choosing to in a dialogue box under Save (Figure 122).

The test result variable(s): Predicted probability has at least one tie between the positive actual state group and the 
negative actual state group. Statistics may be biased.
What if we add some more variables, say ethnic group. Ethnicity is a nominal variable, so we cannot simply put it in 
the equation. For if we code Asian as 1, White as 4, then it does not follow that Black (2) or Mixed race (3) are in any 
meaningful way between White and Asian. However we can make “dummy variables” for each ethnic group. 
To create a dummy variable first let us consider if we had two groups, say Asian and Black, then one variable is needed, 
it could be coded 1 if the subject is Asian, otherwise 0 if Black. So two groups one variable.  If we had three groups, say 
Asian, Black and Mixed, then you might think three new variables are needed, Asian (0 or 1), Mixed (0 or 1) or Black 
(0 or 1). But if you had two variables Asian (0/1) and Mixed (0/1) then if both were zero then you know the subject is 
not Asian or Black, so must be Mixed. Similarly if there are four groups, now including White, you need three variables 
– Asian, Black and Mixed, for if all three were zero, then the subject must be White.

While you can do this manually SPSS has a method for logistic regressions (but not linear regression) which is to state the 
covariate is categorical (a synonym for nominal). If I put variable eth  into the covariate and then click on Categorical I 
get the dialogue box as in Figure 125. Normally you would choose the reference category to be the most common. Here 
it is White, and this is the last (1=Asian, 2=Black, 3 Mixed and 4 White).

Conclusion
Regression is a technique for predicting one dependent variable from one (simple linear regression) or more (multiple 
regression) independent variables. It makes assumptions about the data (e.g. normality and linearity), and the results 
may be nonsensical if there is no clear reason why a causal relationship should exist. If the dependent variable is binary 
(e.g. yes/no, on/off, male/female) then logistic regression may be employed to determine the probability of one or other 
value of the variable being obtained.
Logistic regression allows us to predict the likelihood of a binary outcome based on many variables, including other binary 
variables (here we used ethnic group).

Cluster analysis
Introduction
A method of splitting data into natural clusters is named cluster analysis. The aim of cluster analysis is to investigate the 
underlying structure of the data. For a fuller treatment on cluster analysis see Everitt (1980).
As an illustration life on Earth could be split into the animal kingdom, the plant kingdom, fungi, and microorganisms 
(bacteria, viruses). Animals can be further split into chordates (having a backbone) and several other phyla, for example 
echinoderms (starfish, etc.). These large categories can be split into smaller ones, for example mammals are part of the 
chordates and reptiles are another group.
There are two ways of performing a hierarchical cluster analysis. One method is to group variables, the idea here being to 
decide which variables are close to each other and how the variables group together. In the second method, individuals in 
the sample are placed into clusters. Later in this chapter an example is given of each of these ways of doing a cluster analysis.
Individuals can be allocated into groups (or clusters) on the basis of how ‘close’ they are to each other. We would naturally 
say that pigs are closer to humans than, say, crocodiles. But apes are closer to humans than pigs. But on what basis is 
this measure of ‘closeness’ made? One measure would be the percentage of DNA each species has in common. If, for 
example, on this basis chimpanzees and humans were 95% the same, and some other ape was 90% the same as humans, 
then we would say that chimpanzees were closer to humans than some other ape (say orang-utans). It is noted that a 
different form of measuring closeness might give a totally different taxonomy. Suppose we have features that measure 
how an animal feeds, humans might then be seen as very close to pigs (both omnivores) and more different from gorillas 
(strict vegetarians). Thus the taxonomy is highly dependent on our measures (called metrics) which should be chosen to 
identify the feature of interest, which itself may not be straightforward or obvious.
We could put humans, chimps and other apes in one cluster (primates), and dogs, pigs, cats and horses in other clusters. 
These all fit into a supercluster (mammals) and all mammals along with reptiles and most fish go into chordates, which 
themselves go with elasmobranches (sharks) and echinoderms (starfish etc.) into the animal kingdom, which is quite 
separate from, say, bacteria. Finally, even bacteria and humans are related, as they have a common ancestor (something 
like algae about 3.5 billion years ago). If life were to be found on Mars, it would probably be even further removed from 
us than bacteria. This form of clustering is hierarchical, in the sense that not only are there different groups (clusters) but 
there is also a natural ordering and depth of clusters and relationships between clusters.
Cluster analysis places cases into classes. It can be used in similar applications as principal component analysis (PCA) and 
factor analysis (FA) to identify the groupings wiithin a data set. Cluster analysis can be used in exploratory data analysis.

Cluster analysis
Cluster analysis can be used to group individual cases into discrete groups. It uses some method of determining how 
close two individuals are using the metric or distance (see below) and individuals that are close to each other based on 
this metric are said to be in same group. Grouping can be:- 
• In a cascade, or hierarchy, or taxonomy. All items belong in one super-ordinate or general group, which is 
broken down into smaller and smaller subgroups. The investigator does not state how many groups there are.
• 
Non-hierarchical. The investigator states how many groups there are and the program assigns items to groups 
depending on how similar they are to each other. 
While the investigator may need to state the number of clusters that will be found, this should be done on a theoretical 
basis. The investigator will also need to be able to interpret the clusters once they have been located, and this can be difficult.
  Cluster analysis is typically used for exploration of data, and tasks suitable to cluster analysis include:
• 
finding a typology
• 
model fitting
• 
prediction based on groups
• 
hypothesis testing
• 
hypothesis generation
• 
data reduction.
Hierarchical methods
Data are not partitioned into groups in one go, but are grouped into broad classes. The method typically used is 
agglomerative, whereby cases that are near to each other are placed in the same cluster. The distances between the clusters 
may then be calculated, and nearer clusters are placed in super-clusters, etc. The algorithm is as follows:
1.	 Compute differences between items
2.	 Fuse items that are nearest
3.	 Go to step 1 until all items or subgroups are in one large group.
There are several options about how to merge items or clusters. In nearest neighbour clustering, groups are fused according 
to the distance between nearest neighbours, i.e. close cases or clusters are put together. In centroid clustering, groups are 
depicted as lying in Euclidean space, and a group is said to lie where the centroid of the group lies. Median clustering is 
where groups are merged, and the new position is the median of the values of the old groups.

Metrics
If clusters are formed by merging close members, there has to be a measure of what closeness is. A metric is a measure 
of how close (or far apart) two individuals are. Metrics have the following features, where d(x,y) is the distance between 
x and y:
• d(x,y) ≥ 0: the distance between x and y is either zero or positive (like ordinary distances); in particular, d(x,y) 
= 0 implies x = y, and vice versa. If the distance between two objects is zero, they must be in the same place.
• 
d(x,y) = d(y,x): the distance between x and y is the same as the distance between y and x.
• 
d(x,y) + d(y,z) ≥ d(x,z): the distance between x and y added to the distance between y to z can never be less 
than the distance between x and z.
There are many metrics, but typically the simple Euclidean distance coefficient is used. For one dimension (variable), with 
two values x1 and x2, this is just the distance
d = x1 – x2
For two dimensions, with values (x11,x12) and (x21,xX22), this is the pythagorian distance
d =  √((x11-x21)2+ (x12-xX22)2)

Cluster analysis
In general two items can be measured in N dimensions, That is, N variables are used to represent each item. 
d =  √((x11-x21)2+ (x12-xX22)2+ (x13-xX23)2) + …… + (x1N-xX2N)2)
This is difficult to visualise for more than two or three dimensions, but the arithmetic is simple.
Non-hierarchical methods
In this form of clustering only one level of clusters is allowed, and the technique splits data into several clusters that do 
not overlap. Often you need to specify how many clusters you expect in the beginning. An example of non-hierarchical 
clustering is k-means clustering 
Optimization techniques
These techniques are usually non-hierarchical. Again the number of groups is typically determined by the investigator and 
data are partitioned so as to optimize some predefined numerical measure (metric), as above. However, these techniques 
are typically iterative and involve large amounts of computing. Examples of optimization are unsupervised neural networks 
(e.g. Kohonen nets). Optimization is not necessarily going to produce a solution, and may give slightly different results 
on each run, and in some techniques the results can be totally different in some runs. Neural networks, for example, can 
get into ‘local minima’ and fail to reach a solution.
Density search techniques
In this technique cases are displayed on a graph, and areas of high density that are surrounded by more diffuse areas are 
considered to be clusters. This can be done by visual inspection.
Example 1: Hierarchical clustering
Using a new paediatric risk assessment score for, we would like to see if the variables form clusters. Use datafile 
“glam” we can bring up a dialogue box with Analyze -> Classify -> Hierarchical Cluster.
Then we have entered the variables of the risk score. By default, SPSS assumes that we want to cluster by cases (members). 
This may indeed be the case, and then we could look at the members of each cluster and interpret the meaning of the 
clusters. In the present example, clustering by cases would give such a large number of clusters (336) in the final stage of 
the analysis, that it would be very difficult to make much sense of it. Here we are better advised to see how the variables 
cluster, so we have elected to cluster by variable, which will give us at most nine clusters (the original nine variables), see 
Figure 126.

Figure 126: Selecting variables for cluster analysis
SPSS gives a choice of plots: icicle plots (so named as they look like icicles hanging from the ceiling), see Figure 127 or 
dendrograms, see Figure 128. The icicle plot starts with all the variables (or cases, if that option is selected) in the one 
cluster, this is row one. In the second row two clusters are formed, where the closest variables (or cases) are put into a 
cluster.

Cluster analysis
Figure 128: Dendrogram
I find the icicle plot difficult to follow, and prefer the dendrogram . This can be read from right to left, in which case 
equipment and mobility and nutrition seem linked in one cluster with all other items in another. 
There are several ways of interpreting this diagram (one of the difficulties of cluster analysis), but it seems to me that it 
could be seen conceptually as consisting of one cluster that are largely intrinsic (fever, blood values e.g.) and the other 
extrinsic (nutrition and use of equipment e.g.).
Example: Infant, perinatal and neonatal mortality (hierarchical clustering)
Let us look at the data in datafile “perinatal” (see Table 68) where we observe trends (some of the data from the smaller 
countries have been removed for clarity, but the overall picture is not altered by this). However, the three measures are 
not in the same rank order for all values. For example, Albania has the worst infant mortality, but Moldova has the worst 
perinatal mortality and Albania the fif﻿th worst.

Figure 129: Dendrogram for mortality data
Working from the right to the left of the dendrogram shown in the figure, Moldova appears as a cluster on its own. It has, 
in general, the worst figures of all, although not on every measure, as noted above. The dendrogram splits into two, with 
an almost complete split into western Europe and eastern Europe. In the eastern countries, Russia, Poland and Latvia 
cluster closely, and most of the former state socialist countries that were outside the borders of the USSR (Slovakia, 
Lithuania, Estonia, etc.) are also close to each other. You will note that the western countries have very few levels, and are 
thus much more similar to each other than are then eastern countries. The only former state-socialist countries that are 
in the western cluster are Slovenia and the Czech Republic. These data can be interpreted as a massive difference between 
eastern and western Europe with respect to infant, perinatal and neonatal mortality, but with much more diversity in the 
east. Note that the clustering algorithm had no information on the geography of the countries, merely the mortality data.
Further interpretation is possible given extra information, For example, the two former state-socialist countries (Slovenia 
and the Czech Republic) were among the richer of the former eastern bloc countries. They also had much more liberal 
economic policies, and therefore would have less difficulty adjusting to the post-Communist transition, and they are 
geographically close to rich western countries (e.g. Austria and Germany) with whom they could more easily trade.

Problems with cluster analysis
Optimization techniques typically require large amounts of computing time, and in the case of neural networks scale 
badly, are not guaranteed to give a solution, and any solution found may be difficult to analyse.
It is difficult to choose the optimal metric in hierarchical clustering, the solution is sensitive to the chosen metric, and 
the clustering may be difficult to interpret.

Introduction to power analysis
19	Introduction to power analysis
Key points
• 
You need to consider power to decide how big a sample you need
At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
• 
Work out your sample size
Introduction
Power analysis is the science of finding out how big your sample needs to be. This, for any given test (chi square, Student’s 
t test for independent groups etc.) depends on four basic factors:-
• 
α: the alpha level, conventionally set to 0.05
• 
1-β: the power, conventionally set to 0.8
• 
n: the sample size
• e effect: the size of difference in means, the strength of correlation, or some other measure of the strength of 
the effect
This is introducing a new term. We know that α is the probability of a Type I error, or the probability of a result suggesting 
an effect is real, when there is no effect. An alternative way to say this is that α is the probability of incorrectly rejecting the 
null hypothesis. The probability of getting a Type II error is β, or the probability of missing a real effect, i.e. not reaching 
the alpha level where a real effect exists. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis, and clearly 
that is the inverse of β, as β is the probability of incorrectly accepting the null hypothesis. If you find all this confusing 
then either:-
The null hypothesis is true (there is no effect) in which case there are two possibilities. 
a)	 The p value returned is less than α, indicating the null hypothesis should not be accepted, which is wrong, this 
is a type I error. 
b)	 The p value returned is more than (or equal to) α, indicating the null hypothesis should not be accepted, which 
is correct.
The null hypothesis is not true (there is an effect) in which case there are two possibilities. 
c)	 The p value returned is less than α, indicating the null hypothesis should not be accepted, which is correct. 
d)	 The p value returned is more than (or equal to) α, indicating the null hypothesis should not be accepted, which 
is incorrect, this is a Type II error.

Introduction to power analysis
The probability of these four outcomes (there are none other) are:-
a)	 α 
b)	 1-α 
c)	 1- β
d)	 β 
This must be true since the two possibilities (null hypothesis is true or not true) in each case must add to unity.
If we had data available we could estimate what effect size we could expect. However sometimes there are no data and 
in these cases Cohen (1989) gives conventions for different tests for what constitute small, medium and large effects. For 
example the effect size for Student’s t test for independent groups is the number of standard deviations that the two means 
differ by, or d=(μ1-μ2)/σ where d is the effect size, μ1,μ2 are the means and σ is the standard deviation. Cohen gives small 
as 0.2, medium as 0.5 and large as 0.8. Large effects are easy to detect, and therefore cheap to detect as they need fewer 
subjects. Small effects are conversely difficult and expensive as we need larger sample sizes. In any given situation there is 
an effect size that we probably don’t care about, or in other words it is practically (or clinically) not significant. For example 
a drug that reduces blood pressure by 5 mm Hg is useful, one that reduces it by 0.5 mm Hg is probably not. What effect 
size is important is a subjective judgment and uses knowledge of the subject under scrutiny. The cost of conducting the 
study will clearly be an important issue.
The test is always a given as it is whatever test is appropriate to analyse your data. If you set three of four factors, the 
fourth can be determined. The alpha level is normally set to 0.05. This leaves sample size effect size and power. The most 
common forms of power analysis are:-
A priori: conducted before the study. Most commonly given α, β and effect size, the sample needed to detect that effect 
size is computed. 
Post hoc: conducted after the study. Most commonly given α, e and n determine how much power the study had.
Power analysis with tables
Books such as Cohen (1989) have tables giving a range of power against sample size for specific tests, and for given α 
and effect size. You can read off the sample size for a given power, effect and alpha level (say) by reading across in the 
relevant table.

Introduction to power analysis
I have been using gpower for a decade. It works fine, I still use the MSDOS program. I have just started using PS. In 
some respects I prefer gpower, even the non-Windows version. But PS seems to work well and has good graphics. Both 
cover the basic tests only, though this is usually all you need. If you need power analysis of exotic tests you will need to 
buy one of the proprietary packages.
Example: chi square
p(Oi) is the probability of the observed value of the ith cell. This is clearly closely related to the chi square statistic. Do 
not worry if you do not immediately comprehend the following section. The important bit is that when observed and 
expected values are far apart the chi square statistic is big, and so is w.
w is defined as:-
W=Σ(p(Oi)-p(Ei))2/p(Oi)
Suppose we wanted to plan how many patients we should recruit to see if males are different to females with respect to 
repetition of self harm. This is the a priori question. Using gpower (I am using the DOS version, but the Windows version 
is basically the same) I find if we wanted to only detect a large effect then a sample of 32 would suffice. However that might 
mean that a medium effect is missed, and given the seriousness of the subject (people may kill themselves) we probably 
want to detect smaller effects. A medium effect can be detected with 88 subjects (see Figure 130) and a small effect with 
785. So our study with more than 1000 subjects is unlikely to miss even a small effect.

PS is an alternative power analysis package, also free, and deals with effects a little differently. For example for Student’s 
t test you enter the difference between means and the standard deviation (which will be used to determine effect size) 
and also the ratio of control to experimental patients. Clearly the authors have clinical trials in mind, but where the 
numbers are equal the ratio is simply 1.0. 
What effect size might our study have missed? This is the post hoc question. We know from our descriptive statistics that 
61.7% of males repeated compared to only 44.2% of females. The ratio of males to females was roughly 1.0, see Table 69.

Since the overall total is almost exactly 1000, we can create the probabilities for observed and expected by taking all values 
back 3 decimal places:-

I can use these values to compute the effect size, see Figure 131.
Figure 131: calculating observed effect 
Note I have cheated a little here, as the numbers I approximated above add up to a little over 1.0 for each column, and 
the program does not allow this, so I moved down a fraction the top two numbers to allow a calculation to proceed. This 
does not materially change anything. I can now calculate the power (a post hoc examination) given this effect size and 
the sample size I had, see Figure 132.

What we see is that even with the rather small effect we noted (between small and medium), there is a vanishingly small 
chance of missing this effect with a sample of 1000. In fact power is given as 0.999. Alternatively to see this effect with a 
conventional power we only needed n=245, see Figure 133.

Introduction to power analysis
Figure 133: calculating sample size
What if we wanted to detect a really small effect. The situation is very different; the power for an effect of 0.05 and a 
sample of 1000 is now only 0.35. Alternatively we could say that we are only about 35% confident of locating such an 
effect. However to detect this we would need a sample of 3140. Therefore we would need to collect about three times the 
data we have. But is it worth it? That is a question of resources. What would we do if we knew there was a tiny difference 
in repeated self harm in males and females? If the answer is nothing then it is not worth collecting the large sample.
Exercise 
You want to conduct a Student’s t test for independent groups. You are testing whether a drug reduces blood pressure 
compared to a control. A clinically significant difference has been stated to be a reduction of 5 mm Hg in the diastolic 
pressure. The standard deviation in previous groups, where you have access to the data, is 20. Look at the graph in Figure 
134 that I created from PS. What power (roughly) would you have with a sample of 100 subjects? What sample size would 
you need (roughly) to detect the clinically significant difference with a power of 0.8? Now look at Figure 135. How big a 
sample (roughly) would you need to detect a fall of 10 mm Hg, and how many (roughly) to detect a 2.5 mm Hg.

Additional tests
Some tests are not given in the free programs. But all is not lost. For some tests like Mann Whitney, that do a similar job 
to Student’s t test may be calculated from the output of (for Mann Whitney) the Student’s t test for independent groups. 
This is because of the asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) which is the ratio of power of one test over the over. The ARE 
for Mann Whitney relative to the Student’s t test for independent groups is 0.955. Thus as the power of the latter for a 
given scenario is (1-β) it will be 0.955(1-β) for Mann Whitney. Thus Mann Whitney is less powerful than the parametric 
test, but not much less.

Cohen’s large book (Cohen, 1989) is the bible of power analysis. It contains tables on many tests, and is the basis of many 
computer programs. Miles (n.d.) has a nice webpage explaining power analysis.

20	Which statistical tests to use
Introduction
A common question is “what test should I use” and here I detail for all the common ones, what test is appropriate. These 
are the tests covered in chapters six to ten.
If you need to test an hypothesis, which one should you use? The question really should go one stage back, what is your 
research question? This will determine whether you even need an hypothesis, and then you can look to see what test is 
most appropriate. Some research questions are answered by descriptive statistics, others that are qualitative in nature do 
not need a statistical treatment at all (e.g. grounded theory, phenomenology, narrative biography) 
The sorts of research designs we have looked at in this module are:-
Cross tabulation. E.g. you want to test whether males are more likely to be promoted than females in universities.
• 
Null hypothesis: The proportions of males and females promoted are not significantly different.
Independent groups. You want to test whether two or more groups are different with respect to a test variable. E.g. you 
want to test if males access on online course more, less or the same as females.
• Null hypothesis: There is no significant difference in number of accesses to an online course between the two 
genders.
Repeated measures. You want to see if two or more measurements on the same subject are different. E.g. you want to see 
if an online course improves the knowledge of statistics in a cohort of students.
• 
Null hypothesis: The marks in a test to measure statistics knowledge pre-course are not significantly different 
from those obtained post course.
Correlation. E.g. you want to see if marks in a course are correlated to pre-course educational attainment.
• 
Null hypothesis: There is no significant correlation between pre-course educational attainment (degree 
classification) and grade awarded in a postgraduate module.
Note we are not saying in the null hypotheses that there are no differences, correlations etc. We are saying in the null 
hypotheses that these effects are not significant, ie. Any effects are explicable by random error. Also we are not saying we 
believe the null hypothesis, we are using the null hypothesis as something we can test.

Which statistical tests to use
Let us summarise the tests we have encountered so far
• Chi square. This is the only test that looks at frequencies of nominal data. It employs cross tabulation. It is a 
weak test, but the only one we have discussed that deals with nominal data (there are others, but by far this is 
the most common). So if you have nominal data only, think chi square.
• 
Student’s t test for independent groups. This tests differences of data that are at least ordinal and split into two 
groups. It is a parametric test (it assumes a normal distribution).
• 
Mann Whitney. This also tests differences of data that are at least ordinal and split into two groups. It is a non-
parametric test (it does not assume a normal distribution).
• 
One way analysis of variance (one way ANOVA). This tests differences of data that are at least ordinal and split 
into more than two groups. It is a parametric test.
• Kruskall Wallis. This also tests differences of data that are at least ordinal and split into more than two groups. 
It is a non-parametric test.
• 
Student’s t test for paired data. This tests if two measures that are at least ordinal on the same subject are 
different. It is a parametric test.

Which statistical tests to use
• 
Wilcoxon test. This also tests if two measures that are at least ordinal on the same subject are different. It is a 
non-parametric test.
• 
Repeated ANOVA. This tests if more than two measures that are at least ordinal on the same subject are 
different. It is a parametric test.
• Friedman. This also tests if more than two measures that are at least ordinal on the same subject are different. 
It is a non-parametric test.
• 
Pearson’s correlation co-efficient. This tests if two variables that are at least ordinal are correlated. It is a 
parametric test.
• 
Spearman rank. This also tests if two variables that are at least ordinal are correlated. It is a non-parametric test.
So let us construct a cookbook of tests. You will find many textbooks show this as a table, or flowchart. I will employ a 
text based algorithm.
Algorithm for choosing test
Check type of data
Do you have two variables? Are data from both variables nominal? Do you want to test if frequencies in a cross tabulation 
of the two variables are what you would expect if the variables are independent of each other? Use chi square.
Testing difference in ordinal/interval/ratio data in different groups
Two groups? Are data normally distributed? Use Student’s t test for independent groups, otherwise use Mann Whitney.
More than two groups? Are data normally distributed? Use one way ANOVA, otherwise use Kruskall Wallis
Testing changes in a variable in same or related subjects
Two measures? Are data normally distributed? Use paired Student’s t test, otherwise use Wilcoxon.
More than two measures? Are data normally distributed? Use repeated ANOVA, otherwise use Friedman.
Correlation of two variables
Are data normally distributed? Use Pearson’s correlation, otherwise use Spearman rank.

Exercise
Match each of the studies in Table 70 to tests in Table 71.
You will need to make some assumptions to determine whether data are normally distributed and the type of data employed. 
Use common sense to make reasonable judgements. What is important is that you can make a reasoned assessment of 
what test is likely to be optimal. I suggest you make a precise research question, state the null hypothesis, state what type 
of data is needed, whether it is normally distributed, and then use these to pick the appropriate test.

g)	 Is attitude to online learning on a four point scale from 1 (like it a lot) to 4 (dislike it a lot) different before 
and after delivery of an online module?
h)	 Is blood pressure correlated to weight?

2 Wikipedia is not to be relied upon totally as it is not peer reviewed. However while using a collaborative group to write 
material may not start with perfection, it is unlikely to end up with rubbish. I have found its pages on statistics very 
good and to date completely accurate. For obvious reasons more controversial subjects may be less free from bias or 
subjectivity. I tested this by looking pages on “abortion” and “Saddam Hussein”. You may check yourself how biased these 
pages are in your opinion. Pages in Wikipedia are not static, and while very useful should be used as a reference with 
caution, as the reader will be accessing a different text than the one I quote, in all likelihood, as the pages are dynamic.

Chapter 4
I collected data on ethnic groups (this is different from nationality) e.g. White British, Black or Black British, Asian or 
Asian British. Separately I obtained data on attitude to the online course ranging from very useful to useless on a four 
point scale. How would I best show these data to a teaching colleague to show them the general picture of ethnicity in 
this course, and also describe their attitudes to the relevance of online courses? What type of data is ethnic group, and 
what type of data is the attitudinal variable?
You could use a table or pie chart or bar chart to show either attitude or ethnicity. The former though is better shown 
as a bar chart than pie chart as the data are ordinal and the bar chart shows the bars starting at one end of the scale and 
moving to the other.
Ethnic group is nominal
Attitude is ordinal
Split data by gender and do a histogram of age for each gender. Unsplit the data and perform a clustered bar chart using 
percentages of gender against frequency of accessing the course. Interpret the results of both operations.

Use the datafile “assets”, sort by gravity (descending) and find the most severe case that did not get a custodial sentence. 
This sort of exploration can identify “odd” cases. 
All gravity scores of eight (the highest) had custodial sentences, but some of the scores of seven did not.

Males seem to repeat overdose more than females, according to the chi square analysis. However maybe males have more 
mental health problems, and it is this, rather than gender, that may be the real issue. Decide how to test this. You will 
need to create a cross-tabulation table and employ chi square to check this out.

Chapter 7
Consider whether diploma or degree students were accessing the Blackboard online course site more frequently. Identify 
the most appropriate test, run in SPSS and comment to the discussion board with your interpretation.
The right test is Mann Whitney (since the Likert score will most likely not be normally distributed, and even if it were it 
would be difficult to be sure with only four levels).
Thus p<0.001 (not 0.000 as SPSS indicates) and therefore there is a significant difference. Since degree students have the 
higher mean rank, it is they who use the site more. N.B. you will need to change the test variable  to be Scale as the 
designers in SPSS v18 for some reason do not want us to use ordinal data in these tests. I hope they are better programmers

What does it mean to have a p=0.009 for the between groups? 
This is a p value < 0.05 so there is a significant difference among the prisons with respect to number of symptoms
Go through the remainder of the table and decide which prisons are the same (not significantly different from each other) 
and which are significantly different. 
SPSS gives asterisks against those that are significantly different. So A and D are different from each other, all other prisons 
are not significantly different. This can be illustrated in a box plot:-

Oddly this seems to show A and B are much the same. Why therefore is B and D not significantly different? There are 
more respondents from A (50) than B (33) so this is probably due to the small number of responses from B. If we get 
more responses from B the p value might go down, but it could also go up. All we can say now is that although B is not 
significantly different to A, and A is significantly different to D, B is not.
Determine if the data for number of mental health symptoms are normally distributed. 
The histogram shows it is clearly skewed to lower values. It is not normally distributed, note the normal curve superimposed 
is nothing like what we found.

There is a significant difference among the prisons, with D highest, A lowest and the other prisons somewhere in 
between. There is no post-hoc test available in Kruskall Wallis, so this is as far as we can go. However common sense 
suggests a similar interpretation as when we used the (inappropriate) parametric test. 
Chapter 9
Interpret the output of Table 23.
There is no significant correlation between age and (self-assessed) confidence in using computers. Therefore it is wrong 
to interpret the positive correlation as meaning older students are more confident.
Using the data in the RAE datafile consider the following hypotheses:-
• 
There is no significant correlation between full time equivalent (FTE) doctoral students and RAE rating
• 
There is no significant correlation between funding and RAE rating
Remember you will need to check whether the data (both variables) are normally distributed

Spearman shows RAE ratings are highly significantly correlated with income, but not doctoral students (though it is 
approaching significance). The correlation with funding is positive (unsurprisingly). If you took the view that close to 0.05 
is worth interpreting then doctoral students are also positively correlated, but the effect is much smaller. A correlation of 
less than 0.3 is usually said to be medium, and one of 0.5 large. Thus there is a large significant correlation with funding 
and medium (but only approaching significance) one for doctoral students. Of course you would want to be careful using 
this information in practice. You could get rid of all doctoral students and concentrate on funding, but the quality of the

So I use Wilcoxon for the two variable comparison and Friedman for the four variable comparison.
So there is a significant difference and trial3. 
Now test for the differences between all four trials, trial1 trial2 trial3 and trial4. Again decide the appropriate test, run it 
and interpret the results
So there is a significant difference among the four trials with the mean rank going down from the first to last trial. This 
is shown nicely in a boxplot.

How has changing the threshold changed the four measures?
Sensitivity 	
= 104/137 	
= 0.76
Specificity 	
= 666/958 	
=0.70
PPV 	
	
	
	
=104/396 	
=0.26
NPV 	
	
	
	
= 666/699 	
=0.95
So sensitivity has increased, specificity decreased (as expected) and PPV has reduced and NPV increased.

Why did I use Spearman and not Pearson’s correlation?
Because of non normal distributions of data.
Load the datafile “assets”. Use the twelve asset subscores, gravity factor and age to compute a Cronbach α. Repeat this 
analysis but with age removed, and then again with gravity and age removed. What do you infer from these analyses.

What do you infer from these analyses.
The Cronbach is acceptable with all sub-scores and age and gravity. But removing age and then gravity removed the 
Cronbach improves, showing (unsurprisingly) that the age and gravity are probably more different from the sub-scores 
of the asset than the sub-scores are to each other. Nevertheless they do seem to be measuring much the same thing as 
sub-scores, which is also unsurprising. 
Chapter 15
Consider the datafile “assets”. Conduct a factor analysis of the twelve asset sub-scores using PCA. Decide how many 
factors there are. Interpret the factors. 
Putting all variables in except total asset score (since we have all the sub-scores) gives a scree plot, that I would interpret 
as having possibly only one factor:-

You want to conduct a Student’s t test for independent groups. You are testing whether a drug reduces blood pressure 
compared to a control. A clinically significant difference has been stated to be a reduction of 5 mm Hg in the diastolic 
pressure. The standard deviation in previous groups, where you have access to the data, is 20. Look at the graph in Figure 
134 that I created from PS. What power (roughly) would you have with a sample of 100 subjects? What sample size would 
you need (roughly) to detect the clinically significant difference with a power of 0.8? Now look at Figure 135. How big a

Online course survey
Used in chapter 3, 4, 7, 9, 14
This dataset was from an evaluation of an online course. There are demographic variables (age, gender etc.) and several 
Likert scores measuring attitudes to various aspects of the course. You will note some of these are Ordinal level (which 
they should be) and some are Scale. I only assigned variables to Scale due to SPSS (wrongly in my view) assuming some 
tests need Scale variables.
I did not publish from these data, though I did write a report (Anthony, 2006).

Used in chapter 8, 15, we wrote a report (Anthony and Collins, 2004) and published from this (Anthony, 2005a).
This has for a number of prisons the responses of prisoners with respect to mental health symptoms. Prisoners were 
asked about nine symptoms, and a count was made for each prisoner of all the symptoms they had, up to a maximum of 
nine. There are five prisons. Note category C are prisons for low risk prisoners (but are not open prisons), category B are 
higher security prisons, the highest security prison is category A. This sample contains only category B and C prisons, 
and a young offenders institute.
This dataset consists mainly of yes/no answers to specific mental health problems, but also has a variable prison identifying 
the prison the prisoner is in, and a computed variable “Number of mental health symptoms” which adds up the number 
of symptoms.

RAE example
Used in chapter 9
Universities in the UK are evaluated at regular intervals for their research outputs. The last one was 2008. The RAE gave 
scores 1, 2 3b, 3a, 4, 5 and 5* where 1 was least good and 5* best. Each subject was entered and evaluated separately, these 
were called units of assessment (UoAs). I looked at the RAE score for one submission, nursing. I have created the datafile 
“research assessment exercise” which I used in a paper (Anthony, 2005b).
