Dedication
To my husband, Perry Luntz, for all the usual reasons.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Every For Dummies book is a work of many hands, so I have many people to
thank for this one.
First in line, Michael Lewis, my Acquisitions Editor, who moved this new edi-
tion of Controlling Cholesterol For Dummies from an idea to a reality. Then
there’s my wonderful project editor, Natalie Harris, whose scientific intelli-
gence and editorial diligence kept things on track. My many thanks to Copy
Editor Carrie Burchfield whose keen eye and fine-point blue pen are a writer’s
delight. And let’s not forget Wiley’s hardworking proofreaders and page
layout technicians.
Like others who write about health and medicine, I am enormously grateful
to Martin Graf, MD, and Bonnie Taub-Dix, the experts who’ve generously
taken the time to read the manuscript for accuracy. I also appreciate the
assistance of the professionals at the American Heart Association: Aaron
Talent, Tagni McRae, and Taylor Morris.
Finally, I would like to put in a word of appreciation for all the anonymous
folks at the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Departments of Agriculture
and Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
and the similar agencies up there in our neighbor to the north, Canada. Without
their efforts, you and I would be left without the numbers we need to construct
intelligent guidelines for a healthy life. So let’s hear it for these guys: Hip! Hip!
Hooray!

Introduction
W
hat a difference a day makes. Or, to be more precise, 2,138 days. In 
the years since the first edition of Controlling Cholesterol For Dummies
appeared, the medical and nutritional experts have (among other things):
 Changed the numbers that say, “This is a healthy cholesterol level.”
 Revised the definition of “bad cholesterol” (low-density lipoproteins, or
LDLs) to reflect the discovery that some “bad” cholesterol may actually
be just fine.
 Introduced new combo drugs that zap both the cholesterol you get from
food and the cholesterol your own body makes.
 Re-evaluated the role of hormones in raising or lowering the risk of heart
disease.
 Clarified some of the differences between how male and female bodies
handle cholesterol.
 Changed the drill on which vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients may
(or may not) reduce cholesterol levels.
 Reaffirmed the virtues of the Mediterranean Diet and moderate drinking.
 Added some new items to the list of foods that fight cholesterol.
 Introduced new “functional” foods that fight cholesterol (including a
chocolate laced with cholesterol-buster fatty acids).
 Set up some new Web sites to provide cholesterol guidance on every-
thing from defining cholesterol terms (what is a triglyceride, anyway?) to
evaluating your own personal risk of a cholesterol-related heart attack.
In other words, the people who rule The World Of Cholesterol Medicine have
been very busy little bees. Which is why you are holding this book in your
hands. It contains tons of new info to help you control your cholesterol, keep
your arteries as clear as a newborn babe’s, and thus keep your heart beating
merrily along for years to come.
When it comes to solving life’s little problems — whether to eat that 
chocolate cake, whether to dye your hair orange, or whether to lower your
cholesterol — I choose to follow the ancient Greek mantra, “Moderation 
in all things.”
In other words, I get to eat the cake about once a week; my hair is gray/

blonde, not orange; and this book is called Controlling Cholesterol For
Dummies rather than, say, Knocking Cholesterol Down to Zero For Dummies.
The simple fact is that no one is perfect, but most people can be much, much
better. The same principle holds true for your cholesterol levels. When choles-
terol is the topic, lower is almost always better. (I talk about a few exceptions
throughout this book.) But if you set a goal you can never reach — dropping
50 points off your cholesterol reading by two weeks from Tuesday — you’ll 
fall off the wagon long before your cholesterol level falls a milligram.
My point? This book is eminently reasonable and moderate; I designed it to
help you (working with your doctor, of course) keep your cholesterol within
safe boundaries.
About This Book
Controlling Cholesterol For Dummies, 2nd Edition, doesn’t ask you to turn
yourself into an anti-cholesterol fanatic — the kind of annoying person who
sneers at other people’s dinner choices while acting superior about his own.
(Actually, sneering and acting superior at the same time is a neat trick if you
can do it. Just don’t try it on your friends at dinner.)
My goal with this book is to lay out the reasons why it makes sense to control
your cholesterol and then present reasonable and moderate strategies to
help you reach your goal.
Some of the information, like how to translate the cholesterol numbers you
get on your annual physical, is simple. Other stuff, such as guidelines you 
can use to determine whether you’re a candidate for a heart attack — or for
cholesterol-lowering medication — is more complex.
Throughout this book, the emphasis is on the idea that (here comes another
catchy slogan) “Knowledge is power.” In this case, it’s the power to lower
your cholesterol and reduce your risk of heart attack.
Conventions Used in This Book
Don’t get me wrong. I write about nutrition, food, and health for a living, but 
I have to admit that some books and articles about these subjects can be
pretty boring. (Unless the author is instructing you how to lose 30 pounds in
30 days or lower your cholesterol by 50 points in 50 minutes. But I deal with
non-fiction subjects. Sorry.) I try to remedy this sleepy state of affairs with
2
Controlling Cholesterol For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

this book. So, if a few of my jokes don’t tickle your funny bone, forgive me.
After all, how funny can high cholesterol and plaque-filled arteries be?
To make this book as easy to use as possible, the following conventions are
followed throughout:
 All Web addresses appear in monofont.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed 
to break across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that 
I haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the
break. So, when using one of these Web addresses, just type exactly
what you see in this book, pretending the line break doesn’t exist.
 New terms appear in italics and are closely followed by an easy-to-
understand definition. I also use italics for emphasis once in a while.
 Bold font highlights keywords in bulleted lists or identifies the action
parts of numbered lists.
 When you find information about the nutrient content of brand-name
products in this book, you can assume that what you’re reading was
right when I wrote it. But here’s the catch: Sometimes products change
practically overnight. So use the numbers here as a guide, but be sure to
check the product label when you shop. As poker players like to say,
“Trust your friends — but cut the cards.”
What You’re Not to Read
Yes, you read that right. You don’t have to read everything contained within
these snazzy black and yellow covers. Any text in a gray box is a sidebar.
Sidebars contain “nice to know” (and may I add, pretty interesting) material,
but skipping them won’t take away from your understanding of the subject 
at hand.
Additionally, anything marked with a Technical Stuff icon deals with nuts-and-
bolts medical info that simply provides background information and in-depth
scientific explanations about various subjects. You may skip these bits of text
as well (although they provide some great info, if I do say so myself).
Foolish Assumptions
A writer has to make a few assumptions about her audience, and I’ve made a
few assumptions about you. If you’ve picked up this book, I’m guessing that
you fall into one or more of these categories:
3
Introduction

 You’ve been told by your doctor that your cholesterol levels aren’t up to
par, and you have to do something about it.
 You’ve heard all the talk about high cholesterol in recent years, and you
want to find out what all the fuss is about.
 You routinely buy every For Dummies book that hits the shelf, and this
one is next on your list.
 You’re a health-conscious individual.
 You’re concerned about heart disease, and controlling the ol’ cholesterol
levels has become very important to you.
I’ve also assumed that you don’t have a level of health-related knowledge to
rival the U.S. Surgeon General’s. If this assumption is correct, you’ve come 
to the right place. Easy-to-follow explanations are a hallmark of this book.
But if you approach the subject of controlling cholesterol with some informa-
tion already tucked away in that brain of yours, don’t worry — I’ve included
plenty of info in this book for you as well.
How This Book Is Organized
This summary aims to whet your appetite for cholesterol control by giving
you a glimpse of what’s ahead in the 14 regular chapters, four — count ’em, 
four — Part of Tens chapters, and one bang-up, nutrition-chart appendix. Use
this section as a thumbnail guide to what you want to read first.
Part I: Getting Up Close and 
Personal with Cholesterol
Chapter 1 is, well, the first chapter. It explains why you should read this 
book — to reduce your risk of heart attack. Chapter 2 explains the good side
of cholesterol (yes, cholesterol has a good side), as well as the problems it
can cause. Chapter 3 says, “Okay, now figure out your own personal risk of
cholesterol-related heart disease.”
Don’t skip Chapter 3: The news may be better than you think. And hey, if it
isn’t, the rest of the book tells you how to reverse the picture and improve
your odds for a long, healthy life.

Controlling Cholesterol For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part II: Eating Your Way 
to Lower Cholesterol
Yes, your diet pulls some weight when it comes to your cholesterol numbers.
Actually, your diet matters big time. Chapter 4 lays out principles for a 
cholesterol-lowering diet proposed by all the usual suspects, oops, I mean
experts. Chapter 5 tells you how to assemble a cholesterol-lowering diet.
Chapter 6 tells how to apply the information in chapters 4 and 5 to real life.
Part III: Leading a Cholesterol-Lowering
Lifestyle
Diet matters, but so does your lifestyle. Chapter 7 is a very important 
explanation of the relationship between your weight and your cholesterol
levels. Chapter 8 describes how movin’ your bod can help push down your
cholesterol.
Chapter 9 is not, repeat not, a both-sides-of-the-issue type of chapter. Smoking
does many bad things, including lifting your cholesterol levels, so this 
chapter pulls no punches.
In Chapter 10, I head back into moderate territory — moderate drinking 
that is. In study after study, sober researchers have found that moderate
drinking — one drink a day for a woman, two drinks a day for a man —
appears to increase your “good” cholesterol and lower your risk of heart
attack. Check it out.
Part IV: Cutting Cholesterol with 
Nutrients and Medicine
Chapter 11 is all about nutritional supplements, including vitamins and how
they affect your cholesterol, sometimes in surprising ways. Chapter 12 is a
primer on cholesterol-lowering prescription drug products — the good, the
bad, and (sorry about this) the truly ugly. Chapter 13 is a guide to medicines
that may adversely affect your cholesterol (and your heart). Chapter 14 is
filled with recipes for fun, heart-healthy party foods so that you can continue
to control your cholesterol while celebrating special occasions.

Introduction

Part V: The Part of Tens
I just love this part of the book because it lets me draw up lists of odd and
unusual factoids that I may not otherwise be able to include.
Chapter 15 lists ten good Web sites for heart and cholesterol info. Chapter 16
has ten nifty nutrition Web sites. Chapter 17 is one of my favorites — ten 
cholesterol myths. Chapter 18 tickles my historical fancy with ten really
important moments in cholesterol history. 
This part also includes an appendix, which contains a chart of more than 500
foods and the cholesterol, fat, and fiber content for common servings. The
material, from my old friend, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), is
invaluable when you’re putting together heart-friendly meals. So use it.
For even more info on even more foods, check out the USDA Nutrient
Database (which I discuss in Chapter 16) on the Web at www.nal.usda.

T
o do the best job of controlling your cholesterol, you
need to have a handle on the basics — info such as
what cholesterol is, where it comes from, what it does,
and why some varieties are more threatening than others.
And being a Serious Seeker of Knowledge, you probably
want to be able to perform a realistic evaluation of your
own risk of developing cholesterol-related problems. The

Chapter 1
Mapping the Heart Land
In This Chapter
 Picturing your heart
 Quantifying heart disease and tracking the stats on heart attacks
 Setting a sensible strategy to cut your personal risk
H
eart disease is America’s number one health killer; it’s ahead of 
every type of cancer combined and every infectious and degenerative
disease. Heart attack is the most common form of heart disease, and one 
significant risk factor for heart attack is high cholesterol or, more specifically,
a high level of certain kinds of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) — the “bad” 
fat and protein particles that ferry cholesterol into your arteries.
If you already know all this introductory stuff, feel free to skip Chapter 1 and
head right into Chapter 2 where I describe cholesterol’s dual nature (yes,
cholesterol has two sides). 
But, then again, this chapter does lay out a statistical picture of heart disease
and heart attack and explain the role cholesterol plays in placing you at risk.
In fact, come to think of it, this chapter is a darn good intro to Controlling
Cholesterol For Dummies, 2nd Edition.
No surprise there!
Ladies and Gentlemen, Meet Your Heart
Your heart is a pretty spectacular organ — a four-chambered, hollow muscle
right smack in the middle of your chest. The heart’s job is to pump the blood
that carries life-giving oxygen and other nutrients to every body tissue. To
show how this works, the clever For Dummies artists have drawn a cross 
section of your heart in Figure 1-1 tracing the path of blood flowing in and out
and in and out and in . . . you get the idea.

Every second of every minute of every hour of every day, blood flows out
from your heart to carry oxygen and other nutrients to every tissue and
organ in your body, and then comes back to your heart to pick up more
oxygen and nutrients. In other words, blood circulates, which is why your
heart and the vessels through which blood travels are called the circulatory
system.
The best way to explain this process is to begin at the beginning, the point at
which blood flows back from your body, into your heart:
1. The blood enters your heart from the superior vena cava, a large vein
that opens into the right atrium, the first chamber of your heart.
Yes, the vena cava and the right atrium are on the left side of the picture
above. In this picture, you’re looking at the front of the heart as it sits in
the chest of the person to whom it belongs. If he were to turn around so
that you were looking at him from the back, the vena cava and the right
atrium would be in the correct position, on the right side of his body.
Got it? Good. Onward.

Pulmonary vein
Pulmonary artery
Mitral valve

Part I: Getting Up Close and Personal with Cholesterol 

2. From the right atrium, blood spills down through a one-way 
“trapdoor” called the tricuspid valve and into the right ventricle.
3. When the right ventricle contracts (squeezes together), the blood is
sent out of your heart through the pulmonary artery and into your
lungs where it picks up a plentiful supply of oxygen.
4. The newly oxygenated blood flows back into your heart through the
pulmonary vein into the left atrium.
5. Then the blood spills down through a second one-way trapdoor called
the mitral valve and into the left ventricle.
6. When the left ventricle contracts, blood is pushed up through the
large artery called the aorta and out into your body.
In real life, as opposed to a drawing, the right atrium and the left atrium
receive blood simultaneously from the vena cava and the pulmonary vein
respectively. The right and the left atria (plural for atrium) contract simulta-
neously to send blood down through the tricuspid valve and the mitral valve
respectively. And the right and left ventricles contract simultaneously to
push blood up into the pulmonary artery and the aorta respectively. All this
without missing a beat. Hey, I told you this was a spectacular organ!
13
Chapter 1: Mapping the Heart Land
Naming the blood vessels
Blood vessels are grouped according to the job
they perform in your body, which means they’re
grouped in terms of whether they carry blood to
your heart or away from your heart. This list
explains how the groupings work:
 Veins: Blood vessels that carry blood toward
your heart. The word vein comes from vena,
the Latin word for hollow.
 Venules: Small veins.
 Capillaries: Teensy, little veins that connect
arteries to veins right under the skin. When
blood flows into your capillaries, the red
liquid under the skin gives you a rosy 
glow — a blush.
 Arteries: Blood vessels that carry blood
away from your heart. The word artery
comes from arteria, the Latin word for 
windpipe.
 Arterioles: Very small arteries.
I have no idea why the person who named the
blood vessels picked a word that means hollow
for veins and a word that means windpipe for
arteries. If it were up to me, I would’ve used a
word that means “bring to” for veins, and a word
that means “go away from” for arteries.
In fact, the words afferent (from the Latin ad =
toward and ferro = carry) and efferent (ferro plus
the Latin ex = away) are used to describe,
respectively, nerves that carry impulses to or
away from the central nervous system. Maybe
whoever named the blood vessels picked veins
and arteries because afferent and efferent were
already taken. Works for me.

Attack of the Killer Heart Disease
Heart disease is the leading killer of Americans, and heart attacks are the
most common form of heart disease. But you don’t have to take my word for
it. Many U.S. government agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention and the National Center for Health Statistics, have piled up 
a ton of stats and translated all the numbers into dozens of charts to show
exactly how lethal heart disease can be.
Heart disease versus everything else
First things first. Table 1-1 lists the ten leading causes of death in the United
States for 2004. See what’s in first place? Check it out. Note: Stroke, a form of
cardiovascular disease known medically as cerebrovascular disease, is
counted as a separate category.

Talking heart disease
The phrase cardiovascular disease (CVD) means
“all medical conditions affecting the heart and
blood vessels.” CVD includes heart attack, high
blood pressure, stroke, rheumatic heart disease,
congenital defects, and congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease (CAD) or coronary heart
disease (CHD) means “conditions affecting the
heart and its major blood vessels” — heart
attack and angina pectoris (chest pain due to
narrowed blood vessels).
Myocardial infarction (myo = muscle, cardio =
heart, infarction = blockage) is the formal name
for a heart attack. The name pretty much
describes what happens, but you can read all the
truly excruciating details in Chapter 2.

Heart disease versus heart attack
The United States isn’t alone in its battle with cardiovascular disease (CVD)
and coronary heart disease (CHD) — heart attack. According to the World
Health Organization (WHO), CVD and CHD are the Numero Uno nasties
around the globe. Grouping the rich countries, poor countries, and countries
in-between, WHO statisticians discovered one common thread: Heart disease
kills more people every year than any other illness or medical condition.
Table 1-2 lays out the WHO statistics for causes of death in 2002 and the pre-
dicted figures for 2005. Some points of interest in these figures are as follows:
 Yes, as you read this, 2005 is already several years in the past, and 2002
is practically ancient history. But as every math major knows, in the 
statistics game, several years must pass before you can gather all the
numbers you need to draw a firm conclusion. Hence the lag time.
 Yes, the percentage of the world’s population that succumbs to the vari-
ous forms of cancer is lower than the percentage in the United States.
Why? Because in many poor countries, so many infants die at birth or
expire young of preventable illnesses that there are fewer people who
grow old enough to develop and eventually die of illnesses of older age,
such as cancer or Alzheimer’s disease.

Getting to the Point of This Book
Congratulations! By plunking down some of your hard-earned cash for a 
copy of Controlling Cholesterol For Dummies, 2nd Edition, (or borrowing 
it from a smart friend), you’ve made a commitment to, well, try to control
your cholesterol before it controls you.
And, by slogging your way through a discussion of how your heart works and
a slew of charts with figures proving what I bet you already knew — heart 
disease and heart attack send a great many folks to their ultimate reward —
you’ve shown just how serious you are about getting a handle on those nasty
cholesterol numbers. As a reward, now, by gosh, you’ve reached the heart of
the matter: cholesterol.
16
Part I: Getting Up Close and Personal with Cholesterol 

Why counting cholesterol numbers counts
In the past half century, literally hundreds of well-run scientific studies, 
run by thousands of different researchers in dozens of different countries,
have shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that having high cholesterol —
specifically, high levels of LDLs, particularly the smaller ones described in
Chapter 2 — is a strong warning that Mr. Heart Disease and Ms. Heart Attack
are lying in wait somewhere in the future. Luckily, a similar long list of studies
shows that what you eat and how you live your life to stay fit and relatively
trim can help reduce your risk
How to control your cholesterol risks
What you eat and drink plays an important role in controlling your choles-
terol, as I explain in Part II of this book. So does maintaining a healthful
weight, engaging in a realistic exercise program, and avoiding tobacco (in all
its ugly forms) — three subjects covered in Part III. And if these basic first
steps don’t do the job, cholesterol-lowering medications, discussed in Part IV,
offer yet another option.
Each of these methods for lowering your cholesterol — diet, weight control,
exercise, and medicines — has its own chapter (or two or three) in this book.
As a health-conscious consumer, you get to pick and choose among them —
like a gourmet at a gorgeous buffet table. A low-fat, low-cholesterol buffet
table, of course. After which you can relax with the grab bag of factoids and
funny stuff in Part V — the well-known For Dummies Part of Tens.
Go for it. Your heart will thank you.

Comparing Cholesterol’s 
Risks and Benefits
In This Chapter
 Locating the cholesterol in the human body
 Proving that cholesterol has a good side
 Confirming cholesterol’s risks
 Identifying other harmful compounds in your blood
 Mastering CPR
T
his chapter starts off by covering the ways in which your body uses 
cholesterol for everything from powering your brain to building your sex
hormones. Then — fair is fair — you can find out why something so good can
also be hazardous to your heart health. 
Finally, because cholesterol isn’t the only bad guy to be found in your 
blood, I provide you with a short description of some of the other unhealthy
criminals floating through your bloodstream.
After you’ve made your way through the heavy stuff, reward yourself with 
a bit of fun by taking the heart art quiz at the end of this chapter. The quiz
asks you to match literary, musical, and other heart-related titles with 
their authors.
Shaking Hands with Cholesterol
Cholesterol is the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of the nutrition world. This fat-like
substance is both essential for your healthy body and potentially hazardous
to your heart.

Making the most of cholesterol’s Jekyll-like good characteristics while 
counteracting its Hyde-like bad impulses can be a delicate but not impos-
sible balancing act. The task begins with understanding how and where 
cholesterol does its good work and how and where it can cause problems.
Begin your mission, in the true scientific spirit, at the beginning.
Where cholesterol comes from
Yes, you get some cholesterol from food, but the curious fact is that most 
of the cholesterol in your blood and body tissues is produced right in 
your very own liver. Your liver uses the proteins, fats, and carbohydrates 
in food to manufacture and churn out about 1 gram (1,000 milligrams) of 
cholesterol a day.
How cholesterol travels around your body
Whether your cholesterol comes from food or your liver, it travels through
your bloodstream in particles called lipoproteins, a name derived from lipos
(the Greek word for “fat”) and protos (Greek for “first” or “most important”). 
20
Part I: Getting Up Close and Personal with Cholesterol 
Double trouble
The split-personality title character in Robert
Louis Stevenson’s novel, The Strange Case of Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886), embodies both good
and evil — the two sides of human nature. (Pop
quiz: Which personality is the good guy? Which
one isn’t? See the end of this sidebar for the
answers.)
This sort of duality isn’t uncommon in religion,
philosophy, and literature. For example, the Aztec
god Quetzalcoatl was both male and female. And
Janus, the Roman god of doors, had two faces,
one in the front of his head and one in back,
because every door faces two ways — in and
out. By the way, Janus is the namesake of
January, the door to the New Year.
The Chinese symbol of two-sidedness is the yin
and the yang. The yin symbolizes the female, and
the yang stands for the male. The yin and yang
also symbolize the coexistence of other oppos-
ing concepts, such as life and death, good and
evil, black and white, and love and hate. What
makes this even more interesting is the fact that
the word yin, which sounds totally non-Western,
is a variant on the Scottish word for one.
So, you can see that cholesterol has some com-
pany when it comes to having two sides to a
story. And Jekyll is the good guy; Hyde isn’t.

The fatty substances in lipoproteins include cholesterol and triglycerides, the
most common fatty substance in the human body (more about triglycerides
in the section “Focusing on Other Blood Baddies”). The proteins that com-
bine with fats to produce lipoproteins are called apolipoproteins, often 
abbreviated as apo.
Lipoproteins develop through five distinct phases as they mature into the
particles that carry cholesterol around your body:
 Phase 1: Chylomicrons
 Phase 2: Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs)
 Phase 3: Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs)
 Phase 4: Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs)
 Phase 5: High-density lipoproteins (HDLs)
How does a chylomicron become a VLDL, then an IDL, then an LDL, and
finally, maybe, an HDL? The following roadmap marks the route.
Bringing up baby lipoproteins
A lipoprotein is born as a chylomicron, a particle that your intestinal cells
assemble from the proteins and fats you eat. Chylomicrons are very, very
low-density particles.
Why are some lipoproteins called low-density and others high-density?
 The term density refers to a lipoprotein’s weight.
 Protein weighs more than fat.
 Lipoproteins containing proportionately less protein than fat are low-
density lipoproteins, also known as LDLs. LDLs are the “bad” particles
that carry cholesterol into your arteries.
 Lipoproteins containing proportionately more protein than fat are high-
density lipoproteins, also known as HDLs. HDLs are the “good” particles
that ferry cholesterol out of your body.
Now, back to chylomicrons. These lipoproteins start out with very little pro-
tein and a lot of light and fluffy fat and cholesterol. But as they flow through
your bloodstream from your intestines on their way to your liver (your
body’s lipoprotein factory), the chylomicrons release their fats, known as
triglycerides, into your blood. 
21
Chapter 2: Comparing Cholesterol’s Risks and Benefits

The stripped-down chylomicron, also known as a chylomicron remnant, still
has its cholesterol and protein. Now, the remnant slides into your liver, and
fat comes back into the picture.
Moving through the fat factory
As anyone who has ever read a nutrient chart knows, liver (as a food) is very
high in fat and cholesterol. In fact, your liver is a veritable fat and cholesterol
factory that collects fat fragments from your blood and uses them to make
cholesterol and new fats that your body can use to build tissue and perform
other physiological functions.
The next few sections explain exactly how lipoproteins are made.
Putting the fats in lipoproteins (and taking them out again)
When the chylomicron hits the liver, it picks up fat particles and mutates into
the largest kind of lipoprotein, a fluffy particle called a very low-density
lipoprotein (VLDL).
Then your liver sends the VLDL out into the wide world — your body. As the
VLDL travels far and wide, it drops globs of fat, picks up globs of cholesterol,
and changes into a slightly smaller, heavier particle called an intermediate
low-density lipoprotein (IDL), and then a slightly smaller, heavier low-density
lipoprotein (LDL).
The last step in the transformation of the baby lipoprotein (the chylomicron)
occurs when an LDL has dropped so much fat and cholesterol into body tissue
that it’s mostly protein. Now, you’re looking at a high-density lipoprotein (HDL).
Naming the proteins in lipoproteins
The primary proteins in VLDLs, IDLs, and LDLs belong to a class of
apolipoproteins called apoB. The primary proteins in HDLs belong to a class
of apolipoproteins called apoA. Other less prominent apolipoproteins found
in lipoproteins are apoC and apoE.
You may have heard about a blood test for apoA; this test is interesting
because a high level of apoA indicates a high level of protective HDLs (the
“good” particles that haul cholesterol out of your body).
22
Part I: Getting Up Close and Personal with Cholesterol 

Pinning a blue ribbon on good lipoproteins
HDLs truly deserve the name “good cholesterol.” These particles don’t carry
cholesterol into your arteries for the simple reason that they’re so compact
and dense that they can’t squeeze through the spaces in the walls of your
arteries. As a result, HDLs — and their cholesterol — travel away from your
arteries and out of your body with the rest of your, um, solid waste.
What a neat set of facts to park in the back of your brain for the next time
you’re at a party and someone asks you to explain the differences between
VLDLs, IDLs, LDLs, and HDLs. “Well,” you can say, “it’s all a question of 
density, which, as you know, means. . . .” Don’t you just love being the
smartest kid in class?
The good news about HDLs
You can think of HDLs as scavenger molecules that remove cholesterol from
the arteries. Having a lot of HDLs reduces your risk of heart attack regardless
of your total cholesterol levels. 
In fact, X-ray studies have shown that people who raise their HDLs by exer-
cising, stopping smoking, or taking medication not only reduce the choles-
terol in the arteries but also remove the plaque — thus opening the arteries.
Having read that paragraph carefully, you may assume that all LDLs are bad
guys, right? Wrong.
With LDLs, size may make all the difference
For years, everyone — that is, all the experts evaluating your cholesterol —
conversely believed that a person with a lot of light and mushy LDLs (which
can squeeze through your artery walls) inevitably had a higher risk of heart
attack. The fact that some people with high levels of LDLs sailed happily 
into old age without experiencing heart problems was dismissed as plain
good luck.
Maybe not, says a group of researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine
in New York City. In 2003, looking for clues to longevity, the team, which
included members from the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Tufts
University, Boston University School of Medicine, and Roche Molecular
Systems, ran various tests, including cholesterol tests, on 213 senior citizens,
plus 216 of their children and grandchildren. For comparison, they ran the
same tests on a control group of non-blood relatives, such as the children’s
husbands and wives.
23
Chapter 2: Comparing Cholesterol’s Risks and Benefits

The tests showed something really surprising: The long-lived oldsters were
three times more likely than other people to have a mutation in a gene that
regulates cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), an enzyme that affects the
size of lipoproteins. As a result, compared with other people, including those
non-related husbands and wives, even the oldsters who had high levels of
LDLs had relatively larger low-density lipoproteins. (Their HDLs were also 
relatively bigger.)
According to the Einstein team, led by Dr. Nir Barzilai, the level of LDLs doesn’t
predict heart disease; it’s the size of the LDLs in the mix. In other words,
having many small LDLs may raise the risk of heart attack even if your overall
cholesterol level is low. Definitely more to come on this one.
Believe It or Not, You Need Cholesterol
Your healthy body needs cholesterol, but I haven’t told you the reasons why.
Let me list them now:
 Cholesterol directs the development of some cells in the growing fetus.
 Cholesterol is part of the membrane that surrounds and protects each
cell in your body.
 Cholesterol comprises a major portion of your brain, which is composed
of mostly fatty tissue.
 Cholesterol contributes to the construction of synapses, structures
through which nerve cells transmit messages.
 Cholesterol is a building block for hormones, including the male sex 
hormone testosterone and the vital adrenal hormone cortisone.
 Cholesterol is an ingredient in digestive juices, such as bile.
 Cholesterol is used as a building block for vitamin D, which is made
when sunlight hits the fatty tissue just under your skin.
 And, oh yes, cholesterol is part of body fat.
Is that an impressive list or what? I think it’s impressive as all get out, so I’m
going to take some time to explain exactly how cholesterol performs each of
these incredibly important jobs.
Cholesterol helps your body develop
Cholesterol begins to influence your body even before you’re born.
According to a 1996 report in the journal Science, cholesterol enhances an
embryo’s healthy development by triggering the activity of the specific genes
24
Part I: Getting Up Close and Personal with Cholesterol 

that instruct embryonic cells to become specialized body structures — arms,
legs, spine, and so on. Sadly, as Science reported, approximately one in every
9,000 babies is born with a birth defect linked to the fetus’s failure to make
the cholesterol it needs.
In 2003, researchers at the U.S. National Human Genome Research Institute
linked a pregnant woman’s cholesterol deficiency to a defect in the fetal 
brain called HPE (the failure of the brain to divide normally into two halves).
Ninety-nine percent of embryos with HPE are spontaneously aborted; those
born live experience severe mental retardation, are unable to walk or talk,
and usually die within the first year of life.
To prevent these problems, pregnant women are often advised not to take
cholesterol-lowering drugs.
Cholesterol holds your cells together
Think back to your first chemistry or physics class. Never took chemistry or
physics? Well, then imagine being in class where one of the first things your
teacher wants you to know is that there’s no such thing as a solid substance.
Things that look solid — this book, that lamp, you, and me — are actually
gazillions of individual atoms, molecules, and cells whirling around in space,
held together only by an exchange of electrical charges. If you can’t remem-
ber much chemistry or physics, check out the “Recognizing the difference
between an atom, a molecule, and a body cell” sidebar in this chapter. Mark
your place, read the sidebar, and then come right back.
Okay, as I was saying, some things that look solid aren’t solid. They’re simply
groups of cells held together by electrical charges that keep the cells in place
so that a piece of this page or a piece of your finger doesn’t go spinning off
into space. Individual cells stay intact because they have a cell membrane, an
outer skin that serves as neat and tidy packaging for the cell.
One requirement for healthy cell membranes is — drumroll please — 
cholesterol. A whopping 90 percent of all the cholesterol in your body is 
in your cell membranes. The cholesterol protects the integrity of the cell
membrane, helping to keep it flexible and strong.
If you were to diet so stringently or use so many cholesterol-lowering drugs
that your cholesterol level fell to zero (an impossibility by the way), your 
cell membranes would be very dry and easily torn. The stuff inside the cells
would leak out, and cells would die all over the place. That would sort of put
an end to the whole darn shootin’ match. Every healthy body cell needs
some cholesterol, and so does every healthy brain.
25
Chapter 2: Comparing Cholesterol’s Risks and Benefits

Cholesterol builds your gray matter
As French philosopher René Descartes so eloquently wrote in 1637, “I think,
therefore I am.” The organ that enables you to think — and therefore, to 
be — is your brain, a marvelous structure composed primarily of water 
and fat.
The average human brain weighs about 3 pounds. Up to 78 percent of that
weight is water. Some of the weight is protein (8 percent), some is carbohy-
drates (1 percent), and some is a grab bag of organic and inorganic com-
pounds (3 percent). The rest (up to 12 percent) is fat, including — surprise,
surprise — cholesterol.
Cholesterol on the brain? You bet. As I explain in the next section, without
cholesterol, your brain cells can’t send the messages that power every other
organ in your body and, most importantly, make it possible for you to think.
To paraphrase Descartes, “Wow!”
26
Part I: Getting Up Close and Personal with Cholesterol 
Recognizing the difference between an 
atom, a molecule, and a body cell
Atoms are the basic building blocks of 
elements — hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and all
their chemical cousins.
Each atom carries the name of the element it
represents (such as hydrogen). In addition, each
atom has a shorthand symbol — call it a nick-
name — such as H for hydrogen. Sometimes, an
atom’s shorthand name seems totally divorced
from its full name. For example, lead atoms are
called, well, lead atoms, but the symbol for a lead
atom is Pb, from plumbum, the Latin word for
lead. There are also elements and atoms named
for human beings. For example, seaborgium is
named for Nobel Laureate Glenn T. Seaborg; its
shorthand symbol is Sg.
Individual atoms form bonds with other atoms
to create clusters of atoms called molecules. To
write the name of a molecule — its formula —
you write the symbols of the different atoms that
the molecule contains and the number of each
type of atom right after the symbol. For exam-
ple, if I write H2O, the formula for the water mol-
ecule, you know immediately that a water
molecule has two hydrogen atoms and one
oxygen atom.
A body cell, the smallest independent unit of a
living creature, is a collection of molecules.
And you, wonderful reader, are a collection 
of cells.

Cholesterol revs up your nerve cells
The fact that you have cholesterol in your brain tissue isn’t a new discovery,
but the knowledge of what the cholesterol actually does up there is new. 
In November 2001, a group of French and German researchers at the Max-
Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in Berlin reported something 
extraordinary, so extraordinary that the lead researcher told fellow scientists
at a meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, “We were definitely shocked.”
Before getting to the shocking part, take a timeout for a short but important
lesson in neurology. About 90 percent of the cells in your brain are non-nerve
cells called glial cells. Glial cells aren’t the cells through which brain cells
communicate, so they have always seemed sort of blah.
Now comes the shocking part. The guys at Max-Delbruck discovered that
glial cells contain cholesterol, which enables them to secrete a molecule that
encourages the formation of synapses, teensy junctions in the brain where
messages are exchanged among nerve cells. The molecule secreted by the
glial cell is called apolipoprotein E (apoE). When the Berlin researchers added
plain cholesterol to nerve cells in a laboratory dish, the nerve cells began to
form synapses like crazy.
So should you start stuffing yourself with cholesterol-rich foods to jump-start
your brain? In a word, no. Your glial cells make all the cholesterol your brain
requires. The point of this section is just to let you know what cholesterol is
doing up there in your head.
Cholesterol is part of your hormones
What else can one wonder fat do? “What else?” you ask? How about, it helps
make you sexy?
Chemically speaking, cholesterol is a sterol, a compound made of hydrogen
and oxygen atoms arranged in a series of ring-like structures with chain-like
attachments of atoms hanging off the sides. Your body uses cholesterol to
synthesize other sterol compounds, such as the adrenal hormone cortisol,
the fat-soluble nutrient vitamin D, and — yes, indeed — the male sex 
hormone, testosterone.
Figure 2-1 shows the structure of the cholesterol molecule, and Figure 2-2
shows the structure of the molecule for testosterone. See how similar they
are? Didn’t expect that, did you?
27
Chapter 2: Comparing Cholesterol’s Risks and Benefits

Cholesterol powers up 
your digestive system
The gallbladder is a small organ that sits atop your small intestine. In pictures
of the digestive system, the gallbladder is often colored green because it
secretes a greenish liquid called bile or bile acids, digestive compounds based
on — you got it — cholesterol.
On their own, fats — including the fats in food — don’t mix with water. Fat
molecules and water molecules lack the chemical hooks-and-eyes (the proper
electrical charges) needed to form bonds between their molecules. As a
result, when you swallow fat-rich foods, the fat floats on top of the watery
food and liquid mixture in your stomach, which means that fat-busting 
digestive enzymes in the mix below can’t reach it. But as fatty food moves
through your digestive tract into your small intestine, an intestinal hormone
called cholestokinin beeps your gallbladder, signaling it to release bile.
Bile is an emulsifier, a substance that makes it possible for fat to mix with
water so you can digest and absorb dietary fats and fat-soluble nutrients
such as vitamins A, D, E, and K.

Without cholesterol, you wouldn’t be able to make bile or bile acids. Without
bile and bile acids, you wouldn’t be able to absorb fats. Without fats, you
wouldn’t be able to manufacture fatty tissue, which cushions your organs,
keeps your body warm, and serves as a base for various body chemicals. And
that state of affairs isn’t compatible with a healthy, comfortable life. So thank
your lucky stars that you have the cholesterol you need to make the bile and
bile acids that process fat.
Breaking the Bad News
By now, you may be convinced that everything you’ve ever read about 
cholesterol is wrong, wrong, wrong. In fact, you may be muttering to yourself,
“Hey, where can I get some more of this great stuff?” Well, hold your horses,
cowboy. I hate to be the one to break this to you, but cholesterol can be a 
villain as well as a hero.
Yes, cholesterol protects your cells, maintains your brainpower, helps make
hormones and vitamins, and on, and on, and on. But under certain circum-
stances, it can block your arteries and trigger — Oh no! — a heart attack. It’s
all in the lipoproteins. This section focuses on cholesterol’s not-so-good
effects on your body.
Cholesterol may endanger your heart
LDLs are the most common fat-and-protein particles in your body. Like their
parents, the VLDLs and their cousins the IDLs, LDLs are soft enough to
squeeze between the cells of your blood vessel walls, dragging cholesterol
into your coronary arteries (the blood vessels leading away from your heart).
Once inside an artery, cholesterol particles may get caught on the infinite
number of chinks in the artery wall. Stuck in place, the cholesterol now snags
other particles floating by, eventually creating deposits called plaque. In time,
the plaque on the artery wall may grow thick enough to block the flow of
blood through the blood vessel, or a piece of plaque may break off, triggering
the formation of a blood clot that can also block the artery. Either way, the
sequence is called a heart attack.
As a general rule, heart docs assume that the more cholesterol you have
floating through your bloodstream — especially the “bad” LDL cholesterol —
the higher your risk for plaque build-up in your arteries and the higher your
risk of a heart attack. In other words, to lower your risk of heart attack, you
must lower your cholesterol, particularly those “bad” LDLs.
29
Chapter 2: Comparing Cholesterol’s Risks and Benefits

But this simple equation may not be the solution for every human body. 
In December 2007, the results from a clinical trial of the new drug ezetimibe
(Zetia) showed that taking the medicine, either alone or in combination with
the statin drug simvastatin (Zocor), definitely lowered “bad” cholesterol, but
also hastened the buildup of arterial plaque for some of the people in the trial.
In other words, simply lowering their LDLs did not protect these people 
from a heart attack. Something else, such as an individual tendency to pile 
up arterial plaque, also seemed to be at work. (Conversely, people with high
cholesterol but clear arteries may have the opposite attribute — an inherent
ability to resist plaque — that explains the puzzle of why some people with
high cholesterol do not have heart attacks.)
You can read more about the ezetimibe trial in Chapter 12, which lays out the
facts on various cholesterol-buster meds. Right here, the take-away point is
that when you’re talking medicine, never assume that one size — or one
theory — fits all.
Cholesterol can clog your brain
This is a very short section because everything you need to know about 
how cholesterol may be hazardous to your brain can be summed up in one
word — ditto.
That’s ditto to what you’ve just read about cholesterol and your coronary
arteries. Having high levels of cholesterol may also increase the risk of
plaque in a cranial artery. Plaque can block the flow of blood traveling
through a cranial artery to your brain, triggering a stroke.
Prevention is another ditto. The preventative steps that you can take in 
relation to your coronary arteries and your heart can also benefit your 
cranial arteries and your brain.
Cholesterol can build boulders 
in your gallbladder
Cholesterol is a building block for the bile you need to digest fats. This side
of cholesterol behaves like the good Dr. Jekyll. But every yin has its yang, and
the bad Mr. Hyde is gallstones.
30
Part I: Getting Up Close and Personal with Cholesterol 

A gallstone is a rock-like lump that forms when the normal percentages of fat
in bile change so that the fat (in this case cholesterol) clumps in a lump in
your gallbladder or in the duct leading from the gallbladder to your intestines.
Approximately 80 to 95 percent of all gallstones are made primarily of choles-
terol. (The rest are made primarily of calcium.)
According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Disease (NIDDK), as many as 42 million Americans have gallstones. Many 
of the risk factors for cholesterol gallstones are the same as those for heart 
disease, such as the following:
 Diabetes
 High-cholesterol diet
 Obesity
 Smoking
But here’s an odd fact: Yes, being overweight raises your risk of gallstones,
but so does going on a diet and losing weight very rapidly. 
When your body is deprived of its normal quota of calories and fat, your liver
is likely to increase its natural production of cholesterol (see the “Where 
cholesterol comes from” section back toward the beginning of this chapter).
Sometimes you can’t win for losing, which includes the symptoms, signs, and
consequences of gallstones: pain, nausea, belching, vomiting, fever, chills,
and, maybe, surgery to remove your gallbladder.
If your doctor recommends yanking out the offending organ, not to worry. 
Or at least not too much. True, all surgery has potential risks, but modern
gallbladder surgery is performed laparoscopically (translation: through very
small incisions that heal quickly).
Once the gallbladder is out, you probably won’t notice much change in your
ability to eat what you want. Your gallbladder is just a storage bin where bile
produced by the liver is parked until your body yells, “Yo! Send down some
bile.” After surgery, your liver still produces bile, which still makes its way
into the intestine to help you digest fats. 
While some people do develop gastric rumbles, okay, diarrhea, after eating 
a large, very fatty meal, most patients do just fine so long as they stick with
food/meals containing moderate amounts of fat. What’s moderate varies 
from person to person. If you exceed your own personal limit, trust me, you
will know.

Chapter 2: Comparing Cholesterol’s Risks and Benefits

Focusing on Other Blood Baddies
Although cholesterol gets most of the buzz, it isn’t the only substance in your
blood that increases your risk of heart disease. Two other problematic com-
pounds discussed in this section are homocysteine and triglycerides. The
first is an amino acid; the second is a thoroughly useful fat.
Hunting homocysteine
Amino acids are the building blocks of protein. Most amino acids are friendly
to your body, but homocysteine is a potentially hostile amino acid released
when you digest protein foods. Researchers have conducted about a dozen
important homocysteine studies in recent years, and most of the studies
have demonstrated a clear link between high homocysteine levels (called
hyperhomocysteinemia) and an increased risk of heart attack. The reasons for
this connection are still a mystery. The current theory is that homocysteine
may chew up cells in the lining of your blood vessels, trigger blood clots, or
produce debris that blocks the arteries.
The American Heart Association (AHA) hasn’t yet labeled hyperhomocys-
teinemia a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. But the AHA does re-
commend that people who have at least one other known risk factor for heart
disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, or a
family history of heart disease, attempt to lower their homocysteine level.
32
Part I: Getting Up Close and Personal with Cholesterol 
Tick. Tock.
According to Yasuko Rikihisa, professor of veteri-
nary biosciences at Ohio State University, people
with high cholesterol may be more susceptible to
human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis (HGA), a
disease transmitted by Ixodes scapularis (deer
tick), the little buggers that spread Lyme disease.
HGA attacks granulocytes, cells the immune
system uses to knock out infectious agents such
as bacteria. In Rikihisa’s lab, mice with high cho-
lesterol were less able than mice with normal
cholesterol levels to fight off HGA.
Should you worry about those mice? Maybe.
The United States experiences up to 1,000 cases
of HGA a year, but the symptoms of HGA are so
similar to those caused by flu that many cases
may go undetected. Once diagnosed, HGA can
be treated with antibiotics; left untreated, HGA,
like flu, may be fatal for those who are very
young, very old, or have a weakened immune
system. In other words, watch your cholesterol
and never ignore a tick bite. But you knew that
already, right?

How do you lower homocysteine? No problem. The good news is that 
consuming adequate amounts of the B vitamins — folic acid (also known as
folacin or folates), vitamin B6 (also known as pyridoxal, pyridoxine, and pyri-
doxamine), and vitamin B12 — efficiently lowers the amount of homocysteine
in your blood.
If you’re at high risk, check with your doctor to see how you can include
foods high in B vitamins in your diet. Table 2-1 lists the homocysteine fighters
and some of the foods you can find them in. It hasn’t been shown, however,
that lowering homocysteine levels in the blood reduces the incidence of
heart disease.

Tracking triglycerides
Ninety-five percent of the fats in foods are triglycerides, compounds that 
contain one molecule of glycerin and three (tri) molecules of fatty acids.
Triglycerides are also the most common fats in your body. You use them to
 Build adipose (fatty tissue)
 Build cholesterol
 Fuel your energy
Chapter 5 has a complete definition of the different kinds of fats and fatty
acids in your food. For the moment, just take my word for the fact that
triglycerides are made of one unit of glycerol and three fatty acids. 
Glycerol is a small, water-soluble carbohydrate that carries fats through
blood; fatty acids are chains of carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms attached.
33
Chapter 2: Comparing Cholesterol’s Risks and Benefits

You get some triglycerides from food. You also manufacture them in your liver
using carbohydrates, alcohol, and some of the cholesterol in food. Either way,
high levels of triglycerides are a risk factor for heart disease because, like 
cholesterol, triglycerides — which travel in lipoproteins — can rough up the
lining of your arteries, which enables floating particles to get stuck and begin
to build plaque that can clog the artery, leading to a heart attack.
How high is high? Check out Chapter 3 where you can also find a whole
bunch of tests designed to rate your risk of heart disease.
Clearly, you want to keep your triglycerides in the normal range, which
means watching what you eat. But here’s an interesting fact: A diet that’s very
low in fat and very high in carbohydrate foods, such as veggies, fruits, and
grains — the quintessential “good heart” diet — may actually raise your
triglycerides rather than lower them.
To lower your triglycerides, the AHA recommends eating a reasonable
amount of polyunsaturated fats. No kidding. Read all about fats in Chapter 5.
So much reading, so little time.
Warning! Heart Attack in Progress!
You say, “Heart attack.” Your doctor says, “Myocardial infarction.” Either way,
heart attacks occur when the blood supply to your heart muscle is suddenly
reduced or completely shut off. This reduction in blood supply is most 
commonly caused by a piece of plaque that breaks off from an artery wall,
triggering the formation of a blood clot. That is why a coronary artery filled
with a lesser amount of soft plaque (which can break off easily) is more 
dangerous than an artery filled with hard plaque.
The damage caused by a heart attack is due directly to how long the artery is
blocked and how long your heart muscle and your brain don’t get the oxygen
they need. Clearly, the faster a heart attack victim gets medical attention, the
better his or her chances of surviving with minimal damage.
Knowing the symptoms
To get help, you need to recognize the classic symptoms of a heart attack:
 Pressure or pain in the center of your chest that lasts longer than a few
minutes. Some people describe the pain as feeling like an elephant is 
sitting on their chests.
34
Part I: Getting Up Close and Personal with Cholesterol 

 Pain that starts in your chest and spreads out to your shoulders, up
your neck, to your jaw, or down your arms.
 Pain in your chest plus
• Feelings of lightheadedness
• Nausea or heavy sweating
• Shortness of breath
• All of these symptoms, all at once
This list sounds definitive, but it isn’t. Diagnosing a heart attack is tricky 
business because any one of the symptoms listed above — on its own, 
without any pain — may also be a heart attack alert.
Sometimes, simple lightheadedness (what an awkward word) or nausea is 
the body’s way of saying, “Listen up! We’re in trouble here!” This is especially
true for women who, as a group, are likely to experience much less severe
heart attack symptoms than men do. The lesson? Better safe than sorry.
Chest pain or a feeling of “tightness” (sometimes described as a rubber band
tightening around your chest) or pressure (sometimes described as “an el-
ephant sitting on your chest”) that comes on with exertion such as walking
up a slight hill, especially in cold weather, or climbing an ordinary flight of
stairs that hadn’t caused problems in the past is a suspicious symptom. You
should see your doctor or go to the emergency room immediately lest your
symptoms signal an imminent heart attack.
As soon as you suspect that someone is having a heart attack, the American
Heart Association recommends taking (or giving) one 325-milligram aspirin.
The aspirin is a blood thinner. According to the AHA, taking the aspirin at the
onset of symptoms lowers the risk of dying by 23 percent. Would you believe
that only 20 to 40 percent of all heart attack victims follow this simple 
recommendation that the AHA insists could save 10,000 lives a year?
Never, ever ignore signs of a problem. Don’t panic, but do move quickly. Dial
911 or your local emergency medical service (EMS) to summon an ambulance
staffed by EMS technicians who are trained to treat heart attack victims. 
The ambulance is likely to get to you faster than you can get to the hospital,
especially if you’re the one having the heart attack and would have to 
drive yourself.
35
Chapter 2: Comparing Cholesterol’s Risks and Benefits

Yes, yes, yes. If the hospital is right across the street, you should just go. 
But will you go? Will your friend? Maybe not. According to the AHA, denial is
common. Many heart attack victims refuse to believe that they’re having a
heart attack. That attitude can be a killer, robbing you (or your friend) of 
precious time. 
Never ignore signs of a heart attack. If you’re with someone who’s having
symptoms, don’t take no for an answer. Your friend may protest now, but
she’ll thank you later when she’s still alive.
Becoming a coronary lifeguard
One type of heart attack is due to a cholesterol-related blockage of an artery.
A second type of heart attack is cardiac arrest, a sudden interruption in the
heartbeat that effectively stops the circulation of blood and oxygen through-
out the body, leading fairly quickly to the phenomenon called sudden death.
The American Heart Association estimates that more than half the people
who experience cardiac arrest outside a hospital setting can be saved if
someone in the immediate vicinity knows how to perform cardiopulmonary
resuscitation, commonly called CPR.
CPR uses physical compression of the patient’s chest along with breathing
into his mouth to restart the heart while providing desperately needed
oxygen. If you don’t already know CPR, get familiar with it. The life you save
won’t be your own — even if you’re so flexible that you can wrap your legs
behind your ears, you can’t do CPR on yourself — but your skill may 
someday save someone near and dear to you.
The following sections cover three ways to discover how to perform CPR.
Join a CPR class
The absolutely best way to master CPR is to take classes from a live instruc-
tor in a room with live people. You practice on an inflatable dummy and not
the person standing next to you, but being in class gives you the opportunity
to ask questions that can help perfect your technique.
To find classes in your area, do an Internet search for the American Heart
Association. After you reach the home page, slide your mouse down the left
side of the page and click “Local info.” Then click the name of your state to
get the phone number for your local AHA chapter.

You may also find CPR classes at your local YMCA/YWCA, a police precinct,
or a firehouse. In addition, many businesses now conduct classes on site for
their employees. If yours doesn’t, maybe this is one suggestion to drop in the
work comment box.

Heart art
Once upon a time, poets, authors, playwrights,
and just about everyone else thought of the heart
as the seat of some of our warmest emotions, 
not as an organ in distress. Some of this senti-
ment is still around — consider the late 
20th-century illustration, “I  you.” So, as
promised in the intro, I end this chapter on a
warm and fuzzy note.
Heart art is an opportunity to revisit this simpler
point of view. Match the heart-related story, play,
song, and film titles with their authors. While
scoring high isn’t necessarily the point, getting
seven or more answers correct qualifies you as
a heart specialist. If you fall on the younger side

T
his chapter is totally straightforward. The information here has just one
purpose: to provide answers to three basic questions and make it pos-
sible for you to evaluate your own cholesterol-related risk of heart disease 
(the whole range of heart problems) and heart attack (the 800-pound gorilla).
As for those three basic questions, here they are:
 Question #1: What’s the real definition of high cholesterol?
 Question #2: Who’s likely to have high cholesterol?
 Question #3: Are you at risk for high cholesterol?
My editors remind me that I should tell you to grab a pencil before you start
reading this chapter because I include several tests for you to fill out at the
end. Meanwhile, avanti! (That’s Italian for, “Let’s get to it!”)

Categorizing Cholesterol as a Risk Factor
Generally, medical risk factors fit into one of three basic categories:
 Risk factors you can’t control
 Risk factors you can control
 Risk factors whose effects you can lessen but not entirely eliminate
High cholesterol is an interesting risk factor because it fits into all three of
these categories. Take a look at the evidence:
 Your genes determine how much cholesterol your body produces natu-
rally, so high cholesterol may be a risk factor you can’t control.
 You can take one of several different cholesterol-lowering drugs designed
to pull your cholesterol down to safe levels, so high cholesterol may be a
risk factor you can control. (For more about cholesterol-lowering drugs,
check out Chapter 12.)
 You can change your diet, lose weight, and exercise to increase your
“good” cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), while lowering your
“bad” cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), so high cholesterol (or
at least high “bad” cholesterol) may be a risk factor whose effects you
can soften.
My point? Although high cholesterol is an important risk factor for heart 
disease — and decreasing your longevity — you have a leading role to play 
in controlling the risk. What you eat, how you spend your leisure time, and
how you work with your doctor have much to do with determining where
your rank is on the cholesterol scale. Interesting proposition, eh?
Adding Up Your Basic 
Cholesterol Numbers
Before you decide what to do about your cholesterol, you need to know how
much cholesterol you actually have. So get up, march over to your doctor’s
office, and hold out your arm so your doctor can stick a hollow needle 
into the vein in the crook of your elbow and draw about 20 milliliters (ml) 
of bright, red blood. Then when you go home, the little glass tube holding
your blood goes off to a medical laboratory where a technician counts the
40
Part I: Getting Up Close and Personal with Cholesterol 

cholesterol particles. The results you get back look like this: 225 mg/dL.
Translation: You have 225 milligrams of total cholesterol in every deciliter 
(1⁄10 liter) of blood.
But these numbers don’t paint the whole picture. The figures for your low-
density lipoproteins (VLDLs, IDLs, LDLs) and high-density lipoproteins (HDLs)
are still missing. Shaky on the details? You can read all about these little fellas
in Chapter 2, which explains that lipoproteins are fat-and-protein particles
that carry cholesterol into your arteries (LDLs) or out of your body (HDLs),
which is why HDLs are “good” and some of the LDLs are “bad.”
The problem with simple finger-stick tests such as those found in cholesterol
home-testing kits is that they only measure total cholesterol levels — no
HDLs and no LDLs. An incomplete result (total cholesterol alone) can scare
you to death if it shows you have high total cholesterol without letting you
know that you — lucky girl! lucky boy! — also have high HDLs. The finger-
stick test can also provide false reassurance if it shows a low total cholesterol
level without letting you know that your LDLs are also very low.
Now that you know all this and have an accurate, complete doctor’s report in
hand, what do the results say about you? How can you tell if the numbers are
high, low, or in-between?
Defining Higher, Lower, Medium — 
and Just Right
The information you need to grade your cholesterol levels comes from the
usual suspects — I mean the usual experts: the National Cholesterol
Education Program (NCEP) at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
(NHLBI), an arm of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
In 2001, the NCEP issued a report called ATP III, short for The Third Report of
the Expert Panel on the Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood
Cholesterol in Adults. In this report, the NCEP said:
 A total cholesterol level higher than 240 mg/dL translates into a “high
risk” for heart disease.
 A total cholesterol level between 200 and 239 mg/dL means there’s a
“moderate risk” for heart disease.
 A total cholesterol level below 200 mg/dL is “desirable.”
41
Chapter 3: Rating Your Cholesterol-Related Risk

Regardless of total cholesterol levels, the risk of heart attack is highest
among men whose HDLs are lower than 37 mg/dL and women whose HDLs
are lower than 47 mg/dL. Conversely, the risk of heart attack is lowest among
men whose HDLs are higher than 53 mg/dL and women whose HDLs are
higher than 60 mg/dL.
Table 3-1 shows the current descriptions of various levels of total cholesterol,
LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol.

lines/cholesterol/atglance.htm.
But in July 2004, just when everyone thought they had the numbers down
pat, the experts at the NCEP added a footnote: People at high risk should
push their LDLs down below 100 mg/dL, a task that requires taking one or
more of the cholesterol-busting drugs described in Chapter 12.
Are these recommendations final? Probably not. Experience shows that 
precise numbers for healthful cholesterol levels can change at any moment.
What doesn’t change are the basics: Higher HDLs are good. Lower LDLs are
good. Sooner or later, like Goldilocks and the Three Bears, someone will
figure out exactly how low and how high is just right.

Part I: Getting Up Close and Personal with Cholesterol 

Listing Other Risk Factors
According to the American Heart Association, as you read this chapter an
estimated 105,200,000 Americans have total cholesterol levels higher than
200 mg/dL, putting them all into the borderline high category; 36.6 million of
those have high total cholesterol levels above 240 mg/dL. Who are all these
people? What puts them into these special high-risk categories?
Age and gender
Among people younger than 50, men are more likely to have high cholesterol.
After age 50, women edge into the lead. Either way, a woman’s blood vessels
are more elastic than a man’s blood vessels. As a result, women have a little
more protection than men throughout their lives against a blood clot that
may block their blood vessels and trigger a heart attack.
43
Chapter 3: Rating Your Cholesterol-Related Risk
Blood simple
Blood circulates through a system of vessels
called arteries and veins. Arteries carry blood
away from the heart; veins carry blood back to
the heart. The average human body has about 5
quarts of blood. Large people may have slightly
more; small people may have slightly less. Every
60 seconds, about 1⁄5 quart of blood flows out of
your heart through your coronary arteries. Sixty
seconds after that, the blood zips through your
entire circulatory system and heads back to 
your heart.
The life span of one red blood cell is about 120
days for a man and about 14 days less for a
woman. Men have more red blood cells — about
4.5 to 6.2 million per cubic microliter of blood
compared to 4 to 5.5 million for women. Because
males have more red blood cells, they also have
higher values of hemoglobin, the pigment in red
blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the
body. They also have higher levels of iron, an
important element in hemoglobin.
White blood cells play a primary role in your
immune system as avengers that zero in on
invaders, such as bacteria, to chew them up and
spit them out. The normal number of white blood
cells is exactly the same for men and women —
4,100 to 10,900 per microliter of blood.
Blood is a vehicle for nutrients, medications, and
other circulating particles such as — what a sur-
prise — the lipoproteins that carry cholesterol.
By the way, the blood for a cholesterol test
always comes from a vein, not an artery. Blood
from a vein is easier and safer to obtain, and it’s
a representative sample of what’s in your body.
And yes, clenching your fist does make your vein
pop up so it’s easier to puncture.

Pregnancy — strictly a female activity — lowers a woman’s levels of good
HDLs, but a study of 1,051 women conducted by researchers at Kaiser
Permanente in Oakland, California, showed that nursing the newborn for
longer than three months is protective and reduces the decline of HDLs.
Counting kids’ cholesterol
The cholesterol levels shown in Table 3-1 earlier in this chapter are for
grown-ups. (Translation: Adults are people between the ages of 20 and 74.)
The recommendations for children are a different story. A child’s total 
cholesterol level rises slowly from age 2 to age 10 and then begins to rise and
fall in a gender-related pattern. According to University of Texas (Houston)
researcher Darwin R. Labarthe, a girl’s cholesterol level is likely to peak
around age 9, a boy’s around age 16. Conversely, a girl’s cholesterol level
goes down for a while around age 16; a boy’s cholesterol goes down for a
while around age 17.
All adults should be tested at least once to establish a baseline cholesterol
reading; if the level is higher than it should be, more frequent testing may be
required. But as of this writing, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
only recommends cholesterol testing for a relatively small number of children:
 Kids with a parent or grandparent who had a heart attack, suffered a
stroke, or received a diagnosis of coronary artery disease before age 55
 Children whose parents have high cholesterol (above 240 mg/dL)
The recommendations of the American Heart Association (AHA) are similar
to those of the AAP. The AHA suggests only testing children older than the
age of 2 who have a family history of coronary artery disease — a parent or 
a grandparent with high cholesterol or a history of heart disease. 
Table 3-2 shows the AHA-recommended cholesterol levels for children and
adolescents between the ages of 2 and 19.

Gilding the golden years
Pssst! Come over here. I have a secret to share with you. As people turn 70
and sail into their eighth decade, their cholesterol level becomes a less
important predictor of death by heart disease.
What should you make of this?
 Perhaps people who die of cholesterol-induced coronary artery disease
simply check out earlier in life. After all, cholesterol is often described
as a risk factor for an early heart attack.
 Perhaps, as you age, your cholesterol level becomes less important than
your overall health.
 Perhaps total cholesterol levels aren’t as important as LDL and HDL
levels, which aren’t reflected in studies that show the decreasing 
importance of cholesterol levels as a predictor of death by heart disease
as people age.
Should you rush out to tell grandma and grandpa to toss out that salad and
start gorging on high-fat, high-cholesterol foods? Not yet. But you can send
them a postcard with this comment from the American Heart Association:
“The issue of cholesterol levels in the elderly is still unclear.”
45
Chapter 3: Rating Your Cholesterol-Related Risk
Lower isn’t always safer
You get your blood test back from your doctor 
and — wonder of wonders — your cholesterol
has dropped! Time to celebrate? Not necessarily.
A steady, gradual decrease in cholesterol due to
a cholesterol-control diet (see Chapter 4) or one
of the new cholesterol-lowering medications
(see Chapter 12) is great. But a sudden, 
unexplained decline in total cholesterol —
hypocholesterolemia in doctor-speak — may be
a pre-clinical sign (something that shows up
before disease is evident) of malnutrition, an
overactive thyroid, cirrhosis of the liver, certain
forms of cancer, or genetic mutations. All of
these factors can drop total cholesterol levels to
the basement (<100 mg/dL).
And get this: According to a 2007 report on a
2,000-person study at the Aging Research Center
at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden,
a sudden unexplained drop in cholesterol levels
at mid-life, around age 50, may be a risk factor for
cognitive problems (translation: dementia) later
on. Sometimes it seems you can’t win for losing!

Ethnicity
The cholesterol stats on ethnic groups in the United States are, to put it
mildly, incomplete. Many stats exist for non-Hispanic Blacks, non-Hispanic
Whites, and Mexican Americans. Scattered statistics exist for Native
Americans, but there are no numbers for other ethnic groupings. As a result,
given the variety of human beings in the U.S., it’s hard to figure out exactly
which ethnic groups are most at risk of high cholesterol.
Nonetheless, Table 3-3, Table 3-4, and Table 3-5 provide useful — though,
repeat, incomplete — guides. The tables show the percentage of 99,900,000
Americans (48,400,000 men and 51,500,000 women) age 20 and older whose
cholesterol, LDL, or HDL levels put them at increased risk of heart disease 
in 2003.
Yes, this study predates the American Heart Association estimate of
105,200,000 adults with cholesterol levels above 200 mg/dL cited above 
(see “Listing Other Risk Factors” earlier in this chapter). That’s life in 
statistics-land.

Evaluating Your Own Risk Factors File
Now that you know what’s high and what’s low in the wide world of choles-
terol and who’s likely to have high cholesterol and who isn’t, you can turn
your attention to the specifics for one person: you. This section helps you
figure out your very own personal risk of having high cholesterol. Begin at
the beginning: your family.
47
Chapter 3: Rating Your Cholesterol-Related Risk

The family
Your family history says a lot about your future. Your genes are a family trait,
so if your first-degree relatives — father, mother, brothers, and sisters —
have high cholesterol, you may too. If your father or brother had a heart
attack when he was younger than 55 or your mother or sister had a heart
attack before she turned 65, you need to watch your other risk factors.
But, all things being relative, your relatives’ cholesterol levels may not mirror
yours. In my family, my mother has high cholesterol, and so do I. My father
had low cholesterol, and so does my sister who, I might point out, also got
the good nails and curly hair. Life can be sooooooo unfair!
You, yourself, and you
Some medical conditions either affect your risk of having high cholesterol 
or intensify cholesterol’s bad effects. If you have one of these conditions, you
probably already know about the risks. But it never hurts to be sure, so
here’s the scoop.
High blood pressure (hypertension)
Blood pressure is the force exerted by your heart when it pushes blood out
into your arteries. When your arteries are clear and clean, your heart has an
easy job: The blood flows easily into the arteries, and your blood pressure 
is normal.
48
Part I: Getting Up Close and Personal with Cholesterol 
When the “A” list rates a “B”
According to Ronald M. Krauss of the University
of California (Berkeley), not everyone is created
equal when it comes to LDL (the “bad” choles-
terol) production. First in 2001 and then in follow-
up studies in 2004 and 2005, Krauss proposed
that genes tend to divide people into two groups
of LDL-makers.
Some people — the A list — make big, bouncy
LDLs. Others — the B list — make smaller, denser
LDLs. (Need to know more about density — as in
low-density lipoproteins? See Chapter 2.)
The B people tend to get better results when they
go on low-fat, carb-based diets to reduce over-
all cholesterol levels, dropping levels of both the
big LDLs and the little LDLs, which results in an
overall reduction in LDL cholesterol. The A
people lose a lot of big, non-threatening LDLs, but
their overall level of small, dense LDLs (the bad
guys) rises. The catch is that nobody has yet
identified the gene that determines whether you
are an A or a B. Stay tuned.

But if your arteries have been narrowed — perhaps by cholesterol plaque
buildup on the inside walls — your heart must contract more strongly and
push harder to get the blood out into the vessel. As a result, blood is pushed
out of the heart at higher-than-normal pressure. The high-pressure stream 
of blood bouncing against arterial walls can worsen the damage caused by
cholesterol and plaque. (The damage is called arteriosclerosis or “hardening
of the arteries.”)
How can you tell if you have high blood pressure? Look at your blood 
pressure reading. You’ll see two numbers written like this: 130/90 or 130/90
mm/Hg. The first number, the systolic reading, is the pressure exerted by 
your heart when it contracts (beats) to pump out blood. The second number,
the diastolic reading, is the force exerted by your heart between beats.
The letters mm/Hg stand for millimeters/mercury. (Hg is the chemical symbol
for mercury.) These terms are part of the reading because your doctor mea-
sures blood pressure by how high (in millimeters) mercury rises on the little
gauge attached to the blood pressure cuff wrapped around your arm. Reading
the gauge is similar to reading the temperature on a thermometer as the 
mercury inside the thermometer’s glass tube rises or falls when warmed 
or cooled.
For years and years, doctors considered an adult’s blood pressure normal
when the systolic reading was lower than 130 mm/Hg and the diastolic 
reading was lower than 90 mm/Hg (130/90), but the newest numbers from 
the experts at the National Institutes of Health now put normal at 120/80. And
as with cholesterol, there are varying degrees of normal when it comes to
describing blood pressure.
Table 3-6 shows the most recent categorization of blood-pressure levels from
the National Institutes of Health, starting with optimal (translation: the best
possible result), and running up (or down) through normal and high normal
to the various stages of hypertension (higher than high, and potentially 
hazardous to your health).

Chapter 3: Rating Your Cholesterol-Related Risk

If you already have high blood pressure, your doctor has no doubt told you
about the basic strategies you can use to control it:
 Lose weight.
 Change your diet.
 Exercise.
 Take a pill.
Strangely enough, these steps sound just like the ways to control cholesterol.
Think of them as a medical two-for-one coupon!
Diabetes
People with diabetes often have frighteningly high cholesterol levels. I’m 
not talking your piddling 240 mg/dL reading here. No, what I mean is a 
cholesterol level hovering around — hold your hat — 500 mg/dL.
People with diabetes also have high blood-levels of insulin, the hormone pro-
duced by the pancreas and used to digest food. Yes, I know, you may have
thought that people with diabetes have low levels of insulin. Actually, people
with diabetes do produce less insulin than healthy people do, but they also
have a problem using insulin to digest food, so the unused insulin continues
to circulate in their blood until it is excreted from the body.
Type 2 diabetics are usually overweight adults. Being overweight leads to
insulin resistance. Insulin resistance means that the cells in the body require
a greater amount of insulin to push the glucose (sugar) into the cells so it can
be used for energy. This is why they have higher levels of circulating insulin.
The best way to control diabetes? Lose weight, change your diet, exercise,
and take your medicine. Good ways to control cholesterol? Lose weight
(Chapter 7), change your diet (Chapter 4), and — sometimes — take your
medicine (Chapter 12). Are you beginning to see a pattern here?
Previous heart attack
If you’ve already had a heart attack, you know your cholesterol numbers, and
your doctor has probably already prescribed one of the cholesterol-lowering
medications I talk about in Chapter 12. No need to dwell on this one.
Obesity
No, you don’t have to be rail thin. No, you don’t have to spend your life on 
a diet. Your body was created to be at a good weight for your size and shape.
This weight may not be the same for you as for your best friend or that 
model over there in the who-is-she-kidding slinky dress or the painted-on
swim trunks. Just turn to Chapter 7, which explains exactly how excess
pounds raise your cholesterol level and how staying in reasonable shape or
losing as few as 3 to 5 pounds can lower your cholesterol.

Lifestyle
Are you a couch potato? Do you smoke? Shame on you! Don’t wait another
minute — turn to Chapters 8 and 9. Read about the hazards of inactivity and
smoking. You can decide to change these risk factors by the time you finish
reading this sentence. So do it.
Heart Attack Risk Factors at a Glance
High LDLs and low HDLs are only two of the heart attack risk factors on the
list compiled by the National Cholesterol Education Project, a group with
more statistical information than you can shake a stick at. (I have no idea
why anyone would want to shake a stick at these stats — or even what the
saying means. Inquiring minds want to know!) Table 3-7 gives you a quick 
rundown on a whole bunch of risk factors. What a handy guide!

Checking for Plaque Buildup
A cholesterol blood test is definitely valuable because it tells you exactly
where you stand, cholesterol-wise. But the test doesn’t tell you whether you
already have plaque — the technical term for cholesterol deposits — in 
your arteries or whether the plaque deposits are serious enough to set a
heart attack in motion. That’s a job for other tests specifically designed to
determine the condition of your arteries. You can group these tests into two
handy categories: blood tests and physical tests.
Blood tests
Blood tests are simple to do. Just stick out your arm and . . . well, if you’ve
had your cholesterol tested, you know the drill.
Catching C-reactive proteins
C-reactive proteins (CRP) are substances released into your bloodstream
when tissues, including the blood vessels leading to your heart, are damaged
and inflamed. As a result, measuring levels of cardiac CRP in your blood can
serve as a guide to the condition of your arteries and predict your risk of
heart attack or stroke.

Cultural math: When 13 = 4
Westerners often turn shivery when they see the
number 13. The number that spooks some Asians
is 4. In Mandarin, Cantonese, and Japanese, the
word for the number four sounds exactly like the
word for death, a linguistic oddity that may have
serious implications for some Asian-American
heart attack victims.
A recent report in the British Medical Journal
compared death statistics from 1973 to 1998 for
more than 200,000 Asian Americans and 47 mil-
lion White Americans living in the United States.
The data shows that Chinese-American and
Japanese-American heart attack victims who
die of their heart disease are most likely to die on
the fourth day of the month.
The highest number of fourth-day deaths
occurred among hospitalized heart attack vic-
tims (versus people who had a heart attack at
home or somewhere else). One possible conclu-
sion is that the power of suggestion may play an
important role in deciding whether a person sur-
vives a heart attack. Another possible conclusion
is that being able to leave the hospital quickly
after a heart attack increases the chances of
survival.
By the way, there was no similar link between
the 13th day of the month and the incidence of
death among non-Asian heart attack patients,
perhaps because the word thirteen doesn’t
sound like death.

In 1998, a team of researchers from Brigham and Women’s Hospital and
Harvard Medical School rated the risks linked to CRP levels in blood samples
from nearly 40,000 healthy, post-menopausal female nurses participating in
the legendary Nurses’ Health Study. The result? Women with the highest levels
of CRP were five times more likely than women with very low levels to
develop cardiovascular disease and seven times more likely to have a heart
attack or stroke.
One year earlier, the Boston team noted similar results in an ongoing study 
of 22,000 healthy male doctors. These results led them to conclude that using
“high-sensitivity” or “ultrasensitive” tests to measure cardiac CRP is a good
way to “predict the risk of future heart attack and stroke events.” (Check 
out Chapter 8 for info on the connection between exercise and reducing 
CRP levels.)
Measuring MPO
White blood cells are the body’s natural defense against inflammation and
infection. When the white blood cells sense trouble, they release myeloperoxi-
dase (MPO), a protein that can knock the heck out of the bugs causing the
inflammation and infection.
But MPO may also irritate arteries and short-circuit natural body chemicals
that keep “bad” cholesterol particles from glomming on to artery walls, thus
contributing to the buildup of plaque inside your blood vessels. In July 2007,
the Journal of the American College of Cardiology published data from a study
of more than 1,000 healthy Brits showing that, over the years, those with 
the highest blood levels of MPO had the highest risk of coronary artery 
disease (CAD).
In other words, high blood levels of MPO may signal artery trouble ahead,
even when other indicators, such as LDL levels, are fine. Naturally, the
researchers want to see more studies before they stick an MPO test onto
your yearly lab tests, but, as one of the researchers said, “MPO looks like a
‘keeper’ that will one day become part of clinical care.”
Many insurance companies, including Medicare, may not pay for CRP or MPO
blood tests because they argue that if you have elevated levels, you need 
to make all the necessary lifestyle changes (lose weight, treat high blood
pressure, stop smoking, eat a healthy diet, and so on). You should be doing
this anyway! However, sometimes demonstrating to people that their risk of 
a heart attack in the next five years is great can stimulate them to become
more serious about making lifestyle changes.

Physical tests
You don’t stick out your arm for these tests; you warm up the muscles on
treadmills and other such devices.
Stress tests
For a simple stress test, your doctor sticks electrodes on various parts of your
anatomy, mainly your upper torso, and reads the results as you march on a
treadmill or push the pedals on a stationary bike . . . No, no, no — come 
back. Electrodes aren’t needles. They’re round, flat gizmos that are “pasted”
on to you with sticky fluid. The electrodes transmit electrical impulses to a
machine. The machine then translates the impulses into numerical measure-
ments of the flow of blood through your cardiovascular system as you do the
treadmill or bicycle thing.
Sometimes a simple stress test delivers false positives (suggesting you have
heart disease when you don’t) or false negatives (suggesting you’re risk-free
when you’re not). For more accurate results, your doctor relies on a thallium
stress test or sestamibi stress test.
The thallium or sestamibi stress test begins with an injection containing
radioactive thallium or sestamibi. After the shot, your doctor asks you to
wait for about three hours while the radioactive substance circulates through
your blood vessels. Then you get fitted with electrodes, climb on the tread-
mill or bike, and your doctor monitors your blood flow via those electrodes.
Next you lie on a table while a special low-dose X-ray machine tracks the
radioactive substance as it flows through your heart and blood vessels. As
you can imagine, trouble spots — a narrowing here and buildup there — are
clearly visible.
By the way, if you have a medical condition, such as arthritis, that makes it
difficult for you to walk on the treadmill or ride the bike, your doctor can use
a special medication called persantium, rather than exercise, to speed up
your heartbeat and blood flow.
ECBT
No, electron-beam-computed tomography (ECBT), sometimes called ultrafast
CT, isn’t the machine that beams Captain Kirk up to the Enterprise. It’s an
injection-free CAT scan that provides snapshots of your heart, lungs, and
coronary arteries to uncover the presence of calcium deposits, a warning
sign of plaque buildup in your arteries.
54
Part I: Getting Up Close and Personal with Cholesterol 

The ECBT is about seven times faster than a conventional CAT scan. The 
test, which takes about five minutes to run, is a super way to catch plaque
problems very early or (think positively) to show that you’re plaque-free.
Unfortunately, the test costs $300 to $500, and although doctors consider it
basic medicine, some insurance plans haven’t yet adopted this view.
Bummer.
Angiogram
Having an angiogram isn’t an everyday walk in the medical park. This proce-
dure is reserved for people with chest pain or other signs of an imminent
heart attack.
To perform the test, your cardiologist or radiologist (by this time, you’re way
past the primary-care-physician stage) inserts a very small tube called a
catheter into an artery, sends dye through the tube into your bloodstream,
and watches an X-ray monitor to see how freely the dye flows. If the dye sud-
denly slows or stops, blocked by a clot or narrowed area, your doctor may
perform immediate angioplasty, the surgical procedure that removes the
blockage and clears the blood vessel. In most cases, after clearing the vessel,
the surgeon inserts a stent — a tiny spring — into the artery to hold it open,
hopefully forever. The stent is designed to prevent restenosis, the technical
term for blocking an artery after it has been cleared out. If the artery is
blocked again, the treatment is a new angioplasty and a new stent.
In order to be able to do an angioplasty, the blockage must not be too far
down the coronary artery or else the balloon won’t be able to fit in there. If
you have multiple blocked arteries or an angioplasty can’t be performed, a
cardiac surgeon can perform coronary bypass surgery whereby he takes
arteries from one place in your body, such as the internal mammary arteries,
and attaches them to your coronary circulation.
I certainly hope you never need an angiogram. But, if you do, the good news
is that it can save your life and keep you alive for years and years to come,
which gives you plenty of time to work on controlling your cholesterol.
Calculating Your Heart Attack Risk
Now you know all there is to know about the risk factors associated with high
cholesterol and your risk of having high cholesterol. In this section, you can
use all the info you’ve picked up to calculate your personal risk of having a
heart attack in the next ten years.
55
Chapter 3: Rating Your Cholesterol-Related Risk

The NCEP calculator
Luckily, you don’t have to be a calculus whiz to do the math. The National
Cholesterol Education Project has created an interactive “Risk Assessment
Tool for Estimating Your Ten-Year Risk of Having A Heart Attack.” You can
find this tool at the following Web site: http://hp2010.nhlbihin.net/
atpiii/calculator.asp?usertype=pub.
On the online form, type in the appropriate numbers, click the proper boxes,
and hit the appropriate button (the one labeled “Calculate Your Ten-Year
Risk”). What you get back may surprise you. For example, my total cholesterol
is high, but my HDLs are also high. My blood pressure is normal, and I haven’t
smoked in years, so the calculator puts my ten-year risk of heart attack at 5
percent (meaning 5 of every 100 persons with my particular numbers will
experience a heart attack in the next ten years).
Try it. You, too, may be pleasantly surprised at the answer. On the other
hand, if your number is higher than you want, move on to the next section, 
a calculator with a point system.
A second numbers game
The multi-part Risk Predictor Score Sheet created by the National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute, a division of the National Institutes of Health (NHLBI/NIH,
for short), calculates the ten-year risk of heart attack by assigning specific
points for the following six specific risk factors:
 Age
 Total cholesterol
 HDL cholesterol
 Blood pressure
 Diabetes
 Smoking
Because men and women have different bodies and, thus, different levels of
risk, there are two score sheets based on gender:

emember the old maxim, “A few seconds on your
lips, a lifetime on your hips?” Well, here’s a new one:
“A few seconds on your plate, a lifetime in your blood.”
The simple fact is that all plans to rejigger your cholesterol
levels start with reforming your diet. Okay, it may sound
boring, and it may lack a certain zip. But trust me — tweaking
what you eat with an eye toward improving your cholesterol
profile is worth the effort. You can get started by taking a
look at that page right over there to your right.

O
kay. You’ve been to the doctor. She ran a blood test for cholesterol
(check out Chapter 3), and your numbers are high. Her first recommen-
dation is likely to be a cholesterol-lowering diet. What’s that? The answer is
in this very short chapter; so short, in fact, that you may be tempted to skip
past it and go right on to Chapter 5, which explains how to put the strategies
listed here into action to create a meal plan of your own. 
But in the words of the golden-hearted lady of the evening played by Shirley
McLaine in Sweet Charity: “Hey, Big Spender, spend a little time with me.” It
won’t take long. I won’t waste words. As a result, you can head into Chapter 5
armed with a better understanding of why your doctor is pushing a low-fat,
high-fiber diet to control your cholesterol. What’s to lose?
Being Prudent
The first people to say, “Hey, we can prevent heart attacks by changing what
people eat,” were almost certainly the guys at the New York City Department
of Health who created the Diet and Coronary Heart Disease Study Project of
the Bureau of Nutrition, commonly known as the Anti-Coronary Club, on
February 19, 1957. Their goal was to track a group of overweight, middle-
age men who’d either had a heart attack or looked like they were about to
experience one. 

By the way, you may notice that I said men. No women were in the club
because before the days of women’s lib, nobody considered women to be 
at risk for a heart attack. Gee.
Anyway, the nutrition docs enlisted the Anti-Coronary Club members as 
volunteers in a trial of a new controlled-fat, low-cholesterol diet. Half of the
participants got the experimental diet, and half were allowed to eat whatever
their little, bursting hearts desired. 
Within four years, it was clear that the incidence of heart attack among the
men on the controlled-fat, low-cholesterol diet was much lower than inci-
dence among men in the other group. By cutting back on fats, cholesterol,
and calories, the project turned modern heart-disease prevention in a new
direction. Thus the Prudent Diet — the very first cholesterol-lowering 
regimen — was born. 
By the way, not only was the first cholesterol-lowering diet created right here
in my hometown, The Big Apple, the cardiologist-in-charge was my uncle,
Seymour H. Rinzler, MD, one really good reason for my continuing interest in
this subject. And make a note: Although being in The Big Apple raises some
people’s blood pressure, apples, the food, are great little cholesterol busters.
Check it out in Chapter 5.
Doing the Diet Two-Step
By the 1980s, Americans had pretty much accepted the idea of a link between
high cholesterol and an increased risk of heart disease. In addition, they were
now living long enough so that medical problems of older age — think heart
attack — were becoming more common, and therefore more worrisome.
To confront the heart issue, sorry, head on, in 1984, the National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute (NHLBI), a division of the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), convened a Consensus Development Conference to deal with hyper-
cholesterolemia (high cholesterol to you and me). 
Fourteen experts, meeting for two days, issued two important edicts (as in
“do this or you’ll be really sorry”):
 Edict Number One: Henceforth, Americans will be divided into three
risk groups for heart attack based on their total cholesterol levels:
• The lowest quarter of cholesterol levels (below 200 mg/dL) is “low.”
People occupying the low quarter are at low risk of heart attack.
64
Part II: Eating Your Way to Lower Cholesterol 

• The two middle quarters (200–239 mg/dL) are “normal.” Those
folks in the middle quarters are at moderate risk for heart attack.
• The top quarter (240 mg/dL and above) is “high.” Folks sitting in the
high quarter are at high risk for heart attack.
Mg stands for milligrams, and dL is the abbreviation for deciliter (1⁄10 of a
liter).
 Edict Number Two: Sticking to a low-fat, controlled-cholesterol diet is a
person’s best bet for reducing the risk of heart attack, so cut your total
fat intake and cut back on animal foods (the source of dietary choles-
terol). Or else. 
The authoritative food plan was — surprise! — the Prudent Diet, which
NHLBI’s brand-spanking-new National Cholesterol Education Project (NCEP)
had magically transformed into something called The Step I and Step II diets. 
Step I (notice the Roman numerals which somehow make this title look very
important) was meant for healthy people with cholesterol readings in 
the 200–239 mg/dL range. Step II was for people who’d already had a heart
attack or had a cholesterol reading above 240 mg/dL. Here’s what each diet
mandated: 
Step I
 No more than 30 percent of your total daily calories from fat.
 No more than 10 percent of your total daily calories from saturated fat.
Chapter 5 explains saturated fats (versus unsaturated, polyunsaturated,
and monounsaturated fats) in detail.
 No more than 300 milligrams of cholesterol per day, regardless of how
many calories you consume. 
Step II 
 No more than 30 percent of your total daily calories from fat.
 No more than 7 percent of your total daily calories from saturated fat.
 No more than 200 milligrams of cholesterol per day, regardless of how
many calories you consume.
No, you’re not entitled to 30 percent of your calories from fat plus 10 percent
or 7 percent of your calories from saturated fat. The percent allowed for satu-
rated fat is part of the 30 percent allowed for total fat. 
Table 4-1 does the math to show how the Step I/Step II formulas apply to
1,600-calorie, 2,000-calorie, and 3,000-calorie daily diets.

Adding TLC
No, TLC doesn’t stand for Tender Loving Care. The letters are the abbrevia-
tion for Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet, the food facts recom-
mended in May 2001 when NCEP released a whole new set of guidelines for
managing cholesterol. Which, come to think of it, may actually be Tender
Loving Care for your heart.
The document in question is the Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection,
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, commonly known
as ATP III. (For more about ATP III and its recommendations on cholesterol-
lowering meds, check out Chapter 12.)
Step I (see the preceding section) was still okey-dokey, but TLC replaced Step
II as the must-use diet for people with specific medical conditions and risk
factors such as 
 High level of LDLs 
 A previous heart attack or cardiovascular disease, such as blocked
arteries
 Type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent diabetes, diabetes mellitus) or meta-
bolic syndrome, also known as insulin resistance syndrome, a cluster of
risk factors that includes Type 2 diabetes (non-insulin dependent dia-
betes), high blood pressure, excess weight, elevated LDLs (“bad” choles-
terol), and low HDLs (“good” cholesterol) 
Table 4-2 shows the daily rules for the TLC diet. As you read them, notice that
this diet allows slightly more total fat than you got with the Step II diet. Why?
To give people with diabetes the option to replace some calories from carbs
with calories from fat. Are these guys considerate, or what?

Finding Diet Aids
Some people have no trouble adapting to a cholesterol-lowering diet. Others
find it pure torture. The following resources may relieve some of the pain:
 Healthcare professionals and groups: These fine folks can show you
how to adapt your menus to your diet or send you to other fine folks
who can get the job done:
• GPs: Your general practitioner (your family doctor) is your first
stop on the way to lower cholesterol. She can give you menu plans
and tips to ease your way into low-cholesterol eating.
• HMOs and PPOs: Yes, mangled care, I mean managed care, can be
annoying, frustrating, and — let’s not mince words — downright
loathsome. But once in a while the system works. Many managed-
care plans now include some options for alternative medicine,
such as nutrition therapy and consultations with registered dieti-
tians. If your plan is among the innovators, that’s good news for
your pocketbook — and your cholesterol.
 The local YMCA or YWCA: Ask about diet classes. There’s bound to be
a heart-healthy one on the list. Just be sure that anyone who hands out
personal advice for your very own body has the proper credentials, like
the letters RD (for registered dietitian) after his or her name.

The low-fat surprise
Just when you think you’ve heard it all, some-
body springs a surprise. This time I’m the sur-
prise springer, and this is my surprise: Not
everyone benefits from a low-fat diet. Who are
the exceptions?
 Newborns and infants: In the early 1980s,
just as cholesterol-mania was hitting its first
peak, some conscientious parents decided
to cut back on fat and cholesterol right from
the beginning in order to give their baby 
a head start in preventing a heart attack
later in life. It sounds reasonable — a low-
cholesterol diet in infancy equals high heart
protection later on — but in this case, one
and one don’t add up to two.
Unlike an adult whose body is completely
developed, an infant is still making new
tissue and new connections in the wiring of
his brain — an organ packed with choles-
terol. As a result, newborns and infants
require whole-fat foods.
As the low-fat infant diet spread, hospitals
began to see otherwise healthy infants who
didn’t thrive — a medical way of saying that
they didn’t develop properly. When doctors
identified the cause of the problem — these
low-fat baby diets — and parents added fats
back into their baby’s diet, some damage
was reversed. 
Today, the American College of Pediatrics
recommends that a full 50 percent of an
infant’s calories should come from fat. The
organization also says that children
absolutely shouldn’t be on a low-fat diet until
they are at least past their second birthday
and then only on the advice of a physician.
Babies are not little adults; they’re compli-
cated organisms complete with (invisible)
handle-with-care tags!
 People with diabetes: Some experts have
suggested that a diet high in carbohydrates
and low in fat is less beneficial for people
with diabetes than a diet high in fat and rel-
atively low in carbohydrates. This claim
hasn’t been nailed down yet to anyone’s
complete satisfaction. If you have diabetes,
you know better than to change your diet
without talking to your doctor first.

Chapter 4: Writing Rules for a Cholesterol-Lowering Diet
Rating your risk
One way to estimate your risk of heart attack is
to calculate the ratio of your total cholesterol to
your HDLs. To do this, you divide the number for
your total cholesterol by the number for your
HDLs. For example, if your total cholesterol 
is 240 mg/dL and your HDLs are 59 mg/dL, divide
240 by 59 to get a ratio of 4.06. Oh, call it 4.1
240 ÷ 59 = 4.06 = 4.1
This ratio is used because standard lab tests
only measure your total cholesterol and your
HDL levels. LDL and VLDL levels are estimated.
Triglycerides are used to estimate the VLDL, and
LDL levels are discerned by subtracting the HDL
readings and VLDL estimates from your total
cholesterol numbers. But what does this tell you
about your risk?
The following table lists the risk associated with
specific total-cholesterol-to-HDL ratios. I found
these descriptions on a laboratory report for
one of my own annual checkups. Consider
these numbers to be guesstimates for your risk
of heart attack. Only use them as a rough guide
until you and your doctor draw some blood and
crunch some numbers. Health risk assessments
are always a work in progress, so the numbers
on your annual report may be different.

P
op quiz: Who said, “A journey of a thousand miles must begin with 
a single step”? No, it wasn’t John F. Kennedy, although he used it in a
speech. No, it wasn’t Condoleeza Rice. No, no, no, it wasn’t Jon Stewart. The
actual author of the quote was the ancient Chinese philosopher Laotzu.
Clearly, ol’ Laotzu, who lived 26 centuries before cholesterol was identified,
wasn’t an expert on dietary fats and fiber, but he sure had a handle on human
nature. And his admonition to just get going — take that first step — is great
advice for anyone who wants to lower his or her cholesterol.
As you read this chapter, remember that the very first step in this particular
journey is to set a diet strategy. Cut back on fats. Increase your consumption
of foods high in dietary fiber. And put this all together so you can look forward
to smiling as your doctor says, “Wow! Your cholesterol is down.” Frankly, I
think Laotzu would approve. Don’t you?
Making Your Game Plan
I say, “Diet.” You think, “Calories.” No surprise there — for most people, diet
is synonymous with weight-loss plan. But if I add cholesterol control to diet, the
picture changes.

In Chapter 4, I discuss all the people who helped create the authoritative cho-
lesterol-control diet, a regimen that delivers one simple message: Eat less 
fat and more dietary fiber. Not that calories don’t count: As you can see in
Chapter 7, losing weight is an excellent way to improve your cholesterol num-
bers. But the pleasant surprise is that if you manage your fat and fiber, the
calories take care of themselves, and your diet takes care of your cholesterol.
What a great deal.
Choosing the Fat That Fits
All fats, including the fat on your bod and (more to the point) the fats in your
food, are composed of fatty acids — long chain-like molecules of carbon and
hydrogen atoms plus an oxygen atom or two. Folks in the know about fats put
fatty acids into one of three categories:
 Saturated
 Monounsaturated
 Polyunsaturated
The chemical differences between these fats are described in the “Demystifying
saturation” sidebar later in this chapter. For the moment, the important thing
to keep in mind is that a diet high in saturated fats raises cholesterol levels,
and a diet high in unsaturated fats lowers them.
Dealing up close and personal 
with cholesterol
Eating a lot of foods high in dietary cholesterol increases the amount of cho-
lesterol in your blood and raises your risk of heart attack. So, controlling the
cholesterol in your diet reduces the risk of two potential problems in your
arteries.
Cholesterol is a saturated fat found only in foods from animals: meat, dairy
products, and eggs.
 Dietary-cholesterol problem #1: As I explain in Chapter 2, cholesterol
and perhaps homocysteine (an amino acid produced when you digest
food — the jury is still out on this amino acid) can rough up the linings
of your arteries, creating teensy little crags that snag cholesterol parti-
cles as they float by. The trapped cholesterol particles snag other debris
floating through your blood, producing small piles of gunk (technical
term: plaque) that narrow and may eventually block the artery, leading
to the unpleasant event called a heart attack.
72
Part II: Eating Your Way to Lower Cholesterol 

 Dietary-cholesterol problem #2: Extra cholesterol in your diet may also
increase the amount of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) in your blood.
LDLs, also known as “bad” cholesterol, are the fat and protein particles
that ferry cholesterol into your arteries, leading to problem #1.
Conclusion? Adding foods high in cholesterol can mess up any diet, which
certainly explains why every description of a cholesterol-lowering diet calls
the diet low cholesterol and controlled fat. You keep the cholesterol low and
you control the kinds of fat by following the 30-10-300 formula described in
Chapter 4:
 Less than 30 percent of your total calories each day from fat — predomi-
nantly unsaturated fats
 Less than 10 percent of your total calories each day from saturated fat
 Less than 300 milligrams of cholesterol per day, regardless of your 
calorie count
Showing fat who’s boss
After you decide to control your cholesterol by controlling the amount of fat
in your diet, the question is, which foods work best and which foods aren’t
that hot?
73
Chapter 5: Building a Cholesterol-Lowering Diet
Fat entries in the name game
The chemical family name for fats and related
compounds, such as cholesterol, is lipids, which
comes from lipos, the Greek word for fat. Now
that you know that little factoid, you’re likely to
see the lipo- (or lipe-) prefix popping up every-
where you look.
For example, the correct scientific term for your
cholesterol numbers is lipid profile. And your
lipid profile includes lipoproteins, the fat-and-
protein particles that carry cholesterol around
and sometimes out of your body. Here are a few
more lipo-licious words:
 Lipases: Enzymes that enable you to digest
fats
 Lipemia: Excess amounts of fat in your
blood
 Lipoblasts: Embryonic fat cells
 Lipomas: Fatty tumors
 Liposuction: Surgical removal of body fat
Just about the only “lip” that doesn’t come from
lipos is your lip, the one that covers your teeth.
That lip is descended from labium, the Latin
word for, you guessed it, lip. As Sigmund Freud,
he of the mysterious unconscious, once said,
“Sometimes a good cigar is just a smoke.”

Oh, what an easy one to answer! (Either skip ahead to the section titled
“Building a nutritional pyramid” or take a slightly longer way through the 
following text.)
 Grains: Grains have very small amounts of fat — just about 3 percent of
their total weight — and most of the fats in grains are unsaturated. In
addition, grains are filling, and they have dietary fiber, which I talk about
a bit later in this chapter. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans from the
U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (USDA/HHS) says that a healthy diet is based on grain
foods. Who am I to argue?
 Fruits and veggies: Fruits and vegetables have only traces of fat, and
most of it is unsaturated. Your diet should have a lot of fruits and veg-
gies. But you knew that, right?
 Dairy products: Dairy products are a varied lot. For example, sweet cream
is a high-fat food. Whole milks and whole-milk cheeses are moderately
high in fat. Skim milk and skim-milk products are low-fat foods. And for
the record, most of the fats in any dairy product are saturated, but milk
products are your best source of calcium, so balance the fats and get
your calcium by sticking to low- or no-fat dairy products — and don’t
forget the yummy low- or no-fat frozen desserts.
74
Part II: Eating Your Way to Lower Cholesterol 
Unconfusing a confusing cholesterol calculation
In 2000, nutrition scientists at the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research
Center on Aging at Tufts University (Boston) fed
volunteers one of two diets. Both diets derived
30 percent of their total calories from fat, but
one diet used polyunsaturated fat from corn oil,
and the other got its saturated fat from beef.
And don’t let me forget to mention that both
diets included extra cholesterol.
Ordinarily, a diet high in unsaturated fats reduces
the amount of cholesterol circulating in your
blood, and a diet high in saturated fat does the
opposite, increasing the amount of cholesterol
circulating in your blood. In addition, a diet high
in unsaturated fatty acids is generally assumed
to inhibit a chemical reaction called oxidation
that makes LDLs more likely to slip into your
arteries and start the downhill slide toward a
heart attack. But guess what?
 Adding cholesterol to the diets high in
polyunsaturated fatty acids (corn oil)
increased LDL oxidation by 28 percent.
 Adding cholesterol to the high-saturated
beef-fat diet increased oxidation of LDLs by
15 percent.
 Both diets increased the volunteers’ choles-
terol levels.
Time out! How come the people on the polyun-
saturated fat had a greater increase in LDL 
oxidation than the people on the saturated beef-
fat diet? Because — any math majors in the
room? — the amount of oxidation associated
with the unsaturated fat diet is much lower to
begin with, and any actual increase in oxidation
creates a larger percentage increase relative to
diets high in saturated fats.

 Meat and poultry: Meat is moderately high in fat, and most of its fats are
saturated. Some poultry — chicken and turkey — are relatively low in fat.
Other poultry — duck and goose — have higher fat contents. You can
lower the fat content of any poultry serving by removing the skin. I know;
I know. That’s the good part! But your cholesterol levels will thank you.
 Fish and shellfish: Fish and shellfish are special cases. Some fish, such
as salmon and herring, are high in fat, but guess what? Those are the
best fish from a cholesterol standpoint because their fats are rich in
omega-3 fatty acids (more about them in the sidebar titled, “Omega-3
me”), polyunsaturated fatty acids credited with lowering your risk of
heart disease.
Your body converts alpha-linolenic acid, the most important omega-3, to
hormone-like substances called eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosa-
hexaenoic acid (DHA). EPA and DHA appear to protect your heart by
reducing inflammation, preventing blood clots, and — get this! — 
preventing other fats like cholesterol from injuring artery walls.
Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, found in beef, pork, and several
veggie oils (corn, cottonseed, safflower, and sunflower), are chemical
cousins of omega-3s, but they don’t protect your heart.
 Fats and oils: Vegetable oils, butter, and lard are high-fat foods, but their
actual fat content varies from heart healthy to are-you-kidding-me! This
info is the subject of the “Linking fatty acids and dietary fat” section
later in this chapter.
 Proteins: Protein is an essential nutrient — so important that its name
comes from the Greek word proteios, which means “holding first place.”
A protein molecule is a chain of other molecules called amino acids, the
building blocks of protein. Amino acids are molecules made of carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, plus a nitrogen unit called an amino group.
The amino group is essential for synthesizing (creating) specialized pro-
teins, including the enzymes and hormones that make it possible for you
to perform such basic functions as working your muscles and digesting
food. So, when people talk about how much protein they need, what
they really mean is how much nitrogen they need to synthesize special-
ized proteins.
Your body also uses proteins to build new cells and maintain tissues.
Considering all that, you may be puzzled as to why it has taken me so
long to get around to talking about protein. The reason is simple. Some
protein foods are positively loaded with cholesterol and saturated fatty
acids:
• Animal protein: The only foods that add cholesterol to your diet
are foods from animals — meat, poultry, fish, milk products, and
eggs. Most of these foods are also high in saturated fatty acids.
True, some animal foods have less cholesterol than others. True,
some animal foods are lower in saturated fats. True, you can cut
75
Chapter 5: Building a Cholesterol-Lowering Diet

the fat and cholesterol content of animal foods by trimming visible
fat. True, some animal foods are rich in special unsaturated fats
called omega-3s that actually reduce everybody’s risk of heart 
disease. But generally, a diet designed to lower your cholesterol
emphasizes foods from plants.
• Plant protein: Getting your protein from plant foods is a more
complicated task than getting your protein from animal foods.
Blame it on the amino acids (those “building blocks” of protein).
Proteins from animals are labeled complete, meaning that they con-
tain all the amino acids human beings need to thrive. Proteins from
plant foods are often characterized as limited, meaning that they
lack sufficient amounts of one amino acid or another. It takes a
little work to mix and match plants to get the proper protein bal-
ance, but with no cholesterol and practically no saturated fatty
acids, plant proteins are worth the effort, don’t ya think? At least
once in a while.
Linking fatty acids and dietary fat
All fats are combinations of fatty acids. Nutritionists characterize a dietary
fat or oil as saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated depending on
which fatty acids make up the largest portion of the fat or oil:
 Foods such as butter, which are high in saturated fatty acids, are solid at
room temperature and get harder when chilled.
76
Part II: Eating Your Way to Lower Cholesterol 
Omega-3 me
It’s clear that laboratory pigs and monkeys have
cleaner arteries when their feed includes
omega-3 fatty acids, and studies suggest
human beings may also benefit. In the Diet and
Reinfarction Trial (DART), a 2,033-man study run
by the Medical Research Council Epidemio-
logical Unit in Cardiff, Wales, in the late 1980s,
men who ate two servings of fatty fish a week
had a lower rate of heart attack than men who
either cut their fat to no more than 30 percent of
their total calories or increased their dietary
fiber (from grains) to 16 grams a day. Yo, bring
on the salmon!
But don’t forget the chocolate or at least the
very special new chocolate form Canada. In 
the summer of 2007, Ocean Nutrition Canada
Limited, a company that makes and distributes
omega-3 food and dietary supplement ingredi-
ents, announced that the O Trois line of choco-
late bars and “fingers” from Les Truffes au
Chocolat, would henceforth contain omega-3
fatty acids. Who can ask for anything more?

 Foods such as olive oil, which are high in monounsaturated fatty acids,
are liquid at room temperature; they get thicker when chilled.
 Foods such as corn oil, which are high in polyunsaturated fatty acids,
are liquid at room temperature and stay liquid when chilled.
So how come margarine, which is composed primarily of unsaturated fatty
acids, is solid? Because its fatty acids have been artificially saturated with
extra hydrogen atoms. This process, called hydrogenation, turns an oil, such
as corn oil, into a solid fat — margarine.
Hydrogenated fats are sometimes called trans fatty acids, but no matter what
you call them, these fatty acids raise — rather than lower — cholesterol
levels. As a result, these days most margarines boast “no trans fats” right on
the label. I know your mother told you not to toot your own horn, but these
guys have earned the right. So when you’re shopping, pick them. 
Table 5-1 shows the fatty acid composition of several common fats and oils.
You’re right: Some of the totals below don’t add up to 100 percent. That’s
because these fats and oils also contain very small amounts of other kinds of
fatty acids that don’t affect the basic character of the fat. The last column,
Fat Category, tells you which fatty acids are predominant in the mix.

Factoring in the Fiber
Carbohydrate foods form the base for a healthful, low cholesterol diet. In
2000, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services recommended that approximately 55 to 60 percent of
your daily calories should come from foods such as grains (particularly
whole grains) and fruits and vegetables that are high in complex carbohy-
drates (a term that I discuss in just a minute).
Table 5-2 does the math to show you what 55 to 60 percent of calories from
carbs equals for a 1,600-calorie, 2000-calorie, 2,600-calorie, and 3,100-calorie
daily diet, the range of calories for active healthy adults.

Chapter 5: Building a Cholesterol-Lowering Diet
Demystifying saturation
Molecules are groups of atoms hooked together
with chemical bonds (electrical charges that
attract and hold atoms firmly in place). Different
atoms form different numbers of bonds. For
example, a carbon atom can form four bonds, 
an oxygen atom can form two bonds, and a
hydrogen atom — poor thing! — can only form
one bond.
Fatty acid molecules are long chains of carbon
atoms (always an even number) with hydrogen
and oxygen atoms attached to the carbons. The
chain begins with a carbon atom attached to
three hydrogen atoms. Imagine it looking like a
cheese ball (the carbon atom) with one tooth-
pick (a chemical bond) stuck into the top, one
on the left, one on the bottom, and one on the
right. And, oh, yes, an olive (a hydrogen atom)
stuck onto the toothpick on top, on the left, and
on the bottom. No, it doesn’t matter whether it’s
a black olive or a stuffed green one.
A layperson sees this:
A chemist sees this:
Chemists call this one-carbon, three-hydrogen
unit a methyl group — the first piece in any fatty
acid. To build the rest of the fatty acid, you add
carbon atoms to the right side of the first carbon
atom (on the toothpick without an olive). Then
you add hydrogen atoms to the top and bottom
of the carbon atoms. In the end, you have a
chain that looks something like this:
See? Every carbon atom has four bonds; every
hydrogen atom has just one. In real life, the
chain of atoms is three-dimensional and bounc-
ing around in space. I can’t draw that here, so
you’ll have to take my word for it.
Meanwhile, back at the fatty acids, the last
carbon in the chain is part of an acid group, a
special unit made of one carbon atom, two
oxygen atoms, and one hydrogen atom that
makes a fatty acid a fatty acid. The carbon atom
in the acid group still has four bonds, but two of
the bonds go to one oxygen atom. The two-bond
connection is called a double bond. This time I’ll
forgo the cheese, toothpicks, and olives, and just
draw the thing as you can find it in a chemistry
textbook:

Carbohydrates are nutrient molecules built of units of sugar. As the sidebar,
“Sweet talk: Simple versus complex,” explains, the more sugar units a carbo-
hydrate molecule contains, the more complex the carbohydrate is.
When it comes to controlling your cholesterol, the most important 
complex carbohydrate (and the most important carbohydrate, period) is
dietary fiber.
80
Part II: Eating Your Way to Lower Cholesterol 
Thank heavens that’s done. Now, how do you
tell the saturated fatty acid from the unsaturated
one? Count the bonds between the carbons.
Saturated fatty acid
In a saturated fatty acid, all the carbons have
four single bonds except for the last carbon in
the chain, which has a double bond to the
oxygen atom in the acid group.
Monounsaturated fatty acid
The following is a diagram of oleic acid, a
monounsaturated fatty acid in olive oil. Notice
that this fatty acid has one place where the
carbon doesn’t have four single bonds, the def-
inition of a saturated carbon. It has two single 
bonds (one to the carbon on the left and one to
a hydrogen) and a double bond to the next
carbon atom in line. Because this fatty acid has
only one instance of a double bond between
carbons, it’s called a monounsaturated fatty
acid (mono = one).
A polyunsaturated fatty acid
A polyunsaturated (poly = many) fatty acid has
two or more carbons with two single bonds and  
one double bond to the next carbon in line. This
diagram is a polyunsaturated fatty acid.

Refraining from eating your 
shirt: Dietary fiber
The word dietary is stuck in front of fiber to make sure you understand that
this fiber, which comes from food, is different from the natural and synthetic
fibers, such as silk, cotton, wool, or nylon, used in fabrics.
Dietary fiber is a complex carbohydrate, but it isn’t just any old complex carb
like, oh, starch. Your body can digest starch, but it can’t digest dietary fiber
because the human gut doesn’t have digestive enzymes strong enough to
dissolve the chemical bonds holding the fiber molecule’s sugar units together.
As a result, you don’t get any calories or other nutrients from dietary fiber. But
that doesn’t mean it’s worthless. Au contraire — on the contrary, as they like to
say in France — dietary fiber is very useful in helping to control cholesterol.
Foods contain two kinds of dietary fiber — insoluble dietary fiber and soluble
dietary fiber. Both are important to a healthful diet, but only one helps con-
trol cholesterol.
Insoluble dietary fiber
Insoluble dietary fiber such as the cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in
whole grains, fruit and veggie skins, and the teensy, little hard thingees in
pears bulks up stool and makes it softer, reducing your risk of developing
hemorrhoids and lessening the discomfort if you already have them.
81
Chapter 5: Building a Cholesterol-Lowering Diet
Sweet talk: Simple versus complex
Just as proteins are combinations of amino
acids, and fats are combinations of fatty acids,
carbohydrates are combinations of sugar units
described either as simple or complex, depend-
ing on the number of sugar units in the molecule:
 Monosaccharides (mono = one; saccharide
= sugar) are carbohydrates with only one
sugar unit. Fructose (the sugar in fruit), glu-
cose (the sugar you use for energy), and
galactose (the sugar derived from digesting
lactose, also known as milk sugar) are
monosaccharides. Monosaccharides are
simple carbohydrates.
 Disaccharides (di = two) are carbohydrates
with two sugar units, Sucrose (table sugar)
is a disaccharide made of one unit of fruc-
tose and one unit of glucose. Like mono-
saccharides, disaccharides are simple
carbohydrates.
 Polysaccharides are carbohydrates with
more than two sugar units. Starch, a complex
carbohydrate in potatoes, pasta, and rice, is
definitely a polysaccharide — it’s made up of
many, many sugar units (actually, many units
of glucose). Dietary fiber is also made of
many, many sugar units. Polysaccharides are
complex carbohydrates.

In the memorable words of the New England Journal of Medicine, insoluble
dietary fiber acts like a “colonic broom,” stimulating intestinal contractions
that move solid waste through your digestive tract. By moving food quickly
through your intestines, insoluble dietary fiber may help prevent or relieve
digestive disorders such as constipation or diverticulosis (infection caused by
food getting stuck in small pouches in the wall of your colon).
Insoluble dietary fiber has no effect on your cholesterol. To bring cholesterol
into the picture, you have to turn to the second kind of dietary fiber, the solu-
ble variety.
Soluble dietary fiber
Pectins and gums are soluble dietary fiber. Both dissolve in your stomach
forming gels that look like the stuff made from packages of fruit gelatin. This
gel is believed to sop up cholesterol and slide it out of your body, thus reduc-
ing the amount of cholesterol particles that are left to wander around your
blood vessels and make trouble.
You find pectins in the fruit-part of fruits (apples are a particularly good
source). Gums are most plentiful in legumes (beans and peas) and grains
such as oatmeal and barley.
Fiber in animal foods
Gotcha! There’s no dietary fiber in any food from animals. No fiber in meat.
No fiber in fish. No fiber in chicken. No fiber in milk. No fiber in eggs. See why
plant foods are so important in a cholesterol-lowering diet?
82
Part II: Eating Your Way to Lower Cholesterol 
Sweeping away a fiber myth
For more than 30 years, nutrition studies and
experts said that consuming insoluble dietary
fiber might also protect against colon cancer.
But then in 1999 — wham! — new data from 
the Nurses’ Health Study at Harvard University,
Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Dana
Farber Cancer Institute in Boston said,
“Ooops!” According to the Nurses’ numbers, no
relationship — zip, zero, zilch — exists between
a high-fiber diet and the risk of colon cancer.
In fact, among the 88,757 women in the 16-year
study, the incidence of colon cancer was the
same whether the women ate a lot of fiber or
practically none. In fact, some women who 
ate a lot of fruit and veggies were actually at
higher risk.
These conclusions were confirmed in 2005
when a team of 29 researchers from 21 institu-
tions in 7 different countries toted up the results
of 13 separate studies. The project — called the
Pooling Project of Prospective Studies of Diet
and Cancer — produced exactly the same
results: Eating a lot of high-fiber foods didn’t
reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.
On the other hand, you know these science
folks. Yesterday’s “yes” sometimes becomes
today’s “no” — or vice versa. As for tomorrow,
who knows?

Getting it just right
Remember Goldilocks, the gal who found three bowls of porridge, one too hot,
one too cold, and one just right? Well, dietary fiber is something like that.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture says that the average American woman
gets about 12 grams of fiber a day from food; the average American man gets
about 17 grams. These amounts are well below the current recommendations
of 25 grams a day for a woman and 38 grams a day for a man.
But if you decide to stuff yourself with dietary fiber to make up for years and
years of low-fiber noshing, the result may be gastric distress — an unmistak-
able body protest in the form of intestinal gas or diarrhea. In extreme cases,
loading up on dietary fiber but failing to drink sufficient amounts of liquid to
swish the fiber through your gut can lead to an intestinal obstruction. Yipes!
So remember the Golden, I mean, the Goldilocks Rule: Not too little. Not too
much. Just right. And build up your fiber intake gradually, please. Your
tummy, as well as your cholesterol, will thank you.
A gentle reminder
At the start of this chapter, I said that if you take care of the fat and fiber, the
calories will take care of themselves. Remember? If not, that’s okay — I just
said it again.
Fat is high in calories; carbohydrate foods are relatively low in fat and thus
relatively low in calories. Dietary fiber has no calories at all. If you limit your
fats and increase your dietary fiber and complex carbs, you automatically cut
calories and lose weight. Check out Table 5-3 for the breakdown.

You Know the Deal: Everything 
in Moderation
Nutrition gurus like to say that there’s no such thing as a bad food, only a
less effective food plan. However — and it’s a big however — some foods 
are more effective than others when it comes to lowering your cholesterol.
To point you in the right direction, Chapter 6 lays out a list of specific foods
that help reduce cholesterol levels and the risk of heart attack. It also lists
foods that can increase your cholesterol and your risk.
Okay, you’ve started your game plan and read about the necessary elements
of said plan. Now put this cholesterol-lowering puppy together.
Building a nutritional pyramid
You’re probably familiar with the old USDA/HHS Food Guide Pyramid, shown
in Figure 5-1. This pyramid was used for a long time, but now there’s a new
kid on the block.
The food pyramid in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 is a more elas-
tic structure than previous versions. Instead of building block on block, this
pyramid, shown in Figure 5-2, is made of triangular sections you can expand
or shrink depending on your nutritional needs. And instead of being called
the USDA Food Guide Pyramid, which is kind of cold, it’s now known as My
Pyramid. As in, warm and fuzzy, get it?
This pyramid is available online at www.mypyramid.gov/pyramid/index.
html. The site provides multitudinous facts about how to stretch the 
pyramid one way or the other to accommodate your particular preferences.

Fiber factoid
Raw food almost always has more fiber per
ounce (or gram) than cooked food because
cooking generally adds water, which adds
weight and spreads out the fiber content. For
example, a 3.5-ounce portion of dried prunes
has more prunes (and thus more dietary fiber)
than a 3.5-ounce portion of stewed prunes,
which serves up water as well as prunes.

In this new pyramid, the sections stand for, from left to right:
 Grains
 Vegetables
 Fruit
 Oils
 Milk
 Meat and beans

Chapter 5: Building a Cholesterol-Lowering Diet

Filling out the pyramid with daily servings
The trick to using the pyramid is to count food portions, otherwise known as
servings. Table 5-4 and Table 5-5 show you two ways to assemble your very
own diet pyramid based on the number of servings suggested by either one
of two authoritative food plans, each designed to provide the nutrients
required for a daily diet that delivers 1,600 calories, 2,000 calories, 2,600 
calories, or 3,100 calories. Each plan is outlined as follows:
 Plan #1 is the basic USDA Food Guide, a standard healthful eating plan
for healthy adult men and women.
 Plan #2 is the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, a
similarly healthful eating plan designed to lower blood pressure based
on principles drawn from research at the National Institutes of Health.
Note for purists: The order in which the food groups are listed differs slightly
on these two food plans in Tables 5-4 and 5-5.
For example, grains are Numero Uno on the DASH plan but third on the USDA
design. To make it easier for you to compare the plans, I have juggled things a
bit to put the food groups in the same order on both Tables 5-4 and 5-5. Whew!

Hey, Ma. What’s a serving?
Figuring out the number of servings you need is the easy part. The hard part
is figuring out what constitutes a serving. Not to worry: We do it for you. All
you have to do is run your finger down Table 5-6.

Notice something about these portions? Yes, indeedy, although some of the
servings seem to fit the norm — a cup of milk, a slice of bread, a medium
piece of fruit — other pyramid servings — especially servings of high-fat,
high-cholesterol animal foods such as meat — are much smaller than the 
portions usually found on American plates.
(For more tips on visualizing exactly what individual servings look like, check
out the “Dishing up servings” sidebar in this chapter.)
In France, where everyone eats all the high-fat foods that terrify Americans,
people used to stay slim with a risk of heart disease much lower than in the
U.S. But in recent years, as the portions have expanded, the risks have grown.
Do your friends in France a favor: After you memorize this part of this chap-
ter, lend them your book. After they’ve got the portion sizes down pat, it’s
back to Vive la France! Vive la pâté de foie gras, Camembert cheese, tart 
tatin . . . all in USDA-acceptable serving sizes, of course.
Checking out the nutrient chart
For those of you who enjoy the challenge of totaling up grams and milligrams,
heeeeeeeeeere’s the ticket: Flip to the appendix where the USDA Nutrient
Database is described. The Web site given lists more than 6,000 — yes, 6,000 —
different foods and servings sizes. Browse to your heart’s content at www.nal.
usda.gov/fnic/cgi-bin/nut_search.pl.
Ending with a word for the 
nutrition-curious reader
This chapter explains why fats and dietary fiber figure so prominently in a
cholesterol-lowering diet. But I would be remiss if I didn’t tell you that there’s
more — much more — to discover about proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.
To find out what you’re missing here, check out Nutrition For Dummies, 4th
Edition (Wiley). In the interest of full disclosure, I have to tell you that I wrote
it. More important, the book has an entire chapter devoted to each important
nutrient. I wanted to include those chapters here, but my editors said that
would make this book more than 500 pages long. I tried to convince them
that lifting a 100-pound book three or four times a day counts as exercise,
which — as you can plainly see in Chapter 8 — helps lower cholesterol. 
But I couldn’t get them to budge on this one. So get a copy of Nutrition 
For Dummies, 4th Edition, too.

Dishing up servings
To use the serving system from the Food Guide
Pyramid, it may help to get some hands-on (and
eyes-on) experience with the individual por-
tions. That way, you can store real-life versions
of the recommended servings in your memory
banks. So grab an 8-ounce measuring cup and
a kitchen scale and head for the kitchen to play
with your food and follow these steps:
 Broil a small steak, roast a chicken breast,
or grill up a burger. When the grub is done,
use your kitchen scale to weigh out a 3-
ounce portion. It should be about the size of
a deck of cards (okay, a small calculator).
That’s a meat serving.
 Boil some rice. Fill your measuring cup to
the halfway mark with the cooked rice. Take
the rice out of the cup and mush it into a
ball. That’s a grains or cereal serving.
 Tear up some greens. Fill the measuring cup
to the 8-ounce mark. Dump the greens onto
a salad plate. That’s one serving.
 Open one can of veggies or fruit. Fill the
measuring cup to the half mark with one or
the other. Spoon the food into a small bowl.
That’s one serving.
 Pop open a can of soda. Pour it into the
measuring cup right up to the 8-ounce mark.
Pour that into a glass. Add some ice. It’s
probably more soda than you get in an
upscale restaurant but less than the burger
barn serves. No matter: It’s still one certified
USDA serving.

Pinning Down the “How-To’s” for
a Cholesterol-Lowering Diet
In This Chapter
 Evaluating foods to avoid
 Exploring healthy plant-produced foods
 Trimming the fat during food preparation
C
hapters 4 and 5 give you plenty of information on good food and bad
food for your cholesterol. This chapter tells you ex-act-ly how to put
that information to use in Real Life. 
The info here is definitely hands-on, the tips you need to start changing your
diet (though be sure to consult with your doctor before making any big diet
changes). Naturally, the chapter is designed to be easy to follow, enabling you
to turn these bits and pieces of nutrition advice into a healthful habit. 
The experts call this a Good Food Plan. Go for it!
Avoiding Certain Foods (Or At Least
Eating Them in Very Small Portions)
Yes, the foods listed in this section are high in fat, saturated fat, or choles-
terol (or all three), but that doesn’t mean they’re gone from your table 
forever. The solution is portion control. 
No, you can’t have butter morning, noon, and night. 
Yes, a smidgen on your baked potato now and then is okey-dokey. So is an
occasional schmear of chopped liver on a canapé cracker. 

And a 1-inch cube of cheddar with a fresh, crisp apple once in a while isn’t 
all bad. 
In other words, enjoy. But in moderation, please.
Butter
Butter is pure butterfat, the natural fat in milk. Just about the only redeeming
virtue of butter (other than the heavenly flavor) is the fact that it’s a concen-
trated form of energy. If you lived like your cave-person ancestors, toiling all
day at manual labor, or if you lived in a very, very cold climate, you could
make good use of that energy. But you don’t. So you won’t. And that’s it for
the good news.
The bad news is exactly what you expect. Butterfat is very high in saturated
fat. One measly tablespoon of butter has a whopping 11 grams (g) of fat, 7.1 g
of which are saturated fats. Butter only contains 3.7 g of “good” fats — 3.3 g
are monounsaturated fatty acids and a miniscule 0.4 g are polyunsaturated
fatty acids.
Do the math (divide 7.1 by 11), and you can see that butter is 64.5 — oh heck,
call it 65 — percent saturated fat, a real heart buster. And did I mention that
one tablespoon has 31 milligrams (mg) of cholesterol, 10 percent of your
total daily allowance according to the diet rules I describe in Chapter 4 and
Chapter 5? Now I did. 
So your vote goes to margarine, right? Well, yes. As long as it’s the right mar-
garine. As you can plainly see in the section “Margarine with Trans Fatty
Acids” a bit later on in this chapter. 
Coconut
Nuts have been winning praise lately for their unsaturated fats, not to 
mention their dietary fiber. (I tell you about really good nuts later in this
chapter.) But not the coconut. This big, bulky nut is a special — some may
say “notorious” — case.
Yes, trying to knock open a fresh coconut uses up calories. Yes, coconut meat
is high in dietary fiber, and like other nuts, it’s a good source of B vitamins.
Yes, a single 2-inch-square piece of fresh coconut meat has 1.09 mg of iron
(7.3 percent of the recommended daily allowance for a woman of child-
bearing age), and 0.49 mg of zinc (3.3 percent of the recommended daily
allowance for a man, 4 percent of the recommended daily allowance for a
woman). And of course, the coconut, being a plant, has no cholesterol.
92
Part II: Eating Your Way to Lower Cholesterol 

Can you sense a “but” coming here? Right you are. But that same 2-inch-square
piece of coconut contains 15 g of coconut oil, the fat that accounts for 85 per-
cent of the calories in coconut meat. 
Coconut oil is 89 percent saturated fatty acids, which makes it an even more
highly saturated fat than butter (see the “Butter” section earlier in this chap-
ter). Oops.
Eggs
Confused about eggs? No wonder.
For years, nutritionists insisted that eating eggs raised the risk of heart dis-
ease. Then new data from the long-running Nurses’ Health Study (women) and
the equally long-running Physicians’ Health Study (men) turned up, showing
no significant difference in risk between those who consume an average of
one egg daily versus those who eat less than one egg a week. 
And new laboratory analyses say that a yolk from one large egg contains only
213 to 220 mg of cholesterol, about 50 to 60 mg less than originally believed.
What’s a body to do? Sit tight.
The American Heart Association has upped its allowances on egg consump-
tion to one-a-day, just like that famous brand of vitamins, so long as you
figure the egg’s 200+ mg of cholesterol into your daily total. In other words, if
you’re pigging out on red meat, don’t toss a whole egg on top. 
The key word there is whole. All the fat, including cholesterol and artery-
clogging saturated fats, is in the yolk. The high protein white has none, but 
it does give you some minerals and some B vitamins, notably riboflavin 
(vitamin B2), a “visible vitamin” that may lend a faint green or yellow cast 
to the white.
So here’s the eggs-act solution: Eat the white part of the egg and toss the
yellow. Or, if you make an omelet, make do with one whole egg plus two 
extra whites.
By the way, no-fat, no-cholesterol egg substitutes are made of vitamin- and
mineral-fortified, pasteurized egg whites containing artificial or natural colors
and flavors, plus texturizers, such as gums, to make the liquid look, taste, and
cook a lot like whole eggs.
93
Chapter 6: Pinning Down the “How-To’s” for a Cholesterol-Lowering Diet

Frankfurters
Modern hot dogs and other meat sausages are made from muscle meat similar
to the fresh ground beef or pork sold at the supermarket. Like all meat prod-
ucts, they provide complete proteins with adequate amounts of all the essen-
tial amino acids, plus B vitamins and heme iron, the organic form of iron found
in foods from animals. That’s good. Unfortunately, regular franks, like other
sausages, are traditionally loaded with saturated fats and cholesterol.
But notice the word regular. The frank, remember, is an American success
story, so the same know-how that gave the world no-fat ice cream and trans
fat-free margarine has come up with skinny meat and poultry franks, not to
mention fairly good soybean-based veggie versions. 
As you can see in Table 6-1, the new breeds of dogs are acceptable at practi-
cally anybody’s table. The stats in this table come from three versions of one
national brand of hot dogs. Others may vary, so check the label. Woof.

Part II: Eating Your Way to Lower Cholesterol 
Big egg
In the United States, the eggs you buy at your
local food store, bazaar or emporium, come in
six basic sizes, based on the minimum weight
for one dozen eggs. Starting at the top, these
sizes are jumbo (30 oz per dozen), extra large (27
oz), large (24 oz), medium (21 oz), small (18 oz)
and peewee (15 oz). 
Useful, to be sure (the most popular are the
large), but none of them even holds a candle to
the beauty the California Egg Commission
named the largest single chicken egg ever
recorded: One full pound, with a double yolk and
a double shell. Sorry, I don’t have any nutrition
stats for this scenario.

A 4-ounce serving of lean beef has 6 g of fat, 2.3 of them saturated. A 4-ounce
serving of lamb has 23 g of fat, 9.9 of them saturated. Lean pork is somewhere
in between, with 9 g of total fat, 3 of them saturated, in a 4-ounce portion.
Who knew?
Liver
If you hated liver as a kid and still can’t stand to see it on your plate, this is
your moment to call your mom and say, “Nyah, nyah, I told you so.”
Like all foods from animals, liver is rich in high-quality proteins. It’s also the
single best natural source of retinol (“true vitamin A”), one of the few natural
sources of vitamin D, a gold mine of B vitamins (including vitamin B12), and
an excellent source of heme iron (the form of iron most easily absorbed by
your body).
But like other organ meats, such as brains and sweetbreads (pancreas), liver
has much more cholesterol than even well-marbled red meat. For example, 
a 3-ounce serving of lean roast beef has 69 mg of cholesterol, but a 3-ounce
serving of braised beef liver has — hold onto your hat — 330 mg of choles-
terol, 30 mg more than you’re supposed to have in an entire day. Just thinking
about what happens if you chop up chicken liver with chicken fat makes my
head ache! (For an explanation of what all that cholesterol is doing in the
brains, check out Chapter 2.)
Heart and tongue aren’t as high in cholesterol. They’re mainly muscle, not fat,
so they clock in at about the same fat and cholesterol levels as other red
meat. A 3-ounce serving of heart has 164 mg of cholesterol. A similar serving
of beef tongue has 91 mg of cholesterol. I guess it proves you gotta have
heart, not brains. Oooooooh boy, that’s lame!
95
Chapter 6: Pinning Down the “How-To’s” for a Cholesterol-Lowering Diet
Wieners
The frankfurter is a German culinary import, but
stuffing the long skinny sausage into a matching
bun was pure New World genius. Brooklyn
butcher Charles Feltman opened the first
sausage-on-a-roll stand in Coney Island in 1871.
Thirty years later, cartoonist T.A. “Tad” Dorgan
sketched baseball park vendors hawking the
long skinny pups on buns and captioned the 
picture “hot dog” because he couldn’t spell
“dachshund.”
Needless to say, the hot dog is still a favorite at
baseball parks where, according to the National
Hot Dog and Sausage Council, Americans
gobble 7 billion total franks each summer. That’s
enough dogs to stretch a chain from Dodger
Stadium in Los Angeles, California, to the
Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.

Margarine with trans fatty acids
You may think that switching to margarine eliminates the risks associated
with using butter on your bread. Well, as we native New Yorkers say, 
fuggeddaboudit!
The problem is that all margarines aren’t created equal. Some types are still
made with the form of hydrogenated fat called trans fat, the fats New York
City’s mayor and city council banned from use by chefs in the city’s restau-
rants in 2007.
As Chapter 5 explains, while trans fats aren’t necessarily saturated fats, they
act just like saturated fats in your body. They raise rather than lower your
blood levels of cholesterol.
The word trans refers to the placement of atoms on molecules. No, no, don’t
roll your eyes. This stuff is interesting. Two molecules may contain the exact-
same atoms but be totally different because of a small difference in the place-
ment of the atoms. This small difference in atom placement makes a big
difference in the way a molecule behaves.
In other words, trans fatty acids are fats behaving badly. So the margarine you
want is one with the words “No Trans Fats” on the label. At least this week.
Poultry skin and dark meat
What? Poultry is bad for a heart-healthy diet? It depends on the poultry. And
sometimes the part.
Ounce for ounce, skinless poultry has about the same amount of cholesterol
and fat as lean red meat, but generally, poultry fat is proportionately lower in
saturated fats and higher in unsaturated fats than the fat in red meats.
Decency almost prevented me from attempting to count the fat grams in crispy,
crunchy chicken or duck skin, a total I feared may approach the level of the
nutritionally obscene. But I figured you may want to know, so here goes: 
 For chicken, serving the meat with the skin just about doubles the fat
content. 
 For duck, a 4-ounce serving of skin-free meat has 14 g of fat, already a
pretty healthy (healthy?) helping. With the skin, a 4-ounce serving has
31.8 g of fat, 14.6 of them saturated. 
Yipes!

and dark-meat poultries with lean beef. Notice that the lean beef beats dark-

Unfiltered coffee
In 1994, researchers at the Agricultural University in Wageningen (the
Netherlands) identified two chemicals in coffee that may raise cholesterol
levels.
The chemicals are diterpenes, substances found in the oils of the coffee bean
that give coffee its wonderful flavor and aroma. The amount of diterpenes in
your coffee cup varies with the brewing method. 
Drip-brewed coffee, instant coffee, and percolated coffee contain only mini-
mal amounts of diterpenes. But boiled coffees — Greek coffee, Turkish coffee,
espresso, and the coffee brewed in French “press” coffee makers — may have
6 to 12 mg of diterpenes per 5-ounce cup. 
This amount is significant, and the Dutch researchers estimate that continu-
ally drinking five cups of press-brewed coffee or 15 espressos a day may raise
cholesterol levels 8 to 10 points. 
(There are no statistics right now defining the risk for people who gobble up
chocolate-covered coffee beans, but you can practically bet that some smart
researcher somewhere is working on it.)
97
Chapter 6: Pinning Down the “How-To’s” for a Cholesterol-Lowering Diet

Drinking coffee may also increase homocysteine levels in your blood. Homo-
cysteine is an amino acid produced in your body when you digest proteins. 
As I explain in Chapter 2, the American Heart Association has identified high
levels of homocysteine as an independent risk factor for heart disease.
A 1997 study at Norway’s University of Bergen found that even moderate
coffee consumption (five or fewer cups a day) is linked to higher blood levels
of homocysteine. This may explain the results of a 1995 study at Boston
University School of Public Health in Brookline (Massachusetts) showing the
risk of heart attack was 2.5 times higher among women who drank ten cups
of coffee a day than among those who averaged less than one cup. 
Whole-milk products
Ice cream, cheese, yogurt, cream, sour cream, half-and-half, whipped cream,
milk — what do all these things have in common?
Unless the label says “low-fat,” “reduced fat,” “skim,” or some variation
thereof, every one of them contains whole milk — milk with 3.5 percent 
butterfat, which is how it comes from the cow.
An 8-ounce glass of whole milk has 8 g of fat, with 5.1 g of saturated fat.
Compare that to an 8-ounce glass of 1 percent milk, which has only 3 g of fat,
1.6 of them saturated. Skim milk has less than 1 g of fat, with 0.3 g of satu-
rated fat. The best part? All versions deliver about 300 mg of calcium, 8 g of
protein, and 300 mg of vitamin D.
Playing with butterfat produces similar magic in other dairy products. Table 6-3
shows the value of reducing the fat in several kinds of milk treats.

Plant-Produced Foods That 
Help Control Cholesterol
Chapter 5 goes on for pages and pages — well, at least lines and lines —
about all the foods that can help you control your cholesterol. Literally thou-
sands of plant foods exist that you can use on a diet designed to help control
your cholesterol levels. 
However, the ones listed in this section are right at the top of the list, 
fruit- and veggie-wise. If you don’t like the foods in this section, hopefully 
my explanations here will encourage you to have second thoughts and start
adding them to your grocery list. These are the best of the best!
Apples
Like most fruit, every variety of apples has plenty of dietary fiber: insoluble
cellulose and lignin in the peel and soluble pectins in the flesh. As Chapter 5
explains, the former keeps things moving through your intestinal tract, and
the latter sops up cholesterol and other fats, preventing them from exiting
from your intestinal tract into your body and blood vessels.
The U.S. Apple Association (www.usapple.org) wants you to know another
fact: When scientists at the Université Paul Sabatier in Toulouse, France, fed
apples to hamsters specially bred to develop high levels of cholesterol, the
hamsters’ low-density lipoproteins (LDLs — the “bad” fat particles) went
down and their high-density lipoproteins (HDLs — the “good” particles that
carry cholesterol out of the body) went up.
The theory is that soluble pectins form a gel in your stomach that sops up fats
and ferries them out of your body as waste. An added bonus: Pectins also help
solidify stool, which justifies the reputation of raw apple shavings as a home
remedy for diarrhea. (Purified pectin is the active ingredient in many over-the-
counter, anti-diarrheal products.)
99
Chapter 6: Pinning Down the “How-To’s” for a Cholesterol-Lowering Diet

Finally, apples are rich in flavonoids, the naturally occurring antioxidant plant
compounds that make green tea and red grapes serious players in the war
against heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Sure seems to justify the time-
honored adage, “An apple a day keeps the doctor away.”
Avocados
For years, dieters and folks concerned about heart health avoided avocados
because the luscious green fruit (yes, the avocado is a fruit, not a veggie) is
high in fat. A 1-ounce serving — 1 tablespoon or 2 to 3 thin slices — has about
4.5 grams fat, which may be one reason why some people call the avocado a
“butter pear.”
But only a measly 0.5 gram of that fat is saturated. The rest is primarily 
cholesterol-lowering monounsaturated fatty acids plus polyunsaturated 
fatty acids (fats that don’t raise cholesterol levels), including the omega-3s
the American Heart Association recommends substituting for saturated fats.
The avocado also serves up about 20 vitamins and minerals, including vita-
min E, vitamin C, the B vitamin folate, iron, and potassium. In addition, the
avocado delivers protective phytonutrients (phyto = plant, nutrients = well,
nutrients), such as phytosterols — plant compounds that look like cholesterol
but actually keep the body from absorbing the cholesterol in other foods.
Chapter 14 includes a delicious recipe for Creamy Avocado Dip; try it 
with veggies!
Beans
Beans are little treasure chests of soluble gums and pectins, two varieties of
the soluble dietary fiber that grab and hold fats in your digestive tract.
Because you digest beans very slowly, unlike other high-carb foods, such 
as pasta and potatoes, your insulin secretion doesn’t spike.
This news is good for people with diabetes. In fact, one well-known study at
the University of Kentucky showed that eating a lot of beans may enable
people with Type 1 diabetes (whose bodies produce practically no insulin) 
to reduce their daily insulin requirements by nearly 40 percent. Patients with
Type 2 diabetes, whose bodies produce some insulin, may be able to cut
insulin intake by 98 percent. This news is also good for people watching their
cholesterol because a sudden rise in insulin has now been added to the list 
of risks.
But good as they are, beans aren’t perfect. The human gut can’t digest dietary
fiber and some complex carbs, such as the sugars in beans. As a result, these
guys sit in your intestines as fodder for resident friendly bacteria that munch
on the carbs and then release carbon dioxide and (ugh) methane, a smelly gas.

Part II: Eating Your Way to Lower Cholesterol 

Which leaves you with one of those conundrums that make life so interesting:
Heart disease (and diabetes) or smelly gas? Smelly gas or heart disease (and
diabetes)? Decisions. Decisions.
Brown rice
Score one for the original vegetarian foodies, the guys who were eating whole
grains — especially brown rice — way back in the Nutritional Dark Ages
before anyone even knew what cholesterol was.
Boy, were they smart cookies. All rice is low-cal, low-fat, and cholesterol-free.
But when it comes to controlling your cholesterol levels, the rice to rave
about is brown.
Brown rice gets its color and its nutty flavor from the germ (the fatty inner
part of the seed) and the bran (the nutrient-rich outer hull).
Like oat bran, rice bran is a food worthy of respect in its own right. Oat bran
gets the publicity, but as long ago as 1989, a U.S. Department of Agriculture
(www.usda.gov) study showed that feeding rice bran to hamsters can reduce
the animals’ cholesterol levels as effectively as the better-known oat stuff.
By the way, the USA Rice Federation (www.usarice.com) says that the aver-
age American consumes about 25 pounds of rice a year. Right now, most of
that consumption is white rice, without the bran. By increasing your con-
sumption of brown rice versus white rice, you can strike a blow for low 
cholesterol.
Chocolate
No list of healthful foods can be considered complete if it doesn’t include
chocolate — the treat that says, “Hey, I’ve been watching my cholesterol like
crazy, and I deserve a reward!”
Contrary to popular wisdom, plain dark chocolate isn’t an empty-calorie
food. Chocolate comes from the cocoa bean, which — like other beans — is
packed with proteins, B vitamins, and vital minerals, such as iron, magne-
sium, and copper.
As a plant food, chocolate has no cholesterol at all. True, cocoa butter (the
fat in cocoa beans) is a saturated fat, but some sweets companies have done
a swell job creating chocolate products without cocoa butter, thanks to
modern technology.
101
Chapter 6: Pinning Down the “How-To’s” for a Cholesterol-Lowering Diet

Wait! There’s more. The cocoa bean also has small amounts of caffeine (an
average of 18 milligrams (mg) per cup of cocoa, versus 130 mg per 5-ounce
cup of drip-brewed coffee), phenylethylalanine (PEA, a mood elevator some-
times called “the love chemical”), and theobromine (a muscle stimulant). 
Zip-pi-dee-doo-dah.
And chocolate contains loads of flavonoids and catechins, the naturally occur-
ring chemicals credited with making grapes, wine, and tea heart-healthy. In
the spring of 2007, researchers reported to the annual meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science that consuming the flavonols in
chocolate increases blood flow to the brain.
And a German study published in the June 2007 issue of the International
Journal of Medical Science announced that cocoa consumption among the
Kuna people, islanders living near Panama, reduces the risk of cancer, stroke,
heart failure, and diabetes.
Is it any wonder that the Hershey Company has added Hershey’s Natural
Flavonol Antioxidant Milk Chocolate, Hershey’s Whole Bean Chocolate, and
Hershey’s All Natural Extra Dark Pure Dark Chocolate to its “goodness choco-
late portfolio” of antioxidant-rich chocolate bars and bits with labels promi-
nently touring the high levels of flavonols in the bar? Surely you jest.
Grapes
Grapes are great. A single serving of 20 green Thompson seedless or deep red
Tokay or Emperor grapes has 70 to 80 calories, 12 to 16 percent of the recom-
mended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin C, and up to 84 percent of the
potassium found in 1⁄2 cup of orange juice.

Omega chocolates
On July 3, 2007, just in time to make every 
nutrition-conscious American chocoholic’s 
July 4th celebration even more celebratory,
Ocean Nutrition of Canada issued a press
release to announce that Canadian chocolate
maker Les Truffes au Chocolat would be adding
a dash of Ocean Nutrition’s omega-3 fatty acids
to the recipe for its O Trois chocolate bars and
chocolate “fingers.”
The Calgary confectioners plan to distribute
these special chocolates first in western
Canada, then across Canada, and finally down
into the United States. Can’t wait for these treats
to make it to your town? Check out the Les
Truffes Web site (www.lestruffes.com)

Mae West, the Madonna of a past time, used to invite her admirers to “Come
up and peel me a grape sometime.” But your goal is to lower your choles-
terol, so that advice isn’t for you.
Grape skins and pulp contain resveratrol, the flavonoid some folks credit with
lowering cholesterol, reducing the risk of heart attack, and maybe even pro-
tecting against some forms of cancer.
Ounce for ounce, you get more resveratrol from grape juice than from plain
grapes. The darker the juice, the higher the resveratrol. Purple grape juice
has more resveratrol than red grape juice, which has more than white grape
juice. As for individual grape varieties, in 1998, a team of food scientists from
the USDA Agricultural Research Service identified a native American grape,
the muscadine, as an unusually potent source of resveratrol. So aren’t you
glad that about half of all muscadines grown in the U.S. are used to make
grape juice?
Prefer your grape juice in the form of wine? Read all about that in Chapter 10.
Certain margarines
At the start of the margarine revolution, around the time when television sets
broadcast only in black and white, margarine was a white paste in a plastic bag
with a small button on top that you squeezed to release a yellow coloring to
knead through the white stuff. Its only virtue was its price: lower than butter’s.
A few years later, with the discovery that butter was high in cholesterol and
that cholesterol caused heart attacks, margarine was transformed into health
food, the non-butter that can protect your heart. Until, that is, nutrition scien-
tists linked hydrogenated fats — the stuff that made it possible to mold the
original soft margarine paste into butter-like bars — to an increased risk of
heart attack.
Today, some really healthful margarines are made with plant sterols, natural
compounds found in grains, fruits, and vegetables, and stanols, compounds
created by adding hydrogen atoms from wood pulp and other plant sources
to sterols.
Both sterols and stanols, which are from plants, thus qualifying these mar-
garines for inclusion in this list of plant foods that protect your heart, work
like little sponges, sopping up cholesterol in your intestines before it can
make its way into your bloodstream. Because of this sponge-like action, your
total cholesterol levels and your levels of low-density lipoproteins (also known
as LDLs or “bad” cholesterol) fall.
103
Chapter 6: Pinning Down the “How-To’s” for a Cholesterol-Lowering Diet

The studies show that one to two 1-tablespoon servings of stanol or sterol
margarines a day can lower LDLs by 10 to 17 percent with results showing up
in as little as two weeks.
Some eagle-eyed readers may take out their magnifying glasses and actually
read the ingredient list on the product labels, a commendable act that helps
you separate nutritious food from the not-so-hot possibilities. The problem is
that those who do will find the words “hydrogenated fats.” The reaction may
be, “Ugh! Don’t hydrogenated fats clog your arteries?” The simple answer is
yes. But these margarines are specially formulated to carry fats (including
hydrogenated fats) out of your body. The amount of hydrogenated fats in the
margarines is less than the amount of fats the margarines remove. In other
words, the net impact is good for everybody. Whew!
Nuts
Pass up the pretzels. Skip the chips. At snack time, reach for the nuts. At least
the almonds and walnuts.
Although nuts are technically a high-fat food, the nutrition gurus at California’s
Loma Linda University say that adding moderate amounts of nuts to a 
cholesterol-lowering diet or substituting nuts for other high-fat foods, such as
meats, may cut normal to moderately high levels of total cholesterol and LDL
as much as 12 percent.
These guys should know. Over the past several years, they’ve made headlines
with nutty studies:
 In one, volunteers were told to follow one of two diets, both based on
National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommendations. Diet
#1 got 20 percent of its calories from fats in oils and fatty foods such as
meat; Diet #2 got 20 percent of its calories from high-fat nuts (like wal-
nuts) instead. Both diets appeared to lower cholesterol levels.
 In a second study, the Loma Lindans compared the standard NCEP diet
with two almond diets, the first deriving 10 percent of its calories from
nuts, the second, 20 percent. Like the walnut diet, both almond diets
lowered cholesterol, lowered blood pressure, and so on.
The conclusions, dutifully reported in scientific journals such as the
American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, are that nuts provide fatty acids and
other substances that reduce the risk of blood clots, amino acids (such as
arginine) that the body uses to build other clot-blocking compounds, and
dietary fiber that ferries cholesterol out of your body.
In other words, it pays to be nuts about nuts (see Chapter 14’s recipe for
Cinnamon and Spice Almonds).
104
Part II: Eating Your Way to Lower Cholesterol 

Oatmeal
For more than 30 years, scientists have known that eating foods high in solu-
ble dietary fiber (more about that in Chapter 5) can lower your cholesterol.
Then along came oatmeal, a gee-whiz wonder food whose primary soluble
dietary fiber — beta glucan — is a more super-effective cholesterol buster
than other types of soluble dietary fiber, such as the pectin in apples (see the
section “Apples” earlier in this chapter).
But guess what? Not every oatmeal gets the job done. The Right Stuff is oat-
meal with oat bran, the brown outer covering of the oatmeal grain that’s
often removed to make oatmeal cereal (especially the quick-cook kind).
Researchers at the University of Kentucky reported back in 1990, practically
the Dark Ages for anti-cholesterol foodies, that people who add 1⁄2 cup dry oat
bran (not oatmeal) to their regular diets may be able to lower their levels of
LDL by as much as 25 percent.
Not to be outdone, scientists at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of
Medicine performed a study funded by Quaker Oats. The scientists found
that 208 healthy volunteers whose normal cholesterol readings averaged
about 200 mg/dL were able to reduce their total cholesterol levels by an 
average of 9.3 percent with a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet supplemented by 
2 ounces of oats or oat bran every day.
Most of the volunteers in the Northwestern study were eating oatmeal, not
oat bran, so look carefully at the difference in the numbers. At the University
of Kentucky, the drop in cholesterol was 25 percent. At Northwestern, it was
9.3 percent. Even more interesting, the Northwestern folks said that only
about one-third of the cholesterol reduction was due to the oats.
The cereal makers rounded the Northwestern number up to 10 percent. The
risk of heart attack drops two percentage points for every one point drop in
cholesterol, so the National Research Council called that a potential 20 per-
cent drop in the risk of a heart attack, but how well eating oatmeal works for
you really depends on how high your cholesterol is to start.
Suppose your cholesterol clocks in higher than 250 mg/dL. Lowering it 10
percent takes you down to 225 mg/dL. Now you’re within shooting distance
of a safe level (under 200 mg/dL). Now assume your cholesterol level is
already a safe 199 mg/dL or lower. A low-fat, low-cholesterol diet plus oats
may drop it to 180 mg/dL, but the oats account for only 6 points of your loss.
The rest is due to — get this — your low-fat, low-cholesterol diet.
In other words, at the lower cholesterol levels, what really matters is an over-
all low-fat, low-cholesterol diet. Adding oats makes so little difference that if
you hate the stuff, it’s okay to pass it by and get your soluble fiber from other
foods, like brown rice (see more on that previously in this chapter).
105
Chapter 6: Pinning Down the “How-To’s” for a Cholesterol-Lowering Diet

Pomegranate
When is an apple not an apple? When it’s a pomegranate, of course. Historians
suspect that the pomegranate was the “apple” Eve picked in the Garden of
Eden. They know for sure it was such a favorite in ancient Egypt that Moses
added it to the list of goodies waiting in the Promised Land. (Check it out in
Deuteronomy 8:8.)
Also, this fruit figures big in Greek mythology as well: The goddess Persephone
became a semi-permanent resident of the Underworld because she couldn’t
resist the luscious seeds of an Underworld pomegranate.
The good part of the pomegranate (pome = apple, granate = seeds/grains) 
is the jelly-like red pulp in “juice sacs” surrounding the seeds. To get at it,
slice through the stem end of the pomegranate, and pull off the top, taking
care to avoid splashing red pomegranate juice all over you. Then slice the
pomegranate into wedges and pull the wedges apart and bite into them.
Your reward as you crush the jelly around the seeds is a liquid rich in
polyphenols, the antioxidant compounds that help lower “bad” cholesterol.
Nutrition researchers at Technion Faculty of Medicine and Rambam Medical
Center in Haifa, Israel, rate pomegranate juice higher in polyphenols than all
the current favorites, such as red wine, blueberry juice, cranberry juice,
green tea, black tea, and orange juice.
Another team of Technion scientists says that the juice and the oil extracted
from pomegranate seeds kill breast cancer cells in test tubes and may eventu-
ally point the way to a new drug in the fight against breast cancer.
Maybe Eve and Persephone knew what they were doing when one picked and
the other one enjoyed that funny apple.
Slicing the Cholesterol from 
Your Dinner Plate
Reducing the amount of cholesterol lurking on your dinner plate is simply a
matter of knowing which foods have what fats, and wielding your knife — or
fork or spoon — accordingly.
This section is chock-full of low- or no-cholesterol alternatives and strata-
gems. For illustration only, I use some well-known, brand-name products as
examples of low- or no-cholesterol alternatives. Feel free to substitute your
own favorites. Just be sure to read the label first.
106
Part II: Eating Your Way to Lower Cholesterol 

Finally, all the nutrient numbers used in this chapter come from the United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Nutrient Database. For more on how
to use this incredibly valuable tool, see the appendix.
Choosing low-fat or no-fat dairy products
Milk may not be quite the perfect food your grandmother thought it was, but
modern good-food-people know that dairy products such as milk and cheese
are the best natural sources of the calcium that keeps bones strong.
The problem is that these foods may be high in cholesterol and saturated fat.
The solution is to opt for the low- or no-fat milk products stacked a mile high
in every supermarket dairy case.
How much lower can you go? Well, one 5-ounce cup of whole milk has 33 mg
cholesterol and 5 grams saturated fat. But lookie-here: one 5-ounce cup of
skim (fat-free) milk has only 4.4 mg cholesterol and 0.3 grams saturated fat. 
If you absolutely have to have a smidgen of creaminess in your milk, one 
5-ounce cup of 1-percent-fat milk has 9.8 mg cholesterol and 1.6 grams satu-
rated fat.
One regular Kraft American Cheese slice has 20 mg cholesterol and 3 grams
saturated fat; one slice of Kraft Free American cheese has no cholesterol and
no fat. And here’s a bonus: the regular cheese has 70 calories per slice; the
fat-free cheese has only 30 calories. Yum.
Serving stew instead of steak
No matter how you slice it, red meat is red meat, cholesterol, saturated fat,
and all. To compensate, start by trimming all the visible fat — yes, that white
stuff on the sides. Then stew your beef or lamb, rather than broiling or roast-
ing it. (You can do this with pork, too.)
After the cooking’s done, stash your stew in the fridge for a couple of hours
until a layer of white stuff — yes, more fat from the interior of the meat —
hardens on top. Lift off the fat layer and away goes a whole lot of cholesterol
and saturated fat.
How much? Hard to tell exactly, but clearly you’ve done a good-nutrition,
weight-control deed for the day. You not only reduce the cholesterol and 
saturated fat content of the dish, but also lift away 100 calories with every
tablespoon of fat.
Just thinking about that makes those tight jeans feel looser.
107
Chapter 6: Pinning Down the “How-To’s” for a Cholesterol-Lowering Diet

Washing the chopped meat
No kidding. Put a teapot of water on to boil. Put the chopped meat in a pan,
breaking it into small pieces, and cook until the meat browns. Put the meat
into a strainer and let the liquid fat run off, and then pour a cup of boiling
water over the meat in the strainer.
Repeat the hot water bath twice. Once again, every tablespoon of fat that
drains away saves you 100 calories, plus cholesterol and saturated fat.
Use the de-fatted meat in spaghetti sauce or to stuff a nutritious green pepper
of cabbage leaf. Yum.
Peeling the poultry
Most of the fat and therefore most of the cholesterol in poultry is in the skin.
For example, 3.5 ounces of raw chicken breast with skin has 64 mg choles-
terol and 2.7 grams saturated fat. Take off the skin, and that same 3.5 ounces
of chicken breast serves up 58 mg cholesterol and a miniscule 0.3 grams satu-
rated fat.
Obviously, the way you cook the chicken may affect the fat and cholesterol
levels. According to the USDA Nutrient Database, a chicken breast with skin
fried in batter has nearly 30 percent more cholesterol (85 mg) and 30 percent
more saturated fat (3.5 grams) than the raw stuff. 
Fry the skinless chicken breast, and the saturated fat goes up 300 percent to
1.2 grams per serving — but that’s still less than the fat you get from fried
chicken with skin.
Got the picture? Good.
Spritzing the fish
Naturally oily fish like salmon and mackerel are rich in omega-3 fatty acids
that protect your heart. Don’t change the equation by drowning them in
creamy, high-cholesterol, high-fat, high-calorie sauces when a spritz of lemon
and some green seasonings (think dill) can do the trick.
Next.

Part II: Eating Your Way to Lower Cholesterol 

Sparing the bread spread
Now that everybody knows vegetable oils are lower in saturated fats than
butter, restaurants from pizza parlors to the fanciest white tablecloth estab-
lishments cater to their patrons’ sense of sophistication by substituting a
small bowl of olive oil for the standard plate of butter pats.
Before you reach for the oil, though, consider this: Vegetable oils, including
the ubiquitous olive oil, aren’t an unmitigated blessing. Yes, the oils have less
saturated fat than butter. True, they’re cholesterol-free. But the bad news is
that all dietary fats — butter, margarine, oils — have about the same number
of calories per serving, 100 to 125 calories per tablespoon. These unneces-
sary calories can pile pounds onto parts of your body and that may raise
your cholesterol levels. Try the bread as is. You might like it.
By the way, don’t assume that your bread is low-fat just because you didn’t
butter or oil it. Some breads, such as foccacia, popovers, and muffins, come
pre-buttered or oiled. To test the fat content of your bread, pick up a piece
and put it on your napkin. Hand sticky? Oil spots on the napkin? You know
what that means.
Keeping the veggies basic
Once upon a time, when vegetables were new to the Western table and people
who were used to gnawing on a haunch of beef considered them suspect at
best, the accepted cooking method was to boil the plant into a no-color-
no-texture-no-flavor lump.
Next came butter, cheese, and cream sauces, often broiled to a tasty, brown,
fat-and-cholesterol crust. Today, the smart way to cook vegetables is as
quickly and simply as possible. Steaming over bouillon works; so does broil-
ing veggie kebobs.
109
Chapter 6: Pinning Down the “How-To’s” for a Cholesterol-Lowering Diet
Low-fat, cholesterol-free baking tip
Bake your own bread? Cake? Muffins? To reduce
the fat content, don’t grease the pan. Instead,
bake with parchment paper. Every tablespoon of
butter you don’t use cuts 31 mg cholesterol and
7.3 grams saturated fat from the final product.
And eliminating one tablespoon of any fat
reduces the calorie count by 100 big ones.

As for flavorings, what could be better than those other plant foods: Herbs
and spices. A pinch of thyme here, a sprinkle of oregano there, a dash of dill,
some chives — terrific. For those of you who simply can’t give up thickened
sauces, the solution may be a “reduction” (boiled-down bouillon) or a cream
sauce made with trans-fat-free margarine and fat-free powdered milk instead
of butter and cream. Purists may wince, but try it. You may like it — and so
will your arteries.

No human being should have to give up dessert just to maintain a healthy

According to the Haagen Dazs Web site, one half-cup serving of Haagen Dazs
chocolate ice cream has 115 mg cholesterol and (gulp!) 11 grams saturated
fat. But one half-cup serving of Haagen Dazs low-fat sorbet has no, repeat no,
cholesterol or saturated fat.
You can assume that similar differences apply to other varieties of frozen
desserts, and take it from an expert (me), substituting the second for the first
is no deprivation, particularly if you toss some fruit on the cold chocolate
stuff and maybe add some Hershey’s Syrup. It says right here on the bottle I
just took out of my refrigerator that the chocolate syrup has zero cholesterol
and fat.

S
ome Americans worry about global warming. Others suspect that the
real threat to North America isn’t the rising temperature but the rising
poundage of several hundred million well-padded citizens. If the trend contin-
ues, they say, the whole darned continent may soon sink. Okay, maybe that’s
an exaggeration, but according to Health, United States 2006, the 30th edition
of an annual Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on trends in
health stats:
 Compared to 1960/1962, the percentage of overweight American adults
ages 20 to 74 remained pretty much the same in 2003/2004, but the per-
centage of obese adults rose from 13 percent to 34 percent.
 The percentage of overweight children ages 6 to 11 more than doubled
between 1976/1980 and 2003/2004, rising from 7 percent to 19 percent.
Among adolescents ages 12 to 19, the percentage of those who were
overweight more than tripled, rising from 5 percent to 17 percent.
In Canada, where the percentage of obese adults nearly doubled between
1978/1979 and 2004, things are pretty much the same. Check out these fac-
toids from Statistics Canada’s 1996/1997 to 2004/2005 National Population
Health Survey:
 From 1996/1997 to 2004/2005, Canadian adults, men as well as women,
grew steadily heavier. Every two years, younger adults ages 18 to 33
gained more weight than did adults ages 34 to 49. Adults ages 50 to 54
also gained, but they gained less than the younger folks.

 The average weight gain among adult men rose from 10 pounds in
1996/1997 to 11 pounds by 2004/2005. Among women, the average 
gain rose from 9.9 pounds to 10.5 pounds.
While all this extra weight may not tilt the planet, it may certainly be a pre-
dictor of health problems, especially for people who work to control their
cholesterol, which, come to think of it, is pretty much the title of the book
you hold in your hands.
Presenting the Health Risks 
Posed by Extra Pounds
Many people want to lose weight to look better. Others want to gain weight
for the same reason. But reaching a healthful weight — and staying there —
is more than a matter of vanity. It’s also about being healthy. Years and years
of scientific studies and surveys have produced irrefutable evidence that
excess pounds often equal higher risk of morbidity, doctor-speak for illness,
and mortality, doctor-speak for you-know-what — the big D (d-e-a-t-h).
To be precise, the message from your good friends at the American Heart
Association (AHA) is that being overweight raises your risk of five of the 
top-ten leading causes of death in the United States, Canada, and Europe:
 Cancer (some types)
 Diabetes
 High blood pressure
 Stroke
Wait! That list shows only four kinds of big trouble. The missing fifth item is,
you guessed it, coronary heart disease, which you may know by its alias, heart
attack. Table 7-1 lists several other weight-related problems that, although
not in the big five, can certainly make you extremely uncomfortable.

Weight-Related Problem
Incontinence
Being overweight weakens pelvic muscles, which leads 
to urine leakage.
Osteoarthritis
Being overweight stresses joints.
Sleep apnea
Being overweight weakens the muscles at the back of 
the throat that hold the airway open causing momentary 
cessation of breathing and frequent awakening during 
the night.
Connecting cholesterol with weight
You don’t have to be enormously overweight to experience a connection
between your higher weight and a higher risk of heart disease. Being as little
as 20 percent over your suggested healthy weight — which I get to in a
minute — raises your total cholesterol and your “bad” LDLs while lowering
your “good” HDLs. (To brush up on this coronary alphabet soup, check out
LDLs and HDLs in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3.)
But don’t despair. Losing weight reverses the equation. Diet and exercise
away those extra pounds, and your not-so-hot LDLs will start to fall while
your hot-stuff HDLs begin to rise.
Gaining is the same as losing in this arena
Toting around too many pounds is hard on your heart and blood vessels, but
gaining weight is worse because it forces your body to adapt to new, stressful
conditions. Think about it. When you gain weight, you make more tissue. The
tissue needs oxygen, so you have to make more blood, which carries oxygen.
The extra blood stretches the chambers of your heart, which must work
harder to push the blood out into your body where the extra volume of blood
stresses your blood vessels. Anyone hear a diagnosis of high blood pressure
in the near future?
As a result, the AHA, which ’s your heart, wants you to know that simply
preventing weight gain is the most important factor in preventing your choles-
terol level from rising as you grow older. Imagine! As you grow older, not 
gaining weight keeps your cholesterol level in check more effectively than a
low-fat diet, cholesterol-lowering drugs, or exercise. And you don’t have to 
go on a crash diet to see the benefits. According to the AHA, even a modest
weight loss — say 5 to 10 percent of your total weight — lowers total choles-
terol. Pretty encouraging stuff, huh?
117
Chapter 7: Weighing Weight’s Weight on Cholesterol

By the way, several similar studies show that gaining weight also increases
levels of triglycerides (check out Chapter 2), another risk factor for heart
attacks. Hey, a two-for-one special: Controlling weight controls both your
cholesterol and your triglycerides. What a bargain.
Figuring Out Who’s Fat
Up to this point in this chapter, I have used the word overweight seven times,
but I haven’t defined it. So let me do that right now.
One way to decide whether someone’s overweight is to see what he or she
looks like. Right? Wrong.
Actress Lillian Russell, the femme fatale during the late 19th and early 20th
centuries, weighed in at a hefty 230 pounds. One hundred years later, Nicole
Richie or Eva Longoria tips the scales at, oh, maybe, 98 pounds. Your great-
grandparents would have rushed these skinny merinks (great-granny’s word
for v-e-r-y thin) to the doctor for a weight-gain tonic. Today, it may be Russell
whom people would want to ship off to the doctor.
Clearly, judging whether an individual is overweight or thin by appearance is
subjective. It depends on who’s doing the lookin’ and the cultural standards
that person applies. Conclusion: The eyeball test isn’t a reliable method for
determining healthful weight. You need something a tad more scientific.
Luckily, modern nutrition offers some reasonably rational options to decide
who’s overweight. These options include
 Body shape
 Weight charts
 Body composition
Evaluating body shape
All healthy adults have some body fat. Women generally have proportion-
ately more body fat than men who, in turn, have proportionately more
muscle tissue than women. Where a person stores the fat tissue he or she
accumulates is gender-related. Men are most likely to pile excess fat around
the middle (abdomen). The result is a body type called an “apple.” Women
usually store excess fat around their hips, buttocks, and upper thighs, a 
pattern called a “pear.”
118
Part III: Leading a Cholesterol-Lowering Lifestyle 

A more scientific name for the apple/pear shape descriptions is the waist/hip
ratio, a measurement of the relative size of the waist and hips. To find your
ratio, follow these steps:
1. Run a tape measure around your waist.
2. Run a tape measure around your hips.
3. Divide the measurement of your waist by the measurement of your
hips.
For example: waist (29 inches) ÷ hips (39 inches) = a waist/hip ratio of 0.74
A woman whose waist/hip ratio is higher than 0.8 or a man whose waist/hip
ratio is higher than 0.95 — both apple shape numbers — may be at higher
risk of weight-related health problems, including heart attacks.
However, it’s only fair to point out that the BMI-plus-waist circumference
described below is considered far more reliable than the apple/pear waist-
to-hip ratio alone.
Charting a healthful weight
In 1990, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and
Human Services included a weight chart in that year’s edition of the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans:
 The new chart numbers were weight goals, not ideal weights.
 The weight goals were based on the entire population of the United States.
 The weight charts were unisex with a single set of weight goals for men
and women of the same height.
 Best of all, the new weight goals were divided into two age groups — one
set for people ages 19 to 34 and the other for people ages 35 and older.
Table 7-2 shows the 1990 Dietary Guidelines for Americans weight charts for
adult men and women. People with small, lighter bones and proportionately
more fat tissue than muscle tissue (fat weighs less than muscle) are likely to
weigh in at the low end. People with large, heavier bones and proportionately
more muscle than fat, are likely to weigh in at the high end. As a general (but
by no means invariable) rule, women have smaller frames and less muscle
than men, so they weigh less than men of the same height and age.

For ten years, weight charts remained fairly friendly and forgiving. Then boom!
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2000 tossed out the higher weights for
older people. As of the new millennium, the healthy weights for everyone,
young or old, woman or man, were the weights for people between the ages of
19 and 34 from the 1990 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which you can still
find in Table 7-2. Pretty skinny thinking, if you ask me.
120
Part III: Leading a Cholesterol-Lowering Lifestyle 

Then boom! — again. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 tossed out all
weight tables in favor of the body mass index chart.
Indexing your mass
In 1990, just as the Dietary Guidelines for Americans published its pleasantly
elastic two-tier weight chart, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
introduced the first federal guidelines on how to identify, evaluate, and treat
people with excess poundage.
The most interesting section was the introduction of a new weight measure-
ment: body mass index (BMI). BMI is a unisex measure of weight relative to
height, a number — such as 24 — that serves as a predictor of your risk for
weight-related illnesses, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease,
stroke, gallbladder disease, and arthritic pain. The higher your number, the
higher your risk. So, what’s your number? Keep reading.
Calculating your BMI
The original equation used to calculate BMI was set up in kilograms for weight
(W) and meters for height (H): BMI = W÷H2. But if you’re partial to pounds and
inches, you can calculate BMI in pounds and inches as long as you add one
extra step. The equation looks like this:
BMI = W÷H2 × 705
To get your own BMI, plug your numbers into the BMI equation. For example,
if you’re 5'3" tall and weigh 138 pounds, the equation for your BMI looks like
this:
BMI = W÷H2 × 705
[138÷(63 × 63)] × 705
(138÷3969) × 705
24.5
Hate math? Eyes glazing over? Just run your finger down Table 7-3, which does
the math for men and women from 4'11" to 6'4" tall, starting with a weight of 91
pounds. To use the table, find your appropriate height in the column labeled
Height. Move across to your weight. The number at the top of the table is the
BMI at your height and weight.

Chapter 7: Weighing Weight’s Weight on Cholesterol

Using BMI to predict health
Based on health statistics and death rates provided by the World Health
Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National
Center for Health Statistics characterize the various categories of BMI as 
follows:
 Underweight: BMI lower than 18.5.
 Normal: BMI of 18.5 to 24.9. (A minimal risk of weight-related health
problems.)
 Overweight: BMI of 25 to 29.9. (A moderate risk of weight-related health
problems. For reference, BMI of 25 is about 10 percent over ideal body
weight.)
 Obese: BMI of 30 to 39.9. (High risk of weight-related health problems.)
 Extremely obese: BMI over 40. (The highest risk of weight-related health
problems.)
BMI is a valuable health predictor for most men and women between the ages
of 19 and 70, but it’s not for everyone. BMI isn’t a reliable guide for the 
following:
 Women who are pregnant or nursing. Weight gain is temporary and does
not reflect a true weight/height relationship.
 People who are very tall or very short.
 Professional athletes or weight trainers. Very muscular people, such as
boxer Laila Ali or the great gang of guys at the World Wrestling
Federation, can have a high BMI but not be fat.
Making Lifestyle Changes
The rules of the weight-loss road are fairly simple and entirely sensible. After
you decide that you really do need to lose a little weight, the following list of
do’s and don’ts can make life bearable — and less weighty.
124
Part III: Leading a Cholesterol-Lowering Lifestyle 
Waist not
The size of your waist may affect the riskiness
(or lack thereof) of your BMI. To get the relevant
number, measure your waist circumference (the
distance around your natural waist just above
the navel). If your BMI is higher than 25, a waist
circumference equal to or higher than 35 inches
for a woman or 40 inches for a man puts you into
a “high risk” — that is, overweight — category.

Counting those dreaded calories
Repeat after me: A healthful weight-loss regimen isn’t a starvation diet. Keep
these calorie requirements in mind when you’re working to lose weight:
 Women require a food plan that provides at least 1,200 calories a day.
Top limit for weight loss: 1,500 calories.
 Men require a food plan that provides at least 1,500 calories a day. Top
limit for weight loss: 1,800 calories.
You probably noticed that I describe a totally unfair fact of life: Men and
women — even when they’re exactly the same weight and height — require
different amounts of calories to stay healthy. A man’s body has proportion-
ately more muscle tissue than a woman’s body. Muscle tissue is “active”
tissue that burns calories. Therefore, men need about 10 percent more calo-
ries each day, even when they’re losing weight.
Ingesting your daily vitamins and minerals
Your weight-loss food plan (have you noticed that I’m subtly substituting
“food plan” for “diet?”) should provide all the essential nutrients. Exactly
what nutrients you need and how much of them are spelled out in excruciat-
ing detail in your copy of Nutrition For Dummies, 4th Edition (Wiley). (Don’t
have one? Get one. I wrote it. It’s goooooood.)
Another good guide to vitamins and minerals is the ingredients label on any
reputable brand of one-pill-a-day supplements. Or you can bookmark this
page, turn to Chapter 16, and check out one of the totally excellent nutri-
tional Web sites you find there.
Are you back? Good. I want to spend a minute covering why you should avoid
fad diets, or as I like to label ’em, funny food plans. You know the ones I
mean. These diets often base their recommendations on, oh, maybe one
study, and it’s often a dubious one. Seventeen overweight hamsters in Ohio
lost weight after three months on a diet of nothing but apricots, peaches, and
clam juice. Here are a few ways to spot fad diets:
 These diets are never endorsed by reputable organizations such as the
American Heart Association or the American Dietetic Association.
Instead, they use testimonials from people who may mean well but have
no real nutrition expertise (like the Northeastern Ohio Hamster Owners
Association).
 The diet plans go against generally accepted nutritional advice. (I’m no
hamster expert, but I’m guessing that these furry creatures need nutri-
ents other than those supplied by apricots, peaches, and clam juice.)
125
Chapter 7: Weighing Weight’s Weight on Cholesterol

Do yourself a favor. Fight fad diets. Who wants to eat 50 grapefruits a day
anyway? You should be eating a variety of healthy, tasty foods while you’re
eating less. 
Making the menu marvelous
A healthful food plan, even one designed to take off pounds, includes many
different foods. Yes, broccoli is packed with anti-cancer phytochemicals (com-
pounds found naturally in plants), plus vitamin A, vitamin C, the heart-
healthy B vitamin folate, carbohydrates, and dietary fiber. But man (and
woman) can’t live by green florets alone.
Food variety is important to weight loss. Food is meant to be enjoyed — 
yes, even low-calorie food. When your weight-loss menu is interesting and
tastes good, sticking to it is less of a chore. Besides, human beings are omni-
vores, which means they have digestive tracts equipped to handle foods 
from plants and animals. Although vegetarianism certainly can be a healthful
choice, maybe even a moral one for folks who don’t want to consume ani-
mals, your body has the ability to metabolize and use all kinds of food: meat,
dairy, grains, fruits, and veggies. Why not go for it?
126
Part III: Leading a Cholesterol-Lowering Lifestyle 
30 + 30 = ??
The perfect example of a silly food plan is the
one that promises to take off 30 pounds in 30
days, a formula chosen presumably because
some months do have 30 days and the numbers
sound good together.
According to the American Society of Bariatric
Physicians (weight loss experts), this promise is
an empty one because:
 To lose 1 pound of body weight, you must
cut out 3,500 calories.
 To lose 30 pounds in 30 days, you must cut
out 105,000 calories (30 × 3,500 calories =
105,000 calories).
 If you normally get 2,800 calories a day —
more than most American women and
some men eat every day — you only take in
84,000 calories in 30 days.
 If you were to stop eating entirely for 30
days, you would still need to get rid of
another 21,000 calories to reach the 105,000
mark.
Any volunteers?
Forget the pound a day business. A slow but
steady loss of 5 pounds in that same 30-day
period means cutting just 17,500 calories (5 ×
3,500 calories = 17,500 calories). Divide 17,500
by 30, and you come up with 580 calories a day,
a reduction most serious weight-loss programs
can handle.
Now can I see a show of hands from volunteers?

Living happily ever after
Here’s one from the depressing-but-true file: Most people who take off weight
put it back on again within three years. The only way to succeed at losing
weight — which means taking it off and keeping it off — is to change your
mind along with your menu. The goal isn’t a quick 10 pounds off your hips.
The goal is a lifelong healthful weight.
To reach this goal, organizations such as the American Heart Association, the
American Diabetes Association, and the American Dietetic Association, their
international counterparts, and all the relevant governmental agencies across
the globe offer pretty much the same prescription: Eat less, eat a variety of
foods, get the nutrients you need, step up your exercise time, and take the
time you need to lose pounds safely.
Boring? Yup. Sensible? Yup. A way to succeed? Without a doubt.
Tossing Out the Scales
Now that I’ve spent an entire chapter talking about weight and how weight
gain may adversely affect your cholesterol levels and, by implication, your
risk of heart disease, I’m slamming on the breaks. I’m going to reverse
engines and back-peddle a bit to mention those special times when weight
doesn’t seem to matter at all. The truth is that most people pick up pounds
as they grow older, and many manage to stay healthy anyway.
One way to explain this seemingly odd situation among an older population
is to suggest that people who’ve experienced weight-related illnesses have
already gone to their reward. The ones left standing (or sitting) are older
folks whose general health is so good that weight is irrelevant. A second pos-
sibility is that individual human beings really are individuals with unique bun-
dles of genes and possibilities. Trying to make these unique individuals fit
into strict, predictable categories is like trying to map the stars in the sky. It
works, but only up to a point.
For example, the experts who invented BMI admit that its value in predicting
weight-related health risks depends to some extent on age. In your 30s, a
lower BMI is clearly linked to better health. In your 70s (and later), no con-
vincing evidence supports the idea that BMI and/or weight itself makes a 
difference. In fact, some recent studies suggest that a higher BMI (below the
127
Chapter 7: Weighing Weight’s Weight on Cholesterol

obesity mark, of course) is protective for women of a certain age. In between,
the relationship between BMI — or weight — and health is, well, in between —
more important early on, less important later in life.
The inescapable conclusion? Human beings are more diverse and compli-
cated than any weight and health charts. Case closed.

egular exercise is such an important part of a heart-healthy lifestyle that
the authors of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 (U.S. Depart-
ments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services) put “Physical Activity”
right before the info on every single type of food a healthy diet is likely to

According to the American Heart Association, exercise can alter your choles-
terol levels, pushing up your HDLs (the “good” cholesterol) and pushing
down the LDLs (the “bad” cholesterol). In other words, moving your bod is
good for your heart.
This chapter presents tips on how to use exercise to help with controlling
your cholesterol. Hey, isn’t that the title of this book? You bet.
Sweating the Definition: Exercise
Do you know what exercise is? That isn’t a trick question — really. When
many people hear the word exercise, they think of things such as 
professional-level sports, a 10-mile run, or a hop-’til-you-drop celebrity work-
out. But in reality, exercise is nothing more than simple movement.

If you’re not training for the Olympics, your favorite sport — golf, tennis, or
even ping-pong — is good exercise. No, dusting the house is not good exer-
cise, but if you get down on your knees and really scrub the floor or, as the
American Heart Association (AHA) suggests, “vacuum vigorously,” that
counts. (You can even clean to music to get a good rhythm going.)
Walking is also good exercise. No, let me revise that: Walking is a great exer-
cise that moves virtually every part of your body. (Swing those arms! Shift
those eyes from right to left! Turn that head!)
Of course, you may prefer riding a stationary bike in front of the TV, jogging a
mile before or after work, dancing, mowing the lawn, or raking leaves — all of
which come with the AHA seal of approval (as long as your doctor gives the
green light).
You can estimate how effective an exercise is in two ways:
 By counting the calories you use up
 By counting your heartbeats while you’re doing the exercise
Counting calories
The more calories an exercise consumes, the harder you’re working. Table 8-1
classifies very light, light, moderate, and heavy activity by calorie count.
Table 8-2 tells you approximately how many calories you burn by engaging in
some specific activities for either 15 minutes or one hour.
The numbers in the first chart come from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
I found the numbers in the second chart in Fitness For Dummies, 3rd Edition,
by Suzanne Schlosberg and Liz Neporent (Wiley), a terrific book for recover-
ing couch potatoes who can’t tell a rowing machine from a washing machine.

Chapter 8: Exercising Options to Control Your Cholesterol

Counting heartbeats
Aerobic, as in “aerobic exercise,” means “with air.” An aerobic exercise is an
exercise that forces you to use oxygen, challenging your heart to beat faster
and your lungs to breathe more deeply.
Exercises that use your big muscles — the ones in your legs, back, and chest —
are the ones most likely to be aerobic. Walking, running, swimming, bicycling,
and climbing up (not down) stairs are all aerobic exercises. When you do
these exercises, your heartbeat begins to speed up. That’s good.
How fast should your heart be beating during exercise? Grab a piece of paper
and a pencil and follow these three steps to find your “target range” for how
fast your heart should beat while you’re exercising:
1. Subtract your age from 220.
The number you get is your estimated maximum heart rate. For example,
Ellen is 27 years old. 220 – 27 = 193 (which means 193 beats per minute).
2. Divide that number by 2.
The number you get is the low point for your “target range.” In Ellen’s
case, 193÷2 = 96.5. Oh, call it 97. The low point for Ellen’s target range is
97 beats per minute. If her heart is thumping out 97 beats per minute,
she knows she’s not exerting herself to her fullest potential.
3. Multiply the original number by 0.85.
The number you get is the top boundary for your “target rate.” In Ellen’s
case, 193 × 0.85 = 165. If her heartbeat hits 165 beats per minute while
she’s working out, man, she knows she’s working out! If it goes higher
than 165, she needs to slow it down.
To burn fat and receive heart-healthy benefits from exercising, you must
reach — and hold — your personal target heartbeat range for at least 30 
minutes, at least three times a week. (But only after checking in with your
doctor.)
Pairing Exercise and . . .
Everybody knows that exercise makes your heart healthy. But here’s a fact to
make it beat a bit faster: Regular exercise — even as little as a brisk 30-minute
walk several times a week — also improves your cholesterol profile.
132
Part III: Leading a Cholesterol-Lowering Lifestyle 

How about that? The same exercise regimen that strengthens your heart will
 Lower your total cholesterol
 Lower your low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) — the “bad” fat-and-protein
particles that ferry cholesterol into your arteries
 Raise your high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) — the “good” fat-and-protein
particles that carry cholesterol out of your body
How does exercise do all this good stuff? Nobody knows for sure. It may have
something to do with exercise enabling your heart to pump extra oxygen-
toting blood out into your body. Or it may not.
Either way, why look a gift horse — carrying lower total cholesterol, lower
LDLs, and higher HDLs — in the mouth? Especially when he’s packing even
more good stuff in his saddlebags (and getting rid of yours), such as the pos-
sibility that exercise may change your arteries so that they’re less suscepti-
ble to cholesterol damage.
CRP
C-reactive protein (CRP) — discussed in detail in Chapter 3 — is a compound
in your blood that medical folks regard as an indicator of otherwise-invisible
arterial inflammation.
Inflamed arteries have rough interior surfaces with many little nooks and
crannies that may snag cholesterol particles as they float by. If that happens,
the snagged cholesterol attracts other particles, eventually building the kind
of plaque that blocks the artery and leads to a heart attack.
In 2002, data from a six-year study of 128 males in Finland ages 50 to 60 showed
that those who engaged in even mild exercise, such as walking, reduced their
CRP levels by 16 percent, suggesting that their arteries were healthier than
before they began exercising.
By the way, the change even occurred in men who have a gene that increases
their risk of blood clots.
Blood pressure
Blood pressure is the term used to describe the force exerted by your heart
when it pushes blood out into your arteries. If your arteries are narrowed in
any way, your heart must work harder to get blood out.
133
Chapter 8: Exercising Options to Control Your Cholesterol

Exercise relaxes and dilates your blood vessels, lowering your risk of high
blood pressure. Some research has suggested that exercise also widens blood
vessels enough to allow a stray piece of cholesterol gunk to float on through
rather than block the artery. Only a suggestion, but sure sounds good!
Triglycerides
Triglycerides are the most common fats found in food and the most common
fats circulating through your blood. Having high triglyceride levels raises
your risk of heart attack. Exercise lowers triglycerides, thus lowering your
risk of heart attack. To find out more about triglycerides, check out Chapter 2.
Weight control
If you’re overweight, losing weight makes you look and feel better. It also
lowers your total cholesterol and raises your HDLs.
Regular exercise is such an efficient weight loss technique that the American
Society of Bariatric Physicians (the group of fine folks who treat weight disor-
ders) considers a regular exercise plan the number one predictor for long-
term weight stability.
In other words, you can lose weight by cutting calories, but according to the
bariatric docs, you’ll lose pounds faster and keep them off longer if you 
exercise.
Exercise can also change your body shape — and not just by making your
muscles bulge. For example, exercise can transform a person’s “fruit” shape
from the round-in-the middle “apple” shape known to carry a higher risk of
heart attack to a slimmer, trimmer . . . banana? Carrot? No, wait. That’s a veg-
etable. Well, you get the idea.
Your body
If you need a refresher course on the whole-body health benefits of exercise,
stick around for the next few paragraphs. The short version is
 Exercise builds muscle.
 Your heart is a muscle.
 Exercise strengthens your heart.
134
Part III: Leading a Cholesterol-Lowering Lifestyle 

When you exercise, your heart pumps out more blood. More blood means
more oxygen to every part of your body. More oxygen means healthier body
tissues. Keep exercising. Your heart is only one of the organs and systems
that benefits from regular exercise.
Exercise also strengthens bones, revs up your brain, keeps your digestive
system moving along, sharpens your immune system, and improves your
mood.
To save time (yours) and space (the publisher’s), I’ve put all this good stuff
into Table 8-3, which lists the various ways in which a regular exercise pro-
gram tunes up your body and mind.

Riding the Stationary 
Bike into the Sunset
Did you wake up this morning and decide it’s time to exercise? Well, don’t just
do something. Sit there! Yes, you heard me right. Untie your running shoes.
Unzip your warm-up jacket. Brew yourself a cup of tea, coffee, or whatever,
and relax in your favorite armchair while you carefully consider how to put
together an exercise program that fits your individual needs.
Just keep in mind that you want to choose an exercise (or exercises) that
works your muscles. Yoga, for example, is a wonderful relaxation technique,
but — sorry about this — it won’t jump-start your heart or raise your HDLs.
The Web is totally jam-packed with special sites that offer balanced advice on
exercise and its billions of benefits — well maybe not that many — for your
body. To save you hours of surfing time, expand your universe by typing
exercise sites into the search box of any search engine. Doing this often
brings up one site with links to many other sites. How handy!
Table 8-4 shows several useful exercise and health sites. Wait! Did I mention
you should always check with your own doctor before starting an exercise
program? I think I did, but now I’m sure. It never hurts to be sure.

Burning the midnight bulb
Does thinking about an exercise program use
up energy? Yes, but not as much as you may
imagine. To solve a crossword puzzle — or
write a chapter of this book — the average
brain uses about one calorie every four minutes.
That’s only one-third of the amount of energy
needed to keep a 60-watt bulb burning for the
same length of time.
Does that mean that even really smart people are
pretty dim bulbs? Sorry, I couldn’t resist that one.

Checking with your medical mechanic
You wouldn’t take your car out for a 3,000-mile trip without a tune-up would
you? For your body, starting a new exercise program is the equivalent of that
multi-mile trip.
The first step on the way to a healthful exercise regimen should be an
appointment with your doctor so he can run a basic body check. He may
even want to do a stress test.
This caution clearly applies to anyone who’s already had a heart attack. But
it’s also recommended for people who’ve never had even the slightest hint of
heart trouble. Even if you are (or think you are) a healthy young person, this
is one time when it’s definitely better to be safe than sorry.
Exercise is hard work, and you want to be sure your body can handle it with-
out folding on you. Call your doctor first. No exceptions!
If you skipped this all-important step and headed straight for a health club or
gym, turn right around and walk out of any facility that lets you sign up for an
exercise program without first checking your vital signs.
Setting yourself up for success
An exercise program should make you feel good about the program and about
yourself. If you choose a regimen that’s too strenuous, you’re apt to quit in the
middle. Bummer.
Your exercise goal is to rev up your body and lower your cholesterol, not
wear yourself to a frazzle in an unsuccessful attempt to qualify for the
Olympic couch-potato-turned-pro-athlete team.
In other words, it’s A-okay to settle for the warm and fuzzy sense of well-
being you get by stretching your muscles while walking a mile, riding a 
stationary bike, or once in a while picking up the pace to jog (if you really
want to that is). 
137
Chapter 8: Exercising Options to Control Your Cholesterol

Here are a few helpful hints:
 Have realistic expectations. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and that new,
fabulously healthy, lower-cholesterol body of yours won’t be either.
• Start small: If you’ve been sedentary for the last 15 years, you
shouldn’t expect to sprint 3 miles a day out of the gate. Walk first
and work up to a run; start with 1 mile and work your way up to
the 3-mile plan.
• Give yourself time: Positive changes in your body won’t pop up
overnight. Give yourself at least six months of effort to see notice-
able change.
 Exercise some days, not every day. You intend to wake up every morn-
ing at 5 a.m. and jog? Who — I mean whom — are you kidding? Set a
more realistic goal of a jog every other day, and you’re more likely to
stick to the schedule. By the way, the three-times-a-week rule comes
from the American Heart Association. For the AHA — and you — three
times can be the charm.
 Reward yourself. But not with a huge stack of pancakes drizzled in
syrup when you get back from your morning run. Try other rewards like
a new article of clothing, a plant, or a CD. If you prefer to indulge in food
rewards, do so less often.
Choosing something you like
As the AHA puts it, choose “activities that are fun, not exhausting.” If you
hate football, loathe jogging, despise aerobics, and can’t stand to get your
hair wet in a pool, you won’t make it past the first week with an exercise 
regimen that includes these activities.
In other words, your aim is to find some kind of movement you actually 
enjoy — or at least one that fits into your normal daily routine. No one can
tell you exactly what that exercise is — you know what you enjoy. What I can
share with you is the assurance that anything that moves your muscles bene-
fits your body.
If everything else fails to pass your “I like that” test, there’s always walking
(briskly, that is).
Here are a few ideas to set the wheels in motion:
 Biking (streets, parks, hills, or flats)
 Hiking (meadows or mountains, doesn’t matter)
 Working out along with a TV fitness guru — start slow, work up
138
Part III: Leading a Cholesterol-Lowering Lifestyle 

Sticking to a schedule
To get the most from your exercise, follow a consistent regimen of moderately
intense movement for at least 30 minutes a day five days a week, if possible.
Okay, okay, three days a week. As I said before, the AHA says three days 
is okay, and even a recovering couch potato can remember Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday. Try it: Monday — Wednesday — Friday. See?
Did you know that you don’t have to do all your exercise at once? You can
break it up into two or three sessions during the day. For example, suppose
you drive to work or take public transportation. Instead of driving all the way
to the front door, park your car 15 minutes away from work and walk. Or get
off the bus or train at a stop 15 minutes before your final destination and,
yes, walk. Doing that twice a day equals (can you believe it?) 30 minutes of
moderate-intensity exercise.
Don’t ya just love it when things work out the way they’re supposed to?
No pain, no gain? No way
“No pain, no gain” is an out-of-date, never-was-right slogan that deserves a
decent burial once and for all. Pain means injury. Injury is bad for the body.
Yes, the pros play with problems — after all, they’re playing for millions (dol-
lars, not fans) — but that’s why so many of them end up hobbling around at a
really tender age.
Avoid anything that requires you to twist yourself into a pretzel or perform
activities that feel uncomfortable. True, stretching muscles that haven’t
moved in heaven knows how long can leave you with some soreness, but if
your exercise leaves you hobbling, you’re doing something wrong. This book
is Controlling Cholesterol For Dummies, not Fitness For Dummies, so my best
advice is that you seek guidance from a professional trainer or check out
Fitness For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Suzanne Schlosberg and Liz Neporent
(Wiley), which also lays out rules for finding a trainer. Think of it as a two-fer
bargain — and safe, sane, and sensible besides.
Rating an exercise program or gym
How can you tell if a fitness program or plan or video is right for you? That’s
easy. The program fits your needs, which means
 It fits into your schedule (rather than forcing you to shift your life
around to accommodate it).
139
Chapter 8: Exercising Options to Control Your Cholesterol

 You’re comfortable with the exercise expertise required.
 The price is right.
Here are some examples of what can work for you:
 Group programs, such as an exercise class at the local YMCA/YWCA, are
great for people with no talent as self-starters. They’re not so great for
people who hate to play follow the leader.
 Individual trainers are great for folks who hate to leave the house (and
can afford the trainer). They’re not so great for people who enjoy work-
ing out in the company of others.
 Videotapes are a delight! You get to sit and watch someone else work up
a sweat on TV. No, wait, that’s not how it’s supposed to work. If that’s
what you’re doing, join a group or get a trainer. Of course, using a tape
properly gives you the freedom to exercise at your own speed and on
your own schedule.
If you go the videotape route, remember that being a TV sitcom star may not
be the best training in the world for handling other people’s bodies. Any
videotape you choose should have guides to exercise and skill levels printed
on the box. A credit for an expert adviser is also good.
As for gyms and health clubs: No matter what type of program you choose,
be sure to check out the instructor by taking in the diplomas on the wall.
Preferably, your exercise guru should have a four-year college degree in exer-
cise science or a related field.
Certification from a recognized group for fitness professionals such as these
is also a really, really good recommendation:
 American Council on Exercise (ACE)
 American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)
 National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM)
 National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA)
Then, after you have your ducks in a row, start your engines. You may be
mixing metaphors, but you’ll also be benefiting your heart — and optimizing
your cholesterol. Pretty good, all around.

Role in High Cholesterol
In This Chapter

 Noting the connections between smoking and cholesterol
 Identifying the typical smoker
 Finding ways to break the habit
C
onsider this chapter, in fact, this entire book, a nonsmoking area. In fact,
close your eyes and visualize little signs up all over the virtual walls
explaining what’s wrong with tolerating tobacco, how tobacco interacts with
cholesterol, and showing how to quit, right now. Then think about how this
will make your healthful life style even more so. 
Enumerating Smoking’s Health Hazards
Puffing on a lit tobacco stick, that is, inhaling smoke from burning, dead
leaves produces the following reactions in your body:
 Raises the level of carbon monoxide in your blood, which reduces the
amount of life-giving oxygen
 Injures the lining of your blood vessels
 Constricts arteries that may already be narrowed by cholesterol plaque
 Heightens your risk of high blood pressure
 Reduces the amount of blood carrying oxygen to your body tissues
 Makes it more likely that your blood will clot
 Increases your risk of sudden cardiac death, a genuinely catastrophic
moment when, without warning, your heart may stop beating forever

Not to mention, smoking increases your risk of these forms of cancer:
 Bladder
 Esophagus (throat)
 Lungs
 Pancreas
And, if that’s not enough to get to you thinking, how about this: Smoking also
destroys your good looks by promoting facial wrinkles.
But did you notice that this list of bad stuff smoking can do to your body is
incomplete? Look carefully. Something is missing. What can it be? Surely you
jest. It’s smoking’s ability to upset your cholesterol — specifically your “bad”
cholesterol.
Burning up the cholesterol charts
The relationship between smoking and cholesterol is straightforward. Over
time, lighting up and inhaling all those deep, “flavorful” breaths will
 Increase your total cholesterol levels.
 Decrease the level of your high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), the “good”
cholesterol described in detail in Chapters 2 and 3 of this book.
 Hasten the buildup of cholesterol plaque on damaged blood-vessel walls.
 Constrict your blood vessels, increasing the risk that a passing clump of
cholesterol may block blood flow.
 Increase the level of triglycerides in your blood, another risk factor for
heart attacks (check out Chapter 2).
 Double your risk of heart attack, regardless of your cholesterol level.
That last point deserves serious attention, so I’ve asked my editor to print it
in boldface type, and doggone if she didn’t do it!
Although many studies demonstrate a relationship between smoking and
heart disease, many smokers are convinced that having a low cholesterol
level reduces their risk of smoking-related heart disease. They’re wrong. Low
cholesterol levels don’t protect smokers from heart disease. I can say this
with impunity because I’ve read the results of the Korea Medical Insurance
Company Study, the first effort to pin down a relationship between smoking,
cholesterol levels, and the risk of heart attack. (Check out the “East Asia’s
heart disease” sidebar in this chapter.) Do I do my homework, or what?
142
Part III: Leading a Cholesterol-Lowering Lifestyle 

Getting a bad deal on secondhand smoke
As if your own smoking weren’t bad enough for your body, somebody else’s
smoking can also be hazardous to your health.
Secondhand smoke, also known as environmental tobacco smoke, isn’t some-
thing you buy in a secondhand store. It’s the smoke you inhale from other
people’s cigarettes, pipes, or cigars and from the air that people breathe out
while they’re smoking.
Like all tobacco smoke, this recycled version contains at least 250 toxic
chemicals including at least 50 known carcinogens, which is why, in 2006, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued yet another warning
on secondhand smoke. For the umpteenth time, the CDC repeated that expo-
sure to secondhand smoke increases the risk of heart disease by 25 to 30 
percent in adult nonsmokers and increases their risk of lung cancer by 20 to
30 percent.
As for the effect on kids, don’t ask. No, do ask.
143
Chapter 9: Weeding Out Tobacco’s Role in High Cholesterol
East Asia’s heart disease
East Asia is a part of the world that’s best known
for gorgeous scenery and scrumptious food. But
it’s also known for having a large population of
smokers and a rate of heart disease that’s now
among the highest in the world. The confusing
part of this equation has been that East Asians
have a high risk of heart attack even though they
generally have low cholesterol levels. A good
guess to clear up this confusion may be that their
love of smoking is an independent risk factor
against which low cholesterol offers no protec-
tion. And by golly, that’s exactly what turned up in
data from the 10-year, 106,745-man Korea
Medical Insurance Corporation Study, named for
the volunteers who were all Korean men with
insurance policies from the Korea Medical
Insurance Corporation.
Based on the number of men who were either
hospitalized or died from heart attack or stroke
during the study, the researchers found that
smoking significantly increased the risk of heart
attack and stroke. Even among men with very
low cholesterol levels, smokers had a risk of
heart attack and stroke that was 330 percent
higher than that of nonsmokers.
Conclusion? As reported in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, “This study
demonstrates that . . . a low cholesterol level
confers no protective benefit against smoking-
related atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.”
Translation: Low cholesterol levels provide no
protection for smokers against heart disease
caused by smoking.

Kids and secondhand smoke
If you smoke, children in the room smoke, too. No, they don’t actually light
up, but they do breathe the same air you do, so if you exhale smoke into the
air, they breathe it into their lungs. In fact, the American Heart Association
states that 43 percent of all American kids between the ages of 2 months and
11 years are exposed to secondhand smoke at home.
While their lungs are still developing, smoke from other people’s burning
tobacco may slow the normal rate of lung development in children and
increase a child’s risk of 
 Eye, nose, and throat irritations
 Middle ear infections
 Reduced lung functions
 Respiratory irritations (cough, phlegm, and wheezing)
 Respiratory tract infections (pneumonia and bronchitis)
 Worsened asthma (or new cases)
Clearing the air
Is the word getting out? You bet. 
No-smoking-in-public-spaces laws to ban smoking in offices, hotels, restau-
rants, and other indoor spaces are now commonplace in the United States.
And by summer 2007, American cities had passed at least 1,124 laws banning
smoking outdoors in places such as amusement parks, zoos (including the
National Zoo in Washington D.C.), beaches (no more burying your butts in
the sand), golf courses, and — get this one — cemeteries.
Across the Atlantic, in 2004, Ireland became the first European country to ban
smoking in all workplaces, including the legendary Irish pubs. Sweden and
Italy soon followed suit, and then came the big one: France.
In 2007, the French banned smoking in public practically everywhere: airports,
railway stations, hospitals, schools, shops, offices, and so on. Today, in Paris,
where people practically invented serious, sexy smoking, many restaurants
and most cafes still permit your pampered pooch to dine along with you, but
may now ban les cigarettes, which is French for small cigars — cigarettes. 
Sacre bleu! But no smoke-blue air.

Identifying the Smokers
Despite all the terrible things that are known about smoking, including its
effects on cholesterol levels and the consequent risk of heart disease, many
people continue to puff away. 
You may wonder who these smokers are. Well, wonder no more: The hard-
working statisticians at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) have crunched the 
numbers and come up with figures to identify U.S. smokers by age, gender,
ethnicity, and level of education. It’s a hard job, but somebody had to do it.
Gender and ethnicity
The percentage of American men who smoke is slightly higher than the per-
centage of American women who smoke, perhaps because some women still
cling to the discredited idea that women are at lower risk of tobacco-related
lung cancer. Silly girls.
When it comes to ethnicity, there are distinct differences among Americans.
Table 9-1 shows who is more likely to light up.

Getting older, getting smarter
When you count smokers, age matters. So do educational levels. According to
the CDC, more than 2,000 new smokers younger than the age of 18 light up
every day for the first time. That’s the bad news.

The good news is that as Americans get older, they’re less likely to smoke.
Higher levels of education also seem to reduce the likelihood that people will
smoke. Maybe the message of Table 9-2 is that as Americans get older (and
smarter), they really do get wiser. At least when it comes to smoking.

Poison control
Because smoking delivers relatively small
amounts of nicotine to the body, cases of nico-
tine poisoning are rare, if not unknown, among
smokers. But eating one cigarette, three ciga-
rette butts, one pinch of chewing tobacco, or any
tobacco-replacement medication, such as that
found in nicotine gums or patches, is hazardous
for an infant, small child, or pet.
Nicotine poisoning is a medical emergency that
requires immediate medical assistance! Check
with your local poison control center before
administering any therapy. The possibility of your
tobacco use harming another person in this way
is just one more reason to seriously consider the
information contained in the “Breaking the
Habit” section in this chapter.

Where you live in the United States says a lot about whether you’re likely to
be a smoker. According to the CDC:
 In 2005, the percentage of adults who smoke ranged from a high of 28.7
percent in Kentucky and 27.3 percent in Indiana all the way down to a
low of 11.5 percent in Utah.
 For men, the states with the highest percentages of smokers were
Kentucky (30.6 percent), Indiana (29.7 percent), and Alabama (28.5 
percent). Lowest? Utah, again, at 13.7 percent.
 More women smoke in Kentucky (26.9 percent), West Virginia (26 per-
cent), and Indiana (25.1 percent). Fewer light up in good old Utah (9.3
percent).
What makes the difference? Must be something in the air.

map of the United States in 2005 with the states ranked according to the

Breaking the Habit
A smoker’s risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) rises in direct relationship
to the number of cigarettes he or she smokes each day:
 Smokers who quit have only half the CAD risk of people who keep 
smoking. 
 People who quit after having coronary artery bypass surgery or a heart
attack, fairly good signals that it’s time to quit, lower their risk of early
death. 
 Quitting decreases the likelihood of illness and the risk of death for
people with atherosclerosis (cholesterol buildup) in arteries other than
those that supply the heart and brain.
Ending your relationship with tobacco isn’t a Sunday walk in the park. Nicotine
is such a rewarding drug that leaving it behind takes time and effort — a lot of
time and effort in many cases. People often feel guilty when their first attempt
at breaking the habit isn’t totally successful. That’s nonsense!
Not quitting forever the first time you try to stop smoking is neither a crime
nor a moral failure. In fact, not making it the first ten or twenty times isn’t the
end of the world. Every time you stop smoking, you keep your body free of
tobacco smoke for hours, days, or weeks. Consider that an accomplishment
to celebrate. In the end, the only important thing is the end of smoking.
Eventually, you’ll get there.
But from the moment you stop (for as long as you stop), your body benefits.
Table 9-3 shows exactly how.

Chapter 9: Weeding Out Tobacco’s Role in High Cholesterol
Smoking with the enemy
Nicotine is a naturally-occurring phytochemi-
cal (phyto = plant) named for Jean Nicot, a 16th-
century French ambassador to Portugal who
sent a gift of tobacco seeds to Catherine de’
Medici, queen mother of France, along with a
glowing description of the plant’s ability to cure
practically every illness. Eventually, the tobacco
plant was christened with the genus Nicotiana
in his honor.
In small doses, nicotine is a stimulant that revs
up the autonomic nervous system — nerves
that control involuntary body functions, such as
heartbeat, breathing, and the expansion of
blood vessels. Cigarette smokers who inhale
tobacco smoke into their lungs get a virtually
instantaneous nicotine hit. Within ten seconds
after puffing, they feel the effects of nicotine in
their brains. (Cigar and pipe smokers rarely
inhale, so the nicotine they get is absorbed rel-
atively slowly through the mucous membrane
lining of the mouth.)
In the brain, nicotine activates natural chemi-
cals called neurotransmitters that enable brain
cells to fire pleasure messages back and forth
among themselves. Alas, the effect fades in a
few minutes. To maintain the high, a smoker
must take a second puff, and then a third, and
so on throughout the day. Pretty soon, another
three-pack-a-day habit is born.
But addiction isn’t nicotine’s only hazard to your
health. In large doses, nicotine is a poison that
can overload and shut down vital body systems,
producing symptoms such as
 Confusion, agitation, and depression
 Convulsions, coma, and death
 Elevated blood pressure
 Gastrointestinal upset
 Muscle spasms and weakness
 Rapid heartbeat
 Respiratory problems
Is this really something that you want to wel-
come into your life?

Choosing How to Quit
When you decide to quit — right now would be a really good time — you
have four basic ways to go:
 You can just quit.
 You can quit with the help of medication.
 You can quit with the help of a behavior-modification program.
 You can try one method from column A, one from column B, and one from
column C — in other words, you can take the smorgasbord approach.
The good points and bad points of each of these methods are described in
the following sections.
Quitting cold turkey
I decided to stop smoking when my habit reached three packs a day and
everything — my apartment, my clothes, my hair — smelled like dead 
cigarettes.
As a highly competitive, Type A person, I couldn’t stand the thought of being
beaten by a paper tube filled with crumbled leaves. Naturally, when I decided
to quit, I took the cold-turkey route. The first six weeks weren’t pleasant. I
really, really wanted a cigarette, and it was really, really hard not to give in 
to my craving. Worse yet, I was so used to lighting up when I typed that I
couldn’t write a coherent sentence for weeks. Luckily, my editors understood
and supported my desire to quit. To make the situation bearable, I made
some concessions to reality. You may also find them useful.
Concession #1: Stop smoking, but don’t throw out the cigarettes
An about-to-be-ex-smoker’s worst nightmare is waking up at 4 a.m. without 
a cig in the house. At that point, resolve dissolves during a frantic search
through every possible drawer and coat pocket in the house. Without the
comforting thought that a cigarette is close at hand, should it be necessary,
the willpower-challenged sort of ex-smoker may succumb to panic and rush
to the corner gas station to buy — you guessed it — cigarettes!
To keep my own panic in check, I kept a pack of cigarettes in my purse for
about two years, and I kept a pack in the back of my desk drawer for what
150
Part III: Leading a Cholesterol-Lowering Lifestyle 

turned out to be seven years. When I found the withered cigarettes by acci-
dent, seven years after I had stopped smoking, I was able toss them in the
trash without a second’s hesitation.
Concession #2: Don’t promise more than you can deliver
When coworkers stopped at my office door to say, “Hey, I hear you’ve stopped
smoking,” I would grin like a Cheshire cat and purr, “Well, at least for this
morning,” or “this afternoon,” or whatever.
A lot of people consider this weak-willed. I call it telling the truth. I knew, for
example, that I could make it through an hour, and then four hours, and then
a morning, and then an afternoon, and then a day. But I really didn’t know
what would happen after these increasingly longer periods of smoke-free
time. By not saying “Never!” to the possibility of smoking again, I avoided 
setting myself up for a fall.
Concession #3: Don’t be a nag
Ex-smokers can be very annoying. It’s not their business if someone else
wants to muck up his lungs or stink up her clothes. After you decide to stop
smoking, let other people come to the same conclusion on their own. And
don’t give up your smoking friends. The funny thing is that smokers may
smell bad, but they’re often looser and more fun than nonsmokers.
Concession #4: Don’t sweat the small, guilty pleasures
Once in a while, when we’re out walking, my husband and I get a whiff of a
pipe or a cigar. Our eyes sparkle. Our step quickens. And we follow that
smoker for a couple of blocks, remembering. But we’ve never lit up — so 
far (see Concession #2).
151
Chapter 9: Weeding Out Tobacco’s Role in High Cholesterol
Letting loose
After I stopped smoking, it was only a matter of
time until my husband gave into my nagging. (I
didn’t mean you shouldn’t nag your loved ones;
just leave strangers alone.) Several years later,
we received an assignment to write about a
weekend at a honeymoon hotel. In the dining
room, the seating plan was tables for eight. On
the first night, the only open seats were at a
smoking table. We agreed to sit there, and we
had such a great time that we kept going back to
sit with the smokers. (No, we didn’t smoke.)
The last morning, there were no open seats at
our regular table, so we sat with the ex-smokers.
What pills! They kept grabbing the butter and
wouldn’t let us have it. Frankly, a discreet
smoker’s cough would’ve been more welcome.

Applying effective medicines
For some people, the path to a smoke-free nirvana runs through a prescrip-
tion, either for the antidepressant medication bupropion (formerly known as
Wellbutrin; now known as Zyban) or the new nicotine-blocker varenicline
(Chantix).
Anti-smoking medicine #1: Buproprion
In several well-controlled studies, buproprion (Zyban) alone, with no counsel-
ing or other therapy, helped nearly 50 percent of the people who took it stay
smoke free for seven weeks and aided roughly 23 percent of people in avoid-
ing cigarettes for at least a year. These figures may not sound all that impres-
sive, until you hear that only 4 to 7 percent of smokers who try to quit on
their own are able to make it for a full year without cigarettes. As a result, in
1997, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved buproprion as a
stop-smoking aid.
Buproprion does have some potential adverse effects: upset stomach, head-
ache, insomnia, irritability, and seizures in people with a history of seizure
disorders. But the medicine also has an interesting benefit in addition to its
ability to diminish cravings for a smoke. Smokers who kick the habit often
gain weight in the process, but buproprion actually produces a slight weight
loss. No smoking, no weight gain, and it’s covered by insurance? Glory, glory!
Anti-smoking medicine #2: Varenicline
When you smoke, the nicotine in your tobacco hooks onto receptors in your
brain that tell the brain to release dopamine, a natural mood elevator. The
newest anti-smoking med, varenicline (Chantix), approved by the FDA in the
spring of 2006, is a chemical that clicks into place on these brain receptors,
blocking nicotine so that smoking fails to produce its usual “high.” In double-
blind studies (studies in which neither the researchers nor the subjects know
what they are getting), varenicline enabled 44 percent of people who had
been smokers for as long as 24 years to quit smoking after 12 weeks. 
The most common side effects of varenicline are gastric upset (nausea, vom-
iting, intestinal gas, and constipation) and sleep disturbance (frequent
waking and vivid dreams). The drug has not been approved for women who
are pregnant, plan to be pregnant, or are nursing. In addition, this medicine
may interact with anticoagulants (“blood thinners”), asthma medication, and
insulin.

Get your nicotine here!
Smoking is both a chemical addiction and a psychological habit. By stopping
smoking, you immediately break the psychological habit of putting a cigarette
in your mouth. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products help deal with
the chemical addiction by delivering small doses of nicotine to your blood-
stream to make up for what you give up when you quit cigarettes. They also
help reduce your cig cravings by lessening common withdrawal symptoms
such as irritability, headache, sleep disturbances, and fatigue. 
Most cigarettes sold in the United States contain 10 milligrams (mg) of nico-
tine each, delivering about 1 to 2 mg of nicotine per smoked cigarette — yes,
you lose some nicotine because the cigarette burns down between puffs. The
best way to use all nicotine replacements is to start at a dose equivalent to
the number of cigarettes you smoke a day, and over each subsequent month,
reduce the amount you use daily by either going to a lower concentration or
fewer ingestions of nicotine. NRTs are often most successful when taken
along with buproprion.
To get the best results from a NRT, start using your preferred method as soon
as you quit smoking. You shouldn’t use any NRT for longer than three months.
Some people find these products incredibly effective when used on their own;
others may need the extra help that can come from counseling or participat-
ing in a smoking-cessation program with other people. And always check with
your doctor before starting to use these products. Like all medicines, they
(the NRTs) do have potential side effects and interactions.
Nicotine chewing gums
You don’t need a prescription to buy nicotine-replacement chewing gum, but
you do need to be 18 or older. The manufacturers’ directions usually tell you
to start with one tablet per hour. If you smoked fewer than 24 cigarettes a
day, the 2-mg gum should be fine; people who smoked more may need the 
4-mg dose. To get the most bang from your gum, avoid food and beverages
for 15 minutes before chewing. (Some foods and beverages reduce the gum’s
effect.)
If necessary, you can take an additional piece to tamp down a sudden craving,
but you shouldn’t use more than 30 pieces of gum a day. And do remember to
follow the directions when chewing the gum. You stick the wad between your
lip and gum so that the nicotine makes its way into your system. If you forget
to do that, the gum may make you queasy.
153
Chapter 9: Weeding Out Tobacco’s Role in High Cholesterol

Transdermal patches
The nicotine patch is a medical device that delivers a constant amount of
nicotine through your skin. Nicotine patches come in two versions: a 16-hour
patch that you wear while you’re awake and a 24-hour patch for people who
wake up craving a cigarette. The patch, which started life as a prescription
drug, is now available over the counter. 
But it’s always a good idea to check with your doctor before using it because,
as the American Lung Association notes, potential side effects may include
 Headache, dizziness, and blurred vision
 Itchy or burning skin
 Sleep disturbance (vivid dreams)
 Upset stomach and diarrhea
When you remove your nicotine patch, dispose of it carefully and as directed.
(The package comes with storage space for used patches.) Remember:
Nicotine is a poison. The amount of nicotine in your discarded patches may
be lethal for pets and small children.
Inhalers
The nicotine inhaler is a plastic cylinder that looks like a cigarette, but instead
of tobacco, it contains a pressurized cartridge filled with nicotine mist. When
you puff on the inhaler, the nicotine mist is absorbed through the mucous
membrane lining your mouth and throat.
The inhaler is a prescription product, with a maximum dose of six cartridges
a day. Ask your doctor about the inhaler’s risks and benefits, and be absolutely
sure to read the instructions carefully before using this device. 
Nasal sprays
You can take two spritzes from this pump bottle, one in each nostril, up to
five times an hour. The spray delivers nicotine straight to the mucous mem-
brane lining your nose, which lets the nicotine zip into your bloodstream
faster than it does with gums, patches, or inhalers.
Like the inhaler, the spray is a prescription product. And, as with all nicotine-
replacement therapies, you should read the patient insert to check out the
possible side effects and drug interactions.
Comparing the alternatives 
Table 9-4 briefly reviews the different types of nicotine-replacement products.
All are available as generics and as brand-name meds. As with most drugs,
you can count on the generics being equally effective at a lower price.

Modifying your behavior
When you decide to quit smoking, behavior modification programs can be a
valuable tool in teaching you how to avoid or ignore the emotional and physi-
cal triggers, such as anxiety or nicotine cravings, that tell you to light up.
Here are some suggestions:
 You can get your behavior-modification advice from a stop-smoking clinic
or a stop-smoking book. As with every other step associated with 
quitting smoking, the best solution is the one that works for you. 
For information about behavior-modification programs to help you quit
smoking — and even good books on how to toss the tobacco — visit the
American Lung Association (ALA) Web site at www.lungusa.org. The
ALA has a ton of information to help you declare freedom from smoking.
 Don’t want to go through ALA? No problem. You can also call your local
hospital, YMCA, or YWCA. At least one of these organizations is almost
guaranteed to have a low-cost or maybe even free smoking-cessation
program.
Hypnosis and acupuncture
Think of hypnosis and acupuncture therapies as effortless behavior modifica-
tion. Someone else does the work — waving a magic hypnosis wand or stick-
ing skinny needles in various parts of your body — and you reap the benefits. 
Many hospitals have trained professional hypnotists and acupuncturists on
staff, so one path to a reliable practitioner is through your doctor or local
hospital.
155
Chapter 9: Weeding Out Tobacco’s Role in High Cholesterol

Although no evidence shows that either hypnosis or acupuncture is any 
more effective at ending your smoking habit than the other stop-smoking
therapies, both approaches do turn some smokers into ex-smokers. If you’re
one of those people, hooray! If not, just pack up your bags and move on to
another method. Just remember — no quitting on your quitting. Okay?
Future perfect
Today’s stop-smoking techniques aren’t perfect, so smarties around the world
are always on the lookout for better ways to break the habit. This section
covers two interesting works-in-progress.
Eating your way out of the cigarette pack
Believe it or not, in 2007, scientists at Duke University’s Nicotine Research
Program in Durham, North Carolina, the very heart of tobacco-growing coun-
try, reported that drinking milk and water or eating fruits and veggies seems
to make tobacco taste yucky, while alcohol beverages, coffee, and meat have
just the opposite effect.
Is this the way to a stop-smoking diet? Couldn’t hurt, according to program
director Jed E. Rose, who recommends diet modification along with any 
standard stop-smoking stratagem you prefer.
Anticipating the quit-smoking vaccine 
Wouldn’t it be nifty if you could just zip off to the doctor for an anti-smoking
shot? Take heart: Dr. Dorothy Hatsukami and her colleagues at the University
of Minnesota Medical School are working on it. 
Their solution, reported in the November 2005 issue of the medical journal
Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, is a vaccine that enables your body
to produce nicotine antibodies — teensy molecules that hook on to nicotine
molecules to prevent them from making their way into your brain. 
Volunteers given the experimental vaccine four times in one 26-week period
were more likely to be able to stay away from cigarettes for 30 days without
nasty withdrawal symptoms than those given a placebo (look-alike) injection.
Both those who received the vaccine and those who received the placebo
reported a similar incidence of mild or moderate side effects (headache,
cough, or upper respiratory tract infection).
Hatsukami’s research is a work in progress. Keep your eyes peeled for 
more info.

Movie babes and butts
Many smokers lit up their first cigarettes
because some movie star looked so darned
cool smoking. Unfortunately, some of the great-
est stars, such as John Wayne and Bogie, went
to their untimely reward courtesy of that cool
cig. Nonetheless, smoking is still a prominent
silver-screen fixture. In Basic Instinct, Sharon
Stone uttered this really great line: “What are
they going to do, arrest me for smoking?” These
days, in a lot of American cities, the answer is,
“We could if we wanted to.”
Take the following quiz and match the star with
the movie in which she lit up. And by the way, if
you still think that smoking is sexy, imagine the

and Your Cholesterol
In This Chapter
 Drinking (moderately) to your health
 Watching your alcohol intake
 Knowing the risks of ignoring the moderately part
 Getting the scoop on the nutrients in alcohol
A
lcohol beverages are among mankind’s oldest home remedies and simple
pleasures. The ancient Greeks and Romans called wine a gift from the
gods — now that’s holding it in pretty high regard. As for distilled spirits, 
the Gaels (early inhabitants of Ireland) called them uisgebeatha (whis-key-ba).
The French came up with eau de vie (o-duh-vee). And the Scandinavians
dubbed the hard stuff aquavit (ah-kwa-veet). Take your pick — they all mean
“water of life.”
The funny thing is that this translation may turn out to be a scientifically
accurate description. Drinking moderate amounts of alcohol appears to 
benefit your heart. (No, that doesn’t mean you should start drinking if you’ve
been abstaining from drinking up to now.) 
Yes, excessive drinking is hazardous to your health, and you can read about
that later on in this chapter, but first, the good stuff, including alcohol’s 
ability to lower your cholesterol.
Wait! One more thing. Throughout this chapter — and throughout this 
book — beer, wine, and spirits are called alcohol beverages, not alcoholic 
beverages. After all, who ever heard of a beverage that can drink enough 
to become an alcoholic?

Toasting to Your Heart
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services is a primer for
healthy eating (and drinking). So you may be interested to read that the
guidelines state flat out that compared to nondrinkers, adults who consume
one to two alcohol beverages a day appear to have a lower risk of coronary
heart disease.
Clearly, the Guidelines’ authors, sober scientific ladies and gentlemen every
one, have been doing their reading. Which is to say, they’ve been looking at a
series of recent studies showing that moderate use of alcohol beverages has
the following effects:
 Lowers total cholesterol
 Raises levels of “good” cholesterol (check out these high-density 
lipoproteins, also known as HDLs, in Chapters 2 and 3)
 Lowers blood pressure
 Relaxes muscles (including the heart muscle)
Okay, you’re right. Maybe that last bullet point doesn’t affect your cholesterol,
but it does make you feel good. Does all this sound good enough for you to
take a look at the data that convinced the experts? If so, keep reading.
Studying the studies
The evidence that moderate drinking benefits the heart comes from really
reliable studies from real, reliable sources, such as the American Cancer
Society (ACS), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the long-running,
70,000-women Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) from the Harvard Medical School,
Harvard School of Public Health, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in
Boston. Hey, it don’t get more reliable than that, right? 
Here are the studies of proof:
 Really Reliable Study #1: The ACS’s Cancer Prevention Study I (CPS-I) fol-
lowed more than 1 million Americans in 25 states for 12 years. Analyzing
the lifestyles of 276,802 middle-aged men and the circumstances of those
who died during the study period, the researchers concluded that men
who drink moderately lower their risk of heart attack — 21 percent
lower for men who have one drink a day than for men who never drink.
In addition, men who have one or two drinks a day are 22 percent less
likely to die of a stroke.
160
Part III: Leading a Cholesterol-Lowering Lifestyle 

 Really Reliable Study #2: An analysis of the data for nearly 600,000
women in CPS-I showed that, like men, women who drink occasionally 
or have one drink a day are less likely to die of heart attack than women
who don’t drink at all.
 Really Reliable Study #3: In 2002, researchers at the NHS issued a 
new report on 70,891 women who were 25 to 42 years old when the
study began in 1989. This time the subject was alcohol. The conclusion?
Women who have one-quarter to one-half drink a day — in real life, this
equals two or three drinks a week — are 15 percent less likely to develop
high blood pressure than women who never drink. At the other end of
the spectrum, women who have more than ten drinks a week are 30 per-
cent more likely to have high blood pressure. The results were the 
same regardless of the type of drink (beer, wine, or spirits) the women
preferred. Nice.

What happens as alcohol moves 
through your body?
How is it that alcohol beverages may benefit your heart, your blood vessels,
and your cholesterol profile? First, a bit of physiology. Unlike other foods,
which must be digested before your cells can absorb them, alcohol can flow
directly through body membranes into your bloodstream. 
For example, when you eat a burger, none of its protein, fat, carbs, vitamins,
or minerals get into your bloodstream until the burger has made its way
through your stomach and your small intestines.
The latest edition of Nutrition For Dummies (Wiley), which I also wrote, has an
entire chapter on how alcohol affects your body. But for an outline of the
path that the grape juice, oops, alcohol takes, check out these steps:
1. You take a sip of a really good merlot (or my personal favorite,
Chianti).
2. Small amounts of alcohol immediately pass through the membranes of
your mouth and throat into your bloodstream.
This process happens so fast that the alcohol reaches your brain within

3. Some of the alcohol goes directly from your stomach to your 
bloodstream.
4. Most of the alcohol goes from your bloodstream to all the organs
(such as your heart) in your body.
5. Alcohol relaxes the heart muscles, reducing the force with which the
muscle contracts (your heartbeat).
6. Your heart pumps out slightly less blood for a few minutes.
7. When your heartbeat slows and your heart pumps out less blood, 
a couple of things occur:
• Blood vessels all over your body relax, and your blood pressure
goes down.
• Blood platelets — the particles that make it possible for blood to
clot — become less sticky and less likely to clump together. For 
a while (oh, maybe an hour or so), your risk of blood clot-related
heart attack and stroke goes down.
8. Your heart muscle’s contractions soon return to normal, but as the
alcohol circulates through your body, your blood vessels may remain
relaxed, and your blood pressure may remain low for as long as half
an hour.
Although the immediate result of moderate drinking is beneficial, heavy
drinking or alcohol abuse can raise your blood pressure over the long term.
Focusing on cholesterol
Lipoproteins, the fat-and-protein particles on which cholesterol travels, come
in two varieties:
 HDLs (high-density lipoproteins) are labeled good because they carry
cholesterol out of the body.
 LDLs (low-density lipoproteins) are called bad because they take 
cholesterol into your arteries.
But as Chapter 2 explains, when you’re talking lipoproteins, size is as impor-
tant as type because large LDLs are less likely than small LDLs to make their
way into arteries.
162
Part III: Leading a Cholesterol-Lowering Lifestyle 

The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), funded by the National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute (NHLBI) was designed to evaluate risk factors for heart
disease in men and women 65 and older. Data from the 1,850-person study,
which ran from 1989 to 1999, has served as a base for more than 400 research
papers and 120 follow-up studies. 
In 2007, a team of researchers from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
(Boston), the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Vermont (Burlington)
and the University of Washington (Seattle) combed through the CHS’s data 
in search of medical gold. What they found was that men and women who
consumed 7 to 13 drinks a week had the highest number of small LDLs, which
have a higher chance of getting into the arteries, thus increasing their risk of
blockage. Score another round for moderation — one to two drinks a day.
Identifying Alcohol’s Heart-Healthy
Compound
If you’ve read the previous pages of this chapter, you’ve gathered that moder-
ate drinking has a few benefits. But what exactly is in the alcohol beverages
that does the trick? I’m glad you asked.
Unfortunately, the studies that show alcohol’s benefits for your heart and
blood vessels don’t necessarily agree on exactly which kind of alcohol bever-
age or which constituent in the beverage makes moderate amounts of alcohol
beneficial. Is it the alcohol itself? Or something else?
Surveying the studies
On the one hand, lots of studies show similar benefits with all kinds of 
alcohol beverages — beer, wine, and spirits — suggesting that the active
ingredient may simply be the alcohol.
On the other hand, one or two studies have shown special benefits for 
beer. The best you can say about this development is that it’s just one or 
two studies; before accepting this as a medical gospel, you’d have to see —
yes — more studies.

Part III: Leading a Cholesterol-Lowering Lifestyle 
Grooving on grapes
Grape skins and pulp are rich in resveratrol, and
grapes belong on a heart-healthy diet. Not only
are they low in calories, they’re high in nutrients
and yummy as all get out. A single serving of 20
green Thompson seedless or deep-red Tokay or
Emperor grapes has 70 to 80 calories, 12 to 16
percent of the recommended daily allowance of
vitamin C, and up to 84 percent of the potassium
in 1⁄2 cup of orange juice. And there’s a teensy
little bit of dietary fiber in the grape’s skin, plus
astringent tannins that make your mouth pucker.
Maybe that’s why Mae West, your great-great-
grandpa’s sex symbol, whose delightfully
raunchy wit is available today on DVDs from the
very modern Amazon.com, used to ask her
beaus to “peel me a grape.” If you want to peel
the grapes you toss into your fruit salad, choose
American varieties such as the Catawba,
Concord, Delaware, Niagara, or Scuppernong.
These grapes are called “slipskins” because
(surprise) the skin comes off easily. Peeling a
European variety, such as an Emperor, Tokay,
Malaga, Muscat, or Thompson, is more of a
challenge. Here’s a little Euro-grape-peeling
lesson:
1. Drop the grape into boiling water for a few
seconds.
2. Then fish it out with a slotted spoon (to
spare your fingers).
3. Finally, plunge the little darling into cold
water.
The hot water makes the water under the
skin expand so the skin swells; the cold
water makes it burst and peel back.
Or you can just eat your grapes with the skin on.
Note: Ounce for ounce, you get more resvera-
trol from grape juice than from plain grapes. The
darker the juice, the higher the resveratrol.
Drink up! The following minitable shows you the
nutrients in grapes and grape juice, depending
on the kind of grapes you ingest.

On the third hand — there’re always more than two hands in this kind of 
discussion — the first hint of alcohol’s heart benefits showed up in France,
where folks eat lots and lots of high-fat food — pâté! cheese! butter! — but
generally have a lower rate of heart disease than people in the United States.
Researchers eventually linked this situation, sometimes called “The French
Paradox,” to the facts that (a) the French serve their fatty foods in very 
small portions, and (b) the French also drink lots and lots of wine.
Nothing in science is ever simple, is it?
Since researchers have turned their attention to the heart-healthy French,
several studies have shown a correlation between low heart disease, favor-
able cholesterol profiles, and red wine consumption. This research leads to
the interesting possibility that the important ingredient in alcohol is actually
something in the skin, pulp, and seeds of grapes — the parts of the fruit more
widely used in making red wines. Ladies and gentlemen, meet resveratrol.
Zeroing in on resveratrol
Resveratrol is a flavonoid, one of a group of plant chemicals credited with 
lowering cholesterol and reducing inflammation of body tissues, such as the
lining of blood vessels, thus reducing your risk of heart attack.
The juice from purple grapes has more resveratrol than the juice from red
grapes, which has more resveratrol than the juice from white grapes. (Get 
the red wine connection?) To be even more specific, in 1998, a team of food
scientists from the USDA Agricultural Research Service identified a native
American grape, the muscadine, as an unusually potent source of resveratrol.
About half of all muscadines grown in the United States are used to make
grape juice. With that in mind, nondrinkers can get their resveratrol from
grapes and grape juice. Don’t you love it when science serves up something
for everybody?
Drinking in Moderation
So far in this chapter, we’ve been talking about the benefits of moderate
drinking. Here’s what “moderate drinking” means, from the Dietary Guidelines
for Americans:
 One drink a day for a woman
 Two drinks a day for a man
165
Chapter 10: The Grape, the Grains, and Your Cholesterol

Why does moderate mean different things for men and women? It’s an enzyme
thing. To metabolize (to get rid of, to use up) the alcohol you drink, your
body calls on enzymes called alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH). You produce
one form of ADH — gastric alcohol dehydrogenase (GADH) — in your stomach
(where alcohol metabolism begins) and another form of ADH in your liver,
the primary alcohol-metabolizing plant.
The average woman makes less GADH than the average man. As a result,
more unmetabolized alcohol flows from her stomach into her bloodstream 
on its way to her liver. With more unmetabolized alcohol in her blood, the
average woman is likely to become tipsy on smaller amounts of alcohol than
is necessary to produce the same effect in the average man.
Most people (men as well as women) need a full hour to produce enough
ADH to metabolize the amount of alcohol — 1⁄2 ounce — in one drink. But
that’s an average: Some people still have unmetabolized alcohol circulating 
in their blood for as long as two to three hours after they take a drink.
Which brings me to the next question: What’s one drink? According to the
American Heart Association, one drink equals
 12 ounces of regular beer
 5 ounces of wine
 1.5 ounces of 80 proof distilled spirits
 1 ounce of 100 proof distilled spirits
166
Part III: Leading a Cholesterol-Lowering Lifestyle 
Damaging the liver
Alcohol has to be metabolized in the liver by
ADH, which is found in the mitochondria (the cel-
lular powerhouses that convert nutrients into
energy-yielding molecules that fuel the cells) of
the liver cells. If the amount of alcohol presented
to the mitochondria exceeds the amount of alco-
hol the enzyme can detoxify, the alcohol poisons
the mitochondria and causes the liver cell to die.
The first change in the liver is seen as fat
depositing in the liver cells. If excessive alcohol
ingestion is continued, alcoholic hepatitis (an
inflammation within the liver cells) occurs. 
If excessive ingestion of alcohol is stopped at
either of these first two stages, the liver cells
may return to normal.
The liver is one of the few regenerative organs 
in the body. If you surgically remove half of the
liver, the body will regrow the half that’s removed.
If, however, excessive alcohol ingestion contin-
ues, cirrhosis, the final stage of liver damage,
occurs. Cirrhosis is a scarring of the liver cells
that’s an irreversible stage of liver disease and
frequently leads to death.

What makes these different amounts of beer, wine, and spirits equivalent?
Each serves up approximately 15 grams of ethyl alcohol, the only alcohol
used in alcohol beverages.
Checking Out the Risks, Too
Alcohol is a serious product. Having read this far, you know it has benefits.
But you can assume that it also has risks. You’re right.
The following sections focus on the risks of alcohol consumption.
Alcohol and cancer
The same studies that applaud the effects of moderate drinking on heart
health are less reassuring about the relationship between alcohol and cancer:
 The American Cancer Society’s Cancer Prevention Study I shows that
people who take more than two drinks a day have a higher incidence 
of cancer of the mouth and throat (esophagus).
 Researchers at the University of Oklahoma say that men who drink five
or more beers a day double their risk of rectal cancer.
 American Cancer Society statistics show a higher risk of breast cancer
among women who have more than three drinks a week.
The reassuring note? With the exception of breast cancer, the damage
appears to be linked to amounts of alcohol that exceed the moderate levels
set by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. For info on the moderate levels,
see the “Studying the studies” section earlier in this chapter.
Alcohol and birth defects
Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a collection of birth defects including (but 
not limited to) low birth weight, heart defects, retardation, and facial 
deformities. 
FAS has been documented only in babies born to women who experts
describe as “chronic alcohol abusers who drink heavily during pregnancy.”
No evidence ties the syndrome to one or two drinks during pregnancy, or
even one or two drinks a week during pregnancy.
167
Chapter 10: The Grape, the Grains, and Your Cholesterol

About 7 percent of the babies born in the United States each year have a
birth defect. Often the parents of these children feel guilty even though their
behavior had absolutely nothing to do with the birth defect. To make the
case even stronger, the U.S. federal government requires that a warning about
birth defects appear on all bottles of alcohol beverages.
To date, no solid scientific medical evidence says, “Avoid all alcohol while
pregnant.” But human beings are complicated forms of life, and the pos-
sibility of lifelong guilt if you have a drink while pregnant and then deliver 
a child with birth defects isn’t worth the moment’s pleasure.
Alcohol and the morning after
The stories from the morning after a night of too much alcohol aren’t fiction.
They’re a miserable physical fact. 
If you ever have too much to drink one evening, the next morning you may
experience many of the following symptoms:
 You’re thirsty because alcohol, a diuretic, has caused you to lose a lot 
of water through excessive urination.
 Your stomach hurts because alcohol irritates your stomach lining.
 You’re queasy because having your stomach irritated stimulates the
release of extra stomach acid and histamine, the same immune system
chemical that makes the skin around a mosquito bite red and itchy. 
(Who wouldn’t be queasy when her stomach looks like one big bug bite?)
 Your muscles ache because processing alcohol through your liver
requires an enzyme normally used to convert lactic acid, a byproduct of
muscle activity, to compounds you can use for energy. The extra lactic
acid piles up painfully in your muscles.
 You have a headache. Alcohol dilates (relaxes) blood vessels, including
some in your scalp. The dilated blood vessels swell, making your 
head hurt.
And when you’re talking headache, don’t forget the Red Wine Problem.
When grapes ferment, their protein molecules split into fragments. One
fragment, called tyramine, slows your body’s metabolism of alcohol, so
alcohol keeps circulating through your bloodstream, causing a headache
and other unpleasant sensations. Red wine has more tyramine than
other kinds of alcohol.
168
Part III: Leading a Cholesterol-Lowering Lifestyle 

These results are inevitable if you drink too much. Only time heals by enabling
you to metabolize alcohol and eliminate it from your body. Hangover remedies
or preventives are myths. For example, some people say that you should take
an aspirin while drinking to avoid the headache, but the aspirin will intensify
the irritation of your stomach lining. To avoid the morning after, drink 
moderately the night before.
Alcohol and sulfite sensitivity
Sulfur compounds (sulfites) are preservatives widely used to protect the
freshness of products such as dried fruits. Some wines also contain sulfur
compounds to slow down spoilage by yeasts still active in an aging wine.
169
Chapter 10: The Grape, the Grains, and Your Cholesterol
A word to the wise
When experts talk about alcohol abuse, they
don’t mean warming the vodka or chilling the
brandy. The foodies among us may wince, but
these gourmet gaffes aren’t the point. They mean
allowing alcohol to interfere with your ability to
enjoy a normal, productive life. If you or someone
you know is drinking too much, too often, don’t
miss this easy opportunity to find help.
1. Get up right now and walk over to your 
computer.
2. Turn it on.
3. Connect to the Internet.
What? You have broadband and it’s always
on? Well, skip this step and go to Step 4.
4. Go to this site: www.findtreatment.
samhsa.gov.
You’re now looking at the Web site for the
Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA), a division of the
U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services. This particular page enables you
to find a treatment center right in your own
backyard.
5. Click on the link to the treatment facility
locator.
You get a map of the United States.
6. Click on your state, and a short question-
naire pops up.
The nice folks at SAMHSA have already
filled in your state.
7. Add your city.
City and state are required, but you can
narrow your search by including your zip
code, street address, and the radius around
your home.
8. Click Continue to get a map of your neigh-
borhood with the treatment centers clearly
marked.
Try it. Your friends and loved ones will certainly
cheer you on. If you don’t have Internet access
readily available, try calling 800-662-HELP (4357).

Unfortunately, some people are sensitive or allergic to these compounds 
and may experience potentially serious reactions if exposed to foods contain-
ing sulfites. To avoid problems, the government requires all alcohol products
containing sulfites to say so on the label. Sounds sensible to me.
An allergic reaction to sulfites can be life-threatening. If you experience
intense itching, hives, swelling of your body, a “tight” feeling in your throat
(due to swollen tissues), or breathing problems after drinking alcohol, go
directly to the closest emergency room or call 911.
Alcohol and drug interactions
If you drink alcohol, even once in a while, when your doctor hands you a pre-
scription, hand her a request for the lowdown on how the drug may interact
with alcohol. The grape and the grain make some drugs stronger and reduce
the effectiveness of others.
Table 10-1 lists some of the known interactions between alcohol and a few
common prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. This short list gives
you an idea of some of the general alcohol-drug interactions likely to occur,
but it’s definitely not complete.
Always check with your doctor — or pharmacist — to be sure that your 
medication isn’t on the alcohol no-no list.

Rating Alcohol Beverages as Food
People make alcohol beverages from virtually every sugar-containing, 
carbohydrate food found on the planet, but the most common choices 
are cereal grains, fruit, honey, and potatoes. All these foods produce 
alcohol when fermented, but the alcohols have slightly different flavors 
and colors. 
Table 10-2 shows you which foods are used to produce the different kinds 
of alcohol beverages.

Counting content
No alcohol beverage is 100 percent alcohol. The beverage is always alcohol
plus water and, if it’s a wine or beer, some residue of the foods from which it
was made. You can tell how much alcohol is actually in an alcohol beverage
through the following two ways:
171
Chapter 10: The Grape, the Grains, and Your Cholesterol

 Alcohol by volume: Alcohol by volume measures the amount of alcohol
as a percentage of all the liquid in the container. For example, if your
container holds 10 ounces of liquid and 1 ounce of that liquid is alcohol,
the product is 10 percent alcohol by volume. A simple equation: 
Alcohol content÷Total amount of liquid = Alcohol by volume.
The label on every bottle of wine and spirits sold in the United States
must show the alcohol content as alcohol by volume (written as 12%
alcohol by volume or Alc. 12% by vol. — check out Figure 10-1). When
talking to each other, people who make and market alcohol beverages
sometimes use the shorthand abbreviation ABV, but this isn’t permitted
on beverage labels. For reasons too complicated to explain in less than,
say, ten pages, using the term alcohol by volume or proof on beer bottles
or cans is optional. Figure 10-1 shows you where to find the ABV on a
typical wine label.
 Proof: The label may also show proof, an older way of measuring 
the alcohol in an alcohol beverage. Proof is two times the alcohol by
volume. For example, an alcohol beverage that’s 10 percent alcohol 
by volume is 20 proof. Simple equation: Alcohol by volume × 2 = Proof.
Government warning: (1) According to the 
Surgeon General, women should not drink 
alcoholic beverages during pregnancy 
because of the risk of birth defects.
(2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages 
impairs your ability to drive a car or operate
machinery, and may cause health problems.

Counting calories
On its own, alcohol has no nutrients — zero, zilch, zip — other than energy 
(7 calories per gram), so distilled spirits such as whiskey have nothing to
offer, nutritionally speaking, other than calories. Beer, wine, cider, and other
fermented beverages contain some of the food from which they were made,
so they also contain small amounts of proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, 
and minerals.
Tables 10-3 and 10-4 show the nutrient content for one serving of several
types of alcohol beverages. As you can imagine, the amounts listed here 
are averages. For example, some sweet wines may have higher amounts of
carbohydrates (sugars) than this chart shows, but very dry (not sweet)
wines have less. Just go with the flow.

In this part . . .
W
hen food and lifestyle tweaks, turns, or transforma-
tions aren’t sufficient to control your cholesterol
levels, you and your doctor may decide to move on to that
old standard: A Pill for Every Ill. But before popping a pill —
no matter how beneficial — a smart health consumer
does the research. This part makes research a cinch. I
evaluate the virtues of nutritional supplements, cholesterol-
lowering medications, and — yikes! — medical products
that may be counterproductive to your quest for the Big
Prize — an improved cholesterol profile.

Chapter 11
Vitamins, Minerals, 
and Other Good Stuff
In This Chapter
 Naming nutrients that fight cholesterol
 Discovering the power of niacin
 Chewing on some fiber
 Planting the anti-cholesterol seed
O
ne day, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals (phyto = plants) are the
cat’s meow. The next day, they’re thrown out with the cat’s litter. Although
taking vitamin pills and other nutritional supplements is sometimes touted as one
way to lower cholesterol, most studies come up a bit short of proclaiming it a
certainty. Or worse: At least one study shows that taking extra vitamins may
reduce the effectiveness of cholesterol-lowering medications.
As a result, the best advice on supplements may be one that’s tried and true
(and a bit boring): A balanced diet beats supplements hands down. In this case,
I’m talking about a balanced, low-cholesterol, controlled-fat diet. A few exceptions
exist to the advice I just laid on you, and I promise to discuss those exceptions in
this chapter, along with all the info you need concerning cholesterol and how it
relates to vitamins, minerals, fiber, and other dietary supplements.
For the lowdown on cholesterol-lowering prescription meds, check out 
Chapter 12; for cholesterol-lowering diets, your best bets are Chapters 4 and 5.
Identifying Supplements
Every year, Americans snap up more than $3 billion worth of nutritional 
supplements. Some people use them for “nutritional insurance;” others see
supplements as a quick and easy way to get vitamins, minerals, and other
good stuff without the pesky fat and sugars found in food.

But you’re reading a book about cholesterol, so for you, the most interesting
statement about supplements may be that some appear to help lower total
cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) while raising high-density lipopro-
teins (HDLs), the cholesterol particles you can read more about in Chapter 2.
The U.S. government considers dietary supplements to be food products, not
drugs. As a result, supplements aren’t regulated as strictly as drugs, and very
few serious studies exist to show how these pills affect cholesterol. Every
rule, however, has an exception. Which is the point of this chapter, so read on.
Popping a Vitamin and Mineral 
Pill May Help Lower Cholesterol
Some nutrients play an important role in keeping your heart healthy. For
example, calcium enables muscle cells, including heart muscle cells, to send
messages back and forth, and selenium protects against Keshan disease, a
disorder of the heart muscle whose symptoms include rapid heartbeat,
enlarged heart, and (in severe cases) heart failure.
But when it comes to lowering cholesterol, most nutrients are no-shows. The
one stellar exception is niacin. The maybes are vitamin E, vitamin C, and calcium.
How niacin helps control cholesterol
Niacin is a B vitamin considered essential for proper growth and develop-
ment. It’s intimately involved in the work of enzymes, naturally occurring
compounds in your body that power various processes such as digestion.
In fact, niacin is a component of one enzyme that enables oxygen to flow into
your body tissues. Like thiamin (vitamin B1), niacin helps you maintain a
healthy appetite. It also participates in the digestion of sugars and fat. You
get niacin directly from these foods:
 Dairy products: Your body converts the amino acid tryptophan found in
milk and dairy foods into niacin.
 Grains: Grains are a source of niacin, but your body can’t absorb them
efficiently unless they’ve been treated with lime (the mineral, not the
fruit — see the nearby sidebar “Limelicious”).
 Meat, fish, and poultry: No need to explain these three, right?
The niacin you get from food helps your body function in all of these ways,
and it also protects you against the niacin-deficiency disease pellagra. The
178
Part IV: Cutting Cholesterol with Nutrients and Medicine 

symptoms of pellagra include diarrhea, skin lesions, confusion, and dementia.
But the amount of niacin found in food is too small to affect your cholesterol.
For that, you need industrial-strength niacin.
Numbering normal niacin needs
In the United States, the recommended dietary allowance of each nutrient is
usually abbreviated as RDA, a term comparable to the Canadian RNI (recom-
mended nutrient intake).
The RDA for niacin is described in terms of niacin equivalents (NE), as in
milligrams of niacin equivalents (mg/NE). For example, 60 mg of tryptophan
(an amino acid in milk) = 1 mg of niacin = 1 niacin equivalent (mg/NE).
The basic adult requirement for niacin is 14 mg/NE per day for women and 16
mg/NE per day for men. The amount of niacin required to lower cholesterol
levels is dramatically higher.
Measuring medically-effective levels of niacin
If you take an immediate-release form of niacin, a product that sends the vitamin
right into your bloodstream, the starting dose is 100 mg/NE three times a day.
The starting dose for an extended-release form of niacin, a product that releases
the niacin gradually into your bloodstream, is one 375-mg/NE pill once a day.
So much for the techy details. Now, on to the practical part.
Balancing the benefits and risks of medical-strength niacin
As a medication, large doses of niacin
 Lower your triglycerides (fats in your blood; see Chapter 2)
 Lower your total cholesterol up to 10 percent
 Lower your LDLs by as much as 14 percent
 Raise your HDLs by as much as 25 percent
179
Chapter 11: Vitamins, Minerals, and Other Good Stuff
Limelicious
Treating grain with lime is a common practice in
Central American and South American countries.
Lime enables the body to absorb the niacin effi-
ciently. In these countries, lime is added to
cornmeal used to make tortillas.
In the United States, breads and cereals are
routinely fortified with niacin, which makes the
use of lime unnecessary.

So far, everything sounds pretty good, but like most medication, a cholesterol-
lowering dose of niacin has potential side effects. Like what?
 Like a niacin flush, a feeling of sudden warmth similar to the hot flashes
some women experience at menopause, which is kind of weird if you’re
not yet in menopause — or if you’re male
 Like making your diabetes or arthritis medication less effective
 Like skin rashes, hives, itching, muscle pain, peptic ulcers, upset stomach,
nausea, diarrhea, liver damage, vision problems, dizziness, and fainting
Call 911 or go immediately to the closest emergency room if you experience
any of these symptoms while taking niacin supplements.
Worse yet (can it really get worse?), if you develop any of these symptoms
and decide to stop taking niacin cold turkey, your total cholesterol and your
LDLs will rebound, zooming skyward, almost certainly higher than they were
before you started taking niacin.
One way to avoid this state of affairs is to taper off niacin, taking a little bit
less every day.
If a pill — including a vitamin pill — is powerful enough to alter your choles-
terol profile, it’s powerful enough to be troublesome — an example of how
something natural may be helpful but not necessarily harmless.

Chapter 12.
Evaluating vitamin E and vitamin C
Vitamin E is a fat-soluble nutrient (a vitamin that dissolves in fat and can be
stored in your fatty tissue). Vitamin C is water-soluble (a vitamin that dis-
solves in water and is eliminated when you urinate). But the two nutrients
have one interesting trait in common: Both are antioxidants.
Antioxidants are substances that prevent fragments of molecules from hook-
ing up to form potentially damaging compounds inside your body.
For example, many cured meats contain added vitamin C and vitamin E to
prevent fragments of preservatives called nitrates and nitrites from hooking
up to form carcinogens called nitrosamines.
Linking antioxidants and cholesterol
Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) are fat-and-protein particles sometimes called
“bad” cholesterol because they ferry cholesterol into arteries. Combining with
oxygen makes LDLs more damaging.
180
Part IV: Cutting Cholesterol with Nutrients and Medicine 

So it seems reasonable to assume that anything that prevents LDLs and
oxygen from mating should lower your risk of clogged arteries.
One such “anything” may be antioxidant vitamins. In fact, during the 1990s,
several major scientific studies at thoroughly reputable scientific institutions
suggested that antioxidant vitamins E and C could protect your heart muscle
and blood vessels from cholesterol damage.
This led many respected scientists (and some nutritional theorists) to say
that taking a lot of E and C would be good medicine. But they may have been
off on the wrong path.
More recent studies suggest contrary conclusions: Taking antioxidant vitamins
may reduce the effectiveness of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, and antiox-
idant vitamins may actually convince your liver to churn out more cholesterol.
Subverting the statins
In August 2001, Atherosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology, a journal 
of the American Heart Association, published a report from a one-year study
at the University of Washington School of Medicine.
The study included 153 volunteers between the ages of 33 and 74 who had
arteries narrowed by cholesterol plaque and low levels of HDLs, the “good”
cholesterol. Each volunteer was randomly assigned to one of the following
“treatment” regimens:
 Regimen #1: The cholesterol-lowering drug Simvastatin (Zocor), plus
niacin, and antioxidant vitamins E and C (for a rundown on Simvastatin
and other “statins” see Chapter 12)
 Regimen #2: Simvastatin and niacin
 Regimen #3: Antioxidant vitamins alone
 Regimen #4: A placebo (pill with inactive ingredients; basically a sugar pill)
Ordinarily, both Simvastatin and niacin lower total cholesterol and LDLs
while boosting HDLs, but volunteers who took Simvastatin, niacin, and
antioxidants experienced a smaller increase in HDLs than volunteers who
took the drugs alone, and their levels of HDL (2) — a kind of “super good”
cholesterol — didn’t budge a bit. Boy, did that surprise the researchers!
As a result, the editorial accompanying the report concluded that doctors
should tell their patients that taking antioxidants with a statin drug, such as
Simvastatin, or with niacin may not be a good idea.
But the editorial also noted that the study was so small that it couldn’t be
considered conclusive, especially since vitamin E — a natural anticoagulant
that reduces the risk of blood clots — has been shown to lower the risk of
heart disease.
181
Chapter 11: Vitamins, Minerals, and Other Good Stuff

Then, believe it or not, results from another study, this one from Oxford
University (England), showed no ill effects from combining antioxidants with a
statin drug, leading the Brits to suggest that the problem may lie with the niacin.
Making the body make more cholesterol
In April 2004, a team of researchers at New York University School of Medicine’s
Lipid Treatment and Research Center reported that when mice were fed a diet
rich in the antioxidant vitamins E, C, and beta-carotene, their livers churned
more than normal amounts of VLDLs (very low-density lipoproteins).
VLDLs are one form of LDLs, the fat-and-protein particles that carry cholesterol
into arteries. (For more on the various forms of lipoproteins, see Chapter 2.)
Would this also happen in human beings? The researchers couldn’t say for
sure; after all, mice aren’t people.
However, the study — plus a raft of others casting doubt on the anti-
cholesterol powers of antioxidants — may have been what led the American
Heart Association to issue the following statement in 2007:
“The American Heart Association doesn’t recommend using antioxidant
vitamin supplements until more complete data are available. We continue
to recommend that people eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods daily from
all the basic food groups.”
Can calcium supplements 
counter cholesterol?
Remember when your mother told you to drink your milk because — all
together now — “Calcium makes strong bones and teeth.” Would mom say
the same thing about calcium’s ability to lower the level of cholesterol
circulating in your older body? Maybe.
182
Part IV: Cutting Cholesterol with Nutrients and Medicine 
Ticking off tocotrienols
Tocotrienols are phytochemicals similar to vita-
min E. One measly study shows that taking
tocotrienols lowers LDLs, so some companies
are packing tocotrienols in pills and selling them
as cholesterol-lowering supplements.
But if you take vitamin E while taking tocotrienols,
the former cancels out the effects of the latter.
Too complicated for me!

In May 2003, a team of researchers from the Department of Medicine at the
University of Auckland (New Zealand) reported that when 223 postmenopausal
women who weren’t being treated for high cholesterol or osteoporosis were
given either calcium supplements (1 g/day) or a placebo (a look-alike pill with
no calcium) for 12 months, HDL levels rose about 7 percent among those taking
the calcium, while LDL and total cholesterol levels went down slightly.
Conclusion? For older women, calcium supplements may protect arteries, as
well as bones. Good job, mate.
Fighting Cholesterol with Dietary Fiber
As you can read in Chapter 5, there are two kinds of dietary fiber — insoluble
dietary fiber (which doesn’t dissolve in your intestinal tract) and soluble dietary
fiber (which does dissolve in your gut).
There’s absolutely no doubt that eating foods like beans, fruits, veggies, and
grains, which are all high in soluble dietary fiber, lowers your cholesterol.
You can read all about oatmeal and beans, the quintessential soluble-dietary-
fiber factories, in Chapter 6.
But suppose you totally loathe high-fiber foods. Suppose just looking at fruits,
veggies, grains, and beans makes you go, “Ugh!” Far be it from me to say, “Boy!
You’re missing some good stuff.” No, my job here is to answer the question
dancing across your lips: “Can I get my fiber from supplements?” Well . . .
maybe.
Soluble dietary fiber lowers your cholesterol levels by mopping up choles-
terol in your digestive tract before it gets into your bloodstream. To do this
job effectively, the fiber must absorb water and form a gel.
To date, more than 50 separate scientific studies (notice the subtle, albeit
compelling, alliteration) attest to the ability of some soluble-fiber supple-
ments to lower total cholesterol and LDLs. The soluble dietary fibers most
often studied in these tests are
 Guar gum: A sticky, soluble dietary fiber from a plant commonly 
cultivated in India as cattle feed. Guar gum is also known as guar flour 
or bentonite.
 Pectin: A soluble fiber found most prominently in apples.
 Psyllium: A sticky soluble fiber also known as plantago seed or 
plantain seed.
183
Chapter 11: Vitamins, Minerals, and Other Good Stuff

But not all supplements containing these fibers are equally effective. For a
soluble-fiber supplement to lower your cholesterol, it must form a strong gel
that can attract and hold cholesterol in your gut. Unfortunately, some methods
of processing fiber to make supplements break up the strands of carbohydrates
that form the gel, thus weakening the whole darned thing.
To be certain that a dietary-fiber supplement will actually lower cholesterol,
the manufacturer has to test it, a time-consuming and expensive process. As
a result, very few fiber supplements can actually prove they will lower your
cholesterol. Sorry about that.
Psyllium alert! Psyllium alert! Some people are allergic to psyllium. If they eat
the stuff, they may end up with hives or a rash, respiratory problems, or —
worst-case scenario — the potentially lethal, whole-body reaction called 
anaphylaxis. In other words, something natural may be helpful but not neces-
sarily harmless. If you consume some psyllium and start feeling itchy or have
trouble breathing, get to the nearest emergency room or call an ambulance.
Phabulous Phytochemicals
Perhaps the most fascinating nutritional discovery of the past several years
has been the identification of phytochemicals, naturally occurring compounds
in plants. Some of these compounds actually mimic powerful medicines such
as the female sex hormone estrogen and the cholesterol-lowering statin drugs.
Who wouldn’t be impressed with these natural wonders?
Sticking with sterols
Plants are great little pretenders. They often manufacture compounds that
resemble chemicals found in animal (human) bodies but don’t seem to carry
the problems associated with animal (human) chemistry.
One good example is phytosterols, substances that resemble cholesterol so
closely that your digestive tract can’t tell what’s a phytosterol and what’s
cholesterol.
If you eat phytosterols along with a meal that includes cholesterol, your body
is likely to absorb phytosterols (which won’t clog your arteries) in place of
cholesterol (which may).
This principle has inspired the creation of special cholesterol-lowering
margarines that promise to change your cholesterol profile for the better,
although the exact decrease in total cholesterol and LDLs and the increase in
HDLs will vary with the dose and the body. For more on the sterol margarines,
see Chapter 6.
184
Part IV: Cutting Cholesterol with Nutrients and Medicine 

As with dietary fiber supplements, the question here is whether you can
cram enough of the good stuff into a pill to let you take your sterols as a sup-
plement rather than a food. This time, the answer is why bother? The sterol
studies say you must wolf down at least 3,000 milligrams (mg) of sterols per
day to produce a noticeable change in your cholesterol levels. Each table-
spoon of sterol margarine provides 1,700 mg, so two tablespoons per day
more than does the trick.
By comparison, the University of California Berkeley Wellness Letter says that
the doses of sterols in supplement pills are “too small to have any effect.”
How small? Usually in the under-400-mg-per-pill range, which means you’d
need about eight pills a day to make a difference. I say, pass up the pills, and
“butter” (note the qualifying quote marks) your bread.
The sterols in sterol margarine or cholesterol-lowering supplements aren’t the
same as the steroids sometimes used illegally by athletes to bulk up their
muscles. Do I need to add that steroids, which can really mess up your body
systems, are a definite no-no? Make that, NO-NO. And go ahead and add an
exclamation point, as in never, ever use these drugs!
Getting the goods on garlic supplements
As a food, garlic is yummy. As a cholesterol buster, it’s so-so. In the mid-1970s,
a number of studies suggested that phytochemicals in garlic, particularly the
smelly mustard compounds such as allicin, were useful in lowering cholesterol.
Later research is mixed.
Some studies say, yes, garlic and garlic supplements can lower cholesterol.
Others say not in this lifetime. In 2007, Christopher Gardner, assistant professor
of medicine at Stanford University, ran a trial with 192 adults — in this case,
people older than 50 — whose average LDL level was 140. Six days a week for
six months, the volunteers were given the equivalent of one clove of garlic
(either as a pill or as plain raw garlic mixed into food) or a dummy pill.
Monthly blood tests failed to show any change in cholesterol levels, but more
than half the people who got garlic reported bad breath and body odor.
Conclusion: Pass this supplement by. Otherwise, people may pass you by.
Waiting for the Next Study
This section may be a good opportunity to remind you that it takes a while to
shake down all the data from new medical studies and that this situation
sometimes leaves doctors and patients confused.
185
Chapter 11: Vitamins, Minerals, and Other Good Stuff

At one recent medical convention, speakers presented the findings from four
large treatment trials whose aim was to determine if taking vitamin E may help
prevent heart attack. Three of the trials showed that vitamin E had no beneficial
effect on the heart, and one showed that vitamin E caused more heart attacks
than the placebo.
At the beginning of the presentations, the doctors in the audience were
asked, “How many of you are taking vitamin E for your heart?” and about half
of them raised their hands.
After the presentation of the trials, the doctors were asked, “How many of
you will be taking vitamin E in the future?” and no one raised his or her hand.
Who’s right? I hate to say this, but who knows? The only conclusive answers
about vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and cholesterol will come —
arrrgh! — with time.

kay, so you’ve changed your diet to conform to the guidelines in Chapters
4 and 5, you’ve stepped up your exercise (see Chapter 8), and you’ve
lost a couple of pounds — maybe even more than a couple of pounds. But —
can it be? — your cholesterol levels are still higher than your doctor consid-
ers healthy. What to do?
You may be a candidate for cholesterol-lowering drugs. This chapter, with
eight tables and one very detailed drawing of your innards, compares the
effectiveness of different kinds of drugs, explains the unfamiliar words used
to name these drugs, lists potential side effects, and generally gives you the
facts you need to make an informed decision as to whether you’re a candidate
for cholesterol-busting meds. So read it.
Introducing Cholesterol-Lowering
Medicines
Modern medicine has reduced the number of deaths from heart attacks, but,
until recently, it hadn’t substantially lowered the number of heart attacks or
cases of heart disease. One possible way to accomplish this is to eliminate the
cause of many heart attacks — that is, to lower the amount of cholesterol
swimming around in the blood.

Doctors currently use one (or more) of four different kinds of meds to lower
cholesterol, which I list here:
 Statin drugs
 Cholesterol blockers
 Bile acid sequestrants
 Triglyceride inhibitors (including the B vitamin niacin)
To explain the particulars about these meds, I have created a separate section
for each starting right after the nifty picture of your insides in Figure 12-1, which
shows where in your body the cholesterol-lowering drugs do their good work.
Patients with high cholesterol (particularly those who’ve already had a heart
attack) may also be given anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as aspirin and
clopidogrel (Plavix). Anticoagulants don’t lower cholesterol, but they do
reduce the risk of blood clots, thus reducing the risk that a blood clot gets
stuck in a cholesterol-clogged artery.

Cutting cholesterol off at the source:
Statins
Atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), pravastatin (Pravachol), simvastatin
(Zocor), and rosuvastatin (Crestor) are medicines known collectively as
“statins.” The statins reduce the body’s synthesis of cholesterol, which means
they are definitely heart-healthy. In fact, the usual dozens of studies cited in
cases like this show that taking a statin drug can do all these good things:
 Lower your LDLs
 Raise your HDLs
 Reduce your plaque (the technical term for gunk sticking to your artery
walls that may break off and form clots, which can block the flow of
blood and cause a heart attack)
 Protect the lining of your arteries
All arteries are lined with tissue called endothelium. When the endothelium
doesn’t function properly, the artery starts to build up plaque. Statins,
as well as some other drugs, keep the endothelium healthy — another
way these drugs lower your risk of heart attack or stroke.
 Lower your C-reactive protein, another risk factor for heart attack that
you can check out in Chapter 3
 Reduce your risk of a first heart attack
 Reduce your risk of a second heart attack if you’ve already had one
 Reduce your risk of stroke
Statins are sold as single ingredient pills or combo pills that add a second
heart-healthy drug such as one that lowers blood pressure. Table 12-1 lists
the various statin products currently on your drugstore shelf or behind the
counter.

Statin side effects
Because you’re reading this book, I know that you’re an informed medical
consumer. Because you’re an informed medical consumer, you know that
even beneficial medicines may pose problems for some patients.
When statins first came on the market, manufacturers included a notice in
the small print of their product information about muscle cramps, aches, pain,
and weakness, but it sure looked insignificant. Yet from their introduction in
the late 1980s, it was clear that statins may trigger rhabdomyolysis, an excessive
breakdown of muscle tissue creating a flood of waste cells that tumble through
the bloodstream and into the kidneys where they may clog small passages
and — theoretically — cause kidney failure.
Until the summer of 2001, the word theoretically was very, very important. In
clinical trials of more than 50,000 patients, researchers hadn’t linked a single
death to statin-triggered kidney failure. But cerivastatin (Baycol), a new statin
introduced by Bayer A.G. in 1997, was different. The incidence of rhabdomyoly-
sis among Baycol users was about ten times higher than among people taking
other statin drugs, and the reaction was more likely to be really serious —
read: fatal.
190
Part IV: Cutting Cholesterol with Nutrients and Medicine 

By August 7, 2001, when Bayer took Baycol off the market, at least 31 deaths
had been linked to the medication in the United States, and the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) had reports of nine more deaths abroad. The total
number of deaths linked to Baycol has never been finalized, but the esti-
mated number of cases of rhabdomyolysis eventually rose into the thousands,
and according to the Kaiser Daily Health Policy Report of November 23, 2004,
Bayer has settled nearly 3,000 lawsuits about Baycol-related injuries.
Today, the package inserts and advertising for all statin drugs include a warning
about muscle pain, usually like this in bold black type. Forewarned, after all,
is forearmed. The following list details the currently recognized side effects
of statin drugs:
 Common side effects: Abnormal results on tests for liver enzymes 
(temporary), allergic rash, fatigue, headache and dizziness, low blood
pressure, upset stomach (nausea, gas, diarrhea, or constipation)
191
Chapter 12: Prescribing Lower Cholesterol
Name games
When the words on this page move from unfa-
miliar to incomprehensible, you know you’re
into the serious stuff. That’s the case with HMG-
CoA reductase inhibitors, the scientifically-
correct name for statins.
The easy way to define HMG-CoA reductase
inhibitors is to work backwards, starting with
the last word in the name. Inhibitor is plain
English for something that keeps something else
from doing something.
Now, move back one word to reductase. Note
the ending -ase, which is the scientific short-
hand for enzyme. Now you know an HMG-CoA
reductase inhibitor is a drug that interferes with
(inhibits) the action of an enzyme. Hey, that’s not
bad for a non-scientist!
Next step: CoA. The initials stand for coenzyme
A. But if you look that term up in Stedman’s
Medical Dictionary, the one most science writers
use, it directs you to HMG-CoA, the abbreviation
for — take a deep breath — beta-hydroxy-beta-
methyl-glutaryl-CoA.
What in the world is beta-hy. . . . No, no, not
again. I’m going to stick to the abbreviation.
HMG-CoA is an important player in converting
fats to lipoproteins and cholesterol.
Put it all together, filter out the science speak
(well, most of it), and you get the plain-language
definition of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor: A
drug that reduces the activity of an enzyme
needed to turn fats into lipoproteins and cho-
lesterol, especially the nasty little LDLs.
Wait. Don’t leave. I’m not done.
The generic names for all HMG-CoA reductase
inhibitors end in –statin because, as the
International Union of Pure and Applied
Chemistry and the International Union of
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology so care-
fully note, the suffix –statin stands for “factors
inhibiting the release (and perhaps the synthe-
sis) of pituitary hormones.”
Now we’re done. Whew.

 Less common/potentially serious side effects: Persistent abnormal
results on liver function test, accompanied by hepatitis, abnormally low
platelets (particles that enable blood to clot), emotional depression,
memory loss, muscle pain and tenderness, muscle loss (rhabdomyolysis),
protein in the urine
Naturally, because you are, as noted above, an informed medical consumer,
you tell your doctor right away if you experience any of the more serious side
effects. Right away. No waiting. Really.
Statin interactions with other drugs
If you take a statin along with a drug that blocks the action of liver enzymes
required to eliminate statins from your body, the level of statins floating about
your organs and tissues may rise high enough to cause serious muscle damage —
and maybe even kidney failure — which isn’t a good thing. Among the drugs
known to hit those liver enzymes and trigger this reaction are the antibiotics
clarithromycin (Biaxin) and erythromycin; oral fungus fighters, such as keto-
conazole and other meds whose names end in –azole; and protease inhibitors
(HIV/AIDS drugs).
Taking two or more meds at once is a balancing act, so always tell your
doctor exactly what you’re taking when she prescribes a new medicine,
including a statin.
Nature’s cholesterol busters: Not
Hate doctors? Don’t want to spend all your money on prescription drugs?
Think you can find an inexpensive over-the-counter cholesterol buster?
Fuggeddabboudit.
In the late 1980s, health food stores did a nifty business selling a “natural”
cholesterol buster called Cholestin. The active ingredient in Cholestin was
red yeast rice (or red rice yeast) produced by fermenting a particular strain
of rice with — what else? — yeast, a process that created a form of lovastatin,
the statin drug sold under the brand name Mevacor.
Because red yeast rice was introduced as a dietary supplement, not a drug, it
didn’t have to go through the rigorous tests for safety and effectiveness
required of lovastatin. Was it safe? Probably as safe as lovastatin. Did that
mean perfectly harmless? Clearly not, as you can see for yourself by reading
the side effects listed for lovastatin earlier in this chapter.
In 2000, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that red yeast rice was a
drug and therefore subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). After that, the FDA went all out after any company selling red yeast rice,
demanding to see proof — real scientific studies, please — demonstrating the
safety and effectiveness of any product containing red yeast rice.
192
Part IV: Cutting Cholesterol with Nutrients and Medicine 

As an inevitable result, while products listing red yeast rice as an ingredient
are still available on health food and drugstore shelves, the rice is made differ-
ently and no longer contains any statin. Other “natural” cholesterol-lowering
products may contain various herbs, vitamins, dietary fiber, and plant 
compounds such as stanols and sterols (the anti-cholesterol ingredients in
some margarines described in Chapter 6). You don’t need a prescription for
these products and the packages sure are pretty, but none of them will lower
cholesterol as effectively as statin drugs.
Trading bile for cholesterol: 
Bile acid sequestrants
Right off the bat, here are a couple of those unfamiliar words I mentioned at
the start of this chapter. Don’t panic. Just take ’em one at a time. Bile acids
are digestive aids stored in your gallbladder. (If your gallbladder has been
removed, your body still makes bile acids but releases them into the diges-
tive tract instead of storing them.)
Bile acids enable you to metabolize fats so that your body can absorb fatty
acids (no, ice cream doesn’t go straight from your lips to your hips) and
convert them to useful products such as — you got it — cholesterol. Bile acid
sequestrants are compounds that grab up bile acids in your intestines and
eliminate them via your feces before the bile acids can do their job on fats.
You take bile acid sequestrants right before you eat so they’re readily available
when the gallbladder begins to release bile acids for digestion. As the bile acid
sequestrants grab up so much bile acid that you can’t efficiently digest fats,
your body says, “Whoa there! I need some more of this stuff.” As a result, you
begin to convert some of the cholesterol in your body to bile acids to replace
the ones you’ve mopped up and eliminated, and the amount of cholesterol 
and triglycerides in your blood goes down.
The different bile acid sequestrants
The most commonly used bile acid sequestrants, listed in alphabetical order
by their generic names, are
 Cholestyramine: Available either as a powder to mix with a clear liquid,
such as water or juice, or as a chewable bar. The brand names for
cholestyramine are Prevalite and Questran.
 Colesevelam: Available in tablet form — a unique selling point. The
brand name for colesevelam is Welchol.
 Colestipol: Available as coated tablets, flavored granules, a liquid, or in
packets of powder (to be dissolved in water). The brand names for
colestipol are Colestid and Lestid.
193
Chapter 12: Prescribing Lower Cholesterol

Taking low doses of bile sequestrants (8 gram/day) may knock cholesterol
levels down by 10 to 15 percent. Tripling the dose may lower LDL levels by 
25 percent.
Taking bile sequestrants with a second drug improves their performance. For
example, in one drug trial, taking colesevelam alone cut total cholesterol by
about 10 percent and LDLs by about 18 percent. Taking colesevelam plus a
statin drug cut total cholesterol up to 21 percent and LDLs up to 32 percent.
The side effects of bile acid sequestrants
Bile acid sequestrants have been in use for so long that their overall long-term
safety is well established. But there are some drawbacks:
 Common side effects: Constipation, loss of appetite, gastric upset (indi-
gestion, gas, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), headache and dizziness, muscle
and joint pain, discolored teeth
 Less common, more serious side effects: Reduced absorption of calcium,
leading to increased side effects; risk of osteoporosis (loss of bone density);
vitamin deficiencies due to reduced absorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K,
as well as the B vitamins folic acid and niacin; decreased effectiveness of
painkillers, diuretics, some diabetes drugs, some antibiotics, and some
antifungal drugs
To reduce the side effects of bile acid sequestrants, the FDA suggests that you
 Start with small doses.
 Drink a lot of water to prevent constipation.
 Ask your doctor about the need for nutritional supplements and the
possibility of drug interactions.
Finishing off another kind of fat:
Triglyceride inhibitors
Triglyceride inhibitors are medicines that reduce your liver’s natural production
of triglycerides, a fat that circulates in your blood. Lowering the level of triglyc-
erides means you convert less dietary fat to lipoproteins. As a result, triglyceride
inhibitors lower the production of LDLs, the “bad” cholesterol. No surprise there.
But for some unknown reason, they also increase the levels of HDLs, the “good”
cholesterol. Down with the bad, up with the good. Go figure.
The most commonly used triglyceride inhibitors are fibrates and the B vitamin
niacin, which are covered in the following sections.
194
Part IV: Cutting Cholesterol with Nutrients and Medicine 

Fighting cholesterol with fibrates
Fibrates, also known as fibric acids, are a class of drugs that reduce blood
levels of triglycerides and increase the levels of HDLs (“good” cholesterol).
The fibrates include clofibrate (Atromid-S), fenofibrate (Tricor), and gemfi-
brozil (Gemcor, Lopid). Because these drugs haven’t been shown to reduce the
overall incidence of heart attack, they’re not considered first-line treatment.
The fibrates come in capsules to be taken twice a day — 30 minutes before
breakfast and 30 minutes before dinner. What? You have to get up half an
hour early to take a pill? Oh, well . . .
Because taking fibrates may raise blood sugar, these drugs are rarely prescribed
for people with diabetes. Following are other possible side effects of fibrates:
 Common side effects: Allergic, itchy, skin rashes and hives; blurred
vision; fatigue; gastric upset (diarrhea, gas, nausea, vomiting); headache
and dizziness; muscle aches
 Less common, more serious side effects: Flu-like symptoms (chills, fever,
sore throat); gallstones; kidney failure; lower blood levels of potassium;
lower levels of white blood cells (the cells that protect against infection);
muscle weakness or loss of muscle tissue; Raynaud’s syndrome (constric-
tion of small blood vessels in hands and feet)
Nipping the numbers with niacin
The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for niacin is 16 mg/day for a man,
14 mg/day for a woman. Taking much larger amounts of this familiar B vitamin
appears to reduce triglycerides. For example, in various clinical trials, people
taking doses of niacin up to 375 mg/day were able to cut their total cholesterol
levels by up to 10 percent and their LDLs by up to 14 percent while raising
their HDLs by as much as 25 percent.
In addition, niacin/nicotinic acid dilates blood vessels so that (theoretically)
blood flows more easily through even clogged blood vessels. When niacin dilates
blood vessels, it causes a feeling of warmth and flushing much like the “hot
flashes” many women experience at menopause. To reduce this effect, doctors
who prescribe niacin often opt for the sustained release or extended release form of
the med. Instead of sending niacin zooming into your bloodstream as soon as — or
pretty soon after — you take the pill, these babies release their niacin slowly, over
several hours. In 2006 and 2007, several studies showed that combining niacin with
a statin drug was an even more effective treatment.
Currently, niacin is available as a single ingredient drug either as a generic or
under the brand names Niacor, Nicolar, Niaspan, and Slo-Niacin. Advicor is a
sustained release combination drug containing niacin and lovastatin (Mevacor)
in two doses: 500 mg niacin/20 mg lovastatin and 1,000 mg niacin/20 mg
lovastatin.

Questioning a cholesterol buster
The scenario is familiar: You open your morning
newspaper or turn on the evening news and
read or hear that a prestigious pharmaceutical
company has discovered a splendiferous new
medicine that will solve one of your most press-
ing health problems like, oh, high cholesterol.
The FDA has signed on, so you hotfoot it over 
to the doctor who prescibes the new med. And
then what happens? Two weeks, two months, or
two years down the road — “Oooops!” they
say. “We think we missed something here.”
Ezetimibe (Zetia) is the first prescription drug
created specifically to lower LDLs (“bad” cho-
lesterol) by reducing your body’s absorption of
the cholesterol in food. The med was introduced
in 2003 as a single ingredient product (Zetia) and
in 2004 as the second ingredient (along with
simvastatin) in the combo pill Vytorin. When the
FDA approved ezetimibe in 2003, it did so on the
basis of several small trials, none of which ran
longer than three months — and which hinted
at trouble ahead. The people in the trial took
either ezetimibe or a look-alike pill without eze-
timibe, and the people in the ezetimibe group
were 11 times more likely to experience serious
adverse effects, most commonly liver damage.
(Other possible side effects in the ezetimibe
group — allergic reactions, increased risk of
gallstones, and potentially serious muscle and
liver damage — were described as “rare.”)
In December 2007, this situation became more
troublesome when non-government experts on
drug safety, including researchers at the
University of Washington, discovered that
Merck and Schering-Plough, the companies
that jointly market ezetimibe, had not published
the data from a 2-year, 760-person clinical trial
called “Enhance” that ended in April 2006 and
was originally scheduled to be made public in
2007. The FDA said the agency had seen the
unpublished studies and considered ezetimibe
safe, but in January 2008, when the study was
finally published, ezetimibe’s rep took a tumble.
The Enhance study was designed specifically to
show that ezetimibe not only lowers LDLs
(“bad” cholesterol), but also — like statins —
reduces the buildup of plaque inside blood ves-
sels that can lead to heart attack and stroke. In
fact, that did not happen. Patients in the trial
took either simvastatin (Zocor) alone or a com-
bination of simvastatin and ezetimibe (Vytorin).
Simvastatin alone lowered LDLs by 41 percent
on average; simvastatin plus ezetimibe, by 58
percent. But among patients given the combi-
nation pill, the plaque accumulated twice as
fast as among those taking simvastatin alone. In
short, taking ezetimibe appeared to increase the
risk of both heart attack and stroke.
Many experts called this development “shock-
ing.” Others said the data required further
investigation. Congress called for an inquiry into
the delay in releasing the trial results. Merck
and Schering-Plough announced that the
results of a longer, larger study of ezetimibe
would be released in a few years. Patients and
doctors fumed.
As of this writing, both Zetia and Vytorin are still
on the market, but stay tuned — and if you are
taking either one, be sure to check with your
doctor for the latest update.

 Reduced effectiveness of painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs such
as ibuprofen (Advil), naproxen (Naprosyn), and naproxen sodium (Aleve
and Anaprox)
 Liver damage (high doses)
 Dizziness
Check earlier in this chapter for the side effects of statin drugs.
The word niacin is used interchangeably for two different chemical compounds,
nicotinic acid and nicotinamide (also known as niacinamide). Nicotinic acid
reduces levels of triglycerides. Nicotinamide does not. Also, the niacin sold as
a dietary supplement (vitamin) isn’t a substitute for prescription niacin, a
product whose use must be monitored by your doctor.
Comparing the Benefits of 
Cholesterol-Buster Drugs
Assuming that you worked your way through all the paragraphs before this,
you’re now definitely an expert on the virtues of the various drugs your doctor
may prescribe to lower your cholesterol. What? You didn’t read every single
word? Twice? Not to worry. Table 12-2 pretty much sums it all up as of 
Winter 2008.
The doses listed in Table 12-2 are the highest prescribed in one day. They are
not the doses prescribed for every patient. In fact, your doctor may achieve
satisfactory results — lower LDLs — with lower doses. Do not change your
dose of any of these medicines without your doctor’s approval!

Picking the Perfect Pill Candidate
Should you be using a cholesterol-lowering medicine? Maybe. One way to decide
is to review the recommendations of the experts at the National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute’s Web site: www.nhlbi.nih.gov. The recommendations
are contained in two reports:
198
Part IV: Cutting Cholesterol with Nutrients and Medicine 

 The Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and
Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III)
 ATP III Update 2004: Implications of Recent Clinical Trials for the ATP III
Guidelines
To save time, ink, and the lives of all the trees that would otherwise be cut
down to make the paper for the extra pages required to print that entire title
over and over again, I’ve made an important decision. From now on, I refer to
these reports by their nicknames: ATP III and ATP III Update. If you’re absolutely
committed to reading both reports in their mind-numbing entirety, feel free to
visit www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol/index.htm.
Meanwhile, I dance through the highlights:
 In the context of ATP III and ATP III Update, a major risk factor is diabetes,
high blood pressure, high levels of LDLs, high levels of triglycerides, smok-
ing, being older than 45 (men) or 55 (women), or having a family history of
early heart disease (before 55 for your dad, before 55 for your mom).
 To estimate your risk of suffering a heart attack in the next ten years,

Assessment Tool for Estimating Your 10-Year Risk of Having a Heart
Attack at http://hp2010.nhlbihin.net/atpiii/calculator.asp.

doctor.
Categorizing risk
ATP III divided Americans into four large categories based on their risk of
heart disease. The categories are
 High risk: Known coronary artery disease and/or blocked arteries in the
legs or brain, plus multiple major risk factors
 Intermediate risk: No known vascular disease, at least two major risk
factors, and 10 to 20 percent risk of heart attack in the next ten years
 Moderate risk: No known vascular disease, at least two major risk factors
 Low risk: One or no major risk factors, less than 10 percent risk of heart
attack in the next ten years
199
Chapter 12: Prescribing Lower Cholesterol

The ATP III Update revised the risk categories as follows
 Very high risk: Previous heart attack or stroke, plus several major risk
factors
 High risk: Known coronary artery disease and/or blocked arteries in the
legs or brain, plus multiple major risk factors
 Moderately high risk: No known vascular disease, at least two major
risk factors
 Moderate risk: No known vascular disease, at least two major risk factors
 Low risk: One or no major risk factors, less than 10 percent risk of heart
attack in the next ten years
As a result of this update, several million more Americans were now classified
as being at high risk or very high risk, necessitating — you guessed it —
more meds.
Recommending treatment
The treatment recommendations in both ATP III and ATP III Update are both
based on the proposition that lowering a person’s level of LDLs lowers her
risk of heart attack. The difference lies in the decision about who needs to be
treated and how low she needs to go.
ATP III’s treatment recommendations were simple:
 The first line of defense in ATP III is diet. The report recommends that a
whopping 65 million Americans change what they eat in order to lower
their cholesterol.
 If changing the diet doesn’t do the trick, the NHLBI recommends that an
almost-equally-whopping 35 million Americans with a more than 20-percent
risk of heart attack in the next ten years and/or an LDL level higher than
130 mg/dL begin drug treatment to push their LDLs down to 100 mg/dL.
The treatment recommendations in the ATP III Update are dramatically different:
 For people in the very high risk and high risk categories, the 
recommended level of LDLs was lowered to 70 mg/dL, a level virtually
impossible to reach without drugs.
 If a very high-risk or high-risk person has high levels of triglycerides, 
a fibrate or nicotinic acid should be given along with a cholesterol-
lowering med.
200
Part IV: Cutting Cholesterol with Nutrients and Medicine 

 The best option for moderately high-risk people is to aim for LDL levels
less than 100 mg/dL. Any moderately high-risk person with LDL levels of
more than 130 mg/dL plus major risk factors is a candidate for cholesterol-
lowering drugs.
 Low-risk people don’t have to take cholesterol-lowering drugs.
Seems like practically everyone you know is a candidate for cholesterol-buster
meds. Not surprisingly, that conclusion hasn’t been universally applauded.
Many critics note (correctly) that the ATP III Update pretty much ignores the
benefits of lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, while passing over
studies showing virtually no benefits in giving cholesterol-lowering meds to
older people. Others are distressed by the makeup of the ATP III Update
panel: Eight of the nine panel members had financial ties to companies
producing cholesterol-lowering drugs. Ooops.
As the debate simmers, will the ATP III Update recommendations become the
norm? Maybe. Should you check with your own doctor before diving into
drugs? You bet. Case closed.

In This Chapter

 Naming the problems with vasoconstrictors
B
elieve it or not, several common medications, such as diuretics (also known
as water pills), work like a dream to cure or alleviate conditions they were
designed to treat, such as swelling caused by water retention, but may send your
“bad” cholesterol up, your “good” cholesterol down, and your triglycerides heaven-
knows-where (see the section “Lowering Fluids with Diuretics” later in this chapter).
The following sections make up a representative list of medicines that may
alter your cholesterol levels, sending some kinds of cholesterol up and others
down. But hey, forewarned is forearmed.
Hankering for Hormones
In the past few decades, hormone products have become part of everyday
life. The female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone are used for birth
control, “morning after” pills, and postmenopausal hormone replacement
therapy. Some athletes skirt the law by using steroids (male hormones) to
build muscles. In each case, the use of hormones, like the ones listed in this
section, can have unexpected effects on cholesterol levels.

204
Part IV: Cutting Cholesterol with Nutrients and Medicine 
Birth control pills
The most popular oral contraceptives (OCs) are a combination of the female
hormones estrogen and progestin (a synthetic form of progesterone, the second
female sex hormone). The less effective and thus less frequently used “mini-
pill” is plain progestin.
Estrogen seems to be the more cholesterol-friendly female hormone. Estrogen
lowers total cholesterol and boosts HDLs, the “good” cholesterol. But higher
doses of progestins lower HDLs. You can read all about it for yourself in this
quote from the package insert that comes with all OCs sold in the United States:
A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen
and progestogen [another way to say “progestin”] in oral contraceptives and
the risk of vascular disease. A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins had
been reported with many progestational agents. Estrogens increase HDL
cholesterol. The net effect of oral contraceptives depends on a balance
achieved between doses of estrogen and progestogen. Most scientists now
believe that the reason women on hormone replacement therapy had a
higher incidence of heart attacks is because the therapy stimulates the clot-
ting system, and since the first event in a heart attack is a clot forming in the
coronary arteries, that is the reason for the increased number of heart
attacks and not the effects of cholesterol.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
Now that researchers have proven the link between HRT and a higher risk of
breast cancer and disproved the assumption that taking hormones after
menopause lowers a woman’s risk of heart disease, fewer women are using
these pills.
For those who do — or for those women who take estrogen for a few weeks
or months after a surgical menopause (translation: total hysterectomy that
removes both the uterus and the ovaries) — I want to point out that estrogen
does increase levels of HDLs. Wait. I already said that in the preceding section.
Table 13-1 lists the words used for “estrogen” or “progestin” on the labels for
birth control pills and postmenopausal hormone-therapy products.

Muscle builders
The male sex hormone testosterone promotes muscle mass, which is why the
average man has bigger biceps than the average woman.
In medicine, anabolic androgenic steroids (muscle-building, testosterone-like
compounds) are used legally to treat the results of abnormally low levels of
testosterone, such as delayed male puberty, some forms of impotence, and
the wasting of lean muscle mass associated with certain illnesses — AIDS
being one of them.
Although these meds are banned from all legitimate athletic competition,
some athletes use them secretly in an attempt to enhance performance. In
the long run, it’s a losing game. According to the National Institute on Drug
Abuse (www.nida.nih.gov), steroid abuse — using the drugs to build mus-
cles for athletic competition — comes with a full complement of horrible side
effects, including liver tumors; liver cancer; yellowish pigmentation of skin,
tissues, and body fluids; high blood pressure; kidney tumors; severe acne;
trembling; shrunken testicles; infertility; increased risk of prostate cancer;
male pattern baldness (in men and women) . . . no, no, I can’t go on. This
book is called Controlling Cholesterol For Dummies, not Steroids For Dummies,
so I have to stick with the main event: Taking anabolic androgenic steroids
raises LDLs and lowers HDLs. No gold medal there, guys.
Lowering Fluids with Diuretics
Diuretics are drugs that make you urinate more frequently, eliminating excess
fluids from your body tissues. Some ingredients, such as caffeine, in over-the-
counter (OTC) products have a diuretic effect, but the most effective diuret-
ics are the ones available only by prescription.
205
Chapter 13: Identifying Meds That Raise Cholesterol

Common prescription diuretics
Prescription diuretics may be either single ingredient products or combination
products. The active ingredient in a single ingredient prescription diuretic is
most commonly either furosemide, spironolactone, or a member of the thiazide
drug family. Table 13-2 lists some well-known single ingredient prescription
diuretics.
Table 13-2

Furosemide
Furosemide
Fumide-MD, Furose
Lasimide, Lasix
Spironolactone
Spironolactone
Aldactone
The primary active ingredient in combination diuretic products is commonly
a thiazide diuretic. The second active ingredient varies according to what the
drug is designed to accomplish. This is done because diuretics make most
blood-pressure-lowering drugs work better. For example:
 The active ingredients in Aldochlor are a thiazide diuretic (chlorothiazide)
and methyldopa, a drug that lowers blood pressure by relaxing blood
vessels.
 The active ingredients in Aldactazide are a thiazide diuretic
(hydrochlorothiazide) and spironolactone, a drug that reduces the
amount of the mineral potassium lost when you take a diuretic and uri-
nate a lot (yes, your body eliminates potassium through urinating).
 The active ingredients in Lopressor HCT are a thiazide diuretic
(hyrochlorothiazide) and metroprolol tartrate, a drug that helps control
the rapidity and force of your heartbeat.
206
Part IV: Cutting Cholesterol with Nutrients and Medicine 

Diuretics and cholesterol levels
Taking either a thiazide or furosemide diuretic raises total cholesterol levels
and levels of triglyerides (another blood fat described in Chapter 2). The
increase, however, is believed to be small enough that it doesn’t increase the
risk of heart disease. Because diuretics are so valuable for controlling high
blood pressure, your doctor can work with you to establish a diet that helps
control your cholesterol while allowing you to continue taking the water pills.
Any medicine, prescription or over-the-counter, that causes you to lose too
much water can have serious effects, like causing you to collapse from dehy-
dration. That’s why you should never use diuretics without the knowledge or
consent of your own personal physician.
Sabotaging Cholesterol Therapy
Your cholesterol is on the high side, so your doctor prescribes a cholesterol-
lowering statin drug, such as atorvastatin (Lipitor), pravastatin (Pravachol),
or simvastatin (Zocor), or a statin combo drug, such as Vytorin. You take the
pills right on schedule, but when your doctor tests your blood, your cholesterol
level hasn’t gone down. Why? One possibility is that you’re taking a second
medication that makes your statin less effective. Gee. Sometimes you can’t win
for losing.
Considering interactions between cholesterol and meds, I thought it important
to mention statin interactions. But for more on how the other meds you take
can affect a statin’s ability to control your cholesterol, turn back to Chapter 12,
which has absolutely everything you need to know about statins and other
cholesterol-lowering drugs, including these pesky drug/drug interactions.
Narrowing Your Options
Having high cholesterol is risky because cholesterol particles in your blood-
stream may snag on artery walls, catch other particles floating by, and build
plaque deposits that block the artery, stop the normal flow of blood to your
heart, and trigger a heart attack. Given this set of facts, you can understand
why medicines that further narrow the blood vessels may be problematic for
someone with high cholesterol or known coronary artery disease.
Drugs that make blood vessels constrict (narrow down) are called vasoconstric-
tors. Drugs that make blood vessels dilate (open wider) are called vasodilators.
Vasoconstrictors raise your blood pressure and vasodilators lower it.
207
Chapter 13: Identifying Meds That Raise Cholesterol

Vasoconstrictors are used in both prescription and OTC medicines, as you
can see here:
 An example of a prescription vasoconstrictor product is the Epipen, a
device that enables the patient to inject a dose of epinephrine.
 An example of an OTC vasoconstrictor product is a cold remedy, cough
medicine, or anti-asthma product in which the vasoconstrictor functions
as a decongestant, an ingredient that helps shrink swollen tissues in your
nose and throat. Hemorrhoid relief products may also contain vasocon-
strictors, but you apply them to your skin, so they’re less likely to be
problematic.
By the way, if you’re still smoking, you should know that nicotine is a vasocon-
strictor. For more about smoking and your cholesterol, check out Chapter 9. 
Right now, take a look at Table 13-3, which contains a list of common decon-
gestant ingredients from the Physicians’ Desk Reference 2001. All these ingre-
dients are vasoconstrictors, so if you have high cholesterol, you want to ask
your doctor before using these products.

*Epinephrine is also used as an injectible drug. Pseudoephedrine can be used to make the street

available without a prescription, but must be sold from behind the pharmacy counter rather than
simply stacked on open drugstore shelves.

Getting the Last Word
Every drug can be valuable — heck, even lifesaving — when prescribed for
the condition it’s intended to treat and for a patient whose body tolerates the
medicine. On the other hand, every drug has side effects. And sometimes a
drug that works for one person is ineffective or downright dangerous for
another person.
The trick is to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks. In other words,
try to knock off the illness or medical condition without harming the patient.
Doing that requires you and your doctor to work together. She by doing her
homework so she knows what may go wrong; you by taking your meds as
directed and reporting any problems immediately. And each of you needs to
listen to one another. It’s a hard job, but you can do it. So do it.

W
hen your doc gives you the good news that
your cholesterol is under control, you have
cause to celebrate. And even when you’re still
working toward lowering your cholesterol, special
occasions abound. Unfortunately, party foods, by
definition, are full of flavor and not short on fat.
But missing your son’s wedding, skipping out on
your best friend’s birthday party, or opting not to throw your annual holiday
bash isn’t an option.
The good news is that many of the foods recommended for heart health are
already standard party fare. Nuts to nibble, avocado in guacamole, smoked
salmon with capers, and olives of all sorts are green-light foods. Making sure
they’re healthy is just a matter of how you prepare them.
Think of cooking as an art rather than a science. The recipes in this chapter
are guidelines; don’t stress if you can’t find the exact ingredients or if your
measurements are just a bit off. Adding a little more or less of an ingredient
won’t ruin anything, and you just might end up creating something you like
even better. The prep time estimates I give you include the time it takes to
wash fruits and veggies under cold running water and to cut, assemble, and
measure all ingredients. The temperature for all recipes is in Fahrenheit. Also
note that the little tomato you see on the “tabs” in front of the recipe names
indicate that the recipe is vegetarian.
In this chapter, you discover heart-healthy foods with crunch that haven’t
been deep-fried, and satisfying nibbles high in the right sort of fats. I give an
assortment of quick and easy recipes for basic party offerings, including a

Little Bites a Cardiologist Would Love
The hors d’oeuvres and little nibbles that meet the nutritional requirements
of a cholesterol-lowering, heart-healthy diet are so numerous they would fill a
buffet table. These morsels feature raw vegetables, fresh herbs, healthy fats,
chicken, and fish. In addition, these foods are eaten in very small amounts,
but many are so tasty that you’ll be tempted to make a meal out of them.
Adding crunch to party fare
Healthy foods, perhaps because they’re never deep-fried, often lack crunch,
leaving you longing for the sound of crispy food and a satisfying chew. Party
favorites like potato chips and tacos are full of crunch, while healthier foods,
such as grains, nut butters, and vegetables, are quiet foods. The following
gives you ways to combine the best of both worlds: the cholesterol-conscious
and the crispy.
Crostini
Toast is crunchy, so how about starting with that and making some crostini,
which means “little toasts” in Italian. Here’s how to prepare crostini:
1. Adjust the rack of a broiler so that it’s at least 4 inches from the heat
source and preheat the broiler.
2. Cut a slim baguette of French bread (about 2 inches in diameter and
sold in specialty bakeries and upscale supermarkets) into thin slices
and place on a large baking sheet.
Cut slices of bread on the diagonal for a stylish presentation.
3. Brush the slices on one or both sides with a little olive oil and rub one
or both sides with a halved clove of garlic.
4. Broil the bread so that one side is lightly toasted.
5. Turn the bread over and broil for a minute or two, making sure that
the bread doesn’t toast all the way through.
212
Part IV: Cutting Cholesterol with Nutrients and Medicine 

Use crostini as a platform for other foods. Here are some suggested toppings:
 A smear of tapenade, an olive paste seasoned with capers, anchovies,
garlic, and lemon juice and sold in jars
 Goat cheese mixed with fresh herbs, such as basil and parsley, and
topped with a sliver of sun-dried tomato
 A spoonful of garlicky, mashed cannellini beans scented with oregano
Homemade baked tortilla chips
Instead of noshing on corn chips fried in who-knows-what kind of oil and
loads of salt, enjoy the crunch of home-baked tortilla chips. Start with corn
tortillas or whole-wheat tortillas, both made with whole grains, far healthier
than white flour tortillas. Here’s the procedure:
1. Using a pastry brush, brush each side of a corn tortilla with unrefined
safflower oil or lightly spray each side, using an oil sprayer filled with
unrefined oil.
To give the chips a southwest flavor, sprinkle the oiled tortillas with
ground cumin or chili powder.
2. Stack the tortillas and cut them into 8 wedges, as you would a pie.
3. Place the wedges in a single layer on an ungreased baking sheet and
bake in a preheated 400-degree oven, until they just begin to become
golden, 10 to 12 minutes.
Serve tortilla chips with a bean dip for a dose of soluble fiber. Or use gua-
camole, which is a great source of folate, or classic tomato salsa, which is full
of healthy ingredients.
Doing the crudité dip
Eating raw vegetables at parties became chic when the veggies took on the
name crudité, which is French for “raw.” They are indeed refreshing, crispy,
and full of all the vitamins and minerals nature gave them. But what do you
do with all the bits of vegetable after you cut them? Choose one of the follow-
ing ideas to bring order to the chaos:
 Start with sticks of carrot, celery, and seeded cucumber, and maybe
some blanched asparagus or blanched string beans, and give each veg-
etable a separate container, such as glass tumblers, colorful ceramic
mugs, or small flower vases. Cluster the containers on the serving table,
creating a vegetable forest.
 Arrange vegetables on a long, rectangular platter or basket lined with
kale, and give each vegetable its own row.
213
Chapter 14: Mouth-Watering Morsels for Special Occasions

 Tuck raw vegetables between the leaves of a full head of Boston lettuce,
following the instructions in the recipe, Crudité with Mango Salsa and
Creamy Avocado Dip.
Figure on 1 cup of dip for every 20 guests. If you’re serving chunky dips, you
may need a bit more.
The fat of the matter: 
Acceptable appetizers
One of the great pleasures of party food is that it’s full of hard-to-resist
assertive flavors, in part because the food is also full of fat, a flavor carrier.
Taking a holiday from diet restrictions, the most careful of eaters will gra-
ciously accept the hot cheese puffs and chocolate truffles being offered. But
there’s no reason you can’t enjoy the feel of fat, even if you’re watching your
cholesterol. You have options.
Nuts and olives
Nuts and olives are two classic cocktail nibbles that are perfectly acceptable
heart-healthy foods. In numerous studies, both nuts and olives, the basis of
the famed Mediterranean diet, have been linked to a lower risk of heart dis-
ease. In addition, the monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats in these
foods help control cholesterol.
So which nuts have the most of these healthy fats and are low in the 
cholesterol-raising saturated kind? Here are a few that fit the bill:
 Almonds
 Filberts
 Pecans
 Pistachios
 Walnuts
One way to include nuts in a party menu is to add walnuts to hummus, puree-
ing them along with the other ingredients. The rich, mellow flavor of walnuts
blends well with the flavors of the other ingredients, and walnuts add omega-3
fatty acids, making hummus even more nutritious. Here’s how to make it: In a
food processor, combine 2 cups chickpeas (one 15-ounce can), 1⁄2 cup walnuts,
1⁄2 cup tahini sesame paste, 1⁄4 cup fresh lemon juice, and 1 clove garlic, plus
water or oil to reach the desired consistency. Season with cumin and salt.

Part IV: Cutting Cholesterol with Nutrients and Medicine 

Cheeses
You can save on fat by eating lowfat and nonfat cheeses or having a soy
cheese look-alike, but I can’t promise you great flavor or texture in all cases.
For instance, I’d rather have a shaving of world-class Parmigiano-Reggiano as
a garnish for slices of pear topped with a paper-thin slice of prosciutto, than
a large wedge of rubbery, nonfat mozzarella any day. But do sample some
lowfat cheese and see what you think. For instance, lowfat ricotta can be very
satisfying. If you want to cut back on fat intake and still eat cheese, modified
products let you keep these creamy-tasting foods in your diet.
When shopping for cheese, be sure to read the label for content of total fat
and saturated fat as well as cholesterol. The amounts present vary among
producers. Cheeses such as Camembert, Brie, Roquefort, cheddar, and
American processed cheese can contain more than 25 percent of your daily
quota of saturated fat and about 10 percent of a day’s worth of cholesterol.
And these amounts are in just 1 ounce, which isn’t very much, especially for
a devoted cheese eater. Best to stay away from these unless you can stop
after one nibble. Feta and mozzarella, the full-fat kind, are lower in fat and
cholesterol and are better choices.
For the feel of fat on the tongue, use lowfat yogurt and lowfat sour cream,
both very palatable, in your hors d’oeuvres.
Caviar
If any food says “special occasion,” it’s caviar. Caviar is salted fish eggs, so,
just like chicken eggs, it’s a whole food and a balanced source of nutrition. In
addition, although fat contributes 61 percent of the calories, caviar, like fish,
contains mostly the healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated kinds.
Admittedly, caviar is high in sodium (containing 240 mg per tablespoon) and
in cholesterol (containing 31.3 mg per teaspoon), but you’re not likely to be
eating a bowlful of caviar anyway.
I give you two ways of serving caviar that give you a smidgeon of this glam-
orous stuff. On a budget, use black lumpfish caviar, golden whitefish caviar,
or salmon red caviar, all sold in little jars in supermarkets. Otherwise, invest
in some American farm-raised caviar or the even pricier imported sevruga,
osetra, or beluga caviar.
1. Boil round, red potatoes, the smallest you can find, until they’re
cooked through and tender.
2. Peel the potatoes, slice in half crosswise, and cut some potato off the
base of each half, so the potato is steady when placed on a plate.
3. Using a melon baller, cut into the flat surface of each potato half and
scoop out a little bowl in the middle.
4. Fill the hollow of each potato with lowfat sour cream and sprinkle the
sour cream with caviar.
215
Chapter 14: Mouth-Watering Morsels for Special Occasions

For this elegant hors d’oeuvre, caviar is displayed on pale chartreuse
Belgium endive.
1. Wash a head of Belgium endive and cut it at the base to separate
leaves.
2. Using a teaspoon, place a small dollop of lowfat sour cream at the
wider end of each leaf and then sprinkle caviar on the sour cream.
3. Garnish the caviar and sour cream with a tiny sprig of dill.
4. On a round serving platter, arrange these like spokes, with the
narrow end of the leaf pointing out.
Getting some help: Ready-made appetizers
I often serve canned stuffed grape leaves and no one is the wiser. My guests
sometimes even ask for the recipe. You can find heart-healthy, ready-made
appetizers in supermarkets or natural foods stores. Offer some of the follow-
ing on their own or add them to a few of your own appetizers:
 Roasted sweet red peppers
 Marinated artichoke hearts
 Smoked salmon
 Sliced veggies from the salad bar, to serve as crudités with a dip
 Stuffed tortellini (serve it on skewers)
 Freeze-dried vegetable crunchies, such as corn, peas, red bell peppers,
carrots, and tomatoes, produced with no added fat and sold in natural
food stores
 Canned stuffed grape leaves
Tasty Recipes to Impress Your Guests
The recipes in this section are attractive to the eye, and you and your guests
will likely count them among your favorites for regular snacking. The Citrus-
Scented Marinated Olives, in particular, are known to be highly addictive!
Some of the following recipes are hearty and healthy enough to be served as
a main course as well as party munchies. You can even turn the Mushroom
Pâté into a pasta sauce, as I explain in the recipe introduction. Use this sec-
tion as inspiration — take a look at your favorite heart-healthy meals to see
whether you can serve any of them as hors d’oeuvres at your next gathering.

T Cinnamon and Spice Almonds
Almonds have more of the monounsaturated fats, the cornerstone of the heart-healthy
Mediterranean diet, than any other nut. Scent them with spices, add some raisins, and
you’ve created a healthy treat. The small amount of butter in this recipe imparts its
inimitable flavor without adding much saturated fat. When nuts are toasted in this way,
they don’t absorb much of the cooking oils because they already contain a large amount
of fat. Serve this snack with cocktails or after-dinner coffee.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 3 cups (24 servings)
217
Chapter 14: Mouth-Watering Morsels for Special Occasions
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon unrefined safflower oil
3 cups raw almonds
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1 tablespoon ginger
11⁄2 teaspoons nutmeg
11⁄2 cups raisins
Salt
1 In a skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and combine with the oil.
2 Add the almonds and toss to coat with the oil. Sprinkle the almonds with the cinnamon,
ginger, and nutmeg and toss to combine ingredients. Toast, stirring occasionally, for 
5 minutes.
3 Add the raisins and continue to cook the almond mixture until the nuts begin to brown,
an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt. Make sure to cool the nuts 
completely before storing.

T Citrus-Scented 
Marinated Olives
Put one of these olives in your mouth, close your eyes, and you can taste summer in
Provence! Let the Mediterranean flavors transport you. This recipe uses brine-cured
olives, but if you want to cut back on salt, ordinary canned olives work fine as well. Use
pitted ones so that more of the marinade can find its way into the olives. You can also
marinate these olives in olive oil, but I use water here to cut back on calories and create
a lighter taste.
Preparation time: 15 minutes, plus 3 days for the olives to marinate
Marinade time: 3 days
Yield: 3 cups olives (24 servings)
218
Part IV: Cutting Cholesterol with Nutrients and Medicine 
11⁄2 cups kalamata olives or other brine-cured
olives
11⁄2 cups cracked brine-cured green olives
4 large cloves garlic, smashed
1⁄4 cup orange juice
1⁄4 cup fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon grated orange peel
1 tablespoon grated lemon peel
2 bay leaves
2 anchovies, minced, or 2 tablespoons
anchovy paste
1⁄2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 Combine the olives, garlic, orange juice, lemon juice, orange peel, lemon peel, bay
leaves, anchovies, and thyme in a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid.
2 Add enough water to the citrus marinade to cover the olives.
3 Seal the jar with the lid and shake the jar several times to distribute and combine the
ingredients.
4 Refrigerate the olives for 3 days, shaking the jar once each day to keep the marinade
well mixed.
Go-With: Serve the olives with goat cheese and a baguette of French bread.

Skewered Scallop 
Seviche with Avocado
Seviche, popular in Latin America, is raw fish that has been marinated in citrus juice,
usually lime. The acid in the fruit “cooks” the fish. Any white-fleshed fish or scallops
can be prepared this way. Shellfish has a reputation for being high in cholesterol, but a
serving of 4 skewers of these scallops contains only 16 mg of cholesterol.
Special tools: 36 bamboo skewers, 6 inches long
Preparation time: 20 minutes, plus 4 hours marinating time
Yield: 9 servings (about 4 skewers each)
219
Chapter 14: Mouth-Watering Morsels for Special Occasions
11⁄2 cups fresh lime juice, or enough to cover
the scallops
4 sprigs cilantro, stems removed and minced
1 tablespoon minced red onion
1 clove garlic, crushed and minced
1⁄2 pound tiny bay scallops, about 70, 
perfectly fresh
1 box (8 ounces) cherry tomatoes, washed
2 avocados
Salt and pepper
1 In a shallow 8-inch square baking dish, combine the juice, cilantro, onion, and garlic.
2 Rinse the scallops. If necessary, remove the tough, stark white hinge that attaches the
scallop to the shell. Place the scallops in the lime juice marinade. Cover and refrigerate
a minimum of 4 hours, or overnight. The scallops are “cooked” when they’re opaque.
3 Cut each tomato in half crosswise. Peel and remove the seed of the avocados and cut
them into 3⁄4-inch cubes. The cubes need to be substantial enough so that they don’t fall
off the skewer. Drain the seviche and season to taste with salt and pepper.
4 Assemble the skewers by threading the components in this order: 1 scallop, 1 cube avo-
cado, 1 scallop, and 1 cherry tomato half. Run the skewer through the center of the face
of the tomato where it was cut and then out the top through the skin, so the tomato
becomes a cap on the other foods.
5 On a round platter, arrange the skewers of seviche like spokes of a wheel, with the
tomato caps at the center. Or use a horizontal tray and place the skewers in a row with
the food colors forming stripes.

T Crudités with Mango Salsa and 
Creamy Avocado Dip
The inspiration for this recipe is a delicious combo dip I buy ready-made, a container
with a layer of fresh guacamole topped with a layer of mango salsa. The combination of
smooth and spicy is just right. The Creamy Avocado Dip included here is full of healthy
monounsaturated fats and is high in folic acid, while the Mango Salsa gives you an
effortless way to increase your fruit intake. For the crudités, try using only green and
white vegetables, like I suggest here, for a designy, high-style look.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 20 servings
220
Part IV: Cutting Cholesterol with Nutrients and Medicine 
1 head Boston lettuce, with the outside leaves
still intact (see the tip at the end of the recipe)
1 large turnip
2 dozen slim spears of asparagus, trimmed
and blanched
1 head endive, leaves separated and washed
1 cucumber, peeled, seeds removed, and
sliced into spears
1 Taking the base of a head of Boston lettuce in one hand, gently open the leaves of the
lettuce with the other hand, wiggling your fingers down between the leaves. (If the let-
tuce is sandy, submerge the opened head in a sink filled with water and briefly swish to
loosen dirt. Drain upside down in an empty dish rack before proceeding.)
2 Meanwhile, peel the turnip and cut in 1⁄4-inch rounds. Picture the turnip slice as the
earth and cut a small V-shaped wedge at the North Pole and South Pole. Also make two
V-shaped wedges at each end of the “equator.”
3 Bring about an inch of water to boil in a skillet and add the asparagus. Cook until the
asparagus is bright green and al dente, about 2 minutes. Remove with tongs, and sub-
merge the asparagus spears in a bowl of cold water until they reach room temperature.
4 Tuck the turnip slices, asparagus, endive leaves, and cucumber between the lettuce
leaves. Serve with the Mango Salsa and Creamy Avocado Dip.
Vary It! If you decide your crudité composition is begging for more color, add carrot sticks.
Tip: If the Boston lettuce on display has had the outside leaves removed, ask the produce
manager where you shop to bring you a full and untrimmed head from the cartons of pro-
duce stored in the back.

Mango Salsa
This recipes lives and dies on whether the mango is sweet with a smooth texture, so
chose your mango with care. When ripe, a mango yields to gentle pressure like a ripe
avocado, and the stem end has a gentle aroma. Choose plump mangos, avoiding those
with bruised or shriveled skin. This nonfat mix of healing fruits and vegetables also
goes great with chicken and fish.

Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: About 3 cups (60 servings)
221
Chapter 14: Mouth-Watering Morsels for Special Occasions
1 ripe mango, diced into 1⁄4-inch pieces
1 cup sweet red pepper, cut into 1⁄4-inch pieces
2 tablespoons minced red onion
1 fresh jalapeño chile, or to taste, seeded and
minced
1 tablespoon minced cilantro
2 tablespoons lime juice (juice of 1 lime)
Salt
1 Put the mango, sweet red pepper, onion, chile, cilantro, and lime juice in a mixing bowl.
Toss gently to combine the ingredients.
2 Season to taste with salt and serve immediately.

Creamy Avocado Dip
Sour cream dips have just the right tartness to complement the sweetness of fresh, raw
vegetables. Cut the saturated fat of the cream by making the dip with lowfat or nonfat
sour cream, and as in this recipe, substituting some of the sour cream with avocado to
add healthier fats.
Special tool: Food processor
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: About 11⁄2 cups (30 servings)
1 cup nonfat sour cream
1⁄4 teaspoon ground cumin
1 avocado, peeled and cut into chunks
1 small clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chopped, fresh cilantro leaves 
(3 sprigs), plus extra for garnish
Salt and pepper
1 Put the sour cream in a food processor fitted with a metal blade.
2 Add the cumin to the sour cream in the processor, and then add the avocado, garlic,
and cilantro. Process until smooth, scraping down the side of the processor bowl if 
necessary to incorporate all the ingredients.
3 Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer the dip to a small serving bowl and gar-
nish with chopped cilantro. Serve immediately. (The dip can also be prepared earlier
the same day you plan to serve it. Press plastic wrap onto the surface of the dip so that
no air comes in contact with the avocado in the dip to keep it from turning brown.
Refrigerate until ready to serve and add the cilantro garnish right before serving.)

T Mushroom Pâté
With its hearty texture, rich brown hues, and a dash of sherry, this vegetarian mush-
room pâté is much more than a passable substitute for the regular pork and liver ver-
sions. Instead, cashews are added as a source of oils. This pâté is such a winner that I
experimented thinning it with a little white wine and making it into a pestolike pasta
sauce, served with penne. It worked!
Special tool: Food processor
Preparation time: 30 minutes, plus 4 hours chilling time
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 12 to 15 servings of 2 tablespoons each
222
Part IV: Cutting Cholesterol with Nutrients and Medicine 
5 tablespoons unrefined safflower oil
2 large shallots, chopped (1⁄2 cup)
2 cloves garlic, crushed and chopped
11⁄4 pounds fresh shiitake mushrooms,
stemmed and coarsely chopped
1 cup roasted salted cashews
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley,
plus sprigs for garnish
2 tablespoons sherry
Salt and pepper
1 In a large, heavy skillet over medium heat, heat 4 tablespoons of the oil and add the
shallots, garlic, and mushrooms. Cook until the mixture begins to brown and all the
liquid evaporates, stirring frequently, 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the moisture 
content of the mushrooms. Remove the skillet from the heat.
2 In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, chop the cashews until they have a fine
texture. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and continue to process to make a coarse
paste.
3 Add the mushroom mixture, basil, parsley, and sherry. Pulse the processor on and off
until the pâté has a coarse texture. Season to taste with the salt and pepper.
4 Transfer the mushroom pâté to a small ceramic loaf pan, or a bowl lined with plastic
wrap so you can easily pop out the pâté. Cover and chill 4 hours. Serve in the loaf pan,
or turn the pâté out of the bowl and garnish with sprigs of parsley. Enjoy on crostini.

In this part . . .
W
ell, here you are. You’ve reached the place that
helps make a For Dummies book a For Dummies
book. Personally, I’m nuts about lists. I have lists of things
to do today, tomorrow, and next week; I have grocery 
lists, telephone lists, and, well, you get the picture. But if
you don’t get the picture, just flip through the following
pages, and you soon will. I’ve put together four chapters
that contain really useful lists for controlling cholesterol. 
If my editor hadn’t said, “Stop!” there would have been
more. What can I say? I tried.

Cholesterol Information
In This Chapter
 Reading through the government’s cholesterol guidelines
 Volunteering for a drug test trial
 Checking out cholesterol-lowering products
 Navigating a cholesterol information quiz
 Finding facts about general drugs
R
ules are made to be broken, so this Part of Tens is actually a Part of
Seventeens (which is to say, 11 entries with 17 different links to choles-
terol info). The plain fact is that the Internet has too many ultra-good, choles-
terol-centered Web sites for me to whittle them all down to a measly list of
ten. Enjoy the bonus sites listed here, as well as the other cholesterol info
sites scattered throughout the chapters in this book.
Keep two things in mind when surfing the medical Web:
1. Be cautious. Absolutely anyone can dream up a Web page, so you’re not
always guaranteed accurate information. When choosing among sources,
exercise good judgment. Look for a reputable name and reasonable
advice, not pie-in-the-sky (even if it’s a low-fat and cholesterol-free pie)
recommendations. The sites listed in this chapter meet those guidelines.
So click to your heart’s content. Or rather, to its health.
2. Things change on the Web, more quickly and more often than you may
expect. If you can’t find a site listed here or if when you do find it, the
contents don’t match the listing, just go with the flow. After all, the new
stuff may be even better than the last round.

The American Heart Association

You can also reach the American Heart Association’s Cholesterol Low Down

map, and scrolling to Cholesterol Low Down under Healthy Life Style. Or, as
with other big sites that have smaller sections on cholesterol, you can get
where you’re going by clicking on the address above.
The Cholesterol Low Down is the American Heart Association’s national
cholesterol education program whose primary aims are to urge us all to see
the doctor, determine our cholesterol numbers, and set out on a five-step
plan for long-term heart health. Accordingly, this page has five buttons to
click: Getting Started, Adjust Your Diet, Get Active, Check Your Progress, and
Keep it Up (and Down).
Each button leads to a well-designed page with concise directions. For exam-
ple, click Adjust Your Diet and you get a page pointing you toward sub-
sections such as Eating to Lower Your Cholesterol, How to Shop, Fat Facts,
and (goody!) Recipe of the Month. All in all, this information is pretty much
the kind of solid info you’ve come to expect from people who spend their
professional lives worrying about your heart.

frequently prescribed for lowering cholesterol. The general format includes
information similar to that found on other sites. The hot stuff on these is the
occasional offer of a free course of the med via a coupon you take to your
doctor who writes a prescription that you hand to the pharmacist. What? You

You can go to the homepage for the CDC (www.cdc.gov) and try to maneuver

Or you can simply go right to the cholesterol page with the address above.
Me? I chose the second path. But then, I get my workout on a balance board

page gives you what this agency is famous for — facts, statistics, and preven-
tion strategies. And, of course, the latest news and press releases. Neat.
The Mayo Clinic
www.mayohealth.org
When it comes to consumer-health communications, the Mayo Clinic is true
blue, just as cozy and user-friendly as all get out. I typed cholesterol into 
the search box and up popped more than 200 essays on cholesterol. Most 
relevant? The first 50, from High Blood Cholesterol to Heart Attack.
For people fuzzy about cholesterol facts, the Mayo Clinic’s absolute claim to
fame, on exhibit here, is its intelligent, balanced, and easily accessible pre-
sentation of serious technical stuff. Not to mention its sly (maybe uninten-
tional) sense of medical humor. For example, did I mention that in its list of
cholesterol-related essays the Mayo Clinic lists “Heart attack” right after
“Erectile Dysfunction: A sign of heart disease?” Hmmmmm.
MedicineNet.com

through to Cholesterol.
Either way, you get to look at Basics, Research, Overviews, Latest News,
Diagnosis/Symptoms, Treatment, Prevention/Screening, Alternative Therapy,
Nutrition, Disease Management, and Specific Management. But, as Thomas P.
“Tip” O’Neill, one-time Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives used to
say, “All politics is local.” The same goes for cholesterol: If yours is worrisome,
you want help right in your hometown. So my favorite click on this site is the
one labeled Go Local. Click here, choose one of the 19 states listed either from
a drop-down list or an interactive map, and you can wander through resources
as far as the eye can see — or the typing finger takes you. The only complaint:
How come they don’t list all 50 states? For now, the simple answer is, what you
see is what you get. But check back later: And, no, I have no answer right now.

reducing illness and death from coronary heart disease (CHD) in the United
States by reducing the percent of Americans with high blood cholesterol.

These reports are widely considered the official word on cholesterol evalua-
tion and treatment for most high-powered health groups, such as the
American Heart Association — and for your doctor, too. (For a dissenting
view to the ATP III Update, check out Chapter 12.)
Other goodies on this second site include information about cholesterol-
lowering drugs and conditions that may increase the risk of elevated choles-
terol levels. The “fun part” is an interactive calculator that enables you to
predict your ten-year risk of heart attack based on your cholesterol level and
other personal risk factors.

You got a taste of NHLBI from the first list of Web sites in this chapter that
sent you to ATP III. Now, open up the door to a ton of statistics and snippets of
health information about (what else?) your heart, your lungs, and your blood.
Before you leave this site, take note of something special: a link to studies
seeking patients. Before a new medicine or treatment method is approved by
the Food and Drug Administration, there must be proof that it’s “safe and 
efficacious.” (Translation: It won’t kill you, and it does work.)
Much of the required proof comes from government-sponsored trials. To find
out more about trials currently in progress, run your mouse over to the left
side of the page to the headline Clinical Trials, then go down one line, and
click NHLBI Studies Conducted at NIH in Bethesda, MD, to pull up various
ongoing studies. Check this out to see if you want to join a trial to assess the
potential of a new treatment program.

Ten Nutrition Web Sites
In This Chapter
 Describing nutrition Web sites
 Determining cholesterol and fat counts for common foods
 Developing heart smarts
 Losing weight to lower cholesterol
A
s with every other list of Web sites I’ve compiled for my For Dummies
books (Nutrition For Dummies and Weight Loss Kit For Dummies, Wiley
Publishing, Inc.), if my editors had made this section the Part of 100s, I could
have easily met the goal.
When you’re looking for reliable nutrition guidelines and information, the ten
Web sites listed in this chapter are the cream of the crop, or better yet, the
highest-grade skim milk. Each of the sites is an old friend I’ve come to lean
on. Each has something special to offer. If I’ve missed your particular favorite,
or you find a site that you think is especially useful, don’t hesitate to let me
know, perhaps for inclusion in the next edition of this book. Just e-mail the
info to www.dummies.com/register.
In the meantime, eat well and, as the song says, be happy.
Watch out for curves on the information superhighway. For reasons known
only to their webmasters, even successful Web sites are susceptible to
change without notice. What was there last week can disappear into some
parallel Internet universe, never to be found again. If the appearance of a site
listed in this book changes, just snoop around the site a bit for the info you
need. If the site disappears altogether, try looking up key words, such as
USDA or cholesterol, via a universal search engine like www.google.com.

The American Cancer Society
www.cancer.org
Yes, the American Cancer Society (ACS) Web site is dedicated primarily to infor-
mation about cancer: definitions, treatments, research, and support services.
Yes, most of the nutrition news you find here is available elsewhere. But this
site’s defined focus provides easy access to other cancer-related topics.
Even, yes, again, cholesterol. Try it: Type cholesterol into the search bar on the
ACS homepage, and bingo! You’ve opened a grab bag of ACS information about
cholesterol’s effect on your body and your risk of various kinds of cancer.
Until now, the ACS was barely a blip on the screen of nutrition sources. Today,
with a growing number of well-designed studies to demonstrate that some
foods and diet regimens — not to mention some drugs, such as those used to
lower cholesterol — may affect your risk of certain types of cancer, the ACS
Web site offers solid reporting on this area of nutritional research.
American Council on Science and Health,
and the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest
www.acsh.org
www.cspinet.org
This two-for-one special gives you nonprofit, consumer-friendly organizations
whose Web sites provide news releases, position papers, and highly reliable
information about nutrition issues and your health.
Your bonus is that the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH) and the
Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) are usually on opposite sides of
any nutritional issue. For example, the CSPI spearheaded the drive against the
fat substitute Olestra, while the ACSH contended that the substitute was useful
in some foods for some people. This kind of disagreement ensures that typing
in the same search word or phrase, such as low cholesterol, on both sites
provides you with the pros and cons associated with that topic.
Neither site is overly fancy. But both provide straight talk on specific issues,
such as which fast foods have the most artery-clogging trans fatty acids (boo)
and the least saturated fats (yea) or why tobacco is bad for you (maybe the
only subject on which these guys agree). 
234
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The sites also feature online membership enrollment and order forms for publi-
cations, like the list-filled Nutrition Action Healthletter from the CSPI or the well-
sourced and footnoted reports from the ACSH. The ACSH site takes on a cool
and calm personality, while the CSPI resembles a hot-button advocate. In
practice, both are solid and respectable as all get out.
The American Dietetic Association
www.eatright.org
The American Dietetic Association (ADA), which shares initials with the
American Diabetes Association, is the world’s largest membership association
of nutrition professionals. Its Web site is jam-packed with food and diet tips,
guidelines, research, policies, and stats.
The ADA homepage displays seven bright green boxes, each labeled with a
subject. Food & Nutrition Information has diet tips. Shop Online is a guide to
ADA publications. Media is fun if you’re addicted to press releases. Careers &
Students, Conferences & Events, Advocacy & the Profession, and Professional
Development are clearly for association members.
The most useful choice for folks trying to figure out exactly how to create a
cholesterol-busting meal plan may be the button up and to the right that says
Find a Nutrition Professional. Click that link, and you get a page asking you to
accept the Association’s conditions. Say yes, and you move on to a page
where more clicks get you info explaining how to find a dietitian in your area. 
If you can bend your brain around the much-too-adorable Net address
(Eatright? Give me a break!), this site is a true treasure. And golly gee, who
wouldn’t love having a personal dietitian to lead the way through the maze of
conflicting fat and cholesterol directives?
The American Heart Association
www.americanheart.org
The American Heart Association (AHA) site is a must-see on any cholesterol
tour of the Web. True, most of the info here is geared to reducing the obesity-
related risks of heart disease. However, the AHA also dishes up solid advice
for anyone looking for basic nutritional information and the lowdown on
cholesterol. But boy oh boy, do they make you work to get to it! The multiple
clicks will give your clicking finger a charley horse — but your brain (and you
heart, of course) will appreciate the exercise.

Chapter 16: Ten Nutrition Web Sites

For example, the homepage has 18 subjects you can investigate, ranging from
Heart Attack/Stroke Warning Signs at the top to Local Info at the bottom. Click
on Healthy Lifestyle (in the middle of the column), and you get several more
choices. Pick Diet & Nutrition, and you receive the following six options:
 Dietary Recommendations
 No-Fad Diet
 Nutrition Facts
 Smart Shopping
 Delicious Decisions
 Face the Fats
I’m not saying this isn’t all good stuff. I’m just saying, I’m exhausted. The best
bet is simply to noodle around the site.
The Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network
www.foodallergy.org
The Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) is a nonprofit, membership
organization (individuals can join for $30 per year) whose participants include
families, doctors, dietitians, nurses, support groups, and food manufacturers
in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The group provides education about
food allergies, as well as support and coping strategies for people who are
allergic to specific foods. The site’s best feature, an e-mail allergy-alert
system, is free.
Open the FAAN homepage, and you can easily log on to updates, daily tips,
newsletter excerpts, and all the usual service-oriented goodies. To start receiving
allergy alerts, click on the Special Allergy Alerts link, fill out the electronic form,
and zap it off. Performing this quick task connects you to an early-warning
system of allergy-linked news and information about product recalls, such as
a July 2007 recall of dark chocolate bars whose label didn’t list milk, a
potential allergen. This no-nonsense, highly accessible site can help you
avoid such incidents.

The Food and Drug Administration
www.fda.gov
Entering the FDA Web site is like opening the door to the world’s biggest toy
store. The virtual shelves contain so much stuff that you hardly know what to
grab first. Luckily, all the toys are free in this store. You can linger here happily
for days (weeks, years, or maybe forever) following the maze of cross-references
and sources.
As you can see by its name, the first concern of the Food and Drug
Administration is what you eat. Yes, the homepage offers information 
about medicines for people and pets, poisons and their side effects, medical
devices (think pacemaker), and FDA field operations (rules and regulations
enforcement). They even have a place to report an adverse event (“I took
that antibiotic and got hives!”). But for foodies, food is the main event.
To access the food part of the site:
1. Go to the homepage.
2. Click Food in the column on the left side of the page.
Say, “Wow!” What you get is access to a page for the Center for Food
Safety and Applied Nutrition. Say, “Wow!” again because this covers
everything. And I mean everything.
3. Now, browse to your heart’s content.
Food and Nutrition Information Center
www.nal.usda.gov/fnic
The Food and Nutrition Information Center (FNIC) houses one of several
nutrition-related data collections in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
National Agricultural Library. Like the basic Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) Web site (see the preceding section), the FNIC site is chock-full of facts.
You can dive in and swim around for hours without coming up for air.

Chapter 16: Ten Nutrition Web Sites

But getting to exactly the info nugget you need can take a couple of clicks. Be
patient, it’s worth it. After you get to the homepage, find the link to the
resources list. Click on it to bring up a long list of possibilities. 
Browse as you please, but click the nutrition and cardiovascular diseases link
when you’re ready to fight cholesterol. Up pops a list of, well, resources: books,
cookbooks, magazines, and newsletters, all dedicated to teaching you how to
plan a diet that lowers your cholesterol and reduces your risk of heart disease.
Click on the items that look interesting. Now wasn’t that worth the clicks?
The U.S. Department of Agriculture
Nutrient Database
www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/cgi-bin/nut_search.pl
The U.S. Department of Agriculture Nutrient Database is the ultimate nutrition
chart. Cholesterol, calories, vitamins — you name it, and this site measures it.
The simple fact is that you just can’t plan a low-cholesterol, controlled-fat
diet (or any other diet for that matter) without this chart, which serves up
nutrition data on more than 5,000 foods and breaks the information down
according to different sizes, portions, and different methods of preparation
(boiled, broiled, fried, dried, and so on).
Each entry on the list is a snapshot of a specific food serving (“raw apple with
skin,” for example) that shows how much the serving weighs and how much
of these it contains:
 Calcium
 Carbohydrates
 Cholesterol
 Dietary fiber
 Fat
 Folate
 Food energy (calories)
 Iron
 Magnesium
 Niacin
 Phosphorus
 Potassium
238
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Protein
 Riboflavin (vitamin B2)
 Saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fat
 Sodium
 Thiamin (vitamin B1)
 Vitamin A
 Vitamin B6
 Vitamin B12
 Vitamin C
 Water (as a percentage of the serving’s weight)
Here’s how to find the food you’re looking for:
1. Type its name into the empty search box and then press Enter.
For example, apple.
2. Ignore the fancy stuff. Scroll down and click something basic.
Up comes a list of possibilities such as “Baby food, juice, apple and
grape” or “Baby food, apples and turkey, strained.” In this case, clicking
“Apples, raw, with skin” brings up a new screen listing various forms of
raw apples such as “100 grams edible portion” or “1 cup, quartered 
or chopped” or “1 large (31⁄4" diameter) (approx 2 per pound).”
3. Click the box in front of the serving you prefer and click the Submit
button.
There you are — calories and nutrients for one large apple, including
cholesterol, dietary fiber, and the different kinds of fats.
The Weight Control Information Network
www.niddk.nih.gov/health/nutrit/win.htm
Weight control is an important path to controlling cholesterol, so the Weight
Control Information Network (WIN) site belongs on your must-see list. The
homepage for this site, which is maintained by the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases (NIDDK), gives you access to a database with articles, books, and
audiovisual material related to weight loss, plus a wealth of statistics on
weight and weight maintenance, and NIH research studies.
In fact, the list of information is so complete you could lose weight just lifting it.

Ten Cholesterol Myths
In This Chapter
 Quantifying cholesterol’s risks for women and kids
 Fooling around with fiber facts
 Getting it right on red meat
 Fighting cholesterol with Woody Allen and the Duchess of Windsor
I
n the words of the queen in Lewis Carroll’s classic tale, Alice’s Adventures
in Wonderland, “I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before
breakfast.” Who hasn’t?
For example, everyone knows that (a) chocolate is bad for your heart, (b)
margarine is better than butter, and (c) women don’t need to worry about
cholesterol. Except (a) it isn’t, (b) it isn’t, and (c) I’m getting ahead of myself.
In short, this chapter uncovers the truth hiding behind several common 
misperceptions about cholesterol.
Most of the Cholesterol in Your 
Body Comes from Food
Yes, you get some cholesterol from food, but the surprising fact is that most
of the waxy material floating through your bloodstream is made right in your
very own body. Your liver processes the proteins, fats, and carbs you eat to
churn out about 1 gram (1,000 milligrams) of cholesterol every day.
Your body uses a lot of this homemade cholesterol to perform various functions
such as enabling your brain cells to shoot messages back and forth. (Check out
Chapter 2 for the other uses.) But when you bring in additional cholesterol from
food, trouble may loom.
To keep your cholesterol level within healthy bounds, the Dietary Guidelines for
Americans, from our good friends at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), recommend
that you consume no more than 300 milligrams of cholesterol a day from food.

But here’s a surprise: Overall, the total amount of fat and saturated fat in
your diet now seems to be more important than the amount of cholesterol in
the foods you eat in determining your cholesterol level. Which leads me
nicely into the very next myth.
All Fatty Foods Raise Your Cholesterol
Wrong. Why? Because — here comes some good info — all dietary fats are
not alike. The difference lies in saturation, the number of hydrogen atoms
attached to the carbon atoms on dietary-fat molecules. I won’t waste your
time by reprinting the entire fat/saturation spiel I present in Chapter 5.
Suffice it to say that saturated fatty acids, commonly known as “sat fats,”
increase the amount of fat in your blood, including the amount of low-density
lipoproteins (LDLs), the “bad” particles that ferry cholesterol into your arteries.
On the other hand, monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids,
like those found in high-fat plant foods such as nuts and avocados (see Chapter 6),
may actually reduce the amount of fats in your blood, including LDLs.
But before you go getting too excited, keep these facts in mind:
 All fats are relatively high in calories. (They contain twice as many calories
per gram as proteins and carbs.)
 A higher-calorie diet promotes weight gain.
 Weight gain raises cholesterol.
The moral of this little tale? Not all dietary fats are “bad,” but a little goes a
long way.
Women Never Have to Worry 
about Their Cholesterol
Ah, if only it were true. Women do tend to have lower cholesterol levels than
men do from adolescence right through middle age. One protective weapon in a
woman’s cholesterol-fighting arsenal seems to be the female body’s continuous,
natural stream of estrogen.
Researchers have made this deduction from the fact that a woman’s cholesterol
level rises with the onset of menopause and the slowdown in her natural
production of estrogen.
242
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Older women are actually more likely than older men to have high cholesterol,
but women do have one other lifelong advantage in the heart game. Their blood
vessels are more elastic — that is, they are more likely than a man’s blood ves-
sels to stay wide open — which may help protect against high blood pressure
and a heart-stopping blood clot.
Children Have No Cholesterol Problems
Ah, if only this were true, too. Infants require fatty acids, including saturated
fatty acids, to promote and sustain proper growth and development, including
the growth and development of nerve and brain cells (see Chapter 2, please).
In the 1980s, when overzealous parents sought to protect their babies by feeding
them formulas made of skim milk, a disastrous epidemic of babies who failed to
grow and develop as normally expected occurred.
Today, the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Academy of
Pediatrics (AAP) recommend a food plan with sufficient amounts of all fats
for children up to the age of 2. After that, the kiddy cholesterol squad gets
tough with the tykes.
According to the AHA, by age 12, as many as seven out of every ten American
children have fatty deposits in their arteries. To counter this trend, the AHA
recommends testing cholesterol levels in any child older than 2 who has a
family history of coronary artery disease in parents or grandparents younger
than 55.
Eating More Dietary Fiber 
Lowers Blood Cholesterol
The answer to this myth is another, “Not necessarily.” As you can see in
Chapter 5, there are two kinds of dietary fiber, insoluble and soluble.
Insoluble dietary fiber is the rough stuff — cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose —
in leaves, grasses, twigs, seeds, and bran (the hard outer covering of grains).
Human beings literally don’t have the stomach for insoluble fiber. To pull
nutrients out of insoluble fibers, animals need a very long gut and sometimes
more than one stomach — a physical setup common to animals such as cows
but not to us.
243
Chapter 17: Ten Cholesterol Myths

Soluble dietary fiber — gums and pectins — is found in the flesh of grains,
fruits, and veggies. Examples include pectin in apples and beta glucan, the
gum that makes oatmeal sticky. (Beans are also a good source of beta glucan.)
Soluble dietary fiber sops up cholesterol. Insoluble dietary fiber doesn’t.
Increasing your consumption of insoluble dietary fiber, which moves food
through your intestinal tract faster, will reduce your risk of constipation, but
it won’t lower your cholesterol.
Increasing your consumption of soluble dietary fiber will turn those cholesterol
numbers downward, but only by about 10 percent (or less). Listen, nothing’s
perfect.
Cholesterol Is the Only Thing That Leads
to Plaque in Your Arteries
Actually, no. An amino acid called homocysteine may be equally at fault. Your
body makes homocysteine as a byproduct of digesting proteins.
Homocysteine circulates into your arteries, and it can rough up the interior
surface of the vessels, producing miniscule chinks and ledges for cholesterol
to cling to.
After cholesterol latches on the arterial wall, it attracts more cholesterol
particles and other cellular debris, building teeny-weeny little piles of junk
that become plaque. Alert: Heart attack looms.
As you can see in Chapter 2, a diet rich in the B vitamin folate appears to
reduce homocysteine levels, thus reducing the risk of a heart attack. One
group of foods truly packed with folic acid is green, leafy veggies. (Turn back
to Chapter 2 — yes, again — for a list of foods high in folic acid.)
Red Meat Has More Cholesterol 
Than Chicken or Turkey
No. Although red meat, even lean beef, has more total fat per ounce and up to
five times as much saturated fat as chicken or turkey, dark chicken or turkey
(the succulent leg and thigh) may deliver more cholesterol per ounce.
Go figure. Better yet, you can check out the figures in Table 17-1.

A Heart Attack Is the Only Health Risk
Associated with High Cholesterol
Alas, no. Plaque buildup is not specific to the coronary arteries. A person
with high cholesterol may also develop plaque deposits in the arteries that
feed blood to the brain.
Cerebral thrombosis, the most common form of stroke, occurs when a blood
clot (thrombus) forms in a cerebral blood vessel, blocking the vessel and
depriving brain cells of blood and oxygen. According to the American Heart
Association, cerebral thrombosis is most common in arteries already damaged
or narrowed by plaque.
This is not a trivial matter. According to the American Heart Association/
American Stroke Association Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics, 2007 Update,
in 2004, stroke was to blame for 1 of every 16 deaths in the United States.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health
Statistics ranks stroke as the third leading cause of death for Americans, right
up there behind heart disease and cancer. Here are the facts concerning
stroke in the United States:
 On average, every three to four minutes someone in America dies of a
stroke.
 In 2004, 150,147 Americans suffered a fatal stroke.
245
Chapter 17: Ten Cholesterol Myths

 More women than men die after having a stroke; in 2004, the numbers
were 91,487 women versus 58,660 men.
 Of the people who suffer a stroke, 4.5 percent are younger than 60.
Finally, here is a cholesterol fact to ruin your romantic evening. Most of us
worry about cholesterol’s effects on coronary arteries, but the truth is
cholesterol doesn’t differentiate between a coronary blood vessel and one in
any other part of the body, like the penis.
Yes, you read that right. High cholesterol may cause plaque buildup that blocks
the blood vessels carrying blood to the penis. A reduction in blood flow to the
penis caused by a blocked vessel in the leg or penis itself would “certainly”
affect a man’s ability to sustain erection, says one urologist at the male sexual
dysfunction clinic at Johns Hopkins Medical Centers in Baltimore, Maryland.
Chew on that one the next time you plan dinner for your beloved — if your
beloved is male, of course.
Changing Your Diet Is the Only 
Way to Control Your Cholesterol
No again. In fact, this book includes one whole chapter (Chapter 8) on how
regular exercise lowers cholesterol, a second one (Chapter 7) on the virtues
of weight control, a third (Chapter 9) on why you should stop smoking right
now, and last but not least, a fourth (Chapter 10) describing the cholesterol-
control benefits of consuming alcohol in moderation.
You Can Never Be Too Rich or Too Thin,
and Your Cholesterol Can Never 
Be Too Low
I’m a writer, a class of workers rarely overburdened with too much cash, so I’m
not going to argue with the first part of that heading. But I am a nutrition
writer, so I know that excessive thinness can be a sign of poor health or the
result of an eating disorder such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia.
246
Part V: The Part of Tens 

As for cholesterol, believe it or not, too low can be as problematic as too
high. For example, if your cholesterol suddenly takes a nosedive into the
basement below 100 mg/dL, your doctor may not be smiling when he brings
you the news. Hypocholesterolemia — very low cholesterol — can signal
danger ahead. What kind of danger? Malnutrition, an overactive thyroid,
cirrhosis of the liver, and certain forms of cancer (colon cancer and liver
cancer are good guesses).
Having consistently low cholesterol is not always a guarantee of long life. In
the late 1990s, in a survey of 3,500 Japanese American male residents of
Hawaii, researchers found a higher death rate among the men with the lowest
cholesterol levels (about 149 mg/dL) than among men whose cholesterol
levels circled around the supposedly borderline 232 mg/dL mark.
Since then, both American and British medical journals have published reports
that state a total cholesterol level below 160 mg/dL appears to be tied to a higher
risk of death from the diseases and conditions I mention above, especially in men
who drink, smoke, and have high blood pressure. That is, if they don’t take
matters into their own hands first:
 A relatively early study (1966) reported in the prestigious British Medical
Journal carried results of a French survey of data for 6,393 men showing
that those with low cholesterol had an incidence of suicide three times
higher than the incidence among men with middling or high cholesterol.
 Moving right ahead, in 1999, the British Journal of Psychiatry published a
report from Finland’s Public Health Institute in which men with very low
cholesterol were more likely than men with high cholesterol to be
hospitalized for depression.
247
Chapter 17: Ten Cholesterol Myths
Thin quiz
Wait. Before you go, who’s thought to have first
said that quote about never being too rich or too
thin?
a. Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie
b. The Duchess of Windsor
c. Fergie, the Duchess of York
d. King Lear
Answer: (b) The Duchess of Windsor, also
known as Wallis Warfield Simpson, the “origi-
nal” Camilla Parker Bowles. To marry Wallis, a
divorced woman, King Edward VIII gave up the
British throne on December 11, 1936, to King
George the VI, the father of Queen Elizabeth II,
the mother of Prince Charles, and mother-in-
law first to Princess Diana and then to Ms.
Parker Bowles. Whether Wallis actually
uttered the rich/thin words, the second part is
still bad advice, health-wise.

Some researchers suggest these increased rates of depression and suicide
may occur because low-fat or low-cholesterol diets reduce the levels of a
brain chemical called serotonin that promotes a feeling of well-being.
In the end, one is left to ponder the strangeness of life and the weirdly pre-
scient message in Woody Allen’s character who, in the 1973 movie, Sleeper,
wakes up in the year 2173 to discover that hamburgers, French fries, and
milkshakes are health food. In 2007? Not so much.

Cholesterol Moments
In This Chapter
 Announcing the bad news about saturated fats
 Naming cholesterol as a heart risk
 Tuning up with Mr. Fit
 Pinning the rap on LDLs
 Introducing cholesterol-buster meds
T
his chapter is a handy guide to a half-century’s worth of advances in the
science of protecting your heart by keeping your arteries clean and your
body in tip-top shape.
As you read through the list, think about all those people who spent their
time sitting at lab benches or adding up statistics to enhance your possibility
of living a full, rich life. Clearly, a heartfelt, “Thanks a lot,” is in order.
Finding the “Wow!” factor
The word eureka loosely translates from the
Greek as, “Oh, boy, look what I discovered,” a
statement most commonly attributed to the
ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes.
Sitting in his bath one day, Old Archie suddenly
realized that he could calculate the volume of
an irregularly shaped solid object, such as him-
self, by immersing the object into water and
measuring how much liquid it displaced.
Some versions of the Archimedes tale say that
right after shouting “Heureka!” (Greek for
“Eureka!”), Archimedes leaped out of the tub
and ran starkers through the streets of his native
Syracuse. Whether his fellow citizens shouted
“Heureka!” upon seeing him is lost to history.

1957: The Prudent Diet
The Prudent Diet was the brainchild of the Diet and Coronary Heart Disease
Study Project of the Bureau of Nutrition at the New York City Department of
Health. 
Well before the establishment decided that the risk of heart attack may be
lowered by reducing the intake of foods high in saturated fats while empha-
sizing unsaturated fats, the New Yorkers (whom I’m proud to say included my
uncle, Seymour H. Rinzler, MD) said, “Let’s try it.”
Boy, were they ever right. By the end of the fourth year of the study, the inci-
dence of heart attack among the middle-aged, often-overweight male participants
was far below the numbers that researchers had predicted.
As a result, the Prudent Diet became the role model for the American Heart
Association’s Step I and Step II eating plans (check ’em out in Chapter 4), and
a new approach to eating your way to a healthy heart was born.
1958: Introducing Cholesterol Busters
Cholestyramine (brand name: Questran, Questran Light) was the first cholesterol-
lowering drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
This prescription drug sops up natural digestive juices and bile acids found in
your intestines and eliminates them from your body. Because you need bile
compounds to digest food, your body responds by converting cholesterol into
bile, thus lowering the amount of cholesterol in your blood vessels. (Read the
whole story in Chapter 12.)
Cholestyramine is almost 50 years old, and although some of its market has
been taken over by the statin drugs (see “1986: Unveiling Statins” later in this
chapter), it’s still selling. Two years ago, cholestyramine’s manufacturer
appealed to the FDA for permission to sell it as an over-the-counter product
rather than a prescription drug. The FDA nixed the idea.
1971: Naming Cholesterol an Official
Risk Factor for Heart Attack
Framingham, Massachusetts, is a small industrial town about 20 miles west of
Boston. I mean no disrespect to its hardworking inhabitants when I say that
you would probably never have heard of Framingham if a team of Boston
250
Part V: The Part of Tens 

University Medical School researchers hadn’t set up shop there shortly after
World War II. But they did. And they recruited most of the town’s nearly
30,000 citizens as volunteers in a study of who gets heart disease and why.
Within 20 years, an analysis of hundreds, maybe even thousands, of tests per-
formed on the Framingham residents produced statistics showing a relation-
ship between high serum (blood) cholesterol and the risk of heart attack.
Here are the numbers:
Cholesterol Level
Percentage of People 
with Heart Attack
<200 mg/dL
10
200–239 mg/dL
12
>240 mg/dL
18
Do those figures look familiar? You bet they do. Just check out the current
breakdown for high, medium, and low cholesterol levels in Chapter 3.
More to the point, these numbers led the Framingham researchers and the
National Heart Institute to create the first task force on arteriosclerosis,
another big step on the road to the general public becoming interested in
controlling cholesterol. Yeah, team!
1971: MRFIT Gets Going
The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) was an eight-year (1974–1982) 
study in which 250 scientists at 28 medical centers across the United States
interviewed 361,662 middle-aged men to get 12,866 volunteers. 
The volunteers were thought to be at high risk for heart attack based on risk
factors such as age, smoking habits, a high-cholesterol diet, high blood pressure,
and obesity.
The guys were divided into two groups: One group was taught to modify their
behavior; the other was left to their own devices. At the end of the trial, the
big news was that nonsmokers with lower cholesterol and lower blood pres-
sure were less likely to have a heart attack. Today we take that for granted.
1984: Indicting Hypercholesterolemia
In 1984, a 14-member panel of distinguished scientists gathered at the National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute for a Consensus Development Conference to
251
Chapter 18: Ten (Okay, Eleven) “Eureka!” Cholesterol Moments

analyze the existing studies on cholesterol and heart disease and invite testi-
mony relating to evidence linking the risk factor to the disease.
What they heard was so convincing that they certified hypercholesterolemia —
a nine-syllable way to say high cholesterol — as a medical condition worthy of
treatment. And just like that, practically overnight, millions of people who 
once considered themselves healthy had something to worry about. Ain’t 
science great?
1985: Recognizing the Risk from LDLs
For years, cholesterol researchers plodded along thinking plain old high choles-
terol was the basic risk factor for heart disease. They also wondered why some
people with sky-high cholesterol readings never had heart attacks.
Joseph L. Goldstein and Michael S. Brown of the University of Texas Health
Center in Dallas changed all that on October 14, 1985, when they won the
Nobel Prize for identifying LDLs as the true risk factor in the cholesterol
game. Bravo, Goldstein and Brown!
1985–1987: Establishing the National
Cholesterol Education Program
The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) was created in 1985,
released to an advisory panel in 1986, and announced to the American public
in 1987. Based on the Framingham stats (see “1971: Naming Cholesterol an
Official Risk Factor for Heart Attack” earlier in this chapter), the NCEP formally
designated levels of cholesterol as “high” (>240 mg/dL), “borderline high”
(200–239 mg/dL), and “desirable” (<200 mg/dL).
This classification formally declared more than 25 percent of all Americans as
being at risk of heart attack from high cholesterol. Wow! Who knew?
1986: Unveiling Statins
Statin is shorthand for a class of drugs that lowers cholesterol at the source
by interrupting your liver’s natural production of this fatty substance. The
first two statins — pravastatin (Pravachol) and simvastatin (Zocor) — appeared
in 1986. The third, lovastatin (Mevacor), came online the following year. 
252

For the full story on statins, check out Chapter 12. For the big problem with
statins, run your finger down to “2001: Baycol Bombs.”
1988, 1993, 2001: ATP I, 
ATP II, ATP III
The National Cholesterol Education Program’s Expert Panel on Detection,
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults report is one whale
of a mouthful, so the whole thing is commonly called ATP (adult treatment
panel), which certainly slides more easily off the tongue.
ATP I, published in 1988, focused on prevention and offered tips for warding
off heart disease in healthy people with high cholesterol. The report also
identified LDLs as a primary target, advising people whose LDLs are higher
than “normal” to work with their doctors to reduce their risk for heart
disease by lowering LDLs.
ATP II came out in 1993. Once again, the report stressed the importance of
getting LDLs down into a healthy range, but ATP II added something new.
Moving from prevention for healthy people to the management of existing
heart disease, the report urged people who’d already had a heart attack to
lower their LDLs, preferably to 100 mg/dL (or less).
ATP III, the current version, appeared in 2001. The advice to lower LDLs is
still included, but once again, the National Cholesterol Education Program
has come up with something new. The report identifies a new condition called
metabolic syndrome (multiple risk factors, such as high blood pressure, obesity,
smoking, and high cholesterol) as an important warning of heart disease
ahead. 
ATP III also offers a version of a medical crystal ball — a risk-factor-based
formula that enables you to determine whether you should be on cholesterol-
busting drugs (see Chapter 12) and guesstimate your odds of having a heart
attack in the next ten years. If you’re brave enough to face the future, you can
do the math in Chapter 3.
2001: Baycol Bombs
Baycol, the brand name for the drug cerivastatin, was introduced by Bayer
A.G. in 1997 and, as you can see from the date on this entry, taken off the
market a scant four years later.
253
Chapter 18: Ten (Okay, Eleven) “Eureka!” Cholesterol Moments

One side effect of statin drugs, a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs, is
rhabdomyolysis — the destruction of muscle cells. If enough muscle cells are
destroyed, the debris may pile up in your kidneys, triggering kidney failure.
Among Baycol users, the incidence of cell damage was ten times greater than
it was for people using other statins, and the effect was far more likely to be
fatal.
By August 7, 2001, when Bayer took Baycol off the market, at least 31 deaths
were linked to the medication in the United States, and the FDA had reports
of nine more abroad. As of 2007, the number of deaths attributed to Baycol
worldwide has climbed past the 100 mark.
For more details on Baycol and the risks associated with other statins, turn
to Chapter 12. The lesson to take away from this short set of paragraphs is
simple: Never take any drug without reading the fine print.
2001–2004: Anti-Cholesterol 
Combo Pills
When it comes to therapeutic drugs, time marches on and so do the innovations.
In 2001, Kos Pharmaceuticals introduced Advicor, the first anti-cholesterol com-
bination pill. Advicor contains extended-release niacin (believed to raise HDLs,
the “good” cholesterol) and the statin drug lovastatin (Lipitor). Three years later,
Merck/Schering-Plough released Vytorin, a combo that includes ezetimibe (a
drug that reduces the body’s absorption of fats, including cholesterol) plus
the statin drug simvastatin (Zocor). And Pfizer introduced Caduet, which
contains the anti-hypertension drug amlodipine (Norvasc) plus the statin
lovastatin (Lipitor). 
The good news about these two-fers is that a person who needs two drugs
can get them both in a single pill. The bad news is that the pill provides the
risk of two drugs along with the benefits.
Whether the benefits outweigh the risks for a specific patient is a question
only that person (and his doctor) can decide. For investors, the answer is
crystal clear. In 2006, Advicor scored $116 million in sales; by summer 2007,
Vytorin was a $2 billion/year blockbuster; and Caduet sales are predicted to
hit $1.1 billion by 2008. Eureka!
